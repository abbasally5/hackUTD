Akari:
Hey... they say it's 5 centimeters per second...
Takaki:
Huh? What is?
Akari:
The speed of falling cherry blossom petals is 5 centimeters per second.
Takaki:
Really?
 You know a lot of stuff like that, Akari.
Akari:
You know, they look just like snowflakes...
Takaki:
I guess...
Hey! Wait up!
Akari!
Akari:
Takaki!
 I hope that we see the cherry blossoms together next spring!


petal(s): 花びら

Akari:
Dear Takaki Tono.
 I'm sorry that I haven't written for so long...
Though summers are hot here, too, they're a lot milder than Tokyo's.
 But when I think about it, I like the hot, humid summers of Tokyo too.
 The melting-hot pavement, and skyscrapers in the distance shimmering in the heat.
 And the freezing air-conditioning in department stores and subways.
The last time we were together was at our elementary school graduation.
 It's been half a year since then.
 Do you still remember me?

Dear Takaki,
Thank you for writing me back.
 It made me so happy.
It's already well into autumn and the leaves are turning beautiful colors.
 The day before yesterday, I pulled out a sweater for the first time this year...

classmate:
Tono?
Takaki:
...Hi.
classmate:
What's that? A love letter?
Takaki:
No it's not.
classmate:
Sorry for having asked you to do all that.
Takaki:
It was no problem.
classmate:
Thank you.
 Hey, are you really transferring to another school?
Takaki:
Yeah, at the end of the school year.
classmate:
Where?
Takaki:
To Kagoshima, because of my parents.
classmate:
Really? I'll miss you.

Akari:
Lately I've been getting up early because of school activities.
 So I'm writing this letter on the train.
I had my hair cut the other day.
 It's so short that my ears even show.
 You probably wouldn't even recognize me.

Takaki's mother:
I'm home.
Takaki:
Hi, Mom.

Akari:
I bet you'll change little by little over time too...


humid: 湿度の高い、むしむしする
shimmer: （光・熱などによる）きらめき・揺らめき
skyscraper: 超高層ビル
little by little: 少しずつ、徐々に


(3:05)
Akari:
Dear Takaki.
Are you doing alright, even with all this cold weather?
Here, it's already snowed a few times.
 Every time it does, I have to really bundle myself up when I go to school.
 I'm sure it hasn't snowed in Tokyo yet, has it?
 I'm always checking Tokyo's weather too, even though I don't live there anymore.

fellow:
I sure wish it would rain.

fellow2:
 It wouldn't be any easier indoors.
Takaki:
Hey, have either of you guys ever been to Tochigi?
fellow:
Where?
Takaki:
Tochigi.
fellow:
Nope.
Takaki:
So you know how to get there?
fellow:
I don't know... on the bullet train, maybe?
Takaki:
A long way...
senior:
Freshmen!
Takaki and fellows:
Coming!
senior:
Last three times! Fight! Fight! ...

Freshmen:
Oh!

senior:
Fight!

Akari:
I was really surprised when I heard you'll be transferring schools.
 We both got used to transferring schools when we were little.
 But still, Kagoshima... that's kind of far away, isn't it?
It's no longer a distance where I can just jump on a train and see you whenever I want.
It does make me feel... well... kind of sad...
I just hope that you'll be fine.

Dear Takaki,
I'm so happy we'll see each other on March 4th.
 It'll have been a year since we last met.
 For some reason, I feel kind of nervous.
There's a big cherry tree by my house.
 When the spring comes, the petals will fall at 5 centimeters per second.
How I wish the spring could come along with you on that day.


bundle oneself up: 十分に服を着る


(5:35)
classmate:
You wanna stop by somewhere on the way back?
classmate:
Might as well, since it's raining and all.
classmate:
They said it's going to turn to snow tonight on the weather report.
classmate:
Really? I thought it felt cold.
 We're already in March.
classmate:
I hope we don't get colds.
 Hey, we should have something hot to drink!
classmate:
Yeah, let's do that!
fellow in soccer club:
Tono, let's get to practice!
Takaki:
Oh yeah, practice...
Actually I can't make it today.
fellow in soccer club:
Getting ready to move?
Takaki:
Yeah, sorry...

Akari:
It's so nice of you, coming all the way to my station.
 It's a long trip, so be sure to take care of yourself...
 I'll be waiting for you at 7 o'clock that night in the station's waiting room...



(6:34)
Takaki:
That afternoon, on the day I was to meet Akari, it started to snow.

Akari:
Hey, Takaki! It's that cat, Chobi.
Takaki:
He's the little one who's always here, isn't he?
Akari:
But it looks like he's all alone today.
 Where is Mimi, kitty?
 Aren't you kind of sad being all alone?

Takaki:
How do you like the book?
Akari:
I like it!
 Last night I read 4 billion years' worth of evolution.
Takaki:
Which part?
Akari:
Where they talked about the Anomalocaris.
Takaki and Akari:
The Cambrian Age!
Akari:
I really love the Hallucigenias. They look like this.
Takaki:
Yeah, something like that.
Akari:
So what's your favorite?
Takaki:
The Opabinia, I guess.
Akari:
You mean the one with five eyes?

Takaki:
As I look back, I think Akari and I were very alike somehow.
 One year after I'd transferred to the school in Tokyo, Akari transferred there too, and was in my class.
 We were both kind of small for our age, and we both had really bad allergies, so we preferred the library to the playground.
 So naturally, we got close to each other.
 It caused our classmates to tease us.
But it didn't matter much to us.
 Because of the friendship we had.
For some reason, I just assumed that we'd be going to... the same junior high.
 And that we'd always be together.

announcement:
Shinjuku, Shinjuku, this is the terminal station...
 For passengers getting off, please change to Kyo-O subway for all J.R. lines...
Takaki:
It was the first time I had been to Shinjuku Station alone.
 And it would be the first time I had been to any of those places on my route.
My heart was pounding.
I was going to meet Akari...!
girl:
So tell me, how did it go with that guy?
girl:
Who?
girl:
The one from Nishi-Sho.
girl:
Him? Don't you think he's a dork?
announcement:
We'll soon be arriving at Musashi-Urawa station, Musashi-Urawa station.

(9:37)
Akari:
Um, this is Akari Shinohara.
 May I speak to Takaki, please?
It's Akari.
Takaki:
Transferring schools...
 What about Nishi Junior High?
 After all that work to get accepted.
Akari:
They said they'd do the paperwork to get me into the school in Tochigi.
 I'm sorry...
Takaki:
No, there's nothing for you to apologize for...
Akari:
I told them I wanted to stay with my aunt in Katsushika, and commute.
 But they said no, that I'd have to wait until I'm older...
Takaki:
All right! Don't tell me any more!
 That's enough...!
Akari:
Sorry...
Takaki:
I held the receiver so tight against my ear, it was like I could feel her pain directly through the phone.
 ...But there was nothing I could do.


commute: 通勤・通学する


(10:32)
passenger :
That was tasty!
passenger:
Yeah! Thanks a lot. Good-bye!
passenger:
See you later.
Takaki:
The terminal station, where I switched trains, was filled with commuters heading home.
 Everyone's shoes were soaked with snow and water.
 The air was chilly, and full of that certain smell a city has on a snowy day.
announcement:
This is an announcement for all passengers.
 Utsunomiya lines, bound in the direction of Oyama and Utsunomiya, will be arriving 8 minutes behind schedule due to heavy snow.
 We apologize for...
Takaki:
Until that moment, it never even crossed my mind... that the train might be delayed.
 Suddenly, I became really worried...


commuter(s): 通勤・通学者
soak: ～をずぶ濡れにする
chilly: 寒い


(11:11)

(12:40)
announcement:
This is Nogi.
 We'd like to express our apologies as this train will temporarily stop at this station, due to the late arrival of a connecting train.
Takaki:
The stations seemed unbelievably far apart...
 And each time the train stopped at a station, it seemed like an eternity...
The unfamiliar snow-covered wilderness outside the window, the slow passage of time, and hunger... all added to my feelings of uneasiness.
 I'm already late to meet her.
 I'm sure she's starting to worry.
 On that day... the day I got that call, Akari must have been much more upset than even I was.
 And I wasn't able to comfort her.
I felt so ashamed of myself.
Akari:
Well... I guess today... we say goodbye...
Takaki:
I received the first letter from her a half year later, during the summer of my first year in junior high.
 I knew her letter by heart.
 Over the two weeks before the day we were to meet
 I wrote a letter to give to Akari.
There are just so many things that I wanted to tell her.
 So many things... I wanted to ask her.
announcement:
We apologize for the delay.
The train will soon depart for Utsunomiya.


wilderness: 荒野
uneasiness: 不安
know ～ by heart: 暗記する

 We apologize for this delay, but at present aren't at liberty to say when service will resume.
Akari:
Dear Takaki,
 How are you?
 Lately, I've been getting up early because I'm busy with school activities...
Takaki:
When I read her letters, I always envisioned her alone.
In the end, the train spent around two hours... motionless, in the middle of nowhere.
 Every minute seemed like an eternity.
 Time felt heavy with malice, as it slowly crept by.
All I could do was... grit my teeth, and try to hold back my tears.
 Akari... please... please... don't wait for me...
If you'd just go back home...!

(20:06)
Takaki:
This is good!
Akari:
Really? It's just regular roasted tea.
Takaki:
Roasted tea? I've never had it before.
Akari:
What? I'm sure you have!
Takaki:
You think?
Akari:
Of course!
 ...I made this for you. So I can't promise it's any good.
 Have some if you want.
Takaki:
Thank you.
 I haven't eaten in hours.
Akari:
So, how is it?
Takaki:
I've never had anything so delicious before.
Akari:
You're exaggerating!
Takaki:
I'm serious!
Akari:
It's just because you're hungry.
Takaki:
You think?
Akari:
I'm sure it is.
 I'll have some, too.
You're going to move soon, right?
Takaki:
Yeah, next week.
Akari:
Kagoshima, huh...?
Takaki:
It's so far away.
Akari:
Yeah.
Takaki:
But it turned out Tochigi is quite a ways away, too.
Akari:
It is. I guess you won't be able to go home now.
station staff:
We're gonna have to close up, kids.
 I'm sorry there're no more trains.
Takaki:
Okay.
station staff:
Take care. It's snowing heavily out there.
Akari and Takaki:
Thank you.


exaggerate: 大げさに言う、誇張する
quite a ways: かなり遠い

(21:41)
Akari:
 ...Can you see it? that tree?
Takaki:
The one you wrote about in your letter?
Akari:
Yes. The cherry tree.
Hey... they look like snowflakes...
Takaki:
You're right, they do.

Takaki:
At that moment, I felt like I understood things like the existence of eternity, the heart and the soul...
 I felt as though we had shared all the experiences of my 13 years.
 And the next moment... I became unbearably sad.
 Sad because I didn't know what to do with her warmth against me, or what to do with that soul, or how long I should hold onto them.
 I also came to the realization that... we would not be able to stay together...
 The overwhelming weight of our lives to come and the uncertainty of time hung over us.
But soon, all my fears began to melt away, leaving only Akari's soft lips on mine.
That night, we stayed in a tiny shack by the corner of a field.
 Wrapped up in an old blanket, we talked all night...
 Until finally, we fell asleep.
The next morning, when the train started, I got ready to leave.
 And there... Akari and I say goodbye.
Akari:
I... Takaki...
 Takaki, I think... you'll be... you'll be okay! I know you will be...!
Takaki:
Thank you for that...!
 Take care of yourself, Akari!
 I'll write to you! I'll call!
I didn't even mention it... the letter I lost.
 Because after we'd kissed, it seemed like the whole world had completely changed.
I wanted so badly to be able to protect her.
 That was all I could think about... as I gazed absently out the window...


unbearably: 我慢できないほど
overwhelming: 圧倒的な、どうしようもない
uncertainty: 不確実なもの
shack: 掘っ立て小屋
