Kanae's sister:
Kanae! You going after class, too?
Kanae:
Yeah. How 'bout you, sis?
Kanae's sister:
Sure. But make sure you do your homework too, okay?
Kanae:
I will.

Kanae:
...Here goes!
Takaki:
Good morning, Kanae!
Kanae:
Hello, Tono. You're early again.
Takaki:
You too, Sumida.
 Did you go to the beach?
Kanae:
Sure did.
Takaki:
You're practicing hard.
Kanae:
Well, not really.
 ...See you later, Tono.
Takaki:
Later.


(27:53)
Teacher:
Are we ready?
 It's about time to make your decisions.
 I need all of you to get this to me by Monday.
 Talk it over with your parents.

classmate:
It sounds like Sasaki's going to university in Tokyo.
classmate:
I'll probably have to go to some junior college in Kumamoto.
classmate:
And you, Kanae?
Kanae:
Well...
classmate:
So what, you think you'll get a job?
Kanae:
Um...
classmate:
You're not thinking about anything, are you?
classmate:
Nothing except Takaki Tono.
classmate:
I bet he has a girl back in Tokyo.
Kanae:
Cut it out!


(28:47)
Kanae's sister:
Still having a rough time?
Kanae:
I don't know what's wrong...
Kanae's sis:
You shouldn't worry yourself so much.
 You'll catch the right wave again.
Kanae:
You're so easygoing, you know that?
Kanae's sis:
So what's the big rush?
Kanae:
Keep this up and I'll graduate without saying anything...

rough time: 大変な時期、つらい経験（rough:Longmanの３）
easygoing: 気楽な、楽観的な


(29:23)
Kanae:
Okay, thanks a lot! See you later!
Kanae's sis:
I can give you a ride.
Kanae:
That's all right. I'll take my scooter.

Takaki:
Sumida, you're heading home now?
Kanae:
Uh yeah... you too, Tono?
Takaki:
Uh-huh. Wanna head back together?
Kanae:
...If I was a dog, my tail would have been wagging so hard... my happiness would have been that obvious.
 I heaved a sigh of relief, thinking it was a good thing I wasn't a dog.
 And I was amazed with how stupid a thought that was, even for me.
Yet, the ride back home with Tono made me so happy.
Right from the beginning, Tono seemed somehow different from others.
Takaki:
I'm Takaki Tono.
 I'm used to transferring schools because of my dad's job.
But I'm not used to this island yet.
 It's nice to meet you all.
Kanae:
That very day, when I was in 8th grade, I fell in love with him.
 I studied hard because I wanted to go to the same high school as him.
 And somehow, I managed to pass my school's entrance exams.
 The more I see Tono, the more I love him.
 It's been scary and every day's been painful.
 But every time I see him, I'm happy and there was nothing I could do about it.
...Uh, Tono, the same thing again?
Takaki:
 It's so good!
 You really think about things.
 I mean there's always so much thought involved.
Kanae:
Yeah, I guess.
Takaki:
Okay. I'll be outside.
Kanae:
Okay.
 I'll have this.
Clerk:
That'll be 90 yen.
Kanae:
Here.
Clerk:
Thank you very much.

Takaki:
There you are. What'd you buy?
Kanae:
Well, at first I couldn't decide, but then I thought--
Sometimes I see Tono writing e-mails to somebody.
 I can't help wishing that he was writing to me... every time I see it.

Kanae:
Hey, Cub, I'm home.
 Come here, Cubby. I'm back now.

 Kanae Sumida, of class 3-1, please report to Mr. Ito in the counseling room.
classmate:
Hey Tono, isn't that your girlfriend?
Takaki:
She's not my girlfriend.

Teacher:
We're at year-end, and, you're the only one not to turn this in.
Kanae:
I'm sorry.
Teacher:
Hey, I really don't want to say it like this, but this is not something to get so worked up over.
 Has your sister said anything to you about it?
Kanae:
No...
Teacher:
If you can't make up your mind, why not try some junior college in the prefecture?

Because... this doesn't have anything to do with my sister...

nag: しつこく言う


(33:46)
Clerk:
Thanks again. Good night to you.
Kanae:
Thanks. Have a nice night. See ya later.
When I get near Tono, I get this tight sensation deep in my chest...
Tono!
Takaki:
Sumida, what's up?
 How'd you know I was here?
Kanae:
I saw your scooter, so I stopped by.
 Is that okay?
Takaki:
Yeah. I'm glad you came by.
 I mean, since we couldn't meet in the parking lot like we usually do.
Kanae:
Yeah...
He's so nice...
 Sometimes it makes me wanna cry...
Hey, Tono, are you gonna test to get into college?
Takaki:
Yeah, a college in Tokyo.
Kanae:
Tokyo? Really...
 I kinda thought so.
Takaki:
Why's that?
Kanae:
You just kinda seem like you wanna go somewhere far away, for some reason.
Takaki:
...How about you, Sumida?
Kanae:
I don't even know what I'll do tomorrow.
Takaki:
Maybe nobody does.
Kanae:
Really? Even you?
Takaki:
Naturally.
Kanae:
But you seem to know exactly what you're doing.
Takaki:
That's weird because I don't really.
 I'm sorta lost all the time.
 I just do what I can... that's all I can do.
Kanae:
Really...?
 Yeah, you're right.
Takaki:
Making a plane?
Kanae:
Yeah.

weird: 奇妙な


(36:40)
Takaki:
That's amazing...!
Kanae:
Towed at 5 kilometers per hour.
 To the south Tanega launch facility.
Takaki:
Huh.
Kanae:
There's gonna be a launch this year, isn't there?
Takaki:
Yeah, they say it's gonna go all the way to the center of the solar system.
It'll take years.

tow: けん引する
the solar system: 太陽系


(37:18)
Kanae's mother:
I want you to give Kanae advice on her future.
 She's so unfocused.
Kanae's sis:
She'll be all right.
 She's not a kid anymore.
 ...You know, I was just like her at her age.
Kanae:
Listen Cub, Tono doesn't know where he's going either.
 He's just like me, that Tono.

Takaki:
It must really be... a lonelier journey than anyone could imagine.
 Cutting through absolute darkness...
 Encountering nothing except the occasional stray hydrogen atom...
 Flying blindly into the abyss, believing there lays the answers to the mysteries of the universe.
 And us, to that end, how far should we go...?
 And how far can we go...?
I wonder... when did I get in the habit of writing messages... to nobody...?

unfocused: 集中力のない（unfocusという動詞はなく、focusedの反意語としてのみ存在）
stray: 散在する、はぐれた
hydrogen atom: 水素原子
abyss: 危険な状況、地表に開いた大穴、断崖、(２者の)大きな隔たり


(39:17)
Kanae's sister:
Kanae, have you figured out what you're going to do after graduation?
Kanae:
Not yet.
 But it's fine. I've made a decision.
 I'll just start by doing each thing that I can.
 I'm off!
After that day, several typhoons passed by the island, and each time they did, it became cooler.
 The wind that blows across the sugarcane field got crisper.
 The sky looked a little bigger, and the outlines of the clouds grew softer.
 The kids in my grade who ride scooters started wearing their jackets.
Then, on a mid-October day tinged with the remains of summer, I rode a wave for the first time in six months.

sugarcane: サトウキビ
crisp(er): さわやかな、心地よい
tinged with: (質・色・香りなど)を少し含んだ


(40:42)
announcement:
Tonight's forecast is clear with maximum wind speeds of 8 meters per second...
classmate:
I heard Yamada told Sasaki that he likes her!
classmate:
That's as expected!
 ...Huh? Kanae, you sure seem happy today!
classmate:
Did something happen with Tono?
Kanae:
(Giggles.)
classmates:
No way!
Teacher:
All right class. What is important in this formula, is the...

Kanae:
...Today I'm gonna tell Tono how I feel about him.
 If I don't tell him today, after riding that wave, I'll never be able to...
Takaki:
Sumida!
Kanae:
Hello, Tono...
Takaki:
Heading home now?
Kanae:
Yeah...
Takaki:
Really. Well, let's head home together.

Takaki:
Oh, you decided already?
Kanae:
Yeah...

Kanae:
Uh...
Takaki:
What is it?
Kanae:
...Don't be so...
Takaki:
So what...?
Kanae:
Um, sorry... i-it's nothing.

Takaki:
Something wrong?
Kanae:
Yeah, that's strange.
No good?
Takaki:
No. I wonder if the spark plug's dead.
 Was this a hand-me-down?
Kanae:
Yeah, from my sister.
Takaki:
Was it cutting out on you when you accelerated?
Kanae:
It might have been.
Takaki:
Well, let's leave them both here.
 We can have somebody come pick them up later for us.
 We can walk it.
Kanae:
I-I can walk by myself, Tono.
 You just head on home.
Takaki:
I've only got a little ways left to go.
 Besides, I kinda feel like walking.

as expected: 予想通り
formula: (数学)式・公式、いつものやり方、形式、処方
spark plug: エンジンの点火プラグ
hand-me-down: おさがり（→Merriam-Webster)


(43:24)
Kanae:
Tono, please...
Takaki:
What's wrong?
Kanae:
Sorry... It's nothing. I'm sorry...
Takaki:
Sumida...
Kanae:
I'm begging you... please... don't be so nice to me...!


(45:32)
Kanae:
Desperately, reaching recklessly towards the sky, launching that massive object in search of something... almost overwhelmingly far in the distance...
I began to understand why Tono seemed different from the others.
 At the same time, I came to a very clear realization that Tono was never looking at me...
 So that day I didn't say anything to Tono.
 ...Tono is certainly nice, very nice indeed.
...But, Tono's always looking past me... at something far beyond.
 I guess my wishes to be with Tono will never come true.
 But I still... but I still won't be able to stop loving him.
 Not today, not tomorrow, not ever...
I fell asleep that night crying.
The only thoughts in my head... being of Tono...

recklessly: 危険を顧みず、無謀にも、見境なく
massive: 巨大な、大質量の
overwhelmingly: すっかり、圧倒的に
