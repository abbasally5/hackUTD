Takaki:
I felt it strongly... that if I turned around at that moment, she'd have turned to look at me, too...

announcement:
The last Chofu-Line train bound for Tokyo is now arriving...

Akari's mother:
I wish you'd stay for the New Year's holiday!
Akari:
I know. But I have a lot of preparations.
Akari's father:
I suppose so.
 Be sure you cook something nice for him.
Akari:
I will.
Akari's mother:
Call us anytime you need to, Akari. Okay?
Akari:
I'll be fine. I'll see you at the wedding next month. Don't worry so much!
 You'd better head home--it's cold.
Last night, I dreamt about the past... when we were both still children.
 I guess... it's because of that old letter I found yesterday...

man:
Lisa!
Lisa:
Uh, yes?
man:
The meeting! Let's go.
Risa:
Coming.

Takaki:
In just living my life, it's as though sadness piles up all around me.
 It's in my bed, dried in the sun; the toothbrush in my bathroom; in the memory of my cell phone...



(52:54)
Takaki:
"I still love you."
 That's what the girl I'd been with for 3 years said in that e-mail.
 She wrote, "We must've exchanged e-mails a thousand times, but I doubt our hearts got closer by even a centimeter."
For the past few years, I've wanted to move on--to grasp onto something beyond my reach.
 What that is, I don't even know.
 All I've been able to do is go on working, not knowing where these obsessive thoughts come from.
Then one day, I realized my heart was withering... and in it there was nothing but pain.
 And one morning, I realized that my beliefs, that I once held so passionately, had completely disappeared...
 That was it. I couldn't take any more.
 ...So I quit my job.

Takaki:
Yesterday, I had a dream.
Akari:
...A dream of long ago.
Takaki:
In the dream, we were still 13 years old.
Akari:
...And we were standing in a field covered with snow...
Takaki:
...where in the dim light from distant houses...
Akari:
...our footsteps were all that could be seen in the new-fallen snow.
 And because of that, we both believed without any doubt that...
Takaki:
...Someday, together, we would watch the cherry blossoms fall again...
Akari:
...Again.
