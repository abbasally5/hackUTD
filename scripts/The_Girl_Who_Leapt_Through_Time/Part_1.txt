1. Opening - Passageway of Time

Makoto:
Ready!? Huh? What was that?

Chiaki:
Makoto! Throw the ball!

Makoto:
Did you guys hear something just now? Kinda like …

Chiaki:
Hear something?

Kousuke:
Like what?

Makoto:
Weird.

Chiaki:
Come on! Toss it.

Makoto:
Hum. Here comes!

Chiaki:
Ahh, man!

Kousuke:
Got it.

Makoto:
Guess what?

Kousuke:
What?

Makoto:
Yesterday I...a... I didn't get my pudding.

Chiaki:
Why? What happened?

Kousuke:
I bet your sister scarfed it down.

Makoto:
Yeah! And I was saving it for a special snack.
Little brat!
How dare she help herself to my stuff!

Chiaki
Aww! I did it again!

Miyuki:
Sis?

Makoto:
Huh?

Miyuki:
Sis!

Makoto:
Uh, what the.. Huh?

Kousuke:
Makoto, Makoto!

Makoto:
What?

Kousuke:
Heads up!

Makoto:
Oww, that hurt
Wow! Ah, huh, aha!

Miyuki:
It's about time you got up.


Makoto:
What'd you turn off the alarm for?

Miyuki:
Turned it off yourself!

TV:
Today is July thirteenth. And what a lovely day it is!
Yes, it's July thirteenth, which is a "Nice Day".
Oh, what do you mean?
Month seven, day one three is "Na-I-Su".

Miyuki:
Bye mom!

Mother:
Have a good day.

Makoto:
Oh, I'm in trouble.

Mother:
Finally managed to get up, did you?

Makoto:
Morning, Dad.

Father:
Oh, uh… Good morning.

Makoto:
I'm outta here.
(Native Notes: It sounds like "ah'm outta here.")

Mother:
Wait, Makoto, hang on a second.

Makoto:
What now…

Mother:
On your way home, could you take this to your Auntie Witch?
Tell her it's from Grandma.

Makoto:
No way! I don’t wanna lug all that stuff to school.

Mother
One more thing. Ask her when she's going to get married.

Makoto:
'Kay.

Mother:
Thanks.

Makoto:
See ya.

Mother:
Bye!　Have a good day.

Neighbor：
Oh. Morning Mako!
Makoto:
Good morning!

Makoto:
Oh, sorry about the ruckus every morning.


Makoto:
Hey, Chiaki!

Chiaki:
Hey, Makoto! Cutting it close. Maybe you should get up earlier.

Makoto:
That's priceless, coming from you.

Chiaki:
Fell back to sleep, didn't ya?

Makoto:
Shut up!

Chiaki:
Hey, what's in the basket?

Makoto:
None of your business!

Chiaki:
Come on! Tell me.

Kousuke:
Barely made it again. Why not give us some variety and be late for a change.

Chiaki:
Why so early, Kousuke?
Forget to jerk yourself off this morning?

Kousuke:
Haha! Very funny!

Makoto:
I made it with extra time to spare. Look!

Chiaki:
We totally lucky or what?
(Native Notes: Informal speech. "Are we totally lucky or what?" would be more formal.) 

Makoto:
I'm the lucky one, not you.

Chiaki:
Excuse me?

Makoto:
People say they're out of luck when something bad happens.
I always thought that was just a figure of speech, being lucky or unlucky.
But I guess I'm lucky.
Mr. Fukushima:
Now, people. Why do you think I was late in getting to class today?

Yuri:
Not a pop quiz!

Mr. Fukushima:
Yes, Hayakawa, correct.

Makoto:
What?!

Students:
Awww man! Are you serious!? Really!? Not again!!

Makoto:
I've gotta say I'm pretty lucky most of the time.
Not only lucky but I have good instincts too.
'Cause of that, my grades are okay.
I'm not exactly a brain but I'm not an idiot either.

Mr. Fukushima:
You have five more minutes. Huh?

Makoto:
I'm not dumb... by most standards.

Mr. Fukushima:
Five minutes.

Makoto:
This time doesn't count.
I'm not especially skilled in anything but I'm not a walking disaster either.
When I look back, I don't remember making any huge mess-ups.

Teacher:
What are you standing there for! Get the fire extinguisher! Hurry!

Takase:
Just a second!

Makoto:
Again, an exception.

Yuri:
Are you sure you're all right?

Makoto:
Yeah, but it singed my bangs a bit.
Normally I'm pretty careful, so I've never been hurt too bad.
And I make sure not to get involved in complicated relationships.

Jeez! You mind? Get off!
Come on, you idiot!? Move!

Kousuke:
Big man's up to bat.
He's batting .412 this year.
He's undefeated at the plate
Oh! Oh, man, oh, you little jerk!
Think you’re funny, huh? All right, funny man.


Motoko:
I don't think this has anything to do with your blood type horoscope.

Sekimi:
Yeah, but it says they're not compatible.
Could be dicey.

Moriko:
Who cares if it's dicey? She’s the one making the decision.

Kaho:
Um…



2. Time waits for no one

Yuri:
Makoto.

Makoto:
What's up?

Yuri:
Decided on going with Arts or Sciences yet?

Makoto:
Not yet. How about you?

Yuri:
Still thinking.

Makoto:
Good. Then I'm not the only one.

Yuri:
It's a big decision. We shouldn't rush it.

Makoto:
Yeah, who knows how things will turn out?

Yuri:
I'll be glad when all this is over.

Chiaki:
Hey, Makoto, how much longer are you gonna make us wait? (He slurred this)
(Native Notes: "longer + are" He slurred this.)


Makoto:
You could always come and help.

Chiaki:
Yeah, like that's ever gonna happen.

Kousuke:
Just hurry up, all right?

Makoto:
Yeah, yeah!

Yuri:
I wonder what Chiaki's going into?

Makoto:
Probably science. He's not the book type.

Yuri:
That's true. He is amazing in math class.

Makoto:
But that's it,
Anyway, why'd you bring up Chiaki?

Class mate:
Hey, why haven't the notebooks been put away?
Who's supposed to take them upstairs?

Makoto:
Um, I don’t know.

Yuri:
You are!


Makoto:
What a hassle!
Time waits for no one.
Huh?
It's empty.
That's weird, hm.
It sounded like someone was in here.
The room's locked. Huh?
What is that?


Chiaki:
You an idiot or what?
My stomach's killing me!

Kousuke:
Come on! It's not that funny.

Makoto:
He's right. You are laughing way too hard!

Chiaki:
For real, it's hilarious.

Makoto:
Is not!

Kousuke:
You wanna go to my dad's clinic for a CT scan?

Makoto:
I'm fine! All right?

Kousuke:
Okay, but take it easy. Could happen again.

Makoto:
It won't!
And if it does, I've got a serious problem.

Chiaki:
He's got a point. It's not normal for someone to just collapse.

Makoto:
Hey, someone else was in that room.

Kousuke:
What do you mean?

Chiaki:
Like who?

Makoto:
Gee! I wonder.

Chiaki:
Do you think I had something to do with it?

Makoto:
Maybe not!

Kousuke:
So I'm the bad guy suddenly?

Makoto:
Who else could it have been?



3. Bad Afternoon

Chiaki:
Man! It's hot out here!

Kousuke:
Suck it up!
Summer vacation's almost here.

Makoto:
Yeah! Summer vacation!
Hey, the three of us should go some place.

Kousuke:
Like where?

Chiaki:
How about a night game?

Makoto:
We did that last month. That's all you ever wanna do!

Chiaki:
Any better ideas?

Makoto:
What about the beach?

Chiaki:
In this heat?

Makoto:
We can go to a fireworks festival.
And wear our best Yukata.

Chiaki:
Like I own one of those.

Makoto:
Where do you wanna go, Kousuke?

Kousuke:
To the library.

Makoto:
What?

Kousuke:
I'm hitting the books!

Chiaki:
Your brain is gonna melt, if you keep crammin' during this heat wave!

Kousuke:
You guys don't study nearly enough.

Makoto:
It's not like I'm going into pre-med or anything.

Kousuke:
What're you gonna be after grad then?

Makoto:
Huh? Hmm.. A hotel tycoon or maybe an oil baron.

Kousuke:
Uh? Get real! It's nothing to joke about.

Makoto:
Hey, what are you gonna do, Chiaki?

Chiaki:
Who? Me? I don't know. Oww!

Kousuke:
You two gotta start taking life more seriously.

Kousuke:
Going already?

Makoto:
Yup! Just remembered something that mom wanted me to do for her.

Chiaki:
No, no, no, no, no! Don't be a party pooper. You’re leaving me with the nerd.


Makoto:
I guess so. Later!

Chiaki:
Oh, come on, Mako, you're heartless!


Woman:
Let's get going.

Kid:
But the elves are coming out.

Woman:
Good heavens!
Hm? ahww!
Hey! Watch where you're going!

Makoto:
I'm sorry!

If today was like... If today was like any other day, there wouldn't have been any problems.
But.. I'd forgotten today was supposed to be my worst day ever.

Man:
Oh, dear!

Makoto:
You're probably thinking that this can't be happening.
But I'm going to die.
This is my last day.
If I knew this was going to happen, I would have gotten up earlier.
I wouldn't have slept in and I wouldn't have been late.
I would have fried that tempura better and that stupid boy at school wouldn't have been thrown into me.
I thought today was supposed to be a "Nice Day".


Woman:
Hey! Will you watch where you are going?!
So you gonna say something?
The very least you can do is give an aplogy!

Makoto:
Sorry! I'm really sorry!

Woman:
Do you even know why you have eyes in the front of your head? So you can see what's in front of you!
You got that!

Makoto:
Um, yes, I'll try and be more careful.

Woman:
Good grief! You kids these days!

Kid:
Mom, look, the elves are coming out!

Woman:
Huh? Oh, dear, is it that time already?

Makoto:
Huh? What? It can't be! Impossible?



4. Afternoon at the Museum
Woman:
Hello. Miss Yoshiyama.

Kazuko:
Huh?

Guard:
Take it easy. She’ll be right down.

Kazuko:
Makoto!

Makoto:
Auntie! Auntie Witch!
Tell me! Am I alive? I am alive, aren't I?
There's, there's nothing wrong with me, is there?

Kazuko:
Hmm.. Your bangs look a little strange.


Kazuko:
What you experienced was a time leap.

Makoto:
Time leap?!

Kazuko:
You were about to be hit by a train, right?

Makoto:
Yeah?

Kazuko:
Shortly after being thrown from your bike?

Makoto:
Yeah!

Kazuko:
And then when you came to, you'd gone back a few minutes in　time.
（come to: 意識を取り戻す）

Makoto:
Exactly!

Kazuko:
That's what you call a time leap.
You see, time can never be reversed.

Makoto:
Then how did I…?

Kazuko:
Time itself doesn't go back. So it was you that went back in time.
In other words, you leapt through time and returned to the past.

Makoto:
Are you sure?

Kazuko:
Yes. Actually, it's not that unusual.
It happens to a lot of girls around your age.

Makoto:
No way! Trust me. It never happens.

Kazuko:
It happened to me.

Makoto:
What?! Are you serious?

Kazuko:
Yes.
All right, say you sleep in on a Sunday morning and, and you think" I don’t wanna do anything today".
Sound familiar?
Then before you know it, it's already evening.
It comes as quite a shock.
You're like "what happened to my precious Sunday".

Makoto:
I wish you'd take me more seriously.
I'm not joking around here.

Kazuko:
Anyway it's a good thing you're alive.
How about cheering up a bit?



5. I Can Fly!

Mother:
Miyuki?

Miyuki:
Mm-hmm.

Mother:
Would you mind helping me?

Miyuki:
All right.


Kazuko:
"Show me how you did it."

Makoto:
"I can't!"

Kazuko:
"I'm sure, if you get the technique down, you'll be able to do it again. "

Makoto:
"I'm telling you! It's not possible!"

Kazuko:
"But you did actually fly through the air, right, Makoto?"


Miyuki:
Like this?

Mother:
Yup! Tear that off.
What was that? An earthquake?


Miyuki:
No, Sis! Don’t do it! I'm begging you!
I'm sorry! Please forgive me. This is all my fault!
Why are you doing this? Was it because I ate your pudding?

Makoto:
What do you mean?

Miyuki:
I don’t want you to die, Sis!

Makoto:
Nobody's gonna die.

Miyuki:
Where are you going then?

Makoto:
To the store!

Miyuki:
If it's pudding you want, I can go buy it.

Makoto:
Don't worry about it. I'll go.

Miyuki:
Are you mad?

Makoto:
No, I'm not mad.

Miyuki:
You positive?

Makoto:
Not mad! Okay?


Kid:
Watch this!

Kid: Wow, cool!

Makoto:
There's no way! How can you leap back in time? It's definitely not possible.
No chance! At least it's not something I can do.

Boys :
Right! Left! Right! Left! Right! Left!.....

Makoto:
Here I ….go!


Makoto:
What the.. Where am I? Oh, I'm home.
Pudding? My pudding. It's still here.

TV:
It's Tuesday, July twelfth. Today marks the anniversary when Japan adopted standard time..

Mother:
How about that pudding?

Miyuki:
I can eat it?

Father:
I thought it was your sister's.

Mother:
I'm pretty sure she'll be having a bite to eat with her friends.

Miyuki:
I can have it then? Yay!

Makoto:
There is no way you're getting it. This is mine!

Father:
Huh?

Mother:
Makoto? When did you get home?


Makoto:
That hurt!
The pudding! Where is it? It's gone.

Kids:
Did you see that?
Yeah.
What are you talking about?
The jump that girl just did! It was awesome!
You said it! She vanished for a second.
Come on, get real. How could she disappear?
You're such a liar.
It's not a lie. I saw it!

Makoto:
Did I do it? A time leap?


Makoto:
Delicious!
Wait a sec! Hang on! This isn't a dream!
I can leap through time! I can do it!


6. I Can Beat Anyone at Anything

Makoto:
Bye Mom, bye Dad!

Mother:
Have a good day!

Father:
Bye, Makoto.
Huh? What time is it?

Miyuki:
I don't know.

TV:
You're probably wondering why today, July thirteenth, is called "Nice Day", so allow me to explain.


Makoto:
Morning!
Good morning!
Morning'

Old woman:
Good morning.

Makoto:
Good morning.

Kousuke:
Barely made it again. Why not give us some variety and be late for a change.

Chiaki:
Why so early, Kousuke?
Forget to jerk yourself off this morning?

Makoto:
Stop goofing off.
You should try waking up a little earlier like me.

Chiaki:
What are you doing here already?

Kousuke:
Huh?

Makoto:
Yes! I'm all done.


Makoto:
Takase, can we switch groups?

Takase:
Sure, but how come?

Teacher:
Don't panic! Shut off the gas! Takase, put it out!

Takase:
Oh, yeah.

Kato:
Takase, you bonehead! You're gonna pay!

Takase:
I didn't mean to do it.


Yuri:
Hey, I've been thinking about Chiaki..

Makoto:
Hold that thought.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(hold that thought :ちょっと待って)
﻿ I've got a situation I need to take care of.

Student:
How'd she do that?

Yuri:
Hey, uh, you all right, Makoto?


Yuri:
So you going with liberal arts or sciences?
(Native Notes: Informal speech. "So are you going with liberal arts or sciences?" would be more formal.)

Makoto:
I think I might study abroad.

Yuri:
Ah! For real?

Makoto:
Yeah, like on one of those exchange programs.

Yuri:
What are you going on about?
Aren't you the girl who failed remedial English?

Makoto:
Come on. You know the saying, "Time waits for no one."

Chiaki:
Hey, Makoto!

Makoto:
Coming!


Kousuke:
A melon soda and two colas please.

Chiaki:
Tell me again why we’re doing karaoke instead of playing baseball?

Makoto:
We can play baseball after karaoke.

Chiaki:
But then we won't have enough time.
Karaoke's for losers.

Chiaki:
Time waits for no one, not even you.
Not your momma, or your brother. And that's the truth...
Kousuke:
Hello.

Clerk:
You've got five minutes left.

Kousuke:
Right., we'll pack up.

Makoto:
Already?


Kousuke:
A melon soda and two colas please.

Chiaki:
Tell me again why we're doing karaoke instead of playing baseball?
What the hell are you doing?

Makoto:
Nothing!

Chiaki:
Nothing? How would somebody fall like that?
And weren't you just sitting there a second ago...

Makoto:
Drop it! And let's get singing!

Chiaki:
Time waits for no one, not even you.
Not your momma, or your brother. And that's the truth...

Kousuke:
Hello.

Clerk:
You've got five minutes left.

Kousuke:
Okay… ow!

Makoto:
Thanks. We'll leave right way, okay?


Makoto:
Not! Ow...

Chiaki:
Huh? What the hell are you doing?

Makoto:
I fell!

Chiaki:
How could anyone fall like that?
And weren't you just sitting here right a sec..

Makoto:
I'm not done singing yet.
I've got the music in me!

Kousuke:
Um, excuse me, could we get a melon soda, a cola and a ginger ale?

Makoto:
I'm home.

Mother:
What on earth happened to your voice?

Makoto:
We were singing.

Mother:
You must have sung for an awfully long time.

Makoto:
About ten hours.

Mother:
Oh, don’t be ridiculous.

Makoto:
I'm exhausted.
So what's for dinner?

Miyuki:
Chicken and veggie stew.

Makoto:
What? Come on!
Can't we have teppanyaki or something?

Mother:
We had that the day before yesterday.

Makoto:
Oh, I want teppanyaki.

Miyuki:
Quit complaining!
You could have come home earlier and helped out, you know.


Father:
What's the matter?

Makoto:
Me? Nothing.
Wow, this is more like it.
Looks delicious, ho!
(Native Notes: A native speaker would never say "This is more I like it."

Chiaki:
How come you're only catching mine?

Kousuke:
I'm amazed you catch any like that!
Not again!

Chiaki:
How could you know what I'm gonna throw!?

Makoto:
Nothing you can hide from me.
I can predict everything you're gonna do.
I'll beat anyone every single time! A ha ha ha.!

Kids
What's up with that loony?
I just hope she's not contagious.



7. Best Luck

Kazuko:
Hmm, look at these pastries!
You've gone all out.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(go all out: :大枚をはたく。全力をつくす。)
﻿
Makoto:
Forget about it. Just my way of saying thanks for all the advice.
Even if I spend my entire allowance..., ah, all I have to do is leap back to allowance day.
Then I get all my spending money again.
I can go back and forth any way I like.
I can sleep in after the alarm goes off, twice if I want.
If I forget something, I don't have to go back to get it.
There's no more time limits at all-you-can-eat restaurants.
Oh, and if you forget to tape a soap opera, just ask me!

Kazuko:
Thank goodness.

Makoto:
No problem.

Kazuko:
I'm glad to hear you're not using it for anything significant.

Makoto:
Come on! This changes everything. Let me tell ya.
Leaping back and forth through time is amazing.
I can't get enough of it.
It's such a blast. My stomach's killing me by the end of the day.

Kazuko:
Ever think that someone might be suffering from your good fortune?

Makoto:
Huh? You think so?

Kazuko:
Who knows? Yum!

Makoto:
Nobody's suffering! Everything will be all right.
No matter what happens, I mean, I can always go back and do things over as many times as I want!


Sekimi:
Look, today is perfect! If you blow this chance, you’ll have to wait another year.

Moriko:
You did decide you were gonna tell him today, right?

Kaho:
Yeah…

Moriko:
You've gotta give it a good crack.

Sekimi:
Crack it? And then what?

Moriko:
Senior!

Chiaki:
Who? Me?

Moriko:
No!

Kaho:
Umm, hi. Um.

Moriko:
Kaho!

Makoto:
We'll go on ahead.

Kousuke:
All right.

Chiaki:
Who're those girls?

Makoto:
Never mind! Let's just go.

Chiaki:
Jeez, lose the girly throw. 　Use your shoulder this time.

Makoto:
Huh?

Kousuke:
I made it.

Chiaki:
Took you long enough.

Kousuke:
Sorry.

Makoto:
So?

Kousuke:
What? Those girls, you mean? They're just juniors from the volunteer club.

Makoto:
Right! So what's up with them?

Kousuke:
Not much. They wanted to know if I was going out with YOU.

Makoto:
What?! We are not going out.

Kousuke:
Yeah, that's what I told them.

Makoto:
And anything else?

Kousuke:
One of 'em has a crush or something.
She asked me to go out with her.

Makoto:
Way to go!

Chiaki:
Are you serious?

Makoto:
So what'd you say?

Kousuke:
Turned her down.

Makoto:
Ah, meany!

Kousuke:
Take it easy.

Makoto:
That took guts to ask you out.

Chiaki:
Why did you turn her down, man?
I'd totally be jonesin' for that chick.
(jones for: 〈俗〉～が欲しくてたまらない)
Kousuke:
Yeah, big surprise.

Makoto:
Besides she looks like that girl you were in love with back in junior high.

Kousuke:
What?! She does not! Oh!
