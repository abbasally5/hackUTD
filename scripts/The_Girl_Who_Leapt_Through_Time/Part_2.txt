8. Fork in the Road

Chiaki:
Don't come crying to me when you change your mind too late about dating that girl.

Kousuke:
Can we please just drop it now?

Makoto:
See ya.

Kousuke:
Later.

Chiaki:
Hey, where's your bike?

Makoto:
Something happened to it.

Chiaki:
Get on, I'll double ya.

Makoto:
You'll take me home? Sweet!


Makoto:
You honestly think Kousuke wasn't interested?

Chiaki:
Probably. The guy usually means what he says.

Makoto:
I'm kinda glad actually.

Chiaki:
Why's that?

Makoto:
If he gets a girlfriend, he'll treat her special, I bet.

Chiaki:
Yeah, that'd be him alright.

Makoto:
Then we couldn't play baseball any more.

Chiaki:
Yeah, you got a point.
Playing catch doesn't exactly count as baseball.

Makoto:
It's just..., I don't know.
I kind of felt that somehow the three of us would always be together.
Kousuke would tell us off for being late. (tell off: 叱る)
You'd ride me for not being able to catch the ball. (ride:からかう)

Chiaki:
Makoto?

Makoto:
Hm?

Chiaki:
What do you say? Wanna go out?

Makoto:
Stop! Stop for a second!　What was that?

Chiaki:
U, um..

Makoto:
Why'd you say that?

Chiaki:
Well. I …

Makoto:
Where's that coming from suddenly?

Chiaki:
You were wondering what it would be like if Kousuke got a girl friend?
I mean.. I'm not ugly, am I?

Makoto:
You serious?

Chiaki:
Dead.

Makoto:
Oh, hang on! Wait a minute, will ya?

Chiaki:
What is it this time? Can we just go?　Huh? Er, Makoto?


Chiaki:
Um, what the hell are you doing down there?

Makoto:
Nothing at all!

Chiaki:
Don't come crying to me when you change your mind too late about dating that girl.

Kousuke:
Can we please just drop it now?

Chiaki:
See ya.

Kousuke:
Later.

Chiaki:
Hey, where's your bike?
Get on, I'll double ya.


Chiaki:
That loser, Kousuke beat me to it.

Makoto:
It's not as if he decided to go out with her.
(it's not as if　:～というわけじゃない)
Chiaki:
That's what he says now but I bet if he got a girlfriend, he'd always pick her over us.

Makoto:
You can't be sure about that.

Chiaki:
Oh, man, without Kousuke, we'd only be able to toss the ball around.

Makoto:
Why don't you give the poor guy some credit and deal with it if and when Kousuke does start seeing the girl?

Chiaki:
Well, there's not much we can do if it happens.
Anyway, how about you go out with me?

Makoto:
Like I said why are we talking about this?


Chiaki:
That's what he says now but I bet if he got a girlfriend, he'd always pick her over us.

Makoto:
Hey, did I ever tell you what a total idiot my little sister is?

Chiaki:
Uh, I was talking about Kousuke, in case you didn't notice.
(俺はKousukeの話をしてんだよ、気付いてなかったなら一応言っとくけどな。)

Makoto:
Forget him! Let's talk about my sister.

Chiaki:
So anyway if Kousuke finds a girlfriend..

Makoto:
Let me tell you about my sister!

Chiaki:
You want to go out with me!?


Chiaki:
Don't come crying to me when you change your mind too late about dating that girl.

Kousuke:
Can we please just drop it now?

Chiaki:
Uh, Makoto, I'll take you home.

Makoto:
No thanks.

Chiaki:
Yo! What's the matter?

Kousuke:
What's her problem?

Chiaki:
That's all your fault!

Kousuke:
Oh! I didn't do anything!


Kazuko:
I thought that you liked Chiaki.
Didn't you feel obligated to stick with him to help keep him in line?
（stick with ~: ～とずっと一緒にいる） (keep ~ in line: ～をキチンとさせる)
Makoto:
I might have said something like that before.

Kazuko:
What's the point of pretending he never asked?
Why not go out with him?

Makoto:
No way! Not happening!

Kazuko:
How come?

Makoto:
I can't picture Chiaki and I being anything more than friends.
That's how come.

Kazuko:
If it doesn't work out, go back to the way things were.
You're mature enough to handle that.

Makoto:
Thanks, but no thanks.

Kazuko:
Sometimes these things start off one-sided and the person grows on you.
(grow on: 関心が次第に大きくなってくる)
Makoto:
It won't happen! Never!

Kazuko:
I see. So you're gonna act like it never happened.
I feel sorry for Chiaki.
After he worked up the courage, oh, then again I suppose he wouldn't even know that he did.



9. Incident during Recess

Yuri:
Hey, er, you know how Chiaki transferred to our school this spring?
I heard he'd been bouncing around from school to school before that.

Makoto:
Apparently.

Yuri:
You think the rumors about him moving overseas are true?

Makoto:
I doubt it. He sucks at languages.

Yuri:
No, huh?

Makoto:
No chance.

Yuri:
I wonder if something happened to him at his last school.

Makoto:
Why don't you ask him?

Yuri:
I don't even have his email address.

Makoto:
So? He's in our class.

Yuri:
Yeah, I know, but you're such good friends with him.

Makoto:
I wouldn't ask him something like that.
Besides I wouldn't say we're that close.

Yuri:
Liar!

Makoto:
I'm not! I mean...

Takase:
Ughhh! Ohoo!

Kato:
Yeah! It's revenge, man!

Takase:
Stop!

Kato:
Oh, yeah! You're a loser, man!

Yuri:
They're getting revenge!

Makoto:
Leave him alone!

Kato:
How about a nice shower, you stink!
Look at a little xxx xxxing dumb!
(Native Notes: I can’t hear this.)

Boys:
Hey, who shut it off?　It's Mamiya.

Chiaki:
You about done?
(Native Notes: Informal speech. "are" is unnecessary.)

Boys:
Not over, Takase!
Later, loser!

Chiaki:
That's pretty bad.
You're totally soaked.

Yuri:
Are you all right, Takase?

Takase:
They threw a cola on me yesterday.
Although I did manage to throw a latte back at them.

Yuri:
You know, you're only making it worse, doing that, right?

Chiaki:
Hey, Makoto! Did you watch the night game last night?
That Saito sure put the squeeze on, huh?
Why'd you look away from me?

Makoto:
I didn't look away.

Chiaki:
What are you up to?

Makoto:
Nothing!

Chiaki:
What's going on? Something juicy?
Come on! Tell me.

Makoto:
I told you it's nothing!

Chiaki:
Huh.., What's the matter?

Takase:
Konno, you jerk!

Makoto:
Huh?

Takase:
Why did you ask me to fry that tempura in the home ec. class the other day!
(home ec. class = home economics class)
Makoto:
Um, well, I never thought something like that would happen.

Takase:
This is all your fault, idiot!

Chiaki:
Who are you calling an idiot?
Keep it up and I'll throw this!

Makoto:
No! Don't, Chiaki!

Takase:
Yeah! I dare you! Oh!
(I dare you:できるんならやってみろ）
Chiaki:
Ooh, I didn't mean to do that.

Takase:
Stupid!

Chiaki:
That guy's pretty rude, going around calling everyone names.
(call ~ names: ~の悪口をいう)
Makoto:
So? You're always calling me an idiot.
(Native Notes: So? = だから何？)

Chiaki:
Yeah, but I say it out of love.
Come on! Where's your comeback?
You're leaving me in the cold here.
She's acting weird, don't you think, Hayakawa?

Yuri:
Oh, uh, yes indeed.

Chiaki:
Why the stiff talks?

Yuri:
Sorry, it's just that I haven't spoken to you much before.


Chiaki:
Makoto!

Kousuke:
She's not here!

Chiaki:
But she always meets us here.

Kousuke:
Did something happen?

Chiaki:
Huh? No, no nothing at all!

Kousuke:
You must have said something that pissed her off.
You better not have said she has big feet.
You know, she's self-conscious.

Chiaki:
I didn't say anything! I didn't!
I don't think I did.

Kousuke:
Toss it back!

Chiaki:
I can't throw good when I'm thinking.
It's no use. I just don't get it.

10. What's Going On?

Makoto:
Oh, it's Yuri.
"Something really great happened today"
I wonder what?

Miyuki:
Hello. Oh, hi, yeah. Hang on.
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.

Makoto:
I wonder what her news was?


Makoto:
Hurry up. Let's go, before they sell out!
Yuri:
Actually I'm not feeling all that well today.

Makoto:
Wanna go to the nurse's office?

Yuri:
Oh, um, no thanks. I'll be fine.

Students:
Come on. Hurry! This is gonna be good!
Come on, come on, man!
That's over here! This way, this way!

Kato:
Knock it off, Takase!

Takase:
Why should I listen to you!
You didn't stop when I asked you to!

Kato:
All right, I admit, we were wrong, OK?!

Takase:
Then you shouldn't have done it to me, [you silly ass!]
(Native Notes: I can't understand the end.)

Students:
Jeez, that guy's lost it.
Anyone call a teacher?
(Native Notes: Informal speech. "Did anyone call a teacher?" would be more formal.)
Come and see this!

Makoto:
Put it down, Takase! Takase!

Takase:
Konno! Did you just give me an order!?

Makoto:
No, it wasn't like that.

Takase:
Yes, you did!
Why? Damn it! Why it won't work!

Student:
Don't do it, Takase!

Chiaki:
Takase!

Makoto:
Chiaki..., Chiaki!

Students:
Are you okay? Yuri!
That hit her big time.
What grade is she in?
Someone, call a teacher!

Takase:
It wasn't my fault! It wasn't! I swear!


Nurse:
Now, don't cry. It's not that bad.

Yuri:
What if it leaves a scar?

Makoto:
If it does, I'll deal with it somehow.

Yuri:
How are you gonna do that?

Makoto:
I'll handle it, okay?

Nurse:
No boy's in here please.

Chiaki:
Does it hurt?

Yuri:
Yeah.

Chiaki:
Let's see.

Yuri:
No!

Chiaki:
Come on.

Yuri:
Thanks.


Chiaki:
I'm sorry, seriously.

Makoto:
Um, but why?

Chiaki:
I said I'm sorry, really!

Kousuke:
Oh, give me a break.
I mean who takes a girl to a night game on their first date?

Makoto:
Yeah, I thought you said that the three of us were going together.
I was looking forward to it!

Chiaki:
How many times do I have to say sorry?
Hayakawa said a night game would work for her.

Kouske:
You're gonna date her?

Chiaki:
You know it.

Makoto:
Ooh!

Kousuke:
Oh, you all right?
(Native Notes: Informal speech. "are" is unnecessary.)

Makoto:
You serious?

Chiaki:
Yeah, something wrong with that?
What can I say? Yuri gets me.
You know what I mean?

Makoto:
How nice for you.

Chiaki:
Jeez, you idiot, stubborn [and xxx / aiming first]!
(Native Notes: I can't hear.)

Father:
I'm home.
Huh? Where's the rice?

Mother:
I'm making some more.

Father:
Why?

Miyuki:
Makoto ate the whole batch herself.


Makoto:
What's wrong with him?
First he said he liked me, now he’s going out with her?

I almost drowned!
Huh? What is this thing? Ninety




11. Guidance Counseling

Kousuke:
Hey, Makoto!

Makoto:
Ah, let me go!

Sekimi:
I think we lost this one.

Moriko:
She's putting us to shame. That's for sure.

Sekimi:
The world is full of deceit.

Kaho:
Aww!


Kousuke:
Sucks not having Chiaki here.
Let's make sure we get him here tomorrow.

Makoto:
That wouldn't be fair to Yuri.

Kousuke:
How about I say that you miss him.
Bet he'd come then.

Makoto:
Who said I miss him?

Kousuke:
Oh, please.
He only went with Hayakawa, 'cause you turned him down.

Makoto:
What? I did not!

Kousuke:
Really?

Makoto:
What's that supposed to mean?

Kousuke:
Oh, brother!

Makoto:
So what's the deal with you? Why don’t you find a girl?

Kousuke:
'Cause if I did start going out with someone, then you'd end up alone.

Makoto:
Huh?


Kazuko:
I thought you had a thingfor Kousuke.
He’s the one who always helps when you are having problems, right?

Makoto:
Kousuke's there for everyone.

Kazuko:
Why don’t you go out with him?

Makoto:
Why would you even suggest that?

Kazuko:
Like I said before if it doesn’t work out, you can always go back to how it was.

Makoto:
No way. I would never do it.

Kazuko:
Why is that?

Makoto:
`Cause it'd be like toying with a person's feelings.

Kazuko:
And you couldn't possibly do such a terrible thing?
Since you started going back into the past, you haven't exactly shown restraint.
You've played all sorts of mind games with people.

Makoto:
What!? Is that how you see it?

Kazuko:
More or less.

Makoto:
She's a witch. I knew it. She really is my Auntie Witch.


Makoto:
Hey, this painting!

Kazuko:
Do you recognize it?

Makoto:
Yeah, I do.
It's the one you've been restoring for so long.

Kazuko:
It's a strange painting. The longer you look at it, the more relaxed and comforted you feel.

Makoto:
Huh?

Kazuko:
I don’t know who the painter is and I still don’t really know whether it's a worthy piece of art, but there is one thing I did learn while working on its restoration.
This piece was painted during a historical period of famine and war many centuries ago.

Makoto:
Oh?

Kazuko:
I wonder how someone was able to create such a beautiful painting when it must have seemed that the world was coming to an end.


Mr. Fukushima:
What are you gonna do Kono? You're the only one who hasn't chosen your academic major.　Konno, Konno, Konno!

Makoto:
Yes!

Mr. Fukushima:
Don't get all cocky on me just 'cause you got a good mark on the math quiz.

Makoto:
I won't.

12. Volunteer Club

Makoto:
Uh, that's so weird. I swear it said ninety last time I saw it.
Huh?

Moriko:
Why don't we ask her ourselves?

Kaho:
I don't know.

Makoto:
Ask what?

Kaho:
Wait! Hang on a second!

Makoto:
Whoa! What's this about?

Moriko:
Makoto Konno, we are members of the Volunteer Club and we have...

Sekimi:
And there's something we'd like to ask you!

Kaho:
Never mind. It's nothing.

Moriko:
We have noticed something about you lately.

Sekimi:
You're always with Kousuke.

Kaho:
Forget it. Let's go. Stop! Please.

Makoto:
Uh-huh.

Moriko:
So are you two going steady then? 　Or are you going out with him?

Sekimi:
Are you going out with Kouske?

 Sekimi:
Are you going out with him?


Kaho:
I was still in junior high at the time.
But apparently some students from the volunteer club at Kuranose senior high had gone to visit the retirement home where my grandmother lived.
Grandma was especially impressed with one of the students and she spoke to me about him many times.
She would go on and on about what a kind and gentle boy he was.
She said it over and over.
This might sound strange but she talked so much about him that I began to kind of fall in love, even though I'd never met him.

Makoto:
That's a sweet story.

Kaho:
I found out when I got into senior high that that student's name was Kousuke Tsuda.

Makoto:
Wow, things like that really do happen!

Moriko:
The problem is that Kaho's shy. She's afraid of her own shadow.

Sekimi:
We've been working to drum up her courage.

Moriko:
And finally, finally we got her to tell Kousuke she's got a crush on him.

Makoto:
Oh, you mean the other day?

Sekimi:
But according to Kousuke...

Makoto:
Um, huh?

Moriko:
"I've already given my heart to someone."

Sekimi:
"I'm sorry but I cannot go out with you."

Makoto:
No, wait! Um...

Sekimi:
That's not really how it went.

Moriko:
"How could a bonehead like that get a higher mark than I did?"

Sekimi:
"I've gotta stop slacking off so much, sorry."
（ slack off：なまける）
Kaho:
So he apologized and turned me down.

Makoto:
Who's that bonehead he was talking about?
Is it me?

Moriko:
And that's when Kousuke told us.

Sekimi:
He said that he wasn't going out with you but I'm not sure we believe him.

Moriko:
So how about explaining what's going on then.

Sekimi:
Something doesn't seem right, if you ask me.


Time you gave us an explanation!

Makoto:
Hang on a minute! Okay, you made your point already.
Ahem! I'll deal with this somehow.

Moriko & Sekimi:
Deal with this?!

Kaho:
What do you mean, somehow?

Makoto:
Just trust me!


Kaho:
Umm, hi. Um...

Moriko:
Kaho!

Kaho:
Um, I..

Makoto:
Kousuke!

Kousuke:
Uh-huh. Wo! Where'd you come from?
Didn't you just head off to the baseball field a second ago?

Makoto:
Never mind that!
This girl here was saying that her grandmother was so grateful about you coming around and taking care of her at her retirement home.
I'm impressed, Kousuke. So anyway...

Kaho:
Aaa, how do you know all that stuff about my grandmother?

Makoto:
Who? Me?
I met her at the bowling alley.

Kaho:
But my grandmother's bedridden.

Makoto:
Oh, um, my mistake.

Kousuke:
Let me know when you're done gabbing.
(Native Notes: Not "gabbling" but "gabbing." )

Makoto:
Ah, no! Hang on, Kousuke!


Makoto: 
One more time!

Kaho:
Um.., well..
Makoto:
Kousuke!

Kousuke:
Uh-huh.

Makoto:
Hold on.

Kousuke:
Wow! Where did you come from?
Didn't you just head off to the...

Makoto:
Hold it!
You're being such a coward.
What's the point of getting all sulky just 'cause I got a better mark!
This has nothing to do with that!

Kousuke:
What's your problem? Showing up, bragging your head off.
(one's head off：過度に、非常に)
And what has nothing to do with what?

Makoto:
I'm saying that the test scores and the fact that Kaho's in love with you have nothing to do with each other.

Kaho:
Ahaa, it's not true! It's not true!

Makoto:
Wait! Kaho!

Kousuke:
Well, you heard what the girl said.

Makoto:
Ah, don't go Kousuke!


Makoto:
I've got to take a simpler approach to this.

Miyuki:
What's with all the commotion? The day's just getting started.

Makoto:
I went back too far and I'm late again!

Mother:
Makoto, the peaches. The peaches!


Kousuke:
Huh? Unbelievable!


Students:
Now, for the headlock!
Huh? What was that?
Amazing!

Makoto:
Quit staring! Just carry on!
Could you move? I need the spot.


Student:
Kaho!

Kaho:
Huh?

Student:
I don't know exactly why, but someone wants you to come down to the courtyard.

Kaho:
Who does?

Kousuke:
Tell me where we're going. What are you gonna make me do?

Makoto:
You'll know when we get there.

Yuri:
Makoto?

Makoto:
Later!

Student:
Okay, you got me.

Moriko:
You think this is what she meant by the courtyard?

Sekimi:
Who knows?

Makoto:
Stand there!

Kousuke:
What the hell is your problem? Get off!

Kaho:
You're hurting me.

Kousuke:
Sorry! Can you get up?

Kaho:
Yeah..., ah!

Kousuke:
I think you sprained it.

Kaho:
No, it's okay.

Kousuke:
Please, there's nothing okay about it.

Kaho:
Kousuke, what are you doing?

Kousuke:
Put your arm around me.

Kaho:
Oh, thank you.

Sekimi:
What do you think of this new development?

Moriko:
This just might be the start of something.

 Moriko:
The start of something beautiful.

Makoto:
All right!
Everything's good again, thanks to yours truly.
I can't remember the last time I felt so happy!

Huh? It's changed.
Ten? What's that mean?
(Native Notes: Informal speech. "What does that mean?" would be more formal.)
Huh? Mm..

One...?

13. Borrowing the Bicycle

Makoto:
Not here. Maybe I got here a little too early.
Huh? There he is!

Um, excuse me. I have a question for you..., Yuri!?

Yuri:
You scared the life out of me! (scare the life out of:　死ぬほど驚かせる)

Makoto:
How come you're here?

Yuri:
I brought the notebooks up for you.
You forgot you were on duty today, I bet.

Makoto:
Oh, right!

Yuri:
I figured as much. (I figured as much: だろうと思った)
I hope you appreciate our friendship here.
So, what's your question?

Makoto:
Oh, um, nothing forget it!

Yuri:
Okay.

Makoto:
Hey, Yuri.

Yuri:
Yeah?

Makoto:
Did you see anyone on your way up here?

Yuri:
Like who?

Makoto:
Err, never mind.

Yuri:
All right.

Makoto:
It's from Kousuke.
"She just asked me out. Jealous?"
Whatever! Who do you think set it up for you in the first place?
Oh, no!


Kousuke:
Ma..., Ko..., To, there!
Where do you live?

Kaho:
On the south side, right past the station.

Kousuke:
We should get my dad to check out your ankle.
Our clinic isn't far from here.


Yuri:
Come to think of it, I did actually pass someone on my way up here.
It was Chiaki.

Makoto:
Kousuke!

Students:
He went home.
Yeah, holding hands with that first-year girl.

Makoto:
It's gone.
Answer the phone!

Kousuke:
Yeah, it's me, dad. I have, er, got a sprained ankle for you.
Think maybe you can take a look at it? No, it's not me.
Yeah, sure, we'll be right there.

Kaho:
Thanks for all this.


Answering message:
"Please leave a message after the beep."

Makoto:
Damn!
What now, should I go back in time? Then again it's not like anything's happened yet.


Makoto:
Um, excuse me, you wouldn't know if there was a bike accident here?

Woman:
Er, no, I,I don't think so,

Makoto:
Okay, thanks.

Woman:
An accident, she said. How scary.

Makoto:
Huh? Kousuke!? Where are you? Kousuke!
