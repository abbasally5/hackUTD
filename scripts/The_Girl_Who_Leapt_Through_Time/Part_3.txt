14. Railroad Crossing
Makoto:
Chiaki...

Chiaki:
Kousuke is over at his place.
Hey, er, what's the deal? You guys didn't show up at the field.

Makoto:
Sorry.

Chiaki:
I'm still waiting!

Makoto:
Wait a sec.

Chiaki:
Yeah.

Makoto:
Chiaki, There's something I've wanting to ask you for a while now.
Do you have fun, playing ball with me?

Chiaki:
What are you talking about?

Makoto:
I mean I have a lot of fun playing baseball with you.

Chiaki:
You sure suck for someone who likes it so much.

Makoto:
You’d suck too if enthusiasm didn't count.

Chiaki:
That's better than nothing.


Chiaki:
What's so funny?

Makoto:
It's nice talking to you. Feels like it's been ages.

Chiaki:
What are you talking about? We've been talking all day.

Makoto:
Oh, right! Yeah, I guess.

Chiaki:
You miss me that much, huh?

Makoto:
Don't be so stupid.

Chiaki:
I'm kidding, kidding! Calm down!
Actually, Makoto, there's something I've been meaning to ask you as well.

Makoto:
Oh, yeah?

Chiaki:
You're gonna think this is seriously wacked.

Makoto:
So what is it?

Chiaki:
Well...

Makoto:
Come on, spit it out.

Chiaki:
Have you been... time leaping?
You've been time leaping, right?
Hey, Makoto, Makoto!


Chiaki:
Actually, Makoto, there's something I've been meaning to ask you as well.
You're gonna think this is seriously wacked.　Well...

Makoto:
No, wait, hang on a second. Let's talk about my little sister!

Chiaki:
Huh? why?

Makoto:
'Cause, oh, man, is my sister ever stupid!

Chiaki:
Hello? I was talking here... Ne, never mind.
I'll be waiting here for you.

Makoto:
How does Chiaki know about it?
Huh? Zero?
So these digits did represent the number of times I could leap.
I wasted my last one on something so lame.
Oh well, no biggie. Kousuke wasn't hurt and that’s what really counts.

Kousuke:
Hey, Makoto!

I need to borrow your bike a bit longer!

Makoto:
Wait! Kousuke, no, stop!

Woman:
Honestly! Watch where you're going! Apologize at once! Hey!
Honestly! 【間投詞】（略式）［怒り・不信などを表して］いやはや，まったく，本当に，正直言って

Makoto:
Stop, Kousuke! Kousuke!
Wait! Kousuke, stop!

Kousuke, Kousuke, ughr, Kousuke, Kousukeee!

Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stooooop!


Makoto:
What's going on?

Chiaki:
I knew it was you.

Makoto:
Chiaki?! What are you.. doing here? Where's Kousuke?

Chiaki:
Probably he's still at home.

Makoto:
What? But he was just here.
Wait! Did... you do this? You can time leap too, Chiaki?

Chiaki:
Would you... would you laugh if I told you I came from the future?


15. Two

Chiaki:
In my time, a device is developed that allows people to travel through time whenever they want.
This is it here. You use it to charge your body.
That's how I came to this era - with this device.
I didn't realize it at first, but somewhere along the way I lost it.
I panicked. I looked everywhere and eventually I found it... ,in the science lab.
But by then it was already used up.
It wasn't all bad news. It was charged to an idiot.
I had trouble sleeping, thinking it might fall into the wrong hands.

Makoto:
Why did you come here?

Chiaki:
'Cause I had to.

Makoto:
Why though?

Chiaki:
There was a painting I desperately wanted to see.
No matter how far away it was.
Or what sort of place it was in.
No matter how dangerous.
I wanted to see it.
Unfortunately in my time, the painting had already been destroyed.
And before these times, its whereabouts was unknown.
The only place where there was an accurate record of it was in this present era, in this place. It was here, in this season.

Makoto:
And so you came all... this way?

Chiaki:
All I needed was to see it. I was going to remember it for the rest of my life.
Anyway I guess there's no point now...to anything.

Makoto:
Um.,　You can't return? What's that supposed to mean?

Chiaki:
It means just that. I can't go back to my time.

Makoto:
I know but why?

Chiaki:
Because having to steal your bike that Kousuke was supposed to ride used up all the time leaps that I had left.

Makoto:
What'll you do?

Chiaki:
There's nothing I can do.
Makoto:
Why would you use it up for that!?
Didn't you think to save it for when you really needed it?

Chiaki:
I did save it for something important.
You probably haven't fully realized it yet, Makoto.
But Kousuke and that girl did die once at that train crossing.
A certain someone was sobbing and blaming herself for it, so it was the only choice I really had.
I was supposed to go home.
But before I knew it, summer was already here.
I couldn't help it. Being with you guys was so much fun.
I saw a river flow across the land for the first time. I rode a bike for the first time.
I discovered just how enormous the sky is.
And more than any thing, I'd never seen a place with so many people.

Makoto:
Hey, Chiaki, I was wondering, is there some kind of connection between that painting and the future? Where you come from, I mean.
Please tell me. Is there?

Chiaki:
I really like this era. You have baseball.

Makoto:
Huh, baseball disappears? For real?

Chiaki:
Over here, stupid.

Makoto:
Huh? Um, stop messing around.
That painting.

Chiaki:
Huh?

Makoto:
That painting!

Chiaki
Yeah.

Makoto:
It's not there now but you'll be able to see it soon.
It's getting restored.
That's why it's not there.
How about the three of us go? You, me, and Kousuke.
Especially now that summer vacation's about to start.
What do you say, Chiaki? Chiaki?

Chiaki:
Sorry, I can't.

Makoto:
Ah!

Chiaki:
As of tomorrow I won't be here.

Makoto:
How come?

Chiaki:
I'm not supposed to let the people who live in the past know about time leaps.
I broke that rule. That's why.
I won't be able to see you again.

Makoto:
I'll keep my mouth shut. I promise I won't tell anyone.
Chiaki, where are you? Hey, Chiaki. Chiaki, Chiaki, you said we'd go to a night game together!

Chiaki:
Sorry.

Makoto:
And that we'd go to see a fireworks festival.

Chiaki:
I'm really sorry.

Makoto:
So this means you don't wanna see me in a yukata?

Chiaki:
Sorry, I'd like to have seen that.

Makoto:
Jerk! Chiaki?! Chiaki! Chiaki! Wait! Chiaki!


16. Til Tomorrow

Female students:
Why is Chiaki quitting school?

Apparently he was in debt and the mob was after him.

Is that true?

It's not something like his parents getting a divorce?

Well, I heard he's marrying an older woman, 'cause he got her pregnant.

Oh,what? Seriously? That's crazy.

So what's the story, Makoto?

Kousuke:
I'm telling you he's not that kind of guy!

Male students:
I heard he lost it and stabbed some guy.
(lost it = 気が変になった)
I heard he beat him up with a baseball bat.

No! He took a knife and stabbed him.

Kousuke:
I told you he's not like that!

Male students:
Hey, Kousuke!

Hey, come on. Come back!

What's his problem?

Kousuke:
What the hell happened to him?
It's one thing not to tell me, but he could have at least talked to you about it.
I mean considering he had a thing for you.

Makoto:
Didn't Chiaki say that?

Kousuke:
I thought it was obvious. Didn't you notice?
Well, you're awkward with stuff like that.
Maybe that's why he couldn't come out with it.

Makoto:
Kousuke… 
Kousuke:
Yeah?

Makoto:
I'm a horrible person.
He wanted to tell me something important but I pretended the conversation never happened.
Why didn't I take what he said more seriously?

Kousuke:
Makoto, what are you talking about? Ah, wait!


Kazuko:
Feel any better?
You know what? I honestly thought you were just friends with both Kousuke and Chiaki.
To tell you the truth, I figured you would graduate without dating either one of them and you'd end up going out with someone else entirely.

Makoto:
That's what I thought too, until yesterday.

Makoto:
Why?

Kazuko:
I don't know. Bad timing, I guess.

Makoto:
What's he doing now?

Kazuko:
I couldn't tell you.
He promised to come back for me.
I wasn't planning to wait for him. But… anyway so many years have passed now.
It didn't seem very long. Time flew by fast. But Makoto…

Makoto:
Huh?

Kazuko:
You're different. You're nothing like me at all, are you?
If a boy is late in meeting up with you, you're the type to go look for him.


17. Zero-One

Father:
Makoto, watermelon!

Mother:
Leave her, dear.

Father:
What's up with her? Not coming down for dinner, no watermelon.

Miyuki:
She's heartbroken. That's what.

Father:
You're kidding!

Mother:
Miyuki, cut it out! It's none of your business.

Kazuko:
"If a boy is late in meeting up with you, you're the type to go look for him."

Makoto:
Huh? Ah! No way!
It was zero before. It can't be.

Mother:
Makoto?

Miyuki:
Sis!

Father:
Hey, take it easy, Makoto! Makoto!

Makoto:
Chiaki time-leapt in order to save Kousuke, so I got my last one back.
If I can go back far enough, he should get his back too.

Woman:
Oh, Makoto!

Makoto:
I'm almost positive!

Gooooo!


Mr.Fukushima:
"Settle down, kids. Quiet now."

Chiaki:
"Huh, who are you?"

Kousuke:
"I'm Kousuke Tsuda and this is Makoto Konno."

Chiaki:
"Konno?"

Mr.Fukushima:
"He looks a bit rough? But I hope you all get along."

Kousuke:
"Makoto, over here!"

Chiaki:
"See you, Makoto."

Kousuke:
"Hey, did you hear that? He called you by your first name."

Chiaki:
"Makoto, what do you say? Wanna go out?"
"You were wondering what it’d be like if Kousuke got a girlfriend."
"I mean... I'm not ugly, am I?"


Yuri:
Um, Makoto, are you okay?


18. Run Looking forward

Yuri:
I wonder what Chiaki does on the weekends and stuff?
I'm sure he doesn't play baseball all the time.

Makoto:
Yuri …

Yuri:
Huh?

Makoto:
There's something I haven't been able to tell you.

Yuri:
Yeah, what is it?

Makoto:
It's Chiaki. I really like him, a lot. I'm sorry.

Yuri:
I see. I kinda thought so.
I bumped into Chiaki on my way here. You should go to him.

Makoto:
Hmm.

Yuri:
Makoto…,time waits for no one.

Kousuke:
Makoto!

Makoto:
Kousuke. Where's Chiaki?

Kousuke:
He got tired of waiting and went ahead to the field. He's pretty cranky.
We'd better hurry.

Makoto:
You sure you wanna leave your girlfriend alone? After all I did ….

Kousuke:
What do you mean, "girlfriend?"

Makoto:
Oh, right! It's all gone back to before.

Kousuke:
What are you mumbling to yourself about?

Makoto:
Um, nothing!
Uh?

Kousuke:
Huh?

Makoto:
Hey, why don't we invite them to play ball with us?

Kousuke:
What?! You serious?

Makoto:
Go and ask them.

Kousuke:
Yeah, why should I?

Makoto:
The more the merrier, right?

Kousuke:
Yeah, sure, but come on. Do you even know 'em?

Makoto:
Kind of. Hey, that reminds me.

Kousuke:
Huh?

Makoto:
Borrow my bike and it'll cost you five thousand yen.

Kousuke:
What?

Makoto:
You got that? Five thousand yen!

Kousuke:
Hang on!What's this all about, anyway?

Makoto:
Ask them nicely. "Would you like to play ball with us?" like that.
One more thing.

Kousuke:
Huh?

Makoto:
Thanks for waiting for me!

Kousuke:
Hey, Makoto!

Makoto:
What?

Kousuke:
Watch where you're going!

Makoto:
Sure!


19. Jet Stream

Chiaki:
You're late. Where's Kousuke?

Makoto:
Not coming.

Chiaki:
Huh? what d'you mean, he's not coming?
Where'd you find that?
I mean do you even know what it is?

Makoto:
Yeah, I know what it is.

Chiaki:
Who told you?

Makoto:
You did.

Chiaki:
Give me a break. I did not.
I never told you about it.

Makoto:
Actually you told me everything.
About how you came here from the future and what this thing does. Everything.

Chiaki:
Ah!

Makoto:
I thought so. Thank goodness.

Chiaki:
Where did you come from?

Makoto:
I came from the future.

Chiaki:
Can you time leap?

Makoto:
I could, but not any more.

Chiaki:
Did I actually tell you all that?

Makoto:
Yup!

Chiaki:
And you believed me?

Makoto:
Mm-hm.

Chiaki:
What an idiot.

Makoto:
Yeah, maybe.

Chiaki:
So you came all the way back to tell me that.

Makoto:
Yeah.

Chiaki:
Why would I tell you? How could I be so stupid?

Makoto:
When you go back to the future, enjoy that painting.
It's not gonna get lost or burned.
I'll figure out a way to make sure it's preserved for the future.

Chiaki:
Thanks, I'd appreciate that.
I was supposed to go back right after I got here, but all of a sudden it was summer.
Time sorta just flew by, 'cause you guys were so much fun.

Makoto:
Yeah, but that's not all you said.

Chiaki:
Then what'd I say?

Makoto:
Not telling.

Chiaki:
Come on! Why not?
I'm serious. You gotta tell me what I said.

Makoto:
I'm not telling.

Chiaki:
You have to tell me. Don't leave me in the dark. Come on.

Kids:
Ah, look at the lovers! You're in love!
I love you! Yes!

Chiaki:
Eh eh, get lost rug rats!

Kids:
Whoa! Let's go! Move it! Let's get out of here!
Come on, wait for me! Get out of here...

Chiaki:
Say bye to Kousuke for me. Tell him sorry I couldn't say good bye in person.

Makoto:
Sure.

Chiaki:
Oh, um, one more thing.

Makoto:
Yeah?

Chiaki:
There's something I've been meaning to tell you for a long time now.
Listen. Don't go gettin’ yourself hurt by jumping out in front of things, okay?

Makoto:
Uhmm.

Chiaki:
I'm serious. You need to be more careful. The old “look-before-you-leap” thing definitely works.

Makoto:
Unbelievable! That's the last thing you have to say to me?

Chiaki:
I'm looking out for you, stupid.

Makoto:
Fine then! Thank you so much for looking out for me.
Now hurry up and go.

Chiaki:
What are you upset about?

Makoto:
Just go!

Chiaki:
See ya.

Makoto:
Yeah, See ya!


Makoto:
I don't get it!


Chiaki:
I'll be waiting for you.

Makoto:
'Kay, I won't be long. I'll come running.


20. Summer Sky

Kousuke:
Makoto, Makoto! Hey, Makoto!


Kousuke:
Incredible! I don't believe it!
Me, I could understand. But to leave without saying bye to you?
And all of a sudden he's leaving school, 'cause he's gonna study abroad.
Ah, come on, give me a break!

Kaho:
Oh, sorry!

Moriko:
Ah, don't worry about it.

Makoto:
He probably figured out what he wanted to do.

Kousuke:
Wait! Did he tell you something?

Makoto:
Tell me something? Like what?

Kaho;
I'm sorry.

Sekimi:
Hey, Kaho, you throw like a girl!

Kousuke:
Look at her.
Makoto:
I've made a decision about my future too.

Kousuke:
Huh? What?

Makoto:
It's a secret.

Kousuke:
How come? What? Don't you trust me?

Makoto:
Tell you some other time.

Sekimi:
Makoto, hey!

Makoto:
Ready! Good throw!
Here comes!
