  Nagisa:
Tomoya. It's morning, wake up.
Breakfast is ready when you are. Don't let it get cold.

Tomoya:
Oh... Uh, thank you.

Sorry to make you do this.

Nagisa:
That's fine. I don't mind at all.
But what about you? You seemed pretty worn-out last night.

Tomoya:
Yeah, my muscles are still aching like crazy.
I feel a little better than before, though.

Nagisa:
Try not to push yourself too hard out there, okay?

Tomoya:
Okay.

Tomoya:
Morning, everyone! How's it going?

Yusuke:
Good morning. Go ahead and get changed.

Tomoya:
Yes, sir.


Yusuke:
You're not holding the spanner the right way.
I showed you how to do it yesterday, remember?

Tomoya:
Right. Sorry.

Yusuke:
Also, you're using too much thread lock.
Fasten the screws in diagonal order. Don't tell me you forgot already.

Tomoya:
Right! Sorry!

Yusuke:
Stay focused up there.
Little mistakes can cause big accidents.

Tomoya:
Yes, sir.

Tomoya:
Hey, I'm home from work.

Nagisa:
Welcome back!
I'm cooking some pork for dinner to help give you more stamina tomorrow.

Tomoya:
Wow, thanks. That sounds great.

Nagisa:
I'll be finished soon, so get some rest in the meantime.
Oh, the bath is ready, too.

Tomoya:
Thanks.

Nagisa:
Tomoya, are you tired again?

Tomoya:
Huh? Not really, I'm much better today.

Nagisa is the one thing holding me together right now.
She sees me off in the morning, worries about me while I'm at work, and makes sure I'm okay when I make it home.
As long as I have her, I don't think any job could get me down.



Yusuke:
You're getting better, but why do you always do things the hard way?
I don't get it.

Tomoya:
Do what? What do you mean?

Yusuke:
It's easier to use both your hands, isn't it?
Why do you favor your left hand so much?

Tomoya:
Er... I guess it's kinda weird, but it's easier for me.

Yusuke:
Hm. That's fine.
It's not like you're doing anything wrong, I suppose.

Girl:
I know he doesn't look like much, but I like him.


Nagisa:
Tomoya? Hey, Tomoya.

Tomoya:
Huh? Oh, sorry. What is it?

Nagisa:
I keep saying your name, but you just stare off like you can't hear me.

Tomoya:
I know, I know. I was just thinking about work.

Nagisa:
I-I'm sorry.

Tomoya:
Why are you apologizing?

Nagisa:
You've been having such a hard time at work.
But when you come home, all I do is go on and on about myself.
I'm sorry.

Tomoya:
No! You got it all wrong!
I'm always happy to hear about your day.
You're not being rude. It's a nice change of pace.

Nagisa:
You haven't told Yoshino that your right shoulder is bad?
He probably should know.

Tomoya:
I can't do that.
If he finds out, then he might not let me work anymore.

Nagisa:
I didn't think of it that way.

Tomoya:
And besides, even if Yoshino didn't mind, that still doesn't mean my boss will approve.
I'm lucky I found a job that pays so well right outta high school.
I hate to be fired before my first pay check.

Nagisa:
All right, but don't let yourself get hurt over something like that.

Tomoya:
Don't worry. I'll try to be careful.

Nagisa:
All right then. See you tomorrow.

Tomoya:
Yeah, good night. Something wrong?

Nagisa:
Tomoya, aren't you lonely at your new place?

Tomoya:
Huh?

Nagisa:
It's just, you'll be all alone after I leave.
If it were me, I think I might be kinda sad.
Maybe it's not a big deal to you, but it makes me wanna cry just thinking about it.

Tomoya:
Now that's silly.
No reason to cry over something like that.

Nagisa:
I guess so, but...

Tomoya:
Once you leave, I go straight to sleep, so it's not a problem.
Anyway, don't sweat the small stuff, I'll be fine.

Nagisa:
All right. Good night, I'll see you tomorrow.


Tomoya:
Wait, what are we doing?

Yusuke:
We need to make a construction photo ledger for process management.
Here, hold this.

Kinoshita:
Thanks, Yoshino. Keep up the good work.
Is that...

Tomoya:
Mr. Kinoshita!

Yusuke:
Now that's a surprise.
Are you two friends or something?

Kinoshita:
Well, it was quite a while back, but I used to work for the same company as Tomoya's father.
I would see Tomoya when I visited their house after work.
I'm surprised. You sure have gotten big.

Tomoya:
I'm pretty surprised myself.
I didn't think I'd run into you in a place like this, Mr. Kinoshita.

Kinoshita:
The last company I worked for went under a while back, so I applied here.
So how's your father been these days?

Tomoya:
Uh, well, I'm living on my own these days, so I don't see him very often.

Yusuke:
Work takes us all over the place.
So these sorta things are bound to happen every once in a while.
Makes you realize how small the world really is.

Tomoya:
I don't know, it doesn't seem small to me.
In fact, it feels like my world's just got bigger.

Yusuke:
Really interested in those photos, huh?

Tomoya:
Just made me realize something, that's all.
Before I knew it, all these big buildings had popped up all over the place.

Yusuke:
This is only the beginning.
Just wait. Once they finish all the roads they're working on, new companies and new shops will start showing up everywhere.
They're about to build a big hospital out here, too.

Tomoya:
It seems hard to believe.
In a way, I kinda don't want it to change so fast.


Tomoya:
Hey, if you're free next Sunday, do you wanna go out somewhere?

Nagisa:
Oh. Sorry, I can't.
I have a mock entrance exam that afternoon.

Tomoya:
A mock exam? You're not going to college, are you?

Nagisa:
No, probably not.
But I still wanna take the exam with everyone else in my class.
That's why I was apologizing to you.

Tomoya:
I see...
You and I seem to be on different schedules these days.

Nagisa:
Mm-hm.

Tomoya:
Ah, it's nothing to feel bad about. Good luck on the test.

Nagisa:
Okay.


Tomoya:
Now remind me again, why am I hanging out with you on my time off?

Akio:
'Cause I happen to have some time off, too.
So don't be such a little turd.
Now let's have a little fun for grown-ups. What do you say?

Tomoya:
Fun for grown-ups?

Akio:
This is my favorite toy store. I'm a regular here.

Tomoya:
A regular, huh?

Akio:
Hey, what's up?

Owner:
You impudent whelp!

Owner:
I hate to say so, but I think your new friend is a little slow in the head.

Akio:
Nah, he's a rookie, that's all. Cut the guy some slack.

Tomoya:
A rookie?! You mean there are pros?!

Akio:
Anyway, let's go ahead and call this a draw for today.

Owner:
In that case, that makes 123 wins, 171 losses, and 32 draws for me.

Tomoya:
This is your idea of fun for grown-ups, huh?

Akio:
Nah, we're just getting started.
So, my special order come in or what?

Owner:
Come on, who do you think I am?

Akio:
Go ahead. Open it up.

Tomoya:
What the heck is this?

Owner:
Why, it's Lizard. The Bengal Monitor Lizard, of course.

Tomoya:
Lizard the Lizard, huh?

Akio:
I'm gonna take this critter home to Sanae. And then stick it down her shirt!
Why, just thinking about it sets my heart to flutter!

Tomoya:
That's some sense of romance.
Don't you feel sorry for Sanae? Why would you do that?

Akio:
Don't be so stuck up.
If you don't want your marriage to get stale, you gotta give your lady something to get excited about every now and then.
Might try yourself someday.

Tomoya:
You give the worst advice in the world.


Sanae:
Hi, Tomoya. Haven't seen you in ages, huh?

Tomoya:
Uh, y-yeah.

Akio:
By the way, Sanae, what are you afraid of most in the whole wide world?

Sanae:
That'd be the Bengal Monitor Lizard, of course.

Tomoya:
So specific!

Akio:
That's what I thought.
Ah, look! There's one over there!

Sanae:
What?! H-Here in the shop?!

Akio:
Ah! It went over there!

Sanae:
What?!

Tomoya:
Please forgive me, Sanae.
Ahhh! Oh, no! Look out, Sanae! It just went down your shirt!

Sanae:
Someone get it out!

Akio:
Ah, damn. Looks like I really outdid myself this time.

Tomoya:
Do something about it!

Akio:
Sanae! Tomoya did it!

Tomoya:
Ah! No fair!

Isogai:
Oh, my. They sure are lively today, aren't they?

Tomoya:
Mrs. Isogai, sorry for making so much noise.

Isogai:
Oh, it's fine. Those two are so much fun to watch.
Everyone in the neighborhood can't wait to see what the Furukawas do next.

Tomoya:
Ha, is that so?

Sanae:
Someone get it out!

Akio:
Sanae, wait!

Tomoya:
I guess I'm going after them.

Isogai:
Oh, of course, don't worry.
I'll watch over the shop until you get back.

Tomoya:
Uh, thank you.


Nagisa:
Wow, that was a real surprise.
I see my parents running all the time when I get home.
But I've never seen you running with them.

Tomoya:
Oh, man. I bet Sanae hates me now.

Nagisa:
I think you've got it backwards, Tomoya.
After today, I bet you two will get along even better than you did before.

Tomoya:
I'm no so sure.
I put a Bengal Monitor Lizard down her shirt.

Nagisa:
Like I told you, my mom and dad run around like that all the time.
But I bet this is the first time someone else's running around with them.
So if you ask me, that means you're like family now.

Tomoya:
Wow, you really think so?

Nagisa:
Oh, um... By the way, Tomoya.
Do you remember what happens on the next next Sunday?
It's a special event.

Tomoya:
The next next?
Well, your birthday is in December, so it's not that...

Nagisa:
It's the Founder's Festival at our school.
I know the Drama Club has been disbanded and all.
But that doesn't mean I can't have fun seeing what all the other students put together.
So, uh... I thought...

Tomoya:
Sounds good. Let's make it a date.

Nagisa:
Okay!



Employee:
Today was pretty rough, huh?

Employee:
Yeah, you're telling me, buddy.
I feel like we really earned our paycheck on that one.

Employee:
Good work out there today.

Yusuke:
Organizing some papers, huh?

Boss:
Yeah, it's too much of a pain to do it by myself.
But he is a real natural at this.

Yusuke:
I see. Pretty impressive.

Tomoya:
It's no big deal. I'm just organizing them by date.

Yusuke:
Yeah, looks annoying.
I couldn't take five minutes of that.

Employee:
Guess I could help you with this pile if you like.

Tomoya:
Ah, no. Thanks anyway, but I already finished those.

Employee:
Don't let him do it, kid.
If he touches those papers, you'll never get 'em in order again.

Employee:
Who do you think you're talking about?
I'll have you know I was an accountant before my company downsized.

Employee:
If you're looking for actual work that bad, you can do my job for me.

Tomoya:
Don't worry, I'm almost done here.
If you guys wanna go home, you can go ahead.

Yusuke:
Good. In that case, see you later.

Tomoya:
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

Employee:
See ya.

Employee:
So long. I'll see you tomorrow, boss.

Employee:
Catch you later.

Boss:
You know, I really am glad you signed on with us.
We're about to get a really big contract and we've been short on workers for a long time.

Tomoya:
Thank you, but I still don't know how to do anything.

Boss:
Come on, don't be so modest.
You just started and I hear you can do most of the work already.
I warn you, you may have to work on the weekends a bit more now, but you're doing a great job.


Nagisa:
Founder's. Founder's. Founder's Festival.
I can't wait till next week.

Tomoya:
Nagisa.

Nagisa:
Yes? Dinner's almost done.

Tomoya:
Actually, this isn't about dinner. It's about work.
If things get busy, I might not be able to make the Founder's Festival after all.
I'm sorry. I hate to say that when we don't spend enough time together as it is.

Nagisa:
Don't worry about it so much.
I think it's good that you're busy with work. It's nothing to be sorry about.

Tomoya:
Nagisa.

Nagisa:
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little disappointed.
But I'm glad you're working so hard and your job is going so well.

Tomoya:
I'm really sorry.


Yusuke:
Get me the diagonal cutter.

Tomoya:
No problem.

Yusuke:
Okay. Next, I need 210mm of triple-core VVF cable.
Strip both ends.

Tomoya:
How much should I strip?
Should be 2cm if it's insulated, right?

Yusuke:
Yeah, but you can do either if you strip 4cm.
Remember that.

Tomoya:
Oh, I see. Thanks, that helps a lot.

Yusuke:
Now get some wrapping 38 ready.

Tomoya:
Protective tubing, huh?
You need standard or flame-retardant?

Yusuke:
Better to use flame-retardant.
It'd be bad if this burned.

You can finish up the rest.
I'm gonna take a look over there, alright?

Tomoya:
No problem.

Yusuke:
Be careful and don't rush.
I'll come back when I'm done.

Tomoya:
Okay.


Tomoya:
Er, yeah. I hate to ask, but if possible, I'd like to have the day off tomorrow.

Yusuke:
That's fine. It's perfect, actually.
It's a holiday, so you wouldn't be working anyway.

Tomoya:
I didn't know!

Yusuke:
By the way, how's your right shoulder doing?

Tomoya:
Huh?

Yusuke:
Can't raise your right arm, can you?
I could tell by watching you.

Tomoya:
You must have known for a while now.
Why didn't you say something to me sooner?

Yusuke:
Even if I did, it wouldn't have done any good.
After all, you've been doing your job just fine.
If you're working hard to overcome your handicap out there, you should be proud.
You know, work's gonna get harder and harder from now on.
If you can't handle that, you don't have to push yourself. I can always pick up the slack.

Tomoya:
You sure that's all right?
I mean, I don't wanna end up being a burden to you.

Yusuke:
We get help for things we can't do. That's the whole point of having a company.
There'll be times when I can't do something and I'll need your help. Nothing wrong with that.
So in short, if you work too hard, you might have an accident, then make that girlfriend of yours sad.
We wouldn't want that to happen.

Tomoya:
Thank you so much.


Boss:
Oh, no! Everybody went home already?! No good.

Tomoya:
Is something wrong?

Boss:
Oh, I made a stupid mistake and one of our jobs got left out of the schedule.
It's this one here. Could you do something like this?

Tomoya:
Yeah, it should be alright.
It's the same thing I've been doing with Yoshino.

Boss:
That's great.
Sorry, I hate to ask you, but you wouldn't mind taking care of it for me, would you?

Tomoya:
Like right now? By myself?

Boss:
Yeah, I have some other work I gotta get done, too.
I'll drop you off at the site, then come back to pick you up when you're done. Okay?

Tomoya:
Sure.


Tomoya:
Yoshino.

Yusuke:
I just got a phone call from the boss.
I tried to get over here as fast as I could.
Were you able to handle things on your own?

Tomoya:
Yeah. I think so.

Yusuke:
Did you check the junctions?

Tomoya:
Yeah. I checked the whole circuit after I was finished.

Yusuke:
Did you remember to remove the coating?

Tomoya:
Yes. I double-checked the measurement, too.

Yusuke:
All right. Good work.
Let's head back. It's late.

Tomoya:
Yes, sir!


Nagisa:
I'm going to the festival ahead of you, okay?

Tomoya:
Alright, that sounds good to me.
I'll meet you at the front gate of the school.

Nagisa:
See ya.

Tomoya:
Hm? Hello.

Boss:
Uh, hey, Okazaki. Do you know what happened at the site yesterday?

Tomoya:
Huh?

Boss:
I got a call from Yoshino just a little while ago.
He said that he's noticed a mistake, and that he's going to fix it ASAP.
I tried to find out what was wrong, but I couldn't get anything out of him.
Anyway, I thought you might know something since you were there.

Tomoya:
Yoshino!

Yusuke:
Okazaki! What are you doing here?

Tomoya:
What do you mean?! I'm sorry!
If I'd done my job right, you...

Yusuke:
Not your fault.

Tomoya:
It is!

Yusuke:
It slid by me, too. I didn't think about it until you went home.
By then it was late, so I decided to fix it up today instead.
I admit you were careless, but I should have noticed it before you left.
You have plans with Nagisa, don't you? Hurry up and go.

Tomoya:
Let me take responsibility!

Yusuke:
Forget it.

Tomoya:
Yoshino, please!

Yusuke:
I need some low-insulation tubing, 6m of type 20.

Tomoya:
Huh?

Yusuke:
Come on! Get moving!

Tomoya:
Right!


Nagisa:
Oh, Tomoya.

Tomoya:
Nagisa...

Nagisa:
So you were at work, huh? I thought so.
Something sudden must have come up.

Wow Tomoya, you sure are sweating an awful lot.

Tomoya:
I'm sorry.

Nagisa:
No reason to be upset. You haven't done anything to apologize for.
Here, take one. I bought us both some roasted corn.

We can eat it on the way home.
You're coming, right?

Tomoya:
Er, right.


Tomoya:
Good morning.

Employee:
I heard ya had a tough time yesterday, Mr. Okazaki.

Tomoya:
Yeah.

Employee:
I heard about what happened from Yoshino.
Never thought I'd meet a guy who'd skip out on a date to come to work.

Employee:
Shoulda told me, man.
I woulda taken care of that date for ya.

Boss:
Sorry it worked out that way.
But if it's any consolation, I'll pay you overtime for your work.

Tomoya:
I, uh, I appreciate it, but it was my mistake.
I thought you'd be upset.

Yusuke:
Everyone makes mistakes. So the important thing is how you make up for them.
You gave it your best out there. And in the end, you didn't cause the client any problems.
From now on, just don't make the same mistake again and you should be fine.

And if you still feel guilty, then when you're showing another rookie the ropes, if he makes a mistake, you cover for him.
Just remember that's your job. And also... your love!

Tomoya:
Thank you, Yoshino! I'll never forget that!

Employee:
I'm not sure about the love part, but I can agree with the other stuff.

Boss:
All right ladies, enough chitchat! Let's get to work now!

Employees:
Okay. Alright. Yes, sir.

Boss:
Oh, Okazaki. I finally had this made for you.

Tomoya:
Huh?

Yusuke:
Okazaki, let's move!

Tomoya:
Uh, right!



Nagisa:
You know, I feel like your kindness has really been shining through lately.

Tomoya:
You know, I used to think being nice to people was a hassle.
Kinda funny considering how I was always butting into other people's problems.

Nagisa:
I support you either way.
So whichever choice you think is best, is best for me.

Yusuke:
Don't ever lose sight of what's important to you.
