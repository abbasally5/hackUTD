  "I":
We finally ventured outside of the building.

The girl:
Be careful not to go too far.
If you weren't careful, you might not be able to make it back.

"I":
This is a world that has ended, an empty, sad place. A place where we are all alone.
We were looking for scraps. Bits and pieces of anything that might be useful to us.
In this world, we are forced to scavenge if we hope to survive.

The girl:
Here we go. This one, too.

The girl:
Were you scared? I'm glad you could make it back. There you go.
It's strange, isn't it? They had such a gentle aura to them.



Youhei:
Are we eating lunch in the cafeteria?

Tomoya:
Wait a sec, you just got here, didn't you?

Youhei:
Yeah.

Tomoya:
Then you gotta make some kind of opening statement.
If you don't, it'll throw me off all afternoon.

Youhei:
Okay, fine! I'll just do it over again!
Hey, how are you, Okazaki? Where would you enjoy eating lunch today?

Tomoya:
Way too eloquent.

Youhei:
Huh?

Tomoya:
I'm saying that was too eloquent for you.
It was so out of character, I don't know how to respond.

Youhei:
Then what do you want me to do?

Tomoya:
Try saying "all that, and a toilet" at the end of your sentences.
That'll take an edge off the eloquence and make it sound more lowbrow like you.

Youhei:
Yeah, whatever.
Maybe some other time, okay?



Youhei:
Huh? Mei's staying at your place again?
Are you okay with that?

Nagisa:
Of course! We don't mind at all! The whole family loves Mei!

Tomoya:
And just for the record, she already told your parents and O.K.'d it with her school back home.
She wanted to stick around and keep an eye on you.

Youhei:
Huh?

Mei:
My brother's in his last semester of high school and he still doesn't know what to do with himself.
I'd better stay here, I'm too worried to go home.

Tomoya:
Mei said she wants to have a nice, long talk with you, so you be ready.

Nagisa:
Sunohara, have you ever thought about your future goals or what you wanna do with yourself?

Youhei:
Hm... Can't say it comes to mind, no.
Obviously college is out of the question. So I guess I'll just find any old job and work any old way.
But, if I happen to find a responsible girlfriend to look after me, I bet Mei wouldn't be so worried all the time.

Tomoya:
Yeah, that's it!

Tomoya:
All you gotta do is pretend like you're going out with some nice girl.
Someone really smart or dependable or whatever.
We can introduce her to Mei and then she'll stop worrying.

Nagisa:
I see what you mean, but it's not good to lie.

Youhei:
I don't know... You think anyone would go for that?

Tomoya:
Well, sure. Why not? I mean, it's not like you're ugly or anything.
Even if you have a rotten personality, you still have a baby face.
You appeal to their maternal instinct. You're Baby Sunohara!

Nagisa:
Hm?

Youhei:
Y-You think so?

Tomoya:
And just think, if you and your fake girlfriend happen to hit it off, it might even turn into a real relationship.

Youhei:
Whoa! The Okazaki magic, huh?
Alright, bring it on! I'm ready to rock!

Nagisa:
Tomoya, are you actually helping him or just having fun at his expense?

Tomoya:
Uh, a little bit of both, but he'll be fine.

Youhei:
Let's see, let's see.
I need someone smart with good manners, and she's gotta be cute, too.

Tomoya:
Seeing now, there's a man who knows what he wants.

Youhei:
Oh, of course! She's perfect! Here I come!

Tomoya:
Hold on! You're not really gonna ask her?!

Ryou:
Whaaat?!

Youhei:
Come on, you don't have to look that surprised, it's just pretend.
Nothing to get worked up about.

Tomoya:
If you don't wanna do it, then we're not gonna force you, okay?
After all, you know what kind of guy he is, so I wouldn't exactly blame you for saying no.

Ryou:
No, I can't do it. It's just too much for me, way too much.
It's so embarrassing just thinking about it. I just can't...

Nagisa:
It's okay, Ryou. Please don't cry.

Youhei:
I hate to admit it, but the more she says no, the more I wanna bug her till she says yes.

Tomoya:
Watch it, man. I wouldn't say that if I were you...

Kyou:
Was he picking on you? I'm sorry, Ryou.

Ryou:
No, I'm okay. It's... it's nothing like that.

Kyou:
Which one of you brutes did this to my precious little sister?

Nagisa:
It's a misunderstanding.
We were just trying to find a fake girlfriend for Sunohara.

Youhei:
Man, do you think I should ask Kyou?

Tomoya:
What, are you kidding me? She just kicked your ass.

Youhei:
Yeah, I guess she's no good, huh?
It's probably for the best since she's so bossy and mean and violent.
Really more like a gorilla than a girl.

Kyou:
I'm standing right here, you know?

Wanna say that to my face?
As a reward for your courage, I'll stick my hand down your throat, rip out your vocal cords, and stomp on them.

Youhei:
I-I'm sorry.
I said sorry!

Kyou:
I know, but for some reason, that pissed me off even more.

Let's go, Sis.
Their stupidity might be contagious.

Ryou:
O-Okay...

Kyou:
Really acting like a bunch of primates.
Men are so insensitive.

Ryou:
I'll see you later.


Nagisa:
Are you sure you're okay, Sunohara?
That looked like it really hurt.

Tomoya:
He'll be fine.
He's had so much experience getting beaten up by girls, he should be a real pro at it by now.

Youhei:
Don't trivialize my suffering!

Tomoya:
But if both Fujibayashi and Kyou turned you down, then we're kind of running outta options, aren't we?
Hm?

Nagisa:
Well, Tomoyo is sitting right over there.
Why don't you ask her?

Youhei:
For real?

Nagisa:
Why not? I think she'd make a great girlfriend.
She's pretty, and caring, and smart.

Tomoya:
I don't know, it might be dangerous.
Look at him freaking out.

Youhei:
Sh-Shut up! Wh-Wh-Who's freaking out, huh?

Nagisa:
Think we should take him to a doctor?

Tomoya:
Calm down. Just take a deep breath, okay?

Youhei:
He-he-huu... He-he-huu... Okay, time to deliver.

Nagisa:
I really think we need to go to the doctor.

Youhei:
We may seem like enemies.
But we're really more like rivals now that I think about it.
Even though we couldn't help getting into fights all the time...

Tomoyo:
What's the matter? It's not like you to look so troubled.

Youhei:
Humph. None of your business, little missy.

Tomoyo:
No, I suppose it isn't.
But you know... We're rivals, and that means I don't wanna see you lose to anyone but me.

Youhei:
Over time, we recognized each others' strengths.
And even if we fought, deep down, we had a mutual affection for each other.

Nagisa:
That's so touching!

Youhei:
That's why I can't turn back! Humph!

Tomoyo:
Tea stains are actually a substance called tannin.
Baking soda does the best job of getting rid of them, but if you don't have any, then you can just...
Then you can just use vinegar instead!

Youhei:
Don't pretend like I'm not here!

Girl:
Sakagami, is this person a friend of yours?

Tomoyo:
Don't make eye contact with him. He's highly unstable.

Youhei:
Don't treat me like some kind of wild animal!

Nagisa:
Tomoyo, please. Hear Sunohara out just this once.

Tomoyo:
Oh, it's Furukawa.
Our game yesterday sure was fun, wasn't it?

Nagisa:
Yah! I'm so glad you came, you were really cool out there!

Tomoyo:
I called you Furukawa instead of Nagisa. That's okay, right?

Nagisa:
Call me anything. Whatever you like.

Youhei:
Could you two stop having a little chat without me?!

Tomoyo:
You're still here? What was it you wanted?

Tomoya:
He has a little favor to ask.
You think you could hear him out a sec?

Tomoyo:
Playing baseball with you was one thing, but going out of my way for Sunohara is asking a lot.

Youhei:
I'm really troubled right now...

Tomoyo:
Really? 'Cause you look about the same as usual to me.

Youhei:
Humph, it's none of your business, little missy.

Tomoyo:
That's what I'm saying. See ya!

Youhei:
No! You're supposed to say "we're rivals, and that means I don't wanna see you lose to anyone but me!"

Tomoyo:
I don't get it. Why would I say something I don't mean?

Youhei:
Just say it! Let me move on with my life!

Tomoyo:
We're rivals, and that means I don't wanna see you lose to anyone but me.

Youhei:
Humph! Who said anything about losing?
Let's settle this now.

Tomoyo:
If he wanted to pick a fight, he should have said so sooner.
See you later, Okazaki, Furukawa.

Girl:
That was so cool!

Girl:
You're the best, Sakagami!



Kotomi:
Okay, I understand. I'll help.

Youhei:
Really?

Nagisa:
You're so sweet, Kotomi. Thank you.

Kotomi:
Of course! I'll do anything I can to help my friends.
Just tell me what to do and I promise I'll make it happen.

Nagisa:
Since you two are supposed to be dating, why don't you try doing normal couple stuff, like having fun together and hanging out?

Youhei:
Sounds good. What should we do?

Kotomi:
Oh, I know.

Tomoya:
This is what happens when you let her decide!

Nagisa:
Huh?

Youhei:
I thought you said you got the violin repaired!

Kotomi:
Yup! It sounds much better than before, don't you think?

Tomoya:
I don't know about that, er, maybe more lethal!


Nagisa:
Are you sure about this, Sunohara?
It seems like a waste after she agreed to help.

Youhei:
Don't make me go back there.
I don't have the guts, I can't do it.

Tomoya:
Don't give up. Remember, love is a battlefield.

Tomoya:
Miyazawa, are you here?

Yukine:
Hi, Okazaki. Hi Furukawa, Sunohara.
It's been a while, huh?

Nagisa:
It sure has. Nice to see you, Miyazawa.

Youhei:
Yukine, huh? Seems like she's always ready to please.
Nice and quiet, too.

Yukine:
Hm? Sorry, what are you talking about?

Yukine:
A fake girlfriend, huh? I'm not sure, it sounds difficult.

Youhei:
No way! It'll be a piece of cake, I promise!
Just follow my lead and you'll be fine. Please, I need your help.

Tajima:
I've had enough of this crap.

Youhei:
Huh?

Tajima:
Don't you have any shame?!
You ain't worth the dirt on the bottom of our Big Sis Yuki's shoe!

Tomoya:
Wait, "Big Sis"? What?

Nagisa:
Miyazawa, is this your brother?

Yukine:
No, actually, he is my guest.
He's hiding out in here due to some rather complicated circumstances.

Tajima:
Listen up, turd, if you give our big sister any grief, then you're gonna have to deal with us!
You got that?!

Argh! Dammit! That can't be good for my record.
If anything happens, you can call me. You hear me?
No matter where I am, I'll come running.

Yukine:
But you can't go outside yet! Come back! You still need to hide!
Oh, I'm sorry, please excuse me.

Nagisa:
Is it just me or was that really strange?

Tomoya:
Guess she's got her own problems to deal with, huh?


Nagisa:
I'm sorry, but I'd better head home.
I hate to leave you guys, but I need to help my family make dinner.
Well, Sunohara, good luck out there.

Youhei:
Guess I could use all the luck I can get.

Tomoya:
The problem is we're expecting people to do something for nothing.
Maybe we could offer a reward.

Youhei:
Hm? But I don't have any money.

Tomoya:
You don't need money.
To win a girl's heart, all you need is a little charm.

Youhei:
Good point.

Tomoya:
First things first, you gotta flatter her.
After that, make her feel like her secrets are safe with you 'cause girls these days just love to keep secrets.
Finally, you gotta hit the peer pressure angle. Tell her that all the cool kids are into you.

Youhei:
I got it. Let's give it a shot!
Hey there, cutie! You got a sec?
Hey, just hear me out, alright? I promise it'll be worth your time.
I got a part-time job offer you can't turn down.

Girl:
Sorry, I'm in a hurry right now.

Youhei:
Come on! Your secret's safe with me!
You don't have to use your real name and I won't tell your parents, either.
There's no need to be shy, I mean, all the cool kids are doing it!

You're making me sound like some kinda sleazy pimp!

Sanae:
Um...

Tomoya:
Sanae!

Sanae:
You two look upset. Is something troubling you?

Sanae:
Hm... But if all you need is a fake girlfriend, then I wouldn't mind helping you out.

Youhei:
Whaaat?!

Tomoya:
Are you sure about this, Sanae?

Sanae:
As long as Mei is staying with us, I consider her part of the family.
If you're her brother, that means you're part of the family, too.

Youhei:
H-H-H-H-Hold on! Time-out!

Youhei:
Okazaki, you said that was Nagisa's older sister, right?

Tomoya:
Her sister? Oh, yeah. I guess I did say that yesterday, didn't I?

Youhei:
Oh dude, Nagisa's sister, I can't believe it!
She's totally hot, man! I'm freaking out here!

Tomoya:
I think I'm gonna wait and see how this plays out.

Sanae:
Um... I'm sorry, am I not good enough?

Youhei:
That's not it at all!

Tomoya:
But if you pretended to be his girlfriend, wouldn't Mei figure it out you were faking it right off the bat?

Sanae:
Oh, don't worry. It'll be fine. I'll just wear a disguise.

Tomoya:
Are you serious about this, Sanae?

Sanae:
Sure. But you have to take good care of me.

Youhei:
Yahoo! Yahoo! Yahoo! Yahoo! Yahoo!


Mei:
What?! You have a girlfriend?!

Youhei:
I sure do. She's pretty and responsible.
And I wanna spend the rest of my life with her.

Mei:
Eww!

Youhei:
As you can see, I have direction in my life after all, nothing to worry about.
Why, you might say I'm climbing the stairs to adulthood one step at a time.

Mei:
Let me meet her. You have to introduce me to her.
As your sister, I think I deserve to meet the person you want to spend the rest of your life with.

Youhei:
Alright, no problem. I'll see when she has some time off.


Sanae:
Goodness, the Drama Club sure has a lot of different costumes, doesn't it?

Tomoya:
We'll be meeting up with Mei in two days.
That gives us tomorrow to rehearse your big day with Sunohara.

Sanae:
Right! I'm so excited!

Nagisa:
I'm getting mixed feelings about this whole thing.
Even if it's just pretend, my mom is going out with one of my classmates.

Tomoya:
You sure you wanna go through with this?
Sunohara is really looking forward to the whole date thing, you know.
He thinks you're Nagisa's older sister, not her mom.

Sanae:
Nagisa's older sister?! That's such a nice thing to say.

Tomoya:
I wasn't trying to flatter you...

Nagisa:
I don't know, Mom, I'm sure you mean well and all, but maybe this isn't such a good idea.

Sanae:
I haven't said anything, but ever since the baseball game, I've been thinking about Sunohara.
At first glance, he seems a little awkward and irresponsible, but deep down, I think he's really a sweet boy.
If someone was there to push him in the right direction, I feel like he might be able to turn his life around.
That's why I wanna help him in any way that I can.

Nagisa:
I feel the same way.
If you're really serious about helping him out, I wanna do my best for Sunohara, too.

Sanae:
Great! Then that's how we'll work together, okay?

Tomoya:
Er, yeah, but one more thing.
Let's not mention this to your old man. You know what I mean?

Nagisa:
No, I don't get it.

Tomoya:
Uh, well, even if your mom is just doing this to help out Sunohara, it might make your dad kinda, uh... flip out and pound his face in.
So let's just keep this our little secret for Sunohara's safety, I mean.

Nagisa, Sanae:
Oh...


Nagisa:
I don't think I've ever seen Sunohara so nervous before.

Tomoya:
For some reason, he's really pissing me off.

Nagisa:
Why would you be angry?
No way, Tomoya, don't tell me you fall in love with my mom, too.

Tomoya:
Wh.... what? Come on now, that's just crazy talk.

Sanae:
So, uh...

Youhei:
Y-Yes!

Sanae:
If we're supposed to be boyfriend and girlfriend, then we should be on a first-name basis.
So I'm gonna call you "Youhei," alright?

Youhei:
Yeah? Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-Yeah! Yeah!

Sanae:
You're so cute. I hope we can have fun together.

Youhei:
Oh, man! She just said I was cute, dude!

Sanae:
Let's start by walking side by side, okay?

Youhei:
O-O-Okay!

Sanae:
You can come a little closer. We're a couple after all.

Youhei:
Oh, man! She smells awesome, dude!

Sanae:
Should we hold hands? Here, don't be shy.

Youhei:
Oh, man! Her hands are way soft, dude!

Tomoya:
I don't need a play-by-play.

Do you really think all this is gonna push him in the right direction?

Nagisa:
Now I'm having mixed feelings all over again.


Tomoya:
And the big day arrives.

Nagisa:
Sunohara's already waiting.

Tomoya:
Hey Mei, try calling out to him and see what happens.
I bet he'll think it's his girlfriend and get really nervous.

Mei:
When you put it that way, you make it hard to resist.

Mei:
Have you been waiting long?

Youhei:
Of course not! Actually, I just got here!
MEI?!

Nagisa:
I don't get it, what's with all the cans?

Youhei:
All part of my plan.
When she gets here, she'll see all the cans. And then...

Sanae:
Sunohara...
You mean you've been waiting for me all this time?

Youhei:
Pretty clever trick, huh?

Tomoya:
Oh, yeah, you're a real smooth operator.

Youhei:
It's part of the deadly game we all know too well.
A game of love, a boy's love game, you might say.

Tomoya:
That means something else, you know.

Youhei:
Dammit! I drank too much! Gotta take a potty break!

Mei:
This place is a mess. We can't leave it like this.

Tomoya:
Yeah, you're right. I'll help clean it up.

Mei:
Thanks.

Sanae:
Here, let me help, too.

Mei:
Oh, uh, thank you.

Sanae:
No, don't mention it.

Tomoya:
She looks so cute...

Nagisa:
Hey, you're not staring at my mom and blushing, are you?

Tomoya:
Uh...

Youhei:
Whew... that's the stuff...

Sanae:
Oh! Hi, Youhei!

Youhei:
I'm sorry! I didn't make you wait, did I?!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

Sanae:
It's fine, don't worry. I just got here.

Mei:
Is that really my brother's girlfriend?



Mei:
Sure is nice having someone who cares for you, isn't it?

Youhei:
Wait, where did this come from?
I-I don't know, if I go after her, I might end up missing Sanae's call.
Yeah, you can't tell someone who to love.

Youhei:
Hey, I said wait...
