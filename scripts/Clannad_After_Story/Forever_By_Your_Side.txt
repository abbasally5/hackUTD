  Saki:
Shima.

Katsuki:
Huh? Oh...
Hey, Saki. Hey, Yuki.

Saki:
Sorry, Misae didn't come to school today.

Yuki:
Yeah, she called Saki this morning and said she had a cold.
We thought you knew. I hope you weren't waiting out here too long.

Katsuki:
No, it's okay.

Saki:
So something did happen after all.
It's not like Misae to skip school, even if she is sick.

Yuki:
Probably something with Igarashi, right?

Katsuki:
Mm...

Saki:
I see, so he turned her down.

Yuki:
Poor Misae...

Saki:
But you know what, Shima?

Katsuki:
Hm?

Saki:
As much as I hate to see Misae get her heart broken, I think a guy like you suits her a lot better than Igarashi.

Yuki:
If you could just talk to her, I bet she would cheer up.
We'll get her to come to the park later.



Katsuki:
Sagara...

Misae:
Shima. What are you doing here?

Katsuki:
Um, Sagara... I-I mean, Misae, I...

Misae:
What is it?

Katsuki:
Love is like the fireworks of days long past, don't you think?

Misae:
What do you mean?

Katsuki:
Boom! You can't appreciate its true beauty until it bursts.

Misae:
Are you picking a fight with me or what!

Katsuki:
Argh! Sorry, sorry!
Um, here. You can use this.

Misae:
Use it for what? I'm not crying.

Katsuki:
Oh, then use it when you run outta toilet paper.

Misae:
Are you trying to be nice or are you just trying to piss me off!
Why are you being so weird, huh?
I bet Yuki and Saki put you up to this.

Katsuki:
Oh, could you tell?

Misae:
You're not the type to use cheesy pick-up lines like that.
Why don't you try saying something from the heart instead?

Katsuki:
Uh, let's see... I'm sorry.

Misae:
Why are you apologizing this time?

Katsuki:
Because... because I think it's probably my fault that you're sad, at least on some level.

Misae:
What's that supposed to mean?
What makes you think you did something wrong?
Wait, I take that back. You've done pretty much everything wrong.

Katsuki:
I'm really sorry!

Misae:
Anyway, it's not all the stupid stuff you've done that I'm depressed about.
This really has nothing to do with you.

Katsuki:
I see.

Misae:
Wait, don't tell me you're thinking this is your big chance to make me fall in love with you.
Like we were talking about yesterday, I mean.

Katsuki:
That's not fair, Misae. I wasn't thinking about that at all.

Misae:
No, you're right.
You just came here to do me a favor like you said before.
You're not in love with me or anything.
You're just doing what you think is right, aren't you?

Katsuki:
That's not true, either!

Misae:
Huh? Well, okay, then.
So I guess you are in love with me after all?

Katsuki:
I guess.

Misae:
Well, that settles it.

Misae:
By the way, what do you like about me?

Katsuki:
Even if you scold me all the time, I know it's only because you care about me.
Oh, and when you do those wrestling moves on me, you smell really nice and sweet.
I like that.

Misae:
I think I could have done without that last part.

Katsuki:
Sorry.

Misae:
You don't need to apologize.
Um... Thank you.

Katsuki:
You're welcome. My pleasure.


Saki:
Misae!

Yuki:
Hey, you free today?
I hear there's a new ice cream parlor across from the station.
You wanna go check it out with us?

Misae:
Sorry, I can't go today.
Look, he's been waiting out there all day.
I'd feel bad if I left him hanging and went off with you guys. See ya!

Saki:
It looks like those two are getting along.

Yuki:
She sure perked up, that's for sure.


Katsuki:
Student council president?

Misae:
That's right. I know it doesn't seem like it, but that's me.
And the first female president at the school, too.

Katsuki:
Wow, Misae, that's amazing!

Misae:
The Autumn Festival is right around the corner.
I have to help out at the school, so I'm afraid I'm a little busy right now.
Sorry, I wish we could spend a bit more time together.

Katsuki:
Autumn Festival?

Misae:
By the way...

Katsuki:
Hm?

Misae:
I was thinking if you weren't too busy, maybe you and I could check it out together.
Like a date.


Katsuki:
Hey, guys. I don't think she's gonna fall for this.

Saki:
Don't worry. You look great.

Katsuki:
I see. Misae's busy today, huh?

Saki:
Yup. She's got another student council meeting.

Yuki:
So she told us to tell you that she was going to be late.

Katsuki:
Hm... I wish I could see her at work.
I bet she's really cool.

Yuki:
Seriously, he turned out so cute.
It's kinda starting to piss me off.

Yusuke:
I love you, baby. You drive me crazy.

Saki:
Don't worry, that's just Yoshino.

Yuki:
And he's popular with the ladies as usual.

Guy:
Hey there. What class are you in?
Are you a transfer student? Haven't seen you, dear.
How about I give you a little tour of the school?

Saki:
Oh, uh... Thanks, but no thanks.
Actually, she's with us.

Yuki:
You don't need to go to the trouble.

Guy:
Ah, come on, ladies. Don't be shy.
It's not like I'm hitting on her, I'm just trying to be nice.

Saki:
Really, I think we're fine.

Yuki:
Run away. This is your chance.

Guy:
Tell me your name. What class are you in?

Saki:
I'm telling you we're fine now.

Guy:
Hey, wait a second! Come back! I just wanna talk!


Misae:
Next on the agenda.

Katsuki:
Huh?

Misae:
Students bringing in guitars and making noise in the classrooms.
I don't mind if they wanna sing quietly, but maybe they should apply for a...

Katsuki:
She's so cool.

Kouko:
Do you have some business with the student council?
There's no need to be shy. You can go inside if you like.
There's no rule against it, they're just having a meeting.

Katsuki:
Um, yeah, but I...

Kouko:
Excuse me. Sagara.

Misae:
Oh, Miss Ibuki.

Kouko:
I'm sorry for interrupting. This girl wants to talk to you.
Go on. Speak up.

Misae:
Hm? Oh my gosh, you're so cute.
Sorry if I kept you waiting too long.

Katsuki:
No, it's fine. Th-Thank you.

Misae:
Anyway, what did you want to talk about?
Don't hold back, you can say anything.
It's the student council's job to listen to whatever the students have to say.

Katsuki:
I, uh...

Misae:
Mm-hm?

Katsuki:
I'll just say it, then.
Misae, I want to spend the rest of my life with you right by your side.

Kouko:
I'm sorry, what kind of relationship do you two have?

Katsuki:
Uh... I think I'd better go!


Saki:
Well, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen!

Katsuki:
It's not funny at all.
I wonder if she knew that was me or not.

Yuki:
It's alright, don't worry.

Saki:
But that made me wonder, do you think Misae likes you better that way?

Katsuki:
I hope that's supposed to be a joke.
Huh? Oh, that's right. I'd forgotten.

Saki:
Hey, Shima. Are you busy right now?

Katsuki:
Huh?

Yuki:
Saki and I were cooking up a little plan, that's all.
If you're not busy, could we go over to your house, please?

Katsuki:
What?


Saki:
I see. Misae hasn't been to your house yet?
That's funny.

Yuki:
Wow, you know?
I was gonna brag about going over to Shima's house while she was at school, but this is even better.

Saki:
Is something wrong? We don't have to tell Misae?

Katsuki:
No, that's not it.
For some reason, I can't remember where my house is.

Saki:
Hey, come on. It's right over here.

Yuki:
Don't joke around like that. It's not funny. Jeez.

Katsuki:
Huh?

Katsuki's mother:
Oh, hello. May I help you?

Yuki:
Hello!

Saki:
Hey, what's wrong? Stop spacing out and say hello!

Katsuki's mother:
I see, are you Katsuki's friends?

Yuki, Saki:
Yes, ma'am.

Katsuki's mother:
I didn't know. Thank you for coming all this way.
Make yourselves at home.
You can offer him some incense at the altar if you like.

Yuki, Saki:
Hm?

Katsuki:
That's right. I remember now.
The real Katsuki Shima isn't here anymore.
I... I'm not actually Katsuki Shima.

Yuki:
Hey, wait!



Yuki:
Hey, Shima. What's going on?

Saki:
It's okay if you don't wanna tell us.

Yuki:
Yeah, is there anything we can do for you?

Saki:
Hey, at the very least, remember this.
We believe you. We know you must have your reasons.
It doesn't matter what happened. To us, you're the one and only Shima.

Yuki:
That's right.
You're still our friend and that's all that matters.

Katsuki:
Thank you.

Saki:
Don't worry. We won't say anything to Misae.

Yuki:
You can tell her whatever you need to tell her.
We'll leave it up to you.

Katsuki:
Mm...

Katsuki:
I finally remembered. I'm not Katsuki Shima at all.
He was someone very special to me. Someone I spent a long time with.
I can see his face, I remember his words.
But he's gone now. He entrusted me with his final wish.
The reason I came here was to grant him that wish.
And now that I've seen the world through his eyes, I understand why it was so important.


Misae:
You finally made it.

Katsuki:
Yah. Sorry, I'm late.

Misae:
No, it's fine.
The way I see it, it's your turn to make me wait for a change.

Misae:
That girl at the meeting yesterday was you, right?

Katsuki:
You figured it out?

Misae:
Of course I did.
We see each other every day.

Katsuki:
I'm sorry. Was I bothering you?

Misae:
It's fine.
I bet Yuki and Saki put you up to it anyway.

Misae:
A wish?

Katsuki:
Uh-huh. I can't forget. That's the reason I came here.
Look. Inside this, there's a light that grants wishes.
Oh, no. It's gone.

Misae:
Maybe there wasn't anything in there to begin with.
Maybe that means I don't need a wish after all, or maybe it's already been granted.
Either way, let's not dwell on this whole wish thing.
All that matters is that we're both happy.

Katsuki:
But this... this is really important.

Misae:
Well, if you insist... Oh, I know!

Katsuki:
Did you think of something?

Misae:
Mm-hm. I sure did.
'Kay, this is it. Here comes the wish you've been dying to hear for so long. Ready?

I wish... for you to stay by my side and love me forever.

Katsuki:
Huh?

Misae:
Just like you said, I want you here.
Loving me and caring for me forever and ever.
So there you have it. My wish.

Misae:
I'm sorry. Did I surprise you?

Katsuki:
I love her. I love her so much.
I know we didn't spend long together, but every moment was priceless.
I like Yuki and Saki, too.
All these memories, I really wish the four of us could stay together forever.

Misae:
I was just copying what you said yesterday, you know?
Come on, why are you crying so much?

Katsuki:
I'm sorry.

Misae:
I really have to look after you, don't I?

Katsuki:
Misae.

Misae:
Hm?

Katsuki:
Thank you...
Thank you so much for everything.

Misae:
Uh, I... I'm going to get something to drink, okay?
I'll be right back.


Misae:
Why is he... Shima! Shima!
I don't... What are you saying?
Shima, wait!

Katsuki:
Goodbye, Misae. I'm sorry.
I'll do my best to grant your wish.
My feelings will never fade. I'll love you forever and ever.


Misae:
Yah, I came back.
That's right, the boys' dorm.

Misae:
No, I don't have any plans like that right now.
It's not 'cause I'm still thinking of him. It's just, you know...
Well, what can you say? Like it or not, that's my life, right?
Mm. Of course. I'd love to meet up some time. We'll invite Yuki, too. Bye.

Don't suppose there's much hope of getting rid of you at this point.
Do you like being with me that much?
I'm not really at all fond of cats, to be honest with you.

It can't be...
Wow, I almost got lost in a fairy tale for a second there.
You're a weird cat. You know that?


Nagisa:
Tomoya. Tomoya, wake up.

Misae:
I never knew you and the cat had so much in common.

Nagisa:
It's getting late, Tomoya. We should get going.

Tomoya:
Yeah.

Nagisa:
Thank you so much.
I'm sorry we ended up staying so late.

Misae:
No, it's fine.
Just make sure you two go to the Autumn Festival like I said.

Nagisa:
Okay!

Tomoya:
Were you the one who showed me that dream?
You already had a name after all, didn't you?
I get it, you want me to tell Misae something for you, right?


Nagisa:
Earth to Tomoya, what's wrong?

Tomoya:
Huh?

Nagisa:
It seems like you've had something on your mind since last night.

Tomoya:
Yeah, there's something I need to tell Misae, but I don't quite know how.

Nagisa:
Huh?
Misae's kitty came to the festival, too!

Tomoya:
So what's the deal?
Don't tell me you have something else you wanna say.

Misae:
Furukawa! And her boyfriend!

Nagisa:
Oh, Misae! Glad you could make it!

Misae:
Oh, thank goodness you caught him.
Ooh, I'm outta breath.

Tomoya:
I have a name, you know.
You don't have to call me Furukawa's boyfriend.

Nagisa:
I have to admit, Misae, it's pretty strange bringing your cat to a festival.

Misae:
You got it all wrong.
He ran out of the dorm all of a sudden and wouldn't stop.
I had to chase him all the way to the festival.
Honestly, what was he thinking?

I really have to look after him, don't I?
What's wrong? Get out of there.
Come on. We're going home.

Tomoya:
I'm not surprised.
He probably wanted to come to this festival with you for a long time.
Last night, when I fell asleep at your place, I heard him speaking to me.
He said he was sorry. He wanted to stay with you until the end of the festival.

Misae:
Did he... Did he say anything else?

Tomoya:
Yeah, he also said he'd stay by your side and love you, just like you wished.

Misae:
I don't remember saying I'd take a cat on a date.
You've been so bad, running me around.
But, for once, let's just have fun.

Tomoya:
Also, Misae, there's one more thing he said.

Misae:
Hm?

Tomoya:
He said, no matter what, he wants you to be happy.
Go figure, that's the kinda guy he is. 
All this time, he's been worried about you, Misae.

Misae:
Worried? I see...
I guess you're right. He is that kinda guy.
You were right. I'm not old yet. I should enjoy my youth.

Nagisa:
Tomoya, I don't get it.

Tomoya:
Don't worry. It was just a dream.
I think you'd like to hear about it, though.
It's a little bittersweet, but I think it's a wonderful love story.

Cat:
Katsuki. I hope you can hear me. I have a different master now.
She's kind and sweet, smart and pretty. I love her very much.
But sometimes I worry, is this what you wanted?
Did I fulfill my goal? Was I able to keep my promise to you?
When you told me to grant her wish, was this what you had in mind?
It's been so long. I can't remember anymore. But I don't want this to end.
Please let me stay this way. Please let me be with her. I want to make her wish come true.

I want to stay by her side.
I want to love her, and care for her, forever and ever.



Tomoya:
Little bastard...

Tomoya:
Miyazawa!

Nagisa:
I don't get it. What's he doing?

Tomoya:
It's just a lame excuse to look tough.
In the rare event that he finds someone weaker than him, he can't wait to rub it in their face.

Tomoya:
You've committed yourself to this. Come with us.
