  Sanae:
Ah!

Tomoya, Ushio:
We're home!

Sanae:
Welcome back, you two. Did you have fun on your big trip?

Ushio:
Yup.

Tomoya:
I had a good time, but I'm still waiting on my date with you.

Sanae:
Huh?

Tomoya:
It's not fair to promise a guy a date then not show up.
Such a shame. I was really looking forward to our little vacation together.

Akio:
Hey asshole, you'd better stop hitting on my wife.

Ushio:
Akki!

Tomoya:
Of course, you're coming on our date, too, Ushio. Right?

Ushio:
Yup.

Akio:
Alright, then you can count me in, too.

Sanae:
Perfect! The three of us will have a great time. Right, Tomoya? Ushio?

Akio:
Don't leave me out! I wanna play, too!


Tomoya:
Nagisa...

Sanae:
Hey, Tomoya. Hasn't changed at all, huh?
We've hardly touched this room since she married you and moved out all those years ago.

Tomoya:
Yeah. It's almost like going back in time.

Sanae:
Oh, would you like to take those with you?

Tomoya:
Huh?

Sanae:
The stuffed Dangos I mean. Ushio loves them.

Tomoya:
I've really imposed on you. Please forgive me.

Sanae:
Huh?

Tomoya:
Sorry for forcing Ushio on you all this time.
But I think this little vacation you sent me on taught me a lot. I mean, about being a father.

Sanae:
There's nothing to be sorry about. We didn't do anything special.

Tomoya:
Don't say that. You raised Ushio to be a good girl.
I don't know how to thank you.

Akio:
Okay, next impression is Egawa! Go!

Ushio:
Egawa!

Tomoya:
I hope I can do half as good as you've done raising her.
I'll try my best to do it on my own, to teach her to be strong and kind like her mother.

Sanae:
This really brings back memories.
Akio and I quit our jobs and opened this bakery for Nagisa when she was the same age as Ushio is now.
So good luck. I know you can do it.

Tomoya:
I promise. I'll repay your kindness any way I can.

Sanae:
It's fine. As long as you're happy, that'll be paying me enough.

Tomoya:
Thank you! I'll try to make Ushio happy, too.

Sanae:
Good.

Ushio:
Hey, Daddy!

Tomoya:
Hey, Ushio. What's up?

Ushio:
Akki says he wants to play baseball with you.

Tomoya:
Huh?


Ushio:
You can do it!

Sanae:
Give it your best out there, you two!

Akio:
Humph. Finally decided to wake up, huh?
Welcome back to the world of the living, kid.

Tomoya:
Just shut up and pitch the ball.

Akio:
Ushio, I'll show you what a loser your daddy is.
So you can tease him about it for the rest of your life.

Tomoya:
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

Sanae:
So who do you think is going to win the match, Ushio?

Ushio:
Akki.

Tomoya:
Give me a break!

Akio:
Ha! She's been watching my powerful pitches her entire life.

Tomoya:
Fine. Then I'm gonna show her a home run!

Akio:
Humph. We'll see.

Akio:
Huh?! I'll be damned!

Tomoya:
You see that, Ushio?!

Ushio:
Yup!

Sanae:
That's okay. Nothing a little apology can't fix, right?



Akio:
I couldn't cry, Sanae. You know that.
'Cause you haven't shed a tear since that day yourself.

Sanae:
You know me pretty well, don't you?

Akio:
You bet I do. Who the hell do you think you're talking to?

Sanae:
I had an important job to do. I couldn't cry.
I had to raise Ushio in a way that would make Nagisa proud.
But I'm grateful I had that. Because I had her here, I never lost sight of myself.

Akio:
Five years, huh?
Gotta admit that little girl helped us through some pretty tough times, didn't she?

Sanae:
Yah. She really did.

Akio:
But that's all over now. It's okay.

Sanae:
You're right.

Akio:
You worked hard all these years.

Sanae:
It was nothing. We're family after all.

Akio:
It's all right. Let it go.
You did a fine job. It's your turn to cry now.

Sanae:
Akio...

Akio:
When it feels like there's nothing you can do, I'll be there to help you.
I'll stay by your side until you don't need to cry anymore. So it's okay now. Let it go.


Tomoya:
All right, see you later.

Ushio:
Away we go!

Sanae:
Take care, you two.

Akio:
Yeah. Go get 'em, Ushio!

Ushio:
Okay!

Tomoya:
Who are you gonna go get?

Sanae:
Okay, Ushio. From now on, it's just you and your daddy.
Show him what a good girl you are.

Ushio:
Okay.

Tomoya:
I forgot to ask, but I hope you guys can help me pick her up and drop her off at kindergarten if I get held up at my job.

Akio:
Yeah, just leave it to me.

Sanae:
And the other thing. Have you thought about that?

Tomoya:
It'll be fine. Don't worry. I'll pay him a visit soon.


Principal:
Oh, yes. I heard about your situation from Mrs. Furukawa.
Well I'm glad you could finally make it, Mr. Okazaki.

Tomoya:
Thank you, ma'am. I appreciate it.
Okay, Ushio. Daddy's gotta go to work now.

Ushio:
Okay. Have a nice day, Daddy.

Tomoya:
I will. See you later.

Mother:
Look. That guy over there is Ushio's father.

Mother:
But if he's here, then do you think something happened with the Furukawas?

Mother:
Like a family dispute?

Tomoya:
The old me would have probably lost it by now.
Excuse me. Uh, hi, my name's Tomoya. I'm Ushio Okazaki's father.

Mother:
Oh, hello.

Tomoya:
Due to some extenuating circumstances, my in-laws have been taking care of my daughter for quite a while.
But things worked out and she'll be living with me from now on. Anyway, nice to meet all of you.

Mother:
Thank you. It's nice to finally meet you, too.

Mother:
Ushio's friends with my daughter.
So I'm sure we'll see each other again, Mr. Okazaki.

Mother:
Of course. We'll see you again soon.


Yusuke:
I see. So you decided to live together, huh?

Tomoya:
Yeah. I'm sorry for making you guys worry about me all these years.

Yusuke:
But it must be tough, right?
Raising a little kid like that all by yourself?

Tomoya:
Sanae and the old man got through the diapers and the terrible twos for me, so I should be fine.
Even if things get tough, I'll hang in there. It can't be as bad as what they went through.

Yusuke:
All right. Well, if you run into any problems, just let me know.
I'm sure the company will do whatever it can to help.

Tomoya:
Oh, in that case, there is something...


Ushio:
Daddy!

Tomoya:
Hi, Ushio. You ready to go home? Hello.

Principal:
We're in summer session right now, so Ushio's regular teacher is taking time off.
I'm sorry you can't meet her.

Tomoya:
Taking time off? Oh, is she sick?

Principal:
Oh, no. Nothing like that. Actually, she's going to a child-care seminar.
She should be back next week, I'm sure you'll have a chance to talk to her then.

Tomoya:
Alright, sounds good.

Tomoya:
So tell me. What's your teacher like?

Ushio:
She has real long hair, she's pretty, and she's nice.

Tomoya:
Oh yeah?

Tomoya:
All right. Daddy needs to go back to work now.
If a stranger comes to the door, don't open it no matter what, okay?

Ushio:
Okay.

Tomoya:
Now, if anything happens, you just give Sanae a call.
You know the number of the bakery, don't you?

Ushio:
Uh-huh.

Tomoya:
Don't worry, I'll be back before it gets dark.
I'll see you later.

Ushio:
Bye, Daddy! See ya!



Tomoya:
It's Daddy. My hands are full, can you open the door for me?

I brought a bunch of stuff from the Furukawas.
I got the Big Dango Family, all of your clothes, and your toys, too.

First, let's find a place to put this.
What do you think? Where's a good spot?

Ushio:
Hm... Right here.

Tomoya:
All right then, that works for me.


Ushio:
Daddy, can you cook?

Tomoya:
I'm going to learn to cook starting today.
Let's work on it together, okay?

Ushio:
Okay.

Kouko:
Okazaki!

Tomoya:
Hi, Kouko. Long time no see.

Kouko:
I know it's been years, hasn't it? And who is this?

Tomoya:
She's my daughter, Ushio. It's okay. Say hello, Ushio.

Ushio:
Hello, lady.

Kouko:
Hi there. Nice to meet you. I'm Kouko Yoshino.
She looks just like her mother, doesn't she? Really brings back memories for me...
I bet she'll grow up to be as cute and as brave as her mother, too.
And hopefully she'll have just as many wonderful friends.

Tomoya:
I sure hope so. I wanna give her the best I can.
She used to be Mommy's teacher, Ushio.
By the way, Yoshino told me the news about your little sister.
She's finally out of the hospital, huh? That must be a big relief.

Kouko:
Yes. The doctor said it was a miracle, but we always had faith that she would wake up someday.
We never gave up hope. Actually, my sister's with me right now if you wanna meet her.
Fu-chan!

Kouko:
You don't have to be shy. Go ahead and introduce yourself.

Tomoya:
So, this is your sister, huh?

She's got some sense of humor, doesn't she?

Kouko:
It's okay. Come back. These two are my friends.
There's no reason for you to be afraid.

This is my sister, Fuko. Fu-chan, this is Okazaki, and Ushio.

Fuko:
It's nice to meet you.

Tomoya:
Yeah, nice to meet you, too.

Ushio:
Nice to meet you.

Tomoya:
What now?

Fuko:
She's so cute! Can Fuko hug her, please? Right now?

Tomoya:
Why bother asking if you're gonna do it anyway?!

Kouko:
Fu-chan! You can't do that, it's rude!

Fuko:
Nooo!

Kouko:
Don't be hard on her. She can't help the way she is.

Tomoya:
How old is she by the way?

Kouko:
Believe it or not, she's the same age as you.
I know she may seem a little immature, but she was asleep for an awfully long time.
So she still has the mentality of a high school freshman.

Tomoya:
High school? Are you sure you don't mean kindergarten?

Fuko:
My goodness! You and Okazaki sure do like to pick on poor little Fuko!
But I'll show you, I'm gonna make Ushio my little sister!

Kouko:
Fu-chan, stop it! That doesn't even make any sense!

Fuko:
Then I can sneak her away while you're both confused?

Tomoya, Kouko:
No way.

Fuko:
[Alas, today is lost! / Or else the day is lost!(???)]


Tomoya:
I know she may be a little on the weird side, but aren't you glad you made a new friend today?

Ushio:
Uh-huh.

Tomoya:
By the way, Daddy's taking a day off from work tomorrow.
I wanna go somewhere together, okay?

Ushio:
Are we going on a trip?

Tomoya:
No, not exactly.

Tomoya:
So you love the Big Dango Family, too, huh?

Ushio:
Uh-huh. Sanae told me that it smells like Mommy.

Tomoya:
I see.

Ushio:
This smells good...


Tomoya:
I'm home.

Number seven Bright Tank is the winner. Jockey, Hajime Ishige.
Second place, number eight Uran Max. Third place, number ten, Upgrade.
The payoffs are as follows. Number seven win; 260 yen Quinella, number seven, eight...

Naoyuki:
Hm? Oh, it's you. Hi, Tomoya.

Tomoya:
I'm finally home.

Naoyuki:
Yeah.

Tomoya:
You're looking old, Dad.

Naoyuki:
Yeah.

Tomoya:
This is your granddaughter, Ushio.

Naoyuki:
Oh...

Ushio:
Nice to meet you, Grandpa.

Naoyuki:
Nice to meet you.

Tomoya:
Have you been at home all this time?

Naoyuki:
Mm-hm.

Tomoya:
I went and saw Grandma just the other day.

Naoyuki:
Oh?

Tomoya:
Ushio and I took a trip up north and I spoke to her then.
Do you remember the place? You took me there once when I was little.

Naoyuki:
Hm...

Tomoya:
Grandma told me all sorts of things. About me and you when I was growing up.
It made me realize how difficult it must have been for you.
It also brought back a lot of memories. Listen, Dad. You must be tired, right?

Naoyuki:
Huh?

Tomoya:
Don't you think it's finally time you took a vacation?
Why don't you go back to your hometown? Grandma's waiting for you.
At the place where you took my hand and decided to raise me on your own, all those years ago.

You've worked hard enough, Dad.
You've done more than enough for me. You can rest now.
You can finally go back home. Go and spend some time with your mother. Okay?

Naoyuki:
Uh... Are you sure? It's alright now?

Tomoya:
Is what alright?

Naoyuki:
Have I... Have I done everything I need to do yet?

Tomoya:
Listen, you sacrificed everything you had to raise me. How can you even ask me a question like that?
You gave up your whole life for a worthless son like me.
And in all that time, I never even thought to thank you. You've done enough, okay?

Naoyuki:
Oh, I see... My work was already done. And I never even realized it.
That's wonderful. What a relief. It's over.


Tomoya:
You're all packed.
You've got a change of clothes and I gave you a little money just in case.

Naoyuki:
Thank you. That means a lot.

Tomoya:
I'll give Grandma a call soon to let her know that you're coming.
Just be careful not to lose your bag along the way.

Naoyuki:
Okay. I'll be careful.

Tomoya:
Don't worry. I'll take care of the house.
I'll clear up your debt, too.

Naoyuki:
All right. Thank you.

Tomoya:
Ushio, hey. Say goodbye to Grandpa, okay?

Ushio:
Bye-bye. See you, Grandpa.

Naoyuki:
Bye-bye.

Well, this is it. Thanks again.

Tomoya:
You gotta take good care of yourself, okay?

Naoyuki:
Yeah.

Tomoya:
And don't... Don't drink too much.

Naoyuki:
Yeah.

Naoyuki:
Tomoya. Look, I brought some candy.

Tomoya:
Don't smoke too much either, okay?

Naoyuki:
Yeah.

Naoyuki:
Sorry, but Dad has to go back to work now. Try not to spoil your dinner.

Tomoya:
Live a long and healthy life.

Naoyuki:
I'm sorry I have to leave you alone so much.

Tomoya:
Someday, I'll repay all the kindness you've shown me.

Naoyuki:
Ah, be a good boy, I'll make you dinner when I come home, all right?

Tomoya:
I'll do whatever it takes, okay?

Naoyuki:
Then we can eat together. Right? Tomoya?

Naoyuki:
Huh? Tomoya, what's wrong?
Come on now, why are you crying?

Tomoya:
Uh... I'm sorry, Ushio. Don't worry about me, I'm fine.

Dad. Thank you for everything.

Naoyuki:
Sure. Well, goodbye.

Tomoya:
Yeah. Take care, Dad.

Naoyuki:
Sure, I will. You, too.

Tomoya:
In all those years, I wonder if he was happy.
He lost the only woman he ever loved when his life should have been perfect. And then, all he had was me.
He worked and worked for such an ungrateful son. I wonder... I wonder if he ever found any joy in that.

I'm sorry, Dad...

Tomoya:
Hm? Is something wrong, Ushio?

Ushio:
There's a light...

Tomoya:
A light? Is it too bright? Come here.



Tomoya:
Oh yeah, Ushio. Someone's coming to see you tomorrow.

Tomoya:
Ushio, do you know any games?

Tomoya:
Ushio, say goodbye to Mommy.

Tomoya:
Hey, Ushio! It's dangerous! Wait for me!

Ushio:
Daddy. Good luck.
