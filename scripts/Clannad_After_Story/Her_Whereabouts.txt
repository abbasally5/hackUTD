  "I":
I saw two lights shining. It was only for an instant, but it felt like time had stopped.
They shimmered so brightly I could almost feel their warmth seeping through the window.
In this world of cold, unforgiving winds, something was beginning to change.
Along with the coming of winter, along with the dropping temperature, she was beginning to sleep more often.
The clouds that appeared a few days ago are slowly spreading, casting a shadow over the land.
The clouds will eventually cover this world, and bury the earth in white snow.
The icy winds are already biting at us. If we don't hurry, it will be too late.
I felt that this was the time to make a decision.

The girl:
Oh, hello. You've been here watching over me, haven't you?
Thank you.

Is there something outside? Do you wanna go see?
Careful, winter's coming soon.
If it gets any colder than it is now, I won't be able to move anymore.
Also, if we leave this house now, I have a feeling we won't be able to come back ever again.
Do you still wanna go?
What's out there? What do you wanna see so badly?
A place that's different than this one? A warm place full of secrets? A world where every day is fun?



Tomoya:
Why is there a portable stove in the reference room?

Yukine:
We have a lot more here than just books and reference materials.
We also have a bunch of random things that people don't use anymore.

Youhei:
You're smart, you're cute, and you're great at cooking, too.
On top of that, you're easy to get along with.
Every time I come visit you, it feels like my worries just fade away.

Yukine:
That's very sweet of you to say.
It seems like the three of you are always so cheerly.

Nagisa:
Yup. We're always finding ways to have fun.

Tomoya:
What about you, Yukine?
You're always hold up in there by yourself. Doesn't it get boring sometimes?

Yukine:
No, not at all.
How could I be bored when I have so many visitors all the time?

Tomoya:
Visitors, huh?

What the hell was that about, anyway?

Yukine:
So why did you stop by? What can I help you with?

Youhei:
Yukine, I'm here today to express my untying affection for you.
Although it's only recently that I became aware of my feelings, this love cannot be denied!

Yukine:
I'm flattered that you feel that way.
However, I think you may be more happy finding love with someone a bit better suited to you.

Youhei:
Just like Nagisa, why do girls have to turn me down so fast?!

Sudou:
B-Big Sis...

Yukine:
Sudou!



Yukine:
Poor Sudou. Are you all right?

Sudou:
I screwed up real bad... Because of my stupid asshole, my bros got slaughtered out there.
I can't show my face to 'em, I'm too ashamed. I'm leaving and never coming back here.
This life is over for me. From now on, I'm a lone wolf.
But before I fade away, I had to say goodbye, I had to see your face one last time.
So go ahead and laugh at what a pussy I am.

Youhei:
Hey guys, this is still the school's reference room, right?

Tomoya:
So they say.

Nagisa:
He looks like he's really hurt. Should we call the school nurse?

Yukine:
Please don't say such terrible things.
If you became a lone wolf and faded away, your bros would miss you dearly, Sudou.
And I would, too.

Sudou:
You mean it, Sis?

Yukine:
Now watch, and I'll teach you a little charm. Do this... and this...
Now stay like that, and chant, "I'll always be watching over you" three times.
If you do it, you'll be able to make peace with your bros.

Sudou:
I'll always be watching over you. I'll always be watching over you. I'll always be watching over you.
I feel like I've got the power to live again.

Tomoya:
Quick to recover, isn't he?

Nagisa:
How, what a great charm. I'll have to remember that one.

Yukine:
Now you just have to go apologize to your bros.
No matter how scared you may be, you can't solve anything by running away.

Sudou:
You're right as usual, Big Sis.
My heart got all mixed up, and I don't know what I was thinking.

Yukine:
I'll always tell you; it's no good to get in fights like that.

Sudou:
You're right.
But there're times in a man's life when he's gotta use his fists to speak for his heart.

Tomoya:
Hey guys, hate to interrupt, but I'm kinda lost here.
Could you tell me what's going on?

Yukine:
The truth is...

Sudou:
The truth is, Yuki isn't just like a big sister to our gang.
She's like our boss.

Nagisa, Tomoya, Youhei:
Your boss?

Sudou:
Like a real big sister, she's always looking out for us guys.
Patches us up, body and soul after a fight. And it's not just us, but...

Guy:
Figured I'd find you here, Sudou!

Sudou:
So you're chasing me down, huh?

Guy:
If you thought I'd just let you go, you're even dumber than you look!
Let's do this!

Yukine:
Wait you two!

Guy:
Sorry, Yukine. You're the last person I wanna see suffer from all this crap.
I can't even count the times you've done favors for my pals.

Sudou:
I'm sorry, too, Big Sis. But I can't back down.
This fight is for the sake of my bros and for the sake of our honor.
We'll take this outside! I don't wanna put my big sis through any more trouble!

Guy:
I'm with you on that one! Bye, Yukine. Sorry again.

Sudou:
Big Sis, there's one last thing.
If another idiot like me comes wandering in, then take good care of him for me.
So long!

Yukine:
Sudou, wait!


Yukine:
I know this must seem strange to you, but my older brother is actually the leader of Sudou's gang.

Tomoya:
Now that you mention it, you told me you had a scary brother.

Yukine:
Right now, there're two different gangs fighting for dominance in this down.
There's the gang my brother and Sudou come from.
And then there's the gang that other man in the leather jacket belongs to.
Their turf is separated by the river.
Ever since my brother became the leader of Sudou's gang, the other gang has started to lose ground and can't keep up.
Regardless, they still seem to get into brawls with each other nearly every day.

Nagisa:
If your big brother could turn the whole gang battle around, he must be a really tough guy, huh?

Yukine:
It's hard to say, but apparently, he's never lost a fight.
I do know he keeps his identity and location a secret so that the rival gang can't ambush him.

Youhei:
Ruling the gang from the shadows? That's so cool!

Nagisa:
What's his name?
I mean, if it's not a secret, of course.

Yukine:
It's Kazuto. Kazuto Miyazawa.

Yuu:
Don't move!

Yukine:
Huh?!

Tomoya:
Miyazawa?

Yuu:
You're Yukine, aren't you? Give me back my sister!

Tomoya:
What are you trying to pull?
Are you in the same gang as that guy who...

Yukine:
It's fine, Okazaki. I can handle this on my own.
There we go.

Yuu:
What are you doing?
Put me down! Let me go!

Yukine:
Let's just talk this through now, shall we?
So this sister of yours that you mentioned, do I know her?

Yuu:
Don't play dumb! I know who you are!
I know you're in charge of all those gangs!

Youhei:
Don't act like such a big shot, you little twerp.

Yuu:
Huh? Who are you?
Oh, you're Kazuto Miyazawa, aren't you?

Youhei:
Huh?

Yuu:
I see, you've got blond hair just like the rumors say.
You're the boss on this side of the river, huh? The guy who calls all the shots.

Youhei:
You got it, kid. I'm Kazuto Miyazawa, alright.

Yukine:
Hm? Wait, but...

Youhei:
No, no. Worry not, sweet sister. Let big brother take care of this.
I'm the man who rules this town from the shadows.
You touch Yukine, you answer to me.

Nagisa:
I don't get it. What's he doing?

Tomoya:
It's just a lame excuse to look tough.
In the rare event that he finds someone weaker than him, he can't wait to rub it in their face.

Yukine:
Um, hey, why don't we find a nice, quiet place to talk this through, okay?


Youhei:
I still don't see why we had to come to my room.

Tomoya:
A big shot like you shouldn't sweat the small stuff.

Yukine:
I'm sorry, you said your name was Yuu, right?
I suppose I never had the chance to properly introduce myself.
As you guessed, my name is Yukine Miyazawa. A pleasure to meet you.

Yuu:
Pleased to meet you.

Yukine:
Now these are my friends, Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa.

Tomoya, Nagisa, Yuu:
Pleased to meet you.

Yukine:
You have great manners, Yuu. I'm impressed.

Yuu:
F-Flattery will get you nowhere.

Youhei:
What a letdown.
I was hoping for violence and I get a nice, little chat instead.

Yukine:
Now, Yuu, when we met earlier, you said something about me returning your sister?

Yuu:
That's right. My sister ran away from home and joined your gang.
My best friend's big brother said the gang was run by the Miyazawas and that one of them went to Hikarisaka High School.
So I went there to check it out and sure enough, I ran into you.

Tomoya:
And you're willing to fight a gang boss to get your sister back?

Nagisa:
Oh, what a good boy. You're so brave.

Yuu:
I heard that Kazuto Miyazawa gives his orders from the shadows.
And that no one outside of his gang has ever seen his face.
I figured looking for him was a lost cause, so I came to see his sister instead.

Youhei:
How old is this sister of yours anyway?

Yuu:
Oh, uh... Pretty sure she's twenty-one.
Anyway, I got a phone call from her.
She said she was renting an apartment and then that she wouldn't be coming home for a while.

Tomoya:
Uh, is that something to be worried about?

Youhei:
Oh, Jeez... Look, kid. You've got a sister complex.

Yuu:
Sister what?

Youhei:
When a twenty-one year old moves out, it's not called running away from home.
It's called becoming independent. It's no big deal.

Yuu:
Oh, yeah?
Well, it's a big deal when she's going out with some gangster thug!

Yukine:
Listen, while it may be true that my friends are in a gang, and it may be true that they have a bad reputation, that doesn't mean they're bad people.
They're a bit short-tempered and they fight an awful lot, but they're also chivalrous in a manly sort of way.

Tomoya:
What about us? Do we look like bad people to you?

Yuu:
You do. But this lady looks nice enough, I guess.

Nagisa:
Oh, that's sweet, Yuu. Thank you very much.

Tomoya:
Not cute, kid.

Youhei:
Yuu, you're like a floating dandelion seed.

Yuu:
Huh?

Youhei:
Carried away by the wind on an incredible journey.
You'll go to new places and meet wonderful new people, as well.

Yuu:
Carried away by the wind to new places and new people?

Youhei:
You can't be dependent on your sister for the rest of your life.
Although you may be apart, you still share a bond.
That's what being family is all about!

Yuu:
Wow...

Tomoya:
That's a pretty impressive lecture coming from him.

Nagisa:
He just went through some sister troubles himself.
I'm sure he's giving this sort of thing a lot of thought.

Yukine:
Yuu, I'm sure you're still worried about where your sister ran off to.
I'll try talking to some of my friends to see if anyone knows where she's staying right now.
Does that sound good to you?

Yuu:
All right. Thanks.
I really hope you can find my sister for me.
I'm counting on you, Yukine.

Yukine:
All right, I promise I'll give it everything I've got.

Tomoya:
Somehow, looks like everything worked out nicely.

Nagisa:
Miyazawa's so easygoing, I don't think anyone can stay mad at her.
She's really something.



Tomoya:
Remind me, why is this happening again?

Youhei:
Yuu here is gonna follow me around and at the end learn what it means to be a real man.
He's got spirit, I'll tell you that much. He even skipped school.

Yuu:
Teach me your secrets, master!

Youhei:
Sure, just watch and learn, kid.
I'd like to teach by example. You ready to man up?

Yuu:
Yes, sir!

Tomoya:
Mmm...


Yuu:
Hm? Master, I think the bell just rang.

Youhei:
Oh, yeah. I guess it did.

Yuu:
Isn't class starting?

Youhei:
As long as you do what you're supposed to do, you don't need to go to class.
Got it? That's rule number one.

Yuu:
Does he do what he's supposed to do?

Tomoya:
Not even close.

Youhei:
Neither do you!

Tomoya:
I'll have you know I've been going to class every day for weeks.
I'm just hanging around 'cause you two need my help.

Yuu:
If you don't go to class, does that mean you guys are deadbeats?

Tomoya:
One of us is a deadbeat, but it's not me.

Youhei:
Don't say that out loud! You're ruining my reputation as an educator!

Tomoya:
What exactly were you teaching him again?

Youhei:
You've heard of negative exemplum, right?
I was using that kind of technique to teach him.

Tomoya:
Er, do you even know what that means?

Youhei:
Not really. I just heard it on TV.
But it sure does sound cool, doesn't it?

Tomoya:
Hey, I think someone's coming.

Teacher:
Is somebody in here?

Tomoya:
Give me a break.
That's the best hiding spot he could find?

Teacher:
Class is already starting.

Youhei:
Sorry, I was playing hide-and-seek with some friends of mine and I guess I lost track of the time.

Teacher:
Hide-and-seek? And where are your friends right now?

Youhei:
Hey, Okazaki! It's time for class!

Tomoya:
Little bastard...


Nagisa:
What happened? Did you get in trouble?

Tomoya:
Nah, not really.
They just dragged us to the office and lectured us half to death.

Youhei:
I wasn't about to take one for the team when he was skipping class, too.

Yuu:
Hey, is this supposed to teach me how to be a man?

Tomoya:
As a negative exemplum, I'd say he's doing a great job.

Youhei:
Gee, thanks!

Yukine:
Good news. I was able to get in touch with them.
Not only that, they know where your sister is staying right now.

Yukine:
Your sister wants to see you, too, so we can stop by right now if you want.
The place where she hangs out isn't too far from here, so I'd be happy to show you the way.

Yuu:
Thanks a lot, Yukine. You're the best.

Youhei:
Good for him, but we don't have to tag along, do we?
I don't wanna get stuck in the middle of another big fight.

Tomoya:
I'm sure the big shadow boss could handle a brawl just fine.
Isn't that right, Kazuto?

Yuu:
If some bad guys show up, I know you can beat them, Kazuto.
I'm not scared.

Youhei:
Well, it might not hurt to be a little scared.


Nagisa:
I'm worried, I've never been to a place like this.

Yukine:
No need to worry.
They may look tough, but I assure you they're all quite kind.

Youhei:
I just thought of something.
As soon as those thugs see me, Yuu is gonna find out that I'm not really Yukine's brother after all!

Tomoya:
Really? It took you that long to realize that?

Youhei:
I'm leaving!

Tomoya:
You dug your own grave. Now let's go.

Yukine:
Hello, everyone.

Guys:
Hey, Big Sis! Hey, what's up?
Long time no see, Sis!

Yukine:
It seems like all of you are doing well.

Yuu:
There you are!

Yuu's sister:
Yuu!

Yuu:
I was so worried. Why'd you run away?

Yuu's sister:
I'm sorry. I know you must have been scared, but I'm doing fine.

Woman:
Is this kid your little brother? He's adorable!

Guy:
He may be a pipsqueak now, but he's got the look of a real man.

Guy:
What do you say we celebrate with a round of drinks?

Yukine:
No alcohol. He's underage.

Guy:
Oh, is he? That's a shame.

Nagisa:
Sudou's here. I guess that means he was able to make peace with all the guys.

Tomoya:
I still can't believe how popular Miyazawa is.

Tajima:
It's no surprise, since Big Sis Yuki takes care of folks no matter what side of a fight they're on.
I can't even count how many times she saved my ass when I was hurt.

Tomoya:
Oh, wait. I know you.

Tajima:
Yeah. Sorry, I couldn't introduce myself back then.
I was having a tough time.

Nagisa:
It's fine. We know it's not your fault.

Tajima:
Hm? Do I see someone else hiding over there?

Youhei:
Oh, no. No one worth mentioning at least.

Yuu:
Hm? Hey, Kazuto. What are you doing?

Tomoya:
Wh-What?

Tajima:
Little punk, you trying to make a move on our Big Sis Yuki?!

Youhei:
No, sir! No, sir! I'm just her friend, I swear!

Yuu:
Does that mean he's not Kazuto Miyazawa after all?

Yuu:
No way! You were lying all this time?!

Youhei:
L-Look guys, it's the Drama Club thing, that's all.
I-I was just honing my craft for a play.

Guy:
What gives you the right to throw around Kazuto's name, arrogant prick?!

Guy:
If you weren't pals with our big sis, we'd string you up and hang you out to dry!

Yuu's sister:
Come on, you guys. I owe him for looking after my little brother.
You can forgive him for my sake, can't you?

Yuu:
Besides, it looks like he's really sorry.

Youhei:
You guys are like family to me! I'll never forget this!

Yukine:
Yesterday, I had a long talk with Yuu before he went home.
He said his parents and his sister weren't getting along very well before she moved out.
Apparently, his mother and his sister got into a big fight about something.
And that was why she decided to leave the house.
It was no surprise. Many of the people here aren't on good terms with their parents.
They don't feel like they belong with their family, so they make a new home for themselves in places like this.

Nagisa:
They may look like a gang to some people, but to each other, they're probably more like family, right?

Yukine:
My brother felt that way.
He was never very close to our parents, so he had to find somewhere to belong.

Tomoya:
Someone once told me that you need a family to keep yourself on the right path.
In her case, she didn't mean your real family, either.
She was on bad terms with her parents, too. They had just gone through a messy divorce.

Yukine:
What happened to her? Is she all right now?

Tomoya:
She went through a lot, but it seems like her family is on good terms these days.

Yukine:
I see. That's good to hear.


Guy:
I was wrong. You're a pretty funny guy after all.

Youhei:
Y-You think so?

Yukine:
Here you go.

Tomoya:
Huh? Oh, thank you.

Nagisa:
Thanks, it looks delicious.

Yukine:
You're welcome.

Nagisa:
So, uh, will Kazuto be stopping by? I'd like to meet him.

Yukine:
No, my brother is...

Sudou:
I'm afraid Kazuto is in the hospital right now.
He was hit by a car when he was trying to save one of his bros.

Tomoya:
Wow, sorry to hear that.

Tajima:
Before he got hurt, Kazuto used to do some work for the barkeep here.
Now we're taking care of the place for him until he can come back.

Yukine:
We do what we can. I help out in the kitchen whenever I have the time.

Nagisa:
The more I hear about Kazuto, the more I wanna meet him.
He sounds wonderful.

Sudou:
That's right. Kazuto's like a brother to all of us.
He doesn't just hold us together, he helps keep us on track, too.

Tomoya:
Do you have a picture handy?
I'm kinda curious to see what he looks like.

Yukine:
I'm afraid I don't have any pictures, but if it's any consolation, people are always telling me that we look alike.

Tomoya:
Is that true?

Yukine:
Yes.

Tomoya:
Huh...


Nagisa:
That sure was fun, wasn't it?

Youhei:
Think I had a few years shaved off of my life.

Tomoya:
Hey, look on the bright side.
You got a taste of what it feels like to be a big shadow boss, right?

Guy:
It's Kazuto Miyazawa!

Youhei:
Huh?! M-Me?!

Guy:
So we finally get to see your face, huh?
Didn't know you were out of the hospital.

Guy:
We'll make you sorry you ever crossed us!

Youhei:
Y-You got it all wrong!

Yukine:
Everyone, wait! This isn't him!

Guy:
I'm sorry, Yukine, but there's no stopping us now.
Careful, guys. Don't hurt Yukine or the other girl. Go!

Tomoya:
This is bad, run away!

Youhei:
Ah, wait!

Guys:
Hey, get back here! Come on, dude!

Guy:
Wha... What the hell just happened?

Guy:
What, does that really... Kazuto Miyazawa?

Guy:
He's a monster... No human is that strong...

Tomoyo:
Picking a fight was bad enough.
You don't have to insult me on top of that.

Nagisa:
Thanks, Tomoyo! You saved us!

Tomoya:
Yeah, thanks. But what the heck are you doing here?

Tomoyo:
I heard there have been a lot of violent incidents happening around here lately.
I thought it would be bad if one of our students got involved, so I was patrolling the area.
But never mind that. Why would a bunch of gang members be targeting you guys?

Nagisa:
It's a long story, I don't quite know where to start.

Youhei:
So now that they've got the wrong idea, what are we supposed to do?

Tomoya:
That's a good question...



Tomoya:
What about your brother? Does he even know what's going on right now?
Sure, he's in the hospital, but he can still reason with his gang over the phone, can't he?

Tomoyo:
If I were you, I would stop all this silly fighting and resolve your differences while you still can.
If you don't, then both sides are going to suffer.

Nagisa:
If Kazuto told them to stop fighting, they'd listen, right?
