  "I":
A world completely swallowed in light. What is this place? What am I doing here?
No, I remember I was with her. We were all alone in this sad, desolate world.
But we were going to some place, weren't we? We had something very important to do.



"I":
If I had known this was going to happen, I wouldn't have taken her with me.
In the end, all I did was make her suffer.

Tomoya:
That's right. It all started when I spoke to her that day.
Maybe I shouldn't have said anything.
If she hadn't met me, then she wouldn't...

"I":
I don't want this to be the end of our journey. I don't want to stop now.
Even if there's no hope for us, I don't want to accept that.
I don't want to let her fall asleep in a cold, lonely place like this.

The girl:
Hey...
You're still there, aren't you?

"I":
Of course I am. I'll stay by your side forever.

The girl:
Thank you... so much.

"I":
Huh?

The girl:
I can hear your voice, after all this time.

"I":
Really?

The girl:
I feel my humanity slipping away. I think that's why I can finally hear you.
I had a dream just now, lying in the snow.
I found out a lot of things. Things about you, things about me... Want me to tell you?

"I":
Mm-hm.

The girl:
We were from the same world, you and I.
We were very close to each other long ago. No. Actually, we're still close, even now.

"I":
Wait, then that means we don't belong in this world after all.
Let's go back together!

The girl:
Sorry. That sounds wonderful, but I have to stay here.

"I":
Why?

The girl:
Because I'm not just another part of this world; I'm the world itself.

"I":
I don't understand.
You said we'd leave this world together, didn't you? You promised.

The girl:
If I leave this place, then the entire world will disappear.
If that happens, all the lights will turn from hope to sorrow.

"I":
Lights? The lights that are floating in the air?

The girl:
Yes. Each one of them represents the hope of someone in the other world.
You were one of those lights yourself.
The world so close, yet so far away. Do you remember now?
We've always been there you and I. In the same town, in the same place.
I see. It's been so long that you must have forgotten.

"I":
Another world? And there's another me there?

The girl:
You haven't realized it yet?
Even though you came from the other world, even though you exist there now, we were able to meet because you overcame the distance between our worlds.
That was more than enough for me.
Soon you're gonna disappear from this place, and wake up in the other world.
But don't worry. Once you're there, you'll meet many wonderful people and experience many wonderful things.
And finally, you'll see me again, too.

"I":
We'll meet again? In the other world?

The girl:
Just as people's hopes and wishes appear as lights in this world, my hopes and wishes appear as lights in their world.
I'm sure the other you has seen them, just as you have.
Although each light may be small in itself, if you gather enough of them together, then something truly amazing is gonna happen.
Something miraculous.

"I":
Wait, I know that song.

The girl:
You should. It's the song you always sang to me.

The girl:
Until we meet again, Daddy.


Tomoya:
NAGISA!

Nagisa!
Nagisa! I'm right here! Don't leave me!

Nagisa:
You had me worried.
For a second there, I was afraid you wouldn't talk to me.

Tomoya:
I'm sorry.

Nagisa:
At first, you didn't say anything.
I was starting to think you might keep walking away, like you wish we'd never met in the first place.
I hope that wasn't true, though.
Meeting you, was the best thing that ever happened to me. You made me so happy.

Tomoya:
Nagisa.

Nagisa:
I don't want you to be lost or afraid or anything like that.
From here on out, I know things might be hard sometimes.
But no matter what, please don't ever regret the time we spent together.
Is that too much to ask?

Tomoya:
I won't regret a thing.
Thank you.


Nagisa:
If you'd like... shall I take you to the place in town where wishes come true?

Ah... My long journey has finally come to an end...


Tomoya:
N-Nagisa? Nagisa...

Nagisa:
Tomoya...

Tomoya:
Nagisa!

Nagisa:
Is something wrong, Tomoya? You look upset.

Tomoya:
We're really... We're really together now, right?

Nagisa:
Of course we are. We'll always be together.
Just like we promised over and over again, I'm not going anywhere.

Tomoya:
That's right. Just like we said.

Yagi:
Okazaki. You don't need to worry about the health of the baby or the mother.
Good job. Congratulations.

Akio:
Congratulations to you, too. You did good.

Sanae:
Tomoya. How would you like to give little Ushio her first bath?

Tomoya:
Ah, sure!

Yagi:
Support her head with your right hand.
Cover her ears so she doesn't get any water in them.
That's right. Nice and slow. Does that feel good, Ushio?
Now don't dip her head in just yet. You need to wipe her down with gauze first.
There you go. Daddy's getting you all clean. Aren't you a happy baby?

Nagisa:
Good job, Tomoya. You did great.

Sanae:
Look at that. As healthy as can be.

Nagisa:
When she get's bigger, I hope she's as strong as she is now.

Tomoya:
She will be.
She'll have a strong body and a strong mind, too. Don't worry.

Nagisa:
'Kay.
Hey Tomoya. Look outside. Open the curtain. It's so pretty.

Tomoya, Akio, Sanae:
Huh?

Tomoya:
What? You mean the snow? No, wait. This is...



Nagisa:
Dango, dango, dango, dango, dango, dango, dango family.

Nagisa, Tomoya:
Dango, dango, dango, dango, dango, dango family.

Nagisa:
Sometimes I wonder, what if this town was alive?
What if it had thoughts and feelings like one of us?
If it did, I think it would want to make the people who live here happy.
When I look at how things have turned out for you and me, I feel like the town might have brought us together.
Then it might have made this miracle happen.

But even if it's wonderful, I guess it's not really a miracle, is it?
After all, this sort of thing happens every day.
People who live here love this town and may find happiness here all the time.
Even if it doesn't have thoughts, I think this town is still alive in its own way.
I think it still loves the people who live here.
I've grown up in this town. All of my memories and dreams are a part of it. In a way I feel like it raised me.

Tomoya:
So this town is like one big family, huh?

Nagisa:
Yup. The Big Dango Family.

Tomoya:
Yeah. I think I'm finally starting to get that.



Kouko:
Don't be so upset.

Fuko:
Fuko is very upset!
That guy was so rude. I'm not a grade-schooler, I'm a grown lady!

Kouko:
Grown lady or not, you're still short.
You can't blame him for making an honest mistake.

Fuko:
I may be short, buy my mature personality should have made it clear to him.

Kouko:
Fu-chan, I don't think your personality is as mature as you think it is.

Fuko:
Those words sting, like an icy dagger through my heart.
Fuko is traumatized now. Fuko is damaged goods!

Kouko:
You shouldn't say strange things like that.

Fuko:
You're not Fuko's mom!

Kouko:
Ah, maybe that's it.
People probably think you're a grade-schooler because you call yourself "Fuko" like that all the time.

Fuko:
Then what should Fuko call herself? "This girl"... maybe?
You know, this girl is grown up in more ways than one. Like that?
That's so dirty!

Kouko:
You really shouldn't complain when you're the one who said it, not me.
You call yourself "I" sometimes, so just go with that.

Fuko:
"I", huh? I guess...
Listen up, boys. I'm grown up in more ways than one. Like that?
That's so dirty!

Kouko:
I hate to break it to you, but that's going to sound dirty no matter how you say it.

Fuko:
Whatever. Fuko is getting hungry.

Kouko:
Giving up already, huh?

Fuko:
I wanna go to a family restaurant.

Kouko:
Okay. We'll go after your doctor's appointment.

Fuko:
I don't need a doctor. There's nothing wrong with me.
It's settled. We're going to eat now!

But we have to go fast or they're going to run out of hamburger steak!

Kouko:
Not so fast!

Don't worry about it, I'm sure they have plenty!

Fuko:
What if everyone in town has been eating hamburger steak three times a day?!
Then what do we do?!

Kouko:
Trust me, I don't think that's going to be an issue.

Kouko:
Come on, we're almost at the hospital.
If they run out of hamburger steak, I'll make you some myself.

Fuko:
But will you put it on a metal plate so it doesn't get cold?

Kouko:
Of course. Anything you want.

Fuko:
Then I guess I have no choice.

Kouko:
I know you don't feel like anything's wrong, but just to make sure, you have to have a little checkup every now and then.
Please, just humor me. I'll feel a lot better if I know that you're healthy, okay?

Fuko:
I didn't know I was making you worry so much.

Kouko:
Huh? Nothing for you to get upset about.

Fuko:
You can dissect Fuko if it'll make you feel better!

Kouko:
Fu-chan, stop!

Fuko:
Come on, you're waking like an old lady!
Let's get a move on already!

Kouko:
Quite a handful, aren't you?

Kouko:
Now what's gotten into you, Fu-chan?

Fuko:
I smell something.

Kouko:
Hamburger steaks?

Fuko:
You ruined it! That's not what you're supposed to say!

Kouko:
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were trying to tell a joke.

Fuko:
It's not a joke.
Alright, now I'm gonna say it again and this time, you ask me what I smell.

Kouko:
Okay, okay.

Fuko:
I smell something!

Kouko:
What do you smell?

Fuko:
Thank you for asking, dear sister. I think this smell is a cute smell.

Kouko:
Okay, but that doesn't answer my question.

Fuko:
I was hoping you could catch my meaning.

Kouko:
Meaning?

Fuko:
Don't you get it? This is art!

Kouko:
You're talking nonsense again, Fu-chan.
Do you even know what you're saying?

Fuko:
I guess since you were a school teacher, you have a tough time thinking outside the box.

Kouko:
Sure, I was a teacher. Do you know what taught?
Art, like you said.

Fuko:
In that case, try to get a grasp of what I'm saying.

Kouko:
I don't think there's anything to grasp.

Fuko:
Hm... You think so? In that case, let me try to put it in simpler terms.
I'll start over, and you ask me what I smell again.

Kouko:
Okay. Got it.

Fuko:
Someone is coming!

Kouko:
Huh?

Fuko:
Don't say "Huh"!

Kouko:
I thought you changed the scenario.
Was I supposed to say "What do you smell?" that time, too?

Fuko:
That's right.

Kouko:
But that would seem a little unnatural, don't you think?

Fuko:
Just go with it! I promise I'll follow you, okay?
Now take it from the top.

Kouko:
Okay.

Fuko:
Someone is coming!

Kouko:
Oh, what do you smell?

Fuko:
I see... She probably came to see Fuko.

Kouko:
You just said that you were going to follow me, remember?

Fuko:
But the point here is that someone came to see me.
You're supposed to act more surprised in a scenario like this.

Kouko:
Dear god. I know my sister is strange, but I hope she can make friends.

Fuko:
Now, from the top!

Kouko:
Your wishes, my command.

Fuko:
Someone is coming!

Kouko:
Oh, what do you smell?

Fuko:
I see... She probably came to see Fuko.

Kouko:
Oh! That's quite a surprise!

Fuko:
Hm... She smells cute.

Kouko:
This conversation doesn't make any sense!

Fuko:
She's sleeping right over there.
She's waiting for someone to find her and wake her up!
This is my chance. I'd better hurry!

Kouko:
Fu-chan! Where are you going?!

Fuko:
Don't just stand there! If you wanna see her, come with me!
She's under that tree right there!

Kouko:
Who's under the tree?

Fuko:
Fuko doesn't know, but she's very cute whoever she is!

Kouko:
Fu-chan! Fu-chan!
Really, what am I gonna do with her...

Fuko:
Are you there? It's me, Fuko.
Well, you probably don't know who I am since we haven't met before. What's your name?
I bet you and I can be good friends. Come on, let's play together!
This is no time to be sleeping. After all, the fun is just getting started!



Nagisa:
If you say so, but it took me a long time to make friends with everyone in my junior year.

Akio:
But you didn't make any new friends in class, huh?

Nagisa:
I couldn't really talk to anyone, so I was kind of lonely, I guess.

Kimura:
Just open up a little and I'm sure you can make plenty of friends.

Nagisa:
I'll try.

Nagisa:
It was my first time talking to her, so I was a little nervous.

Tomoya:
Tomoya Okazaki. What's yours?
