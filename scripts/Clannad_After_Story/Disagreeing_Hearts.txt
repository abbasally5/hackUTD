  Sanae:
I'm Sanako Isogai, 17 years old.
Your big brother is taking very good care of me.

Mei:
Funny, I feel like we've met somewhere before.

Sanae:
This is a small town.
We probably just bumped into each other somewhere or another.

Mei:
You're awful pretty.

Sanae:
That's very sweet of you to say.

Mei:
Huh... A pretty girl like you with my brother?
With my brother... With my brother... You poor thing!

Youhei:
What's that supposed to mean?!

Tomoya:
Looks like Mei doesn't recognize her.
I can't believe the plan's actually working.

Nagisa:
Is it really that hard to believe?
For a second, I didn't know it was Mom, either.

Youhei:
That's it! I'm telling Mom on you!



Mei:
I really do feel like I've met her somewhere before.

Tomoya:
It's only in your head.

Nagisa:
Oh, I forgot to ask, but do you know where Sunohara's taking her?

Tomoya:
They're probably just going out to east first.
Speaking of which, I wonder if he knows any nice restaurants.
Huh? Hey, Nagisa, do you know what used to be here before?

Nagisa:
I don't know. Sorry, but I really can't remember.

Youhei:
Sana... Sanako, you're not, uh, hungry, are you?

Sanae:
Maybe a little bit.

Youhei:
Oh, there's a place right around the corner that I always eat at.
What do you say we pick up lunch there?

Sanae:
That sounds great. I can't wait to see.

Youhei:
This is my favorite place in the whole town.
It's a really nice restaurant.

Mei:
You're kidding, right?

Youhei:
For the record, I recommend the katsudon. I eat it like three times a day.
Now I know the place may look a little high-class, but don't worry, it's not outside of my price range.
Hm?

Sanae:
Do you really eat at this place three times a day?
And always katsudon?

Youhei:
I know it sounds expensive, but I can handle it.

Sanae:
Hm...



Sanae:
Here you go. Lunch is ready.

Youhei:
Yahoo!

Everyone:
Alright, let's eat.
Thanks for the food.

Mei:
Wow, that was super delicious.
But somehow the flavor seems strangely familiar...

Sanae:
Eating nothing but katsudon every day will leave you malnourished.
You should start cooking on your own every once in a while.

Youhei:
Okay!

Mei:
Sanako, you're so sweet and considerate.
And yet... Even though you're so nice and pretty, my brother is...
You poor thing!

Youhei:
Can you stop saying that already?!


Nagisa:
They seem happy, but what are they doing next?

Tomoya:
Oh, probably going shopping or to the movies or whatever.

Mei:
Yeah, some place normal, right?
He wouldn't take a nice girl like her to some place like an arcade.

Mei:
Aw...

Youhei:
Seiya! Seiya! Seiya! Seiya! Seiya! Seiya! Seiya! Seiya!

Mei:
This is just awful...

Tomoya:
No joke.

Nagisa:
On the upside, Sunohara looks really focused.

Youhei:
Seiyaaaaa! Seiyaaaaa! Hi-yah!
What's with this machine? The settings must be all messed up.

Sanae:
Violence isn't the answer, Youhei.

Youhei:
Let's get outta this sorry place.
There's something you gotta hear at the CD shop.

Tomoya:
How is his taste in music?

Mei:
Bad, really bad.


Youhei:
Here we go, I found it!
These guys are my favorite group!

Sanae:
Oh, they look very unique.

Mei:
Aw...

Youhei:
Here, listen.

Sanae:
Wow!

Mei:
He's even more hopeless than usual today.


Sanae:
It's starting to get dark.

Youhei:
What do you mean? The night's still young.
Let's find a place to watch the sunset together!

Mei:
Hasn't he dragged her around town enough today?

Tomoya:
Shouldn't Sanae be getting back to her real lover some time soon?

Nagisa:
Oh, now that you mention it, she should probably start on dinner.

Girl:
No!

Boy:
You're in the way!
I don't care, go away!

Boy:
Get off of this swing!

Girl:
No! Leave me alone!

Tomoya:
Is that bothering you?

Mei:
Yeah.

Nagisa:
Come on, let's go stop them.

Mei:
Hold on a sec.

Sanae:
Hold on, I'll go say something to them.

Youhei:
Don't worry, they'll be fine.

Sanae:
But I...

Youhei:
Come on, it's no big deal.
Kids fight all the time, it's how they grow up.

Mei:
You don't mean that...

Boy:
Hey! Leave my sister alone!

Youhei:
At any rate, it looks like the problem took care of itself.
No point in hanging around now.

Sanae:
Wait a second. Doesn't it seem like something's still bothering them?
Let me go check. I'll be right back.

Sanae:
Good thing I asked.
These two were running an errand for their parents and couldn't find their way back home.
Her brother was trying to figure out where they were when those boys walked up and started picking on her.

Tomoya:
I see, so they're lost?

Sanae:
While we're here, I think we should make sure they make it back safe and sound.

Youhei:
It's no big deal. They'll be fine on their own.

Mei:
Cut it out!

Tomoya:
Come on, you two.

Nagisa:
Um, uh, maybe we should find out their names first.

Sanae:
Oh, alright. What's your name?

Nagisa:
Oh, forgot! She has a little name tag on the front of her dress.

Mei:
That's great! Their address is on the back, too.

Sanae:
Oh, it's right around the corner. Here, I'll lead the way.

Mei:
Aren't you glad? You get to go home now.


Mei:
Turns out it was a lot closer than we thought too.

Sanae:
Uh-huh.

Nagisa:
Their parents were so happy they looked like they were about to cry.

Tomoya:
Stop sulking like a little baby, Sunohara. Get over here.

Sanae:
We didn't make you mad, did we, Youhei?

Youhei:
Nah, it's not that.
Just feels like this stuff put a damper on our date. That's all.

Mei:
Get over it! What's wrong with you?!

Sanae:
Don't be so grouchy, Youhei. It's fine.
In fact, if you don't mind, I'd like to do this again some time.

Youhei:
You mean it?!

Sanae:
I had a lot of fun with you today and I'm very flattered that you treasure our time together so much.
But sometimes, there're more important things to worry about.
So no matter what, you can't lose sight of that, okay?

Youhei:
Y-You got it!


Tomoya:
Huh?

Youhei:
Good morning, Okazaki. All that, and a toilet.

Tomoya:
Well, you're in high spirits today.

Youhei:
Let's go grab some lunch. All that, and a toilet.

Tomoya:
Just the lunch part for me.

Youhei:
I think I'll have a katsudon. All that, and a toilet.

Tomoya:
That's a unique combination.

Youhei:
Oh, but maybe I should hold out, since Sanae told me to eat healthy and stuff.
All that, and a toilet.

Tomoya:
I hate to tell you this, but Mei was still worried about you last night.
She was happy about your fake girlfriend but upset, 'cause you haven't exactly cleaned up your act.

Youhei:
Guess I should start taking my future a little more seriously, huh?
For Sanae's sake, too. All that, and a toilet.

Tomoya:
Is the toilet part just for you or is that for Sanae, too?

Youhei:
When I was little, there were a bunch of things I wanted to be when I grew up.

Girls:
Hey!
Hey, what's up?

Youhei:
A soccer player.

Girls:
Ooh!

Youhei:
A pilot.

Girls:
So cool!

Youhei:
A teacher.

Girls:
He's dreamy!

Youhei:
All that... and a toilet!

Tomoya:
I think that last one's gonna give you some trouble.

Youhei:
I can't do it! This "all that, and a toilet" thing is ruining everything I say!

Tomoya:
Alright, then why don't you just stop doing it?

Youhei:
It was your idea in the first place!

Tomoya:
Are you sure?!

Youhei:
It's fine. I won't get mad today.
As they say, a man in love is forgiving.

Tomoya:
You're in a good mood, huh?

Youhei:
Of course I am. Sanae said she's gonna call me as soon as school is over.
I can't believe it, she must have fallen for me after all.

Tomoya:
Yeah, that's nice and all.
But maybe you should think about how Mei fe...

Youhei:
Hey, if I marry Sanae, and then you get married to Nagisa, we'll be brothers, right?
That's great. I always wanted a little bro!
This... this is good!


Nagisa:
I feel like this is doing more harm than good.

Tomoya:
You may be right.
He seems even stupider than yesterday.

Nagisa:
Hi, Mei. I guess you're waiting for Sunohara?

Mei:
Yup. But wait, he's not with you guys?

Tomoya:
He said he was in a rush to get home.
He didn't wanna miss an important call from his girlfriend.

Mei:
Jeez... He is hopeless, isn't he?


Youhei:
No offense, but could you please go away?

Nagisa:
Hey, Sunohara.

Tomoya:
Your sister came all this way to check on you and you pull that kind of attitude?
What's your problem?

Youhei:
When one is faced with a beautiful thing called love, who has time for a little sister?
Man, I didn't know what I was missing!
And speaking of which, since everything's fine here, why don't you head back home, Mei?

Mei:
I'm not ready to leave yet.
There're still some things I have to do while I'm here.

Youhei:
You still have things you gotta do?
Oh, so that's it, huh?

Nagisa:
What are you guys talking about?

Youhei:
In other words, this whole checking up on her brother thing was just an excuse to have some fun.
She's always liked it here, and then she'll be sticking around back home with the folks. Right?

Mei:
Yeah, that's right.

Youhei:
Told ya!

Mei:
But I'm not just here to have fun.

Youhei:
Hm?

Mei:
I came because I wanted to see my boyfriend, too.

Youhei:
Y-Your boyfriend?!

Mei:
I met him on my last trip here.
He's a little older than me, but he's really mature and really sweet.
He's always talking about how cure I am and he teaches me all kinds of fun stuff.

Youhei:
Wait, where did this come from?

Mei:
When you're in love, who has time for a big brother?

Youhei:
I said wait! Who the hell is this guy?!

Mei:
I'm supposed to meet him right now. I'd better get going.
Sure is nice to have someone who cares for you, isn't it?

Nagisa:
Mei, wait! Come back!

Tomoya:
Hey, you're not gonna let her go like that, are you?

Youhei:
I-I don't know.
If I go after her, I might end up missing Sanae's call.

Tomoya:
Are you still stuck on that?!
What are you gonna do if this guy turns out to be some kinda asshole?!

Youhei:
Yeah, but you can't tell someone who to love.


Mei:
Youhei?

Tomoya:
I'm sorry, I hate to disappoint you.



Tomoya:
I understand you were upset, but don't you think you might have taken it a little too far?
So what now? I feel like you've just made things more complicated.

Mei:
I hate seeing Youhei like that, I don't know what's wrong with him.
Even though I was just pretending, I wanted him to get mad and try to stop me.
He could have hit me for all I care, better than just ignoring me.
It's like he doesn't even care...

When I was little, the kids in the neighborhood used to pick on me.
They were always making me cry, but even if I was upset, I knew my brother would be there to save me.
As soon as I cried out, he'd come running to my rescue just like magic.
He'd yell, "You'd better not make Mei cry!" And all the bullies would scramble.
It made me feel so loved. I didn't have a fear in the world.

When Youhei was in middle school, he started playing soccer.
He was very good at it, too.
I wasn't the only one who depended on him anymore, his whole team did.

It's like he isn't even my real brother anymore.
My real brother wouldn't abandon some poor girl who's being picked on by bullies.
My real brother wouldn't let me go out with some guy he doesn't know.
Okazaki, the girl I saw yesterday isn't really Youhei's girlfriend, is she?

Tomoya:
Well, I can't say I'm surprised you figured it out.

Nagisa:
Um, actually, his girlfriend is my mom. He thinks she's my sister.
I'm sorry for lying, we just didn't want you to worry.

Mei:
That's what I thought...
Jeez... He's hopeless, isn't he? What can I say?
I'm sorry he's so much trouble...

Nagisa:
Oh, no! We don't think of him that way!

Mei:
He really is hopeless...


Tomoya:
Do you have a date with Sunohara again today?

Sanae:
That's right.
After all, I have to make up for what happened last time.

Nagisa:
Now that Mei knows, you don't really have to wear a disguise anymore.

Sanae:
I know, but it's fun and the look is starting to grow on me a bit.

Akio:
Hey, what are you guys up to?
Hm? S-Sanae?!

Nagisa:
Wow, Dad, I'm impressed!
You saw through Mom's disguise in no time flat!

Sanae:
It's nothing bad. I can explain.

Nagisa:
Mom, it's a secret! Shh! Shh!

Akio:
Alright, now you really got me wondering what's going on.

Mei:
We were rehearsing for a play, that's all!

Akio:
A play?

Tomoya:
That's right.

Akio, Mei:
Hm?

Tomoya:
We wanted Sanae to help us, so we were having her try on a couple of costumes.

Akio:
Yeah? Hm...
Are these the only costumes you got to work with? 'Cause it looks like they're all for girls.

Tomoya:
Sanae, get out of here while he's distracted! Hurry!

Sanae:
Oh, okay, see you.

Nagisa:
Oh, uh, I'm not sure yet. We're still brainstorming.

Akio:
Huh? Where did Sanae take off to?

Tomoya:
She, uh, probably got embarrassed and ran away.

Akio:
So cute and innocent. You'd think she's still in high school.
Anyway, what's the story that you play?

Tomoya:
Story? Actually, Nagisa's the one in charge of that.
She's got a bit of writer's block right now, so maybe you can help her out.
In the meantime, we'll, uh, go look for your wife, okay?

Akio:
Sure! Leave it to me!

Nagisa:
Huh?!


Tomoya:
I thought this is where they were supposed to meet up.
Guess I was wrong.

Mei:
I didn't hear the mention or anything, so I'm not sure.
I was just going to tag along with Sanae.

Tomoya:
Whatever, I'm sure we can trust Sanae to take care of things on her and...
Why don't we go out and have some fun for once?

Mei:
Huh?

Tomoya:
Worrying about Sunohara all the time wears you out, right?

Mei:
Hm...


Mei:
That's so cute!

Tomoya:
Get it. It'd look good on you.

Mei:
When you say things like that, it makes me wish you were my brother, you know?

Tomoya:
Are you kidding or do you really mean that?

Mei:
Of course I mean it.

Tomoya:
Alright then, why don't you pretend I'm your big brother?

Mei:
Pretend you're my brother? Okay!
Hey, Big Brother, what's up?

Tomoya:
Hm...

Mei:
What's wrong, Big Brother?

Tomoya:
N-Nothing.
Man, that's some powerful stuff...

Mei:
What are you mumbling about? You're weird, Big Brother.

Tomoya:
Oh! I can't take it! Argh!
Okay! No more "Big Brother" thing, got it?!

Mei:
Why not? Why can't I call you "Big Brother," Big Brother?

Tomoya:
Aaargh! Actually... Huh?
How long have you been... standing there?

Kotomi:
You're not asking Mei to call you "Big Brother," are you?

Kyou:
Not good.

Kotomi:
I think he was getting excited.

Ryou:
Oka... Okazaki...

Tomoya:
Uh, hold on. I-I can explain.

Ryou:
Stay back. We didn't see anything, I swear.

Kyou:
He's gonna infect us, let's run.

Tomoya:
You got it all wrong. Hey! Hold on!

Kyou:
Stay away!

Tomoya:
That's it! No more "Big Brother!"

Mei:
Huh?

Tomoya:
Never mind, say it as much as you'd like.

Woman:
What's up with that guy? Ew!

Woman:
He looks unstable to me.

Mei:
I'm confused, Big Brother. What should I do?

Tomoya:
No! Stop it! STOP IT!!!


Mei:
There's so many options I don't know what to choose.
It must be great living in this city.

Tomoya:
This isn't really a city, but whatever.
It's my treat, okay?

Mei:
Do you mean it?! 'Kay, then I won't hold back.
Oh, there! That's the one I want! I've never seen anything like it!

Tomoya:
Huh? Princess Crepe? I've never seen anything like that, either.
And look at that, uh, price befitting a princess, too. Man, girls are scary...
You sure that's the one you want? The Maharajah Crepe looks pretty good.

Mei:
No, I'm sure.
Please, can I have the Princess Crepe, Big Brother?

Mei:
Aah. It's super-duper yummy.

Tomoya:
And I'm a super-duper chump...

Mei:
Here. Big Brother, you have a try.

Tomoya:
I could have one bite, I guess. Aah.

Mei:
Argh! You ate the only strawberry!

Tomoya:
Yeah, you said I could have some, so...

Mei:
I hate you, Big Brother.

Tomoya:
No, please! Anything but that!

Mei:
Then take a picture with me over there.
If you do that, I'll forgive you.

Tomoya:
No way, that's too lame.

Mei:
My crepe!

Tomoya:
Alright, alright, alright!


Mei:
Is this how it works?

Tomoya:
Hm? I-I don't know.

Mei:
This is so fun!

Announce:
Please choose a frame.

Tomoya:
It's your choice.

Mei:
Hm... Oh, I like this one!

Tomoya:
Okay.

Announce:
Preparing the camera. Stand in place.

Mei:
Okay!

Announce:
Ready? Say Cheese.

Tomoya:
Oh, man. I hope nobody saw that.

Mei:
Okazaki, you gotta put this on your school binder, okay?

Tomoya:
Oh, hell no!

What's up?
I haven't seen you in hours. Where'd you go?

Youhei:
I was out with my girlfriend.
Now what the hell are you two doing here?

Tomoya:
What do you mean? We were looking for...

Youhei:
What's this?

Mei:
Uh...

Youhei:
You gonna explain this to me?

Mei:
Who cares? It's none of your business! Give it back!

Tomoya:
Aaah... looks like the cat's out of the bag now.

Youhei:
Huh?

Tomoya:
It's exactly what you're thinking.
The boyfriend Mei was talking about is none other than me.

Youhei:
So what? Are you just stringing Nagisa along?

Tomoya:
For now, until I dump her, at least.
Listen, I'll be honest with you, Mei stayed over at my place last night.
Right, Mei?

Mei:
Y-Yeah, that's right.
It was just me and Okazaki together all night.

Tomoya:
Well, let's get outta here, Mei.

Mei:
Uh, right.

Youhei:
Wait, come back... I said wait...

How did it turn out like this? Damn it!


Nagisa:
And that's... the last you saw of him?

Tomoya:
Yeah, we just made up something to make him worry.

Mei:
This is my fault, sorry for dragging you in...

Tomoya:
No, it's fine.
But even after I tried to make him angry, he still wouldn't say anything.
I thought he'd show us his "Big Brother" side, but it just didn't happen.

Mei:
Of course not.
My brother doesn't care what happens to me.

Nagisa:
Don't say that, Mei, it isn't true!
Still, I don't think it was right to lie to him like that.

Tomoya:
Listen, I hate to say it, but maybe you should head home.
You've been missing school for a week now. I'm sure your parents are worried about you.

Mei:
No, I can't go home yet. Not until my brother pulls himself together.
Okazaki, it seems like everything started to go wrong for Youhei after he left the Soccer Club.
If he had the chance to play again, then he might get better.
He might be like the big brother I grew up with.
We have to find a way to get him back on the team.

Tomoya:
I don't think that'll be easy.
Not after what happened between him and the other members.
Surely you realize that, right?

Mei:
None of that matters. It's the only choice we have left.



Youhei:
Besides, I'm busy with Sanae.
I don't have time to worry about every little thing Mei is doing.

Tomoya:
Listen, Mei, are you sure you don't wanna rethink this whole thing?

Yukine:
There are a lot of wonderful things about him.
He just has a hard time showing his good side to people.

Youhei:
You sure you wanna do this, Okazaki?
