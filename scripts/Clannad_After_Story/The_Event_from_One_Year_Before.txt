  Girl:
All right! We're in the same class again!

Boy:
Aw! I'm stuck with Minoshima? Man, this really sucks.

Nagisa:
Third year, class D...

Kimura:
'Morning, Furukawa. How's it going?

Nagisa:
Oh, good morning, Kimura. It's going okay, I guess.

Kimura:
It's a real shame they split us up this semester.
I haven't taken a look at your class yet.
So how does it look? Did you end up with anyone from last year?

Nagisa:
Not really. None of the girls at least.

Kiruma:
That's too bad. Well, I'm sure you'll make friends in no time.
You're cute, so you don't have to worry.

Nagisa:
Uh, thanks. But I'm not so sure about that.

Kimura:
Anyway, I'm sure everyone will love you once they get to know you a little better, so don't be shy, okay?
For the record, I'm in class A. I'll see you later.

Nagisa:
Oh, uh, see you later.

Ow! Sorry, I wasn't looking.

Tomoya:
No problem, it's fine.



Youhei:
It's the first day of the new semester and we're stuck with this crap already.
What's the deal?

Tomoya:
Gotta admit our ninja escape skills could use some work.

Teacher:
What are you doing?!

Youhei:
This sucks. I wanna go home.

Kyou:
Oh you think this sucks, huh? You know what really sucks?
Getting stuck here babysitting a bunch of goons like you!

Youhei:
Well, who's fault is that?
If you didn't want us to get in trouble like this, then you should have helped us escape out the window!

Kyou:
It seems that you don't understand the concept of undue resentment!
So please let me teach you by cracking open your skull and pounding it into your brain with this hammer!

Youhei:
Y-You look like you'd really do it.

Kyou:
Jeez. You see this?
Now this is exactly why I didn't wanna be class rep.

Tomoya:
Then it's settled. None of us wanna be here, right?
So let's just shut up and keep hammering so we can go home already.

Kyou:
Alright smart ass, what's your name?

Tomoya:
Tomoya Okazaki. What's yours?

Kyou:
I'm not telling you my name, you stupid punk.

Tomoya:
Ow! I told you my name, so tell me yours!

Kyou:
Nope! I don't wanna associate with people like you.

Tomoya:
You've got quite the personality.

Kyou:
Well, look at that. It seems you have a good eye for character.
If you mind your manners, perhaps I'll let you speak to me after all.
Hey! Get back here!

Tomoya:
Watch out!

Kyou:
Hey! Put your grubby hands off me!

Tomoya:
What's with that attitude? I saved you, didn't I?

Youhei:
What? I wasn't worth saving?



Kyou:
I'm not exactly sure I should thank you, since you weren't doing the work by choice.
But either way, I appreciate the help.
I'm Kyou Fujibayashi. We're in it together this year, so try not to give me too much trouble from here on out.

Tomoya:
Fujibayashi? Isn't there another Fujibayashi in the class next to ours?

Kyou:
That would be my twin sister.
I know it's confusing, so you can call me Kyou. Well, see ya.

Youhei:
So we're stuck with that weirdo for the rest of the year?

Tomoya:
To be fair, I bet she's thinking the same thing.

Youhei:
Anyway, you got anything you wanna do?

Tomoya:
Not really. Let's just hang out in front of the train station.
Beats going home at least.

Youhei:
Good point.


Nagisa:
Hey, I'm back from school.

Akio:
Oh, welcome home.
So how was it? Is your new class okay?

Nagisa:
I couldn't really talk to anyone, so I was kind of lonely, I guess.

Akio:
What?! Come on! You gotta make a good first impression!
Here, like this. Watch.
"What's going down, Bro? This is your home dog, Nagisa.
Yeah, I've got a business proposition for you. But I'm gonna need a little down payment first."
Why can't you just do that?!

Nagisa:
That's not really me.

Akio:
It's not the words that matter, it's the feeling you put behind them.
Just bust in there and show people what you're about!

Nagisa:
If you say so, but it took me a long time to make friends with everyone in my junior year.
It'll probably take a while this year, too.

Akio:
You just need to find the right chance.
I'm sure everyone else wants to make friends, so all you gotta do is get someone to notice you.

Nagisa:
The right chance, huh? I guess you're right.

Akio:
Fine. Looks like I'll have to teach you my special trick.

Nagisa:
Huh?

Akio:
Alright. You know how some kids will slip up and call their teacher "Mom" without thinking.
You gotta use that scenario to your advantage and call your teacher "Ultra Mom" instead!

Nagisa:
I see.

Akio:
Then the rumors will really start to fly.
"Did you hear that? I think Furukawa's related to Ultraman!"
"I wonder if she can transform!" "Well, let's ask her."
"Hey, what's up, Furukawa? Do you wanna eat lunch with us today?"

Nagisa:
Somehow, I don't think it will work out like that.

Akio:
Then how about plan B?! Give the kids one of these!

Nagisa:
You mean Mom's crab bread?

Akio:
You can use this as a kind of test. You know, like a rite of passage.
Tell the kids that you'll be their friend if they're hardcore enough to eat it.
Though, I have to admit it's a pretty steep hurdle.

Sanae:
So that's it? So that's how it is?
My bread is nothing but a rite of passage to you?!

Akio:
No! I love your bread!


Teacher:
Let's go over the procedure for tomorrow's entrance ceremony.
First, the juniors and seniors will take their seats in the gym.
Then the freshmen will come in and line up on the sides.
When the ceremony is over, the freshmen will have an orientation.
While that's going on, the juniors and seniors will return to class.
Now, there's something else I wanted to mention.

Nagisa:
Ultra Mom! I have a question!

Girl:
By any chance, are you related to Ultraman?

Boy:
That's so cool!

Girl:
Please transform for us!

Nagisa:
Ah, I called the teacher Mom by mistake again.
I'm such a ditz sometimes.

Teacher:
Try not to be too aggressive about getting them to join clubs or committees.
Also, refrain from holding any welcoming festivities other than those authorized by the school.


Kyou:
Sleeping again, huh?
Wake up, Okazaki! Fifth period is about to start! Jeez...
Now that I get a better look at him, he's kinda cute.
I wonder if he has a girlfriend...

Youhei:
Okazaki, look out!

Kyou:
Hey! What's going on?

Youhei:
I don't know. Why don't you tell me?
Don't play dumb. You were going to kill him in his sleep, weren't you?
No, wait. You were going to pounce on him. Like sexually pounce on him!

Kyou:
Why would I wanna do that?!

Youhei:
You can't fool me. I saw the way you were looking at him.
You were thinking he was pretty cute, weren't you?

Kyou:
He may act stupid, but he's pretty sharp!
If I hit you on the head, you'll forget everything.

Youhei:
That's a joke, right?!

Tomoya:
I was trying to sleep, you know.

Youhei:
Okazaki, that was a close one just now.
If I hadn't stepped in when I did, this weirdo would have sexually...

Kyou:
That should wipe his memory out just fine.


Kimura:
Furukawa!

Nagisa:
Hi, Kimura.

Kimura:
Finally caught up with you.
You're off for the day, aren't you?

Nagisa:
Ya.

Kimura:
By the way, this is a new friend I met in class today.
We were about to go downtown and look at some clothes. You wanna come with us?

Nagisa:
Hm? You wanna hang out with me?

Kimura:
Furukawa's a little shy, but she's fun once you get to know her.
Come on, let's go.

Nagisa:
But we're supposed to go straight home after class.

Kimura:
Nobody cares about those old rules anymore.
Come on, let's lighten up and have some fun.

Nagisa:
Okay.

Kimura:
Wow, that's really cute.

Girl:
No kidding. That's a good look for you, Furukawa.

Nagisa:
I'm getting nervous, you guys.
What happens if a teacher sees us here and gives us detention or something?

Kimura:
Don't worry about it, just try this on.

Nagisa:
Okay...

Kimura:
Let's pretend the teachers.
Furukawa, bad news! A teacher just showed up!

Girl:
We're running away! Take care of things for us!

Nagisa:
N-No, wait for me! Don't do that!
Oh, what should I say? I mean, I've never been in trouble before...
I'm sorry! I'll go straight home! Huh?

Kimura:
Just kidding.


Kimura:
Sorry about earlier.
After what you said, I just couldn't resist.

Nagisa:
It's all right. I was pretty scared for a second there, though.

Kimura:
It's a real shame, Furukawa.
You're a lot of fun to hang out with, but nobody ever notices because you're so shy all the time.
Just open up a little and I'm sure you can make plenty of friends.

Nagisa:
I'll try.

Kimura:
Anyway, see ya.

Girl:
It was nice meeting you.


Nagisa:
I had a fun time with Kimura and her friend on our way back from school. But...

Akio:
But you didn't make any new friends in class, huh?

Nagisa:
No...

Akio:
You've got like thirty kids stuffed in the class of yours, right?
There's bound to be somebody you can get along with.
Remember, a stranger you pass in the hallway could turn out to be your new best friend.
Or maybe even your future husband or the father of your children or something.
But if you don't get to know them, they'll never be anything more than strangers.

Nagisa:
I know, but what do you think I should do?

Akio:
Why don't you try this? Hidden among these rolls is one of Sanae's infamous creations.
Have your classmates pick them up one at a time like Russian roulette.
People do this kind of thing at parties all the time. It's guaranteed to be a hit with the kids.
"Wow, that Furukawa sure is a lot of fun, isn't she?" "I know. I hope she'll be my friend."
That's what they'll say. Ahhh!

Sanae:
Oh, I understand... That's how it is, huh?
My bread is nothing but Russian roulette to you?!

Akio:
No! I love your bread!


Ryou:
The six of spades, the eight of hearts, the nine of spades.
Six and nine unite to form number eight, so that means... Hm...

Kyou:
I don't know about accurate, but your fortune-telling certainly is unique.

Ryou:
Look, Kyou. It says someone's gonna confess his love to you.

Kyou:
To me?

Ryou:
That's right. Tomorrow, your Price Charming is going to reveal his feelings at last.

Kyou:
Huh?


Youhei:
There's no turning back now.
This is war and if we wanna win, we have to show her how scary we can be.

Tomoya:
I don't know if I wanna beat up a girl.

Youhei:
No! Fight with words!

Tomoya:
"To my beloved Kyou Fujibayashi.
I fell in love with you at first sight and would like to confess my love for you.
Come to the reference room in the old school building during lunch time. See you there."

Youhei:
I'm gonna sneak it into her shoe locker first thing tomorrow.
Then we can hide in the shadows and watch how she reads it and freaks out!

Tomoya:
If I got a love letter this stupid, I'd cry myself to sleep at night.

Youhei:
It's gonna mess with her head so much. She'll forget all about us.
Then we'll be able to wreak havoc all we want for the rest of the year!

Tomoya:
They say love is a battlefield, but I have a feeling this plan of yours is gonna bomb.

Youhei:
Just you wait. Poor little Kyou won't know what hit her.



Ryou:
I have to set things up for the welcoming ceremony. So I'm gonna go on ahead.

Kyou:
Okay. I'll see you later then.

Huh? "To my beloved Kyou Fujibayashi."
No way! Just like the fortune said!

Youhei:
How cute! Guess she has a soft side after all.

Tomoya:
For the record, I think this is absolutely awful.

Girl:
Hey, what about him over there? Do you think he's cute?

Girl:
If I say "yes", we'll have to fight over him, won't we?

Boy:
I wonder how many people will join our club.

Boy:
We need at least two more to get approved.

Boy:
Let's ask that guy.

Nagisa:
Good morning, everyone.

Girl:
Hey, check out that guy down there with the big round head. Doesn't he look like those things?
You know, they were real popular, there were a whole bunch of them, and they had that song.
Shoot, what were they called? They looked like this.

Girl:
Ah, it's on the tip of my tongue. I can't remember.

Girl:
Yeah, they were all over the place.
They had a whole bunch of soft toys, right?

Nagisa:
Oh, uh, I know.

Teacher:
All right, it's time for the welcoming ceremony. Let's go.


Principal:
I want to extend a heartfelt welcome to all the freshmen joining us today.
I sincerely hope that the years you spend at this school will be memorable ones.

Woman:
Next is our freshmen introduction.


Kyou:
Oh no. Am I actually looking forward to this?

Kyou:
"I've run into some problems. So please come to the roof."

Kyou:
"Sorry. I think we should meet in the gym equipment storage room."
What the heck is this?!

Tomoya:
Okay, we've had our fun. Let's just give it a rest.

Youhei:
No way, this is gold. We gotta milk it for all it's worth, man.

Nagisa:
Say "Ultra Mom". Just say "Ultra Mom".

Youhei:
Can you believe it? She still hasn't figured out that this is a joke.

Tomoya:
This is going too far. I think she's really about to lose her mind.

Youhei:
Why, I'm just getting started. Gotta hurry! Gotta hurry!

Tomoya:
I'm serious, make this the last one.

Youhei:
Okay, okay.
Let's see, "I've run into some problems again, so this time..."
I didn't think this far ahead.

Kyou:
How about, "I'll see you in Hell"?

Tomoya:
Hell, huh?

Youhei:
Ooh! Now that's a nice idea.
We'll end the big chase with a scary cliffhanger.

Kyou:
That's great! I'm so glad you like my idea!

Youhei:
Ahhhhh!


Youhei:
I thought I really was going to Hell.

Tomoya:
Remind me again, why are we making a big stupid ball out of sticks?

Youhei:
'Cause I'm having a bad day now.
And I wanna vent all my frustration on the freshmen.

Tomoya:
This is psycho, huh?

Youhei:
What should I write on the message inside?
Oh, I know. How about, "Sunohara and Okazaki, the Chummy Duo. By Wazzup"?
I'm gonna write "wazzup" in like ancient Japanese script so we look all hardcore.

Tomoya:
I'm not even gonna dignify that with a response. Just give it up.

Youhei:
Okay, how about, "Youhei and Tomoya, going for the goal. By Wazzup"?

Tomoya:
You really lost me on this whole "wazzup" thing.

Youhei:
How about, "Sunohara and Okazaki, the European Extreme Ironing Duo, featuring the Hikarisaka Brothers in dinosaur Armageddon. By Wazzup"?

Tomoya:
I didn't know ideas could get that bad.

Youhei:
Fine, then you write something.

Tomoya:
The banner's gonna fall out when this thing breaks open, right?

Youhei:
Yeah. We gotta let the freshmen know high school is gonna be a living Hell for them.

Tomoya:
Hm... In that case, I guess this is all I can say.


Girl:
What the heck is that?

Boy:
Whatever it is, it sure looks suspicious.

Boy:
Pull and see what happens.

Boy:
No way. I bet the water's gonna fall out or something like that.

Youhei:
Looks like nobody's falling for it.

Tomoya:
Well, yeah. Did you really think anyone was that dumb?

Youhei:
Damn it. So does that mean all these stupid ass freshmen are smarter than me?

Tomoya:
I don't think there's anyone stupider than you.

Youhei:
Look.

Tomoya:
Hm? Is she a freshman?

Youhei:
Her emblem is blue. She's a senior.


Boy:
Oh, man! She got knocked out!

Boy:
Get her to the nurse's office!

Youhei:
Hey, Okazaki...

Tomoya:
Maybe you're not the dumbest after all.

Girl:
Furukawa, are you okay?

Nagisa:
I think so. My head hurts and I'm a little confused.

Girl:
Someone was trying to play a prank on the freshmen.
I was watching to see if anyone would fall for it.
I can't believe it. That was just like a comedy show. Oh, I'm sorry.

Nagisa:
No, it's okay. I don't mind at all.

Girl:
Actually, it's kind of funny.
I've been meaning to talk to you since yesterday.
Kimura said you didn't have any friends in class, but you were really nice and fun to hang out with.

Nagisa:
She said that about me?

Girl:
I guess this is a strange way to meet someone, huh?
Anyway, since we're in the same class, why don't we be friends?

Nagisa:
Uh, sure. But, I... I'm not...
Never mind. Thanks for helping me out after I hurt my head back there.

Girl:
I'm just glad I was there to see it.


Kyou:
If teaching kindergarten is this tiring, maybe I should find a new career.

Ryou:
Did something bad happen?

Kyou:
No, there's a couple of troublemakers in my class, that's all.
Those idiots had me running all over the place.

Ryou:
It sounds like you're complaining, but you don't look like you mind.

Kyou:
Well, I don't really... mind...
Not to change the subject, but did your boobs get bigger?

Ryou:
Uh-huh.


Tomoya:
All right, what are you up to this time?

Youhei:
It's Operation Love Letter, Round Two! The last one was just a warm-up.
This time, I've got a whole story planned out about some freshmen who've fallen in love with her at first sight!

Tomoya:
You have a lot of free time, too much.


Nagisa:
It was my first time talking to her, so I was a little nervous.
But she was really nice, and she seemed like lots of fun, too.

Sanae:
That's great. I was worried.

Nagisa:
It's funny, but I owe it all to this little banner.

Akio:
That came out of the big ball when you pulled the string?

Nagisa:
That's right. I thought it'd be nice to keep it as a memento.
If it wasn't for this, I don't know if I ever would have found the courage to make friends at school.
"Don't give in to the hardships ahead of you."
Your name's too hard for me to read, but I'm glad you were there to cheer me on.
