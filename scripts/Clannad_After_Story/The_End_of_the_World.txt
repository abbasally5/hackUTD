  Doctor:
Just like Nagisa. What can I say?

I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I don't know what's causing it.
If Nagisa's condition was any indication, she could be sick like this for months.

Tomoya:
I don't get it... She was fine... just the other day...

Doctor:
Well... I've done all I can.

Akio:
Tomoya.
You're the father this time around, aren't you?

Tomoya:
Of course I am.

Akio:
Then like it or not, you're going to have to man up.



The girl:
Are you okay? It keeps getting colder.

"I":
A robot like me can't feel the cold.
I'm sure she's suffering. I'm sure her hands are freezing.
Although just like everything else, I can't feel them.

The girl:
Before we know it, the whole world will be buried in light.
We'd better hurry while we still can.



Ushio:
Is it Sports Day?

Tomoya:
Yeah.

Ushio:
You're not running today, Daddy?

Tomoya:
Nope. I'm gonna stay right here with you, all day long.

Ushio:
Is Akki gonna run?

Tomoya:
Knowing him, probably so.
It'll be pretty tough for the school to find replacements if both of the anchors cancel.

Ushio:
Daddy. I want you to beat Akki.

Tomoya:
I told you I'm staying with you.

Ushio:
I wish you could do both.

Tomoya:
You're always on Daddy's side, aren't you?

Ushio:
Mm-hm.

Tomoya:
Well, I'm on your side, too.
So I promise I'll protect you no matter what.

Ushio:
Mm.

Tomoya:
Are you sleepy?

Ushio:
Mm-hm.

Tomoya:
Sleep all you want. I'm not going anywhere.

Ushio:
Mm.

Tomoya:
One week... Two weeks... Even a month went by. But Ushio's fever never broke.
She could barely even leave her room. Kindergarten was out of the question.


Tomoya:
I'm sorry.

Boss:
I'll be honest, I hate to see you leave after all the hard work you've done.
But then, I can't very well keep you here at a time like this.

Yusuke:
Must have been tough.

Tomoya:
Sanae and the old man tried to talk me out of it.
But I wanna be there for Ushio as much as I can.

Yusuke:
Do you have any savings?

Tomoya:
I have a little. I just started a college fund for her.

Yusuke:
Oh, I see. We're gonna miss you.

Tomoya:
That means a lot. Thanks for everything.

Yusuke:
Here, take this. Don't lose it.

Tomoya:
You sure this is okay?

Yusuke:
Of course it's not okay.
It's gonna be hell trying to do my job without it.

Tomoya:
Then keep it!

Yusuke:
How about you give me your screw driver to use instead?
I can return it when you come back to work.
I'll borrow it till Ushio gets better, okay? But after that, you gotta use it again.

Yusuke:
Don't worry. I'll take good care of it for you.


Tomoya:
Ushio never left the apartment.
For a while I thought about putting her in the hospital, but in the end, I decided against it.
There was no point in sending her there since they didn't know how to treat her.
But more importantly, she wanted to stay at home. And I wanted her to be happy.

Tomoya:
Alright, now let's change your pajamas, Ushio.

Ushio:
Mm.

Tomoya:
You don't have to get up.
Just lay down and let Daddy take care of it.

Ushio:
But I can do it by myself.

Tomoya:
Don't worry about it. We all need help sometimes, okay?

Ushio:
Mm...

Tomoya:
Ushio can't dress herself anymore. She can't even use the bathroom by herself anymore.
Even worse, she can only eat soft foods now.
Everything was going so well. But now, it all just seems like a faraway dream.

Tomoya:
Ushio, is there anything that you want?

Ushio:
Uh-uh.

Tomoya:
Don't be afraid to ask.
If you want a new toy or candy or whatever, I'll buy it for you.

Ushio:
How about a trip?

Tomoya:
A trip?

Ushio:
I wanna take another trip with you, Daddy.

Tomoya:
Did you really have that much fun the last time?
I mean, it didn't bother you that Daddy was so mean and grumpy?

Ushio:
I still had fun. I wanna go on another trip, just like that one.
We can take the train. Just me and you, Daddy.

Tomoya:
As soon as you get better, okay?

Ushio:
I wanna go now.

Tomoya:
Ushio... Please don't make this hard on your daddy, okay?

Ushio:
Mm...

Tomoya:
Why can't I change anything? Why can't I grant my daughter her only wish?
Nagisa... What should I do? If only you were here to tell me...

First me, then my family... It's like this town is toying with us.
It grants us happiness on a whim, then takes it away just as quickly.
I won't stand for it. I'm gonna save Ushio no matter what. No matter what!


Tomoya:
Take good care of her for me.

Sanae:
See you two later.

Akio:
Adios.

Akio:
Hey. This is for you.

Tomoya:
I can't take your money.

Akio:
Come on. Don't be so stubborn.

Tomoya:
Ah, no. Really I appreciate the thought.
But I still have some savings left, so I'll be fine for a while at least.

Akio:
If you're lying, I'm gonna pound you!

Tomoya:
No, I'm telling the truth.

Akio:
All right, I believe you.
But even if you lose face as a man, there are some things you gotta protect.
You know that, right?

Tomoya:
Yeah. I get what you mean. I'll let you know if things get bad.


Akio:
Cigarette?

Tomoya:
No thanks. I just quit.

Akio:
Guess I should do the same, huh?

Tomoya:
Hey.

Akio:
What's up?

Tomoya:
The people of this town sacrificed a part of nature so they could build a hospital there.
If this town is still growing, what are they gonna sacrifice next?

Akio:
They're leveling a hill on the outskirts of town as we speak.
They wanna build a big shopping mall out there.
It should be convenient, so I'm sure the people here will be happy.

Tomoya:
I had a weird thought.
You said you brought Nagisa here when she was dying.
Maybe when she got better, she and the town were bound together in some way.
And now her daughter's bound to this place, too.
Maybe this town is in pain. Maybe all this change is causing it.
Do you think their sickness could be a reflection of that?

Akio:
I don't think pain's got anything to do with it.
Like it or not, this world is always changing. That's just the natural order of things.

Tomoya:
And if people dying is part of that change, then we have to learn to accept that?
It's just how it's meant to be? Is that what you're saying?

Akio:
Yeah, but it's a hard lesson to learn and that's why we keep building these hospitals.

Akio:
Here's to the happiness of this town and all its people.



Tomoya:
Are you thirsty? Do you want some water?

Ushio:
Uh-huh...

Tomoya:
It's cold, so drink it nice and slow.
If you gulp it all down, you'll get a tummyache.

Ushio:
It feels nice.

Tomoya:
That's good.

Ushio:
Daddy.

Tomoya:
Hm?

Ushio:
I wanna go on a trip with you.

Tomoya:
I know. But you have to wait till you get better, okay?
So where is it you wanna go? We could see that field of flowers again.
Ah, but it'd be cold if we went north in the winter. Let's go south instead.
I bet we can find some place warm and fun with lots of fresh air. Or maybe we could...

Ushio:
But... but I wanna go now.

Tomoya:
As soon as you get better. How many times have I told you?

Ushio:
I... I wanna go to the field of flowers right now.

Tomoya:
Ushio...

Ushio:
It's gotta be now. We gotta go now just you and me.

Tomoya:
All right then, we can go.
If you say we gotta go now, then we gotta go.

Ushio:
Mm.

Tomoya:
But, if you start feeling bad, then you gotta let Daddy know.

Ushio:
Mm.

Tomoya:
Good deal.

Tomoya:
Here, I'll carry you. Come on.

Ushio:
I can walk on my own.

Tomoya:
Don't force yourself.

Ushio:
I wanna walk with you, Daddy.

Tomoya:
I see. Then we'll walk together as far as you can.

Ushio:
'Kay.

Tomoya:
We're off! Let's have lots of fun this time, alright?

Ushio:
Ya!

Tomoya:
You okay, Ushio?

Ushio:
Yup.

Tomoya:
Just tell me if you start feeling bad. We'll go see the doctor.
Don't worry, it's no trouble at all.

Ushio:
Okay.

Tomoya:
That's enough. Okay?

It's snowing.
Do you like watching the snow fall, Ushio?

Ushio:
Ya. Do you like watching it, too?

Tomoya:
Yeah, I, uh... Yeah. Daddy likes it, too.
Can you walk, Ushio? You wanna take a break?

Ushio:
Uh-uh.

Tomoya:
Let's take a cab before the snow starts getting worse.
Let me carry you.

Ushio:
I'm fine.


Tomoya:
Ushio!

Ushio:
Daddy...

Tomoya:
I'm right here. What is it?

Ushio:
Did we... make it? Are we on the train yet?

Tomoya:
Yeah. We made it on the train.

Ushio:
It's dark... Is it night?

Tomoya:
It sure is. It's getting late.

Ushio:
Oh... Daddy?

Tomoya:
Hm?

Ushio:
I love you...

Tomoya:
Yeah. Daddy loves you, too, Ushio. Very much.

Tomoya:
Ushio? Ushio!

USHIO!

Tomoya:
No! Anything but this!
Nagisa... Please save Ushio. Nagisa!
Someone... Someone help! Help her! Nagisa...


The girl:
Thanks for the hand.

"I":
How many steps have we taken? How many more steps do we still have to take?
I don't know where we are. I barely know where we're going.
Are we almost there already? Or do we still have a long way to walk?


Tomoya:
I hate this town.
I go to school every day, hang out with my friends, and then I go home.
There's no place I'd rather not go ever again.
I wonder if anything will ever change. Will that day ever come?

Nagisa:
Ampan!
Do you like this school? I have to say that I love it very, very much.
But soon, everything changes. Well, at least it does eventually.

Tomoya:
If I answer her, then Nagisa and I will start talking to each other.
We'll start dating. We'll get married.
But maybe it'd be better if that didn't happen after all...
Maybe it'd be better if we never met at all...
