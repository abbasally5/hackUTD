  Akio:
So you're married. But, when's the wedding?

Tomoya:
When I save up enough money.

Akio:
Why couldn't you marry like a doctor or a lawyer instead of some hobo?

Nagisa:
Because I love him, of course.

Akio:
Don't be so serious.
You'll make your poor dad depressed.

Tomoya:
Oh, that reminds me.
I should start calling you "Dad" from now on, too.

Akio:
No way! That's disgusting!

Tomoya:
Well, it only makes sense. I mean, you really are my father-in-law.
Ain't that right, dear old Dad?

Akio:
Fine! If you wanna play that game, then I'll call you "Son"!
How's that, Son?

Tomoya:
Stop it, Dad! It hurts! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!

Akio:
Son! Son! Son! Son! Sooooon!



Nagisa:
Um...

Tomoya:
What? What's wrong?

Nagisa:
I'm not quite sure what to say at a time like this.

Tomoya:
Huh? A time like what? What do you mean?

Nagisa:
Our new life starts together today.
Should I say, "Ready, set, go" or something like that?

Tomoya:
No, that's weird. It's not like a race or anything.

Nagisa:
Hm, you're right. But what should we say?

Tomoya:
The idea is, we're gonna live together and support each other and all.
So something like, "Let's give it our best?"

Nagisa:
In that case, I'd like to make a vow to start things off on a good note.

Tomoya:
A vow?

Nagisa:
Yup. I, Nagisa Okazaki, will no longer cry.
No matter how hard things get, I vow to hang in there and never give up.
But... Even if I don't cry when I'm sad, I might do when I'm happy.
That's just the kind of person I am. From now on, I'll try my best to support you.

Tomoya:
Thank you. And I'll try my best to support you, too, Nagisa.



Nagisa:
Tomoya?

Tomoya:
What is it?

Nagisa:
Is it really okay for me to take a bath first?
I don't wanna keep you waiting.

Tomoya:
No, it's fine.
I, uh, I'll take a bath first tomorrow and then we'll be even, alright?

Nagisa:
Okay. That sounds fair.
In that case, I'll see you when I get out.

Tomoya:
Calm down.
Come on, Tomoya, you've heard her taking a bath at her house plenty of times.
It's no big deal.

Nagisa:
Ahhh!

Tomoya:
What's wrong?!

Nagisa:
I'm sorry. I didn't know the water would be so cold.

Tomoya:
It takes a while for the water to get hot, but it'll be fine in a minute.
Turn the faucet a little at a time, okay?

Nagisa:
Right. Got it.

Um, sorry for the trouble. I'll try to be quick.

Tomoya:
No, it's fine. Please take your time.

Nagisa:
No way! I can't do that!
You have to get up early tomorrow for work, so you need to get to bed soon.

Tomoya:
Huh? Oh, you're right...
Guess I forgot.

Nagisa:
I should probably get to bed, too.
I'm gonna start looking for a job tomorrow.

Tomoya:
Huh?

Nagisa:
I can't just stay home and fool around all day while you're working.
I have to earn my keep.

Tomoya:
Nagisa, are you awake?

Nagisa:
Yup. I'm still awake.

Tomoya:
Are you serious about looking for a job tomorrow?

Nagisa:
Yup. But don't worry. Even if I'm not a housewife, I'll still cook and clean.
I want to, 'cause this is my house, too, right?

Tomoya:
In that case, I'll take care of some housework myself.
Don't work too hard and make yourself sick again.

Nagisa:
I know I may not be very strong, but I don't wanna live the rest of my life like I'm weak, either.

Sorry, Tomoya.
I don't know, maybe I'm just being selfish.

Tomoya:
No, I don't think that at all.
You never asked for anything from me that I wasn't willing to give.

Nagisa:
But that's the thing.
Even if you don't mind, I'm always asking you to do things for me.

Tomoya:
Yeah, but who cares?
You ask me to do easy stuff like play ball with your dad or hold your hand or whatever.

Nagisa:
Then would you hold my hand now?

Tomoya:
Hm?

Nagisa:
This is it. It's so sudden, but we're married now.

Tomoya:
From now on, everything we do, we do together, alright?
But that being said, I'm sure we'll have our fair share of troubles.

Nagisa:
As long as I have you, I can handle anything. No problem.

Tomoya:
Yeah, same here. You took the words right out of my mouth.
With your support, I feel like anything is possible.
I need you. You gotta stay with me forever, okay?

Nagisa:
Of course I'll stay.
Forever, wherever. I'll always be with you.

Tomoya:
And thus, Nagisa and I began our new life together.
From now on, I have to work hard to support the both of us.
But it doesn't feel like a burden. It's a joy.
It gives me a reason to try even harder.

After work, I go straight home, as quickly as I can.
Because it's the home where Nagisa is waiting for me.
Because it's our home.


Nagisa:
Oh, by the way, I gave Nishina a call earlier.
I got her number back at my graduation ceremony, but never got around to calling her.

Tomoya:
She's studying to get into college now, right?

Nagisa:
Yup. She's trying to get into a music school.
She doesn't wanna burden her parents with a bunch of tuition fees.
So she got a part-time job to help cover the bills if she gets accepted.

Tomoya:
Really? Good for her.

Nagisa:
It's nothing fancy, but she's gonna work at a family restaurant that's opening next month.
I told her that I was looking for a job, too, and she said I should work with her.

Tomoya:
At the restaurant?

Nagisa:
Yah. As a waitress.
It's actually a big relief for me, since I haven't had a lot of luck looking for jobs.

Tomoya:
I guess that's good.
It's nice to work with someone you know at least.
But don't tell your old man and Sanae about it now.
It'll probably just stress them out.

Nagisa:
I'm sure they'll find out anyway.

You sure look like you're deep in thought.
What's on your mind?

Tomoya:
Oh, I was just thinking about something Miyazawa said.
Remember the thing about the old town legend?
She said that whenever someone achieves true happiness, an orb of light appears.
Of course, I don't know if the legend is true or not, but it makes me wonder if we have one of those orbs of light hovering around us right now.

She also said if you can manage to catch one of those lights, you'll have a wish granted.
If you got one, what would you wish?

Nagisa:
I don't know. I don't need anything.

Tomoya:
There must be something.

Nagisa:
Well, there's nothing I can think of, at least.

Actually, there might be one thing.

Tomoya:
Really? What is it then?
If you tell me, then I'll buy it for you.

Nagisa:
I think I want a baby.
You think that could ever happen?


Tomoya:
What's up?

Akio:
Come on in.
I thought you were a customer.

Tomoya:
I finished work early today, so I thought I'd pop in and say hi.
Looks like you aren't too happy to see me, though.

Akio:
Hm? No, I wouldn't say that at all.
Why, in fact, it's just the opposite.
I've been dreaming, plotting, waiting for this day to come.

Tomoya:
I don't wanna know, do I?

Akio:
Let's go spy on Nagisa at her work! Yeah!

Tomoya:
Why am I getting dragged into this?

Akio:
Obviously, because it's not cool for a man my age to go to a family restaurant and eat chocolate parfaits by himself.

Tomoya:
Who cares?
And why does it have to be a chocolate parfait?

Akio:
Come on, kid. You've never been to Nagisa's restaurant before, right?
Now you can't tell me you don't wanna see her in her waitress outfit.

Tomoya:
I do!

Akio:
Good, man!
But if word ever got out that I went to take candid photos of her at work, I'd be the laughingstock of the whole neighborhood.
That's why I'm dressed as a super-hip youngster to disguise myself as one of your friends.

Tomoya:
There's no way that's gonna fool anyone.

Akio:
People who don't know me will just think I'm some stylin' rap superstar. [stylin': stylish]
Yo, yo, I'm MC Akio!
Rhymin' from the bakery down the street, the baddest baker that you'll ever meet! Word!

Tomoya:
You realize that rap's giving yourself away, right?

Akio:
Brother, that's whack! I'd better take that rap back!

Tomoya:
Whatever. Let's just go.

Akio:
Slow it down, Bro! Wait for Akio!

Akio:
Believe it or not, this whole side of town used to be covered in trees.
Now we got buildings popping up everywhere.
Kinda crazy, isn't it? You never know what's gonna change.
Hey. Something wrong?

Tomoya:
Uh, no. Let's go in.

Akio:
Hm?



Sugisaka:
Hello. Come on in- Huh? Is that...

Tomoya:
Yo. Long time no see.

Rie:
Oh, hi, Okazaki. I haven't seen you in ages.
Who's your... friend?

Akio:
I'm the rapper without a name!

Rie:
Huh...

Sugisaka:
Hey, Rie, the manager's looking over here.

Rie:
This way, please. Would you like a table for two?

Akio:
I'm glad to see they're doing such good business here.
In a couple of years, I bet you won't even be able to recognize this town.
Hm? Something wrong? You look like you're kinda down ever since we got here.

Tomoya:
Oh, uh... No, it's nothing.

Nagisa:
How can I help you? Tomoya?

Did you need to tell me something?

Tomoya:
Oh, no. It's nothing serious. I just had some time off.
Thought I'd come pay you a visit.

Nagisa:
Nishina and Sugisaka said some friends came to see me.
Oh, but I'm afraid I haven't met you before.

Akio:
Yo!

Tomoya:
You can't tell who he is?!

Nagisa:
How... could I? This is the first time I've seen him.
Go ahead and take a look at the menu if you like.
I'll be back in just a minute.

Akio:
I told you she wouldn't be able to tell.

Tomoya:
Well, what can I say? Like father, like daughter.

Akio:
Ah, how nice. You're flattering me.

Nagisa:
So, have you two decided on what you want yet?

Tomoya:
I'll take a hot coffee.
The rapper wants a parfait, whichever one is the biggest, I guess.

Nagisa:
All right. So that will be... one hot coffee and a Chocolate and Strawberry Mix Parfait Diamond Special, right?
The waiter will be with you shortly.

Waiter:
Thank you for waiting.

Akio:
This is too big, yo! You think I'm a pig, Bro?!
Better be frontin' the bill for this hoe!

Tomoya:
What? You said you wanted a parfait, didn't you?

Akio:
Really? A parfait? Does that sound like something I would want?!

Tomoya:
You said it on the way here! I swear!

Man:
You see that? I told you she was really cute, right?

Akio:
Hey, hear that?

Tomoya:
Hm?

Rie:
As you can tell, Furukawa's pretty popular.
Believe it or not, we have quite a few customers come here just to see her.

Sugisaka:
Rie, she's not Furukawa anymore, remember?

Rie:
Ow. I suppose you're right. She's Nagisa Okazaki now.

Akio:
Must be the magic of the uniform.
She does look pretty cute, even for her.

Sugisaka:
Rie!

Man:
Hey, princess. What time do you get off work today?

Man:
How about you and I get some dinner? I know a great place, my treat.

Nagisa:
Uh, I don't mean to be rude, but I need to go straight home after work.
I'm sorry, I'd better get back to work now.

Man:
Hold on a sec!

Akio:
Let's go!

Tomoya:
Right.

Rie:
Wait, "Let's go"?

Sugisaka:
Hey, hold on...

Akio:
Don't get worked up. We won't cause any trouble.

Man:
Come on! Come with-

Akio:
Hey, Bro! Long time no see!

Tomoya:
Yeah! It's been ages, man!
Never thought I'd run into you in a place like this.

Akio:
You're bothering the other customers.
What do you say we take this outside, huh?

Man:
Well, the food sucked anyway!

Man:
Dude! You suck!

Akio:
I just wanted to bust some heads.

Nagisa:
Um...
If you don't mind, the manager would like to have a word with you...

Tomoya:
The manager?

Akio:
I'm outta here, man! Hope you got a game plan.
Word to your mother!

Tomoya:
Hey!

Sorry, Nagisa. Guess we overdid it.

Nagisa:
Uh, no! I'm happy you helped me out. They were being a real pain.
But, I hate to think that you might get scolded by the manager...

Tomoya:
Aw, it'll be fine. Don't worry, I won't tell him we're married.
I'll just pretend like I'm another one of your fans.

Nagisa:
Don't do that!

Tomoya:
Shh!


Manager:
You know, your wife's a very hard worker.
We're happy to have her on board.

Tomoya:
He already knows!

Manager:
I asked Nishina and Sugisaka after I saw them talking to you.
Sorry if I made you nervous, but I thought this would be a good opportunity to meet you.

Tomoya:
No, I'm sorry for causing such a big commotion out there.

Manager:
Not at all. Anyone else would have done the same thing in a situation like that.
As far as I'm concerned, you were just sticking up for your wife.
To be honest, this isn't the first time something like that has happened.
But Nagisa is quite tactful, she deals with those situations like a real pro.

Tomoya:
I guess she can handle herself.

Manager:
I know that her health isn't the best and this is the first job she's had, but she's tough, she's smart, and she's hardworking.
She's a great employee and a wonderful addition to the team.
But I must say, she has a tendency to be a bit hard on herself whenever she happens to make a mistake.
If she ever gets depressed, I'm counting on you to cheer her up for me, alright?

Tomoya:
Uh, sure. It's a pleasure to meet you. I feel like I should have stopped by sooner.
My girl, uh, I am sorry, my wife... owes you a lot.
Thanks for taking good care of her.

Manager:
Thank you for taking such good care of my waitress.


Tomoya:
Looks like you're really fitting in at your new job.

Nagisa:
Uh-huh. It's hard work, but it reminds me of the Drama Club back when we put on our play.

Tomoya:
You looked great in your uniform by the way.
My rapper friend thought so, too. He said you were cute.

Nagisa:
Y-Your friend is crazy, I'm not cute at all.
Nishina and Sugisaka are way cuter than me.
I just remembered Nishina told me something interesting the other day.

Tomoya:
Hm?

Nagisa:
Apparently, the high school is putting up a new building.
And not like an add-on, either, they're actually going to tear down the old one.

Tomoya:
Huh?

Nagisa:
Just think, the freshmen who start two years from now, will get to study in a bright, shining new school.
I can't wait to see what it looks like.

Tomoya:
What's so great about that?

Nagisa:
Huh?


Tomoya:
It's no good!

Uh... I'm sorry...

Nagisa:
I don't understand, Tomoya. What's wrong?

Tomoya:
I... I-It's nothing. Really, just forget it.

Nagisa:
You don't have to pretend like nothing is wrong.
I don't know what I said, but if I upset you, then I wanna apologize.
Did I do something to make you mad?

Tomoya:
It's not like I was mad at you. Just irritated.
It doesn't upset you, too?
Sure, the building may be old, but that's where we had the Drama Club, right?
We spent a lot of time together there, it's full of memories.

Nagisa:
Oh, yah. You're right.
Now that you mention it, it feels like a shame to just tear it down like that.

Tomoya:
Well, that's why I got a little worked up. Sorry.
I don't know why, I'm really high-strung for some reason today.

Nagisa:
No, it's fine. I didn't realize I was touching on a sensitive subject.
I didn't mean to upset you.

Tomoya:
No. You didn't do anything wrong.

Nagisa:
Are you sure?

Tomoya:
I don't know why I lost it like that.
What's wrong? Why am I so worried about this?

This town is changing.
It never bothered me before, but I'm really starting to feel it now.
Even we're starting to change. And one day when everything is different, I-I...

Nagisa:
But do you think you can still love this place anyway?


Akio:
At last, my Nagisa photo collection is complete!

Tomoya:
You're nuts, old man. When did you take all these?

Akio:
Let's just say I ate enough of those chocolate diamond whatever parfaits to kill a man!
Sure wasn't easy.
Sometimes, I crawled on the floor, other times, I hid in the kitchen or clung form the ceiling or stood on my head to get just the right angle.

Tomoya:
I'm surprised they didn't kick you out.

Akio:
Anyway, where did our little ladies run off to?
I wanna show them the fruits of my labor.

Tomoya:
Dunno. Nagisa said she needed to talk to Sanae about something important before we came.
But wait, you mean you're gonna show them these?

Akio:
Uh-huh.

Tomoya:
Nagisa, what's wrong?!

Sanae:
Are you okay?

Nagisa:
Sorry, guys. Just a little nauseous.

Akio:
Nauseous, huh? What are you pregnant or something?

Tomoya:
Don't joke about that!

Akio:
Hit a soft spot, huh?
Sorry kid, if you had any balls, she'd have a bun in the oven already.

Sanae:
She does. We just found out.

Tomoya, Akio:
Huh?

Sanae:
I'm not talking about baking.

Akio:
Wait, you mean...

Sanae:
Nagisa and Tomoya are having a child.
Congratulations.

Akio:
Wait, Sanae! When you say they're having a child, you mean a stork came to visit them, or they picked it up in a cabbage patch, or a fairy godmother granted their wish or something?!

Nagisa:
N-No, Dad. That's not how it works.
Tomoya and I are married now, so we... uh...

Tomoya:
What? Nagisa, no. Don't say it.

Nagisa:
We have sex and sex makes babies!

Tomoya:
It takes a special kind of girl to say that to her parents.
Actually, it takes a special kind of human to say that at all.
You're one in a million, Nagisa.

Sanae:
She hasn't had her period in two months.
I think it's safe to say that this is for real.

Tomoya:
Uh...

Akio:
Little creep! You're dead...
I mean, congratulations, kid.

Tomoya:
Uh... Th-Thanks...



Yagi:
Nice to meet you. I hope I can help out.

Nagisa:
Hello. I'm Nagisa Okazaki.
Thanks for taking the time to stop by.

Tomoya:
Hi, I'm her husband, Tomoya.

Akio:
You're gonna have it, right?
