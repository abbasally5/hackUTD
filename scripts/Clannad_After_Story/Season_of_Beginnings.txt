  "I":
Bit by bit, I collected pieces of junk. And bit by bit, she put them together.
All the while, clouds began to fill the sky.
I wanted to fly with these wings to leave this place long behind before the cold sets in.

When winter comes, she'll stop moving. That's what she told me, at least.
To be honest, I don't quite understand what she meant.
All I know is that time is short, and we have to do something before it's too late.



Kyou:
Buh-bye! Take care!

Ryou:
Good luck!

Kotomi:
I can't wait to see you all again.

Youhei:
I won't forget you after I'm famous.

Everyone:
Bye!

Nagisa:
Congratulations on graduating, Tomoya.

Tomoya:
Oh, yeah...



Sanae:
I know I said it before, but congratulations on graduating.
We're proud of you. Now you're a real member of society.

Tomoya:
I guess. But I really just feel like a bum.

Sanae:
Oh? What are your plans right now?

Tomoya:
Uh, nothing in particular.

Akio:
You're pathetic.
How about you work here at the bakery for a while?

Sanae:
That's a wonderful idea!
If you help out in the morning, then I can pack little lunch boxes for Nagisa to take to school.
I've wanted to do that ever since she was little, but I can never make the time with all the baking we need to do.

Akio:
But I'll warn you, you ain't getting paid much, so don't get your hopes up or anything.

Tomoya:
That sounds great, thank you.

Sanae:
Well, I'm glad. I look forward to working with you, Tomoya.

Tomoya:
Wait, say again?

Sanae:
You don't mind me using your first name, do you?
We're practically family now. It only seems natural.

Nagisa:
That's great.
Mom and Dad could really use some help making bread in the morning.
And if nothing else, it'll be an easy commute for you.

Tomoya:
It's a temporary solution, but I can't keep relying on them forever.

Nagisa:
This is off subject, but I'm feeling a lot better now that the weather is warmed up.
I think I can even go to school.

Tomoya:
Sure would be nice if you could get into the same class as Tomoyo and Miyazawa.

Nagisa:
Yup!

Tomoya:
I begin work at 5 in the morning.
By that time, the old man is already baking.
Sanae teaches me how to do this and that while she lines up the finished bread.


Nagisa:
Hi, Tomoya.

Tomoya:
Oh, you going to the opening ceremony?

Nagisa:
Yup. See you later.

Tomoya:
All right, take care out there.

Nagisa:
I will.

Tomoya:
Good luck, Nagisa. Give it your best.

We're busiest from opening until about 9 am.
This is when most of the sales for the day are made.

By noon, the flow of customers pretty much dies down.
When things are quiet in the shop, Sanae holds classes for the kids in the neighborhood.
This is another way for the Furukawas to support themselves.

Akio:
Hey kid, I'm back.

Tomoya:
Where have you been?

Akio:
Huh? Uh... here and there, you know.

Tomoya:
The old man wanders out sometimes.
I have no idea where he goes or what he does.

Akio:
It sure is slow.

Tomoya:
Yeah, no kidding.
I hope Nagisa's doing all right at school. I'm worried.

Akio:
Well, there ain't no point in getting stressed out about it.
I know. How about we play catch with Sanae's bread?

Tomoya:
I don't know. We shouldn't waste food, right?

Akio:
Don't be such a wet blanket.
Who says you can't have a little fun at work?

Nagisa:
Excuse me.

Akio:
Oh, welcome-
Oh, thought you were a customer.

Nagisa:
I just wanted to see you at work, Tomoya.
Your apron looks cute.

Tomoya:
So you found out what class you're in, right?

Nagisa:
Uh, yeah, but it's full of people I've never met.
I think it'll be okay, though. They seem really nice.
And I'm looking forward to making some new friends.

Tomoya:
Sounds good.

Akio:
All right. Forget about catch.
Now that we've got enough people, let's have a snowball fight with Sanae's bread.

Nagisa:
Um... Mom's right behind you, Dad.

Sanae:
My bread...?
You're saying my bread... is for... for hitting people?! Is that it?!

Akio:
No, I love your bread! Sanae!

Tomoya:
I began to realize that the old man and Sanae weren't doing things like that because they were crazy.
They were doing them because they wanted to see their daughter smile.


Nagisa:
Hey, Tomoya.
I'm headed to school. See you later.

Tomoya:
Oh, hey. You have club orientations today, don't you?

Nagisa:
Yah. I wrote a script and memorized it so I'll know just what to say.

Tomoya:
Sounds good to me. I hope everything works out.
Nagisa? Hey, you eat breakfast this morning?

Nagisa:
No, but it's too late! I already brushed my teeth!


Tomoya:
Nagisa!

Nagisa:
Hi, Tomoya. I didn't notice you there.

Tomoya:
How was orientation? Did it go well?
Everything okay?

Nagisa:
Yah, everything is fine.
The speech went over really well.

Tomoya:
Nagisa. Come on, tell me the truth. It's all right.

Nagisa:
I got really nervous at the orientation and messed up my speech.
But Tomoyo and Miyazawa and Nishina still clapped for me, so wasn't all bad.

Tomoya:
Did you find a new adviser for the club?

Nagisa:
Yeah, it's kind of a strange match, but Mr. Minoshima from the track team is picking up the job.

Tomoya:
That guy, huh?

Nagisa:
But we don't have any members right now.
So if we can't recruit at least two more people by next Wednesday, then the Drama Club will be disbanded again.
I have to work extra hard to make sure that doesn't happen.

Tomoya:
What about your class? How's that going?
Are you making any new friends?
Do people know this is your second year as a senior?

Nagisa:
Yeah, everyone knows. That's why it's so tough.
I don't think people wanna talk to me very much.

Tomoya:
It'll be fine. You've got a likable personality.
I'm sure everyone will love you once they get a chance to know you a little better.

Nagisa:
I sure hope that's true.
I don't wanna give up on the Drama Club.

Tomoya:
Yeah.

Nagisa:
I don't wanna sound like I'm being negative, I wanna talk to you about fun things.
I wanna be able to smile and tell you what happened at school or with the Drama Club or whatever.
Hey, Tomoya?

Tomoya:
Oh yeah, right.
I-I'm sure we'll have a lot of fun stuff to talk about.

Nagisa:
Yup!

Tomoya:
Since then, Nagisa hasn't told me anything fun about school.
If I try to encourage her, I'm afraid I'll just put pressure on her.
If I say, "Do your best," I might just be stressing her out.
That's the way I see it at least.
But Nagisa was never late to school and never missed a day.
With or without encouragement, she always did her best.
But in the end, despite her best efforts, not a single person wanted to join her club.


Tomoya:
Hey, Yoshino!

Yusuke:
Hey, look who it is.

Tomoya:
Your job sure does look tough.

Yusuke:
Yeah. We don't have enough workers.
It's pretty stressful sometimes.

Tomoya:
I see...

Yusuke:
Oh yeah. Congrats on graduating.

Tomoya:
Huh? Oh, thank you.

Yusuke:
Anyway, what're you up to right now?

Tomoya:
Just running errands. That sorta thing.

Yusuke:
Come and visit us some time.
Evenings are best, since Kouko spends most of the day at the hospital.

Tomoya:
Oh, yeah. Kouko's younger sister's been hospitalized for a long time, hasn't she?

Yusuke:
Yeah. But Kouko believes she'll recover. So I won't give up hope, either.
Well, I'd better get back to work.

Tomoya:
Oh. I'm sorry. Catch you some other time.


Tomoya:
Even the ones far from the station are expensive...

Boy:
Dude, really?

Girl:
That's funny, I was growing my hair out, too.

Kyou:
Tomoya!

Ryou:
Hi, Okazaki. Haven't seen you in a while.

Tomoya:
Hey. Yeah, what's up? You on your way from school?

Ryou:
That's right.

Kyou:
I haven't seen you since graduation.
Is Nagisa doing better now?

Tomoya:
Yeah, she's fine. She goes to school every day.

Ryou:
Good to hear.

Kyou:
It's not like we live far away or anything. I'd like to see you guys every once in a while.
We just haven't been able to make the time.

Ryou:
Maybe we can put together some kind of reunion after our schedules clear up a bit.

Tomoya:
I didn't know school would keep you so busy all the time.

Kyou:
And what about you?
Still freeloading off the Furukawas?

Ryou:
Come on, Sis. You don't have to be so rude.

Tomoya:
No, you have a point.
Don't worry, I'm not planning on freeloading off them forever.

Kyou:
I'm not used to you agreeing with me like that. It's kinda weirding me out.
Come on! Don't look so down! I'm sure you can make it on your own if you put your mind to it.

Tomoya:
Yeah. Actually, I was looking for a cheap apartment before I ran into you two.
Didn't have much luck, though.

Ryou:
Oh! Um, that reminds me!
My friend said her older brother is going to move out of his apartment soon.
I-I mean, it's an old building, but you said you were looking for some place cheap, so...
Sorry. I didn't mean to butt in or anything.

Tomoya:
No! That's great! Please! Tell me more!

Yoshino! Hold on!
Yoshino. You think... You think you could...
Could you get me a job, please! I'll work hard!


Akio:
I see. Moving out, huh?

Sanae:
If you're sure that's what you want.

Tomoya:
Well, I'm an adult.
I don't wanna be a burden on you guys anymore.

Akio:
You got enough money?

Tomoya:
I've got a little stashed away.
I haven't touched most of my pay, so it should be alright.

Akio:
Fair enough. Well, I've said all I can say.
You can do whatever you want.

Tomoya:
You took good care of me. Thanks for everything.



Tomoya:
You sure the shop's gonna be alright?

Akio:
Yeah, I wouldn't worry about it.
No one's gonna come in at this time of day.
And show some gratitude. I could see it in your eyes.
You wanted to play catch with me so bad you were about to piss your pants.

Tomoya:
You just keep telling yourself that, old man.
Whatever helps you sleep at night.

Akio:
Listen, kid.

Tomoya:
What is it?

Akio:
Come to me if you have any problems, alright?
Being an adult isn't always easy.
So if you need a little help some time, don't be afraid to give me a call.

Tomoya:
I appreciate it. It really means a lot to me to hear you say that.
Whoa...

Akio:
Guess you're not so immature after all.

Tomoya:
I have a question.

Akio:
Yeah?

Tomoya:
Would you let me take Nagisa with me someday?


Akio:
That's up to her, not me.
She's old enough to make her own decisions now.

All right. Give me your best pitch, kid.
I'll show you why everyone in the neighborhood calls me the bread-baking Babe Ruth.
All right, nice pitch!

Tomoya:
You did it again!

Akio:
You! Go apologize!
I gotta get back to work, dude!

Tomoya:
What?! You suck, old man!


Akio:
Careful! Careful!

Nagisa:
Wow...

Tomoya:
Pretty small, huh? Pretty old, too.
You looking for rats in there?

Nagisa:
Oh, no. I was just thinking it looked really nice.

Tomoya:
Well, if nothing else, it's well ventilated, I guess.


Akio:
It's not great, but it's an improvement.
Now that that's taken care of, I'm gonna return the truck and head home.

Tomoya:
Thank you for the furniture and silverware, Papa.
You're ever so kind.

Akio:
No problem, princess. Not like we were using them, anyway.
Hey, Nagisa. Have fun, but don't stay out too late.

Nagisa:
Yes, sir.

Akio:
See you later.

Nagisa:
Thanks for all your help.

Hey, Tomoya?
Uh, I think I'm gonna make us some tea.
You just sit here and relax in the meantime, okay?

Dango, dango, dango, dango, dango, dango family.

Tomoya:
I wonder if we'll live together like this someday.
That'd be nice.

Nagisa:
What was that again? I couldn't hear you.

Tomoya:
Oh, it's nothing! Never mind!


Tomoya:
See you tomorrow.

Nagisa:
Yah. Um...

Tomoya:
Hm?

Nagisa:
I know you two don't talk much, but did you tell your dad that you were moving to a new place?
I think you should at least let him know where you live.
Just in case something happens.

Tomoya:
Yeah, I guess you're right. I'll try to give him a call later.

Nagisa:
Great. First night in your new place. I hope you sleep well.

Tomoya:
Yeah, I'll try.

Tomoya:
And thus, I began living on my own.
I'm an adult now. I can't rely on anyone else anymore.
It was my first night alone. I didn't sleep too well.


Nagisa:
Tomoya, wake up. Hey. Tomoya?
Your new job starts today, remember? You're gonna be late.

Tomoya:
It tastes great.

Nagisa:
If you like, I can stop by and make dinner for you, too.

Tomoya:
Hm? I don't know when I'll be back.

Nagisa:
That's all right. I'll just wait for you.

Tomoya:
"That's all right."

Nagisa:
I'll just wait for you.

Tomoya:
Good morning, everyone!

Employees:
Hm? Huh? Morning.

Tomoya:
Uh, I... I was just...

Yusuke:
You showed up.
Go ahead and change into this.

Boss:
Morning, you two.
Yoshino, is this the kid you said who's gonna be working here?

Yusuke:
That's right, sir.
This is our boss. Introduce yourself.

Tomoya:
I'm Tomoya Okazaki.
I look forward to working with you, sir.

Boss:
I'll warn you, the first few days might be a bit rough.
But you'll get used to it after a while.
Just make sure you don't hurt yourself out there.

Tomoya:
Yes, sir. I'll try not to let you down.

Yusuke:
You really have changed, haven't you?

Tomoya:
I'm sorry?

Yusuke:
It's not a bad thing.
You just seem a little different from when I first met you.
But that only makes sense, you were just a kid after all.

Tomoya:
So does that mean I look like an adult?

Yusuke:
No. You look like a kid who's trying really hard to look like an adult.

Tomoya:
So I'm still just a kid, huh?

Yusuke:
But you're serious now.

Tomoya:
And what does that mean?

Yusuke:
Means you're learning to be an adult.
Anyway, do me a favor and try not to quit on the first day.
If I get depressed, it won't be pretty.

Tomoya:
You think I'm gonna quit?
Not when I have an apartment I have to pay for.


Yusuke:
First, grab the ladder and put it against the telephone pole.

Tomoya:
Okay!

Yusuke:
And put your helmet on straight while you're at it.
You hear me?

Tomoya:
Yes, sir!

Yusuke:
Try not to use your arms to support your body.
Put most of your weight on the rope. Trust me, it's safer.

Tomoya:
That's easy to say, but...

Yusuke:
Just do it. If you waste all your energy hugging the pole, you won't last.
Tighten the bolts in diagonal order. That's basic.
Be sure to check everything once you're finished. You got all that?

Tomoya:
Y-Yes, sir.

Yusuke:
All right, good. Then tighten these bolts.

Tomoya:
Okay.

Yusuke:
What's wrong with you?!

Tomoya:
I'm sorry!

Yusuke:
You can't afford to make mistakes on this job.
Think: What if someone was down there?
What if someone you love was down there? Then what?
That's why you gotta follow the rules at all times. Be careful. Very careful.

Tomoya:
Yes, sir.

Yusuke:
Tired already?

Tomoya:
Yeah, my whole body's aching like crazy.
Always thought I had better stamina than this...

Yusuke:
You'll get used to it.
Let's go ahead to the next site.

Tomoya:
How many more do we have left?

Yusuke:
We have four more jobs just like this one.

Tomoya:
I'm leaving. See you tomorrow.

Everyone:
Bye. Good work today.

Tomoya:
Ow... Argh...


Tomoya:
I'm home.

Nagisa:
Oh, Tomoya. You've really startled me.

Tomoya:
Sorry.

Nagisa:
Are you okay? You're not hurt, are you?

Tomoya:
No...

Nagisa:
Something really good happened to me at school today.
It turns out that Nishina's in the same music appreciation class as me.

Tomoya:
Oh...

Nagisa:
I haven't seen her in a while, but Nishina said she was worried about me.

Tomoya:
I see. That's good.

Nagisa:
Tomoya, you look really tired.
Maybe you should lay down and get some rest.

Tomoya:
No, no. I wanna hear about what happened. Go on.

Nagisa:
Okay... I guess...



Tomoya:
Good morning.

Yusuke:
You're not holding the spanner the right way.
I showed you how to do it yesterday, remember?

Tomoya:
Sorry.

Tomoya:
Right! Sorry!

Yusuke:
Did you check the junctions?

Nagisa:
I-I'm sorry.

Tomoya:
Why are you apologizing? You didn't do anything.

Nagisa:
Oh. Sorry, I can't.
I have a mock entrance exam that afternoon.

Tomoya:
I'm sorry. I hate to say that when we don't spend enough time together as it is.
