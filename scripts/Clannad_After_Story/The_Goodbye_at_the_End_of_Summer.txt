  Nagisa:
Tomoya, watch out!
Be careful, that was a close one.

Tomoya:
Sorry, I just spaced out for a second.

Akio:
Daydream all you want, but don't come crying to me when I knock out your teeth.

Boy:
I got it!

Nagisa:
Let's cheer for Dad, okay, Tomoya?
I promise he won't knock your teeth out on purpose.

Sanae:
Go, Akio!
Show them a good fight out there!

Akio:
Keep your eye on the ball, Sanae.
'Cause this home run is for you!

Sanae:
Another perfect hit!

Nagisa:
That was great, Dad! You are the best!

Akio:
Ha ha ha ha! You see that?!
Uh-oh...

Nagisa:
Uh...



Akio:
Hey, we'll play baseball.

Tomoya:
Yeah, go ahead.

Akio:
Don't give me that!
We've got another big game coming up this Sunday.
So you'd better put together a winning team for me or else!

Tomoya:
I never agreed to that!

Akio:
The guys we're playing are a bunch of shop owners from another town, but that's not the point.
The point is, these bastards are our sworn enemies.

Nagisa:
It's a big deal. Dad plays in a league for grown-ups, too.

Akio:
Anyway, our enemy's been recruiting guys who played in the High School Nationals.
It's a dirty trick, but thanks to them, our team's been on a hell of a losing streak.

Sanae:
Our team has been losing?
Is that why the neighborhood has been so depressed lately?

Akio:
So the point is, if we wanna cheer up our friends and neighbors, we gotta win this next game at all costs.
You can scrap the whole damn roster, all that matters is you put together a winning team.

Tomoya:
Yeah, but why's it gotta be me?

Akio:
You're starting your second semester, right?
I know you got plenty of buddies in the Drama Club that would be willing to help you out.
I saw how well you guys worked together at the School Festival.
With a little practice, I bet you'll make a bang-up baseball team.
Plus, if you're gonna date Nagisa, you'd better score some points with Daddy, too. Get it?

Tomoya:
Hey! You know I can't play baseball! My shoulder's no good!

Akio:
All that matters is the flame you got burning in your heart.
Light it like a fireball!

Tomoya:
You're talking crazy talk.



Tomoya:
Our last semester's starting.
I'm still staying with Nagisa's family.
As seniors, we're supposed to start thinking about our futures, but I'm still clueless.
Sometimes I think my life will be over before I figure out what to do with it.

Kyou:
You kidding? Of course I'll play with you guys!

Nagisa:
If we have you on the team, Kyou, there's no way we can lose!

Youhei:
I gotta admit, Nagisa, your dad must have a pretty keen eye for talent if he's scouting the great Youhei Sunohara.

Tomoya:
Yeah. Apparently, he sensed your amazing athletic abilities with his psychic powers.

Youhei:
What can I say?
A talent like mine can't help but shine even if I try to live a normal life.

Tomoya:
Ah, that didn't take much. Good thing he's so gullible.

Youhei:
Say what now?

Tomoya:
I'm just kidding!
You're an incredible genius, an incredible athlete, incredibly thin, providing incredible protection, even at night!

Youhei:
You called it!

Kotomi:
Tomoya, do you think I could play baseball with you, too?

Tomoya:
Uh, do you know the rules, Kotomi?

Kotomi:
I think I have a pretty good idea, since I watched you and Tomoyo when you played against the school team.
I've wanted to give it a try ever since.

Youhei:
You saw that?

Kyou:
What about you, Ryou? Are you gonna play?

Ryou:
I-I'll just cheer from the sidelines.
Sports aren't exactly my strong point.

Nagisa:
Then I guess that makes two people cheering for you.
You can't let us down. Okay, Tomoya?

Kyou:
Hm?

Tomoya:
What now?

Kyou:
Oh, it's nothing. Just cute to see you two acting like a couple.

Nagisa:
Oh, you think so?


Tomoyo:
It's not like you to call on me like this. Is something wrong?

Tomoya:
Sunohara told me he wants to get nasty with you in public.
I guess I should have known that Tomoyo would pass the strength test with flying colors.

Youhei:
I'm not your guinea pig, dammit!

Tomoyo:
What are you talking about?


Nagisa:
Thanks for joining the team, Tomoyo. We're happy to have you.

Tomoyo:
I haven't agreed to anything yet.
All I said is that I might join if you could get Misae to join, too.

Tomoya:
Misae looks like she's in pretty good shape.
We gotta make sure we recruit her no matter what.

Youhei:
Don't worry, she'll do it for me. We go way back.

Nagisa:
Isn't that Yusuke Yoshino?

Tomoyo:
Oh, yeah! The guy from the wedding, right?

Youhei:
While we're at it, we might as well ask him to join, too.
Hey, Yoshino!

Nagisa:
I don't think he can hear you.

Youhei:
Let's do a Yoshino call.

Tomoya:
A Yoshino call?

Youhei:
Yeah, like when you want an encore.
He used to be in a rock band, right? We gotta speak his language if we want him to hear us!
All together!

Everyone:
YOSHINO! YOSHINO! YOSHINO! YOSHINO! YOSHINO! YOSHINO! YOSHINO! YOSHINO! YOSHINO!

Yusuke:
Are you making fun of me, punk?!
Sorry guys, but I can't do it. I work on Sundays.

Nagisa:
Oh, I see...

Yusuke:
Gotta get back to my job. See ya.

Tomoya:
Wait a second!

Nagisa:
Tomoya, I know how you feel, but we shouldn't force him.

Tomoya:
Yoshino! My friend here, Sunohara, he really looks up to you.

Youhei:
Huh?

Tomoya:
His family is from Tohoku. Once he graduates, he'll probably never come back here again.
He wants to have one final memory of this town, with you, the guy he admires more than anyone else.
Is that too much to ask?

Tomoyo:
I never knew he meant that much...

Nagisa:
You should have said something sooner.

Youhei:
You're too good to be... I love you, man...

Tomoya:
You're not really crying, are you?

Yusuke:
I was wrong.
If I'd known, I wouldn't have been so short with you.

Tomoya:
So, you'll do it?

Yusuke:
Yeah. I'll make some time somehow.


Misae:
I'm sorry, do you need something?

Youhei:
Let's play baseball!

Misae:
I'll pass, goodbye.

Tomoya:
You know, maybe you should keep your mouth shut next time.

Youhei:
What did I do wrong?!

Tomoyo:
Please, Misae. It'll only take a second. Just hear us out!

Misae:
You people are still here?

Youhei:
Let's play base-

Tomoyo:
Why don't you take a little nap?

Misae:
Oh, it's Sakagami. Is this about the student council?

Tomoyo:
No, not this time.
It sounds strange, but I wanna play baseball with you.

Misae:
Huh? Baseball?

Tomoyo:
Yeah! Because you're my... my inspiration!
But I'd like to think of you as my rival, as well.
I know it's selfish, but if we were able to play sports together, I feel like I could learn a lot from you.
It would really mean the world to me.

Misae:
Well... I can't say no to those puppy dog eyes.


Nagisa:
I can't believe we put together the whole team!

Tomoya:
Now all we need is Mei, and we'll be set.
I wonder if she'll really show up.

Nagisa:
Hey! Why don't we ask your dad to come, too?
If he saw how hard you're working, I bet he'd be proud.
Also, I... I'd like to meet him. I've never met him before.

Tomoya:
I don't know. Maybe next time. Okay?

Nagisa:
Uh, Tomoya, wait! Come back here!


Mei:
Th-Th-Th-That's really Yusuke Yoshino, isn't it?

Nagisa:
Hi, Mei. I'm glad you could make it in time.

Youhei:
When I said she could meet Yusuke Yoshino, she jumped on the express train.

Kouko:
Believe it or not, I still remember you from high school.
I guess you had a way of standing out, huh?

Misae:
Thanks for putting up with me back then.
Anyway, you two look like a happy couple.

Yusuke:
Happy enough, at least.

Tomoya:
Wow, Misae and Kouko go way back and nobody even knew!

Nagisa:
I guess so.

Akio:
Everybody, gather around!
I'm tickled pink you could all make it here. Seriously, I appreciate it.
But it's all for nothing if we lose this.
In short, if you guys screw up, I'll make you eat Sanae's bread.
Give 'em hell out there!

Kyou:
What does he mean by Sanae's bread?

Tomoya:
You're better off not knowing.


Nagisa:
They're about to throw the first pitch!

Ryou:
Give 'em your best, Sis!

Kouko:
Good luck out there, Yu!

Sanae:
Put up a good fight! I know you can do it!

Man:
Humph, it's a pretty mismatched team you got there, pal.
You've really hit a new low.

Akio:
We'll see about that.
You say mismatched, but I'd like to think of them as one of a kind.

Umpire:
Strike!

Mei:
Whoa, that was fast!

Tomoya:
Your brother may not look tough, but he's the only one who can catch a ball like that without losing an arm.

Youhei:
My hands can't take it!

Kyou:
It's okay if you break a hand or two.
Just make sure you catch the ball, okay?

Youhei:
You're a cold-blooded monster! You hear me?!

Akio:
Three up, three down. That's a pretty good start.

Tomoya:
Huh? I never knew he was a lefty.

Kyou:
He's probably just keeping an eye on first base so he doesn't get confused and run the wrong way.

Tomoya:
Big yell for a little pop-up, huh?

Mei:
And now he's out. Ugh, so lame!

Kyou:
You're first up to bat, and you're already making us look bad.

Youhei:
That guy was a High School All-Star!
Let me see you try to hit a pitch like that!

Kyou:
All right then, don't mind if I do.

Akio:
Wow, she hit at bat.

Kyou:
How'd you like that?

Youhei:
Come on! Let me bat again!

Tomoya:
You don't know how this game works at all, do you?

Akio:
We're on the board first. Three runs and counting.
What the hell was that?! You trying to pick a fight?!

Tomoya:
One out, bases loaded. It's up to you, Tomoyo.

Tomoyo:
Okay, but I've never done this before. Could you tell me how it works?

Tomoya:
Turn your hands around.

Tomoyo:
Like this?

Tomoya:
Put your feet further apart and try to swing with your hips.
If you get a hit, run to first.

Umpire:
Strike one!

Tomoya:
Tomoyo! Don't swing unless the ball's from here to here!

Mei:
Don't give up! You can do it!

Akio:
How do you like that, assholes!

Man:
No way...

Tomoyo:
Sorry, I didn't mean to lose the ball.

Tomoya:
No, it's fine! Quick! Run around the field!


Mei:
That guy looks pretty strong.

Tomoya:
No joke. The High School Nationals are a big deal.

Kyou:
Are you okay?

Tomoya:
Old man!

Man:
Sorry, uh, my hand just slipped.

Youhei:
Did you do that on purpose?!

Man:
N-No, it was an accident, I swear.

Manager:
You're short of player, you wanna borrow one of our guys or what?

Akio:
What are you, nuts? It's my team or no team.
Our town's reputation's on the line here, we can't lose.
We're changing pitchers. You're up to the mound, Nagisa!

Nagisa:
Huh?

Everyone:
Huh?!



Ryou:
Do you think Nagisa will be okay out there?

Akio:
Truth is, there's no way we could stop these guys from getting hits even if we had an experienced pitcher out there.
But since we have a rookie that's probably gonna throw a wild, we're more likely to see a bunch of easy grounders or fly balls.

Sanae:
Come on, Nagisa! Show them a good fight!

Botan:
Puhi puhi!

Tomoya:
Nagisa, stay cool out there!

Kyou:
Even if they get a hit, we're here to cover for you, okay?

Nagisa:
Thanks. I'll give it my best shot.

Youhei:
Hi, Nagisa! Let's do this!

Tomoya:
Tomoyo!

Umpire:
Out!

Nagisa:
If it wasn't for you guys, I don't think I could have survived out there.

Misae:
It's all right, Nagisa.
We're a team, after all. That's what we're here for.

Youhei:
Okazaki!
Load up the bases for me, okay?

Tomoya:
Sure, count on a guy with a bum shoulder.

Umpire:
Strike! Batter out!

Kotomi:
The first pitch has a 62% chance of being a low-inside ball.
Bat length: 800mm. Ball size: 70mm.
Based on the length of my arms and their operating range, combined with my calculation of the ball's speed, I should be able to hit it!

Youhei:
A Texas Leaguer. Wow!

Tomoya:
Run! Kotomi, run!

Umpire:
Safe!

Kotomi:
All right! I did it!

Youhei:
This is my chance to restore my bad reputation.

Tomoya:
Is that a good thing?

Umpire:
You're out!

Kyou:
What are you, stupid?!
Kotomi gets a solid hit and you just put it to waste!

Misae:
You're the worst, Sunohara.

Mei:
Why are you so lame...

Tomoya:
And the bad reputation stands.


Akio:
No outs with a runner on third. This looks like a moment of truth.

Ryou:
Come on, Nagisa! You can do it!

Tomoya:
Right field!

Kotomi:
Hey look, I caught it!

Tomoya:
Kotomi!

Kotomi:
Huh?

Tomoya:
Throw it to home! Quick!

Youhei:
I'm here! I'm right here!

Kotomi:
I'm sorry. I forgot the runner could still tag up.

Tomoya:
Don't feel bad. Thanks to you, they only got one run instead of two.
Besides, we're still in the lead.

Akio:
They score one on us, we score one back.
Now let's see some hits!

Youhei:
Why are all the girls so much better than us?
That pitcher's hardcore and they're still getting hits left and right.

Akio:
No outs with runners on first and third! Who's up next?
Oh right, it's you, I forgot. Do a squeeze play!

Nagisa:
Uh, squeeze play? What am I supposed to squeeze?

Akio:
Never mind. Just swing the bat, okay?

Umpire:
Strike! Batter out!

Nagisa:
I'm sorry, Dad.

Akio:
Nah, that's fine. We got Tomoyo-girly here to cover for you.

Tomoyo:
Don't give me weird nicknames, old man.

Ryou:
Tomoyo! Hit us a big home run like last time!

Kotomi:
Yeah, real big one!

Tomoyo:
No way.
I don't want a big, manly hit. I want a girly, little hit that's pretty and cute.

Sanae:
Show them a good fight!

Tomoyo:
I guess girly hits are a lot harder than manly ones.


Mei:
You can do it, Okazaki! We all believe in you!

Tomoya:
With my shoulder, there's only one option...

Umpire:
You're out.

Akio:
Can't say it's my style.
But hell, it might not be a bad strategy.

Youhei:
Okazaki...
Pretty shame, you've sunk so low.

Tomoya:
It's better than hitting into a double play like someone we know.

Youhei:
Don't give me that!
A real man goes for a full swing!


Akio:
Awesome! Go, Misa-Misa!

Misae:
Stop it with the nicknames!

Tomoyo:
Yeah, there we go!

Mei:
I'm your biggest fan. You can do it.

Yusuke:
Right.

Umpire:
Strike!

Yusuke:
Come on, pull it together. You can do better than this.
I have to get a good hit for the kids' sake.

Umpire:
Strike!

Sanae:
Come on, Yoshino! Give 'em a good fight!

Yusuke:
Now watch! This is a gift... from me to you!

Misae:
If you can get him away from his job, that guy's a natural superstar.

Yusuke:
Forgive me.

Misae:
Hm?

Yusuke:
This is the only gift I can give you right now, children.
A formless treasure, a memory of our time together.
I have no money to spare, I have no material possessions to pass on. But even so...

Umpire:
You're out!

Yusuke:
Huh?!

Misae:
At any rate, don't quit your day job.

Kouko:
I'm sure he meant well, at least.


Akio:
Great. Now they've taken the lead.

Sanae:
Give 'em a good fight!

Nagisa:
I'm sorry, guys.

Youhei:
Hey, don't feel bad. It's not your fault.
Those guys are just too good.

Kyou:
You're one to talk!
They took the lead because of your wild throw!

Tomoyo:
Not to mention your sloppy play before that!

Mei:
Yeah. And right before that, you dropped a pop fly, fumbled with the ball, and put their go-ahead runner on base!


Misae:
Sorry, I tensed up.

Akio:
It's only one out. Come on, Nagisa. You're up.

Nagisa:
Oh, okay!

Mei:
Take it easy, Nagisa!

Kouko:
Just try to focus, alright?

Kotomi:
Take a deep breath and swing!

Kyou:
Relax! It's okay!

Tomoya:
It doesn't matter if you strike out!
Just swing the bat with no regrets and never look back!

Nagisa:
No regrets and never look back...

I did it!

Akio:
Yeah! You do me proud, Nagisa!

Tomoyo:
I can't hold back this time.

Akio:
That's a damn shame, but what can you do?

Yusuke:
Tell me. Am I smiling right now?

Youhei:
No, I wouldn't call that a smile.

Yusuke:
I hope that you can forgive me for letting you down like this, for this memory...
And yet, I will smile in the end!

Kouko:
Give it your best, Yu!

Yusuke:
This is a gift from me to you! Now watch!

Everyone:
Whoa!

Akio:
Sweet! Got a go-ahead runner on base!

Yusuke:
Children.

Everyone:
Huh?

Yusuke:
This is the only gift I can... time out, okay?
This is the only gift I can give you right now, children.
A formless treasure, a memory of our time together.
I have no money to spare, I have no material possessions to pass on.
But even so, formless though they may be, these precious memories will live on forever!
In my heart, I know this is true.

Man:
Uh, are you done?

Yusuke:
Yeah, thank you.

Kouko:
All right, that's my man!

Mei:
Thank you, Yoshino! Your words really touched my heart!

Akio:
Hey kid!
Two outs, bases loaded. Can't do a squeeze play now.
The rest, you're gonna have to figure out yourself.

Tomoya:
But, with my shoulder, I can't...

Sanae:
Okazaki!

Tomoya:
Hm?

Sanae:
Give 'em a fight! We're counting on you!

Kyou:
You're the only one who can bring Nagisa home safe!

Ryou:
Good luck, Okazaki! I believe in you!

Tomoyo:
I know you won't let us down out there.

Kotomi:
Don't worry, Tomoya! You do just fine!

Akio:
Give this town a win, kid!


Tomoyo:
Hey, Misae. If you don't mind, do you think I could come over and visit some time?

Misae:
Of course. Stop by whenever you like.

Kouko:
Sorry to keep you waiting!

Sanae:
Feel free to eat as much as you like!

Kotomi:
Everything looks so good, I don't know where to start!

Botan:
Puhi puhi!

Youhei:
Something's been bothering me all day.
Who is that lady? Nagisa's big sister?

Tomoya:
Er, yeah. Something like that.

Youhei:
Wow, a pair of hotties.

Mei:
Nagisa, I have a little favor to ask of you.

Nagisa:
What is it?

Kyou:
Man, that sure felt great, didn't it?
Seriously, we must be the best team ever!

Ryou:
You looked really cool out there, Sis.

Akio:
Maybe we should turn this team into a full-time thing.

Yusuke:
Anytime you want me to make some more memories, you guys give me a call.

Akio:
Everyone together now.
Here's to the Furukawa Bakers' stunning victory.

Everyone:
Cheers!


Akio:
Run!

Everyone:
Yay!



Nagisa:
Sunohara, have you ever thought about your future goals or what you wanna do with yourself?

Youhei:
Hm... Can't say it has come to mind, no.
Obviously, college is out of the question, so I guess I'll just find any old job and work any old way.
But... if I happen to find a responsible girlfriend to look after me, I bet Mei wouldn't be so worried all the time.

Tomoya:
Yeah! That's it!

Nagisa:
Well, Sunohara. Good luck out there.
