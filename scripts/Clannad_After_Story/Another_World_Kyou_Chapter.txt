  Kyou:
Hey, listen.

Ryou:
Listen, I know this is sudden, but I love you! Will you please go out with me?
I, uh... I... I'm sorry. This must be awkward. You probably don't know what to say, huh?
But I... I just couldn't keep it to myself any longer.

Tomoya:
Uh... Well, I...

Ryou:
Y-Yes?

Tomoya:
Well, I'm flattered. I know I've been eating lunch with you and Kyou a lot these past few weeks.
But I still feel like we haven't had time to get to know each other very well.

Ryou:
Yah. I guess that's true, isn't it?

Tomoya:
Er, it's not that I dislike you or anything. I just didn't see you as like... a romantic interest.
Ah... Wait, that sounds kinda rude, doesn't it? I didn't mean it that way.
But, uh... I guess if you like, we could try going out.

Ryou:
Huh?

Tomoya:
I mean, like I said before, we haven't known each other for all that long.
But in a way, that just gives us more time to work things out together.
It might not be so bad if we tried doing that as a couple instead of just plain old friends.

Ryou:
Then, do you mean...

Tomoya:
Starting now, we're boyfriend and girlfriend. That okay?
What's wrong?

Ryou:
I... I'm sorry... I... I can't help it... It's like a dream come true...
I'm so happy... Thank you... Thank you...



Tomoya:
Wow. I didn't know you wanted to go to nursing school.

Ryou:
Uh-huh. It's been my dream ever since I was little.

Tomoya:
And that must be nice.
I can't say I have given the future much thought myself.

Ryou:
Well, uh... There's no need to rush.

Tomoya:
I don't know about that.
If all I did was sit around and do nothing, I think you might be a little disappointed in me.

Ryou:
That's not true at all!
No matter what happens, I'll never be disappointed in you.
You don't have to do anything but be yourself.

Tomoya:
Thank you.

Ryou:
Huh?

Tomoya:
No one's ever told me something like that before.
I don't know... I'm kinda touched. It means a lot to me.

Ryou:
It's nothing...


Tomoya:
Hey, Kyou!

Kyou:
What are you doing?
It's Sunday, isn't it? You should be with Ryou right now.

Tomoya:
You're so nosy. It's none of your business.

Kyou:
Yeah. You're right. Sorry.

Tomoya:
No. I, uh...

Kyou:
By the way...

Tomoya:
Hm?

Kyou:
I don't know if she said, but she's had a crush on you since her junior year.

Tomoya:
Really? Wow...

Kyou:
So, are you getting along okay?

Tomoya:
Yeah, pretty well. 
She's sweet and hardworking, but also kinda shy. So I have to be careful of that sometimes.

Kyou:
Yup! That's her!
But I think shyness is actually one of her cute points.
What?

Tomoya:
I was just thinking you're a real sucker for your sister.

Kyou:
I don't think so at all. I don't know.
Say...

Tomoya:
Hm?

Kyou:
Have you two kissed yet?

Tomoya:
Huh?! N-No! Why would you ask that?!

Kyou:
That's no good. She's shy, so you gotta take the lead.

Tomoya:
Well, that's easy for you to say.
But believe it or not, this is the first time I've ever gone out with a girl.

Kyou:
Oh... You could warm up with me.
Consider it a practice kiss. What do you say?

Tomoya:
What?

Kyou:
You can just pretend like you're kissing Ryou.
Since we're twins, it's practically the same thing. Right?

Kyou:
Good! Let's stop there!
It's just a warm-up, so we can't actually go through with it, of course.
What's with that face? Did you really wanna kiss me?

Tomoya:
Why would I wanna kiss you? Are you crazy?

Kyou:
I give you a 60 out of a 100.

Tomoya:
Whatever.

Kyou:
See you later!

Tomoya:
See ya.


Boys:
I heard they were kissing in the park.
Is that true? Okazaki? That punk? With Kyou? Really?
Well, they were in the same class. They're together a lot. I know, but...

Girl:
You idiot. Shh!

Boy:
It's him!

Tomoya:
Hm?

Girls:
Pretty brave of them to do that in public, don't you think?
Doesn't seem to bother him. Wow...

Tomoya:
What's with them?

Youhei:
'Morning, Okazaki!

Tomoya:
Great. You're acting weird, too?

Tomoya:
Huh? Me and Kyou?

Youhei:
The whole school's been talking about it all day.
You two were kissing in the park yesterday, right?

Tomoya:
Oh... No! Let's see, how can I put this...
It's complicated.

Youhei:
Don't play dumb with me.
I wondered why you've been in such a good mood lately.
So are you two a couple now or what?

Tomoya:
We didn't kiss, you jackass.
Do you really think I'd pull something like that when I'm going out with her sister?

Youhei:
Huh? You and Ryou Fujibayashi?
You kidding?

Tomoya:
Is it that surprising?

Youhei:
Yeah, of course it's surprising. She's not your type at all.
Kyou, on the other hand, is a perfect fit.

Tomoya:
I don't need your advice.
So... do you think Fujibayashi's heard about this mess?

Youhei:
If she came to school, then yeah. Everybody's talking about it.

Kyou:
Oh, there you are!

Tomoya:
Uh, hey.

Kyou:
Come with me. Don't worry, it won't take long.

Youhei:
I didn't do anything!

Tomoya:
Kyou! Hey, wait a second!
Come back!


Youhei:
This isn't some kind of prank, is it? I mean, you're serious?

Kyou:
Hey, don't hurt my feelings here. It's not really that strange, is it?

Youhei:
I don't know. I just never... like, sensed any sparks between us.
But hey, maybe I never noticed, 'cause we end up seeing each other so often.

Kyou:
Yeah. That happens a lot with friends, right?
Anyway, if you don't believe me, I have an easy way to prove it.

Tomoya:
Hm?

Youhei:
Wait a second!

You're acting weird, Kyou. You don't really love me, do you?

Kyou:
Why is it so weird to you?

Youhei:
Maybe I'm just jumping to conclusions here.
But I always thought you liked Okazaki, not me.

Kyou:
No! W-What are you talking about?
I wasn't... I mean... I...


Youhei:
Just so you know, she was probably doing that 'cause of all the rumors.
I don't think she really likes me.

Tomoya:
Rumors don't matter.

Youhei:
If she's taking things this far, it might be more than rumors.


Kyou:
You're late.

Kyou:
Listen, don't pay any attention to Youhei. He's got the wrong idea about all this.
The truth is, when I saw you and Ryou getting together, I thought it might be nice to have a boyfriend of my own, that's all.
Youhei seemed like a good enough candidate, so I asked him out. But then-

Tomoya:
Are you kidding?

Kyou:
Huh?

Tomoya:
That's it? You just pick a random guy and ask him out because you think it might be fun?

Kyou:
Are you butting in because you think that's fun?

At any rate, forget about me and worry about Ryou instead. Okay?
I don't want my sister getting stressed out about this. See ya.



Vendor:
Which do you like?

Ryou:
Hey, Tomoya.

Tomoya:
Hm?

Ryou:
I just wanted to try calling you by your first name.
Is that bad?

Tomoya:
No way. Of course not.

Ryou:
It isn't strange?

Tomoya:
Not at all. I call Kyou by her first-

Ryou:
I'm too formal. I need to get over it.

Tomoya:
No. It's fine.

Ryou:
No reason for you to be formal, too, right?
Feel free to call me Ryou.

Tomoya:
Alright then, Ryou. It is.

Ryou:
Okay, Tomoya.

Ryou:
Well, I'm off.

Tomoya:
Bye.

Ryou:
Tomoya.

Tomoya:
Huh?

Ryou:
See you tomorrow.


Tomoya:
I guess I'll go to Sunohara's...
Oh. Oh, hey! Botan!

Botan:
Puhi.

Tomoya:
What's wrong, buddy?
Sorry, but today's Sunday, so nobody's here. H-Hey!

Tomoya:
Botan! Hold on a sec!

Kyou. Tell me what's wrong.

Kyou:
What? Th-There's nothing wrong.
Weren't you supposed to be on a date with Ryou right now?

Tomoya:
Kyou, you're soaking wet.

Kyou:
Stay away.
Please, just stay away.

I... I mean, you don't have to worry about me. Just worry about Ryou.
She's your girlfriend, not me.

Tomoya:
Who cares? You're still my friend and you're about to catch a cold.

Kyou:
Stop! I said no! Leave me alone! Just go away!
Don't bother with me anymore, alright?

Tomoya:
Kyou, listen.

Kyou:
Go away!

Tomoya:
Hold on!

Kyou:
Come on, stop it!

Please don't be nice to me anymore.
I'm an idiot, alright? If you're nice to me, I'll get the wrong idea.

I was afraid... I didn't wanna tell you how I felt.
Because... If I told you I loved you, and you turned me down, then maybe we wouldn't be able to be friends anymore.
But even if you did like me and we did go out, then it would just make Ryou miserable.
That's why I thought it would be best if I just gave up on you. That way, at least nobody would get hurt.
But now, I just regret it. Now I don't know what I want.
I'm so stupid. This was all my decision in the first place...

Tomoya:
Kyou. Listen-

Kyou:
Tomoya. I'm Kyou, alright?
I'm not my sister. I'm not your girlfriend.

You're too late. Bye, Tomoya.


Youhei:
Hm... Sounds like things are getting complicated with the twins.
That's your real problem, huh?

Tomoya:
What would you do?

Youhei:
What do you mean? If I was in your position?
Come on, that's obvious. We'd have a threesome!

Tomoya:
Can I punch you until you stop moving?

Youhei:
Sorry, sorry. I'll behave now.
I don't know. Seriously, this is kind of a tough one.

Tomoya:
Maybe there's nothing I can do, you know.

Youhei:
Giving up already, huh?
You think either of 'em would be happy if you just ran away?
That'd be pretty pathetic, man.

I know how you feel. Don't wanna get your hands dirty, right? Can't blame you.
But you gotta face the facts. Either way, you're gonna end up hurting one of them. You just gotta make a choice.
You probably don't wanna hear this, but the longer you take to come up with an answer, the more painful it'll be.
For Ryou, for Kyou, and for you.

Tomoya:
You're right...

Youhei:
By the way, one word on the subject. Can I say one more thing?

Tomoya:
Hm?

Youhei:
Your problems are a luxury, you know that?!

Tomoya:
Ow!

Youhei:
Good luck. I'm gonna go get something to eat.


Ryou:
Tomoya. What did you wanna talk to me about?
It's just like a TV show.
An empty classroom, a boy and girl meeting all alone after school.
First they talk, then they kiss...

Tomoya:
Fujibayashi.

Ryou:
I... thought we were using our first names now.

You know, it's something I thought about a lot. How I didn't wanna lose my sister, I mean.
I knew she had her eye on you. I knew she was in love with you, just like I was.

But even though I knew, I didn't think of her feelings at all.
I asked her to help me so that I could get closer to you.
She seemed a little surprised at first, but then a big smile spread across her face.
"Just leave it to me," she said.

Of course, I knew how she'd react. And I knew I wasn't being fair to her.
It was an awful thing to do, but I still did it. Because I wanted to be with you.

It's okay. I can try to be more like my sister if you like.
I know I'm kind of shy, but I can learn to be more outgoing if you give me some time.
I'll grow out my hair, I'll practice my cooking.
I'll be anything you want! Just please let us stay together, okay?

Tomoya:
No... No. That's terrible. I would never ask for that.

Ryou:
I don't wanna give you up, Tomoya. I still love you.

Tomoya:
I'm sorry...


Teacher:
Now, onto the next question. Fujibayashi. Aw, she's absent.
Alright then, Suzuki.

Youhei:
Aren't you going home?


Tomoya:
I never got to tell you this, but I had a lot of fun while we were going out.
To be honest, I never felt like anyone loved me or anyone needed me before. It was really nice.
We got along so well. I thought we could be together for a long time. But then I...
I ruined it for both of us.

I'm sorry. I did something terrible.
Even though I had you, I was always thinking about someone else.
By the time I realized how I felt, it was too late.
I kept quiet, I took advantage of you... Because I...
I wasn't in love with you. It was Kyou that I was really in love with. I'm sorry...

Kyou:
Tomoya.

Tomoya:
Kyou! What are you... doing here?
And... your hair!

Kyou:
She told me to come.
Ryou chewed me out. She said not to run away.
I was fine with the way things were. I just wanted her to be happy.
I didn't mean to fall in love with you. I didn't mean to hurt her.

But she told me it was too late. The damage had already been done.
That's why she said I couldn't run away.
If I really loved you, then I had to take responsibility for that.
Of course she was hurt, but there was no other way.
"Since we both fell in love with the same person, one of us would end up suffering."

I'm sure she's crying right now.
Look at us. It sure took us a long time, didn't it?
Realizing our feelings, hiding and running away...
Today, would be the last time we hurt each other, alright? For my sister, for me, and for you.

I love you, Tomoya.
I've loved you for a long, long time...


Ryou:
Please don't apologize.

Tomoya:
But...

Ryou:
If you apologize, I'll have to forgive you. And then it'll be like nothing ever happened at all.
I don't want that. I want to cherish every moment we spent together. I wanna remember it all.
The fun times, the sad times... Everything. So please... please don't apologize.

Tomoya:
I understand. Thank you.


Tomoya:
So by the way, where are we going tomorrow?
You said you wanted to do something with me, right?

Kyou:
Oh, sorry. I gotta cancel that.

Tomoya:
Huh?

Kyou:
Ryou said she wanted to go shopping together and we haven't done that in ages.
You'll have to take a rain check.

Tomoya:
Well, I guess there's nothing I can do.

Kyou:
That's right. Just be a man and take it.

Kyou:
It sure has been hot lately.

Tomoya:
No kidding.

Kyou:
Hey, are you sure you're happy picking me?

Tomoya:
Huh?

Kyou:
I mean, things would have been less complicated if you'd stuck with Ryou and I know I can be a pain.

Tomoya:
Don't say that. I'll get mad.

Kyou:
Go ahead. Get as mad as you like.
Actually, I'd feel a bit better if you did.

Tomoya:
I don't even know what you're saying anymore.

Kyou:
All right. Then I'll make it plain and simple for you.

Tomoya:
Hey! Give me a break!

Kyou:
Tomoya. I love you.
Summer's coming, isn't it?

Tomoya:
Yeah.
