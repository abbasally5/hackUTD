  Tomoya:
Your teacher's coming back from her vacation today, right?

Ushio:
Mm-hm.

Tomoya:
All right then. Guess I'd better go introduce myself.
Let's leave a little bit early, okay?

Ushio:
'Kay.

Yummy.

Tomoya:
All done. Ready to hit the road?

Ushio:
Ya!

Tomoya:
Ushio, say goodbye to Mommy before we leave.

Ushio:
I'll see you when I get back.

Tomoya:
Bye, Nagisa.

Hey, Ushio! It's dangerous, wait for me!
Ushio!



Ushio:
Nabe! Nabe!

Botan:
Gou gou!

Tomoya:
What the heck is that?

Ushio:
This is Nabe, our class pet. He's soft.

Tomoya:
Why does it seem familiar?
No way, it couldn't be...

Kyou:
You must be Ushio Okazaki's father.

Tomoya:
Y-You!

Kyou:
Hello, I'm Kyou Fujibayashi, your daughter's kindergarten teacher.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Okazaki.

Tomoya:
Uh, yes, ma'am! A pleasure to meet you, too.

Kyou:
Wow, I've never seen you make that face before.

Tomoya:
Hey, don't laugh!

Kyou:
Come on, you should have known it was me when you saw Botan.
Or maybe you've forgotten me already, Mr. Okazaki?

Tomoya:
So that giant thing really is Botan?

Botan:
Gou!

Kyou:
Sorry I never told you, Ushio, but your daddy and I used to go to the same high school.

Tomoya:
She was always real violent and mean.
She used to pick on your poor daddy all the time.

Kyou:
Hey! Stop filling your poor child's head with lies!

Tomoya:
And, she was good friends with your mommy, too. Did she tell you that?

Ushio:
Uh-uh.

Kyou:
Sanae told me this time would come.
I mean, she said you'd probably take care of Ushio someday.
So until then, she wanted me to keep everything from the past a secret.

Tomoya:
I see... She really said that?



Kyou:
Fate works in mysterious ways, doesn't it?
I never thought in a million years I'd end up as your daughter's teacher.

Tomoya:
It's been way too long. I'm sorry about that.

Kyou:
I know things have been hard on you.

Tomoya:
Yeah...

Kyou:
All of your old friends are worried about you, Ryou, and Youhei, and Kotomi.
When we all got together for New Year's a few months back, we talked about stopping by your place to pay you a visit.
But we were afraid you wouldn't wanna see us.

Tomoya:
I'm sorry...

Kyou:
But in the end, it looks like everything worked out just fine. Am I right?

Tomoya:
I guess. How's Ushio doing?
Is she getting along with everyone?

Kyou:
Yeah, she's a great kid.
She's not cynical like someone else in your family.

Tomoya:
Ah, she must have taken after her mother then.

Kyou:
She's a lot more active than her mother used to be, though.
She'll wander off on her own if I'm not paying attention. She really keeps me on my toes.

Mother:
Good morning.

Kyou:
Ah! Hello, good morning!

Boy:
Did you have a good trip?

Kyou:
I sure did. Thanks, Takuya.

Tomoya:
I'd better get going now.
Take care of Ushio for me, I'm counting on you.

Kyou:
Let me know if you ever have any problems.
I'll do whatever I can to help.

Tomoya:
Thanks. I'm glad we had this little chat, Miss Fujibayashi.

Kyou:
Hey Ushio! Your daddy's going to work now!

Ushio:
See you, Daddy. Bye-bye.

Tomoya:
Bye. Have a nice day.

Kyou:
Your daddy sure is a nice guy.
I bet you're happy to live with him now, aren't you?

Ushio:
Yup!

Kyou:
All right then, let's go inside.

Ushio:
'Kay.


Tomoya:
Fuko?

Yusuke:
Yeah. She's been wanting to visit your place for a while.
How about this Sunday? Do you have any plans?

Tomoya:
No, it's fine if she stops by. I'm just confused.

Yusuke:
Seems like she really wants to be friends with Ushio.
Hope you don't mind, it means a lot.
Now Fuko just got out of the hospital. It's good for her to step out and do things.

Tomoya:
I see. So, it's kind of a rehab, huh?

Yusuke:
Yeah, she's really shy, especially around strangers.
I haven't seen her so excited about meeting someone before, so I wanna make sure we encourage her when we can.

Tomoya:
It sounds good to me.
After all, Ushio and Fuko seem to get along pretty well already. It should be fun.

Yusuke:
That's great. Thanks a lot.

Tomoya:
Ah, no. It's fine.



Tomoya:
Oh yeah, Ushio. Someone's coming to see you tomorrow.

Ushio:
To see me?

Tomoya:
Fuko Ibuki. You remember her, don't you?

Ushio:
Yah, the weird girl.

Tomoya:
Well, the weird girl wants to come over here and play.
Is that all right?

Ushio:
Yah. I'm happy.

Tomoya:
You're happy, huh?

Ushio:
Yup. I'm happy.

Ushio:
Hey, Daddy. Sing Mommy's song for me, please.

Tomoya:
Again? You really love that song, don't you?

Ushio:
Ya. It's my favorite song.

Tomoya:
Okay, but it's late at night, so I gotta sing real quiet.

Dango, dango, dango, dango, Big Dango Family.
Mr. Grilled Dango's such a rascal, Bean Jam Dango's always sweet...



Fuko:
Fuko has come to play. Thank you for inviting her.

Tomoya:
Uh, yeah. No problem.

Fuko:
I'll get straight to the point, Ushio...
Be my sister and run away with me!

Tomoya:
You're crazy!

Fuko:
Fuko is not talking to you! Fuko is talking to Ushio and Ushio only!
Now Ushio, let's be honest, you like Fuko, don't you?

Ushio:
Hm... ya.

Fuko:
Did you hear that?!

Ushio:
But I still wanna stay with my daddy.

Tomoya:
Ha ha! D'you hear that?

Fuko:
She says that now, but I'll win her over by the end of the day!
I brought a gift! As a token of our friendship!
It's custom-made starfish bread, fresh from the Furukawa bakery!
You'll eat it for me, won't you Ushio?

Ushio:
Ya, sure.

Tomoya:
Considering your taste in things, that's actually pretty cute.

Ushio:
Well, okay. Here goes.
It's yummy!

Fuko:
Cute little Ushio eating cute little bread is setting a new record for cuteness!

Tomoya:
That's enough hugging, alright?

Tomoya:
Ushio and I are about to have lunch. You can join us if you like, Fuko.

Fuko:
My feelings won't be swayed by bribery, you know.

Tomoya:
Give it a rest!

Fuko:
Okazaki, I heard that your wife passed away a while ago.

Tomoya:
That's right.

Fuko:
I understand your feelings. I know I must remind you of her a lot.

Tomoya:
Now let me tell you something.

Fuko:
Yes, tell Fuko anything!

Tomoya:
Nagisa was absolutely nothing like you.
It's like you're not even from the same planet.

Fuko:
Y-You mean your wife was an alien?!

Tomoya:
You're the alien!

Fuko:
What?! Fuko is not an alien!

Tomoya:
I can't get inside that tiny brain of yours.

Fuko:
Rest assured, as an Earthling, my brain is full of very average Earthling-like thoughts!
The people in the neighborhood are often remarking on how I'm a perfectly average Earthling!

Tomoya:
What kind of neighbors do you have?!

Fuko:
So in conclusion, let's go home together.

Tomoya:
What does that have to do with anything?!
Besides, if the average Earthling thought like you, the world would be destroyed in less than 24 hours for sure.

Fuko:
Nothing you ever say makes any sense to me.

Tomoya:
If there was a big red button in front of you that you weren't supposed to push no matter what, then what would you do?

Fuko:
I'd push it, but only when no one was looking.

Tomoya:
Well, that's too bad, 'cause the button launches nuclear missiles.

Fuko:
Hey! That's not fair! You tricked me into pushing it!

Tomoya:
Just like I said, the world would be destroyed in no time.

Fuko:
All right, then I have a scenario for you.
If there were a pair of tights on the ground that you weren't supposed to wear no matter what, then what would you do?

Tomoya:
I wouldn't do anything.

Fuko:
You're lying!
You wouldn't be able to control yourself. You'd have to put them on!

Tomoya:
I'm so awesome!

Fuko:
You fool! Those tights were the apocalypse tights!
I know it's a little late to ask now, but did you put sleeping pills in this food?

Tomoya:
Yeah right.
What, you think I'd try to knock you out and make a move on you? Not in a million years.

Fuko:
I-I... I'm flattered to hear that you care for me so much.
But I don't think I can return your feelings.

Tomoya:
Really now...

Fuko:
You don't have to hide them, you know.

Tomoya:
Hide what?!

Fuko:
Your feelings for me!

Tomoya:
Ugh, shut up!
You know what? Just forget it! I'm not talking to you!

Fuko:
Now, now. Don't be shy!

Tomoya:
Ugh!



Fuko:
Anyway, let's play cards.
So what's your game of choice, Ushio? Blackjack? Poker maybe? Gin Rummy?

Tomoya:
You realize you're talking to a five-year old, right?

Fuko:
I didn't think of that.
I guess I'm so mature and sophisticated that I end up suggesting adult games without realizing it.

Tomoya:
Ushio, are there any games you can play?

Ushio:
I know Sevens.

Fuko:
What an enchanting choice, Ushio! That's a perfectly splendid game!

Tomoya:
Sophisticated, huh?

Fuko:
Hey, Okazaki. You have the ten of hearts right now, don't you?

Tomoya:
Let's just say I have a whole handful of cards I could use.
Alright, Ushio. You're up next.

Ushio:
This one!

Fuko:
Thanks, Ushio! That's just the one I needed!
Now I'm back in the game and ready to get my revenge.

Tomoya:
Shoot, and I tried so hard to block her.

Fuko:
Okazaki's evil scheme has been thwarted and Ushio's proven once and for all that she loves Fuko best!

Tomoya:
Get over yourself!

Fuko:
Heh heh heh...

Tomoya:
If only you were still alive...

Fuko:
Okazaki! Okazaki!

Tomoya:
Ah, oh... Sorry, I guess it's my turn, huh?

Fuko:
I'm sorry if this is hard on you, Okazaki.
I don't mean to bring up memories of your wife.

Tomoya:
I told you you're nothing like her.

Fuko:
Then what kind of person was she?
If she wasn't like me, she must have been immature, right?

Tomoya:
I don't know if it's possible to be less mature than you are.

Fuko:
She died when Ushio was born, right? So she never got to meet her.

Tomoya:
Yeah. She only knows what she looks like from pictures.

Ushio:
Ya, but I still know lots of stuff about her 'cause Daddy told me.

Fuko:
Now you've got me curious. What kind of person was she?

Ushio:
Let's see... Well, she was kind of a crybaby.
But she always did her best and she worked real hard to have me.
And I also know Daddy loved her very much.

Fuko:
I, uh...

Tomoya:
Sorry. I still think about her sometimes.

Fuko:
I have a lot of free time, so you can call me whenever you like.

Tomoya:
Huh?

Fuko:
All you have to do is ask and I'll be here.
I'll help you out any way I can, okay?

Tomoya:
I have to admit I didn't expect sympathy from you.

Fuko:
I wasn't trying to be sympathetic, I just want an excuse to play with Ushio.

Tomoya:
Ah, of course...


Fuko:
Fare thee well, Okazaki. Captain Fuko is shipping off!

Tomoya:
A simple goodbye would have sufficed.

Fuko:
Now let's make a break for it, Ushio!

Tomoya:
Oh, whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

Fuko:
You win this round, but this battle is far from over, Okazaki.
So until next time, try not to get killed in your sleep.
Don't worry. I'll say hi if I see you on the street.
And by the way, I've already committed Ushio's scent to memory.
So I'll be able to track her down if she's nearby.

Tomoya:
What are you, a bloodhound?

Fuko:
I had fun today, Ushio. Let's play again, okay?

Ushio:
'Kay.

Fuko:
Well, see you later.

Ushio:
'Kay. Bye bye.

Tomoya:
That wore me out...

Ushio:
Fuko sure is funny, huh?

Tomoya:
Yeah, I can give her that at least.
Come on. Let's clean up, take us a bath, and call it a night.

Ushio:
'Kay.


Tomoya:
Doesn't Botan get upset when she slides on her back?

Kyou:
Actually, she really enjoys it. Kinda like getting a back massage.
Hey Ushio! Your good-for-nothing daddy is here to take you home!

Ushio:
I missed you, Daddy!

Tomoya:
Sorry to make you wait.

Kyou:
Wow, you're quite the doting parent, aren't you?
What are we gonna do with your daddy, Ushio? He's so hopeless.

Ushio:
Mm-mm. No way, Daddy's cool.

Tomoya:
At least I know she's got good taste in men.

Kyou:
Just so you know, I gave Ushio a handout about our Sports Day that's coming up.
Take a look at it, alright?

Tomoya:
Sports Day?

Kyou:
Yeah. Parents participate in some of the events, so you'd better practice, Daddy.


Sanae:
Oh, yes. I already know all about Sports Day.
The president of the neighborhood board just gave us a heads-up.

Tomoya:
Oh, so, would you mind coming to cheer us on?

Sanae:
Sure. But we might do more than that...

Akio:
Whew...

Ushio:
Akki!

Akio:
What's up, Ushio? Good to see you.

Tomoya:
So, what's with the tracksuit?

Akio:
Sports Day's coming up, so I figured I'd better start training, you know.
It's gonna be a beat down, kid.

Tomoya:
I don't think they have grandpa boxing.

Sanae:
Akio has a reputation as a fast runner, so the school asked if he would be the anchor for the Teachers' Team.
The principal has a bad back, so he can't do it.

Akio:
So you're on the Parents' Team, right? This is gonna be a grudge match!

Sanae:
Oh, I was wanting to see one of those!

Tomoya:
Let's not get carried away!
I-I don't know if I'm running in the relay in the first place.

Akio:
Sanae, we gotta call the principal, make sure Tomoya's the anchor for the Parents' Team.

Sanae:
You got it, dear.

Tomoya:
You people are sick.

Ushio:
Daddy. Good luck out there.

Tomoya:
All right! I'll give it my best!

Ushio:
Go, Daddy!


Yusuke:
What the heck are you doing?

Tomoya:
I don't wanna look lame in front of daughter, so I'm working out.


Fuko:
Ushio!

Ushio:
Oh. Hi, Fuko.

Fuko:
You like going for walks, don't you?

Ushio:
Uh-huh.

Fuko:
But aren't you afraid you might get lost when you're all alone like this?

Ushio:
Get lost?

Fuko:
You know, forgetting which way to go.
Having trouble finding the right road, ending up in a neighborhood you've never seen before, surrounded by strangers.
That sort of stuff doesn't scare you?

Ushio:
Nope. Not at all.

Fuko:
That's amazing. I wish I could be like that, too.
But no matter how brave you are, it's still dangerous for little kids to be out walking alone.
Hey! Ushio, where are you going?!

Fuko:
This is that new hospital, isn't it?
Is this where you like to go when you walk?

Ushio:
Uh-huh.

Fuko:
Why is that?

Ushio:
I just do.

Fuko:
You just do, huh?


Akio:
Tomorrow's the day, isn't it?

Tomoya:
That's right. The grudge match we've all been waiting for.

Sanae:
Ushio, are you looking forward to the big race?

Tomoya:
What's wrong, Ushio?

Ushio:
I tried to, but I couldn't do it by myself...

Tomoya:
Huh?

Come on! What's wrong?!
She's burning up!



Tomoya:
First me, then my family... It's like this town is toying with us.
It grants us happiness on a whim, then takes it away just as quickly.

Tomoya:
Why can't I change anything?
Why can't I grant my daughter her only wish?
Nagisa... What should I do?
