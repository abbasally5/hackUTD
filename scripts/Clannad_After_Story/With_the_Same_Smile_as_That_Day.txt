  Kyou:
So what was that all about?

Tomoya:
What do you mean?

Kyou:
Mei's staying here, right?
It looked like you guys were having fun together yesterday.

Ryou:
We couldn't figure out what you two were doing.
I was surprised to see that Mei hadn't gone home yet.

Kotomi:
I want to hang out with Mei, too.
We can play violin for hours and hours as much as she wants.

Kyou:
That's assuming she can stay conscious, of course.

Kotomi:
Why are you such a bully, Kyou?

Nagisa:
Mei's too worried about Sunohara to go back home.
We were up all night thinking about what to do.

Mei:
We have to find a way to get him back on the team.
If he had the chance to play again, then he might get better.
He might be like the big brother I grew up with.

Kyou:
That's not gonna happen.
I get what she means, but there's no way he can go back to the team now.

Tomoya:
That's what I said, but she still wasn't convinced.

Kyou:
Sunohara wouldn't have left the club in the first place if those guys weren't such jerks.
Either way around, you're better off not getting involved with them.
Just find something else.

Ryou:
I think she is right.
The way the Soccer Club operates, there might not be much she can do.

Kotomi:
You mean they're bullies?

Kyou:
You throw that word around a lot, but for once, you hit the nail on the head.



Tomoya:
He wasn't at the dorm, either?

Mei:
No, and I asked Misae, but she said she hadn't seen him all day, either.

Nagisa:
What should we do now?
We can't ask Sunohara to join the Soccer Team if we can't even find him.

Tomoya:
Listen, Mei, are you sure you don't wanna rethink this whole thing?
I just don't think it's gonna work out.

Mei:
In that case, I'll go ask them on my own.

Tomoya:
Wait, ask who? The Soccer Team?

Mei:
If you don't wanna go, that's fine, but I have to give it a shot.
Just wait here, I'll be right back.

Tomoya:
Don't be ridiculous, I can't let you do that.

Nagisa:
Tomoya's right.
If you're going to talk to them, then we're going with you.


Soccer Club captain:
Hm? Hm? Youhei Sunohara?

Soccer Club members:
Hm?

Tomoya:
The next soccer season starts in the winter, right?
That means the seniors still have a chance to play if they like.

Nagisa:
It's just one semester, please let him play.

Soccer Club captain:
Argh, you gotta be kidding me.
I don't wanna see that little shit's face ever again.
Get outta here.

Mei:
Um, I know Youhei must have caused you a lot of trouble, but he's still my brother.

Soccer Club captain:
He sent his sister to beg for him, huh?

Mei:
I don't know what happened and I won't make excuses.
But he still deserves a second chance.
People say he's good-for-nothing, but he wasn't always like that, I wanted to-

Soccer Club member:
'Course people say he's good-for-nothing.
That's 'cause it's true.

Soccer Club member:
Yeah, so why should we waste our time with someone who ain't worth a crap to begin with?

Soccer Club member:
I thought you had the sense to know your place, Okazaki.
But I guess you're no better than him.

Soccer Club member:
Your friend there is a nice fit, too.
She got held back a grade, didn't she?

Soccer Club captain:
Why don't you little turds stick with your own kind, alright?

Nagisa:
Tomoya, don't.


Tomoya:
I'm sorry, you guys. I should have gone there myself first.

Mei:
I'm the one who suggested it.
I'm sorry for making you go through something so unpleasant.

Nagisa:
It's fine, we both knew it wasn't going to be easy.

Yukine:
Here, Mei, would you like a little refill?

Mei:
Sure, I guess I didn't realize I drank it all.

Tomoya:
Thank you, we're sorry to barge in.
I know it sounds strange, but somehow, it seemed like you were the right person to share our problems with.

Yukine:
Nothing to apologize for.
After all, it's quite common for people to come here and talk about their troubles.
So I'm perfectly used to it.

Okazaki. Could you tell me what happened between Sunohara and the Soccer Club?
If I know the whole story, then maybe I could help.

Tomoya:
It's up to you, Mei. Can I tell her?

Mei:
Mm.

Tomoya:
Back when he was a freshman, he got in a big fight with the other members of the club.
By the time he joined the team, a group of guys had already taken charge.
Since he was a new recruit, he got bossed around a lot.
It's been like that for years with that team.
They use some stupid hierarchy as an excuse to pick on people.
Anyway, as you can guess, Sunohara didn't take that very well.

Right after that, the two of us met for the first time.
I just got into a fight myself and we both ended up in the principal's office at the same time.
We've been friends ever since.

Mei:
He never said anything about that to me.

Tomoya:
At any rate, because of the fight, the team had to withdraw from the rookie tournament that year.
After that, Sunohara quit and never came back.

Nagisa:
And even after all this time, those guys in the Soccer Team still blame him for what happened.

Yukine:
I see, but even if they did accept him, would he have any fun playing soccer on a team like that?

Mei:
I don't really know, but either way, I still feel like soccer's the only way to get his life back on track.

Tomoya:
You may be right.
Still, I don't see much point in getting worked up about this when he's not even around.

Mei:
Poor Youhei... What am I gonna do with him?

Yukine:
I'm not sure if I mentioned it before, but I have an older brother myself.

Nagisa:
Actually, I don't think you've ever talked about yourself, Miyazawa.

Yukine:
My brother hardly ever went to school, he spent all of his time fooling around, and he was always getting into fights.
In fact, he was even picked up by the police a few times.

Mei:
That must have been really hard on you.

Tomoya:
I never knew.

Yukine:
Siblings can be strange sometimes.

Mei:
But no matter what, you still love your brother, don't you?

Yukine:
To be honest, I used to be afraid of him.
But as time went by, I started to understand him a bit better.
There are a lot of wonderful things about him.
He just has a hard time showing his good side to people.
He can be a bit awkward, but deep down, I think he is sweet.

Tomoya:
You know, it's funny.
I think Sanae said the same about Sunohara.

Yukine:
Don't worry, Mei.
I'm sure there are plenty of wonderful things about Sunohara as well.
Even if things don't work out with the Soccer Team, all he needs is a chance to shine, and he'll be back to the brother you loved in no time.

Mei:
So, how are things between you and your brother now?

Yukine:
Oh, we're very close, of course.


Tomoya:
Sunohara, what were you doing yesterday?

Youhei:
Huh? It's none of your business.

Tomoya:
Aren't you worried about Mei? After everything we said?

Youhei:
That's funny coming from you. Isn't it your job to take care of her now?
Besides, I'm busy with Sanae. I don't have time to worry about every little thing Mei does.

Tomoya:
And that's it? You really mean that?

Youhei:
Yeah, of course I meant it.
I'm leaving Mei to you. Take good care of her, okay?

Tomoya:
Come on, don't give me that crap.

Youhei:
What are you so pissed off about?
I'm sure Mei doesn't care about me either.

Tomoya:
SUNOHARA!!!

Ryou:
Okazaki! Sunohara!

Tomoya:
Don't you know what Mei's doing right now?! Huh?!

Youhei:
What? Other than having fun with you?
What are you getting at?

Tomoya:
Ask the Soccer Team what she's been doing!
Then you try and tell me your sister doesn't care about you anymore!

Youhei:
You're not making any damn sense.
Just come out and say it.

Ryou:
Okazaki, please let him go!
What are you fighting about?!

Youhei:
You really wanna do this, Okazaki?

Kyou:
Okay, break it up!
What are you doing? Who started this?

Kotomi:
Ryou, why are they fighting?

Ryou:
I... I don't even know.

Kotomi:
Tomoya, Sunohara, you two are friends, you are not supposed to fight.

Tomoya:
Tut.

Kyou:
Tomoya!

Kotomi:
Tomoya, wait!

Ryou:
Sunohara, hey, please just tell me what happened.


Mei:
You got into a fight?

Tomoya:
Yeah, I kinda lost it for a sec.

Mei:
So where's Youhei now?

Tomoya:
I know he's cutting class at least.
He's probably just screwing around somewhere.

Mei:
Oh, I see.

Tomoya:
You're gonna talk to the Soccer Team again?

Mei:
Uh-huh. I was thinking about it and after hearing Miyazawa's story yesterday, I felt like I couldn't give up just yet.
Uh, wait, I really can do it by myself this time.
This is between me and my brother, I don't wanna trouble you with my problems anymore.

Nagisa:
Don't say that, Mei, it's no trouble at all.

Tomoya:
I know how you feel, Nagisa, but just leave this to us.

Nagisa:
Huh? Why? Is something wrong?

Tomoya:
You saw what kind of thugs they have on the Soccer Team.
Who knows what might happen if we make them angry?
There's no reason for me and Mei to put you in danger.

Nagisa:
I can't let you do that!
If it's that dangerous, then I don't want you two to go alone!

Tomoya:
Yeah, but if a big fight breaks out, then what?
If they start throwing punches, I won't be able to look out for you and Mei at the same time.

Nagisa:
In that case, we'll be fine.
I'll just take Mei and we'll run away together.
That way, even if something happens to you, Mei and I will still have each other to count on.

Tomoya:
When it comes to stuff like this, you really are stubborn as hell, aren't you?


Soccer Club captain:
Can't take no for an answer, huh?

Tomoya:
Yeah, I know it's a long shot.

Nagisa:
We're begging you.
Please, please let Sunohara back on the team!

Mei:
He doesn't even have to play in any real games, just let him practice with the team and we'll be happy!

Soccer Club captain:
And then what? Sure, we could do it, but what's in it for us?
Why would we want some punk ass bitch get in our way?

Mei:
If there's something you want, then just tell me and I'll do it for you!
I don't care what it takes!

Soccer Club member:
Come on, captain, hurry! Let's get back to practice!

Soccer Club member:
Forget about those guys! We got better things to do!

Soccer Club captain:
Right!

Mei:
No, you can't leave!

Tomoya:
I know we're being unreasonable, but please give us a chance.
I'm begging you!

Soccer Club captain:
Wow. I've never seen Okazaki bow his head to someone like this.
I heard you weren't the same old punk you used to be, guess it's true.

Mei:
Okazaki...

Soccer Club captain:
Why don't you be a ball boy or something?

Mei, Nagisa:
Thank you very much!

Mei:
You're the best, Okazaki! That was wonderful!

Nagisa:
You were amazing, Tomoya!

Tomoya:
It's not that big of a deal.
Now let's do a good job fetching the balls.

Mei, Nagisa:
Right!



Tomoya:
Take it easy, alright, Nagisa?
Don't push yourself too hard and get hurt.

Nagisa:
I'm fine. Don't worry about me, just keep an eye on Mei.

Soccer Club member:
Come on, ball boy! Go get it!

Tomoya:
On my way!

Soccer Club member:
Hey, ball girl, look alive!

Nagisa:
Right!

Soccer Club member:
Don't just stand there, dumbass!

Mei:
Okay!

Soccer Club captain:
What are you, blind?!
In case you didn't notice, the team is over here!

Mei:
I'm sorry!

Soccer Club member:
There goes another one!

Soccer Club member:
What the hell are you doing? Go get it!

Mei:
Okay!

Soccer Club member:
Come on, speed it up!

Nagisa:
Tomoya...

Tomoya:
They're doing this on purpose.

Soccer Club member:
What's the matter? You worn out already?

Tomoya:
Nagisa, Mei, are you all right?

Nagisa:
Yah.

Mei:
Yah, just need to... catch my breath.

Tomoya:
You two take a break!

Nagisa:
Oh, no! Are you okay?

Tomoya:
Those assholes...

Mei:
No, it's my fault.
I-I just wasn't paying attention, that's all.

Nagisa:
Mei, stop... Please...

Mei:
I... I'm fine. Really, it was nothing.

Soccer Club captain:
Hey, wake up out there!

Mei:
Got it!


Mei:
I-I think that does it...

Soccer Club captain:
Alright, good job.

Nagisa:
Where, uh, are the other team members?

Soccer Club captain:
They went home.

Mei:
Huh?

Soccer Club member:
Practice is over. What'd you expect?

Soccer Club member:
Just talk to us, we'll pass it along to the other guys, okay?

Soccer Club captain:
So, what do you want?

Mei:
It was my brother, Youhei Sunohara, remember?
We wondered if he could join the team again.

Soccer Club captain:
Oh, yeah. Sorry, can't do it.

Mei:
Huh?

Soccer Club captain:
We don't want a loser like him on the team.
That's why we kicked him off in the first place.

Soccer Club member:
I know, that guy's useless, right?

Soccer Club member:
He never stops running his mouth, either.
Needs to learn some manners.

Soccer Club member:
They say he sucks at soccer, sucks at school, and fails at life.

Soccer Club captain:
He can be a screw-up on his own time.
But we don't need trash like him stinking up the team.

Nagisa:
But you said...

Tomoya:
What's your problem?

Soccer Club captain:
You guys need to wake up already.
Why don't you ask Sunohara about this plan of yours?
He knows what you're up to.

Tomoya, Nagisa:
Huh?

Soccer Club captain:
Oh, yeah, he was asking one of the freshman kids about it.
And now what do you know? He still doesn't have the guts to show up.

Soccer Club member:
That little punk left you out in the cold.
He makes his sister do all his dirty work and he pussies out and runs away. What a joke!

Soccer Club member:
He's useless. Stop wasting your time on him.

Nagisa:
Oh, Mei...

Soccer Club member:
Oh, man! You made her cry!

Soccer Club member:
Enough of this crap already. Go home!

Mei:
Y-You're wrong! My brother isn't running away, he'll come!
You just wait!

Soccer Club member:
And I'm telling you he ain't coming.

Mei:
He is! I know it because my brother always comes when I'm in trouble!

Nagisa:
Don't cry...

Soccer Club member:
What, have you got brain worms or something?

Soccer Club member:
Go figure, I guess stupidity runs in the family.

Soccer Club captain:
Come on! That's all you got?!
If you don't scream louder, your big brother won't be able to hear you!

Tomoya:
Cut it out! What's wrong with you?!

Soccer Club member:
What? You gonna take all of us on by yourself?

Soccer Club captain:
Come on!

Mei:
Stop! That hurts!

Tomoya:
Let her go!

Nagisa:
Tomoya, wait!

Tomoya:
I'm sorry, Nagisa.
I shut my mouth and I held my temper for Mei's sake, but I've had enough!

Mei:
Youhei!

Soccer Club captain:
Scream! Come on!

Youhei:
Don't make my little sister cry!

Tomoya:
Huh?!

Youhei:
You mess with her and then you mess with me, you got that?!

Soccer Club member:
Little shit!

Mei:
Youhei, no!

Nagisa:
Sunohara!

Tomoya:
Nagisa, take Mei and get out!

Nagisa:
Okay!

Mei:
No, stop it! Youhei!

Tomoya:
Don't forget about me!


Soccer Club captain:
You guys are messed up in the head...

Soccer Club member:
Let's get the hell outta here!

Youhei:
Hey, Okazaki... Did we win?

Tomoya:
I don't know... But I'm pretty sure we didn't lose....
You idiot...

Youhei:
Who are you calling an idiot?

Tomoya:
Who the hell do you think?
You'd better apologize to Mei.

Youhei:
Huh? Why?

Tomoya:
If you had your goddamn act together, none of this crap would have happened in the first place.
Man, you really are a terrible brother.

Youhei:
You picking a fight with me?

Tomoya:
Yeah, I guess.

Nagisa:
Come on, you two! What are you doing?

Mei:
Please don't fight, I have had enough!

Tomoya:
You son of a bitch!
Do you have any idea how much Mei has been suffering because of you?!
You're the one who's supposed to be taking care of her!

Youhei:
That's enough!

Tomoya:
You're Mei's brother, aren't you?!
Why don't you think about her feelings for once?!

Youhei:
But I did!

Tomoya:
Don't give me that!
Your little sister starts sleeping with a guy like me and you don't do a damn thing about it?!
You weren't even worried?!

Youhei:
Of course I was worried!

Tomoya:
Then why didn't you do something about it, huh?!
If you got an excuse, I'm dying to hear it!

Youhei:
I let it go because it was you, dammit!

Tomoya:
Argh!

Youhei:
And what the hell were you thinking with this soccer crap?
You put your nose in it and I have to bail you out!

Nagisa:
It's over now! Just let it go!

Mei:
Please stop fighting!

Youhei:
Why didn't you protect Mei, huh?
I thought you were her boyfriend!

Tomoya:
Shut up! You bastard!

Youhei:
You dumped Nagisa because you wanted to be with Mei, right?
Then you'd better get your shit together, dammit!

Mei:
You two please stop fighting!

Nagisa:
Please, that's enough! Stop hurting each other!

Youhei:
Huh? Nagisa, what are you doing here?
Asshole!

Mei:
Youhei, stop it! That's enough, okay?
I'm sorry, Big Brother. I didn't want this, I just... I...

Youhei:
Mei, I...


Nagisa:
I don't know, Tomoya, maybe you should stay home from school today.

Tomoya:
Well, you were with me the whole time.
Don't you think you should stay home from school, too?

Nagisa:
I'm fine. At least, I wasn't hurt.

Tomoya:
Hm?

Kyou:
What happened to you?

Ryou:
They're all beat-up.

Kotomi:
It looks like they're having fun to me.


Tomoya:
I got a letter from Mei.

Youhei:
A letter? Would have been faster if she just called you.
She really wanted to make a big impression, I guess.

Tomoya:
She told me to take care of her big brother.
Guess we made a good impression pounding on each other 'cause she said she wants to find a best friend just like me.

Youhei:
Huh, it's funny because I guess it's true when people say the friends you make in school will be your friends for life.
But since we can't act this stupid forever, I say we should enjoy it while we still can.

Tomoya:
Probably so.

Youhei:
Just one more semester and then it's all over, wow.


Tomoya:
Alright, there's the old man.

Youhei:
Oh, man. I'm really starting to freak out right now!

Tomoya:
You gonna give up?

Youhei:
I shan't, for Sanae is my angel and I would face the fires of hell for her love.

Tomoya:
Alright then, good luck with that.

Youhei:
Hello, sir!

Akio:
Huh? Oh, you're that Sunohara kid, right?
What's up? Here to buy some bread?

Youhei:
Sir, please allow me to marry your sweet Sanae!

Akio:
Huh?

Sanae:
What's wrong, honey? You look upset.

Youhei:
H-Honey?!

Nagisa:
Tomoya, you mean even after all this time, you still haven't told Sunohara the truth about my mom?

Youhei:
Huh?! Your mom?! Say what?!

Sanae:
That's right. Akio and I are husband and wife.

Youhei:
WHAAAAAT?!

Akio:
You trying to make a move on my woman, punk?! You're gonna die!
Get back here!

Tomoya:
It's funny. I don't think I'll ever forget the first time I met Sunohara.

Tomoya:
Some weird guy with bleached hair and bandages.
I couldn't help laughing the moment I saw him.
Actually, I think that was the first time I really laughed since I came to that school.
He might have looked stupid, but it was the kinda stupid I wanted in on.
Not much of a story, but that's how we met.
Ever since then, we've been together all the time.
Ever since then, we've been laughing. We still are now.



Misae:
Yeah, what a coincidence. Um, if you like, we could...

Igarashi:
Hey, who's that?

Misae:
Huh?

Igarashi:
Looks like he's from a different school than us.

Misae:
I'd be walking home with Igarashi right now!

Tomoya:
It seems that you have a bunch of fans in my class, too.

Misae:
Well, I'm glad people still like me at least, though I'm not sure what they see in a woman who scolds people all the time.

Tomoya:
But the thing is, in a dorm full of filthy guys, you're like a princess.
Like a diamond in a dunghill, I guess.
