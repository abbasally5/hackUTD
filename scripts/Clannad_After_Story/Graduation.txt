  Sanae:
Sorry, Tomoya. Akio must have sneaked out while I wasn't looking.
You know him. He's always running off to play.

Tomoya:
That's a shame. I really needed to talk to him.

Sanae:
I'm so sorry about your father. That must be hard on you.

Tomoya:
I'm fine. I'm the one who should be sorry.

Sanae:
Don't say that. None of us feel that way.
Not me, not Akio, and certainly not Nagisa.

Tomoya:
Wish everyone else was like that.
Who knows if I'll ever get a job offer that good again? It's not fair.

Sanae:
If your life can change once, it can change again for the better.
Besides, I'm sure Nagisa will follow you to the end no matter how many twists and turns your life might take.

Tomoya:
Yeah. That's what she told me.

Sanae:
If she says she'll stay with you, she means it.

Tomoya:
Thanks for your support.

Nagisa:
Sorry to keep you two waiting.

Sanae:
There! Maybe some tea will cheer you up.

Tomoya:
Sure.

Sanae:
Speaking of cheering you up, I just made a new kind of bread, I can't wait for you to try out.
Wait right here. I'll go get some.

Akio:
Oh? My little princess came to visit?

Nagisa:
"Visit"? I still live here.

Tomoya:
Playing baseball as usual?

Akio:
I do other stuff. Anyway, what are you doing here?

Tomoya:
I called you, remember?
I said I was stopping by for something important.

Akio:
Buying bread's not that big of a deal. You don't have to call ahead.

Tomoya:
Who said I came here to buy bread?

Akio:
I hate to break it to you, kid, but you're not getting a discount just 'cause you're my daughter's boyfriend.
Actually, I should charge you double, well, except for Sanae's bread.
You're gonna have hers for the regular price.

Nagisa:
Dad, Mom's right behind you.

Sanae:
Oh... I see how it is now...
My bread's nothing but... It's nothing but regular price to you!

Akio:
Wait! Is regular price all that bad?

Nagisa:
He doesn't mean it!

Akio:
I love your bread!

Tomoya:
Old man! I need to talk to you, alright? It's important.

Akio:
I see. So that's why you're here.

Tomoya:
Yeah. A man-to-man talk.

Akio:
All right, in that case... We'll have a duel.



Akio:
You're long overdue for a beat down.

Tomoya:
Why did I agree to this again?

Akio:
Come on, I'll show you why everyone in the neighborhood calls me the bread-baking Cy Young.
Here goes my 100-mile-an-hour fastball! Hit it if you can!

Tomoya:
You know about my shoulder.
Why do you always make me do this crap?

Akio:
So says the guy who got the game-winning hit the last time we played.
Listen, I'm not saying you gotta hit a home run.
Just saying you gotta hit something, alright?
As long as it ain't a grounder or a pop fly, you're good. You win the duel.

Tomoya:
Sure those are the rules you wanna play by?

Akio:
Yeah. If you win, then I'll listen to whatever you have to say.

Tomoya:
Listening isn't good enough.
You have to agree to whatever I say. No objections.

Nagisa:
Tomoy...

Akio:
Alright, fine. If you score a solid hit, I'll do anything and won't complain.
But if I win, I ain't listening to a single word you say. Fair enough?

Tomoya:
Yeah.

Akio:
Sounds like fun. Here we go, kid.


Akio:
Let me know when you're ready to lose again.

Nagisa:
Are you all right?

Tomoya:
I'm sorry... What the hell was I thinking?
This is too important to bet on a stupid game of baseball.

Sanae:
Don't give up yet. If you work hard enough, you can do it.

Tomoya:
Huh?

Sanae:
Stand up and keep fighting. You have to win for Nagisa's sake.


Yusuke:
What's this all of a sudden?

Tomoya:
I've been challenged to a duel to decide my future.

Yusuke:
Huh?

Akio:
Hm. This kid doesn't know when to quit, does he?

Nagisa:
You can do it.

Sanae:
Come on, boys! Show us a good fight out there!

Akio:
My forkball drops a solid meter, better keep your eyes open.

Tomoya:
What are you, a pro?

Akio:
Better luck next time!


Akio:
Why the hell do I have to play in the rain?
Couldn't this wait until tomorrow?

Tomoya:
This is a duel. I don't care if it's rain or shine.

Sanae:
Don't worry, you two! I'll get a bath ready when you're done!

Akio:
All you're doing is wasting my time. This is your last chance.

Tomoya:
Then let's do it.


Akio:
You can't win.
It's tough, but sometimes you gotta face the facts. I'm better than you, kid.

Nagisa:
Tomoya.

Tomoya:
I'm sure he knows by now. I can tell.

Sanae:
He knows? Knows what?

Tomoya:
It's like he's saying I'm just a kid. This isn't a fight I can win right now.
I was stupid to think I could protect anyone. I still have a long way to go.

Sanae:
I think you're reading into it too much.
Akio always acts like that. Don't take it personally.
Come on, I'll make you a nice bath.

Tomoya:
No, not yet. If I can't beat him in skill, I'll just have to beat him in willpower.
I'm gonna stay and practice.

Nagisa:
But you-

Sanae:
He's right.

Nagisa:
Don't encourage him!

Sanae:
I know this is important to you.
If you're determined to keep fighting, then I won't stop you.

Tomoya:
Thank you.

Sanae:
At any rate, I'm going back to the bakery to make a bath for Akio.
You come on, too, Nagisa.

Nagisa:
But I...

Sanae:
Nagisa, when two men are dueling for their lives, you have to stand back and respect that, okay?

Nagisa:
Now I guess so.

Sanae:
Nagisa?


Nagisa:
Oh, Dad.

Tomoya:
Old man.

Akio:
Sure is coming down hard.
Guess it's another rainy autumn, huh?

Hit or miss, this is the last pitch you're gonna get. Ready?


Nagisa:
Tomoya!

Sanae:
Home run!

Tomoya:
Give me Nagisa's hand in marriage!

Akio:
Look at that. Just like me when I was that age.

Sanae:
Really honey, I've known you were alike since I first met him.
You're two of a kind.

Akio:
I was in a hurry to grow up, even though I didn't know why.
Guess kids never learn, do they?

Sanae:
All the more reason you should understand.

Akio:
Pick your head up.
If you ever make my little girl suffer, then I'm taking her back from you.
You don't wanna test me on that, kid.

Tomoya:
Then, you mean...

Nagisa:
Thank you, Dad.

Sanae:
Tomoya, Nagisa isn't just our daughter, she's our hope.
So I want you to know that from today on, you're part of that hope, too.
So never forget, your happiness is our happiness, as well.
In other words, try your best to be happy, okay?



Tomoya:
Before long, autumn changed into winter.
Since I didn't have to work on Christmas, Nagisa and I spent the day together.

Akio:
I feel like I've been waiting for this all my life!
The day I can finally have a drink with my daughter!

Tomoya:
This is your first time drinking sake, huh?

Nagisa:
Yes. It's a new experience for me.

Sanae:
Nagisa, no need to force yourself, okay?

Nagisa:
No, I can have one cup at least.
I have to, for Dad's sake.

Akio:
Nagisa...
You have no idea how proud I am to call you my daughter.

Tomoya:
Booze really means a lot to you...

Nagisa:
Here I go.

Akio:
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Just look at her go!

Tomoya:
Uh, you look dizzy. Are you alright?

Nagisa:
Hi, Tomoya... You're so far away... Why are you spinning?

Tomoya:
Huh?

Nagisa:
I like you up-close...

Tomoya:
You're drunk already, huh?

Nagisa:
I'm not drunk! How dare you!

Tomoya:
I hate to break it to you, but that's what all drunks say.

Nagisa:
Tomoya...

Sanae:
You two are so lovey-dovey!

Tomoya:
I don't think "lovey-dovey" is the word for this!

Nagisa:
Hey, Tomoya!

Tomoya:
Uh, yes?

Nagisa:
I see you staring at my mom! You cut that out!

Tomoya:
What the heck are you talking about?

Sanae:
Yeah, Tomoya. Like, what's the deal, huh?

Tomoya:
Huh? Aw, now you've got Sanae drinking, too! Great!

Sanae:
Oh my, Tomoya.
Could it be you've taken an interest in little old me?

Nagisa:
Bored with me already, Tomoya?!

Akio:
Whoa! Here comes the catfight!

Tomoya:
One of those cats is your wife, you know.

Nagisa:
Come on, Tomoya! Who do you like better?!

Sanae:
Oh my... Is he gonna confess his love to me?

Tomoya:
What do you mean? Of course I-

Akio:
Pick Sanae! Her boobs are bigger!

Nagisa:
Hey, buddy! What are you getting all flustered about, huh?

Akio:
That proves he likes Sanae after all!

Tomoya:
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

Sanae:
You don't like me?

Tomoya:
No, it's not that!
I mean, I like you as a person, you know.

Nagisa:
You admit it?!

Tomoya:
Ahhhhh! What the hell did I do to deserve this?!

Akio:
Alright, I think we've teased the boy enough.
Who cares if he likes you or not? You got me, don't you?

Sanae:
I wasn't teasing him. I was serious.
I might be interested myself.

Akio:
What?!

Nagisa:
Make up your mind, Tomoya!

Akio:
Don't leave me, Sanae! I need your love!


Akio:
Look at that. Sleeping like a baby.

Sanae:
Nagisa sure is happy, isn't she?

Akio:
Sure seems that way.

Sanae:
What about you, Tomoya? Are you happy?

Tomoya:
Yeah, of course I am. All I want is to be with her.
It's funny, I guess that's all I ever needed.

Tomoya:
When her last semester came around, Nagisa's condition worsened again.

Sorry, maybe I dragged you around too much during the break.

Nagisa:
Oh, no. It's not your fault.
This always happens around this time of year.

Tomoya:
Will you be able to graduate?

Nagisa:
It should be okay. I wouldn't worry about it.
Even if I miss the rest of the year, I attended enough days in my last semester to pass.

Tomoya:
I see. Well, that's a relief at least.

Nagisa:
Yah.


Tomoya:
On the day of the graduation ceremony, Nagisa stared out towards school from the window in her room.

Mei:
Hello, Sunohara residence.

Tomoya:
Oh, hi Mei. It's, uh, Okazaki.

Mei:
Huh? Oh, Okazaki! Wow, it's been a while.

Tomoya:
So, how are you doing?

Mei:
Oh, I'm fine. Same old same old.
How are you and Nagisa?

Tomoya:
You know, not bad. Is Sunohara around?

Mei:
Actually, he's not living here right now. He's staying in a dorm.

Tomoya:
A dorm?

Mei:
Yeah, his company's dorm.
Hold on just a sec. I'll get the number for you.

Youhei:
Yes, can I help you?

Tomoya:
Sunohara? It's me. Your pal, Tomoya.

Youhei:
Huh? Okazaki? Seriously?

Tomoya:
Yeah. How's it going?

Youhei:
I'm fine. Work kind of sucks.
What a stupid stuff goes on at this company. Actually, you got a minute?

Tomoya:
I'd like to hear about it, but some other time.
I have something important to ask you. Uh, so, here's the deal...

Whatever date and time works for you, works for me.
I still have to coordinate things with everyone else, but I'm sure it'll work out somehow.
You in?

Youhei:
I'm in the middle of training right now.
If I leave the dorm without permission, they'll fire me for sure.

Tomoya:
Deal with it.

Youhei:
You don't even care?!

Tomoya:
Aw, come on. You can swing it for a day, can't you?

Youhei:
I'm telling you it's not that simple.
This company isn't very flexible. Trust me.

Tomoya:
Please! Do it for me!

Youhei:
You mean for Nagisa, right?
Alright, I'll come up with something.

Tomoya:
That's better.

Youhei:
So much trouble for someone else's girlfriend.
I can't believe it, I must really be a nice guy, huh?

Tomoya:
Of course. That's why I'm asking you.

Youhei:
Alright. You can always catch me at this hour, so call me again some time.

Tomoya:
Yeah, you bet.


Nagisa:
Wow... The cherry trees are so pretty.

Tomoya:
Aren't you glad you came?

Nagisa:
Being together like this really brings back memories.
It makes me realize how nice it was to walk to school with you every morning.

Tomoya:
Yeah, same here.

Nagisa:
Are you sure we can go in here without permission?

Tomoya:
Nah, it'll be fine. I got it all worked out.

Nagisa:
Hm?

Kyou:
Nagisa!
Hey!

Youhei:
Hey, Nagisa. It's been a while.

Tomoya:
Who the hell are you?

Youhei:
Really? We haven't seen each other in months and that's what you say?

Kyou:
I know. Pretty funny, huh?
When I saw him, I was like, "Who the heck invited this guy?!"

Botan:
Puhi puhi!

Misae:
Yeah, we were making fun of Sunohara the whole time we were waiting for you guys to show up.

Kotomi:
I think it's a little depressing in a way.
Sunohara just isn't Sunohara without his blond hair.

Ryou:
In that case, why don't we dye it for him before he goes back home?

Youhei:
You're gonna get me fired!

Rie:
It feels like I haven't seen you in ages.
Are you doing all right?

Nagisa:
Huh? Oh, yeah. I'm better now.

Yukine:
I'm just glad this worked out.
I was afraid we wouldn't get to see each other like this again.

Tomoyo:
Yeah. We were all disappointed when we found out you weren't coming to graduation.
But I imagine it was even harder on you.

Sugisaka:
I can't believe Rie and I were able to make it today.
Guess it just happened to work out.

Harada:
I'm surprised a lot of us could make it.
The fact that we're all here today is practically a miracle.

Yusuke:
Yeah. If anything, I'd say this is the miracle of love.

Mei:
Oh my gosh, Yoshino! You're so right!

Nagisa:
W-Wait. I don't know what's going on.

Ryou:
It's a graduation ceremony.
For you, Nagisa.

Nagisa:
Huh?


Kouko:
We had to pull a few strings, but luckily we had Mr. Koumura on our side.
Since he worked here for so long, they didn't mind lending him the school.

Koumura:
I'm happy to help.
I couldn't turn down a request from one of my last students.

Tomoya:
It really means a lot, sir. Thank you.

Koumura:
And now, without further ado, let's begin the graduation ceremony.

Koumura:
Nagisa Furukawa.

Nagisa:
Yes, sir.

Koumura:
Congratulations, young lady.
This graduation diploma certifies that you have completed this school's prescribed curriculum.

Nagisa:
Thank you very much, sir.

In the time I spent at this high school, I worked hard, and faced many challenges.
I'm always shy around strangers. I'm not very good at making friends, either.
That became a big problem for me when I got sick and had to repeat my senior year.
In the spring when I started my second year as a senior, I found myself all alone in my new class. It was really crushing.

It was like time had carried on without me, and the world had left me behind.
When I realized that, suddenly I couldn't move forward anymore.
That's why I stood there each morning, frozen at the bottom of this hill.

But then, Tomoya showed up and gave me the courage I needed to climb that hill.
After that, I met all sorts of wonderful people.
Thanks to the help of all my friends here, I was able to form the Drama Club.
And even though I was being selfish, you helped me put on a play for the School Festival.

But then, in the next semester I got sick just like before.
And even though so many of friends graduated, I had to repeat my senior year again.
Even still, I was determined to try my best.

I wanted to fight, to grow stronger than I was before.
Even if my body was weak, I wanted to live my life with all the strength I could.
And all the people standing here today were the ones who gave me the courage to do that.
But it was even harder than I thought since Tomoyo, Miyazawa, and Nishina all ended up in different classes from me.
Although I had friends, I started the semester alone again, just like I did a year before.

Despite all that... Despite how tough it was for me...
I think the time I spent at this school is priceless, and I wouldn't trade it for the world.
Yes, it took me five years to graduate and it wasn't always fun, but I still love this school.
Because it's the place where I gave it my all every single day.
Thank you. I couldn't have done it without you.

Koumura:
Hm. Congratulations on graduating.

Tomoya:
And so, at long last, Nagisa's time at this school finally came to an end.


Tomoya:
Anyway, we're going to get married.

Naoyuki:
I see. Congratulations.

Nagisa:
Thank you very much.

Naoyuki:
Ah... I'm sorry, Nagisa, was it?

Nagisa:
Yes. That's right, sir.

Naoyuki:
Take good care of him, Nagisa.

Nagisa:
Yes, sir. I will.

Naoyuki:
I wish you both the best.

Tomoya:
We registered our marriage without a ceremony.

Nagisa Okazaki.
It's funny. But somehow it makes me happy just to hear that.



Tomoya:
Calm down.
Come on, Tomoya, you've heard her taking a bath at her house plenty of times.
It's no big deal.

Nagisa:
Ahhh!

Tomoya:
What's wrong?!

Nagisa:
I'm sorry. I didn't know the water would be so cold.

Tomoya:
And thus, Nagisa and I began our new life together.
