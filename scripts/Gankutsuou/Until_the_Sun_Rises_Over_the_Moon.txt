  PROLOGUE:
Mesdames and messieurs, good evening. At Luna's Carnival, I encountered an immature soul. My friend turned and said to me, "This shall be the prelude to my vengeance." But this soul was too young and beautiful. It is that alone which gives me cause to fear.



Gankutsuou
Act 2: Until the Sun Rises Over the Moon



Shall we go?

All right! That's enough fun and games, for now.


So you met him, hmm?

My, you look so bored.

No. Not at all. It's a wonderful party.

Where is your friend?

Oh, you mean Albert? Probably trying to pick up girls. Of course, all of them will turn him down!

But this is terrible! This is Luna, you know! Strolling around alone at night is suicidal!

Surely you're exaggerating.

On the contrary, he's quite right. You'll get kidnapped by Luigi Vampa, you silly!

Luigi... Vampa?

He's a new up-and-coming bandit!

They say he drags his victims into the catacombs, he tortures them, and kills them in a horrible fashion!

Really?

Surely the police won't stand by and do nothing.

You mean you don't know? The police on Luna arrange their patrols to avoid having to deal with the bandits.

Even my very own cousin was robbed by thugs, and had his arms and legs broken! The poor fellow was left lying stark naked in the plaza! All because he dared to speak to the bandit's mistress!

I'm sure he's fine. Don't worry yourself. I'll bet he's back at your hotel. Oh, would you care to dance?

You know what, Franz, I despise it when a party ends. First one guest leaves, then two, then three. Especially at this hour. You won't leave, will you? You won't abandon me like everyone else?


Take him away.


You can't! That's mean! C'mon! Today is my birthday!

I'm sorry, my son. It's time for me to go now.

No, no, no!

But your father is leaving to see some very important people on business.

Fine, see if I care! I hope you never come back!

Father...

I'm sorry. I kept you waiting.

I think... I should go.


Hey! Are you Baron Franz d'Epinay?

Wait, I know you...

I killed â€˜em all! As for me, I murdered ten people!

This is for you.

My Lord Baron Franz d'Epinay. I, Luigi Vampa, have decided to take custody of your young friend, the Viscount Albert Morcerf. Hand over the sum of 50 million ducats to my messenger immediately. Should you fail to comply by sunrise, you may consider your friend's life as forfeit.

Where is Albert?!

Don't worry. He's a valuable hostage, so I'm sure he's being treated with all due respect. If the money's handed over right away, he'll be returned to you without so much as a scratch.

You should have died! Is this how you people do things?

Well, sir, even I have a lifestyle to maintain.

50 million is absurd!

Hey, you're an aristocrat! I'm sure you won't have any trouble gettin' it. Dawn comes fast on Luna. If you value your friend's life, I suggest you make arrangements for the money as soon as you can.


I want to make an immediate withdrawal of funds from the Bank of Paris!

I'm sorry, sir, but our connection to Europe is currently offline due to the solar winds which are interfering with communications.

There's nothing you can do?!

How much?


Oh, Albert... Damn!


Say, it's awfully sad to see a young fella like yourself all alone on the last night of Carnival. If you want, I know a girl who'll make you feel fine.

Just be quiet and drive.


It was at my father's funeral that I first met Albert...

Don't cry.

I'm not crying...

Cheer up, I'll play with you!

Get lost! Leave me alone!

Hey...

Ever since that day, Albert and I have been... inseparable.


Damn! What'll I do...?


It's gettin' close to sunrise, you know! You're running out of time. Have you raised the money yet?

Not yet! I can't transfer the money from Paris until morning!

Gee, that's too bad. Luigi's such a stickler for punctuality. If you don't have the money ready by sunrise, I'm afraid your friend's life is as good as over.

Stop messing with me!

I suggest you hurry. I'm sure that you don't want to see your friend die a horrible death, My Lord Baron.

You bastard...!

Violence is so unseemly, right, My Lord Baron?

That's better. A gentleman really should worry about little things like discretion, you know.


There is no more fascinating spectacle in the universe than a man's death. Yes, it almost feels as if one has actually become God, does it not?

His Excellency, the Baron d'Epinay.

Hmm?

I'm sorry to disturb you, sir, at a late hour such as this...

Is anything the matter? You don't seem like you're feeling entirely well. May I get you something?

Excellency, I need a favor!



GANKUTSUOU - The Count of Monte Cristo - 02



What's the big i--?!

50 million ducats. You will take us to the hostage, immediately.

The Colosseum!


Have the two of you been friends for a long time?

Yes, we've been best friends since we were young.

Friends since childhood. I see. To always have a friend... It's a wonderful thing.


Who do you like, Franz? C'mon, tell me! You gotta at least give me a hint!

You wouldn't understand, Albert!


Luigi. It's almost time to do it.

Kill him.


So, have you made your peace?

C'mon, let me kill him, ma'am, please!

No, let me!

Give it a rest, you two! Wait till after he's dead, then you can carve him up! Now, then. Put up a brave front while you can. I wonder what you'll sound like when you cry?

Hey... Hey, guys! Hey, uh... There're visitors here to see the boss.

Oh, yeah? Who are they?


Teresa, please, don't! Just wait! We can't kill him yet! Because... because we won't get the money! Besides... there's still time before the deadline.

Stand aside!

Stop it! If you're going to use that, use it on me! Your stupid squabbling is really pathetic! Thanks for trying, but you should stand back.

Are you trying to disgrace the boss?

Don't worry, I'll be fine. Go.

Know what I think? You've fallen for her. That's so sweet... But believe me, she's way too much for you to handle, little boy. But perhaps... what you want is to become one of us? Hmm?

You know what? I think I'll brand you...

Hey! Leave her alone!


I have come to meet with Signor Luigi Vampa, whose reputation is notorious.

Who are you?

Just call me... Gankutsuou.

T-The King of the Cavern?!

For one such as yourself who dwells in the darkness, I expect that I am better known by that name. I have your money. Now, hand over the hostage.

I'm sorry, but you missed the deadline. "Always be punctual" is the motto I live by.

"Punctuality is the politeness of kings." Louis XVIII would be proud.

Your words honor me. Now, die!

Very good... Your skill is impressive. But I'm afraid you cannot kill me, no matter what your abilities.

A-Are you... really... No! Stay away from me...!

I do not work for the authorities. And now... If you would do me the honor of returning my friend to me, all will be well.


I take it you're not injured, sir?

No, I'm fine. I had a feeling that somehow you would come to rescue me.

If you wish to thank someone, then you should thank the good Baron d'Epinay. You see, he was seriously concerned for your well-being.

Hey! Miss! Are you all right?

I'm fine... Thank you. I never asked what your name is...

My name is Albert. I'm Albert de Morcerf.

Albert. I'm Peppo.


To tell you the truth, I was starting to consider the idea of throwing my lot in with the bandits and living the life of an outlaw.

You all right, Albert?

What took you so long? Huh? You know, Franz, I came this close to being killed by those thugs!

I thought... you were dead!

Why did you...?


Do not concern yourselves unduly over the matter. It served as a pleasant diversion for me.

But, sir! I must do something to repay you.

All right. Might I ask if you grant me one small favor?

Anything at all! Whatever you want! Just name it!

At some point very soon, I should like to take up residence in Paris.

Really? That's wonderful!

However, a rustic aristocrat such as myself has no connections in Paris. As such, might I impose on you to act as my intermediary into Parisian society?

Yes! Of course!

Good. I shall be calling on you in Paris on May 22nd, then. Three months from this day. When I do, we'll commemorate the events of your visit here. Hmm? Where in the world did you find this?

Down at the opera house. So, it's yours?

Indeed it is. It shames me to have to say it, but I've been searching for it. See? This shows our bond. Viscount, please, accept the watch with my gratitude. Think of it as a small token of our friendship.

Really, you mean it?

It's a way to keep this day -- this very hour stuck fast in time.

Wow! Thank you so much! I'll cherish it always!

Sadly, Carnival has ended, so what are your plans now, Albert? What adventures have you in store for your future?

Albert and I are going to cut our trip short and take the evening shuttle back to Paris.

Hey, Hey! Wait a minute! I can't go! I've already made plans of my own!

You just never learn, do you? So then, what are these "plans"?

What do you mean? That's none of your business.

Ah... Perhaps... you've a rendezvous?

Sort of...

Love is a wonderful thing. However, perhaps you have not yet noticed. Or perhaps you knew, and arranged the rendezvous regardless. I do hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, but...

What...? She's a boy...? She's a boy?!


Come out and say it! You think I'm an idiot, don't you?!

Not really.

Yeah, right! You're always looking down on me, always laughing at me!

I'm not laughing at you! If I laughed at every boneheaded stunt you pulled, I'd laugh myself to death! Anyway, you were...

...Thank you, Franz. I owe you my life. I really appreciate it.


The bitter fruits of betrayal must be plucked from the tree...
