 ws:end:WikiTextMediaRule:0 Tenma, narrating:
Sit tight! That dizzy romantic comedy School Rumble is about to start!

[opening song]

Tenma:
(through voiceover) “I love you.” Just three little words. But the moment I say them, the whole world changes like magic.
Today I’m going to say them to you.

Yakumo:
Hey uh, sis. We’re late.

Tenma:
Yakumo! I’m sorry! Alright, school starts today. I can’t wait! Thanks for waiting for me.

Yakumo:
Being late’s no way to start.

Tenma:
I know. (through voiceover) My name is Tenma Tsukamoto.
I guess I’m just your average high school sophomore, like a zillion other girls in the world.
And like any young girls, I’ve fallen in love.
(aloud) Maybe the food will be better this year.

Nara:
Hey, Karasuma!

Tenma:
It’s him, Karasuma!
Oh my gosh! I can’t believe I just said his name out loud!

Yakumo:
Just think, wouldn’t it be cool if you guys ended up in the same class?

Tenma:
Uh-huh! We are gonna end up in the same class together. I prayed for it every night for six months.
My horoscope said I was lucky in love! My tea leaves foretold success!
I found a four-leaf clover! I tripped and fell down the stairs!

Yakumo:
What was that last one?

Tenma:
I’m gonna go check the class assignments.

Yakumo:
Okay, I'll cross my fingers for you.

Nara:
Did you see the ball game last night?

Harima:
(through voiceover) “I love you.” Just three little words. But the moment I say them, the whole world changes like magic.
Today I’m gonna say them to you.

Tennoji:
I’ll get you for this, Harima! (POW!) PLHH!!!

Harima:
Yeah. Time for the bad-ass to get the girl. Let’s go to school!
(through voiceover) My name is Kenji Harima. And everyone knows I’m the baddest bad-ass in school.
At least I was, until someone came along and changed my life.

Tenma:
I’m too nervous to look, but please let Karasuma be in my class.

Mikoto:
Tenma, hey!

Tenma:
Hey girls, what’s going on?

Harima:
It’s her! Holy crap!

Teacher:
Now hold on, young man. Button up your- [BAM!!]

Harima:
I gotta be in her class!!! Huh?

Eri:
Did you hear the good news?

Mikoto:
We’re all in class 2-C.

Akira:
Including you.

Tenma:
Really? Hooray! My three best friends! All together! It’s wonderful!
I knew today was gonna be my lucky day. But…

Akira:
Is there something wrong?

Tenma:
Oh, definitely not! No problem here!

Harima:
So Tenma is in 2-C huh?
I know. I’ll use psychic power to make sure I’m in 2-C. Just gotta concentrate for 10 seconds.
Ten 2-C. Nine 2-C. Eight 2-C. Seven 2-C. Six 2-C. Five 2-C. Four 2-C. Three 2-C. Two 2-C. One…

Yoshidayama:
D. Just face it, Harima. I saw you on the D-list.
[BAM!]
What was that for?

Harima:
That was just a “love tap.” That’s what happens when people distract me.
2-D. It can’t be. My psychic power had to work.
"Kenji Harimashi"?! (POW!) That’s not my name!!!
You upset my vibration for nothing!!!! You vibe-killer!

Yoshidayama:
Sorry! I didn’t know you were vibrating!

Harima:
Try to be a little bit more sensitive from now on. You know, like me.

Yoshidayama:
Okay.

Harima:
Hmph. What’s he know? My name’s gotta be there.
Damn it. I can’t find my name anywhere.
C’mon. I gotta be in one of these rooms.

What the… Man, it’s like I don’t even exist.

Teacher:
Harima. Why are you checking the level-two list?
You were held back, don’t you remember?

Harima:
Oh crap.

Yakumo:
How did it go? Is he in your class?

Tenma:
Can’t… look…

Yakumo:
Would it be easier if I looked for you?

Tenma:
No! I’ve gotta see this with my very own eyes!
Oji Karasuma.
We’re in the same class! Yes!

Yakumo:
Good for you.

Tenma:
Soon we’ll be together, Karasuma. And our love will be…

Nara:
So you’re in 2-C.

Tenma:
(I can’t hardly wait.)

Karasuma:
Uh-huh. But it doesn’t matter cause I’m transferring out in two days.

Tenma:
Baaah!

Waaahhh! But we were gonna be in the same class!

Yakumo:
Oh well, life goes on.

Tenma:
The hell it does! I’ve gotta think. Maybe cleaning the house will help me think.
Maybe doing all the laundry will help me think. Maybe dishes will help me think?
I couldn’t think of anything. Maybe a good night's sleep will help.

There’s no way I can sleep now!
I can’t let him go without at least trying to tell him how I feel!
Better to risk doing something dumb than do nothing and kick myself for the rest of my life!
Okay, let’s do this.

I’ll just write “I love you.” I mean that should be easy.
Okay. I love y- y- y- your skiing! I hear you’re awesome at the giant slalom!
Aah!!! What’s the matter with me?! What am I saying?! Argghhhh!!!
Once more. I love y- y- y- your skipping! Gargghh!
Okay, Tenma. Stay cool. You can do this. I love… yogurt! No, no! I love… YOGA!
I love "yurts"! I love "yorkies"? I love…

Rats. I can’t say it. Now what am I supposed to do?
Okay, shake it off. I’ll just write down how I feel, nice and simple.

It turned out to be kind of a long letter.
I did it. I poured out my heart to him.

He- he’s reading it!

And... he’s still reading it.
I think he's finally finished.

Karasuma:
Wait a minute.

Tenma:
Baah!!!

Oh my gosh! He’s reacting! I hope this is a good thing?!

Karasuma:
That’s funny. There’s no name.

Tenma:
OH NOOOO!!!!!! It’s all over!!!! My first love.

It’s- it’s Karasuma! But I thought he transferred to another school!

Akira:
No. For some reason, he decided to postpone the transfer.

Eri:
He managed to talk his parents into letting him finish up the school year here.

Tenma:
Why would he? How come?

Mikoto:
No one knows for sure, but the rumor is someone asked him to.



Tenma:
Our heroine, Tenma Tsukamoto is hopelessly in love with Oji Karasuma!
But her hopes are dashed when she learns he’s about to transfer to another school.
Desperate to make her feelings known, she pours out her heart to him in a very long love letter, to no avail!
But in a dramatic turn of events, Karasuma postpones his transfer, restoring hope to Tenma’s storm-tossed soul! But now she begins the real battle – a battle for true love in a cruel world!

....Great first page! I hope the whole book is this good! Hahaha!

Okay, no more stupid mistakes. I’m gonna find out what the experts say you should do.

Karasuma. You’re so cool.
Argh! Stupid, stupid, stupid! You love the guy and you're not focused!
But reading makes my head hurt. Oh, wait!
“Know yourself as well as your enemy and a hundred victories will be yours!”
Who wrote this? Sun-tzu, huh? I guess it must be some kind of a secret kung-fu love manual.

Know yourself. What kind of a girl am I?
Tenma Tsukamoto. Age: 16. Height: 154 cm. Weight: 43 kg. Looks and figure: Average.
Social status: Nobody. Sports: Poor! Academics: Poor! Cooking: Sucks! Good quality: Zilch!
Get a grip! Let’s see what else he’s got.
"Rabbit taking off". Taking off what?

Rabbit:
Can you [outdo me in the back]?

Tenma:
Aah! Put it back on!
That can’t be the right reading.

Excuse me. What does this expression mean?

Karasuma:
Oh that. That means “rabbit running away.”

Tenma:
Oh, of course. Thanks so much for your help.

Karasuma:
Sure.

Tenma:
He’s... right... here. How'd he get there?!!!!

Karasuma:
That’s right. Rabbit running away.

Tenma:
Great! Now he thinks I’m an illiterate lunatic! But, on the other hand, he actually talked to me for the very first time. Now I know what to have him read next! Man, am I an evil genius or what? Haha!

Ow, my contact. Uh, could you read this phrase for me?

Boy:
Sure thing! Let me see. It says “I love you!”
Hey, are you at high school? You’re really cute!

Tenma:
Or maybe if I show him a cane field he’ll call me sugar!

Karasuma. What do you get from this?

Karasuma:
Let’s see.

Tenma:
Come on. Come on!

Karasuma:
Says it’s a thresher.

Tenma:
Aah! I showed him the wrong picture!

Karasuma:
Well, I guess it’s about time I get going. See you. Miss Tsukamoto.

Tenma:
Yea, sure. Later, Karasuma.

He knows my name!



Harima:
It wasn’t that long ago I was a total smart-ass and a hopeless moron.
And I was a God. Nothing and nobody could tie me down. I belonged to no one.
But now I’m tied by the bonds of love. I’m in love with Tenma Tsukamoto.

Fuyuki:
Hey, what the heck is Harima doing here?

Nara:
Oh man, he’s sitting in my chair.

Fuyuki:
Do you think he broke into the faculty room and forced them to pass him?

Harima:
(Through flashback) Oh please, oh please, oh please
oh please, oh please!...

So far, so good.
I made it into Tenma’s class. Now I gotta figure out a way to tell her how I feel about her.

What?! "I challenge you to a fight!"? Come on! Nobody does this by letter anymore!
Wait! A letter! I bet chicks like letters. Ha-HA!

Read this. The greatest love letter in the history of the world.
I asked her to meet me behind the gym at 4 o’clock. Oh Tenma, did you read my letter?

Tenma:
(in Harima's head) I love you, darling. You’re the only man in the world for me.

Harima:
Almost four o’clock.

It’s her. She came... Argh!!! What the hell?!
Aw, crap! I forgot the challenge, set for the same time and place!
What are the chances? I can’t believe this! I can’t go out there now, and let Tenma see me fighting that gorilla!!!!

Tennouji:
Come on. Where is that creep? I’m gonna miss my 4:30. Hm?
I beg your pardon, miss.

Tenma:
Huh?

Tennouji:
Sorry but what are a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?

Tenma:
Uh… meeting someone.

Harima:
That slimeball! He’s talking to her! I’ll kill him!

Tennoji:
Oh, a letter.

Tenma:
Well yes its…

Tennoji:
Do you mind if I…

Tenma:
Hey, gimme that!

Harima:
Bastard!

Tennouji:
[???] It’s a love poem. Isn't that [???]

Harima:
Huh?! Wait a minute!!!

Tennouji:
Oh, thank you. An epic poem of gratitude. Oh, how sweet.
"Oh, thank you, to the heavens, for sending you to earth.
Oh, thank you, to your parents, 'twas they who gave you birth!"
Hahahahaha!
[???]

Harima:
I swear, Tennouji, I’ll end you for this!!!

Tenma:
I think you’re wrong.

Harima:
Huh?

Tenma:
I know I’m not very smart, but I think whoever wrote this was very brave to say what he felt in his heart. It’s a beautiful, sensitive, wonderful letter. And I just adore it!

Harima:
I’m the luckiest guy in the world to fall in love with a girl like Tenma.

Tennouji:
That’s great, ‘cause I wrote the letter. I love you.

Harima:
WHAT?!!!! And he called me pathetic?!

Tenma:
Thank you. That’s very sweet.
But I’m in love with somebody else.

Harima:
There, there. These things happen to everyone.... EXCEPT ME!!!
That’s for laughing at my masterpiece! If there’s one thing I hate, it’s criticism!



Tenma:
I've gotta think of some way I can spend more time Karasuma.
There must be something I can do to get his attention outside of school. I just gotta concentrate.
Oh, pretty.

Harima:
If I can just find a way to spend more time with her, she would notice me.
I've gotta find more time.

Tenma:
Of course!

Tenma and Harima:
Riding a bicycle!!!!

(in Tenma's head)
Tenma:
Why, good morning, Karasuma!

Karasuma:
Good morning, Miss Tsukamoto. Another splendid day, isn’t it?

Tenma:
Indeed!

Tenma (thinking):
We could bike to school together every day!

(in Harima's head)
Harima:
Ah, Tenma!

Tenma:
Good morning, Harima! Lovely weather we’re having, isn’t it?

Harima:
Almost as lovely as you.

Harima (thinking):
We could bike to school together every day!

Tenma and Harima:
SHEER GENIUS!!!!

Mikoto:
Tenma sure has been acting weird lately.
I wonder what’s up.

Akira:
It’s because they wound up in class together.

Mikoto:
Huh?

Akira:
Don’t worry about it. You’ll figure it out.

Yakumo:
Morning, girls.

Mikoto:
Hey, morning, Yakamo.

Akira:
So, where’s Tenma?

Yakumo:
She’s uh… she’s biking to school from now on.

Akira:
Here we go.

Mikoto:
Uh… with what?

Tenma:
Haha! This is gonna be great! So where is he?
Yes! Now for a casual and yet friendly greeting. Good morning! What a co-
Whoa! Has he got a freaking jet engine on that thing or what?
Hey, Karasuma! Wait up!

Harima:
Soon I’ll be riding with Tenma. Hahaha.
Whoa, here she comes. Tenma, what a coincidence! Hey lovely weather we’re having, isn’t it?
Huh, wait up! What’s the deal? Is she training for the Tour de France? She’s going way too fast!
Hey, come back! Tenma!!!

Tenma:
Hey, slow down, will ya?

Harima:
Wait for me, Tenma!!!

Tenma:
Look at him! Even on a bike, he’s so cool and composed! He’s just adorable.
Huh? How does he do that?! Well, he’s not gonna get rid of me that easily! CHARGE!!!

Harima:
Whoa! She’s fast! But if I can outrun the cops, I can catch up to her.
They don’t call me Legs of Steel for nothing! Let’s kick it into overdrive! HRRGGGAHHH!!!

Tenma:
Wait up, Karasuma!

Harima:
Tenma, wait up!

Eri:
There’s nothing like having a good hair day to make a girl feel beautiful.

Karasuma:
Good morning.

Eri:
Morning. Hah! Amazing! He went up that hill like it wasn’t even there.

Tenma?!

My- my hair... It’s ruined. Grr! What is going on?

Mikoto:
Whoa, Eri. Bad hair day?

Eri:
Oh yea, you could say that. You’ll never guess what happened.

Akira:
Karasuma came by on a bike and Tenma was following right after him?

Eri:
What does that mean?

Akira:
Geez, what do you think?

Eri:
Ah, now I get it.

Mikoto:
Huh? Get what? Get what?

Eri:
But wait, I’m pretty sure I saw a third person chasing after them.

Mikoto:
Hey, you don’t think Tenma has a thing for Karasuma, do you?

When you’re as dumb as they are, the last thing you need is to fall asleep during class.

Karasuma:
Miss Tsukamoto? Here’s your eraser.

Tenma (mumbling in her sleep):
Thank you.

Eri:
Gosh. That’s too bad. She just missed out on a really good chance there.

Akira:
This doesn’t bode well for the rest of the school year, huh?

Tenma: (mumbling in her sleep):
I love you, Karasuma…

[ending song]

Tenma (narrating):
Oh man, tomorrow’s our school physical! I don’t wanna get weighed!
But I do wanna know Karasuma’s stats! I just have to find out!
Next time on School Rumble, “Tough Test! Trapped in the Bathroom! The School Physical!”
Uh… do I look fat to you?
