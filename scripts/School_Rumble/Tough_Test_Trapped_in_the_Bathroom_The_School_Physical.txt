  Sit tight. That dizzy romantic comedy School Rumble is about to start.

So, Harima. Now we’ll settle this once and for all.
Let’s get him!

Even in the worst situations, when a man’s in love, he can’t afford to lose his pride.

Tch. You bastard. Arggg.

Bring it on, losers. You can’t beat me because I’m in love. And it’s all for you, Tenma.

Harima comes to school every day now, doesn’t he?
Maybe he’s planning some sort of bomb threat.

Tenma. You took off without your lunch.

Oh, silly me. Thanks, sis.

Listen, are you okay sitting there? Is it safe?

Say what?

He’s got kind of a weird vibe.

Oh, Harima. Look. Your desk. It’s crushing your bag. You poor helpless little bag.

Everything I do is for you. I never gave a damn about school. I came and went as I pleased.
But you turned it into a paradise I can’t live without. Hmhm. Pretty hysterical.
The toughest punk in town and I show up on time every day, stay all day and then stick around for clean-up. Hahahaha. What a joke… on me. You get it? Hahaha…

Okay. That’s just weird.

Yup. No doubt about it. He’s planning something evil.

[opening song]

Right. Time to check out the old language skills with a pop quiz.
Just fill in the blanks, people.

Okay, and start!

Too many letters… Brain hurting… School is hard.
Oh well, it’s worth it to be near Tenma. I should just enjoy this moment of bliss.
Ah! But wait, her name! She forgot to write in her name.
Is she crazy? If she forgets to write her name in, she’ll get an automatic zero.
If she gets an automatic zero, she’ll fail. Oh my god. She’s gonna fail! Tenma’s gonna fail! Ten-
Ah, I can’t warn her out loud. We’re in the middle of the test.
What should I do? Think, Harima. Think!
Time to be a hero and save the girl. I’ve got it! I’ll try mouthing the words.
Oh crap. That didn’t work. This is tougher than I thought. Okay then.
Damn it. So far I’m dead in the water. Come on, Harima. You’ve gotta come up with a better idea.
There’s gotta be another way to warn her. Heroes always have a plan B. Oh well.
I hate to be so obvious, but I guess I’ll have to take the direct route.

Arghhhh. Holy crap. I completely forgot to write my name.
Even if I'd managed to get every answer correct, I would’ve failed.

Better be more careful, Harima.

Everyone’s laughing at me. Still, anything for Tenma. She’s laughing at me too?!?
But I was talking about her. Hasn’t she ever heard of learning from other people’s mistakes?
And why does she have to be so cute?

Oh dear!

Screw you!

Sorry.

I can’t give up yet. There. It’s perfect. Yeahaha.
Wow, I got the answer to number 7, the last question. Man, this test is so easy I can’t believe it.
Here we go.

Hm?

Did she get it?

Oh no, no. How does this happen?
This girl is just too stupid and I know stupid. Damn it.
What haven’t I tried?

Amazing. Harima really seems to be concentrating on this test.

It’s like he’s actually trying or something.

Hold on. What if I wrote Tenma’s name on my paper so that her no-name paper would be mistaken for mine? Yes.

What’s this? Sir, this paper has my name on it but this isn’t my handwriting.

What? Strange. Harima turned in a paper with no name.

Did Harima do this to protect me? What a sweetie.

It was you, wasn’t it?

I just can’t turn my back on someone who needs help.

Oh, Harima. I love you.

Ditto.

(Anybody knows what’s going on? What’s up with him?))
It’ll work. Tenma. I’m doing this for the sake of our future happiness.

Here your test papers from yesterday.
Tenma, I’m afraid you got a zero.

What the…

Ugh. I’m sorry, Tenma! I’m so sorry. Please forgive me. I’m just so stupid.

What do you think? Shall we hit the coffee shop or the mall?

I don’t care.

I can’t. There’s a sale at the supermarket today and I have to go.
I’ve gotta do the dinner shopping. Let’s see. What sounds good tonight?

Whoa. Are you trying to tell me that you do the cooking at your house? C’mon.

Huh? Yea, well. That is, I…

I thought Yakamo did all the cooking.

You’re right. She does.

I knew it.

I always thought Tenma looked like the spoiled one.

What, really? Agh!
Karasuma. Wait. Why did I hide from him just now?
I guess I was embarrassed to let the boy I love see me coming out of the girl’s bathroom.
Oh great. Now that I thought of it, I can’t go out. I’m such a moron.
It’s just the girl’s bathroom but I pee in here. What'll I do?

Okay I really need to get out now.

Still there. Come on. Why is he being such an idiot?
Why would anyone stand around talking for so long in front of the girl’s bathroom.
But that’s why I love the guy. Argh, no. This is no time to be blinded by love.

Still at it. Okay, now it’s a matter of endurance.
I’ll show him what a woman’s willpower can do. Love isn’t for wimps.
I’m being tested. No problem. I can handle it. Besides, he can’t talk longer than ten minutes. Haha.

It oughta be safe by now.
Oh man, does it ever get to see daylight again.
I-I don’t believe it. He’s reading a novel?

Plan number two.

Uh… Where the heck did she go?
Hey, Tenma. You’re still in here?

Okay, it doesn’t matter just as long as he doesn’t recognize me.

What are you doing now?

Uh?

Hah. You’re just in time. Quick. Who am I?

Eh. Yea. Tenma. I’ll be going home now.

Huh? Hang on. How did you know it was me?

Wow, little too much for me.

Plan number three. I’ll use this to distract Karasuma and then make my escape.

One, two, GO!

Okay, who’s the wise guy, huh? You got a lot of nerve sneaking up on me.
Who did it? Was it you? Was it? Spit it out. [??? If I have to I can…]

Sorry about that, Harima. I’ll apologize to him later.

There’s nothing left I can use. And I’m all out of plans.
I’m gonna spend the rest of my life in the girl’s bathroom.
Huh? It’s stuck.
Wait a sec.

Ready on the left. Ready on the right. All systems go! 30 meters! Slow descend, begin!
I’m not giving up. There’s no way I’m gonna let Karasuma see me leaving the girl’s bathroom.
It’s a matter of pride. I finally made it at last.

You’re okay?

Yea, I’m fine.

Well, just be careful. You’re lucky you didn’t get hurt.

Come on, sis. I told you before. I’m not mad at you for missing the sale at the supermarket today, okay.

No, no. That’s not the problem.

Oh, please. I beg you. I hope you’ll be kind. I haven’t done this for a long time.

Sis? Is there somebody in there with you?

No, no, no. It’s nothing, I mean nobody. I was just talking to…

To what? You mean you were talking to the scale?
Oh right. The school physicals tomorrow.

How can you be so calm? You lucky you’re so skinny.
Life is hard for us, full-figured girls. Hmph.
Now get out. I wanna be alone.

You fiend! Do your worst. You shall never beat me!

I don’t wanna be unsympathetic but I don’t think you can blame the scale.

Okay, girl. Do it.
I hope we can be friends.
Hahhhh!

It’s a nightmare. I gotta wake up. That’s all.

Get off the floor before you catch a cold.

(I skipped breakfast today.
I haven’t eaten for three days.
[I can catch up with [bra/dress] size].
You’re gonna collapse.
After the weighing I’ll stuff myself.
All that, I mean, [one] bra size. It just isn’t fair.)

Okay, let me guess. The look on your face says you gained weight. Am I right?
Score one.

I’d just ignore her. You weigh about the same as me, don’t you?
So don’t even worry about it.

Thank you.

On the other hand, she’s got a much bigger bust than you do.

Let’s see. A… no, no. B, definitely. And this one, A I think.

Imadori.
Hey. Are you trying to guess blood types?

Bra sizes, my friend. Yea I can tell at a glance. It’s a gift.
I don’t even need to measure, though I could if I wanted to.

Smile for me. That’s it, baby. Give me more of that.
Ah, that’s a ticket. Work it, girl. Work it. The camera loves you.

Okay. I know I probably shouldn’t ask this, but what are you doing?

I’m taking early graduation pictures, of course. What does it look like?

Then I guess you don’t think that’s asking for trouble.

Fuyuki, I would like to order a complete set, please.

Are you guys nuts? You’re just begging for it.

Hey. Gimme that.

Give it back to me. That’s my dad’s camera.
Sorry, but as class representative, it’s my duty to confiscate [cameras being used for moral offenses].

You cannot deny the awesome power of the chocolate brownie.

I’m not arguing. I’m just saying I like the truffles better.

Word, yo. (True, yes.)

Which makes it 2-1. I win.

Karasuma’s gonna have his height and weight measured today too. I wonder…
He must be about 171, no, 172 cm. Weight. He looks light. Limber, too.
I’m no good at guessing a boy’s weight. Oh no, now I've done it. I can't stand it.
It’s gonna drive me crazy. I gotta know, I gotta know everything about him.
I gotta know his height, weight, shoe size, collar, sleeve length, waist, hip, inseam, glove size, hat size, chest…
His chest… is probably bigger than mine.

Hey, is it just me or has anyone else noticed that the boys are a little more out of control than usual.

Oh, they’re just getting all hot and bothered, thinking about today’s physical exam.

Ahh. I’m sorry. Please forgive me.

Sure thing. What are we forgiving you for?

You know, Tenma. No one else has a knack for killing a conversation quite like you did.

C’mon, Eri. You’ve gotta be used to it by now. Enjoy the drama.

Yeah. So, back to the boys. Isn’t it pathetic the way they’re wrapped up in their lewd little fantasies?
I mean if they’re that desperate to satisfy their curiosity, then they should just become doctors.

Wow, so much for being PC. [PC:politically correct]

That’s right. Boys can be doctors or nurses.

Oh come on, you two. That was just a “for instance.” I wasn’t making a political statement.

Become a doctor or a nurse.
YES! I’ll become a nurse.

Huh?

Maybe I’m overreacting, but doesn’t that strike you as an abrupt career dicision?

Yeah, well . Consider the source.

Oh gosh, I think she’s really serious this time.

No, no. I’m not talking about my future job.

You’re sure about that?

I’ll see you all later, girls. So long.

Oh man, I thought she was serious.

Don’t relax. I sense a zany plan coming on.

There’s just no telling with her.

There. Talk about the perfect disguise.

That idiot. Her hair is a dead giveaway.

[At least] she didn’t put on a nose and glasses.

I don’t get it. What can she possibly be after?

This is kind of fun. I don’t think I’ve had to wear a name tag since grade school.

You have to give her credit. She can have fun doing anything.

I'll bet you 10-1 she’s filling out that card with her own name.

Gosh. What do you think we should do?

Nothing, of course.
C’mon. Don’t you wanna watch and see what happens next?

I argee. It’s probably better if we don’t interfere at this point.

So far, so good. Soon Oji Karasuma’s vital statistics will be all mine.

Sorry if I kept you waiting. I’m looking forward to working with you, Doctor.

No problem. I was running late myself. I’m subbing for the regular doctor.
Let me introduce myself. I’m young doctor Harima. Nice to meet you.

Attention please, students.
The physical examinations scheduled for today have been canceled.
Once again, the physical examinations scheduled for today have been canceled.
They will be rescheduled at a later time.

[ending song]

Ah, it’s so hard to say “I love you.” It’s easier to bend spoons with your mind.
I know. I’ll have a sleepover and invite my friends to share stories about their love troubles.
Next time on School Rumble, See and Sketch. Letter on an arrow. Pijama party confessions.
Mikoto. Your breasts are just so big.
