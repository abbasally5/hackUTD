  China:
Ni hao. I'm China! Today, I would like to recount for you a lovely, old story.

---

China:
Every single day, another power struggle. It's exhausting.
Who is that? I've never seen him around here before.
You must be a new country. You're so little. I'm sure it was rough on you to have been born in such a small place. You can call me China. If there's something you don't know, all you have to do is ask me. So, would you mind telling me your name?

Young Japan:
Konnichiwa. It's nice to meet you, China, where the sun sets. My name is Japan. I am from where the sun rises.

China:
Ugh! Well, THAT wasn't very nice!

China:
He can draw, but I've never seen him write any characters. What if he never learned how to do any of them?
Japan, you can use these. They're Chinese characters and are pretty simple. Practice with them and you'll be able to draw letters very soon.
Oh! It looks like you're already using them. Good for you!
HOW DARE YOU MAKE THEM UP ON YOUR OWN!

Japan:
Hetalia.

China:
Thereafter, Japan grew up without any problems.
Ooh, wow. This is amazing.

Japan:
A doll?

China:
I'm happy you're growing up so fast, Japan. I hope you know how proud I am of you.
Oh...panda! It's so good to see you! I'd like you to meet my friend Japan.

Japan:
Hello.

Panda:
You guys related?

China:
You bet! This guy happens to be my kid brother!



Japan:
Mm, right.

China:
WHAT THE HELL TOOK YOU SO LONG!?

China:
Oh, wow. What a beautiful moon.

Japan:
Very beautiful.

China:
Okay, so...what kind of big plans do you have next?

Japan:
Uh...what am I planning next? To become stronger. Soon, the western powers will reach Asia. When that occurs, I plan to fight them at any cost...but if I am going to defeat them, I will need to be more powerful than I am now.

China:
Good grief! Boy, do you complicate everything! You should animate that sad story!
Whoa...! Look, Japan! Rabbits are trying to make medicine on the moon!

Japan:
No, they are pounding steamed rice into mochi.

When I started cleaning my storage room on a whim, it brought back that memory.

Announcer:
Hetalia: America's Storage Room Cleaning.

All the good things and bad things...are in this place (storage room).

America:
Hey, Britain! All I want is my freedom!

On that day, surely, we took each other's hands.

Announcer:
Hetalia: America's Storage Room Cleaning.

Britain:
I won't allow it!

Finally next week...the decision has been made! It will be shown on this show!

We sincerely hope you all will join us for the show.
