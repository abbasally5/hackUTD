  Germany:
Listen up! First, you must grip the grenade firmly, then pull the pin out of it and throw it with an overhand motion.
Throw it far enough to stay safe, but close enough to watch the other guy explode. Does that make sense to you?

Italy:
Si, I got it! Just you watch, I'll own this bomb thing!

Germany:
Careful, it's active now!
Schei√üe...AAAAAAAHHH! What are you doing, you carb-loading idiot!? Throw it already or you're going to blow yourself into oblivion! HOLY MARY MUTTER GOTTES!

Britain:
We finally invented a machine that will make perfectly boiled eggs. As you can see, it's a state-of-the-art machine that we, the British empire, marshalled our intelligence to create. We spent several years on the concept...and now, after all those years of testing, we have the unique capability to make delicious boiled eggs by using technologies no other country can replicate.
Hetalia!
Look, a machine that will give you beer from a tap. We--ugh!

France:
A ho ho ho ho!

Britain:
You bastard! Only the French would have a person with a beer!

France:
What is that supposed to mean!?

Britain:
It means you're always--

China:
Another peaceful day for the allies.

France:
Hetalia.

America:
I started cleaning up my storage room on a whim. Turns out it brought back more than a few memories that I had tried to forget a long time ago. Some were good...and some were not.

Hetalia: America's Storage Room Cleaning

America:
Hm...that one time...it has to be....

1775 - 1783: American Revolutionary War

America:
Hey, Britain! All I want is my freedom! I'm no longer a child nor your little brother. From now on, consider me independent!

Britain:
Haagh!
I won't allow it...you idiot! Why can't you follow anything through to the end!?

American General:
Ready! Aim!

Britain:
There's no way I can shoot you. I can't.
Why? Dammit, why? It's not fair...!

America:
You know why.

Past Britain:
Let's go home.

Young America:
He he!

America:
What happened? I remember when you were great.

Lithuania:
Ah! There you are, Mr. America!

America:
Hey. I just had to get away from all that dust for a minute. I didn't really make much progress, but I still think I'm done for the day.

Lithuania:
Right. That must be exhausting. Oh...would you like to have you coffee here, then?

America:
Sure, that sounds perfect.
It's weird, I'm having quite a difficult time throwing away some of those things. You know, I think I might be turning into a sentimental old man.

Lithuania:
No. You're just turning into an adult.

Lithuania:
What is this? A hand-made soldier? What a cute toy!

America:
AAH! Britain's here! Put that thing away before it's too late!
