  France:
What's that? I was not invited to the after-meeting party?

---

Frenchman:
Oui, I heard they had a pretty good time. Rumor has it none of them wanted you there.

France:
They had a pretty good time without me! How unfair! Although I can understand why. Still, though, how could they leave this gorgeousness out of the allies? Dammit, they think they're so much better than me...don't they know who I am? I am the world renounced France! All I have to do is put my mind into it and I can be very strong!

1337 - 1453: The Hundred Years' War

France:
Remember...this was when I was strong!

1412 - 1431: Joan of Arc

Britain:
Look! France totally has to have a girl help him! What a loser!

Joan:
What does he mean by 'loser'?

France:
Nothing, nothing at all! The tea lover over there took the top half of my body because probably God was busy with something else! You see? I even have God on my side most of the time!

1803 - 1815: The Napoleonic Wars

General:
There is nothing impossible! Now charge!

Britain:
Bravo! Those idiots fell right into my trap!

General:
I've had enough. Please kill me.

France:
This is terrible! I knew about the damn traps the entire time! I am sure that God was just gassy...or something, but that is not the point! I'm amazingly strong and don't you forget it!

1588: England defeated Spain's Invincible Armada

Britain:
Hahaha! So, Spain, now you know what happens if you mess with my pirates! We will annihilate you!

France:
Yaaaaaaaaaaay! Smack! Smack! Smack! Smack! Smack!

1740 - 1748: War of the Austrian Succession

Prussia:
Hey, Austria! It must suck balls to have Silesia taken away by force, huh?

France:
Wooooooooooow! Smack! Smack! Smack! Smack! Smack!

Austria:
You are an ass!

France:
You see? I really am the strongest after all!

France...their killer technique is...profiting from the sidelines.

Germany:
Oh, so sorry to bother you, but would you put your hands up?

Children:
Chibitalia!

Holy Rome:
What a filthy rat doing in here?

Chibi Italy:
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

Holy Rome:
I guess I'll have to get rid of it if I want to keep the peace in this house!
Hey, rat, stop right there! How dare you run away from me? Stop it!
Yes...I got you now! Ha!

Chibi Italy:
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

Holy Rome:
Why do I always manage to mess things up?

Austria:
Don't ask me.

Narrator:
At Holy Roman Empire's house, there was also a girl named Miss Hungary. She was in a similar situation to Italy. Despite her pitiful circumstance, she managed to be a very cheerful, nice, young lady. One day, Miss Hungary decided to put her clothes on Italy.

Hungary:
You look so adorable!

Chibi Italy:
Something doesn't seem right about it, but whatever.
Hey, Holy Rome! Look at me! I'm wearing Miss Hungary's clothes today!

Holy Rome:
Wait...but why? I'm confused....

Chibi Italy:
What's wrong? You're freaking me out!

Nobleman:
Things are turbulent!

Countryman:
I'm lashing out at you!

Narrator:
The atmosphere in Holy Rome's house is more than a little turbulent these days. People both inside and outside the house are lashing out at poor Mr. Austria.

Hungary:
What is their problem? They all act like they own the place lately. I think they really just want to find a reason to attack Mr. Austria. It would be awful if relatives started killing each other....

Chibi Italy:
Nooooo!

Narrator:
Unfortunately for Holy Rome, all that turbulent atmosphere and negative energy ended up swallowing his house and its surroundings.

France:
So Britain...I have something important to say to you. I would like...for you to marry me.
