  Japan:
Hello, I am Japan. Although I formed an alliance with these two, I am finding it difficult to understand their western ideas and cultural idiosyncrosies.
How strange and new. Never before have I witnessed a meal as interesting as one you're eating now. It look like you are consuming snail.

Germany:
It's a French delicacy called Escargot.

Italy:
I learned about it from my big brother France. Would you like some?

Japan:
I'm sorry, but I'm still full from eating raw fish.
Western culture will certainly take some getting used to.

Japan:
I can't believe this! Put some clothes on at once! Basking in public dishonors the codes of your ancestor!

Italy:
Aww, but I'm hot and I'm Italian and all the chicks dig it! Why don't you get naked?

Japan:
I couldn't possibly show a strange man my loincloths! I am begging you to put some clothes on; I could see through your --- need to sleep in bed completely nude already! I give up...Mr. Germany, you have to say something to him, please!

Germany:
Hmm? Hey, Japan. Can I wash your back?

Japan:
No...it's clean....
Nakedness in western culture will also take some getting used to.

Italy:
Hetalia!

Germany:
Count off!

Italy:
Uno!

Japan:
Ni!

Germany:
It's time to start our training! You'll start with the things every soldier should know!

Italy:
Yes, sir!

Japan:
Huh? Uh, what was that?

Germany:
And when your commander approaches!?

Italy:
I'll salute him! Then ignore him, sing, eat, and go to bed like an Italian!

Germany:
I only want you to salute!

Japan:
Nani? Your strange western ways are confusing.

Germany:
Right...well, don't do what Italy does, ja?

Italy:
You'll be okay! How about a nice massage?

Japan:
Please, stop touching me.
Hetalia.

Germany:
Listen up! We'll try this one more time!

Japan:
Uh...yes, sir....

Italy:
No, sir!

Germany:
Do you want to end up an experiment!? Next lesson! What do you do when your enemy tells you to surrender?

Italy:
That's an easy one, sir: surrender immediately, kiss their butts, and form ---, sing, eat, and go to bed!

Germany:
That's the same thing you do to me! Japan!

Japan:
Yes, sir! I respond Japanese way! Be unclear! Say one thing, but mean something else completely opposite like "I'll think about it!" Lie to them!

France:
I lost to those idiots? Le ---....

Germany:
Hetalia!

When I started cleaning my storage room on a whim, it brought back that memory.

Lithuania:
Mr. America! Are you trying to clean up here? I'll do it for you.

America:
Oh, no. That's alright. It's just a little shit cleaning, I can handle it. I need to see for myself what I should get rid of.

All the good things and bad things are in this place (storage room).

Hetalia: America's Storage Room Cleaning
Coming soon on this show.

Lithuania:
'kay. Some coffee? I'll go make some.

America:
Hetalia!

Japan:
So this is Rome. It's wonderful! Just wonderful!

Italy:
Really? You like architecture?

Japan:
Hai. It's a hobby of mine.

Italy:
Is that right? Well, I've got the perfect gift for you, you're going to love it!

Japan:
Nani? Are you sure?
A column....

Narrator:
On the land where the White Tigers fell, there stands a column from Pompei sent by Italy and a stone monument sent by Germany. The phrase "dedicated to the Bushido spirits" was engraved on the column; however, it is said that it was widdled away under the order of the US after the war. You can see these columns in Aizu-Fukushima prefecture.

Italy:
I'm so surprised that your brute culture could produce such fine paintings! They're so beautiful!

Japan:
I am humbled to have Italy pay us such a warm compliment. Please enjoy this library which is dedicated to Japanese work.

Italy:
Thanks, Japan! I love art books.

Japan:
Is there something wrong? Ah!

Italy:
It's porn....

Children:
To be continued!
