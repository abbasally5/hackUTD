Kirche: 
Here now
Say ahh

Saito:
Ahh

Kirche:
Do you like it?

Saito:
Yeah
This is really tasty

Kirche:
I'm glad
This fruit is a specialty to Germania

Louise:
Hey
Don't feed someone else's familiar

Kirche:
Oh it's alright
We all get bored when we're stuck here all the time in study hall
I mean the whole thief thing is giving them no time to hold classes
They're making it such a big deal
I heard a rumor that they're going to try to blame the whole thing on Princess Henrietta
The reason Fukay was able to sneak in was that they pulled what few guards that had to guard the vault to guard the princess
On top of that I heard that Henrietta decided to visit the institute
In spite of all objections from her advisers

Louise:
Oh Princess

Mr.Colbert:
Ms.Valiere and Ms.Tabitha
Please come to the principal's office immediately


Louise:
Hey what are you doing here?

Kirche:
I don't know
Sounded like fun

Miss Longueville:
But you're gathering several witnesses in town
The credible information about a suspicious shadow seen entering and deserting an empty shack deep in the woods this morning

Osmond:
Very speedy work Miss Longueville
You are to be commended

Miss Longueville:
From those testimonies I attempted to sketch a picture of the shadow

Osmond:
What do you think?

Louise:
This is Fukay
There's no doubt about it

Mr.Colbert:
We must report this incident to the palace at once
I'll send a request along with it
We'll ask the royal guards to go after her

Osmond:
If we waste time with those bureaucrats Fukay will get away
We must retrieve the Staff of Destruction and capture Fukay ourselves 
If we're to regain our honor that was tarnished by that thief 
Now raise your staff if you're up for the challenge
What's this?
Are there none among you who wish to raise their fame by capturing Fukay?

Lousie:
I'll do it

Saito:
What?

Mr.Colbert:
But Ms.Valiere

Kirche:
I will go too

Louise:
Zerbst?

Kirche:
Well I can't afford to lose to a Valiere

Louise:
Why don't you just-

Kirche:
Tabitha?
You don't have to come
This is a problem between the two of us

Tabitha:
I'm worried about both of you

Kirche:
Tabitha?

Louise:
Thank you Tabitha

Osmond:
Well I will leave it to the three of you then
These two have witnessed what Fukay can do
On top of that Miss Tabitha here is a Chevalier knight 
So talented at so young an age

Louise:
A knight?

Kirche:
Is that true Tabitha?

Osmond:
Miss Zerbst comes from an established military family in Germania
Very old stock
And I'm told by someone reliable that her flame magic is of the very best quality
And uh...
Miss Valiere over here is the daughter of the well regarded Valiere family
Which has several excellent mages in the past and...
She has a very bright future
Ah yes that's right
And I hear that her familiar is an excellent swordsman
Overwhelmed Guiche de Grammond
Son of the famous swordsman General Grammond

Mr.Colbert:
That's right
He uses the legendary G-

Osmond:
The institute will be looking forward to your hard work
As well as your duties as nobles

Miss Longueville:
Lord Osmond?
I will service their guide if it is your wish

Osmond:
An excellent idea
Are you sure Miss Longueville?

Miss Longueville:
I've planned it from the start


Saito:
Hey

Louise:
What?

Saito:
The fact that she can use magic means Fukay is a noblewoman right?
Why is a noblewoman stealing things as a theif?

Miss Longueville:
The fact of the matter is not all mages are nobles
There any many mages that have been demoted from nobles to mages for various reasons
And among that group many disguise themselves as guards or common laborers 
Or have turned their lives to mischief and occasional crime 
Even I have been demoted from my status as a noblewoman

Louise:
Really?

Kirche:
But Miss Longueville how can that be?
Your Lord Osmond's secretary aren't you?

Miss Longueville:
Thankfully Lord Osmond isn't too picky whether his secretary is a noble or a peasant 

Kirche:
So what's the story behind you losing your noble status?
Hope you don't mind but I would love to hear it

Louise:
Zerbst I can't believe how rude you are

Kirche:
I'm just making idle chit chat because I'm bored
Geez what sad reasons do I have to come catch a thief?

Louise:
You didn't need to come at all

Kirche:
I'm here to protect my darling
Right darling?

Saito:
Uh sure

Kirche:
What about you?
What are you gonna do if a big golem shows up?

Louise:
That's obvious I'll use my magic to take him out

Kirche:
Magic?
Yeah right
Don't make me laugh Zero

Saito:
Oh come on we didn't come all this way to hear you two fight

Kirche:
Oh darling
You forgot the sword I gave you

Saito:
That's ok 
I brought my own sword

Kirche:
Please a cheap sword like that won't help in this situation
Don't you agree?

Saito:
Well I don't exactly think otherwise
But uh...

Louise:
Go ahead and do whatever you want


Kirche:
See there you go you have permission from your master

Saito:
Then I guess it's ok

Miss Longueville:
According to the information it has to be that shack right there
It's an old coal burning shack

Louise:
It could be some clever camouflage 

Saito:
It looks like an empty house
There doesn't seem to be anywhere to hide
There's nobody in there

Tabitha:
There aren't any traps

Kirche:
Hey Tabitha

Lousie:
I'll just keep the area secure

Saito:
That's good you do that

Miss Longueville:
In that case I will scout out the surrounding area

Kirche:
Let's do a once over to see if there's any clues here

Saito:
I'll doubt we'll find anything

Kirche:
Oh I'm getting totally covered in dust
Tabitha, Saito let's get out of here

Tabitha:
Staff of Destruction

Kirche and Saito:
Huh?

Louise:
What's the matter?

Saito:
The box does match but...
Louise!

Tabitha:
Golem!
Need peace har

Kirche:
In ex het
Let flame fire!
Not even a mark
Impossible

Saito:
Wait
Where's Louise?
Stop
What are you doing?
Louise run!

Louise:
I don't want to

Saito:
Stop it Louise 
You're no match for him
You can't even cast a spell

Louise:
I am a noble
Just because you can use magic it doesn't make you a noble
A noble is someone who never shows their back to the enemy
I'm a noble 
I'm not Louise the Zero!
Teelneidu flunger
Stay out of this!

Saito:
So what you're a noble
What of it
It's all pointless if you die idiot

Louise:
But...
People always make fun of me
And it really hurts my feelings alot
They'll make fun of me again if I run away from this

Saito:
Uh...
Hey come on now don't cry

Louise:
I want to keep the promise I made to the princess

Tabitha:
Get on

Saito:
Kirche take her

Kirche:
Oh get a grip on yourself

Tabitha:
You should too

Saito:
It's alright go

Louise:
Saito

Saito:
Making me wanna do something like this 
Damn piece of dirt
You're mine now
Don't underestimate me
I'm the familiar of Louise the Zero
You've gotta be kidding

Kirche:
Aww and it was such a nice looking Germania sword

Derflinger:
Draw me

Saito:
But I'll break you too

Derflinger:
If you don't wanna die draw me
Get it 

Saito:
Alright
Shut up already
My body is so light


Derflinger:
Hey you wanna keep your mind on the game
Don't be blacking out on me
It's coming

Kirche:
Wow
Look at him go all of a sudden

Saito:
Damn
I won't lose like this
But I also won't be able to win
What should I do?

Louise:
I have to do something
Labor effect

Kirche:
What are you doing?

Louise:
Let me down right now

Kirche:
Louise

Louise:
Get away from Saito

Saito:
The Staff of Destruction?
I can't believe it

Louise:
What now?
Tel A-

Saito:
Louise!
Louise this isn't like one of your magic staffs
You use it like this 
Take cover

Louise:
Amazing

Saito:
How can something like that be here?
Louise?

Kirche:
He's a peasant but he can use a magic staff?
You are my darling after all you know that

Tabitha:
Where do you think Fukay is?

Kirche:
Right
The mere fact that the golem was here means that she's close

Miss Longueville:
You did a good job

Louise:
Miss Longueville
Where have you been?

Miss Longueville:
The Staff of Destruction describes it well enough
It blew my golem up into a wild column of dust

Kirche:
What do you mean your golem?

Saito:
Impossible
You're...Fukay?

Fukay:
Don't move 
Even though I stole it doesn't abide because I couldn't figure out how it worked
I was sure that if I lured someone from the institute of magic here it would yield some very good results

Kirche:
So that's why 

Fukay:
My plan was slightly off that a bunch of students came instead of instructors
I thought the familiar there would be able to pull it off
As you would expect from Gundolf

Louise:
Who's Gundolf?

Fukay:
I give you my thanks
Now goodbye
What is this?

Saito:
Unfortunately it's a single use weapon
It's called a rocket launcher
And it came from my world
So I guess this means our job is done
Isn't that right?

Osmond:
We have handed Fukay over to the palace guards
And the Staff of Destruction has been safely secured in the vault
And that is the end to these matters
You're all guests of honor for tonight's banquet

Kirche:
That's to be expected

Osmond:
But the palace thinks very highly of your conduct after this incident
I am certain that some reward would come from the palace to the three of you

Kirche:
Really?
A reward from the palace?
Wow


Louise:
You said three 
Does that mean Saito isn't included?

Osmond:
Unfortunately since he is not a nobleman you are correct

Louise:
Oh I see

Saito:
I don't care about that
But if it would be alright I would like to ask you about something

Kirche:
I'm going to have to dress up extra nice today 

Louise:
Saito

Saito:
I am not someone from this world
I was summoned here by Louise not knowing why

Mr.Colbert:
You what?

Saito:
The Staff of Destruction is a weapon that exists in my world
Where did you find it?

Osmond:
Oh I understand
So that's how you knew
The Staff of Destruction is a memento from a particular man
It's hard to believe its already been thirty years 
He saved my life that day
And he was dressed in a peculiar outfit I've never seen before
That man had suffered terrible wounds in battle
I brought him back to the institute as quickly as I could
I nursed him round the clock day and night
But alas

Saito:
You..
You mean he passed away

Osmond:
Yes
In the end I was never able to figure out who that brave man was or where he came from
The man carried in his pack two Staves of Destruction
I placed the Staff he was able to save me with inside the coffin along with his body
And I offered the second one to the palace so it could be safe from dangerous hands

Mr.Colbert:
To think such a story was behind the Staff of Destruction

Saito:
Damnit I thought I finally found a clue to help me on my way back

Derflinger:
Hey partner what's wrong?
There's a party going on here what's with the glum face?

Saito:
Leave me alone
I thought I could be able to go home
But I'm not any closer than before

Announcer:
Ladies and gentleman presenting Miss Louise Francois de la Blanc de Valiere
Second year student and daughter of Duke Valiere

Saito:
What the-
Hey wait a minute
Is that Louise?

Derflinger:
Fine feathers make fine birds huh?

Louise:
You be quiet
Why are you just standing there looking dazed?

Saito:
It's fine for me to do anything right?
I mean I haven't been given any orders from the master today
Hey something is starting
Go on your missing it

Louise:
It wouldn't bother me to dance with you

Saito:
If that's the way you're going to ask me to dance then you shouldn't bother

Louise:
Ok just for today
Will you please honor me with one songsworth of a dance my young gentleman?

Saito:
Sure
Ok
Um maybe this wasn't such a good idea
I've never really danced before

Louise:
Just follow me

Saito:
Like this?

Louise:
You know I believe you

Saito:
Believe what?

Louise:
That you came here from a completely different world

Saito:
What do you mean?
You didn't believe that I was telling the truth?

Louise:
I was rather doubtful until now
But that awful Staff of Destruction
Was a weapon from your world right?
Seeing something like that makes me believe you
Do you wanna go back?

Saito:
Well yeah

Louise:
Of course
Um thank you Saito

Saito:
Uh whats up with all of this?
You're acting kind of strange today

Louise:
You...you saved me from death when I was almost crushed by that golem
That's all 

Saito:
What are you talking about?
That's to be expected

Louise:
How come?

Saito:
Well
Because I'm your familiar Louise

Derflinger:
Well this is a surprise
A familiar that serves as his master's dance partner
I've never seen anything like it
A real surprise
