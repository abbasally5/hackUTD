Princess Henrietta:
 Congratulations and well done Louise Francois

Louise:
 Thank you so much Your Highness
 But I'm really not worthy of the honor of such a wonderful title of Chevalier

Princess Henrietta:
 But what you have achieved makes you worthy Louise Francois
 You've led the capture of the thief that's had the palace up in arms for quite sometime
 And I give you my thanks as well trustworthy familiar

Saito:
 Oh no

Princess Henrietta:
 I trust I can count on you to continue taking good care of my dear friend in the future

Louise:
 Your Highness stop
 You musn't offer your hand to a familiar like him

Princess Henrietta:
 To protect you is equal in my eyes to sweating loyalty to me personally
 I must give something in return for such an oath of royalty

Saito:
 A hand...
 So I'm still being treated like a dog

Louise:
 No that's not it
 To put it bluntly you're supposed to kiss her now

Saito:
 I'm not that fearless

Louise:
 Hurry up will ya
 You're being rude

Saito:
 Ok
 Excuse me then

Louise:
 What did you do to her?
 Why would you do something like that to a royal highness?
 You dog!

Louise:
 I-I am terribly sorry about this
 Come on hurry up and apologize to her

Saito:
 I'm sorry
 But you told me I'm supposed to kiss her

Louise:
 What kind of idiot would kiss the princess on her lips

Saito:
 Me

Princess Henrietta:
 It's alright
 A reward is necessary for an oath of loyalty
 Actually I have a favor to ask the two of you

Louise:
 Please go ahead and ask anything of us
 If you tell us to die I will throw myself out the window and take this stupid dog with me

Saito:
 Wait hold on
 What are you saying?

Louise:
 You shutup 

Princess Henrietta:
 I would like you two to take some time and live out in the village for a little while

Saito and Louise:
 The village?

Louise:
 It's so dull

Saito:
 But Louise you're the one who said we needed to buy new clothes to dress up as peasants

Louise:
 I just don't understand why we can't get clothes that are more fashionable

Saito:
 Come on
 You really understand what we're supposed to be doing?

Louise:
 Well yes of course I do

Princess Henrietta:
 This is a permit sanctioned by the palace

Louise:
 You want us to do some spying for you down in the main village?

Princess Henrietta:
 Lately I've been hearing some rumors about some nobles oppressing peasants and treating them without care or dignity
 When I asked those in the area all of them said that such a thing would never happen
 That nobles were good role models for the peasants
 However seeming between the case with you two and Count Maht I cannot leave them as simple rumors anymore
 Therefore I would like you to investigate the goings on in the village while maintaining a cloak of total secrecy
 Understand this is to be a very difficult job

Louise:
 Yes Your Highness I understand perfectly
 I will make sure this job gets done as if my life and his depended on it

Saito:
 I'm starting to get worried about what's coming next

Louise:
 Next up is a horse

Saito:
 Huh?
 A horse!

Louise:
 Really
 A horse costs 400 ecues?
 One horse would use up all the money we were given for this mission
 200 ecues a night!

Innkeeper:
 Our inn is of the finest class where even nobles spend the night

Louise:
 We don't have nearly enough money

Saito:
 You can't just look for a cheaper inn can you?

Louise:
 No way
 I cannot sleep in a cheap filthy room

Saito:
 So I guess this job was impossible for a girl of noble birth after all

Louise:
 Fine then I guess I'll just have to make do myself

Saito:
 What?
 What are you gonna do?

Louise:
 Don't follow me

Saito:
 Aw come on


Saito:
 You lost all the money in the casino!

Louise:
 But they said I'd end up with more money

Saito:
 That's why I can't leave you alone

Louise:
 Be quiet
 I'm trying to think about what it is we're going to do next from here

Saito:
 We have no choice but to bow down to the princess and ask for more money

Louise:
 This mission is something the princess asked us to do as a personal favor
 I'm sure she had lots of trouble coming up with the money

Saito:
 You knew that yet you wanted to buy a horse
 And you just had to sleep in an expensive inn
 I'm amazed you could want so much

Louise:
 I needed them but you wouldn't understand

Saito:
 I'm hungry
 Unfortunately finding somewhere to sleep comes before food

Scarron:
 Tres bien!
 You have such a beautiful face
 From the looks of it you seem to be in some sort of trouble
 As you can obviously see I am nobody suspicious at all

Saito:
 No
 From the looks of it it's better to say you are

Scarron:
 My name is Scarron and I run a lovely tavern up the road from here

Saito:
 Tavern?

Sacrron:
 Yes
 A tavern
 Would you like me to furnish the two of you with one of our delightful rooms?

Saito:
 Wait
 Really?

Louise:
 Saito!

Scarron:
 How-Eve-Er
 I do have one condition you must accept

Scarron:
 Understood my lovely sweet fairies
 N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-NO
 I have told you a million times
 When we are in the shop you are to call me Mademoiselle
 Tres bien
 Now good news for all of my special fairies
 We have a new fairy in training here at the Enchanting Fairy
 Oh little Louise please come show yourself
 Little Louise is a poor little girl who ran away from home with her older brother right before her father was to sell her off to pay for his gambling debt

Louise:
 Hello
 My name is Louise and uh...
 Nice to meet you all

Scarron:
 Everyone applaud now 

Saito:
 Oh man she looks like she's pretty upset after all

Fairy:
 Hey newcomer come over here and help me wash the dishes
 We're going to open the place up soon

Saito:
 Sure
 No problem
 Right away

Fairy:
 You have a very cute younger sister

Saito:
 Thanks
 What did you say?

Fairy:
 Nothing
 My name is Jessica what do they call you

Saito:
 I'm Saito

Jessica:
 Saito?
 Unusual name

Saito:
 Yeah so I've been told

Jessica:
 Nice to meet you Saito
 Just ask me if there's anything you want to know about this place

Saito:
 Nice to meet you

Louise:
 That stupid dog

Scarron:
 Everyone
 Now that I've aqnnounced our new girl and gleese into our house this week is our long awaited tip contest

Louise:
 What's a tip contest?

Scarron:
 The enchanted fairy who earns the most amount of money in tips will get a very special bonus
 And ta-da
 You will have the right to wear the secret family heirloom that has been inspiration for our name
 The enchanted fairy bustier

Fairies:
 Wow
 Wonderful Mi Madamoiselle

Scarron:
 Oui
 Tres Bien
 This bustier is enchanted with magic that charms the beholder
 So the day you wear this you can earn tips without knowing any limits

Louise:
 Earning without limits?

Scarron:
 The girl who won the race last year earned so much she was able to move back to her hometown
 So all of you do your best in hopes to wear this bustier
 That goes for you too new girl 

Louise:
 Oh sure
 Yes this is my chance


Louise:
 I've brought you another bottle of what you ordered sir

Man:
 What are you waiting for?

Louise:
 What's that?

Man:
 Hurry up and pour it

Louise:
 Me?
 A noble?
 Serving a peasant

Man:
 Why are you standing there the wine isn't gonna pour itself you know

Louise:
 It's for the mission
 It's for the mission
 I would like to serve the wine now if that's alright
 I'm sure you'll enjoy it

Man:
 What's the matter with you?

Louise:
 I'm really sorry 

Man:
 Eh you're a cute one
 But it's a shame you don't got much in the boob department
 So to make up for it I think you ought to serve the drink to me mouth to mouth
 Hey what's the big idea

Louise:
 You filthy scum
 How dare you do this to a daughter of a duke

Scarron:
 Oh I'm terribly sorry sir
 Little Louise is a new girl here so she's not use to how we do things yet
 Louise bring us a new clean damp cloth right away

Louise:
 Yes sir

Scarron:
 In her place I'll provide you with a special service

Man:
 Hey!
 Hold on
 Stop

Louise:
 You've got to be kidding
 Why
 Why do I a mage and a daughter of a duke have to-
 Deal with-
 Such-

Saito:
 Calm down
 We've secured a place to sleep and got some food
 And on top of that we can make some money
 So now we're in good shape

Louise:
 A place to sleep?
 Where this attic that looks more like a closet?

Saito:
 He said that a lot of his customers were nobles so we're killing three birds with one stone

Louise:
 Yeah well it's easy for you
 You get to stay in the back and have fun with that girl

Saito:
 Girl?

Louise:
 Oh nevermind all that
 I can't believe that you're going to make a noble like me to sleep in a place like this

Saito:
 If you don't wanna sleep you're welcome to do whatever you please
 There were too many things going on today
 So I'm tired

Louise:
 I don't get it
 How can you adapt to things so quickly

Saito:
 Well it's the only good trait I have
 Besides it's not much different from how I'm usually treated

Louise:
 Geez
 His master is forced to wear something like that and he feels nothing about it
 At least he could've pretended-
 Why do I feel...

Man:
She's just a kid
I thought this place promised sexy girls

Man:
You are so cute
You know go gettish girls like you are really my type
I just can't resist em
Especially when they're flat

Saito:
 You mean you're Mr.Scarron's daughter?

Jessica:
 Oh no
 That's another one you broke
 Well anyway that's right
 I'm in charge of everything that goes around in the tavern

Saito:
 To think a girl like her could be born into this world by such a big...

Scarron:
 Louise
 I want you to just sit there and watch how the other girls do it

Louise:
 I'm sorry Mi Mademoiselle

Scarron:
 Oh welcome

Louise:
 Why do I have to dress up in this stupid outfit and sell favors to these people
 And on top of it they all keep saying I'm so small and flat

Saito:
 Oh really?

Jessica:
 Yeah

Saito:
 Mr.Scarron did?

Jessica:
 He seems to like you an awful lot
 He said you were his favorite type
 What are you gonna do

Louise:
 It's breasts!
 He's after breasts like the others

Jessica:
 Are you alright?
 You passed out cold when a flying bottle of wine came outta nowhere and hit you in the head

Saito:
 Bottle?
 Why would someone want to throw a bottle-

Jessica:
 I know
 Louise isn't really your younger sister now is she'

Saito:
 Why are you saying that?

Jessica:
 I can tell just looking at you two
 But it's not like you two are dating each other either

Saito:
 You know Jessica
 I think you've misunderstood

Jessica:
 Oh and about Louise
 She's a noble isn't she?

Saito:
 What?
 No
 How could you even think that?
 I mean there's no way that such a violent girl with no elegance or grace could possibly be a noble

Jessica:
 Just as I've thought
 You know that she couldn't even carry a plate when she started today
 She has an unusual amount of pride in herself
 And the way she behaves
 She's gotta be a noble
 So does that mean you're like her servant or something?

Saito:
 No I'm not a servant
 It'd be much better if you just kept out of this

Jessica:
 Huh?
 Why's that?
 You're on some dangerous mission aren't you
 Oh that sounds like fun
 I just love stories like that
 Come on tell me
 I promise I won't tell anyone else

Saito:
 Yeah you say that
 But how do I know-

Jessica:
 In exchange there's a lot of stuff I can teach you if you want

Saito:
 T-Teach what kind of stuff?

Jessica:
 Oh don't ask the obvious

Louise:
 Alright what are you doing there?

Saito:
 Gathering information
 D-D-Did you know that Jessica here is actually Mr.Scarron's daughter
 So I was asking about the customers that come and go 

Louise:
 What kind of information have you gathered
 You really are a stupid dog

Jessica:
 Hold on Louise

Louise:
 What do you want?

Jessica:
 Aren't you supposed to be working now?

Louise:
 Why don't you just shutup
 I'll go back to work as soon as I train this stupid dog
 I mean brother how to behave

Jessica:
 Do you really have time to waste on all that?
 It seems to me you're not very good at getting tips as it is
 Oh well I guess you just can't help it
 With such a meager

Louise:
 What?
 You?
 Just because I don't have big breasts I'm called a brat...waterflea

Saito:
 No one said waterflea

Louise:
 Just you watch
 When I put my mind to it I can be really amazing 

Jessica:
 Is that so?
 Then that means you shouldn't have any trouble at all winning the tip contest at all right?

Louise:
 Of course I'll win you'll see

Louise:
 Today is the last day
 But not only will I risk first place

Scarron:
 Oh if it isn't Lord Chalen
 It's nice of you to come all the way out here

Lord Chalen:
 Looks like your business is doing quite well Scarron

Scarron:
 On no not at all
 Today is the exception of the rule
 Usually it's so empty you can hear a cuckoo cry

Lord Chalen:
 Enough with the excuses
 I'm here today as a customer

Scarron:
 Unfortunately all the seats are taken now

Lord Chalen:
 Well it certainly doesn't seem that way to me

Lord Chalen:
I guess you were right when you said this place was empty
Aw come on is there no one here to serve the queen's tax collector wine?

Saito:
 Who's that?

Jessica:
 That's Chalen
 The man in charge of collecting the taxes here
 If we stand up against him he'll just put a huge tax on us
 So no one running a business can afford to anger him

Saito:
 I see

Jessica:
 He fondles you all night long and doesn't pay you a tip
 And there's not a single girl here that's willing to serve him

Saito:
 Look someone is going up to him

Louise:
 He's a rich looking noble
 This is my chance

Jessica:
 Louise

Saito:
 Oh she's such an idiot 

Louise:
 You are a very charming man sir

Lord Chalen:
 Has this place decided to let men serve now?
 Oh you're just a little girl with really small breasts
 Just a flat
 For a minute there I actually thought you were a man
 Now you must let me take a closer look at how small those breasts are

Louise:
 Stop!


Lord Chalen:
What?
Damn you!
You're rude
You're a mere peasant
How dare you

Scarron:
 Please forgive her
 She just started working here and doesn't know any better

Lord Chalen:
 Shutup
 How dare you 

Louise:
 Saito

Saito:
 That'll be enough out of you old man

Lord Chalen:
 How dare you speak to me that way I'm a noble

Saito:
 Big deal

Lord Chalen:
What!
What was that

Saito:
 The only one here allowed to touch Louise is me

Lord Chalen:
I want them captured and chained
Now have them hung for sedition

Saito:
 We'll see who's gonna capture who
 I'll warn you now that I was the one who caught the infamous thief
 It's in the attic

Lord Chalen:
 Capture him and that flat poor girl

Saito:
 Hold on just a second

Louise:
 Watch poor girl went too far

Saito:
 Louise?
 Where did you get that wand from

Louise:
 Unlike you I thought ahead
 I had it tied to my thigh just in case of an emergency
 I went to the trouble of serving you the best I could
 Why do i have to be subject to such insult and abuse

Lord Chalen:
 Are-Are you?
 A noble?

Louise:
 I have no right to give to a lowlife official like you
 Before you regret it just shutup and get out of here now

Lord Chalen:
 You're a fallen noble who's hiding her identity
 Who do you think I am some sort of
 What?

Louise:
 Who are you calling a fallen noble?


Lord Chalen:
 A permit from the palace?
 Please Miss oh please
 I'll give you this if you just forget about what's happened
 Please miss I'm begging you

Louise:
 It is important to her highness that you forget everything you've seen and heard today

Lord Chalen:
 Yes Yes
 In the name of her highness and her and her founder
 I will not say one word of this to everyone alive

Saito:
 Idiot you shouldn't be using magic in public

Louise:
 But I-

Scarron:
 Look
 We don't ask our employees about their background or where they come from
 So we didn't see anything and we didn't hear anything
 Right everyone

Fairies:
 That's right
 We didn't see a thing

Jessica:
 You're the winner
 There's really no need to count it either

Louise:
 But they just put all of this before they left

Jessica:
 They didn't put it here on their own so it's officially a tip
 Right papa?

Scarron:
 Oui
 The winner of this year's tip contest is Little Louise


Saito:
 They say that
 But now that our cover is blown we're gonna have to find someplace else to stay
 Huh?
 What are you doing?
 If you're gonna change I'll help

Louise;
 No wait
 Don't look yet

Saito:
 Now you're suddenly shy?
 Th-that's the enchanting fairy bustier

Louise:
 Well since I was given the opportunity I decided to borrow it
 I mean it'd be a shame if I didn't

Saito:
 It's not because of your magic is it?

Louise:
 What?
 How rude
 I went to the effort of putting it on
 The least you could do is be nice

Saito:
 Tres bien

Louise:
 Would you mind complimenting me some other way

Fouquet:
 It's awfully late
 What do you want?

???:
I'm here to pick up our comrade
Fouquet the Scultptor
Or should I say Matilda the of the South Gotha
I know you

Noisy Kirche and Tabitha have apparently gone home for summer vacation So the institute has gotten pretty quiet and kinda lonely What?Hey dog!Who do you think you're flirting with while standing there completely naked?Next Episode:
