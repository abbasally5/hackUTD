Saito: 
Ahh we're finally home!

Louise:
Stop touching me in places you shouldn't be touching!

Saito:
Sorry it's so flat I couldn't tell
In any case it's really quiet

Louise:
It's summer vacation right now
There are lots of people who have gone home for the holidays
Or they're just traveling

Saito:
Summer vacation?

Louise:
Huh?

Kirche:
Oh Louise
I hadn't seen you around today so naturally I thought you'd gone home already

Louise:
I just went out for a bit to run errands
You guys are going away?

Kirche:
Oh darling!
I finally got the chance to see you again
Only once more to be torn apart
Please forgive me for this

Saito:
No problem at all

Kirche:


Louise:
Tabitha's?

Kirche:
Have a great vacation my darling

Saito:
A great vacation

Louise:
What great vacation?!
Huh?!

Kirche:
How do I put it?
It's serene
Hey Tabitha
We're taking the effort to come see your folks
Why don't you look a little happier about it

Quite a coincidence 
So why did you decide to do it?
With me it was more like sweeping away their problem
I was kind of a troublemaker and I was forced to quit my previous school 
My father said having their daughter loitering around wasn't good for their image 
So they tried to force me into a hastily arranged marriage to an old man no less
An old man!
I mean you have got to be kidding
We stopped
I wonder what's going on

Driver:
I'm sorry miss but Lake Ladori has been flooded and all the roads have been washed out

Stranger:
There's a detour upon high ground you can use

Kirche:
Was there a heavy rainstorm or something?


Louise:



Saito:
Yeah yeah

Louise:
He's always wooing over everyone and anyone with no discretion at all
Oh
Why do I have to be upset about something completely ridiculous like that
Ahh! Geez! It's so irritating!

Saito:
Louise yelling
Unreasonable amounts of labor
But for some reason it all puts me at ease
Huh?

Guiche:
What are you saying?
It was all a misunderstanding

Montmorency:
Yeah well I've heard that line way to many times
Try to understand Guiche
I don't feel anything for you anymore
And I'm not sure I ever did
I'm only listening now because you pleaded with me so much

Guiche:
Oh!


Montmorency:
Ha!

Oh you
Didn't Louise go home for the holidays?

Saito:
She's here

Guiche:
Please wait I beg you!

Montmorency:
Please leave me alone!

Guiche:
W-wait!
Montmorency
Listen to what I have to say
Please
Montmorency

Saito:
They really don't learn don't they
Huh?
I got it!

Marteaux:
I have put it here with plans of throwing it away

Saito:
You think you might let me have it?

Marteaux:
Yes of course you can!
Please take it Our Sword what's mine is yours

Saito:
Can't you do something about this nickname and these spectacular gestures of affection?
They're a little much don't ya think?


Saito:
This should be a good place

Derflinger:
If you had got the sense to have a noble bring it here for you
You could've brought it here no time with magic

Saito:
Huh?
It's alright 
This is something personal

Derflinger:
What are you gonna do with a giant pot anyway?

Saito:
Just wait till tonight

Derflinger:
Tonight?

Kirche:
He's right we wouldn't have made it across
Those houses are completely under water
How much further is your house?
Are we getting close yet?

Tabitha:
Nearly there

Kirche:
Was that?
It was


I thought so

Butler:
Welcome back Miss
We had been expecting you
Lady Charlotte

Kirche:
Would it be possible to say hello to your father first?

Tabitha:
Wait here please

Kirche:
Oh alright

Butler:
Excuse me Miss
I am the butler in charge of the Orleans family house
My name is Percerin

Kirche:

I am in your good care

Percerin:
I had not imagined nor was I told that our small Lady Charlotte would bring a friend with her on her summer vacation

Kirche:
So Tabitha's actual name is Charlotte?

Percerin:
Huh?

Tabitha's Mother:
Who is it?

Tabitha:
I have just returned from school mother

Tabitha's Mother:
You stand back!
How impolite!

Percerin:
So at school our small Lady calls herself Tabitha?

Kirche:
Why did she come to study abroad using a fake name?
She never really says anything about herself or her past

Percerin:
Studying in another country was ordered by her uncle the King of Gallia

Kirche:
Uncle?
I was right she is a member of the royal family

Percerin:
Lady Charlotte is of royal blood
Her father was the late Count Orleans
Who was the younger brother of the current King of the realm

Kirche:
I see
So her father has already passed away

Perccerin:
He was murdered I'm afraid

Kirche:
Huh?

Percerin:
If you are someone our small Lady trusts with her heart I'm sure it's fine
I will trust you Lady Zerbst in telling you a very personal story

Tabitha's Mother:
You are someone from the royal family aren't you!
Are you going to make death with my little Charlotte just like you did with my poor husband?!

Percerin:
Count Orleans, despite being the second son of the family, was more adept as a mage than his brother Lord Joseph and more intelligent
Furthermore, he was quite full of charisma and talent
Five years ago when the previous King passed away
The palace court became bitterly divided over which of the sons was more worthy to take over the throne and rule as King

Kirche:
A battle for the crown
Right

Percerin:
During the course of this filthy battle Count Orleans was murdered by conspiracy
Those who put Lord Joseph on the throne to rid themselves of
future challenges next will go after the daughter Lady Charlotte

Percerin:
One evening our grand Lady and our small lady were invited to banquet in a nobleman's home
It was laced with a water magic poison that induces insanity and whoever drinks it...
That became public knowledge
And the noble responsible for his actions was convicted
The grand Lady had sacrificed herself for our small Lady Charlotte
Ever since...our grand Lady

Tabitha's Mother:
How horrible to think that this girl was some dNext Episode: Louise's Change of Heart**
