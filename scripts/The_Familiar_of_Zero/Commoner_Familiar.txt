  Cashier: 
That'll be 8,500 yen for the repairs.

修理代、8,500円になります。

Saito:
I gotta get myself a part-time job.

 WAIT!
 LET GO!
 SOMEBODY HELP ME!
 AHHHHH!
 AHHHHH!

 バイトしなきゃな～。

 ちょ…ちょっと！
 誰か！
 うぉあああああ！

Louise:
Earth?

地球？

Saito:
That's right Earth.
Until a few minutes ago, I was located in Tokyo, Japan just located on Earth.



Louise:
Well, I don't believe it.
I don't believe such a world exist.



Saito:
I don't wanna believe this, but here I am.
And any case, I don't belong here.
So, send me back home.



Louise:
I can't.

私はできません。

Saito:
You wanna at least think about it for a minute?

ユー·ワナは、少なくとも分間それについて考える？

Louise:
No matter who it is are where comes from.
The contract is absolute.



Saito:
What are you doing?

何してるの？

Louise:
I'm undressing so I can go to bed.

私はベッドに行くことができるので、私は服を脱いだ。

Saito:
Do you mind not doing that when I'm not around?

あなたはそれをやって、私は周りにいないよいつ？しない気にしないでください

Louise:
Why?

なぜですか？

Saito:
You're fine with a guy watching you while you take off your clothes?

あなたは、あなたの服を脱いでいる間あなたを見て男といいですよ？

Louise:
You a guy?
You're nothing more than a lowly familiar



Saito:
What!?!
Ahh!



Louise:
Oh
I want you to wash those for me



Saito:
You want me to-
But why do I have to wash your lingerie?
You know I don't know whether to be happy or upset about this
No this is supposed to be the part where I get upset
Hey you know what I'm never gonna do your laundry!



Louise:
Who do you think will be taking care of you from now on?
Look you're my familiar right?
Cleaning laundry
Errands and such
Those are to be expected
Make sure you have to have my change of clothes ready in the morning
Don't worry if you work properly and don't make any trouble I'll be sure to feed you
Everyday



Saito:
You'll feed me!?!
What do you think I am a dog?
Well I guess whatever happens, happens for now
Its so cold



Louise:
Hmm?
Hey wait...who are you?



Saito:
Here's your clothes
You told me to have it ready for you in the morning
So there it's ready



Louise:
Oh the familiar
The peasant I summoned yesterday
Hey where are my panties?



Saito:
You can get those yourself!

あなたがそれらを自分で得ることができます！

Louise:
And you can go a day without eating

そして、あなたは食べずに一日行くことができます

Saito:
What?

何？

Louise:
They're in the bottom drawer

彼らは、一番下の引き出しの中にいる

Saito:
Hmm?
Damnit
Why'd she have to pick me?
Ahh here!
Excuse me but could you take this thing off of me already?



Louise:
No

ノー

Saito:
I won't run
You brought me to a place that makes absolutely no sense
There's no place to run even if I tried



Louise:
Alright!
Now shutup!



Saito:
Now what?

今度は何なの？

Louise:
Dress me

私のドレス

Saito:
You can put your own clothes on

あなたは、あなた自身の衣服を置くことができます

Louise:
The nobility never dress themselves!
That's what they have familiars for!



Saito:
Yeah well screw nobility!
And don't-



Louise:
Oh I guess you won't be needing to eat then
And you can keep wearing the chain



Saito:
Now you promised
Take this thing off of me now



Louise:
I guess I have no choice

私は選択肢がないと思います

Saito:
If she stayed quiet she'd be pretty

彼女は静かにとどまった場合、彼女はかなりあると思い

Louise:
What?

何？

Saito:
Oh I didn't say anything

ああ、私は何も言いませんでした

Louise:
Come on let's go

行きましょうさあ

Saito:
Huh?
Where to?



Louise:
We're going down to breakfast of course

我々はもちろん朝食に降りつもり

Kirche:
Oh look they're here
The much rumored familiar that ran away and his master



Saito:
Man now that's what I call a feast

男は今、それは私がごちそう呼んでいるものです

Louise:
Would you hurry up and pull the chair back
You really are inconsiderate



Saito:
Yeah sure whatever
Is it some kind of special day?
This is a big feast for so early
Oh uh sorry I haven't eaten anything since yesterday so...
Huh?
What is it?
Let me guess a plate?



Louise:
Only nobility are allowed to sit at this table
You peasants sit down there



Saito:
No!

違う！

Louise:
...I am once again grateful for this humble meal you have brought to us this morning

...私は、この謙虚な食事のためにもう一度感謝していますあなたは、今朝私たちにもたらした

Saito:
Hah!
What I have is humble



Louise:
Normally the familiars wait outside during the meal until their masters are finished
I made a special exception and let you stay



Saito:
Oh yeah well I would've rather waited outside
Hmm?
What are they doing over there?



Louise:
What?
Oh all second year students have the day off today
We're supposed to communicate with all the freshly summoned familiars



Saito:
I think maybe we ought to skip that

私は、我々がそれをスキップするべきだと思う多分

Kerche:
Oh?

ああ？

Saito:
Ahh!
What is that big red thing?



Kirche:
Is this the first time you've seen a salamander?

これはサンショウウオを見たのは初めてです？

Saito:
Keep it on a leash
That thing is dangerous!



Kirche:
He's perfectly safe
Under the contract familiars faithfully obey master's orders
And they never try to run away
Right flame?



Louise:
Why don't you just shutup!

なぜあなたは黙っていない！

Kirche:
You know I think you just grabbed some peasant that was nearby and pretended to summon him
You covered up that lie pretty well with that explosion



Louise:
That's not true
I made a proper summon
It just happened that this guy showed up



Kirche:
Well he's a proper familiar for Louise the Zero

まあ、彼はルイーズゼロのための適切なおなじみだ

Louise:
What is her major malfunction!
Don't just stand around
Bring me tea!



Saito:
Huh?
Ahh!
I'm sorry



Siesta:
That's ok
Really I'm fine
Oh I'm sorry



Saito:
No it was my fault

いいえ、それは私のせいではなかった

Siesta:
Umm...would you happen to be the one that was summoned by Miss Valiere and became her familiar?

うーん...あなたはミスValliereによって召喚し、彼女のおなじみとなった一つであることが起こるでしょうか？

Saito:
Oh so you've heard of me?

ああ、あなたは私を聞いたので、？

Siesta:
Are you kidding?
That's all everyone's talking about
A peasant becoming someone's familiar



Saito:
Well...I don't really understand anything about this peasant and nobility nonsense

うーん...私は本当にこの農民や貴族ナンセンスについては何も理解していない

Siesta:
Hmm?
Those who can use magic are nobility
And all those who can't are peasants



Saito:
Oh I see what they mean now?
So are you a mage too?



Siesta:
No not at all
My name is Siesta and I have an honor and a privilege to serve the nobility here
I'm a peasant just like you are



Saito:
I'm Saito Hiraga
Just call me Saito



Siesta:
Saito Hiraga?
You know that's a very strange name



Guiche:
Hey!
Are you going to bring me my cake?



Siesta:
Oh coming right up

ああ右考え出す

Saito:
Here let me bring it to him

ここで私は彼にそれを持ってみましょう

Siesta:
But...I'm supossed to do it

しかし...私はそれを行うことになってる

Saito:
It'll be fine
Hah!
This ought to be good for this stuck up snob



Guiche:
You know I stayed up late conversing with Verdante here

あなたは、私がここにVerdanteと後半会話更かし知る

Montmorency:
Really?
All night?
Wow...



Guiche:
Those intelligent eyes
The sensual texture of his scales
I know that deep down he was destined to become my familiar



Montmorency:
Yeah well do me a favor and keep him buried when you're with me

うんよく私に好意を行うと、あなたは私と一緒にいるとき、彼は葬ら保つ

Saito:
Here ya go!

ここ屋は行く！

Guiche:
Good now bring me some more tea
You're familiar is so very cute
Just like you are



Montmorency:
Thanks you're flattering as always

おかげであなたはいつものようにお世辞だ

Guiche:
That may be but I would never lie to your beautiful eyes

それはかもしれませんが、私はあなたの美しい目にうそないだろう

Montmorency:
So you say
But I've heard a rumor that you've recently gone out with a first year student



Guiche:
But that's nonsense
There's absolutely nothing that's hidden-



Saito:
Behind my feelings for you
That's how it goes right?



Guiche:
What the hell?

一体何？

Saito:
Oh I get it!
The [] colors are different depending on the grade
He's in black
So last night's girl in brown was a first year
Now I see



Montmorency:
What's he talking about?

彼について何を話している？

Guiche:
Hurry up and get back to your duties waiter

急いでとあなたの職務のウェイターに戻る

Saito:
Sorry I'm not a waiter

申し訳ありませんが私はウェイターじゃない

Guiche:
You're the one Louise the Zero-

1つのルイーズだゼロ

Saito:
About last night?
Thanks see ya



Montmorency:
Now Guiche
What was that all about?



Guiche:
I told you I had to deal with that peasant last night that's all
Ahh!
Montmorency listen
This place is too rowdy let's talk of this under that tree
Hurry come on



Montmorency:
Guiche?
What's wrong with you



Katie:
Lord Guiche
Where are you?



Saito:
Pardon me
If you're looking for Lord Guiche you can find him over there talking to some blonde girl



Katie:
Lord Guiche!
There you are!



Guiche:
Oh Katie...hi

ああケイティ...やあ

Katie:
I've been looking for you Lord Guiche
I brought my homemade souffle for the tea party
You know the one you and I talked about last night

私はあなたの主のギーシュを探してきた
私はお茶会のために私の手作りスフレをもたらし
あなたは、あなたと私は昨夜の話1つを知っている

Montmorency:
Last night?

昨夜？

Guiche:
Well you see I was just-

さてあなたは私がいたばかりの見

Saito:
Good for you
I see you have the chance to try some of her souflee



Guiche:
What?
What are you doing?



Saito:
Not much
Just telling the truth



Montmorency:
Guiche what is the meaning of this?

これの意味は何ですかギーシュ？

Guiche:
I don't know what you've been babbling on about peasant
You're getting me into a needless misunderstanding with these ladies



Boy:
What's going on?

どうなってるの？

Boy:
Looks like Guiche is picking a fight with that peasant boy familiar

ギーシュは、おなじみの農民の少年との戦いを選んでいるように見える

Saito:
But what is there to misunderstand?
You're the one two-timing them



Katie:
Two-timing!?!

二タイミング！！

Montmorency:
So there really is something going on between you and this first year

だから、本当に何かが、あなたとこの一年の間そこで起こっている

Guiche:
Please Montmorency
Please don't contort your face
One that is as beautiful as yours for mere anger
This is all a misunderstanding



Katie:
Oh how could you
You told me I was the only one



Guiche:
Would you please let me explain?

あなたは私が説明させてくださいますか？

Katie and Montmorency:
You're a big liar!

あなたは大きなうそつきだ！

Boy:
You just got dumped Guiche
And you deserved everything you got



Guiche:
It seems that you
Don't know how to pay the proper respect to nobility



Saito:
Yeah well...
That's just not a big issue in the world I come from



Guiche:
Do tell

教えてください

Saito:
A duel?

決闘？

Guiche:
That's right!
I hereby challenge you to a duel
You are nothing but a mere peasant
And a mere familiar to boot
And you have mocked me
And made two ladies cry
You cad!



Saito:
They weren't crying
They were completely livid with you



Guiche:
Go prepare yourself!
I will meet you at Vestry Square



Louise:
Hey you!
What do you think you're doing?



Saito:
Huh?
What's wrong?



Louise:
What do you mean what's wrong?
Why are you promising to fight a duel without my permission?



Saito:
Where are we going?

我々はどこに行くの？

Louise:
We're going to apologize to Guiche
He might still be willing to forgive you



Saito:
No way!

まさか！

Louise:
Huh?

えっ？

Saito:
I won't do it
And I shouldn't have to



Louise:
You don't get it do you?
Peasants never win against nobility
You might be lucky to get away with a few minor wounds



Saito:
Hey!
How do I get to Vestry Square?



Boy:
Over there
That way



Louise:
Malicorne!

Saito:
Thanks a lot

どうもありがとう

Louise:
Huh?
Hey wait!



Malicorne:
Oh this ought to be really good

ああこの当為は本当に良いであることが

Louise:
Oh jeez!
He's just a familiar but he does whatever he feels like



Osmond:
No previous case exists of a peasant familiar

以前のケースでは、おなじみの農民が存在しません

Colbert:
That is not the immediate problem at hand
I didn't recognize the familiar's rune on his hand at the ceremony
And so I went and looked it up
And it looks strikingly similar to this



Osmond:
Miss Longueville I apologize but-

ミス·ロングヴィル私は謝るけど、

Miss Longueville:
I understand sir

私は先生を理解する

Kirche:
You know what?
This peasant is starting to amuse me



Guiche:
I respect you for actually showing up

私が実際に現れていただきありがとう尊重

Saito:
Yeah?
Well who would run away from you?



Louise:
Wait!
Guiche stop this right now!
You know darn well duels are forbidden



Guiche:
True but duels from two nobility are forbidden
But he's a peasant so there's no problem



Louise:
But that's because
No case like this has come up before



Guiche:
Hmm?
Now Louise I don't mean to get too personal but...
Could it be that you're attracted to this peasant?



Lousie:
What!?!
How dare you!
Nobody would stand by as a familiar gets beaten down to a tattered heap!



Saito:
A tattered heap huh?

ボロボロヒープでしょ？

Guiche:
Well no matter what you say the duel has already started!
My name is Guiche the brass
Therefore a brass golem
A Valkyrie to be precise will be your opponent 



Saito:
This is unfair

これは不公平です

Guiche:
Oh come now it's expected a noble,a mage, would use magic in a duel

ああ、それは高貴な、メイジを期待している今に来る、決闘で魔法を使用することになり

Louise:
Hey do you get it now?
Peasants can never win against mages



Saito:
Out of the way

道のoutta

Guiche:
Oh 
Guess I must've gone too easy on you



Saito:
I was just caught off guard cause it was so sudden

私はただガード原因を突かれましたそれはとても急だった

Louise:
Why did you get back up?
Idiot!



Saito:
Because he bugs me

彼は私をバグので

Louise:
Huh?

えっ？

Saito:
Mages
Nobility
Peasants
Servants
Whatever it is you guys act like snobs because of it



Louise:
What nonsense are you talking about?

何ナンセンスについてお話している？

Guiche:
Look I would feel bad about breaking something Louise owns
So I would forgive you if you apologize now



Saito:
Not gonna happen
That hardly hurt at all
Your little doll is way too weak



Guiche:
Is that so?

それはそうでしょうか？

Osmond:
This is a familiar's rune that exists only in legend
Furthermore, it was the third girl from the Valiere family that summoned him
I'd venture to say this has something to do with the lost corner of the pentagon



Colbert:
It can't be

ありえない

Osmond:
Whatever the matter of the truth is
You can't speak a word about this to anyone



Colbert:
Yes I
I understand



Louise:
Why are you getting up again?

なぜあなたは再び立ち上がっていますか？

Kirche:
Look he's getting up again

彼は再び起床の外観

Tabatha:
Alright I'm going

私は行くよ大丈夫

Kerche:
But this is where it starts to get interesting

それを面白くするために開始する場所が、これはです

Louise:
Guiche please stop it already

すでにそれを停止してくださいギーシュ

Guiche:
Leave him Louise
Step aside



Louise:
Come on now that's enough
You did really well ok
I've never seen a peasant like you before



Saito:
It's alright
Get out of the way



Louise:
What did you expect it wasn't going to hurt?
This makes no sense what are you thinking
Why are you doing this?



Saito:
Wait are you crying?

あなたが泣いているのを待つのか？

Louise:
No way I'm crying!

私が泣いているまさか！

Saito:
Hey that hurt!
What did you do that for?



Guiche:
Do you still want to go on with the duel peasant?
If you have the will to go on then just pick up that sword
But if you don't then all you have to do is tell me
That you're very sorry



Louise:
Stop this Guiche!

このギーシュを停止！

Saito:
Not on your life

ないあなたの人生に

Louise:
No don't!
You can't!
If you pick this up Guiche won't show you any mercy!
Listen I am your master and I order you not to fight Guiche!



Saito:
I can't go back to the world where I came from
Which means I have to live here right?



Louise:
Yeah so what?

うんだから何？

Saito:
I don't mind sleeping on the floor
I don't care if my meals taste awful
Because I can't do anything about it
But if I don't want to bow down to someone
I won't!



Louise:
Idiot!

馬鹿！

Saito:
The pain?

痛み？

Louise:
What's going on here?

ここで何が起こっているの？

Saito:
I don't know
But what I do know is that I feel like I can afford to keep fighting a bit longer



Guiche:
I...I give up
But nobility can't lose to a peasant



Saito:
Huh?
But how?



Louise:
Are you alright?

けがはないか？

Saito:
Yeah
There really was nothing to it



Louise:
Hey what's wrong?
He's asleep
Get off me!
You're really heavy you know
Come on get off me!
Get off!



Siesta:
Oh good you're awake
I'm so glad
You've been sleeping there for three whole days and nights now



Saito:
Thanks a lot
But why are you here?



Siesta:
I'm bringing you your meal
Miss Valiere said I should get it and bring it up to you
She's quite exhausted
She's been watching over you this whole time without sleep Mr.Saito



Saito:
Who? 
Louise did?
She's so cute when she's like this
What a waste



Siesta:
What?

何？

Saito:
Oh nothing
Its nothing at all




Why do you have such a damn dazed look on your face!?!
