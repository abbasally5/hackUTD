Saito:
 So cold
 Why'd she make me do this now?



Louise:
 This is silk you know
 You have to be especially gentle and careful when you wash it
 Go and do it again



Saito:
 This is ridiculous
 They're stockings
 What's the big deal?
 Ahh!



Siesta:
 Oh I'm so sorry
 I didn't mean to startle you



Saito:
 Sorry
 I didn't realize it was you



Siesta:
 Yes

はい

Siesta:
 Alright
 You always want to make sure you dry silk in the shade
 Here



Saito:
 You're a lifesaver
 Before I came here I never had to wash anything by hand ever



Siesta:
 That reminds me Mr.Saito
 I've been wondering
 Where did you originally come from?



Saito:
 Let's see
 How do I put it?
 Let's just say somewhere far away
 Very far



Siesta:
 Um...Mr.Saito?
 Thank you so very much



Saito:
 Why are you thanking me?

なぜあなたは私に感謝していますか？

Siesta:
 You never give up no matter what happens
 And you're willing to stand up against the nobility
 Seeing you like that Mr.Saito has given me a lot of courage
 I can continue to do my best because of you Mr.Saito



Saito:
 That's very nice of you

それは非常にあなた優しいのね

Siesta:
 Goodnight Mr.Saito

おやすみMr.Saito

Saito:
 Yeah
 Well
 Goodnight



Saito:
 She seemed to be acting a little funny tonight
 Ahh!
 Oh hey it's late and I have to get up early
 See ya



Kirche:
 Hey
 You know that sword I bought the other day?



Saito:
 You mean that big, huge, shiny one?

あなたはその大きな、巨大な、光沢のあるものを意味ですか？

Kirche:
 I don't need it
 And since I bought it I can't return it
 I might as well give it to you



Saito:
 For free?
 You're serious?



Kirche:
 Well of course
 Let's go talk about it inside



Saito:
 Well if all we're gonna do is talk

私たちがやるつもりだすべては話ですまあ場合

Saito:
 Wow
 This sword is great
 It makes you feel like a real hero
 When you carry something like this



Kirche:
 You don't have to be so modest

あなたはとても控えめである必要はありません

Saito:
 Yeah but Louise-

うんしかしルイーズ-

Kirche:
 Don't worry about Valiere
 This gift is a sign of my passionate love



Saito:
 Hey
 Ok if I ask you something?



Kirche:
 What is it?

何それ？

Saito:
 Why are you coming on to me?
 You have hoards of men to pick from



Kirche:
 Oh Saito
 You have lots of things that none of them have
 You can't make a comparison



Saito:
 Yeah?
 Really?
 Like what?



Kirche:
 Well...
 Your speech and mannerisms indicate a illbred childhood
 And your shabby appearance
 The slight billing of uncleanliness



Saito:
 See ya

屋を参照してください。

Kirche:
 Oh no wait!
 Was there something I said that upset you?



Saito:
 Everything

すべてのもの

Kirche:
 Stop!
 Wait!
 Hold on!
 Here Saito!
 How about this?



Saito:
 What is that?

それは何ですか？

Kirche:
 It's a talisman ring
 It's very valuable



Saito:
 I don't want it

私はそれを望んでいない

Kirche:
 Well then how about this?
 A fire eater blood bird earring?



Saito:
 Don't want it

それをしたくない

Kirche:
 Ok
 How's this?
 This book is an old family heirloom



Saito:
 Thanks but
 I'm not comfortable taking gifts from you
 Sorry but it's better this way



Kirche:
 I won't let you leave

私は、あなたが残しせません

Saito:
 Please
 Let go



Kirche:
 The Von Zerbst blood
 The blood of the hunter of love is getting excited



Saito:
 The hunter of love?

愛のハンター？

Kirche:
 Targets that are harder to obtain turn me on the most

取得するために困難なターゲットは、ほとんど私を回す

Saito:
 Louise!

ルイーズ！

Kirche:
 You always manage to show up

あなたは、常に表示されるまで管理

Louise:
 We're going home dog!

私たちは、家庭犬をつもりだ！

Saito:
 Coming!

来る！


Louise:
 I warned you about her
 And yet you stupidly went out and accepted another of her offers



Saito:
 Yeah well
 You see
 Kirche offered to give me that shiny gold sword for free



Louise:
 You were the one that said that you were alright with the one I bought for you

あなたは私はあなたのために買ったもので大丈夫だったと言っていた1

Saito:
 Yeah I know I did
 But if I could get the other one for free then-



Derflinger:
 Aww come on
 An ornament like that means absolutely nothing to you



Louise:
 A familiar that follows someone that they shouldn't
 After being expressly forbidden to do so
 Needs to be punished again



Saito:
 Huh?
 Come on no!
 Anything but that!



Louise:
 Stupid dog!

愚かな犬！


Louise:
 From today on you can wait outside with all the other familiars

今日からあなたは、他のすべての使い魔と一緒に外を待つことができる

Saito:
 Why?

なぜですか？

Louise:
 Let's see you snore, peek up other girl's skirts, and who knows
 What other disgusting things
 I'm not gonna allow you to embarrass me anymore
 So you stay put until my class is over
 You got that!



Saito:
 Yeah

うん

Saito:
 Come on
 Stop it
Would you back off?
 This is nuts
 Ahh!



Saito:
 Man I can't stay in a place like that

男は私はそのような場所に滞在することはできません

Marteaux:
Hey if it isn't our sword
Please our sword swing by the kitchen later



Saito:
 Sure
 Thanks




Saito:
 Thanks a lot Marteaux
 These meals are better than I deserve



Marteaux:
You don't need to be modest
These are all leftovers from the nobility's meals



Saito:
 Hey where is Siesta?
 Oh that's right I forgot
 She's not in charge of making the meals
 So she's not always hanging around here like you



Marteaux:
You mean
You haven't heard anything about Siesta?



Saito:
 So she's not working here anymore?

そこで彼女はもうここで働いていないのですか？

Marteaux:
Yeah
It was decided that she'd be working with a nobleman named Count Mont
She was picked up and taken away in a carriage early this morning

うん
それは、彼女がカウントモンという貴族と仕事ができるだろうことが決定された
彼女は拾ったと今朝早く馬車に連れ去られた


Saito:
 You're lying
 Why so suddenly?



Marteaux:
In the end
Peasants can do nothing but obey the orders of nobility
Hey!
Get back to work!



Saito:
 Siesta...
 Why didn't you tell me?



Louise:
 Count Mont is the palace messenger
 And comes by the institute from time to time
 I don't like him because he always acts so cocky



Saito:
 But why would Siesta be sent to work for someone so high up in society?

しかし、なぜシエスタは、社会の中で最高に高い誰かのために働くために送られるだろう？

Derflinger:
 When a nobleman specifically asks for a young girl by name
 It's usually in order for her to become his mistress
 I don't believe this don't you know anything?



Saito:
 His mistress?
 Wait a minute
 Is that for real?



Louise:
 I've heard a lot of stories like that
 Involving many of the nobility



Saito:
 Siesta...

シエスタ...

Montmorency:
 How wonderful a broach
 I love it



Guiche:
 It would look wonderful on you
 Don't you think so?



Montmorency:
 You intend on pretending that nothing ever happened between us

あなたは、その何もないふりのつもりが今まで私たちの間に起こった

Guiche:
 It can't be that you beleive what that rude familiar said to you
 Can it?



Saito:
 I'm sorry that I was rude to you

私はあなたに失礼だったことごめんなさい

Guiche:
 Saito!
 Are you going to get in the way of my romantic life again?



Saito:
 No
 I want to ask you something



Guiche:
 Huh?

えっ？

Louise:
 He's not back for dinner either?

彼はどちらかの夕食のために戻っていないのですか？

Kirche:
 Aww
 Where's Saito?



Louise:
 Huh?
 What's that?



Kirche:
 Oh nothing much
 I feel sorry for him having to eat crude meals all the time
 So I thought about giving him a bit of my food



Louise:
 So you're trying to capture his heart by bribing him?
 Don't feed someone else's familiar without permission



Kirche:
 Yeah well he's not here
 Where did he go?



Louise:
 Hmm...
 He went to go wash some dust cloths and still hasn't come back
 I don't know where he is



Guiche:
 By the way
 Earlier today he asked me about the directions to Count Mont's manor



Louise:
 He went to see Count Mont?

彼はカウントモンを見に行きました？

Kirche:
 Maybe he got fed up with you Louise
 And decided he needed a change
 But I can't say I've ever heard of a familiar switching masters before



Guiche:
 But this is Louise's familiar

しかし、これはルイーズの精通している

Kirche:
 Well
 You have a point there



Guiche:
 Though I can't possibly imagine Count Mont, someone who works in the palace
 To be using someone like him



Kirche:
 Louise?

ルイーズ？

Saito:
 This is it
 Damn that Guiche
 He didn't tell me Mont's house was a four hour walk from school



Guard:
Who goes there?

誰がそこに行く？

Saito:
 Hello there

そこにこんにちは

Count Maht:
How was the work?
Have you gotten used to it



Siesta:
 Yes
 For the most part



Count Maht:
 I see
 I see
 Well don't overexert yourself too much




Siesta:
 Yes sir

押忍

Count Maht:
 My dear I'm sure you must realize by now
 That I didn't hire you to merely perform household chores
 My Siesta


私の愛する私は、あなたが今で実現する必要があります確信している
私は、あなたが単に家事を行うために雇っていないこと
私のシエスタ

Siesta:
 Sir
 Sir please



Count Maht:
What is it?

何それ？

Guard:
Someone named Saito is assisted on seeing you right away

斎藤名前誰かはすぐにお会いに支援される

Count Maht:
Saito?
That's a new name



Siesta:
 Could it be?

それだろうか？


Count Mont:
I wonder what it could be
But it's meaningless
Go home
You should be thankful that I went out of my way just to waste time
With a ridiculous peasant

私はそれが何ができるか疑問に思う
しかし、それは無意味だ
家に帰る
あなたは、私はただ時間を無駄にする私の方法から出て行ったことを感謝すべき
ばかげた農民と

Saito:
 Count Mont wait
 If you could let Siesta come back to the institute
 I'll do anything



Count Mont:
Oh?
And what kind of relationship do you have with Siesta?



Saito:
 Well I guess you could say we're coworkers that work in the same place
 Though we work in different departments



Count Mont:
Hmph
A mere servant



Saito:
 Um...well sir
 I heard that when a nobleman requests someone by name
 Its usually her job to be something like a mistress
 For his personal enjoyment



Count Mont:
Ha!
Siesta is an official servant for the Mont household now
The master is free to do whatever he wishes to his servants

ハ！
シエスタは今モンの世帯のための公式の使用人である
マスターは彼が彼の使用人に望むものは何でもして自由である

Saito:
 Just as I thought

私が思ったのと同じように

Count Mont:
I really don't know what you're getting upset about
A nameless peasant like you providing services to a nobleman like me
There's no greater honor

私は本当にあなたが憤慨ばかりしているのかわからない
あなたは私のような貴族にサービスを提供するような無名の農民
何より名誉はありません

Saito:
 Don't mock me!
 You're just doing whatever pleases you because you know Siesta can't refuse!
 That's unfair you baboon!



Count Mont:
You a mere peasant insulting a nobleman like me
Sit down right there!



Siesta:
 Stop it Mr.Saito!

それMr.Saitoを停止！

Saito:
 Siesta
 You heard that?



Siesta:
 Count please forgive this individual's rudeness
 He doesn't mean it



Count Mont:
 I will not have it
 If I were to leave such a peasant's rudeness unanswered
 I will sully and tarnish the name of Jour de Mont
 Stand aside


私はそれを持っていないでしょう
私はそのような農民の無礼は、未回答のままにした場合
私は、ジュール·ド·モンの名前を汚すと変色します
傍観する

Siesta:
 No

ノー

Count Mont:
 What?

何？

Siesta:
 Count Mont I beg of you
 I will accept any punishment you wish to impose
 Just please, please don't hurt him



Saito:
 Siesta out of the way!

道のシエスタ外！

Count Mont:
 Saito
 Or whatever your name is
 You said that you would do anything?
 Did you mean that?



Saito:
 Yeah I did

うん、私したよ

Count Mont:
 My hobby is to collect printed matter
 Actually there is a book that I cannot cease to desire



Saito:
 What kind of book is it?

それは本のどんなですか。

Count Mont:
 A very special book that a certain mage coincidentally summoned during a magic retirement a long time ago
 I heard it's a family heirloom of a very established family in Germania
 The daughter of that family is currently in that institute

特定のメイジが偶然昔魔法退職時に召喚することが非常に特別な本
私はそれはゲルマニアで非常に確立された家族の家宝だと聞い
その家族の娘は、その機関に現在ある

Saito:
 Germania?
 I think I've heard of that place before



Count Mont:
 I'm not certain that you a peasant know of her
 But it is the daughter of the Zerbst family



Saito:
 The Zerbst family?

ツェルプスト家族？

Count Mont:
If you want Siesta back
You must bring me the Zerbst family heirloom



Saito:
 Kirche of all people
 Huh?
 Louise?



Louise:
 What in the world were you thinking back there?

あなたが戻ってそこの世界で何を考えていた？

Saito:
 What?

何？

Louise:
 Forget it
 Just get on and let's get out of here



Louise:
 You're dealing with one of the higher ups of the palace
 You can't begin to make a comparison with him and Guiche



Saito:
 Don't you feel the least bit sorry for Siesta?

あなたはシエスタのために申し訳ありませんが、少なくともビットを感じませんか？

Louise:
 Of course I take pity in her situation
 But there's really nothing you can do about it



Saito:
 You can't just brush this off!

あなたはただ、このオフを磨くことができません！

Louise:
 Don't scream right behind me!

私の後ろに右悲鳴をしないでください！

Saito:
 Yeah, yeah, yeah

ええ、ええ、ええ

Louise:
 Anyway
 You're just gonna have to give up on Siesta
 You got that?



Saito:
 Yeah right I got that

うん、右の私が持っている

Louise:
 Then hurry up and go to sleep

その後、急いでスリープ状態に入る

Saito:
 Ok
 Good she's asleep
 Now I can get to work



Kirche:
 My family heirloom?
 Oh that?
 I'm not like Tabitha
 Books don't interest me
 I've never even opened it



Saito:
 Wait you mean you brought it here from home?

あなたは自宅からここでそれを持って来た意味待つのか？

Kirche:
 They said it's a tool I need for my wedding

彼らはそれが私が私の結婚式のために必要なツールだと述べている

Saito:
 A tool for your wedding?

あなたの結婚式のためのツール？

Kirche:
 I heard that it has the effect of stimulating men's desires

私はそれは刺激的な男性の欲望の効果を持っていることを聞いた

Saito:
 No wonder that baboon wants it so bad

ヒヒは、それがそんなに悪いことを望んでいるのも不思議でない

Kirche:
 In any case I don't think I need something like that
 Do you Saito?



Saito:
 Well...no

うーん...ない

Kirche:
 Then I wouldn't mind giving this to you

その後、私はあなたにこれを与えること気にしないだろう

Saito:
 Really?

本当に？

Kirche:
 In return I get to take you out
 So is it a deal?



Saito:
 Hey!
 All of you nobility are damn rotten people!



Kirche:
 Saito!
 What's he so upset about?



Saito:
 Come on do it!

それを行う上で是非！


Guy:
Miss Siesta?

ミスシエスタ？

Siesta:
 Yes?

はい？

Guy:
The count is waiting in the bed chambers
Please hurry



Siesta:
 Yes
 Mr.Saito



Kirche:
 Hey wake up

ちょっと目を覚ます

Louise:
 What are you doing?
 Stupid dog
 Kirche?
 Wait what are you doing in my bedchamber?



Kirche:
 There's no time for big explanations Valiere
 Its your little familiar



Louise:
 Huh?
 Why do these things keep happening one after another?



Kiche:
 That's one of the most charming things about Saito

それは斎藤についての最も魅力的なものの一つだ

Louise:
 That's easy for you to say
 You're not the one who has to take care of a familiar like him!



Tabatha:
 A nobility's mansion

貴族の邸宅

Kirche and Louise:
 Huh?

えっ？

Tabatha:
 If a peasant were to draw a sword

農民は剣を描画するとしたら

Derflinger:
 Oh brother!
 It was a pretty short relationship with this partner
 Even for me



Saito:
 There's gotta be someway I can get in there

someway、私はそこに得ることができることがあり得ている

Guard:
 Who's there?
 Wait you're...



Saito:
 Thanks for everything earlier today

以前の今日のすべてのためにありがとうございます

Saito:
 Come on!
 Let go!



Count Mont:
 You can let him go

あなたは彼を手放すことができます

Saito:
 Man that hurt

傷つけることをマン

Count Mont:
 What were you planning to do?
 Carrying such a thing on your back



Saito:
 The roads are dangerous at night

道路は夜に危険です

Count Mont:
 No nobility is simply whimsical enough to hand over
 A treasure to a mere peasant
 I wanted to enjoy whether or not you would struggle with it
 But you gave up much too quickly
 How boring

いいえ貴族は引き渡しに十分単に気まぐれではありません
単なる農民の宝
私はあなたがそれで苦労したいかどうかを楽しみたいと思った
しかし、あなたはあまりにも速く多くをあきらめた
なんてつまらない

Saito:
 I didn't give up
 I'm going to resuce Siesta!



Count Mont:
 Ahh you drew

あああなたは描いた

Kirche:
 If he draws a sword at a nobleman's mansion
 The peasant can't complain if he gets executed on the spot



Louise:
 I know that 

私が知っている

Kirche:
 But that's not the end of it
 You'll be held responsible too



Louise:
 I know

私は知っている

Kirche:
 Tabatha please hurry

タバサは、お急ぎください

Tabatha:
 We're landing at the mansion right now

我々は今、大邸宅に着陸している

Count Mont:
 I've never seen a peasant show such foolishness as you have today

あなたが今日持っているように私は農民のショーのような愚かさを見たことがない

Saito:
 So I've been told!
 Something's wrong
 When I was fighting Guiche



Count Mont:
 You should know that my codename is Mont the Surge
 I am a triangle class mage



Saito:
 Oh yeah?
 Well so what!
 My body is shaking
 Damnit!
 What?
 Ahh!



Count Mont:
 I can also do this

私もこれを行うことができます

Saito:
 Oh no!

ああ、いや！

Louise:
 Saito!

斎藤！

Count Mont:
 What?

何？

Saito:
 Louise?

ルイーズ？

Count Mont:
 The level of conduct of the institute's pupils has fallen
 I will demand that old Osmond be reprimanded for this



Louise:
 I apologize for entering without permission
 As the situation required me to act swiftly
 Also misconduct of a familiar is considered to be misconduct of his master as well
 And that would be me
 I am willing to accept any form of punishment



Saito:
 Louise no

ルイーズなし

Count Mont:
Pointing a sword at an official of the palace
Is a serious crime of the first degree
Be prepared to have your entire family face the consequences

宮殿の公式で剣をポインティング
最初の学位の重大な犯罪です
あなたの全体の家族の顔な結果をもたらすために準備され

Saito:
 Hold on
 I'm the one at fault



Kirche:
 Pardon me Count Mont
 How about we make a little deal



Count Mont:
 What are you doing there?

あなたはそこに何をしているの？

Kirche:
 I hear you have a tremendous desire to posses this
 Pardon my belated introduction your excellency
 My name is Kirche Von Zerbst



Count Mont:
 You're a Zerbst?
 Then that is...



Kirche:
 Our family heirloom
 The treasure summon book
 Here



Count Mont:
 The famed book is finally in my hands

有名な本は、私の手の中に最終的に

Louise:
 Kirche...
 Are you sure about this?



Kirche:
 I peeked inside and I don't need anything of that sort

私は内部覗くと、私はその種の何を必要としない

Tabatha:
 Unecessary

不要

Saito:
 Hey!
 You said you'd give Siesta back!



Count Mont:
 Hand Siesta over to them

彼らに引き渡すシエスタ

Guards:
 Right!

右！

Count Mont:
 It opened
 I don't know the language these letters are in
 But to think there was such a theme's world

それは開かれた
私は、これらの文字がしている言語を知らない
しかし、このようなテーマの世界があったと考える

Saito:
 What?
 It's an old Japanese porn magazine



Louise:
 A what?

何？

Saito:
 Hey you said earlier that the book came from a summoned one

ねえ、あなたは、本が召喚1から来たことを以前に述べた

Kirche:
 That's right
 A long time ago my grandpa bought it from a mage who just happened to summon it by mistake



Saito:
 A summoned one...
 That's the same situation as me



Louise:
 So he's the same?

そこで彼は同じだ？

Siesta:
 I mean it
 Thank you so very much



Saito:
 No in the end it was all thanks to Kirche

なし最終的にはキルシェのおかげでした

Siesta:
 Maybe
 But it was all because you did your best Mr.Saito



Saito:
 Well Louise also helped

まあルイーズも助け

Siesta:
 Goodnight Mr.Saito

おやすみMr.Saito

Saito:
 Goodnight Siesta
 You know Louise



Louise:
 We're going back to our room

私たちは、私たちの部屋に戻っている

Saito:
 I wanna thank you
 And tell you I'm sorry



Louise:
 Look just be quiet
 I'm thinking about how heavy a punishment I need to give you right now
 Considering all that you've done



Saito:
 So there is gonna be something

だから、何かになるのよあります

Louise:
 Let's see
 100 lashes with the whip would be too easy on you
 Oh maybe I should just starve you until you're near death



Saito:
 Wait a minute
 Can't you show a tiny bit of mercy?



Louise:
 Impossible

不可能

Saito:
 Forgive me!

私を許して！

Louise:
 Can't
 That's impossible



Saito:
 It can't be!

それはすることはできません！
