  Shion:
Keiichi, are you there? Are you listening?

Keiichi:
Yeah, I'm here.

Shion:
So, have you heard? Is is true?
Has old man, Kimiyoshi really gone missing?

Keiichi:
Huh? Kimiyoshi?
Do you mean the village leader?
Well, that's what everybody seems to be saying.

Shion:
Keiichi, I'm scared.
What should I do?
I spoke to him yesterday and told him everything that's happened.
This is all my fault.

Keiichi:
No, it's not!
You don't have anything to do with this.

Shion:
You're wrong.
It's totally my fault.
Right after I told him, he disappeared.
He disappeared that very same night.
I told him everything and now he's dead.
He's dead, Keiichi. It's all my fault.
First it killed everyone I care about and sit and watch me suffer.
Next, next it's gonna come after us.
That's the plan, Keiichi.
Ah, I love it. That's a great idea.
And that's just brutal enough to work.

Keiichi:
But, Rika...
I told Rika everything, too.
---
Rena:
Rika, Satoko, you home?
Rika, Satoko.
They locked it up.

Keiichi:
But what about upstairs?
Maybe the windows up there are open.

Shion:
Look! I found a ladder.

Rena:
I'll go check the main house and see if they are there.

Keiichi:
Main house?

Shion:
It's the Furude family's main residence.
But from what I understand, no one's gone in there since Rika's parents died.

Keiichi:
Oh yeah, I've forgotten about Rika's parents.

Shion:
Satoko's too.
The reason her parents fell off that cliff and her brother, Sathoshi went missing is all just the result of the Oyashiro's curse.
And so that's why Rika and Satoko decided to move in together.
That's right.
Rika and Stoko are best friends.
That has to be why Satoko has never been cursed.
Rika Furude must have the power to protect her.
That totally makes sense.

Keiichi:
Man, that's gotta be hard on them.

Shion:
That girl is cursed.
I said that girl is cursed.

Keiichi:
Mion?

Shion:
Satoko Hojo is a cursed little girl who's been stained by Oyashiro's curse.
Why is Satoko the only one from her family whos's forgiven when anyone else in the Hojo
was marked for death.
Why is she absolved?
Unforgivable! Unforgivable! Unforgivable! Unforgivable!

Keiichi:
Hey c'mon. Calm down, Mion.

Shion:
Unforgivable! Unforgivable! Unforgivable!

Rena:
Mion. Keiichi.
One of the neighbors has the key.

Shion:
Calm down.
Rika Furude is dead now.
The reincarnation of Oyashiro is dead.

Keiichi:
Huh?

Shion:
Oh, saved by Rena.
Right, Keiichi?

There's no one left any more to order to curse.
No one... except me.
Perfect.

Oishi?:
So any look?

Villager A:
No, but we haven’t looked that area.

Villager B:
Really?

Villager C:
Oh, C'mon. Let's go!
Hold on!

Villager D:
Mion!
We looked around the swamp but we still didn't find anything.

Villager E:
We're not gonna have any look until the sun comes up.

Shion:
All right. Well,thanks for trying.
I think some of the wives have a big pot of stew going on in the assembly room.
You should stop by and get some.

Villager D:
Hey, just out of curiosity.
Who was the first to realize that Rika had gone missing?

Shion:
Uh, it was Keiichi.
He said he had got a feeling about it.

Villager D:
Like he just sensed it?

Villager E:
Oh, that's a little suspicious.

Shion:
I make one little statement and now Keiichi is the main suspect.
How perfect is that?

Oishi:
Well, well, well..., something smells good.
Is that a pot of stew I smell?
I'm definitely gonna have to get me some of that before I head back.

Shion:
Oishi already had his eye on me.
Now he is out here trying to dig something else up.
Huh, so what?

Satoko:
You murderer!

Shion:
I'm guessing Kimiyoshi is dead now.
Oh, now I get it. You just watched him die.

Satoko:
How could you do this to everyone... To Rika...

All right, tell me!
What are you planning to do to me?

Shion:
Kill you...

Mion:
No, stop!
Please just leave Satoko alone!

Shion:
You wanna save her?
You didn't seem willing to do that when it came to Satoshi.
And that is your sin.

Mion:
Please just forgive her!
Whatever she did, forgive her.
Do what you want with me.

Shion:
I was begging just like you not too long ago.
You can plead for her 'til your throat is run, still won't save her.
You just have to sit there and watch your friend suffer.

Mion:
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

Shion:
Okay, how about this then?
Tell me that you are sorry one thousand times.
Do that, [now] I'll gladly let Satoko go.

Mion:
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.....

Shion:
You've pretty much mastered the art of crying haven't you.
You really think if you cry long enough for your nii-nii is going to save you.

Satoko, can you hear me?
I'm talking to you!
Do you know why you are here, what your sin is?
Are you aware it was you who made Satoshi feel trapped.

Satoko:
Nii-nii...Nii-nii...

Shion:
That's right.
All you ever had to do is cry for your brother to come and help.
One little cry and Satoshi would come running.

But did you ever think of the burden you have placed on him?
Satishi isn't your knight in shining armor who always be there nor he is invincible.
He is just like you.

What's the matter?
Has your right arm finally gotten numb?
Then let's switch to the left arm.

Oh, that's no fun.
Are you trying to hold back the tears 'cause you think hearing you cry and scream are the very things that egg me on?

Satoko:
You know, I thought the same thing you did.

Shion:
Huh?


Satoko:
I thought it was me making feel him trapped and that caused him to disappear.
I only [thought] me.
And even though I knew Nii-nii was struggling too, I still couldn't stop myself.
I kept clinging on.

Shion:
Oh, that was unexpected.
So you know what you've done.

Satoko:
But I know he's gonna come back.
And when he does, I'm gonna show him that I can take care of myself now,
That I don't need to hide behind his back anymore,
That no matter what I'm going through I can handle it.

Shion:
He's coming back, is he?

Satoko:
He is gonna come back!
I know he will.
And I'm gonna be here when he does.
I'm gonna be here and apologize for leaning on him as much as I did.
And until he's back I won't give up.
I'm gonna be strong.
No matter how much it hurts.
I've leaned my lesson now.
Crying doesn't change anything, so I'm not gonna do it.

Shion:
Really? Well, that's pretty tough talk, for a girl like you.

Satoko:
I mean it!
If you wanna stab me, go ahead! Stab me!
But no matter how much you hurt me, no matter how much you try to make me cry, I won't do it.
Nii-nii, I hope you are watching. I hope you can see how much stronger I am now.
And no matter what happens I'm not gonna give up. Not to her.
Someone who is pathetic as she is could never make me cry.

Shion:
Satoshi, where are you?
I've been waiting for you, I've been waiting for you ever since the last time we spoke.

Satoshi:
I'm leaving Satoko up to you, Mion, okay?

Shion:
What have I done?
I've forgotten the last and only thing Satoshi ever asked of me.
Satoshi will never come back to me after what I've done.
Never! He's never coming back.
Why do I care? I've known for a long time now that the demon inside me is all that's left.





Shion:
Keiichi and Rena finally figured out that I was the one behind all the recent disappearances.
And so the next day, the two of them came to the Sonozaki house to call me on it.

I never would have thought you two would be such amazing detectives.
You managed to figure out how everything transpired just by looking inside their refrigerator.

Keiichi:
Mion...
The police already suspect that you might have something to do with this.
I'm serious.
Oishi's out side there right now just waiting for any opportunities to break in here.

Shion:
There's no excuse for what I've done.
I'm sorry.
There's a demon within me.

Rena:
Turn yourself in. 
We'll go with you so you don't get hurt. 
You still are our friend no matter what.


Shion:
I know it's selfish. But I'd like you to indulge me in one last wish.
I'll do it. 
I'll turn myself in.
But first I'd like to have some alone time with Keiichi.

Do you think it'd be all right if I held your arm?

Keiichi:
Yeah, I guess that'd be okay.

Shion:
Seems Shion liked you just as much as I did.

Keiichi:
Oh, really?

Shion:
I had come to a point where I could no longer tell whether I was Shion or Mion anymore.
Only one word loomed in my mind, "demon."
C'mon, if you are up to it, I can show you all my crimes.
But I should warn you they are rather gruesome.
And there's not much you can do about it.
For the most part what's done was done.

Keiichi:
I don't care.
Show me whatever you want.
It won't change the fact that Mion Sonozaki is still the best friend I've ever had. 

Shion:
Freak.
Why'd he do that.
That was so lame.
Now that the demon has fully possessed me, I can't really relate to this people anymore.
But maybe somehow I can see what she saw in you.


Mion:
Keiichi...
Keiichi:
Shion, is that you?

Mion:
Keiichi! Keiichi! Keiichi....

Keiichi:
I don't believe it.
You're still alive!

Mion:
No! No!

Keiichi:
It's gonna be okay, Shion.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

Shion:
Nice. You're awake.
When I've done here after I've exposed her to dying screams of all her friends, she'll be next.
Genious, isn't it?

Keiichi:
Who exactly are you?

Shion:
I'm Mion Sonozaki.
Who else what I would be?

Keiichi:
You can't possibly be Mion.

Shion:
Does he know that I'm Shion?
Has he figured it out?

Keiichi:
You are a demon.
You are not Mion.
Give her back!
I mean it!
Give her back!
I want my best friend, Mion back, damn it!
Don't give up, Mion!
Don't let this demon beat you!
C'mon, fight it.
Don't give in.
You're stronger than this!

Shion:
You are funny one.
Keep this up and I may drown in my own tears.

Keiichi:
Please Mion, I beg you.
Don't do it!
Dont't let this demon take you.
You can beat this!
I know you can, please! Fight!

Shion:
Keiichi, since you so disparately wanna know, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
See this demon has been living within my body for quite some time now.
But I have always managed to control it just by reasoning with it.
So much so that I thought it had gone.
It's been a long time since it's last [xxx] [looking/within] me.
But it is in fact still there.
It seems all I needed was something significant to wake it up again.
You know, when I think about it, the incident that started was actually rather innocent.
But then you came along, Keiichi and screwed everything up.

Mion:
But Keiichi didn't give it to me.

Shion:
Mion cried and confessed her feelings that day.
And as she spoke, I started to remember my feelings for Satoshi.
All you had to do was give that doll to Mion instead.
And just maybe we wouldn’t be where we are now.
That's not the path you chose.

Keiichi:
But I didn't know.

Shion:
Interesting.
I didn't hesitate when I was torturing everyone else.

Keiichi:
If torturing me may be able to appease the demon inside you, go ahead, hammer away.

Shion:
Serious?

Keiichi:
Yeah, I'm serious.
Compared to the pain Mion's had to go through, this isn't anything, is it?
You just have to promise me two things. 
First, forgive Shion.


And secondly, I want you to leave that body and give it back to Mion.
Forever.

Shion:
I don't believe it. 
With all I'm about to do to you, you don't even ask me to spare your life?

Keiichi:
All right then, there's the third thing. 
Please don't kill me.

Mion:
You asked for two at first. 
Don't get greedy. 
I'll give you those two and no more.

Keiichi:
Well, I guess that's my loss.

Shion:
But I'm a demon, so the chance I'll keep my promise is pretty slim. 
However, I don't mind granting that third request of yours. 
It's too late for you to try and save Mion.
She's a lost cause now.

Keiichi:
It's never too late.
Mion is still in there!
If she wants to come back, she can still do it!

Shion:
Listen! Do you hear that?
I bet it's Oishi.
Rena probably called him in when we didn't come back. 
I'm sorry for defiling Mion.

Keiichi:
Do what you want.
But Mion I'm always gonna remember is Mion who was my friend.

Shion:
You need to forget about her. 
If you ever see me after today, the last thing you should do is approach me. 
The only thing that's going to be alive within me by then will be the demon.

Come on out. Keiichi isn't dead.
He is just unconscious.
I hit him with a taser.
The police will be here in a matter of minutes.

Mion:
Thanks a lot, sis.

Shion:
But you and I aren't finished yet.
And I still need to escape.

Hurry up!

Mion:
I'm coming.

Shion:
I want you to go down there, and apologize to Satoshi.

Mion:
Shion! There's no point me going down there.
Satoshi isn't there!

Shion:
What are you talking about?
You told me yourself that he was dumped into this hole.

Mion:
I lied. I really like Satoshi, too!
So I confronted Grandma and that begged not to hurt him.
I was even prepared to kill him with my own hands and I had to.
But then she told me that the Sonozaki family has nothing to do with the curse.

Shion:
Liar!

Mion:
I think she was telling the truth, Shion.
I can tell by looking at her.
And besides she's already blessed your relationship with Satioshi.
She told everyone it was okay.
Since you tore out your finger nails, she said she was willing to forgive and forget everything.

Shion:
Liar! Liar!
If she didn't kill Satoshi, then who did?

Mion:
I have no idea.

Shion:
You lying!
Look at what each of these deaths all have in common.
Each one of these people has marked by the Sonozaki family.

Mion:
I know it's weird.
Grandma thought the same thing, too.
But when she asked, everyone denied it.
It' not as simple as you think.
Everyone denied being involved.

Shion:
No. If what you're saying is true, I've been killing innocent people for no reason.
You are good!
So you could get me with the little reverse psychology, did you?

Mion:
Please believe me, Shion.
I am not the one who did this to you.
I promise.

Shion:
Shut up! If you are innocent, then you will be fine.
I hear Heaven's nice place.
Say hello to Satoshi.

Oishi:
It appears that the suspect has fled the scene.
I repeat, it appears that the suspect has fled the scene.

Rena:
Keiichi, can you hear me?
Are you okay?

Mystreious voice:
Die!
Hurry up and die already!
You've been marked, Shion Sonozaki!
You think we'll let you live after what've you done?
You are dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead!

Shion:
Shut up!
You'll never catch me!

Long time no see.
How have you been?

Keiichi:
Mion, are you sure it's OK if you'd be wandering around like this?

Keiichi:
It's pretty late, Mion. 
So why did you come?

Shion:
I've tried, but..., I'm afraid I can't stay here anymore.

Keiichi:
Hey, are you feeling Okay?

Shion:
I tried. I really tried, Keiichi. 
But I can't stop it.

Shion:
Hey. Calm down. 
I'm sure that you can get...

Shion:
Just in time. 
I did it. 
It's all done.
And it was all for you, Satoshi.

I can't believe it.
It's finally over.


I'm sorry, Satoshi.
I didn't do what you asked me to.
Everybody, I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me.
Next time, I won't make the same mistake.
I promise.


What captures you is a lingering memory of the past.
What lures you in is a bogus image of the future.
