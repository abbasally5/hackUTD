  Keiichi:
 Ms.Takano...

Takano:
 .................... bury the body?

Keiichi:
 Huh?

Takano:
 I asked... if you were able to bury the body.



Takano:
 Were you able to bury the body?

Keiichi:
 Ah, what are you talking about?

Takano:
 When you bury a dead body, you have to dig the hole surprisingly deep.
 Otherwise, there's a good chance that a stray dog may trace the smell and dig it up.
 ...Mm, you are really bad at this game.

Keiichi:
 Ha?!

Takano:
 I was just joking.
 We don't really seem to be on the same page tonight, do we, Keiichi?

Keiichi:
 Uh, I guess not.
 Ah, hey that bike, that's Mr.Tomitake's, right?

Takano:
 Whatever would make you think that?

Keiichi:
 Well, when I saw him earlier, he was riding a bike like that.
 And it's not a kind of bike you see every day.

Takano:
 Well, it's my bike.
 But Jiro did pick it out for me.
 So it would only make sense that the bike he chose would be similar to his own I suppose.

Keiichi:
 Yeah, I guess so.

Takano:
 We are here, Keiichi.
 But you and I did not meet tonight.

Keiichi:
 Ah, huh? What are you saying?

Takano:
 I believe what I said was clear.
 We didn't meet tonight.
 You and I never had this little car ride, okay?

Keiichi:
 If that's what you want, then that's fine with me.

Takano:
 Thought so.
 This little lie is probably best for you anyway, right?

Keiichi
 Oh why would you think something like that?

Takano:
 Stop asking questions.
 It's time for you to start thinking for yourself for once, kiddo.


 Good night.
 I hope you sleep well.

Keiichi:
 If she saw me do it, then I should've killed her!
 Damn it!
 I hope Oyashiro's curse find[s] her and kills her!



Keiichi:
 I'm late.



Keiichi:
 She's here.


 Hey there! Morning everyone!

Mion:
 Hahahaha! You're sure riding high today, aren't ya?

Rena:
 He's still excited from the festival last night, last night.

Keiichi:
 Excited from the festival?
 But I didn't go to the festival ye...

Rika:
 Were you there, Keiichi?
 Did you see me perform my dance yesterday?

Rena:
 Yeah, he did. He saw the whole thing.

What [you didn't/ Didn't you] see him there watching you?

Keiichi:
 You guys...

Mion:
 Yeah, he was so focused on Rika's dance.
 He didn't even see the stupid moves Shion put on him.
 It was great.
 She looked like a total loser.

Boys:
Hey, how was the contest you guys had at the shooting gallery.

Rika:
 I can't believe Tomitake got last place out of all of us.
 But we sure it was fun making him play the penalty game, huh?

Mion:
 You know Rika, I thought for sure you were gonna be the one to come in last.
[That/But] then she came through like a true member of our club and got that gum at the very last moment possible.
 It was awesome.

Rena:
 I really wanna say thank you, Keiichi.

Keiichi:
 Ha? For what?

Rena:
 For that great big stuffed toy you got me.
 It makes me so happy.
 I'm gonna put it next to my pillow and sleep with it every night.

Keiichi:
 How did I get the toy?

Rena:
 You got it by shooting at towns, silly?
 You were so cool too.

Keiichi:
 I have no idea what you guys are talking about.
 I was never...!

Teacher:
OK class, time to start the afternoon lesson.
Class leader, will you start us off?

Class leader:
Yep!

Teacher:
......Just think about this for now.
Try to concentrate.

Keiichi:
 Hey, Rena.
 About the festival yesterday.
 Do you happen to remember what time it was that I met up with you guys?

Mion:
 I know.
 You were talking with Rika on the shrine grounds.

Rena:
 Oh, yeah.
 When I saw you, you were having a good time with Rika in her shrine maiden outfit.

Keiichi:
 So I was talking to Rika when you guys saw me.

(Teacher:)
(......think you got it?)

Keiichi:
 How could I have been talking to her?



Rika:
 I was talking with you?

Keiichi:
 Yeah.
 Isn't that right?
 You were talking to me in your shrine maid outfit, when Mion and the other showed up.
 But do you remember when and where that was?

Rika:
 The first time I saw you, was when I came out of the meeting hall with the village leader and everyone else.

Keiichi:
 Ha?

Mion:
 I was totally surprised by it.

Rena:
 And then? And then?

Mion:
 And then, I got it...



Classmates:
See ya!
Bye bye, Ms. Chie!

Keiichi:
 All right!
 What do you guys say we do the club thing today?

Rena:
 Yeah! Let's do it, let's do it!

Keiichi:
 Hey, Satoko.
 Join us for a change.
 Come on, it'll be fun!

Satoko:
 Well, I appreciate you inviting me, but...

Keiichi:
 Ah you haven't joined us [no/now] long time.

Satoko:
 Will you please leave me alone?
 I want to, but...

Keiichi:
 He hasn't come back, has he?
 Has he?

Satoko:
 What are you talking about?
 Who hasn't come back?

Keiichi:
 Well I was talking about your uncle.

Satoko:
 Why would you say something like that, Keiichi?
 What [an/on] earth would ever make you think he might've disappeared?

Keiichi:
 Because I know that he didn't come home last night. Did he?

Satoko:
 Why are you saying something you know nothing about?!
 Stop it!
 You are just being mean to me!

Keiichi:
 Hey Satoko, why are you acting like he stroll around?
 I know for a fact that he... !!!!!! ......that he is...

Satoko:
 Just yesterday.
 He was being really mean to me.
 He yelled, and screamed, and threw the meal I cooked back in my face.
 It was hot, and dirty.
 And he even made me clean up the mess that he made.
 It was aweful, aweful... (crying)

Keiichi:
 There's no way.
 He could've... come back?!

Rika:
 Satoko.

Mion:
 Hey Keiichi.
 Why are you so sure Satoko's uncle didn't come home, huh?

Rena:
 Yeah, why?
 Why would you think he wouldn't come home? come home?

Mion:
 You're sure saying some pretty strange things.

Rena:
 When I get home, I'm going on a tresure hunt.
 I haven't had a good hunting like forever.
 Mion's going to come too.

Mion:
 You're gonna come with us too, Keiichi.
 I'm not taking no for an answer.

Rena:
 We're gonna look for cute things & cute things & cute things!

Keiichi:
 There's no way that he could've...



Rena:
 OK Keiichi, be ready.
 I'll pick you up at your house.
 Be set to go when I get there.

Keiichi:
 Ah, sorry, but I've got something I gotta do.

Rena:
 Oh yeah, like what?

Keiichi:
 Well you see, I... I got this thing to do.

Rena:
 If you had something to do, why didn't you say so in front of Mion a few minutes ago.

Keiichi:
 I'm sorry.
 My head hurts.
 I might be getting a cold.
 So I thoght maybe... I should get a head start on it and go to the clinic to see if they give me some medicine.

Rena:
 Is that true?

Keiichi:
 Yeah.

Rena:
 Well okay.
 If that's the case, go to the clinic now.
 They have a tendency to close early sometimes, so you better get there before it's too late to get your medicine.

Keiichi:
 Thanks for the tip.
 I'll go right now.

Rena:
 You better go to the clinic and nowhere else.

Keiichi:
 I am. I promise you.
 If you want me to, I can bring a receipt tomorrow and prove it to you.

Rena:
 Yeah. I think you should.
 Make sure you don't forget it.
 I wanna make sure that it's real.

Keiichi:
 Ha? Yeah, sure.



Keiichi:
 I threw his bat in the swamp.
 I know I did.
 I remember doing it.
 If I didn't kill him, then the bat will still be here.
 Just like I thought! Gone!

Nurse:
Mr. Maebara. Please come in to the exam room.

Irie:
 Hello there.
 It's the first time that we've met in my office, isn't it?

Keiichi:
 Hey coach, how are you?
 So I guess you really are a doctor, aren't you?
 (Irie laughs)......Sorry.



Irie:
 Hm... Well it doesn't seem like you have a cold.
 Do you think maybe you had too much fun, yesterday's festival?

Keiichi:
 So I'm guessing you went to the festival yesterday too.

Irie:
 Yes, of course.
 Believe it or not, I'm actually a member of the cotton drifting festival's planning committee.

Keiichi:
 Then tell me.
 Did you see me there?

Irie:
 Mm? Well to be honest, I did had quite a few drinks with the chairman and a few of the other members of the committee.

Keiichi:
 Oh, I see.

Irie:
 What makes you ask such a strange question?
 Any reason?

Keiichi:
 Well yeah.
 But if I told you, you would probably think it was weird.
 But I wanna tell you, so... so please don't laugh.

Irie:
 Okay. Go ahead.

Keiichi:
 Is it possible that there's someone out there who looks just like me? I mean exactly like me?

Irie:
 Well whether it's true or not, I have heard people say that everyone has their exact twin out there somewhere in this world.
 There's also a famous german fairy tale about what they call a doppelgänger, a ghost looks just like you.

Keiichi:
 A doppelgänger?

Irie:
 Yep.
 It's supposed to be a sign of misfortune.

Keiichi:
 Ah, you see, I never actually went to the festival yesterday.

Irie:
 Is that so?
 Well the festival will happen again next year, maybe then you...

Keiichi:
 That's not what I'm trying to say!
 I didn't go to the festival yesterday.
 But everyone I talk to says I did and they actually saw me there.
 I don't understand!
 How was that possible?!

Irie:
 So you're trying to say that you [didn't/did] indeed go to the festival yesterday, but for some reason, you have no memory of it?

Keiichi:
 That's not it at all!
 I never even went to the festival.
 I know that for a fact!
 There were something else I had to take care of.

Irie:
 So during the festival, you weren't at the shrine because you were elsewhere taking care of another matter.
 If someone asks you to prove this, could you?

Keiichi:
 Yeah, but...

Irie:
 Perhaps you should lie down for a little bit.
 Take a moment to relax.

Keiichi:
 Listen! I'm telling you I didn't go to that damn festival!
 I'm not making a mistake.
 I know I wasn't there!

Irie:
 Please relax, Keiichi.

Keiichi:
 You're not understanding what I'm saying!

Irie:
 No, I do understand.
 And please trust me Keiichi.
 I really do wanna believe you.

Keiichi:
 There's absolutly no way that I could've been at the festival yesterday.
 Because during the middle of the festival, I was... I was...

 I was killing Satoko's uncle!!

Irie:
 Did you say you... you killed Satoko's uncle?

Keiichi:
 Yeah... I killed him last night.

Irie:
 Why? ......Why would you do something like that?

Keiichi:
 I had to save her.
 And that seemed like the best way to eliminate what was hurting her, so I just took care of it.
 I know I was wrong, but I don't regret it.

Irie:
 I see.

Keiichi:
 So that's why I say there's no way I could've possibly been at the festival yesterday.

Irie:
 Do you think there's any chance that someone could've witnessed the crime?

Keiichi:
 I don't think so.
 I mean if someone would've seen me do it, don't you think I would've been arrested by now?

Irie:
 Well being that I'm a doctor, there's no way I can condone any act that involves taking another's life.
 However, I will say this Keiichi...
 ...Thank you so much.
 Thank you for saving Satoko.
 ...No, don't worry.
 It's all going to work out.

Keiichi:
 Thanks...Thank you.
 It's just so weird.

Irie:
 What do you mean?

Keiichi:
 I know for sure that I killed him, but it seems like he's still alive, and back at his house, too.

Irie:
 Have you considered the possibility that you might've killed someone else?

Keiichi:
 No, there's no way!
 I mean I saw the guy in front of Satoko's house.
 You were there when I saw him.
 That was him, right?

Irie:
 Yes.

Keiichi:
 Then I'm possitive.
 It was him!
 That feeling I had when I hit him with the bat, that impact, that feeling[s] were so real.
 There's no way it could've been a dream.

Irie:
 I think we need to go over this a little more detail, okay?
 Before we do that, let me make you some black tea.
 I need to let the staff go as well.
 It's almost time for us to close.



Staff:
 Okay, some black tea.
 I'll take care of it.

 Irie:
 And adding some isomytals and brovarin, and then mix in a little bit of milk and sugar to mask the taste.

Staff:
You know doctor, there's a chance that this sudden drowsiness might [causing/cause him] to act a bit deranged.

Irie:
 Well, we'll have to restrain [him] if that happens.

Staff:
Very well.

Irie:
 The patient exhibited a tendency to fabricate certain events.
His memories [are just yesterday and/of just yesterday are in] complete disarray.
 It seems like a mental disorder.

Keiichi:
 ......Seriously?

(Irie:)
(Thank you so much for saving Satoko.)

Keiichi:
 This is [that what/the way] you say thank you?
 Bastard.
 Fine then, I hope you die!

Staff:
Doctor, we have a problem!
They found Ms.Takano!

Irie:
 Ms.Takano? Where?

Keiichi:
 It's just a coincidence.
 It has to be a coincidence.
 Whatever, the first thing I have to do is to make sure he's dead.

Staff:
They apparently found her body in the mountains, in the Gifu prefecture, burnt to death.

Keiichi:
 Burnt to death? Ms.Takano?

(Takano:)
 (This little lie is probably best for you anyway, right?)

(Keiichi:)
 (I hope Oyashiro's curse finds her and kills her!)

Irie:
 How did this happen?

Staff:
I don't know the details yet.
But according to the police in that area, there's a very good chance that it's a homicide.

Keiichi:
 I have to know for certain that this guy is here.

Oishi:
 Good evening.

Keiichi:
 What?! Oishi!

Oishi:
 When a child speaks to an adult, I believe it's appropriate to put a mister in front of their name, right?
 Please don't stop on account of us.
 Feel free to keep on digging.
 You can just pretend we are nothing but a few more trees out here tonight.


 Please continue digging.
 And try not to [double] if you could.
 I'd like you to be considered those standing here waiting in the rain, watching.

Keiichi:
 If you don't like standing in the rain, maybe you should find someone else to harass.

Oishi:
 Why don't you try moving your hands instead of your mouth, okay?

Keiichi:
 Fine.

Oishi:
 That's it.
 Good work, son.
 I love it when a kid knows how to be obedient.

Keiichi:
 Come on.
 Gimme a break.
 How much more do I have to dig?

Oishi:
 You know it's such a shame.
 Young people today are so weak.


 Tell me Maebara.
 Is it really your hobby to come dig holes on rainy nights?

Keiichi:
 No one has a hobby like that.
 Come on!

Oishi:
 It's raining cats and dogs tonight.
 I can kick water in your face all night long.
 And no one would know the difference.
 I wonder what kind of treasure can get somebody out in the night like this.
 You mind letting me know that secret?

Keiichi:
 Screw you pig!

 I hope Oyashiro's curse finds you and kills you too!

Oishi:
 Such a rebel, I think this may be an excellent opportunity for me to teach [our lesson to you/you a lesson] too.
 You see the world we're living now is so peaceful.
 When I was your age, it was quite common to make you point by hitting someone, really are.

Man:
Detective Oishi!

Oishi:
 What is it?

Man:
Take a look.

Oishi:
 So, what am I looking at?

Man:
I don't know.
Looks to me like an old drainage pipe.
The ground's pretty hard around here.
I doubt he or anyone else could've dug much deeper.

Oishi:
 Interesting.
 You think we've been digging in the wrong place?

Man:
No. The ground was definitely soft in the beginning like it could've been dug up recently.
But as I started to getting closer to this old drain pipe, harder it's started to get.
I think chances are that we dug deeper [and/than] the hole was originally dug.

Oishi:
 So then, what are you telling me?
 That someone dug a huge hall in the middle of the forest, and then covered it back up without buring anything in it first?
 Hahahahaha, I don't know about you Maebara.
 But I give up on this one.

Keiichi:
 How? How could he not be there?
 There's no way.
 His body has to be......

The sounds of footsteps are whispers from the past.
What you see is just reality in the mist.
What you hear is forgiveness for you.

When They Cry “Curse Killing” Chapter
Episode 5: APOLOGY

Can you believe in this?
