  Keiichi:
haa?

Shion:
I'm actually Shion Sonozaki..I happened to be Mion's twin sister.

Worker:
Good job,guys!

Worker:
Hey Keiichi, you've been working all day. Why don't you take a break?

Keiichi:
Oh, Ok! Man...I'm tired..

Shion:
Keiichi, nice work out there.

Keiichi:
Oh! That's nice of you, thanks a lot, Mio...

Shion:
But I'm Shion~!

Keiichi:
Shion!! I looked like an idiot the other day!!

Shion:
That little misunderstanding was all your fault, Keiichi.

Keiichi:
Yeah, and I still feel like dumbass.

Shion:
Come on, it's not that big of a deal. Think of this barley tea as a peace offering

Mion:
aa!!!!

Mion:
Shion?! What's the deal! Why are you with Keiichi again?!

Shion:
Well, unlike you, I'm a kind of person who's considerate of the others.

Shion:
I couldn't just leave poor sweaty Keiichi alone, could I~?

Shion:
By the way, you wanna tell me why you are toting around two cups of tea, sis

Mion:
Ah! Well, I...uh...

Shion:
So what happened to the tough head strong sister I know in love. Don't tell me you've gone soft on me. I mean there is no way you'd be caught dead serving a cup of tea to a boy.

Mion:
Well... No way, I'm just really thirsty. Figured I pour down two of it is easy.

Shion:
That's my sister, come on!

Shion:
Chug it! Chug it! GO!
 All right, sis. That was awesome. You totally downed them.

Mion:
I don't like you, Shion!
 And I like you even less than I did yesterday.

Tomy:
Hey!

Miyo:
Hello there.

Mion:
It's Mr. Tomitake and Ms. Takano.

Shion:
Good evening.

Tomy :
You must be Keiichi Maebara, the transfer student I've been hearing about.

Tomy:
My name is Tomitake, I'm a freelance photographer visiting all the way from Tokyo.

Mion:
And this is Miss Miyo Takano. She is the new nurse at the clinic.

Miyo:
Pleased to meet you.

Keiichi:
Yeah.

Oishi:
Wow wow, everyone.
 Good evening.

Miyo:
Mr. Oishi.
 Checking the security for the festival?

Oishi:
Well, I guess you can say that, but seriously I don't think anything bad's gonna happen.

Shion:
Oh, of course not! I for one am hoping that no one is going to give you officers any troubles at all this year.

Oishi:
Well, that makes two of us, young lady.

Keiichi:
Is that guy a cop?

Mion:
Uh...Keiichi, I bet you're really hungry?
 You wanna go with me to a stand and grab something to eat.

Keiichi:
Yeah, Ok! I guess I am kinda hungry.

Mion:
Come on, let's go!

Shion:
 I wonder who is gonna die and who is gonna disappear this year..

Keiichi:
Shion, who is gonna die?

Shion:
Hold on, you've not mentioned this to Keiichi yet?

Mion:
I don't go around talking about those kinda things. Keiichi, let's go.

Keiichi:
What is she talking about?
 Come on, I don't like being the one left out of the loop here.

Mion:
Suit yourself, I'm going without you then. But if you don't hurry up, Keiichi, there's not gonna be any food left for you.

Tommy:
I don't mind telling him the story.

Shion:
Go ahead, tell him. I think Keiichi has the right to know.

Keiichi:
Look, I don't know what are you talking about, so just tell me.

Miyo:
Well, for starters, Keiichi, do you believe in curses?

Keiichi:
Did you say...curses??

Tomy:
Do you know about the Hinamizawa construction project?

Keiichi:
Yeah, um...wasn't that the things were someone was gonna build a big dam that would put Hinamizawa underwater?

Tomy:
That's the one. Most of the folks in this town set up a campaign to protest the dam's construction.
 And they decided to base their operations out of the shrine. Actually, it's this one here.
 It's the shrine of Oyashiro, the guardian god of Hinamizawa. I guess the town's folks figured they'd have better odds of beating the dam if their headquarters were in there.

Keiichi:
But what does any of that have to do with curses?

Shion:
Exactly four years ago, the director of the construction site for the Hinamizawa dam was murdered. He was chopped into pieces.

Miyo:
And then one year after that, a husband and his wife who were from Hinamizawa and who supported the dam's construction fell to their deaths from the cliff while on vacation.

Tommy:
And year after that, the priest of the shrine were standing in front of 'em died all of a sudden from some kind of mysterious illness.

Keiichi:
That was Rika's dad!

Tommy:
And just last year, that guy who was pro dam and fell off the cliff and died, a relative of his was found beaten to death.

Keiichi:
You're saying that, every year for the last four years, every one connected to the dam?

Tommy:
Hold that thought, 'cause here's the kicker. The people we've been telling you about all died on the night of the cotten drifting festival each year for four year straight.

Keiichi:
What?

Miyo:
If these deaths aren't due to coincidence or curse, what do you think of the reason for all this tragedy, Keiichi?

Tommy:
What Miss Takano means is that someone probably cause those deaths.

Miyo:
It makes sense, doesn't it? I mean if it isn't curse or coincidence, then the only logical explanation is that a person cause those deaths.

Keiichi:
Yeah, but then...

Shion:
If what she's saying is the truth, then the culprit's probably someone from Hinamizawa. And that's exactly what Mr. Oishi, the police officer thinks.

Keiichi:
But how can anybody be sure?

Shion:
Because there's a proof of it.

Keiichi:
Huh. there's a proof?

Shion:
There's always one person who dies by the curse. Someone else disappears as a sacrifice.

Keiichi:
You mean they disappear as in vanish?

Shion:
That's right. And suddenly without any trace.

Miyo:
 I wonder who it'll be, who'll disappear tomorrow and who's going to die?

Boy:
Buy me one, Mom.

Rena:
 Wow, this year's better than the last.

Mion:
 I bet everyone from Hinamizawa is here.

Rena:
 Look, it's Satoko. Hey!

Satoko:
 What took you so long? You guys are all late.

Rika:
 Thanks for coming today, guys.

Mion:
 Right, let's get in gear and check out the festival till it's Rika's turn to go on stage.

Shion:
Keiichi, come on, this way.

Keiichi:
Shion?

Keiichi:
Where're we going?
 What's the deal?
 You're just taking us further away from the stage.

Shion:
You mean you really wanted to see Rika do her little dance?
 Keiichi, you're not gonna tell me that you like a girl that young, are you?

Keiichi:
I thought you were taking me some place where I can get a better view of Rika's dance.

Shion:
I never said anything to you about doing that?

Keiichi:
Then, why do you bring me all the way out here?

Shion:
Shh, just take a look over there.

Keiichi:
What are they doing?

Takano:
Hello, who's out there?
 Well, well.

Tomitake:
Were you trying to spy on us or something, Keiichi?
 Oh, I know you guys are on a date.

Keiichi:
We're not on a date.

Shion:
I'm wondering what you two are doing over there.
 If you ask me, it looked like you were trying to pick the lock, Mr. Tomitake.

Tomitake:
Well, I guess the jig's up now.
 Yeah, we were trying to break into the warehouse, but no one supposed to know, OK?

Shion:
Hey, don't they keep the tools for the rituals in there?
 No one is allowed inside the shrine except that Furude family and a small select group of people.

Keiichi:
Really? Why is that?

Shion:
Unless you're from the Furude family, it's forbidden to enter the shrine because you only bring impurities into it.

Keiichi:
Then, I really don't think we should be going in there and messing with it.

Tomitake:
It's open.

Takano:
Good job, Jiro. Thanks. At last...

Shion:
Aren't you just a little bit curious?
 Come on. Let's take a peek.

Keiichi:
Hang on. Didn't you just say it was a sacred shrine?

Shion:
Since I am a member of the Sonozaki family, I've already got a pretty good idea that what's been kept in there.
 Besides, Keiichi, it's something that I really want you to see.

Keiichi:
Why me?

Tomitake:
OK, guys. I'll sit here, and be the lookout. Go ahead.

Keiichi:
Alright, Fine. I'll take a look.
 But if it's lame, I'm getting out of here, OK?

Shion:
That's what I wanna hear.

Takano:
Come on. Let's go inside.
 Jiro, will you be OK out here on your own?

Tomitake:
Sure.

Takano:
That's Oyashiro, the guardian god of Hinamizawa.

Shion:
It's a lot nicer than the one of the other shrine.

Takano:
Say, you know what Watanagashi or Cotton Drifting means?

Keiichi:
What? Well, um, isn't it like a festival where you pay thanks to things like the blankets you used during the winter?

Takano:
Did you know that all the people in this village have demon blood flowing in their veins?
 It's said that sometimes this man-eating demon blood awakens inside them, and compels them to spirit people away.

Keiichi:
Spirit away?

Takano:
They're used for sacrifice.
 Watanagashi or Cotton Drifting Festival is held to help them to savor the flesh of the miserable victims as they devour them.

Keiichi:
Oh...um...

Shion:
Keiichi. The word "wata" means cotton and intestines.

Keiichi:
Really? Oh, yeah, you're right. Wow.

Takano:
Yes. What you're thinking is exactly what it's all about.
 The hoe Rika holds during the ceremony is actually a dissection tool used to rip open the human's stomach.

Shion:
Well, Keiichi. Now that you heard the truth about the village, are you starting to understand the kind of stuff they're storing in this shrine?

Takano:
They're dissection tools, or if you want anymore gruesome about it, you can call them cooking utensils.

Shion:
I've heard the story before, but...seeing this.

Takano:
I heard that in Roman times.
 There was a method of execution in which they cut open the stomach, pulled the intestines they're like sausages, and put them out for display.
 Now you think if someone would remove your intestines like that, you die instantly.
 But if the procedure's handled carefully, I hear it's possible for the persons to remain fully conscious while their guts are being pulled right out of their body.
 Think about it.
 If the person's conscious, I bet it's way more horrifying than it is painfull.
 I wonder if the Cotton Drifting Festival of Onigafuchi village is the same.
 Well, you heard all the gory details of the Cotton Drifting Festival?
 Can you believe all of these horrifying rituals were passed down in Hinamizawa?

Keiichi:
Yeah, but even if all that stuff really happened here, all of it took place a long time ago, right?
 I mean none of that stuff has got anything to do with the people living in Hinamizawa anymore, does it?

Takano:
I get the feeling you really like Hinamizawa, don't you Keiichi?

Shion:
Hang on, Miss Takano.
 It sounds to me like you think those old customs are still being practiced by the people of Hinamizawa.
 Is that why you're doing this?

Takano:
I told you because I figured you're to understand, Shion?
 But keep in mind that if other villagers found out about it, they'd say it's a blasphemy, and they'd gang up on me.
 It's best if you both kept it a secret.
 If they found out, I might be cursed by Oyashiro, or perhaps l'll become this year's sacrifice.

Tomitake:
You guys done here?
 I think the dance just ended, so that means everyone's heading down to the stream now.


Takano:
Bye-bye.

Tomitake:
See you guys later.
 We're gonna go down to the stream for a little while.

Shion:
I'm tired.

Keiichi:
I heard that. I'm tired, too.

Shion:
We'll keep tonight secret, OK?
 My sister gets really jealous about stuff like this.
 And we're considering what we just did now
 I think it's probably best.
 I guess that makes the four of us prime candidates for the curse of Oyashiro.
If it even happens tonight, so we definitely have to keep all of this a secret.
 Although when we were in there, I heard a sound.
 I wonder what it was.

Keiichi:
Huh, what do you mean?
 What's sound?

Shion:
Didn't you hear it?
 It was a loud slamming sound.
 I can't believe you didn't hear it.

Keiichi:
You're kidding.
 I didn't hear anything in there.

Shion:
Seriously, are you telling me you really didn't hear that sound?

Shion:
I got you that time, Keiichi.
 I'm kidding. I was kidding.

Keiichi:
What? Hey.
 What's that all about?

Rika:
Mi.

Keiichi:
Hey, Rika.

Satoko:
We've been looking all over the place for you.

Mion:
And we finally found you.

Rena:
Hey, Keiichi, try not to get lost anymore, OK?

Keiichi:
Uh, OK.

Rika:
Did you remember to cheer me on while I was doing my dance, Keiichi?

Keiichi:
Yeah, I was watching the whole time.
 You were totally awesome, Rika.
 You didn't even make a mistake.

Mion:
Um, he's right.
 You know I wouldn't even count that as a mistake, Rika.

Satoko:
She's right.

Mion:
So how about it, Keiichi?
 Did you get some cotton and throw it into the stream?

Rena:
If you don't, hurry up.
 It's going to be over.

Mion:
Come on.

Mion:
Hey, Keiichi.

Keiichi:
What's up?

Mion:
Did you see Shion?

Keiichi:
Um, no.

Mion:
Oh, that's my sister Shion for you.
 Well, I guess there is no use worring about her now.
 She should be fine on her own.


Mion:
Keiichi.

Keiichi:
Mion. You feeling OK?
 You're looking kind of pale.

Mion:
I'm OK.
 I had to do the family dinner thing after I got back from the festival last night.
 I had a couple too many.

Keiichi:
You've got a hangover?
 How old are you anyway?

Mion:
Cut me some slack, man.
 Yeah, it's true I'm not feeling a hundred percent today.
 Oh, yeah, by the way, Keiichi.
 It's about last night.
 Did you happen to see Mr. Tomitake and Miss Takano?

Keiichi:
Uh, no.
 I don't know.

Mion:
Oh, OK.
 Then let me ask you something else.
 Last night did you see Shion?

Keiichi:
Well, you asked me that last night, didn't you?

Mion:
Oh, did I?
 I guess I sort of thought I might get a different answer if I asked you again today.
 So, no worries.
 But I'm really glad you didn't see those guys last night.
 I'll definitely let'em know.
 Don't worry, Keiichi.
 I'll tell them you weren't involved in anything bad.
 I'll make sure to let them all know that, OK?

Keiichi:
What do you mean "them"?


Keiichi:
Hello, Maebara residence.
 Oh, Shion.

Keiichi:
So, what do you wanna talk about?

Oishi:
Hello, there.
 You guys on a date?
 I'm so jealous, you kids.

Shion:
Detective Oishi.

Keiichi:
Oh, you're the policeman.

Oishi:
And would you be Mion, or maybe you're Shion.
 Maebara, I bet you're pretty tough, aren't you?
 A guy like you two-timing the Sonozaki twins?

Keiichi:
Hang on. It isn't anything like that.

Shion:
Hey, Keiichi.
 Sorry, but I have to go to work right now.

Keiichi:
Oh. But then...

Shion:
I'll just give you a call tonight.
 Talk to you then.

Keiichi:
What's with you?
 You're the one who wanted me to come over here?

Oishi:
OK. Then, so how much do you really know about Miss Sonozaki anyway?

Keiichi:
Well, not much I guess.

Oishi:
Well, the Sonozaki family is the Yakuza group that controls everything in this area.
 Mion, as charming as she is, is next in line to inherit everything, meaning the entire Sonozaki family including Yakuza group.

Keiichi:
Oh.

Oishi:
You probably don't understand what I am talking about.


Keiichi:
Why me?

Oishi:
Just listen.
 You see Mr. Jiro Tomitake or Miss Miyo Takano last night?

Oishi:
One more matter.
 Did you happen to see or eyewitness Shion Shionozaki at any point during the festival?

Keiichi:
Well, I...I don't remember.
 I guess I might have.
 What's going on? What's with everybody?

Detective:
Detective Oishi?

Oishi:
OK. I've got it.
 Please excuse me.
 Oh, yeah. About last night, it seems the four of you were having a lot of fun together, hanging out on the stone steps.
 I'm sure we'll meet again real soon.

Keiichi:
How could you just leave me there alone with him?
 Well, what do you wanna talk about?

Shion:
Please don't be mad at me.
 It's just the...,
 Well, did you know?

Keiichi:
Did I know what?

Shion:
Looks like you don't.
 It's about last night.
 After the "Cotton Drifting Festival", remember how the four of us went into the shrine with all the ritual tools?

Keiichi:
Yeah, and?

Shion:
Did you see Mr. Tomitake and Miss Takano after that?

Keiichi:
Now she is asking me?
 And what about you, Shion?
 Did you see them?

Shion:
Of course, I didn't see them.
 I was with a couple of family members.
 They'll vouch for me.

Keiichi:
Yeah, me too.
 If you wanna talk vouching, I was with Mion and Rena and the others.
 That's my alibi.

Shion:
OK. Then I'll tell you.
 Last night I heard that Mr. Tomitake and Miss Takano died.
 They found Miss Takano burnt to death, and it looks like Mr. Tomitake committed suicide by clawing at his own throat.

Keiichi:
Re... Really?

Shion:
I heard about it this morning.
 I thought it might be Oyashiro's curse.
 I mean it's not like we don't deserve to be cursed after breaking into that shrine and seeing what we saw?

Keiichi:
What? What are you saying?

Shion:
Look. Think about what's happened.
 What I've just told you.
 Don't you think the Oyashiro's curse is doing something strange this year?
 I mean before someone would die and someone else would disappear.
 But this year two people have died.

Keiichi:
What are you getting at?
 That's not the problem here, is it?

Shion:
No. If two people died from Oyashiro's curse, then that means to calm Oyashiro two other people will have to be sacrificed.

Keiichi:
Wait. Two?

Shion:
So far, I haven't heard the thing about anybody going missing yet.
 But I think that very soon two people are going to disappear.

Keiichi:
That means the only other people who went into that shrine.
 Wait. No way. You're kidding.
 Hey, we were only looking.
 It's no like any of us stole anything or took something out of there, right?
 I couldn't care less about the stuff I saw in there.
 I haven't remembered what it was.
 I didn't wanna go in there in the first place.
 Hey, I wanted to see Rika's dance, Shion.
 You're the one who took me into it.
 Yeah. That's right.
 You're the only one who wanted to go in there.
 I've got nothing to do with this.
 So, what are you gonna do?
 Are you gonna take responsibility for this, huh? Hey?
 Hey, are you listening?



What's shaking is your heart.
 Bringing it closer is the shadow of darkness.
 The one shivering is the fake me.


 When They Cry,
