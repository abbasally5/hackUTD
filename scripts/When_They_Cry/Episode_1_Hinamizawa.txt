And as a result of their actions, three people were arrested for an obstruction of justice.
Protests against the Hinamizawa dam construction plan are becoming increasingly frequent, particularly after last month's bloody clash with the riot police.
As the consequence, police are now on high alert in preparation for further attacks [from] these extremists.
Just last week they [have] directly appealed [against the] dam construction.

Toshiki:
OK. See you.

Boy:
Later.

Man:
Hey, there.
You would be Toshiki Inukai?

Akasaka:
My name is Mamoru Akasaka.
I met the young girl as a result of the kidnapping case.

Man:
Forty eight hours ago we had a kidnapping.
His grandfather is the cabinet minister for the Ministry of Construction.
His father, he's in the same department.
Right now, the minister doesn't want police involved.
He wants to give in to their demands, and he settles matters as quickly and quietly as possible.
None the less, we've been managing the ministry's home phone.
And we noticed the suspicious calls coming in from outside the city.
Those phone calls have allowed us to confirm the crime did indeed occur.
All right. That's it.
Keep all this intel classified.
Akasaka, I want you to go out and investigate the group who're protesting the Hinamizawa dam project.
The one who appealed to the minister directly.

Akasaka:
Yes, sir.

Man:
I really doubt if they are behind all of this.
They're just some grass fruits group in the countryside.
But we need to eliminate all possibilities.

Akasaka:
Understood, sir.

Man:
Go straight there, and get as much info as you can from a local police.

Akasaka:
Got it.

Akasaka:
I'm sorry, but there is an outside chance I may not make it back in time for your delivery.

Wife:
Please don't worry.
I'll be fine.
Your baby and I will be waiting for you when you come back.

Akasaka:
Onigafuchi Defence Alliance, huh?
Normally a rookie officer like me doesn't get [pitched for/picked] out of the district investigations.
But the higher-ups have decided to give me a crack at it, partly because of the major staff shortage, but also because no one thinks this little protest group in the countryside can possibly be involved in this.

Hondaya:
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I appreciate your making a long trip out here.

Akasaka:
I'm sorry for just showing up like this.
I'm sure it must be a busy time for you.
I'm here on behalf of the National Police Agency.
My name's Akasaka.

Hondaya:
Good. My name's Hondaya.
I'm a Public Safety.
That head of our riot squad chief Sankai maybe swear I give you complete cooperation.

Akasaka:
Riot squad?
The local police really has its riot squad involved all of this?

Hondaya:
We think those involved in the Onigafuchi Defence Alliance are the members of a larger more extreme group of activists.
If anyone think they're just acting for the greater good to the community, they are fooling themselves.

Oishi:
Well, now.
I was wondering what you two could be talking about.

Hondaya:
Oh, hey, hello there, Oishi.
Excellent timing.
This is Mr. Akasaka.
He came here all the way from Tokyo.
He's one of the National Police Agency
Let me introduce you both, Akasaka?
Detective Oishi.
Oishi here happens to be a resident expert on the Hinamizawa dam conflict.

Oishi:
Well, if you like, son, I'll be happy to give you little tour of the area.

Akasaka:
Yeah, that'd be great.

Akasaka:
Detective Oishi gave me a tour and told me all about Hinamizawa.
He told me about the three great families of Hinamizawa, and how amongst the three great families,
it's the Sonozaki family who has absolute power.
The head of that family is Oryo Sonozaki.
She essentially runs Hinamizawa and all the protest dealing with the construction of the dam.
And he talked about the fact that each year the protests keep escalating.

Oishi:
So, you came all the way from Tokyo to check out a little dam construction protests.

Akasaka:
Yeah, that's it.
Exactly.

Oishi:
Well, then I guess that appeal they made to the cabinet minister Inukai finally got the group some attention, didn't it?
Which is probably why the Public Safety Department got involved.
They decided they'd better keep them under some sort of surveillance.

Akasaka:
You've got the whole thing figured out already.

Oishi:
Let's cut [to/through] the crap.
You don't really expect me to believe that it just took an appeal to the cabinet minister to get you down here.
Let me guess, kid.
Keeping secret isn't gonna be one of your strong points.
That's good.
I much prefer people who I can be straightforward with.
Listen, son.
You might be surprised to find out I can be a whole lot more useful to you if you just tell me what the truth is.

Akasaka:
And how can you be more useful to me?

Oishi:
My good introduce leads you to someone who knows a lot about the people you are interested in.

Akasaka:
Are you talking about a spy?

Oishi:
Maybe.

Akasaka:
What makes you so interested in my investigation?

Oishi:
Well, I guess you could look at it is a kind of give-and-take situation.

Akasaka:
Oh, I see.
The next one's been canceled, hasn't it?

Man:
Are you here for some sort of magazine job or something?

Akasaka:
No, no, personal reasons.

Man:
Personal? So you just wanna do some sightseeing?

Akasaka:
Yeah, I read in a magazine,
there is still a lot of untouch natural beauty to be found in this village.

Man:
Then, you should come on out.
Thing's a bit hectic right now.
But you should come here and look around regardless.

Akasaka:
Great.
Thank you so much.
I look forward to it.
Yeah, you got it.

Akasaka:
She's so cute.

Akasaka:
Hey, just because I'm a stranger, doesn't mean I'm bad, I promise.

Makino:
Hey, hello there, friend.
Sorry, my apologies for making you wait.
So, are you the guy who called yesterday, wanted to do some sightseeing?

Akasaka:
Ah, yeah.

Makino:
Well, then stop standing there and climb on in.
Looks like a weather is gonna turn for the worse again, so what I'll do is drive you around, give you a quick tour.

Akasaka:
Great. Thank you.

Makino:
Oh, wow, I had no idea that you are here, Rika.
We are truly blessed.
What an amazing stroke of good luck.

Rika:
So Makino, do you have a working to do now?

Akasaka:
Makino? She doesn't even address him with "Mr."?

Makino:
Village leader asked me to take a certain young man on a little tour of our fair village.
Seems he has some sightseeing he wants to do.

Rika:
Are you the certain young man who wants to do the sightseeing?

Akasaka:
That would be me.
I heard the nature around here is really something amazing.
So I decided I'd see for myself and take some pictures.

Rika:
That makes you Tomitake-2.

Akasaka:
Huh? Tomitake?

Rika:
Do you really find this thing interesting?

Akasaka:
Well, you know, it's just got a lot of [character], I guess.
I like it.
It's got kind of nostalgic feeling to it.

Rika:
Is Hinamizawa a fun place for you?

Akasaka:
Yeah, that's a lot of fun.
Once my wife gets out of a hospital, I wanna come back here again.
And we can bring a new baby along on that trip.

Makino:
All right.
For our last stop, I'm gonna take you to a place that has the best view of the whole village.

Rika:
You're really gonna take him to the place with the best view?

Makino:
Why? Of course.
What kind of a tour guide would I be if I didn't?
Nowhere else in the town comes anywhere close to the view from there.

Rika:
This is great.
You know what it means?
It means we're going to my house.

Akasaka:
Huh, what do you mean that we are going to your house?

Makino:
We are going to Furude shrine.
Rika lives there.
It sits way up above the whole village.
So, the views you can get up there are really spectacular.

Akasaka:
Furude shrine, huh?
Rika's last name is Furude.
That means she is from one of the three great families.

Akasaka:
What's all this?

Makino:
The shrine also happens to be the headquarters for all the protest going on against the proposed dam.
I bet these signs remind you of the protest that when on during the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty.

Akasaka:
Well, I'll be honest with you.
I'm really not much of a political activist.
I have a hard time getting behind any cause that tries to attack the country's political policy through violence and picket lines.

Makino:
Well now, it seems you have a definite opinion on this particular topic.

Akasaka:
I believe if you want to have a say in nation's politics, then you should vote for a politician who expresses your same views.
And if you can't find one, then jump in the politics and try to change things that way.
That's the bedrock of democracy.

Rika:
You two keep talking and talking, but I don't understand single word you're saying.

Akasaka:
I'm sorry.
Politics probably isn't your favorite subject, is it?
All I was trying to say is that since Japan is a peaceful country, if you have something to say, then you should do it peacefully.
That's all.

Rika:
But Akasaka, what are we supposed to do to keep our village from being drowned by the dam?
This place is the only place that most of us can live.
We wouldn't make it if we had to live in a big city.

Kimiyoshi:
Hey there, Makino.
Good to see you.
So, is this the tourist you called yesterday?

Makino:
It is indeed.
And this is the local leader of Hinamizawa, Mr. Kimiyoshi.

Akasaka:
Kiichirou Kimiyoshi.

Kimiyoshi:
Welcome to Hinamizawa.
How has it been so far?
Have you found it to be a beautiful and tranquil place?

Akasaka:
Yeah, it's great.
I've spent an entire day taking all kinds of amazing places in your wonderful village.

Kimiyoshi:
Well, thank you.
It sounds like we have a gentleman among us.

Rika:
Come on, Akasaka. Over here, hurry.

Akasaka:
Sorry, excuse me for a second, guys.

Akasaka:
Wow, this is amazing.

Rika:
Yeah, it's my favorite place in the whole world.

Akasaka:
I can't believe it.
It's hard to imagine a place as beautiful as this.
It's gonna sink under a lake.

Rika:
It's not going to sink.
All this talk about the dam project is just going to go away.

Akasaka:
Yeah, well. I hope so.

Rika:
Akasaka, do you believe that those people are just gonna drown our village?

Akasaka:
Well, it's not like I want to drown this place, but still...

Rika:
It's not gonna happen.
It won't happen because all this talk about the dam is just getting go away.

Akasaka:
Go away?

Rika:
That's right.
It's all just getting go away.

Akasaka:
Rika, how can you be so sure?

Rika:
I just know.
And it doesn't matter what you do or don't do, Akasaka.
The dam project will be gone by the end of the year.
It's something that's been decided.

Akasaka:
So, why do you think this?

Rika:
Because it's been decided.
There is no other way to put it.

Akasaka:
Yeah, but just because you say, that doesn't mean...
Wait, Rika. Stop. That's dangerous.

Rika:
Akasaka, go back to Tokyo.
You should turn around and go back to Tokyo immediately.
If you stay here, I promise you'll regret it.

Akasaka:
Regret it?

Rika:
You've now been warned.
The rest is up to you.

Akasaka:
Who, who are you?
You are not Rika.
Who are you?

Akasaka:
Rika, Rika, Rika.
Are you all right?
OK, then.

Oishi:
Well, I'm leaving it all in the hands of Mr. Sato now.

Akasaka:
You backing out of this case, Detective Oishi?

Oishi:
Listen. If I stick around, I'm just gonna be in your way.
Besides, you're the one who wanted to offer the jobs to Mr. Sato anyway.

Sato:
Well, let's go.

Sato:
So, I'm guessing that Oishi gave you the general rundown on Hinamizawa.

Akasaka:
Yeah, the basics anyway.

Sato:
Good, then let's get right down to the business.

Akasaka:
Great. Please do.

Sato:
Last night, there was a family meeting at the Sonozaki house.

Akasaka:
Family meeting?

Sato:
At the center of this meeting was the head of the Sonozaki family, Oryo Sonozaki.
Her granddaughter Mion is rumored to be the next heir.
In addition to them, there were various leaders from the other three great families.
The Furude family and the Kimiyoshi family.
There were also a few immediate relatives sprinkled among them.

Akasaka:
So they had this meeting.
But what exactly were they all called there to talk about?

Sato:
They mainly were over their efforts to stop the dam construction.
But the most interesting thing they talked about came out in the end of the evening.
And that was...

Oryo:
Well, I guess that's rather unfortunate, isn't it?

Kimiyoshi:
What is it, Miss(?) Oryo?
What's happened?

Oryo:
If we truly believe this land inherits our mother, that means construction of this dam is an invasion that threatens our own mother's life.
There is a rumor going around that the chief minister's grandson has been kidnapped and it's causing a great deal of chaos.
Now we're even.

Akasaka:
That's impossible.
There's no way she could know that.
The intelligence on Minister Inukai's grandson was completely classified.
How've they accessed [to] that?

Kimiyoshi:
Are you absolutely certain about this?

Oryo:
The pain we feel is the pain one feels when they lose their mother.
And although I don't think it's completely the same, I do believe it's about time for him to endure the pain of losing a grandchild.
However, a peace of land and someone's granchild are of vastly different values.
I'm not opposed to the kidnapping, I just don't want any harm to come to that boy.
He's not directly involved with this.
So make sure you take care of him.

Akasaka:
So, what is this all mean.
Are you trying to tell me the Onigafuchi Defence Alliance would somehow be involved in the kidnapping case?

Sato:
Well, this doesn't conclude that with absolute certainty.

Akasaka:
But how can you say that with everything Oryo said.
She gave them all direct orders how she wanted his grandson to be treated.

Sato:
We have no idea if those were her orders or those were just her personal feelings pertaining to that topic.
She was intentionally vague.

Sato:
That was everything Oryo had a say regarding the kidnapped grandchild.
I hope this info shed some light on whatever it is you are looking into.
Listen guy, I don't know what kind of work you do.
But if you're thinking taking on the Sonozaki family, then you'd better make sure you got the stomach for it.

Akasaka:
Thanks.

Man:
Oishi alone has been attacked two or three times.
He hasn't worn it lately, but for a while he wouldn't go anywhere without a bulletproof vest, even on his days off.

Akasaka:
He wore a bulletproof vest?

Man:
Listen, bro.
You're not with the Public Safety Department for the National Police Agency, are you?

Akasaka:
Huh? No, no way.

Man:
Fine. Then I give you a little extra info while I'm at it.
Right after the kidnapping occurred, there was this other case that popped up.

Akasaka:
What was that about?

Man:
As part of the investigation for the cabinet minister's missing grandchild, the Public Safety Department sent one of their own guy down here from Tokyo.

Akasaka:
From the Public Safety Department?

Oryo:
That's right.
They're here because of the kidnapping.
The cabinet minister doesn't want them to go public with this, so the Public Safety Department they're just doing their own classified investigation.
They're blowing it all out of proportion.
What's wrong?

Rika:
Did the National Policemen come here?

Oryo:
My, my.
Our little Rika knows what the National Police is.
That's a good girl.

Rika:
Who's the one who came here?

Oryo:
Has anyone heard about this new investigator yet?
We need to make sure we stay on top of this.

Man:
I heard the guy they sent down here was a newbie.
That's about all the information I've got though.

Rika:
A newbie?
Like a really fresh newbie?

Man:
Yes, definitely new and fresh.

Rika:
Yeah, a young fresh newbie.

Man:
Well, he certainly seemed to be all that.
So, what should we do about this, Mother?

Oryo:
Leave it be for now.
However, if he starts to be a threat to us at any point, feel free to
do whatever it is, you must.
I don't like people messing in my affairs.

Rika:
A young fresh newbie.

Man:
Well, I'm afraid that's all the info I've got for you in this?
You just be careful out there, OK?

Akasaka:
Hello.

Oishi:
Mr. Akasaka?
It's Detective Oishi.
Good morning to you.

Akasaka:
Yeah, good morning.

Oishi:
I'm sorry.
I didn't awake you, did I?
Well, I've gotta bad news for you, it'll definitely get you out of bed.
Something interesting turned up at lost and found bin down at the Hinamizawa police substation.

Akasaka:
Lost and found bin?

Akasaka:
A wallet?
That's what you got?

Oishi:
Look at this.
There is more.
The wallet was found in Takatsudo.
It's an old abandoned village.
There is nothing in there.
It's a very lonely place.

Akasaka:
Oishi, you think you can take me to Takatsudo right now?

Oishi:
Yes, sure. No problem.

Akasaka:
What are you grabbing that thing for?

Oishi:
Just a precaution.
If you're gonna knowingly put yourself on a harm's way, the very least you can do is try to be prepared.
I'll get you one, too, if you want?

What is being hunted is a resolute image
What is being sought is an exit into the light
