  Teppei:
So Ritsuko, tell me.
That man you got in Hinamizawa; how's he doing?
Think there's more money to squeeze out of him?

Rina:
Oh, he is a cash cow.
I heard when his wife divorced him, she felt so guilty she left him with a ton of money.

Teppei:
So how're you gonna lure this guy in?

Rina:
I'll use you as bait, and then make him pay to get us out of his life forever.



( Rina: )
( He buys me anything I want. Anything. )



Keiichi:
Man, it's so peaceful here.
It's boring.

Rena:
You really think so?
But it's peaceful like this, that's what I like it the most.

Keiichi:
I wish I were as happy as you are all the time, Rena.

Mion:
Ahahaha, it's kinda hard to take offense to someone who's jealous of that.

Keiichi:
If you got some trick that'll turn a boring day into a fun one, I want to know.

Rena:
That's pretty easy to do.
You just got to pay attention.

Keiichi:
Pay attention to what?

Rena:
To the number of happy days you do have.
'Cause there's a limit to 'em.

Mion:
Your brain hurt yet?
That theory is way too complicated for Keiichi to comprehend.
Dork!

Keiichi:
Hey! Just because I didn't get it right away, it doesn't mean I wouldn't get it eventually!

Rena:
It's so true.
These happy days we have right now can simply vanish.



Rina:
Oh, welcome home Rena.

Rena:
Oh, hi.

Rina:
For lunch today your father and I went to this restaurant which had the most delicious Keema curry I've ever tasted in my life.
I got a couple of orders for you to try later if you want.
I'm telling you it's really good. I promise.

Rena:
Wow, that sounds delicious.
I'll try 'em later. Thanks.

Rina:
If you don't mind, Rena, I'd like to have a little talk with you about the three of us maybe...

Rena:
Oh, not right now.

Rina:
Huh?

Rena:
I'm sorry. I told a friend of mine I'd meet up with him. I'm kind of late as it is.

Rina:
Let me guess.
Another treasure hunt for you at the dump?
Maybe I should come along next time and see if I could

Rena:
Gotta go!

Rina:
Ah... Urgh.



Rina:
Hey, Rena.

Rena:
Is that you, Rina?

Rina:
I'm beginning to wonder if you're hard of hearing, Rena.

Rena:
Sorry.

Rina:
Are you by yourself? Where's your friend?

Rena:
I'm just playing alone right now.

Rina:
That's pretty mature for someone in your age.

Rena:
See ya.

Rina:
Urgh.

Rina:
Wow, this seems like a cool place, kinda like a hideout, huh?

Rena:
Hahahaha. Yep, it's a secret place I can go that no one else knows of.
No one gets to come down here.
And if you make a noise, no one can hear it.

Rina:
So I was right this is your secret hideout.
Well, I feel honored that I'm one of the only people who's ever seen it.
There's something I've been wanting to ask you for a while now, Rena.

Rena:
What is it?

Rina:
I just wanted to know if you liked me.

Rena:
Ahahaha. Why would you ask that?

Rina:
Well you see, your dad and I have been seeing each other for a while now, right?
And we've been talking about a few things pretty seriously lately.
Things like our future together, and what it would be like if we would share our lives with each other.


( Mother: )
( Rena. You like Akihito too, don't you? )
( You see, Mommy wants to... )


Rena:
I'm not going to let you marry my dad.

Rina:
Huh?

Rena:
If you guys want to date, that's fine.
But I'm not gonna let you marry him.
That's a promise.

Rina:
Ahahaha. I thought you might be somewhat reticent about it.
But I didn't think you'd be so blunt as to reject our right.

Rena:
You knew from the beginning that I wasn't gonna support this?
How did you know?

Rina:
Well it was pretty obvious.
Every time the two of our eyes met, you ran away immediately.
Just out of curiosity, would you mind telling me what it is you don't like about me?

Rena:
I hate everything about you; your clothes, your makeup, even your smell.

Rina:
Well, that works out well, because I hate you, too.
I guess that makes us even, doesn't it, you snot-nosed little brat?
Ahahahahaha.
Don't mess with me kid.
I promise you will regret it.

Rena:
Don't ever step foot in my house again!
And as far as the marrige goes, it's never gonna happen.

Rina:
I think the person you need to be telling this to is your dad, by good luck convincing him.
See, things are little complicated.
Wanna know why?
'Cause I'm pregnant.


( Mother: )
( Rena. Mommy is... pregnant. )


Rena:



Rina:
Actually you're wrong.
It's quite true.

Rena:
I know who you are.
And I know what you're trying to do; I heard everything you said to the man Teppei in the caf√©.
I know you call my dad your man in Hinamizawa, and you're doing everything you can to squeeze money out of him.
And I know you're trying to pull a badger game on him but now it's not gonna work!

Rina:
I see. You are well-informed for a little girl.
You said no one else knows about this place, didn't you?
The only person who knows that exists besides you is me.
Listen, you little snot!
No one messes with me!
In just a little bit of time, a ton of moneys will be rolling my way, and you aren't gonna stop that!
You ain't messing this up for me.
I didn't want to have to kill you kid, but you got in the way.
I'm never gonna find another sucker like your dad.
As soon as I get that cash, I'm out of here. No one's ever gonna see me around here again.

AHH!


Hey, what are you doing?!
We're not playing around here!
AAAAAHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!

Rena:
D I E !! D I E !!!!!! D I E !!!!!!!!! D I E !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



Teppei:
You bastard!
How dare you touch my lady?!
You think you could do that enough pay for it?
Listen up! I'm gonna come by tomorrow.
And you better have some money for me.


Rena:
Excuse me?

Teppei:
What the... And just who the hell are you?

Rena:
Well, um, you see, I'm, I'm Ryugu's daughter.

Teppei:
What's that?

Rena:
It's true. And you see, I was just with Rina, and she asked me to go and find you and take you to her.

Teppei:
Really? Why? Did something happen to her?

Rena:
She said she has something she wanted to tell you.

Teppei:
She wanted me to come here?
What in the hell would Ritsuko be doing here?

Rena:
She said she needed some place private for the two of you to talk.
So, she came here.

Teppei:
Ha. What the hell (is/was) that stupid brat thinking?

Rena:
I'm sorry. The batteries must've run out.
Let me see if I can find some more!

Teppei:
Fine. Just hurry it up.
Wait. I've got a lighter.
Ah? Where the hell did she go?


UUUUUURRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Rena:
Sorry, Mion.
I can't take part in the club today.
I've got some stuff to take care of at home.

Mion:
What? You're leaving us?

Keiichi:
Oh, Come on, Rena.
Hang out with us for a bit.

Satoko:
If (you) go, you're gonna miss it when I mop the floor with Keiichi today.
You don't wanna miss that, do you?

Rika:
That does sound like fun.

Rena:
Sorry, but I can't.

Keiichi:
You had to take care of stuff at home yesterday, too.
Is everything OK there?

Rena:
Um, nothing too big.
Just chores.



Keiichi:
What happened?
Where are the pieces gone?

Mion:
Well, we can't play mah-jong with this.
What do we do?
Anyone got any suggestions?

Satoko:
I say we go treasure hunting for the missing mah-jong pieces.

Keiichi:
That sounds pretty boring to me.

Mion:
I've got it.
What do you say we make this a serious treasure hunt instead?

Keiichi:
Keep going.

Mion:
Okay.
When it comes to treasure hunting, Rena is the expert, right?

Satoko:
Do you wanna go to the dump of the old construction site?

Rika:
I don't think we should go there.
Everyone says that place is haunted.
That dismembered man still looms there.

Keiichi:
I heard about this.
Some guy got chopped up out there and they never found out who did it.
I also heard they never found one of his arms, either.
I bet it's still out there in the dump somewhere.

Mion:
Well, after the fight with the construction people, the only person who's willing to go out there now is Rena.
All right. Today we're going to the dump for a treasure hunt.
Whoever finds the ghost, first wins!
Whoever finds the arm, comes in second.
And if we end up striking out, finding none of these, then Rena will get to decide.
The next game will be totally up to her.

Keiichi & Mion & Satoko:
Let's do it!

Rika:
Yeah, do it.



Rena:
Well, now you guys know everything.
Before you got here, I was at the river bank, trying to find a place to bury all.
It's a lot to bury, you know.
But I couldn't find any place. Anywhere that would work.

Keiichi:
Rena. Why didn't you tell us? Why did you leave us completely in the dark on this.

Rena:
Tell you?

Keiichi:
Yes. We're all your friends, Rena?
And when you need some help, you just got to call and we'll always be there for you.
That's what being a friend is all about, Rena?
Your friends are like your family.
If you just told us what was going on, we could've helped.
And maybe then, if you ['d done that], you might not have had to kill these people.

Rena:
Really?
Let's just say you're right. Let's say I told you all about my father and this woman.
What would you have done to help me? I want to know what you'd have done differently.

Keiichi:
Well first I'd...

Rena:
Go on. First you'd?

Keiichi:
Er...... Um......

Rena:
That's what I thought.
There's nothing you could've done, Keiichi.
That goes for everyone else.
There's nothing anyone here could've done.

Keiichi:
Yeah, but Rena.

Rena:
You talk about friends, Keiichi.
But those people are really only there for you during the good times.
When something really truly painful happens to you, you're on your own.

Keiichi:
That isn't true.

Rena:
It's always been like that.
It was like that even when I moved to that other town.
That's when I learned. When it comes down to it, there's just certain thing you can't really tell your friends.
In the end, the only person who can really help you is you.
That's just the simple truth.

Keiichi:
I want to know why.

Rena:
Huh?

Keiichi:
I want to know why you refuse to trust us.

Mion:
Keiichi...

Keiichi:
Maybe what you said really is true.
Even if you had told us what was going on, we still wouldn't have come up with a plan to help you to get out of this mess.
But, even so, we could've thought of a better future for you than this, at least one that you didn't kill people.

Rena:
A better future for me than this?
That doesn't exist.

This is it. This is the best future I could have.

Keiichi:
No, it's not!
If you really think that's true, then explain to me why you've been crying this whole time!

Rena:
What?
Is that what you think, that I'm crying?
Tell me when I once shed a tear.

Keiichi:
Right now!
You're crying right now!
Don't you even see it?

Rena, what you did was horrible, and really stupid.
But as your friend, I don't care. I'll still be there for you no matter what.
I'll just accept that this was a bad decision; something you did, not knowing you had any other choice.
People do stupid things when they feel trapped.
You screwed up. But I see why and I won't judge you for it.
The only people who know what's in these awful bags are your friends.
And we're gonna help you bury these things and keep it that way, okay?
There's nothing for you to worry about, Rena.

Rena.

Rika:
Mii.

Rena:
Rika?

Keiichi:
Satoko.

Satoko:
He's right, Rena.
Rika and I each lost our parents and we're both alone now.
But as awful as that is, we hardly ever feel sad about it.
And the only reason we can do that is 'cause we know our friends are just like family.

Keiichi:
Friends that are just like family, huh?
You know, I think I like the sound of that.

Mion:
Hey, I gotta was the club leader's job to stress the value of friendship, especially when times are tough.
Oh well, guess I really sucked as your club leader today.

Keiichi:
Mion.

Mion:
Sorry. This is serious.
I'm the one who really screwed up here, Rena.
I should have been there.
I should have seen you needed help. I'm really sorry.
I wish you would've told us what was going on, but I see now why you didn't.
We obviously didn't make you feel like you could trust us.
And that's something our friends should do.
We screwed up on that; it won't happen again.
I'm not gonna judge you, either.

Rena:
Even though, I'm a murderer now?
This is gonna cause a lot of trouble for you guys?

Keiichi:
Rena, you just need to accept that we're here for you.
And that is not too late, either.
You have all kinds of options; You can choose to do whatever you want.
So who are you gonna choose? Your friends? Come on!


Rena:
( Crying... )



Keiichi:
Hey, Rena!

Rena:
Uh-huh? What is it?

Keiichi:
It's done. Why don't you go home and take a nice long nap?

Rena:
Yeah. I think I will. Thank you.

Mion:
Rena. Whatever you do, don't blame yourself.

Rena:
You know, all you guys are right.

Keiichi:
About what?

Rena:
All this time, the only person I was fooling was myself.
I kept trying to convince myself to what I was doing was right.
But deep down in my heart, I still knew that what I was doing was a horrible thing.
And the reason I realized this is because of you guys.
You helped me to end this.
If you guys didn't come here today, and I had to do this all by myself, there's no way that I would have been able to do it.
In fact that probably would've killed me.



Mion:
Once this day is over, I think it's best for everybody if we all forget whatever happened at all.
What do you think?

Satoko:
I totally agree.
Considering everything Rena's been through, I think it's the nicest thing we can do.

Rika:
Rena is a pretty strong person.
If we act like nothing ever happened, then that'll make it easier for her to try to do the same.

Keiichi:
You know what I heard.
If you say something is true, sooner or later you'll really believe it.

Mion:
If we don't talk about this anymore, then eventually we'll forget it entirely.
And that's exactly the goal we should be aiming for, to forget this day ever happened.

Rika:
You're right, Mion. But we should realize that we may not live long enough to ever see that day.

Satoko:
Maybe, maybe no.



Rena:
Hey there!

Mion:
Come on, hurry up! Rena, you're late!

Rena:
Yeah, sorry.

Keiichi:
All right. Where should we start?

Satoko:
Some place good! I'm hungry.

Rika:
Mii.

Mion:
Stir frying noodles it is!

Rena:
Sounds good!

Keiichi:
Let's get it!

Oishi:
Hm!

Where I started to run was my usual way home.
 What caused me to struggle was this message of misfortune.
 When I opened was a scrapbook of deception.
 When They Cry
 "Atonement" Chapter Episode 3: Document 34
 Can you believe in this?
