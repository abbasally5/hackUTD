  Mion:
The classroom doesn't have any air conditioning. We can't close the windows in there. It's way too hot.

Chie: 
Be patient. The principal is contacting the forest service agency as we speak. We'll find out for sure what's going on. I think it's just the fumes of some chemicals they're using. We'll figure it out. Now, go back to class.

Mion: 
Ok, thanks.

Chie: 
Good morning, Hinamizawa school district, how can I help? Rena? Where are you right now? I understand. Don't move, I'll be right there.

Keiich: 
Huh? Rena called?

Mion: 
Ya, I don't know where she is. But Ms. Chie is gone to meet her right now.

(* Screaming of children *)

Rena: 
All right, everybody. On your feet. I want you to slowly move to the center of the class.

Keiichi: 
Rena!

Rena: 
Didn't you hear me? Mion, you are the class president. Tell them to move.

Mion: 
Rena, what's going on? What will you do....

(* Screaming of children *)


Police radio:
As of approximately one p.m. today, a group of students were held hostages in the classroom. The school is a part of Hinamizawa forest district (unclear) immediately, I repeat, (unclear).

Kumagai:
We still don't know if Rena Ryugu is working with someone else on this. Since she's keeping the curtains closed, we aren't getting much information out of there, either.

Chie: 
(*sob*)

Oishi: 
What about the forest service?

Kumagai: 
The staff wasn't in today. So it's just fifteen students in the classroom.

Officer: 
Detective! The suspect’s on the line. She's called us!

Oishi: 
Hello, then. Oishi speaking. 

Rena: 
Detective Oishi? Hi, it's Rena.

Oishi: 
This is quite a scene you got here.

Rena: 
I need to know if you are really on my side or not.

Oishi: 
Of course, I am. Together, you and I are gonna expose Sonozaki's sinister plot.

Rena: 
Keiichi didn’t believe me at first, either. But now he finally sees the truth about everything. You are on my side, too, aren't you, Keiichi? Well?

Keiichi: 
Yeah.

Oishi: 
Oh, I see. Well then, now that you managed to get another ally on our side. Would you mind if I said hi to him? You can just put him on the phone for a second.

Rena: 
Sure. Keiichi, it's Detective Oishi.

Keiichi: 
Hey, there, it's Keiichi.

Ohish: 
Greeting son, it's Oishi from the Okinomiya Police Department.

Keiichi: 
Yeah.

Oishi: 
What's Ms. Ryugu doing right now?

Keiichi : 
She's sort of pacing around the hostages.

Oishi: 
All right, listen son, if the answer is yes, say yes. If the answer is no, then give me a yeah. We're gonna help you. We'll need to know what her demands are. You have any insight on this?

Keiichi: 
Yeah.

Oishi: 
Are you just pretending to be on her side right now, because she threatened your life if you didn't ?

Keiichi: 
Yes.

Oishi: 
Is Rena the only person in there holding you captive.

Keiichi: 
Yes.

Rena: 
See? I told you Keiichi is on our side?

Oishi: 
Yeah, sure he is.

Rena: 
Good. All right detective, now it's your turn to talk. When you and I last spoke, you were going to investigate the Sonozaki family. What's been your progress on that? Were you able to find the lab where they grow the parasites?

Oishi: 
Well, right now, the Criminal Investigation Unit and the Public Security Department are staring their search. It takes time …

Rena: 
Unexcusable! How dare you treat it so lightly? Listen detective, I'm beginning to wonder if you truly are on my side. Can I trust you?

Oishi: 
Of course, you can. It's just that... Well, without evidence it's hard for us to move forward on this.

Rena: 
Evidence, huh. 

Oishi: 
Yeah.

Rena: 
I understand. If that's what's you need, then I'll give you Ms. Miyo's scrapbooks. That'll be all the evidence you'll need. With those you'll be able to convince every Police department in the area. 

Oishi: 
Thank you. That sounds very helpful indeed. I'll come by right now to pick them up from you.

Rena: 
No, Keiichi will take them to you.

Oishi: 
I'm Detective Oishi. We spoke on the phone.

Keiichi: 
I'm sorry, but Rena said that I shouldn't talk to you about anything but scrapbooks.

Oishi: 
I got you, kid. 

Kiichi: 
Huh?

Oishi: 
Don't worry about it. You're safe. Rena can't see you from this angle.

Keiichi: 
What is it?

Oishi: 
It's self-explanatory. Read the note on the way back.

Keiich: 
Oh.

Oishi: 
Umm.

Keiichi: 
Slip the ear piece on your ear and you and I can talk back and forth. The bottle is a Mace that has a reach up to one meter. Aim straight for the face.

Keiichi: 
Rena! What are you doing?

Rena: 
I'm spreading gasoline.

Keiichi: 
But why?

Rena: 
It's a backup plan in case of emergency.

Oishi: 
Gasoline?

Kumagai: 
If the fumes from that stuff are ignited, it's gonna cause a huge explosion. It would be big enough to blow up the entire school.

Officer: 
Un, Excuse me, Sir. We were going through the scrapbooks that were brought out earlier and we came across a letter that seems to have been written by the suspect.

Oishi: 
Give me that.

Rena: 
Chances are I'll claw at my throat and bleed to death tonight.
So I'm setting a cut-of time for our negotiations 7:00 pm today. 
If a massive investigation isn't underway by then, then I will go up in flames and take all these hostages with me.
The choice is yours.

Oishi:
Seven O'clock.

Kumagai: 
It's a few minute before 6:00 now.

Oishi:
And we've got an hour to fix this.

Rena: 
Aside from spreading the gas, I've devised another method to blow up the school. 
It's not complicated but It'll all work. It's a simple time bomb made with the gasoline and a kitchen timer.

Oishi:
The kitchen timer, Huh?

Rena: 
Everything is timed out, that would go up at 7:00 as well. 
I'm hoping this will encourage you to take actions a little more quickly than you have in the past.
Your friend and ally, Detective Oishi. 
Rena Ryugu. 

Oishi: 
Damn it! I ain't your ally, kid!

Keiichi: 
No, Rena! Stop!

Rena: 
Keiichi, You promised that you wouldn't move away from that wall.
Listen Mion, when you dug up those dead bodies, you betrayed me.
And I'll never forgive you for that. I trusted you! I trusted you!

Keiichi:
Rena! Please stop! Don't do this!

Rena:
Stay away! If you take one more step, I'm gonna send this whole place up in flames. 

(* Telephone rings *)

Rena:
Hello, Un, Oishi? What do you want? Yes, Yes, That's right, yes...

Kumagai:
Can you hear me. This is Kumagai. I work with Detective Oishi.
If you can hear me, cough. 

Keiichi:
(* cough *)

Kumagai:
Great! Now listen carefully what I'm going to tell you.
Rena told us that she has some sort of an explosive device on a timer somewhere. 
She said she used a kitchen timer to trigger it. Whatever it is, it's big enough to blow up the entire classroom.
According to her note, that timer is set to go off at 7:00 o'clock tonight.
That's in just 15 minutes.

Keiichi:
What? Fifteen minutes? What can I do?

Rena:
Yes, at 7 o'clock shot, the time is running out, detective. I suggest you hurry...

Kumagai:
Keiichi, it's up to you. You gotta find the bomb and turn it off.

Keiichi:
It's up to me? 

Kumagai:
I don't think it's on battery. Which means it's got be plugged into an outlet.
Look around the classroom. Is anything odd plugged into a wall?

Keiichi:
No.

Kumagai:
Well, then, maybe, she put it in another room.

Keiichi:
Are you asking me to search every room? It's just 15 minutes.

Rika:
Keiichi?

Keiichi:
Rika? Did you hear?

Rika:
Um.

Saoko:
Hey, no one in this class can set a trap like me. I don't know what the heck Rena is thinking. She can't take away my queen [of/the/de] fame.

Keiichi:
Hm, then I guess I should leave the trap finding up to our resident expert. All right, Satoko. If you're gonna blow up this whole room with the time bomb, where would you stash it?

Satoko:
Glad to see you finally got smart. Now allow me to show this entire class that Rena sillily set time bomb trap is nothing more than a work of an armature.

Rena:
That would be too late now wouldn't it? Listen, if you fail to take what I'm saying seriously, trust me you will deeply regret it.

Satoko:
You know, I bet she is running a cord to it somewhere. If we could find where the cord is then.

Keiichi:
Yap, I'll see what I can do.

Rena:
Do what? What's going on, Keiichi?

Keiichi:
Well, didn't you hear that really weird noise outside just now?

Rena:
No.

Keiichi:
Yeah, I don't know what it was.

Rena:
All right, Keiichi. Go check it out.

Keiichi:
Sure. You got it.

Rena:
There's one thing you shouldn't do. Make me mad.

Keiichi:
You can trust me.

Hey! What's this? 

I found it. Huh?

Rena:
Tell me, Keiichi. What are you doing standing in the closet with an alarm clock? Very odd? 

Keiichi:
Rena!

Rena:
I did what you asked. I trusted you.
Keiichi. You suck!

Keiichi:
Got it!

Satoko:
Keiichi, I did it! I found where the bomb is.

Rika:
Keiichi, I got this. Just hurry up and help Satoko. 

Keiichi:
But Rika...

Rika:
Don't worry. This isn't the first time I had to deal with her.
If I just had been more forceful when this'd come up before, we wouldn't be here right now.
However, now I know.

Satoko:
Keiichi, come on! We're running out of time.

Keiichi:
Sorry, Rika!

Rena:
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. You are so going to die. When Rena gets this angry, no one survive.

Rika:
You wanna play with me? Come on, Hatchet girl.

Keiichi:
What do you mean? 

Satoko
This morning. It's easy. Soon as I remembered it. Just think.

Classmate:
It smells bad outside.

Classmate:
Are you sure it's from outside?

Classmate:
Hey, my ball's missing again. Satoko! Where have you hid it this time?

Satoko:
What those girls were smelling this morning was gasoline!

Keiichi:
And the ball?

Satoko:
Well, I think she used the ball to put at the bottom of the rain gutter.
And then she went up to the second floor to pour gasoline into the gutter and filled the whole things up.

Keiichi:
So then that means in order for it to go off ...

Satoko:
The ignition would have to come from the room.

Keiichi:
Good work, Satoko!
All right, take care of the classroom.

Satoko:
Ah. Wait Keiichi! Take this.

Keiichi:
Thanks!

Satoko:
Nii-nii...

Keiichi:
Oishi, it's Keiichi. Can you hear me? I got the lighter from Rena.
The timer for the bomb has to be on the roof. I think it's in the rain gutter.

Oishi:
The rain gutter?

Kumagai:
He's got less than three minutes.

Oishi;
Un... Come on, Maebara.

Oishi;
Are you all right kid? Hurry! You got three minutes.

Kumagai:
He's got less than one now, sir.

Keiichi:
Just in time! Just in Time!

Oishi:
Yes! Get in there. Save those hostages. Arrest that girl started all this!

Kumagai:
Detective Oishi, it's the fire department, sir. They're saying all the fumes in the air have the potential for a huge problem.
They're suggesting we're getting our team out of there as soon as possible. 

Oishi:
Do what?

Kumagai:
They're saying even though the bomb has been taken out, this place could still go off.

Oishi:
Maebara still hasn't come out yet. 

Keiichi:
Rena!

Rena:
Well done. I can't believe how smart you are. You figured everything out. Guess it's all over now.

Keiichi:
Yap, that's right, Rena. Game over! 

Rena:
Well, I did everything I could to stop the aliens from advancing.
So if the human race perishes entirely, it will end up being your fault, Keiichi.

Keiichi:
Ha? Aliens? What kind of a person believes in aliens anyway? I know a stupid one.
If you really want me to buy end-all this alien crap, there is a pretty simple way we club members have set up to settle our disputes. 

Rena:
You're saying whoever wins gets to be right?

Keiichi:
You got it exactly.

Keiichi:
I can tell you right now. Rena, this is one match you're not gonna wanna lose.

Rena:
Why? If you win what are you gonna make me do?

Keiichi:
I think that would be pretty obvious. I'm gonna finally get my own maid. Your days will start with a “good morning” when I wake up, and end with a “good night” when I go to bed. And you will attend to my every need every point.

Rena:
Ahahahaha! I should have expected that from you.

Kumagai:
Leave it, Maebara! Just get out of there!
[Damn.] What do you wanna do! Huh, Oishi!

Oishi:
Uh, yeah.

Classmates:
Come on Keiichi, you can take her. Turn around, behind you. 

Officer:
Hey!

Mion:
Rika!

Keiichi:
Come on now Rena! Remember that time when you and I went on one-on-one with each other using water guns. You wanted it to be just like that again, didn't you?

Rena:
Yes. So what are you waiting for?

Keiichi:
Ha ha ha. Well, I guess I just can't get enough of this tension. I got chills running down my spine just thinking how this is gonna end.

Rena:
Well, don't complain to me when you lose!

Rika:
He might... Keiichi just might... … be able to find an exit from this tragic labyrinth.
We'll see.

Keiichi:
All right. I'm gonna make this perfectly clear. If I win it's gonna be nothing but personal service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
You're gonna introduce me as your master to every single person that we meet. You're gonna do it with a smile.

Rena:
Fine. But the outfit has to be really cute.

Keiichi:
Oh, I'll take care of that. Your master will have an array of outfits to choose from depending on my mood that day.

Rena:
I like it. I like it. I have no intention of losing, but if I did it, it sounds like a lot of fun.

Keiich:
So, what's it gonna be if you win? All right, I'll tell you what. If you win I'll believe everything you said tonight.
I totally believe that aliens are controlling the world and we need to stop them. Even if you start to claw at your own throat and die, I will be there for you through the whole thing, no matter what.

Rena:
Well, if I win, that really isn't any fun, is it?

Keiichi:
Well, what then? You wanna change it?

Rena:
If I win I wanna get the same thing you get if you win.

Keiichi:
What? You want me to be a maid?

Rena:
Well, you don't have to do the actual maid part. But everything else stays the same. 
You'll start my days with a “good morning” to me when I wake up, and end them with a “good night” as I go to bed.
You have to be really nice to me all the time... … and do little things for me, too, just to make me happy.
This way, it doesn't matter if you win or I win. Either way, no matter what happens you and I will be together.

Keiichi:
That's right. We'll be together. But we'll treat each other differently.

Rena:
Aha ha ha.

Keiichi:
I'll be the first to say it.

Rena:
Say what?

Keiichi:
This was kind of fun.

Rena:
It was fun. You are right.

Keiich:
Damn. You're good.

Rena:
That's it. The fight's over now, right?

Keiich:
No, not yet. This fight's not over 'til you swing that hatchet down and finish this. 

Rena:
I don't wanna. 

Keiichi:
Huh?

Rena;
I don't..., I don't want. Why did it end up like this? 
How did everything get so messed up and weird? I had friends and I knew I could believe in.
But somehow that stopped. Why did that stop? Why am I doing this to the people I love? Why in the world did I ever want to hurt them?

Keiichi:
So, then do you see it now? Do you see your sin?

Rena:
I took all the good times we had, and I totally destroyed them, and I don't know why.
Why would I do something like that?

Keiichi:
I gotta say you, Rena. You are pretty amazing.
You are able to see what you did wrong. You figured it out.
You're awesome. You know that, Rena. Good job.

Rena:
I hurt my friends. I did terrible things to Mion.

Keiichi:
Then apologize to her. And besides, Mion will probably like that scar. 
And top of that, now we can finally tell those two sisters apart. 
It was so simple. Anyone could have seen it. There it was right before our noses this whole time. 
Whenever anything happens whether it would be painful or sad or just playing bugs, when you wanna say something, tell your friends. That's what they're there for, to help you.

Rena:
Ya, You're right. You are totally right.


Rika:
Yes. It was indeed very simple. And right in front of them the entire time.
The key to so many things. To simply trust and forgive.
Trusting and forgiving was all they needed to defeat their inner demons and conquer their suspicions.
However, trusting and forgiving can't solve everything. Especially in Hinamizawa where so many mysteries remain to be solved.

Keiichi:
Damn it. Satoko, why you are so good.

Satoko:
Aha ha ha ha ha ha. It will take you a hundred thousand years before you can beat me.

Rika:
Wow, Satoko has her game face on. Then I should get serious, too.

Rena:
Fine then. If you get serious I get serious.

Mion:
Man! I love it! Things are stating to heat up. 

Chie:
You seem like you're having a lot of fun. I'm sorry to bother you. But it seems Rika has a visitor here to see her.

Rika:
Me?

Oishi:
So, on the night of the Cotton Drifting festival, Mr. Tomitake and Miss Takano died.

Rika:
Yes, this is how it goes. And I will gladly play this game during this month of June that never seems to end 
for as long as I want.
