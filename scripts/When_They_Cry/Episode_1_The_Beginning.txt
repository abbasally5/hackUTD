  Keiichi:
Morning.

Mother:
Morning.

Keiichi:
I'm outta here.

Mother:
Oh, Keiichi, do me a favor, tell Rena "Thank you for the pickles", okay?

Keiichi:
Got it.

Keiichi:
It's been about a month since I moved to Hinamizawa.
It's the first time I found out that the air can actually smell good.

Rena:
Hello, Keiichi.
Good morning to ya.

Keiichi:
So, you're early again.
You know, you could sleep in once in a while?

Rena:
But if I slept in, I'd run the risk of making you wait for me.

Keiichi:
What makes you think I'd wait?

Rena:
No!
Oh, Keiichi, that's mean.
Why wouldn't you wait for me?
I wait for you...

Keiichi
Don't get all upset.
I got better things to do.

Rena:
Why are you being like this? like this...?

Keiichi:
Relax.
Of course, I'd wait for you.

Rena:
Oh..., thanks...
That's nice of you.

Keiichi:
This odd little one walking next to me who blushes a lot, that's Rena Ryugu.
I've only known her for a few weeks but I already know that her name isn't the only weird thing about her.

Keiichi:
Oh yeah, [I almost forgot],
I got a message from my mom.
She wanted to say thanks for your pickles.

Rena:
No problem.
However she's welcome.

Mion:
Oh, there you are.
What's going on?
How come you're both so late?

Rena:
Hey, Mion.
Good morning.

Keiichi:
Yo!
You're the one who's always late.
Not us.

Mion:
Long time no see there, Keiichi.
How many years has it been now?

Keiichi:
I was only out for two days, Mion

Keiichi:
Unlike Rena, who's always so self-conscious, this one likes to set her own rules.
Her name's Mion Sonozaki.
She's an upperclassman, and pretty much the chick who runs the school.

Mion:
...big city again?

Keiichi:
I had to go there because of a funeral.
That's pretty much all we did the whole time.

Mion:
Well, did you come through for me and bring back what I asked you to?

Keiichi:
I didn't bring back crap!
I was at a freaking funeral, remember?

Keiichi:
Hinamizawa is a teeny little village.
The only school has one class room for everybody.
Our class is made up of about fifteen students total and all of different ages and different grades.
And we all share the same teacher.
I don't know how she does it.
It's got to be hard teaching all those different grades at the same time.
When other students need help, I sometimes end up having to teach Rena and Mion myself.


Rena:
Wow, Keiichi, you're a really good teacher.
Did you know that?
You make this easy.

Keiichi:
Oh man, I hate teaching you guys, it makes me realize just how little I really know...

Mion:
They say if you're gonna teach someone, then you'd better make sure you know it three times better than they do.


Keiichi:
Hey, what am I doing teaching you anyway?
Aren't you a grade higher than me?
You're the one who should be teaching me, you know?

Mion:
Yeah, whatever, details, details.

Rena:
By the way Keiichi, I was wondering what you're doing tomorrow.
You got any plans yet, do ya?


Keiichi:
Huh?

Mion:
Correct me if I'm wrong.
But you're still havin' a hard time finding your way around Hinamizawa, right?

Keiichi:
Yeah, kinda... I still can't figure out how to get anywhere besides school and the center of town.


Rena:
That's what I thought.
So, tomorrow Mion and Rena are gonna do Keiichi a favor.
We're gonna show you around all of Hinamizawa by taking a bit long walk through the whole area, OK?
I was gonna make a lunch for all of us too, are you interested?


Mion:
Yeah, come on!
It'll be great?

Keiichi:
Sure.
If I'm free.

Mion:
Yo! What's up with your attitude?
You've got two girls asking you out here, you little punk!

Keiichi:
I said "if I'm free".

Rena:
Well, Keiichi?
Are you gonna be free tomorrow? Are you?

Keiichi:
Yeah, I'm free.

Mion:
Ah!

Rena:
Happy now!

Mion:
All right, what's your deal, dude?
How come you treat her whole a lot better than you treat me, huh!?

Keiichi:
Rena, maybe just the two of us should hook up tomorrow.

Rena:
Sure if that's what you like, Keiichi.

Mion:
What are you talking about!?
I'm the one who suggested to stroll out in the first place!

Rena:
This place is called the "Furude Shrine".
I don't think there's anywhere around here with a better view.

Keiichi:
Great...

Mion:
There'll be a big festival up here during the next break.

Keiichi:
Cool...

Rena:
Ta-dah!
Rena's deluxe lunch box special prepared especially for you.


Keiichi:
Wow, Rena.
That's a lot of food.

Rika:
Hope we are not interruptin'


Mion:
Oh, there you are.

Keiichi:
Hey, it's Satoko and Rika.
These girls are in my class too.
Satoko Hojyo and Rika Furude.
This may go without saying, but they're a few grades younger than me.


Satoko:
What's going on?
What's with all the excitement?

Keiichi:
Can't you see for yourself?
We're about to dig in this awesome lunch that Rena made for us.


Satoko:
I can see that, you idiot!
I'm not stupid, you know?
What I wanted to know is why you three are getting all cozy in someone else's front yard.

Keiichi:
Oh, back off!
This shrine is public property.
Stop acting like you own the place.


Rika:
Actually Keiichi's right on this one.
In a way, it's anybody's front yard.

Keiichi:
Ooh...
Rika is always such a good little girl.
Sit next to me, Rika.
I'd be happy to share with you.

Satoko:
Oh, well, there is nothing I can do.
It looks like you've left me no choice but to just sit down and join all of you.

Keiichi:
No you won't .
There's not enough room for you, and there's not enough food, either.

Satoko:
Yes, there is!

Rena:
Alright, alright.
Stop it, you guys.
If Satoko wants to join us, there's plenty of food for her.

Keiichi:
Nuh-uh! 
 Because I'm planning on eating Satoko's share, too.

Satoko:
No, because I'm not gonna let you!

Rika:
Here, have some chopsticks.

Satoko:
Wow, I get to eat this whole spread!

Keiichi:
No you won't, not if I eat it first!

Mion:
Just look at 'em.
It's so nice to be young.


Keiichi:
What do you doing?!
That was mine!

Rena:
Go on, eat up, everyone.
No need to be shy.
There's plenty of food.

Keiichi:
Come to daddy, beef patty.

Satoko:
If you think I'm gonna let you have that, you're crazy!

Keiichi:
Ooh, elbowing should really be against the rules.

Satoko:
Oh, there were rules?

Rena:
Eating lunch together is so much fun, so much fun, I like it!

Rika:
Well, Rena, this lunch you made is really delicious.

Mion:
Well..I think it's time we call it a day.
All right guys, see you later.

Keiichi:
Thanks for putting this together today, Mion.
I had a good time.

Rena:
Well, see you tomorrow.

Mion:
Yep.

Rena:
I'm glad you were able to hang out with us today, Keiichi.
I had fun.
Did you have fun, too?

Keiichi:
Yep. I really enjoyed it.
In fact, I had so much fun, and I almost don't feel like going home.

Rena:
Then maybe, if you don't mind we can go someplace that I think it's fun, can we?

Keiichi:
OK.
But where?
Is it far?

Rena:
Well, it's a little bit of a walk, but not that bad.
C'mon, follow me.

Keiichi:
Wait!

Rena:
I haven't been here for some time now
I wonder what's there, I wonder what's there.

Keiichi:
You're saying it's been a while since you'd been to this place..., you mean a garbage dump!?

Rena:
Yeah, but it's not garbage to me.
When I look around, all I see are mountains of treasure!
Look, a brand-new mountain over there!
Yippee, yippee, it's a good day!

Keiichi:
Hey, wait!
Owhao!
Ow...

Rena:
If you want to, you can stay there, I don't mind. I'll just be a few minutes.

Keiichi:
Are all girls from the country, like this...?

Keiichi:
Eah?

Tomitake:
Ah?

Keiichi:
Ahh?

Tomitake:
You kinda surprised me.

Keiichi:
Really? 'cause that's what I was just about to say.

Tomitake:
Sorry about that.
I wasn't trying to sneak up on you, I promise.
So tell me, are you a local?
Are you from Hinamizawa?

Keiichi:
Yeah, sort of.

Tomitake:
My name is Tomitake.
I'm a freelance photographer.
I come to Hinamizawa every now and then for work.

Keiichi:
Hey, eh, Isn't it a professional protocol to ask somebody before you take their picture?

Tomitake:
Sorry, my bad.
I'm usually taking pictures of wild birds.
I've never tried asking them, but maybe I should.
Hahahahaha hahahahaha haha...ha...
Yeah...

Rena:
Keiichi, sorry for making you wait so long.
I'm almost done here, I promise

Tomitake:
Oh, you've got company.
Is she looking for something specific down there or just digging around?

Keiichi:
Nah, I don't know.
Maybe she's looking for that dead body she chopped up a few months back.

Tomitake:
That was a horrible crime.
They're still missing one of the arms, aren't they.

Keiichi:
missing...what?

Rena:
Ahaha, thanks for waiting, Keiichi.

Tomitake:
Well, I should probably get going before they kick me out of here.
Sorry for sneaking up on you like that, Keiichi.
Take it easy.

company:友達, 連れ horrible:恐ろしい; ひどく嫌な

Rena:
You waited. You waited. Thank you.


Keiichi:
Well, tell me how did it go?
Find anything good down there?


Rena:
Yeah, I did. I did really good.
I found the most awesome thing ever.
The Kenta doll.


Keiichi:
What do you mean the Kenta doll?
Are you talking about that gigantic plastic doll they had it standing in front of the fried chicken place?


Rena:
Yeah, that's it exactly!
He's really cute.
I wanna take him home with me.


Keiichi:
Well, it's just trash, right?
I'm sure if you wanna take him home, nobody's gonna mind.


Rena:
Yep,but...
Unfortunately he's trapped under a huge pile of junk.
I tried digging him out by myself but I couldn't.


Keiichi:
How about I'll help you out with it tomorrow then?
In exchange for that killer lunch you made today.


Rena:
Thank you.
Keiichi is gonna help me free my treasure.
Then I can take him home and have him myself.


Keiichi:
Hey, Rena. Has something bad ever taken place in this garbage dump?


Rena:
I heard they were trying to build the dam here a while ago.
But that's all I really know about it.


Keiichi:
They tried to build the dam?
Well then, maybe something happened like a construction accident?
Is that possible?


Rena:
I don't know.
You see, I was living somewhere else up until last year.


Keiichi:
Really?
Then you're a transfer student, too.
I just assumed you were born here.


Rena:
No, I transferred.
So I don't know too much about what happened before I got here.
Sorry, Keiichi.


Keiichi:
That's OK.
No biggie.

Student A:
Bye.

Student B:
See you later.


Mion:
Alright. In accordance with the rules of our club, I'd like to debate a brand-new subject today.
Let's see a show of hands from the people in the room who think it's a good idea to make Keiichi Maebara the newest member to our little club.

Rena:
I don't object.

Satoko:
Ohohohohohoho!
Well, if the little peasant can keep up with me, then I guess I'm ok with it.

Rika:
Satoko and I think it would be a nice suggestion to our club.

Mion:
Then it's unanimous! Congratulations, Keiichi Maebara!
You're now officially a member of our club!

Keiichi:
Hey, hold on!
What are you talking about!
What makes you think I wanna join this club of yours, anyway.
I don't even know what the heck this thing's about.

Mion:
Our club tries to counter increasingly complicated actions of society and through either prosperity or adversity, our activities are predicated upon the belief that no matter what happens, we must always follow up.

Rika:
I think what she is trying to say is all we do is sit around and play games.

Keiichi:
Now, it's starting to make sense.

Mion:
Let me make one thing clear.
the competition is fierce and we never play anything lame like house.
So if you suck, you're gonna hate.

Keiichi:
Why do you take it so seriously? Why don't we just have some fun?

Mion:
Yeah, right!
Club rule number one, always play to win no matter what.
You have to put forth nothing less than your best effort. Do you understand?

Satoko:
Which brings us to rule number two, if you wanna stay in the club, then you must do everything in your part to win it all times.

Keiichi:
Alrigt. Alright. I get it.

Mion:
Complicated games will probably put Keiichi at too much of a disadvantage, so why don't we pick a game today that everybody's familiar with.
Here's my suggestion. How do you all feel about Old Maid?

Keiichi:
That sounds perfect.

Mion:
And for the punishment game, I say the winner can do whatever they want to the person who's last.
How does that sound to you guys, huh?

Satoko:


Mion:
Okay, let's shuffle the deck!

Rena:
I'll start it with this one.

Keiichi:
These cards are worn out. It looks like you had'em forever.
I bet you can tell which is which just from all the scratches and bends on the back of these guys.
Ew! Oh, come on! That's totally not fair.
That's cheating.

Satoko:
Rule number two, cleary state that you're required to do everything in your part to win it at all times.

Rena:
Don't worry Keiichi, a lot of marks on these cards are obvious.
I'm sure you'll catch on in no time.

Keiichi:
Fine. That's how you wanna play?
I'll take all you cheaters on and I bet you I still win.

Mion:
Hey, Keiichi.
I'm gonna read your cards from right to left.
Three, four, nine, jack, queen!

Keiichi:
Wow!

Rika:
By the way, it's not just the jack, it's the jack of hearts

Satoko:
You can shuffle them all you want.
I can still read them. I'm out.

Keiichi:
Waaahhh!
Oh, you're evil, you're all completely evil.
Except for Rena.
You're not evil, are you?

Rena:
I'm sorry Keiichi, but you got the three of hearts right here, don't you?
I'm out too.
Maybe this isn't fair. If we're gonna keep playing, we should use a new deck
Keiichi seems to be having a hard time.

Mion:
Trust me. It's fine.
He is a man. He can handle it.
You are up for a little challenger, aren't you, Keiichi?

Rika:
Yeah, you can do it, can't ya?

Mion:
Oh, come on, Keiichi. What are you thinking?
You can't hide it. The dog-eared card on the left, that one's the two of diamonds, isn't it?
What the?

Rena:
Wow! Mion knows those cards inside and out.
She hardly ever makes a mistake.

Mion:
No, you didn't.
Keiichi, what have you done to these cards?

Keiichi:
I so got you Mion Sonozaki.

Satoko:
You made some other card look just like the two of diamonds?
Wow! That was pretty clever for a guy like you.

Rika:
Way to go!
Way to really stick to it this time.

Rena:
I can't believe it, Keiichi.
You did it! You got her! Nice job!

Mion:
I have to admit, I knew all along that you had then you, but you kinda surprised me on this one.
It's more impressive than I expected.

Satoko:
Unfortunately that brilliant move came a little too late.

Keiichi:
Yeah, I know I still end up in last place.
But as long as I can come away from this game taking a dig at Mion.
l'm good with it. Ew!

Mion:
Well, loser, I think it's time for the punishment game now.
Seeing how this is your first day in our club, I'll be nice and go easy on ya.
After all I don' wanna traumatize you so much that you don't show up to school tomorrow.
Here I come... Get ready...

Keiichi:
No!



Mion:
She wants to get the kenta doll?
Oh, Ｉ get it.
I guess that's why Rena tore out of there so fast today.

Keiichi:
I can't believe she thinks that thing is cute.
She could be pretty weird sometimes.


Mion:
Yeah, some of her hobbies are rather odd.
I mean once she finds, something she thinks it's cute, there isn't anything you can say that's gonna tear her away from it.

Keiichi:
Hey, about that place, the old construction site, it kinda seems like something bad happened there.

Mion:
Something did.
Governmental officials came by one day and threatened to kick us out of the village so they could build the dam there.

Keiichi:
They were gonna kick you out?

Mion:
Yeah, they were. So we decided to fight them.
Everyone joined in.
And I suppose if we hadn't, this whole village would probably be underwater right about now.

Keiichi:
Wow, I'm surprised you guys actually won.
I mean it was the government you were going up against

Mion:
Well, everyone in the village with power including the village leader pulled together and petitioned anyone they could.
They even went to Tokyo so they could negotiate with the politicians there.
In the midst of all that, the plan's eventually got withdrawn.
And that's how the little guys took down the big guys.

Keiichi:
Interesting...were there any major clashes between you guys and them, you know like murder or assault or anything like that?

Mion:
No...nothing.

Keiichi:
Eh? o...okay

Mion:
Okay, then, see you tomorrow.
And that ink'd better stay on your face until you get home.
You got that, Keiichi?

Keiichi:
Fine, whatever, I'll leave it on then.


Rena:
Whoo...

Keiichi:
What's up? Rena?
Working hard, are ya?

Rena:
What a surprise!
Hey, Keiichi, what are you doing here?

Keiichi:
I received urgent information on an innocent victim and I'm here to assist,so where is this person? How can I help?

Rena:
Huh? No? No victim.

Keiichi:
Acording to my report , some dastardly devil's taken the kenta doll and buried him alive in garbage.

Rena:
Oh, now I get it.
Sorry, I wasn't following.

Keiichi:
So, come on.
Where is this guy, anyway?

Rena:
Oh, okay, He is right over here.
Look! He is buried pretty deep.
Can you see him?

Keiichi:
Whoa! He really was buried alive.
I'm afraid if we're gonna get this guy out of here, we're gonna need an ax or something,

Rena:
Ah, hey, wait right here. okay?

Keiichi:
Eh?
Hey!



Tomitake:
That was a horrible crime.
They're still missing one of the arms, aren't they?

Keiichi:
Ah! There it is.
Horrible tragedy at the Hinamizawa dam.
Lynched and hacked to pieces.
The murderers viciously attacked the victim with hatchets and pick axes.
After torturing the victim, they used an ax to cut the corpse in the six parts, head, arms, legs and torso.
One of the murderers is still on the loose?!

Rena:
I don't know.

Mion:
No, nothing.

Keiichi:
It's true.
There was a murder.
You know, looking back at that moment,
I can't help but think...that what all those screaming cicadas were really trying to do that night
was warning, warn me about everything that was about to go wrong.

Can you believe what you see?
Can you believe in the living?
Can you believe in me?
