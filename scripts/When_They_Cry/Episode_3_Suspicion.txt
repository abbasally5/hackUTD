  Keiichi:
Well, what about the lady's missing kid?

Oishi:
Yeah, Kid's about a year older than you are or was.

Oishi:
Got his name right here. Satoshi Houjou.

Keiichi:
Huh..? Satoshi?

Keiichi:
What's that for?

K1's dad:
Wasn't Rena here just a minute ago?

Keiichi:
Rena... was..

Keiichi:
I was positive Rena was there a minute ago...

Keiichi:
I was sure of it.. She'd been standing right outside my room the entire time.

Keiichi:
She heard everything I said to detective Oishi...!

K1's mom:
What's wrong, Keiichi?
You look really pale today.

Keiichi:
Yeah.. I think I have a cold...
Maybe even a fever..

K1's mom:
Oh, that's Rena.
I think she's here to get you.

Keiichi:
I don't think I'm going to school today.

K1's mom:
OK, I'll go dowm and tell Rena.

Keiichi:
OK...

Nurse:
Mr.Maebara, please come into the exam room.

Irie:
You have a cold, alright.
I'm going to have to give you a shot, OK?

Keiichi:
OK, thanks.

Nurse:
Take care.

Nurse:
The doctor will see whoever's next.

Old womanA:
Did that really happen?

Old womanB:
Was she spirited away by the demon?

Old womanC:
But she so young!
She probably eloped or something.

Old womanA:
Well, then who did she elope with?

Old womanC:
Remember the man who was from Tokyo, the one with the camera.
Probably with him.

Old womanB:
That Takano was a strong young lady.
She'll be fine no matter where she lives.

Keiichi:
Takano..? Oh... her..

Nurse:
Mr.Maebara?

Keiichi:
Right here.

Oishi:
Hello there, Mr.Maebara!
You missed school?
How come?

Keiichi:
Yeah, you see, I wasn't really feeling well... so I didn't go...

Oishi:
I was about to go into town to get myself some lunch.
You wanna come with me to Okinomiya?
Lunches are on me.

Keiichi:
Oh... sure...

Oishi:
I gotta say.
Ever since that Satoshi kid went missing last year, I've been suspicious.
I checked out his friends.
They're your friends now.
Anyway, I gave that whole group of kids the once-over, and I found out a couple of interesting things.

Keiichi:
Huh?

Oishi:
The first guy that got killed during the festival was the director of the dam's construction site.
A couple of weeks before his death, it seems he had a few fights with Mion Sonozaki.
Interesting, right?

Keiichi:
With Mion?

Oishi:
The couple that died during the next year's festival.
The one supporting the dum project..
They had a daughter who was with them when they died... and her name is none other than Satoko Houjo.

Keiichi:
What?
Satoko Ho...Satoko?

Oishi:
Next year the priest and his wife also died during the festival.
They had a daughter and her name is Rika Furude.

Keiichi:
Rika was there.

Oishi:
The housewife killed during the next year's festival was Satoko Hojou's aunt by marriage.
Both she and her husband were taking care of Satoko, because her parents died the year before.
And the boy... Satoshi Houjo disappeared around the same time.
He is Satoko's brother.
And he is related to her by birth.

Keiichi:
Ah...

Oishi:
All these mysterious deaths that happened all over the last four years.
They all happened during the festival, and they're all conected to your group of friends.

Keiichi:
This is crazy!
It has to be a coincidence!

Oishi:
All right, son. Calm down.
People are looking over here.

Keiichi:
I'm..I'm sorry...

Oishi:
Until last year Rena Ryugu lived in a suburb of the Ibaraki prefecture.

Keiichi:
Ah, that's right! Rena's different.

Oishi:
Yeah, well, when we investigated, we found out that Miss Ryugu was suspended from school. That happened just a couple of weeks before she moved to Hinamizawa.

Keiichi:
Huh?

Oishi:
The story goes she decided to go around the school one day and smash out all the windows.

Keiichi:
She did ... what?

Oishi:
She was taken to a neurologist to find out why she did it.
They just give her some pills and some counceling.

Keiichi:
A neurologist...what?

Oishi:
The doctor was very thorough.
He kept detailed records of everything she said during their sessions, and there's one name that keeps popping up in those records.

Keiichi:
Whose name?
Tell me...

Oishi:
I'm afraid the name was Oyashiro.
She said he stands by her bed every night, looks down to her while she's sleeping.
It wasn't too long after that little ordeal that she moved to Hinamizawa.

Keiichi:
But then, if Rena was an outsider...

Oishi:
Hate to tell you this, son, but Rena is not an outsider.

Keiichi:
Eh?

Oishi:
I checked the town's residency records.
The Ryugu family used to live in Hinamizawa.
They moved to Ibaraki around the time that Rena was supposed to enter grade school.

Keiichi:
Then, what about...Jiro Tomitake, the last victim, what about him?
Who's he connected to?

Oishi:
Everybody.
Don't tell me you've already forgotten.
Somehow all the victims of these murders share the connection to your little group of friends, kid.

Keiichi:
Why...why are you telling me this?

Oishi:
Listen up, son.
A person in danger is actually you!

Mion:
So how are you feeling?

Keiichi:
OK.

Rena:
I'm glad you look OK. We were worried about you.

Keiichi:
Sorry about that.

Mion:
If you ask me, you still look a little green around the gills.

Keiichi:
Really?

Rena:
We brought you some sweet and red beans sticky rice that Mion's grandma made.

Keiichi:
Cool.
Thanks.

Rena:
Yep, and there's one that I made too.
I made it special and it's in the box with the others.
I wonder if you'll be able to guess which one it is?

Mion:
OK.
For skipping club today, that's gonna be your homework assignment.
We put a letter on each of them. So pick which one Rena made and tell us tomorrow.

Keiichi:
Huh, wait, did you guys come here to visit me or did you only come here because of the club?

Mion:
You look totally fine.
I bet by tomorrow you'll be feeling awesome.

Rena:
Hey Mion, let's go.
We're making way too much noise.

Mion:
You're right.
By the way, Keiichi.


What's now?


Mion:
I was wondering.
What did you have for lunch?

Keiichi:
I went out to get something to eat.

Rena:
You went out to get something to eat...

Mion:
How was it? Was it good?

Keiichi:
Yeah...

Mion:
Look to me like you're having lunch with some old geezer, right Keiichi...
Who was he?

Rena:
You can tell us ?
Is he the man from before? Is he?

Keiichi:
But how...how do you know...

Mion:
So, what are you two talking about over lunch?
It looked like you're getting really excited over something.

Keiichi:
I didn't talk about you guys...

Rena:
Something smells fishy here.

Mion:
Well, it doesn't matter what you're trying to hide.
I will always know what you're doing and when and where.
I hope you won't forget that, Keiichi.

Rena:
Keiichi, you look really pale.
Maybe you should lie down for a little while.

Mion:
I agree.
We're gonna leave now.
One more thing, please don't be absent tomorrow.

Keiichi:
How did... how did they know that?

......, !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A... needle!?

Keiichi:
I don't know why.
But I'm sure they are trying to kill me.
Damn it!
No way!
I'm not gonna let 'em take me out that easy!...No matter what!

Keiichi:
My name is Keiichi Maebara.
And I'm in danger of being killed.
I don't really know why.
And I don't even know who would do it.
The only thing I do know is that it has something to do with the curse of Oyashiro...OK...

Older Folk:
Oh, Keiichi. You're up early.
Why aren't you with your friends?

Keiichi:
I woke up early today.

Older Folk:
I'll say. Take care then.

Keiichi:
I woke up early. Yeah, right.
As if I could sleep, It didn't matter...
Because I knew exactly what I had to do...

Man:
Damn it!

Keiichi:
They just tried to kill me...!?

Keiichi:
I can't let my guard down like that ever again.
I have to protect myself.
Perfect!

Rika:
Good morning, Keiichi.

Satoko:
Oh, wow, you're super early today, Keiichi!
What happened?

Keiichi:
Nothing...

Satoko:
Why are you wearing your PE clothes then?

Keiichi:
Nothing...I mean...I don't know.
I guess I felt out of shape...so I...
So I was thinking of practicing my swings.
Wait I...

Rika:
Well, I think taking care of your health is really really good thing to do, Keiichi.

Keiichi:
Ah, yeah.

Rika:
But make sure whatever you do, you don't lose that bat, OK?

Mion:
Hey, Keiichi. What's with you?
I was surprised to hear that you'd come to school early.
What're you doing, anyway?

Keiichi:
I'm practicing my swings.
Can't you tell?
For the National finals.

Mion:
You're kidding.
Alright, good luck.

Keiichi:
Damn it!

Mion:
Alright, let's go everyone!
It's time for us to have our club!

Rena:
What are we gonna play today? today!

Satoko:
I refuse to lose.

Mion:
Hey Keiichi, you're going home?

Keiichi:
I don't feel like it today.
Can you guys just leave me alone for a bit?

Rena:
Keiichi... why don't you want to hang on play with us anymore...don't you like us, don't you?

Keiichi:
That's not it.

Keiichi:
What do you want?!

Rena:
...Nothing...

Keiichi:
What happened to the club, huh?

Rena:
I was worried about you so I...

Keiichi:
Don't follow me anymore.
I said, "Don't follow me!".

Rena:
But Keiichi, I have to go this way my house's over there.

Keiichi:
Then go ahead of me.
You go first and then I'll go.

Rena:
Keiichi, I just wanna...

Keiichi:
Hurry up and go!
Now!

Rena:
I will, but...please put that bat down first.
You scaring me.

Keiichi:
Keep on walking!

Rena:
...Can I ask you something?

Keiichi:
What?

Rena:
Why are you carrying the same baseball bat?

Keiichi:
What're you talking about?

Rena:
I was... Well, I was wondering why you were carrying the same bat.

Keiichi:
I have no idea what you are even saying.
Tell me what you mean!

Rena:
Why are you...carrying the same baseball bat as Satoshi?

Keiichi:
Satoshi? This...!?
I guess I just borrowed it.
I mean... who cares?

Rena:
That's not what I'm saying!
Why're you doing that!?
Tell me, why're you doing everything the same as Satoshi!

Keiichi:
What is... What's the same...

Rena:
Even though he joined the team, he never played any sports...

Keiichi:
So what!?

Rena:
And just like you, Satoshi also started walking to school alone one day...alone just like you...
And then one day...Suddenly...he started practicing swinging his bat!
Just like you, and then...one day...He suddenly started carrying a baseball bat around all the time!
Just like you!
And then...one day...suddenly...suddenly...

Keiichi:
One day...suddenly...what?
What happened to Satshi?
Answer me, Rena!
What happened to Satshi?

Rena:
I already told you, Keiichi.
Satoshi transferred.
He went to another school.

Keiichi:
He...transferred...out?

Rena:
You won't do that, will you Keiichi?

Keiichi:
I...won't do what?

Renna:
Transfer out.

Keiichi:
Hello?

Mom:
Oh, Keiichi?

Keiichi:
Hi, mom.

Mom:
It was all at last minute so we didn't get to tell you this morning.
Your father and I have to go to Tokyo because of work.

Keiichi:
Right now?

Mom:
No. Sorry, I meant we were already here.
We left a little before noon.

Keiichi:
But why do you guys leave?

Mom:
I'm sorry son, your father's contract isn't going very well.
We'll be back home tomorrow night, I promise.
Are you sure you're going to be okay there all by yourself?

Keiichi:
Well, it's not like it's gonna kill me.

Mom:
Okay, by then.
Make sure you wake up on time tomorrow.
And don't forget to eat, okay?

Keiichi:
Yeah, yeah. I got it.

Keiichi:
Hello?

Oishi:
Evening.
Terribly sorry for calling at this hour.
My name is Oishi, from the Okinomiya Bookstore.

Keiichi:
Oh, detective Oishi.

Oishi:
Hey there, son.
How're you doing?
Noticed anything odd lately?

Keiichi:
Well, you could say that, yeah.
I think that... someone's trying to kill me.

Oishi:
You serious?

Keiichi:
It could just be a coincidence but, well, there was a needle in this dessert that Rena and Mion gave me when they visited the other night.
I mean thank god I didn't swallow it, but isn't that kinda...

Oishi:
What kinda needle?

Keiichi:
I guess, well, I think it was just a regular sewing needle.

Oishi:
That's not what I mean.
The needle, where is it?
It could be evidence.
We may be able to use it as a proof of the threat.

Keiichi:
I can't find it.
I was kind of in the panic at that time, I wasn't thinking.

Oishi:
I see.

Keiichi:
Something else did happen, though.
This morning...

Oishi:
Did you get the van's licence-plate number?

Keiichi:
No, I didn't get it.
I only know that it was a white van.
Rena knows about Satoshi being spritted away by the demon.
She knows something.

Oishi:
Can you be specific?

Keiichi:
She said I was acting like Satoshi.
She told me that if I keep acting like him, I'm gonna end up like him.

Oishi:
End up how?

Keiichi:
She said I'd be transferred.

Oishi:
Transferred?

Keiichi:
Truth is, I think Rena...

Don't fear the days that lie ahead.
Don't injure your heart.
Don't apologize for the past.
