  Keiichi:
Hey, Rena.
 I think I'm gonna skip school for the next couple of days.

Rena:

Seems like the police really are trying the best to find them.
 We just can't lose hope...for their sake, OK?

Keiichi:
So, you are not gonna ask me any questions?
 You know, don't you? About that night?

Rena:
Are you talking about how you snuck into the shrine?

Keiichi:
I don't know what I was thinking.
 Of course, you know.

Rena:
Mion was really really mad.

Rena:
No one has actually punished you for what you did yet, have they?
Well, I think it's about time that I step up and take care of that for everyone.

Keiichi:
I'm sorry. I've really screwed up.

Keiichi:
Hey, wait a second. What's this?

 If you want some, let me know. Mion.

Keiichi:
Rena. Have you known about this all along?

Keiichi:
All right. I'm going to Mion's place.
 I need to apologize.


Oishi:
Interesting. So tell me.
 Don't you both feel better now that you've gotten all that off your chest?

Kumagai:
Kumagai to Oishi. Are you there?

Oishi:
Yeah. This is Oishi. What's up?

Kumagai:
I got a [work/word] from the school that she called in sick today.
And there has been no movement at all from the Sonozaki house.
So I'm guessing the target is still inside.

Oishi:
Got it. Maintain surveillance.

Kumagai:
Yes, sir.

Keiichi:
Um.

Oishi:
Oops, You shouldn't have heard that.
 We haven't got any clearance from the chief, even for a secret surveillance.
 It's the best we can do, since we can't seem to get a search warrant to actually enter the place.
 Without a warrant, we're just sitting around with our hands in our pockets.
 The only other option is trying catch them red-handed.

Rena:
Tell me, Mr. Oishi.
 But you're really trying to do here is to convince my friend Keiichi to go inside Mion's house for you and snoop around a little bit, aren't you?

Keiichi:
Huh?

Rena:
But what you really want is something bad to happen to him in there, so you could have a probable cause to go inside.
 Tell the truth.
 You don't care if Keiichi gets hurt or not, do you?

Oishi:
Well, well, well.
 Looks like I got myself a little Sharlock Homes in the back seat.

Rena:
Shame on you.
 Police are supposed to help the people they protect.

Keiichi:
Rena? Wait.

Oishi:
Oishi to Kumagai. Over.

Keiichi:
This forest and all this mountain is all part of their property?

Keiichi:
Mion. Listen.
 I came here to apologize.

Mion:
Apologize? For what?

Keiichi:
On the night of the "Cotton Drifting Festival", I snuck into the shrine with all the ritual tools.
 I knew it was wrong.
 I knew I shoudn't be there.
 But it was just sort of this little innocent side trip.
 I didn't mean anything by it, I promise.
 I'm sorry. Please forgive me.
 I know a couple of days have passed since I did it.
 But I hope it's not too late to apologize.
 I'm really sorry.

Mion:
Well, I guess if you come in here, and tell me that you're sorry, then everything can just go back to normal.

Rena:
Mion, Keiichi is trying to offer you the most sincere apology he can.
 Don't you think that the least you could do in return is to try to take it somewhat seriously? Don't you?

Mion:
I am taking him seriously.
 What's the matter?
 Do I not look serious enough for you?

Rena:
No. You do.
 Keiichi, that's not going to be enough.
 Tell her everything.
 It seems like that's the only thing that will make Mion happy.

Keiichi:
Mion. You called Rika and Satoko over to your house two days ago, didn't you?

Rena:
From what we were able to deduce, Rika probably came over here in the evening sometime right before dinner.
 She came here with a big bottle of soy sauce thinking you were gonna give her some of your own.
 She came here without knowing what you had in mind.
 And then you spiritted her away.
 It was supposed to end there actually.
 That's what you thought, anyway.

Mion:
What do you mean that's what I thought.

Rena:
You didn't factor in the possibility that Rika would tell Satoko where she was going.
 And that was a mistake.
 Satoko had just made dinner for two that night.
 But she left it completely untouched inside the refrigerator.
 This actually speaks volumes about the conversation you had when Satoko called your house to check on Rika's whereabouts.

Mion:
Bravo.
 Nicely done.
 That's it.
 I give up.
 Dammit.

Rena:
So, did you kill the village leader, too?

Keiichi:
And what about Mr. Tomitake and Miss Takano?

Mion:
It's nice to meet you two.
 Let me introduce myself.
 I'm the heir to the head of the Sonozaki family.
 My name is Mion Sonozaki.

Mion:
It is my intention to speak openly and honestly regarding any of the events that have recently transpired.
 Well, either of you are aware [of/what] one time Hinamizawa used to be called Onigafuchi, village of the demons?
 The ancestors of Onigafuchi village were a dedicated group of wise men and women who were descended from demon blood.
 But the people from the surrounding villages had despised us and threw rocks at us, calling us demons whenever they were in our presence.
 To defend ourselves, the people of Hinamizawa banded together.
 They formed a faction of people who would war at any kind of attacks.
 Remember those punks who threatened you by the diner?
 Do you remember how the whole town came out to protect you?
 That's what that comes from.
 If Hinamizawa could be as righteous and revered as when it was called Onigafuchi village, then the descendants of this town would finally see their dream come true.
 The Sonozaki family shares that dream as well as the blood of the demon.

Keiichi:
What do you mean you share the blood of the demon?

Mion:
For each generation, it's customary for the heir of the Sonozaki family to have the character for demon in their name.

Keiichi:
There is a demon character in your name, in the "Mi" part.

Mion:
The demon doesn't just stop with my name.
 In addition to that, a demon has been engraved in my body as well.

Rena:
It's OK, Mion. You don't have to show Keiichi that if you don't want to.

Mion:
Very well, then.
 Let me address all the deaths so over the last five years.
 There are some that I was directly involved with, and others that I was indirectly involved with.
 There were also a few that didn't just involve the Sonozaki family but three other families from the village, however I was in the center of all of them.

Rena:
Mion, tell us the truth.
 Did you really kill our friends Rika and Satoko?

Mion:
I won't lie to you.
 This demon I have goes far beyond my name and my body.
 He's at the very center of my soul.

Rena:
But you must have some control over him, or one person still wouldn't be alive right now.

Mion:
It's true.
 I have no idea why he isn't dead yet.
 As a demon, it serves me no purpose to keep him alive.
 Perhaps Mion has some reason for not killing him.

Keiichi:
What does that mean?

Rena:
Shh.

Mion:
Oishi is out there, isn't he?

Rena:
Yeah, maybe.

Mion:
Can I escape?

Rena:
No. Probably not.
 Just turn yourself in.
 We'll go with you and make sure you don't get hurt.
 You still are our friend, Mion.
 No matter what happens, we won't leave you.

Mion:
Looks like you got me, doesn't it, Rena?
 All right.
 Before I turn myself in, I'd like to have a little time along with Keiichi, if I could.

Mion:
Is it all right if I hold your arm?

Keiichi:
Yeah, I guess that's OK.

Mion:
Seems Shion liked you just as much as I did.

Keiichi:
Oh, really?

Mion:
By the way, she's still alive, you know?

Keiichi:
What? Where is she?

Mion:
Come on, if you're up to it, I can show you all my crimes.
 Although there is not much [we/you] can do about it, for the most part what's done is done.

Keiichi:
You can show me whatever you want.
 It won't change the fact that Mion Sonozaki is the best friend that [I'd/I've] ever [have/had].
 That's never gonna change. I promise.

Mion:
When things are at their worst, you and Rena can be really awesome to have around.

Mion:
If you wanna turn around and go back, do it now.

Keiichi:
If I have to keep saying this, I will.
 No matter what you've done, you're still my friend.

Mion:
I think I see now why Mion liked you so much.

Keiichi:
Is this really just a store of farm tools?
 Mion?

Mion:
When you snuck into the shrine, you saw the torture tools, didn't you?
 Those tools were all made to protect the strict doctrines that were laid out by the original members of the Onigafuchi village.
 Those who disobeyed the doctrines were taught a lesson by dying a painful death.
 Those tools were used for that purpose.

Keiichi:
But that was ages ago, right?

Mion:
The Sonozaki family thought it was important to keep the Cotton Drifting rituals alive even if it must be done in secret.
 These seats are here for people to observe.
 I killed all of them right here, and I performed the Cotton Drifting technique on each of them flawlessly.

Keiichi:
Where's Shion?

Mion:
She is in the prison.

Keiichi:
What about Satoko and Rika?

Mion:
I was afraid they might start drawing maggots.
 So I threw them in the well.
 Sorry.

Keiichi:
 Shion!

Shion:
Keiichi.

Keiichi:
Shion.

Shion:
Keiichi...

Keiichi:
You're not dead.
 I thought that for sure you were.

Shion:
No. I can't take this anymore.
If you hate me so much, then just go ahead and kill me.
 Kill me and get it all away.

Keiichi:
It's gonna be OK, Shion.
 I'm gonna get you out of here.

Mion:
If you really wanna die that badly, I'll be more than happy to take care of that for you.
 But first I'm gonna turn this guy into ground meat.

Mion:
Can you hear me, Shion?
 It's about to begin.
 I hope you'll enjoy it when Keiichi starts screaming.
 You're awake. Nice.

Keiichi:
Who exactly are you?

Mion:
I'm Mion Sonozaki.
 Who else what I'd be?

Keiichi:
You can't possibly be Mion.

Mion:
Really?
 Well, if I'm not Mion, then who am I?

Keiichi:
You are a demon.

Mion:
Keiichi. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
 See this demon has been living within my body for quite some time.
 But it was awakened by something very specific.
 And that would be you.
 You are the one who screwed everything up.
 All you had to do was give that doll to Mion instead.
 And maybe, just maybe you wouldn't be where we are now.
 If you hadn't made poor little Mion cry that day, I most likely would never have woken up.
 This type of tortures is very simple.
 It just involves me hammering fifteen nails on both of your hands at each and every joint.
 I don't understand.
 Why am I hesitating?

Keiichi:
If torturing me is gonna appease the demon inside you, then go right ahead, hammer away.

Mion:
You serious?

Keiichi:
You just have to promise me two things in exchange.
 First, forgive Shion.

Mion:
Wow, I'm about to inflict some serious pain and the first thing you think of is Shion?

Keiichi:
And secondly, I want you to leave that body for good and give it back to Mion.
 That's all I ask.

Mion:
I don't believe it.
 With all I'm about to do to you, you don't even ask me to spare your life?

Keiichi:
All right.
 And there is the third thing.
 Please don't kill me.

Mion:
You just asked for two at first.
 Don't get greedy.
 I'll give you those two and no more.

Keiichi:
Well, I guess that's my loss.

Mion:
But I'm a demon, so the chance I'll keep my promise is pretty slim.
 However, I don't mind granting that third request of yours.
 It's too late to save Shion.
 She's a lost cause now.
 The demon's going to kill her.
 Nothing you do will stop that.
 Sad but true.
 And your request to give this body back to Mion, well, that also won't happen.
 Did you hear that?
 I bet it's Oishi.
 Rena probably called him when we didn't come back.
 I'm sorry for defiling Mion.

Keiichi:
Do what you want.
 But the Mion I'm gonna remember is the Mion who was my friend.

Mion:
You need to forget about her.
 If you ever see me after today, the last thing you should do is approach me.
 The only thing that's going to be alive within me by then will be the demon.

Man A:
We need two stretchers. Now.

Man B:
Emergency saved, both Keiichi Maebara and Shion Sonozaki.

Rena:
Keiichi, are you alright, Keiichi?

Keiichi:
Mion is still on the loose.
 And the last I heard, they still haven't found all the bodies yet.

Man C:
Kumagai, take a look.

Newscaster:
It appears to be a truly horrible crime and apparently the mur...

Rena:
So your family's gonna move, huh.
 It's gonna be so lonely here.
 I can't believe that I'm the only one left now.

Keiichi:
Are you sure it's OK if you'd be wandering around like this?

Mion:
I just really wanted to see you one last time.
 I've tried, but..., I'm afraid I can't stay here anymore.

Keiichi:
Hey, are you feeling OK?

Mion:
I tried. I really tried, Keiichi.
 But I can't stop it.

Keiichi:
Hey. Calm down.
 I'm sure that you can get...

Mion:
Just in time.
 I did it.
 It's all done.
 I killed everyone that I wanted to kill.
 They're all dead now.

Oishi:
Shion. You poor kid.
 She had to have died instantly from this height.

Police A:
This could be a murder or an accident.

Oishi:
Maybe.

Keiichi:
It couldn't be an accident.
 I'm guessing Mion's still on the loose out there somewhere, isn't she?

Oishi:
Oh, yeah, right.
 I guess I should probably bring it up to you today on all that.
 Believe it or not, we actually found her.

Keiichi:
What?

Oishi:
There is more.
 Mion's not all that we've come up with.
 You were right.
 We found the bodies of everyone who's gone missing at the bottom of that well.
 Just like you said, we would.
 I got one more question for you, Maebara.
 Are you absolutely sure that the person who stabbed you was Mion Sonozaki?

Keiichi:
Well, yeah.
 Detective Oishi, you can't smoke in here.
 This is a hospital.

Oishi:
Right.
 Interesting thing is we also found Mion Sonozaki at the bottom of that well.

Keiichi:
What?

Oishi:
In fact, forensics got the body and told that she died on the exact same date that we pulled you out of there.

Keiichi:
But that's impossible.
 If it wasn't Mion that attacked me and Shion, who was it?

Oishi:
Do you remember how Miyo Takano died?

Keiichi:
Ah, yeah? I think so.
 She burnt to death, right?

Oishi:
We did an autopsy.
 We were able to determine that her body would've been found 24 hours after her death.
 That means that when you guys snuck into the ritual shrine that night, the Miyo Takano there was supposedly with you was already something that needed her body back.
 There are way too many dead bodies walking around in this case.

Mion:
You didn't think I grant you that third wish, did you?
 Silly, silly boy.

What I'm forgetting is your warm.
 The sound of sad footsteps keep repeating themselves.
 A small little memory draws you to the door.

 When They Cry,
 "Curse Killing" Chapter, Episode 1, Older Brother.

 Can you believe in this?
