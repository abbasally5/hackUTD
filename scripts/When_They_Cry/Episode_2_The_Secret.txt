 Look. it's true.There was a murder. Aaaaaaaaaaaooh...


Are you Okay? Are you?


I guess. But you scared the crap out of me, though.


Well, you said that you needed an ax or something so that you could get him out, and that's why...


Yeah, and looks like you brought a big one too. But it's getting kind of dark now. How about we do this tomorrow?





Hey, don't get all sad and stuff. You'll get to dig out the Kenta doll tomorrow, Okey?


Yeah, I guess you're right.

Keiichi:
Festival?

Mion:
I told you the other day.The Cotton Drifting Festival. Rika's got a spot on the festival's executive committee.Isn't that so?

Rika:Yep, it is.

Keiichi:
So what's this cotton drifting festival all about anyway?

Mion:
It's when we get to take all our worn-out blankets and padded kimonos and we pay our respects to them by having a memorial service and then we send them floating down on the stream.

Keiichi:
Yeah, you know, that sounds like a really boring festival.

Mion:
No, it is definitely not boring. We can hardly wait for that.

Mion,Rena,Satoko,Rika:Cotton Drifting Festival's battle of the four evils.

Keiichi:
The battle of the..., huh?

Rika:
Well, actually since you're gonna be with us, now it'll be called the battle of the five evils.

Kiichi:
Five?

Satoko:
On the day of the festival you're gonna show everybody in the village all the skills you've honed in our club.

Rika:
Which means is we'll be doing our club activities at each of the street stalls.

Keiichi:
I get it.


Kiichi:
Hey there.

Tomitake:
Oh, hey, Keiichi. Nice to see you, again.

Keiichi:
You, too.

Mion:
Have you taken any good pictures?

Tomitake:
Yeah, I think I got a couple of good ones. Wow, Keiichi, I didn't know you're such a popular guy. I'm jealous. I wanna be surrounded by girls, too.

Keiichi:
No, it's not like that at all.

Mion:
You're gonna be here long enough to see this year's cotton drifting festival?

Tomitake:
Yeah, that's the plan. I figure I'll blow up a few rolls of film on the festival, then head on back to Tokyo the day after.

Rena:
Well, I'm hoping that your pictures win a whole bunch of awards.

Tomitake:
Hahaha...oh, man. Well, I'll see you guys at the festival.

Mion:
Yep, see ya.

Keiichi:
So you guys know that Mr.Tomitake guy too, huh?

Mion:
He comes to Hinamizawa about two or three times a year.

Rena:
He's always taking pictures of the seasons and the wild birds, too.

Keiichi:
Wild birds...huh...


Keiichi:
A couple of days later. The cotton drifting festival arrived right on schedule.

Rika:
Hi, everybody. Are you ready for the festival?

Mion:
Wow, nice.

Satoko:
You look great this year, too.

Rena:
You're so cute. I wanna take you home with me.

Mion:
All right, guys. Let's do this festival.

:Yeah.

Tomitake:
Looks like those kids are at it again. Great!

Mion:
First step, an eating competition at all the stands.

Satoko:
I'm not gonna lose.

Keiichi:
Gotcha.


Keiichi:
Cotton drifting, huh?

Rena:
Yeah, the cotton absorbs all of bad stuff from your body. Then you throw the cotton ball in the stream and that's it all done.


Keiichi:
Hey, where'd Rena go? She was right here a second ago. Mr.Tomitake!

Tomitake:
How's it going? Where's everybody else?

Keiichi:
Guess I got separated from them .

Takano:
So what do you think of it, Keiichi? Were you able to enjoy the festival?

Keiichi:
I guess.

Takano:
Really?

Keiichi:
Who is this person anyway?

Takano:
So, do you think that after tonight you can say you're part of Hinamizawa?

Keiichi:
I don't know. I get the feeling I'm still in the dark about a lot of things.

Tomitake:
What? You mean about Hinamizawa?

Keiichi:
Yeah, I guess so. Well, there's that stuff about the dam. I heard Hinamizawa came close to being underwater. That was a big deal back then, wasn't it?

Tomitake:
I think they started planning the dam's construction about seven or eight years ago. For a while there, it looked like Hinamizawa and all the other villages upstream were gonna end up underwater.

Keiichi:
Man, you're kidding.

Tomitake:
Most of the town protested it. And eventually got to the courts, and they found out about of all the scandals and corruption revolved around the whole thing. In the midst of this mess, construction on the dam was canceled.

Keiichi:
What about a murder, or someone was chopped up? You hear about that?

Tomitake:
I heard about that. It happened about four years ago around this time of year. I think it was on the day of the cotton drifting festival, too.

Takano:
All the old folks in town were positive that the murder was the result of the curse of Oyashiro.

Keiichi:
The curse of Oyashiro? What's that about?

Tomitake:
People said it was divine punishment by Oyashiro, the guardian god of Hinamizawa, revenge for threatening to flood the village.

Takano:
Since that time it's happened every single year.

Keiichi:
What do you mean? What's happened?

Tomitake:
Each year... on the day of the cotton drifting festival... somebody dies.

Keiichi:
Every year?

Tomitake:
Uh-huh. On the day of the festival, the year after the hacked-upbody was found, a resident of Hinamizawa who supported the dam's construction died when he fell off the cliff into the water.Poor guy was on vacation. As for his wife, well ..., they've never found her body.

Takano:
And the year after that, on the night of the festival, the priest of the shrine came down with some unknown illness. And drop dead on the spot. His wife drowned herself in a swamp that very same night.

Tomitake:
And then, following year, also on the night of the cotton drifting festival, a housewife who lived in the neighborhood was found beaten to death.

Keiichi:
Really?

Takano:
I know, it's strange, isn't it? Remember the man who fell off the cliff and died? Well, actually his younger brother was married to the housewife.

Tomitake:
After that first murder, there've been four cotton drifting festivals. The fifth one is...

Takano:
Tonight.

Keiichi:
What Mr.Tomitake told me really freaked me out.
 All those mysterious deaths... that happened during the cotton drifting festival...
 And I think I actually believed I had nothing to do with that.

Mion:
I just solved the mystery.
 The suspect is Rika.
 Her weapon was poison.
 She did it in the nurse's office.

Keiichi:
No! Damn it, no!

Satoko:
Why did you get that!?

Rika:
I like using poison to kill because it's a gentle death.

Mion:
That was too easy.

Keiichi:
Alright. Just one more game, c'mon!
 Before we do, I have to use the bathroom.

Mion:
Take as long as you want with your No.2, buddy.

Rena:
Oh, Mion, that's gross.

Keiichi:
Suckers, this will give me plenty of time to plan my strategy.

Chie:
Oh, Keiichi, I believe there's a gentleman here who'd like to have words with you.
 I told him to wait at the entrance, OK?

I've got a visitor?

Oishi:
Are you Maebara?
 Keiichi Maebara?

Keiichi:
Yeah, that's me. Who are you?

Oish:
My car has got air conditioning.
 So you mind if we talk in there?
 I promise you, it would only take a minute.

Keiichi:
So...What do you wanna talk to me about?

Oishi:
The man in the picture, you know him?
 If you do, I'd like you to tell me anything you can about him.

Keiichi:
Isn't this Mr.Tomitake?

Oishi:
Well, then you probablly know the lady in this picture too, right?

Keiichi:
Yeah, she...I don't know her name...but she was with Mr.Tomitake last night.

Oishi:
So, when was the last time you saw both of them?

Keiichi:
Last night. I mean, I talked to them at the cotton drifting festival.

Oishi:
And did you notice anything strange about either of them?
 I need you to tell me everything you can remember.

Keiichi:
Wait, did something happen to them?

Oishi:
Well, for starters,
 That guy in the picture, he died last night.

Keiichi:
What!?


Oishi:
He was killed on the day of the cotton drifting festival.
Go not out on a limb here, but I'm sure you know what that means, don't you?

Keiichi:
What that means?
 Are you talking about the curse of Oyashiro or something?
 So could you tell me what happened to him?

Oishi:
The body was found by one of our patrol cars as with heading back to the station from the festival.
 And the time was five minutes to midnight
 That happened right before the road starts leading out of town.
 You know the part where the pavement starts.
 It was dark, so for one or two street lights.
 Even so, we found Mr. Tomitake's body on the shoulder of the road, very dead.
 All around the body, the ground was covered with blood.

Keiichi:
Ugh...

Oishi:
The autopsy told us he slit his own throat with his finger nails.

Keiichi:
What?

Oishi:
For some reason Mr. Tomitake decided he was gonna use all his strengths to claw at his own throat.
 He kept on digging away himself until he got to an artery, tore through that as well.
 We figured if he might've been on drugs, so we ran a bunch of tests, but everything came back negative.
 We did find something else. His body had other wounds on it.
 There's a possibility that he was attacked by someone.
 Perhaps more than one person. We're not sure.

Keiichi:
More than one?

Oishi:
We've got the time of death estimated at between nine and eleven p.m.
 That means he died right after you saw him.

Keiichi:
What about the woman?

Oishi:
Yeah, well the lady's still missing, and it looks like she might be involved somehow in this ugly incident.
 The way this thing's turning out, people are gonna start to think the curse of Oyashiro killed Jiro Tomitake.
 The night at the festival Oyashiro probably got pretty upset.
 I mean him running around during the sacred ritual, taking all those pictures. 
That's the way folks all look at it anyway.

Keiichi:
You've gotta be kidding.
 Come on, nobody dies from the divine punishiment or curses.

Oishi:
Well, you definitely have a point there.
 Maebara, I need someone from Hinamizawa who doesn't believe in curses to help me out on this one.
 You can keep me informed, even if it's a rumor, I wanna know about it.
 By the way here's my card with my number.
 Everything we've talked about right now is confidential, okay?
 You keep quiet about it.
 Especially around that Sonoazaki girl and her friends.

Keiichi:
Sonozaki girl... are you talking about Mion?
 Is she involved?

Oishi:
Right now, I've got no idea who might be involved or just how involved they may be.
 That's why I don't want you to tell anything to anybody in the village.

Keiichi:
I can't do that.

Oishi:
Then think about it this way.
 You wanna keep it secret because you don't want any of the villagers who believe in the curse to start worrying.
 So, tell me, that work for you?

Keiichi:
I guess it does.
 Um..

Oishi:
(My) name's Oishi from the Okinomiya precinct.

Keiichi:
Ah... okay

Keiichi:
 Last night, I couldn't get to sleep.
 I kept thinking about what the cop Oishi had told me.

Mion:
 I heard she disappeared on the night of the Cotton Drifting Festival.

Rena:


 Mion:
 I'm not sure if she was hit by the curse or spirited away by the demon.

Keiichi:
 Spirited away by the demon...?
 What's that?

 Mion:
 If it really was Oyashiro, then...

Rena:
 Am I next...?
 Am I...?
 I mean...

Mion:
 But you came back, so you should be fine.

Rena:
 Yep, but...Satoshi didn't, right?

Mion:
 That's all in the past now.
 Let's not talk about this anymore.

Mion:
 Oh, no!
 I forgot!
 I got to go help my uncle today!
 Sorry, everybody.
 I can't do the club thing.

Keiichi:
 You're helping your uncle today?
 I never guess you were that accommodating.

Mion:
 Sorry, everybody.
 I'm going home for today.

Satoko:
 Guess that means the club's canceled for today.

Keiichi:
Man!
Satoko:
Have a good rest of the day.
 See you tomorrow.

Rika:
 Bye you guys.

Rena:
 Okay, see you tomorrow.

Keiichi:
 Careful on your way home, guys.
 Man, and I was really looking forward to playing this game today.
 Huh, Satoshi...? Who's that?
 Hey, Rena.
 Do you know if there were ever any students who've transferred out of the school?

Rena:
 Yeah, a couple have.

Keiichi:
 Do you know if the Satoshi guy was one of them?

Rena:
 Sorry, I really don't know.
 I think he transferred out around the same time I came here.
 That's the reason I've never really got the chance to talk to him much.


Keiichi:
Hey, Rena.
 You guys aren't lying or keeping any secrets from me, are you?

Rena:
Secrets?
 We're not keeping any secrets.

Keiichi:
You're lying, right?

Rena:
What's that supposed to mean? Huh? Keiichi?

Keiichi:
You're keeping something a secret from me, aren't you?

Rena:
Oh yeah, and what about you?
 Aren't you lying and keeping secrets from all of us? Aren't you?
 Aren't you lying and keeping secrets from us?
 Well, aren't you?

Keiichi:
No, I'm not lying, or keeping any secrets, either.

Rena:
You're lying.

Keiichi:
But why do you think I'm lying?

Rena:
Yesterday, when we were doing our club, you said you went to the teacher's office when she called you, didn't you?
 But you didn't , did you?
 I know for a fact that you didn't go to the teacher's office.
 You were sitting in a car parked by the gate talking to someone, a man you don't know.
 Tell me just who was he?

Keiichi:
I didn't really know the guy.

Rena:
Well then what would the guy you don't even know want to talk to you about?

Keiichi:
Well, yeah.
 That's what I wanted to know.

Rena:
Fine then, what were you talking about?

Keiichi:
It didn't have anything to do with you guys, I promise.

Rena:
Liar!
 Just like you have secrets and things to hide from us, we have secrets and things to hide from you.

Keiichi:
Sure, I gotcha.

Rena:
Let's go.
 It's starting to get cold out.

Mother:
Keiichi, you have a call from the bookstore.

Keiichi:
Bookstore?
 At this hour?
 Hello?

Oishi:
Sorry for calling so late.
 This is Oishi from the Okinomiya Bookstore.

Keiichi:
Hey there, detective Oishi.

Oishi:
So, anything interesting happened you wanna talk to me about?

Keiichi:
Do you know what "spirited away by the demon" means?

Oishi:
It's an expression unique to that village.
 But as far as the terminology goes, it's no different from the meaning of the regular spirited away.

Keiichi:
Really.

Oishi:
A long time ago, Hinamizawa was feared because it was called the village of the demon.

Keiichi:
Demon?
 Like the ones in hell?

Oishi:
Well, more like the man-eating ones.
 The kind come down to the village, kidnap people and eat them.
 Just some scary old fairy tale that's been passed down.

Keiichi:
Rena and Mion were talking about it.
 Something about Oyashiro and being spirited away.

Oishi:
Maebara, do you know about the first murder?
 The guy who got chopped up?

Keiichi:
Yeah, and [all/of] each of the six killers.
 One is still on the run, isn't that right?

Oishi:
What if the person on the run wasn't on the run.
 What if they were spirited away by the demon.

Keiichi:
Then how about the accident that happened year after that?
 You know, the one where the guy and his wife that supported the dam' s construction both died?

Oishi:
Well, to tell you the truth, officially only the husband died in that accident.
 His wife's body still hasn't been found.

Keiichi:
The year after that, the third year.
 When the priest got sick and died, and his wife committed suicide?

Oishi:
Same thing goes for that one too.
 We just have the suicide note.
 The body of his wife is never found.

Keiichi:
What?

Oishi:
I'm not sure if I call any of that spirited away by the demon.
 But everytime at the case of Oyashiro's curse, one person dies and another disappears.

Keiichi:
Then what about the housewife who was beaten to death last year.
 Was anybody reported missing after that happened?
 You guys did catch the murderer that time, right?

Oishi:
Oh yeah, we caught that guy.
 We caught him pretty good.



 Keiichi:
 What? Even though you copped the guy, you did it?

Oishi:
He died at the detention center during the interrogation.
 So I guess you can say the truth remains to be told.

 Keiichi:
What about the lady's missing kid?

Oishi:
Yeah, the kid's about a year older than you are or was.
Got his name right here, Satoshi Hojyo.
Kid went to the same school you do.

Chie:
You'll be sitting at that desk.
 One of our students transferred out.

Father:
Hey, Keiichi.
 Could you get the door for me?

Keiichi:
I'm sorry, my dad's calling me.
 I'm gonna have to hang up now, OK?

Oishi:
Just give me a call if anything else happens.

Father:
Hey, hurry up.
 Open the door.

Keiichi:
OK, OK, jeez.
 What's that for?

Father:
Oh, come on, now, son.
 Wasn't Rena here just a minute ago?
 I figured the least I could do is bring you guys some tea.
 Did she leave already?

Keiichi:
Rena...was...

 Father:
 Oh, don't hide it. Weren't you talking to her the whole time?

Keiichi:
Dad, did you see her walk up the stairs?

Father:
Yes, I did. I told her your room was straight up the stairs and the first door on the right.
 H...hey! What are you doing, Keiichi?
 You don't have to be embarrassed.

 Keiichi:
I was positive Rena was there a minute ago.
I was sure of it. She'd been standing right outside my room the entire time.
 She heard everything I said to detective Oishi.


What you see here
 is your false home
 What you see there
 is a blank look
 What I see
 is sadness repeating
