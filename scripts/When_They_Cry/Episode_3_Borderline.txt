 How's Satoko?

Chie:
 Well, she finally calmed down enough to go to sleep.
 I think what she had was a panic attack. But I intend to take her to the clinic a little later to make sure everything's okay.

Mion:
 Let's go, Keiichi.

Keiichi:
 Yeah.
 I knew that every time the adults said Satoko was fine, she really wasn't.
 And no matter how good their intentions may be, the adults don't have the capacity to save her.
 But if Satoko is left alone like this, I have no doubt that she will break down for sure.
 So I've made up my mind. I'm gonna kill Satoko's uncle.


Keiichi:
 Hey, Mom. You read mystery and crime novels, so of all ones you've read, which one pulled up a truly unsolvable crime.

Mom:
 A novel like that doesn't exist.

Keiichi:
 Huh?

Mom:
People who like to read mystery novels read them because they enjoy the act of unraveling the clues. That's the whole point of the novel. Take away the fun of figuring out of the crime and you lose the whole reason for reading that story.

Keiihi:
 Oh, gotcha.

Mom:
 You see the parfect crime is a crime that can never be solved. Then the crime like that would never even become a story.

Keiichi:
 A crime that isn't a story.

Mom:
 Think about it. What are the basic elements every story has to have.

Keiichi:
 You mean like intro, development, climax, that's stuff?

Mom:
 Exactly. And the most important part of a good story is the "introduction." Without a solid introduction, the story doesn't have the foundation it needs to move forward.

Keiichi:
 So, if nothing really happens in the beginning, then nothing ever happens.

Mom:
 Right. Skip the begining part you don't have a crime. And no crime means no detective. No detective means no investigation. And if there's no investigation, there's no resolution. So, you see, that's truely the perfect crime.

Keiichi:
 The perfect crime never actually happens.
 That makes sense. If there isn't a crime, then there aren't any police. And if there aren't any police, and then there isn't any reasons for the crime to be solved.

Mom:
 But with that said, Keiichi, making it look like nothing happened isn't easy. In fact, it's extremely difficult.
 Oh...


Irie:
Satoko's older brother, Satoshi... used to be a regular player for the Hinamizawa fighters.

Keiichi:
 Good!
 That should do it.

Mion:
 With Satoko?

Keiichi:
 Yeah, with Satoko. I really want you to take her to tomorrow's cotton drifting festival. Would you do that?

Mion:
 Yeah, I don't mind, but...

Keiichi:
 Even if you only get her out of the house for a little while, I think it'll be good for her. She just needs to get away from that miserable uncle of hers, okay?

Mion:
 Why?

Keiichi:
 Why what?

Mion:
 Why are you asking me? Why aren't you taking her to the festival?

Keiichi:
 Ah...I want to, but I've got something I gotta do tomorrow. I've really tried to get out of it, but I can't.

Mion:
 Yeah, like what?

Keiichi:
 It's nothing, something boring.
 Mion? Are you still there?

Mion:
 Uh, sorry. It's just that I got this exact same phone call from someone else's phone before.

Keiichi:
 Huh?

Mion:
 Satoshi.
 Sorry if it would seem like I was being nosy.

Keiichi:
 So, Satoshi didn't go to the festival last year?

Mion:
 No, he said he had something to do and asked me to take Satoko to the festival for him instead.

Irie:
Their uncle's wife was found beaten to death by some addict on the night of last year's cotton drifting festival.

Keiichi:
 That was Satoshi.

Mion:
 Huh? What was?

Keiichi:
 Uh, nothing.

Mion:
 Sorry, Keiichi, we've got a little off topic. Listen, you don't have to worry about Satoko, okay? It's all taken care of. I'd already invited her before you called me.

Keiichi:
 Oh, really?

Mion:
 The plan has already been set. We are all gonna meet up tomorrow and go together. Feel better?

Keiichi:
 Yeah, sorry. I guess I really didn't need to call after all. I'm counting on you then.

Mion:
 What are you gonna be doing? Are you gonna be like Satoshi and refuse to tell me what it is?

Keiichi:
 No, it's just not important.

Mion:
 Okay.

Keiichi:
 Well, good night.

Mion:
 Yeah, good night.

Keiichi:
 It was him. It was Satoshi who killed their aunt. All Satoshi was trying to do was to protect Satoko.


Mom:
Sixty-one? Was this the average score?

Teachter:
No, this is the deviation value.

Mom:
What?

Teacher:
Even on the intelligent test, his scores were incredibly high.
What I'm trying to saying, Mrs. Maebara, is that your son is extremely bright.

Mom:
But I see the grades he brings home, so why don't they reflect that?

Teacher:
When Keiichi took the Kraepelin test, we learned something rather interesting. Keiichi seems to have a hard time when you give him the problem he can't relate to or has no interest in.

Mom:
Oh.

Teacher:
For example, if he's asked to draw the open unfolded pattern of regular hexahedron, he is confused. But if you change that to what shape would a die become if you would cut it apart, he answered perfectly.

Mom:
I see.

Keiichi:
 It won't be long now. Everything will be over. Everything...
 When the cicadas start crying tonight, it's over.

Keiichi:
 Hurry up, answer!

Teppei:
Hello.

Keiichi:
 Hi, this is the Okinomiya police department. Is this the Hojo residence?

Teppei:
Yeah, this is Mr.Hojo.

Keiichi:
 Mr. Hojo, we have your little girl Satoko currently in our custody.

Teppei:
What? Satoko? What's she doing at the police department?

Keiichi:
 It's rather complicated, but I'll explain everything to you when you get here. But we need you to come down here immediately.

Teppei:
Immediately? But I just took a bath. The last thing I wanna do is go out again.

Keiichi:
 You need to get down here right now, sir!

Teppei:
Oh, then, fine, [brat] kid. What did she do anyway?

Keiichi:
 Like I said, I'll discuss the detail when you get here, good bye!

Teppei:
Hey, hey! Wait a second. I don't know where the police station is. What's your address.

Keiichi:
 Oh, okay, it's a...

Teppei
Oh, yeah...I remember. It's next to the fire station, isn't it? Sure it isn't close.

Keiichi:
 Yes, that's right. I'll see you when you get here, Mr. Hojo.
All right.

Keiichi:
 He is coming.
 I'm gonna end it. I'm gonna end it. I'm gonna end it, Satoko!

Teppei:
Jesus christ! What in the hell was that?!

Keiichi:
 That far?! There's no way. I can't carry this guy that far. What should I do?
 Crap! His scooter!

 Satoshi, I'm sorry. I totally misjudged you this whole time.
 Huh? What the heck happened? I dug the hole right here, I know it!
 Damn it!


Keiichi:
There you are.
Just wait, Satoko. Once this is over.
 Everything will go back to the way it was.
 I did it. I did it! I put an end to it, you selfish bastard!

Takano:
 Well, well, I was wondering who this was?

Keiichi:
 Ms. Takano!

Takano:
 Tell me, Keiichi. What are you doing carring a shovel at this hour of the night? And why are you [all] soaking wet covered in mud enough with no umbrella?

Keiichi:
 Well, you see, I went treasure hunting earlier with Rena down at the dam. And I forgot to bring my shovel back.

Takano:
 I see. So, you decided the best time to get your shovel with in the middle of the downpour.

Keiichi:
 Well, when I left home, I didn't think it was gonna rain.

Takano:
 Interesting. How you travel in the opposite direction of the dam.
 Oh, dear, have you hurt yourself? Is it twisted? Well, why not? Come on, I'll take you home.
 You're lucky that I'm such a nice person, Keiichi. You'll have to leave your bike here tonight. You can get it tomorrow.

Keiichi:
 Huh? Are you sure there's no way we can fit it? I really need it to get it around.

Takano:
 I'm sorry, but my trunk's completely full. And there's no room in the back seat either. It'll be fine, no one's going to steal it, I promise.

Takano:
 ...bury the body?

Keiichi:
 Huh? Um, I'm sorry, I didn't quite hear you. Could you repeat that?

Takano:
 I asked, if you were able to bury the body.
