Keiichi:
Sorry, Shion. What did you just say?

Shion:
Last night, I heard that Mr. Tomitake and Ms. Takano died.
Ms. Takano burned to death, and Mr. Tomitake died by digging out his own throat.
I just found this all out this morning. I happened to overhear my father talking on the phone to someone.

Keiichi:
Yeah, but I heard the news today, and it didn't mention anything about this.

Shion:
Of course, it's not gonna make the news.
I've heard from more than one person that whenever there is a death linked to Oyashiro's curse,
the Sonozaki family does everything they can to keep the police quiet.

Keiichi:
You're kidding!

Shion:
Keiichi, I think I've told you before. It's entirely possible that the villagers are involved in carrying out Oyashiro's curse.

Let me say this clearly so you understand:
if someone's death is believed to be the result of Oyashiro's curse, no one in Hinamizawa is ever gonna care.

Keiichi:
That's absurd, Shion!
It doesn't make any sense. I mean, why would someone commit these murders, anyway?

Shion:
My guess is that there's someone wanting to carry out my heinous grandmother's evil wishes,
and then any tragedy that occurs on the night of the Cotton Drifting festival is just easily dismissed as Oyashiro's curse.

Keiichi:
So what are you gonna do about it?

I didn't wanna go in there, but you talked me into it. This is your fault!
So what are you gonna do to get out of this mess, huh?
Are you listening?

Shion:
My god, you can really be annoying.
Thanks to you, my popsicle melted.

Kimiyoshi's son:
Hello, Kimiyoshi house.

Shion:
I'm calling on behalf of the Sonozakis. Is the village leader home yet?

Kimiyoshi's son:
Oh, is this Mion? Yeah, I've called around, but I can't find them anywhere. I give up.
I'm sure he's out there just chatting someone's ear off, but I don't know where.

Shion:
Well, grandma and I sat down after you called earlier, and tried to figure out where he might be,
but we came up with nothing and she suggested gathering the Youth Crops to go search for him.

Kimiyoshi's son:
Really? At this hour?
I don't know. We're not even sure if he's truly missing yet.

Shion:
Well, since he went missing right after the Cotton Drifting festival, she thought it might be wise to take it seriously.

Kimiyoshi's son:
Did Mrs. Oryo personally say that?

Shion:
Yeah.

Kimiyoshi's son:
Well, let's do it, then.
If we search through the night and we still can't find him, I'll call the police in the morning and let them know.

Shion:
I think that's probably a really good idea.
And I'll come out and help search, too. I'm grandmother's behalf. See ya.

Well, that's done. You're yummy!


Shion:
You know, the entire village is in a total panic right now trying to find you, grandpa.

Kimiyoshi:
Aggghhhhh...

Shion:
I'm sorry, would you be happier if I loosen to chain a bit?

I'll tell you what? For each question you answer for me, I'll reward you by dropping the chain one more inch.
You know? I bet three more inches will make a world different to your comfort level right now.


Kimiyoshi:
Agghhh...


Shion:
Sorry, my bad. You couldn't answer my questions now if you wanted to.

Kimiyoshi:
Listen.
I really don't know anything, Shion.
I wish I did, but the truth is I don't think I have the answers that you are looking for.

Shion:
Well, how about if Satoshi is actually dead or alive? You ignorant on that?

Kimiyoshi:
Yes.

Shion:
Well then, as head of the Kimiyoshi family, if you had to guess, what would your answer be?

Kimiyoshi:
Shion, I'm sorry.
I'm doing the best I can, I promise. I'm honestly not trying to make you angry.
It's just... I've gotta... I've gotta think about it.

Shion:
Time's up.
I want to know the truth.
Do you think Satoshi is dead at this point, or do you think there's a chance that he could still be alive?

Kimiyoshi:
I know this may not be what you want to hear, but I find it hard to believe that he's still alive.

Shion:
There we go, finally the truth!
See? It wasn't the fact that he killed his aunt then got wiped out by you people.

No!
What got him killed was just being born in the member of the Hojo family.

Kimiyoshi:
But Shion, I thought they found the person who killed his aunt.
I heard it was some lunatic doing it as a copycat crime.
I also heard he ended up dying right after they arrested him.

Shion:
I've heard that, but I think that guy was nothing more than a scapegoat.

Kimiyoshi:
No. Why would they do that?

Shion:
Yes. Why, indeed.

Kimiyoshi:
The scapegoat theory just doesn't make any sense.
If they wanted it to seem like Satoshi, he had been spirited away by the demon, then the last thing they want to do is play the scapegoat.
All they does is keep the police investigation open longer.

Shion:
Who's "they?"

Kimiyoshi:
There can only be one person: Ms. Oryo.
That's something she would do: fool the police with the scapegoat.
I'm sure that by now, Shion. You heard some of the rumors.
The Construction Minister's grandson for one: like how that boy had been kidnapped. 

Shion:
Interesting, so that kidnapping rumor was true.
I did hear that rumor, but I heard that the grandson was spirited away by the demon and found later somewhere deep within the mountains.

Kimiyoshi:
Yes.
Well, I think the truth is that it was done on Ms. Oryo's orders.
And when they heard the plans to build the dam had suddenly been scrapped, they held up their end of the bargain and released the grandson.
The members of the old alliance like me know all about this kind of relationships.

Shion:
I guess that's good to know.
So, it turns out that my awful grandmother, the three great families, and the old alliance were a powerful group.
Woooo, how scary!

Now, time to come clean. Who had Satoshi spirited away by the demon?

Kimiyoshi:
I really don't know. There's an unwritten law to never ask who actually committed the act.

Shion:
Fine!
Then tell me how you killed someone and disposed the body and waste so that it's never found.

That's it!

Satoshi! Satoshi!

Satoshi, Satoshi...

Satoshi:
Shion, you did it. You finally found me.

Shion:
Satoshi!
I'm sorry, Satoshi. I'm so sorry. Forgive me!

Satoshi:
You don't need to apologize. You didn't do anything wrong.

Shion:
Satoshi, I'm gonna join you, and you and I can be together forever!
I'll junp, Satoshi! All you have to do is be there and catch me!

Satoshi:
No.

Shion:
But why?

Satoshi:
Live, Shion.

Shion:
Live for what?
What's the point of living if I'm just gonna be alone?
That's not what I want! I wanna be with you, Satoshi! I wanna be with you forever!

I found him. Satoshi is at the bottom of the well, isn't he?

Mion:
I think he is. That's the only place I could think of.

Shion:
I need to know the truth, Mion.
Were you anywhere near here when they decided to kill him?

Mion:
No. If I had been here, I would have done what I could do to stop it.
I would have pleaded for his life, sis. I promise you!

Shion:
Liar!
It's your fault! You could have saved him, and you didn't!
You could have saved him!
You could have saved his life!
Why? Why?

Rena:
Morning, Mion. What's the matter?
Are you sleepy today, are you? Is she?

Shion:
Yeah, I didn't get to bed last night until almost three.

Keiichi:
You mean, 3:00 am?
Jeez, Mion. That goes way beyond just staying up a little late.

Rena:
Yeah, but maybe she was out all night trying to find the village leader. Is that it?

Shion:
Last night we met up with the Youth Corps over at the Furude shrine.
We were up all night searching everywhere we could think, but...

Keiichi:
You got a lot on your plate, don't you?

Shion:
No way! Are you kidding? This is nothing!
Man, I got all kinds of stamina. I have even begun to [tough], hahaha...
(Looks like the enemy hasn't been in contact with him yet.
I guess I should give him another call tonight as Shion.)

Rena:
Oh! Hey, look who's here, Satoko and Rika. Good morning!

Satoko:
Hey there guys! How's it going this morning?

Rika:
Hope you all had a good time last night. Ni-pa-.

Rena:
Oh, I don't believe it! How do you do it?
You're cuter than ever this morning. I'm gonna take you home today!

Shion:
Rika Furude... the last survivor of the Furude Family.
I don't know she may be a member of the three great families.
But I found it hard to believe she has anything to do with curse.
She's just a child. Not to mention the fact that she's never even been to ask to the board meetings.

Hey Rika, can I've words with you for a sec?

Rika:
Mii?

Shion:
So as the head of the Furude family, how much do you know about the current situation?

Rika:
I guess you're talking about Tomitake.

Shion:
She is connected.
Nothing about Mr. Tomitake has been released to the public yet.
There appears that her title as the head of the Furude family is more than just a polite decoration.

Rika:
All I can say is that it's the will of Oyashiro's curse.

Shion:
Yes, I'm well aware of that.
Then it isn't over yet, is it, Rika?
There's still two more to go.
Do you have any idea what their fate will be?
Well, do you or don't you?

Rika:
I don't think it really matters when we are the other.

Shion:
What are you talking about?
Of course, it matters!
If we do nothing there's no sign they had to distinguish themselves.

Rika:
Yeah, but I think they feel bad about what they did and that's all that matters.

Shion:
Give me a break!
That's gonna be about the lamest thing I've ever heard.
How does the last head of the Furude name ever get to be so soft?
Let me get this straight.
Are you saying you think violating the ritual tool shrine is something to be taken lightly?

Rika:
Not at all.
The ritual tool shrine is an important place for Oyashiro.
Going in there without a permission is something no one should ever do.

Shion:
So you do understand.
By breaking in there, the four of them have soiled the sanctitiy of that shrine.

Rika:
You right. They're bad little kitties.
Meow...

Shion:
Yes, they are bad kitties, indeed.
Two of them have since been captured and punished for it.
But there are still two to go.

Rika:
Meow...

Shion:
So how do you think they should distinguish themselves for this act, huh, head of the Furude Family?

Rika:
I say we should just forgive the two little kitties that're still running around.

Shion:
You don't believe they need to distinguish themselves for this!

Rika:
Mion, Listen, you keep using this word “distinguish” I don't know what it means.
Oyashio's not gonna get upset if all they did was just peeking into to the shrine a little bit.

Shion:
Amazing. I can't believe you're saying that.

Rika:
The reason you are not supposed to go in there is because there are all kind of scary tools inside.
That's why we tell everyone to keep out.
I bet when those people saw that stuff, they got really scared.
And if they got scared and [left and] feel bad then it's all okay.

Shion:
You can't decide whether it's okay or not. Only Oyashiro can make that decision!

Rika:
Yeah but Mion, I'm Oyashiro's priestess.

Shion:
So what does that mean? Are you telling me Oyashiro speaks to you or something that he tells you who to curse or who not to?
Ha! I can't believe a kid like you is in charge of the Frude family.
They used to be great!

Rika:
I don't know what you are getting so angry about.
I wish I knew what was really upsetting you.

Shion:
This is what's really upsetting me!
The head of the Kimiyoshi family needed to distinguish himself as well.
That's why he disappeared.
Keiichi is the only one left to distinguish himself.
And the Furude family will make sure it happens.

Rika:
But Mion, I don't know anything about this kind of stuff.

Shion:
If something does happen to Keiichi, then she is just as guilty as that wretched grandmother of mine.
When that time comes, I'll make sure her death is as painful as possible.


Shion:
I wonder if Kimiyoshi is dead yet or not.
I hope he is still alive. I really loved that old man.
All the people I love just disappear one by one.
Satoshi...
Satoko should have died instead.
It could've been anyone from the Hojo family.
She did her best to drag him down and tear his heart with all her whining.
She fed on him like a parasite and never once gets anything back.
What would it be like if she had died instead?

Satoshi would be broken.
His heart would never recover.
Her death may free him temporarily.
But the dark cloud will loom over him
But I would be there for him.
I would be there to heal his pain.
And then... he and I...

Rika:
I came to get some of the delicious soy sauce you have.

Shion:
Huh? Oh, right, the soy sauce.

Rika:
I brought a bottle to fill up.

Shion:
Yeah sure. But let me pour it.
You can just wait here, 'kay?

Rika:
I can do it.
If you just give me a funnel. I'm really good at pouring it in.

Shion:
O-Okay. Come on in.

Thats' weird.
I don't hear her footsteps.

Sorry, I spaced for a sec.

Is she trying to mess with me by matching my footsteps?

Rika:
Nipa.

Shion:
I wonder what her game is.

We've still got a whole lot left.
So feel free to take as much as you want, okay?


What?

Oh my god! It burns! It burns!
Oh my god! What did you do to me?

All right, that's it!
If you wanna play like that, fine!

C'mon Rika! You're starting to overstay, you're welcome here.

So do it! Make a move already!
Beleive me, if you don't make a move I definitely will!
You little brat!

Huh! You like that?
Teach you to mess with me.
Now let's find out what this little drug of yours does to the human body, brat.

Look at you. You're pathetic.
That was too easy.
I guess now all that's left for me to do is to sit here and watch you die.
But I was so looking forward to torturing you first.
I really don't wanna give that up.
Hey, I tell you what.
Let change the stages a little bit.
I say we take all this fun we're having done to the torture room.


Well now. It looks like you still have a little bit of strength left in you.
I guess it wouldn't be any fun if you didn't.
I'm sure I'll enjoy driving the nails through your fingers and lot more if you're struggling during it.

Rika:
Sorry, but I'mna have to turn you down on that offer.
Find someone else to torture.

Shion:
Huh! Now, that's how someone who is the head of the Furude Family should actually sound.
But I have to wonder just how threatening do you think you can be, Rika, when you can barely stand.
If you think you're getting out of this, you are wrong.

Rika:
Maybe, but maybe we have different views on what that means.
I could stay here and let you torture me for days'n days on end.
Or I could just leave here right now and be done with it.


Shion:
Leave here?
I dare you to try it!

I won! I did it!
I took down the people who killed Satoshi!

Hello, Sonozaki house.

Satoko:
Hey, Mion. Is that you?
It's Satoko, sorry to bother you so late.

Shion:
Hey Satoko, don't worry about it.

Satoko:
Listen, I really hate to disturb you at this hour.
But is Rika over there by chance.

Shion:
Oh, yeah, she's here.

Satoko:
Oh, she's still there?
I thought she was gonna come back.
I was gonna cook something.

Shion:
Oh Satoko, that's totally my fault.
I made way too much food for everyone here.
So I kinda talked Rika into eating some of it.

Satoko:
Really? You got extra food there?
Wow...

Shion:
Yeah, You should come by and have some, too.
There is plenty for everyone.

Satoko:
Well, I'd love to but...

Shion:
C'mon! Rika's already started to dig in.

Satoko:
Oh, that's Rika.
Okay, sure. I'll clean up and go.
Again sorry for calling so late.
I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?

Shion:
Yep, I'll be waiting.



What you pass is the usual fork in the road.
What you run to is the darkest corners.
Where you end up is the downside of the destruction.

Can you believe in this?
