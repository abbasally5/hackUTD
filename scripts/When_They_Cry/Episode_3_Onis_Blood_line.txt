Oishi:
Wow! Rumors fly fast around here.
Hahahahaha! It came as a surprise to me. I was certain Satoshi was a suspect.

Shion:
Detective if you would, I'd very much like to know who the real killer was. From what I heard, he was a bit deranged.

Oishi:
I would love to, but I'm afraid that would be a bit difficult. When the local police finally called us, he was already dead.

Shion:
You're kidding. Well, what happened? How'd he die?

Oishi:
Well, I'm not quite sure about that one yet. His mental state could've deteriorated while he was in detention or he could've just committed suicide.
So, I hear the rumor going around Hinamizawa is that your little friend Satoshi disappeared because he was spirited away by the demon. Guess that means they're talking about Oyashiro's curse.

Shion:
That's absurd!

Shion:
The first year was when the foreman at the dam construction project was murdered and dismembered. The second year was when Satoshi's parents had their accident. The third year the priest at Furude shrine just suddenly drop dead. They all had a connection with the Sonozaki family. And on the fourth year, his aunt was someone who was related to the traitors. Oyashiro's curse... is it true?

Takano:
I'm sorry. Did I surprise you, dear?

Shion:
Uh, kind of.

Takano:
You are Shion Sonozaki, aren't you?

Shion:
Are you a frined of my sister's or something?

Takano:
Well, I guess you could say that. My name is Miyo Takano. But you should just feel free to call me Miyo. Okay, Shion? Uh-oh, did I upset you? That's a shame. I thought for sure you and I would get along so well.

Shion:
These notes are nothing more than wild speculations.

Takano:
Oh, the bizarre murders or deaths I should say. But this term likes to refer to as Oyashiro's curse. And although each incidence seems to be independent from the others. It's quite obvious they are all linked by a single purpose. Every year, one person dies and another disappears as a sort of sacrifice.

Shion:
What was that last thing you said? Every year someone disappears, too?

Takano:
Well, of course. The number of people killed each year has to meet the number of people sacrificed.

Shion:
He was sacrificed?

Takano:
I've been doing a lot of research on some of the very old dark history of Hinamizawa. It's fascinating stuff. Before the Meiji era, Hinamizawa used to be called Onigafuchi village. Do you know much about this chapter on Hinamizawa's history? When there were demons here who ate humans.

Shion:
Yeah, I have heard about it. Mostly old stories.

Takano:
Well, have you heard the stories about the half human half demon wizards, who sometimes came down the mountain and kidnapped humans so they could feast upon them.

Shion:
Huh? No, I've never heard that.

Takano:
From what I've discovered, the victims were strapped down and restrained, and like slaying a fish they would slice them open and pull out their intestines and throw their disembodied entrails down the river. That's what the word 'Cotton Drifting' derives from.

Shion:
That's the cotton drifting festival.

Takano:
This book contains all my research. I'd be happy to loan it to you if you'd like. To properly perform Oyashiro sacrifice ritual, the victim must be drowned in Onigafuchi swamp. That swamp is very deep, you know.

Shion:
So, you are saying all the victims who'd disappeared in the last few years can be found at the bottom of that swamp? Does that cover Satoshi, too?

Takano:
See for yourself.

Shion:
That you, Kasai?

Mion:
No, it's me.

Shion:
Oh, come in, sis.

Mion:
This seems like a nice place. How's things, good?

Shion:
Yeah, I mean my new shool's pretty boring, but I guess that's to be expected. I'm just taking a few classes, anyway.

Mion:
So, sis, your nails, have they healed?

Shion:
Well, the wounds have closed up, but they're still pretty ugly. So if I can, I try not to show them to anybody. They are still kind of gross.

Mion:
I'm sorry.

Shion:
You don't have to apologize. You just did what You had to as the next head of the family. I'm not mad at you.

Mion:
But still...

Shion:
You know what, you being sorry makes it all good. Ahaha!

Mion:
Do you really think you can forgive me? Even with Satoshi? I mean I obviously knew how you felt, that you were really crazy about him.

Shion:
Yeah, well, I did going confess my love for him in front of a whole bunch of people.

Mion:
And grandma's really impressed with the way you distinguished yourself. She thinks you really learned your lesson.

Shion:
She better think that. I had to endure great deal of pain to please her.

Mion:
Tell me, sis. Where do you think Satoshi went?

Shion:
That was the moment the demon inside awoke.

Mion:
Uh... hey, I'm sorry. I promise I know nothing about what happened to Satoshi.

Shion:
You're lying.

Mion:
It's the truth. Even grandma doesn't know what happened to him.

Shion:
Stop it! You're lying! You're lying! Tell the truth! You had Satoshi spirited away by the demon, didn't you? You and the Sonozaki family! I can't believe it. You people are evil. Give him back! Give Satoshi back to me, damn it!
Mion, your fingers! Her hand, it looks exactly like mine does.

Mion:
It wasn't right for them to just tear off your nails. It didn't seem fair to me. Why should all that you'd be punished? We're twins. We do things together. So why? For the first time I actually yelled at grandma. I said it's not right, she had to leave you and Satoshi alone. So, she said you just have to distinguish yourself to her and she would forgive you, she promised. And then you and Satoshi were supposed to go and have normal lives. But then, Satoshi disappeared and no one knows why. Please believe me, Shion. I have no idea why Satoshi has gone. I have nothing to do with it.

Shion:
I'm sorry, Mion. Did it hurt?

Mion:
Yeah, but, I'm sure you were in a lot more pain than I was.

Shion:
I told the demon within me, that I was going to believe Mion. And at that same moment, I took all my feelings for Satoshi and buried them as deep in my heart as I possibly could. A year passed by without much incident... until that day.
Ow! What kind of jerk parks his bike in the middle of the side walk.
Oops! Wow, dejavu!

Yankee A:
Do you have any idea what you've just done?

Shion:
Is this just like before?
Leave her alone!
Yankee B:
What the hell do you want?

Shion:
Is that him?

Yankee C:
Stop trying and act tough.

Yankee A:
Do you wanna get your ass kick, too? Huh? You deaf?

Keiichi:
Er, hey, come on, guys. Stop the violence. It's all good here. Hahahaha...

Yankee B:
Stop this!

Okamura:
Don't worry, Keichi. I got a bunch of people come in and help.

Keiichi:
Hey, there, Mion. You okay? I've already forgotten that I began to see you tear up there for a second. So, come on! Smile! Okay?

Shion:
Wow, sis, it seems like you really like Keiichi. All right! Here's your challenge. You've gotta sum up his charm in just one word.

Mion:
Oh, ahahaha! Oh, let me see... Okay, if I had to choose one word, I'd say fun. For example the other day, We had the club meeting at the toy store and he was so awesome. I've thought for sure...

Shion:
Mion, told me all about him. His name is Keiichi Maebara. He is one grade behind us. And from the sound of it, he only recently moved to Hinamizawa. And my sister really likes him.

Mion:
...and then, because Keiichi got the crowd so whirled up and excited, Our uncle gave him this doll as like a parting gift.

Shion:
So what's the problem? Did you want the doll yourself?

Mion:
Well, yeah, but Keiichi didn't give it to me. He said he didn't think the doll was really my thing. And then he gave it to Rena. I wanna start over. I wanna go back to the first time I met Keiichi. I wanna go back in time and let him know that I'm a girl, too.

Shion:
You are taking this too seriously. Listen. There's all kinds of ways you can fix this. I mean you guys are still getting along, aren't you? Then, you're set! Just act like you always do and slowly show him how you feel. And make sure you tell Rena exactly how you feel about him too.

Mion:
You're right. Rena is way cuter than me.

Shion:
If you are gonna compete with another girl, you've gotta stay on your toes. Listen, sis. You can definitely use your tears as a way to [lure] guy in, but the last thing you wanna do is to depend on not to keep him. Most of the time you should smile. Only cry when you must. Hmmm, hey, come to think of it, it's just classic girl stuff. What do you think? Should I try it on Keiichi and see if it ever works?

Mion:
Huh? No! What are you, crazy?

Shion:
Hey, I know, why don't you and I have a little race to see who can catch Keiichi first.

Mion:
Uh-uh! No way! Forget it. If you come anywhere near Hinamizawa, I'll drag your ass out of there! ......

Shion:
I'm happy for you, sis, worrying about the guy you like. I envy that. I don't have that, anymore.

Mion:
Huh?

Shion:
Oh, nothing. Forget it! If Keiichi and my sister start dating, no one will have a problem with it. I can't be jealous. I can't resent her for that. Just because I was chastised and admonished, it doesn't mean that she should be, too. It's been almost a year since Satoshi disappeared. And it will soon be time for the cotton drifting festival, again.
I know exactly when it happened. Keiichi and I were walking together. He thought I was Mion, and then we happened to run into my sister. And that's when this whole mess started. And just gets uglier from here.

Satoko:
Look at Keiichi. He's made these two girls fight over him. He's such a pervert.

Rika:
Well, he is a guy. So, he is naturally weak.

Rena:
I don't know you guys. I'm getting worried. Keiichi looks really scared. Wooo?

Shion:
So, sis. Are we gonna keep playing tug of war until we finally tear Keiichi in half?

Mion:
All you gotta do is let go with his arm and this thing is over. Get lost, Shion! Go back to Okinomiya!

Shion:
Fine! No problem. I'd be happy to do that. Well, Keiichi. I'm afraid if I tease my sister anymore, she'll rival to turn around and bite me. So I'm just gonna say good bye.

Keiichi:
Hey, Shion. Um, thanks for everything you did today.

Shion:
Oh, don't worry about that. It was nothing.

Keiichi:
Well, see you later, Shion.

Shion:
Ahaha! Gotta go, see you, sis.

Mion:
Get out and stay out! Rena you are on guard. Satoko, set the trap! Rika, throw the salt.

Shion:
I'm sorry, Satoshi. I'm so sorry. I haven't forgotten about you, I promise. I still remember you, perfectly. Life without you is so gray and lonely. It's so boring. It's barely worth living at all.

Keiichi:
Well, see you later, Shion.

 Shion:
His voices wasn't warm and genuine. And I didn't make me feel good, not at all. I swear I don't like him. He's so insensitive. Satoshi... I'm sorry, Satoshi. I'm sorry. Why did you leave? Where could you have possibly gone?
Satoshi, that you? So, you were here.

Shion:
Ah, I'm sorry.
Takano:
Oh, Shion.

Shion:
Huh? Ms. Takano.

Tomitake:
This is the first time we've been formally introduced, isn't it? My name is Tomitake. You must be Mion's twin sister Shion, that I've heard so much about. Nice to meet you.

Shion:
It's nice to meet you, too. I hear that you're an excellent photographer.

Tomitake:
If by excellent, you means someone who can't sell anything.

Takano:
I notice I don't see you at the library anymore. It's too bad. There're so much research I wanted to share with you.

Shion:
I'll be sure to come by the next time I feel like it. Well, I should probably get going now. You guys are going to watch Rika do her dance, too? She's been practicing forever.

Takano:
Well, to tell you the truth, we're thinking of having a little look inside the ritual tool shrine.

Shion:
But, how are you planning on getting in? That place is off limits and there's a padlock on it.

Takano:
Jiro here tends to be pretty handy at that sort of thing. You should really come by later if you feel like it. You may never get this chance again.

Shion:
They are really gonna do it. That's where the torture tools are. Hey, if I go with those two, I just might be able to figure out how Satoshi was spirited away. I'm kind of afraid to go alone, but if Keiichi is with me. Even if we get caught ,Mion will forgive us, I'm sure.

Keiichi:
So, how much farther are we gonna go just to get a better view of Rika's dance.

Shion:
Huh? Who said anything about watching her dance?
Mr, Tomitake!

Takano:
That's the guardian god of Hinamizawa, Oyashiro.

Shion:
Oyashiro... if you are responsible for taking away Satoshi, I swear I will never forgive you. Did you hear me? Never...
What Ms. Takano said was true... people in this village are still practicing these barbaric rituals. Satoshi? Is that you? Those are your footsteps I'm hearing, aren't they? That isn't Satoshi?

Keiichi:
Hey, what's going on, Shion? You get a little scared or something?

Takano:
I believe tonight's the night that Oyashiro is supposed to curse someone else.

Shion:
I don't believe it. Don't they hear that?

Tomitake:
The dance is almost over.


Oryou:
There's nothing we can do about it. That girl had just too nosy for her own good.

Mion:
You're right. She's made Oyashiro angry and there's nothing we can do about it.

Oryou:
I hear the police are investigating. But you're sure what you heard is true?

Mion:
Fairly sure. It's probably Ms. Takano.

Shion:
Oyashiro's angry. The police are investigating. It's probably Ms. Takano. If today being what it is, it must have happened again. Oyashiro's curse has hit for the fifth time in a row. But I don't get it. Why are Mion and Grandma saying that Ms. Takano made Oyashiro angry? They must have found out that we snuck into the shrine.

Rena:
Have you ever experienced it? The footsteps that follow you everywhere, even into your room at night. It even stands over your bed staring at you. No matter where you are, someone is watching and always just out of sight. Someone is always observing you. It's what you go through before you get hit with Oyashiro's curse and it's what Satoshi is going through right now.

Shion:
It's...it's there. From the moment I set foot inside the ritual shrine, that thing has been stalking me.


What seek is a bit of comfort.
What you see is a gallery of hatred.
Where you fall is far beyond the darkness.
