  Oishi:
That's right.
The Sonozaki group has organized the search party for you.

Rena:
Means the enemy's no longer concerned with hiding themselves.

Oishi:
Let me make sure I've got this straight. You think they are after the scrapbook that Miss Takano created which you now possess.

Rena:
That's right.

Oishi:
And you believe that within these scrapbooks [is] the truth to Oyashiro's curse, everything we need to solve the mystery behind the serial murders.

Rena:
Yes. According to Miss Takano's notes, they are planning a massive biological terrorist attack in order to revive the religious belief of Oyashiro.
 I have a feeling that it isn't just somewhere down the road. 
They're planning on doing this soon.

Oishi:
Alright I gotcha you. Let me see what I can do on my end.
If this attack is gonna be as large as you say it is, it gotta be some clues lying around somewhere.

Rena:
Thank you.

Oishi:
Hey! One more thing.
There have been some rather odd developments regarding Miss Takano's case.

Rena:
What kind of odd developments?

Oishi:
You tell me. Remember the night of the cotton drifting festival. Think back.
You and your friends (so) along with Mr. Tomitake and Miss Takano stop and chat a little bit, right?

Rena:
Yes.

Oishi:
When they did an autopsy, according to the report from the Gifu district, her body had been dead for over 24 hours when it was found.
So I know if that would be true, Miss Takano would've had to been killed the night before the Festival.

Rena:
But if that's true...

Oishi:
Let me cut to the chase, Miss Ryugu. If this is in fact true, then Miss Takano was already dead before the festival began.
So the only logical conclusion is that the person you met that night was a zombie.
Just kidding. It's probably a mistake.
I'll double-check with the car.
Hello? Are you there?

Rena:
Yeah, sorry. Listen, just please stop them from carrying out their plan. 
I'm going to lay low for a while until things cool down. 
I'll call you when I can.

Kumagai:
Oishi! This things start to look pretty serious, sir.
The Sonozaki family has sent out Tatsuyoshi Kasai to look for Rena Ryugu.

Oishi:
They sent him out!? But Kasai is Akane Sonozaki's right hand man.

Kumagai:
Word on the street is that Rena Ryugu managed to get 'er hands on something that the Sonozaki family doesn't want anyone else to know about.
They wanna find her bad.

Oishi:
I want undercover cops in front of Ryugu's house immediately!

Kumagai:
Well, the other rumor we were hearing is Rena Ryugu stole a ton of cache from the family and then fell off the map entirely.

Oishi:
You idiot! Why the hell am I just hearing about this now?
---
Keiichi:
Rena's gone into hiding?

Mion:
Yeah, it seems police are looking for her, too.

Keiichi:
Why are they looking for her? 
You don't think they found the bodies that we hid, do you?

Mion:
Oh, I guess I forgot to tell you, guys. 
I have those moved to a secret spot Sonozaki family uses.
Yeah, I heard some people talking and it seems there's some plan this summer to chop down a bunch of trees in the forest where we hid the bodies.
So I went ahead and had them moved.
I figured that was the best thing to do.

Keiichi:
I gotcha you.
So why do you think the police are looking for Rena then?

Mion:
I don't know. But I've talked to my people in Okinomiya and asked them to look out for her.
If they find her they'll keep her safe from the police or anyone else.
If my family finds her, her safety is guaranteed at 120%.

Keiichi:
If you find out where Rena is, let me know as soon as you can, okay?

Mion:
Yup. You got it.

Keiichi:
Come on Rena. Let us know where you are so we can help.I know where to look.

Detective A:
They say this is where she liked to go to play.

Detective B:
But you really think she'll be here at this hour.

Detective A:
Well, we struck out everywhere else. Shine your light over there.

Detective B:
Sure.

Detective A:
You see anything?

Detective B:
No. It's too dark.

Detective A:
Come on. Look closely.

Detective B:
Think we should keep looking?

Detective A:
Atsushi, here. Yeah, I can hear you.
What's going on?
The warehouse?
No, that's okay. I got it.

Detective B:
What is it?

Detective A:
They found Rena Ryugu at a warehouse.
Apparently someone spotted her outside.

Detective B:
That's great. So what'll we do?

Detective A:
He said we gotta get her and bring her back.
No matter what it takes.
I'm guessing it's gonna be a chase.

Detective B:
I gets not late enough.

Rena:
I'm at a warehouse?
What just does that mean?

Oishi:
It's probably a mistake.
I'll double-check with the car.
Hello? Are you there?


Rena:
She was right. This is exactly what Miss Takano's theory predicted.
I'm not gonna give up.
Never. Not to them.

Keiichi:
Rena!

Rena:
Now it's Keiichi, huh? 
It just isn't safe here anymore.
I'm sorry but I have to leave now.
I prefer it if you didn't know where I was going. So don't follow me.

Keiichi:
Rena, what's going on? 
What happened to you?
Your neck, it's covered in blood!

Rena:
Oh, this? It's nothing.
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

Keiichi:
Rena...

Rena:
Guess what I did this afternoon.
I decided to go and check on the bodies we buried in the forest while back.
And I found something interesting. 
Do you know what that is? 
They weren't there. 
They're gone. Somebody dug up everything we buried and took it.

Keiichi:
No, that's not it.

Rena:
The only people who even knew those bodies existed are the very same people who helped me bury them.

Keiichi:
Yeah, I know...But there's more to it.

Rena:
Mion did it.

Keiichi:
No! It's not what you are thinking!

Rena:
I don't know why but Mion betrayed me.

Keiichi:
Listen to yourself, Rena. 
You are not making any sense.
Why would she do that?

Rena:
I knew you do this. I knew you would support Mion.

Keiichi:
Rena, listen. I know that bodies are gone.
They're gone because Mion had them dug up.

Rena:
So she did do it!

Keiichi:
But she only did it to help you.
She heard that they were planning dig up a bunch of trees in that area.
So Mion had the bodies moved. 
She did it for you, Rena.
She wouldn't get caught.

Rena:
That's a good story. Unfortunately it's a lie.

Keiichi:
Well, what would you prefer us to do this instead, Rena? 
Just leave the bodies where they were?
We couldn't do that.
We are trying to protect you.

Rena:
It doesn't matter anymore. Listen, Keiichi. 
I'm gonna tell you the truth.
The real truth that you haven't heard before.

Keiichi:
The real truth?

Rena:
The parasite I told you about is more than just a parasite.
It's actually an alien.

Keiichi:
You think it's an alien?

Rena:
They had so consumed human bodies that they were able to control them. 
But eventually someone bright came along and figured it out.
Then try to tell people about it. 
They got rid of Miss Miyo and crated a copy of her instead.
They created a copy of me, too. I'm gonna fight them. And for as long as I live I will never forgive Mion.

Keiichi:
Rena, stop! That's enough!
Aliens have nothing to do with this.
Even they did, I don't care!
You've got trust us, trust Mion! 
We are friends!

Rena:
Shut up!

Keiichi:
No Rena, we made a promise here.
Have you forgotten that. We promised each other.

Rena:
Shuddup!

Keiichi:
Rena!

Rena:
Shuddup! Shuddup! Shuddup! Shuddup! Shuddup! Shuddup! Shuddup!

Keiichi:
Rena!? Rena, are you okay? 
Talk to me.

Rena:
Let me ask you something.

Keiichi:
Sure.

Rena:
Friends aren't supposed to keep secrets from each other, are they?

Keiichi:
Of course not. You shouldn't hide anything from your friends.

Rena:
Then you are a liar.

Keiichi:
Why am I a liar?

Rena:
Liar!! Hahahaha...

Keiichi:
Rena, what are you laughing at?

Rena:
Keiichi, I know... I know everything.
I know what you did before you moved to Hinamizawa.
Surprise? I had detective Oishi do me a favor and check everyone's backgrounds.
You did some pretty awful things before you moved here. 
I can see why you wouldn't want us to know.

Keiichi:
Rena...

Rena:
They say you only went after little girls. 
Is that right? I can't believe someone so dangerous was so close. 
We didn't even know.

Keiichi:
No please. Please don't. Please...
You don't understand. 
It was an accident.

Rena:
What was an accident?
The little shooting rampage you went on.
You only targeted children when you would lie and wait and shoot them with a BB gun as they passed by.
The whole city was terrified. You had members of the PTA standing at every intersection and children had to walk home in groups, didn't they?
I wonder what kind of pervert only targets little girls.
Did you get some kind of cheap thrill doing that? And was (it) because of this cheap thrill, you kept doing it for so long.
But then something happened. Your conscience gotta best to be when you turned yourself into your parents.
But juvenile law is kind, isn't it? 
The suspect's name wasn't revealed to the victims. And because your father is so rich he settled everything out of court.
You were released with nothing more than time serve and a little probation.
And once everything was cleared up, you left town and got on with your life.
It's good to be rich, isn't it?

Keiichi:
That's not it.
Rena...

Rena:
Why didn't you tell us about this?

Keiichi:
I'm sorry.

Rena:
You are the one who told me that friends shouldn't hide things from each other, didn't you?
Keiichi, you are not my friend!!
---
Mion:
I wonder where Rena went. People are starting to spread these silly rumors that she was spirited away.

Satoko:
What's going on with you, Keiichi? You don't look so good today.

Rika:
Mi.

Keiichi:
Mion, Satoko, and Rika too...
There's something I wanna tell you guys.

Mion:
Wow, I had no idea you had something like that hiding in your past.

Keiichi:
I wanna apologize to you guys for keeping it secret.

Mion:
So, Keiichi. I'm curious.What made you wanna come clean and tell us this whole thing now?

Keiichi:
Well,... because I thought I wasn't being a good friend.
I didn't like hiding things from you guys. 

Rika:
Keiichi, what do you expect is gonna happen now that you've told all the personal stuff to us.

Keiichi:
I'm not expecting a thing. It's just that... I don't know. I didn't wanna keep secrets from you.

Mion:
Is there something wrong with not telling your friends everything?
I think it's safe to say we all have things in the past that we'd like to keep to ourselves.
You know, things that are painful or sad or stupid mistakes we made we don't wanna think about.
If having friends means you gotta tell them all that stuff, too, then forget it. 
I don't wanna any friends.

Keiichi:
Yeah, but..

Rika:
Keiichi, there is a really big difference between things you should tell people about yourself and things that are just personal.

Satoko:
Yeah, That's right. And on top of that, if you know for a fact that you are a good personal and you've gotta nothing to be ashamed of.

Rika:
We have a good friendship. We always laugh and have fun together.
Nothing is ever going to change that. And you wanna know why, because we are friends.

Keiichi:
You guys...
---
Keiichi:
I don't know anything about Satoshi.
'Cause no one will tell me the truth about it. 

Mion:
We weren't being like that to upset you. 

Keiichi:
If someone lies to you, they aren't really your friend, are they, are they?
Seems pretty clear that you guys aren't my friends. 

Mion:
Please don't be absent tomorrow.

All right, Keiichi. Hope you get better soon.

Rena:
What? You don't believe me?
---
Mion:
Hey, Keiichi! What's wrong?

Keiichi:
I don't believe it. 
What have I done to them. I killed them. 
They are dead. Rena, Mion are dead.
Satoko:
What's he talking about?

Mion:
Keiichi, I'm fine. I'm right here.

Chie:
Is something wrong with him?

Mion:
No. He is okay. It's nothing.

Satoko:
Yeah, he was just think silly.

Rika:
So, Keiichi, do you remember it now?
That you killed them, both Rena and Mion? 
Keiichi:
I did. But it wasn't here. 
It was in a world just like this.
I don't know why. 
But I became suspicious of my friends and I killed them for it.
Even though now it was so obvious that they were just trying to help me.
I don't know why. But I just wasn't able to see that.
Why couldn't I....
Rika:
I forgive you for it, Keiichi.

Keiichi:
Huh?

Rika:
You did good just now. 
You were able to realize your sin all by yourself.
Unfortunately no one else will understand that sin, or be able to forgive you for it.
But it's okay because I can forgive you of your sin.
And I can understand how amazing you are, too.

Keiichi:
Rika...

Rika:
I also understand this is nothing short of a miracle.
So after going through all this, you should understand what Rena Ryugu is going through.

Keiichi:
I do. She's just like I was back there. 
She really wants to believe her friends but she just can't.
To make it worse, Rena tried to save me by risking her life.
She tried to make me see what I just couldn't see.
She died trying to get me to see this.I'm not gonna give up.
I still have time!
There's a way for this tragedy to be avoided.
Fate isn't written in stone.
I've just gotta grab hold of the situation.
And write the future the way I want it to be written.

Rika:
Just by watching you, I've learned how beautiful the will to fight can be.
I see now a strength like this has the power to overturn fate.
And it's for this reason, I decided to fight along side you.
Regardless of how long it takes to write the future as it should be.

Mion:
Man! Miss Chie is so persistent.

Satoko:
I know. Tell me about it.

Mion:
What's up? 
You look strange, Keiichi?
Hugging!? Weird...
Keiichi:
Please.. forgive me. I'm sorry.
Satoko?:
Wow.

Keiichi:
I'm really sorry.

Mion:
Okay. But what are you sorry about?
I'm afraid I'm just a little confused here.
What exactly have you done?

Keiichi:
It's okay. You don't need to know.
It doesn't really matter anyway.
You just gotta know that I'm sorry.
I won't doubt you guys.
I promise. Not ever.
I just hold that somehow.
You can find it in your heart.
To forgive me for what I did that day.

Rika:
Keiichi...

Oishi:
You gotta be kidding!
You call us out to this fancy restaurant, expect us to believe this crap?
If I didn't know any better, I'd say you are trying to play us.That's true?

Kumagai:
So what you're trying to say is that because this is a personal issue between Rena Ryugu and your daughter, the police should just let you settle it on your own.

Akane:
That's right.

Kumagai:
Sorry, we can't do that. We'll keep doing our job as the police and protect Rena Ryugu.

Mion:
You know, I'd be interested in hearing why the police suddenly feel the need to protect Rena.

Oishi:
Well, I think the reason's pretty obvious.The people we need to protect her from are you,

Akane:
Really. Just what would lead you to believe that we are after her?

Oishi:
That's something you should be asking yourself.

Akane:
Kasai.

Oishi:
What's this?

Akane:
Miyo Takano's scrapbooks.
Unfortunately the one she happened to give to Miss Ryugu were missing from this collection.

Kumagai:
Mind if we take a look?

Akane:
Go right ahead.

Oishi:
Are you absolutely certain these notebooks were put together by Miyo Takano?

Akane:
Of course I am.

Kumagai:
So then do they all talk about the same thing?

Akane:
Exactly the same thing. Feel free to look at them until you're satisfied.

Kumagai:
Oishi, look. This one says the dark world and our world collided causing an invasion of spirits.
I'm afraid this stuff reads like a bad dime-store science fiction.
You really wouldn't try using this as evidence, would you?

Oishi:
No, this one says that everything was caused by subterranean trolls.
Let me ask you a couple of questions. Why ever would Miyo Takano?

Akane:
I have no idea.
Our family knows nothing about the deaths of Miyo Takno and Jiro Tomitake.

Oishi:
Oh, really?!

Mion:
What do you think if you searched our house, the bodies would just turn up?

Oishi:
So why do you wanna get your hands on Rena so badly?

Akane:
If that's the way it appeared to you, that's all mistake.
That's not the case. Let me apologize for that now and clear up any other misconceptions going forward.

Mion:
And as a proof that our actions are totally on the up and up we're gonna leave those scrapbooks with you guys.

Oishi:
I'm gonna let you figure out what to do with this one. I'm beginning to feel like I drank too much.
I think I'd be a lot better off with some fresh air.

Kumagai:
I want you to promise me two things.

Akane:
What would that be?

Kumagai:
First of all, if the Sonozaki family gets their hands on any more of Miyo Takano scrapbooks, you are to hand them over to the police immediately.
And secondly if you do manage to get your hands on Rena Ryugu, you are to hand her over to the police immediately as well.

Akane:
That's fine. I'll gladly agree to both those requests. On one condition. In order to protect Rena Ryugu's rights, the Sonozaki family will assign her a lawyer. And that lawyer will be present at any interrogation that Rena Ryugu is involved in.

Kumagai:
That won't be an issue.

Akane:
Hopefully the good will we both've shown tonight won't have been in vain. Thank you.

When They Cry 
"Atonement" Chapter, Episode 5: Retake.
Can you believe in this?
