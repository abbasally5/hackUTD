  Keiichi:
Tokyo?!

Keiichi's mother:
 That's right.
 Your father's teacher collapsed right before an event.
 We still don't know what happened, but...
 Anyway, now I have to go to Tokyo to help him out.
 And I'm sure I'm going to be there at least two or three days.
 My biggest concern, though, Keiichi, is whether or not you are going to be okay here by yourself.
 I hate to leave you alone like this.

Keiichi:
 Don't worry...
 I'll be fine...
 It'll all work out...
 No problem...

Keiichi:
 There's no way this is gonna work.

Rena:
That's too bad. Your dad must really need your mom's help.

Keiichi:
 What're you talking about? I don't care about if he needs [crap]. It's the food I'm concerned about. Who's gonna feed me.

Satoko:
Stop whining.
 It's no big deal. You just have to learn a couple of dishes and you'll be fine.

Rena:
 She is right. Food always tastes better when you cook it yourself.

Mion:
 Yeah, it's good to fend for yourself sometimes.

Rika:
 Be careful, though.
 We don't want you to cut your fingers off or burning too badly.

Keiichi:
 I ain't got a choice.

Keiichi:
All right!
 Let's do it!
 Bring it on!
 That's right. Just like a master chef doing.
 Ahh...Maybe this is bad...

Satoko:
 What the heck are you doing, Keiichi?!
 Stop standing there! Turn off the gas!

Keiichi:
 Wait!
 What are you guys doin' bursting in to my house like this?!
 It's against the law to break in like that!

Satoko:
 Well, you little arsonist. You were caught red handed tryna burn down your parents' house. That could've easily turned into a huge fire.

Keiichi:
 You're right...
 I guess that really could've turned out bad...

Satoko:
 Of course it could have.

Rika:
If Satoko and I didn't barge in like we did, I bet there would be flames and fire men all over the place by now.

Keiichi:
 Ohh...You're right.
 I'm totally worthless.
 You saved me.
 Thank you.

Satoko:
 Oh, jeez!
 You can't be left alone for a second, can you?

Keiichi:
No, I can't...




Keiichi:
 I gotta say.
 I never thought that Satoko was ever gonna make me dinner.

Satoko:
 I'll tell you what, Keiichi. If all you are gonna do is sit down and watch me cook, then maybe you could be somewhat useful and set the table.
 Rika and I are going to be eating here too. So make sure you do it right and set it for three.

Keiichi:
You got it.

Rika:
 Mii?

Keiichi:
 You seem to be in a good mood tonight, Rika?
 It's a nice change from that nasty mood Satoko's in.

Rika:
 Actually, Satoko's in a really good mood tonight. It's been such a long time since I'd seen her have this much fun.

Keiichi:
 Are you serious?
 She's having fun?

Rika:
 She sure is.
 It's kinda like the time she used to spend with "NiiNii".

Keiichi:
 Ha?
 "NiiNii"...?

Rika:
 Yep, "兄兄", as in brother.
 Satoko has an older brother, you know?

Keiichi:
 I had no idea.

Rika:
She does, and his name is Satoshi.

Keiichi:
Satoshi...

Rika:
When Satoko was with Satoshi, she always used to be as happy as she is tonight.

Keiichi:
 What do you mean..."used to be"...?
 Do the two of them live separately now or something?

Rika:
 Yeah, and it's pretty sad too, because both of them were really close. You know, maybe that's why Satoko want to come by here tonight and see if she could help you with dinner.


Keiichi:
 Wow, it was her idea?

Rika:
 Yup.
 She said we shouldn't leave you alone.
 Even without her brother around, Satoko still behaves like a good sister.

Keiichi:
 Really...


Satoko:
Here you go.

Keiichi:
Thanks!
 Ha...This is great.
 I'm starving.
 The rice is great, Satoko.
 You cooked it perfectly.
 Everything else looks awesome too.

Satoko:
 I'm glad you like it so much, Keiichi. But it's not that big of a deal, I didn't do much. All I did was open the can for the fish and the side dishes are just premade stuff from the grocery store.

[文法]

Keiichi:
 Who cares? It's still a lot of better than what I was gonna make.

Satoko:
 Well, I guess that the fact that you now respect me even just a little bit as a cook is good enough for me.
 I'm good at all kinds stuff.

Rika:
 This turns out to be a really good idea. I like dinner with all of you. It's fun, it's like eating dinner with Satoshi again.

Satoko:
 I really miss those dinners. I wonder why he is right about now? Oh, you don't know, do you? He is my Ni-Ni. Ah, I mean he is my... actually... he is my older brother.

Keiichi:
 Oh, good to know.

Satoko:
 I still find it pretty hard to believe that he thought he could make it on his own at his age. But he wouldn't have run away if he didn't.

Keiichi:
Run away?

Satoko:
 Yeah, but when we're least expecting it, he'll come back.

Keiichi:
 You know, I underestimated you, Satoko.You are so much stronger than I ever gave you credit for.

Satoko:
 Well, I don't know what took you so long. I've always been strong. If you thought differently, it's just 'cause you didn't know how to take all the teasing I give you.

Keiichi:
 You're right. You are a good girl.

Satoko:
 I don't know if you really mean it now. Why am I having a hard time believing you. huh?

Keiichi:
 I'me being serious.You are a good cook and a good girl. Right, huh, Rika?

Rika:
 Yep, you chose the best brand of canned sardines you possibly could.

Satoko:
 Hey, what's that [dead] Mi?

Satoko:
 All right.
 We'll see you tomorrow.

Keiichi:
 Are you sure you guys don't want me to go home with you?
 It's pretty dark out.

Satoko:
 Even if I closed my eyes the whole time, I'd still make it home all right.

Rika:
As long as the two of us are together, there's nothing to be afraid of.

Keiichi:
 OK.

Satoko:
And don't try and get out of brushing your teeth tonight, either.

Keiichi:
 Yes, ma'am.

 What's going on, Rika?
 You forget something?

Rika:
 For today, Keiichi gets a [greatest] gold star. Clap, clap, clap. Good job!
 I bet when we get home, Satoko's going to tell me what a good time she had. Because it was just like having her ni-ni back. Keiichi, next time Satoko teases you maybe you could just play along with it for a while, okay?

Keiichi:
 Tell Satoko I hope her "兄兄"......comes back soon.

Satoko:
 Rika!

Rika:
 I gotta go.
 Have a good night!

Keiichi:
Yup!
 You too!

Keiichi's mother:
 I'm back.

Keiichi:
 Hey, mom.

Keiichi's mother:
 Sorry,Keiichi. Maebara residence. Yes...Oh, sure. Keiichi. phone.

Keiichi:
 What? A different club meeting? Huh? Do or die?
 What do you mean that 'counting you', guys? Never mind. I'll be right there. Just give me a second. Try to hang in there, Satoko! Nobody messes with my friends. Watch out, because Keiichi Maebara is in the house.

Satoko:
 Um...I've got just one question.

Keiichi:
 Yeah...

Satoko:
 What are you doing with a golf club at the baseball game?

Keiichi:
 Oh, you gotta be kidding!

Keiichi:
What I thought was a great big blow was actually just a baseball game between the Hinamizawa Fighters and their rival, the Okinomiya Titans.

Judge:
And Strike!
You out of here, batter.

Keiichi:
I guess I sort of jumped to conclusions when they said they needed some backup.
 Turns out, they just want me to come help out their team, the Hinamizawa Fighters.

Well, even though I made a total fool of myself, it all worked out in the end.

Irie:
Well, if you asked me, looks like they're having a great time.

Keiichi:
You're right.

Irie:
My name's Irie.
 I'm a doctor at a clinic here in Hinamizawa.
 But I also coach little league baseball in my spare time.
 You can just call me coach.
 Everyone else here does.
 I'd be delighted, if you would do the same, Mr. Maebara.

Keeichi:
Sure.

Irie:
When Satoko smiles at you, everything bad in the world just seems to wash away, doesn't it?

Keiichi:
Really?
 I feel differently.
 You know, I don't think that smile would even wash my dishes.

 So, coach, do you have a crush on Satoko or something?

Irie:
I do.
 I like her very much.
 She's just so sweet.
 As a matter of fact, when she gets a little bit older, I intend to ask her to marry me.

 What's this?
 Am I detecting that you have a little crush on Satoko as well, Keiichi?
 That may pose a bit of a problem.
 I had my eye set at that girl for quite some time I won't give up easily.

Keiichi:
You're joking, right?!

Irie:
What?
 Satoko's older brother, Satoshi, used to play for the Hinamizawa Fighters as well.

Keiichi:
Really...

Irie:
I really wanted him to keep on playing for us.
 But I'm afraid he transferred instead.

Keiichi:
Transferred?

Irie:
Tragedy can strike anyone, in many ways.

Keiichi:
What?
Irie:
It's been three years now.
 I think it was around this time of year too...
 When Satoko's parents had their accident...

Keiichi:
Accident?

Irie:
That's right.
 They fell off a viewing platform while on vacation.

Keiichi:
What?
 So, that means Satoko...

Irie:
That's right.
 She's an orphan.
 She and Rika help each other out.
 With both of their parents dead, I bet it can be very lonely for them at times.
 But it seems like they enjoy being there for each other.
 I have to admit there's been a number of occasions when I seriously thought of adapting her.

Keiichi:
Really?
 You do that?

Irie:
I would, but there's just one problem.
 I'm not married and I have no kids.
 I'm not very attractive candidate, so I guess that dream ends there.
 I just never want to see that smile of hers fade away.

Keiichi:
You know, I feel the same way.
 So, hypothetically speaking, if you could adapt her, would you?


Irie:
Hmm...That's a good question.

???:
First thing I would do is make her call me master.
 And then after that, I would train her to be my personal maid.

Keiichi:
Mion?!
 Damn it!
 You're a twin sister Shion, aren't you?!
 Just what are you doing here?!

Shion:
Well, that's easy.
 You clearly don't know.
 I'm here because I'm the Hinamizawa Fighter's team manager.

Keiichi:
Oh, really.
 Well, if you're the manager, why aren't you at the game?

Shion:
Because I do things differently.
 I'm more like a ghost manager for the team.

Irie:
But we really need Shion at the games, they're pretty boring without her here.
 You need to come by and cheer us up from behind like you used to do.

Shion:
Let me think about it.


Shion:
 So Keiichi, rumor has it that you turned out be a major player in today's game.

Keiichi:
 Major player, right.
 The only major player on the field today was Satoko.
 She hit a home run. I had no idea she was such a good athlete.

Shion:
 She is very different from Satoshi. Yep, all the athletic skills in that family must have been past on to Satoko.

Keiichi:
 So then, you knew him too?

Shion:
 What do you know about Satoshi?

Keiichi:
 Well, I've never met him or anything. I just heard few stories. Nothing big... like how after his parent
 passed away he decided to transfer.

Shion:
 Transfer? Tell me. Who told you that? Who said he transferred.

Keiichi:
 Well, I don't know. You are freaked out now. How come ?

Shion:
 You know you're right. Sorry, Keiichi. Just do me a favor when you talk about Satoshi again,
 don't never say that he'd just transferred. Please, I'd appreciate it.
 Looks like your plate is the only one left to be washed. Hurry up.

Keiichi:
 Hey! Hold on!


Rena:
 Hey, it's still June, isn't it?
 It feels like we totally skipped the rainy season this year and then went straight to summer.

Mion:
 Well, I heard that after this weekend, we'll have some more rain coming our way.

Keiichi:
 Hey guys, Satoko has an older brother, doesn't she?
 His name's Satoshi, right?

Rena:
 Yeah, didn't we tell you? She does, but he transferred.

Keiichi:
 Well, I heard he ran away.
 I heard he ran away and hasn't been seen since.
 Wait a sec. Don't get me wrong, I'm not calling you liars.
 It's just...

Mion:
 It's not like we are trying to hide anything from you. It's not what you think, I promise.

Keiichi:
 Then. what is it?

Rena:
 He hasn't been home since the day he left.

Keiichi:
 Well, where did he go?

Rena:
 No one knows.

Mion:
 It was totally out of the blue. Satoshi was just gone one day.
 We searched the entire village for him. We even brought it in a police and had them start looking.
 But nothing ever turned out. And after a while, rumor started circulating
 that he might have just run away for good. When the police looked into it, they discovered that Satoshi had saved up a lot of cash from his part time job.
 But on the day that he went missing, he'd gone to the bank and withdrawn it all.
 Then someone called the police and told them they saw Satoshi boarding a train at Nagoya station

Rena:
 Yeah, but I think that's a lie.
 Satoshi didn't run away from home.

Keiichi:
 Wait a second, if he didn't run away, then...

Mion:
 Let it go, Rena.

Rena:
 This is all about Oyashiro's curse. That's who did it.

Keiichi:
 What curse?

Rena:
 Before Satoshi dissapeared, he and I had a little talk.
 He told me he was being watched...no matter where he went.
 He said it even follows him into his house.
 He said it's the last thing he sees before he goes to sleep... standing there looking down on him.

Mion:
 Rena!

Rena:
 That's definitely a sign of Oyashiro's curse.
 I think some of them may be true.
 I think Satoshi may have wanted to leave Hinamizawa and he may have even tried to run away at some point, but in the end, Oyashiro wouldn't allow that.

Mion:
 I said that's enough.

Rena:
 Oyashiro is the guardian god of Hinamizawa. If anyone ever tries to run away or leave Hinamizawa, he will never forgive them.
 I apologized for it and I was okay, but Satoshi wouldn't, he wouldn't apologize. That's why he did it. That's why Oyashiro decided to curse him.

Keiichi:
 You think this is all because of that curse?

Rena:
 Even if the police start insisting that he ran away from home. There's no way I'm ever going to believe that. It's a lie. It's a lie made up by all the people who refuse to believe in the curse. But that won't stop him, nothing will. Oyashiro doesn't care if you believe in the curse or not...

Mion:
 I thought I told you to stop it, Rena.
 Hey Keiichi, didn't I say earlier I had some manga I would loan you. Wanna come by and get it now?

Keiichi:
 Ah, yeah, I can do that.

Rena:
 Okay, well if you're going to do that, then I'm going ahead home.

Mion:
 Sounds good, Rena. See you tomorrow.

Rena:
 Yep, see you tomorrow.

Mion:
 Relax. Don't stress about all that.

Keiichi:
 No, I'm not stressed.
 I just feel bad about bringing all up.

Mion:
 Look, it's not like we are trying to hide Satoshi from you.
 It's just the... it's not something we like to talk about very much.　Do you know anything about Oyashiro's curse?
 Have you heard of it before today?

Keiichi;
 Yeah, but I haven't heard very much.

Mion:
 Satoshi's parents supported the dam project.

 And they did, right up until they died.

Keiichi:
 What? Wow, I had no idea.
 I thought everyone in Hinamizawa was opposed to the dam.

Mion:
 No, it varied from person to person.
 For the most part everyone was opposed to it, but there were a handful who supported it.
 Satoshi's parents were probably the biggest supporter and try to sway people to their side.
 The federal government had set aside a whole a lot of money to buy out the people of Hinamizawa. And word of that got out there started to be more supporters. Everyone wanted the money. It just so happens that by some strange twist when Satoshi's parent had their accident, it was on the same day as Oyashiro's festival. That's why everyone in town thinks it has to do with Oyashiro's curse.

Keiichi:
 So then, when it comes to Satoshi running away, everyone in the village thinks that too as just another part of the curse?

Mion:
 Yeah, something like that.
 For Satoko, hearing these stories about her parents' deaths and her brother running away from home and especially all those stories about Oyashiro's curse, these things could be really hard for her to take some times.

Keiichi:
 I'm sure.

Mion:
 So that's why we didn't say anything. We just tried to avoid the subject whenever we can. Same things goes when people ask about Satoshi. Everybody just lies and says he transferred to another school.

Keiichi:
 I can see why. Sorry about bring this all up.

Mion:
 It's cool.

Keiichi:
 Well, see you tomorrow.

Mion:
 Hey, Keiichi.This doesn't just go for Satoko, but for Rena too.
 If you can, try not to bring this up around her either.

Keiichi:
 Why?

Mion:
 You saw what happened today? I don't know why, but whenever you bring up Oyashiro's curse, she gets really upset. I mean like almost uncontrollable. She's been that way since she transferred back.

Keiichi:
 How come? Why does she get so whelmed up over this?

Mion:
 It's because...
 Hey, this is a major secret. You can't tell her I told you this.

Keiichi:
 I won't say anything.

Mion:
 According to her, Rena was actually cursed by Oyashiro once.
 No motter what you're trying to tell her, she completely believes this.
 You can't even joke about it.
 Normally Rena's a pretty easy going girl, but when you bring this up, she gets really scary.

Keiichi:
 I got it. I won't bring up Satoshi anymore.
