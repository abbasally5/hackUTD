  Man A:
You [don't know] okay there, kiddo?
I'm getting you a doctor right now.
Just gotta hang in there a little while longer.
I think you know better, but just tell the doctor what you have to, okay?
Last thing we wanna do is hurt you, I promise.

Irie:
Who's this?
He's not from the village, is he?

Man A:
No, I'm looking after a friend of mine's kid.

Irie:
Friend of yours, huh?
You don't look so good.
Why don't you show me where it hurts?
How did a little boy like you get a big scar like that?

Toshiki:
I got it last winter in a car accident.

Irie:
Accident?
Oishi:
So Akasaka, are you getting nervous there?

Akasaka:
No, I'm good.

Oishi:
We’re gonna be fine.
I gave the guys at the station a heads-up.
I told them we are going to Hinamizawa.
The way I look at it, you can't be too prepared out here.
Forewarned is forearmed.

Akasaka:
Rika?

Oishi:
Takatsudo is just up around this next band.
Whatever you do, kid, make sure you keep your safety gear on.
This was a thriving community up until a few years ago.

Akasaka:
This place is like a ghost town.
How was his wallet even found out here?

Oishi:
Folks in neighboring villages tend lands up in these mountains.
They pass through here every morning and every night.

Akasaka:
They pass through here on foot?

Oishi:
No, they drive their cars as far as they can, and walk the rest.

Akasaka:
Are you telling me someone spotted this wallet on the side of the road while they were driving?

Oishi:
No, the person who found the wallet was stopped at the time
It seems they were having some stomach trouble when they pulled over to take a dump.
Apparently that's when they found the wallet.

Akasaka:
That makes more sense.

Oishi:
Huh? Dr. Irie, greetings.

Irie:
Well, hello there, Detective Oishi.
This is a rather odd place for us to be meeting, isn't it?

Oishi:
That's exactly what I was gonna say, Doctor?
So, what's going on?
What brings you out here?
You find somebody sick?

Irie:
Yes, I had a house call.

Oishi:
Oh, hope it wasn't serious.

Irie:
No, however something just didn't seem right.

Man B:
Do you think they're from the forest service?

Man A:
No, I think it's the police.

Man A:
I'll buy some time.
You take the kid, and skip out the back.

Man B:
Okay. Got it.

Oishi:
Open the door, please.
This is the police.
We got some questions for you, won't take but a second.

Man A:
No problem. I'll be right there.

Akasaka:
Stop. Police.

Akasaka:
Hey, is your name Toshiki Inukai?

Toshiki:
Yeah.

Man B:
And who the hell are you?

Akasaka:
There's no way you getting out of this.
If you're smart, you'll give up,

Man B:
Oh, really?
If you are smart, you'll hand over the kid.

Akasaka:
Backup is already on its way.
You'll be surrounded in a matter of minutes.

Akasaka:
Hey, Oishi.
What happened to Oishi?

Man A:
Well, I kicked his ass, and left him drooling in the mud.

Akasaka:
Bastard.

Toshiki:
Mister? Are you okay?

Akasaka:
Don't worry about me.

Man A:
That was just a warning shot.
Don't make me take it further.

Akasaka's wife:
Your baby and I will be waiting for you.

Akasaka:
I got it, Oishi.

Oishi:
Well, I believe that makes it check and checkmate.

Man A:
This isn't over.

Oishi:
Let's go.

Akasaka:
Why are you standing there?

Oishi:
Nothing I can do.
I can't catch those two by myself.
They knew that when they took off.
And a cop can't shoot someone in the back even if they are running away from them.
Sorry, but there is no way I lose my retirement pension over this.
So, you are cabinet minister Inukai's grandson.

Toshiki:
Ah, yeah.

Oishi:
We're gonna have ourselves a big case whether we want it or not.
Someone will go down as a scapegoat.
I guarantee it.
Akasaka?

Irie:
Are you feeling okay?
You’re lucky.
The bullet went clean out the other side.
But you shouldn't move for 24 hours.

Akasaka:
Aren't you the doctor that we...

Irie:
My name's Irie. Now rest.
And if you need anything, please let me know.

Oishi:
How're you doing there, kid?

Akasaka:
Well, not used to chases and gun fights. I’m exhausted.
How's it going?
We're able to make any arrest?

Oishi:
Unfortunately.

Akasaka:
What about the grandson?

Oishi:
He's doing fine.
They've taken care of him at the station.

Akasaka:
That's good to hear.

Oishi:
Hey, I've still got one more bit of news for you.
There is a rumor going around that the minister is gonna scrap the Hinamizawa dam project.

Akasaka:
Scrap it? You mean like for good?

Oishi:
I think it was probably the deal he made to get his grandson back.
Now everyone's happy.
And I bet he agreed to their ransom before you and I ever got within ten feet that boy.

Akasaka:
But if that's true...

Oishi:
If it's true, it means that even if you hadn't gone out there and gotten yourself shot, Toshiki would've still been released.
Akasaka, it's entirely possible that there're some force or even an entire organization behind all this.
You know, something that's far more powerful than we could ever imagine.

Akasaka:
What are you talking about?

Oishi:
Well, I got some ideas, but they're just speculations right now.
Those two guys, we were fighting with them in the mountains.
Those guys weren't amateurs.
They knew what they were doing.

Akasaka:
Hired guns?

Oishi:
I don't know where they came from.
But you're not gonna pull some punk off the street and have them fight as well as those two did.

Akasaka:
Yeah, they were pretty good.

Oishi:
Yep, and his marksmanship was spot-on, too.
But I guess that doesn't really solve anything, does it?
Still big mystery.

Akasaka:
Huh? You’re kidding.
What the hell's going on?
Every line's been cut.
It's you.

Rika:
Hey, what are you doing?
Sick people shouldn't be sneaking out of the hospital, you know?

Akasaka:
Did you do this?
Did you cut all the phone lines?

Rika:
Even if you were able to call her, it would only make you sad.

Akasaka:
What? How do you know?

Akasaka:
You want me to just go back to the hospital, don't you.

Rika:
It would probably be better.
Do you know how to get back to the hospital from here?

Akasaka:
Yeah.

Akasaka:
So, I'm guessing your house is in the same direction, huh?

Rika:
Yep, it sure is.

Akasaka:
Great.
This is it.
Now am I right?
Your house is this great big old shrine, isn't it?

Rika:
Yeah, I guess you could say that.
Hey, did you know the festival starts today?

Akasaka:
What festival?

Rika:
Hinamizawa only has one festival every year.
And it's this one, the Cotton Drifting Festival.

Akasaka:
Cotton Drifting?

Rika:
They call it a festival, but it's actually kind of boring.
You wanna check it out?

Akasaka:
Sure.

Rika:
See? Not much of a festival, is it?

Akasaka:
You are right.
This really doesn't look like much of a festival.

Rika:
It's too bad.
The Cotton Drifting Festival isn't supposed to be like this.

Akasaka:
Huh?

Rika:
I like that when you look at the village from up here, it seems so peaceful.

Akasaka:
Rika. Remember when you told me the dam project would never go through?
What made you think that?
How can you really know that for sure?

Rika:
I don't really understand what you’re saying, it all sounds too adult for me.

Akasaka:
Well, you should be glad at least.

Rika:
Glad for what?

Akasaka:
Glad of, know, there would be peace in this village once again.

Rika:
Peace? In this village?

Akasaka:
Yeah.

Rika:
But every year from now on out, gruesome things are going to happen.
Not peace.
In a few years, someone is going to kill me.

Akasaka:
What are you talking about?
Who would kill you? And why?

Rika:
It's already been decided.

Akasaka:
Been decided?
What kind of monster would decide something like that?

Rika:
Akasaka, this place is full of people who think nothing if taking another life.
It's possible that what I'm about to tell you will change nothing.
But maybe, it's the right stone to be tossed on the surface of the water to crack the reflection of moons staring down on us like Death.

Akasaka:
What are you talking about, Rika?

Oishi:
Akasaka. How many years has it been now?

Akasaka:
Far too long. How are you, Oishi?

Akasaka:
A few years after the kidnapping case wrapped up, I met with Detective Oishi again.
After he retired, Detective Oishi moved into his mother's house in Sapporo.
I guess I wanted to see him from nothing else to confirm a suspicion I had.
That's my daughter, Miyuki. She's like a reincarnation of my wife Yukie.
That's right. My wife passed away.
She died on the night of the Cotton Drifting Festival.
The nurses later told me that every evening Yukie would go upon the roof-top to watch the sunset.
On the day of the Cotton Drifting Festival after the sun is set, she took the stairs back to her room like she always did.
Except this time she slipped, landed at a bad angle.
One of the nurses befriended Yukie and asked what made her climb north stairs every day to watch the sunset.
Yukie told her it was for me.
When I was far away under the same sky, she wanted to pray for my safety.

Akasaka:
Did you do this? Did you cut all the phone lines?

Rika:
Even if you were able to call her, it would only make you sad.

Akasaka:
And she was right.
Rika took pity on me, knowing all along that Yukie had died.

Rika:
Go back to Tokyo. I mean it.
If you stay here, I promise you'll regret it.

Akasaka:
If I'd known what was going to happen, I would've dropped what I was doing immediately, and headed straight for Tokyo.
Maybe then, Yukie's death could’ve been prevented.
But unfortunately, I had no idea.

Oishi:
Okay. Fine. Let's say what you’re proposing is true.
Rika Furude was actually a prophet with the ability to predict the future.
Okay. So, if you’re right, why didn't she see that big disaster coming?

Akasaka:
It was the end of June 1983, and it was a major disaster on an epic big scale, poisonous volcanic gas began to seep out from Onigafuchi swamp.
It flowed directly into the village.
And by midnight, everyone was dead.
The district of Hinamizawa's still under heavy quarantine to this day.

Oishi:
Well, hold on.
You could theorize that Rika Furude was the reincarnation of Oyashiro.
And when Rika was murdered, Oyashiro's wrath got raised.
Out of nowhere a noxious gas seeped out of the swamp.
As a result, the entire village was wiped away.
To be fair, I didn't come up with this little theory on my own.
This belief is held by anyone from Hinamizawa who managed to survive that night.
Just ask around.

Akasaka:
Wait a sec.
Did you just say that Rika was murdered?

Oishi:
I did.
It happened about mid-day before the gas leak.
An elderly couple had come up to the shrine, just looked around when they found Rika's dead body.
They got a little more than they bargained for.

Akasaka:
She was really murdered?

Oishi:
She was completely naked.
We weren't able to figure her out much.
What we do know, she'd been pumped with so many drugs she turned into a coma.
After that, someone carried her into the shrine, sliced her open, and ripped all the internal organs out.

Akasaka:
A coma?
So then, they cut her open when she was alive?
I knew it.
It's just like I thought.

Oishi:
What do you mean you knew it?

Akasaka:
Oishi. What do you make of all these deaths that keep happening every year along with the revival of Oyashiro's curse?

Oishi:
Listen, son.
You have the advantage of looking at these deaths with hindsight.
Something we didn't have at the time because we were so caught up in it.
Even though all of those deaths spell on the same day each year, the day of the festival, we just saw as coincidence.
We kept thinking, "this year it's gonna be fine. No more bizarre accidents."

Akasaka:
But I don't think it was a coincidence.
That little girl managed to predict all of it.

Oishi:
What girl? Rika Furude?

Akasaka:
Exactly.
She told me precisely who was gonna die and when.
As if it had already been decided long ago.
And that's why I'm here.
Five murders have now been attributed to the curse of Oyashiro.
I came back to figure out the link between those murders and Rika Furude, the little girl who predicted all of them.

Oishi:
Well, interesting.
I guess if you put these two together, you have to start wondering if all these murders had been premeditated long before the first death occurred.
So, what is all this mean?

Akasaka:
I don't know.
But in addition to all the other murders, Rika even correctly predicted her own.
The girl knew she was going to die.

Oishi:
Okay, if Rika knew she was gonna die.
Then tell me why she never tried to run away.
Why would the girl at her age just accept her death, instead of doing everything to prevent it?
It doesn't make any sense.
If she knew she was gonna die, why didn't she ask someone for help?

Akasaka:
She did ask.
She did try to reach out.
But unfortunately, that person couldn't see it.
That person was me.

Rika:
Next year on the very same day in June 1979, the manager of the dam site is going to die.

Akasaka:
Huh? Are you sure about this?

Rika:
His body will be cut into several pieces and thrown away.

Akasaka:
Dismembered?

Rika:
On the same day of the following year in June of 1980, Satoko's parents will be pushed from a cliff and murdered as well.

Akasaka:
Satoko?

Rika:
And a year after that, again on the same day of June in 81, my parents will be murdered.
Then on the same day of the following year in June 1982, Satoko's mean aunt will have her head cracked open and die as well.
There is more.
In June of 1983, maybe on the same day, maybe later, there will be another murder.
This time it will be me.

Akasaka:
You?

Rika:
If all the deaths have already been planned in advance, then surely this last step is part of that same plan.
But the real question is who's the person planning all of this?

Akasaka:
What are you trying to say, Rika?

Rika:
I just want to live a happy life.
That's all I want.
I want to have fun and laugh, and spend my days surrounded by all my friends.
Nothing more than that.
Am I asking for too much, and just don't know it?

Akasaka:
Rika, I...

Rika:
I don't wanna have to die.

Akasaka:
Even today, the quarantine that surrounds the Hinamizawa district still in effect.


What you'll find is the place of your kindness.
What we'll fall is the labyrinth into sadness.
What we'll begin to burn is your feelings of hatred.
