  Keiichi:
Hey, Rika.
 So, Satoko's absent again?

Rika:
 Mii...

Rena:
 It's taking her a while to get over this cold.
 I hope she starts getting better soon...

Keiichi:
 Yeah, me too.




Keiichi:
Here.

Okamura:
 Thanks, Keiichi!

Tomita:
 Yeah!
 You are the coolest guy in school.

Keiichi:
 Just remember that you guys owe me one.

Kids:
No problem!
All you gotta do is with us!

Keiichi:
I wish my life were simple as theirs is...

Oish:
Well, well, good afternoon.
 Sorry to bother you...on your lunch break, you know.

Keiichi:
O... OK...

Oishi:
 Listen, son.
 I'm from the Okinomiya Police Department.
 Name is Oishi.

Keiichi:
Well, if you're looking for a teacher, you need to go over there.

Oishi:
No.
 I don't think that will be necessary.
 I'm looking for Satoko Hojo.
 Could you ask her to come out here for me?

Keiichi:
What does the police...want to talk to Satoko about...?

Oishi:
Ahh...
 Don't worry.
 Just relax.
 It's nothing serious,
 I promise.
 ...What seems to be the problem here, kid?
 Can't I see this girl without an appointment?
 ...Well, hello, girls.
 You look like you're nice kids.
 Be good girls and do me a favor.
 Call Satoko Hojo out here for me.

Girl:
 Ahh...we would if we could, but Satoko's absent today.

Oishi:
"Absent" you say?!
 Well, that's no good!
 Guess I'm just out of luck today.
 Hey, maybe you can help me out with something else.
 What's the name of this guy over here?

Girl:
 Well, yeah, that's Keiichi Maebara.

Oishi:
 Oh...very interesting...
 So, you are part of the Maebara family, huh?
 Word around town is that your dad is some kind of famous artist.

Keiichi:
 So, what?!
 Why do you care?!

Oishi:
 I wouldn't be making any enemies, son.
 This really isn't the place to do something like that.
 Know what I mean...?
 See, people tend to hold grudges here.
 And trust me, the last thing you want [to/is] some odd grudge coming back to hurt you. 

Irie:
 I think you've gone too far enough.
 Don't you?

Oishi:
 Well, if it isn't Dr. Irie.
 Funny I should see you here.
 I was just thinking I should stop by your office later and pay your visit.
 But every time I've been violently, you've been far too busy to take the time to talk to me.

Irie:
 Sorry, perhaps you should bring a warrant next time.
 But until then I believe I still have the right to refuse questioning if I choose.
 That's Kuraudo Oishi. He's with the local police.

Keiichi:
 I gather that.

Keiichi:
 I can't believe there's no bruises. What he did really hard.

Irie:
 I'm sorry. He does this kind of thing often I'm afraid.

Keiichi:
 It's weird. He said he wanted to talk to Satoko for some reason.

Irie:
 He wanted Satoko.
 He just doesn't give up, does he?

Keiichi:
 Does he come looking for Satoko on a regular basis?

Irie:
 Tell me Keiichi. I'm assuming by now that you've at least heard a little bit about
 Satoko and Oyashiro's curse.

Keiichi:
 Well, I know Satoko's parents were some of the people who supported the dam.
 And I know some people think their death can be blamed just part of Oyashiro's curse.

Irie:
 After their parents passed away, Satoko and her brother moved in with their uncle and his wife. With them being part of their family, it seems like the best thing to do.

Keiichi:
 Well, I guess that makes sense.

Irie:
 You would think, however this particular uncle they moved in with was their father's younger brother.

Keiichi:
 What's wrong with that?

Irie:
 Plenty.
 I had heard when they first moved in with their uncle, both of their lives began to get incredibly difficult for each of them.

Keiichi:
 Huh? What do you mean by "difficult"?

Irie:
 Their uncle he beat them.
 However for good or bad, their uncle's wife was found beaten to death by some deranged drug addict on the night of last year's cotton drifting festival.
 The entire village started to believe that this death was not just a random accident, but rather another example of Oyashiro's curse. The uncle began to fear that Oyashiro's curse awaited him as well, and went into hiding. The rumor is that he slinked off to live with some mistress in Okinomiya.

Keiichi:
 So then. with him gone, Satoko was freed.

Irie:
 Yes, but there's more.
 That man we met today started nosing around. And he seemed to take over right where her uncle left off.

Keiichi:
 What man?

Irie:
 That Oishi guy.

Keiichi:
 But why? Why does he do it? What makes him keep coming back and harassing Satoko?

Okamura:
We heard a rumor that kind of worries us.

Keiichi:
 Well, what is it?

Okamura:
We heard....

Tomita:
He is back again.

Keiichi:
 Stop being so cryptic,
 Who's back again?

Okamura:
We heard Satoko's uncle's back.

Keiichi:
 Why do you think her uncle coming back has anything to do with Satoko being absent from school for so long.

Okamura:
I don't know.
I guess we just thought...

Keiichi:
 Thought what!? Spit it out already!
 Sorry.

Okamura:
It's alright.

Keiichi:
 Poor Satoko...



Keiichi:
So this is her place.
Hey, coach?

Irie:
Keiichi. Well, what a surprise! What brings you here?

Keiichi:
Satoko!?

Satoko:
I was on my way back from doing some grocery shopping and I happened to run into the coach .
And I was carrying a whole lot of stuff, so he offered to give me a ride home.

Irie:
Think what've been impossible for her to carry everything she had on just this bicycle.

Keiichi:
Satoko, this all for you?

Teppei:
Hey, Satoko.
Do you know that you left the kettle on when you left, worthless brat!

Satoko:
I'm sorry, but you told me it was really important that I get the food you wanted.

Teppei:
Moron!
Look who's here.
It's the Dashing doctor Irie.

Irie:
I ran into Satoko on her way back from the market.

Teppei:
Just by chance, huh?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

Tsubaki:
Hey, Teppei

Teppei:
What is it, Tsubaki? You get another reach again?

Satoko:
My uncle's got some friends from out of town.
They're playing mahjong right now.

Keiichi:
What's wrong with that guy?
He plays mahjong all day? And since [you/you're] off to get his groceries for him?
Hey, what's up with the bruises? Who did this to you?
Was it him? I'll kill him.

Irie:
I know how you feel. But you have to restrain yourself right now.

Satoko:
Thanks for caring so much, Keiichi.
It's sweet.

Keiichi:
Satoko...

Satoko:
You know, for a second, I could've sworn you look just like my Ni-Ni.
Unfortunately, I don't have my real Ni-Ni anymore. But that's okay, now I've got a new Ni-Ni named Keiichi.

Keiichi:
And I promise you I'm never gonna run away.

Teppei:
Satoko! Hurry up! Bring up food in already!

Keiichi:
 Where could have Satoshi run off to?

Irie:
 No one knows.
 We just know he left.

Keiichi:
 I don't get it. If he was gonna leave why didn't he take Satoko with him.

Irie:
 I'm sure when Satoko learned he was gone, she started wondering the exact same thing. Now she thinks her brother left her, because she was a burden to him, I'm afraid.

Keiichi:
 Poor girl...

Irie:
 I did some reserch and found that under the Child Welfare Act that's possible to remove the child from a parent or guardian, but only if you can prove the child's life is in danger. The problem is Satoko doesn't want me to do that.

Keiichi:
 Why wouldn't she?

Irie:
 She thinks putting up with her uncle's abuse is some kind of test.
 She feels it's something she has to endure. She wants to be able to overcome this ordeal without the help from anyone. She honestly believes that when she's strong enough to handle her uncle, then her brother will come back home.

Keiichi:
 Yeah, but what about all the abuse?

Irie:
 She won't admit it's true.

 Keiichi:
What?

 Irie:
 If there's a clear cut case of child abuse, then of course a social worker will come and remove the child from the home. Even if the child denies the abuse and wants to stay. However, in Satoko's mind, that would mean nothing short of defeat. I think the only thing keeping Satoko going is her desire to become stronger, hoping that will finally bring her brother home.

Keiichi:
 Fine. But if I think Satoko's in danger. I won't think twice about reporting him. I don't care if Satoko hates me for doing it. I just won't let her get hurt.

Irie:
 Why would you ever do that to her? Why?


Tomitake:
 Excuse me, you are Hinamizawa local, right?

Keiichi:
 Yeah?

Tomitake:
 Then maybe you can help me out. I'm kind of lost. Can you tell me how to get to the Furude Shrine?

Keiichi:
 Well, I'm going that way, so if you don't mind walking with me, I can take you there.

Tomitake:
 My name's Tomitake. I'm a freelance photographer.

Keiichi:
 I'm keiichi.

Takano:
 Well, hello there, Keiichi. How are you?

Tomitake:
 What's this? You two know each other?

Keiichi:
 Ah...I guess...

Takano:
 It's okay, Keiichi. You don't remember me, do you?

Keiichi:
 Sorry.

Tomitake:
 You can't forget Mio Takano. She works as a nurse at the local clinic.

Takano:
 Don't worry about it. We weren't formally introduced; I've just seen you are passing.

Keiichi:
 Oh...okay.

Tomitake:
 So it seems like you're kind of famous around here.

Takano:
 What I think he is referring to is your dad being a famous painter than he is.

Keiichi:
 Are both of you guys freelance photographers?

Takano:
 No, no, he is far better than I am.
 I'm really just an amateur and he has been kind enough to offer me a few pointers.

Tomitake:
 The cotton drifting starts in just a couple of days. I wanna take pictures of a whole event, including the set up I'll be doing tomorrow.

Keiichi:
 When you say cotton drifting, what you really mean... is one they pay thanks to Oyashiro.

Takano:
 That's right. Many believe that Oyashiro is still the guardian of Hinamizawa.

Tomnitake:
 And he curses anyone whoever tries to harm the village. You know, I've been wondering. Who do you think he is gonna curse this year?

Keiichi:
 Are you talking about all the murders?

Takano:
 Yes.

Keiichi:
 Do you guys really think someone can die from a curse?

Tomitake:
 Well, curse or not, all those deaths did occur.

Takano:
 I have a theory; what if these deaths suggest someone imitating the curse, using it as a convenient cover up.

Keiichi:
 Do you know something about these deaths that nobody else does?

Takano:
 Um...well I guess I don't see how telling you could do any harm.

Rika:
 I was really starting to get worried. I was afraid you are going to start being absent next.

Rena:
 Teacher said, Satoko called in and said her cold is still pretty bad.

Rika:
 Since she has been sick for so long, we thought we should go by her house and try to cheer her up after school today.

Keiichi:
 How can you even say something like that, Rika?
 Everybody here knows that Satoko really isn't sick.
 We can only show her some respect and stop pretending about it.

Mion:
 Who'd you hear this from?

Keiichi:
 I saw it, yesterday.

Rena:
 You're not the only one who's upset, Keiichi.
 Everyone here is.

Keiichi:
 Sorry.

Mion:
 Stand and bow.

Good bye!
Mion:
 Time to go, Keiichi.
 You're probably not in a mood to do the club thing today, are ya?

Keiichi:
 Oh, Mion. Hey, would it be okay with you if I came over to your house today?
 I, er, I wanna borrow some of your manga if you don't mind.

Mion:
 Huh? Yeah, sure.

Mion:
 So, what is it? Go ahead. You've got something you wanna talk about, right?

Keiichi:
 I do... and it's something pretty serious, too.
 Don't freak out or anything. I mean this may seem like something out of the blue...but let me say it. I know you're next in line to lead the three great families of Onigafuchi village. And I know that with that position comes a whole lot of power.

Mion:
Who told you this?

Keiichi:
 Eh? That's...not important right now.

Mion:
 I have to say, Keiichi. It looks like you're learning things about me that may or may not be true. But go on, say what you came here to say.

Keiichi:
 You know about Oyashiro's curse, right?
 You see, I don't know who exactly they're thinking the place in the curse upon this year, but...please make it Satoko's uncle if it isn't already. I don't know a whole lot about Oyashiro's curse, but from what I do know... I just

Mion:
 So you're insinuating that the three great families are led by us... and we, as a villege-curse people. Is that right?

Keiichi:
 Hey, listen. I don't really care what all your involvement into the curse is. The [who/whole] is absolutely no interest for me. It's just that...if you know who to talk to, then maybe you could pull some strings and get them to help out a little bit. All I want you to do Mion is to
 ask them to take out Satoko's uncle, please!

Mion:
 So, Keiichi, you wanted to come to my house and call me a murderer.

Keiichi:
 I don't care, Mion. I don't care if you are part of this curse.
 I don't even care if you're the one who acts it out. The only thing I care about right now is saving Satoko, and the only way I see we could do that
 is that he is the next target.

Mion:
 Stop! I'm sorry but I need to start preparing dinner for my family.
 So I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, Keiichi.

Keiichi:
 Mion?

Mion:
 Listen. I totally understand how you feel. But I'm telling you right now that I don't have the clout that you think I do. However if I was somehow in the position to tell the three great families what to do, then I would probably grant your wish without hesitation. But that isn't the case, Keiichi. I'm no more than just a daughter in this family. I know what people say about us. There's a rumor about the Sonozaki family that I'm sure you caught wind of. But please know that no matter what you've heard, we would never commit murder.

Keiichi:
 Sorry.

Rena:
 Hey! Look, it's Satoko's shoes.
 She is back.

Mion:
 Looks like it.

Keiichi:
 Just 'cause she is back, doesn't mean she is okay.

Keiichi:
 Satoko!

Satoko:
 What is wrong with you? What are you doing running in here and shouting so early?

Rena:
 Hi, Satoko.

Satoko:
 Tell me, which one of you called child services, huh? You [had/have] no idea what a huge mess that caused.

Keiichi:
 Child services, at your house?

Satoko:
 They came bursting into our house, and then quickly got both me and my uncle really upset. It was awefull.

Mion:
 Did anything happen to your uncle?

Satoko:
 We said there had been a few misunderstandings lately, and apologize for any inconvenience that may has caused then.

Keiichi:
 Nn?

Rika:
 Me.

Keiichi:
 So, what is it?

Rika:
 Satoko told the protective services officer that there was nothing wrong and sent him away.

Keiichi:
 Do you know who called it?

Rika:
 Our teacher, Miss Chie did.

Keiichi:
 She knows about it, too?

Rika:
 Of course, she does. She is our homeroom teacher, you know?

Keiichi:
 She sent him away all on her own then, huh?

Rika:
 Looks like it.

Keiichi:
 Tell me, Rika. Even though Satoko denies it, he is abusing her, right?

Rika:
 This is the third time it's been reported now.
 Before this, there were two more reports of abuse, but those were long before her uncle came.


Keiichi:
Before?


Rika:
Yeah, those reports came when she was still living with her mother and father, but even then there was still kinda weird. You see, that guy wasn't Satoko's real father after all.

Keiichi:
 Really?

Rika:
 Satoko's mother had remarried a few years earlier. But both Satoshi and Satoko were from a former marriage, and so they had no blood relation to that guy. Even before Satoko was left in care for uncle, she's had pretty bad luck. I don't know if she's ever had a decent home life.
 She really hated her step father and tried to tear [he/him] and her mother apart. She even went so far as to call the abuse hotline one day. And lied to them about her step father hitting her. But eventually they found out the truth.

Keiichi:
 So do they think she is just lying this time, too?

Rika:
 I don't know. It's hard to say. But they obviously didn't feel they need to take her away from her uncle, did they?

Keiichi:
 I can't believe that, so do you think they are just planning on observing the case now, 'cause they think Satoko's lying again?

 Satoko...

Satoko:
Finally, it's lunch time, my favorite part of the day.

Rena:
 Hey, check it out. I made a rice omelet today.

Satoko:
 That looks great, Rena. Keep cooking like that, and you'll be able to pick any husband you want.

Rena:
Really? Do you honestly think so?

Keiichi:
Satoko...

Satoko:
 I'm sorry...I'm really sorry...
