Shion:
What is it?

Mion:
Shion? It's me.

Shion:
Mion. Doesn't sound like you're at home. Where are you calling from?

Mion:
I'm calling from a pay phone. So, I'm sorry, but I gotta make this short. Listen, I just got a call. It was Satoshi.

Shion:
He called you? Why?

Mion:
He said he wanted to apologize for what happened at school yesterday. But seeing how I wasn't there, I thought it would be better if you have that conversation with him. So I told him to give me a minute, then I call him right back. I'm gonna give you the number, are you ready?

Shion:
Uh, yeah. Go ahead.

Satoshi:
Hello, Hojo house.

Shion:
Uh, hey. It's me, Mion.

Satoshi:
Oh, I hope I wasn't bothering you when I called before. Everything okay?

Shion:
Yeah, everything's fine.

Satoshi:
I'm sorry about yesterday.

Shion:
Uh, No! I should be apologizing.

Satoshi:
You don't have to apologize, Mion. It was me who was out of line. Listen. I'm never gonna forgive the people who've made our lives what they are today. I know, in all likelihood, those are people who are probably pretty close to you. But I don't think for a second that you are one of them. So, that's why I thought it was best if I called and apologized.

Shion:
No, you don't need to do that. I was out of line, too. I never once try to see things from your prospective. Speaking of which, how's everything going? Are you okay? I know it must be hard.

Satoshi:
Well, I quit my job. My next paycheck should give me to the dollar amount I was saving for her. But it's really Satoko who's having the hardest time.

Shion:
I'm sure, I bet she is going through a lot right now. Is she okay?

Satoshi:
What do you think? Does she look like she's okay to you?

Shion:
No, you're right. I'm sorry. That was insensitive.

Satoshi:
I don't know what to do. She's just very hanging in there. I was thinking... she needs to go out and have fun. Even if it's just for a night.

Shion:
Well, anyplace specific?

Satoshi:
Tomorrow, the cotton drifting festival starts, remember? I was wondering if you won't mind taking her there for me?

Shion:
Sure, no problem. I don't mind, but why?

Satoshi:
Huh?

Shion:
Why wouldn't you wanna take her to the festival instead of me.

Satoshi:
I can't. I have plans. I mean I'd like to go, but I got a few things I've gotta wrap up [at / a] work. So, there's no way I'm gonna make it to the festival.

Shion:
I understand.

Satoshi:
Thanks a lot, Mion. Hey, Mion? You don't believe in it, do you?

Shion:
In what?

Satoshi:
Believe in Oyashiro...and a curse?

Shion:
Huh? Ahahaha! Are you serious?

Satoshi:
They say Oyashiro will curse anyone who tries to leave the village. Is it true?

Shion:
Oh, what's this all about? Are you thinking of running away and leaving the village or something?

Satoshi:
No, not anymore. But I think it still hasn't forgiven me.

Shion:
Huh?

Satoshi:
It looks like my aunt just got back. Sorry, but I gotta go.

Shion:
Oh, sure.
Satoshi:
I'm leaving Satoko up to you, Mion, okay?

Shion:
Satoshi? Satoshi...


Mion:
They went all out again this year.

Rena:
It's gonna be really fun, really fun.

Rika:
Mi?

Satoko:
Uh!? What's with you, Rika?

Rika:
You don't have anything to worry about today, okay? Only thing you have to do is smile, and have a whole lot of fun.

Satoko:
Yeah, unfortunately I'm not in a mood for that right now. You should probably just leave me alone.

Rika:
Oh, what if by the end of the day the thing that makes you the most miserable was erased from your life, would that make you happy?

Satoko:
That's not gonna happen, so now you're just teasing me.

Rika:
But Satoko. It's been decided it's gonna happen.

Satoko:
Huh?


Satoshi's Aunt:
So, this is what Satoshi was talking about. Well, it's not bad. It does seem usable. I bet if I cleaned it up, I could sell it. Ha!?

Man:
What's the matter, Makino? You keep on panting like that and you're gonna burst a lung or something... What!?
Ms. Oryou! I'm sure you understand how troubling this is, but I don't know what to do.

Oryou:
It's not troubling and there's nothing to do. What happened three times will most likely happen at four.

Police:
This is aweful. Her face is completely smashed in.

Oishi:
How's it going? Did you find any form of ID at all?

Police:
But looking at how she is dressed, we should be able to identify her just by asking around.

Oishi:
The chief warned me before I left, they may wanna keep this investigation completely classified, so make sure you choose your questions carefully.

Police:
Yes, sir.

Shion:
Satoshi's aunt? Well, what's going on? Did the police at least have a suspect or something?

Mion:
I don't know. But Oishi is definitely sticking his nose into everything. Seems like he is convinced whoever did it must've been a local.

Shion:
Do you know what Satoshi was doing on the day of the festival?

Mion:
Huh? Ah... I don't know.

Shion:
Hello, there.

Satoshi:
Hey, Mion.

Shion:
What were you looking at? Nice! This for Satoko's birthday?

Satoshi:
I'm worried that it might get sold before I get my last paycheck. So I check on it everyday.

Shion:
You've got be kidding.

Satoshi:
Huh?

Shion:
Excuse me, I'd like to ask you a question about the giant stuffed animal you've got in the display case. Can I put a hold on it?

Man:
Yes, sure. But it's pretty pricy. Can you afford it?

Satoshi:
Uh, yeah, almost. I should at least have enough for deposit.
If I knew it was gonna be that easy, I would put a hold on it a long time ago.

Shion:
When people see thing they really want, they put a hold on it right away. The fact that it didn't even occur to you speaks volumes about you, Satoshi.

Satoshi:
I guess. Thanks, that was nice of you.
Aaah...

Oishi:
Well, hello, there. Mr, Hojo, what a coincidence. You're just the person I was looking for.

Shion:
You got a warrant? If not, we are free to go. Come on! This has absolutely nothing to do with us.

Oishi:
Come on.

Shion:
All you wanna know is whether he has a alibi or not, right? Fine, then I can fill you in on that.

Oishi:
Oh, you can't, can you? Well, go ahead, fill us in.

Shion:
I'd be more than happy, too. Satoshi and I spent all of yesterday chatting at a little restaurant in Okinomiya called angel mort.

Oishi:
Ah, Hahahahaha! Nice try but we have a bunch of witnesses who saw you at the cotton drifting festival yesterday. It's kinda difficult for you to be in two places at once. Isn't that right, Mion?

Shion:
It's not difficult at all, seeing how my name isn't Mion. And I never even went to the cotton drifting festival yesterday.

Oishi:
What are you talking about, kid? If your name isn't Mion, what is it?

Shion:
It's Shion Sonozaki. Mion's my identical twin sister. I don't believe we've been properly introduced. Good afternoon, detective.

Oishi:
You know, I really don't think it's wise for you to try to pull over a fast one on the adults.

Shion:
Well, if you don't believe me, then feel free to check the family registry... or do I need to go to the trouble of calling my sister to have her come stand next to me?

Shion:
All right, listen! No matter how hard they grill you, you have to hold your ground and tell them you were with me all day. Satoshi, did you hear me? If you don't do this, you'll be playing right into their hands. You mad at me?

Satoshi:
What for?

Shion:
Well, cause I've been lying.

Satoshi:
Ahahahaha! I thought the conversations I was having with Mion in a class room were little weird sometimes. But now all make sense.

Shion:
You are not mad what I was hiding this from you? Really? I didn't wanna lie.

Satoshi:
We've met on the street, huh? This isn't the first time?

Shion:
No, it's not. You're right.

Satoshi:
Well, then, Shion, You've got a nice name.

Oishi:
All right, we'd like to ask you two to come down to the station.

Shion:
Damn it! I can't believe they are gonna question us individually.

Man:
Hello, Shion. It's been a long time.

Shion:
Where's Kasai? It became obvious that the police had contacted my family. I knew this would be bad. But in the million years, I never would have guessed what my fate would be. In fact even in my worst nightmares, I would never have come close to what was in store.

Mion:
The head of our family's furious.

Shion:
But, sis... So, is this the underground shrine?

Oryou:
You idiot! I was wondering what sort of disgrace you bring with you, but I had no idea it would be with a traitorous boy from the Hojo family.

Shion:
That's not fair. You can't judge him like that. Satoshi's parents made mistake, not him.

Oryou:
That's enough from you! Every member of the Hojo family has the same traitorous blood running through their veins.

Shion:
You are wrong. You are nothing but a bitter old hag!

Oryou:
WHAT!? You had better watch your mouth!

Shion:
I'm through being quiet! In fact you don't know the first thing about Satoshi! So how dare you treat him like he's some sort of insect! Are you angry just because some one from the Sonozaki family was with some one from the Hojo family? That's absurd! What century do you think you are living in? Can't you see how ridiculous this all is?

Oryou:
Are you even aware of some of that foolish mistakes that boy has made?

Shion:
So, that's it. Mion's told you everything, hasn't she? I'm beginning to realize she doesn't like the fact that I'm in love with Satoshi. The old hag is suspicious. She realized that Satoshi may have been the one to kill his aunt. So what, it doesn't matter.

Ahahahaha, to tell you the truth, the fact that I'm from the Sonozaki family and that he is from the Hojo family means absolutely nothing to me. I have zero interest in upholding the Sonozaki name... in public or anywhere else, Yep, I freely admit that I am in love with Satoshi Hojo and I don't care. How can being love be bad? Why would anyone stop that? You can't choose who you fall in love with. It's just something that happens.

Mion:
That's enough, Shion. I understand how important this is to you. But you've gone too far and there's no way anyone can cover for you now. There's no choice, you must distinguish yourself.

Shion:
But why? What have I done this so wrong?

Mion:
This is Hinamizawa. And we are the Sonozaki family. And as part of the three great families we lead Hinamizawa. And no matter how much you hate it, you are still the twin's sister of Mion Sonozaki next in line to take over the family. Accept it!

Shion:
You know, sis, unfortunatelly this is the one thing we haven't seemed to agreed on since I've come back. Hinamizawa, the Sonozaki family, I don't care! All these things you talk about mean nothing to me.

Mion:
Listen! When you decided to move to Okinomiya who were the people there who came to help you out. Kasai and uncle Yoshiro, both are in that room there.

Shion:
Why is Kasai here?

Mion:
Shion, apologize to grandma. Just distinguish yourself and this discussion is over.

Shion:
But, Mion, come on! What did I say that was actually that bad? I mean all I did was tell you how I feel.

Mion:
We've already brought in Kasai and our uncle, you really don't want us to bring Satoshi and all of this, too, do you?

Shion:
No! Come on, sis! Wait!

Mion:
You have something to say, Shion?

Shion:
Please, please you have to forgive me. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, master.

Mion:
So tell me, Shion. How are you going to mark this lapse in judgement for us?

Shion:
What is this thing?

Mion:
It's a divece for tearing off finger nails. Are you familiar with how it works?

Shion:
No! Why would I be?

Mion:
Each nail you tear off will distinguish your penance for all the misdeed you have perpetrated. Shion Sonozaki, to restore your standing in this family, please remove three of your finger nails.

Shion:
You want three of them? One for Kasai, one for my uncle, and one for Satoshi. Fine! If I do this, you promise you forgive everyone else. You have to promise. You have to promise that if I tear off my finger nails, everyone else will be forgiven. Please sis!

Mion:
If you do this, it would simply clear your name is our family, no one else is. If you were not up to it, that's another matter.

Shion:
No! Wait, sis! Don't leave... I'll do it.

Mion, I hope you forgive me now. I don't know if you realize how painful this is. This unbearable.

Mion:
So then, are you giving up?

Shion:
No! I can do it! It's really not that bad. I can handle it! Just two more. It's no big deal.

Oryou:
Oh, looks like it missed.

Shion:
Do I do this again?

Mion:
Shion, come on! You gotta pull it together. You almost done. Just hang in there!

Shion:
I can't do this anymore! Don't make me! Come on, sis. Help me!
No! Stop! Please! Don't do this!

Kasai and uncle Yoshiro were safe. And after with all done, I was forgiven. The last message I received from the Sonozaki family was very direct. It said "forget about Satoshi Hojo". But I still needed to support myself, so I went to town which I hadn't done for quite sometime. Conguratulation, Satoshi, you've finally got it!


 Irie:
Hey, Mion! Doing a little window shopping?

Shion:
Sorry, coach. But I'm afraid my name isn't Mion. I'm her twin's sister and my name is Shion. I'm sorry for not telling you this earlier.

Irie:
Huh?

Oishi:
Ahahahaha! It's pretty surprising, isn't it, Dr. Irie?

Irie:
Detective Oishi?

Oishi:
How are you doing, Shion? Hope that injury of yours is healing up.

Shion:
Huh?

Oishi:
Just keep it from getting infected and I'm sure it'll heal fine.

Shion:
He knows...

Oishi:
By the way...


 Shion:
What do you want? If it's regarding our alibis, I've already gone over it with you.

Oishi:
Actually I didn't bring you here to talk about what you and Satoshi were doing on the day the incident. I wanna know about yesterday.

Shion:
Yesterday? Why yesterday?

Oishi:
Because Satoshi disappeared yesterday. He left his home and never came back.

Shion:
What!?

Oishi:
Wow, It looks like you didn't know.

Shion:
What do you mean he disappeared? That can't be! What are you talking about? No, no, Nooooooooo!!!!!
Oishi began to tell me his theory... that Satoshi had been the one who killed his aunt, and that he probably wasn't able to buy the stuffed animal after all. He went on to say, he still think Satoshi might be out there somewhere, but it was too much. I couldn't process any of it.

 Shion:
Huh? What did you say?

Kasai:
Seems the police have someone in custody they think is responsible for killing their aunt.

Shion:
Then it wasn't Satoshi.

Kasai:
It was apparently some psychopath copycatting the previous murders. I thought you'd wanna know.

Shion:
A psychopath? Do you know what this means?
Satoshi had nothing to do with his aunt being murdered. People commonly refer to the series of bizarre deaths that have transpired in Hinamizawa as Oyashiro's curse. And since the actual culprit turned out to be someone other than Satoshi, it seems he himself played completely different role and keeping this awful curse alive for yet another year.

Satoshi:
It still hasn't forgiven me yet.

Shion:
It still hurts.
