  Keiichi:
Well, you could say that, yeah...
I think that...someone's trying to kill me...
She told me that if I keep acting like him, I'm gonna end up like him.

Oishi:
End up how?

Keiichi:
She said I'd be transferred.

Oishi:
Transferred?


Keiichi:
I'm sorry, but can you hold on a minute?

Oishi:
Yeah, sure. No problem.

Keiichi:
Ugh!

Rena:
How are you doing?

Keiichi:
Hey, Rena. What made you come here tonight?

Rena:
Hey, Keiichi. Have you eaten yet?

Keiichi:
No.

Rena:
Perfect!
'Cause I made a few dishes for you, if you let me in, I'd be happy to warm them up again.
It's no problem. I...

Keiichi:
Uh, that's really nice, but it looks like the meal my mom cooked is almost ready.

Rena:
Really?

Keiichi:
Yeah, and my mom always cooks a ton of foods, so we really don't need anymore.
Thanks though.

Rena:
Are you telling the truth?
Did your mom really make dinner?

Keiichi:
Well, actually, she didn't really make it for me.

Rena:
You're mean.
What have I done to make you lie to me... to me?

Keiichi:
It's the truth...

Rena:
No, it's not. The only thing you planed on eating tonight was a cup of noodles, right?
Ginger and garlic pork flavor which you bought today at seventh market.

Keiichi:
How did you...

Rena:
But that's not enough food for you. You should eat some vegetables with that too.
So if you would just let me in please, Keiichi.

Keiichi:
Just go home.

Rena:
C' mon, Keiichi. Open the door.

Keiichi:
Just please go! Don't do this!

Rena:
Keiichi...

Keiichi:
Go home! GO HOME!!!

Rena:
Aargh! Oh, Keiichi...[Pardon/xxxx] me.
Stop! I'm sorry I scare you. I was so saying. I'm sorry...I'm really sorry...

Keiihi:
Go home! Just go home! Get outta here! Go home!

Rena:
I'm sorry, Keiichi.
I really am...

Keiichi:
Sorry, Detecitve. I didn't mean to take so long.
But Reana was just at the door.

Oishi:
Did she come by for a visit?

Keiichi:
No.
Oishi, can you tell me what you know about Rena?

Oishi:
Sure. But don't go tell this anyone else.
I had to connect some of these dots on my own.
So I can't guarantee that all of it is a hundred percent accurate, OK?

Keiichi:
I understand.

Oishi:
Here is what I know .
They struck me as suspicious a while ago.

Keiichi:
Are you saying Rena and them are suspects?

Oishi:
No, not exactly.
I was talking more specifically about Oyashiro.
I was wondering if that curse might really be true.
So I started doing a little research.
Remember that story I told you little while back about Rena?

Keiichi:
Uh, You mean how she went around her old school in Ibaraki and smashed out all the windows?

Oishi:
There are actually a few victims that day.
I found out three boys she was friends with also got struck with a baseball bat.

Keiichi:
A baseball bat?

Oishi:
But neither the school nor the victims ever prosecuted.
So the case never made it to court.
The oddest thing is everyone who is involved in this incident refuses to talk about it.
One of the victims who's hurt so badly then he lost one of his eyes.
But even that was not enough to get this guy to talk.
Nothing I said can convince him to come forward.

Are you still there?
Maebara, can you hear me?

Keiichi:
What is she saying!?

Oishi:
Huh, what are you talking about, Maebara?

Keiichi:
I'm sorry...

Oishi:
Huh? Sorry for what?

Keiichi:
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

Oishi:
Maebara, are you there? Hello?


Mion:
Keiichi, good morning. You know I never knew that you're so into baseball.

Keiichi:
Leave me alone. I can't concentrate.

Mion:
Put that down.It's bugging me.

Keiichi:
How come?

Mion:
Just stop swinging that thing.

Keiichi:
I did stop.

Mion:
That's enough. I don't want you doing that anymore, okay?

Keiichi:
Why not? I mean it's not like I'm bothering anybody.

Mion:
But you are.

Keiichi:
What are you talking about? Just who am I bothering?

Mion:
First off that's not even your bat.

Keiichi:
So someone left it behind when he transferred. You know it doesn't make any sense.
Why would his little sister stay here while he transferred out?

Mion:
How did you know that?

Keiichi:
Satoshi Houjou...Satoko's brother, right?
He was spirited away by the demon, wasn't he?
From what I heard Satoshi took the swinging a bat as well...right about the time he went missing.
What. Do you think this is the sign that I too would have been cursed by Oyashiro?

Mion:
Will you shut up? Listen, this scares everyone. If you're doing this just 'cause you think it's funny,
then stop pretending to be Satoshi!

Keiichi:
No! You listen! I don't know anything about Satoshi. 'Cause no one will tell me the truth about it.


Mion:
We weren't being like that to upset you.

Keiichi:
Because you thought the truth might scare me? So you thought was just better to keep me in the dark on this?

Mion:
No! That wasn't our intention.

Keiichi:
Remember when I asked you if something had happened at the construction site?
And you said "No!" Even though someone was chopped into little bits there!
You [tried] to lie to me!

Mion:
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

Keiichi:
If someon lies to you, they aren't really your friends, are they, are they?
Seems pretty clear that you guys aren't my friends.

Mion:
But Keiichi, that's not true.

Keiichi:
Oh, yeah, how about the dessert you guys sent? That was really nice of you all.
Yeah, I like foods that makes me bleed. So tell me...who did it? You? Or Rena?
You thought you could easily get rid of me, but you guys were wrong.
I don't know anything about Satoshi, but you're not running me off like you did him.
That's right. I know all about you and your dealing with the foreman at that construction site. And I know about the fights you get into.
You thought you could hide that from me, didn't you?

Mion:
How do you even know that?

Keiichi:
Let's go. Being late for class is for losers.

Mion:
Why are you so mean, Keiichi?
I get it now. I know who told you everything. It was him, wasn't it?

Keiichi:
Eh?

Mion:
I should had killed him when I had the chance.
Seems he has forgotten the only reason I let him go was because he's retiring this year. Stupid bustard! Your time is up, old man.
I'm definitely gonna kill you now.

Keiichi;
Who are you talking about? Detective Oishi?


Keiichi:
Crap! What'll she do with her hatchet?

Rena:
Hello there Keiichi. Found ya.

Keiichi:
What are you doing here?

Rena:
We walk home [the] same way, remember?

Keiichi:
Yeah, but what the heck is that hatchet for?
What's it for?

Rena:
Ahahaha!
Tell me has something been eating up you lately?
Something that maybe scares you?

Keiichi:
I'm not scared.

Rena:
When Satoshi transfered, I was really upset.
Something was clearely bothering him, but I'd never asked him what it was, and I really regret that now.

Keiichi:
Transfer, right. You mean spirited away by the demon, don't you?
Tell me who got rid of Satoshi, damn it!
Was it you? Or was it Mion?
Or was it someone else from the village? Tell me!

Rena:
I'm afraid I don't know what you are talking about.

Keiichi:
Then let me put it a little more clearly.
Someone likes to kill for fun around here. Who is it?

Rena:
You don't have your fact straight.
You see the murderer isn't a human. You see Oyashiro is the one who controls these things.

Keiichi:
The curse is just a surperstition. It's stuipid.

Rena:
So Keiichi doesn't beleive in Oyashiro.

Keiichi:
No! How could I? The curse is ridiculous!

Rena:
Trust me. He is quite real. Tell me have you ever heard someone apologize to you, over and over, none stop...
Oyashiro visited me personally. In fact that's the very reason I transfered back to Hinamizawa. I'm the only one who can help you, Keiichi.
And there's no way I'm gonna let you transfer, so are we clear?

Keiichi:
What?

Rena:
You're gonna have to trust me. Do that and I can save you.
Trust is important.
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Keiichi:
What the hell is going on!? What the hell do you guys want from me?
If I have to crack this thing and crush your head, I'll do it. I'm serious.


Rena:
I think you need to lie back down, Keiichi.

Keiichi:
Huh, Rena!?

Rena:
I called the doctor and he should be here any second now.

Keiichi:
What are you doing here?

Mion:
Anyone home?

Keiichi:
Mion? What the?

Rena:
While your families are out of town, I have no one to call.So I called her.

Mion:
Look at you. You look fine.
I'll never gonna worry about you again.
So did you call the coach, Rena?

Rena.
Hmm. Right after I called you.
He said that he would be here right away.

Keiichi:
Who is this guy? What are you talking about?

Mion:
You don't know who the coach is?
When I say the coach, I mean the coach.
You've really been gettin' into baseball lately. Am I right?
Well, I gurantee you when the coach hears that he's gonna be totally stout.

Keiichi:
Come on! Tell me!
Just who is this coach guy anyway.

Rena:
When we say the coach, we mean the coach.

Keiichi:
Tell me who this guy is. Damn it!
Stop that!!

Mion:
Oh! Yeah!
What do you say we finish the punishment game before the coach gets here.

Keiichi:
Punishment game.

Rena:
Remember the dessert we made you?
Don't tell me you forgot about it already.

Keiichi:
What are you doing?

Mion:
There is no squirming in the punishment game.

Keiichi:
What is that?
What are you gonna do to me?

Mion:
Come on. You already know, right?

Keiichi:
No, I don't.
I don't know anything.
I promise.

Oishi:
We figured if he might have been on drugs, so we ran a bunch of tests, but everything came back negative.
---
Mion:
Don't fight it, Keiichi.

Keiichi:
Stop. Stop.

Keiichi:
That must be them.

Keiichi:
Rena and Mion are involved in the murders. 
There's also four or five more adults involved. And one of them owns a white van.
Tomitake's death was result of some bizarre drug.
The trace of it should be found in this syringe.

For what? What was all of this for?

Man A:
He's going out of the back!

Man B:
Sure, hold on for a second.
Hey, Detective Oishi! You gotta call here from the outside line.

Oishi:
Wonder who that could be?

Man B:
They are calling from a public phone.

Oishi:
Detectitve Oishi, go ahead.

Keiichi:
Oishi?
Can you hear me?

Oishi:
That's you, Maebara?
Did something happen to you, kid?

Keiichi:
Well...

Oishi:
Just tell me what's going on.

Keiichi:
I don't know. It, it seems that... I...that I...

Oishi:
All right, calm down.
I've got an officer in the area, and sending him there now.
As soon as I get off the phone I'll head there myself.

Keiichi:
It's not gonna matter.
I'm sure when you get here, It'll be too late.

Oishi:
Try to stay calm, son!
Tell me what's happening right now.

Huh? I need someone there faster than that.
How many people we have patrolling [the/that] area.

Man B:
Two.

Oishi:
Did you call the local officer in the Hinamizawa?

Man B:
He's out on the regular patrol.
He didn't respond.

Oishi:
Kuma! Get me a car, right now!

Kumagai:
You got it, sir!

Oishi:
Maebara, are you still there?
There's an officer headed your way as we speak.
He's gonna be there just in a couple of minutes.
C'mon son, talk to me. 
Tell me who did this to you and how many of them there are?

Keiichi:
At first I thought the murderer was just a normal person.
But that's not it. I was totally wrong.
It exists. Oyashiro really exists.

Oishi:
You're kidding me!

Keiichi:
He is there. And keeps following me....
No matter how much I run from him, he's still there, looming over me...
like,.. like some kind of shadow,
and little by little, he keeps on creeping closer and closer until he is almost touching me.

Oishi:
Where is he now? Is he close to you?
Is anywhere near you at all?
Can you see him?

Keiichi:
He is here. He's right behind me.

Oishi:
Who's there?

Keiichi:
I won't do it. I won't turn around.
If I turn around [xxxx]

Oishi:
I know that you are scared, son!
But you have to do this!
You have to turn around and tell me who's there.
Tell me, who it is! Maebara!
Who's doing this to you!

What's happening?
What was that?

Something's making you take the throat?
You gotta fighting! Maebara!
Are you there? Answer me!

Keiichi:
For...give...me...

Kumagai:
Your car is ready for you, sir. You Ok?

Oishi:
Forgive him for what, though?

Oishi:
The double homicide [at/of] the two school girls transpired in the Hinamizawa region of Shishibone city. The suspect is Keiichi Maebara. After calling classmates Rena Ryuugu and Mion Sonozaki to his house, Maebara beat them to death with a bat. After fleeing the scene, the suspect was found collapsed in a phone booth. The suspect was spotted by a local patrol officer. He died twenty four hours later in a nearby hospital. The autopsy revealed the cause of death was due to lack of blood. By slitting his own throat with his own finger nails, the suspect consequently bled to death.There were no narcotics found in his body. A search of the suspect's bed room turned over a note that appears to have been written by the suspect. The note was taped to the back of a clock hanging on the wall of the suspect's bedroom. The note appears to be torn from a college-ruled spiral notebook. It appears that the note was originally written on one sheet of paper. Although when they were found, the middle section had been torn out. Possibly removing a part of the note that someone didn't want it read. In addition from a large amount of tape left on the clock, it can be assumed that something else besides the memo was also taped there. Here's the content of the memo as we found it.
My name is Keiichi Maebara. I'm in danger of being killed. I don't really know why, and I don't even know who will do it. The only thing I do know is that that has something to do with the curse of Oyashiro. Rena and Mion are involved in the murders. There's also four or five more adults involved and one of them owns a white van. Here's the second half.
I still don't quite understand...just how things got to this point.If you're reading this, then chances are...I'm probably dead. Whoever finds this note, please uncover the truth. That's all I ask. Keiichi Maebara.


I want you to stare at me...the real me.
I want you to forgive yourself...for your whimsical side.
I want you to try...and understand the other me.
