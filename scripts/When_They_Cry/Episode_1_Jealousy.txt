  Keiichi:
I'm late. Wait a second. Today is Sunday, isn't it?

Mom:
Keiichi, Rena's on the phone!

Rena:
Keiichi, you're late!

Keiichi:
I know. What's up? Where're Satoko and Rika?

Mion:
They live closer to the town center so it'll be easier we just meet them there. [発音変化 center /sénṭɚ/→ /nénɚ/]

Keiichi:
 OK. Well, what about the club meeting?
 Why do we have to have it in town?

Mion:
 It'll all make sense when we get there.

Rena:
 Hold on, Mion! Wait for me!

Keiichi:
 Wow! Look at 'em all. Why're there so many kids at the toy store? What's the deal?
 Is there some kind of major event going on here today or something?

Mion:
 Yep, there sure is! And the grand prize's gonna be 50,000 yen!

Keiichi:
 50,000!?

Satoko:
 Hey! Hello, everybody. We're waiting for you over here.

Rika:
 Morning, glad you can make it, you guys.

Mion:
Well, c'mon! Let's go get 'em!


Keiichi:
 So, I'm guessing this is our club meeting's gonna be today.

Mion:
 You got it. It just so happens the store owner is a friend of mine.
 So I've convinced him to let us hold game tournaments here every now and then as a way to try to attract some new customers.

Rena:
 So, In a way today's club meeting is really part.

Mion:
 And if you win today, you get to make the losers do anything you want them to.

Keiichi:
 Just bring it on.

Owner:
At a long walk even a dog gets tired. [発音変化 at a /ət ə/ → /ənə/]

Rena:
 Ohhh...He's so cute. I wanna take him home.

Owner:
Ronald as in President Ronald Regan.

Satoko:
 You all are too slow.

Tomita:
How did she do that!?

Keiichi:
 Satoko's gone into the full-on trap mode.

Owner:
It's best to praise your children over and over again.

Tomita:
I got it!

Mion:
 Got it!

Owner:
Sweet rice balls, not flowers, are the dieter's enemy.

Rika:
Hi...
 Look. I got it. I got it, guys.

Okamura:
'Cause you're so good, Rika.

Keiichi:
 Man, I ain't got a chance. Now what?

Mion:
 I'm so disappointed. Everybody else is trying their best to win here and you're just staying there doing nothing!

Keiichi:
 What do you mean I'm not trying?

Mion:
 You're not. If you were really putting everything you have into this game, Keiichi, even you'd at least have one card by now.

Rena:
That, you mean Keiichi's gonna be the loser again.

Satoko:
 Does that surprise anyone?

Keiichi:
 We're taking a bathroom break.

Owner:
No worry.

Keiichi:
 Tomita. Okamura.
 Help me out here.
 You need to let me win.

Tomita:
If we don't, are you gonna beat us or something?

Keiichi:
 No, (you) just listen to my plan.
 Alright, Tomita. I'm gathering you think Satoko is kinda cute.
 Don't lie to me.
 And Okamura, you got the hots for Rika, don't you?
 Stop blushing.
 If you guys help me win, I promise I'll totally set you up with them.

Tomita:
It's a deal.
You are so gonna win.

Okamura:
That's right.
No matter what it takes, you're winning.

Keiichi:
 Then, let's do it.

Owner:
Cry too much and you'll get attacked by [a] bee.

Mion:
 Mine.

Keiichi:
 Got it.

Owner:
Good medicine can hurt your wallet.

Rika:
 Mine.

Keiichi:
 Got it.

Tomita:
Sorry, my bad.

Keiichi:
 Got it...

Mion:
 Way to go there, Keiichi?
 I'm actually kinda impressed.

Keiichi:
 It's just what happens, when I decide to get serious.

Mion:
 Wow, I guess you're gonna be a worthy opponent after all.
 Take a look, Keiichi?
 It seems that as of right now you and I are both tied for the lead.

Keiichi:
What? Hey, come on, man.
 Read the last card already, will you?

Owner:
All right.

Mion:
 Time out!
 This game's officially over.
 I decided to officially postpone the rest of today's tournament.


Keiichi:
 Oh, come on.
 Get back here, Mion.
 You can't just walk away.

Mion:
 Sorry, Keiichi.
 But I'm afraid I have to go to work now.

Keiichi:
 Go to work?
 What the hell are you talking about?

Owner:
Don't worry, kid.
We'll just put the grand prize money on hold for the next tournament.
Here's a consolation prize.

Rena:
 Oh, I wonder what that could be.

Keiichi:
 Huh? What the heck is this?

Satoko:
 That's a cute prize you got there, Keiichi?

Rena:
 Oh, I want it, I want it.
 Can I take it home, please?

Mion:
 Excellent gift.
 That thing is so not you.

Keiichi:
 Whatever.
 Here, it's yours.

Rena:
 Are you serious? All for me?

Keiichi:
 Yep, all for you.
 You like the cute stuff, don't you?

Rena:
 Thank you so much.

Keiichi:
 I don't see any point in me keeping that thing.
 And besides, it doesn't seem like your thing either.

Mion:
 Yeah, so not my thing.
 You know, sometimes I wonder if I wouldn't have been better off just being born a guy instead of a stupid girl.

Keiichi:
 Well, it's good you know that about yourself.

Mion:
 All right, I'm outta here.
 See you tomorrow.

Keiichi:
 I guess that I'm kinda hungry.
 You guys wanna go get something to eat?

Rena:
 Sorry, I can't.
 I have to go home and make dinner tonight.

Rika:
 We can't do it either, Keiichi.
 We've got to do some shopping before we go home.

Satoko:
 If we could, we would so.

Keiichi:
 No biggie. I'll see you guys tomorrow, OK?


Keiichi:
 Perfect. This place is kinda nice.

Mion:
 Ah. Welcome.

Keiichi:
 Is she new?
 Man, that's what I call it good uniform.
 Eh? Mion? Is that you?
 Don't tell me this is the job you were talking about?

Mion:
 Not really...

Keiichi:
 Wait a second. I'm the customer here.
 She's got to do whatever I ask her to.
 You know, I've gotta say.
 I'm surprised you actually look pretty good on that outfit.

Mion:
 Oh. Please don't stare. It's really so embarrassing.

Keiichi:
 You can pretend to be embarrassed all you want.
 But the truth is, you are actually enjoying all the attention you get dressed up like that, aren't you?

Mion:
 No, really I'm not.
 The only reason I wear this outfit is because...

Keiichi:
 I bet your mom wouldn't be too happy if she saw you dressed like that.

Mion:
 That's not funny.

Keiichi:
I like I'll make you think your thing what you got but then you really don't.


Mion:
 No.

Keiichi:
 As one of your customers, you can do a much better job and trying to meet my needs.

Mion:
 Please stop with this act.

Keiichi:
 I wanna take you home.

Mion:
 I asked you to please stop.

Keiichi:
 I'll let you off the hook for today.
 Hey. Who would've thought that the mighty Mion Sonozaki is a really bad waitress?


Mion:
 Actually, you're mistaken.

Keiichi:
 What are you talking about?

Mion:
 Well, you see, you're not talking to Mion.

Keiichi:
 Huh?

Shion:
 I'm... I'm actually Shion Sonozaki.
 I happen to be Mion's younger twin sister.

Keiichi:
 You're Mion's twin?

Shion:
 It's true.
 I'm afraid that I get mistaken from my sister a lot.

Keiichi:
 Well then, explain to me why when we just met you acted like we knew each other.

Shion:
 That's because my sister seems to always be talking about you.
 So, when I saw you...

Keiichi:
 Well then, I should apologize. I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

Shion
 No, it's OK. Don't worry. I totally understand.
 My sister has a whole lot of enemies, you know?

Waitress:
Sonozaki, you can go on a break now if you want.

Shion:
 Oh, OK. Well, I'm going to take a break now.
 But it was nice to meet you finally.
 I heard a lot about you.
 She talks about you a lot.
 But it is good though, I promise.

Keiichi:
 Mion sure was trying her best to fool me.
 I can't believe she thought I'd fall for that twin sister a bit.


Mion:
 Huh? Your parents have gone and left you all alone today, Keiichi?

Keiichi:
 Yeah. Can you believe they left a growing boy like me all by himself?
 They can be so evil sometimes.

Mion:
 All right. Quit complaining.
 Well. See you guys tomorrow.

Rena:
 Are you going to work again?

Mion:
 Yep. They keep warning me to come in early so I can get used to that long hours.

Keiichi:
 I bet being a waitress can be really tough sometimes.

Rena:
 Huh? I didn't know that you were a waitress, Mion.

Mion:
 I'm not a waitress.
 I work at a toy store my uncle owns it and asks me to help him out sometimes.
 I got nothing to do with food service.
 That's Shion's thing.

Keiichi:
 Oh, right. Sorry, I don't know what I was thinking.

Rena:
 I don't get it. Who's Shion?

Keiichi:
 Oh, don't you know?
 That's Mion's twin sister.
 But the only thing similar about them is the way they look.

Mion:
 It's true.
 We're maybe identical twins, but everything else about us is completely different.
 I'm the sweet caring one who looks out for everyone's feelings.
 But Shion's the mean nasty one.

Rena:
 Wow, I never knew that you had a younger sister much as a twin.
 How come I never see her when I go to your house?

Mion:
 You see. That's because I'm the only one who lives with grandma.
 Shion lives although at Okinomiya house.
 So, we don't get to see each other that much. 
And I guess that's a consequence we are really not all that close.

Rena:
 I'd like to meet her some day.
 Hey. Which restaurant does she work at?

Mion:
 Huh? Let's see. It's a...
 Hey, I gatta get going.
 I'm gonna be late for work.
 All right, you guys. Have fun. See you tomorrow...

Keiichi:
 Oh,look at the girl.

Rena:
 She's strange... but in a good way.
 You know a kinda cute way.
 I don't know why though, I don't know why.


Keiichi:
 Oh, I'm starving.
 Yeah, it's open.

Shion:
 Hello, Keiichi.
 What are you doing?
 How come are you lying on the floor?

Keiichi:
 Hey, there.
 Mi..., I mean Shi...
 Oh, just forget it.
 I can't keep up with it.
 So, what do you want?

Shion:
 Here. For you.

Keiichi:
 Huh? Wow. What's all this about?

Shion:
 Well. Mion called me earlier.
 She said you were starving and if I had time it would be nice that I could swing by and drop something off for you.

Keiichi:
 Yeah, that is nice. But why?

Shion:
 Because, because, well, because you are such a good customer.

Keiichi:
 I am?

Shion:
 All right. Well. I'd better go.
 I don't wanna be late for work.

Keiichi:
 Wow, it looks great.
 Man, I hope she didn't poison into anything.
 Who cares? It doesn't matter.
 It's too good to pass up.
 It's so good.


Rena:
 Hey, I've got an idea.
 How about before we play we figure out what today's punishment game's gonna be.

Mion:
Now [that/bad] girl's got a right idea.
 Today's punishment game is gonna be a duty.

Rika:
 I'm sorry, everybody.
 I can't play today.
 There're something else that I have to do instead.

Mion:
 Did something happen?

Rena:
 Oh, I forgot. You need to go practice for the "Cotton Drifting".

Satoko:
 It's almost here. The festival's gonna be this Sunday.
 And Rika has been practicing very hard for it.

Mion:
 All right.
 I guess we'll have to cancel today's club meeting then.

Rika:
 I'm so sorry about that, everybody.
 But I really wanna do good at the festival.

Rena:
We'll all be cheering for you, Rika.

Keiichi:
 So, is it some kind of competition that Rika's practicing for?

Mion:
 She has to practice because she is the shrine maiden for the "Cotton Drifting Festival".

Keiichi:
 Cotton Drifting?

Mion:
 It's all over the local paper.
 Don't you ever read anything.
 Next Sunday is the "Cotton Drifting Festival".
 It's a major event.

Keiichi:
 Wait. Now that you mention it, I think maybe my mom did say something to me about it.

Mion:
 Man, pay attention, will you?

Rena:
 Rika's going to perform the dance of "Hounou" which is the main ceremony for the "Cotton Drifting Festival".
 It's a really big deal.

Mion:
 That's right.
 She's gonna have to do the entire dance holding this really heavy hoe the whole time.
 So, in order to prepare for it, she'd be practicing using the kind of giant mallet that is used for pounding mochi rice.

Keiichi:
 Really. Rika must be begining pretty strong from all this practice then.
 Proves that you can't judge a person by what they look like.

Rena:
 I think you should judge them by the opposite of what they look like.

Keiichi:
 Sometimes I think you might be right.

Mion:
 Oh, that's right.
 I forgot I've gotta go to work today.
 Well, see you guys later.

Rena:
 Oh, OK. See you later.

Keiichi:
 If you judge a person by the opposite of what they are, would that mean Mion's actually really sweet'n nice then?

Rena:
 Mion really is sweet and nice.
 I mean ya she likes to be in charge of things all the time.
 But deep down, she's really really cute.

Keiichi:
 So, you think that she is cute, huh?
 I guess you might have a point there.


Keiichi:
 Did I remember to wash it?
 Yeah, good enough.

Keiichi:
 Oh, man.

Man A:
Do you know what you've just done?
Yo, I'm talking to you, you a little snot?

Keiichi:
 I'm really sorry.
 I tripped. It was a total accident.

Man B:
Maybe you should watch where we are going next time.

Man C:
You scratch my paint, you little tard.

Man A:
So how are you gonna make this right, kid? Huh?

Shion:
 Take your hands off him right now.

Man A:
Oh, yeah, who the hell are you?

Shion:
 Take your hands off from him and get out of here.

Man A:
Is that what you want, bitch?

Keiichi:
 Mi, Mion?

Man A:
Where do they all come from?

Man B:
Hey, who are you guys?

Man C:
Hey, what's going on here, chief?

Man A:
How should I know?

Keiichi:
 Thanks for your help back there
 You totally stood up to them.

Shion:
 Well, it's not like I wasn't scared.
 But since you were in trouble, I just had to muster up the courage.

Shion:
 I mean how would it look if I just left you hanging there like that. Huh?

Keiichi:
 You know what really surprised me the most?
 It was all the town people that gathered around to help me out.
 Were they all from Hinamizawa?

Shion:
 Yes, all of them.
 You'd be surprised at how much the people in this town stick together.
 We say the one person's enemy is everyone's enemy.

Keiichi:
 That kinda makes it sound like a mafia family.

Shion:
 That's not very nice.
 I think it's a good thing.
 After today, you should be grateful for it as well.

Keiichi:
 I am grateful for both today.
 And the lunch you brought me yesterday.

Shion:
 The lunch I brought?
 I don't remember bringing..., ah?

Shion:
 I mean, never mind.
 How was it? Did you like it?

Keiichi:
 It was really good.

Shion:
 It's funny.
 It kind of feels like we are on a date right now, doesn't it?

Shion:
 You don't like that idea?
 You know what?
 It took me a while but I think finally I know why my sister likes you so much, Keiichi?
 If you don't mind, can I have a little crush on you too?

Keiichi:
 Ah, yeah,... wanna mean... you just said... what... I ya... what.
 Listen Shion, I mean, Mion.
 I agree you should never judge a person by how they look.
 I totally get it.
 I see that you have a girly side, too.
 And it's really sweet.
 So there is no need to lie to me about this twin sister that you made up.

Boy:
Bye, bye.

Mion:
 Yep, thanks. Come back again soon.

Keiichi:
 Ua, Mion!

Mion:
 Keiichi!

Keiichi:
 It's... It's true. You're twins.

Shion:
 That's what I've been trying to say.


Mion:
 Bathroom. Excuse me.

Rena:
 I'll go, too.

Satoko:
 That's the fifteenth time she's gone to the bathroom today.
 I don't know why, but Mion really is acting weirder than normal.

Rika:
 There are times in a girl's life when she can be a bit unpredictable.

Keiichi:
 Even though I know the whole story now, it's still hard to make sense of it.

Rena:
 Keiichi?

Rena:
 So, uh, I heard that you had kind of a hard time yesterday.

Keiichi:
 Yeah, I really believe that Shion didn't exist.
 I mean I knew that it was Mion bringing me that lunch.
 Not Shion, even though she was dressed like Shion.

Rena:
 Shh! Mion was really messed up over this whole thing.
 But I think it's OK now.
 I think I fixed her.

Keiichi:
 You think you fixed her.
 By doing what?

Rena:
 Just like they do it on TV.
 I came out at a 45 degree angle and then went like this.

Rena:
 There is more.
 If you don't mind, I have a favor I'd like to ask you.

Keiichi:
 Yeah, what is it?

Rena:
 Mion has decided it's best she just forgets everything that happened yesterday.
 So, I was wondering if maybe you could, too.

Keiichi:
 Sure.

Rena:
 But you've seen Mion's cute side now, haven't you?
 So in a way, maybe it was all kind of worth that after all.

Keiichi:
 Maybe, at least I know it's never gonna be a dull moment around her.
 Satoko? Rika?

Rika:
 Well, it seems to me you and Mion have learned all kinds of good lessons from this.
 I guess maybe you'll grow up to be good adults after all.

Keiichi:
 That's right.
 And because you study all the time, I'm sure you are gonna be a fine adult as well.

Rika:
 Oh, yeah, of course I will.
 When I grow up, I'm gonna be something amazing.
 Just wait and see.

Satoko:
 Yeah, well, when I grow up, I'm gonna be an elegant woman that everybody admires.

Keiichi:
 Satoko, when you grow up, you're gonna be just like you are now.

Satoko:
 What's that supposed to mean?

Keiichi:
 Wow. Satoko! That hurt!


What I want to see are the shapes in the dark.
 What I want to hear are footsteps as they hesitate.
 What I want to know is where I really belong.


 When They Cry,
 The "Cotton Drifting", Chapter 2: Takano.


 Can you believe in this?
