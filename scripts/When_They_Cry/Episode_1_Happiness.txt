  Rena:
I wonder... how hard does a person have to work to really be happy, I mean really happy, unhappiness I think causes something like a chain reaction.
And once it starts, it's impossible to get out of it.
In order to break the cycle, you have to do everything you can to stop it.
And in the end when you've given it your all, and you finally break that chain.
That's when you begin to understand for the first time... what happiness is.
But that's just my experience; and don't suppose everyone can relate to that.
After all, we're all different.

Keiichi:
Rena!

Rena:
All right, here it is!
Rena Ryugu's amazingly true adventure of a lifetime.



Keiichi:
You are going down, Mion!

Mion:
Ha! You call that a threat!

Classmate:
Awesome!
Now all you got to do is just take out Rika and Satoko!
Come on, Keiichi! You can do, we know you can!

Satoko:
Ahahahahahahahaha!
Uh-oh, looks like Rena's starting to get a bit tired.
Ahahahahaha!
You know, a real professional keeps track of the amount of ammo her opponent has left.
And I'm willing to bet you're down to your last shot and that you barely even have enough to make a dribble.

Rena:
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Another thing a real professional does is keep her weapon stash somewhere, so that it's ready and waiting in a time of need.

Keiichi:
Ha, Rena definetely is good.

Mion:
Well, I don't know.

Keiichi:
Huh?

Mion:
No one can set a trap like Satoko.
You just watch.

Satoko:
If you think I didn't foresee that move, you greatly underestimate me.

Rena:
What do you mean?

Satoko:
I saw this whole thing already.
I knew you wouldn't have time to reload, and that you knew that too and probably had a back-up plan.

You know, if you're looking for a good way to mess up a water gun without someone else knowing it, filling it with sand will really do the trick.

Keiichi:
Wow!

Mion:
I told you when it comes to setting traps, no one beats Satoko.

Satoko:
I always think this adds a nice splash, having one trap still waiting for your opponent really till the minute of the finish.
That makes me a professional, and you just an amateur.

Rena:
Pride does come before a fall, Satoko.

Satoko:
What are you talking about?

Rena:
The rules to getting shot, do you remember?
Someone is shot if they are hit by the water within a gun.
That was a rule.

Satoko:
So? What's that got to do with anything?

Ah! I sure didn't see that coming.

Rena:
Of course not.
You're not as good as I am.

Keiichi:
My turn!

Rena:
I knew it's just come down to you and me in the end.

Keiichi:
I got to say.
I got a lot more respect after seeing those moves.

Rena:
I think I preferred if you just fell deeper in love with me instead.

Keiichi:
And I wouldn't mind if you quit to protect my ego.

Rena:
Nice try. But pass.

Keiichi:
You know, I got to say I'm really digging all this tension.
It's going to be a really big letdown when I finally take you out for good.

Rena:
Think you can handle being beat by a girl?

Keiichi:
Come on!



Satoko:
So, what happens if they both get hit?

Rika:
Mii. How do you decide who the winner is?

Mion:
I got to say you both put up one heck of a fight today.
Both Keiichi and Rena gave a hundred and ten percent to this much.
The skill and stamina you two exhibited was beyond the thing of beauty.
So choosing just one winner is impossible.

Satoko:
What are we gonna do?
How are we gonna end the match?

Mion:
Well for now, today's battle will be determined a draw.
However, we will continue this war at a later date.

Keiichi:
Not so fast!

Satoko:
Oh, crap.

Rena:
I don't think that proposal makes either of us happy. happy.

Mion:
Wow tell me, what do you guys suggest then?

Keiichi:
I'm going to agree to our re-match.
But on one condition. You three have to play, too.

Rena:
I think it's time for the punishment game.
What do you guys think?

Mion:
Oh, man.

Satoko:
Shoot!

Rika:
Ni-pa.



Rika:
Come on in!
Hello and welcome to Angel Mort.

Rena:
Oh my god, she looks so cute I'm taking you home with me today, I mean it!

Keiichi:
Wow, this punishment game is extra special.

Rika:
Okay, you got to stop staring.
It's embarrassing.

Guys:
Wow, awesome!

Keiichi:
Hey, what's going on? what are you guys doing here?

Guys:
That's a dumb question.
Will you guys stop talking for a second and look over there.
Go on, take a look!

Mion:
Here you go, here's your cheese cake.
It's really good stuff.

Rena:
Oh Mion, I think you're even cuter than Rika.

Mion:
Oh, man. This isn't how I planned this at all.
I was going to make Keiichi have to wear this outfit, if he lost.

Satoko:
You know, when the next penalty game comes round, you guys are gonna pay.

Rena:
Oh, Satoko in a maid outfit, what I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do I'm taking her out home with me I'm taking her home!

Irie:
Not a chance.
Not if I get there first.
The only one who can take her home IS the dashing doctor Irie.

Keiichi:
Where did you come from?

Rena:
Listen up, basturd! No one gets interfered with my take home, do you understand that?

Rina:
What? I don't believe it. You're completely full?

Waiter:
I'm sorry, Miss.

Rina:
Oh look, it's Rena.
What a coincidence meeting you here.

Rena:
Oh, hi Rina. How are you doing today?

Rina:
Well I WAS fine, but then I came here, and they told me they are too full to seat me.

Rena:
They do get really busy.

Rina:
Well, if you won't let me take a seat, will you at least let me buy a few things from your takeout counter.

Waiter:
Yes, of course. No problem at all.
Go right ahead, take as long as you need.

Rina:
Let's see. I seem to recall he prefers some of the simple cakes, like Angel food.
Hey Rena, why don't you come here and pick something up for yourself.

Rena:
What? Are you serious? Really? Really? Wow!

Rina:
Choose anyone you want.

Rena:
Okay, let's see. Oh, this one, perfect!

Rina:
Great. All right then, two small Angel food cakes, and one Petit Trianon.
To go, please.

Waiter:
Excellent choice, Miss.


Keiichi:
You know, before I came here, I used to live in a really big city.
And I never had fun on a everyday basis like I do here. It's crazy.
Come to think of it, I don't know if I knew what it was really like to be happy until we moved to Hinamizawa.

Rena:
Yeah, I feel the same way.
You see, I only moved to Hinamizawa about a year ago myself, Keiichi.
And sometimes, I still find it hard to believe how much fun I have every single day.

Keiichi:
But because everyday is so much fun, it's kinda scary to think that one day something might happen and ruin it.

Rena:
Well, things will fall apart sometimes, no matter how hard you try to keep them together.
That's why you have to live everyday to the full, so you never feel like you wouldn't make the most of it when it's gone.

Keiichi:
You're right. That's a great way to look at it.

Rena:
Mm-hm, that said, I think I want to do some treasure hunting before I go home.

Keiichi:
You got to be kidding! You haven't had enough fun today?

Rena:
Hey, you want to come and do some treasure hunting, too?

Keiichi:
Pass. The weather looks a little unpredictable.
I think it's probably best you go home and call it a day too.

Rena:
Not just yet. Whatever I feel happy like I do today, I just know I'm gonna find something cute out there.
Well, see you tomorrow!

Keiichi:
Yep! See ya. Happy hunting.

Rena:
Thanks, Keiichi. Bye-bye!



Mother:
Rena. Do you remember when we went out for dinner and a movie, and a friend of mine came along and joined us?

Rena:
Uh yeah, his name is Akihito, right?

Mother:
Yes, that's right. Did you like Akihito?

Rena:
Mmm...

Mother:
I've got to ask you something tough, Rena.
Who do you like more, mommy or daddy?

Rena:
My mommy!

Mother:
So then, if mommy and daddy were to live in separate houses and you suddenly had to make a decision, who would you most want to live with?

Rena:
Um...

Mother:
Okay, listen Rena.
I want to leave your father, and if I did that, I'd marry that man Akihito.
I'm pregnant, Rena.

Rena:
I'm never gonna live with you!
I'll live with daddy forever!
I never want to see you again!

Mother:
But that's not fair, dear.
If you move in with your father, your life will be completely different.

Rena:
Let's make one thing clear; I'm not your dear anymore!



Rena:
Don't do it, Rena.
Don't think those thoughts anymore.
You're happy now.
You're definetely happy.



Rena:
I'm home.

Father:
Hey honey.
Ah... Did you forget to take your umbrella?

Rena:
Well, it was so nice when I left the house.

Father:
Here. Let's go to the living room.
I've got something I think you'll like.

Rena:
Dad, where did all this come from?

Father:
Well, I was thinking it was time for something new.
And since we moved into this place almost a year ago, I thought it was time I embrace this new life of ours.
Start to get a better attitude about the whole situation.

Rena:
Yay, that's great!
And then a room is as pretty as this.
How could you not feel happy about your life?
I think it looks beautiful.

Father:
Yeah, I think so, too.
Rina helped me pick all the stuff out.

Rena:
Are you just gonna throw the other stuff away?

Father:
Yeah, figured why not.
That's out with the old, in with the new.
Somebody is coming by tomorrow then pick it all up.
Oh yeah, Rena, I need you to do me a big favor.
Could you run an errand for me tomorrow after school?

Rena:
Yeah, sure. What is it?

Father:
I bought some new clothes. A couple of jackets actually.
I had them specially order from a clothing store in Okinomiya.
They should be in tomorrow if you have time to pick them up.

Rena:
Yeah, that's fine.
So, Dad. Did Rina pick this stuff out, too?

Father:
Er... Well, yeah.

Rena:
Oh...



Shop keeper:
I'm so sorry.
The delivery track is caught in traffic.
Apparently there was some kind of accident and it's running behind schedule.
It should be here pretty soon though if you're willing to wait.

Rena:
Oh, sure.


Waitress:
Take a seat.

Teppei:
You guys are late.

Guys:
I know. We're sorry.

Teppei:
Ha. So what're you gonna do about it?

Guys:
We'll try and think of something.

Teppei:
Stop wasting my time with this crap.
I just want the money you borrowed from me.

Guys:
Well, you see, this is all we have now.

Waitress:
What would it be, huh?

Rena:
Oh, yeah... Apple tea, please.

Waitress:
Sure. Coming right up.

Teppei:
Mm-hm. Hey, count that.

Rina:
Don't order me around.
I'm not your secretary.

Teppei:
You better watch that mouth.
Now shut up and count this already.

Rina:
The one who should watch the mouth is you. That money was mine, first.

Teppei:
So what we got?

Rina:
It's only the amount I lent them.

Teppei:
You moron!
Where the hell is the interest?

Guys:
I'm sorry. We don't have yet.
We'll get it though, I promise!

Rina:
Listen boys, I'm afraid my man here gets a little worked up when someone tries to slight me.

Teppei:
Yep. She is right.
If someone disrespect her, they're disrespecting me.
You see the two of us are so incredibly intertwined.
It's kinda like we were connected or something.
So you had better not disrespect us.

Guys:
We're not, we're sorry, we're sorry.

Rina:
Find a way to pay back all the interest today.
Do that, and you won't have to deal with me anymore.
You can just walk away.

Guys:
We'd love to be able to do that. But, we just don't have that kind of money. If we did, we would have brought it.

Rina:
Fine then.
You don't need any collateral for this.
The interest rate is high, but I've got to imagine it's a whole lot better than dealing with him.

Teppei:
So, did you figure something out?

What's this?
So you ARE responsible, young man.
Glad to see you know the importance of making good on your work.
So Ritsuko, tell me.
That man you got in Hinamizawa; how's he doing?
Think there's more money to squeeze out of him?

Rina:
Oh, he is a cash cow.
I heard when his wife divorced him, she felt so guilty she left him with a ton of money.
And from the way he's been spending it lightly, I think it's true.

Teppei:
How much we talking ?

Rina:
Well, he's got at least a half mill sitting on a bank somewhere.
It's taking some effort on my part, but I think I finally convinced him that it's time to start spending it.
He buys me anything I want. He's not stingy at all unlike you.

Waitress:
Here's your tea.

Rina:
You know the more I think about it.
Maybe I should get serious with him instead.

Teppei:
Yeah, right. You know no one could ever satisfy you like I do, baby.

Rina:
Save it for some place else.

Teppei:
So what's the plan, baby? How are you gonna lure in this new boy friend?

Rina:
I'll use you as bait, and then make him pay to get us out of his life forever.

Teppei:
You're one scary chick, you know.

Guys:
Well, we've signed everything.

Teppei:
Great. Now let's go get the loan, boys.
Ritsuko, take care of the bill, will you?

Excuse us.

Rina:
Well, if it isn't the leadman himself.
Long time no see.



Kasai:
Waiter.

Waiter:
Yes. What do you need?

Kasai:
That, you know, special dessert you guys make, the really sweet one. You wouldn't by any chance be serving that today, would you?

Waiter:
Oh, that one. I'm sorry, we don't have that one today.
But we'd be more than happy to make it for you if you like.
There will be no trouble at all.

Kasai:
Are you sure? If it's a hustle, just tell me.

Shion:
Hey, Kasai!
Don't be acting like a kid, just be a man and tell the guy what you want.
He's gonna make it, so take it.

Kasai:
If you don't mind.

Waiter:
Sure.

Shion:
And one for me.

Waiter:
No problem at all.

Shion:
Hey there. Is that you, Rena?
How are ya?

Rena:
Oh Shion, right?

Shion:
Yep, that's me.
So Rena, you're alone. Are you and Keiichi having some kind of rendezvous?

Rena:
No, it's nothing like that.
Um, Shion, I was wondering.
Who's this man sitting across from you?

Shion:
That's Kasai.
I guess if I had to explain it, he's kinda like my bodyguard.
If I were ever in any sort of danger, Kasai would be there to save me, wouldn't you?

Kasai:
Not really.

Shion:
Mmmmm. He's also a comedian.

Rena:
Um, Mr. Kasai, do you know who those people were you passed on the way in?

Kasai:
Well.

Rena:
Can you tell me what kind of people they are?

Kasai:
Well, the guy was Teppei Hojo. And he's nothing more than a small time crook.

Shion:
Really?

Rena:
What about the woman with him?

Kasai:
Rina Mamiya. At least I think that's what she goes by, but I believe her real name is Ritsuko.
She works as a cocktail waitress in one of the bars down on Flower Road.

Rena:
And how do they treat other people?

Kasai:
Well, Hojo most likely serves as Rina's pimp.
I'd say they are fairly dangerous people.
And It would serve you both well to never get involved with him.

Rena:
Just how dangerous are they?

Kasai:
It's my personal policy to never tell what a woman does privately.

Rena:
How dangerous are they??

Kasai:
I'm sorry I can't say.

Rena:
HOW DANGEROUS ARE THEY!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

Shion:
Rena...
Kasai, I think perhaps you should answer Rena's question.
It doesn't seem to me like she's asking just to be asking.

Kasai:
Those two are pretty dangerous for small time crooks.
I've heard they both make their living on blackmailing people and gambling debts .
They've also been known to pull a few badger games.

Rena:
I don't know what that means. What's a badger game?

Shion:
It's just a form of grifting. It's really old. It's been used for centuries.
A woman hooks up with some poor guy.
And just when they seem to be really getting along, another man barges in and says, "Hey, what're you doing with my woman!".
Then a nice guy, pays the hoodlum a lot of cash to get him to leave.
But he gets what he deserves, right?

Kasai:
I don't think anyone deserves that. A bad woman can make a good man do foolish things he would normally never do.

Shion:
Really? You don't say. So who is the bad woman lurking in your past, Kasai?
Waiter! Bring another one of those desserts for Rena, too.
......Where did she go?

Kasai:
I guess she's just up and left.

Shion:
Without even saying good-bye?
That's weird.

What are carried out are the thoughts of happiness.
What are avoided are the promises between friends.
What are left are the moments of confusion.
When They Cry "Atonement" Chapter Episode 2: PLACE TO RETURN.
 Can you believe in this?
