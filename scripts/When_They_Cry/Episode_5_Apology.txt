  Keiichi:
 Did I really do it?
 ...Maybe it was just a dream.
 But then, that means, if it's not real then he's still there with Satoko!

 Fine, it doesn't matter.
 If he's still alive, then I'll just have to kill him again!

 What's going on?!
 Who is that?
 Satoshi, is that you?
 Fine, whatever.

 Do what you want.
 I don't care anymore!



Keiichi:
 Just as I thought, his scooter's gone.

 That's weird.
 Why is the door unlocked?

(Weather Report on TV
And now for today's weather.
In contrast to yesterday's weather, today we'll see a shifting high atmosphere pressure system
which will bring us nice warm temperatures across the country.
And because of this high pressure system originated over the continent,
we'll also have some very dry air associated with it.
)

Keiichi:
 Is this last night's dinner?
 And it looks like it's enough food for two.
 So does this mean he really is alive?
 I don't get it.
 Where did Satoko go?
 Ah...! Hold on! What's running?!
 ...It's the bathtub!

 Why would someone take a bath this early in the morning?
 Ah... Satoko?!
 Does this mean she's been in here all night?!
 Satoko!

Satoko:
 ......Five thousand and thirty-seven, ......Five thousand and thirty-eight, ......Five thousand and thirty-nine, ......

Keiichi:
 Hey, Satoko!
 Satoko, Satoko!!
 Say something! Are you all right?
 It's me! It's Keiichi! Can you hear me? Are you okay?!

Satoko:
 Keiichi...... is that you...?

Keiichi:
 You're gonna be all right.
 Because I'm here to save you.
 Your Ni-ni won't let anything else happen to you, I promise!

Satoko:
 ......Five thousand and fourty......

Keiichi:
 Five thousand and forty...... What?
 Satoko, what's going on?!
 What number were you trying to count to?

Satoko:
 Ten thousand......

Keiichi:
 That's ridiculous!
 What were you thinking?!
 Why on earth would you try to count that high?!
 What made you do this?!

Satoko:
 My uncle... forced me to.

(Keiichi shouts and starts to search for him, destroying the house in a fit of fury.)

Keiichi:
 Where?! Where the hell did he go?!



Keiichi:
 We're almost there.
 Just hang in there a little bit longer.
 Ah... What's all this?

Satoko:
 What's going on?
 Why are all those police cars there?

Keiichi:
 I don't know.
 Hang here for a second.
 I'll go check it out.

Satoko:
 You're joking.
 You're really gonna leave a lady alone in the bushes with nothing more than a towel?
 Wow, what a gentle man.

Keiichi:
 If you are strong enough to be sarcastic, you'll be fine.


Doctor:
He showed signes of a high fever, incontinence, in a severe mental disorder.
It had all the appearances of the sleeping pill overdose, as soon as I made that diagnosis I began administrating treatment immediately.

Komiyama:
 Why did you wait to call the police?

Doctor:
Listen. This is the hospital, and I'm a doctor.
When I see a life's in danger, my first and only thought is to do what I can to keep that person from dying.

Komiyama:
 Fine then. What else?

Doctor:
He was breathing abnormally, so I quickly began to administer CPR the patient.
In addition to that I injected him with a respiratory stimulant.

Komiyama:
 So in other words, you did everything that you possibly could, but he still didn't make it.
 And you contacted us as soon as he died?

Doctor:
Yes.

Headquarters:
This is headquarters.
Come in.

Komiyama:
 Komiyama here.
 I just got a report from the attending doctor.
 He ODed on sleeping pills, but he didn't leave a suicide note or anything.

[OD=overdose]

Keiichi:
 Suicide...? Who are they talking about?

Komiyama:
 You know he used sleeping pills on a regular basis?

Doctor:
I'm not sure, but I really doubt it.

Komiyama:
 Did he seem like he was having trouble sleeping? ...or even suicidal to you?

Doctor:
If you knew him, you would never ask that.
He wasn't that kind of guy.
That's just not who doctor Irie was.

Keiichi:
 Irie...?! Did the coach commit suicide?
 But why?

Headquarters:
The chief has ordered us to leave the rest of it to crew on hand.
You watch you back on the search for detective Oishi.

Komiyama:
 Got it.

Keiichi:
 What was that?
 Detective Oishi's gone missing.

Satoko:
Keiichi. What's going on?

Keiichi:
 Satoko. It's you.
 Don't scare me like that.

Satoko:
 Why are all the police here?

Keiichi:
I don't have all the details, but according to what the police just said, it looks like,
 ...the coach has commited suicide.

Satoko:
 Ha...?
 Keiichi, are you absolutely sure?
 Is there any chance you could've misunderstood?

Keiichi:
 I heard it pretty clealy.
 A doctor said he commited suicide by taking a whole bunch of sleeping pills.

Satoko:
 It's a lie.
 It has to be a lie.
 ...The coach... he... he would never... he would never commit suicide...!

Keiichi:
 I'm sorry.

Satoko:
 It's not your fault.

Keiichi:
 Yeah, but... yesterday I saw the coach, and then I... I cursed him; ...I said I hoped he died.
 And now, he really is dead.

Satoko:
 Keiichi, it's just a coincidence.
 It's not your fault.
 I'm tired of things stuck out here in just a bath towel.
 I want some clothes.

Keiichi:
 But don't you think someone at the clinic should take a look at you first?

Satoko:
 I think that I can wait.
 It's not like I'm gonna die in a time it takes me to put on some clothes.

Keiichi:
 Yeah, but...

Satoko:
 Can you please just take me to Rika's house?
 She'll have some of my clothes and I'll come back, I promise.

Keiichi:
 OK then.



Keiichi:
 It's just so weird.

Satoko:
 What's so weird?

Keiichi:
 Did you hear that Ms.Takano died?
 I overheard it yesterday.
 She burned to death.

Satoko:
 Ha?

Keiichi:
 And if that was an enough, now I just heard that the detective Oishi guy has gone missing too.
 Ms. Takano, the coach, and Oishi..., I wished all of them would just die.
 And it looks like they're really did.

Satoko:
 Because you wished to...?

Keiichi:
 I don't know how, but for some reason, when I wish people to die, they really do.
 And that's not it.
 There something else that's even weirder than this.
 Satoko, it has to do with your uncle.

Satoko:
 Why do you keep bringing him up? I asked you not to!

Keiichi:
 Yesterday, he was home, he was at your house, wasn't he?

Satoko:
 Why are you doing this!
 Please stop it! I can't take it!

Keiichi:
 But there's no way.
 He shoudn't be there, not after the cotton drifting festival.
 Because, because I...

Satoko:
 Please! Stop!

Keiichi:
 Because I killed him with my own two hands!
 Satoko, on the night of the cotton drifting festival, I saw your uncle and I killed him.
 So that's why... I don't understand why he keeps coming around; he should be dead!
 It doesn't make sense!

Satoko:
 Let me down.
 Please, let me down.

Keiichi:
 I know what you're thinking.
 You think I've gone crazy too, ...don't you?

Satoko:
 Look. It's just a simple coincidence.
 I have no doubt it's really hard for you to believe that because you curse all these people and then they suddenly end up dead.
 I think you should just go home and rest for a while and the thing will start making sense.
 I'm feeling much better so.

Keiichi:
 Really? Are you sure you're okay?

Satoko:
 I'm telling you the truth I'll be fine, I promise.
 I'm just tired standing around talking to some guy in nothing more than a stupid bath towel.

Keiichi:
 Satoko...!

(Keiichi finds Rika dead.)

Keiichi:
 No!!!!!!!!
 This didn't happen!
 I didn't wish for this!
 I wouldn't do that!
 I would never wish for this!
 This can't be real!
 It can't be...!
(Screaming)



(Satoko comes and screams.)

Satoko:
 Eek!!!!!!

Keiichi:
 Hey, hold on and wait, Satoko!
 I didn't do it!

Satoko:
 Mur... Murder... Murderer!

Keiichi:
 Satoko, I didn't!

Satoko:
 No!!!!!!!!

Keiichi:
 Satoko!

Satoko:
 Murderer, Murderer...!

Keiichi:
 No!! I didn't do it!!
 I didn't kill her!!
 I promise!!

Satoko:
 I can't believe I always thought you could be my Ni-ni.
 Always since ni-ni's gone missing, I've been so incredibly lonely.
 And then you transferred here.
 I think it changed.
 And we are all having fun again and I stop think so lonely.

Keiichi:
 Satoko, wait!
 You got this all wrong!

Satoko:
 Why... Why...

Keiichi:
 Satoko!

Satoko:
 Go away!
 Don't come near me, murderer!

Keiichi:
 Satoko... None of this makes any sense to me either.
 But I do know one thing for certain.
 I know I'm not the one who killed Rika.
 That's something that I just wouldn't do!

Satoko:
 How am I supposed to believe you after all you have done!

Keiichi:
 Satoko... You've got to believe me!
 I wouldn't do that... I promise!

Satoko
 Then what's with the axe, huh?
 You just happened to be carrying it around today?

Keiichi:
 Ah, you scared of this?
 Fine, I'll throw it away.
 It's gone.

Satoko:
 You think all you gotta do is to just throw that thing away, [never relax!]
 You don't need a weapon to kill me.
 If you really wanted to, you could easily kill me with your bare hands!

Keiichi:
 What do you want me to do then?

Satoko:
 What I want you to do?
 Put your hands over your head and turn around slowly.

Keiichi:
 There. How's this.

Satoko:
 Regardless of what's happened, I still believe that you're not a bad person.
 I think the most likely answer is that something bad has decided to possess you.
 I should know.
 It's not like I haven't experienced something like this myself.
 For me, it all started when I decided to climb on the roof of the ritual tool shrine.

(In a Flashback)
Rika:
 .........Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten!
 Ready or not, here I come!

Children:
Just try and find me!


Satoko:
 Is this Oyashiro...?

Children:
Hey, where's Satoko?

Rika:
 Satoko, come out already!

Satoko:
 Oh no, this is bad.

 Ah!!


Rika:
 It wasn't me! It wasn't me! It wasn't me! It wasn't me! It wasn't me!


Rika:
 I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
(Out of a Flashback)

Satoko:
 And it was after that, When the world I knew suddenly became very strange to me.

Keiichi:
 What do you mean? Became strange...

Satoko:
 I know exactly why these things happen to me.
 They happen... all because of Oyashiro's curse.
 It's all of part of his divine punishment for disgracing the shrine, and for abandoning my best friend.
 First my mom and dad get swallowed by that river.
 They hits my mean aunt who's next to die.
 And then my Ni-ni who loved me more than anyone else in the world just abandons me and runs away.
 And then, and then...

Keiichi:
 Hey, Satoko,

Satoko:
 And then, suddenly you transfered here.
 And I was sure things had changed... that I would be happy again.
 And now, something has possessed you, and Rika's dead.
 I can't take it anymore.

Keiichi:
 Satoko, calm down.
 This is not about the curse.
 No one is out there intentionally trying to hurt you.

Satoko:
 No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Keiichi:
 This isn't real.



Satoko:
 Die! Murderer!
 I want him back, I want my Ni-ni back, I want him back Keiichi!

Keiichi:
 Whoa, Satoko! Satoko!

Satoko:
 I won't do it, I won't give in, and I won't give in to that curse!
 You can take everything away from me, but I won't never give in!

Keiichi:
 Satoko, please just listen!
 You've got to believe this.
 The truth is all I wanted is for you to be happy!

Satoko:
 Shut up!
 How dare you pretend to be him, you are not Keiichi, and I know it!
 Now, Fall!
 Fall, and DIE!!!!!!!!!!

Keiichi:
 Please believe me...

Satoko:
 Fall and Die ALREADY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Keiichi:
 Satoko!

 ...That was it.
 The last thing I heard her say to me... was 'fall'.
 Such a sad and pathetic ending.
 What happened to those beautiful warm Hinamizawa days?
 Where did they all go?
Or more accurately, where did they go wrong...?
 As I fell, I wished for one last thing.
 And that wish may very well have been for death....
 Death to everything in Hinamizawa; everything that had gone wrong.

xxx xxx xxx first, in the village of Hinamizawa, outside Shishibone, a large scale disaster has occurred.
Although details have yet to be made clear.
It seems that a poisonous volcanic gas has erupted from somewhere in the Hinamizawa district.
The flow of gas directly hit the village and it appears every home in the district has been exposed.
Currently the confirmed death count is already greater than 1,000.
The Self-Defense Force's still trying to determine the extent of damage.
Number of victims is expected to rise throughout the night.
Ah, it seems we've just received some late-breaking information.
They were able to confirm just one survivor.
The surviver's name is Mr. Keiichi Maebara, a resident of Hinamizawa.
