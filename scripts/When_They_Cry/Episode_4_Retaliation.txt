Mion:
This is Mion. Thanks for the update. Please handle the situation as discussed.
And one more thing: make sure everyone and your end keep their mouths shut about this.
Is that clear?

Shion:
(What did she want them to be quiet about?)

Mion:
Were you listening?

Shion:
Um... No. I couldn't hear what you were saying.




Mion:
What you heard is true, but Mr. Tomitake and Ms. Takano are now victims of Oyashiro's curse.
This is most unfortunate, isn't it?



Shion:
Come on, sis. What are you... 



Mion:

And it seems Ms. Takano was stuffed into a barrel, and then lit on fire way back deep in the mountains.

Shion:
But... Why? Why did they die that way?

Mion:
Do you really not get it, Shion? I'm surprised. The reason is so obvious!

Shion:
Huh? What do you mean? What reason?

Mion:
Oyashiro's curse!

Shion:
(Satoshi, I think I finally understand. It's just like I thought, the Sonozaki family is behind all of this.
And it's time I make them pay for what they did to you!
Then unlike you, I'm gonna come out of this alive!)

Oryo:
And just who would be calling at this hour of night... ahhh!


Mion:
Shion... Come on! Why are you doing this?

Shion:
I bet you never thought that you would be the one who would be caged, did you?

Mion:
As the next heir of the Sonozaki family, I order you to release me!

Shion:
Haha... Not really was it very threatening, I'm afraid.
You should really work on sounding a bit more commanding.
However, truth be told, you could threaten me all day long, and I still wouldn't care.

Stuffing Ms. Takano into a barrel and lighting her on fire is rather impressive, but what about Mr. Tomitake?
Did you shoot him up with some kind of mystery drug?
Or is there some kind of ancient torture tool that make his wound appear self-inflicted?

Mion:
How would I know anything about this?

Shion:
Listen, Mion. The last thing I suggest is for you to sit here and try to stonewall me.
I couldn't let you go if I wanted. I've gone too far down this road to turn back now.

Let's get to the point.
I wanna know once and for all whether all these deaths that you people refer to is Oyashiro's curse,
just a larger extention of the dam conflict.

Mion:
To be honest, I think that they probably are.

Shion:
Shouldn't the next head of this family be a bit more imformed?

Mion:
I'm just a representative for grandma. She doesn't tell me about the inner workings of things.

Shion:
So then I guess it's safe for me to assume, granny is the one who decides who Oyashiro will curse next?

Mion:
All the delicate issues are handled by her alone. And I just release whatever imformation she wants me to.
I'm not sure but I think there're someone else who carries out these kind of issues.

Shion:
But why were Mr. Tomitake and Ms. Takano singled out when they have nothing to do with the dam conflict?
Could it have something to do with them sneaking into the ritual tool shrine?

Mion:
They violated the tool shrine?

Shion:
You're kidding. I, I thought you already knew this.

Mion:
Well, that's what they did. This was inevitable.

Shion:
But tell me, Mion.
Why did they both die? I thought the rule was clear: one dies and another dissapears.
But for some reason, this year, both Ms. Takano and Mr. Tomitake were killed.

Mion:
I have no idea...

Is that possible that there were four people who snuck into the shrine?
See, if that were the case, then chances are the other two will be spirited away by the demon.


Shion:
(That means, Keiichi and I are next...)

C'mon, you old bag! Stop napping and wake up for Christ's sake.
Listen, hag. If you think you can avoid this by pretending you're asleep, you're wrong!

We'll find out just how asleep you are.

I don't believe it... 
The wench is dead...
without the word to anyone,
not even apology to Satoshi,
and she didn't even have to suffer!

It's not fair!

Now how do you feel, you old bag?

Who is that? You're following me like Rena said?
Are you Oyashiro?
Hah! Only an idiot would believe that!

Mion, you've heard this rumor, haven't you?
That somewhere deep in this torture room, there're some hidden well,
and the only way to get to it is through a secret passage way that leads outside.

Listen, Mion. You can either help me, or I can go back to rushing gradma.
The choice is yours.

Mion:
It's, it's over there, just beyond that dark cell.

Shion:
Interesting! I wonder why they keep it hidden.
So, Mion, ever been down there before?

Mion:
No. No desire.

Shion:
Hahaha... That makes sense,
seeing how that's where the bodies are supposed to be tossed after they finished torturing them.

Mion:
Shion, if you drop her in there, she'll die!

Shion:
Well, that might be kind of difficult. You see, Mion, she's already dead.

Mion:
Shion...
How could you... how could you be so evil?

Shion:
Beats me.

Mion:
Satoshi?
You're doing this to avenge him?

Shion:
You know what, Mion?
Now that I think about it, I had a pretty good reason for wanting to kill this wretched old bag of the grandmother.
Wanna know what it is?
It's not just about her being one to instigate Satoshi's murder. It's about the fact that she lied to me!

You were there! You heard it!
She told me if I tore out my fingernails, then I would be forgiven.
And I was foolish enough to believe her, so I did it. Three of them!
Then that had ended. That was how I distinguished myself!

But clearly she didn't keep that promise!
Or Satoshi would still be here right now, wouldn't he?
Why? Why did she lie to me?
And then, after he disappeared, you stopped by for a little visit and you said, "all was forgiven."
You said because I distinguished myself, they no longer had an issue with Satoshi!
But you didn't stop there. You went on to tell me the Sonozaki family didn't know anything about his disappearance!

Mion:
Well, yeah. But that's...

Shion:
SHUT UP!

THIS - IS - ALL - YOUR - FAULT!
GIVE HIM BACK! I WANT HIM BACK! GIVE SATOSHI BACK!

Relax, Mion.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
If what you said was true, you then really didn't know what was going on.
Then I won't torture you, I promise.
But, if I find out you were lying to me, too, well then, no matter how much you scream, your fate is sealed.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA...


Shion:
Hello, Sonozaki house.

Kimiyoshi:
Hello there. Sorry to bother you all so early in the morning. It's Kimiyoshi, dear.
Is your grandmother awake by chance?

Shion:
No. It seems she exhausted herself yesterday.
I can wake her, but I think it's the best if she gets her sleep.

Kimiyoshi:
No, no. Don't wake her. Just give her a message when she wakes up.

Shion:
Of course.

Kimiyoshi:
Ah, let's see what's the best way to phrase this.
Just tell her that we've decided to hold an emergency meeting tonight at five at the shrine's assembly room.
It's regarding what happened yesterday, okay?

Shion:
Got it. I'll let her know.

Hello, Sonozaki house.

Kasai:
Mion, is that you? Good morning, it's Kasai.

Shion:
Oh. Hey, Kasai. So how have you been?

Kasai:
I'm fine. Is Shion still over there?

Shion:
Yeah, she's just washing her face right now. Hold on, I'll go get her.

Hey, Kasai. Good morning.

Kasai:
Good morning. I'm sorry to bother you, but do you need a ride back to Okinomiya?

Shion:
Oh, don't worry. I'll figure it out.
Hey, I've got a question. Did you hear what happened?

Kasai:
Regarding what?

Shion:
Regarding to two sacrifices. It seems they now know why Oyashiro wanted to curse them.

Kasai:
Really?

Shion:
Yeah, from what I heard it. Sounds like the two of them decided to pick the lock on ritual tool shrine.
And then after that, snuck in to have a look around.

Kasai:
That was stupid.

Shion:
Yeah. Well, to be honest, I was there with them, too.

Kasai:
Did you go in?

Shion:
Um... I did. Ms. Takano kinda took me into it.
There were actually four of us, Ms. Takano, Mr. Tomitake, myself, and this boy, Keiichi.

Kasai:
(Sigh)
So Shion, how are you planning on distinguishing yourself this time?

Shion:
Hmm... why don't I go for all five fingernails on this one?
Sorry... bad joke.
Listen, I spent most of my life in Okinomiya because grandma couldn't bear to look at me,
so the consequence I don't know all the secret rules of Hinamizawa.

Kasai:
Believe me, Shion. I'm on your side, but there're some rules you just cannot break, and this is one of them.
I'm sorry, Shion. But you're on your own.

Shion:
Kasai... haha, alright.
Well, I gotta go. Sis is here.
Haha... I'm so screwed.

(Calm down. This isn't the time to panic.
All I gotta do is become Mion and let people think that Shion disappeared.
I just told Kasai that I went into the tool shrine. I'm sure that would get around.
And people will just assume I was spirited away by the demon.
The only person I've gotta worry about is Keiichi.)

I think it's time to go after the enemy.
Keiichi... I'm sorry but you have to be the prey.

(It seems Keiichi Maebara just suddenly disappeared one day.
That's what they'll say and I can't let that happen.
I'm sure the enemy will take the bait. I've just gotta be there when they do.)

Keiichi...





Keiichi:
Mion, what's going on? You don't look so good.

Shion:
I'm okay. I had to do the family dinner thing after I got back to the festival last night.
Guess I had too many.

Keiichi:
You've got a hangover? How old are you, anyway?

Shion:
Hahaha... cut me some slack, man.
Yeah, it's true I'm not feeling 100% today.

Oh, yeah. By the way, Keiichi.
It's about last night, did you happen to see Mr. Tomitake and Ms. Takano?

Keiichi:
Ah... no. I don't know.

Shion:
(Well, this boy couldn't to lie to save his life.)
Oh, okay. Then let me ask you something else.
Last night, did you see Shion?

Keiichi:
Well, you asked me that, didn't you?

Shion:
Oh, did I?
(That means Mion had already questioned to him before the night was over.
Damn it! When I brought up to her, she said she knew nothing about someone breaking into the ritual tool shrine.)
Well, that's good to hear. Eh... oh, don't stress.
I guess I sort of fun I might get a different answer if I ask you again today, so no worries.
I'll definetely let them know. Don't worry, Keiichi. I'll tell them you weren't involved in anything bad.
I'll make sure to let them all know that, okay?

Keiichi:
What do you mean, "them?"

Shion:
Well, I definitely succeeded in getting Keiichi totally freaked out.
I can't believe how far he was sweating back there.
Guess I'll switch back to Shion. That's probably the best way to keep an eye on him.

Kimiyoshi:
Hello there. Is that you, Mion?

Makino:
Thanks for coming out today. I appreciate you all making time for this on short notice. I know you're all busy.
I think it's best if we let the head of the village start things off. Go ahead, the floor is yours.

Kimiyoshi:
Thank you. I hope you all forgive me for remaining seated.

Shion:
The head of the village went on this long wrap-up of the festival,
but the room suddenly got very still the moment he brought up the murders.
For five years in a row now, string of bizarre deaths has plagued Hinamizawa.

Kimiyoshi:
So, Mion, did Oryo mention anything about this to you?

Shion:
As you all know, I serve as a representative for the Sonozaki family.
I came here, so that I could speak on behalf of Oryo. She sends her apologies for not being here.

(You can do this. You and Mion are twins. What's in her is in you...)

Unfortunately, we cannot deny that Oyashiro's curse has struck for the fifth year in a row. This is regretable, but true.
So now that the curses occurred again this year, does anyone in this room know why?
I do.
There has been a break-in at the tool shrine. These people invaded its holy ground, and brought impurity to its soil.

Makino:
What were they thining?

Member:
Those idiots!

Kimiyoshi:
Then they've got what they deserved!

Shion:
(I can't believe even Kimiyoshi is angry. He's like everyone's grandpa.
It's perfectly clear now.
The person who serves as the middleman between my wrethed old grandmother and Oyashiro's curse,
is definitely somewhere within this room.)
Please, let me finish.

Kimiyoshi:
Quiet down. Let her finish. There's still more.

Shion:
Four thives snuck into the ritual tool shrine, but just two have been punished.
The two violators that haven't been punished are Shion Sonozaki and Keiichi Maebara.
Shion Sonozaki's punishment will be...
(Look at them. They don't care. They're totally emotionless.)

Kimiyoshi:
Has Keiichi Maebara had his punishment yet?

Shion:
No, not yet.

Ah, would you swing by my house for a minute?

Kimiyoshi:
Sure. Does Oryo wanna speak to me?

Shion:
She does. It seems there're something she would like to tell you in person.

There you are.
Just give her a moment and she'll be right out.

Kimiyoshi:
No problem. I don't have anywhere else to go.

Shion:
You know, I think she may wanna talk to you about Shion.

Kimiyoshi:
By the way, where is she?

Shion:
The basement.

Kimiyoshi:
I see.
Well, what do you do? She knew not to go in there.

Shion:
Yeah, but I just can't help feeling sorry for Shion. She was never really allowed to spend any time in Hinamizawa.
I'm sure she knew what she was doing was wrong, but... but probably just not on this scale.

Kimiyoshi:
Tell me, Mion. Does Shion truly regret the mistake she made?

Shion:
She does, but she's afraid.
She thinks she might be spirited away by the demon like Satoshi Hojo was last year.

Kimiyoshi:
That won't happen. As long as Shion truly regrets her actions, I guarantee you the demon won't touch her.
I give you my word, your sister will be safe.

Shion:
Do you promise?
(This is great! I can't believe it! I've got granpa Kimiyoshi on my side!)

Kimiyoshi:
I really doubt she would experience the same fate as that Hojo brat.
No, it'll be okay. Shion will be forgiven.

Shion:
(Did you just say, "Hojo brat?")


Kimiyoshi:
There's nothing we can do to help the Hojo family, not after they tried to sell out the entire village.
You know there're just certain things that will curse your family forever.

Shion:
Yeah, but granpa, I thought that we were gonna let the whole thing go with Satoshi when Shion distinguished herself last year.
Wasn't that the deal?

Kimiyoshi:
What do you mean? What deal?

Shion:
You know, the three fingernails.

Kimiyoshi:
Sorry dear. That's not the case.
Those three nails were just for Kasai, Yoshiro, and Shion's actions.

Shion:
(You're kidding...
The third nail wasn't for Satoshi?
But the next time I saw Mion, she said that everything was gonna be forgiven.
Then we could be together.)

I want to know why Satoshi Hojo had to be spirited away by the demon.

Kimiyoshi:
Huh?

Shion:
It's true that Satoshi's parents were responsible for trying to sell out the village,
but I still don't see what sin he committed.
Why did I even ask this? He's gone because you all wanted it.

Kimiyoshi:
No, that's not it! You're wrong, Mion!

Shion:
No matter what the Hojo family is cursed, it doesn't matter who it is.
If you're Hojo, no one cares! According to this village, you're just another piece of trash!
That type of thinking started here and spread throughout this community.
I'm sorry, but I can't forgive you for that!
It's people like you who've made their lives as miserable as they are today.

It's your fault!
How could you be so unfair to Satoshi?
What did he ever do to you?

Nothing!
His sin was nothing more than being born in the Hojo.

So why?
Why was Satoshi struck by Oyashiro's curse?
What'd he have to deserve something like that?
