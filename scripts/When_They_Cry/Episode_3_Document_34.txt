  Oishi:
From the looks of it, it seems the victim died by clawing out his own throat.
I guess you could say he was killed by his own hands.

Irie:
That's a very odd way to kill oneself, don't you think?

Oishi:
Maybe. It was drugs.

Irie:
I'm not aware of any kind of drug that would make a person claw at their own jugular. I don't think that's it, detective.

Kumagai:
Oishi.

Oishi:
What?

Kumagai:
What's up with this piece of wood?

Oishi:
Well, I think the victim might have swung it around like some kind of weapon.

Irie:
I noticed that a great deal of bruises are all over Mr. Tomitake's body. Any idea of what that may be about?

Oishi:
Well, that would most likely indicate that after the festival, he was attacked by someone on his way back to Okinomiya.

Irie:
I forgot about Ms. Takano.

Oishi:
Hey, isn't that lady the nurse at your clinic?

Irie:
Detective. I think Ms. Takano was with the victim tonight.

Oishi:
All right, Kuma. Go have the department check and see if she made it home tonight.

Kumagai:
Yes, sir.

Oishi:
Hey, while you are at it. Check with the local police. See if they had any unidentified female body show up this evening.

Kumagai:
You got it.

Irie:
Are you checking to see if Ms. Takano was killed tonight as well?

Oishi:
Well, I just want to make sure. See, with tonight being what it is known, she could very easily be the fifth.

Irie:
What?

Oishi:
The mysterious deaths of Hinamizawa, also known as Oyashiro's curse.


Satoko:
Ahahahaha. The syringe says everything you need to know about who did it.

Keiichi:
Ah. Pretty clever.

Rika:
I guess if Satoko's getting serious about this game, I should get serious, too.

Rena:
Fine. You're not the only one who could put on your game face.

Mion:
Ahahaha. Things are really heating up. I love it!

Chie:
I'm sorry to interrupt your card game now. But Rena, it appears that you have a visitor here to see you.

Rena:
I... I do?

Oishi:
Oh. Are you Ms. Ryugu? Ms. Rena Ryugu?

Rena:
Sorry. Do I know you?

Osishi:
You know, the air conditioning in my car works pretty well. What do you say we have a little chat in there?

Rena:
What do you want to talk to me about?

Oishi:
Well, I wanted to ask you a few questions about this man here. You've ever seen him before?

Rena:
Isn't that Mr. Tomitake?

Oishi:
If you know that guy, then tell me if you know this lady here.

Rena:
Yeah. That's Ms. Miyo. Miyo Takano.

Oishi:
Excellent. Do you remember the last time you saw those two people?

Rena:
I think the last I saw, was the night of the festival.

Oishi:
Well, when you say you saw them at the festival, did anything seem out of place? Anything at all.

Rena:
Why are you asking me this? Has something happened to the two of them?

Oishi:
Well.

........................................
.................
......

Takano:
Hey, is that you, Rena?

Rena:
Oh, Ms. Miyo. How are you?

Takano:
I'm doing fine. It's not often I see you at the library.

Rena:
Yeah, I know. What brings you here?

Takano:
Well, I have been doing a little research on something.

Rena:
The mysterious deaths?

Takano:
I'm sure you've heard about it, right? The mysterious deaths that surround Hinamizawa.

Rena:
Yeah.

Takano:
It'll happen again this year. I know it will. That will make it the fifth.
The legend of Oyashiro is rather fascinating; do you know it?

Rena:
I do.

Takano:
These mysterious deaths are carried out by a fanatical organization.
They worship Oyashiro in an effort to illustrate the power they believe he wields.
That's my theory at least, but there are others.

Rena:
These people do this? To show he is powerful?

Takano:
It started when the village changed its name to Hinamizawa. When they did this, they stopped practicing a lot of the customs, the old traditions in Onigafuchi village.
And it's my suspicion that there is a group of people trying to revive these customs, in order to bring reverence back to the name of Onigafuchi.

Rena:
Oh.

Takano:
Most likely it's the three great families of Hinamizawa.
They say the demons came out of Onigafuchi swamp to attack the village.
Trying to stop the carnage, Oyashiro stepped in to calm the demons.
He then changed them into humans so they could co-exist with other villagers.

Rena:
Is that part of the legend of Oyashiro, too? Never heard it.

Takano:
So tell me, Rena. What are your thoughts on the legend of Oyashiro?

Rena:
Er... Um... You see, I have a different experience with it.

Takano:
Ah, so?

Rena:
Well you see, I have actually met Oyashiro before.

Takano:
You met him?

Rena:
Yeah. I was born and raised in Hinamizawa. But when it came time for elementary school, I moved.
My mother got a new job, and we moved to Ibaraki for it. And then...

Takano:
So you are saying you defied Oyashiro by leaving Hinamizawa, even know he'd forbidden it, is that right?

Rena:
It is. And that's when all these bad things started to happen.
I did things I would normally never do, and I had no idea why I was doing them.
I wanted desparately to destroy myself.
And so one day I decided to take a blade to my wrist.
When I threaded it open with a razor, the wierdest thing happened.
All these maggots started crawling out, along with my own blood.
But you could tell they didn't want to when they kept trying to crawl back inside the wound.
It was as if the air was toxic and the only place they were safe was inside me.
And then I started scratching. I began clawing at the wound. I was trying to dig them out of my veins.
It itched, like you wouldn't believe.

Takano:
Rena.

Rena:
And that's when I first saw Oyashiro. And he spoked to me.
He said if I want to live, then I have to move back to Hinamizawa. It's the only place where I can be safe.
It's too weird to believe, isn't it?

Takano:
No, not at all.
This scrapbook is very dear to me, but I'm going to lend it to you.
I have a feeling you're one of the few people here who would take it seriously.

Rena:
Thanks.

Takano:
Let me know what you think.
There maybe things in here that only someone who's been through what you've been through could understand.
Oh, and one more thing. You need to keep this scrapbook and all my research a secret, okay Rena?

Rena:
A secret? But why?

Takano:
There are some bad people involved in this, and if they find out I've been looking into some of their dark closets, I could easily be silent for it.

Rena:
Bad people?

Takano:
See you later.

Oishi:
On the night of the cotton drifting festival, Mr. Tomitake and Ms. Takano both died.


Rena:
Homing Instincts and Homesickness?



Keiichi:
Ha? What? Whaa!
What are you doing, Rena?

Rena:
Keiichi. I've got this feeling that these guys are following me.

Keiichi:
Huh? Who is it? The cops?

Rena:
I'm not really sure who it is. But right after the festival, it's started.

Keiichi:
Why are they following you?

Rena:
Well I'm not really sure, but I have this feeling they might be after Ms. Miyo's special scrapbook.

Keiichi:
Ms. Miyo? Oh, you mean Ms. Takano.

Rena:
Yeah, that's her. I heard she's been murdered.

Keiichi:
What?! When?!

Rena:
On the night of the festival. I think it happened right after we both saw her.
Mr. Tomitake was killed, too.

Keiichi:
He was murdered, too?! Why haven't we heard anything about this?

Rena:
'Cause the police aren't opening their investigation to the public.

Keiichi:
But why?

Rena:
I think it's because of the reserch Ms. Miyo was doing on the curse.
By digging around, she found the secret all about the village. Something most people didn't know besides her.

Keiichi:
So, what was the secret then?

Rena:
Well, Ms. Miyo put together these scrapbooks, and was kind enough to lend them to me, but I haven't looked at all of it yet.
There's just so much information to go through. I'm still trying to verify at all.

Keiichi:
Huh? Verify?

Rena:
Mm. Who's that?

Keiichi:
Huh?
Do you think those guys were looking for you? Was that them?

Rena:
They could be. I saw that car go down this deserted street earlier that no cars ever go on.

Keiichi:
Could they be the ones? Who killed Mr. Tomitake and Ms. Takano?

Rena:
Probably.

Keiichi:
OK, listen. I want to help you out with this, Rena, but in order for me to do that, I'm gonna need to know the whole story, okay?

Rena:
All right then. Most likely the people who killed Ms. Miyo are from the three great families.
And it just so happens that Mion's family the Sonozaki is a part of the group.

Keiichi:
No way!

Rena:
You've heard about the mysterious deaths that surround Hinamizawa, right?

Keiichi:
Yeah.

Rena:
Well, it was Ms. Miyo's belief that all those death were the result of some fanatical organization trying to revive the legend of Oyashiro.

Keiichi:
Okay, yeah. But... why was Ms. Takano murdered? What did she do to deserve something like that?

Rena:
Well I'm not positive, but I think it has to do with this big secret that the three great families have been hiding for ages.
If that gets revealed, they're afraid the sanctity of Oyashiro will be gone forever.
And when they discovered Ms. Miyo was close to digging this all out, they decided to get rid of her... for good.

Keiichi:
So, what is the secret then? Sounds huge.

Rena:
Um, well, I haven't actually been able to verify yet. I still need a little more time.

Keiichi:
I got you.

Rena:
Keiichi. You gotta promise you won't tell anyone what I just told you.
That goes for Mion and Rika, and even Satoko too, okay? No one.

Keiichi:
Got it.

Rena:
All right, that's it. I'm gonna go.

Keiichi:
Rena.

Rena:
Hey, Keiichi. We're friends, right?

Keiichi:
Yeah.

If the Sonozaki family is involved in all this, does that means Mion is, too?
Uh-uh. There's no way. No.


Guys:
Hey, kid. What's going on? On your way home from school?

Keiichi:
Yeah, you could say that.

Guys:
So tell me. You didn't happen to see a little girl walking down this road xxx on, did you?
She wears on a big white hat and white dress, oh-oh yeah, she also has a huge purple ribbon around her neck.
So, did you see her?

Keiichi:
No, I didn't see anyone like that.

Guys:
All right. No big deal, just all we'd ask.
It just started because we saw the girl on this road earlier.
It's hard to believe you two didn't cross paths.

Keiichi:
Nop. Sorry.

Guys:
Thanks for your time, kid. You know, we're not familiar with these parts, and I think we're lost.
Maybe you could help us out here.
Think you might be able to give us some direction back to the school?

Keiichi:
You wanna go to the school?

Those guys ARE after Rena.



Keiichi:
Rena. Please tell me. What exactly did Ms. Takano write in that scrapbook of hers that ultimately got her killed?

Rena:
Well, to summarize, if what Ms. Takano wrote in her scrapbook is actually true, then the god these people believe in could be discredited.

Keiichi:
And this is really what they are afraid of?

Rena:
Yeah. That's why they are trying to revive the belief that the Oyashiro is a god, to gain more supporters.
But they are trying not to be obvious about it, so that no one really knows what they're up to.

Keiichi:
Rena, I'm sorry, but I'm just not following all of this.

Rena:
You see, they believe Oyashiro is a god, but actually he isn't.

Keiichi:
Then what is he?

Rena:
They are all kinds of legends about Oyashiro.
They've been teaching them to the children for generations now.
But they're all centered around one thing. And that's not to leave, and not to let in.
One of the legends talks about why Oyashiro was born in the first place.
And the story goes that he emerged to protect the villagers being attacked by demons from Onigafuchi swamp.
But this is where the legend falls apart what they're teaching is wrong.
The demon from the swamp didn't attack the villagers.
Something else came out of that swamp, and if the villagers touched it, they'd become demons.

Keiichi:
So, what came out of the swamp?

Rena:
A parasite.

Keichi:
A parasite?

Rena:
Yeah.
It was some bizarre contagious disease that would come out of the swamp at night.
And if someone got infected by, it would drive them completely insane.
Will it make more sense to you if I call it a virus instead?

Keiichi:
No, I get it.
Well, that explains why they did't want people to leave or let in.
So then, where did Oyashiro come from? Was he a doctor from a foreign country or something?

Rena:
I don't really know for sure. But he could've been a doctor.
And maybe whoever he was, he tried to treat the disease.
But, it wasn't really a treatment. it was just some homeopathic approach to it.

Keiichi:
Why do you think that?

Rena:
Well, I think that's all they had available to them at the time.
And in order to keep the parasite from spreading, they created the bunch of rules for the villagers to follow.
That's why they came up with the notion, "you can't ever leave this village, and you can't ever let outsiders in."

Keiichi:
Yeah. That was their way of controlling the virus.

Rena:
The temperature and elevation in Hinamizawa are the perfect bleeding ground for the parasite which doesn't exist elsewhere.
When the host, that being infected person tries to leave Hinamizawa, the parasite causes a strong reaction in the person and prevents them from leaving.
And it's this form of obstruction which keeps Oyashiro's curse alive.

Keiichi:
Hold on. Wait a sec, Rena. I don't know about the past, but nowadays, isn't it pretty unusual for people to try to leave or even enter the village?

Rena:
It is. And that's parts of Oyashiro's master plan.
It was all his doing that no one comes or goes here anymore.
You see the reason they kept the village sealed off for so long was to try and control the spread of the parasites.
So if someone infected by the parasites went crazy and attacked somebody else, they would kill that person destroying the parasite at the same time.
See this aggressive parasite can only exist if it finds the right host body, so [that I thought] was if they killed enough of these host, they could somewhat control the virus.
And so by doing this, they weeded out everything except the parasites and the people who could live compatibly with each other.

Keiichi:
So it was kind of like natural selection.

Rena:
Kind of. But what's more important is that we finally know the truth
This explains the stories that the people here have demon blood in them.

Keiichi:
I guess you are right.

Rena:
And the reason the cotton drifting festival existed in the past so they could eat the intestines of the people who went crazy.
But this was also to control the virus.

Keiichi:
But why? Like a vaccination?

Rena:
I always pegged you for it, smart guy, Keiichi. That's exactly it. So in reality, what they were doing wasn't barbaric at all.
It was incredibly necessary for them to do that in order for the villagers to strengthen their resistance.

Keiichi:
Wow, that's interesting.
I'm surprised how scientific their approach was, considering the era.

Rena:
Yeah. But for anyone who thinks Oyashiro is a god, this theory can be more than just a little upsetting.

Keiichi:
Yeah, of course. If the pathogen that causes this disease was discovered and then released to the public, then the people who worship him religiously would be devastated.
They wouldn't have anything left to believe in.

Rena:
Right. But it gets even more disturbing.
If these religious extremists are going to revive the power of their god Oyashiro, then that means they're probably trying to revive this terrible parasite.

Keiichi:
Wait! What does that mean?
These people wouldn't really do that, would they? In order for it to actually work, they had to spread the parasite all over Hinamizawa.

Rena:
I know. They want to revive Oyashiro. And they want to do it by any means necessary.

Keiichi:
But what you're talking about is biological terrorism.

Rena:
I know.

Keiichi:
Hey, Rena, is the Sonozaki family involved in this? And if so, is Mion a part of it, too?

Rena:
Well, Mion and Rika are descendants of the three great families. But I don't know if they're directly involved or not.
However, if they aren't involved in any of this, I don't think we should tell them.
If they know what we know, it could put them in danger.

Keiichi:
Damn it. I'm so pissed with Ms. Takano right now. She left such a big freaking mess to deal with.

Rena:
It's true. But I'm glad you are on my side, Keiichi.

Keiichi:
Oh yeah, of course!
We're friends, aren't we?

Rena:
We are. Thank you.


Student:
That's two!

Chie:
Yep! That's right! You got it.

Keiichi:
Listen, Mion. You're not doing it right.
You can't calculate like that. It won't work.

Mion:
Boo!
Your way makes my brain hurt.

Keiichi:
I don't care. Do it again!

Mion:
Oh right, slave driver!
Oh look, I got it! I got it!

Keiichi:
No, you didn't. That's wrong!

Mion:
No way!

Keiichi:
Yeah, it is!



Chie:
Well, I'll let you do your job, then.

Worker:
Thank you. Don't worry, we'll do a good job. I promise.
Oh yeah, I almost forgot, they told me I should leave this card with you, too.

Chie:
Okay, sure.
Well, let me show you where to start.

Worker:
It sure is hot out here.

Chie:
It's true.
Days like this are good days for curry.

Worker:
Really. Good to know.


Operator:
The number you have dialed is not in service. Please check the listing and try again.
The number you have dialed is not in service. Please check the listing and try again.

Rena:
I knew it. It's them.

Chie:
Did anyone hear about Ms. Ryugu leaving early today?

Well, it worries me that she would leave without telling anybody.



Keiichi:
Me too. There's got to be something going down.

The blood that oozes out is from the memories of your past.
What you notice are the severity of your sins.
What is left is your resolute future.

Can you believe in this?
