  Yuichi:
I'm home.

Piro:
Meow.

Ayu:
Welcome home, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Thanks.
So, how's aunt Akiko doing now?

Ayu:
Nayuki came home and made her some rice soup, so we'll see she can eat that.

Yuichi:
Okay.

Ayu:
Um, are you all right?
You're looking sort of pale.

Yuichi:
Hm? Oh, it's just really cold outside, that's all.


Yuichi:
Does Shiori know about this?

Kaori:
Yes, I told her.
She begged me to tell her what I knew.
I didn't think it was fair not to tell her.

Yuichi:
But couldn't they make a mistake?
I mean, maybe [might] her next birthday [shou...]... you know...

Kaori:
This is exactly what the doctor said.
Even if she does make it to her next birthday, she won't hold on much longer.

Yuichi:
Yeah, but...

Kaori:
I haven't said anything to Nayuki.
I don't want her to worry about us.
I... When I noticed that you and Shiori have been hanging out at school a lot, I figured it'd only be fair for me to tell you everything.
So, you wouldn't be surprised.

Yuichi:
Yeah, thanks...

Kaori:
Well, my house is this way, so...

Yuichi:
Hold on a second, Kaori.
Shiori's birthday is this coming Sunday, isn't it?
Do you think... it's a really good idea to keep ignoring her?
She doesn't have that much time left.

Kaori:
Shiori... she... she laughs a lot when she's with you, right?

Yuichi:
Yeah, she does.
I've never seen her crying before, come to think of it.

Kaori:
Yeah...

Yuichi:
Hey, Kaori.


Ayu:
Yuichi, I'm coming in.
It's so dark in here.
Mind if I turn on the lights?

Yuichi:
I do mind.
I want it dark.

Ayu:
Really? Why?

Yuichi:
Because of light, it's my skin that's gonna turn into dust.

Ayu:
Aha ha ha.
So, when did you turn into a vampire, huh, Yuichi?

Yuichi:
Did you want something?

Ayu:
No, not really.
I just got the feeling that you might need some company when you came up here.
That's all.

Yuichi:
Mind your own business.

Ayu:
You're right.

Yuichi:
You sure are a strange one, aren't you?

Ayu:
I guess so.

Yuichi:
Thanks for checking on me.


Teacher:
From here on, nothing will alarm me.
My mind ceases to function as I act as foolishly as a little child.
The doctor tells me that I am suffering from paranoia mostly like due to my extrema fatigue.
He tells me that there is no cure, not even the slightest hope of recovery.

Yuichi:
So, it looks like both of the sisters are absent today.

If you lose something, I'm the guy who's gonna go help you look for it.
If there are demons, I'm the guy who's gonna help you fight them.
But with Shiori...
Hey, Makoto.
How was it for you?
What do you think I should do for a girl who... who has so little time left.

- Episode 17 - Lieder Ohne Worte of an Elder Sister and a Younger Sister


Shiori:
Don't you think this place is even prettier at night during the day?

Yuichi:
It's too cold for me at night.
I think I like the daytime better.

Shiori:
Oh, I'm sorry to hear you feel that way.

Yuichi:
That thing runs all night, huh?

Shiori:
I was surprised it's even still running this late.

Yuichi:
I bet it'll freeze over if it's stopped.

Yuichi, Shiori:
Argh!

Yuichi:
Man, that's super cold.
Isn't there a way to xxx and keep it from sprinkling?

Shiori:
Even if there was a way, I'm glad they didn't make it stop.
I mean, just look at how beautiful it is right now.
Don't you just wanna keep staring at the water? Forever and ever...

Yuichi:
Hmm...

Shiori:
When I was just a little girl, I used to come visit this fountain with my family all the time.
I was health enough then to stay out all day.
My sister and I would sit together in the glass and eat ice-cream cones.
I wish we could've had one more afternoon tea and ice-cream together.
Now that I think of it, those days might have been the most fun I've ever had in my entire life.

Yuichi:
So, I guess our date comes in a distant second, huh?

Shiori:
He he. Don't be silly, Yuichi.
Our date was just as much fun as eating ice-cream.

Yuichi:
You sure are a smooth talker.

Shiori:
No, really I'm serious.
I'm pretty certain if I had more time, you and I would have gotten to know each other better, and I would've ended up liking you more and more.
Guess it's all for the best.
I don't have any business getting too attached.

Huh...
There are so many things I need to apologize for you, Yuichi.
And at the same time, there are so many things I need to thank you for.

Yuichi:
So, what's your illness called?

Shiori:
It's got a complicated name.
And no matter how much medicine I take and how many shots they give me, there's nothing but anybody can do to make me better.
I guess you could say that's why I don't really remember the name anymore.
I mean, what would be the point of remembering.
Memorizing the name of a non curable diseases isn't gonna keep me alive any longer.
When my sister first went to your school, she told me how people would eat in the courtyard when it was nice.
She promised that, one day, nice or not, the two of us would eat lunch out there.

Yuichi:
You know I'm not sure Kaori feels the same right now.

Shiori:
I know, Yuichi.
And I'll respect her feelings, I'm trying to stay away from her as much as I possibly can.

Yuichi:
See that's what I don't get because you guys used to be so close before.

Shiori:
Staying away from her is the least thing I can do to make her feel more comfortable.
I don't wanna cause any more pain.

Yuichi:
Uh...

Shiori:
Yuichi, can I ask you to do a little favor for me?

Yuichi:
Uh, yeah.
What do you need me to do, Shiori?

Shiori:
If you can do it, please keep treating me just like you would have a normal girl.
Your treating me like that before and it'd really help me to remember the time when I was truly happy.

Yuichi:
What do you mean?

Shiori:
It was when I could go to school and eat lunch with everyone in the cafeteria.
And walking through the shopping district with friends after school, even though I wasn't very strong.
I could stay out late at night, and get in trouble with Mom and Dad.
But my sister Kaori always stood up for me.
I was actually able to live normal life for a little while.
So, that's why I want you to keep treating me exactly the same way you have been.
And while if it's okay with you, maybe you could be like my older brother or something.

Yuichi:
All right, I'll do it.
You have my word.

Shiori:
You really mean that?

Yuichi:
Sounds you don't mind a big brother like me.

Shiori:
Oh, he he, thank you so much, Yuichi.


Yuichi:
So, you coming to school tomorrow?

Shiori:
Yup.
And if you're lucky, I may even have a surprise for you.
But you can't ask me what it's gonna be?

Yuichi:
Uh, if it's another one of your portraits, thanks, but no thanks.

Shiori:
I wasn't going to give you a portrait.
And I don't like people who say stuff like that.

Yuichi:
Don't get mad.
I was only kidding.

Shiori:
Even so, that was a mean thing to say.

Yuichi:
I apologize.
And I'll treat you to some ice-cream if you can find it in your heart to forgive me.

Shiori:
Once I get the ice-cream, all will be forgiven.

Yuichi:
Man, you're really easy.

Shiori!
Is there really no way that you can beat this thing?
I mean they can always find a cure or something, right?

Shiori:
Well, I guess I could make it if like a miracle happens.
Only you know they are called miracles because they don't happen very often.


Yuichi:
"I'm still a little feverish, so I'm going to bed.
Please heat up the soup. Akiko."

So, you're the only one still awake, huh?

Piro:
Meow.

Yuichi:
Uh...

Piro:
Meow. Meow.
Meow.

Yuichi:
She was waiting up.

Yuichi:
Don't let the bedbugs bite.


Nayuki:
I am so sleepy...

Ayu:
Uguu. I'm so sleepy.

Yuichi:
Huh?
What are you talking about?

Ayu:
I had a scary dream last night and I couldn't sleep.

Yuichi:
Yeah.

Ayu:
I was been carried around by a ghost.
It was really scary.

Yuichi:
That's a pretty weird dream.
I wonder why you think someone was carrying you.

Ayu:
I don't know.

Nayuki:
Uah...


Yuichi:
She said she was coming.

Kitagawa:
Yuichi!
It's time to eat some yammy food!

Yuichi:
How come you always act like such a weirdo?

Kitagawa:
What's with you?
You're feeling constipated or something.

Nayuki:
Hey, are you gonna eat in the cafeteria again, Yuichi?

Yuichi:
Yeah, I lost my other lunch partners.
I might as well...

Kitagawa:
Kaori, why don't you and I go eat with them too?

Kaori:
I think I'm gonna pass.
I don't have much of an appetite.

Nayuki:
Are you sick?
Do you need to go to the nurse?

Kaori:
I'm all right.
Just leave me alone.

Kitagawa:
Say, do you know what's going on with Kaori?

Yuichi:
No, I don't.

Girl:
Yuichi!
Someone's here for you!
Looks like you've got a guest.

Yuichi:
Shiori...

Kitagawa:
Yey, [even] you've been messing around with a first year too?

Yuichi:
Calm down a second, geez.

Kitagawa:
Uh, hey, Kaori!
You going to the cafeteria?
Hey! Wait for me!

Nayuki:
What is going on with her?

Yuichi:
I think you should go check and see if Kaori's all right.
I've got something I need to take care of.


Shiori:
Oh...
So this is the school cafeteria, huh?

Yuichi:
Are you sure you'll be all right coming back to school like this?

Shiori:
My doctor gave me special permission.
He said it was fine for me to come until Saturday.

Yuichi:
Saturday...
The day before Shiori's birthday.

Shiori:
Uh...
It looks pretty spicy.

Yuichi:
I gotta say they really know how to do curry right down here.

Shiori:
Uh...

Yuichi:
What's the matter?
The food's getting cold.

Shiori:
Uh... How silly of me...

Yuichi:
What the heck is wrong with you?

Shiori:
Maybe I should've told you before that I can't really handle spicy foods.

Yuichi:
You kidding me.
What about stuff like wasabi?

Shiori:
I can't even look at it!

Yuichi:
Hot mustard?

Shiori:
Don't say those words together!

Yuichi:
Tabasco sauce?

Shiori:
It's mankind's enemy!

Yuichi:
What about ice-cream?

Shiori:
I think that's one of my favorites.

Yuichi:
Then why in the world did you ask me to order a curry?

Shiori:
I guess it was because I just wanted to have whatever you're having, Yuichi.


Yuichi:
You sure?
Because I ended up eating most of your lunch myself.

Shiori:
I know.
But I still had enough to eat, I promise.

Yuichi:
Tomorrow, order you something you can actually eat.

Shiori:
Well, in that case, maybe I should just bring a bento lunch.

Yuichi:
That sounds like a great idea!
You can eat it and it's cheaper.

Shiori:
Then I'll do that.
I'll make sure to bring a lunch for you too, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
For me?

Shiori:
That's right.
I'll cook you up something good.


Yuichi:
I'd like to make a little detour tomorrow.

Shiori:
Sure, now don't forget!
I'm bringing you a lunch tomorrow, okay?

Yuichi:
I can't wait.
Even if it's nasty, I promise I'll shove down every bite.

Shiori:
I really don't like people who say thing like that.

Yuichi:
Well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow then.

Shiori:
Yeah.
'Kay. I'll see you at lunch time.


Kaori:
I'm home.

Shiori:
Oh, I was wondering when you'd finally be back, Kaori.
Hey, is there snow still coming down out there?
I wanted to talk to you... about today at school I...

Kaori:
I'm tired.

Shiori:
Ah...


Shiori:
Yuichi!
I'm right over here behind the little tree, Yuichi.
I saved the two of us a table.

Yuichi:
I can see that.
Good thinking, scouting out some seats.
You got a pretty good head on your shoulders, kiddo.

Shiori:
Mm-hm. Thanks!
I thought it was a good thing to do.
Ta-da!

Yuichi:
Wow, man, you made a whole lot of food!

Shiori:
Yeah, I packed all kinds of stuff.

Yuichi:
So, which one of these is yours?

Shiori:
Neither one.
Both of these are for you.
And I packed another little box for myself.

Yuichi:
Huh? Both of them?

Shiori:
This is what I made for me.
And you said you'd finish every bite, remember?

Yuichi:
Yeah, I did tell you I did, didn't I?
Well, no matter how difficult it is, you should only keep your promises, no matter what.

Shiori:
You don't sound very happy about it.

Yuichi:
xxx but I am.
And I can't wait to get started.

Yuichi:
Oh...

Shiori:
Didn't I bring you too much food?

Yuichi:
Oh, yeah, maybe a little bit.

Shiori:
I'm so sorry.
I guess while I was putting them together, I started having so much fun.
There were so many dishes that I wanted to make for you.

Yuichi:
It was delicious.
And it all fit pretty nicely in my tummy.

Shiori:
Oh my gosh, did it, really?
I'm so happy.


Shiori:
It's been a while since I made a detour like this on my way home from school.

Yuichi:
Everyone needs a break from daily routine now and then.

Shiori:
Yeah.

Yuichi:
So, what do you think, how did you like the ice-cream?

Shiori:
Oh, it was the best I've ever had.

Shiori:
This shop has really weird looking stuffed animals.
And it looks like there are a whole lot more in the back that I can't even see from here.

Yuichi:
I don't understand the kind of stuff this guy has.
Maybe it's best not to get involved.

Shiori:
I think we should go in.

Yuichi:
Are you serious?
What I mean, that's what you really wanna do...
Ah!

Yuichi:
Ah... Hey, I just remembered that I forgot something at the table in the coffee shop.
Go in and look around the store, okay?
I'll be back in a second.
Stay here till I get back!

Shiori:
Huh?


Yuichi:
Kaori!
Kaori, wait up, will you?
Stop running away!
Why don't you come with me and Shiori and get a cup of tea or something.
It's pretty clear that you're worried about her too even if you don't wanna be.

Kaori:
You must be confused.
I don't know anyone by that name.
And leave me alone.

Yuichi:
Kaori!


Yuichi:
Bitch...

Shiori:
Huh?

Yuichi:
Oh, well, I was just talking to myself.
Sorry. Now where were we?

Shiori:
I was talking about that toy shop that I just visited.
There was this funny old man who talked about every toy.
He even suggested a few things for me to buy but I finally had to tell him that I didn't have any money.
And it's a good thing 'cause I would've bought everything he showed me.
Is something bothering you, Yuichi?

Yuichi:
Huh?

Shiori:
You seem kinda distracted.

Yuichi:
No, no, it's nothing.
What kind of stuffed animals did he have anyway?

Shiori:
Oh, he had all kinds of weird ones in there.
There was this enormous salamander and a strange looking monitor lizard.

Yuichi:
And a giant anteater.

Shiori:
Oh no, I didn't notice him having that.

Yuichi:
Yeah...

Mai:
If someone else in your life is trying to turn away from the troubles, try to keep an eye off her, okay?
Please do your best to be there for her.

Shiori:
Hello!
Earth to Yuichi!

Yuichi:
Uh... I'm sorry.
So, which one of them did you like, the giant salamander or the monitor lizard?

Shiori:
Actually, I like something else.
The ceramic piece in the window.
It was really amazing.


Yuichi:
One, two, three, four...
So, that's my total budget, huh?
Come in!

Ayu:
Hello, meow!

Yuichi:
Huh?
Uh, it's just you.

Ayu:
That's not a nice thing to say.

Yuichi:
What do you want, Ayu?

Ayu:
I came to tell you the bath's ready.
You going to buy something?

Yuichi:
Well, yeah.
So, you wear that headband all the time even after taking a bath, huh?

Ayu:
Oh, this?
Um, it was a gift from somebody who was really important to me.

Yuichi:
Now that we're on the subject of presents, Shiori's birthday is coming up at the end of this week.

Ayu:
What are you getting her?

Yuichi:
What do you think I should get her?

Ayu:
Taiyaki!

Yuichi:
That's what you like, not what she would like.

Ayu:
Then, give her cash!

Yuichi:
You're the last one when I expect to be practical.

Ayu:
Well, if you have a lot of money, you can buy a lot of taiyaki with it.

Yuichi:
Okay, can we think of something other than taiyaki?

Ayu:
Uguu...
Maybe instead of trying to buy her something, you could just do something kinda special for her that would make her really happy.

Yuichi:
Huh...

Ayu:
Like you could take her to her favorite place and treat her to a dinner.
Or you could make her a picnic then the two of you could talk.
I mean I don't know Shiori as well as you do.
What would make her happy?

Yuichi:
The one thing that would make it happiest would be... something to do with Kaori.
I've got it.

Ayu:
Yuichi?

Yuichi:
That's it.
It's the only thing I can really do to make Shiori happy now.

Ayu:
What is it?
Tell me.

Yuichi:
Huh...

Ayu:
Huh?
