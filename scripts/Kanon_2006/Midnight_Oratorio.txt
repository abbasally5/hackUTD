  Nayuki:
I'm back.

Akiko:
Welcome home, honey.
It must be exhausting to practice as much as you do.

Nayuki:
I've got a long-distance relay coming up.
I've gotta work extra hard.

Akiko:
Hm..

Nayuki:
Is Yuichi here?

Akiko:
Oh, no.
He's at the hospital visiting a friend of his.

Nayuki:
Did Ayu go with him too?

Akiko:
I think she did.

Nayuki:
Mm.

Akiko:
Here, your tea.

Nayuki:
Thanks a lot, Mom.

Akiko:
Mm-hm.


Sayuri:
Mai told me the whole story.
Sayuri had no idea any of that was going on.

Yuichi:
I don't look so depressed, Sayuri.
It's all water under the bridge as far as I'm concerned.
What about you?
You have managed to explain your injury to the police?

Sayuri:
Yeah.
Sayuri just told them that a bear must have come out of hibernation early and we've been attacked.
So how does the school look?

Yuichi:
The building is kind of wreck, but it's okay.
I mean they're still able to hold classes and stuff.
The weird thing is everyone thinks they had a prank by a bunch of guys who go to a different school.

Ayu:
Because they don't think there's any way Mai could've trashed the school like that all by herself.

Yuichi:
Oh, I guess it must've caused a lot of trouble for those guys.
But at least it looks like we are all finally off the hook now.

Sayuri:
That's good to hear.
Now we can start thinking about the future instead of focusing on the past.

Ayu:
What do you think, Mai?

Mai:
They say I should be out of here in this break.
They are not certain yet, but they think I'm going to miss my graduation.

Yuichi:
That's what they told you, huh?
I'm really sorry to hear it.

Sayuri:
In the mean time, Mai's mom will be here a lot.
And Sayuri's father promised to visit as much as he can whenever he's not working.
So please don't worry too much about us if you can help it.

Yuichi:
It's a deal.
Make sure you'll get plenty of rest, okay.
A good night sleep is gonna do you a world of good.

Mai:
I haven't been able to sort out my feelings yet.
But I'm sure if I give myself some time, I'll be able to finally calm down, and maybe figure a few things out, you know?
Thank you so much, Yuichi.
I really mean it.

Yuichi:
You really are one incredible girl, you know that?
I've never seen you ignore a hardship hoping you would go away,
it's pretty inspiring to watch you face your troubles.

Mai:
If someone else in your life is trying to turn away from the troubles, try to keep an eye off her, okay?

Yuichi:
Huh?

Mai:
Please do your best to be there for her.
My power is going to be diminished for a quite while.
So, there's really nothing I can do to help.

Episode 16 - Midnight Oratorio


Ayu:
That Mai is such a mysterious person.

Yuichi:
Sorry I roped you into coming here with me.

Ayu:
No, I was glad to come, because I really like Mai.
But I...
I don't think I like this place very much.

Yuichi:
Well, not many folks are crazy about hospitals.
So, that's understandable.

Yuichi:
Hm?

Ayu:
Hm?

Yuichi:
Uh, Shiori?

Shiori:
Oh, hi, Yuichi.

Ayu:
Wow, I haven't seen you in ages.

Shiori:
Don't tell me, you both have colds too.

Yuichi:
No, we just came here to visit a friend.
They say an "Uguu" a day keeps a doctor away.

Ayu:
Nobody says that!

Shiori:
Nice to see you still argue the same way I remember.

Ayu:
My name is Ayu Tukimiya.
I don't think I properly introduce myself for the first time.

Shiori:
My name is Shiori Misaka.
Nice to meet you.

Ayu:
Nice to meet you.

Doctor:
Miss Misaka?

Shiori:
That's my doctor.

Doctor:
Are these friends of yours?

Shiori:
Yes.

Doctor:
Oh, uh...

Ayu:
Huh?

Yuichi:
So, tell me what exactly is the matter with her, doctor?

Doctor:
Oh, I apologize.
It's nothing honestly.

Yuichi:
Hm?

Ayu:
Hm?

Doctor:
Your mother and I just finished our conversation so you're welcome to come back now.

Shiori:
Right.
Well, I guess that means I'd better get going.
Good to see you guys.

Yuichi:
Sure, see you around.

Ayu:
Take care of yourself.

Yuichi, what exactly is wrong with her anyway?

Yuichi:
Well, she told me that it's... really bad cold.

Ayu:
Uh... Really?


Kaori:
Good morning.

Kaori's Mom:
Good morning.
Oh, Kaori, you look so pale.
Did you have trouble sleeping again?

Kaori:
I've gotta go.
See you tonight.

Kaori's Mom:
What about breakfast?

Kaori:
I don't have time.
I've got a club meeting.

Kaori's Mom:
Kaori, before you go, I wanted to ask if you could please talk to her again?
I understand how you feel, honey...

Kaori:
I'm leaving.


Ayu:
Good morning, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Oh, has Nayuki already gone to practice?

Ayu:
Yeah, she did.
She jest left a few minutes ago.

Yuichi:
What about aunt Akiko?

Ayu:
Looks like she's still asleep.

Yuichi:
You're sure about that?
'Cause usually aunt Akiko wakes up before anybody else.

Ayu:
Oh, I know, so I'm gonna make the breakfast.
So, sit right down and I'll whip something up in two shakes.

Yuichi:
Oh, you know what I forgot I've got a morning practice too.

Ayu:
You're not on any sport teams, Yuichi.
Aha ha ha.
I guess I'm not as good a cook as Ms. Akiko, huh?

Yuichi:
Huh.

Ayu:
Uguu...
Sorry about this, Yuichi.


Yuichi:
Oh, well, I guess I just have to stop by the convenience store on my way...

Ayu:
Yuichi! Yuichi! Yuichi! Wait!

Yuichi:
Hey, What's up, Ayu?

Ayu:
It's Ms. Akiko!
It's Ms. Akiko!

Yuichi:
What's the matter with aunt Akiko?

Ayu:
Ms. Akiko is...
I just went to check on Ms. Akiko and I think she's getting sick just like my mother did.

Akiko:
Hello, Yuichi.
You're back from school early today?

Ayu:
Ms. Akiko, shouldn't you be in bed?

Akiko:
Oh, no, I'm all right.
Just feeling a little bit feverish this morning.

Yuichi:
Thank god.
The way Ayu was panicking and tripping over, so I thought that was something really serious going on.

Ayu:
Uguu... But I...

Akiko:
I'm sure I'll be as good as new if I can just get a little bit of rest.
I'll go to bed.
Don't worry about me.

Yuichi:
Don't scare me like that.

Ayu:
I think I'm going to stay home with Ms. Akiko today and take care of her.

Yuichi:
And what if I say you should go to school instead?

Ayu:
Hm...
I hear what you're saying, but I really love Ms. Akiko and I think I should help her.


Nayuki:
I didn't even notice.
I was in such a hurry to leave.
I hope she's not too sick.

Yuichi:
As much as I'm concerned about how your mom's doing, I'm actually more worried about Ayu.
She was in a total panic when she ran up to me this morning.

Ayu:
Hello.

Yuichi:
Hey, Ayu, it's me.

Ayu:
Nayuki and I wanted to see how aunt Akiko is doing.
Her fever's gone down a little bit.
But we just ran out the cold medicine, I was just about to go out and see if I could find some.
Do you have any idea where I can find a drugstore?

Yuichi:
What is going on over there?

Nayuki:
Yuichi, can I talk?

Yuichi:
Mm.

Nayuki:
Hello, Ayu, this is Nayuki.
I'm sorry you had such a stressful morning.

Yuichi:
Make it kinda quick.
The bell's gonna ring in a second now.

Nayuki:
Mm-hm.
There's a drugsotre at the edge of the shopping district.
Do you have any money?
Yeah.
So, you got things under control?
Well, we'll be home as soon as I can after school gets out this afternoon.
Right? Right!
I'll see you there then.

Yuichi:
What did she have to say about the money?

Nayuki:
She said she had a little leftover from the last time she went grocery shopping for Mom.

Yuichi:
That's good.

Nayuki:
I should probably be at home helping Mom too.

Yuichi:
Hey, she's okay.
She's got a snap, all is Ayu's being a drama queen, that's all.

Nayuki:
But still...

Yuichi:
Ayu doesn't have a mother to worry about.
So, that's why she's overreacting right now.

Nayuki:
Oh, I see...
So when she was talking about her family being on a long trip somewhere, she was just talking about her father?

Yuichi:
Um...


Yuichi:
Ayu? Were you able to get the medicine?

Ayu:
Yeah, but it says she's not supposed to take it on an empty stomach.

Yuichi:
Well, isn't there anything in the kitchen that's ready to eat?

Ayu:
Well, I did look around.

Yuichi:
Why don't you just go get something?
They have some microwavable soup at the store around the corner.

Ayu:
I know but I'm kind of worried about leaving her alone again, you know?

Yuichi:
I see.

Ayu:
Yuichi, what should I do?

Yuichi:
Hm, that's a really good question.

Nayuki:
Uh, can I talk to her?
Hey there, Ayu?
I can tell you how to make some rice soup, you've gotta pay careful attention, okay?
Do you have a pen and something to write on?
First of all, there should be some leftover rice in the refrigerator from last night's dinner.

Ayu:
Mm-hm.
Okay, I think I've got it.
I'm gonna go give it a try.

Nayuki:
Right.
You're gonna be fine.
Just do your best!

Nayuki:
Why are you looking at me like that?

Yuichi:
You really know how to come through right when it counts, don't you?


Shiori:
A cold?

Yuichi:
Yeah, Nayuki is on the phone talking to Ayu again right now.
After her first two phone calls, I figured out I'm not much help.

Shiori:
I understand.
I'm so sorry.
I'm being kind of selfish by taking up your time like this.

Yuichi:
Hey, don't sweat it.
Tomorrow's Sunday, so I was wondering if you had any free time then.

Shiori:
Huh?

Yuichi:
I don't know if you remember but I said that we should go out some time.
Well, if you want, you and I can hang out tomorrow.

Shiori:
O-kay...


Nayuki:
I have to go tell my coach that I'm skipping practice today, so go on home without me.

Yuichi:
Sure.
See you there.

Nayuki:
Yeah, see you in a couple of minutes.

Yuichi:
I'm home, guys.
Hey, how are aunt Akiko and Ayu doing?

Piro:
Meow.

Yuichi:
Looks like she really was struggling in here.

Piro:
Meow.

Yuichi:
It's Yuichi.
Can I come in?

Akiko:
Of course.

Akiko:
Did you have a good day, Yuichi?

Yuichi:
Uh...
Shouldn't she be awake and you are asleep?

Akiko:
Oh, she's the reason I'm feeling better.

Ayu:
Mommy, look..


Shiori:
I'm glad the weather is so nice today, aren't you?

Yuichi:
Yeah.

Shiori:
Is your aunt feeling any better this morning?

Yuichi:
Much better, thanks.
Looks like it was a just little cold so she should be back to 100% in no time.

Shiori:
That's wonderful.

Yuichi:
What about you?
How's your cold treating you these days, Shiori?

Shiori:
Some days I feel better and some days I feel worse.

Yuichi:
Uh, you should work on getting better for good.
Then you can go back to school again.

Shiori:
Okay, right on then.

Yuichi:
So, what's with the sketchbook, huh?

Shiori:
Oh, I just really enjoy drawing things.
And it's such a beautiful day today.
I was thinking of sitting down and doing a sketch somewhere.
Would you like me to draw a portrait of you, Yuichi?

Yuichi:
Are you sure you really wanna have me be your model?

Shiori:
You've got a point there.
What's something nice I can draw?

Yuichi:
Uguu...

Shiori:
Oh, I'm just kidding.

Shiori:
Hey, Yuichi.
Isn't that one of those arcade thingies?
I've always wondered what it would be like to spend an afternoon in an arcade.

Yuichi:
Haven't you ever been in an arcade before?

Shiori:
Well, I've always wanted to go but I never have.

Yuichi:
Don't tell me, you used to be a fox living up in the woods on Monomi hill.

Shiori:
I don't know what you're talking about.

Yuichi:
I'm just messing around.
So, you gonna play some or what?

Shiori:
Heh heh heh.


Shiori
Take that!
And that!
Hmm! Oh! Oh...
Oh, does that mean game's over?

Yuichi:
Uh... I've never seen anyone miss every single mole before.

Shiori:
I guess I just don't have very good eye-hand coordination.

Yuichi:
It's actually pretty amazing to see someone not score at all.
Even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while.

Shiori:
I don't really like people who give compliments like that.


Yuichi:
So, this is your favorite spot in city?

Shiori:
Of course it is.
Because this is where I first met you and Ayu that time.
Do you remember that day, Yuichi?
The day that I met you?

Yuichi:
That's when Ayu ran into the tree and you got covered with snow, right?

Shiori:
If I try really hard, I can remember every moment of that day.
I'd have to say, it's one of my most cherish memories.

Yuichi:
It only happened a couple weeks ago.
It can't be that important yet.

Shiori:
Time has nothing to do with whether a memory is important.
The only thing that really matters is how somebody feels about it after it's all over.
And for me, it was pretty important.

Yuichi:
If I'd known it was gonna be that big of a deal to you, I would have dressed up.

Shiori:
I can't explain it.
I just thought you and Ayu were so funny, I couldn't stop laughing.
By the time I got home I was laughing so hard, I was crying.
It was so strange.
I don't think I've ever laughed that hard before in my life.

Shiori:
This is it.
It's maybe my second favorite spot in the whole world.

Yuichi:
We're the only ones here.

Shiori:
Isn't that great?
It's like it's reserved for us.

Yuichi:
Huh?

Shiori:
Hi!

Yuichi:
Argh!

Shiori:
Hehehe.

Yuichi:
Shiori, you do know that you just made a terrible mistake, don't you?

Shiori:
Oh, yeah?

Yuichi:
Oh, man, you're gonna get...
You just xxxxx
Ah! Ah!

Shiori:
Hey, play nice!
And don't put in rocks in them.

Yuichi:
I don't need dirty tricks.
Oh!

Shiori:
Oh!

Yuichi:
See if you could handle my all-out, pulverize!
Oh, yeah. That's right.
You want it more?
Bury in the baits.
Yeah, all right.


Shiori:
Okay, I think I'm finished now.

Yuichi:
Great!
I can't wait to see it.

Shiori:
You're gonna look at it?

Yuichi:
Come on, of course I am.

Shiori:
Oh, no, you can't.
It's too embarrassing.

Yuichi:
I don't think that's fair after using me as your model and all.
Yo!

Shiori:
No! I told you you can't look at it.

Yuichi:
Hmm...

Shiori:
What do you think?

Yuichi:
Do you want me to be honest with you?

Shiori:
Yes.

Yuichi:
I think... that drawing portraits might not be your thing.

Shiori:
You know, most people would find a nicer way to put that if that's what they thought.

Yuichi:
In that case, how about I'd just say the paper things?

Shiori:
I don't know if I like that comment any better.

Yuichi:
Do you mind if I keep this?

Shiori:
Huh?

Yuichi:
You took the trouble to draw it and all.
That alone makes me pretty happy.

Shiori:
Uh... Sure!


Shiori:
Time really does fly when you're having fun, doesn't it?

Yuichi:
I'll hang out with you until time runs out.
I have nothing else planned for today.

Shiori:
Time runs out...
I wish that things could stay exactly like they are forever and ever, don't you, Yuichi?

Yuichi:
Uh...

Shiori:
Um, hey.
I guess there's one more place that I'd like to go.
Is that okay?
It's been a long time since I wore a pair of indoor shoes.

Yuichi:
Looks like all the club activities are over.

Shiori:
If a teacher sees us, we're gonna be in a whole lot of trouble.

Yuichi:
If I see any teachers, I'll throw you over my shoulder and run out of here.

Shiori:
Would you, really?

Yuichi:
Well, I'll do it if you're not too heavy.

Shiori:
That is so rude.
You know I'm not that heavy.


Yuichi:
So this is your homeroom, huh?

Shiori:
Yup. And this is my seat.
Oh, it's probably not my seat anymore.

Yuichi:
You don't think so?

Shiori:
Oh, the seat assignments are probably all different by now.
After all, I was only here for the very first day of the very first semester.
It was gonna be the beginning of a new life, starting off at a new school.
But on my first day here, I collapsed.
And ever since that day, I haven't been back inside the school.

Yuichi:
I knew that.

Shiori:
Huh?

Yuichi:
One of your classmates told me why you stopped coming.
Apparently, she talked to you a bit at the opening ceremony.

Shiori:
Oh, is that right?

Yuichi:
And then she told me that she was worried about you.

Shiori:
The truth is the doctor told me that I probably shouldn't go to the opening ceremony in the first place.
But I had a dream that I had to fulfil, so... to go to the same school that my big sister goes to, to eat lunch with her in the courtyard whenever we can, to stop off somewhere on our way home, and to chat about all stuff that happened that day.
But when I told my sister about all that, she thought it was pretty funny.
She said my dream sure doesn't cost much.

Yuichi:
So, it wasn't a cold after all, huh?

Shiori:
Oh, no, I've been physically weak ever since I was a baby.
So, I knew coming to class every day would probably be impossible for me to begin with.
I lied to you, Yuichi.
I'm so sorry.


Nayuki:
Hm? Welcome home, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Hey, Nayuki.

Nayuki:
Is something the matter?

Yuichi:
Uh, no, it's nothing.

Nayuki:
Hm?

Yuichi:
I'll answer it.
Hello, Minase residence.
Yes, speaking...
Hey, what's up?

Kaori:
So, you really do live there?
I need to talk to you, Yuichi.
Do you mind coming out?
I'll make it as quick as I can, I promise.

Yuichi.
Hey, Kaori.
What did you wanna... talk about?
So, is it about Shiori?

Kaori:
Yuichi...
Shiori is...
She is my...
I'm lying to you.
She's my sister.
Shiori's been weak ever since she was just a baby.

Yuichi.
That's what I hear.

Kaori:
She was just really looking forward to it.
Going to the same school as I did, eating lunch in the courtyard, and meeting up and going home together... to do that kind of simple everyday stuff that's always what Shiori was dreaming about finally getting to do.
I don't suppose she told you that her birthday xxx a week away.
Every doctor has told her she won't make it to her next birthday.
And that's the one coming up.

Yuichi.
Huh?

Kaori:
She's going to die soon.
It's true.
And so, I've been trying to ignore her.
I couldn't bear to watch her getting weaker day by day.
She's going to leave me.
I knew that she was going to leave me before too long...
That's why I avoided her.
I tried to pretend that she never existed.
I wished sometimes I'd never had a sister at all.
Why do we have to go through all of this?
I don't understand.
I don't understand why I ever had a sister in the first place.

Yuichi:
Kaori...

Kaori:
Yuichi...
Yuichi...
Why was she...
Why was she even born if she was just going to die!?
.
