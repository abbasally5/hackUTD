  Yuichi:
She's late.
 What the heck is she doing?

Nayuki:
You've got a bunch of snow on you.

Yuichi:
That's because I've been waiting around out here for two hours.

Nayuki:
O...Oh, my goodness!
 I didn't realize I was so late!
 I thought it was just two o'clock!

Yuichi:
Even if it were two o'clock, you'd still be an hour late.

Nayuki:
Aren't you cold?

Yuichi:
I'm freezing.

Nayuki:
Oh, I guess so.
 I'm so sorry!
 It's been seven years now.
 Hey, do you even remember my name after all this time?

Yuichi:
What about you?
 Do you still remember what my name is?

Nayuki:
It's Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Hanako.

Nayuki:
No, that's not it at all!

Yuichi:
Steve.

Nayuki:
You do remember that I'm a girl, right?

Yuichi:
Man, I'm seriously gonna catch a cold.

Nayuki:
You still haven't guessed my name.

Yuichi:
Come on.
 Let's get out of here.

Nayuki
But... Yuichi?

Yuichi:
Are you coming?
 Nayuki.

Nayuki:
Mmhmm.



A girl:
It's a dream...
 I'm dreaming...
 It's the same one I have everyday.
 And it never ends.

 Red snow...
 A world stained in red.
 A small child is crying, almost eclipsing the sunset.

 I wanted...
 I wanted at least to wipe away his tears.
 But my hands wouldn't leave my sides.
 And the tears streaming down his cheeks disappeared into the snow.
All I could do is watch...
It was so frustrating and sad.
"It'll be alright...
 Don't cry...
 I promise..."

 I can't help but wonder whose words those were?
 They seem too far away to be mine.
 The dream fades to a distinct color.
 It fades... to a promise.



Nayuki:
Where's my uniform?

Yuichi:
Where the heck am I?

Nayuki:
Oh no, I really don't have time for this! 

Nayuki:
 Uniform? Uniform...?
 Oh. Good morning, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
 Do you have to make such a ruckus this early?

Nayuki:
 No, no, that's not right.
 You're supposed to say "good morning" back to me, okay?

Yuichi:
 Fine.
 Good morning.

Nayuki:
 Perfect.
 Now, wasn't that much better?
 Oh! Yuichi, have you seen my uniform anywhere?

Yuichi:
 I thought Aunt Akiko said she was gonna wash it for you, didn't she?

Nayuki:
 Oh!

Yuichi:
 No big loss.
 It's the dorkiest uniform ever. 

Nayuki:
 It's not dorky!

Yuichi:
 Whatever, dork.

Nayuki:
 I found it.
 It was in the laundry like you said.

Yuichi:
 Glad I could be of some use.

Nayuki:
 It's still a bit damp, though.

Yuichi:
 Well then, why don't you put it under the kotatsu?
 That should dry it pretty quick-like.
 Uh... you know?

 Nayuki:
 But, if I put it under there it's gonna get all wrinkled, won't it?

 Yuichi:
 Smart people don't wear wet clothes.

 Nayuki:
 Well, I guess I'd rather be unwise than wrinkled.

 Yuichi:
 Aren't you still on winter break until tomorrow?

 Nayuki:

 I'm team captain, you know?

 Yuichi:
 Oh, yeah, you mentioned something about that yesterday.

 Nayuki:
 Yup, it's for the track team.

 Yuichi:
 So you're captain of the track team, are ya?

Nayuki:
 Yuck, it's more wet than I thought.

 Yuichi:
 Aren't you supposed to be there pretty soon?

 Nayuki:
 Mmhmm.
 I know, I know, I've gotta hurry up.

 Akiko:
 Nayuki!

 Yuichi:
 Huh?!

 Akiko:
 It's so late already.
 Are you sure you're going to make it on time?

 Nayuki:
 I will if I can do a hundred-meter dash in under seven seconds.

 Yuichi:
 It'd have to be a world record.

 Akiko:
 Be careful, honey.

 Yuichi:
 Can I ask what that's for?

 Akiko:
 What? This thing?

 Yuichi:
 Oh, I was thinking that... never mind.

 Nayuki:
 Alright, see you guys later!

 Yuichi:
 Hey, Nayuki!

 Nayuki:
 Huh?

 Yuichi:
 Can you maybe show me around town when you get back later?

 Nayuki:
 Mmhmm! 
I'd be happy to, if that's what you really wanna do.

 Yuichi:
 Yeah, I think I would.

 Nayuki:
 Then it's settled.
 I'll see you later.

 Akiko:
 Be sure to watch out for cars now.



Akiko:
It's hard work, isn't it?
 Feel free to take a break whenever you get too tired.

Yuichi:
Thanks.
 But I'm alright.

Akiko:
Can't tell you how nice it is to have a boy around.

Yuichi:
This is my mother's younger sister, Akiko Minase.
 She's Nayuki's mother.

Ah?
 Man, can that girl shovel some snow or what!



Yuichi:
I am wiped.

Akiko:
Thanks for the help today.

Yuichi:
Not sure how much help I was.
 I used to come here... to this town I mean... a lot when I was a kid.
 But the last time I saw Nayuki and Aunt Akiko was seven years ago.

Nayuki:
I'm back!
 So, Yuichi, are you ready for me to show you around the town?
 Um, is something wrong?

Yuichi:
No, I was just thinking you haven't changed a bit.

Nayuki:
Uhh... is that supposed to mean that you think I haven't grown up?

Yuichi:
Maybe.

Yuichi:
Sorry to drag you out again, especially when you just got home.

Nayuki:
I wanna help you get familiar with this place as soon as possible.
 After all, you're gonna be living here for a while, aren't you, Yuichi?
 Isn't that right?
 Maybe even forever?

Yuichi:
Oh, I don't know if I'd say I'll be here forever.
 But I will be here for some time.
 At least until I graduate from school.

Nayuki:
And this is gonna be your school.

Yuichi:
This used to be just a bunch of wheat fields, didn't it?

Nayuki:
Uh-huh.
 This one's the new building, and over there's the old one.

Yuichi:
Can't believe how many students are here over break.

Nayuki:
Well, there are all kinds of supplementary classes and club meetings.

Yuichi:
Well, I guess I'll be back here again tomorrow.

Sayuri:
 Hey, Mai!

Mai:
 Sayuri.

Sayuri:
 Sayuri's been looking everywhere for you.
 What have you been up to?
 You weren't trying to feed that dog again, were you?

Mai:
 I was only petting him.

Nayuki:
And that's the hospital.
 Well, I guess that was there the last time you were here.

Yuichi:
That's one place I hope I don't have to see too much of.

Nayuki:
So I guess you don't really like hospitals that much, huh?

Yuichi:
I doubt anybody's really all that wild about them.

Shirori's Mom:
Aren't you too cold, Shiori?

Shiori:
Oh, I'm fine.

Nayuki:
You don't think so?

Yuichi:
Sure is a whole lot busier than I remembered...

Nayuki:
Yeah.
 But I usually shop on the other side of town since this can be a little overwhelming.

Kaori:
Nayuki!

Nayuki:
Kaori! Hey, Kitagawa!

Yuichi:
Friends of yours?

Nayuki:
And my classmates.
 Kaori happens to be one of my favorite people at school.

Kitagawa:
What a coincidence!
 You guys are on a date, too?

Nayuki:
Uh...?

Kaori:
We are so not on a date!
 We just ran into each other a minute ago.

Kitagawa:
Then, how come you're making me carry all of your shopping bags for you, huh?

Nayuki:
Kaori, Kitagawa, this is my cousin. His name is Yuichi Aizawa.

Kaori:
I remember you talking about him.
 I'm Kaori Misaka, but you can call me Kaori, alright?

Kitagawa:
And I'm...

Yuichi:
I know, you're Kaori's servant, right?

Kitagawa:
Hey! Who are you callin' a servant, huh?

Kaori:
Make yourself useful and hold this for me for a sec.

Kitagawa:
Yes, ma'am.

Yuichi:
Oh, whoa man, this guy is pathetic.

Kitagawa:
You just watch it, man!
 If anything I'm Kaori's...

Kaori:
Oh, and this too.
 Here, to commemorate our new friendship!

Kitagawa:
Hey, I bought those sodas for us!

Kaori
Why would you be so stingy?

Kitagawa:
I'm warning you.
 You better keep your hands off Kaori or else I'm gonna...

Nayuki:
Kitagawa!

Kaori:
He and I are just classmates, okay?
 Well, I guess I'll see the two of you at school tomorrow morning, huh?

Nayuki:
I'll come by your locker before homeroom.

Kitagawa:
Kaori?
 Can't you at least say I'm one of your potential boyfriends or something?
 Kaori, wait!

Yuichi:
That funny little guy.

Nayuki:
They both sit next to me in class.
 That's how I met them.

Yuichi:
Hmm...

Nayuki:
Yuichi?

Yuichi:
Ah-ha...
 Uh... I kinda zoned out there.



Nayuki:
I guess this hill hasn't really changed at all, has it?

Yuichi:
No.

Nayuki:
Is something the matter?

Yuichi:
The longer we're out here the more I realize I don't remember.
 I feel like I've had a lot of experiences in this town, but I can't for the life of me recall what they were.
 I can't even figure out whether I liked this place or not.
 Maybe it's just 'cause... I was so young?
 But I keep thinking something familiar's gonna catch my eye.

Nayuki:
I'm sure it'll all start coming back to you eventually. Just be patient.
 You know... I really do love this town.
 I really hope someday you'll come to love it as much as I do.
 Look, it's a fox!
 Come over here, Mr. Fox!
 It's okay!
 We won't hurt you.
My poor little guy!
Come here!

Yuichi:
Don't do that!
 It's gonna bite you.
 I guess you still love animals as much as you used to.

Nayuki:
Don't be scared.
Who's a little boo?
 You are!
Oh...

Yuichi:
It's a wild animal, Nayuki.
 You can't really expect it to come when you call it.

Nayuki:
That might be true of regular foxes, but the foxes on this hill are completely different.
 There's even an old legend that tells of how special they are.

Yuichi:
Can you tell me how the legend goes?

Nayuki:
Of course, uh...
 Uhh... let's see... 
You know what? I can't remember.



Nayuki:
I need to pick up some things for dinner.

Yuichi:
Why don't I just hang out here?
 I think I'll probably get lost if I go inside.

Nayuki:
Oh, no you won't.
 After all, I'll be with you.

Yuichi:
I know you will, and that's what's making me worry.

Nayuki:
'Kay...
 I guess you can just stay here.
 Don't wander off on your own, you hear me?

Yuichi:
I wouldn't dream of it. I won't leave this spot. 

Nayuki:
Hmm...

Yuichi:
Hm?

Nayuki:
I was just remembering having the same conversation with you years ago.

Yuichi:
Whatever. Get going, will ya?

Yuichi:
Is she right?
 Did this whole scene already happen seven years ago?


Ayu:
Hey, look out!
 Outta my way!
 Outta my way!
 Move it!
 Uguu... That hurt.

Yuichi:
I'm sorry, but you were just coming so fast, I didn't have time to get out of the way.

Ayu:
I'm not that fast of a runner.

Yuichi:
Are you kidding?
 You looked pretty quick to me.

Ayu:
Uguu... Ah?
 Come with me.
 We'll discuss this later!

Yuichi:
Hey, hang on! Whoa!

Ayu:
In here, this looks good!
 This should be far enough away, don't you think?

Yuichi:
Far enough from what?
 What's going on?

Ayu:
The guy chasing me, that's what.

Yuichi:
Huh?

Ayu:
And now that you've been seen talking to me, I'm afraid you're in mortal danger too.

Waitress:
Hello, you two.
I can take your order if you're ready.

Ayu:
Shh!
 You crazy?

Waitress:
Whenever you're ready, Miss.

Yuichi:
Is that the guy who's chasing you?

Ayu:
Yes.

Yuichi:
Does it have anything to do with that paper bag you're carrying?

Ayu:
N-No.
 That doesn't have anything to do with it.

Yuichi:
That doesn't look like the kind of guy who would chase you for no reason.

Ayu:
Yeah, well you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, mister.

Yuichi:
Got any idea why he's wearing that apron?

Ayu:
Probably... because he owns a taiyaki shop?

Yuichi:
So, why would the owner of a taiyaki shop be chasing you?

Ayu:
Well, you see...
 There's this taiyaki shop that I think is the best. 
And everything was just fine till I put in a really huge order the other day...

Taiyaki Shop Owner:
Thanks, I hope you'll enjoy it.

Ayu:
Thanks! Ha Ha Ha.
 But then it was time to pay and I realized I couldn't find my wallet anywhere, and just as I was trying to figure out what I should do next, a kitty came along and messed everything up.

Taiyaki Shop Owner:
Hey, hey, hey! Get out of here! Come on!

Ayu:
Well, the owner's face looked so scary when he was yelling, and so I... I got really scared and ran away.

Yuichi:
Sounds to me like everything that's happened so far has been your fault then.

Ayu:
Uguu... Look, there's other circumstances and stuff, okay?

Yuichi:
Oh, yeah, like what?

Ayu:
It's a long story, I don't think you'd be interested.

Yuichi:
I got plenty of time. 

Ayu:
Well, it's kinda complicated, too.

Yuichi:
I can handle it.

Ayu:
Truth is... I was just really really hungry.

Yuichi:
Keep going.

Ayu:
That's it.

Yuichi:
That's your story?

Ayu:
That's it.
 Yeah.



Ayu:
Uguu!

Yuichi:
Quit squirming!
 All of this is your fault.

Ayu:
I was gonna pay him back tomorrow!
 I promise!

Yuichi:
It's not good enough!
 I'll put up the money, but you're going to apologize that guy right now!

 I'm really sorry about this...

Taiyaki Shop Owner:
Aw, it's okay...

 Ayu:
 I'm so glad he forgave me.
 It tastes so much better when it's fresh, don't you think?

 Yuichi:
 It's fattening.

 Ayu
 I don't care about silly stuff like that!

 Yuichi:
Well, in that case, I wanna see you finish every last one of those things.

 Ayu:
 Uguu...

 Yuichi:
 Uguu...

 Ayu:
 Hey, don't copy me!

 Yuichi:
Well, you said it all the time.
 I just wanted to try it.

 Ayu:
 Uguu, I did not say it all the time!

 Yuichi:
 What's with the wings on your back?

 Ayu:
 What wings?
 What are you talking about?

 Yuichi:
 The ones on your back.

 Ayu:
 On my back?
 Uguu, I can't see my back!

 Yuichi:
Well, maybe if you stood still and just tried turning your head?

 Ayu:
 Hey, you're right!
 I have wings!
 Super-cute little wings!
 I have wings!

 Yuichi:
 You know what?
 I think I'm starting to understand the vibe I'm getting from you.
 You're just a weirdo, aren't you?

 Ayu:
 Uguu, I AM NOT A WEIRDO!

So this is goodbye.
 I hope I see you around sometime.

Yuichi:
So do I.
 And next time I see you, you better pay me back.

Ayu:
My name's Ayu Tsukimiya.
 What about you?

Yuichi:
I'm Yuichi Aizawa.

Ayu:
Huh? Yuichi? Uh...

Yuichi:
What's wrong?

Ayu:
Uh, oh, nothing.
 I just hope we meet again.
 There's nothing to worry about.

Yuichi:
Are you sure?

Ayu:
Of course I'm sure!
 You know, I'm not gonna pay you back if you don't believe me!

Yuichi:
Okay, okay, okay...

Ayu:
Then it's settled. 
I'll see you later.
It'll be real nice!

Yuichi:
Uh...

Ayu:
Are you okay?

Yuichi:
Uh, yeah, I'm fine...

Ayu:
See you later then!

Yuichi:
Oh, no!
 Oh man! Oh man! Oh man! Oh man...!

How's it going?

Nayuki:
You lied to me.



Yuichi:
Nayuki, I'm really sorry.
 Come on, I've been apologizing over and over.

Nayuki:
I've waited more than thirty minutes.

Akiko:
Now, now.
 Don't fight you two.

Yuichi:
Uh, okay.
 Well, Nayuki.

Nayuki:
Huh...
 All right.
 Guess I was pretty late picking you up yesterday.
 Now we're even.

Looks like they finally delivered all your stuff.

Yuichi:
I don't think I can put it all away tonight
 But in the meantime I really do need an alarm clock.

Nayuki:
I can lend you one of mine. I mean, if you don't wanna go through your boxes.

Yuichi:
Yeah.
 That'd be great.

Nayuki:
How many do you want?

Yuichi:
One should be fine.

Nayuki:
You can borrow whichever one you want.

Yuichi:
Is this hobby of yours or something?

Nayuki:
Uh-uh.
 I wouldn't call it a hobby.
 I think this would be the perfect one for you.
 Here!

Yuichi:
Uh, thank you.

Nayuki:
Hm.

Yuichi:
See you later.

Nayuki:
Yuichi...
 At bed time, it's customary to say, "good night."

Yuichi:
Yeah, good night.

Nayuki:
Mm.

Yuichi:
A brand-new life in a brand-new town...
 Well, sorta. Confusing end to my first day...
And right as I started to drift off, I see an image of a girl running.
 And without ever remembering who she is, I fall into a deep sleep, somehow nostalgic...



Nayuki:
Let's go now... 
Come on, let's go!

Yuichi:
Uh.

Nayuki:
If we don't hurry up, it's gonna be too dark to go.

Yuichi:
Where are we suppose to go again?

Nayuki:
Mom asked me to go the grocery store for her, remember?
 And you promised you would help me carry the bags for me, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
No way.
 It's too cold.

Nayuki:
You can't break a pinky-swear!
 If you break it, you're gonna have to swallow a thousand hundred needles.

Nayuki:
Don't you wanna come with me?

Yuichi:
I think I'll wait out here.
 I'll probably just get lost inside.

Nayuki:
You wouldn't get lost because I'll be with you silly-head.

Yuichi:
I know you'll be with me.
 That's what makes me nervous.

Nayuki:
Then I guess I'll go by myself.
 Wait right here for me, 'kay?
 Promise me you'll stay here.

Ayu:
Uguu!

Yuichi:
What's wrong?
 What are you crying for?
 Um, just calm down.
 What's your name?

Ayu:
Uguu...

Yuichi:
My name's Yuichi Aizawa.

Ayu:
I-I'm Ayu...

Yuichi:
And your last name?

Ayu:
A-Ayu...

Yuichi:
So your last name's Ayu too?
 Hm?

Man:
What did he do to her?

Woman:
Has he learned from you that poor girl [manners]?

Man:
Unbelievable, where are these kids' parents?

Yuichi:
Uhh... Nothing to see here.
 Let's go some place else.
 Come with me, Ayu Ayu.

Ayu:
That isn't my name!
