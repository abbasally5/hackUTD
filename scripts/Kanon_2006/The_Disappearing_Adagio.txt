  Ayu:
Winter break is going to be over soon, isn't it?

Yuichi:
Yeah, I guess so.

Ayu:
That means you're leaving?

Yuichi:
Well, I have school, you know.

Ayu:
You come back again next year though, won't you?

Yuichi:
Yeah, I'm sure I will.

Ayu:
Will you promise me?

Yuichi:
Pinky swear!
 Now I have to come back, so don't worry.

Ayu:
You mean it?

Yuichi:
Yeah, of course I mean it.

Ayu:
Aha.

Yuichi:
You know that doll I gave you earlier?

Ayu:
This one?

Yuichi:
That's right.
 Well, actually it's no ordinary doll.
 It's a magical doll that grants wishes whoever owns it at the time.
 You didn't believe me, did you?

Ayu:
I did.

Yuichi:
But I swear it's all true.

Ayu:
For real?

Yuichi:
Just so you don't get your hopes up.
 It can only grant three wishes.
 And of course, you can't pull that trick where you wish more wishes, so don't try it.
 I mean, put yourself in the shoes of the wish granter.

Ayu:
Who's the one who's gonna grant my wishes.

Yuichi:
That's me.

Ayu:
Oh, I see.

Yuichi:
So, you can't really ask for things that I wouldn't be able to do.
 And just so you know, I don't have much money either.

Ayu:
Ha ha ha.

Yuichi:
Okay, tell me what you want your first wish to be .

Ayu:
My first wish... is that you never forget about me.
 When winter break is over... and you go back to your hometown, I want you to think of me every now and then.
 And think, "Oh yeah, I met a weird girl in that town.
 It's [ ] then.‚Äù That's all you remember.
 Just think, "Now and then, about that crazy girl who lives in that town that's up on the hills where it snows all the time.
 Or you don't have to remember about the snow on the hills, just remember me.

 What do you think?
 Was that okay?

Yuichi:
Hm, like I said, if it's possible for me to do, then your wish is my command.
 That's a promise.
 So, don't worry I'm not gonna forget about you and I'm gonna be back on my next school break.
 And when I'm back, you and I are gonna go eat some taiyaki.

Ayu:
Okay.

Yuichi:
And next time, the taiyaki will be on me.

Ayu:
Yeah, that sounds good.


Ayu:
Yuichi!

Yuichi:
What, Ayu?

Ayu:
You're gonna catch a cold.

Yuichi:
I don't care if I do.

Ayu:
Started snowing again, huh?

Yuichi:
Yeah.

Ayu:
Are you just out here thinking about Shiori?

Yuichi:
So, you know about how sick she is?

Ayu:
Yeah, Nayuki told me and she said that she found out about it from Kaori.

Yuichi:
I see...


Ayu:
Is Shiori's illness really that serious?

Yuichi:
To tell you the truth, I don't know that much about it either.
 But I know she's not allowed to go outside for a while.

Ayu:
Well then, I hope she starts to get better soon.
 I wish there was something that I could do for her.
 I'd like to help.
 I'd like to help her just like you helped me when I was crying, and you cheered me up.

Yuichi:
I didn't do anything all that special, Ayu.

Ayu:
That isn't true, Yuichi.
 If you hadn't been there, when I was so depressed and hopeless, I don't think I would've ever smiled again.
 So, please don't think you didn't help me, okay?
 You really made me feel better and you gave me this headband.

Yuichi:
I did?

Ayu:
Of course, it was right before you left to go back home.

Yuichi:
So, I was into giving girls headbands when I was ten years old?

Ayu:
Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Hm?

Ayu:
You wouldn't happen to remember anything about the day you gave me this, would you?

Yuichi:
No, I'm sorry.

Ayu:
Don't worry, I don't remember it either.
 I was just hoping maybe you would remember it.
 We should probably go back inside.
 We have to get up bright and early to cheer for Nayuki at meet.

Yuichi:
Yeah, I guess you're right.

Ayu:
You know, I sure hope it's sunny tomorrow.

Yuichi:
Yeah.

Akiko:
Nayuki!

Ayu:
Hey, Nayuki!

Nayuki:
Hey, guys, I can't believe you all came!

Ayu:
We had to come for good luck.

Kitagawa:
I'll follow you on my bike so you'll hear me cheering in the entire race.

Nayuki:
Mmhmm, that sounds so great.

Yuichi:
You seem pretty relaxed.
 Aren't you nervous being the anchor?

Nayuki:
What on earth would be the use in getting nervous now?
 This is where all the practice is gonna pay off.
 I am so exited!

Akiko:
Do you know what the standings are right now?

Nayuki:
So far we're in the leading group, but you'd never know.

Ayu:
I just know you're gonna do great, Nayuki.

Nayuki:
I'd better get closer to the starting line.
 See you later!

Yuichi:
See you after you win!

Ayu:
Look, Yuichi,
 I bet we can see way better from over there.
 Come on! Let's go!

Yuichi:
Okay, okay...

Kitagawa:
Nayuki!

Nayuki:
Hm?

Kitagawa:
It's all you.
 If you win, it will help both Kaori and that idiot cousin of yours find something to smile about.

Nayuki:
Right. I'll do the best I can.

Ayu:
I'm so nervous.
 Nayuki is gonna do okay, isn't she?
 She'll win, right?

Yuichi:
I don't know.
 She seemed a little bit too relaxed to get out there and be competitive.

Ayu:
That's a lie!
 You know it!
 Nayuki's gonna win!
 Just you wait and see!

Yuichi:
Hey, aren't you the one who was all nervous about her in the first place?

Ayu:
Ah, Uguu...
 Well, yeah, but...

Kitagawa:
Hey, I know you like 'em young, but come on, (you know) an elementary school girl?
 That's all kinds of trouble.
 You're sicko.

Ayu:
Kitagawa!
 You know very well Yuichi and I are the same age as you, so shut up!

Kitagawa:
Whaaatt?!

Ayu:
Don't be a drama queen!

Kitagawa:
You really in a high school?
 Where do you go?

Ayu:
It's on the west side of town in the forest.

Yuichi:
It's the kind of school where students can just come and go as they please.

Ayu:
And we never have homework and we eat taiyaki for lunch everyday.

Kitagawa:
I wanna go to that school.

Yuichi:
Keep in mind she's crazy.

Akiko:
Oh, here they come.

Kitagawa:
Two... Three... Four...
 We're in seventh place?

Yuichi:
We've really fallen back, haven't we?

Ayu:
All right, Nayuki, you can do it!

Girl:
Nayuki, sorry!

Nayuki:
I'll take care of it.

Yuichi:
Wow, she's fast!

Ayu:
I had no idea that Nayuki can run like that.

Kitagawa:
Are you kidding?
 Nayuki is like a celeb in the world of women's high school track and field.

Ayu:
That is so cool.

Yuichi:
She's awesome.

Akiko:
It looks like she's really in top form today, don't you think?

Ayu:
Oh, wow, she's passing another one!

Yuichi:
Kitagawa, I'm taking your bike!

Kitagawa:
Hey, Yuichi, get back here!

Nayuki:
Can I catch her?

Yuichi:
Nayuki! Nayuki!
 You can do it!
 You can totally catch her!

Nayuki:
Yeah.


Principal:
In the long history of our girls' track team, this is the first time that they've ever won the national championship three years in a row.

Yuichi:
And now, in honor of Nayuki's great performance.
 Cheers!

Nayuki:
Thank you, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
You caused quite a stir, didn't you?
 But then again, you did set a new school record for the last leg.

Nayuki:
A record is good or not, but in the end of the day, I'm just happy that our school won the meet.

Yuichi:
I bet Kaori was really excited when you told her.

Nayuki:
Yeah.
 I called her and she sounded happy.
 She said she was sorry she couldn't be there to cheer us on.

Yuichi:
She should be.

Nayuki:
So, Yuichi, are you finally used to living in this town?

Yuichi:
Where did that come from?

Nayuki:
Well, when you first got here, you said that you really didn't like the cold.
 Does it not bother you as much as it did?

Yuichi:
Of course it bothers me.
 I don't complain about it anymore, but it's still way colder than it needs to be.

Nayuki:
I guess so.
 But still I really like it here so I hope it's starting to grow on you a bit.
 And I hated if you weren't happy here, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Nayuki, aren't there any guys you gotta crush on?
 Kitagawa tells me you're a pretty popular girl.
 I hear the guys like you a lot.
 The underclassmen girls too.
 Pretty much everyone in school thinks you're quite a catch.

Nayuki:
Oh... There was a boy I used to like.
 But that was a long time ago.

Yuichi:
How long ago exactly?

Nayuki:
Oh, it was back in grade school.
 He didn't feel the same way.

Yuichi:
And you haven't seen him since then?

Nayuki:
I think he's totally forgotten about it.
 But it can't be helped.
 He liked somebody else, and that was that.

Yuichi:
But all of this was in grade school, right.
 I mean, maybe his feelings have changed since then.

Nayuki:
No, they haven't.
 I'm sure of it, today as I was then, she's the only girl he's ever had his eyes for.
 It's just the way things go.

Yuichi:
He's pretty persistent then, huh?

Nayuki:
He's just dedicated.
 He can be kind of jerk sometimes when he sees someone in trouble, he's the first one to help.
 But I don't think he knows just how much he helps people.

Yuichi:
That guy sounds like you'd ever have a constant source of worries.

Nayuki:
Yeah. You can sure say that again.


Yuichi:
What do you say if I buy you a present to celebrate your amazing come-from-behind victory?

Nayuki:
Seriously?

Yuichi:
Yeah. But I don't have a lot of money right now.
 I had to pay for a whole lot of stuff over the past few weeks or so.

Nayuki:
Umm... well, in that case...

Yuichi:
Huh?

Nayuki:
This is it.
 This is what I want.

Yuichi:
I'm not that broke, Nayuki.
 I can buy you something a little bit nicer than that, you know.

Nayuki:
Uh-uh.
 This is what I want.
 Look, it's so pretty.
 The color reminds me of strawberries.

Nayuki:
It really is beautiful.

Yuichi:
You're strange one, Nayuki.
 Do you know that?
 You and Ayu are two peas in a pod.

Nayuki:
Hey, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Hm?

Nayuki:
Don't give Ayu too much trouble.
 You should try to be a little nicer to her.

Yuichi:
Oh, come on, you've seen her.
 If anything, she's the one who gives me trouble.

Nayuki:
You don't understand.
 I'm telling you something important.
 You see, Ayu is...

Yuichi:
Go on, Ayu is what?

Nayuki:
I can't say.

Yuichi:
One hint.

Nayuki:
The hint is there's no use telling you because you wouldn't believe it.

Yuichi:
Another hint.

Nayuki:
No way.
 You only get one hint from me.

Yuichi:
A bonus chance, huh?

Nayuki:
I'm not giving those.

Yuichi:
Special chance?

Nayuki:
What is that?

Yuichi:
Mega chance!

Nayuki:
Now you're just making stuff up, Yuichi.

Ayu:
You know, you're really late, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Sorry, were you waiting long?

Ayu:
I was worried maybe you wouldn't be able to come today.

Yuichi:
You and me both.
 I wasn't sure I'd be able to make it either.
 I'm sorry I always make you wait, Ayu.

Ayu:
Well, you're here.
 So, then...
 Here! This is for you!
 I baked some cookies!

Yuichi:
Wow, you made this for me?!
 Thanks!

Yuichi:
Uh...

Ayu:
I should've warned you.
 They didn't turn out as pretty as I wanted.

Ayu:
So, uh...

Yuichi:
Delicious.

Ayu:
Oh, good!


Ayu:
Hey, how much further do we have to go?

Yuichi:
Just a bit more.
 Look! You can see it now.

Ayu:
Ahh!

Yuichi:
Isn't it awesome?
 This is my special place, you know.

Ayu:
It's so pretty.

Yuichi:
Aren't you glad you came now?

Ayu:
Yeah!

Ayu:
Hey, Yuichi.
 Do you think maybe you could turn around for just a second?

Yuichi:
Turn around for what?

Ayu:
Because I ask you to do.
 And don't turn back around until I tell you, all right?

Yuichi:
Just say when.

Ayu:
Okay, turn around!

Yuichi:
Huh...
 Ah!

Ayu:
Oh, wow, the whole town's bright red!

Yuichi:
What do you think you're doing?
 Get down before you kill yourself!

Ayu:
I'm fine!
 I'm a really good tree-climber, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Well, I'm not fine with you being up there!
 I don't like high places that make me too nervous.

Ayu:
But you're not the one who's up here, silly.

Yuichi:
I know, but I'm getting freaked out just looking at you up there.

Ayu:
Oh, the breeze feels so nice.
 It's such a pretty town.
 It really is.

Ayu:
Thank you for bringing me up here.

Yuichi:
I don't get how come you wanted me to turn around, though.

Ayu:
Ah, well, I... um...

Yuichi:
See you tomorrow, okay?

Ayu:
We only have a few more days to see each other before you go home.

Yuichi:
No, we don't, silly.
 We only have two days.
 I go home the day after tomorrow.

Ayu:
Hmm...

Yuichi:
I'll meet you here again in the morning.

Ayu:
Uh-huh.
 I'm gonna be waiting for you right here on this bench.


Ayu:
Hey, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Hm?

Ayu:
Here we are again, huh?

Yuichi:
You wouldn't happen to be spying on me by any chance, would you?

Ayu:
Of course not.
 I had a dream and I thought I'd come out here until I was tired again.

Yuichi:
What a coincidence.
 I had a dream too.

Ayu:
What kind of dream?

Yuichi:
Can't remember.

Ayu:
Wouldn't it be cool if we both had the same dream?

Yuichi:
I don't think that's possible.
 Hm? Hey...

Ayu:
What?

Yuichi:
How much do you remember about spending time with me while we were kids.

Ayu:
Hmm...
 Bits and pieces.
 The only thing I remember clearly is that we saw each other every day.

Yuichi:
You sure have a bad memory, don't you?

Ayu:
Uguu...
 Well, do you remember anything else then?

Yuichi:
No, I don't remember much more than that either.
 I could remember both Makoto and Mai eventually.
 But I don't know why.

Ayu:
Can't be helped.
 After all, that was seven years ago.
 But still, even after seven years, I still have my headband and you're still with me.
 The two of us together just like we were back then.
 That's pretty incredible, don't you think so?

Yuichi:
You really think that's incredible?

Ayu:
Mmhmm.
 It's a miracle in my book.


Yuichi:
Good morning, everybody.

Ayu:
Good morning to you, Yuichi.

Akiko:
And how are you doing on this fine fine morning.

Nayuki:
Good morning...
 There's a little puppy in the mailbox...

Akiko:
All right, go and wash your face, Nayuki.
 And you'd better hurry or you'll be late for school.

Yuichi:
Try not to drown.

Nayuki:
Okay, I'll be careful...

Akiko:
She seems so much more relaxed, now that the meet is over, doesn't she?

Yuichi:
She seems exactly the same as she always does to me.

Ayu:
I know.
 I'm gonna make some toast for Nayuki before she comes back.

Yuichi:
How can you be so cheerful all the time?

Akiko:
Nayuki, is something wrong?

Nayuki:
I... almost drowned myself.

Yuichi:
Stupid yet [queen].


Kitagawa:
How come it's just the two of us eating lunch down here today?

Yuichi:
I'm your only one who could make it.
 Kaori's absent again and Nayuki's eating with her team.

Kitagawa:
It's pretty roomy around here without the ladies.
 And as for Shiori, I heard that her condition is stabilized.

Yuichi:
You did?


Nayuki:
Yuichi...

Yuichi:
Huh?

Nayuki:
The final bell just rang.

Yuichi:
Oh...

Ayu:
Hey, Yuichi!

Yuichi:
Hey, Ayu.
 Whacha doing?

Ayu:
You didn't seem particularly surprised.

Yuichi:
Must've finally gotten used to it.
 Surprise attacks just don't surprise me like it used to.

Ayu:
Yuichi, don't call them attacks!
 Hey, a question!
 Do you remember that bench over there?

Yuichi:
That's where I waited two hours for Nayuki the first day I got back here.

Ayu:
That bench is where you and I would always meet seven years ago.
 I always got to the bench first so I would sit and wait.
 Most of the time I'd be sitting here waiting for a really long time before you came.
 Yuichi, you're late again!

Yuichi:
Sorry, I hope I didn't keep you waiting too long.

Ayu:
How could a person be late every single day?
 Is something wrong?

Yuichi:
Oh, nothing, it's nothing really.
 By the way, you're looking for something, right?
 Did you ever find it?

Ayu:
No, I haven't yet.

Yuichi:
It'd probably be helpful if you could find a clue or something.
 I can look with you if you want me to.

Ayu:
You mean you... you came all the way out here just to help me?

Yuichi:

 There's no way in the world I'm that considerate--you and I both know it.
 So, where do you wanna start looking?

Ayu:
Well, I think I know a place.


Ayu:
I can't believe I still can't find it.

Yuichi:
Don't be so sad, Ayu.
You can start looking for it again tomorrow.

Ayu:
I'm sorry.
 This must be frustrating.

Yuichi:
Well, it's... not like I had anything else to do.

Ayu:
Sitting here like this reminds me of that day a long time ago.
 I just lost my mom and I was... I was sitting here crying all by myself.
 And then you came up and started talking to me, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Yeah, I remember all of that.

Ayu:
Hey, Yuichi.
 Have you ever watched someone who is really important to you waste away?
 I have.
 It was awful.
 There was nothing that I could do to help.
 I was only a kid, so all I could do was call my mother's name... over and over and over again.
 I just kept saying until my voice was hoarse.
 It was a terrible time, a lonely time.
 My mother couldn't help me, and I couldn't help her no matter how much we love each other.
 I can't go through anything like that again.
 You know what I mean?
 Have you ever been through something like that?

Yuichi:
Well, I...

 Ayu...

Ayu:
Hm?

Yuichi:
Shiori... Are you saying Shiori has...

Ayu:
Yuichi!
 What's the matter with you, Yuichi?
 Yuichi!

Yuichi:
Sorry about that.
 I think I'm okay again.

Ayu:
So, you've experienced it too then.
 Having to watch someone you care about disappear right before your eyes...

Ayu:
Can I ask you?
 Please don't look at my face right now.
 I bet it's probably just a mess from crying.
 Close your eyes.
 Will you do that, please?

Yuichi:
S-Sure.

Ayu:
And I'll... I'll close my eyes too.
