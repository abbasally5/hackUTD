  Ayu:
Then I guess I'm going to have to make my second wish.
 Just for one day, I think, I'd like to go to school with you.
 We can make this clearing our very own school.
 Then you and I can study stuff together, and eat some lunch together, and clean up our workspace together.
 And then at the end of the day, we'll walk home together too.
 Is it okay if I make a wish like that?

Yuichi:
I promised you, didn't I?
 I told you I'd grant any wishes as long as I can make it happen.
 This place will be our school from now on.
 It'll be the best school ever, really relaxed with no rules and no uniforms.

Ayu:
What about homework?

Yuichi:
None of that either.

Ayu:
And tests?

Yuichi:
What in the world is the test.
 You don't even have to show up if you don't want to.
 You can skip school when you want to and come and go as you please.

Ayu:
That sounds wonderful!
 But let me just add one thing.
 Every day for lunch, we get as much taiyaki as we want.

Yuichi:
Nothing but taiyaki every day?

Ayu:
Yup, taiyaki every day!

Yuichi:
Yeah, I'm not so sure about that one.

Ayu:
It has to be served every single day!

Yuichi:
So, uh, we should meet at the school again.

Ayu:
You mean here?

Yuichi:
Yeah, the next time I come back to town and visit my aunt.

Ayu:
The school in the clearing will be our meeting place.

Yuichi:
Yeah, that's what I was saying.

Ayu:
Mmhmm. So that's a promise, right?



Clock:
Meow. Good morning, sleepy-head!
It's time to eat breakfast.
And it's time to go to school today, wake...

Ayu:
I'm sorry, Yuichi.
 I don't think we'll ever be able to meet again.


Akiko:
I was wondering when you'd be down.

Nayuki:
'Morning.

Yuichi:
Wow, you're up early again today.

Nayuki:
Ayu didn't happen to come back last night, did she?

Yuichi:
No.

Nayuki:
I wonder where she is.
 Do you think maybe she went back to her own house?

Akiko:
Yuichi, dear, you know, if you're not feeling well today, it's all right if you stay home.

Yuichi:
Hm...



Teacher:
In other words, in the many-worlds interpretation, the live cat and dead cat are believed to exist at the same time.

Nayuki:
Isn't there a way you can get in contact with her?

Yuichi:
Huh?

Nayuki:
I'm talking about Ayu.
 Don't you have her address or phone number?

Yuichi:
I never asked her for that.
 All I really know about her is her name.

Nayuki:
Yuichi, you've gotta try to eat something.
 You hardly touched breakfast this morning.

Yuichi:
I guess I'm just not hungry.

Nayuki:
Then I guess you... you really must like Ayu a lot then, huh.

Yuichi:
Sorry, did you say something?

Nayuki:
Uh-uh. It wasn't important.

Ayu:
You are always late, Yuichi!

Nayuki:
Yuichi!
 Have you found Ayu yet?

Yuichi:
No. I thought she might show up if I waited for her here.

Nayuki:
By that bench? What for?

Yuichi:
This bench was where we'd meet up after school ever since we were little kids.

Nayuki:
I see.

Nayuki:
I asked around school just to see if I can find anything out.
 It was weird no one I talked to ever heard of a school in the woods.

Yuichi:
I guess not.

Nayuki:
Did Ayu ever say she found what she was looking for?

Yuichi:
No.
 Now that I think about it, everything seems so strange.
 The clearing in the forest...
 The lost thing she's looking for...
 And then... why can I remember what happened here seven years ago.

Nayuki:
Look, everything's gonna be just fine.

Yuichi:
Huh?

Nayuki:
You still have her backpack, right?
 I'm sure she'll have to come back for it sometime.
 I mean, it was her favorite thing, wasn't it?

Yuichi:
I guess you might be right.

Nayuki:
Mmhmm.
 Excuse me, we'd like a couple of strawberry sundaes when you can.

Yuichi:
Uh...

Waitress:
Right, that's two strawberry sundaes.
I'll get that right out for you guys, okay?

Nayuki:
Trust me, you'll feel better after you eat some ice cream.
 Try to keep your chin up, okay?!



Nayuki:
We're home, Mom.

Akiko:
Welcome back, kids.

Yuichi:
Have you heard from Ayu?
 Has she called or come by or anything?

Akiko:
No, nothing yet.

Yuichi:
I understand.

Akiko:
Huh...
 Looks like it's up to us to try and cheer him up.
 Because that's what families do, Nayuki.
 They look out for each other, right?

Nayuki:
Mmhmm.
 You're so right.
 That's exactly how a family's supposed to act.

Yuichi:
I guess it was dumb to hope there would be any clues in here.
 Huh...
 Who are you...?

Nayuki:
Yuichi, have you finished your homework yet?

Yuichi:
Hmm?

Nayuki:
This way, we can divide the work.
 It'll cut the time I spend doing homework in half.

Yuichi:
So, you really just wanna make life easier for yourself.

Nayuki:
Please, do you really wanna do it by yourself?

Yuichi:
Okay, how do you suggest we split all these things up?

Nayuki:
Er, well, let's see...

Yuichi:
Wake up!
 Come on, Nayuki, you're the one who wanted to work together and you fall asleep right after we start.

Nayuki:
But I can't help it if I'm so sleepy.

Yuichi:
You just need to get fired up!

Nayuki:
Uh, fired up!
 That's all...
 Remember when you came to visit seven years ago, we did our homework together just like this?

Yuichi:
Huh?

Nayuki:
I guess not.
 I didn't think you would remember.

Yuichi:
I'm sorry.

Nayuki:
Oh, no, don't be sorry.
 I shouldn't have even brought it up.

Yuichi:
Come on, I told you I was sorry, didn't I?

Nayuki:
Huh? What?

Yuichi:
You were all quiet and you did something weird to my leg.

Nayuki:
I never did anything to your leg.

Yuichi:
Ha ha ha!

Nayuki:
What's going on?

Yuichi:
When did you get in here, mister?

Nayuki:
Ah! Piro, Piro, Ah! [Would you] Piro.

Yuichi:
Okay, all done.
 Nayuki, if you're going to sleep, you might as well get in the bed.
 Nayuki, seriously.
 Fine, sleep on the floor then.

Thanks, Nayuki.
 You help me clear my mind.



Ayu:
Yuichi, it's totally dark.
 Uguu... I'm really scared.

Yuichi:
Don't be scared, Ayu.
 I'm here with you, aren't I?

Ayu:
Yeah.

Yuichi:
There will be more light once we get out of the forest.
 So, just hang on.

Ayu:
But this is not a forest, it's our school.

Yuichi:
Oh, yeah.

Ayu:
Promise you're not gonna let go of my hand.

Yuichi:
Sure, promise I'm gonna hold on tight.

Ayu:
Where are we, Yuichi?

Yuichi:
It looks like we're out of the forest for now.

Ayu:
But I don't recognize this area at all.

Yuichi:
Stop worrying.
 As long as we're out of the forest, I can figure out how to get home.

Ayu:
Sure.
 Ah!

Yuichi:
Huh?
 Did you find something?

Ayu:
Uh-huh.
 Oh, wow.
 Hey, Yuichi, have you ever heard of a time capsule?

Yuichi:
Yeah, you put lots of stuff in it and people dig it up later.

Ayu:
I think we should make one with this!
 Here.

Yuichi:
And what kind of stuff will you put inside of it?

Ayu:
My angel!
 You don't mind, do you?

Yuichi:
Do whatever you want.
 You still have one wish left, you know.

Ayu:
You've already granted me two wishes, that's more than I thought I'd get.
 I think that I should just leave the last one.
 That way, the future me or whoever else finds it can use the wish if they need it.

Yuichi:
But, wait!
 I'll still be the one who's granting the wish, right?

Ayu:
Then you'd better work hard, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
How will anybody find it if we don't leave any markers?

Ayu:
I'm sure someone will find it.
 As long as there's someone who needs this doll to grant a wish for them, they'll find it.

Then I'll see you at school, till tomorrow.

Yuichi:
At school?

Ayu:
Well, we have to have a farewell party for you, Yuichi, since you're transferring, y'know.

Yuichi:
Right.
 See you at school tomorrow.

Ayu:
Pinky swear on it?

Yuichi and Ayu:
Pinky swear!



Akiko:
You should hurry up and change.
 You don't wanna be late, do you?

Nayuki:
I think I'll just stay here [ ] today.

Yuichi:
I don't think that's a very good idea.

Nayuki:
Um, but this is my favorite robe in the world, that's just so comfy.
 I even named all of the little kitties like "Strawberry."
 And this one's name is "Melon."
 This little kitty almost falling from the edge of my sleeve is "Grape."
 And this one here is "Kiwi."

Yuichi:
You named all of the cat heads on your bathrobe?

Nayuki:
Mmhmm.

Yuichi:
Hey, I [needed] to ask you.
 Do you mind if I change the messages on the alarm clock?

Nayuki:
You can't do that.
 I did a funny little voice on every thing.

Yuichi:
What's hard about talking into a microphone?

Nayuki:
If you were bad at machine design and you'd understand.
 I mean I got so confused doing it.
 I thought [I'd tried] everything, Mom had to help me in the end.

Yuichi:
Life sure hasn't been easy for aunt Akiko.
 Taking care of you all these years without anyone to help her out.

Nayuki:
Yeah, and I try to show her how grateful I am for everything she does.
 I love my mom.

Yuichi:
So there's been just the two of you in that house, huh?

Nayuki:
Mmhmm.
 But still I've never felt like we're missing anything.

Yuichi:
Is that so?

Nayuki:
Although, I hope Ayu comes back soon.
 Uh... Is that a bunny?

Yuichi:
A bunny?

Nayuki:
I wonder who made this little guy.

Yuichi:
Come on.
 We're going to be late.

Nayuki:
But I... feel so sorry for it.

Yuichi:
All right, I hear you.

Nayuki:
There, it's done.
 But I never could find one of its eyes.
 I know, Yuichi, um...
 How is this?
 You think this'll work?

Yuichi:
You've been carrying that around all this time?

Nayuki:
Mmhmm.
 I keep it with me because it was a gift from you.
 And even though it's really precious to me.

Yuichi:
Go ahead and use it.
 I can see you wouldn't be satisfied until it's finished, isn't that right?

Nayuki:
Mmhmm.
 Thanks for understanding.
 It's not quite the same size though.

Yuichi:
Well, it's just gonna have to live with it.

Nayuki:
I guess you're right.
 Hey, Yuichi.
 A snow bunny doesn't remind you of anything in particular, does it?

Yuichi:
Actually it does remind me of something.
 Somebody who made a bunch of snow animals for her sick mother.

Nayuki:
Who is this person?

Yuichi:
Uh, this is a girl I knew.
 Her mom was too weak to go to the zoo, so my friend, when she was a little girl, decided that she would bring the zoo to her mom by making a bunch of snow bunnies.

Nayuki:
What ended up happening to your friend and her mom?

Yuichi:
Oh, they were doing fine.
 The mother got better after a while.
 Both mother and daughter are living happily ever after.

Nayuki:
I see.
 It almost sounds like you're talking about Mom and me.

Yuichi:
So did the bunny remind you of something too?

Nayuki:
It's nothing.
 It's really not important.
 Hurry up!
 We're gonna be late!


Kitagawa:
So you really think it might be buried out here?
What it is that Ayu's looking for?

Yuichi:
Yeah, I think so.
 The last time I saw her, she was digging all over the place out here.

Kitagawa:
Oh, not like I care.
Didn't have anything better to do.

Yuichi:
Thanks, man, I owe you one.

Nayuki:
Uh... it's not here.

Kitagawa:
You know, the search will probably go a lot faster if we had more help.

Nayuki:
Something we can do.
 I wouldn't dream of asking Kaori with all she's got going on.

Nayuki:
Ah?!

Yuichi:
What's the matter?

Nayuki:
I don't suppose this is what we're looking for.

Nayuki:
We'd better fill these holes up or we're gonna get in trouble.

Kitagawa:
I'm starting to wonder if someone already dug the thing up.

Yuichi:
I guess that's a possibility.

Nayuki:
But it's also possible that it's still somewhere out here, right?
 So we can't stop looking.

Kitagawa:
Mmhmm.

Nayuki:
Keep digging, guys, okay?!

Yuichi:
You're right.

Kitagawa:
Hey, I found something.

Yuichi:
Uh...
 This is it.
 I can't believe it!
 This is really it!



Yuichi:
Sorry for asking you to do this.

Nayuki:
Uh-uh.
 This is just about the only thing I can do.
 I'm happy to help.
 Here, she's done.
 But there's still a little bit dirt on her.

Yuichi:
Thanks.
 You did an awesome job.

Nayuki:
So, tell me, do you think this little doll's really gonna help you find Ayu?

Yuichi:
Mm...

Yuichi:
I sure used a lot of your time and energy today.

Nayuki:
That's okay.
 I had a lot of fun helping you out.

Yuichi:
Thanks.
 Can I ask you something?

Nayuki:
Hm?

Yuichi:
 Did you change your hairstyle recently?

Nayuki:
Uh, no.
 My hair's always been just like this.

Yuichi:
No, I distinctly remember you wearing it in braids, maybe in grade school, right?

Nayuki:
Uh-huh.
 I did a braids.
 But I stopped wearing them after a year or so.

Yuichi:
Why did you do that?

Nayuki:
Um, you know I don't remember why...



Nayuki:
Good morning, sleepy-head.
 It's time to eat breakfast and it's time to go to school today.

Yuichi:
Uh...

Nayuki:
Yuichi, it's time to get up and go to school.

Yuichi:
Is this a dream?

Nayuki:
You're not dreaming, you're late!
 Now hurry up and get dressed!

Yuichi:
Hmm... There's no possible way you could've woken up before I did.
 Are you messing with me?

Nayuki:
You know, that was a really rude thing to say.

Yuichi:
Seriously, how come you were up so early?

Nayuki:
I just thought it's would be a nice change if I was the first one down here for breakfast.

Akiko:
I wish it could be like this everyday, Nayuki, even though I do like our old routine.

Nayuki:
I just figured that now that Makoto and Ayu are both gone.
Well, I think that Mom liked it better when it was more lively around the table?
 Uh, Yuichi, you're not going to go away and leave us, are you?

Yuichi:
I'm not going anywhere.
 This is the only home I've got now, so there's no way I'd leave it.

Akiko:
Oh...

Nayuki:
So, uh, Mom, you know what we're gonna have for dinner tonight?

Akiko:
Well, I haven't really thought about it yet.
 But I'd be happy to take requests though.

Nayuki:
Oh, strawberry cake please.

Yuichi:
Always with the strawberries.

Nayuki:
If I could, I would eat strawberry cake for breakfast, lunch and dinner and then I would go to bed and dream them more.

Akiko:
Uh, all right, Nayuki.
 I'll buy you some cake when I'm out.

Nayuki:
Mmhmm!



Nayuki:
Ah, look, it's still here.
 I'm so happy.
 Isn't it great, Yuichi?

Is something wrong?
 Hey, Yuichi?

Yuichi:
Nayuki, you... you were...

Kitagawa:
You guys!
What are you hanging around for?
We're gonna be late!
Come on, come on!

Nayuki:
He's right.
 We'd better hurry inside, Yuichi.



Nayuki:
Yuichi.
 I'm so glad... so glad I can find you... in time.
 I've been looking everywhere for you all morning long.
 So, look what I brought you.
 It's an adorable little snow bunny, see it?
 I made it just for you, Yuichi.
 This's just about the only thing I can make really well.
 For some reason, this one took me kind of long time.
 But I-I wanted to give you something before you left so I worked really hard on it.
 Um... Are you, um... Are you listening?
 Okay, will you accept this gift from me?
 After tomorrow, we won't be able to see each other for a while.
 But you... you're gonna come back and see me really soon, right?
 I know that I've never told you this before but...
 It's... It's just that I've always liked you, Yuichi...
 And I'm... I am...
 Hey, Yuichi?
 Is there something wrong with you?
 Are you crying, Yuichi?
 Oh no, did something happen?
 What's wrong?
 Can you tell me about it?
 Hey, Yui... Ah!



Teacher:
Nayuki, and you too, Yuichi, please come with me.
I need you two both to listen to me calmly.
Nayuki, it's about your mother.

Nayuki:
Huh...

Teacher:
Your mother was in a traffic accident.
She's been taken to the hospital.
