  Clock:
Meow. Good morning, sleepy-head!
It's time to eat breakfast.
And it's time to go to school today.

Yuichi:
Nayuki, time to get up!

Come on, Nayuki.
 It's morning.
 Wake up!

Nayuki:
I was having a nice dream about spring break.

Yuichi:
Don't you think you're jumping the gun?
 I mean it's only February.

Akiko:
Good morning, sleepy-heads.

Piro:
Meow!

Yuichi:
Good morning, aunt Akiko.

Nayuki:
'Morning, Mom.
 Whoa, did you make a new batch of strawberry jam?

Akiko:
Yes, try it, I wanted to know what you think.

Nayuki:
Sure!



Yuichi:
So, uh, you mind telling me why we're running exactly?

Nayuki:
Because Mom's strawberry jam was extra super good this morning, that's why.
 Come on, Yuichi.
 You'd better run a whole lot faster than that or we're never gonna make it there on time.

Yuichi:
Huh...

Yuichi:
We made it.

Nayuki:
I'm proud of you.

Yuichi:
You know, in the future, I'd appreciate it if you'd show a little self-control.
 You almost made us late, 'cause you couldn't get enough of that jam, which you can eat whenever you want.

Nayuki:
Yeah, you're right.
 I never thought of it that way but I can eat Mom's strawberry jam anytime.

Yuichi:
You can also eat your mom's other jam whenever you want to.

Nayuki:
Ooh, stop it, you're gonna make me puke.

Yuichi:
Well, I'll eat it, but I'm allergic.

Nayuki:
Why didn't you ever tell me about this before?

Kitagawa:
Hey, you guys!
What're you talking about?

Yuichi:
We were just talking about a special kinda jam that aunt Akiko makes.

Kaori:
What?
 You mean she's still making that stuff?

Yuichi:
Don't tell me she made you try it.

Kaori:
Oh yeah, I swear I was hallucinating for full an hour.

Yuichi:
Oh, man.

Kitagawa:
What jam?
What are you talking about?

Yuichi:
You better not knowing.
 Sometimes ignorance really is bliss.

Kitagawa:
Huh?

Kaori:
Anyway, I got some news.
 Wanna guess?

Yuichi:
Huh?


Shiori:
Hi, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
I thought you might be here.

Shiori:
Yes!
 Starting today, I'm back at school full time.

Yuichi:
You should've just stayed at home.
 I mean, you gonna have to repeat the whole first year anyway.

Shiori:
Ah, I don't like people who say things like that.
 It's been a long time.

Yuichi:
Yeah...
 I'm so happy for you.
 It's so great you can come to school again.

Shiori:
Yuichi, I... um...

Yuichi:
What do you say we throw another party at Hyakkaya for you.
 This time, we'll all be there to celebrate your recovery.

Shiori:
At times like this...

Yuichi:
Hm?

Shiori:
At times like this, it's not so terrible to cry, right?

Yuichi:
Shiori...

Shiori:
Oh, Yuichi!
 I never ever wanted to die!
 I was so afraid to say good-bye to everyone.
 I was so afraid...
 I was... afraid...

Yuichi:
It's okay for you to cry if you feel like it, Shiori.
 You've been holding all this in for a long time.

Shiori:
Yes... Yes...


Sayuri:
Right, now let's eat!

Mai, Yuichi:
Thank for the food, Sayuri.

Yuichi:
I couldn't believe that both of you got released from the hospital just in time for graduation.

Sayuri:
Yeah, right.
 The doctor seemed surprised that we were ready to come back so soon.
 He kept saying it was nothing short of a miracle, the recovery was so fast.
 Right, Mai?

Mai:
Mmhmm.

Yuichi:
A miracle...

Sayuri:
Then again, the college entrance exams just have already happened, so it looks like we'll have to wait till next year.
 Right, Mai?

Mai:
Mmhmm.

Yuichi:
So, you're planing to go to college?

Mai:
Sayuri and I will go to the same school.
 I'm going because I hope to become a veterinarian one day.

Yuichi:
With those glasses perched on the end of your nose like that, you almost look like a model student, Mai.
 But I don't remember that being the case, are you sure they'll accept...
 Aw ouch!

Sayuri:
Ahaha, what makes you think Mai's grades are bad.
 She's always been a smarty.

Yuichi:
Seriously?

Sayuri:
Mmhmm.
 They're better than you think.
 Hey, Sayuri just thought up something.
 Did you ever find that friend you were looking for, Yuichi?
 Ayu, something other?

Yuichi:
Ah, she said we can't see each other anymore.
 So, she probably moved away or something.



Akiko:
Yuichi, dear!

Yuichi:
Aunt Akiko?

Akiko:
Did you think I... was someone else?

Yuichi:
Oh, no.
 I don't think she'd ever called me "Yuichi, dear" the whole time I knew her.
 What's that?

But I'm glad that there were no bad aftereffects from the accident.

Akiko:
 The doctors were pretty surprised that I was recovered.
 And I recovered so quickly, too.
 He kept saying it was like a miracle.
 So, Yuichi, did you ever happen to find out where Ayu might have disappeared to?
 She's been on my mind a lot lately.
 Nayuki's pretty worried as well.
 I don't think we'll be able to focus on anything until I know.

Yuichi:
Aunt Akiko, I-I remember what happened.
 What happened seven years ago.
 On the last day of my winter break, a friend that I was playing with fell out of a tree and went to the hospital.
 I was asked to explain what happened and then, they just sent me home.
 I was in a daze as I waited at the station, and that's when Nayuki came.
 Nayuki had no idea about the accident.
 I took my anger out on her, and I just left her and got on a train and I never told my parents anything about what happened.
 The rest I don't remember.
 We saw each other this time, you... you didn't mention the accident at all.
 I guess you did tell me about the tree getting cut down... maybe to see if I remembered anything.
 Isn't that right?
 The tree was cut down so nothing like that would ever happen again, right?
 And the girl who fell out of the tree was... Ayu Tsukimiya...
 Ayu... Ayu died that day...
 She died...

Akiko:
Oh, no, that isn't true.
 I'm afraid you're mistaken, Yuichi.
 The girl... The girl who fell from the tree, she didn't die, but...



Sayuri:
Yuichi!

Yuichi:
I thought I'd never find you.
 Sure a lot of people here today, huh.
 Congratulations are in order.
 This is a little something for the graduate.

Sayuri:
Aha, thank you so much, you shouldn't have.

Yuichi:
Ah!
 Oh, Mai. You're here, too?
 I'm messing with you.
 I know that you're graduating, too.
 Here you go.

Mai:
Oh...

Sayuri:
Wasn't that nice of him, Mai?
 Sorry to run off, for Mai and Sayuri will have a party to get to.
 It'll be a lot more fun if you can come, too, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
I'd love to escort you ladies but there's something I've gotta do.
 I can join you later.
 Maybe Kitagawa can go with you now.

Mai:
Are you going to see her?

Yuichi:
Yeah.

Sayuri:
Sayuri heard you go to the hospital every afternoon.

Yuichi:
Yeah, the doctor say it'll help to have someone talk to her a couple hours a day.

Sayuri:
What about Ayu's family?
 Did you ever see them there?

Yuichi:
They're usually there on the weekends.
 We're all hoping that she can wake up soon.
 Well, sorry guys, I'll see you later.

Sayuri:
Okay, see you in a little bit.
 Hmm...
 Sayuri heard she's been sleeping for the past seven years ever since the accident.
 You and Sayuri should go see her someday too.

Mai:
Mmhmm.



Yuichi:
Ayu...
 Today, our high school had its graduation ceremony for the senior class.
 Mai and Sayuri asked about you.
 Remember Mai?
 You met her at school in the middle of the night once.

Ayu:
A dream... I'm having a dream...
 A dream where the boy I love is beside me.
 That boy talks to me...
 He tells me all kinds of stories...
 About a cousin he hadn't seen in seven years...
 About a baby fox who became human for a little while...
 About a mysterious girl who shows up in the school court yard...
 About a girl who battles demons late at night when the school is empty ...
 About a childhood friend he met again in town...
 I guess she literally have run into one knight... at dusk...
 A dream... I'm having a dream...
 A dream where I'm next to the boy that I love...
 Everyday life... repeats itself as usual...
 Fragments of that dream come to me... again and again and fill out my heart.
 Like flakes of falling snow, that gradually... hour after hour pile up on each other...
 And slowly cover the town in a thick white blanket.

Shiori:
Yuichi, I was curious...
 Have you ever wondered if you were in someone else's dream, and so they're dreaming of you right now.

Yuichi:
What are you talking about?

Shiori:
It's just a philosophical question.
 And what if the person was able to grant your wish, you could choose whatever you wanted to happen next in the dream.
 Maybe when she fist started living in the dream world, I bet all she could do was cry.
 But even still she never ever stopped waiting for something new to happen in the dream.
 And then she was given just one opportunity--a wish...
 It was like a present for the girl who had waited patiently for so long.
 And that's why any wish could be granted like... curing a sick girl or... or saving someone who was in a terrible accident, or healing a friend who was injured...
 It could be granted... as long as that person was in her dream.

Yuichi:
I thought you said I only got one wish.

Shiori:
Well, I don't know how it works exactly or what she wants.
 Maybe she just wanted the person she loves to always be happy and she'll do whatever she can to make that work.
 Maybe that's what the dreaming girl was wishing for.
 And to make that happen, maybe everyone around the person she was dreaming about had to be happy, too.

Yuichi:
What would make you think something like that?

Shiori:
I have no idea.
 This might sound weird, but ever since I got better, I just can't help thinking of that.
 I don't know.

Yuichi:
A dream...

Nayuki:
Yuichi, are you a miracle worker?

Yuichi:
Uh...!

Nayuki:
There, all done.
 It's kinda weird, she always used to wear a red hairband, remember?
 Well, I think I'm gonna head back home now, okay?

Yuichi:
Hey, thanks a lot for coming.
 I know you're busy.

Nayuki:
I'm not doing all this for you, Yuichi.
 I love Ayu too, you know.
 Yuichi...

Yuichi:
Hm?

Nayuki:
I thought you'd like to know that I can believe now.
 Miracles really do exit.
 Don't lose hope!
 See you later!


Yuichi:
Nayuki just got admitted to a college with a great track program.
 Kaori's smart so I'm sure she'll get into another college of her choice, too.
 And I guess Mai did really well in her college entrance exams.
 Shiori[, well,] she was really happy because she got some kind of award for a art club project that she did with a couple of her friends.
 Ayu...
 I wish that I knew... if you could hear my voice.
 Ayu...
 Come in.

So how come you're not hanging out with Sayuri, today?

Mai:
Yuichi.
 She's probably still waiting for you to come and bring her home, you know.
 Don't you understand?
 It's time you went to get her.
 Just like you came to get me once.

Yuichi:
Get her?

Mai:
Yes.
 Only you can do it, Yuichi.
 The only one who can keep a promise and end all of this is the one who made the promise.

Yuichi:
But where?
 Where is Ayu waiting for me?


Ayu:
I liked the flowing scenery...
 Winter...
 A city of fluttering snow...
 I loved running through the shopping district, leaving behind new footprints in the sidewalks.
 Spring...
 A city of melting snow...
 I loved scooping up... scooping up the little piles of it that hadn't melted yet underneath the trees.
 Summer...
 A city that's forgotten the cold of snow...
 I loved looking at the city when I would take long walks under the shade of my parasol.

Shiori:
Huh?

Kitagawa:
Uuhh...

Ayu:
Autumn...
 A city foretelling the arrival of snow...
 I loved watching the snowflakes drifting down from the clouds.
 I would catch them as many as I could with my hands.
 And now it's winter again.
 The season of snow.
 The season where the city and everything in it is covered in white.

Aha-ha-ha...

How I loved the flowing scenery...
 But like a river frozen in its banks, my time has stopped flowing... in this rectangular room, in a time that knows no seasons.
 I was always... always and forever alone.
 Over and over again, I would see the same scenes in my dream... that I always did.
 And I began to surrender to the never-ending night.
 But slowly, I feel the dawn is breaking.

Ayu:
Um, it was a gift from somebody who's really important to me.
 And you gave me this headband.
 You wouldn't happen to remember anything about the day that you gave this to me, would you?

Yuichi:
I never even gave her the present.
 I never gave it to her...

Ayu:
You mean I can really keep it?
 If you change your mind and ask for it back, I don't think I'm going to give it back.

Yuichi:
I chose an illusion over reality.
 I-I shoved what really happened deep down into my heart.
 I chose to accept an illusion that gave me comfort.
 I protected myself from being heart broken.
 So I wouldn't destroy the good memories I have.

Ayu:
Huh...
 You're late as usual, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Sorry,
 I really outdid myself this time, didn't I?

Ayu:
Yeah, I was getting tired of waiting.
 I've been here for so long.

Yuichi:
Were you worried?
 Did you think I might not show up?

Ayu:
No way.
 I knew you would keep your promise.

Yuichi:
Right.
 Ayu... Here you go.

Ayu:
What is that?

Yuichi:
Remember? I said I wanted to give you something.

Ayu:
Wow!

Yuichi:
Ayu...
 Let's go...

Ayu:
Sure!



Ayu:
Huh...
 He's late again.
 I was starting to feel a little bit sad.
 And then there he was, standing right in front of me again.

Yuichi:
Hey, sorry I took so long.

Ayu:
You're late!
 Way too late!

Yuichi:
Sorry. I was reporting you.

Ayu:
Reporting me?
 What the heck are you talking about?

Yuichi:
I had to.
 The fashion police would look out for suspicious characters.

Ayu:
What looks suspicious?

Yuichi:
All of you.

Ayu:
Uguu! That's the mean thing to say!

Yuichi:
Well, what's with the hat?
 Are you trying to get beat up or something?

Ayu:
Don't laugh, okay?

Yuichi:
I won't laugh.

Ayu:
You aren't gonna laugh at me?

Yuichi:
You have my promise as a gentleman that no matter what happens, I'm not going to laugh.

Ayu:
That totally sounds like a lie.
 But okay. Fine.
 Remember you promise.

Yuichi:
You may not believe it, but I am more than capable of keeping my promises.

Ayu:
Well, I went to the barber because I needed to get my hair cut again.
 But then... He cut it all off.

Yuichi:
Hahahaha...

Ayu:
He laughed loud and long without holding anything back.

 Uguu! You gave me your word that you wouldn't laugh at me!

Yuichi:
Oh man, with your hair that short, you look even more like a boy than you did before.
 That's what you get for trying to go to a barber.

Ayu:
But I've never gotten my hair cut anywhere else.

Yuichi:
Next time you go, I'll have Nayuki take you to a salon.

Ayu:
Yeah, that sounds good.

Yuichi:
Come on, let's get going.
 Aunt Akiko says she's making some taiyaki for you.

Ayu:
Seriously?

Yuichi:
Shiori, Mai, Kaori and Sayuri are all at the house right now, too.
 Everybody's waiting for us.

Ayu:
Then we'd better get there quick.

Yuichi:
Right!

Ayu:
I'd like to learn how to make taiyaki too.

The memories that had stopped are slowly starting to flow again, while holding on to a single fragment of a miracle.

Hey, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Hmm?

Ayu:
Do you think that I'll be able to run on my own again?

Yuichi:
Of course you will.
 You'll be running on dirt, on grass, and even on snow.
 I know you're gonna run again someday.

Ayu:
Mmhmm. I think so too.

I don't know how long it will take.
 But that hardly matters.
 Because I have all the time in the world...
