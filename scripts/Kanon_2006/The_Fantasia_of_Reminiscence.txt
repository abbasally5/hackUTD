  Nayuki:
I'm off to practice!

Akiko:
You'd be careful, honey!

Nayuki:
Okay!

Makoto:
She is leaving awfully early.

Yuichi:
She's got an early practice for track and field. By the way, have you thinking out what to do with that cat?

Makoto:
Well, I'd like to keep it if I can. Is that okay?

Yuichi:

Akiko:
Yes, you may.

Makoto:

Yuichi:
See.

Akiko:
Just try to keep it away from Nayuki, all right? She is extremely allergic to cats.

Yuichi:

Makoto:
Yeah? You want to?

Yuichi:

Makoto:
What the heck is that?

Yuichi:
It's your cat's name.

Makoto:
I don't think so! That's totally stupid and freaky!

Yuichi:
Fine... Siam-o Siamzuka!

Makoto:
You're only eating away cuter names than that!

Yuichi:

Makoto:

Yuichi:
Then how about Piroshiki? You got call her Piro-chan for short. That's pretty cute, don't you think?

Makoto:
It's kind of cute. What's it mean?

Yuichi:
It has no meaning. It's a word that's just from, from a very special part of my huge brain. The part whose sole purpose is just to charm, lure, and delight the ladies.

Makoto:
Huh? I have absolutely no freaking idea what you're talking about. But the name is nice. So I'll keep it. Okay? Piro, Piro!

Akiko:
Isn't a Piroshiki some kind of Russian deep fried meat bun?

Yuichi:
Yeah, but Makoto seems happy with it. So I guess the name is gonna stick.
