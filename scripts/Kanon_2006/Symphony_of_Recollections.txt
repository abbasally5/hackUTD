  Yuichi:
Nayuki...



Doctor:
We're going to do everything we can.
But just know, if we don't see any improvement in her condition soon, I can't give you any assurances that she's going to make it through this.

Yuichi:
I got in touch with my parents and told them everything.
 They said they're on their way, they'll be here as soon as they can.

Teacher:
Do you know of anyone else that might still need to be notified.

Yuichi:
Well, Nayuki?

Teacher:
Don't worry, Nayuki, just hang in there.
I'll do whatever I can to help you through this.
If anything happens, give me a call right away.

Yuichi:
Thanks, sir, I will.

Hey, Nayuki.
 It's gonna be okay.
 I just know she's gonna pull through.

Yuichi:
Is this something about aunt Akiko?

Nurse:
I don't know. There haven't been any changes in her condition.
I thought maybe you could use this.

Doctor:
We feel pretty confident her condition's finally stabilized.
Honestly, there's not a lot more we can do for her right now.
I suggest you go home and try to get some rest.
We'll call if there're any changes.
If possible, please stay somewhere we can get a hold of you immediately if necessary.

Yuichi:
Right.



Piro:
Meow!

Yuichi:
Hm?
 Uh, sorry we left you alone, Piro.
 You must be hungry.
 We should probably have something to eat too, huh?

Here. Dinner's ready.
 You should try to eat a little bit.
We haven't had anything since [we got] yesterday morning...

Nayuki:
This is all my fault...
 It's true, it's my fault because if I hadn't told her I wanted a strawberry cake, she wouldn't have been there.

Yuichi:
Just stop!
 You're being ridiculous!
 Nayuki!
 Huh...

Nayuki... Nayuki... I, uh... I'm going back to school.
 I have to talk to the teacher about why we were not coming.
 And we left our school bags there too.
 So, I'm gonna leave your food right outside the door.
 Make sure you eat it, okay?



Kitagawa:
Yuichi!

Yuichi:
Hey...

Kitagawa:
Must been pretty rough, huh?
So, um, how is she?

Yuichi:
She's still under going treatment.

Kitagawa:
I see, and Nayuki?

Yuichi:
Huh...

Kitagawa:
Hang in there.
And let me know if there's anything I can do to help.

Yuichi:
Yeah, thanks a lot.



Yuichi:
Nayuki, I'm back home.
 I stopped by the hospital on my way home from school.
 There's been no change in her condition.
 This is crazy.
 I'm coming in.
 Hm?
 Come on, I brought your school bag home, so can you please just open the door?

Nayuki:
You leave it outside the door.

Yuichi:
Nayuki, I just wanna talk to you for a second.
 Nayuki, please!
 Open the door!

Nayuki:
Don't do that.
 Don't do that!
 Just please stop knocking.
 I'm sorry, Yuichi.



Yuichi:
If she were here, I wonder what she'd do, how she'd try to brighten up the mood in here.
 Huh?!

Piro:
Meow!

Nayuki:
Hey, Yuichi.
 A snow bunny doesn't remind you of anything in particular, does it?

Yuichi:
So, I guess she never forgot about that.
 Why can't I remember why I was crying that day?
 I was able to remember about Makoto... and about Mai, and also Nayuki.
 But... it still feels like there's something missing...
 Something really important...
 Something...



Yuichi:
Hey, Nayuki.
 I think I may head over to the hospital.
 I'm leaving you some food out here.



Piro:
Meow.

Yuichi:
Hey, Nayuki, you feeling better?

Yuichi:
I'm coming in.
 Hey, Nayuki...

Nayuki:
Yuichi, just get out.



Nayuki:
Get out of here please, Yuichi.
 I don't wanna see anyone.
 I want... to be alone.

Yuichi:
Hey, long time no see, it's been a couple of days.
 I saw you finally ate something.
 Did you like my cooking?
 Oh, I know it's no great shakes compared to the stuff that aunt Akiko can make but...
 Come on, Nayuki.
 You're seriously going to sit in here and keep blaming yourself forever?
 Aunt Akiko's going to pull through.
 She lives her life by her own rules.
 There's no way something this stupid can take her away.

Nayuki:
Yuichi, are you a miracle worker?

Yuichi:
Huh?

Nayuki:
Mom and I... we were always together the two of us.
 For as long as I can remember, in this town, in this house, it's just always been us.
 I don't... I don't even know what my dad looks like.
 But it's still... Because I always have Mom, I never felt lonely at all.
 We were able to make it this far together and... and now because of me, I'm going to be all alone in the world.

Yuichi:
You're not going to be alone.
 You're one of the most popular girls at school, you know that?
 People like Kaori and Kitagawa and all your teammates think you're great.
 And you've got me too.

Nayuki:
I've got you too?

Yuichi:
Yeah.
 I'm right here with you, aren't I?

Nayuki:
I don't believe you.
 How could have you forgot about me for seven years?
 You're a liar!
 You never once responded to any of the letters I sent you.

Yuichi:
I know... but I read every one of them.

Nayuki:
Since I didn't hear from you, I thought... maybe you just never got them somehow.
 When I heard that you were coming back here to stay with me and Mom, I was almost too scared to go and meet you at the train station.
 I was sure I'd see you there, but you wouldn't recognize me or remember my name.

Yuichi:
I, uh... I remember what happened seven years ago.
 It was the last day of winter break, when we were saying good-bye at the station, and you came with the snow bunny.
 I'm so sorry.
 Will you forgive me?

Nayuki:
All of that is in the past.

Yuichi:
Would it be okay if I stayed in here with you for a little longer?
 Nayuki?

Nayuki:
No.

Yuichi:
Huh.

Nayuki:
Please go away...
 I can't be happy anymore.
 I don't know how it could be, because I was always with Mom and [she's here so I'm here].

Yuichi:
Nayu-

Nayuki:
Get out!

Yuichi:
Ah!



Yuichi:
A miracle, huh?
 I guess that was pretty insensitive.
 I told her "I'm here" after I'd forgotten about her all these years.
 Something like this happened a long time ago, too.
 Someone got hurt very badly.
 And I couldn't do anything to make it right.



Yuichi:
I bet Ayu's gonna be so mad.

Ayu:
Yuichi, why are you so late?!

Yuichi:
I better hide this real quick.

Ayu:
Why are you late?

Yuichi:
I thought I could come to this school whenever I wanted to.

Ayu:
But you can't be this late.

Yuichi:
To apologize for the wait, I'd buy lunch.
 Here you go.

Ayu:
So, have you finished all your packing then?

Yuichi:
Not at all.
 But don't you worry about that.
 It's our last day together.

Ayu:
It's not our last day together!
 We both made a promise that we'd see each other again, didn't we?

Yuichi:
Yeah, that's right.

Ayu:
I thought that we... Well, didn't we promise each other that we'd meet back here someday?

Yuichi:
I know we did.
 And we will.

Ayu:
Right! Then we will!

Yuichi:
The next time I come to town, and I think I'll introduce you to my cousin Nayuki.
 I think you'll like her a lot, and I just know she'll like you.

Ayu:
Good! I can't wait to meet her then.

Another beautiful view today.

Yuichi:
Doesn't she ever get tired of looking at the same thing everyday?
 Hey. Come on back down here already!

Ayu:
Right. I'll be down in a minute.

Argh!

Yuichi:
Ah...
 Ayu! Ayu! Ayu!

Ayu:
Yuichi... I...

Yuichi:
Don't try to talk!
 I'm taking you to the hospital right now!

Ayu:
But it hurts.

Yuichi:
I know! So, don't...
 Just don't strain yourself, okay?

Ayu:
I fell down...
 But I'm supposed to be good at climbing trees.
 I wonder why... my body doesn't hurt anymore.
 What's going to happen to me, Yuichi?

Yuichi:
If it doesn't hurt anymore, that means you're gonna be fine...

Ayu:
Yeah.
 That's weird.
 I just tried to move my arm, but it wouldn't go.

Yuichi:
You don't have to move it.
 I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

Ayu:
Well but...
 If I can't move, then we can't play anymore.
 Yuichi...
 Will you play with me... again someday?

Yuichi:
Yeah, of course.
 I even have a present I wanted to give you.

Ayu:
Oh, good, promise me.

Yuichi:
Okay.

Ayu:
Pinky swear?
 I forgot I can't move.
 If I can't move my hands, how can I pinky swear with you?
 I'm an idiot, huh?

Yuichi:
There, we'll pinky swear just like this.
 We're making each other a promise, right?
 It's, uh, a promise.

Ayu:
Yeah, we're making a promise.

Yuichi:
Come on, Ayu, if you don't let go, it won't be a real pinky swear.
 Just let go!
 Let go of my finger!
 If you don't let go together, it won't be a real pinky swear.
 Ayu? Nooo!!



Kitagawa:
Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Kitagawa...

Kitagawa:
I just came to check up on you guys.
Is everything okay?

Yuichi:
Kitagawa, I just remembered something.

Kitagawa:
What? Remembered what?

Yuichi:
That Ayu is... Ayu is...

Kitagawa:
Then, what's wrong with Ayu?

Yuichi:
Take care of Nayuki.

Kitagawa:
What the...? Yuichi!



Yuichi:
Ayu...
 Ayu!

 Ayu...
 Ayu...
 Ayu...
 Ayu...

Maybe if I just stay still like this... maybe I can go to where she is.
 I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry...

Makoto:
Yuichi... Aw...



Yuichi:
Ayu, you've got to open your present.

Ayu:
Uh, what is it?
 Ah, it's beautiful.
 It's a headband, isn't it?

Yuichi:
That's right.

Ayu:
You mean I can really keep it?
 If you change your mind and ask for it back, I don't think I'm going to give it back.

Yuichi:
Well, even if you wanna give it back to me, I wouldn't take it.

Ayu:
Oh, I know.
 The next time I see you, I'll be wearing this.
 In that way, we'll recognize each other.

Yuichi:
Oh, yeah.
 Is that a promise?

Ayu:
Yup, it's a promise.
