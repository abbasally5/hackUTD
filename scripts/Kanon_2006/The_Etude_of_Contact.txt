  Clock:
Meow. Good morning, sleepy...

Akiko:
Hm?
A good morning, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Uh...
Oh, good morning to you guys too.

Ayu:
You're looking a little run-down this morning.

Yuichi:
Nah, I'm feeling just fine, thank you.

Ayu:
Well, you sure don't look like you were.

Akiko:
How about I make you some toast, okay?


Shiori:
Ah...
Hey!

Yuichi:
Arh!

Shiori:
Good morning, Yuichi!
I'm sorry.
I was just so happy to see you that I had to body-slam you.
You know how it is.

Yuichi:
Well, good morning to you too.



第18話 消え去りゆく緩徐楽章 - adagio -
- Episode 18 - The Etude of Contact



Yuichi:
Did you make lunch for me again today?

Shiori:
It's gonna be even better than yesterday's.

Yuichi:
You saying you want us to eat together again?

Shiori:
Yes. Your classroom is on my way to the cafeteria, so come by after fourth period.
Oh, well, on second thought, maybe it'd be better if I didn't go to your class.

Yuichi:
Yeah, you're right.


Yuichi:
I've been looking for you.

Kaori:
When I stand up here, it almost feels like time has stopped.
I know that sounds stupid.
Time never stops.

Yuichi:
You look too well, Kaori.
You haven't been sleeping, have you?

Kaori:
That courtyard down there, it may be empty right now, but when the snow melts and spring comes, it'll be different out here, full of students.

Yuichi:
So, I guess you knew Shiori used to stand down there.
She was down there everyday.


Shiori:
A birthday party?

Yuichi:
That's right.
But if you're not up to it, I can always call it off.

Shiori:
Oh, no, please don't do that.
I'm so excited.
But uh... who else would be coming besides the two of us?

Yuichi:
Oh, well, Ayu for one.
And I was planning on asking two or three more people I know.
It should be something small but fun, you know?

Shiori:
That sounds nice.
Thank you so much, Yuichi.
I can't wait for my party.

Yuichi:
Hm.

Shiori:
You gonna be okay?

Yuichi:
I ate way too much food even for me.

Shiori:
I'm really sorry.
I made too big of a lunch for you again today, didn't I?

Yuichi:
Don't worry.
It was so good and it would've been a total shame to waste any.

Shiori:
Mmhmm.

Yuichi:
Shiori, you wanna skip the rest of school today?

Shiori:
Huh?

Yuichi:
We can go anywhere.
I'll go where you feel like going while we still can.

Shiori:
Mm.
What in the world's gotten into you today?

Yuichi:
Uh, what?

Shiori:
You're making it sound like we won't be able to see each other anymore before too long.
And inviting an underclassman to go play hooky with you?
What are you trying to do? Be a delinquent?

Yuichi:
Well, I was trying to lead you astray, but I suppose I failed.

Shiori:
Well, I think I'd better get back to my class before the bell rings.

Yuichi:
Okay, then I guess I'll see you after school.

Shiori:
Sure!


Shiori:
Wow, isn't it beautiful?

Yuichi:
Sunsets aren't that rare of an occurrence if you know when to look for them.

Shiori:
I know that. But if you never notice them, then you don't appreciate them.

Yuichi:
You know, sometimes girls say the craziest things.

Shiori:
Oh, just enjoy it.


Ayu:
What?
You mean tomorrow is Shiori's birthday?

Yuichi:
Well, it's really the day after tomorrow.
But she won't be able to make it that day.
So we're gonna do it tomorrow.

Nayuki:
So how do you know this Shiori girl?
Does she go to our school?

Yuichi:
Yeah. But she's been sick most of the years, so she hasn't been to school very much.
And she doesn't really have that many friends.

Ayu:
I'll definitely be there.
What about you, Nayuki?

Nayuki:
I have practice, but I might be able to.
Our meet's coming up soon, so I wouldn't be able to stay very long.

Yuichi:
That'd be fine. Thanks a lot.


Yuichi:
So, this is where you're hiding.
Today is the last day Shiori will be able to come school here.
After she has a birthday tomorrow, she'll either be treated at home or hospitalized.
She won't be able to leave the house or see her friends.

Kaori:
I don't wanna hear about it.

Yuichi:
Hey! I'm putting together a birthday party for her!
I want you to come too.
Gotta be after school today.
It's at Hyakkaya.

Kaori:
Yeah, I'm not gonna be there.

Yuichi:
Kaori, she's trying to live life to its fullest right now.
She doesn't care how much time she has left.
She's trying to make the best of it.
So what? Are you gonna refuse to acknowledge that Shiori as your sister until it's too late?
She comes here everyday.
And you still pretend you don't understand.
All she's ever wanted is to eat lunch with her big sister out here in the courtyard.
She told me about that promise you two made.
Remember it?
Then when she came to school here, you'd eat lunch together.
You can't understand how much she looked forward to that.
Finally going to the same school as her big sister, eating lunch together in the courtyard or cafeteria, maybe even making a detour on her way home.
All she wanted was to do normal stuff like that.
I'll be waiting for you.
So, please come!


Shiori:
Hey there, Yuichi!

Yuichi:
Look at you, you changed clothes.

Shiori:
Yeah, I got out of class earlier than I expected.
And I didn't feel like carrying my school bag to the party.

Yuichi:
And sometimes I haven't seen you without uniform.

Shiori:
Mmm.

Is it normal to be nervous before your party?

Yuichi:
Don't be nervous.
Everybody is really nice.


Kitagawa:
Yuichi!
We're all right over here!

Ayu:
Hello, Shiori!


Everybody:
Hope you have the best birthday ever, Shiori!

Shiori:
Oh, wow, thank you so much, everybody.

Yuichi:
Come on, you gotta blow out your candles.

Shiori:
Oh, right!

Yuichi:
xxx is very good.

Nayuki:
Oh, so you're the girl who came to get Yuichi for lunch the other day, huh.

Kitagawa:
Hey, that's right.
I thought you looked really familiar.
Aren't you the girl who was standing in the courtyard everyday.

Yuichi:
That's right.
I forgot Kitagawa was the first one of us who spotted Shiori out there.

Kitagawa:
Yeah, that's right!
When'd you go and make a move on her without even asking?!

Yuichi:
Hey, you're gonna give everybody the wrong idea about me!

Kitagawa:
Let's see there're Shiori, Nayuki and um, Ayu Tsukimiya, right?

Ayu:
Mm!

Kitagawa:
And then there're [ ] this girl is.
You know, yeah, you are also pretty tied with those senior girls - what's-her-name and whosit, aren't you?
Man, you don't waste any time, do you?

Nayuki:
Kitagawa, you've got the wrong idea about Yuichi.
He isn't like that.

Ayu:
He isn't like what?

Shiori:
Hmm...

Nayuki:
Here you go.
This is just a little something for you from me and my mom.
It's a jar of homemade strawberry jam.

Shiori:
Ah!

Ayu:
I got something for you too.
I'm sorry I didn't have time to get you something big, but I think you like this anyway.

Yuichi:
So, you ended up getting her taiyaki.

Ayu:
Uguu...

Girl:
This basket is from me.
I made you scones from scratch!

Shiori:
Thank you all so much!
Thank you.

Kitagawa:
It looks like all you got are sweets.

Shiori:
Oh, no, that's all right.
I like sweets things the best!

Yuichi:
She isn't just being polite, you know.
I don't think that I've ever seen her eating anything other than an ice-cream.

Kitagawa:
Are you serious, Shiori?
That isn't very balanced diet, you know.

Waitress:
Hello, table for one?

Nayuki:
Oh, look, it's Kaori.

Shiori, Yuichi:
Huh?

Kitagawa:
Oh, I didn't know Kaori was invited too.
Hey, Kaori, Kaori, over here!
Come on! Come on and sit down with us.
Yoohwoo!

Nayuki:
Yuichi, so you asked Kaori to come here too?

Kitagawa:
Kaori, let me introduce you to someone.
This is the birthday girl, her name's Shiori...
Sorry, what's your last name again?

Yuichi:
Ugh... Hey!
Now that all the guests're here, we can really get the party started!
Come on, guys!

Nayuki:
Oh, I can do that.
You shouldn't serve on your own birthday cake.

Shiori:
That's okay.
Here you go.
Please have as much cake as you like.

Kaori:
Thank you.

Nayuki:
The parfaits are really good here too if you don't like the cake.

Kaori:
I might try one later.


Nayuki:
Um...

Girls:
Hm?

Kitagawa:
Hey, what's up with the mood at this table.

Yuichi:
I'll explain it later.
And could you do me a favour and shape things up?

Kitagawa:
Why? That's my speciality.
I'm on the job.
Woohoow! All right! Come on, ladies!
Look alive!
What's a party without a little bit dancing?
Now, let's get funky like a fuck-shit [geek guy].

Nayuki:
You're not gonna dance while you're here in the restaurant, are you?

Kitagawa:
Oh, yeah!

Waitress:
Um, excuse me, sir.
I'm afraid your dancing is kind of disturbing.

Girl2:
Won't bother me. I wanna see him shake it.

Girl3:
You [ ].

Kitagawa:
All right!
The people have spoken, you ready [hot stuff]?

Kaori:
Um, I think I'll sit this one out.

Yuichi:
Shiori, why don't you go dance with him.

Shiori:
No, no, I'm okay.

Yuichi:
Well, then, I guess that means I'm gonna have to do it.

Kitagawa:
Seriously?

Yuichi:
Totally.
You've got a problem dancing with a dude?

Kitagawa:
I don't know what you're trying to pull.

Yuichi:
Oh, come on, honey!
Don't be shy!
Dance, dance, shake it!

Kitagawa:
[can xxx end ]
Let's go!


Nayuki:
Guys, that was so embarrassing.

Yuichi:
How can you say that after you laughed harder than anyone else there.

Nayuki:
Whatever.

Ayu:
How are you holding up, Shiori?
You must be tired.

Shiori:
Oh, no, I'm fine.
I had such a fun afternoon.
I'm so glad all of you could come today.
Huh?

Nayuki:
Shiori, we should have lunch together at school sometime.

Shiori:
Huh? You mean it?

Girl:
Yeah, that'd be great.

Ayu:
Me too!

Yuichi:
You don't go to the same school as we do, Ayu.

Ayu:
Uguu...

Kitagawa:
I'm in too.
I can't have Yuichi here monopolizing all the ladies.

Yuichi:
Will you stop saying stuff that's gonna give people the wrong idea about me?

Kitagawa:
I don't get it.
What guy wouldn't want a cute girl like her to be his girl friend.

Kaori:
He's right, you have no taste in girls.
You blind or something?

Shiori, Yuichi:
Huh?

Yuichi:
What business is it of yours?

Kaori:
It is my business.
After all, Shiori is...

Shiori:
Huh?

Kaori:
She is, um...
Shiori is my little sister.

Everybody:
She's what?!

Kaori:
Isn't that right?

Shiori:
Well, yes, it is.

Kitagawa:
Why didn't you say anything before?
I mean, what's the big...

Yuichi:
Shut up.

Kaori:
Come on.
Why don't the rest of us get going.

Ayu:
Uh, right.

Nayuki:
Yeah, I have to go to practice.

Kaori:
Shiori, I, um...

Shiori:
Huh?

Kaori:
I'll see you back at home and we'll talk then, okay?

Shiori:
Mmhmm.

Kaori:
And Yuichi, you take care of my sister.

Yuichi:
Right.

Shiori:
Thank you so much for inviting her, Yuichi.
I don't think I have ever been so happy.

Yuichi:
So, what do you feel like doing now?

Shiori:
Huh?

Yuichi:
You still have time to hang out, right?
Is there anywhere else you wanna go.

Shiori:
Yes, there is!


Yuichi:
Are you sure you shouldn't be going home?

Shiori:
Yeah, I told everybody I would be out late tonight.
So, I won't get in trouble.

Yuichi:
Look, it's snowing.

Shiori:
Can I ask you something?

Yuichi:
Hmm?

Shiori:
What do you think about holding hands with me?

Yuichi:
What?

Shiori:
Oh, um...

Shiori:
I'm starting to get a little bit tired.

Yuichi:
I bet you are.
I dragged you all over the place today, huh?

Shiori:
I've gotten a whole lot better at the Whack-A-Mole game though.

Yuichi:
Yeah, you've got a little gift.

Shiori:
I think this might just be my best birthday ever, Yuichi.
I don't know how to thank you enough.

Yuichi:
I didn't do anything much.

Shiori:
You know, you're a pretty strong person, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
No, you're the strong one here, Shiori.

Shiori:
I tried to slit my wrist once... with a box cutter.
It was the night I first met you.

Yuichi:
Uh!

Shiori:
It was the first day everyone was back at school after winter break.
I remember it well.
I watched Kaori leave through my bedroom window.
When she was all the way down to the street, I decided to leave the house too.
I put this shawl on, even though I hardly ever wore it.
Kaori gave to me as a gift long time ago.
It was the last present she gave me.
Now that I think about it, she gave this shawl to me exactly one year ago today.
I had wanted to open it early.
I kept begging her to give me my present, and so she finally let me open it the day before my birthday.
Anyway, after I saw Kaori leave, I went the convenience store, and bought a box cutter and a bunch of other stuff.
And then I made my way home... trying to enjoy without I thought it would be my last snowy day.
And that's when I ran into you and Ayu.
I remembered it so clearly, sitting in my room with the lights off.
I was all alone in the darkness.
It was so quiet.
I couldn't hear anything, see anything, or think about anything.
I felt like I had been left all alone in this world.
Like somehow I wandered off, found myself in a lonely place... where I didn't belong...
That's when I heard something.
It was the people I had met that afternoon, laughing.
I remembered their smiles and their happy voices.
And it made me realize how pathetic I was for trying to quit.
And I started to laugh all by myself right there.
I hadn't laughed that hard in ages.
And I cried the tears I hadn't cried before when Kaori told me I wouldn't live to see my next birthday.
The tears were supposed to be from laughing but they just wouldn't stop.
They just kept... coming.
I finally realized that I was crying from sadness after having held it in so long.
And then, after I was done, I realized that I didn't want it all to end.
I think maybe it was a miracle meeting you and Ayu that day.

Yuichi:
That story just shows how strong you are.

Shiori:
No, I'm really a weak person... a weak person who needs to depend on others to live.
That's the truth about me.

Yuichi:
What's wrong with that?
Everyone needs somebody that they can depend on.

Shiori:
Hmm...

Yuichi:
I think it's called a miracle because there's a chance that something good's gonna happen.

Shiori:
You may be right about that, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Can you promise me something?

Shiori:
What do you want me to promise?

Yuichi:
That if a miracle occurs, you've gotta treat me to lunch in the cafeteria.

Shiori:
All right, Yuichi.
You have my word.
I want you to know how much fun I had with you today.

Yuichi:
So do I, Shiori.

Shiori:
I'd like to go to that coffee shop with you again sometime.

Yuichi:
Yeah.

Shiori:
And that's not all.
I'd like to walk the shopping district again too.

Yuichi:
Yeah.

Shiori:
And did I tell you that I made a new friend at school in fourth period.
She is really nice, and she invited me to hang out with sometime next week after school.

Yuichi:
I'm really glad to hear that.

Shiori:
It seems like there're still so many things to do.
So many places I wanted to see.
I don't... I don't wanna die, Yuichi.
I wonder if... if maybe I shouldn't have tried to get close to someone over the past few weeks, you know.

Yuichi:
You don't think so?

Shiori:
Because I don't wanna make this person feel the same way my sister felt about me.

Yuichi:
Let's get something straight, Shiori.
I'm never gonna feel sorry that I met you.

Shiori:
You really mean that?

Yuichi:
Yeah, really. It's the truth.

Shiori:
Hmm...
Was I able to smile most of the time?
Tell me, Yuichi. Was I able to smile no matter what was going on?

Yuichi:
Uh, yeah, you did good.

Shiori:
I'm glad.

It's almost time.

Yuichi:
Yeah.

Shiori:
When the big hand makes it to twelve, I'm officially going to be sixteen years old.

Yuichi:
That's right.

Shiori:
Mmm...

Yuichi:
Looks like it's time for your birthday present, Shiori.

Shiori:
Should I open it now?

Yuichi:
Yeah.

Shiori:
Wow!

Yuichi:
Go nuts with that, okay?

Shiori:
'Kay!
Thanks so much, Yuichi.
I'll treasure it always.

Yuichi:
Shiori...

Shiori:
Hey, Yuichi...

Yuichi:
Hm?

Shiori:
I think I'm gonna need something warm to drink.
Just wait here, okay, Yuichi?

Yuichi:
Uh... Hmm...

Yuichi:
She's taking forever.
Ah!

Yuichi:
Happy sweet sixteen, Shiori.
