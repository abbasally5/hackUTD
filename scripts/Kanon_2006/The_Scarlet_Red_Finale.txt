  Yuichi:
Makoto...


Yuichi:
Huh...

Makoto:
I'm sorry.
Did I wake you up, Yuichi?

Yuichi:
Um, where am I, exactly?

Makoto:
Can you hang on for just a second?
I'm heating up some milk on the stove right now.

Yuichi:
Who is that?
And how does she know my name?

Makoto:
Are you feeling a little bit warmer?
Don't force yourself to get up on my account, okay?

Yuichi:
Oh, right.
But I think I'm okay now.

Makoto:
Here you go.

Yuichi:
Thanks.

Makoto:
You are Yuichi, right?
You are, I knew it!
I thought about calling an ambulance, but my condo was so much closer so I decided to bring you here.
You're staying at your cousin's again?
Well, if so, I have a phone that you can use if you'd like to call them.
They must be so worried.

Yuichi:
Uh, right.
Thank you for taking care of me.
But I don't understand.
How... How in the world did you know?

Makoto:
Know that it was you?
It did seem strange, but your face looked so familiar.
And then when you called my name, I just knew it.

Yuichi:
No, that's not what I meant.

Makoto:
Well, I'm all grown up now, so I don't live with my family anymore.
We used to be neighbors when you came to visit.

Yuichi:
Neighbors?
Ah!
You're the Sawataris' daughter.
You're Makoto?

Makoto:
That's right.
Makoto Sawatari.
It's been forever, hasn't it, Yuichi?



Kitagawa:
Oh, good, you made it.
Sorry to make you come over so late.

Kaori:
Yuichi hasn't come back yet?

Kitagawa
No.
And Nayuki's still locked up in her room.
I just didn't know what else I could do.

Kaori:
Nayuki's in her room, right?

Nayuki, it's Kaori.
I'm sorry to hear about your mom.
Can you open the door please, Nayuki?

Nayuki:
Sorry, but I don't wanna see anyone right now.

Kaori:
Is this what happened with Yuichi?
Is this how you chased him out of the house?
I understand what you were going through, you know.
I've been going through a lot of the same thing.
My little sister, Shiori..., you know, in the hospital now, right?
Well, she... she's going to die...
I couldn't deal with the pain of losing her.
So I kept pretending like she never existed.
If it weren't for Yuichi and Kitagawa and you, I'd still be doing that.
Nayuki, I don't want you to make the same mistake.
I don't want you to close your heart, and wallow in self-pity, and end up causing more pain to the people who care about you.
Yuichi's been so worried about Shiori.
Please don't make him worry about you too.
You need to show him that you're going to be fine.
We have to stay strong.
Both of us do...

Piro:
Meow.

Kitagawa:
How'd it go?

Kaori:
It's going to take a little more time.
But I'll stay with her at least until Yuichi comes back.

Kitagawa:
But shouldn't you... be at the hospital with Shiori?

Kaori:
She told me to come here.
She said that "no one should be stuck in a room with they don't have to be.
So go see Nayuki."
Uh.

Kitagawa:
Should we answer that?

Kaori:
Minase, residence.
Yuichi, is that you?
Where are you?
I see, so you can't go anywhere?
That's okay.
We'll be right there.

Akiko:
Because that's what families do, Nayuki.
They look out for each other, right?



Makoto:
Did something happen?
You're in high school now, right?
The last time I saw you, I think you were only up to my armpit.
And now you tower over me.
Is something wrong?

Yuichi:
I'm just the same I always was.
I haven't changed a bit since I was seven.
Anytime someone's suffering, I can't do anything.
I'm completely powerless.
All I can do was just watch in silence.
And now I can't do anything for Nayuki either.
Or for Shiori, Mai, Makoto.

Makoto:
Huh?

Yuichi:
They were waiting for me all this time.
But I... I forgot about all of them.
And even Ayu.
I couldn't do anything for Ayu, either.
I didn't realize there was anything going on.
I made her a promise, and I forgot she ever existed.
I'm just repeating the same mistakes over and over.
I'm...

Makoto:
You used to talk to me like this before.
You remember that?
Yuichi, do you know about the trees in the north woods?
Each one forms a clear new ring every single year--a ring for every cold winter they had to endure.
Those trees are strong and healthy, the harsh conditions made them that way, made them able to withstand anything.
People are the same.
By living through pain and suffering, we become stronger.
Understand?
Look, if you made a promise with someone, then you have to keep it, okay?

Yuichi:
Uh, Makoto?

Makoto:
Dear Yuichi, I'm going out for a bit.
Please leave the key in the mailbox.
If you're hungry, please feel free to microwave whatever you can find in the fridge.

Yuichi:
Is this Kaori?
So you... you stayed with her all night?
I'm sorry.
But I think I need a little bit more time away.
Thanks, I appreciate it.

You've gotta be kidding.

Ayu:
I'm really sorry, Yuichi.
I don't think we'll be able to meet again.

Yuichi:
We promised, didn't we?

-- Eyecatch --

Clock:
Meow. Good morning, sleepy-head!
It's time to eat breakfast.
And it's time to go to school today.

Yuichi:
Today's Sunday, isn't it?

Ayu:
Oh, hello, good morning, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Is that you, Ayu?
What in the world are you doing here?

Ayu:
Well, that's a kind of weird question to ask.
Ms. Akiko says I'm a member of this family, too.
So that's what I'm doing here.

Yuichi:
Yeah, you're right.
I guess that makes sense.

Ayu:
I'm excited.
Ms. Akiko said she was going to teach me how to make cookies today.

Yuichi:
Sounds like she just wants to waste her time.

Ayu:
Uguu.
Hey, that isn't true!

Yuichi:
How much are you gonna bet that your little cookies turn out as hard as rocks again?

Ayu:
The last brack turned out like that because I didn't know how to make them.
But today Ms. Akiko's gonna teach me so those'll be better.

Yuichi:
Don't you ever give her too much of a hard time, okay?

Ayu:
Oh, of course, I won't do that.

Good morning!

Akiko:
A very good morning to you two, Ayu and Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Good morning, everybody.

Nayuki:
I hope that both of you're having a perfectly pleasant morning, Yuichi and Ayu.

Yuichi:
You have a track practicing again today.
They sure are working you hard.

Nayuki:
They're working me hard...

Akiko:
So, Ayu, once everybody finish their breakfast and I clear away the dishes, we'll start making cookies, okay?

Ayu:
Yay, and once we've finished, you're gonna try some, right?

Yuichi:
You couldn't pay me enough.

Ayu:
Uguu!
A simple "yes" or "no" would've been sufficient.

Akiko:
These cookies will be different from the ones before.

Ayu:
That's right!

Yuichi:
Well, then let's just say that if they look and smell good when they come out of the oven, I'll give it one try.

Ayu:
For real?

Yuichi:
But that's only if they look and smell good, got it?

Ayu:
Mm-mm. I'm really gonna try my best.
Get ready.
I'm gonna make some of the best cookies you've ever tasted in your whole life.



Yuichi:
Still here, still in the clearing.
Didn't I already go through all this before?
Seems like I spent half my time waiting for her.
Although I guess, back then I was waiting for her on that bench.

Ayu:
The thing that really makes me happy is that the person I was waiting for finally showed up!
That alone makes me feel like all the waiting was worth it.
If you can keep on liking me no matter how ridiculous I am, I think that...
I think that there's probably nothing that can make me stop liking you no matter what else happens.

Yuichi:
I really do like you.
I hope that somehow you know that.

Ayu:
I like you too, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Then why... why did you say you won't be able to see me anymore.

Ayu:
Because there's no more time left.
So I... I came to say good-bye to you today.

Yuichi:
And I came here to give you that thing you lost.

Ayu:
You found it!
Did you do that for me?

Yuichi:
It wasn't easy.
Seriously...

Ayu:
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
You're really late, Ayu.

Ayu:
Oh, no, I'm not, remember?
In our school, we can come whenever we want to.

Yuichi:
Oh, yeah. That's right.

Ayu:
Mmhmm.

Yuichi:
So, we meet again.

Ayu:
Yeah...

Yuichi:
Is this really... Does this really have to be good-bye?

Ayu:
Yeah...

Yuichi:
But why can't you just stay out here forever?

Ayu:
No...

Yuichi:
But I...
Then I guess... I guess you'd better tell me what your third wish is now.
I promised you, didn't I?
That I would grant three wishes.
So please go ahead.
At least let me do this one last thing for you.

Ayu:
Well, let's see...
Oh, I think I've got it now.
I'm ready to tell you my final wish if you're ready to hear it.
Yuichi...
I want you to please... I want you to please... forget I ever existed.
I want you to act like you never met a crazy girl named Ayu in the first place.
Please just forget all about me.
Could you do that for me?
Uguu... Forget me.

Yuichi:
Are you sure that's what you really want?
Are you really wanting for me to forget you?
Seriously, is that what you want?

Ayu:
Oh, yes!
Because I don't have anything left to wish for.
I got to eat lots of taiyaki even though I thought I'd never get to eat it again.
It was better than I had remembered it.
That's why... That's why... you've got to forget about me forever.

Yuichi...
I... I'm not a kid anymore.

Yuichi:
Of course you're still a kid.

Ayu:
That's just... it isn't true.

Yuichi:
Everything you do is impulsive.
You cause trouble for the ones who love you without realizing.

Ayu:
Uguu...

Yuichi:
And then you... you try to take everything on by yourself--the weight of the world on your tiny shoulders.
You're not alone.
You don't have to be alone.
I can't grant that wish.
I won't.

Ayu:
Yuichi...

Yuichi:
There's no way I could ever forget you, so don't ask me that.

Ayu:
Then can I have another wish?
I think that I'd like my final wish to be...

Yuichi:
I couldn't hear that, Ayu.
Ayu?

Ayu:
Oh, Yuichi, is my body still... warm like it's supposed to be?

Yuichi:
Of course it is.

Ayu:
I'm so glad.

Yuichi:
Ayu...



Ayu:
A dream... and I am a dreamer...
Repeating the same everyday life over and over again.
Wishing for a morning that will never ever end.
Then coming back... to the same old dream.
Red and white. Cold, warm and sad.
And then I repeat the same everyday life.
I knew this a long time ago, for many years now.
While drifting in an endless dream...
Hoping for a dawn, that I knew would never come.
Always I'm at the same place.
On a crowded street devoid of sounds, faceless people come and go.
Not one of them notices a child sitting all alone on the bench by the train station.
I'm waiting for someone.
I'm waiting for him.
It's someone who I know won't come.
Someone who I know I'll never see again.
For many years, I've waited.
And I go on waiting in this recurring dream... for a dawn that will never come...
But still... But still...



Nayuki:
Yuichi...
I've been looking for you.

Yuichi:
Yeah, sorry to make you worry.

Nayuki:
Funny, that's just what I wanted to say to you.

Yuichi:
Nayuki, I... I've always depended on you, acted like a baby.
I'm sorry.

Nayuki:
I'm the one who's sorry.
I said some awful things to you and... and I didn't mean them.

Yuichi:
Nayuki, I don't know what to say.

Nayuki:
Let's just call it even, okay?

Yuichi:
Even...

Nayuki:
Mmhmm.
Let's just forget about this.

Yuichi:
Did you ever hear about her from the hospital?

Nayuki:
Uh-huh.

Yuichi:
I see...

Nayuki:
Yuichi...
From now on, I'm gonna be stronger.
Yuichi, you look really sad right now.

Yuichi:
It must just be the light out here.

Nayuki:
I need you to hang in there, Yuichi.
Promise me you will?
And what will you have to do if you break your promise?

Yuichi:
I'll get you a strawberry sundae.

Nayuki:
That's not enough.
What kind of a girl do you think I am that if I forgive you for a sundae?
Now we can do this, Yuichi, I promise.

Yuichi:
Yeah, the two of us will do it together.

Nayuki:
Mmhmm.

Ayu:
A dream... The day the dream ends...
It ends like snow melting and disappearing into the spring sunshine.
It ends like a person's face starts to change as he gets older.
It ends like memories growing fainter over an eternity of time...
The long... long dream has finally come to an end.
Granting one final wish... before it disappears.
Just one wish...
Just one...
My final wish... will be...
