  A girl:
A dream... I'm in a dream.
 It's the same one as always.
 The same scene repeating itself over and over again.
 As I slowly drift off to sleep, I wish for only one thing:
 That I'll close my eyes, and the next time I open them, that the scene will finally change.



Clock:
Meow!
Good morning, sleepy-head!
It's time to eat breakfast!
And it's time to go to school today!

Yuichi:
N-Nayuki?!


Clock:
Wakey, wakey!
Meow!
Good morning, sleepy-head!
It's time to eat breakfast!
And it's time to go to school today!

Yuichi:

 Ugh... cold!

Nayuki!
Hey Nayuki!
You okay? I'm opening the door!
Nayuki, wake up and turn those off!

Nayuki:
Later...

Yuichi:
Don't give me "later"! Just turn 'em off!
Nayuki!!
Wake up, you hear me! Wake up...!

Nayuki:
Hey, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
What is wrong with you?

Nayuki:
Good morning, Yu... ichi.

Yuichi:
Hey! Don't you go back to sleep on me!



Yuichi:
So have you always had a tough time getting out of bed?

Akiko:
So, Yuichi, you're excited about starting school today?

Yuichi:
Yeah, I mean a new school's always exciting.

Nayuki:
Hey, how come you don't have any jelly?

Yuichi:
I'm not really a big fan of sweet stuff.

Akiko:
I might have a jam for ya that's not so sweet...

Nayuki:
Huh...!
Thanks for the breakfast, Mom!

Yuichi:
You mean you're done already?

Nayuki:
Oh, no. I just can't eat another bite.

Akiko:
Here, Yuichi.
Try some of this on your toast!

Nayuki:
Well, I should probably go and finish getting ready for school.

Yuichi:
Well, I guess she won't mind if I finish hers...

Akiko:
Would you like me to put a little bit of this on there for you?

Yuichi:
If it's not sweet, I'm game.

Akiko:
I think you're gonna like it quite a lot.

Yuichi:
Thanks! I can't wait to try it.

Akiko:
So? How is it?

Yuichi:
Um, what kind of jam is this?

Akiko:
That's a secret.

Yuichi:
It has a, uh... really unique flavor...
I must say I've never tasted anything like it.

Akiko:
It's my own secret recipe.
I may be the only one in the world who makes it.

Yuichi:
But... this stuff is jelly, right?

Akiko:
What else would it be?

Nayuki:
Come on, Yuichi! Let's go.

Akiko:
There's still one more piece of toast if you want it.

Yuichi:
Uh, I'm sorry, but we really have to go.

Akiko:
That's too bad.
Guess this is for me.

Nayuki and Yuichi:
We'll see you later!

Akiko:
Have a good day, you two!
Oh! I almost forgot, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Uh, you almost forgot what?

Akiko:
I was planning on making some oden for dinner tonight.
Would you be a doll and pick up some ingredients on your way home?

Yuichi:
Oh, sure. I think I can do that.



Yuichi:
Hey, what kind of jam was that?

Nayuki:
She never told me what's in it either.
 But whatever it is, it seems to be Mom's favorite thing to put on toast.

Yuichi:
Well, your mom's cooking is usually really great.
 I hope she doesn't try and give me that stuff again.

Nayuki:
I'm sure she will.
 All you can do is prepare for when that day comes.

Yuichi:
Man, is it this cold here everyday?

Nayuki:
Today's actually on the warm side.

Yuichi:
Then I'm moving back home to my parents' house.

Nayuki:
No! You can't go now!

Nayuki:
Yuichi, do you remember this neighborhood?

Yuichi:
No, not really.

Nayuki:
Well, that's okay.
 I'm sure you will eventually.
 Hang in there, okay?

Yuichi:
Does it really matter if I can't remember some random neighborhood I haven't seen in seven years?

Nayuki:
I think it'd be sad not to remember anything.

Yuichi:
Yeah, well, maybe if you know what you're missing.

Nayuki:
But I think if there's even one person out there who wants you to remember, you should at least try.
 Don't you think so, Yuichi?
 Hm?
 Ah... that's not good?
 I don't know if we'll be able to make it on time.

Yuichi:
Then how come we're just standing around here dilly-dallying?
 I don't wanna be late on my first day at a new school!

Nayuki:
You haven't answered my question.

Yuichi:
Let's get a move on!

Nayuki:
Yuichi!



Yuichi:
I'm exhausted!

Nayuki:
I can't believe we actually made it on time!

Yuichi:
Hey, what gives?
How come you're not out of breath?

Nayuki:
Because. I'm captain of the track team, duh.

Students:
Good morning, Minase!

Good morning, Minase!

Nayuki:
Oh, morning!

Kaori:
Good morning, Nayuki! Aizawa!

Kitagawa:
Did you herniate yourself or something?

Yuichi:
Hey, it's the servant boy from yesterday.

Kitagawa:
I'm nobody's servant, dilweed! 

Kaori:
Could you do me a favor? Thanks!

Kitagawa:
Ah, sure.

Nayuki:
Wouldn't it be cool if we were all in the same class together?

Yuichi:
I guess so.



Yuichi:
I'm Yuichi Aizawa. I look forward to meeting all of you.

Nayuki:
Hey, Yuichi!

Kitagawa:
Wouldn't you know he'd wind up in our stinking class?

Teacher:
You could sit right next to Minase.
She'll be happy to help you with any questions.

Yuichi:
Right.

Teacher:
All right, everyone.
Today's our first day back and we have a new member in our class.
I hope you'll start the year with a fresh new outlook.
The seniors will be graduating...

Kaori:
I didn't expect you to introduce yourself like such a bore.

Yuichi:
If there's a better way of making an introduction, I'd like you to show me sometime.

Nayuki:
Yuichi! We're gonna have lots of fun, huh?

Teacher:
Hey! Pay attention back there!
That's it for general announcements.
The school's opening ceremony is today, so you'll be dismissed early.
Take off the holiday daze and be prepared to start classes tomorrow.
Misaka?

Kaori:
Stand up! 
Bow!

Nayuki:
Yuichi! School's out for today.

Yuichi:
Yeah, I kind of got that when the bell rang.

Kaori:
Nayuki, doesn't track practice start today?

Nayuki:
Yeah, but the track's covered with snow.
So we're gonna have to run in the gym today.

Kitagawa:
Wanna stop someplace on our way home?

Kaori:
I've got a meeting. We're in the clubroom today.
Well, later Nayuki!

Kitagawa:
Okay! I'll just wait around for you till your meeting's done.
Hey! You don't mind do you?
It'll be fun, I swear!

Yuichi:
So, I'm gonna be hanging out with those two?



Yuichi:
You sure do keep busy.
You had track practice all winter break, and you don't even get a day off for the first day of school.
You're captain too, right?

Nayuki:
Yeah, it's a lot of work.
But running's the only thing I'm really good at.

Yuichi:
I seriously doubt that's the truth.

Nayuki:
Yeah? What else, then?

Yuichi:
Well, let's see...
You're pretty good at sleeping while standing up.

Nayuki:
That's supposed to be a talent?

Yuichi:
I guess it's more like a... special ability.

Nayuki:
Um, I'm not sure if that's it either.

Yuichi:
Uh, hey Nayuki.
Would you mind not telling the people at school that I'm staying at your house with you and your mom?

Nayuki:
Huh? But why not?

Yuichi:
Well, it's kinda weird. I don't want people to start talking, you know?

Nayuki:
Ooh...
Sorry! It's too late.

Yuichi:
What!

Nayuki:
I already told everyone about it this morning.

Yuichi:
Ah!
You did not!

Nayuki:
He-he-he!
Ah... Ahhh!

Yuichi:
Nayuki!

Sayuri:
 And then... hm?

Nayuki:
Huh?
I am so sorry!

Yuichi:
Oh my god. Are you guys okay?

Sayuri:
Sayuri's fine, thanks. 
Mai? You okay?

Nayuki:
I didn't hurt anyone, did I?

Mai:
 I'm fine.

Sayuri:
What about you?
You aren't hurt, are you?

Nayuki:
Oh... uh, no.
I'm really sorry I fell on you guys.

Mai:
 What?

Yuichi:
Oh, uh... it's nothing.

Mai:
 Sayuri, come.

Sayuri:
Okay. 
Please excuse us. We gotta go.
Take care, now!

Yuichi:
Blue ribbons... I guess they're seniors.



Yuichi:
Maybe I'll just poke around the school for a little bit.
It's not like I've got stuff to do at home anyway.

Nayuki:
But, is that a good idea?
I mean, the school is pretty huge, so it'd be easy for you to get lost. 

Yuichi:
Nah, I think I'll be fine. Don't worry about me.

Nayuki:
Suit yourself. I'll see you later, then!

Yuichi:
Hey, Nayuki. 
Have a good practice, 'kay?

Nayuki:
Right. Sure will.
Bye, now!

Yuichi:
Man. She can be such a little worry-wart.



Yuichi:
I am officially lost...
Who made this place so freakin' big!!
Another dead end...
I wonder if anybody eats lunch up here?
I should be able to see where their field is from up here.
Wargh...! 
Come on! Can't a guy get a break?
The courtyard...
That must mean that the track's on the other side...
That's it. I'm going to grow old and die in this place.

Kaori:
Aizawa? What are you doing here? 

Yuichi:
And that's when I turned around and saw Kaori Misaka.

Kaori:
Uh... you are aware that I can hear you, right?

You were acting a little bit suspicious, so I thought maybe you were an enemy agent sent here to infiltrate the school and spy on us.

Yuichi:
Nah, just an ordinary lost transfer student.

Kaori:
Why don't you just ask someone for directions?

Yuichi:
Because I still would have gotten lost in this crazy labyrinth school even if I had.

Kaori:
It's pretty funny - you're exactly like Nayuki told us you'd be.

Yuichi:
What?

Kaori:
She used to tell us about you all the time.
She said you're kind of a weirdo.

Yuichi:
Weirdo? What do you mean?

Kaori:
Oh... maybe you'd better ask her about that.

Yuichi:
Uh, right. 

Kaori:
I don't think I've ever seen your cousin quite as happy as she was when she saw you be in our class.

Yuichi:
Oh yeah?

Kaori:
Definitely.
She was just beaming when you and the teacher walked in.



Yuichi:
Ugh...
I thought I'd be in there forever.

Kaori:
It's not that bad.
Huh?

Kitagawa:
Kaori!!
Is your meeting over yet?

Kaori:
Oh, darn it!
 I forgot all about meeting up with Kitagawa.
 Erm... no biggie.
 Oh well. I'll see you tomorrow!

Yuichi:
So that's Kaori Misaka, huh...
She seems pretty... alright.



Yuichi:
And now to get those oden ingredients.

Ayu:
Get out of the way!
 Move it!
 Please move or I'll hit you!

Yuichi:
Okay!
 Move towards the hand you hold chopsticks!
 Huh?

Ayu:
Uh, Uguu...

Yuichi:
Why didn't you dodge the other way?

Ayu:
Uguu, I'm left-handed!

Yuichi:
All right now, that's just ridiculous.

Ayu:
Come on!
 We gotta run!

Yuichi:
Oh my God!
 You didn't do it again!

Ayu:
Shut up and keep running!

Yuichi:
Wait up!



Yuichi:
Ever since I got here, all I do is run around.

Ayu:
We sure are in the boondocks, aren't we?

Yuichi:
How come you're running away two days in a row?
 I thought that we paid the man yesterday.

Ayu:
We did.
 But then I bought more Taiyaki today.
 But... then I realized I didn't have my wallet again.

Yuichi:
Don't tell me there was another cat there today.

Ayu:
No, this time it was a stray dog.

Taiyaki Shop Owner:
 Hey! Get out of here, you!

Ayu:
Uguu!

Taiyaki Shop Owner:
No, no, no, come back!

Ayu:
So I sorta panicked and ran away.

Yuichi:


Ayu:
Uguu...

Ayu:
They're really good, aren't they!

Yuichi:
We're gonna have to apologize again for this later, okay?

Ayu:
Um.
 Hey, didn't we pass through here earlier?

Yuichi:
I don't know where we are.
 I'm just walking along with you.

Ayu:
Well, that can't be right, because I was just following you.
 I've never been to this neighborhood before.
 So, you don't know where we are either?

Yuichi:
Think about it.
 If you were asking directions, would you ask a local? 
Or would you ask some guy who just moved to this town the day before yesterday?

Ayu:
You're... new here?

Yuichi:
Yeah. Well, I used to visit as a kid.
 But that doesn't help us now.

Ayu:


Yuichi:
Huh?

Ayu:
I've been wondering ever since you introduced yourself to me yesterday.
 You have the same name.
 And he was a weird guy just like you.

Yuichi:
That's supposed to be a compliment?

Ayu:
You came back!
 I knew you would!
 You kept your promise after all these years.

Yuichi:
Ayu...?

Ayu:
Yup! I knew you'd remember!

Yuichi:
It's been a long time.

Ayu:
Yeah, yeah, it really has been, huh?
 It's so good to see you again! ... Ugh!

Yuichi:
Hey, you aren't hurt, are you, Ayu?
 That, uhh... may have been my fault when willing to take total responsibility for it.

Ayu:
Uguu...

Yuichi:
Oh, come on! Stop playing around, Ayu!
 I know it couldn't have hurt that bad!

Ayu:
Oh yeah!
 How would you know!

Yuichi:
Sorry, it was a conditioned response.

Ayu:
How could you?!
 You dodged my hug, Yuichi!

Yuichi:
Oh, I'm sorry.
 Are you all right?

Shiori:
Uh, yeah.

Ayu:
What's the matter?
 Are you okay?

Yuichi:
When you ran into the tree, you made all the snow fall down on her.
 That's all.

Ayu:
Don't you try and make it sound like it was all my fault!

Yuichi:
I'm stating a fact.

Ayu:


Yuichi:
Yeah, but you keep attacking me.
 So what was I supposed to do?

Ayu:
I wasn't attacking and you know it! Hmpf!
 That was supposed to be a very touching reunion scene.
 But you went and blew it!
 Uguu!
 Whatever. You know, I bet I'm the only person who's ever run into a tree trying to hug a friend they haven't seen in seven years!

Yuichi:
Well, congratulations on being the first.

Ayu:
What!
 I'm not happy about it!

Yuichi:
I think our friend here is getting a little bit bored with your nonsense talk.

Ayu:
That is not my fault!

Yuichi:
Huh. Need a hand?

Shiori:
Oh, thanks.

Yuichi:
Sorry for all this trouble.
 I don't know about that one there, but I'm your regular, friendly law-abiding citizen here to help.

Ayu:
Hey, I'm a regular law-abiding citizen, too!

Yuichi:
How do you figure that one?
 I mean law-abiding citizens don't dine and dash.

Ayu:
That was an accident!

Shiori:
Sorry, I should be helping.

Ayu:
Here.

Shiori:
Thank you so much for all your help.

Ayu:
Looks like you sure did a lot of shopping.

Shiori:
Well, I don't really get out of the house very often.
So when I do, I try to stock up.

Yuichi:
I don't have any issues with that - as long as you pay for everything you're getting.

Ayu:
Yuichi, I don't appreciate you making me sound like some kind of hardened criminal.

Yuichi:
Just tellin' the truth here.

Ayu:
I am a good person!

Yuichi:
Well that's weird, 'cause good people don't steal things.

Ayu:
Uguu...
 This reminds me of when we were kids.
 You used to always have fun giving me a hard time about this kind of stuff.
 It must have been destiny that brought us back together like this.

Yuichi:
Or maybe you just keep turning up like a bad card.

Ayu:
So hey, what grade are you in at school?

Shiori:
Me?
Uh, I'm a sophomore.

Ayu:
Oh, you're a year younger than me then, huh?

Yuichi:
Huh?!
 You can't possibly be in the same grade as I am!
 Because I thought that you... at first certain that you...

Ayu:
Because you thought what?

Yuichi:
You know, I'd rather not say.

Shiori:
Well, uh, my house is right over there, so I'm gonna...

Ayu:
Right!
 Guess we'll see you later!

Shiori:
Goodbye.

Yuichi:
Hey! Hold on a sec!

Shiori:
Huh?

Yuichi:
Could you please tell us how to get back to town?



Yuichi:
We're so sorry about this.

Ayu:
Ugu...

We sure did have a big adventure today, huh.

Yuichi:
Yeah, and whose fault would that be?

Ayu:
Even so, I was really happy today.
 Let's do this again.
 Promise me.

Yuichi:
Sure.

Ayu:
Awesome!
 Hey, let's pinky swear.
 You know, like when we were kids?

Yuichi:
Right.
 But you know you can't do it unless you take your mittens off.

Ayu:
Oh, yeah.
 Pinky swear.

Is something wrong?

Yuichi:
Uh, nothing. I'm okay.

Ayu:
Well, I guess I'll see you soon then!

Yuichi:
Wait!
 How am I supposed to get in touch with you?!

Ayu:
See ya!

Yuichi:
If I remember correctly, she's always been like this.
 Let's see... ingredients for oden...

Makoto:
You thought you could escape.

Yuichi:
Huh?

Makoto:
 I found you.
 But I'll never forgive you.

Yuichi:
Who are you?
 Be sure you're hatin' on the right guy here.

Makoto:
Don't dare question me, you puke!

Yuichi:
Okay, what do you think you're doing?

Makoto:
What do you think you're doing? Fight me like a man!!

Yuichi:
Is that all you've got, kid?

Makoto:
You're lucky I haven't eaten today, or otherwise I'd really be smacking you around right now...!

Yuichi:
Hey!
 Pull yourself together!
 You can't just pass out here on the sidewalk!
 Hey? Hello!
