  Every dream has an end...
No matter how nice the dream might be...
Or how scary it is...
Under your warm blanket, the dream comes to an abrupt end when mother shakes you awake.
Forever and ever...
The morning scene remains the same.
But now I...
I wonder... when the dreams began to never end...

Yuichi:
Come on.
 Stop crying already.
 What happened to make you so upset, huh?
 You think you can talk to me about it, Ayu Ayu?

Ayu:
Uguu...
 Ayu Ayu isn't my name.

Yuichi:
I was starting to worry that maybe you'd forgotten how to talk.
 I can't help you if you won't tell me what's wrong?
 Or let me guess.
 I look like your long-lost brother, is that it?
 Well, if I can't help, I guess I should take off then.
 Is that your stomach growling?
 Wow, I bet you're really hungry then, aren't you?

Ayu:
Mm-hm.

Yuichi:
Right.
 Then I'll go get you something to eat.
 Is there anything you'd like me to get?
 Oh come on.
 What food out there do you like more than anything?

Ayu:
Taiyaki.

Yuichi:
Then Taiyaki it is!
 Just wait here, I'll be back in a sec.

Ayu:
Okay.


「第４話　休日の奇想曲」


Yuichi:
Oh, good, I see you waited for me.

Ayui:
Well, you told me to, so that's what I did.

Yuichi:
 You'll be glad you did.
 Here.
 I'm gonna have one with you.

Ayu:
And it's still warm.

Yuichi:
I think Taiyaki tastes best right when it's out of the oven, don'tcha think?
It's really good!
 You should have one!

Ayu:
Why is it salty?

Yuichi:
You might have licked the spot where your tears were earlier.

Ayu:
But it's...it's delicious.

Yuichi:
I know, isn't it?

Woman:
Yeah, so when I saw them, I, like, just totally panicked!
You know what I mean?

Yuichi:
So, can you tell me why you were crying?
 Oh, that's okay.
 If you don't wanna talk about it, then I'm not gonna ask you anymore.
 Well, it's getting dark, so I'd better head home.
 See you around, Ayu Ayu.
 What's the matter?

Ayu:
My... my name's not Ayu Ayu.

Yuichi:
Oh... yeah, that's right.
 I'm gonna go now.
 You're gonna have to let me go first.

Ayu:
Taiyaki...

Yuichi:
Hm?

Ayu:
 Let's eat Taiyaki again sometime.

Yuichi:
So you liked it that much, did you?

Ayu:
 Hm.

Yuichi:
 Maybe we can get together and have some again.
 In that case, I'll wait for you at the benches in front of the station at the same time tomorrow.

Ayu:
You're not lying, are you?

Yuichi:
No, of course not.
 I'll definitely be there.

Ayu:
You promise?

Yuichi:
Well yeah, I'm giving you my word.

Ayu:
Pinky swear on it?

Yuichi:
Uh, we don't have to do any pinky stuff 'cuz I promised you that I'd be there.

Ayu:
Uguu...
 You won't pinky swear?

Yuichi:
Okay.

Ayu, Yuichi:
Pinky swear!

Yuichi:
Well, see you tomorrow, then.

Ayu:
Mm-hm.

 ...Good bye...

Yuichi:
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

Yuichi:
Ah!

Nayuki:
You are a liar.
