  Ayu:
Oh... Oh, gosh!
 I mean, I... I'm so sorry!

Yuichi:
Uh, don't apologize, dummy.

Ayu:
But... But Yuichi, I wasn't thinking about how you're feeling that I went and did that.

Yuichi:
I really do like you, Ayu.

Ayu:
Uh...

Yuichi:
So how do you think you feel about me?

Ayu:
I, um..., I've really liked you ever since the first time we met when we were just kids.
 Um... If you can keep on liking me, no matter how ridiculous I am, I think, I think there's probably nothing that can make me stop liking you no matter what!
 Un...
 I don't have much experience, but I've got a pretty good idea that so this whole liking thing's supposed to work.
 So, um... God! What am I talking about?
 I guess I should really stop talking now, shouldn't I?

Yuichi:
No, don't apologize, I feel the same.

Ayu:
Uh...

Yuichi:
We spent seven long years apart, so I figured you and I have a whole lot of lost time to make up for.

Ayu:
Mmhmm, thank you, Yuichi.
 I'll meet you here at the bench again tomorrow after school, just like old times.

Yuichi:
Okay, just like old times.



Akiko:
Welcome home, you two.

Ayu:
Mmhmm.
 We didn't do anything.

Yuichi:
Um, so, you're helping aunt Akiko today, Nayuki.

Nayuki:
Oh, yeah.
 I see you and Ayu met up after school.
 Did you find what she was looking for?

Yuichi:
Oh, no, not yet. Right?

Ayu:
O-Oh, right.

Akiko:
Uh, well, why don't the two of you go change?

Nayuki:
And the bath's ready if you wanna take one.

Yuichi:
I think I might do that after dinner.
 Why don't you go on ahead and take one now, Ayu?

Ayu:
Uh, mmm, thanks for offering, but after I change, I think I'll come down and help with dinner.

Nayuki:
Don't worry about that.
 Now that my meet's over, I figured I'd better put in some time trying to be a good daughter.

Yuichi:
That's right.
 A mother should have some alone time with her daughter every once in a while.

Ayu:
Right. Sorry about that.

Nayuki:
It's okay, don't worry about it.

Yuichi:
Let's get out of here.

Akiko:
Well, let's get started.

Nayuki:
Uh, mmhmm.

Akiko:
It feels like a long time since you and I made dinner together, doesn't it?

Nayuki:
Yeah.

Akiko:
What do you say we make some of your favorite foods tonight.

Nayuki:
Really?


Ayu:
Uuh... Ah!

Piro:
Meow!



Ayu:
You are always late.

Yuichi:
I'm sorry.
 I was stuck at the house getting ready for tomorrow.

Ayu:
Getting ready?

Yuichi:
Yeah, you know, going through all my stuff and packing.

Ayu:
Oh...

Yuichi:
Hey, what are you looking at me like that for?
 We still have today and part of tomorrow.

Ayu:
Mm...

This really is a beautiful spot.
 Nice breeze too.
 Sunsets are pretty, you know, but I wish I could've seen it at another time of day.

Yuichi:
Yeah.

Ayu:
Yuichi, there're still two more left, right?
 Wishes I mean.
 You told me you would grant me any wish if you possibly could, remember?

Yuichi:
Well, of course.
 I mean I promised you, didn't I?

Ayu:
Are you sure you still want to?

Yuichi:
Nothing's changed since yesterday.

Ayu:
But are you sure that you're sure?

Yuichi:
Mmhmm.
 I'm really truly sure I'm sure.

Ayu:
Mm. All right then...



Nayuki:
Good morning, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Whooaaa!

Nayuki:
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little bit?

Yuichi:
What's going on here?
 I thought you didn't have morning practices anymore.

Akiko:
They have apparently, they're already starting practices for the next meet.

Nayuki:
Okay, I've gotta go.
 See you later in class, Yuichi.

Akiko:
Do you think you'll be home early today?

Nayuki:
Yeah, probably.

Yuichi:
Hmm...



Yuichi:
You're going to school awfully early this morning too.

Ayu:
I thought it might be a nice change of pace if I was the first one there.

Yuichi:
You're going to be first, huh?
 You must like your school.

Ayu:
It's a lot of fun.

Yuichi:
What's so fun about it?

Ayu:
Well, let's see...
 I get to see friends that I never see anywhere other than school.
 So, that's always fun.

Yuichi:
Is that how it is?

Ayu:
Yup! That's pretty much how it is!
 Okay, this is where I say goodbye.
 Don't you dare forget about your promise to meet me after school, okay?

Yuichi:
Okay, but don't go off with any strangers in the mean time, even if he offers you taiyaki.

Ayu:
For the last time, I'm not a little kid!

Yuichi:
I heard somewhere that you're still a little kid until you can easily solve a cubic equation.
 Even know what a cubic equation is, Ayu?

Ayu:
Uh, uguu...
 No, not really...

Yuichi:
Good, I don't either.

Ayu:
Ah!



Yuichi:
Hm?
 What a beautiful day.



Ayu:
Hm?
You're late as usual.

Yuichi:
I'm sorry, I had a clean-up duty at class today.

Ayu:
Oh, okay.
At least you were working.

Yuichi:
It's gonna get dark pretty soon, we'd better hurry.
Where do you wanna go?

Ayu:
You know, I wanna go to that place!

Yuichi:
Which place is that?

Ayu:
Ah, um...
Yeah, I'm not sure what I'm talking about either.

Yuichi:
You mean the shopping district?
We have spend a lot of time there searching for whatever you lost.

Ayu:
Oh, yeah.
That must be it.

Yuichi:
Okay, then, here, grab hold of my hand.
Let's go.

Ayu:
Oh... Oh, I couldn't.
I'd be too embarrassed.

Yuichi:
You can kiss me with a million people around but you're too embarrassed to hold my hand?

Ayu:
Oh, well, that's just a... Um...

Yuichi:
Suit yourself.
So hurry up or I'm gonna have to leave you behind.

Ayu:
Hmm... I guess... I could be... okay with holding hands...

Yuichi:
Uh... Ah.

Ayu:
It seems a little warmer now, doesn't it?

Yuichi:
Hm, uh...

I guess we couldn't find it again, huh.

Ayu:
I'm starting to think maybe it would be better if we never find it at all.
Maybe what I'm looking for is something I don't need if I'm feeling happy already.
So, maybe it's okay we didn't find it.
I figure if we ever get to the point where I need it again, then that's when I should go looking for it.

Yuichi:
Make sense.

You know, Ayu, don't take this the wrong way, but you're kind of freak.

Ayu:
Okay, I'm confused.
Now how am I not supposed to take that the wrong way?

Yuichi:
I'm just saying, you're like a weird spazzy little boy lost in the supermarket.

Ayu:
Uguu...
I know my way around the supermarket?

Yuichi:
Huh...
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
You're in your own world.
I mean it's... it's mind-boggling.
You even got your own weird lost boy language.

Ayu:
Yuichi, why are you calling me a boy?

Yuichi:
Not just a boy.
I said a spazzy little lost boy.
Hmm...
I should add "crazy" at that.

Ayu:
Hey!

Yuichi:
Come on, I wanna see if you can do it.
Try and say something normal.
It's an important skill to have.

Ayu:
Okay, let's see... Uh...
Yuichi, this is just stupid!

Yuichi:
Ha ha ha...
You can't do it!

Ayu:
You're mean!
You still mean to give me a chance!

Yuichi:
Here I'm sorry.
Okay, give it another try.
I promise I won't laugh.

Any:
I'm not going to play your dumb game.

Yuichi:
Come on now, you can be crazy forever.
Think of the future, Ayu, you're gonna have to get a job someday, aren't ya?
See when you're on a job interview and you open you mouth, "Uguu, I'm Ayu. I think that taiyaki is really awesome."

Ayu:
Uguu...
Um... That is not what I would say.
Um... You're a stupid head.

Yuichi:
Yeah, I see I don't think that I'd hire you.

Ayu:
Do you get some sick pleasure out of making fun of me?

Yuichi:
Wow, hey hey, there's nothing sick about it.

Ayu:
You called me a boy.

Yuichi:
A spazzy little lost boy.

Ayu, Yuichi:
Uguu...



Nayuki:
Just as I thought, it's really cute on you.

Yuichi:
Hm?

Ayu:
Isn't it a little bit big?

Nayuki:
No, I think it's just fine.
 It looks great, uh...
 Come in!

Yuichi:
What's going on in... Ah!

Ayu:
Aha, well, what do you think, Yuichi?

Yuichi:
Ah... are you gonna switch schools now?

Nayuki:
No, silly, it's my uniform.
 Doesn't it look good on her?

Ayu:
Nayuki's just let me try it on for fun.

Nayuki:
Yeah, I mean since Ayu's school doesn't have a uniform.

Ayu and Nayuki:
Right?

Yuichi:
Uh... She's way too small to wear your clothes.

Ayu:
Uguu...

Nayuki:
Can you be supported for once?

Ayu:
Mm, whenever you and Nayuki talk about your school, it sounds like so much fun.
 And I think your uniforms are pretty adorable too.

Yuichi:
Yeah, well, your school sounds like a big joke.
 I don't think I've ever seen you studying like ever.

Ayu:
If you pay careful attention in class, you still get by even if you don't study at home.

Nayuki:
Your school's somewhere up the forest on the outskirts of town, isn't it?

Ayu:
Yup, that's exactly where it is.
 And it's on a hill.

Nayuki:
Huh...
I wonder what would possess someone to build a school all the way out there?



Yuichi:
Hm?
 What the...?!

Ayu:
Uguu...
 It's totally freezing!

Yuichi:
Are you all right?
 Sorry, but I just had no idea that you'd be out there.

Ayu:
That's okay.
 After all, I'm the one who was trying to break into your room.

Yuichi:
I get it.
 You're a burglar today, is that it?

Ayu:
Whatever.
 I didn't know that burglars were supposed to knock.

Yuichi:
Well, you sure weren't being that sneaky.

Ayu:
Look, all I wanted to do was just talk to you.

Yuichi:
Then why didn't you just walk down the hall, coocoo brain?

Ayu:
Because I didn't want my footsteps to wake up Nayuki, that's why.

Yuichi:
Come on, there's no way any one's footsteps could wake up Nayuki.

Ayu:
Oh, yeah, I guess you've probably got a point there.

Yuichi:
You such a dummy.

Ayu:
Uguu... Come on, you don't have to be so mean to me.

Yuichi:
No way.
 Your innocence is one of the things that I like the best about you.
 So I guess that makes me a little bit of a dummy myself.

Ayu:
Really?

Yuichi:
Mmhmm.
 And I like you're such a big old scaredy-cat.

Ayu:
I was scared just now.
 But I wanted to see you anyway.
 It was so lonely sitting there in my room by myself.

Yuichi:
Are you cold out here?

Ayu:
No, what about you, Yuichi?

Yuichi:
You know, I think I'm starting to get used to how cold it is here all the time.
 I used to be so annoyed that I had to adapt to the weather.
 A lot has happened to me since I transferred here.

Ayu:
If you had transferred to my school instead, we could've seen each other between classes.

Yuichi:
You know, I think I'd like to see it.
 I'm pretty curious to see what your school is like.

Ayu:
I can show it to you if you wanna come with me tomorrow when we meet.

Yuichi:
Yeah, sounds good.
 I can't wait.

Ayu:
Okay, then,
 I'll be waiting for you at that old bench in front of the station.
 You won't be disappointed, Yuichi.
 I promise.

Nayuki:
Well, I'm off!

Ayu:
See you later!

Akiko:
Watch out for the cars, Nayuki!

Yuichi:
Are you leaving the house to go somewhere too, aunt Akiko?

Akiko:
Uh-huh.
 Ayu, remember to lock the place up, okay?

Ayu:
Sure!
 I'll see you tonight.

Yuichi:
Don't mess around.
 You don't wanna be late for school, do you?

Ayu:
I'm gonna be fine.

Yuichi:
You're leaving awfully early today, huh?

Akiko:
Yeah, I've got a lot to do at the office.

Yuichi:
Come to think of it, I have no idea what she does for a living.

Akiko:
Yuichi, I know you don't remember a lot of what happened to you when you were a child.

Yuichi:
No.

Akiko:
Like what happened right before you left last time.

Yuichi:
No. Pretty much blank.

Akiko:
Right, uh...

Yuichi:
I mean I haven't been out here since then.
 And it was also so long time ago.
 So, why did you ask?

Akiko:
Oh, it's nothing that important.
 It's just... well...
 It's just that they cut out a big tree, is all.

Yuichi:
Yeah?



Nayuki:
Hey, Yuichi, the bell rang.

Yuichi:
Oh, good.
 Means it must be time for me to go to school.

Nayuki:
Hm?
 Oh, yeah... Right.

Ayu:
Can I ask you something?

Yuichi:
Mmhmm.

Ayu:
If I said, just for the sake of argument, if I would tell you that you were my first love, Yuichi, what do you think you would say to that?

Yuichi:
I would tell you to take it back.

Ayu:
Why is that?

Yuichi:
Because they say the first love is usually unrequited.

Ayu:
Hey, Yuichi.
 Did you just turn away from me because you said something really embarrassing?

Yuichi:
Just leave me alone.

Ayu:
Oh, my gosh.
 I think you're blushing!

Yuichi:
Come on, it's probably just the sunset.

Ayu:
Mm-hm.
 Hey, I wanna know all about your first love, Yuichi.
 Can you tell me about it?

Yuichi:
I'm not sure if I can call it my first love or not, but I remember that there used to be this older girl that I admired a lot.

Ayu:
An older girl, wow!

Yuichi:
But how it ended... I don't really remember how it ended.
 For some reason, I get the feeling something really sad happened, but I can't put my finger on it.

Ayu:
Something sad happened?

Yuichi:
Oh, never mind.
 I'm just talking to myself.

Ayu:
Uh...

Yuichi:
It doesn't matter anyway because all of that's in the past.
 Ayu, are you happy right now?

Ayu:
Mm, yeah. I'm really happy.
 But you know, sometimes that makes me uneasy.

Yuichi:
Uneasy?

Ayu:
Sometimes happiness scares me, and makes me anxious.
 I don't know why exactly.
 Sometimes I start to worry, is this reality or is it only a dream?

Yuichi:
Hm? You think too much.

Ayu:
Yeah.

Yuichi:
Besides, it's kinda weird for me to hear you talk so seriously about something.

Ayu:
Uguu...
 Who asked you anyway?

Yuichi:
Come on, I'm not like I was seven years ago.
 Even when winter ends and spring comes, when the snow melts and little buds start popping up all over, I'll still be by your side, Ayu.

Ayu:
Now I know how you feel, it's weird listening to you talk seriously too.

Yuichi:
Sorry about that.

You're gonna make your taiyaki taste so salty.

Ayu:
Uguu... Who cares?
 It reminds me of good times.



Yuichi:
So how far is it to your school anyway?

Ayu:
Umm... It's about a half hour away.

Yuichi
Holy cow, it's way out there.

Yuichi:
We should get going.
 Looks it's gonna snow again.

Yuichi:
Is it on the other side of all these trees?
 Sure is in an inconvenient location.
 Hey, is there really gonna be a school out here or you're just kidding around?
 Ayu?

Ayu:
It's out here.
 Just follow me!
 You'll see!

Yuichi:
Ayu!

Yuichi:
Hey, are you absolutely sure that we're going the right direction?

Ayu:
Of course, this is the right way.
 This is the school I've been going to every single morning.
 Even today, I went to class and... and I saw all my friends.

Yuichi:
Uh...

Ayu:
You'll see it.
 You can almost see it.
 Just once we get to the clearing...
 Here it is!

Akiko:
It's nothing that important.
 It's just...
 It's just that they cut out a big tree, is all.

Yuichi:
Oh...

Ayu:
No... way...
 How come... It's... How come...
 I know this place... My school...
 It was right here this morning.
 At this place...
 But I... But I'm right here!
And it isn't...
 I don't... understand!
 Am I not supposed to be here at all?
 No! It isn't true!
 This... can't be happening!

Yuichi:
Ayu!

Ayu:
I had school today too, you know.
 I swear it!
 Ah!

Yuichi:
Ayu, tell me what is happening out here!
 Just what is going on?!

Ayu:
I think... I think I just have to find it.

Yuichi:
Hey, Ayu!

Yuichi:
Ayu, wait!
 Ayu!

Yuichi:
Ayu...

Yuichi:
Ayu, what in the world are you doing?
 Answer me!
 What are you doing?

Ayu:
Looking for something.

Yuichi:
You're looking for something?
 And you think it's buried around here somewhere?

Ayu:
Yeah.

Yuichi:
We'll then come back. We'll look for it tomorrow when the sun's out again, okay?

Ayu:
I can't.
 Because... the morning may never come again for me.

Yuichi:
Huh...

Ayu:
What are you doing?

Yuichi:
If you gotta find it, then I might as well stay out here and help you dig.

Ayu:
Thanks.

Yuichi:
Then, let's hurry up and find it whatever it is.

Yuichi:
Well, we made quite a mess, don't you think?

Ayu:
Yeah.

Yuichi:
We come back and look for it again tomorrow.
 So, uh, why don't I just get out our bags?

Ayu:
I'm sorry, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Hey, don't worry, it's okay.

Ayu:
I don't think we'll ever be able to meet again.

Yuichi:
Ah!

Ayu:
Even though we've finally been reunited... after seven long years...
 I'm really sorry, Yuichi...

Yuichi:
What the hell are you talking about...
 Ayu!

Ayu:
I don't think we'll ever be able to meet again.
 Even though we've finally been reunited after seven long years...
 I'm really sorry, Yuichi...
