  When did I realize that it was only a dream, anyway?
Was it long ago, or just a few moments?
All sense of time is hazy and cloudy.
I'm not sure if time is really passing.
My dream is of the day when I'll finally awaken...



Yuichi:
Cold... heavy...

Nayuki:
Welcome home!
You didn't forget the oden ingredients, did you...?
That's a little more than I expected.

Yuichi:
Huh?
Was that supposed to be some humor?
Because it kind of missed.

Akiko:
My!
I'm not sure she'll fit in the pot.

Yuichi:
Great, whenever the two of you are done with jokes, can you help me here?



Nayuki:
So what happened to her, Yuichi?

Yuichi:
I was coming out of the grocery store and she just attacked me.
And then she passed out.

Nayuki:
Uh, I think I need more details.
A complete stranger wouldn't just attack you.

Yuichi:
I know it doesn't make sense - I'm as confused as you are.

Akiko:
In any case, I think we should try to wake her up. 
It's already dark, so I'm sure her family's wondering why she's not home yet.

Yuichi:
You got a point...
Hey! Time to wake up!
Hey... hey!!
Time for dinner!

???:
When is dinner?!
I'm hungry! Need food! Starving!
Who the heck are you people?

Nayuki:
Hey, uh, that's our line, don'tcha think?

???:
Hmm?


--OP--


???:
Thanks so much for dinner!

Nayuki:
I bet she must have been really hungry.

Yuichi:
Hey, little piggy! 
You're not alone at this table, you know that?

Akiko:
She's all right. 
It makes me happy seeing her eating so much.

Yuichi:
So, you wanna tell us who ya are, freeloader?

???:
I don't remember.

Yuichi:
What?

???:
Mm-hm. 
I haven't been able to remember who I am for a while.
I guess you could say that I have amnesia.
That's pretty cool, don'tcha think?
...oww! What'd you do that for you big, dumb meathead!

Yuichi:
I hit you because you're obviously lying.
Why don't you get serious!

???:
But it's true!

Yuichi:
If you really have amnesia, then how come you said that you were never gonna forgive me?

???:
Look, all I do remember is that I have a grudge against you.
I just don't remember anything else about my life, got it?

Yuichi:
I guess I never knew that amnesia can be so convenient!

???:
Whether you believe me or not, that's what I got!
...mine!

Yuichi:
Hey!
I was saving that for last, you piece of crap!

???:
That was yummy!

Yuichi:
Why you little... come back!




Yuichi:
It sure doesn't look like the contents of a girl's purse.
It's more like a bunch of stuff you picked up off the ground.

???:
Oh, eat it!

Nayuki:
Oh look, a picture.

Yuichi:
It's you.
What, don't you have any friends?

???:
For your information, I took that picture right after I lost my memory.

Yuichi:
What on earth possessed you to go into a photo booth and take a picture all by yourself?

???:
Well, I saw a bunch of other girls my age doing it, so I thought I should too.

Yuichi:
Right. Not to sound like I'm rushing you, but where are you going now?

???:
I'm gonna stay here until I get my memory back.

Yuichi:
Hey Nayuki.
Be a doll and call the police.

Nayuki:
What! Don't be rude.

???:
You're evil.

Yuichi:
It's the only thing to do.
Taking in a girl with no identity and no place to go is a job for the police.
Don'tcha think?

???:
No, no, wait!
I don't wanna go with them.
Police stations are full of jerk-heads. 

Yuichi:
On top of that, you got some kind of grudge against me, don't you?
Most people wouldn't want to stay under the same roof with someone they couldn't forgive.
Just sayin'.

???:
But the reason I need to stay is that you're the only clue to what my life used to be.

Nayuki:
A guidepost... that's what he is.

???:
I'd forgotten lots of things, but he's one thing I'm sure of.
I can't explain it, but right when I saw his face, it hit me:
I remembered that I hated him more than anything in the whole wide-world.
And I must get even with him!

Yuichi:
Oh man. I so totally don't wanna be your "guidepost".
...ow! Hey! What was that for?!

???:
I looked at your face and got all mad again.
There's no doubt about it - I hate you and your face.

Yuichi:
Well, I don't really care what you hate.
We can't have a dangerous girl like you in the house.
Your request to stay is denied!

???:
Oww...

Nayuki:
I'll ask Mom if she can stay here with us for a while.
Least till she starts remembering.

Yuichi:
No way.
If you ask your mom, she's gonna say yes without even stopping to think about it first.

Akiko:
Well of course!

???:
Yeah! Ha ha ha.

Yuichi:
You see! 
I told ya she'd say yes and wouldn't even consider the consequences.

Nayuki:
Mom says it's fine, so she can stay here for as long as it takes.

Akiko:
If she keeps spending time with Yuichi, then maybe she'll start to remember things more quickly.
I think it's just maybe worth a try.
You can use the room where you were sleeping in earlier.

???:
Yeah! 
She said I could stay! I have a room!

Yuichi:
Oh, for the love of...

Akiko:
Hey, Yuichi?

Yuichi:
Huh?

Akiko:
I'll go down to the police station tomorrow to see if maybe they have a missing persons report out for her.
Then, maybe we can find out exactly who she is a little sooner.

Yuichi:
You know, it'd probably be easier for them to find a match if you took her with you.

Akiko:
Well, she doesn't want to go, so I'd rather not take her against her will.
For all we know, she may have reason to be afraid of the police.



Yuichi:
Now that you're gonna be living with us, you should at least remember your name so we know what to call you.
Other than pig.

Nayuki:
He's got a point.
It'll get really confusing if we don't know what to call you.

???:
My name?
Ohh! I can't remember!

Yuichi:
Fine. 
Then I guess we're just gonna have to make up a temporary name for you in the meantime.
Kyouko Satsumura.
I think this name really suits you!

???:
Don't give me a name like that!

Yuichi:
What else should we call an evil demon-spawn like you?

???:
I'm not evil, butt-face!

Yuichi:
Yeah? Then how come you keep hitting people!

Nayuki:
Both of you just settle down.
I'm sure she'll remember her name in no time.

Yuichi:
How can you and Aunt Akiko be so generous to this vicious little monster?

???:
Just you wait, Yuichi.
I'm gonna rack my brain and remember the cutest name you ever heard in your life!

Yuichi:
Trying to remember won't make your name any cuter.

???:
How do you know?

Yuichi:
It just won't!

???:
It's the cutest!



???:
Oh! Ohh...
There was hardly enough to eat at dinner.
Isn't there anything in here worth eating?
Let me see...

Yuichi:
Now's my chance...

???:
Oh man!
How come they don't have anything I could eat without having to cook first?
Aww...ohh...
Oh! Yummy...
Ahhh!
Icky! Icky! Icky!

Yuichi:
Whoa!
Oh crap.

Akiko:
Oh!

Nayuki:
Having a little midnight snack?

Yuichi:
It wasn't me, it was this sniveling piglet. 

Akiko:
You'll wake up the neighbors if you keep carrying on like this.

???:
Ohh...
He came in and scared me to death!
I was only looking for something to eat is all.

Yuichi:
What, you mean you didn't stuff your face enough at dinner when so you stole my last piece of [kochaku?]?

???:
I'll have you know I didn't steal it.
I just took it off your plate and ate it.

Yuichi:
Those are exactly the same thing!

Akiko:
I can make you something if you give me a second to clean up first. 

Yuichi:
What did I do to deserve this?

Akiko:
How is it everybody?

???:
It's delicious!

Nayuki:
Feels weird to be having a meal like this in the middle of the night.




Kitagawa:
Let me get this straight. She's got amnesia?
Then all she remembers is that she's got a grudge against you?
Maybe the two of you were in love and you did her wrong, or something.

Yuichi:
You moron.
I was only ten years old the last time I visited this town.
But it's true. I can't remember anything from back then.
What could've happened between us seven years ago?

Yuichi:
Man. You're way ahead of where we were at my last school.

Nayuki:
If you think it'll help, you can borrow my notes later. Okay?

Yuichi:
Thanks.
It's snowing again...

Kitagawa:
Hey, Aizawa.

Yuichi:
What is it?

Kitagawa:
Look over there.

Yuichi:
It's that girl...

Kitagawa:
She's been standing there a while, just looking up at the window.

Yuichi:
Do you know who she is?

Kitagawa:
Nah-uh.

Nayuki:
Yuichi! Aren't you gonna eat with us in the cafeteria?

Yuichi:
Yeah. I just gotta do something else real fast.
Guess I must've missed her...

???:
It's good to see you.




???:
What are you doing out here in the middle of the day?

Yuichi:
I saw someone who doesn't go to this school out here, so I came down to check on her.

???:
Okay, I see.
Thanks for checking on me.
Although, I do feel like I have to correct you.
I'm not someone who doesn't go to this school.
I'm enrolled here just like you are.

Yuichi:
Then, why were you standing out here all by yourself out here when you're supposed to be in class?

???:
Well, because I'm absent from school today.

Yuichi:
Oh, I get it.
You're playing hooky today, aren'tcha?

???:
No, that's no it at all.
I haven't been feeling well lately.
So I've been out a lot for the past few months.
I've never been particularly healthy, but lately it seems to be worse than usual.

Yuichi:
I'm not sure if I should ask you this, so feel free not to answer.
But what kind of illness do you have?

???:
Actually, I have a cold.

Yuichi:
Huh?

???:
I caught a cold a while ago.
I can't seem to get rid of it.

Yuichi:
Uh...

???:
Is something the matter?

Yuichi:
No. I was just expecting a more complicated diagnosis.

???:
In that case, how 'bout if I tell you I have a viral infection?

Yuichi:
That's the same thing.

???:
Hmm.
I snuck out to meet someone, that's why I'm here. 
If they find out I was at school but didn't go to any classes, I'm sure I'd get in a lot of trouble.

Yuichi:
So, you were supposed to meet that person right here?

???:
Well, no. Actually if you want to know the truth, there's not a whole lot that I know about them.
It's almost embarrassing, really. I don't even know their name, age, or what grade they're in.

Yuichi:
You've met this person before, right?

???:
Oh, yes, of course.

Yuichi:
What kind of person is this?
Are they a boy, or are they a girl?

???:
I'm afraid that's a secret.

Yuichi:
If you still got a cold, don't you think you should be in bed?

???:
Mm, I'm feeling much better today since I've been taking time away from school for so long.

Yuichi:
You say you missed a lot of school, but it was still winter break until just two days ago.
And weren't you feeling well enough to go shopping yesterday?

???:
Oh, yeah. Maybe so.
You know, I think I should probably go home now.

Yuichi:
I thought you were supposed to meet up with somebody?

???:
I should call it a day.
Sorry to have taken up so much of your time.

Yuichi:
Yeah, you're not kiddin'.
Thanks to you, I won't have time to eat lunch today.

???:
You know, it's kind of rude to say things like that.
Well, goodbye.
Perhaps I'll see you around.

Yuichi:
Yeah. You take care now!

???:
'Kay.

Yuichi:
Hey!

???:
Yeah?

Yuichi:
My name is Yuichi Aizawa.

Shiori:
Oh, yeah.
I'm Shiori.

Yuichi:
What's your last name?

Shiori:
Mm-hm.

Yuichi:
It finally stopped snowing.
Huh...?!



Nayuki:
You're a liar!

Yuichi:
I'm sorry.

Nayuki:
Don't talk to me, Yuichi!

Yuichi:
Come on.
There were some very complicated circumstances.

Nayuki:
I waited the whole time and you never came.

Yuichi:
Why didn't you just eat with Kaori and Kitagawa?
I told you I was sorry. I'll treat you next time, I promise.

Nayuki:
You mean it?

Yuichi:
Well, nothing too expensive, okay?
Like, sushi, or sushi, or sushi...

Nayuki:
Okay, then.
I'll start planning on what I'm gonna have.

Sayuri:
Hi!

Nayuki:
Hello again.

Sayuri:
Oh, you're the one who crashed into us, right?
Sayuri really hoped you didn't hurt yourself falling down like that.

Nayuki:
Oh, no. I was fine.

Sayuri:
Oh, good. Because it didn't really hurt the two of us either.
Right, Mai?
See you around.

Sayuri:
So, you wanna stop for something to eat?

Mai:
I'm going home.

Sayuri:
Well, Sayuri's gotta return a book to the library before she leaves.

Mai:
Okay. I'll go.

Yuichi:
Those two really do stand out in a crowd.

Nayuki:
Her name is Sayuri Kurata and she's a senior.
She's really really smart too.
And the other girl's name is Mai Kawasumi.

Yuichi:
Well, they sure do make for an odd couple of girls, don't they?

Nayuki:
Well, I've gotta go to track practice.
I'll see you at home later.

Yuichi:
Okay.

Nayuki:
Bye!

Yuichi:
Run hard now!



Ayu:
Hey! Yuichi!

Yuichi:
Hm?

Ayu:
I thought that it might be you, Yuichi!
I'm so happy!

Yuichi:
Stop giggling!
Get off of me!

Ayu:
You threw me away like a piece of garbage!

Yuichi:
Come on, can't you just learn how to greet me like a normal person?

Ayu:
What's wrong with a hug hello?

Yuichi:
Didn't you say that I thought that might be you after you jumped on me?
I mean, you attacked me before you were sure it was me.

Ayu:
I did not attack you!
I just gave you a big hug!

Yuichi:
You attacked me.
Uguu.

Ayu:
Uguu.
Why are you copying me?

Yuichi:
Uguuu...

Ayu:
You're so mean!

Yuichi:
Fine. You win.
I'm conceding defeat.

Ayu:
Huh?

Yuichi:
I tried, but I couldn't just make it my own.
Uguu belongs exclusively to you now.
Oh, come on! You're not really mad?

Ayu:
Of course I am!




Ayu:
It's really good, huh?

Yuichi:
Too bad Nayuki's forgiveness isn't so easy to buy off...
So, what have you been doing today?
Scoping out the next Taiyaki stand you're planning to knock over?

Ayu:
Oh shut up!
I have a very important mission going on today.

Yuichi:
A mission?

Ayu:
Yes.

Yuichi:
Can I ask what kind of mission?

Ayu:
Well, uh...
I'm looking for something.

Yuichi:
You didn't just make up that mission idea by any chance, did you?

Ayu:
Mm-mm.
I dropped something and lost it.
And now I'm looking everywhere to try to find it, because it's extremely valuable.
So you can see it's important that I complete this mission.

Yuichi:
Okay...
So, did you drop your wallet or something?

Ayu:
Nothing like that.
The thing that I dropped was a... hm? Hmm...
Was a...
I forgot what it was.

Yuichi:
What?

Ayu:
What's... the matter with me?
I can't seem to remember what the valuable thing was that I dropped.

Yuichi:
Yeah, you have got to be kidding me.

Ayu:
It's something that's really valuable.
Or maybe it's precious to me but is otherwise worthless.
I only know I've gotta find it before it's too late.
Why can't I think of it?
What's wrong with me?

Yuichi:
Don't worry, okay?
It just slipped your mind for a second, that's all.

Ayu:
But, I have to look for it right now.

Yuichi:
Yeah, but you're not gonna get very far if you don't even know what you're looking for, right?

Ayu:
I know if I just see it, I'm gonna remember.
I've gotta look. 
If I don't look, I'm never gonna find it.

Yuichi:
You can't even remember where you might've dropped it?

Ayu:
I can't even think of when or where I might have had it last.
I don't know what it is - just that it's something really valuable.
I realize I'm not making much sense here, but...

Yuichi:
It's okay. Let's just start with the places you go most often.
I'm gonna help you find this thing.

Ayu:
Thanks. I really appreciate it, Yuichi.
Wow!

Yuichi:
Did you find it?

Ayu:
I can't believe it! They came out with new flavors!

Yuichi:
Oh please! Come on!

Ayu:
Uguu?
Well, you can hardly blame me, can you?
I had no idea they were ever gonna make new flavors for these things.

Yuichi:
And we're moving on right now.
How 'bout this place?

Ayu:
No, I don't think so.

Yuichi:
Is this the one?

Ayu:
Uh-uh.

Yuichi:
The next place is our last stop.

Ayu:
Right. 
There should be a little cake shop around the corner.
We're not very far away from it now.

Yuichi:
Not that I'm judging you, but how come all the places you most frequently go to are food-related?

Ayu:
Uguu, you leave me alone!
Um?

Yuichi:
I don't see any cake shop here.

Ayu:
That's so weird...
I could swear I remember one being here not too long ago.

Yuichi:
It looks like someone else opened up a new store here in the meantime.
So I'm not sure we're ever gonna find this thing.

Ayu:
You know what?
I'm sure I'm gonna find it one day if I keep looking.
I have a feeling.

Yuichi:
Is that so?

Ayu:
Thanks so much for your help today, Yuichi.

Yuichi:
Uh, hey Ayu?
If you have a cell phone, maybe you should give me your number so I can reach you.

Ayu:
What is a "cell phone"?

Yuichi:
Please tell me that's some kind of bad joke.

Ayu:
No.

Yuichi:
You know, it's a cellular phone?

Ayu:
Is that somehow related to a telephone?

Yuichi:
Yeah, it is.
But it's portable.

Ayu:
Really? Wow, I guess I learned something new today.
I better be going home now.
See you later, Yuichi!
Until next time!

Yuichi:
A girl who's lost her memory...
And Ayu, who can't remember what she's lost...
And me... who can't even remember anything that happened here seven years ago...
Is there some kind of spell on this town that causes people to forget?




Yuichi:
I'm home!

???:
It's Yuichi!!

Yuichi:
Ooww!

???:
How come you didn't move out of my way, Yuichi!

Yuichi:
You're the one who just plowed into me!

???:
Good grief. I had almost forgotten how unreasonable you are.

Yuichi:
Look who's talking!

Nayuki:
Oh, you're home!
You sure were out late.

Akiko:
Yuichi, did she tell you her news?
She's finally remembered what her name is.

Makoto:
Oh! It's Makoto!
Makoto Sawatari.
Isn't that awesome!

Yuichi:
You're name's Makoto Sawatari?

Makoto:
And I bet it really gets your goat that my name's so cute!

Yuichi:
I don't know.
Kinda sounds like a man's name to me.

Makoto:
Don't be ridiculous.
It might just be the cutest name ever, so I don't need your stupid approval.
Ohh, and thank god I don't have a dumb name like Yuichi!

Yuichi:
At least it's normal.

Akiko:
So, we'll just call you Makoto from now on, okay?

Nayuki:
It's nice to meet you, Makoto!

Makoto:
Likewise!

Akiko:
I think the bath might just be about ready.
Who wants to be first?

Makoto:
Me! 
I wanna be the first one!

Yuichi:
Yo, freeloader?
Maybe you should just try learning some manners.

Makoto:
Hey! You're a freeloader too, you know?

Yuichi:
I'm a member of this family!
Who are you?

Makoto:
Right, it's all about you, isn't it?

Yuichi:
You know, it'd be nice if you showed a little respect, piggy!

Makoto:
I don't remember you doing me any favors, dummy!

Yuichi:
Don't make me hurt you!
