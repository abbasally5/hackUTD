Hey, Shaminyan, Shaminyan! Christamas is just around the corner.

Sorry kid, but I don't understand human speech.

Mikulu:
I've got a call for you from Santa Claus. 

Churuya:
Wow, you are kidding!

Churuya:
Hi, Santa! I'd like...some smoked cheese for Christmas.

Kyon:
That'll be 420 yen, after tax.

Churuya:

Merry Christmas.

You don't want to go there, Mr Mouse.

Mouse:
Oh, damn!

Shaminyan:
Be be.
Oh, smochi!


Ashacchi:
Christmas presents don't have to be from Santa. Anyone can give them to people they like.

Ashacchi:
Hey Kyon, look at it, I got you Christmas present. I guess... maybe now you have an idea about how much I...really, really like you.

Kyon:
Gee, thanks, how much did you pay for it?

Ashacchi:
What?!
