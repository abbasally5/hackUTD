Here we go.


Ashacchi:
Wow... Kyon is so dreamy.

Kyon:
Yah, I forgot to write my name on the test we just took.

Churuya:
What a coincidence! I forgot to write mine, too.

Ashacchi:
She's trying to make Kyon think they have a lot in common, no!


Ashacchi:
Excuse me, may I please have my test back? I want to erase my name.

Teacher:
What are you talking about?! Don't be ridiculous. Wait until I graded it.

Teacher:
Here are your tests.

Ashacchi:
Ah! This is great! The teacher erased my name for me.

Ashacchi:
Look Kyon! I forgot to...

Kyon:
Oh, I wrote my name on it after all.

Ashacchi:
No way!


Teacher:
You did so horribly, you'll have to take a makeup test.

Churuya:
Nyoro-n...

Ashacchi:
Oh, too bad.

Teacher:
And you too.

Ashacchi:
Ah...


Churuya:
Nyoro-n...

Churuya:
I don't think this is the right answer.

Churuya:
I know! I'll put that down as my answer. I feel a lot better about it now.


Nagatocchi:
You are my backup, prepare for data download.

Ashacchi:
Not now! Oh no! I can't control my hand!


Two:
I'm all done.

Churuya:
How did you do, Ashacchi

Ashacchi:
How about you, Miss Churuya?


Kyon:
Come on, it's time to go home.

Ashacchi:
Oh...with me? I mean... I'd love to...

Churuya:
The test had a question about smochi. 

Kyon:
Really?

Ashacchi:
Fight on me.
