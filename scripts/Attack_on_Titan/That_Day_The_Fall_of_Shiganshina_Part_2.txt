  They first appeared over a hundred years ago, giant humanoid creatures with a taste for our blood.
The brute strength of these apparition trumped an average person many times over, and we were shoved to the brink of extinction almost overnight.
The survivors erected walls Maria, Rose, and Sina, withdrawing behind them in frightened huddles in what was to be a century of uneasy peace.
And then...

Monk:
Till then a man appoint from God!
Go metric was I!
Heaven driven illness above the Mt.Everest!
Now they've been honest, am I here punished for it?
Punish by the justice of god!
??? souls!
Has greed has grown in all love in every good, every light, so justice here has change!
???
What else may heavenly grace do for sins and us?
For we look at that our eyes hides between and like the…

Hannes:
Damn it! Stop!

Eren:
You son of a bitch!
We could have saved her!
We almost had her out!
Why did you pulled?
Why?

Hannes:
I told you stop!

Mikasa:
Eren!

Hannes:
Look.
There is nothing you could have done for her, you understand?
You are a kid, you are weak.
I'm worse.
When push came to shout I was too frighten that hold my ground.
Your mother died because I'm a damn coward!
I'm sorry.

Mikasa:
It is the same thing all over again.

Soldier:
Harry up!
Get your eye on the gate!
Drop everything, find the ferry nearest to you!
Climb on the boat and we are on our way.
Move it!
These ships are gonna give you a head start!

Armin:
So cold outlier district like Shigansina drought out like thorns vital parts along the Wall Maria.
Their basic function is to streamline troop dispersal and keep security cost down by drawing Titans into specific areas.
The calculated design floor in all outlier district is that they have only a single gate through which its citizens are able to retreat inward should the need arise.

Soldier:
No personal belongings!
We need to make as much rooms as possible.

Armin's father:
Armin, best have a seat.

Armin:
I will.
Just keeping an eye on my friends.
There they are!
Eren?

Armin’s father:
I wouldn’t try to call out just now.
Give them there space, God only knows what they have just seen.

Soldier:
Stop dragging your feet!
Snap out of it!
I need those cannons loading!
C’mon!
They are heading right for us!

Commoner:
This isn’t for real!
This is a nightmare!
God…help us…
Hey! What are you doing!?
What about rest of us?

Soldier:
I’m sorry!
It’s at full capacity!

Woman:
You can’t do this!
Please!
At least let our children on board!

Soldier:
Look!
There’s nothing we can do!
Push off now!

Crowd:
Don’t leave us!
There is still rooms!

Soldiers:
what are you aiming at?
Have you got rocks in your head?
Sir, with this respect we all ??? enough to design for accuracy to begin with!
You`re gonna give me attitude or you gonna to reload, stop whining and do your job.
What's the point?

No, the inner gate!
I'm not getting left behind!
Retreat or die!
Hey!

Hunnes:
Wait, are you out of your mind?
Don't shut it yet!
We still got people out there!
Give them a chance!

Soldier:
We can`t let the titans get through the inner gate!
If that happens the handful of lives out there will be the least of our problems.
There are ??? free sources whole human race and troops behind next ??? break throught…

Hunnes:
Listen for yourself!
We are soldiers!
We don't get to decide who will lives or die.

Soldiers:
What are you waiting for?
The Titans are closing the gap!
That does it, bring it down!

Hunnes:
No!
Let go of me!

Soldiers:
What’s the hell?
Oh no! Fire!
What?! Impossible!
We've gotta get the hell out of here!
Retreat! Retreat!
Shut the gate, now!
We're being charged!
Go! Go! Go!
Oh…god…

Armin:
That news travels fast.
Hours after Shiganshina fell, every man, woman, and child within the Interior knew the unthinkable had come to pass.
Terror spread like wildfire.

Bureaucracy:
What do you think we're meant to make of these reports of Shiganshina falling to the Titans?
Are they verified?
That outcropping has held for a century.
It makes no sense.

Whether or not they're verified, the refugees are certainly flooding in like plague rats.
There've been 500 accounted for the boat.

The question is, how prepared are we if Shiganshina is in ruins?
Come now. Surely Wall Maria is enough on its own to hold the Titans at bay, don't you think?

Damn it all. Any way it's sliced the situation is untenable.
Our hands are tied.
I say we make appeals to the Central Government for help.

Soldier:
Excuse me lords, you'll really want to hear this!
Wall Maria has been broken through!
The titans are ...they are in!

Hunnes:
This is the end…

Crowd:
That's it. We're all dead.
We're dead and standing at the gate of Hell.

Eren:
It’s gone.
Our house, it’s all gone forever…
Why was I all such a brat?
Why did I always fighter?
I never said “I love you”.
Now I’ll never get to…never…

Hunnes:
There is nothing you could have done for her, you understand?

Eren:
Because I’m a kid, because I’m a weak, because every last one of us was a damn coward…
Now this is over.

Mikasa:
What are you?

Armin:
What’s wrong?
Did you see something?
Eren?

Eren:
I need(?) them to stop this!
I’ll kill them all…every last one…!

Armin:
Eren…
In terrified haste, the central government declared the outlier district is a lost cause, and decreed all mankind to retreat behind Wall Rose.
Estimates held that nearly 10 thousand lives were lost to the titan offensive.

Grisha:
Eren…Carla…Mikasa…
Please be alive!
Eren!
Stay with me, boy!
Wake up!

Eren:
Stop it!
Please, you scaring me!
I don't understand what you are trying to do.

Grisha:
You don’t have to!
Just give me your arm!

Eren:
No!
You are insane because mom’s death pushed you off deep end!

Grisha:
Shut up!

Eren:
No!
Let me go!

Grisha:
Damn you this is the only way!

Eren:
You're not making any sense!

Grisha:
You cannot forget the key!
Whatever you do, you must reach it.
It's the way to the truth.
One day you'll understand!

Mikasa:
Hey. It's okay.
You were just dreaming.

Eren:
Dad was, It felt so real.

Mikasa:
Nightmare. Shake it off.

Eren:
Yeah…

Mikasa:
Come on.
They're handing out food rations near the warehouse.
I think this used to be where they stored all the dry goods.
Now it’s where the corral the refugees.

Refugees:
I don’t think so, friend.
Give me a break!
All I have had for two days is a moldy bit of crust!
Mikasa:
Not exactly a dignified existence.

Armin:
Hey guys!

Mikasa:
Armin…

Armin:
Glad I caught you.
Here. Grandpa scrounged a little extra by telling the powers that be he had kids.

Mikasa:
That was nice.

Eren:
What’s his deal?

Armin:
Just ignore it.
There's a shortage.
Poor man's probably hungry.
By the way, I'd make that last.
They are already dealing famine before we got here.
So it’s an ugly situation.
That, and this far in there's a greater disparity between the haves and the have nots.

Soldier:
Nothing more gratify than seeing your rations go to animals.
Guess we gotta beef up the herd though.
Eat up, the titans like a little meat on their bones.

Armin:
Eren, wait!

Soldier:
Ought to keep you in cages.
Shove you out to frontline as a buffer.
Aw! Damn it!
You pick the wrong man, asshole!

Eren:
Spineless coward! All of you!
You don’t…You don’t know what it’s like!
You’ve seen one?
You’ve seen what they can do?

Soldier:
You little piece of…

Armin:
He’s sorry! He didn’t mean it!
He is just hungry!
We all get that way.
Speak our minds out of turn sometimes?
Forgive him. I beg you.

Soldier:
Yeah,well…
Keep in mind who's givin' up their share so you can eat.
In case, you hadn't noticed, we're all hungry.
Tell your buddy a little gratitude goes along way!

Armin:
Sure!

Eren:
Bastard…I'm not about to show gratitude to a coward!
I can’t do this. I’m going back to Wall Maria!
The titans have to pay for what they’ve done to us!

Armin:
Hey, now. You're not serious. That's your stomach talking.

Eren:
No, it’s not!
Wake up! The guys standing between us and them are just a bunch of talk!
To the hell with all of them! Here. I'm going back!

Armin:
Yeah? What're you trying to do, starve?

Eren:
What you gonna get sick of their charity?
Too much is handed to us!
We have to stand on our own two feet!

Armin:
To do what? Get killed by a Titan?
I know I used to think our future was beyond the walls.
But it's like you told that man, I'd never seen what they could do to us!

Eren:
So that's it? This is just the way life is?
Run away and take what we're given…

Armin:
Look at us!
What choice do we have here?

Eren:
We can damn-well leave!
If you wanna scrape by on the charity of cowards, that's your thing, but I'm not a parasite!

Armin:
Mikasa…

Mikasa:
Have you looked in the mirror lately!?
All of us are parasites.
We couldn't ran from certain death without help.
Tell me differently.
Don't take a short comings out of him.
For god's sake, we can't even find food on our own.
We're parasites. We're cowards.
Titans are at the top of the food chain. Period.
Pride be damned. We do what we must to live.
Your mom didn't ask us to be brave.
Eat it. She ask us to stay alive.
I'm not about to let her down.

Armin:
A few days later, throngs of starved refugees were put to plow on the wastelands as the last ditch effort to raise food.
But the cold heart ground hit to nothing.
In the following year 846 the remaining refugees 'old enough' to serve in the military were tasked with reclaiming wall Maria.
Of the 250,000 sent, nearly 20% of the surviving population, not even 200 made it back.
While it did nothing, to drive back the titans, their sacrifice did at least less the effects of the famine within the interior.

Eren:
We have to find a way to stop them.
Our lives will never be 'our own' until we do.
This world will never feel like home.
That's it. Next year I'll be applying to join the Cadets.
To become strong enough to fight back.

Armin:
I'm with you.

Eren:
You don’t have to.

Armin:
I do!

Mikasa:
So do I.

Eren:
Damn it!
I'm not trying to drag you in!
Look. There is no point in following me to my death!

Mikasa:
Yeah, and if I can help it then it won' t be your death.

Eren:
All right. Together then.

Keith:
Straighten those spines pissheads! The 104th cadet boot camp starts now!
Allow me to introduce myself. I'm commandant Keith Shadis and you will grow to hate me! Training is gonna be a white knuckle ride through hell!
If I've done my job, you'll be waking up in a cold sweat with memories of this place every night for the rest of your miserable lives!
Right now your nothing, livestock but over the next three soul crushing years, you'll learn to take down your own Goliath!
Remember this moment when you come face to face with him, ‘cause here's where you ask yourself: am I a fighter? Or am I feed?
Am I gonna be ground to pulpy human grist between Boulder size incisors? Or am I gonna be the one to bite!

Eren:
Oh I'm a fighter alright and before I'm done with them, the Titans will grow to hate me!

Armin:
It isn't easy, hard truth.
Passion's no guarantee you'll stick the landing.
Unless you can transmute it to skill.
When you're floored by the fundamentals all the heart in the world means nothing.
