  <Opening>

Izaya:
Best of luck to ya, Taro Tanaka!

As a member of the Dollars, I'm gonna keep this.

Haruko:
You're still walking around, trying to act all high, even though Mika Harima is gone.

Shingen:
What would it take for her to die?

Takashi:
Did you hear? The Slasher was in Ikebukuro again.

Izaya:
So then I'll have to start a war that only I can win.

Celty:
Screw it!



Simon:
Come in! Come in! You try Russia Sushi!
It good! It cheap! And it yummy!
You eat, you like. I promise!

Man:
The Slasher?

Man:
Again?

Woman:
How many victims now?

Reporter:
Right behind me is where the Slasher attacked last night.

Man:
Yeah, I heard there was a massive spontaneous gathering in downtown Ikebukuro 6 months ago.
And it was right around then that the Slasher began to appear.

Reporter:
A popular discussion among the youth in this area is something called "the Headless Rider," who...

Reporter:
The U.S. has already made contact with the Headless Rider, and according to reports...

Man:
The Slasher...

Man:
Headless Rider...

Woman:
This is scary...

Anri:
Things are born and disappear in this city every day.
But still, nothing ever happens, nothing ever changes.
That was her daily life.



Seiji:
Everything about our love is fake.

Mika:
And yet it's stronger than the real thing.

Seiji:
I love that scar on your neck.
Because I know that scar will lead to true love.

Mika:
I am so in love with you, Seiji.
I love everything about you with all my heart.

Masaomi:
Man, every time I see them, I get jealous...

Mikado:
Then don't look at 'em.

Masaomi:
Dude, if a chick's hot, you look at her, and then you go talk to her!
These things are carved in our DNA!
It's the bro show, dude! It's what we do!

Mikado:
Yeah, I don't wanna be on that show.

Masaomi:
No need to worry, my love.
This body may belong to girls everywhere, but my heart is all yours, Anri.
You know what I always ask myself?
"Why is Anri so boobilicious, so sexy cute?"

Mikado:
N-Not cool!
You can't call her boobilicious!

Masaomi:
So then, you admit my comment about her being cute was right.

Mikado:
Well, I...

Masaomi:
Are you saying that you don't think that she's cute?

Mikado:
No! I mean, yes! I do think she's cu-

Masaomi:
Got it! So you admit she's definitely cute.
But, I'm willing to admit she's boobilicious.
Thus, exhibiting that my love for this fine chick... goes way deeper than yours.
Which means... I win, you lose!

Mikado:
What kind of self-centered logic is that?

Masaomi:
Loser!

Anri:
6 months ago, there was a little bit of an incident.
And for a while it seemed like the whole school, the whole city was talking about it.
But that said, it had nothing to do with her. So she wasn't interested.

Mikado:
You okay?

Anri:
Yeah. I'm fine, thanks.

Nothing happens. Nothing changes.
And that was her daily life.



Walker:
I'm so glad I racked up all those points!

Saburo:
Hurry up.

Erika:
Hurry.
What are you gonna do with that poster, Yumatchi?

Shizuo:
She's sure in a hurry.

Tom:
What do you think?
She's getting a little more brazen in broad daylight lately.

Shizuo:
Yeah, I agree.

Walker:
You know, I prefer when the spooky stuff lurks in the shadows like it's supposed to.

Erika:
It'd be better if we were the only ones who knew about it, you know?
Like "the lady's private affairs."

Walker:
Yeah! The Secret of Haruka Nogizaka!

Saburo:
Just shut it.

Kyohei:
It's all good.
She's got her reasons, I'm sure.
Leave her be.

Man:
Hey, check it out!
The Headless Rider!

Anri:
And this is the daily life of Celty Sturluson.
And this is just another day for her.

When most people find themselves surrounded by the extraordinary, they panic.
And that's when she usually escapes.
This is how Celty Sturluson typically did things.
However...

Kinnosuke:
I don't know why, but when things like you show up in movies and manga, it's always when the cops have been doomed and on the ropes.
And by the time the hero with the superpowers shows up, we're generally quivering in a puddle of blood to illustrate the strength of our opponents.
And that's just fine.
It simply means people think we're powerful and can't be killed so easily.
And you know for a movie, that works.
But I've always wanted to add something at that point.
If by chance a monster, or an android, or even a ninja did appear...
Well, then, there's just one thing that I'd wanna say.
Don't jack with the cops, monster.
I'll say it again. Stupid monster, don't jack with the cops!



Shinra:
Celty! Welcome-
Hey, what's wrong?
Believe me when I tell you that I'm as proud as a peacock when you hold me like this...
Well, maybe that isn't the right expression.
Hey, why are you shaking? What happened to you?
Celty?

Celty:
I-I was so scared.
You have no idea, Shinra.
The cops these days are barbaric!

Shinra:
The cops?

Celty:
There were at least a dozen cop cars and motorcycles chasing me.
They were like one big savage monster!

Shinra:
Oh, that's right.
They brought on a new cop for you.
I heard he's some hard-ass from another district.
He's, uh, Kinnosuke Kuzuhara.
I've heard he's known for starting high-speed chases that end in accidents.

Celty:
I was scared. I was really scared.
I was too full of myself.
If you forgive me, I promise to be quiet from now on.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I am so sorry!

Shinra:
Who are you apologizing to?
It's not like you to panic or act fragile about anything.
But when we're in bed, you can show that fragile side-

Celty:
This is not the time for those kinds of comments.

Shinra:
Yup, that's my girl...
Okay, changing subjects.
I know this isn't the best timing, but would you mind picking someone up for me?
No, this isn't a job.
Hm... He's back again. My dad.

Celty:
Jeez... Why can't he just take a taxi like everyone else...
A man has been messing with me since the day we met.

Horada:
Yo, yo! Speak already!

Higa:
What's up with all the white?

Horada:
You're too white, gramps.

Celty:
Is that...?

Horada:
What's wrong, old man?

Higa:
Look what he's wearing, Horada.
The geezer's mental.

Shingen:
Now listen here, youngsters.
Wouldn't you agree that the air in Tokyo is filthy?

Horada:
Huh?

Shinren:
But your faces are quite filthy, too.
So perhaps for someone like you, stupidity works like a protective filter.

Horada:
Yo, this dude's nuttier than a squirrel turd.

Yellow Scarves member:
Yeah, but he's for your entertainment.

Shingen:
Alright, it's time to show you boys what grown-ups can do.
Thanks to the protections you receive under the Juvenile Law, you probably think you're free to harass, or even kill any poor soul you choose.
But always keep in mind, when you set out to kill a person, you must be prepared for that person to have-

Horada:
You're freaking whacked, old man.
And guess what gramps, I'm over 20!

Shingen:
W-Wait a second!
That really hurts, and I can't run away with you stepping on my foot.
Ooh! That finger's really sharp! It's poking, it's poking!
Why are you just standing there, Celty?
Will you hurry up and save me!

Celty:
I really don't want to...

Shingen:
Couldn't you see I was smarting off to these hooligans, just 'cause I saw you there, which gave me a false sense of bravado?

Higa:
Horada, take a look.
Check it out, it's the Black Rider.

Horada:
What? Don't be jacking with me.

Higa:
Yeah, man.
I totally saw that on the TV.

Horada:
I heard you made an appearance at that big Dollars meeting that took place 6 months ago.
I'm tired of people showing up and acting all tough on our territory.
Come on! You got something to say?
Huh? Huh?

Higa:
Huh?
What's th-

Horada:
Huh? Hm?
What the hell is this?
Hey, wait!

Celty:
Humph!
Now that was the proper reaction.
Oh, good. It's not broken...
Shinra gave this to me.

Shingen:
Take that!
Now you've seen the power of the grown-ups!

Celty:
I really don't like him.



Namie:
Jeez, is there really a point to this?
How do you play this game, anyway?

Simon:
Russia Sushi good! Russia Sushi cheap!
For you, big spender! Oh, Izaya!

Izaya:
Well now, I see that you're working hard as ever.

Simon:
You come to Ikebukuro lots lately.
You stop by restaurant and it's good.
See, today we just opened brand-new can.
Fish very fresh!

Izaya:
I'd love to, but I'm a little busy today.
I'll stop by soon, though.

Simon:
Hey.

Izaya:
That right?



Masaomi:
Let's see who knows Anri better, Mikado or me.
We'll start by listing all the good traits we think she has.
Me first: Boobilicious.

Mikado:
That's where you start?
Can you try and stay away from using that word?

Masaomi:
Live by the boobie, die by the boobie.

Mikado:
What does that even mean?

Anri:
This was the first time in her life that she'd ever had guy friends.
Actually, this is probably the first time that she's truly been friends with anyone.

Mikado:
I would if you give me a second!

Masaomi:
Okay, then say it. I'm waiting.

Anri:
Her role used to be making Mika Harima look like the more attractive one in their group.
And she was fine with that.
She knew what role to play with her.
But now, after losing that, she isn't exactly sure what role she should play.

Masaomi:
Okay!
In order to prove how boobilicious Anri is, let's go hit on some hotties!

Mikado:
How do you get that?

Anri:
I have to hit on girls?

Masaomi:
Don't worry.
I just wanna use you as bait so when other chicks see us, they think "Well, if that girl's hanging out with 'em, I guess it's okay if we do, too."
All you gotta do is stand there.

Mikado:
Wait a second, Masaomi! You can't-

Masaomi:
Alright, glad you all aren't bored with this.
On your mark, get set, and go!
Catch me if you can!

Anri:
Did he just leave?

Mikado:
Masaomi!

Anri:
Is it okay we didn't go with him?

Mikado:
It's fine.
He's gonna hit on girls whether we're with him or not.
Oh, man...

Masaomi:
He's hopeless.
He's so bad with girls, he needs a serious handicap.
He's lucky, I'm such a pimp.

Yellow Scarves member:
Excuse me.

Anri:
She knew what was going on.
She realized that both those boys were interested in her.
But...

Mikado:
Hey, that's a pretty sunset!

Anri:
Huh?

Mikado:
Oh, but that cloud over there doesn't look good.
Maybe it's gonna rain later.
We probably should be careful.

Anri:
Yeah.
Um...

Mikado:
Yeah, what is it?

Anri:
I should go.
Goodbye, see you tomorrow.

Mikado:
Okay... See you tomorrow...
Who says pretty sunset? That was dumb.

Anri:
If either of them were to ask her on a date, she wouldn't know what to say.
It was confusing for her.
She still loved Mika Harima.
And her feelings for those two boys were the same.
She still doesn't understand the difference between friendship and love.
What do they mean to her?
Mika, Mikado, Masaomi...

Yellow Scarves member:
So you're not gonna change your mind.
Come on, man, we can't do anything without you.

Masaomi:
I already told you guys. That's not who I am anymore.
I want nothing to do with that now.
I'm not coming back, okay? Not to that side.



Taro Tanaka:
I see a lot more people around this city are wearing yellow now.

Setton:
Yellow?

Kanra:
I know.
You notice them more because of their color unlike the Dollars.

Setton:
Oh, the Yellow Scarves, right?

Kanra:
You know these guys, Setton?

Setton:
Yeah, I guess so.
I mean, they've been around a long time.

Taro Tanaka:
What's the Yellow Scarves?

Kanra:
They were this gang from Ikebukuro.
Then they got in a huge fight with another gang and kinda fell off the map.

Taro Tanaka:
Oh, yeah!
I have heard about these guys.
So does that mean they're back?

Kanra:
Ikebukuro's getting kinda sketchy lately.

Setton:
Yeah, even the police are scary there.
I mean it. Don't mess with the cops, alright?

Mikado:
The cops?



Yoko:
Oh, look, she fell down.
Loser.

Haruko:
We only kicked you a little bit.
Don't be so clumsy.

Akie:
You're a little parasite.

Yoko:
Don't you be giving me that stink eye!



Kanra:
It'll be a while before they solve that Slasher case.
Hey, did you guys hear?
Everybody's saying that the Dollars are actually the Slasher.
Some say they're the Black Rider, too.

Setton:
Huh? Who said that?

Taro Tanaka:
I don't think that's true!

Kanra:
All joking aside...
You should really watch out for the Yellow Scarves.
Some of those guys really don't like the Dollars.
They're kind of pissed about how big they've gotten while they've laid low.

Taro Tanaka:
Really?
Okay, I'll be careful.



Yoko:
Look at you.
Mika's gone, so you're slutting around with Mikado and Masaomi.
And now Nasujima?

Akie:
How many guys you gonna whore yourself out to?
God, you're a skank!

Haruko:
You know, you suck the life out of everything around you.
Parasite!

Yoko:
Parasite!

Akie:
Parasite!

Yoko, Akie, Haruko:
Parasite! Parasite! Parasite! Parasite! Parasite! Parasite! Parasite! Parasite!

Anri:
The girl realized that what they were saying about her wasn't too far from the truth.
She was dependent on Mika Harima.
And now, things weren't much different.

Yoko:
Say something, slut.

Haruko:
Too dumb to talk?

Akie:
Do parasites even have a mouth?

Anri:
She'd let herself become dependent on those two boys, as well.
And now she's trying to find her place with them.

Akie:
You stink up the whole school, you parasite.
Just stay home.

Yoko:
Listen, slutbag, two of my boyfriends were beaten up because of you!

Haruko:
How can you live with yourself, huh?

Anri:
This is what she did to protect herself and her heart.
Nothing new happens. Nothing changes.
This was her daily life.

Yoko:
You live around here, don't you?
Maybe we should swing by!

Akie:
Yeah, we'll see what you're hiding in there.

Haruko:
Give us a hard proof that you're a skank.



Kanra:
It's here!

Setton:
Oh.

Taro Tanaka:
Huh?

Kanra:
I'm the one who wants to cut you!

Taro Tanaka:
This is the person that's been trolling our forum for like the past 6 months, right?

Setton:
Why hasn't anyone blocked her yet?

Kanra:
I did!
But it doesn't work! She comes back!

Setton:
So what do we do?

Kanra:
I've blocked her remote host.
But then she immediately pops up again using a different host.

Taro Tanaka:
You think it's a proxy?

Kanra:
No, I don't think it's a proxy.

Setton:
It's creeping me out a little bit.



Anri:
Nothing happens. Nothing changes.
That was her daily life.



<Preview>

Celty:
Somewhere in this town there's the Slasher.
And with each attack, fear fuels a thousand rumors, spreading like wild fire across the stagnant night air.
But...
Next time: Turmoil Reigns.
