  <Opening>

Kanra:
Rumor is, some students from Raira Academy were attacked by the Slasher.

Shingen:
Instead, create a conflict around her.
And whoever shows up for the fight, throw them into the fire.

Shuji:
Haruna, have you eaten yet?

Yoko:
The toughest guy in Ikebukuro?

Shuji:
Yeah, who is it?

Celty:
If I actually had a head, I'd be dead now.

Shizuo:
I'll kill 'em. Whoever it is, I'll kill 'em dead!
I'll kill 'em deader than dead!

Tom:
Ah, damn!



Shuji:
I'm flying...
Wait, I'm flying?
I was only... looking for an answer.

Ikebukuro...
What is the source of this crazy junktown's energy?
Where does this growing sense of greed come from?
Just who is the toughest guy in this city?
About 6 months ago, I was doing an article on the toughest guy in Ikebukuro.
And that's when I first met the guy.
He had a vibe. Everything around him changed.

Shizuo:
You bastard.
What'd you have to go and make me angry for, huh?
Who do you think you are? God or something?

Tom:
Hey, Shizuo, let's go.

Shizuo:
Sure.
So, where next?

Tom:
That teacher who hits on students.

Shizuo:
Oh.

Shuji:
Amazing...
He brought back that rush I had when I was young, that high you get chasing a good story, back before I started writing for these third-rate gossip rags.
Curiosity...
That's all. Intense curiosity made me wanna know everything I could about this guy.
But, due to the uproar that soon followed, my article was postponed.
I don't know the specifics behind the incident, but it became clear to me that evil spirits were all over this town.
Something big was about to go down.
And in one way or another, this town's toughest guy was gonna be in the middle of it.
I started my article on 'bukuro again.
But this time, I focused on getting info from those around him.

Simon:
Oh, Shizuo!
Of course, me and him buddy friends.
Salmon roe for you.

Shuji:
Uh, I didn't order that.

Simon:
Shizuo friends, yes, they my friends, too!
Thank you for shopping! It's so good!

Shuji:
Does he talk like this on purpose?

Simon:
Toughest?
I no know of what you speak of.
Shizuo good guy.

Shuji:
So tell me, have you ever seen him fight anyone before?

Simon:
No way. Fighting is always bad.
Peace is what good. We like peace.
Peace? A piece of clam!
One order of giant clam!

Shuji:
Uh, no! Wait a sec!

Dennis:
Give it up, mister.
Simon's a pacifist. He isn't gonna talk about fighting.

Shuji:
Uh, no, no.
All I'm asking is who the toughest guy in this city is.

Dennis:
Well, if that's the case, you should go see a specialist on the subject.
Hm... You know, if you're really serious about this...



Shiki:
The toughest guy in Ikebukuro?

Shuji:
That's right.
Someone suggested you might be able to provide some insight on this.

Shiki:
You understand things are different now.
The air of street fighting has pretty much come and gone.
The only muscle we rely upon these days is the one you can find right up here.
It's true. We work clean now.

Shuji:
Yeah, right.

Shiki:
Of course, screw us over and you'll pay a price.
I don't care who it is, but if they jack with us, say, it's some kid with a knife or a pro with a muscle, we'll rub 'em out in a heartbeat.
But that said, most of the fight in this town aren't done by pros like us.
It's nothing but a bunch of kids.
Humph, like the Dollars and Yellow Scarves.
But, as long as they don't interfere with our business, then we just let the children play.
Lately though, there's been some weird urban legend shit out there, like the Slasher and the Headless Rider...
Back to the question. Toughest guy in 'bukuro... Shizuo Heiwajima.

Man:
You really think he's the one?

Shiki:
From what I've heard, he fights a pretty clean fight.
Regardless, if you really wanna know more about this, there's an info broker who's gonna know way more than we do.

Shuji:
Great! W-Who is this guy?
W-Would you introduce me to him?

Shiki:
I'll do it, but on one condition.
If anyone asks who told you this...
You know how it is.



Izaya:
So, who told you about me?

Shuji:
Well, uh, I can't reveal my sources...

Izaya:
Whatever.
"Tokyo Conflict Review," right?
You do articles on gangs and odd crimes.
Your next issue's on Ikebukuro.

Shuji:
Since you know all that, it makes things a bit easier.
To be specific about my next article, it's on the toughest guy in Ikebukuro.

Izaya:
Toughest, huh?

Shuji:
Thanks.

Izaya:
There are a lot of options in that part of the city.
In a fist fight, it'd be Simon, the sushi guy.
But in a true street fight, it'd be Shizu-chan.

Shuji:
Sh-Shizu-chan?!

Izaya:
Shizuo Heiwajima.
That's who you came to talk about, right?

Shuji:
Yeah. Well, this Shizuo you speak of...

Izaya:
I'm getting annoyed.

Shuji:
Eh?

Izaya:
I know a few things, but just what I have to know.
He's trouble for me so I try to stay ahead of him.
I hate talking about him. Therefore, I won't.

Shuji:
Just a few questions...

Izaya:
By the way, Mr. Niekawa, how's that daughter of yours doing?

Shuji:
Eh?

Izaya:
As a parent, you must be quite concerned, her transferring schools like that.
6 months ago, you approached Shizuo.
That's when you and an innocent lamppost sailed across the night sky.
If you keep sniffing around like this, well, it just might begin to interfere with my own work.

Shuji:
Just what are you getting at?

Izaya:
I'm sure you already know this, but a lot of bad stuff is beginning to brew in Ikebukuro.

Shuji:
What do you mean?
Like the war between the Dollars and the Yellow Scarves that's been-

Izaya:
There's that, and then there're the Slasher attacks that started it all.

Shuji:
The Slasher?

Izaya:
As if having one urban legend spiraling out of control wasn't enough.
Oh, I know.
Back to Shizuo Heiwajima, I'll help you out and introduce you to a friend of his.

Shuji:
Orihara, the info broker, introduced me to a rather odd individual.

Izaya:
Oh, and here's one little bit of advice for ya.
Whatever you do, don't talk to Shizu-chan about his younger brother.

Shuji:
Wish you'd told me that 6 months ago.



Shuji:
When he brought up my daughter, he caught me off-guard.
My daughter's in her second year of high school.
It's just been the two of us since my wife ran off.
Honestly, I doubt she thinks too much of me.
I started writing these articles because of her.
I didn't wanna do it, but we needed the money.

Celty:
Hi, I'm Celty, the transporter.

Shuji:
Well, uh...

Celty:
You wanted to ask about Shizuo.
I know him, he's a good friend of mine.
But get him mad and he's a bit scary.

Shuji:
Actually, I'm trying to write an article on who would be the toughest guy to fight around here.

Celty:
Your magazine seems to do a lot of those articles.
Ranking biker gangs and stuff.

Shuji:
Uh, yeah, thanks for reading it.
Anyway, several people have suggested you would be the toughest person to go up against right now.
Is it... laughing?

Celty:
That's ridiculous. Shizuo's way stronger than I am.
He's so dangerous and scary.
How do I put this, it's not like he has any kind of real skill or training.
People probably say he's like a demon or untamed beast.
But if he's an alien... No, ooh. Ooh, sorry. I have a little green men trauma.
Whatever, what I'm saying is you can be an excellent martial artist, but one shot to the head and you're done.
And Shizuo, he's that handgun. He is like nothing else you've ever seen.
Yeah, that sounds right.

Shuji:
I was moved.
The urban legend had said it all.
I, too, had seen what Shizuo Heiwajima can do.
But what it said captured him perfectly.
It's true. His strength is unbelievable.
Somehow, the adrenaline in his brain manages to tap into an extraordinary level of power.
And for a single moment, his strength transcends human limits.

I-I gotcha.
You know, I've got one more random question for ya...

Celty:
Sure, what is it?

Shuji:
I-If you wouldn't mind, would you remove your helmet for me?
I-It's okay if you don't, I-

Th-That's... not possible.
There's no way.
Celty must be some kind of an illusionist.



Shuji:
I pulled myself together, and went back to my questions.
I heard all about the Dollars and the Yellow Scarves.
There's rumors out there that the Dollars don't seem to acknowledge.
So because of this, they say the head of the Yellow Scarves is about to make a move.

So, who is this head guy?

Man:
We don't have any idea.

Man:
I doubt even the younger guys in the Yellow Scarves know who he is.

Shuji:
Whoever this head guy is, he gave the Yellow Scarves strict orders to do one thing: stay away from Izaya Orihara.
I wonder, could this be the toughest guy?

According to the Yellow Scarves, the Dollars are the ones who are behind the Slasher attacks lately.
A few days ago, these high school girls were attacked by the Slasher.
But one walked away unharmed.
When I heard that, it made me start thinking about my own daughter.
The kind of things a father would do to protect his daughter from the Slasher.
But right now, my daughter is like an alien. And I have no hope of understanding.
Enough. I love my daughter. We're gonna talk this out.



Kanra:
Did you hear? The most recent Slasher victim.
He's a reporter.
He was writing an article for that magazine, the Tokyo Warrior.

Taro Tanaka:
Really?
A magazine writer?

Setton:
What?! Is this true?

Kanra:
Come on, have I ever lied to you?

Setton:
Is he okay?

Taro Tanaka:
Setton, do you know him?

Setton:
Uh, no.
I-I'm just a big fan of his articles.

Taro Tanaka:
Really? I'll have to check 'em out.
Pretty scary stuff, though.

Setton:
I hope the cops catch 'em soon.

Kanra:
She's back!!

Taro Tanaka:
Huh?

Setton:
Huh?

Kanra:
More cutting?
Yeah, well, I'm the one who wants to cut you.

Setton:
Hey Saika, how are you?

Kanra:
It's no use Setton.
No matter what we do, Saika won't respond to us.

Taro Tanaka:
This is kinda creepy stuff.
You know, with all that talk about cutting...
Maybe that's the Slasher!

Kanra:
Yeah, right.

Saika:
Shizuo.

Setton:
Huh?

Saika:
Shizuo Heiwajima.

Taro Tanaka:
What?
Are you friends with Shizuo?

Saika:
Shizuo. Shizuo. Shizuo.
Heiwajima. Heiwajima. Heiwajima.
Love you, Shizuo. Love you, Shizuo.
Me and Shizuo. Me and Shizuo.
Love Shizuo. Love Shizuo.
Cut Shizuo. Cut Shizuo.
Mother's wish. Mother's wish.
Shizuo.



Anri's mother:
Go on. Dig in, Anri.

Anri's father:
Don't get fat.

Anri:
I won't. I'll exercise.

Anri's father:
I'm just teasing you. Eat all you want.

Anri:
Now we'll be together forever.
Right, Mom? Right, Dad?

Shuji:
The girl has the same dream every night.
A happy family, the kind you see in some portrait.
But it was just an illusion.
5 years ago, both of her parents died in a horrible incident.
She was the only survivor. But she still has this dream.
She dreams of the happy family she'll never have.
And of the tragedy that took her parents from her.
That accident was the very first time the Slasher had ever appeared in this city.



Takashi:
Anri!
I know it's time for gym class now, but are you okay?

Anri:
I'm fine.

Shuji:
She felt she was being quite cunning.
She knew what the teacher's motives were, yet she did not think to stop him.
She simply withdrew herself from the moment and then waited for it to pass.

Takashi:
Who's to say the Slasher won't come after you again?
You shouldn't be alone.

Masaomi:
Sexually harassing her again?

Shuji:
She had absolutely no doubt that she was a parasite, feeding off those around her.

Mikado:
Masaomi! Anri!

Masaomi:
Well, speak of the coward and there he is.
We almost fossilized as you took so long.

Mikado:
Score square root of 3.

Masaomi:
Square root of what?
You gotta bag on me in terms I know like "minus 20 points."

Shuji:
Next thing I knew, I woke up in a hospital bed.

Nurse:
Hey there, you're gonna be alright.
Just try to rest for now.
You'll be in the hospital for at least another week.
Then we can start thinking about-

Shuji:
There was a big gap in my memory.

Nurse:
Stop! You can't leave!

Shuji:
I didn't have time for a hospital bed.

Nurse:
Mr. Niekawa, wait!

Masaomi:
Later!

Mikado:
See you guys tomorrow!

Anri:
See you tomorrow!

Shuji:
"Keep an eye on her."
The voice inside my head kept telling me this.

Nurse:
Mr. Niekawa in room 5 hasn't come back yet!

Nurse:
Oh, no...
I hope he doesn't pull his stitches.

Shizuo:
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

Celty:
Shizuo, I appreciate you wanting to help, but you don't have to do this.
This is my problem, not yours.
And there's no guarantee the Slasher will even show up tonight.

Shizuo:
I really hate that freaking Slasher!
I don't care if it is a demonic blade that can't be killed.
If I smash it to pieces, I'll kill it dead.
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

Celty:
W-Wait, calm down, Shizuo.
These guys are a waste of time right now-

Horada:
You got something to say there, bug face?
'Cause we'd like to have a few words with that creepy cruddy little friend of yours.

Shizuo:
You know looks can kill, right?

Horada:
Huh?

Shizuo:
You may not know this, but according to statistics, the chances of a stare killing a guy are 0.00000000000675%.

Horada:
Just what the hell are you trying to say?
Huh, bartender? Ba-Barte-
Ah, crap!

Shizuo:
So if you give someone stink eye, then you can't complain if they kill you, can you?

Anri:
Haruna Niekawa...
He had a pretty big reaction when he heard her name...

Ginichiro:
Excuse me, miss.
It's 11 o'clock.
And you're a student, so you need to go home.

Anri:
I'm so sorry, I'll head straight there.

Ginichiro:
Are you alright?
If you want, we can escort you to your door.

Anri:
Um, well... I...

Radio:
Unit 110, we've got a fight in progress over in East Ikebukuro Central Park.
Head straight there. Over.

Police officer:
Roger. On our way.
Kuzuhara, we gotta go.

Ginichiro:
I'm so sorry, miss.
But if you'd like, wait at the police box, and we'll take you home when we get back.

Anri:
Uh, thanks.



Walker:
Just stop!
Stop swapping the word flash for moment just because you think it sounds more adult-like!
It's just pretentious!

Erika:
You were at that age when you wanted to see things differently from the norm, huh, Yumatchi?

Walker:
I want you stop thinking if you dis every conventional thought an adult has, you're gonna score points with teenagers going through their own rebellious stage!

Erika:
Thinking rejecting social conventions will make you look cooler is pretty silly, isn't it?

Kyohei:
It's not often you bag on a book so hard, Walker.
Whatcha reading?

Walker:
Er, well, it's, er...

Erika:
It's a little something Yumatchi once wrote and self-published.

Kyohei:
I was just sleeping, so I shouldn't talk, but one of our own was hit, so let's be serious about getting info.

Erika:
Yeah, but unlike the time with Kazutawno, we don't even know the guy we're looking for.
I mean, I know he's part of the Dollars, but that's all.

Kyohei:
Try to show some sympathy for other people sometimes.

Walker:
I wanna cry, but I've buried that emotion.

Erika:
I wanna hate the Slasher, but I've buried that emotion, too.

Kyohei:
Come on, why'd you two even bother joining the Dollars, huh?
Would you rather have a boring, quiet life instead?

Walker:
The only thing I wanna do is find a cute green-haired girl in a foreign land.
And then bring her back home so we can live together with three beautiful sisters.
Ah, if that happens, it'll be the best life ever.

Erika:
That was Yotsubato, right?

Saburo:
You know, speaking of the Slasher, the last attack was here.

Kyohei:
Look. That girl's not thinking.
Chicks like her always end up a target.

Saburo:
Ooh, that's not good.

Kyohei:
Yeah.

Walker:
What's wrong?

Kyohei:
That guy... He had red eyes.

Erika, Walker:
Huh?



Shizuo:
Hey, what's wrong?

Celty:
Nothing. I'm fine.
I just had a bit of flashback.

Anri:
Ooh, what am I doing?

Kyohei:
Saburo!

Saburo:
Got it!

Kyohei:
Got it.

Shizuo:
What now?
Hey! Where are you going?

Erika:
He dead?

Walker:
Oh, man!
Kyohei, now look at what you've done!
What's gonna happen to that sweet beautiful life I just told you about?!

Kyohei:
We didn't have any other choice.
Besides, it was self-defense.

Run!

The Headless Rider... And Shizuo?

Erika:
Dotachin, look!

Kyohei:
Why won't he die?

Shuji:
Hello. You're Shizuo Heiwajima?
I was looking for you, Shizuo.
I've wanted to meet you, Shizuo.

Shizuo Heiwajima.

I love you so, so, so, so, so, so much, Shizuo.

Shizuo:
Fine. You're dead.

Shuji:
That's right. I found him.
I found the toughest guy.
And I'm gonna interview him.
Then I'll write the article and then everything will be good.
My wife is gonna come back home.
My daughter and I will have a descent relationship again.
Things will be just like they used to be.



<Preview>

Celty, Shinra:
The Slasher incidents should have ended there.
But they didn't.
Instead, this girl's fate was just beginning to unfold.
It became a very long night.
Next time: Mutual Love.
