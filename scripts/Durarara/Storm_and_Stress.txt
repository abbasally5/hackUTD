Walker:
But for me, this is a sure sign if she's turning into a real Biri-biri Heroine.

Mikado:
Are you alright?

Girl with a scar on her neck:
Save me!

Shinra:
How do you intend to get your head back, anyway? It's attached to another body.

Celty:
I need to see this girl, no matter what.

Izaya:
Chances are pretty good Yagiri Pharmaceuticals sent them.

Namie:
Your big sis will handle it all, okay?

Izaya:
Honestly, I only half believed this was true.

Mikado:
Alright, I think all my cards are in order now.



Seiji:
I have to go. I have to go and get her back.
My sister can't do it. I have to do it. I have to do it myself!

Namie:
What do you mean? She wasn't there?

Yoshida:
Correct.
It seems by the time they arrived, she had already left.

Namie:
And the student who lives there... What's his name... Ryugamine?
Where is he?

Yoshida:
When the kid came back, they grilled him pretty hard.
Apparently, they were about to throw him in the van and bring him here.
But then, his friends showed up.

Namie:
So what?
You should have just brought his friends in as well.
You're useless.

Yoshida:
What's our next step?

Namie:
Hello?

Mikado:
Is this Ms. Namie Yagiri?

Namie:
With whom am I speaking?

Mikado:
My name is Mikado Ryugamine.
Would you like to make a trade?



Simon:
Welcome! Welcome!
Want Russia sushi? It's good! It's cheap.

Shizuo:
"What's the meaning of life? What's the reason we're here?"
Some guy asked me that once and I responded by pummeling his pathetic ass to chum.
I get an emo kid in junior high asking that, but a 20-something yakuza? That's just wrong.

Simon:
I see.

Shizuo:
Hey, Simon, come clean.
You're not getting a single word of this, are you?

Simon:
I see. Very true.

Celty:
I've been in this city for 20 years now.
After all this time, have I changed?

Shinra:
It wasn't a waste of time.
The 20 years you've lived here were well-spent.
Use what you've learned going forward. And you'll see your life has purpose here.

Celty:
Use what I've learned?
And how would I go about doing that?

Shinra:
For starters... you could marry me.

Celty:
Shinra...

Man:
Move it!

Namie:
Are you Mikado?
You're a much quieter kid than I had expected you to be.
Or maybe these days, kids like you are the scary ones.
So, what's this trade you mentioned?

Mikado:
Alright, look, I can tell you where to find the girl that you're looking for.

Namie:
I see. And what's your price?

Mikado:
No, I don't want your money.

Namie:
Then what exactly do you want?

Mikado:
I want the truth.

Namie:
Truth? I don't know what you're talking about.

Mikado:
I think you do.
All I'm asking is for you to tell the truth about what your brother did to Mika Harima, and about what you did to Mika's body.
Unfortunately, all my evidence is circumstantial.
I'll be more direct. Turn yourselves in.

Namie:
So, that's the kinda young man you are. Well...
If you impede my brother in any way, I will never forgive you.
Anyone who does that is obviously wrong. And I won't allow them to exist!

Mikado:
I see. So that's the kind of person she is.

Seiji:
Hey, tell me. Where can I find my sister?
I have to get out of here. That girl needs me.
I have to be there for her! Come on! Tell me where she is!

Mikado:
So that's why she did it.
Because of her twisted logic, one person died and another was horribly disfigured.
Now she's after me!

And this is the reason you toy with people.
Do you intend to make Seiji's life miserable now just for your own self-gain?

Namie:
This is the question you ask?
If a boy your age suddenly gets wrapped up in the underworld, and all he can do is shout cliches like that, then he should learn to shut his mouth.

Mikado:
This'll work, right?

Maybe it was cliche and simple, but so what? Who cares?
Someone like you may need cliches. After all, you can't understand the simple fact that murder is wrong!

Namie:
You watch too much TV.
This isn't a scripted show written by some hack. You're playing for real now.
You're not in a TV show or a movie, you don't have the starring role here.
So, know your place!

Mikado:
It's gonna be okay.

And just what's wrong with that?
With cliches! The expected! I'd love that!
I love tired old stories and happy endings! What's so wrong about wanting that?!
I'm not gonna tell you I'm doing this for humanity or for the sake of the world.
I just wanna see if it's true. Because I believe it is.

That's right. I believe. I believe in them.
They'll do it. I know it.

You're right. My ideas are pretty conventional.
But, that's just another way of saying, what I believe, exactly what the majority of people believe, too!

Namie:
That all you had to say? Are you done?

Mikado:
You refuse to listen to reason, and I'd have no luck against you just by myself.
You won't even give me the time to try. That's why... I'll rely on numbers!

Namie:
What?

Walker:
Check it out! Is everyone here in on this?

Erika:
Awesome!
This is so cool! It's like they lifted it straight out of "Missing"!

Walker, Erika:
It's here!

Saburo:
You guys shitting me?

Kyohei:
Alright, then... Saburo, you take it from here.

Saburo:
Uh, sure.

Kyohei:
Let's go.
Yo.


Erika:
How many people are there?

Walker:
This is so rad!
It's our first meeting ever and look at the turnout we got!
It's crazy huge!

Saburo:
This is it?
This is the Dollars?

Miria:
Hey, Issac?

Issac:
What is it, Miria?

Miria:
All these people who showed up here, they're all part of the Dollars, right?

Issac:
Yup! Damn straight, Miria!

Miria:
Wow!

Issac:
Here's the lowdown, honey bunch.
As of right now, we're officially part of this group of hepcats everyone's talking about!

Namie:
What is this?
They can't... Are they all really...
No! This can't be!

Miria:
Really?
Everyone just met for the first time today?
Oh my gosh! This is so cool! So cool! So cool! So cool! So cool! So cool!



Mikado:
Back home, the sky was big and vast.
But... There was nothing there.
When I was a kid, my town seemed like it was filled with adventure.
When did that change? When did I start feeling like this?
I wanted to change things. But I had no reason to leave or even the courage to do it.
And then, one day...

Wow. Hmm...
Okay, twice, and...

Suddenly, there were all these different worlds out there.
Worlds I'd never seen or talked to.
Masaomi had moved to Tokyo by then and we started emailing.
I made some new friends, too.
And then, one day, I had an idea.
It started out more as a joke than anything else.

His Majesty:
A gang?

Taro Tanaka:
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
I've heard there's a whole lot of 'em in Tokyo right now.

GG:
Are you saying you wanna make an online gang?

Taro Tanaka:
No, that's not what I mean.
I want people to think this one is real.
We'll just say the gang is in Ikebukuro.
And we'll spread the rumor all over the Internet.

Mikado:
None of us ever revealed that we were part of the Dollars.
We told people that we'd heard the rumor from somewhere else, and pretty soon, it was everywhere.
We made a website for the gang, one you can only access with a password.
Then we randomly leaked the password in emails and forums.
I even created a bunch of posts on our message board as other members.
Of course, a lot of people didn't believe us.
But after a while, people started to stick up for us.
Everyone was happy.

GG:
Dude, everyone's buying it!

ZAWA:
No, they're all idiots!

Mikado:
But I had a bad feeling...
People started appearing in the real world, saying they were in the Dollars.
That's not all.
Our member count was really skyrocketing, even though we'd long stopped giving out the password.
It was like someone else was leaking it for us.

Taro Tanaka:
Hey, guys, are you there?
Hello?

Mikado:
Maybe they got scared, but the guys who helped me start the Dollars had vanished.
Even though they left, I kept with it. Truth is, I couldn't stop.
Maybe I should have walked away then, but I didn't.

Taro Tanaka:
No, that isn't true.
I know there's been some bad people, but most of the people in the group are good. I know it.
Why don't we make the Dollars different from the other gangs?
Let's make it a good one. Let's always do what's right so we negate all the bad impressions the other gangs have left behind.
Like, picking up garbage or erasing graffiti. You know, stuff like that.

Announcer:
That's right. The entire neighborhood is completely mystified.
Sometime during the course of last night, the large amount of graffiti that had stained this neighborhood's wall suddenly disappeared by this morning.
It's hard to believe that one person could have removed so much graffiti.
At this juncture, on one in the neighborhood can provide a plausible explanation.

Mikado:
No, this can't be.

Masaomi invited me to Tokyo and I came. And then...



Mikado:
The Dollars?

Masaomi:
I don't know much about 'em. All's I know is there's a lot of 'em.
I also heard they're kinda crazy. How would ya stay away from them if I was you...
They're sort of like a color gang, but no one knows what color they are.

Kyohei:
I wouldn't try and get near them just for kicks.
The less you know about those guys, the better.

Haruko:
Wouldn't you guys see the Dollars are pretty hardcore right now?

Masaomi:
What are the Dollars like? Fill us in.

Ryou:
Well, guess I'd say "transparent" as in "no color."

Man A:
The Dollars? Yeah, I know 'em. In fact, I'm one of 'em.

Man B:
Once I joined the Dollars, I got a girlfriend.

Girl:
It's pretty cool. Post something random on their site...

Woman A:
...and no matter what, someone always responds.

Man C:
You know, at this age, meeting someone outside of work is otherwise impossible.

Man D:
D'you hear?
This dude was about to get snatched by those human trafficker guys, and the Dollars totally saved him!
The Dollars freaking rock!

Woman B:
I don't know. It seems cool, so why not?

Izaya:
This is so much fun. Who would have guessed?
Good times, right?

Namie:
What is... going on?
What is this? Who are these people?

Erika:
Hey, do you think whoever started the Dollars is here?
You see an Arabian oil sheik anywhere?

Walker:
Uh-uh, nowhere.
Hey Saburo, the guy who sent us that message is the guy who actually started the Dollars, right?

Saburo:
Yeah... That's what I heard.



Kyohei:
That's a red light! Red light! Red light!

Saburo:
She's not saying a word...

Erika:
Dotachin! Dotachin!

Kyohei:
I said don't call me that.

Walker:
Look! There's a response on the Dollars' message board!

Mikado:
Everything is in place now.
I'm gonna let you meet her.
However, first, I need you to do me a big favor.

Girl with a scar on her neck:
Celty.

Namie:
Where'd he go?
What're you just standing there for?
Find him and bring him back!

Namie's subordinate A:
Right! On it!

Namie's subordinate B:
Move it!

Namie's subordinate C:
Out of the way!

Man E:
Hey, watch it!

Celty:
Screw it!

Namie:
Who said that?

Celty:
That's right. I have no head! I'm a monster!
I have no mouth to speak my thoughts or eyes to convey my emotions!

Guys:
Are you hearing that?
Who's saying it?

Celty:
But so what?! Who gives a damn?! I don't care anymore!

Shizuo:
Celty...

Celty:
I am here. And I am real.

Namie's subordinate D:
Who the hell...

Celty:
If you say I have no eyes, then watch my actions very closely.
Listen to the cries of those around you, the ones who've angered this monster!

Namie's subordinate E:
It's... it's the Headless Rider...

Celty:
That's right, I'm here.
Right in front of you. Take a look.
Do you hear me screaming? This is my moment! This is my time to be born!
I am injecting my very existence into the veins of this city!

Seiji:
Are you Mikado Ryugamine?
Where's Celty? I want Celty. Give her back!



<Preview>

Celty:
That's right. I found something in this city that is genuinely true.
It's so simple and ordinary that it's hard to believe.
I think that boy has found it, too.
Next time: Yin and Yang.
