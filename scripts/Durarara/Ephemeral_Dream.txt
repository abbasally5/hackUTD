Masaomi:
Whoa, check it out. That chick is totally getting bullied.

Saburo:
And turning right!

Kyohei:
I think it's time that we had a little chat... about those human experiments you pricks are involved with.

Celty:
It was real and it was me. I know it.
What was I doing that night?

Seiji:
There you are. I've found you, my love.

Namie:
I don't want excuses.
Or perhaps, you would like to become a subject?

Shinra:
Let it go. Maybe you are complete without your head.



Taro Tanaka:
How come when you lose stuff, it's always the good stuff?
Say like a brand new umbrella. You'll lose that, but never the old crappy one.

Kanra:
Losing an umbrella's not so bad, but a winning lottery ticket...
That's something you stash away and then can't remember where.

Taro Tanaka:
And when you go look for it, you find everything but that.

Kanra:
Maybe we just think the stuff we lose is more important than the stuff we have.

Setton:
Hey there. Are you guys looking for something?



Celty:
Sometimes, I wonder...
When I'm asleep here, maybe it's actually awake over there.
And as my memories get hazier, I feel that my ability to sense the passing of time has become hazier, as well.
How long has it been? When did I stop seeing myself whole, even in dreams?
I'm here and there...
When I'm over there, what is the world that I'm in? And what am I looking at?
I have a dream that occurs over and over again. And in my dream, it's this question I'm trying to answer.
But what I see in that dream is always the same.

Shinra:
Celty! Listen to this!
Last night, you told me that you didn't have to work today, right?
So I just looked it up, this will be your first day off in the past 265 days!
Hm? Hmm... What's that sad look about?

Celty:
Somehow, he reads expressions on the face I don't have.
I heard that humans have dreams to organize their memories. Is that true?

Shinra:
Well, that's certainly a sudden question. Just what purpose do dreams serve?
To put it as simply as possible, we don't know for sure.
There're certain areas where medicine still has a long way to go, especially when it comes to up here.
All we know about dreams is that it occurs in the REM state, a level of sleep known as rapid eye movement...

Celty:
He's a doctor. An underground doctor, to be exact. To be honest, I don't really know all that he truly does.
He allows me to live here with him. And thanks to his generosity, I can continue working in this city as a transporter.

Shinra:
So then, I guess the real issue is that we don't really know what a memory is.
Are you listening?

Celty:
I feel very grateful to him.
And lately, I've come to realize that what I feel is most likely "love."
But...

Shinra:
You seem to be dead set on the idea that your memories are only contained in your head, but we just don't know that for sure.

Celty:
Of course that's where they are!

Shinra:
Enough about all this. Come on, why don't we get changed?
We should go and do something today. I'll take the day off with you.
See? I'm even turning off my phone.
Hey! I'll close the network, too! I'll pull the cord so I can't check email!
After all, there's no time like the present, right? So, where should we go?
What do you think about taking your horse down to the beach? Or maybe we go to a hot springs?

Celty:
I don't wanna go anywhere.

Shinra:
How come?

Celty:
If we're taking the day off, I'd like to cook for you. A sort of "thank you."

Shinra:
A home-cooked meal?

Celty:
Tell me what you want. We can look for a recipe.

Shinra:
I'm so moved, Celty!
Let's see, what do I want...



Mikado:
I'm sorry. I overslept today.
I guess I owe you one, man. Thanks for the textbook, it's a big help.

Masaomi:
No worries, my friend.
I figured the trip to Tokyo would begin to wear on you eventually.
Right now, for all us players, it's game on!
Cozying up to the ladies, rubbing shoulders while the two of you share a textbook.
So what's the deal? You losing the necktie now? Or d'you forget?
You okay? Did you forget your wallet, too?

Mikado:
Don't tell me I... How could I? Where was... Oh, no!

Simon:
Yummy Russia Sushi!

Erika:
Hey Simon, you seen Yumatchi around?

Simon:
Oh, Karisawa! You want sushi? Sorry, I no have today...

...and now we got no fish for sushi. So we look for fish now.

Erika:
Not here, either.
Dengeki Bunko's Accel World finally hits all the stores today.
After we both bought it, we went to get some tea and then split up.
After we left, one of the maids chased me down. She said Yumatchi left his cell phone behind.
Huh? Then don't try to get customers!

Siri:
Prego! Excuse me!
Why not you say me what you look for?

Erika:
I just said that Yumatchi... Who are you?
Lost stuff?

Siri:
You just write what you look for here! And who knows, maybe you find it!
You can tell me.

Erika:
Wow! This is so awesome! I'd love it!
Are you gonna be here all day?

Siri:
Si. I asking everyone in the area!

Walker:
My phone!

Maids:
Welcome home, Master!

Kyohei:
I wonder what it is I'm looking for. Kazutawno's safe and I should leave it at that.
I even told Walker and Erika that I would let it go. But for some reason, I can't.
What're you hiding in there?
They say Yagiri Pharmaceuticals are secretly tied to the Awakusu, or maybe the North American Nebra, Corp.
But, standing here or leaning on this tree isn't gonna help me find what I'm looking for.

Walker:
Hey Simon, you seen Erika?

Simon:
Today, no have.

Walker:
Man...

Simon:
Who want to eat at delicious Russia Sushi?



Shinra:
Wow! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Celty! Let's just use a normal knife, okay?
Wow. This is great! Really great! This is so good!

Celty:
Wait. Why are you crying?

Shinra:
Uh, am I really?
Oh, I'm just so impressed by you. This is really wonderful.
This super-sweet sauteed veggies with the salty-bitter miso soup...

Celty:
Something's wrong.

Shinra:
No. Your cooking is distinctive and unorthodox!
In fact, it's just like you are!

Celty:
That isn't a compliment!
I get it. I screwed up again.
It's fine! Don't force yourself to eat it!

Shinra:
But I'm not forcing myself. It really is quite good...

Celty:
I said don't eat it!

Shinra:
Hey! What are you doing?
How's this work, anyway?
Listen, I mean it. You really are a very good cook.
Who cares if you don't have a true sens du goût?

Celty:
Sense to what?

Shinra:
It means sense of taste.
See, if your DNA's lacking a sense of taste, your brain won't process it at all.
But you don't have to eat, so all this is irrelevant. So don't worry about it.
Come on, cheer up, will ya? Hey, what do you say we play a game?

Celty:
Don't treat me like a child. It'll just irritate me more.

Shinra:
I'm not, Celty.

Celty:
I admit. Most of my memories come from the years I've spent living with you.
But some of my foggy memories are over a hundred years old. And I know my head has more.

Shinra:
Do you really need memories from hundreds of years ago?

Celty:
What are you getting at?

Shinra:
Look, it's like I'm always saying.
You're not missing anything. You're fine the way you are.

Celty:
What do you know?
I'm forgetting my own face! Do you know what that feels like?

Shinra:
Wait, don't go! I'm sorry!



Shinra:
Celty! You came back!

Yoshida:
You've gotta keep your phone on, Doc.
There's someone we need you to fix up right away.

Mikado:
Hey Anri, something wrong?

Anri:
They're gone again.

Mikado:
Gone?

Masaomi:
What'd you forget this time, Mikado?

Mikado:
It's Anri. Her shoes are gone.

Masaomi:
Again? Man, people need to get a life.
I think that I might have an idea who's behind all this.

Anri:
Masaomi?

Masaomi:
Gotta go.

Mikado:
Hey, wait! Where are you go-

Anri:
Masaomi was a little scary just now. It was almost as if he was a different person.

Mikado:
You think so? I can't believe that he just left us. I mean, what's the rush?

Anri:
You know, when I was a kid, I used to lose things all the time.
I'd break down and start crying, "I can't find it! I can't find it!"
And that's when my mom would show up and help look for it.

Mikado:
Your mom sounds like she's pretty nice.

Anri:
Yeah. Both my mom and dad are really nice.
We can stop. It's fine. I'll just wear these home.
Thanks for helping me look, Mikado. I appreciate you trying to help.

Mikado:
Uh, but...
You can stop looking, Masaomi. Don't worry about who did it.
Not exactly. She just decided to go on home.
Huh? No, I have no idea. Me? Well, I'm still looking, of course.
Alright, see you tomorrow.
There they are!

Celty:
What am I doing?

Shizuo:
See? It's weird, isn't it?
I don't remember what was here at all.
Empty lots kinda trip me out. Once they're teared all down, it's hard to remember what was there.
Something used to be here, right? I mean, like something big.

Celty:
What am I thinking?
I get annoyed when Shinra tells me to let it go and stop looking for my head.
But look at me, here I am with the job, making friends...
It's like I've started thinking I'm a human...

Shizuo:
Anyway, you said you had something you wanted to talk to me about. What was it?

Celty:
I remember!
It was a long, skinny, blue building, right?

Shizuo:
Oh, yeah, that old crappy one!
There was an old lady on the first floor who sold cigarettes.
Way to go, Transporter.

Celty:
I know my head is in this town. I can feel it!
But...



Siri:
Buon giorno, how are you?

Mikado:
Me?

Siri:
I are look for something beautiful, and hoping in Japanese.
Go on. Why you not write down what you looking for, deep down in your heart.

Mikado:
Oh... Well, I, uh...
You know, would you mind if I took a look at that?

Siri:
Okay!

Mikado:
Wonder if she found him.
Today, I ended up looking for all kinds of stuff.
But, I found some stuff, and didn't find some stuff.

Celty:
His bag was gone, so I assumed he was on a job.
But... Something just didn't feel right.

Shinra:
Fireworks?

Yoshida:
Yeah, he went on quite a rampage. It took several of our guys to take him down.

Shinra:
All for fireworks?
Seems to me like your staff got a little outta hand.

Yoshida:
Well, it caused quite a scene. Kept spouting some gibberish.
About how his girlfriend was kidnapped and the only thing she remembers from that night was this place.
Then he demanded we tell him what we did to her.

Shinra:
He wasn't spouting gibberish, he was telling the truth.

Yoshida:
Anyway, Doc, think you can fix it?
Make it so that he doesn't remember this place when he wakes up?
That's all that we're asking of you, okay?

Shinra:
There's no easy way to do that. Memories are a tricky thing to get rid of.
And plus, I'll remember this kid.

Yoshida:
Listen, we are gonna release him.
But, whether he will go home or not, I'm not so sure.
Alright, let's be clear, Doctor. The chief and I both trust you completely.
After all, you are keeping that thing a secret.
Oh, and, by the way, that roommate you have.
She is more than just your average houseguest, isn't she?

Celty:
At that moment, my focus shifted.
I wasn't thinking about my head. Nor the century worth of Dullahan memories that live inside it.
I wasn't thinking of anything, except... that...

Shinra:
Hey, will you come eat with me?
The restaurant won't complain, if I order dinner for two.
I know a really great place. Please, Celty!
To be honest, I hate eating by myself.

What is this convoluted mystery food in front of me?

Simon:
Fried chicken sushi, cheese sushi, mabo sushi, prosciutto sushi, and this, this sour cream sushi!

Shinra:
None of this should ever be sushi!

Simon:
Why it wrong? It a special plate! And it good price!

Shinra:
They're serving fortune cookies for dessert? Come on, you gotta be kidding.
You've seen these before, right? There's a piece of paper inside that tells your fortune.
Let's see what it says. This one's yours.
Let me see. Hm... Wow, according to your fortune, you're gonna find what you're looking for.
Easy, I'm not used to you being so happy.

Celty:
I'm very happy, Shinra! So, what does yours say?

Shinra:
My cookie didn't have a fortune.

Celty:
As I am now, I can't cry.
I don't know, when I'm sad here, is it sobbing somewhere else?

Anri:
Thanks a lot.

Celty:
Regardless, I hope wherever it is, it's smiling.

Seiji:
What is it?
You're still scared. No one's here. We're totally alone.
Hey, what's wrong? Can you remember anything yet?
It's alright. That isn't important to me.
I told you before, I don't care about your past, just our future.
Just as you are now. Together, we are the future.
I do love you, Celty.

Celty:
That night, for the first time in years, I had a dream of when I was whole.

Tá mé anseo. Anseo.



<Preview>

Namie:
My love is different.
It's not the kind of love that is always in need, always looking.
It's more perfect than that.
Next time: Love and Cherish.
What Seiji needs is me.
