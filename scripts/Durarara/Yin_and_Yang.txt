  <Opening>

Mikado:
I'll rely on numbers!

Walker, Erika:
It's here!

Saburo:
This is the Dollars?

Namie:
What is this?
They can't... Are they all really...

Shinra:
For starters... you could marry me.

Yoshida:
After all, you are keeping that thing a secret.

Girl with a scar on her neck:
Celty...

Izaya:
This is so much fun.

Celty:
Do you hear me screaming? This is my moment! This is my time to be born!

Seiji:
I want Celty. Give her back!



Seiji:
I have to thank you for what you've done.
If it weren't for you, I'm pretty sure my sister would have just locked her in that cramped research lab again.

Mikado:
Seiji...
You okay?

Seiji:
I want you to give Celty back.
She and I have to get out of here before the cops arrive.

Mikado:
You think this'll work? It won't!

Seiji:
You don't know anything about this.
I've been watching and admiring her ever since I was a little kid.
I wanted to set her free, release her into this great big world, where the two of us would live together forever.
She's all I ever think about, every day, every hour, every minute.
What can I say? No one can stop the power of love.
But enough about me. What about you?
Seems like you keep relying on numbers to help you out.
It'll take more than that to stop our love!
It's no use! Pain means nothing to me!
There'll be no pain in the life I'll have with Celty!
Beat me all you want, I don't care, I won't feel it!

Mikado:
That's insane!

Girl with a scar on her neck:
Don't touch!
Please don't hurt him!
Just listen, I know Seiji is harsh and violent at times, but he's not a bad person!
And there's someone in this world he truly loves.

Mikado:
No way...

Celty:
No... This can't be, this can't be...

Mikado:
I don't believe it, that's...

Celty:
That isn't my head.

Mikado:
That girl... Is her name...
Mika Harima?
You're her, aren't you? The girl that Seiji supposedly killed.
You're Mika Harima.

Seiji:
Can't be.
Tell me, he's wrong.

Mika:
I'm so sorry!



Mika:
Hello, Seiji. I know that you're in there.
I've come back again!
Oh, no! You forgot to leave the door open for me.
I can't come in and see you! Are you sleeping right now?
Do you remember me? I'm the girl who sat next to you during the entrance exam at school.
To my right was some kid with a weird last name like "Ryugamine,"
so I turned to my left to see what that person's last name was, and fell in love the moment I saw you.
When our eyes met, you smiled at me...
Come on, Seiji! Show me your face again! Please, please!
Maybe you're not feeling good. Is that why you can't answer the door?
If that's the case, then don't worry about it. I'll open it... right now.
After we met taking the exam, I did a little research.
I know your birthday, and your family...

S-Seiji?

Seiji:
You saw it.

Mika:
Yeah, but...
It's okay. I won't tell anyone, I promise!
I-I won't tell a soul.
Whatever you're into, it's fine, I'm cool with it!
Um, so I...

Seiji:
It's okay.

Mika:
Seiji!

Seiji:
It's okay.

Mika:
Seiji? A-Are you...

Seiji:
It's okay.



Mika:
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I didn't die!
And then, your sister...

Namie:
You want Seiji to love you, right?
Good girl.

Mika:
And that's when this doctor showed up.
He said that with a little plastic surgery and some makeup, I could look just like the head that you're in love with.
He told me my name would be Celty. Because that's what the head is called.
I tried, I tried hard to be Celty for your sake. But your sister said it wasn't enough.
She wanted me to start taking drugs and have more surgery to erase my memories.
I didn't wanna do that. I didn't wanna forget that I loved you.

Celty:
A doctor who knows my name, who knows that I'm a Dullahan.
There's only one person like that in this whole city!

Mika:
I did all this for you, so I can be with you!

Seiji:
No, this can't be true. This means that...

Izaya:
Well, you couldn't even tell the difference between the genuine article and the fake.
Guess your love wasn't that strong after all. Sucks to be you.

Mika:
Seiji!

Mikado:
Um, I have to say the fact that you were willing to risk your life to get her back is pretty admirable.
And it turns out that it was actually wrong about Mika.
Some other things she does may be strange, but I really don't think she's a stalker.
I mean, you risked your life to save Seiji.
I don't think someone would do that if they were only in it for themselves.
And even though he tried to kill you, you still loved him. That's amazing.
In some ways, so then I guess, you and Seiji... you're a lot alike.



Shinra:
Welcome home.
I'm guessing you wanna know why I did what I did.
And your next question is, "You've known all along, haven't you? That my head was in their lab.
I bet you and your dad had been working with Yagiri Pharmaceuticals this whole time.
And chances are, it was your dad who took my head from me in the first place.
But for some reason you decided to hide all that from me, and butchered some poor innocent girl's face instead.
I may be a monster, but the savage beast who really destroys people's lives is you." Was that close?
Look, I just don't want there to be any confusion on this.
I really don't know if my dad stole your head or not, and to be honest, I don't care.
And that poor girl you spoke of volunteered for that surgery.
Although, chances are, Yagiri did persuade her to do it.
But in the end, that's none of my business.
"Do you really know what I'm thinking? Are you actually reading my mind?" You ask?
Yes, of course I can. I've loved you for 20 years, Celty. I can tell what you're thinking.

Celty:
But then, why? If you love me, why didn't you tell me where my head was?

Shinra:
That's the reason. It's because I love you that I didn't tell you.
If you had your head, then I'm afraid you would leave me. And I know that I couldn't bear that.
Even though I knew it'd make you happy, I couldn't tell you.
We're each fighting for something. And what's at stake are our hearts.
I never wanna lose you. And if I have to sacrifice the life and love of others, or even myself, then so be it.
It's hypocritical, but if I have to use your emotions, too, I will.

Celty:
I don't know why you think that.
Even if I had my head, I wouldn't leave you, I...

Shinra:
That may be what your heart wants, but your head may not feel the same.
I've really thought about this. You're a mythical faerie. Why do you choose to reveal yourself to humans as easily as you do?
Maybe, somehow by losing your head, it's allowed you to take on more of a physical form.
And if that's true, then who's to say after you get your head back that you won't just vanish into thin air, as if all of this was nothing more than a dream?
That's my biggest fear.

Celty:
Will you believe what I'm about to say?

Shinra:
If you say it's true, I'll believe you.
To be honest, you're the only one I believe.

Celty:
I'm scared, too. I'm scared of dying.
I know that in my current physical state, no one's capable of killing me.
This isn't me being arrogant, it's just a statement of fact.
I take no joy or satisfaction from this. It's just true.
But, to be honest, that's what scares me the most.
My body has no control over whether or not I live or die. My head has that power.
And if someone were to destroy my head, then I would die, too, no matter what I want or where I am.
I need you to believe what I'm telling you. I may not have a brain or eyes, but this gives me nightmares.
I need you to believe that this thought terrorizes me.
I'm scared of the fact that my own death may be staring me in the face and I won't even see you coming.
That's why I want my head. Please, tell me you believe this.

Shinra:
I told you. You're the only one I do believe.
This is quite a conundrum. Both of us are getting very upset by situations that are simply hypothetical.

Celty:
Yeah, you're right.
Hey, Shinra.

Shinra:
What is it?

Celty:
I need to hit you.

Shinra:
Do it!
All right, now I get to hit you back.

Perfect! You're prettiest when you're not hiding your face, you know.
That punch was a kiss to celebrate our marriage, okay?
Are you crying?



Izaya:
That was quite astounding. Hm?

Kyohei:
Yo, Izaya.

Izaya:
Dotachin! Been a while.

Kyohei:
Will ya stop calling me that?

Izaya:
Yeah, anyways, do you know where the name "the Dollars" comes from?

Kyohei:
Isn't it something like "Give me all your dollars?"

Izaya:
No, not even close.
It comes from the fact that they don't do anything.
They just doodle around all day. But "Dollars" sounds cooler.

Erika:
Dotachin! Tell me you saw it, too! The Black Rider!

Walker:
I totally can't believe that just happened!
I didn't hallucinate all that craziness, did I?
It was like a CG character or something!

Izaya:
That CG character is also part of the Dollars.

Erika, Walker:
Wow!

Kyohei:
Is that true?

Erika, Walker:
That is so cool! So cool! So cool!

Izaya:
I'm a little shocked by all this.
I knew there were a lot of people online claiming that they were members of the Dollars.
However, I had no idea so many of them would actually make an effort to turn up when a meeting was finally called.
Human beings defy imagination.
Remember, I know you came here to Tokyo, hoping to escape the humdrum.
But in about 6 months, this'll all seem pretty ordinary to you.
At that rate, you'll have to move to another country to keep things exiting, or start looking for things that are a little more underground.
But I'd be willing to bet that you would get bored of that in just a few days, as well.
The only way to truly escape the mundane is for you to constantly be evolving.
Whether you choose to aim high or aim low. Enjoy each day for what it is.
Now, as a sign of respect, I've decided not to charge you for Namie Yagiri's private cell phone number.
And I'm not gonna sell you out on being the founder of the Dollars.
It's your organization. Use it however you choose.

Shizuo:
Izaya!

Izaya:
Looks like it's time for me to go.
Best of luck to ya, Taro Tanaka!

Shizuo:
Get back here, you bastard!
Izaya!

Mikado:
Was that...?



Celty:
And that was it. The next day, everything went back to normal.
For this guy. And that guy. And for the boy.

Masaomi:
Hey, Mikado. Guess what I read online.
The Dollars had a huge meeting yesterday!
They're saying it was off the hook! And that Shizuo and Simon are totally part of 'em!
And that Black Rider was there, and it is headless!
It like rolled down walls, and it has this scythe, which was totally swinging around all crazy like!

Mikado:
You're not making any sense, you know.

Celty:
And even for those two.

Seiji:
I don't have any love for you at all.
But, whenever I see your face, I'm reminded of the passion and love I have for her.
So with that in mind, I'll accept your love until the day I finally get her back.



Taro Tanaka:
Hey, guys.

Setton:
Hey, I just been hanging around.

Taro Tanaka:
Oh, hey.
'Fraid I won't be here long. I'm kinda tired tonight.

Setton:
What? You pulled an all-nighter?

Taro Tanaka:
Yeah, kinda.

Setton:
Looks like Kanra still isn't here yet.

Taro Tanaka:
Wonder if Kanra will show up.

Setton:
Hey, something just came up. I gotta run.

Taro Tanaka:
Yeah, sure.

Setton:
Sorry, see you later.

Taro Tanaka:
See ya.



Shinra:
Hey. Sorry, but a job just came in.
They said it's kinda urgent.

Celty:
That's fine.

My life, it went back to normal, as well.
Running across people I'd rather not meet.
Just like it was any other day.

Izaya:
It looks like you've moved on.
You know, people are afraid of spooky things, 'cause they tend to lurk in the dark and then jump out at ya.
After that little entrance you made, I doubt anyone's gonna be scared of you anymore.
Thinking back, you didn't kill anyone, did you?
That scythe's all bark and no bite.
I'm guessing you're gonna go after that woman now.
I would be glad to help you out with that. Just call me.
Bye now.

Celty:
I have no idea where Namie Yagiri went.
But I don't care. I'm me. And that's enough.
My days were always pretty uncomplicated, not too full of hope or despair.
And they're still like that. It's just that now, I find them incredibly satisfying.
Here I am. And there you are.
If you can find redemption in me, then I can do the same with you.

And the young boy is still pondering his conversation with Izaya Orihara.
Can a person truly have a life that's always new? Always full of excitement and impossibility?
Or is it just a matter of time before that, too, becomes part of the every day?

Seiji:
Hey, I'm sorry for everything.

Mika:
And thank you.

Girl:
Wait a sec! That's my seat!

Mika:
Well, there's a spot open behind the class rep.

Girl:
Huh? Who do you think you are?
You can't just show up and take somebody's seat.

Celty:
As for her, chances are she won't be spending much time with Mika Harima anymore.
And in the end, only she will know if that's the right decision. But then, maybe she won't.
It's rare for a person to truly understand their own heart.
As someone once said, the best thing you can do is keep evolving.
He was empowered by his previous actions. So he thought he could do anything now.
But unfortunately, what the young boy had failed to account for was the sheer amount of courage it would take in order for him to ask out his classmate.

In 30 seconds, the boy will find the girl.
In 35 seconds, the boy will discover his best friend hitting on the girl.
In 45 seconds, the boy will kick the crap out of him.
In 74 seconds, the girl will reject the boy's offer to get coffee.
And in 78 seconds, that girl will ask the boy to have lunch with her on the roof.
How long will it take for him to fall in love with her?
And how long before he works up the nerve to tell her?



Izaya:
I gotta say, that was very foolish of you.
You threw away everything for your brother's twisted version of love.
Or maybe, it was your twisted love for your brother?
So this can't look good, can it?
You're about to merge with the Nebra people.
Let them catch wind of something like this, and the next thing you know you've got some mafia hit-man on your tail.
Then after that... Pow! And checkmate!

Cleaning crew?

Man:
That's them. That's the normal crew they use.

Izaya:
Got it.

Hello? Things are getting a little bit heated in your neck of the woods.
You should get out of there soon.

I wish the king pieces could fight each other. They should change that rule.
I've gotta think that your uncle was a lot like me.
He questioned the afterlife more than anyone, feared death more than anyone, and longed for heaven more than anyone.
But the afterlife, well that, I believe in. We'll just leave it at that.
For whatever reason, Dullahans are always depicted as women in the legends.
Do you know why that is?

Namie:
No, I don't.
My men did a little research on the myths, but in the end, I thought it was a waste of time.

Izaya:
You're always the pragmatic one. Well, suit yourself.
There's a place called Valhalla. It's sort of like a heaven.
And according to Nordic mythology, the soul of a fallen warrior is guided to Valhalla by an armored female angel known as a Valkyrie.
A woman who comes to greet the dead... Doesn't that sound familiar?
Some theorize that a Dullahan is actually a Valkyrie who was wandering around on Earth.
And if that's true, then this head is probably waiting.
Waiting to wake up for war. Then she can find her warrior and take him to Valhalla.
That's why she's alive, but with her eyes closed, because we aren't on a battlefield.
It's my wish that she would choose me as her warrior.
If there truly is a Valhalla awaiting me after death, how do I even prepare for this?
I mean, I know I'm not really cut out for battlefield heroics.
So then I'll have to start a war that only I can win. Right?
Aren't I the lucky one?
Imagine me, who doesn't believe in a heaven, much less a virtuous life.
And yet I still meet an angel of death who's fallen to Earth.

Namie:
Whatever.
That's simply a theory of yours.

Izaya:
Whosoever believeth will be saved.
This is just insurance, really.
Even if I do end up in a hell surrounded by pain, as long as I could exist, I wouldn't care.
But that said, if it is at all possible, I would still prefer heaven.
Hey, Namie! Why don't we all go to heaven?
As a member of the Dollars, I'm gonna keep this, hiding in plain sight.
The last place Celty is gonna look for her head is within the same gang that she belongs to.
I know! You should become part of the Dollars, too!
It's a little known fact that our boss doesn't turn down anyone.
Of course, after a while, I was the one who was instrumental in gathering people.
I say we give this fallen angel a pair of wings again. What do you think?



<Preview>

Anri:
In her daily life, nothing ever happens, nothing ever changes...
Even though things are born and disappear in this city every single day.
Next time: Takes a Sudden Turn.
