  <Opening>

Mikado:
That was like, a convenience store trashcan.

Masaomi:
Whatever you do, stay away from Shizuo Heiwajima.

Izaya:
You know, the problem with you, Shizu-chan, is that you can't be swayed by reason and that's bad.

Shizuo:
Didn't I tell you never to set foot in Ikebukuro again?

Simon:
Shizuo. Fighting always bad.

Shizuo:
Shut up!

Yoko:
What? The toughest guy in Ikebukuro?

Gang member:
Oh no, it's gotta be that other cat...

Gang members:
Shizuo Heiwajima!



Man:
They just like fired me for nothing!
And they kicked me out of my company housing, too!
Not to mention no severance pay. Now I've got no money, no food, no nothing!
And you think the government's gonna help a guy like me out? Huh, I don't think so.
It's the government's fault that I'm in this spot to begin with!

Tom:
So you borrowed money to bang some bathhouse chick?

Man:
It's love!
She's not just some chick! Mint and I have true love!

Tom:
Huh?

Shizuo:
You're bugging.

Man:
I don't have her number. And I can only see her at work.
But I mean it! What we have is real!

Shizuo:
You piss me off!
The only time this girl will see you is at the bathhouse? And she hasn't even given you her phone number?

Tom:
Yo, yo, yo! Shizuo!

Shizuo:
Let me say this up front.
You are telling me... you really think...

Tom:
Oh, boy...

Shizuo:
THAT'S TRUE LOVE?!!!!
I really hate violence.



Kanra:
Have you heard?
That Shizuo guy's been on a rampage lately. Something's got him super pissed off.

Setton:
What?

Taro Tanaka:
You mean that guy who dresses like a bartender? Shizuo Heiwajima...

Kanra:
Yeah.
He's always been pretty scary. But lately, he's gotten much worse.
They say Ikebukuro is a total war zone right now!

Taro Tanaka:
You know, I saw him once.
He is kinda scary, he could do some serious damage...

Setton:
I dunno...
We shouldn't go assuming things we haven't seen for ourselves.

Kanra:
Why are you sticking up for him, Setton? Do you know him?
Or maybe, you're in with the Yakuza?! Oh, you're scary! Save me!

Setton:
That's not it!



Tom:
Come on, man, chill out.
We can't collect anything if you keep smashing people into walls all the time.

Shizuo:
Sorry...
Smells like shit...

Tom:
They said he hasn't been home for two or three days.
Been hearing a lot of that lately. It's gotta be the human traffickers.

Shizuo:
Smells like shit.

Man A:
Whoa, that guy's really hurt!

Man B:
They said it was the Slasher.

Man C:
Just now?

Man D:
Yeah, I saw it! It ran that way!

Tom:
Argh... 'bukuro's just getting crazier by the day.

Shizuo:
More shit.

This whole freaking town smells like shit. Whatever it is, it pisses me off.

Simon:
Well now, it's Shizuo and Mr. Tom.

Tom:
Hey, Simon.

Simon:
Shizuo?

Tom:
Sorry, he's been kinda cranky lately.

Simon:
Shizuo acting like he in puberty?

Tom:
Kinda. More like a rebel, I guess.

Simon:
Like label?

Kyohei:
Hey, long time no see.

Shuji:
So, looks like he's gonna be starring in another movie.
Yuhei Hanejima sure is popular right now. I mean, Kasuka Heiwajima.
Being his older brother must make you pretty proud, Shizuo Heiwajima.
Sorry, I'm Shuji Niekawa. Here's my card.
His good looks definitely don't hurt him. But he also happens to be a pretty good actor.
What was it? The name of the first big movie he did. Oh yeah, that's right. It was Vampire Ninja Carmilla Saizo.

I knew right away that kid was gonna be big. And from everything I've read, he even did his own stunts in that movie.
There are some people out there who say you taught him that. If you ever wanna talk a little bit about it, I'd love to hear it.

Tom:
Ah, damn!

Shizuo:
Earlier, when I said that I hate violence, I meant that. Truth is, I haven't always been this way...



Shizuo:
The first time, I got in a fight with my little brother, Kasuka.
It was over something stupid, but I snapped and tried to hurl a refrigerator at him.

The refrigerator idea wasn't a conscious one. My body just sort of went into auto pilot.
After that...

Shizuo's classmates:
Shizuo's a lemon! Lemon! Stupid stupid lemon!

Shizuo:
I couldn't help myself. When I got mad, my body just started to move on its own.
And each time it happened...

Shinra:
Humans can get extra strong in the crisis, but I think you're different. I think you can always get there.
A normal person's brain limits their strength, because if you didn't hold back, you'd destroy your muscles and bones.
But your brain behaves differently. It lets your body go wild! It's a mysterious wonder like no other!
You're like some kinda scientific discovery. You know what? If you were to let me try and disse-
Huh? Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow! That hurts! Shizuo, that hurts!

Shizuo:
I don't know how that works. I just know I can't control my anger.
And when I do get angry, I destroy everything, including my own body. That's all I've learned.
So since then, I've stopped holding back. If I couldn't do it anyway, why bother trying?
Broken bones? Hah, who gives a damn?!
I've wrecked my body a thousand times now, and each time, I come back stronger.
Shinra once said, "You know what?" Screw what he said! I come back tougher every time!
But still...

Baker:
Hey. You seem to get hurt an awful lot, are you okay? Stay right there.
Here you go. You need to drink some milk and strengthen those bones. Same for you!

Kasuka:
Thank you.



Shizuo:
I'd screwed up. I didn't mean to, but then I never do...

Shinra:
Good morning!

Shizuo:
Why did this happen? My family was basically normal.
It's not like I had some big trauma in my life. And yet...

Kasuka.

Kasuka:
Yeah?

Shizuo:
Don't you ever get scared of me?

Kasuka:
Not really.

Shizuo:
It wasn't until I entered Raira that it hit me.

Simon:
Grand opening discount sale! This shop is fresh! The fish are fresh!

Shinra:
Hey, we're going to the same school again. Kinda feels like fate, doesn't it?

Shizuo:
Shut your hole.

Shinra:
Hey! How's your body holding up? I know! You could let me give you an exam!
So, no? Okay, then, how about a blood sample?
Celty! What happened yesterday? When you didn't come home, I was worried.
Were you trying to track down your head again? Yeah, right! I bet you met a guy and you were out-
Celty... Would you stop punching me? Okay, okay, okay, Celty, I'll introduce you...

Shizuo:
It was the oddest feeling. I don't even know how to describe it. It just... came outta nowhere...
I'd suddenly remembered something bad. That's right. Of course.
It was exactly when that blood-sucking little flea showed up.
That's him. Izaya Orihara!



Shizuo:
And there he was.

Shinra:
Meet Izaya Orihara from our junior high. And well, he's a pretty good guy.

Shizuo:
From the second I saw him, I hated him.

Shinra:
To be honest, he's not really good at all.

Izaya:
That isn't nice, Shinra.

Shinra:
No, no, I meant that in a good way.

Shizuo:
You piss me off.

Izaya:
Oh, yeah?
Too bad. I was thinking you and I could have some real fun together.

Shizuo:
Shut up.

Izaya:
Now why you gotta be like that, Shizuo?

See? Isn't this a blast?

Shizuo:
And that was it.
We've been trying to kill each other from the very first day we met.
There's no good reason, I just don't like him.
But...

Driver:
Are you okay?

Izaya:
It's alright. Don't worry. He's quite virile.

Driver:
Are you sure we shouldn't take him to the hospital?

Izaya:
No, no. He'll be fine. That'll be all.

Shizuo:
Yeah. I screwed up.



Shinra:
Oh, what a coincidence! Izaya's here as well!

Izaya:
Interesting. How are you still standing?

Shizuo:
That started a whole chain of events.

You're dead! You're dead! You're dead! You're dead! You're dead! You're dead! You're dead!
You are so freaking dead!

Word got out. And soon, every gang of rejects in this city tried to jump me.
I haven't done anything. All I was trying to do was live a nice, peaceful life!

Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! So pissed off!
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!
Yeah, I know.

Man:
Die!

Shizuo:
Izaya. He was the one sicking these bastards on me!
When I realized that...

Izaya!

If only I could have killed him right then and there! Damn it!
After we graduated from Raira...

Shinra:
So, what'd you think?

Shizuo:
This idiot, well, he's the same, but that flea has been hatching something with the yakuza.
But for a while there, things were quiet. So, what did I do?

Yeah, none of that worked out too well.

Bartender:
Come on in.

Man E:
Did you see that?

Man F:
No way!

Man G:
It's that actor guy...

Man H:
Yuhei Hanejima.

Shizuo:
Hey, Kasuka. What brings you here? Hm?
A bartender getup.

Kasuka:
You shouldn't be changing jobs all the time.
I bought you several different pairs. This way, you can stay here awhile.

Shizuo:
Thanks, man. Well, I'll do my best.
And so...

Son of a...
Izaya!

That little maggot set me up.
He slipped out of 'bukuro pretty quickly. The police soon realized I was innocent and let me go.
But...

Sorry, I didn't mean to break my promise...

Tom:
Hey, Shizuo!

Shizuo:
Hm?



Shizuo:
Tom and I go all the way back to junior high.
He was starting a debt collection agency and wanted my help.
Basically, I became a muscle. I wasn't into it at first. That's when Tom said...

Tom:
Listen man, you don't gotta beat up on all of 'em.
Once I say the name "Shizuo Heiwajima", most people pay up.

Shizuo:
That's what he tried to tell me, anyway.
That was also around the same time Kasuka started getting busy.
It's been a long time since I last saw him. I wonder if I've let him down.

Tom:
What's that about?

Girls:
Yuhei!

Staff:
Alright Yuhei, we're ready!

Shizuo:
I don't know why, but I felt better about things. And, yeah. I'm still working with Tom.

Boy A:
Repayment schedule?
Humph. Dude, we went to public school, I don't know any of that crap.

Boy B:
Yeah, totally. We're just victims of the system, man. We never had a chance.

Tom:
All right, come on...

Boy C:
Dude, I told you we don't got it. Now get lost, old man.

Tom:
Sorry, but this is what I do for living.

Boy A:
Hey dude, what's that look for?

Tom:
Yo, kid!

Boy B:
And what's with that lame-ass getup?

Boy A:
Yeah, you look like a freaking butler.

Boy B:
What are you thinking?

Tom:
Seriously, you don't know who Shizuo is?

Boy C:
No. What, is he famous?

Boy A:
Mr. Butler man... Score! Ha, ha!
Would you kindly bring me another drink please, Mr. Butler man?

Tom:
They're in 'bukuro, and they don't know Shizuo. Guess they did go to a public school.

Shizuo:
What I'm wearing... was a gift from my little brother...

But like I said, I really hate violence. I just wanna get stronger.
Strong enough so that someday, I can contain my anger...

You know, I feel better after telling you all this. Thank you.

Celty:
Good. I'm glad to hear it.

Shizuo:
I've just been so pissed off lately, and I don't know why.

Celty:
Yeah, I heard something along those lines, so I came to check on you.

Shizuo:
Well, it's all good. Sorry to have worried you. Hm?
Shut up. See ya.

I don't fit in with most people, but I don't like being alone, either.
So I try to stay connected through guys like Tom or Kasuka.
She's a lot like me. I'm sure she has someone, too...

Kyohei:
Yo. Huh?

Simon:
Shizuo! You finish going through puberty?
Then come eat some sushi! It's good! Sushi yummy!

Shizuo:
Another time.

Izaya... I thought I smelled something bad tonight! It was you!
What is he up to? Nothing good comes from him being back here!
Damn it! IZAYA!!!



<Preview>

Celty:
I have this dream. I have it over and over again.
I wonder if when it's awake, I'm asleep here, and when I'm awake here, it's asleep.
Next time: Ephemeral Dream.
