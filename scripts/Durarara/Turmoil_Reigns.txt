  <Opening>

Taro Tanaka:
I see a lot more people around this city are wearing yellow now.

Setton:
The Yellow Scarves, right?

Kanra:
Hey, did you guys hear?
Everybody's saying that the Dollars are actually the Slasher.

Yellow Scarves member:
Come on, man, we can't do anything without you.

Izaya:
So, how is he?

Saki:
He does come by here sometimes.
But that's as far as he goes.

Shingen:
Wouldn't you agree that the air in Tokyo is filthy?

Yoko, Akie, Haruko:
Parasite! Parasite! Parasite!



Kanra:
Did you hear?
Rumor is, some students from Raira Academy were attacked by the Slasher.

Taro Tanaka:
Huh? Really?

Setton:
That's scary.

Kanra:
This stuff is way serious, guys!
They say it was some freshman girl.

Taro Tanaka:
Sorry.
Gotta make a call. Away from keyboard.

Kanra:
Don't worry.
It doesn't sound like it's your girlfriend.

Taro Tanaka:
Thanks. But I'm still kinda worried.

Setton:
Do you know where the attack happened?

Kanra:
Totally.
It was near the East-Ikebukuro subway station, right next to the freeway.
With all the cop cars that are there right now, finding it should be no big deal.

Setton:
Really?
Hey. Sorry, I have to go.

Kanra:
Setton, are you rubbernecking?
Ah, come on!

Taro Tanaka:
Sorry, guys. I gotta go.

Kanra:
What? You get a hold of your girlfriend?

Taro Tanaka:
She's at the police station right now.
Sounds like she may have even seen part of it.
I should go see her.

Kanra:
Oh. Guess I'll go, too.



Celty:
The Slasher...
The perpetrator of this bloodthirsty crime had a close connection with one girl's fate.
My own past was tied to all this, as well.
But I had absolutely no idea at the time.



Shinra:
I'm back! Hm?
It's time for you to welcome me back!
Get ready!
Celty, I'm home now!

Shingen:
Ooh! Hi, honey.

Shinra:
Aaargh!

Celty:
What's wrong?

Shinra:
I have seen the face of hell.

Celty:
Huh?
The face of what?

Shinra:
Don't make me talk about it!
I just wanna forget!

Shingen:
Whew, I'm a new man.

Shinra:
Will you take that damn mask off at least when you're taking a shower?

Shingen:
Absolutely not!
Tokyo's air is so filthy I can never take this off.
By the way, Celty, nice work yesterday.
But tell me, just who were those yellow-coated hooligans swearing at me last night.

Shinra:
They would be the Yellow Scarves.
They started showing up right after you left for the States.
However, I thought they were trying to lay low after that fight they had with the Blue Squares.

Shingen:
Well, I hope all those gangs destroy each other and then die in the sewers.

Celty:
Don't be absurd.

Shinra:
Listen, you really ought to pay Celty for getting you back here safe and sound.
She didn't have to do that, you know.

Shingen:
Hm... Put it on my tab.

Shinra:
Your credit is no good here.

Shingen:
Guess I'll just have to skip out on my bill then.
Oops.
I was just testing you, Celty. That's all.
If you release me, then I can-
Ow! Ow! They're poking me! They're poking me!
Those shadowy things are poking me!
Shinra! Can't you see I am in grave danger here?
If you were truly my son, you would know the antidote for this situation!

Shinra:
Of course I do!

Celty:
Pleasure doing business.

Shingen:
You're not getting any inheritance.
Remember that.

Shinra:
Fine. I don't need it.

Shingen:
I see this monster has made you into her slave.

Shinra:
If that's what Celty wants, I have no problem at all being her slave.

Shingen:
What? Oh goodness gracious!
Don't tell me this is true.
Are you actually in love with my son, Celty?

Celty:
Wha-

Shingen:
I always knew my boy was weird enough to be attracted to you.
But are you really in love with him, too?

Celty:
I am.

Shinra:
Celty!
I'm so happy that you're being honest about our relationship, I'm ecstatic!
I never thought that this day would ever come to fruition, it's fantastic!
A situation that started out so long ago as unrequited love has blossomed into a healthy relationship that we can now share with others!
My heart is bursting with joy right now!

Celty:
Shut up! You're embarrassing me!

Shingen:
Do you honestly think that I will allow this relationship?

Celty:
What'd you say?

Shingen:
You're an uninvited guest trying to blend in with human society!
Are you aware of the fact that you are commonly referred to as a monster?

Celty:
Of course.

Shingen:
Of course she says.

Celty:
So what?
I fail to see the problem.

Shingen:
It seems my plan to point out that she's a social misfit has failed miserably.

Celty:
Says the man who wears a gas mask everywhere.
More importantly...
Shinra says he likes me exactly as I am!

Shingen:
Humph! Fine! I'll allow it.
However! It is only on one condition...
You have to call me "Father!"

Celty:
Shut up!

Shingen:
Regardless, Celty, you realize without your head, your memories will never return.
Your remembrance of your life as a Dullahan in your native Ireland will be gone forever.

Celty:
Well, there's nothing I can do about that...

Shinra:
We're gonna make new memories.
A whole lot of 'em to replace the ones you've lost.

Celty:
Shinra...

Shinra:
What do you say we start planning the wedding?
I'm gonna need your measurements for the wedding dress.
But first you're gonna need to remove those shadowy clothes-

Shingen:
That boy's always been a sicko, enjoyed those dissections a tad too much.

Celty:
He clearly gets that from you!

Shingen:
I told you to call me Father!
Unbelievable... I just made this rule and you have already forgotten it.
It was that kind of negligent behavior, Celty, that allowed me to steal your head...

Celty:
Huh?

Shingen:
Oh! Dang it! Dang it! Dang it Dang it!

Celty:
Wait a second, what did you just say?

Shingen:
What should I do?
I just spilled the beans on the biggest secret of all.
It's okay! Celty's a dingbat!
She'll probably forget it in a second.
Dingy dingy Celty! Silly dingy Celty!

Celty:
That's enough! Shut it already!

Shingen:
It's quite easy to avoid the attacks of a dingy, clumsy girl! All I-

Shinra:
I will not let you taunt Celty even if you are my father.

Shingen:
Alright, alright. I'll tell you everything.
I suppose there's no point in hiding it now.
Yes, the culprit who stole your head and gave it to the pharmaceutical giant is none other than yours truly!

Celty:
Well, don't brag about it!

Shingen:
Whatever, now come with me.
I have something I want to show you.

Celty, Shinra:
Huh?

Celty:
Hm?

Shinra:
Did he... just leave?

Celty:
Ah!
Oh, you are not getting away, you creepy old lech!

Shingen:
She gone?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
My plan to just push the elevator button worked like a charm.
I'll retrieve my luggage later.
Farewell!



Celty:
Damn it... Where'd he go?
Huh?

Mikado:
Oh, hey there, Celty.

Celty:
Everything okay?
You seem a bit out of it.

Mikado:
Well, I was just sorta lost in thought.

Celty:
About what?
You look kinda down.
What is it?

Mikado:
It's about the Slasher.
People are spreading this strange rumor all over the Internet right now.

Celty:
What strange rumor?

Mikado:
Well, they're saying that the Dollars are behind the Slasher attacks.

Celty:
They can't be.
You don't believe that, do you?

Mikado:
No, of course I don't.
But if this rumor spreads, I've got this sinking feeling that something bad's gonna happen.
Especially now when things are starting to get tense between the Dollars and the Yellow Scarves.

Celty:
He's right.
The balance in this city is at a tipping point right now.
Mikado. I'll look into the Slasher incidents myself, okay?

Mikado:
Really, Celty?

Celty:
And you should get going.
If you zone out for too long around this place, someone's only gonna end up mugging you.

Mikado:
Yeah. Good point.
Thanks for everything.



Shizuo:
The Slasher?
Sorry, no clue.

Celty:
I see...

Shizuo:
Listen, why are you doing this?
You shouldn't be busting your ass so hard for the Dollars.

Celty:
Well, I'm not doing this just for the Dollars.
I've got a score to settle with whoever's behind all this.
If I actually had a head, I'd be dead now.

Shizuo:
Dumbass.

Celty:
Hm?

Shizuo:
Anyone who calls you a dumbass is a bigger dumbass.
But since I know I'm a dumbass, I'll say it!
Dumbass!
Why didn't you tell me this?!
I'll kill 'em. Whoever it is, I'll kill 'em dead!
I'll kill 'em deader than dead!

Celty:
Wait, calm down!
I'm the Headless Rider.
Nothing happened to me.

Shizuo:
No, no, no!
That's not the point!
If someone pulls a knife on you, then you have to kill that bastard!
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

Celty:
But, what about your job?
You're just on a break right now.

Shizuo:
Who the hell cares?

Celty:
Listen, it's all right.
I'm not gonna let you get fired because of me.
Besides, if I'm gonna go after the Slasher, I need to get some information first.
So before you do anything rash, let me get all that in order.

Shizuo:
Alright then.
Fine. But do it quick, okay?
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

Celty:
There was a reason I left Shizuo alone for a while.



Izaya:
Well, now.
I'm glad that you decided to come and see me.
So tell me, did you ever find your head?

Celty:
That's not why I'm here.
I'll make this quick.
I wanna know about the Slasher.

Izaya:
I'll only charge you 3 bills for that.

I'm guessing your clothes and wallet are made of that shadowy stuff, too.
So if that's the case, if I were to shine a really bright spotlight on you, would I be able to see you naked?

Celty:
Wanna try it?

Izaya:
No, not really.
See, unlike a certain underground doctor that we both know, I'm no pervert.
I can't get it up for a chick without a head, or even a chick without a body.

Celty:
Say what you want about me.
But insult Shinra again and it won't go well.

Izaya:
So you, too, are in love.
You know, I wonder.
What would happen if another Dullahan were to come along?
Shinra might fall for her in a second.

Celty:
I'd like to think that's not possible.
However if it did happen...

Izaya:
You'd kill Shinra and then yourself?

Celty:
No, I just wouldn't let another headless woman get close to him.
I mean, I really do love him.

Izaya:
Sure didn't see that coming!
You're becoming more and more human every day!
Just be careful, though.
I'd hate for you to realize that all this attention you've put towards becoming more human has created a much bigger gap between your head and your neck.

Celty:
I'll worry about that once I get my head back.
To be honest, I've been thinking I don't really need it anymore.
Alright, enough about this.
Tell me what you know about the Slasher.
Don't take my money and then tell me you don't know anything.

Izaya:
Don't worry, it's all good.
I've got some info that neither the cops, the media, or even the net knows of.
Actually, I've been waiting to share it with you.

Celty:
Why me?

Izaya:
Because there's a preternatural element to the Slasher.
Have you ever heard of a sword called Saika?

Celty:
Saika?

Izaya:
I know that it sounds a little odd, but Saika is a demonic blade that used to exist here in Shinjuku.

Celty:
What do you mean demonic blade?
Like the Muramasa?

Izaya:
Yes. It's a sword imbued with dark magic.



Shinra:
Hey, what's going on?

Celty:
Izaya told me about this demonic blade called "Saika."
According to legend, it has a mind of its own, and uses its power to possess humans.
One of the things that every victim has made mention of was that the Slasher's eyes were red.

Shinra:
So, do you think that "Saika" did this?

Celty:
Yeah.
Every time there's been a Slasher attack, someone with the username "Saika" shows up on the net.

Shinra:
Hm...

Celty:
What bothers me though is that when I was attacked, I didn't sense it approaching at all.
If Saika truly isn't human, then I should've felt a presence or something.

Shinra:
Yes, but Saika is just taking over their minds, therefore the being that approached was mainly human.
That would explain why you didn't sense a supernatural presence at the time.

Celty:
Shinra, you seem to know a lot about Saika.

Shinra:
I-I do? Well, you told me to look into it, so I did!
Alright, hurry up and come to bed!

Celty:
I couldn't help but think Shinra was hiding something.



Namie:
Huh?!

Shingen:
Hello! Welcome back!
When Miss Namie here disappeared after the merger with Nebra, Corp, I decided to do a little investigating.
And in my research, I discovered that she visits you now on a regular basis.
So with a little encouragement from my toy gun, she was kind enough to escort me in.

Namie:
Your toy gun?

Shingen:
Oh, did I not mention that?

Namie:
Why don't we report this bastard to the police?

Shingen:
Really? Wouldn't you be the ones in hot water if that happens?
My testimony may lead the police to search this room, where they'll find the bloody head of a poor young woman!
Who knows? Maybe that will be even bigger news than the Slasher currently is.

Izaya:
So, now I see where Shinra gets his lovely twisted disposition.

Shingen:
Flattery will get you nowhere.
To be honest, I'm in no rush to recover the head just yet.

Izaya:
Huh?

Shingen:
The executives of my company were quite taken aback by Celty's little television debut.
And, now they're far more interested in studying the body at this point than the head.

Namie:
What?

Shingen:
So that's why I told the company that I would investigate the head on my own.
After all, I think the approach you have taken to this unique matter is very interesting.
In your theory, Dullahans are actually a type of Valkyrie.
You're hoping to involve the head in some sort of struggle or conflict so you might be able to rouse it into consciousness.

Izaya:
Well, I'm trying many approaches.
But if all else fails, I may have no choice but to bring that head into a warzone.
Regardless though, I would be happy to work with you on this, if that is indeed why you came here.

Shingen:
Excellent.
I've had my eye on you for quite some time.
Nobody else thought to look at this from a mythological standpoint.
Not even myself. I'm very impressed.

Izaya:
Why, thank you.

Shingen:
Before I go, let me give you one piece of advice.
If you do create some sort of conflict here in Tokyo, and an effort to rouse Celty's head, or her soul, I will make one suggestion.
Instead of pulling Celty into someone else's war, instead, create a conflict around her.
And whoever shows up for the fight, throw them into the fire.

Izaya:
That's my intention.
In fact, things are progressing in that direction faster than I thought.



Takashi:
Anri!
I know it's time for gym class now, but are you okay?

Anri:
I'm fine.

Takashi:
I've been worried.
What were you doing with those students who were attacked the other day?
Don't tell me those girls have been bullying you again.
I'm worried, Anri. Really worried.
Who's to say the Slasher won't come after you again?
You shouldn't be alone.

Masaomi:
Sexually harassing her again?
Now that's just plain naughty, Teach.

Takashi:
I'm simply concerned for Anri's safety, that's all.

Masaomi:
Whoa, so you guys are tight!
That's crazy dangerous!
Don't get too concerned for her, or she just might transfer, like Miss Niekawa did.
Didn't that girl have classes with you last year? Haruna Niekawa?

Takashi:
So then you know Niekawa.

Masaomi:
Oh, just her name.
Well, it's time for us students to be heading home now!

Anri:
Who's Haruna Niekawa?

Masaomi:
Hey, Anri.
I'm betting that Mikado hasn't asked you out yet, has he?

Anri:
What?

Masaomi:
Thought so.
But you know, he's crazy about you, right?

Anri:
I think Mikado is a nice guy and a good friend...

Masaomi:
Look, my best friend seems genuinely in love with you.
So I'm just gonna bow out of the picture for now, okay?
Plus, there's chicks all over the world who deserve a little taste of my love!

Mikado:
Masaomi! Anri!

Masaomi:
Well, speak of the coward and there he is.

Mikado:
Sorry to make you guys wait!

Masaomi:
We almost fossilized as you took so long.

Mikado:
Score square root of 3.

Masaomi:
Square root of what?
You gotta bag on me in terms I know like "minus 20 points."
Later!

Mikado:
See you guys tomorrow!

Anri:
See you tomorrow!

Saki:
Huh?
You finally came.



Shinra:
Celty...

Celty:
Hm?

Shinra:
About Saika...
You should know that my dad had it for a while.
But he sold it to an antiques dealer a few years ago.

Celty:
Shingen had it? Why?

Shinra:
Because... it's said that Saika's able to cut souls...

Celty:
Huh? Did he...

Shinra:
Yes, he's the one responsible.
He used the Saika to steal your head.
That's how he cut the soul that held your head and body together.

Celty:
And you... You've known this all along?

Shinra:
Sort of.
But I only found out he used it to take your head when I did my own research later.
I didn't say anything at first because it seemed like you were trying to move on and forget about your head.
But...

Celty:
Listen.
I need to be alone for a while.

Shinra:
Of course you do.

Celty:
Love just confuses things.
It turns out, that same night, there was a certain girl Saika was looking to love as well.
A girl who was having a hard time finding her place in the world.
Anri Sonohara.



<Preview>

Shuji:
Ikebukuro...
All I was looking for was the source of this junktown's energy; the truth about its greed, uncaged desires.
Next time: Dumb Like a Fox.
