  Anri's father:
Okay Anri, we're gonna go higher!

Izaya:
This is a lie.

Anri's mother:
Oh, look at you, Anri.

Izaya:
This is the truth.

Celty:
He's strong...
No. He's scary...
Actually, he's awesome!

Celty:
Amazing.
I knew he was strong, but I had no idea he was this strong.

Shizuo:
You think something happened?
Why don't you go check it out?
After all, you're not doing anything else right now.

Celty:
They're made from the same stuff my scythe is.
Something like a blade won't cut through them.

Shizuo:
Thanks, perfect.

Alright you then...


Haruna:
No way! That sword can't be Saika!
But then that means... the blade that attacked me that night...
So you... You killed your own parents...?

Anri:
Your blade is one of Saika's children.
But I guess it didn't teach you how to fight.
Please. Talk to the other children. Tell them to stop.
You're the parent of those blades, if you order them to do something, they'll do it.
If you're not going to do this, you'll leave me no choice.
My sword's the original Saika, the parent of your blade.
And if I choose, it can command your blade and-

Haruna:
I don't believe you!
I'm the one who can control Saika!
And I do it through love!
An emotion you know nothing about!

Anri:
I want you to hear this just for a second.
I want you to hear the words that echo inside me.
The words of love from Saika.

Izaya:
That was the lie. This was the truth.

Her father was an antiques dealer.
And when his business began to fail, he took that rage out on his family.
Gradually, she sealed up her heart and withdrew into herself.
And that's when the Slasher appeared.

Anri's mother:
I love you, honey.
I love you so much.

Izaya:
That "Slasher" was her mother.

Woman:
What happened? We carved our love into him.
Why hasn't he changed?

Woman:
Once he's been cut, or opened up to us, our minds will flow into him, into his pain and fear.
It's just a matter of time now.

Woman:
What? Shizuo Heiwajima feels no fear?

Shizuo:
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

Look. You bastards got it all wrong.
You guys think that no one will ever love me 'cause they'll always be scared of me.
That's ridiculous.
You see, the one who's scared is me.
I'm always afraid that I'll lose control. And then screw everything up.
I'm the biggest coward I've ever met.
But hey, who gives a damn?
In the end, that's got nothing to do with me kicking your ass.
And you know what?
There's no way that I'm going down in front of the people who love me.

Haruha:
Tell me. How can you stand that voice?

Anri:
There are several qualities that I lack as a person.
And so, to compensate for that, I leech off people who possess the things I don't, like a parasite.
You see, my heart isn't capable of loving other people.
So I can bear this voice inside me forever, objectively and fairly.

Haruna:
I did it!
I can't believe you thought you could beat me!

Anri:
What's wrong? Why are you scared?
You said cutting someone's a sign of love.

Haruna:
You stood there and let me cut you.
How come?

Anri:
Because I'm about to do something awful to you.
But now, at least we're even.
What I'm about to do, is allow my Saika to control your mind.
I won't apologize.
If I did, it would invalidate everything I've done in my entire life.
I know this may seem a bit devious, but I will have peace in my life, even if I must use you in a horrible way to get it.
You see, I have no other choice.
I truly am a parasite.

Saika's such a lonely creature.
I know from our perspective what she's doing may seem wrong.
But she does genuinely love humans.
So now, it's your turn.
It's time for you to love Saika, too.
Unlike me, you have the ability to love other people.

Shizuo:
Stop!
Come on, stop! Damn it!

Man:
What's going on?

Woman:
This is really creepy.
What are we doing here?

Shizuo:
No one ended up dying, huh?

Well, body...
I was finally able to control you.

Takashi:
Anri! Is that really you?

Anri:
Huh?

Takashi:
That isn't the first time that girl's come after me with a knife.
Last time, I just played it down and had her transferred.
I guess she still hadn't-

Anri, we need to get outta here.
Look, Anri. I've done a whole lot to try and help you out.
Did you forget? Who do you think made it possible for you and Mika to get in the same class?

Anri:
And that debt has already been repaid.

Takashi:
How do you mean?
R-Repaid how?

Anri:
At first, I thought the Black Rider was the Slasher.
And for a while, I thought you might be attacked next.
I wanted to help. So I tried my best to protect you.
I wasn't doing it because I like you.
I was simply doing it because I didn't wanna owe you anything.

Takashi:
What are you talking about?

Anri:
I know the Black Rider was chasing you, but I don't know what for.
What did you do to provoke her?

Celty:
He's the guy from that night?

Takashi:
What are you trying to... Anri, okay.
There's no need to hurt anyone.
What are you trying to do, huh?
Cut me like Haruna did? Put that blade down!

Anri:
No. I couldn't be like Haruna if I tried.
You see, while Haruna liked you, I detest you.


Walker:
She's flat-chested and prepubescent!
Hey, by the way, do you know what Dengeki Bunko's putting out this month?

Erika:
I think there may be another Nogizaka Haruka...

Kyohei:
No more bad behavior in this van, it'll stick out anywhere.

Walker:
Sweet!
Hey, you know what?
I wonder if "Kino's journey" is ever gonna add another chapter to it.

Erika:
Yeah! And call it something like "Shizu's journey"!

Walker:
Even better "Samoedo Kamen Can't be This Cute"!

Kyohei:
Shoulda known better than to let Walker handle replacing the door, man.
Damn it.

Erika:
Saburo, why's your face so red?

Walker:
You got a fever or something?

Saburo:
Shut up!

Mikado:
Anri, are you sure you're okay?

Anri:
Yeah. It really isn't that bad.

Mikado:
When Masaomi told me what happened, I was shocked.
I can't believe you were hurt.
So, where is Masaomi, anyway?

Anri:
He left a little bit ago.
Said he had something to take care of.

Mikado:
Man, what could be so important right now?

Anri:
I'm fine. He didn't need to stay.

Mikado:
So have you talked to the police yet?
From what I heard, there were a whole lot of people who ended up getting hurt and-

Anri:
No, it's okay.

Mikado:
It's not okay!

Anri:
I think the attacks are over now.
I just have that feeling.

Mikado:
And why is that?

Anri:
Oh, I shouldn't laugh.
The truth is, several hours before I got hurt, I had another run-in with the Slasher, too.
It's kinda crazy, but I was saved by all these people.
And some of them were just so super cool.

Mikado:
So... So super cool?
What's going on?

Anri:
There was... this bartender guy with sunglasses...

Mikado:
What? Is she talking about Shizuo?

Anri:
And there was this other really awesome person.
You won't believe it when I tell you.
I met... the Headless Rider!

Mikado:
Wha... uh... that so...
Wait a second!

Anri:
I got to talk to it for a few minutes.
It was so amazing.
You could tell it really cared about people.
It is odd. You probably don't believe me, do you?

Mikado:
No. I mean, if you're saying it's true...
But Celty's a woman!

Anri:
And then when I was attacked the second time, the Headless Rider appeared out of nowhere and saved me again!
I guess that's why I feel like I'll be okay.

Mikado:
Yeah, but the Headless Rider is...

Anri:
Hm?

Mikado:
I can't tell her. Because if I do...
Well, you see, it's just that those people.
The world those guys live in is just so entirely different from ours.
You might wanna keep your distance from them.

Anri:
Tell me, Mikado.
What do you think a truly unusual life would be like?
Something really unique.

Mikado:
Huh?

Anri:
It'd be the kind of life where every single day, nothing new ever happened, nothing changed.
That kind of a life... is truly unusual.

Celty:
I'll have a doctor I know take a look at her.
Don't worry.

Anri:
Celty, I... Listen, I really-

Celty:
Don't apologize.
You did what you thought was best, didn't you?
And if it makes you feel better, I think it was right, too.
I do think knocking my head off took things a bit too far, but I'll take that up with Saika.
I'm not endorsing everything you did.
I just think if we were to fight, you'd win.

If you still have your doubts, then I suggest you stop questioning yourself.
And instead, use that power you have to better this town.

Izaya:
She had obtained a power.
A power that allowed her to control a hundred Saikas, and bend them to her will.
It was no small burden for her to bear.
But at the same time, it was a load she was glad to carry.
She'd always felt somewhat of drift before.
But now, with the fate of others weighing in her hands, she finally felt grounded in reality.

Just then, she heard a voice.
It said, "I may not love you, but I don't hate you."
Perhaps it was just her imagination.
So she called out to the voice, but no one answered.
Which in the end, was fine by her.
Actually, it made her a little happy.

It seemed that finally, her life had gone back to normal.
However, she couldn't tell them the truth.
Not about Saika, or the person pulling the strings.
When she took control of all the Saikas, she observed the memories Haruna Niekawa had with those blades.
That's how she discovered who was behind this.
She didn't know what he was after.
But if that person hurt Mikado or Masaomi, or disturb their peace, she knew she'd have to do something.
Reliving it again was horrible.
But she was determined to remember his name.
Then it came to her...

Namie:
Izaya Orihara is strange.
I can't believe your parents named you that.

Izaya:
It may be a coincidence that I turned out the way that I have.
But the name does fit me perfectly.
Do you believe in coincidence, Namie?

Namie:
Why do you ask?

Izaya:
I think most people attribute these recent events to nothing more than coincidence.
But you see, I sent Nasujima to the girl's house at that hour of the night.
That poor sucker was truly an idiot.
He could have found Anri Sonohara's address just by peeking at his class roster.
You see, once you accept they exist, the hard part is over.
They're suddenly everywhere.
Demonic blades, faeries, there's no end.

Namie:
Hmm?

Izaya:
Actually, the only real coincidence, was when Nasujima ran off with my cash.
He owed some serious debts, so he tried to get the cash by threatening the parents of Haruna Niekawa, the girl who'd been stalking him at school.
The loan sharks he owed money to were the Awakusu.
So they sent him to me so I could dig up a little dirt on the girl's family.

Izaya:
Oh, hi there.

Izaya:
He took the bait, hook, line, and sinker.
I knew Haruna was Saika, or at least a variation.
I had planned to corner him and say something like, "How dare you steal my money!"
Then I was going to threaten him and use Haruna. But...
That's when the real Saika, the original came on to the scene.
So then, what became of Nasujima?

Takashi:
Stop! Give me your money!

Shizuo:
Huh?

Izaya:
My personal preference would have been for Shizu-chan to have died that night.
But whatever.
Everything still worked out the way I wanted them to.

Namie:
What do you mean?

Police officer:
You wanna have resisting arrest?

Erika:
So many cops.
What's up with all that?

Walker:
The media's blowing this thing up huge!

Erika:
Oh yeah. Something happened in South Ikebukuro Park, too.

Saburo:
I heard that was just some kind of turf fight.

Walker:
Oh, so it wasn't the Slasher.

Erika:
What caused all that, anyway?
That old guy seemed totally out of it.

Saburo:
It's odd he couldn't remember a thing.
It's like he'd been hypnotized.

Kyohei:
The cops still think it was just another fight between the color gangs.

Walker:
It's not just the cops.

Erika:
What is...

Saburo:
Really?

Walker:
So this guy...
He's like the leader of the Dollars, isn't he?

Celty:
Calm down, Mikado.

Namie:
So, just what were you after anyway?

Izaya:
This city has been broken down into three factions: the Dollars, the Yellow Scarves, and the army of that demonic blade.
And the first two have been infiltrated by Saika's army bringing spies to both camps.
To be honest, I'd have been fine with Haruna Niekawa, just so long as that army of the damned came with her.
But that Anri Sonohara is more interesting.

Namie:
So?

Izaya:
I'm simply creating sparks right now.
And that's fine 'cause from here, things will begin to smolder and smoke all on their own.
This suspense is killing me!

Namie:
Yes, but... The Yellow Scarves were started by a middle school brat, weren't they?
How tough can they really be?

Izaya:
The fact that a kid like him can put together a posse of that size and strength, means he's a serious threat.
But, then again, the head of the Yellow Scarves is sort of an acquaintance of mine.

Masaomi:
Please... Don't drag me back into this...

Yellow Scarves member:
Those assholes are outta control!

Yellow Scarves member:
Come on, dude!
We can't make a move without your call!

Horada:
Yo, call him the chief!
Show some damn respect!

Yellow Scarves member:
Yeah, okay. I'm sorry.

Masaomi:
It's fine. Let it ride.
Besides, I'm not the boss anymore. I'm just a plebe now.
Actually, I'm just your... Just your average... high schooler...
Yeah. Being a high schooler is all that I wanted.
My life finally had a little peace to it.
People I'm tied with were close to me, and things only got edgy when I wanted them to.
But that's all gone now.
And the people who went after Anri, they're gonna have to pay.
I don't care how many Slashers are out there, but we're gonna crush 'em.
And if it turns out that Dollars are mixed up in any of this, then we'll crush them, too.
Those bastards managed to drag me back, damn it.
Damn it!


Masaomi:
I came back. I really didn't want to, but I did.
I came back for closure on my past, for both me and Saki, and that guy.
Next time: Out of Your Control.
