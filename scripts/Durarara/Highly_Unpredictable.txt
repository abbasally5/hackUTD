  <Opening>

Mikado:
Wow. It's cooler than Kamisakura-Machi-Ginza.

Masaomi:
I mean, I'm no expert or anything, but I wouldn't really consider this place safe.
There's worse things here than gangs, you know. Be careful.

Kanra:
So guess what I saw today?
The black bike.

Kanazawa:
It's been a while since we got one. Teen chicks rock.

Asanuma:
Thank God for that info broker.

Mikado:
And right then, I noticed my whole body was shaking.



Celty:
Is the reality you see the only one? Or could there be others?
Can you tell when everything looks the same as always?

President:
First, I'd like to congratulate everyone and welcome you to our school.
These are challenging times for Japan.
We're seeing the birthrate decline, and our middle classes disappear.
But when I look out at your faces, I know the future of our country is not in any danger.
In fact, I see in every student here a brighter future for us all, and that encourages me.
Today is a special day for you.
And as I stand up here and look out, I realize it's a special day for the faculty, as well.
You are the future. Go forth.

Celty:
Look around and what do you see?
You find yourself thinking, "I've seen this before. Today is just like any other."

Mikado:
Mikado Ryugamine.

Celty:
There's a shy boy who just arrived in Tokyo.

Anri:
Anri Sonohara. It's nice to meet you.

Celty:
A girl, who seems a little odd and out of place.

Masaomi:
I'm Masaomi Kida. I bet you guys think I'm all mature and everything.
But I'm really an innocent little 15-year-old just like the rest of you.
I'm rock.

Celty:
A boy who's having way too much fun.

Rio:
Rio Kamichika. It's nice to meet everyone.

Celty:
And a girl who's just a bit mysterious.
You've probably come across people like this yourself.

Teacher:
Ah, Harima. Is Mika Harima here today?
Okay, absent...

Celty:
These are all things you've experienced before.

Teacher:
Oh, I see we have our first tardy.
We were just doing introductions. Enlighten us with your name.

Seiji:
Seiji Yagiri. It's nice to meet all of you.

Celty:
Sometimes though, when you least expect it, you'll get a tiny glimpse of another reality seeping into yours.

Teacher:
Thank you, Seiji. Please take your seat and we'll move on.

Seiji:
No, sir.

Listen.
I just wanna say I won't be at school for a while.
Well, actually I'll never be back.
I just came to let you know. Good bye, sir.

Teacher:
Hold on a second, Seiji. You can't mean it.

Seiji:
I'm not joking, sir. I have my reasons. This is something very important to me.
I gotta go. I can't waste any more time with you people. Good bye, sir.

Teacher:
Seiji, wait. Please just hold on a second.

Celty:
A crack appears in your peaceful life.
It throws you off guard, makes you rethink things.
There's a girl sitting in this classroom who caught a glimpse of just such a thing.
She experienced it two days ago when she should have died.



Celty:
She was born in a normal home. The kind you can find anywhere.
It was a typical life, with no real bumps or bruises.
It arrived in a mailbox around the time she started junior high.
It came without warning or provocation.

Nakura:
What was in the envelope?

Rio:
Photos.
I think my dad's having an affair.
The pictures showed him with another woman.
And there was a letter that said "Are you going to let him get away with this?"
I think they were sent by someone who knew the woman in the photos.

Nakura:
Your dad's a jerk.
But the guy sending the photos is even worse.

Rio:
I was so shocked. I didn't know what to do.
I figured the best thing would be just to hide them. So I did.
But ever since then, all the normal stuff we do as a family started to feel kinda fake and weird to me.

Nakura:
Must have been hard...

Rio's dad:
Are you okay over there, Rio?

Rio:
I could only take it for 6 months.
I thought it would be better for everyone if my mom found out.

Nakura:
If it's too hard to talk about, you don't have to.
I've got a lot of things I don't like talking about.

Rio:
No, no, no. I wanna tell you.

Mazenda's dad:
How could you mistake a cell phone for a remote control?
You know what I'm saying?

Rio:
Nothing really changed, though.
I don't know if Mom was just ignoring the whole thing, or somehow or another, it worked it out when I wasn't around.

Mazenda's dad:
Hasn't that ever happened to you?

Rio:
Everything stayed the same.
My dad kept telling the same dumb jokes.
And Mom kept making our stew too sweet.
So, I figured maybe it would be better if I just disappeared.
I guess that's all I've been thinking about lately.

Nakura:
That's a lot like how I feel, Miss Mazenda.
My problems aren't as bad as yours.
But still...

Rio:
Tell me what happened.

Nakura:
I was dating this girl and, well, she hooked up with my dad.

Rio:
That's awful.

Nakura:
Yeah, but my mom was the one I was angry with.

Rio:
What did she say?

Nakura:
She said stuff like that happens.
And it was more important that the neighbors didn't find out.
She didn't say anything about how she felt.
So I thought maybe she thinks the family's reputation is more important than me.
Or, I don't know, maybe she was thinking about my future and stuff.

Rio:
I doubt it.

Nakura:
Maybe you're right.

Rio:
I am. She doesn't care about you or how you feel about what's going on.
The only thing she cares about is...

Rio's mom:
Honey, dinner's ready.

Rio:
Yes, Mom.

Nakura:
Miss Mazenda, would you like to disappear with me?
Maybe if we die together, they'll understand how we feel about the way they're treating us.
Maybe then they'll realize what they should have cared about.

Celty:
It seems stupid to her now.
But when she left home that day, she was ready to go through with it.
Nakura's words gave her the confidence she needed.
Knowing that he shared her pain, she felt compelled to see him.
At this point, even if he was lying, she had nothing to lose.
Or so she thought.

Rio:
Yes?

Morita:
Miss Mazenda?

Rio:
Yes, I am. Are you Mr. Nakura?

Morita:
Wonderful.

Celty:
The second she saw his face, she began to wonder if that really was Nakura.
But she wasn't about to turn back now.
So she ignored her suspicions, and went with him anyway.



Celty:
And even while this was happening...

Kanazawa:
Hello.

Rio:
Hello.

Kanazawa:
We good to go?

Morita:
The coast couldn't be clearer.

Kanazawa:
Sorry to trick you like this, doll face.

Celty:
Shock, defiance, and regret.
A mix of emotions overwhelmed her.
But just before she passed out, she thought to herself, "This is my fate."
She didn't care what happened to her any more. This was the end.
She would disappear without anyone knowing what truly happened to her.
As if she was never here to begin with.
However...

Izaya:
The coast isn't exactly clear.



Celty:
As she lay there unconscious, the world outside kept moving.

Shinra:
Well, it doesn't sound like it's going to be a tough job.
But be careful, okay?

Celty:
Without any concern for the fate that awaited her.



Middle-aged man:
I can't do it.
There's no way I can get that kind of cash together.
I swear to God I'm gonna pay you.
But, if anything happens to me, Shiki from the Awakusu isn't gonna be too happy about...

Shizuo:
Gramps.
I don't have time for this.
And it's not 'cause I'm busy, but I'll be damned if I'm gonna spend more than a couple of minutes on a douchebag like you!

Masaomi:
Really avoid pissing off.

Izaya:
Hey, I don't think I need to remind a talented transporter such as yourself how to do their job.
Just do what you're told and nothing more.
Throw a scare into them. Kick 'em around a bit and that's all.
Okay? Have fun.

Celty:
The world kept moving, changing direction, heading away from the fate the girl thought was hers.

Asanuma:
Yo.
What the hell are you?!



Celty:
She looked, and on the screen, it read "I've been asked to take you to a certain place."
The bike moved silently. But once in a while, it brayed like a horse.
It all seemed so unreal to her.
But the rider she was clinging to felt quite real as they moved through the night.
The girl began to think about the person emitting this warmth.
What were they thinking? What did they know? How did they live?
When this person looked at her, what did they see?

Rio:
I understand.

Izaya:
Miss Mazenda?
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Nakura.

Rio:
How do I know that for sure?

Izaya:
Because I'm the Nakura who wants to disappear with you.

Rio:
It is you? So then, I guess you're the one who saved me back there?

Izaya:
Right. That's me.

Rio:
I don't know how to thank you.

Izaya:
Were you really scared?

Rio:
Yes.

Izaya:
That must have been rough.

Rio:
It was.
How did you find out about the kidnapping, though?

Izaya:
Easy. I'm the one who had those three losers kidnap you. Clever, huh?
Oh, and that rescue was arranged by yours truly as well.

Rio:
You arranged it?

Izaya:
Let's recap the last few moments of your life, shall we?
You were scared when you were kidnapped despite the fact that you wanted to die in the first place and that made you mad.
Now, if you fought back against your kidnappers, you'd be denying the part of you that wanted to die.
So you decided to give up, and accepted your fate.
But now that you're safe and sound, you're thrilled you didn't die.
I wanted to see the look on your face when I told you that.
I wanted to see what you'd look like when you came face to face with someone who could see right through your pathetic intentions.

Rio:
Why would you...

Izaya:
Why would I?
Let's see, it might sound philosophical, but you look like a smart girl, so I think you'll be able to understand.
Anyway, I'll try to explain it to you.
Simply put, I love humans. Think about it, human beings are the most interesting creatures you could ever hope to find.
Oh, and when I said I love humans, I meant all humans, not you specifically.
Important detail.

Rio:
So then, you lied?

Izaya:
You're getting the picture. How wonderful. Come here.

Many people have jumped to their deaths from the very spot you're standing on.
It's not really famous for it or anything.
But it's high enough that if you jump, the fall will kill you.
Look. See that stain down there?
Tell me something. You think you are special? You are not. Everyone's the same.
Everyone lies, everyone hides things. No one makes it through this life, being completely honest.
I bet you've got a couple of juicy secrets you wouldn't tell your best friend.
So explain this: How come it's okay for you to have secrets but not your parents?

Rio:
Well I...

Izaya:
You wanna know what my thoughts are on this?
I think if you're having an affair or if your spouse knows, at times you still laugh at the same dumb jokes.
You keep eating the same sweet stew, you just keep going.
You see? Whatever problems they had, they're just a big old stain on the pavement now.
Everyone's the same, no exceptions. All of them equal before God.
Want me to let go?
You get it now?
Well, I gotta bounce. Thanks a lot for proving just how ugly and immature you are. It's been real.
And just so you know, I don't really care about your problems.
I just wanted to see how you handled yourself. You didn't let me down, though.
You're just as boring as I imagined you'd be.
I knew you never really wanted to kill yourself.
Thanks again. I had an excellent time, Miss Mazenda.

Celty:
She hesitated for a moment. She thought maybe she could get back at him, by actually jumping.
But then she began to wonder if this was the exact opportunity she had been waiting for.
Maybe the horrible things he said were what she needed to hear.
But then, something unexpected happened.

Rio:
Wait. Tell me why.

Izaya:
And again, she goes above and beyond.

Celty:
The girl thought about her mother and father. About her father's lover, and then again about her parents.
They all had secrets she'd never know about.
And was that so terrible? Maybe they weren't as selfish or evil or crapped as she'd originally thought.
Maybe their behavior wasn't a sign of weakness or some kind of compromise.
As she looked for the way home, she thought about forgiving them and keeping it a secret.
Ever since then, the world has looked different.
Everyone she saw had their own lives to live, with their own little secrets.
And she realized that was normal.



Masaomi:
Where you wanna go?
I'll take you wherever. Just buy me food.

Mikado:
Okay. How about a bookstore?

Masaomi:
Mm... Yeah, there's like a ton of bookstores around here.
Looking for anything special?

Celty:
Even these two, as normal as they seem, probably have secrets of their own, feelings they can never tell anyone.

Mikado:
No, nothing special.
Just thought I'd look for some manga, I didn't happen to bring anything like that with me.

Anri:
Please wait.
Seiji. You sure you don't know anything?

Seiji:
Leave me alone.

Anri:
But listen. She even missed the first day of school.

Seiji:
I said I don't know anything!

Anri:
Wait. Hold on.

Masaomi:
Hello. Hey, you good down there?

Mikado:
Wonder what that's about.

Masaomi:
She totally wants me.
That chick with the glasses has a crush on me.
But she's afraid of all the danger and risk a guy like me brings to the table.
Oh, yeah. I'm rock.

Mikado:
Can you speak a language that I know too?

Celty:
For that boy, and for this girl, the world they see right now is not necessarily reality.
And she found herself thinking how wonderful it would be, if she could tell someone what she'd learned.
That "no matter what happens, the world really isn't as bad as you think."

Izaya:
So, nobody told me you switched professions and became a defender of the innocent.
I didn't expect that, see, I thought I hired you for your skills as a carrier.
No way, I'm just Izaya Orihara, the info broker, not some evil villain.
But if someone wants to go out like that, who am I to tell 'em they can't, you know.
It was a lot of fun, my talented carrier.



<Preview>

Simon:
Ikebukuro. He and she and I and you...
We come to this town looking, searching, and trying to change something.
Next time: Rampant Evil.
Want sushi? It's good. Long time no see.
