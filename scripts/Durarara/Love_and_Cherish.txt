  <Opening>

Seiji:
I have my reasons. This is something very important to me.

Celty:
I'm forgetting my own face! Do you know what that feels like?

Mikado:
Hey, miss?

Masaomi:
Hey!

Kyohei:
Yagiri Pharma, huh?

Walker:
You guys really think that's true? They experiment on humans in there?

Mikado:
That's not Mika Harima...

Namie:
Of course to you, you can take all the money you want.
It's no problem.

Seiji:
We are the future. I do love you, Celty.



Namie:
Everyone is fake.
The world's filled with these people.
They say they love and adore you, but all they really want to do is possess you.
They want you to need them and be there for them.
Always taking, never giving anything in return.
My love is different.
It's greater, and more perfect.

Seiji:
Yeah. Yeah, I know, Sis.
Okay, thanks for the cash. I'll see ya.
Are you thirsty? Want me to get you a drink?
Look, there's a vending machine right over there.
I'll be right back.

Hey, what're you... You're so cute.

Namie:
Your men still haven't found them?

Yoshida:
No. Sorry, we're trying our best.

Namie:
So what happened to the guy that you had tailing them?

Yoshida:
I just had a conversation with him.
They were in the same hotel for the past few days.
But Seiji got by him last night and ended up changing hotels.

Namie:
Oh, he was still answering his cell last night around 7.
If anything happens to him...

Yoshida:
I think we're going to be okay.
He promised us that he wouldn't leave Ikebukuro.
We will find him, don't worry.

Namie:
Listen!
If the police come across that thing before we do, that won't work out well for us!

Yoshida:
Well, I just...

Namie:
This is absurd.
I can't wait for you people to get it right.

Yoshida:
But chief!

Namie:
Don't worry, I will be right back.

It was just a doll to me, nothing more.
A beautiful, expensive doll like my uncle used to bring me from the foreign countries he visited.
But I've never liked dolls, even as a child.
I was never sure why he gave me the dolls he did.
I sometimes wonder if he bought the ones he liked and sent them on to me with no thought for what I would like.

Hey Seiji, look! Pretty, huh?
Oh, what's this?

That house was so big and empty.
And so often Seiji and I were the only ones there.
My parents frequently sent me to my uncle's place, even before my brother was born.
I loved having free rein of his study.
And that's where I found it...
I've been told that it was smuggled in from some foreign country.
My uncle seemed possessed by it. Sometimes he would even speak to it.
It was indeed beautiful. Far more than any doll my uncle had given me.
Oddly enough, there was no sense of brutality to it, as if the head was complete just as it was.
But it was never anything more to me.
That's why I didn't think twice about allowing Seiji into the study that day.
It was harmless, just part of our usual play.
Or maybe, I just wanted to share the secret.

See? Pretty, isn't it?

And that's how it all began.
A thoughtless action, which became the single biggest regret of my whole life...



Izaya:
This is the first time we've met, correct?
I hope that list of illegal aliens was useful, Ms. Namie Yagiri.
I'm glad to see you. You're the chief of Yagiri Pharmaceuticals' lab 6.
It's an honor to have you come and visit my humble abode.
So please, have a seat, Ms. Yagiri.

Namie:
I need you to find my brother. It's urgent.

Izaya:
Huh?

Namie:
I'm willing to pay you however much you ask.
I haven't heard a word from him since last night.
But he should still be in Ikebukuro.

Izaya:
He really hasn't been out of contact all that long.
What has you so worried about him?

Namie:
It's the girl that he's with.
She has a distinctive scar around her neck.

Izaya:
A girl? He is a boy with needs.

Namie:
Get started at once!

Izaya:
Whoa whoa, wait a sec!
Don't you think that there're far more important things that we should be looking into first?
Rumor has it, the foreign entity, Nebra, has been making serious advances towards acquiring your company.
Now, that would make your current position-

Namie:
Mr. Izaya Orihara! I don't have time to chitchat right now.

Izaya:
Hm... Surprising.
A woman like you falling for her brother. Who would have thought?

Namie:
You don't know a single thing about me.

Izaya:
I know the name Namie Yagiri, and know she's achieved.
Your uncle took some big risks that didn't turn out so well, lost the family business.
And now the current president of Yagiri Pharmaceuticals is a very button-down, practical man.
But you came into the company on the bottom floor and like the smart girl you were, worked your way up the ladder.
You've got brains and beauty.

Namie:
I guess you do know me fairly well.
A guy like you should have no problem finding my brother.

Izaya:
Right, the brother...
Maybe this is one affair you shouldn't meddle in.

Namie:
What I'm doing is not meddling!
The only one capable of protecting him is me!

Izaya:
It's always so hard to see the obvious when you're stalking someone.
The stalker thinks they're protecting their victi-

Namie:
Don't you ever compare me to a stalker again!

Izaya:
Scary! I was only kidding.
Okay, I'll help. But in a way I see fit.
We informants work differently than cops.

Namie:
Just what kinda game is that?

Izaya:
Question: the girl you mentioned with the scar on her neck, are you jealous of her?

Namie:
Why do you ask?

Izaya:
Mm-hm.

Namie:
I can't possibly be jealous of her!
My heart burns with jealousy, but only because...

Seiji:
Sister... There's a girl that I really like.

Namie:
I could see that Seiji was going odder and odder by the day.
He kept trying to sneak into my uncle's study.
And once he was in, he would stare at it for hours.
What he loved was not a person. It had no heart, not even a body.
I felt I had to get it away from him.
So, as soon as I joined the company, I asked my uncle to relocate it there for research purposes.
And then it happened.
Nebra had begun talks with our board and I was trying to protect our classified research from leaks.
But then a security card was stolen.
It was a card that only I had access to.

Seiji:
Sis, I think that I might have killed someone...
What should I do?

Namie:
Upon hearing those words, the feeling in my chest was neither fear nor anger.
Instead, it was pure happiness. Seiji needed help. And he called me.

Just try to relax, you don't need to worry about a thing.
Your big sis will handle it all, okay?

Seiji:
I've got a question. But not about that girl...

Namie:
So, I'm guessing that you were the one who took it then.
It'll all work out. Just give her back to me and I'll fix everything.
It's gonna be fine. I promise.

I had no idea at the time that Seiji was being hounded by some stupid little girl named Mika Harima.
Or that she was stalking him.
She had snuck into his room, and that's when she saw it.
I'll go to whatever lengths I have to, to protect you.

Izaya:
Ah, here we go.
Seems finding him won't be a problem at all.
The cops have him in their possession as we speak. I'm sure they'll be calling you soon.
Don't worry about the police part. I'm sure that it's probably nothing. Probably...

Namie:
I've had enough from you!
Hello? Yes, speaking.



Seiji:
Hey, what's wrong?
What? We're leaving? But, we haven't... Hey, wait!
It makes me so happy that you love me as much as you do.
And I will always love you. I mean it. Forever.

Girl with a scar on her neck:
I'm scared.

Seiji:
Scared of what?

Girl with a scar on her neck:
Let's leave this place! Let's go far away!

Seiji:
Listen, I wanna go wherever you wanna go, but tell me where that is!

Shizuo:
Hm? What the hell?
A lover's spat?

Girl with a scar on her neck:
No! Stop! Go away!

Shizuo:
All right, stop the hysterics.
Relax, we're not here to hurt you, calm down.
Did you hear what I just said?
Huh?

Seiji:
You let go of her right now!

Shizuo:
Go on, don't worry about me.
This doesn't hurt. Go.
I don't know what this is all about, but you do what you gotta do.
Humph, I've always wanted to say this.
Go on ahead and leave this one to me! Got it?

Seiji:
Wait!

Mikado:
I'm so sorry. Are you all right?
You're that...

Seiji:
Get your hands off her now!

Shizuo:
Easy, pal! You're not going anywhere!

Seiji:
Let me go! Let me go!

Shizuo:
Tell me. Is that your girlfriend?

Seiji:
She is! Fate brought us together!

Shizuo:
So then, why is she acting like that?

Seiji:
Beats me!

Shizuo:
What the hell kind of answer is that?!

So you say that you love her, but you don't know anything about her.
Guess you're a pretty lame boyfriend then, aren't ya?

Seiji:
All that I need to know about her is that I love her! That's all!

Shizuo:
Okay, then, educate me.
How did fate bring you both together?

Seiji:
It's because I love her! It's just as simple as that!
Love is a feeling, you can't explain it! It has no words!
Now, let me go.

Akie, Haruko:
Wow! The Black Rider!

Seiji:
My actions will prove my love!
Just watch! I'll prove it!

Shizuo:
I like you a lot better than Izaya.
So I'm only gonna send you home with this!
This will just bleed if I take it out. Better stop and get a band-aid.
Or, maybe some super glue would do the trick.



Shinra:
So what you're saying is your head walked by, attached to another body.
You grabbed her, but some high school kid intercepted.
You chased her, but then some other high school kid entered the scene.
And that's when the two of them escaped with your head.
And that's what you expect me to believe.

Celty:
Believe it if you want. It's your choice.

Shinra:
No, I believe it.
But, what was Shizuo doing there?

Celty:
Oh, I forgot that part.
Izaya had asked me to be in the park, on standby, for a job.
Shizuo passed by, so we just started to talk.
But, then I got a text a few minutes later that he didn't need me and I was just getting ready to come back here.

Shinra:
Hm... Izaya called you, huh?

Celty:
Regardless, I wanted to talk to you.

Shinra:
You're still shaking up, aren't you?
You can talk to me as much as you like.

Celty:
Why is some other body walking around with my head on its shoulders?!

Shinra:
Relax, I'm not going to have a clear-cut answer for this.
But If I had to take a guess, I would probably say... hm... something like...
Your head was looking for another host that would be appropriate.
And when it found one it liked, it attached to it.

Celty:
That's horrible!

Shinra:
Maybe your head stumbled across a fresh corpse!

Celty:
Okay, enough!
I don't know... Maybe what you're suggesting is possible.

Namie:
What I did wasn't wrong. It was done for all the right reasons.
The experiment we performed, that was all done for Seiji's sake.

Seiji:
I have to go.

Namie:
It's fine.
Everything's all right now.

Seiji:
I have to go.

Namie:
Must have been so scared.

Seiji:
I have to go.

Namie:
But as you can see, nothing happened to you.

Even after she escaped from here and found Seiji again, my love for him never wavered. Not once.
It is only because of my love for Seiji that he has any love for that girl.
Seiji knows this to be true and so do I.
Everything may have gotten a bit twisted, but it will still work out.

Seiji:
Damn it!
He was wearing a Raira uniform... So then, who is he?

Namie:
Just leave it to me. I'll find him.

Celty:
What I have to do now is find that kid from Raira.
Then I need to be able to talk to my head.

Shinra:
Do you mean the head that shrieked when it first saw you?
How do you intend to get your head back, anyway? It's attached to another body.
What's your plan? Do you think she'll just snap off her head and give it to you?
Celty...

Celty:
I just don't wanna accept that my head and my memories are gone for good.
That means everything I've done for the past 20 years has been a complete waste of time.

Shinra:
It wasn't a waste of time.

Namie:
All right, I'm going to go get her now and bring her back for you.
You just stay here until I return.
By the way, your cell phone, where is it?

Seiji:
I don't know.
I remember putting it in my bag, but it's gone now.

Namie:
Huh?

Seiji:
She needs me! I have to find her!
We are meant to be together!

Namie:
Ah, I hear you.
Don't worry now. You just leave everything to me.
That girl's got nerve.

A doll should behave like a doll and stay put.
The last thing it should do is interfere with my love for Seiji.
I've made up my mind. I don't want any more regrets. I'm through with that.

Okay, listen.
I want you to round up every person we have for this.
I want her dead or alive. If you have any trouble bringing her back, then dispose of her.

Izaya:
I see. Everyone is busy.
This'll be fun! This'll be fun! This'll be fun!
There's just so much going on in this town that even I don't know anything about!
It's an endless sea of entertainment! This is why I love this bustling hotbed of humans.
I love them! I love them all! I love them all so much! And that is why...
My lovely little humans should love and adore me, too.

Girl with a scar on her neck:
Thanks a lot.

Mikado:
Are you okay now?
Can you answer my questions?

Girl with a scar on her neck:
Mm...

Mikado:
You said you don't remember anything.
So then, do you think maybe you have amnesia?
Well, I'm gonna suggest it again... I think we should go to the police or to a hospital.

Girl with a scar on her neck:
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

MIkado:
It's okay, no big deal. Don't apologize.

Girl with a scar on her neck:
I have to go. Before that woman gets in my way.

Namie:
Forever, and ever...

Girl with a scar on her neck:
I have to go.

Namie:
Seiji...

Girl with a scar on her neck:
Seiji...

Namie, Girl with a scar on her neck:
I love you.



<Preview>

Mikado:
So, the Headless Rider, Izaya Orihara, and that girl with the scar, they all showed up again.
And then that guy in the other class is in the Dollars.
Next time: Never Before Seen.
I really wanted an unusual life, but...
