  <Opening>

Izaya:
By the way, Mr. Niekawa, how's that daughter of yours doing?

Takashi:
So then you know Niekawa.

Masaomi:
Oh, just her name.

Anri:
Who's Haruna Niekawa?

Celty:
That's ridiculous.
Shizuo's way stronger than I am.

Taro Tanaka:
This is the person that's been trolling our forum for like the past 6 months, right?

Kyohei:
Run!

Shuji:
I love you so, so, so, so, so, so much, Shizuo.



Shizuo:
Kyohei, I'm borrowing your door.

Saburo:
So, who do I get to buy me a new door?

Celty:
When I got back, I told Shinra what had happened.
That it was all over now.

Shinra:
But it wasn't over.
In fact, it was just beginning.

Celty:
It was a very long night.
The guy who attacked us was still out cold, so I left him with Kyohei and the others while I took the girl home.
This is the girl who hangs out with Mikado.
Before we left, she asked to see if I really didn't have a head.

Shinra:
So you showed her?

Celty:
Yes. And like Mikado, she wasn't surprised.
Maybe that's just how kids are these days.

Shinra:
Doubt it.
I don't think being a kid has anything to do with it.

Anri:
Is that Celty?

Um... Excuse me, but who are you?

Haruna:
Good evening, Anri.
My name's Haruna Niekawa.

Celty:
So that's it. That's all that happened.
Thanks for looking into Saika, but I think it's over now.

Shinra:
Yeah, maybe.
But you know, it seems a little too anticlimactic for me, too easy.

Kyohei:
So, what are we supposed to do with this guy?

Walker:
Well, we should call an ambulance, I guess.

Shizuo:
You know what?
Something just doesn't feel right to me.
Why is that?
I'm off to Shinjuku to kill Izaya. I'll be back.

Erika:
Oh, man! This is so cool!
Shizu-chan totally has the hots for Izaya!
Boy-on-boy love is so much fun, I love it!

Saburo, Kyohei, Walker:
Not happening!

Erika:
Huh?

Shinra:
You know, she might be-

Celty:
No!
Just the thought of those two together is wrong.
Anyway, here it is.
Just don't touch it. It might possess you.

Shinra:
This is Saika? A butcher knife?

Celty:
It surprised me, too.
But the guy holding it had the glowing red eyes and a high-pitched voice, he sounded like a woman.
And he kept spouting crazy nonsense about love or something.

Shinra:
Well now. Love, huh?

Celty:
I feel like I've seen that guy somewhere before...
Regardless, how does love have anything to do with slashing?
Is Saika some kind of sadist?

Shinra:
No, I don't think sadist is the word you're looking for.
See, Saika's desire is ultimately to love people.
That blade has been infatuated with the human race for so long that it's stopped seeing people as individuals.
And now it's obsessed with humanity. All of humanity.

Celty:
I don't understand.
If it loves people, why slash them?

Haruna:
So, Anri.
I decided to come here and pay you a visit tonight.
Know why?

Anri:
Is it because of that teacher, Mr. Nasujima?
I don't know what you've heard, but I've had nothing to do with him.
Those are just rumors people are spreading.

Haruna:
Oh, I know that.
But you see, I love Takashi.

Shinra:
When people are in love, they have various ways in which they try to express that emotion, right?

Celty:
What do you mean?

Shinra:
Like holding hands, or embracing, or even talking.

Anri:
So, the two of you were dating then?

Haruna:
It was more than just simple dating.
The two of us were in love.
And knowing that was all the happiness both of us ever needed.
Yes. We were gonna be together forever...
But then, one day, he rejected me.
I don't know why. I just wanted to show him I really love him!

Anri:
So then... What did you do to prove it to him?

Shinra:
At some point, Saika began wanting to express its love through actions.
But Saika's just a sword. It has no body.

Celty:
So it uses the body of whoever's possessing it.

Shinra:
And then it starts slashing people, over and over again, trying to illustrate what it feels.

Celty:
It wants its love to have tangible form.

Haruna:
Takashi spurned my love.
That's fine. Really.
I don't hate him for that.
You see, there's no way I could ever hate him because I truly love him.

Anri:
Okay, well then...

Haruna:
Even if he never comes back to me, if he chooses someone else, that's fine. I'll forgive him.
However...
If someone takes Takashi's love, I won't forgive them.
Not ever...

Shinra:
About 5 years ago, Saika seemed to have disappeared.
But from what I've seen in that chat room, I'd say that blade is still very much alive, and in love.

Celty:
Wait. Shinra, I remember now.
I knew I'd met that guy with the knife somewhere before.
He's a reporter. His name is...

Haruna:
I've learned that you can't always rely on humans.
It just goes to show if you wanna prove your love, then you should go and do it yourself.
I must say, I thought for sure my father would do a better job than the others did.
But clearly I was wrong.
So I'll do the job myself.
I will take care of things on my own.
With you, my nemesis...

Anri:
So, that man... He was your father?

Celty:
That was Shuji Niekawa.
He's the guy who was attacked right in front of his house.

Shinra:
Why would it do that?
What the- What?!

Celty:
What are you doing?!
So, do you feel anything?
Does it seem like something's trying to possess you?

Shinra:
No, not at all. This isn't Saika.
Here. See for yourself.

There's no way that a legendary blade whose history goes back for decades would say made in 2009.

Celty:
How can that be?
Listen, I know what I saw, believe me!

Shinra:
I believe you. I promise, I would never doubt you.
Maybe this Niekawa guy stumbled upon the Saika legend, and tried to copy it.
What do you think?

Celty:
I think the bigger issue is if this isn't Saika...

Shinra:
Then Saika's still out there somewhere.
Which means, chances are, it's still possessing someone and attacking people.

Celty:
How about the chat room?
Has it been there lately!

Anri:
But I told you, I don't care about Nasujima, I promise.

Haruna:
That's quite alright.
I don't care how you feel about him.
That's not why I'm here.
I'm here because I'm doing what I have to do in order to prove my love.
I don't love you, but what I have in my hand, she will.
In fact, I think Saika will love you to pieces.

Celty:
I can't believe it... Saika's spreading!

Shinra:
If you look at this logically, there's only one possible conclusion.
Celty, imagine this: When two people decide they love each other, what do they frequently do next?

Celty:
Do next? I don't have any idea.
Isn't being in love with someone enough?

Shinra:
Not for most humans.
Once they know they're in love, the next thing they do is take it a step further.
They produce a product of their love.

Celty:
Are you saying...

Shinra:
I am.
I think Saika is giving birth.
Somehow by slashing people, it's impregnating them.
Wait, before you go, I think you should take this chat log along with you.
You're trying to find Shizuo, right?



Shizuo:
What up, Izaya buddy?
Why don't you come on out and play?
Hm?!

Izaya:
Tell me, to what do I owe this pleasure, Shizu-chan?

Shizuo:
I'm obviously here to kick your smarmy little ass.

Izaya:
And why do I deserve to have my ass kicked?

Shizuo:
Because I'm pissed off.

Izaya:
Now don't you think that you're just a little too old to act the part of the playground bully?
Shizu-chan?

Shizuo:
Shut the hell up!
So, how involved in this are you?

Izaya:
I don't know what you're talking about.

Shizuo:
You're in with the Slasher, but I wanna know how deep.

Izaya:
That's a horrible accusation.

Shizuo:
99% of the time, whenever random violent crap happens, it seems you are somehow involved.

Izaya:
And you can't have a little faith in that last 1%?
Guess that's a no.



Haruna:
By the way, I did some research on you.
Your life is pretty pathetic.
It seems around junior high, you began to latch onto some girl by the name of Mika Harima.
Trying to seduce every guy you could...
Oh yeah, I also...

Anri:
What can I do?
How can I get out of here?

Haruna:
...a robber broke into your house and killed both your parents.
You were in the same room, but supposedly...

Anri:
Simple.
I should just act like I always do, like this has nothing to do with me.

Haruna:
Why were you the only one who survived?
Wait! I know! You seduced the perpetrator, didn't you?
You were already a whore then.
Was the thief into little girls?

Anri:
Yeah, that's right.

Haruna:
You are nothing but a disgusting leech.
What an easy time you have, sucking the life out of others.

Anri:
It's not easy.

Haruna:
Huh? Come again?

Anri:
It's not easy living like this, always needing someone else.
I think that you're right.
"Leech" is a pretty good way to describe it.
However, you have no idea what I've put myself through, just so I can stay latched onto someone.
Do you understand?

Haruna:
Do you really expect me to believe?
You had to do bad things for Takashi to like you?

Anri:
No.

Haruna:
Huh?

Anri:
Not for Mr. Nasujima.
He's not worth the effort!

Haruna:
Oh, that's how you feel...
Fine. Now die!
Is that a friend?
Perfect. I'll tie up your little friend and kill them in front of you.
And when I'm finished, I'll kill you.



Izaya:
Seriously?

Well now...

Shizuo:
Celty? Why are you here?
What the hell is this?
Is this part of your plan, too?

Izaya:
Look, if I knew this was all it'd take to get Celty to show up on my doorstep, then trust me, I would have dropped a meteor on your house a long time ago.

Unbelievable...
One moment, he's dumb as an ox, and the next, he's sharp as a whip.
And it's because of this very reason that I hate him so much.



Takashi:
Haruna!

Haruna:
Takashi!
Takashi! My love! My love! My love! My love! My love!

I'm afraid I don't have time to deal with you anymore.
I'll have everyone else kill you instead.

Anri:
Everyone?

Haruna:
I hope they don't spend too much time with you, though.
There's still someone else far more important left.



Man:
I love you, Shizuo...

Woman:
Shizuo...

Celty:
So Shinra, how many Saikas do you think are gonna show up at South Ikebukuro Park?

Shinra:
I don't know.
But listen, Celty, one of them has to be the original Saika.
Just find that one.

Celty:
I'll try. That's the mother, right?

Yoko:
I've been looking for you, Shizuo Heiwajima.
You really are wonderful, just like mother says.
Everyone here knows that you were the one who defeated our sisters.
Gotta love the Internet.

Celty:
It sounds like the mother isn't here, but why?

Yoko:
At first, it was difficult for our collective conscious to adjust and learn your human language.
But now, our minds are just as well-formed as our mother's.
Now come on, Shizuo.
Please show everyone here just how strong you are!
We're so looking forward to loving you!
And neither that monster or the cops has any chance of stopping us!
They're gonna be way too busy for that!
You see, this night is just getting started.
Because not too far from here, my sisters are out and making more sisters!
Now, how much fun is that?

Shizuo:
Can I ask you something?

Yoko:
Whatever you'd like.

Shizuo:
Why me?
Why do you like me so much?

Yoko:
'Cause you're so strong.
Your strength literally has no boundaries. And we would like it for ourselves.
All the better to love humanity with.
We like someone with good genes the same way that you humans do.
Come on, now. Let's just be honest here.
Odds are, a guy like you will never find someone to love him, except us.
We want to love you, every single one of us.

Celty:
Shizuo, snap out of it!
If things get out of control, I'll take care of it, okay?

Shizuo:
No, Celty. That laugh was real.
I'm kinda glad about this.

Celty:
Huh?

Shizuo:
You don't have any idea how much I've hated having this power.
I've always been afraid because of this.
Nobody would ever want me.
But I was wrong.
Alright, then. How many we got?
Let's just call it a lot.
So now, this should do it.
You know, I think I can fully embrace who I am now.
Finally start liking myself.
I've hated this power so much I've wanted nothing more than to be rid of it.
Now, I can finally go all out.
Hey, by the way, I just wanna make one thing clear.
None of you are my type.
Never have been, and never will be.
I hate you guys, almost as much as Izaya.

Celty:
Shinra, something else still bothers me.
You said Saika disappeared 5 years ago, right?
Why is that? What happened 5 years ago?

Shinra:
Well, I highly doubt it chose to take a vacation.
It's possible that someone very strong came in contact with it.
And has somehow managed to suppress it.

Celty:
Who would that be?



Haruna:
I've thought about you for so long.
I know you loved me as much as I loved you.
You showed that in the way you tried to extort money from me.
And how you tried to abandon me once you got bored.
And no matter what, I accepted you, I loved and forgave you.
But still, that just wasn't enough.
No, that wasn't even close to enough.
And so, Saika, she started speaking to me and telling me things.
Things like this...
And that's how she speaks, with me giving her more blood.
See?
So, will you take my love?
I really do wanna give it to you.

Anri:
Wait!
Haruna...
Please, you have to stop this.
Stop hurting people with that knife.

Haruna:
How did you get out of there alive?

Anri:
Please stop.

Haruna:
Fine, whatever.
I'm guessing that someone came in and saved you again.
Now listen, I really don't like you coming here and telling me what I should do.
I don't need advice from someone so weak that they leech off of others...

Anri:
You have it wrong.
I didn't do it because I was weak, I had other options.
I chose this life for a reason, not because I had to.

Haruna:
Humph! Same thing.

Anri:
You can't judge people by how they live, and just decide if they're weak or strong!

Haruna:
So, tell me something.
Have you ever actually loved someone before?
No, I don't think you have.
So it goes to say, you can't understand me.
Listen close, I was able to take over Saika with the power of my love.
The first time Saika told me to cut Takashi, I resisted with everything I had.
But then, as I listened to her voice, I understood.
And that's why Saika and I have become the mother.
We're making as many children as we possibly can and an effort to spread our love!
That's right, love!
Someday, we will love and control the entire human race!

Anri:
You're right.
It's like you said, I can't love anyone.
I've been too scared ever since that day 5 years ago.
And that's why I choose to rely on others.

Haruna:
This can't be!

Anri:
You are able to make children by slashing others with that blade.
But your Saika is just another child, too.
The mother of all those blades is this.

I am unable to love.
And this is the reason that I must rely on Saika to love other people for me.
You see... I truly am her parasite.

Izaya:
It's a lie. It's the truth.
When a horrible past collides with the present, she gains unparalleled power just another unparalleled day.
Next time: Everything Changes.
