Kyohei:
What are you asking about the Dollars for, anyway?

Masaomi:
Don't tell me you're seriously thinking about joining the Dollars.

Shizuo:
What the hell kind of answer is that?!

Celty:
Why is some other body walking around with my head on its shoulders?!

Shinra:
Maybe your head stumbled across a fresh corpse!

Izaya:
This'll be fun! This'll be fun! This'll be fun!

Namie:
If the police come across that thing before we do, that won't work out well for us!
I want her dead or alive. If you have any trouble bringing her back, then dispose of her.



Mikado:
I don't know, things are kinda tight this month.
All right, I also have to get a sponge for the kitchen...

Clerk:
Thank you! Have a nice day!

Mikado:
The black bike!
It should be right around that corner...

I'm so sorry! Are you all right?
You're that...

Girl with a scar on her neck:
Save me!

Mikado:
Huh? Huh?

Girl with a scar on her neck:
Save me!

Akie, Haruko:
Wow! The Black Rider!

Akie:
Oh my God! This is so cool!

Haruko:
I can't believe it!



Masaomi:
Huh...
So you just bumped into this beautiful girl on the street who lost her memories and is being chased by the Black Rider.
And by the time I get here, this chick has already gone to sleep.
And you really think I'm gonna believe this wild-ass story you've concocted?

Mikado:
I'm telling you, man! It's really the truth!

Masaomi:
If this took place in the morning and it made you late for school, it'd be way better.
Oh, and if she were a transfer student, too, genius!
No, no, wait! She's a princess and your long-lost friend! Now, that's perfect!
Tell me, are you catching my witty sarcasm here or not?

Mikado:
Yeah, but if you have to explain it, then it's not so witty.
She says she can't remember anything and she won't let me go to the police.
I don't know what else I should do.

Masaomi:
Hm... You'll just have to keep an eye on her.
Let her sleep for now. And then tomorrow, when she wakes up, see if she feels any different.

Mikado:
Yeah.

Masaomi:
All right, see you tomorrow.

Mikado:
Cool. Thanks for coming so late.

The Black Rider knows my face now.
If that urban legend is actually true...
What if that thing comes after me? What am I gonna do?
I used to hate my ordinary life.
I wanted my life to be different than everyone else's.
I guess that's one of the reasons why I'm letting her stay here.
There's one thing I didn't tell Masaomi about - her scar.
It's almost as if someone sawed off her head, and then sewed it back on again.

Announcement:
We have an announcement from the student store.
They are currently sold out of the jumbo melon bread.

Masaomi:
Yo, Mikado!
How's that sleeping beauty you got stashed to your place?

Mikado:
What are you doing?!
Shh! Shh!

Classmate A:
What?
You got some chick staying with you?

Classmate B:
How'd I try to keep that on the down low too?

Masaomi:
Check it out.
He was just rounding a corner, and bumps into a cutie with amnesia who's being chased by bad guys.
And who's she living with now? This guy!

Classmate A:
Yeah, no way.
Kirigamine's just making that shit up.

Mikado:
N-No, it's Ryugamine...

Classmate:
Hey, does someone wanna buy my lunch tickets?

Masaomi:
See? Nothing to worry about because no one believes it.
So, how's the hottie?

Mikado:
I don't know, she was still asleep when I left.

Masaomi:
Sleeping beauty's pretty sleepy.
Alright, let's get to the point.

Mikado:
What point?

Masaomi:
Yeah, the point as to why I'm macking down in 4th period.
It's so that I can free myself up on the lunch break.

Mikado:
The Dollars poll?

Masaomi:
Dude, this is like the hot topic right now in our class.
These Dollars are totally shrouded in mystery.
So if you saw someone and thought, "That dude so looks like he's in the Dollars," then find his name on the list, then vote for him.

Mikado:
Wow, some people are getting a lot of votes.

Masaomi:
You can vote for as many people as you want.

Mikado:
Hey, that Takiguchi guy from 1-D has just received one vote so far.

Masaomi:
Thank you for noticing.
That's right. One vote. From none other than yours truly.
See? Me and that guy have gym class together, and I was like, "Yeah, that dude's gotta be in the Dollars."

Mikado:
What makes you think that?

Masaomi:
Hunch.
And now I'm off to find out for sure.

Mikado:
W-Wait a sec!

Masaomi:
Excuse me!
Is Ryou Takiguchi around now?

Ryou's classmate A:
He's not here.

Masaomi:
Did he go to eat?

Ryou's classmate B:
Bet he's up on the roof.
That's where he usually hangs out on lunch break.

Masaomi:
I bet he went up there to smoke a stogy.

Mikado:
Are you really sure we should go up here?
We might be heading into a rough crowd.

Masaomi:
Dude, I'm joking.
The only kids who smoke cigs on rooftops are the ones in some tedious manga.

Mikado:
Yeah, but, we just gonna go up to him and say, "Hey, are you in the Dollars?"
He's not gonna tell us the truth about something like that.

Masaomi:
You just leave that to me. I've got a plan.
Let's see... there!

Mikado:
H-He's smoking...

Masaomi:
What do you know! It's Takiguchi! Yo!

Ryou:
Hey.

Masaomi:
Oh, cool! You're writing a song.

Ryou:
Uh, yeah, I am.
So what's going on? You guys need something?

Masaomi:
I got a question.

Ryou:
Go for it.

Masaomi:
You're member of the Dollars or not?

Mikado:
Masaomi, what are you-

Ryou:
Yeah, I'm in with them.

Masaomi:
Thought so. In fact, I had no doubt at all.
See? My instincts! Perfect!
Oh, this guy here's an old friend of mine.

Mikado:
Uh, yeah, I'm Mikado Ryugamine.

Ryou:
Oh, you're that guy! You're famous.

Mikado:
Huh? I am?

Masaomi:
Just your name.

Ryou:
Want some?

Mikado:
Sure, thank you.

Masaomi:
Thanks, man.

Mikado:
So, Takiguchi, I got a question.

Ryou:
Hm?

Mikado:
What made you join the Dollars?

Ryou:
I'm not really sure exactly why I decided to do it...
I think it was 6 months ago. I got an email from some guy I didn't even know.
He mentioned the Dollars and said they didn't have any kind of rules or conditions.
My first thought was, "Yeah, right," but then I thought if there was a group like that, I'd wanna be a part of it.
Truth is, last thing I want is to be bossed around, or vice versa.

Masaomi:
So, what are the Dollars like? Fill us in.

Ryou:
Well, guess I'd say "transparent" as in "no color."

Mikado:
"Transparent?"

Ryou:
Yeah. They are not like the other guys.
The Yellow Scarves and Blue Squares were all about showing your colors and getting into turf wars, but the Dollars aren't into that.

Mikado:
Who are the Blue Squares?

Ryou:
They were a color gang that was a big deal when I was in middle school.
I don't know the details, but they got into some trouble and then fell apart.

Mikado:
Masaomi?

Masaomi:
So then, you're telling us that you like the Dollars?

Ryou:
Yeah.

Mikado:
You ever get together with the other members?

Ryou:
Well, members only know each other by their usernames.
But yeah, I've met a bunch of 'em, either at work or in town. Just by accident.
If you think "I bet he is with the Dollars," it turns out they usually are.

Mikado:
How can you tell by looking at them?

Ryou:
I don't know, it's hard to explain.
Just ask 'em. I think most guys ya ask would admit it straight off.
Well, that blows.

Masaomi:
See ya, suckers!

Mikado:
Once I found out that Takiguchi was part of the Dollars, I swore I'd keep it a secret and never tell anyone.
I don't know him but I'm guessing he wouldn't want people to make a big deal out of it.
I figure if anyone who wants to know, they can ask him.

Stand. Bow.



Girl:
Okay, that's it for the class rep's meeting.

Mikado:
I wonder if Masaomi's hall monitor meeting is over.

Anri:
Hm... Well, if it isn't, it should be over pretty soon.

Mikado:
Mika Harima, the girl who was stalking Seiji Yagiri, has been missing even before school started.

So, have you heard anything new on your friend, Mika?

Anri:
No, nothing.

Boy:
Hey, Mikado! Masaomi said for you to go home without him!

Mikado:
Huh? Why? Is everything okay?

Boy:
Yeah, yeah. The hall monitors are just having a huge argument right now.
It's all good! See ya!

Mikado:
Well then, are you ready to go?

Anri:
Sure.

Mikado:
I wonder what's so important that Masaomi would still like to argue about it.
You know, it's probably just like clothes and...

Masaomi:
Mikado!
Don't screw it up with that fine chica! And next time, you have to introduce me!
Peace out! Later!

Mikado:
Uh, he meant Ms. Finechica! It's this French girl we met at that Russia Sushi place!
And uh... sh-sh-sh-she's got, got a nose ring!
I'm sure that's what he's been arguing about whether or not they should allow nose rings in school!

Anri:
You know, I've kinda known who you were long before you and I even met in class.

Mikado:
Eh?

Anri:
When I came to this school to register, I saw a list of names on a desk as I was handing in my paperwork.
I noticed one of the names right away, I thought it was cool.
The guy with that name was right next to me...
And then, next thing I know, he and I ended up being class reps together...

Mikado:
Wait a second!
Isn't this sort of like what her friend Mika did to that Seiji guy?
Oh, man! Is she a stalker?
Hold on. If she's cute, maybe it's okay.
No, no, no, no. This is still bad.
If something happens...
Sh-She could coolly stab me!
Or she might even set my place on fire!
Hold on. What if she takes my parents hostage?
But if she's a good person, maybe I don't mind her stalking me.
What am I saying? If she's stalking me, then she can't be a good person.

Anri:
I was just kidding.
Besides, you wouldn't want someone like me hanging around all the time.

Mikado:
No, I...

Anri:
I know that sounded weird.
But don't worry, I'm not a stalker or anything!

Mikado:
No, I didn't... Well, I...
I'm sorry...

Anri:
Huh? No, it's fine!
I was the one who started it by teasing you.
There's no need to apologize.

So...

Mikado:
Alright...

Well, listen, uh...
I'm... I'm glad we became friends.

Anri:
I'm glad we became friends, too.

Yoko:
Huh? Ahhhhh!
Takeshi, that's him! That's the loser! Look!

Mikado:
I wonder who the loser is.
It's not me, right?

Yoko:
I'm talking to you!
Don't ignore me, you pathetic runt!

Mikado:
Well, um, just how do I know you?

Yoko:
I'm the one whose cell phone was smashed by your freaky friend!
So I had to go and buy a new one!

Mikado:
Sorry, but, I really have no idea what you're talking about.

Takeshi:
This true?
You friends with that punk ass bitch who went and busted my girl's cell phone?

Mikado:
Well, I don't think he and I are really friends.

Takeshi:
So then, what is he? Your daddy?! Your legal guardian?!
Huh? Huh?

Mikado:
Um... those really your other guesses?

Takeshi:
Huh?!
You trying to get saucy there rattling, are ya?
I think it's time you got a lesson about where you belong on the food chain.

Izaya:
Are you exploiting my rule against hitting women?
What a clever girl you are. I would ask you out.
However, you're so not my type. Now scram!

Yoko:
You are an asshole!

Izaya:
Have a nice day!
So, Mikado Ryugamine, I was laying low outside the school's front gate, hoping I'd run into you.
I'd like to have a little chat.
By the way, what's the Black Rider doing here?

Mikado:
It's looking for that girl...
Oh, gosh! I forgot!
I-I'm sorry, but I really gotta go right now!
Bye! See you tomorrow, Anri!



Mikado:
This is so bizarre.
If they stay on my tail like this, they're gonna end up following me all the way home.
And then...

Girl with a scar on her neck:
Save me!

Mikado:
Um... Okay.... So...
If you wanna talk to me about something, let's do it now.

Izaya:
Go on. I'll let the Black Rider go first.
Hello? Always happen to be of service...

Mikado:
Um, there's something I would like to ask you.

Celty:
What is it?

Mikado:
So it can communicate.
Well I, I was just wondering what you are.

Celty:
I'm looking for a girl.
She's a relative of mine who's gone missing.
I found her yesterday, but then she ran away for some reason.

Mikado:
It's a terrible liar...
Um, I'm sorry but I don't believe you.

Celty:
How much do you really know about me?

Mikado:
Well I, I just know what the urban legend says.
That you ride around on this bike with no head lighting nor actual motor sounds.
And that... that you don't really have a head.

Celty:
And do you actually believe this?

Mikado:
You know, you could always show me what's inside your helmet.
That was pretty shocking.
Even for me, I didn't think I'd have the guts to say that.

Celty:
Promise me that you won't scream?

Mikado:
But at the same time, I felt like I'd been waiting for a moment like this to occur, for years.
I still can't describe how I felt at that exact moment.
I just found myself thinking, "I knew it! I knew it!" over and over again.
Thank you so much!

After that, the Black Rider told me everything.
Like the real reason it was looking for that girl yesterday.
It told me it was a Dullahan named Celty, that she'd come to Japan and searched for her head that had been stolen.
And when Celty saw the girl with the stitches on her neck, her face looked just like her own.
Normally, I would never believe a story like that, but for some reason, sitting there with her, I felt like I could.

Celty:
So, are you friends with this girl?

Mikado:
No. Actually, yesterday was the first time that I ever met her.
I asked her a lot of questions, but she told me that she'd lost all her memories and...
Miss Celty?

Celty:
Would you be willing to let me see her?

Mikado:
Well, I don't know.
I mean, she does seem pretty freaked out by you.
You did chase her down kind of hard yesterday.

Celty:
I need to see this girl, no matter what.
Maybe you can clear up any false impressions.

Mikado:
I'll do my best.



Saburo:
Nothing like some fruity milk in the afternoon.

Walker:
I don't know about you, but for me, this is a sure sign if she's turning into a real Biri-biri Heroine.

Erika:
No, no, no!
The only real heroine is gonna be Himegami!

Kyohei:
Chill, dude!
What the hell's going on?

Saburo:
That bastard... What he did...

Kyohei:
Huh?

Saburo:
He kicked up a rock and hit my van!

Kyohei:
Calm down, Saburo!

Saburo:
You won't get away with this!

Kyohei:
That's a red light! Red light! Red light!



Mikado:
Just give me a minute, okay?
I wanna go inside and explain things.
I'm afraid she might think that I betrayed her if she sees you guys before I tell her what's really going on...

Celty:
I understand.

Izaya:
He sure is a cautious boy, isn't he?

Mikado:
Huh?

Izaya:
You know, this was the first time I've actually heard your real name.
I had no idea that you were a foreigner...

Celty:
Liar.
Throw another rock at my horse and I'll make you swallow it.

Izaya:
Wow, it's a horse. Who knew?
Hey, what do you think? This is taking longer than it should, right?

Celty:
Cleaning service... in this run-down place?
Oh, no...

Man A:
Alright, I'm gonna make this really easy for ya.
All you gotta do is tell us where you're hiding the girl.

Man B:
This hair that I found in your futon looks to me like a girl's hair.

Mikado:
Please! I really don't know!
Just, just let me go, okay?

Man A:
We can't do that now that you've seen our faces.
Best thing for us to do would be to kill you right here.

Man B:
Someone's coming!

Mikado:
Oh, thank God. I'm saved...

Izaya:
There's no need to follow them.
I know where they're from. I've seen that van before.
Chances are pretty good Yagiri Pharmaceuticals sent them.

Mikado:
A pharmaceutical company?

Izaya:
Yup.
It's a dying behemoth of a company that's about to be bought out by a foreign investor.

Mikado:
The girl with the scar on her neck, the Dullahan, the disappearances, Mika Harima, Seiji Yagiri, human trafficking, and then, the Dollars.

Celty:
What's he doing?

Mikado:
I didn't wanna be normal.

Izaya:
Honestly, I only half believed this was true.

Mikado:
I need a big favor. I'm hoping you guys can help me out.
I wanted my life to be different from everyone else.
Alright, I think all my cards are in order now.
That's why...

Izaya:
And jackpot!

Mikado:
I decided to...



<Preview>

Mikado:
I didn't wanna be normal.
I wanted my life to be different from everyone else.
But I never would have thought that this one simple wish would affect so many people...
Next time: Storm and Stress.
