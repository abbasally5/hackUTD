  <Opening>

Mikado:
The Dollars?

Masaomi:
I don't know much about 'em. All's I know is there's a lot of 'em.
I also heard they're kinda crazy. How would you stay away from them if I was you...

Anri:
She even missed the first day of school.

Seiji:
I don't know anything!

Masaomi:
Hey, whatever you do, stay away from Shizuo Heiwajima.

Mikado:
Izaya Orihara?

Masaomi:
He's a ton of bad news, so stay away from him, too.

His name is Simon.
He's from Russia. He's pretty cool. He works for that Russia sushi place.



Simon:
Eat at Russia Sushi! You come try! It's cheap, you'll like it!
There is no need to run, mister. Eat at Russia Sushi, it's good!

Girl:
Uh, excuse me.

Simon:
To the north, you have a massive entertainment district.
On any given day, over a million people can be found here, in Ikebukuro.
It's a city overflowing with strangers...
Both he and she... They all come here, looking for something.
And they come to this city, hoping to change something.



Teacher:
All... right...
We still need class representatives. Do we happen to have any volunteers for this?

Simon:
You come to a new city.
And no one here knows who you used to be. You get a chance to become someone new.
But...

Teacher:
Oh... uh... Sonohara... Anri Sonohara.
So, is there anybody else? Then, that's it for the girls.
Okay Anri, it's your turn.

Anri:
Um, well I...
I was wondering if there is a boy who wants to be a class rep with me?

Mikado:
I kinda want to, but it seems like it might be sort of a hassle.
But then again, if I let someone else do it, then...

Classmate A:
You should do it.

Classmate B:
Why would I wanna do that? Do it!

Classmate A:
Sounds kinda lame.

Mikado:
I'll do it.

Anri:
Okay, um...

Mikado:
I'm Mikado Ryugamine.

Anri. So tomorrow, guess we need to go to that meeting with the other classes...
You know, that'll be my first time attending something like that...

Anri:
Listen! I have to go right now. I'm sorry!

Masaomi:
Well, aren't you smooth?
I remember how in grade school you'd get all teary-eyed if someone even whispered a rumor about you.
And now you're acting all pimp, making plans for your big hook up with her.

Mikado:
Whatever.

Masaomi:
But, your last move kinda weak.
If you want high school romance to be a rollicking ride, then you're gonna have to admit there's some shame in your game and step up to the cut.

Mikado:
I wasn't trying to...

Masaomi:
Why not you and me pick up some chicks?



Masaomi:
You like what you see? How couldn't you!
'Cause with these good looks and my awesome moves, you want me!

Mikado:
They're not gonna go out with a high-schooler.

Simon:
They come here, looking for some sort of change.
But change does not always come so easily.
Just because you change where you are, doesn't mean you've changed who you are.

Girl A:
Huh? As if.

Girl B:
Yah, I've already got a boyfriend.

Masaomi:
Not a problem.
Having a drink with a guy, even if he's hitting on you, still isn't cheating.

Girl A:
So d'you hear the latest?
That new boyfriend Yumi has, he's with the Dollars.

Girl C:
What? Shut up!

Girl A:
That's gotta freak her out.

Masaomi:
So interesting. Let's grab a drink and you can tell me all about.

Girl B:
Aren't the Dollars the biker gang who would trash everything?

Girl: A
What? Oh, they don't do that.

Simon:
There are groups in this city who, at times, become quite violent.
Members of these groups, they wear a color to symbolize who they represent.
They're known as the color gangs.
But there is another group, one whose power and influence grows.
And they have no color.
They're different, transparent. That's the color of a group known as the Dollars.
They're a unique group with growing numbers, whose members are collected through their website.

Girl A:
Oh yeah.
You know, I heard the other day that the Dollars are the ones behind all those crazy stabbings lately.

Girl B:
No way!

Masaomi:
Fascinating! Why don't we go get that drink now?
Come on, I'll take you someplace nice.



Kanra:
You say the Dollars? Yeah, I know 'em.

Taro Tanaka:
Well, what are they like?

Kanra:
They're totally cool.
I heard they just scored some crazy deal with the Chinese mafia.
And remember when all those Yakuza got stabbed? It was like their low-end junior guys who did that.



Masaomi:
Oh man, why'd they have to bail?
You know, I bet it was your gloomy face that scared those chicks off.

Erika:
Hey Masaomi!

Masaomi:
Hey, hey!

Walker:
It's that dude with the manga name. Uh, let me see, what was it?
Mikado! That was it.

Erika:
You wanna hit a comic book store?

Walker:
Because...
Suzie Yasuda's gonna be there and do a book signing today!

Kyohei:
Ugh! Keep that stuff on the down low, will ya?

Walker:
Huh? What for? I can't get enough of Suzie's books, they're so cool.



Setton:
The Dollars?
Yeah, I've heard of them.

Taro Tanaka:
A friend of mine started talking about 'em today.

Setton:
But, I've never actually seen them.
Do they really exist?

Taro Tanaka:
Think it's some sort of internet prank?

Setton:
I don't know for sure...
But if they do exist, I think it's best to steer clear of groups like that.



Walker:
The Dollars?
They've got a continuous duel with the Flame Haze, deep within the subbasement of Sunshine 60, right?

Erika:
You've got it wrong, Yumatchi.
That's the angel who flies through the sky, flashing her panties, singing "Pi-piru-piru-piru".

Kyohei:
What are you asking about the Dollars for, anyway?

Mikado:
Nothing. I was just curious.

Masaomi:
What? Did that story ya heard earlier scare ya?

Kyohei:
There are a lot of rumors about them. Well, it is they're pretty dangerous.

Mikado:
Wow, you don't say.

Kyohei:
I wouldn't try and get near them just for kicks.
The less you know about those guys, the better.

Walker:
You are so freaking cool.
Know what you are? You're the wise older brother character.

Erika:
Or do you get girls with daddy issues who call you "papa?"

Walker:
No, no, no. I think he's...

Kyohei:
Stop it!

Simon:
There are places in this city where a good person should never go.



Simon:
You'll no puke, I promise! Just try it once and you'll see it's true!
Once time not enough to kill you.

Tom:
Man, I'm starving.

Shizuo:
Yeah, I hear ya.

Tom:
Let's grab something to eat.

Man:
That the Headless Rider!?

Woman:
No way!

Tom:
It's too early for spooky stuff.

Shizuo:
Always working.

Simon:
Sometimes, a person can be swallowed up by a city like this, leaving others to look for their trace.

Seiji:
I'll find her. I know I will.
My love for her will pull me to her.

Anri:
Mika?

Mika!
I-I thought you were my friend, I'm so sorry!

Simon:
You see, in this city, danger can be found anywhere.

Yoko:
Hey, bitch.

Simon:
Like here.

Masaomi:
Come on! Hang out with us.
I know my good looks and charming smile can't be intimidating. But hey, wait!

Simon:
And there.



Simon:
What he was seeking was change.

Gang member:
Oh, come on. You're kidding me, right?

Simon:
The potential of a new place gave him hope that something different might happen here.
But what was really waiting for him was the dark underbelly that hides just below this city's surface.
Doubt begins to overtake him. He starts questioning if he can really make it here.
And then, he gets scared.

Masaomi:
I know what you're thinking.
Ride the train and you're treated like a perv! Walk a block and hawkers scam ya.
Stay home too much and the neighbors strike! And then the Dollars and the Headless Rider...
Tokyo is a concrete jungle!
But! That said! It is a challenge that you must overcome!
You wanted to be a real Ikebukurian, didn't you? Then accept your challenge, Mikado Ryugamine!
Hey, and no matter what happens, I've always got your back.

Mikado:
Thanks, man.

Masaomi:
And when we're out hitting on girls, do me a favor: Just smile.

Mikado:
Um... I don't know how much luck you're gonna have hitting on girls over 20.

Masaomi:
So? Who cares?
The point is just to talk to them. If you actually get digits, bonus.

Haruko:
So, you're still walking around, trying to act all high, even though Mika Harima is gone.

Yoko:
And now you're the class rep?

Masaomi:
Whoa, check it out. That chick is totally getting bullied.

Mikado:
But those other girls are so cliche, they're more funny than scary.

Haruko:
You know, her boy friend is with the Dollars.

Yoko:
Hiroshi!

Hiroshi:
Yo! Wassup dawg? What do you say I ring up my Dollars brothers? Get my homies here and I'll show you how I roll.

Simon:
You know his kind. He can be found in any country.

Hiroshi:
Fo sho!

Masaomi:
Wow, you gotta love a guy who goes for the classics.

Mikado:
You really should step in and try to help her, but how do I do that?
Okay you guys, that's enough!
Oh man, those guys are gonna kick the crap out of me.
Hey there Anri, what a coincidence. See ya!
Perfect. That'll work!

Anri:
Oh, my hero...

Izaya:
Bullies, huh?
You wanna save the day, don't ya?

Simon:
It's times like this, when things happen in our city, that defy the imagination.

Mikado:
U-Umm... Well I...
What are you...
Huh? No no wait, hold on, I...

Yoko:
What, dork?

Mikado:
Well, you see, I...

Izaya:
Bullying people is lame. It's pathetic, really.

Haruko:
What are you? Like 40? Butt out.

Izaya:
Listen, it's not my problem if you lovely ladies get pommeled to death and die.
I can knock your teeth down your throat, or you can bag on my age when I'm actually just 23, I don't care.
You're in a class that's so beneath me, it doesn't matter.

Haruko:
Huh?

Izaya:
Human beings are weak things.
But, beating up chicks isn't really my shtick.
So, I guess the next best thing I can do is take your precious cell phone, and smash it.

Akie:
Freak...

Izaya:
And now I'm bored.
I guess that's enough cellphone smashing for one day.

Yoko:
H-Hiroshi!

Hiroshi:
Yo yo yo! You going down, fool.

Izaya:
Violence? Ooh, that's so scary.

Hiroshi:
Wha- You mother...

Izaya:
Whoa, you're too tough for me!

Hiroshi:
Hey, wait! Stop!
You're asking for trouble, dog!

Izaya:
He didn't even know it was coming.



Izaya:
Man, that was truly impressive. Trying to save the oppressed girl from the bullies?
So Masaomi, it's been a while.

Masaomi:
Yeah, it has.

Izaya:
That's a Raira Academy uniform, yah?
Well done on getting in.

Masaomi:
Oh, right, thanks.
I didn't expect to see you, Izaya. You're not normally in Ikebukuro.

Mikado:
So, this is the Izaya Orihara that I'm absolutely not to piss off.

Masaomi:
Oh, sorry, this guy here's just a friend.

Izaya:
Hmm...
I am Izaya Orihara, you are?

Mikado:
I'm Mikado Ryugamine.

Izaya:
Sounds like the name of an air conditioner.

Masaomi:
So then, what brings you out this way?

Izaya:
I came to see somebody.
And now I have.

Mikado:
That was like, a convenience store trashcan.
That came flying at us, but why?

Masaomi:
Holy shit!

Shizuo:
Well, well. What's up, Izaya?

Mikado:
Is that a bartender?

Shizuo:
Didn't I tell you never to set foot in Ikebukuro again?
You remember that, Izaya, don't ya?

Izaya:
Shizu-chan. Last I heard you had some gig, working over by the West gate.

Shizuo:
Got fired ages ago.
And I'm pretty sure that I've told you never to call me that.
My name is Shizuo Heiwajima. Try to get it right.

Mikado:
Shizuo Heiwajima?
That's the other guy I'm absolutely not to piss off.

Izaya:
Oh, come on, Shizu-chan.
So I pinned you for something you didn't do. Who knew you'd get so mad?

Shizuo:
Oh, I'm not mad. I just wanna beat the shit out of you.

Izaya:
You know, the problem with you, Shizu-chan, is that you can't be swayed by reason and that's bad.
Really bad.
Now let me go.

Hiroshi:
There! That's the guy!
No punk ass bitch gets to make a fool outta me!

Dollars member A:
And you don't go playing around with the Dollars!
What's with the bartender?

Hiroshi:
I don't know. He wasn't here a minute ago.

Dollars member B:
Is that Shizuo Heiwajima?

Shizuo:
What the hell do you want?

Simon:
In the face of fear, your average man will lose his ability to think rationally.

Shizuo:
You aimed for my head.
You have to know a blow like that could kill a guy, right?
And this means that you were intentionally trying to kill me, right?
So then, whatever happens next is what you deserve, right?

Simon:
Men with overwhelming power instinctively strike fear into the hearts of others.
He's violence personified... It's what he lives and breathes...
Simply put, he is the very definition of violence.

Dollars member C:
We're the Dollars!

Hiroshi:
I mean, not really... That isn't us.
Why are you running?
If we outnumber this-

Izaya:
Well, have fun!

Shizuo:
Where do you think you're going?

Mikado:
Why did he come from the sky?

Simon:
Maybe not the best question, but since I was asked...
I was delivering sushi to a good customer on the top floor.

Shizuo:
Simon, what are you doing?

Simon:
Shizuo. Fighting always bad.

Shizuo:
Shut up!
And stay outta my way!

Masaomi:
Hey, Mikado! Time to split!
Huh? What the... Mikado!

Mikado:
H-Hey! Hold on a...



Mikado:
Ah! I-I'm sorry!

Simon:
Now and then, this city will give you a gift. These little presents contain big miracles.
The very adventure you seek is now there before you, creating a host of new possibilities.
And...

Mikado:
Um... H-Hey, I just...

Anri:
Thank you so much.

Mikado:
Huh?

Anri:
I gotta go.

Simon:
Sometimes, the adventure never comes.

Seiji:
There you are. I've found you.
My love...

Girl D:
The Dollars struck again!

Girl E:
Yeah, I heard.
They picked a huge fight with Shizuo Heiwajima in broad daylight.

Man A:
Sounds like the Dollars are flexing their muscles again.

Man B:
Now there's a war between the Dollars and Shizuo.



Kanra:
So I heard.

Taro Tanaka:
You guys got it all wrong. I was there, I saw it all.
That isn't how it went down. Those guys weren't part of the Dollars.

Kanra:
No no, not that.
Just now, some guys calling themselves the Dollars robbed these pedestrians of all their cash.

Taro Tanaka:
What?

Kanra:
Doesn't that sound scary? It scares me.
I would steer clear of the Dollars.

Taro Tanaka:
Okay...

Kanra:
The Dollars kinda freak me out.



Shizuo:
You know, Izaya was in Ikebukuro today.
I was hoping that I could wipe him off the planet, once and for all.
But then, Simon showed up. Bastard. What's up? Why was he there?

Simon:
This is a city overflowing with strangers...
They all come here, looking for something or someone.
They come to this city, hoping to change something.
And I am no different.

Come in! Come in!
Sushi good! Come eat sushi!



<Preview>

Shinra:
I wanna tell you my story.
It's about me and her. And it's like nothing you've ever heard.
Please let me tell it.
Next time: Utterly Alone.
You won't believe it. It will knock you down with a feather.
