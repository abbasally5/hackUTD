  He's gone... Bloody hell...

Where is Lord Barrymore?

The demon hound... The great hound is here.

The hound?!

♪ The white dog is a good dog, a good dog, good ♪
♪ The black dog is a bad dog, a bad dog, bad ♪
♪ He'll eat your flesh down to the bone, down to the bone ♪
♪ He'll gobble you up until you're gone, until you're gone ♪

What's happening?

♪ Lullaby, the sun sets, lullaby and good night ♪

Snap out of it! What you all doin'?!

Oh great demon hound!

Please, please, oh, please!

Demon hound, please forgive us!

Angela!

His Butler, Training


Well, this is unfortunate, master.
To think all this happening after the case was closed.
I'm sure you're a bit... annoyed?

Are you quite finished?

Where is Angela?

We left her resting up in her bed for now.
She seems tired, yes she does.

So painful to watch. Poor bird.

This village isolated itself completely from the rest of society out of fear of the demon hound's curse...
I thought for certain the hound was an illusion created by Lord Barrymore so he could firmly rule the village.
But with him dead... I need to rethink things.

He was covered in bite wounds... Maybe the villagers are right.
Maybe it really was the demon hound.

Maybe he's upset at being blamed for Lord Henry's misdeeds.

Yes, maybe. 
For now, there's only one thing we know: it wasn't human.

The hound then.


Is something the matter?

It's about what you said earlier, how you phrased it.
What you said was this wasn't human work.
What if that bloody reaper has gotten himself involved in this?

I'm a deadly efficient butler!☆

It seems you're learning faster every day.
I'm so very proud of you, sir.
But there is no need to worry.
I believe Mey-Rin's thought was not wholly incorrect.
The hound was after Lord Henry.
I don't believe anyone else is in danger of becoming its victim.

That's not enough information for me to close the case.

Ah, such loyalty to your Queen. Quite touching, really.

That's not it. At least not all of it.

You're usually so calm and steady, but this case seems to have you rattled. 
I'm interested about this issue you have with the dogs.

As I said, you learn faster every day.


Oh sweet Angela... I hope she's all right.
Wh-Who's there?!

Hey, what are you doing?!

Finny, did you hear that spooky noise?!

Yeah. Was was it?

Maybe it's the late Lord Barrymore...
What if he's back for revenge?

Uh... why are you happy?

Oh, I simply adore a good scary story, Finny, yes I do!
I'm so excited, I'm shivering!
C'mon, let's go investigate!

B-B-But why...?

It's all so horribly frightening!

That isn't a good thing.

That tickles.
No, not so rough...
Careful... That's it... Good boy.

This is scandalous, yes it is!
Angela must be a very hard woman to behave like this.
There she is only hours after her master died a horrible death!
Maybe that's what made her so passionate...
Finny?
Finny?!

Angela... Angela... Why?!

Now he's lost it...


Goods mornin', everyone.

Ah, good morning.

Angela, are you sure you should be out of bed?

I'm fine. I'm sorry for all the trouble.
My master would be most disappointed in my weak behavior in front of guests...
He always insisted on courtesy first...
Oh, are you all right? You look so pale...

Ah!
Uh, I'm sick! It's a tiny little touch of the cold, nothing more!
But you shouldn't get too close, or you might catch it!
Sorry, bye!

For a sick bloke he can sure run quickly, don't you think?


Oh my Angela...

Finny!


For today's tea we have a cabinet pudding. It was made using local blackberries.

You're certainly relaxed.

Because we're in no hurry, sir.

Sebastian, hurry!

What's the matter this time? Do calm down, please.

We've looked all over, but we can't find Angela!

Oh, is that all?
Yeah, don't worry about it.
She said  there were some medicinal herbs growing by the fen.
She went there to pick some up, that's all.

Right now? Why would she?

She went all alone when there might be a demon hound out there?

Oh, hell...

What was she thinking going out all by herself?

She said she was worried, you know, about you being kind of sick and all.

For me? She went for me?

C'mon, Sebastian! Let's go help him!

Well, er...

Hurry! Are you a red-blooded man or aren't you!
Fine, then. Let's go, Mey-Rin.

Sir, yes, sir!

Where's Tanaka?

Ho ho ho ho...

That's the spirit! Okay, let's move out, men!

Sir, yes, sir!

Ho ho ho ho...

You know, I'm quite interested. What color is your blood?
At any rate, it looks as if we do need to hurry now.
Go out there and put on a good show for me. Am I clear?

Perfectly, my young lord.


- Intermission -


Angela!

Angela!

Angela!

Can you hear me?

Ho ho ho...

Oh, Angela... Please, answer us...

What's wrong?

What are those?

I don't think I can take any more surprises...

Hey, look at that ring...

It's Lord Henry's?

(howling)

My, who's he?

A trophy... So it really wasn't the demon hound that killed Lord Henry.
It was a human being after all.

Quite the specimen of humanity, he is...

But why? Did he have some sort of grudge against Lord Henry?

I wonder... Could Angela have asked him to do it?

Say what? Why would Angela do that?

Yeah, he's right!

Easy, boy!

Angela has nothing to do with this! Don't just go around accusing people!

Shh!

What're you doin'? Why're you dressed like that?

We're all going to bathe in the waterfall to ease the wrath of the demon hound.

He's back. His terrible voice echoed throughout the village all last night!

Yeah, for hours and hours!
The demon's angry is still among us!

A howl, eh?

Oi, Finny, come back!

All right, everyone, now let's get back to stretching!

One, two! One, two!

(howling)

Wh-Where's that sound...?

Uh-oh, he is real...

It's the demon hound!

That fabric...
It's Angela's!

What you doin'?! Finny, wait!

Angela!

Oh, hell! Here, gimme that!
Time to show you what I can do.
Bloody hell! Why would you bring a toy gun with you?!

(growls)

Huh?

Would you look at that. So well-trained, you even know how to shake hands.

You are just in time.

But I'm afraid, well-trained or not, you'll have to go now!

Come, this is no time to be playing with a puppy.

Master!

Certainly. I shall finish it off at once.
It smells irresistible, doesn't it, dog?
This is what you want, right?
Inukko, the treat no dog can refuse.

Dog treats?

(howls)

Look out, Sebastian!

There is only one way to properly train a bad dog.
You must teach the creature to obey your every command.
Using rewards and punishments!
Firstly, reward!

Okay, what's he doing now?

I guess this is... training?

And now... punish!
Reward.
Punish!
Reward.
Punish! Puuuunish!

Well, I suppose I did ask him to put on a good show.

And finally... a hug!

Sebastian!

Uhh, hello?

I don't see him down there!

Quit dawdling down in that hole! Get back here right now!

Yes, sir.

Ow, ow, hot!
Oi, what is this, a hot spring?

Ho ho ho.

Um, where's Sebastian?

This village is intended to be a resort for the Queen. It needs a central attraction.
A luxury, a way for visitors to relax and forget their cares.
That's what we have here: a natural hot spring.

Wow, he's amazing!

Ohh.

If I couldn't find a hot spring or two for my master, well, then what kind of butler would I be?
The idea is simply unthinkable.

I don't know how much more scenes I can take!

Pluto!

Pluto?

Good boy. My good boy.
I'm sorry for the confusion. This is Pluto, I found him last month.
I've always been a big dog lover.
And he was so adorable, I absolutely had to take him in.

"Adorable"?

He does have a bad habit of turning human when he gets excited.

A "habit"! You call it a "habit"?!

So you sheltered and fed him for a month without telling anybody else?

That's right. Lord Barrymore used the legend of the demon hound to control the villagers, but in truth he feared the hound more than anyone else.
I didn't know what would happen to Pluto if he found out...
I see now I was too indulgent.
I never thought this sweet boy would hurt Lord Barrymore...
I beg you, sir! Please take him with you!
I know it's an imposition, but would you bring him to live at the Phantomhive manor?

You want us to keep that monster?!

He needs a firm hand.
I think if Sebastian were there to train him, he would become a good dog.

No thank you. I'm a butler, not one hell of a dog trainer.

Why not?

Master...
Is this an order?

It is. I think I'll find it amusing... in several ways.

The curse of the great demon hound is lifted!

Oh thank goodness, we're finally free!

What's all this about?

My lord, there is a legend in this village
When the sins of our ancestors against dogs have been fully atoned for, the land will weep tears of forgiveness.

The land's tears are a blessing!

Don't they realize the hot spring has been there under the ground all along?

Likely not. At any rate, our work here is done.

I seem to recall you were forced to eat your words earlier.
Would you like to say it again now that it's true?

Why don't you do it?

This case is now officially closed!


Excellent. This is just perfect.

Allow me, sir, traditional hot spring service.
You see, my lord, this is how the Japanese enjoy hot springs.

It is a nice addition.

Oi! Bring that over there!

Good spa sale, reasonably priced, good selection. Come and get 'em.

That gloomy village has experienced quite a transformation.
I imagine it would be enough to dispel the Queen's worries.

Something tells me that my worries are only just beginning...

(howling)


Nice and snug. Don't ever forget me, dear Pluto.

And put some bloody clothes on, alright!?
Don't just let it all hang out there! C'mon!

Ah well, it was fun, Angela...

I'm sure we'll meet again someday, my sweet boy.

If you're finished, shall we go?

Certainly. Maybe someday I'll come to visit Pluto at the estate.

I don't know if that would be a good idea.

What?

You were able to tame a demon hound. That's a task not many people could do.
You seem to have a talent for wrapping lesser beings around your finger.

Let's go, Sebastian.

Goodbye! I hope we'll see you again!

One day, you shall.


- Ending -


Talbot's camera, eh?
What a delightful little toy for a child to play with.
Would you like me to take your picture?
Oh dear, please turn to the right, young master.
From the left, your profile is rather... unfortunate, shall we say.

Next time on Black Butler: "His Butler, Phantom Image."

You see, I am simply one hell of a butler.
