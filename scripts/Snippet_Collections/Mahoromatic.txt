エッチなのはいけないと思います。


Suguru:
Hello, Mahoro. I'm home now.

Mahoro:
Welcome home, sir.
You're home a little earlier than usual this afternoon.

Suguru:
She seems to be acting normal.
Which means...
Oh, thanks you, God!
I'm going upstairs to change.
Could you please get me something cold to drink?

Mahoro:
Sure!

Suguru:
Wow, amazing!
It doesn't even look like my room!
Ugh...
Huh? Urgh...

Mahoro:
By the way, Suguru...
There's something I'd like to talk to you about.
I think that dirty thoughts are very bad.
And you wanna know what else I think?
I think that women's breasts are important vessels which exist to provide nourishment for babies, and should never be looked at lewdly by a young male person.
I'm certain that your mother taught you that important lesson when she raised you.
And you're very well looking at women's breasts inside a dirty magazine with a lewdness in your eyes.
I understand the general tendency of the magazines you collect.
But women with large breasts have to bear a large burden because of it.
And I hear they suffer from bad backs.
And most importantly, a woman's ability as a mother doesn't have anything to do with the size of her breasts.
