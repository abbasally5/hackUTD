He should be taking care of his own fricking racer.

Kazuma:
What do you want?
He's got community service.

Bismarck:
Well, he better get back here fast!

Takeru:
Guys!

Bismarck:
Huh?

Kazuma:
Hey, done serving time for today?

Takeru:
Yeah.

Takeru:
Bis! Do you know this girl?

Bismarck:
No, I don't.

Takeru:
Kazuma!

Kazuma:
Where did get that photo?

Takeru:
I found it outside!

Kazuma:
Outside the dome?!

Takeru:
Yeah.

Kazuma:
Maybe it's memento or something like that.

Takeru:
But I saw it fall down.

Bismarck:
Huh? From where?

Takeru:
Where? From up in the sky.

Bismarck:
The sky?

Kazuma:
It says on the back; "We are safe." and "Is anybody out there?"

Takeru:
See? What do you think it means?

Kazuma:
How would I know?

Takeru:
Hey, Kazuma!

Bismarck:
Hey! What about the cowl?

Takeru:
Where do you think she is? In space?

Kazuma:
No, the photo was taken on land.

Bismarck:
Hey! Kakeru... Kazuma!

Takeru:
Hey, she looks about our age, don't you think?

Kazuma:
Yeah.

Takeru:
I knew it. Yeah, I thought that too.

Bismarck:
The cowl!

Takeru:
So, what do you think that girl's trying to say to us?

Kazuma:
What? Still haven't got her off your mind?

Takeru:
Of course not! How could I?

Bismarck:
Oh, man. He's in love again?

Takeru:
I'm not...

Kazuma:
Phew... First Chiyo. Now, some mystery girl.

Takeru:
Y-You guys need to focus on the race.
