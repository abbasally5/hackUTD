ライガットとシギュン、ホズルとの再開


Woman:
Sigyn.
What should I do with this?

Sigyn:
If it's too tightly packed, it will hamper movement and, huh...

Woman:
What is it, Queen Sigyn?

Sigyn:
Rygart Arrow!

Rygart:
Hm? Syg... Ah!
S-Sigyn?!

Sigyn:
And why exactly did you not attend my and Hodr's wedding?

Rygart:
I was busy with... a whole lot of things.

Sigyn:
What could be more important than the wedding of a close friend?

Rygart:
There were lots of things to do!
Like the harvest.

Sigyn:
Don't tell me that you haven't grown to hate us all of a sudden.

Rygart:
Of course not!
Yeesh... So this is the welcome I get after four years being away?

Sigyn:
I'm so happy to see you, Rygart.

Nile:
Queen Sigyn, smiling?
Who is that guy?

Narvi:
A friend from Queen Sigyn and His Majesty's school days, apparently.

Loggin:
The incompetent, eh?
They say the chances of being born like that are one in a million.

Narvi:
Makes you wonder how he's lived this long with no magic, huh?

Nile:
Why would His Majesty summon someone like that?
I don't get it.

Narvi:
Maybe he wants to reminisce about old times.


Baldr:
King Hodr. I've brought My. Rygart.

Rygart:
Huh?

Hodr:
Hey. So, you made it.
This is a nice chair, huh?

Rygart:
Hodr...
As his wife, and a citizen, what do you think about our king not liking his throne?

Hodr:
I heard that, you ignoramus.
The penalty for insulting your king... is death.

Rygart:
Ugh. I obey your Majesty's summons and spend five days getting all the way here to the capital, and this is what I get?
Haha. Gram's gotten bigger, huh?

Hodr:
Thank you so much for coming, Rygart.

Sigyn:
Still, if you're gonna call me here, at least write what it's all about!
Are you holding a reunion of the four problem children of Assam National Military Academy's 24th term?

Baldr:
Problem children?

Rygart:
Yup!
The crown prince who doesn't wanna ascend the throne and always stares up at the sky, trying to get failing grades...
The mad scientist who'd go three days without eating or drinking, locked up in the laboratory...

Sigyn:
The king of makeup tests!

Hodr:
Hahaha...

Rygart:
Then that just leaves Straight-Laced Zess.
You called him too, right?
Huh?

Baldr:
You don't know?

Rygart:
Huh?

Sigyn:
One month ago, there was a vicious coup d'etat in the land of Assam.
The nation of Athens and Orlando both staged military interventions, and Athens won.
Put simply, Assam is no longer a neutral nation: it's part of the Commonwealth of Athens.

Rygart:
So, our neighboring countries went to war and I didn't even know about it?

Hodr:
This goes beyond our neighboring countries.
And... you should be aware this hasn't been publicly disclosed.
Our Krisna Army is currently engaged in battle with the Athens Commonwealth at the border.
Fort Mizoram's defenses are strong, but we've received word that a few troops have made it through the great canyon to the north.
And their commanding officer is Zess.

Rygart:
It's Zess?!
But that's impossible!
It's true that Zess is from Athens, and he's one of the most gifted Golem pilots.
But he hated war more than anyone of us!
He enlisted in the military because he said he wanted to help stop his brother, Athens' supreme commander, right?

Hodr:
Fort Mizoram is holding out well, but... it's only a matter of time before the final defensive line is penetrated.
Huh? What is it?

Rygart:
Thanks for the valuable info.
I'm gonna grab my brother and head for the mountains before all of Krisna becomes a battlefield.

Man:
You would flee?!
You're worthless coward!

Hodr:
Shut up!

Man:
Um...

Rygart:
Hodr...

Hodr:
My dear friend, won't you lend us your strength?

Rygart:
You remember, right?
I can't even shoot a rifle.

Hodr:
Come with me.

Baldr:
Queen Sigyn.
His Majesty seems to have great trust in that man, but who is he exactly?

Sigyn:
He's just a very good friend from our school days.

Baldr:
May be. He cannot simply be a fellow student.

Sigyn:
No.
He's the one man who could stop fights between
the brother of commander-in-chief of a great military country and a certain crown prince.
He's a strange man.

Baldr:
A strange man...

Sigyn:
Yes.
