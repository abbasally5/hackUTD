Jet:
Hey, Spike!

Spike:
Huh?

Jet:
It's ready!

Spike:
I'm just about finished.
What's cooking?

Jet:
Special "bell peppers and beef."

Asimov Solensan.
He's our next target.

Spike:
Ah, listen, Jet...

Jet:
This guy's a major player in the syndicate, who operates all around the steroids.

Spike:
You said "bell peppers and beef."

Jet:
His name's Asimov Solensan.
Are you listening to me?

Spike:
There's no beef in here.
So, you wouldn't really call it "bell peppers and beef" now, would you?

Jet:
Yes, I would.

Spike:
Well, it's not!

Jet:
It is when you're broke, all right?

Spike:
What happened to the million woolong reward we got for that last guy?

Jet:
The repair bill for the cruiser you wrecked... and the one from the shop you trashed... and the medical bill from the cop you injured... killed the dough!
Now, three days ago, there was a big shootout between his group and a rival syndicate.
He killed his own guy, then took off like the wind.
Word is he's hiding out with some sweet thing in Tijuana.

Spike:
T.J. that place is for small fries.

Jet:
Yeah, well, this small fry's worth two half million.

Spike:
I don't feel like it.

Jet:
Speaking of beef, they say in T.J.
The garnitas are out of this world.

Narrator:
Attention, please.
We will be arriving at the destination gate.
:
:

Jet:
I'll head over there after I hit up the cops for some clues.

Spike:
All right.
Then I'll check in with old man bull.

Jet:
You think you can trust that old codger?

Nice turn, real easy.

Guy:
Thief!

Man1:
This again? Son of a bitch.
Taking my money like that, you cheating dogs.
Why, the only reason you can even live here is 'cause of what I've done.
I busted my tail to dig that gate.

Man2:
For criminy's sakes, you always say the same thing when you're losing.
We all dug that gate together, and you know it.

Man3:
Yeah, we did.
We worked like there was no tomorrow.

Man1:
And what have we got to show for it?!

Man2:
Huh?

Asimov:
Gimme a beer.

Katerina:
And I'll have a Bloody Mary in fact, make it a double.

Bartender:
I've got the vodka, but I'm afraid I'm fresh out of tomato juice.

Asimov
I'm sure there's one can in the back room.

Bartender:
I'll check.

Asimov:
Cream of Red-Eye.
You're a buyer, you know the score.
Check it out.

Bartender:
Is that real Bloody-Eye?

Men:
Ohh....

Bartender:
I'm gonna need a little proof.
Let's have a demonstration.

Asimov:
Ahh!
Yeah, keep those eyes open.

Bartender:
Urgh!


Spike:
This is real mystic and all, but, uh, do you have anything to eat here?
I see...

Augur:
The red-eyed coyote will appear in the zona norte at the far end of town.
That is what I see.

Spike:
A red-eyed coyote north of town?

Augur:
You, Swimming Bird.

Spike:
Huh?

Augur:
The swimming bird will meet a woman.
The bird will be hunted by this woman, and then death.

Spike:
One more time.

Augur:
What's that?

Spike:
I was killed once before by a woman.

Augur:
You take women too lightly, my friend.

Spike:
On the contrary. Catch you later.

Augur:
Wakantanka, guide his spirit.


Jet:
Presidente, eh?
Think I'll have some, on the house.
Hm?

Guy1:
Huh?

Guy2:
Damn.
Just look at this. Asimov went berserk.

Guy1:
No joke.
We gotta take care of him before the cops move in.

Guy2:
Maybe we should just let the cops deal with him.
As long as he's using that Red-Eye on himself, you can't beat him.

Guy1:
We've got to.
If we don't get that Bloody-Eye back, trust me, we'll all be twisting in the wind.

Guy2:
Maybe so, huh?

Jet:
You.

Guy1:
Huh? Ugh!

Jet:
Tell me some more.


Spike:
I am starving.
Hmm? So you're hungry, too, huh, baby?

Asimov:
Huh?

Spike:
You know, it's better to just leave the water running.
So you don't clog the drain.

-- Eye Catch --

Katerina:
Ah!

Spike:
Oops.

Katerina:
Sorry.
Oh, thank you. Uh...
Excuse me!

Spike:
Hmm?
It's your hot dog.

Katerina:
Yeah, I can see that. Just keep it.

Spike:
Heh heh. Sorry.
My stomach just took over my brain.
It does that sometimes.

Katerina:
Really?

Nice ship.

Spike:
Yeah, it's a blast from the past.
I've had it for ten years.

Katerina:
It looks like it's been around.

Spike:
Guess you could say we've done some traveling.
I'm actually a traveling performer.

Katerina:
I can't tell when you're joking and when you're not.

Spike:
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

Katerina:
Ever been to Mars?

Spike:
I was born on Mars.

Katerina:
I hear they have everything there, not like here.
There's parks and festivals, and the people are happy there.
It must be a great place to live.

Spike:
Sure, if you're rich.

Katerina:
Then I'm sure we will be quite happy.

Spike:
Planning to escape to Mars, huh?

Katerina:
Huh?

Spike:
Go ahead and run.
How far do you think you'll get?

Katerina:
Who are you?

Spike:
I'm just an old-fashioned cowboy.

Katerina:
You're a bounty hunter.

Spike:
Yeah, that's right.

Katerina:
And you are after us.

Spike:
Your boyfriend is sick.
He's a small fry.
I don't bother with his type.

Katerina:
A wise decision.

Spike:
Ack! Ugh!

Asimov:
Now, who's the small fry?

Spike:
Uh...

Asimov:
Yeah.

Katerina:
Asimov, that's enough. Let him go.

Spike:
Uhh.

Katerina:
Adios, cowboy.


Asimov:
Why did you stop me?

Katerina:
Huh?

Asimov:
He would've been dead in another minute.
I wanted to see him die.

Katerina:
Asimov, please. this has to stop.

Asimov:
I think you liked him, didn't you?

Katerina:
You left me there for so long, Asimov.
I was just waiting for you to pick me up.
Let's go, Asimov, like you promised.
I want to get out of this life.
I know that I can be happy on Mars.


Jet:
Having ourselves a little nap, huh?

Spike:
I had a sweet dream.

Jet:
That's heartwarming.
And you can go right ahead and finish your dream back on the Bebop.
I'm cashing in my chips on this one.
It's impossible to catch the guy.
There's no way to win it.
When Asimov left his syndicate, he snuck some stuff out with him.
Serious brew. This stuff's a total mind-frag.
It's a new kind of eye spray the syndicate cooked up.
Very pure. Takes two months to make one vial.
Our boy took off with every drop, which made him rather unpopular.
They keep sending hit teams after him, but all they get back are corpses.
Seems Asimov's been pumping up by doing the stuff himself.
It's called Bloody-Eye.

Spike:
No, kidding.
You know they're planning to go to Mars?

Jet:
Mars?

Spike:
But before that, they've gotta sell these.

Jet:
Is that what I think it is?

Spike:
Yeah. I grabbed it out of his pocket.

Jet:
You... met him?

Spike:
Yeah, so to speak.

Jet:
He nailed you, huh?

Spike:
The red-eyed coyote will appear in the zona norte at the far end of town.

Man1:
This again? Damn son of a bitch.
Taking my money like that, you cheating dogs.
Why, the only reason you can even live here is 'cause of what I've done.
I busted my tail to plant those crops along with my two good buddies.

Man2:
We're the buddies you're talking about.

Man3:
Yeah, sure. that we are.
We planted those seeds like there was no tomorrow.

Man2:
You were always planting seeds of a different kind, though.

Man1:
Huh?

Asimov:
So, do you have any Bloody Marys?

Spike:
I only have beer.

Asimov:
I got tomato juice.

Spike:
How much?

Asimov:
30 Million woolongs for fifty packs.

Spike:
15 Million woolongs.

Asimov:
I'm in a hurry. I've got other customers.

Spike:
Show me.

Asimov:
Huh?

Spike:
Looking for this?
Do you know how much you're worth?

Asimov:
What?

Spike:
2.5 Million woolongs. That's your bounty.
I said you were a small fry.
You look surprised.

Asimov:
You look ridiculous in that outfit.
I thought you weren't after my bounty.

Spike:
There's no thrill in the cheap ones, Asimov, you know?

Asimov:
I think you do better as a thief, bounty boy.
Now, hand it over.

Spike:
Glad to.
I have to pay you back, don't I?

Spike:
You trust your eyes too much, Asimov.
You're not a chameleon, you know.
Can't see everywhere at once.

Asimov:
Let's go!

Man:
Over there!

Man:
Follow her!

Katerina:
Don't move!
I don't want to hurt you.
Ah!

Asimov:
Idiot!
If we lose these things, we're fragged.
Do you understand?


Jet:
How're you doing, kid?

Spike:
What? You're late, Jet! Huh?
Damn!

Katerina:
Asimov.

Katerina:
Stop it, please!
That stuff is going to kill you!
No!

Asimov:
Aah!

Katerina:
We will never get out of here now.
I'll never see Mars.

Adios...


Jet:
Hey, spike. get it while it's hot, buddy.
Huh?
It's ready.

Spike:
What is it?

Jet:
Special "bell peppers and beef."
