Maiku:
I found out about its existence when I saw the news about the UFO.

Miina:
The topic of the news wasn't at all what caught my eye.

Karen:
It was the strangely familiar scenery that was shown on the TV.

Maiku:
That house, which I only knew from that photograph.

Miina:
That house, which looked exactly like in the photograph.

Karen:
That was the house that was shown on the screen.

Maiku:
I wanted it to be some beginning

Miina:
I wanted to cling onto it.

Karen:
I wanted to find my memories.

Maiku:
So...

Miina:
So...

Karen:
So...

-- OP --

Answering machine:
Hi, this is Maiku Kamishiro.
I'm not home right now.
Please leave a message if you have one after the beep and I'll get back to you.
For matters concerning programs, you can also reach me by fax or e-mail.


Announcer:
We are now approaching Inao station.
The exit is the door furthest forward in the first car.
The second car to the rear of the tran will not open its doors on this stop.
Please exit from the frontmost door.

Karen:
Eyes the same color as mine...
Nyu...

Miina:
Ah! Help me!

Maiku:
Hm?

Miina:
No, I don't want to! Stop it!

Guy:
Come on, don't make a big deal out of it.

Miina:
He's trying to rape me!

Guy:
Hey! Oh, what're you doing, you idiot?!
My car!

Miina:
You... You pervert!

Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen, we are now arriving at Inao station.
Please exit from the door furthest forward in the first car.

Maiku:
The west beach exit?
You're almost there already.
That guy tricked you, huh.
That was pretty unfortunate for you, but it's too bad you had to go through it.
So, what are you doing around here?
It's not a holiday.
Are you in the middle of trying to find yourself by hitchhiking around the country or something?

Miina:
No.

Maiku:
Then what?

Miina:
Something much more desperate.

Maiku:
Oh, sorry.

Miina:
Hm? We have the same color eyes.

Maiku:
Oh, yeah...
Are color contacts really popular?

Miina:
I was born with this color.

Maiku:
Really? Well, so was I.

Miina:
Is that so?

Maiku:
Hey, you don't have to get so close.

Miina:
Hm.
I didn't mean it that way, you know.
I... uh...

Maiku:
Yeah, I know... But...
Whoa... Oh, no!


Maiku:
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am.

Mizuho:
Hm, Kamishiro, you've been tardy a lot lately.
Seven times this month.
Now, don't you think that's a bit much?

Maiku:
There's a lot going on in my life right now.

Mizuho:
I've got a lot going on, too.

Maiku:
I guess that's true.

Mizuho:
You find it hard living all alone?
It must be quite inconvenient.

Maiku:
That's not what I meant.
All of my stuff's unpacked, and the living conditions at my home are starting to become normal.

Mizuho:
Hmm. Are you eating?

Maiku:
I'm getting by.

Mizuho:
Aren't you eating out all the time?
I know, yeah. Why don't I make you dinner tonight?

Maiku:
No, it would just inconvenience for your husband.

Kei:
Achoo!

Maiku:
Anyway, thanks for the offer.
I promise that I'll do better tomorrow.

Mizuho:
But Kamishiro..

Maiku:
Please excuse me, ma'am.
Ahh... phew.

Tsubaki:
So, Maiku, did you know that commuting here by motorcycle is violation of school rules?

Maiku:
Yes, Senpai.

Tsubaki:
If you're going to hide it, just put it where it's not so easy to find next time.

Maiku:
Could we keep this quiet? Huh?

Tsubaki:
O-Of course.

Maiku:
Ha, that's a big help.

Tsubaki:
Mm, I have a favor to ask.

Maiku:
It figures.

Tsubaki:
You're a lifesaver.

Maiku:
And these are...

Tsubaki:
Documents used to decide all the clubs' budgets for this term.

Maiku:
Wait. You don't mean...

Tsubaki:
Yeah. I'm trusting you with it.

Maiku:
Ah...
Don't you think it's just a bit too much for this to be part of the deal?

Tsubaki:
Okay. I'll throw in two weeks of lunches made by me.
How's that?
Or you can take me out on a date.

Maiku:
Take you out?

Tsubaki:
Which will it be?

Maiku:
Which will it be?
If you don't mind, I'm gonna take the lunches.

Tsubaki:
Huh...

Ichigo:
You've been shot down.

Tsubaki:
Ah! P-President!

Ichigo:
So, he's Maiku Kamishiro, the one you've been after.
The fresh man with deep blue eyes.
One of his parents was a foreigner.
He lives all alone in a house he rents.
He earns his money as a programmer working from home.
He's focused on work but go to school.
And he has no particular girlfriend.
Right?

Tsubaki:
You know a lot!

Ichigo:
And now I know he commutes by motorcycle.

Tsubaki:
Oh, please be quiet about that.

Ichigo:
Because you're... in love.

Tsubaki:
Oh, no! Nothing like that!
See, he's a brilliant boy, and I thought...
I thought that he would make a great addition to our student council.

Ichigo:
Hehehe...

Tsubaki:
Could you please stop that strange chuckle?
It's kind of weird.

Ichigo:
Hehehe...

Tsubaki:
Ugh...


Marie:
Na? Na, na na... Na...

Karen:
Huh?
Oh, a little wonder!

Marie:
Na na!

Karen:
Would you like to have a Prech?

Marie:
Na!

Karen:
You don't want one?

Marie:
Na...

Maiku:
Yeah, yeah...
Kamishiro here.

Kikuchi:
Hello, this is Kikuchi from I & D.

Maiku:
Oh, yeah, hi. How come you're calling?
I thought I still had a bit of time before the deadline.
Are there changes in the specifications?

Kikuchi:
I really hate to do this to you.
But it's the deadline.

Maiku:
What? The deadline? No way!
You're not gonna tell me it's the end of this week or something, are you?

Kikuchi:
Ah, that's exactly it!

Maiku:
You're ruthless!

Kikuchi:
Oh please!
You signed a lucrative programming contract with us, right?
And you can live alone thanks to the advance payments from that contract?

Maiku:
All right, it's fine.
I'll do it.

Kikuchi:
I knew you would, Maiku!
Love ya!

Maiku:
That's one love that'll never bear fruit.
Geez, all they do is take advantage of me.
Great. What is it now?
Yeah, yeah...
Yes, what can I do for you?

Miina:
Ah!

Maiku:
Uh, you're...

Miina:
What a coincidence!
Why are you here?

Maiku:
Why? Because this is my house.

Miina:
Hm? Really?

Maiku:
Really.
So, what is it you want?

Miina:
This has got to be fate!
Have you seen this photograph before?

Maiku:
How did you get this picture?

Miina:
So, it's true after all, huh?

Maiku:
What?
What're you talking about?

Miina:
There really was one, and I really met him!
I can't believe it.

Maiku:
Impossible.

Miina:
Hello, I'm Miina Miyafuji!

Maiku:
I'm... I'm Maiku Kamishiro.

Miina:
You're Maiku?

Maiku:
Yeah.

Miina:
Nice to meet you!
I know you've never heard of me but I'm actually a blood relative!

Maiku:
Uh...

Miina:
Isn't it wonderful?
You and I are twins!

Maiku:
Twins with me?
You're my sister?

Miina:
Yup!

Maiku:
I hate pranks like that!

Miina:
But it's true!
Hey! Open the door!


Maiku:
See, here it is. I have the same photo.

Miina:
Hmm... I heard that was all I had with me when I was adopted.

Maiku:
Hmm...
So, I guess that means...
Looking at this gender-wise, this must be me.

Miina:
And the other one is me.

Maiku:
Hm, I see.

Miina:
You understand now?

Maiku:
Mm-hm. Yeah, I understand.
But I still don't know it's true.
It's just one little photograph..

Miina:
But we have the same color eyes.

Maiku:
Yeah, can't deny that.
Wait. Regardless of all that, how come you suddenly decided to show up now?

Miina:
Because of the news report I saw two years ago on TV.

Maiku:
You mean the one about all the UFOs?

Miina:
Yeah.
The house I was born in and I've been looking for this whole time was on it.
So, I was finally able to save enough money, and here I am.
Oh?

Maiku:
Yeah, same here.

Miina:
Uh... Um... I can take a little look around the house, right?

Maiku:
Yeah. There's nothing in it, but go right ahead.
Ah...
You know, this house was all tattered when I got it.
Of course thanks to that, the rent was really cheap.
It took me two months to fix it up.
This is the only room I'm using at the moment.

Miina:
Hmm...
So, Um...

Maiku:
What is it?

Miina:
Can I look at the room over there?

Maiku:
Sure.

Miina:
Hahaha.
It's so spacious in here!
And I can't believe how clean it is.

Maiku:
I don't have furniture yet, but I'm planning on making this the guest room when I get some.

Miina:
This might be just right.

Maiku:
What're you talking about?
Ugh!
Why are you putting your stuff down there?

Miina:
Hmm, I felt like it.

Maiku:
That looks like it's kind of heavy.

Miina:
It's got all my stuff in it
I will bet it's inconvenient for a boy to live alone, isn't it?

Maiku:
Not really.

Miina:
Come on, it's not?

Maiku:
Not really.

Miina:
But it is!

Maiku:
Hmpf. Don't make assumptions.

Miina:
You know,
I'm good at lots of stuff... like cooking... and cleaning up.
And I'm more reliable than I look.
I'm just trying to appeal to you, all right?

Maiku:
Well, you don't appeal to me, but you're planning on living here, don't you?

Miina:
Mm-hm.

Maiku:
No way.

Miina:
It's all right. You and I are family, twins, remember?

Maiku:
Look, no offense meant, but we really don't know if that's true or not, okay?

Miina:
If you're gonna say that, I can say the same thing.
I really don't know whether or not you're my relative.
Not for sure.

Maiku:
There's no way to know.
I was abandoned right after birth.
My birth certificate and my profile was made up when I was found.

Miina:
Basically, I can say the same thing.

Maiku:
That's all the more reason why we can't be living under one roof.
Now listen, try to understand this house belongs to me.
It belongs to me 'cause I pay the rent because it is my home.

Miina:
Yeah, but... this is the house I was born in.
I feel the same way as you do.
There's the photograph.
I grew up my whole life looking at it.
This is... This is my house, too.
If I'm a child of this house, I should have a right to live here, shouldn't I?
I'm sorry, I know this is reckless.
But I'm just feeling sort of desperate.

Maiku:
Wow...
Hm?

Miina:
Good enough to be the deciding factor?

Maiku:
Hmm...
I'm thinking about it.
So, uh, where have you been living until now?

Miina:
I lived in foster homes.

Maiku:
You lived in there all your life?

Miina:
Someone did tried to adopt me somewhere in all those years.
But... a lot of things happened.

Maiku:
Of course.
A lot of things are expected to happen when your parents abandon you.
I had a lot of things happen, too.

Miina:
But don't you think you're pretty amazing considering?

Maiku:
What's so amazing about me?

Miina:
For one thing, you're renting this house and everything.

Maiku:
Yeah, well.
It's no big deal. I work as a programmer.

Miina:
What? You mean computers?
Is is shady work? Is is porn?

Maiku:
No, you idiot!
It's legitimate work.
I studied my ass off for this job, so I can rent this house and live on my own.

Maiku:
Hm, what am I gonna do?
Am I gonna let her live here?
This is just too surreal.
I'm barely making enough money to live alone.
But, if she really is my twin sister...

You know, I was just thinking...

Miina:
Yes.

Maiku:
Ugh...

Miina:
I hope you don't mind, I went ahead and bathed first.

Maiku:
I don't care about that.
It's how you dressed.

Miina:
Oh, sorry.
You know, since we are twins, I don't mind if you see me.

Maiku:
Even twins don't show the bodies to each other, okay?

Miina:
Oh, so that means you're finally starting to believe me?

Maiku:
No, it doesn't!

Miina:
Hmm...
They really are. We got the same eye color.

Maiku:
Well, yeah.

Miina:
Please... let me stay here.

Maiku:
Damn. She's wrecking my usual pace.
Ugh. She's already invading.

Miina:
Hello.
Would you like me to scrape down your back?

Maiku:
I'm fine.

Miina:
Since you're letting me stay, I have to provide extra service.

Maiku:
I didn't say you could stay! You got that?!

Miina:
Yeah.

Maiku:
Man, what is that girl thinking?

Miina:
Bah! Huh...
Coming!

Maiku:
Idiot! Don't answer the front door!
All right.
What do you think you're doing?

Miina:
Oh, you're soaking wet!

Maiku:
I don't care about that, okay?
Just don't answer the door.

Miina:
How come?

Maiku:
Because what if it was someone from school, I'd have a big problem.

Miina:
But it would be all right. We're twins.

Maiku:
Oh, yeah. How are you gonna prove it?

Miina:
But we can't!

Maiku:
Uh, sorry.

Miina:
It fell.

Maiku:
What did?

Miina:
The towel.

Maiku:
Don't stare at me like that!
Just let me take care of this.
You stay back there.

Miina:
Okay. But try not to drop your towel!

Maiku:
Ah, shut up!
Hello there. Who is it?
If you're selling newspaper subscriptions, I'm not interested.
Also... I'm not interested in opening the door to any girls who come here so they can barge in, take bath and claim this is their home.

Miina:
Bah!

Karen:
So, I came here for nothing?

Maiku:
Ah?

Miina:
Ah?

Karen:
You see, I-I believe that this is my house...

Miina:
W-Wait a minute, what does that mean?

Maiku:
Hey, don't open the door!

Miina:
But...

Maiku, Miina:
Huh?

Karen:
Uh...

Miina:
Her eyes. Oh, wow, look!
They're the same.
But how? I don't get it.

Karen:
Ah.

Marie:
Na na!

Karen:
Nyu...

Miina:
Ahh!

Maiku:
Erh!
It's not what you think.
Look, I don't want any misunderstandings.

Karen:
Nyu...

Miina, Maiku:
Nyu?

Karen:
Nyu...

Maiku:
Ah! She fainted!

Karen:
Nyu...

Miina:
All right.
You bring her in!
And I'll go spread out the futon!

Maiku:
H-Hey!

Miina:
By the way, where is the futon?

Maiku:
Never mind that!
Would you listen?!

Miina:
Miina Miyafuji.

Maiku:
Maiku Kamishiro.

Karen:
Karen Onodera.

Maiku:
It's about to begin.

Miina:
Right here in our house.

Karen:
Our very own summer.
