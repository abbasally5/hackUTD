女子になったはずむが、やす菜に再度告白するところ


Hazumu:
Good morning.

Yasuna:
Hazumu.

Hazumu:
Sorry to surprise you like this.
I just wanted to give you this.

Yasuna:
For me?

Hazumu:
Here!

Yasuna...
I thought about it a lot, and I... I really want to tell you how I truly feel.
Ready?
I wanna be friends with you, Yasuna.

Yasuna:
What?

Hazumu:
It sounds weird for me to say this after you turned me down, doesn't it?
But... that time when I woke up just after becoming a girl, I was really happy to see you and Tomari in front of me.
My heart felt really warm... and I felt comfortable.
I wasn't scared at all.

Yasuna:
Oh, Hazumu.

Hazumu:
So, that is why I couldn't just keep ignoring you.
I didn't want to be separated from you.
That's all.

Yasuna:
But I... But I hurt your feelings.
I knew how you felt for a long time.
I knew how you felt from the very beginning.

Hazumu:
It's not your fault, Yasuna.
I did this on my own without thinking about your feelings.

Yasuna:
It's not that.

Hazumu:
What?

Yasuna:
I was happy... when you said you liked me.
But... I couldn't accept it.
I was scared.
I didn't have the courage.
As a result, I ended up hurting you... and in that accident.

Hazumu:
Then we definitely can't keep going on like this.

Yasuna:
What?

Hazumu:
But I'm a girl now, so I think we can be friends, can we?
We'll be just friends.

Yasuna:
But I...
I don't know if... uh...
Are you sure?

Hazumu:
I'm the one who's asking you.
So, will you take this?



Episode 4 part B
やす菜からはずむへの告白


Yasuna:
Hazumu, do you remember?

Hazumu:
What?

Yasuna:
The time when we first entered school.
Back then, this place used to be a desolate roof with a tiny flower bed.
You can see this place clearly from the music room.
One day during practice, I noticed something.
The place is getting greener every day.
Someone is making the flower bed bigger.
I was watching all the time.
I was watching that person as the leaves turned color from one season to another.
And that person was you, Hazumu.
You have the power to make this world a beautiful place.
I thought you had the most beautiful heart... and soul.

Hazumu:
That's not true, Yasuna.

Yasuna:
Hazumu...

Hazumu:
What?
Um, what is it?

Yasuna:
There's something that I wanna tell you.

Hazumu:
Huh?

Yasuna:
I know this may sound crazy to you.
I also know that I don't have the right to say such a thing.

Hazumu:
Yasuna...

Yasuna:
But last night... well, I've been thinking about it for a long time.
I was thinking about you.
It's just that I love you, Hazumu!

Hazumu:
Uh...
But I'm already a...

Yasuna, Hazumu:
Ah!

Tomari:
Hazumu!

Hazumu:
Where are you going?
Tomari?



Episode 5 part B
やす菜からはずむへのキス


Hazumu:
Yasuna.

Yasuna:
Uh.

Hazumu:
Do you wanna go home together?
Tomari has extra classes, so I'm all alone.
Yeah.
Flowers...
Summer is almost here.

Yasuna:
Tomari was right.

Hazumu:
Hm?

Yasuna:
I'm sorry but I shouldn't stay by your side, Hazumu.

Hazumu:
Don't go, Yasuna.

Yasuna:
I'm really sorry.

Hazumu:
Wait!
I want to tell you something about yourself...
I saw your drawing from last year's sketching contest.
And I was very confused.
Then I realized something; I don't know anything.
The truth is I really don't know anything about you, Yasuna.
So now, I want you to tell me.

Yasuna:
Hazumu.
You are going to think I'm crazy.
But I... I cannot see men.

Hazumu:
What do you... What do you mean by that?

Yasuna:
Well, first it was my father.

I'm so sorry, Dad.
But it wasn't me.
It was Fermata.

Ever since I can remember...
They suddenly disappeared.
I can only sense their presence.
Then I couldn't understand anything anymore.
Men completely disappeared from my world.
No matter how hard I try, I can only see their dim shape.

Hazumu:
Uh.

Yasuna:
There were times when people misunderstood me... because I couldn't tell who was a boy.
I hurt many people's feelings without being aware of it.
That's why... I decided to live on my own.
If I don't become friendly with anyone, then I can't hurt anyone.
That's what I thought.
But you appeared before me.
You were a boy, but I could see you.
Really see you.

Hazumu:
Sorry I'm late.
Today's really hot, you guys must be really thirsty.

Yasuna:
Uh... A boy...
I can see him.
I was surprised.
No, it wasn't just that.
My whole world was about to change.
It was revolutionary.
But I was also scared.
I was afraid that you'd eventually become invisible like my father.
That you'd disappear from my life.
That's why...
I'm sorry!
I regret doing that.
It was painful and tough.
I thought my heart would explode.
I blamed myself. I blamed myself for leaving you...
You tried to stay there by my side...
Why was I scared?
Then you came back to me... as a girl who will never disappear from my sight.

Hazumu:
Yasuna.

Yasuna:
Now you know what?
I hurt you to suit my own convenience.
But now you're a girl, I'm trying to go after you.
I'm mean and selfish.
But I want you to believe me.
I mean, even when you were a boy...
No... I've always liked you from the very first moment that I met you.
You were the only one in my heart.
Uh, I'm sorry!
Uh, I know I shouldn't be by your side, but... I don't know what to do anymore.
I don't know what to do.

Hazumu:
Don't go!

Tomari:
Uh... Hmm...

Hazumu:
Yasuna was always so lonely.
But I... I didn't even realize her pain and despair.
But Yasuna really needed me.

Hazumu:
You came back.
Huh?

Yasuna:
Now, you know...

Hazumu:
Uh...
What are you doing?

Yasuna:
Listen. I don't want any regrets.

Hazumu:
Uh...
I have to accept her feelings.
She's been hurt way too many times.
