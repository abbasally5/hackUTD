Kaoru:
Drink this and try to cheer up.

Aoi:
All right...

Kaoru:
Having her come up here is fine and all, but what can I say to her in a situation like this.
Um, are you okay?
All I can do is feel sorry for her.
I wanna help her somehow.
Excuse me, but don't you have any other clues that you can use?

Aoi:
A photograph of myself and him.

Kaoru:
But it's a childhood picture.
Hm? Hey, haven't I seen this somewhere?
Isn't this me and Aoi-chan?

Aoi:
Huh? What was that?

Kaoru:
I said... th-this was a photo of Aoi-chan and me...

Aoi:
Then, that means... that you are... Kaoru-sama?

Kaoru:
Yeah. I'm Kaoru Hanabishi.

Kaoru(Child):
Aoi-chan, it'll be all right.
It'll be all right.

Kaoru:
It'll be all right.

Aoi:
Oh... Kaoru-sama! Kaoru-sama! Kaoru-sama! Kaoru-sama!
For eighteen years, I have been waiting patiently for this moment!

Kaoru:
Eighteen years?

Aoi:
To think that the person who was so kind to me was you.
I have never felt the force called destiny more strongly than now!

Kaoru:
H-Hold on a minute. Calm down.
I think I need an explanation.

Aoi:
I apologize.
In short, I, Aoi Sakuraba, have come with the intention of becoming your wife.

Kaoru:
Huh? Wife?!

Aoi:
Yes! I am to become your wife, Kaoru-sama.

Kaoru:
I-It's true that I remember you now, Aoi-chan.
But you becoming my wife...

Aoi:
The dream that I had for all of my life is finally coming true.
Come, let us return to the Hanabishi family together.

Kaoru:
Hanabishi...

Aoi:
Once you return to them, you and I can be together.

Kaoru:
I see. That's what it is.

Aoi:
Kaoru-sama?

Kaoru:
If they want me back in Hanabishi, they can come straight to me.
Trying to lure me back using a girl.
I trust them even less after this.

Aoi:
Kaoru-sama?

Kaoru:
Aoi-chan, I won't go back to Hanabishi.
I'm sorry, but please leave now!

Aoi:
K-Kaoru-sama...
