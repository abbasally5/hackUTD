You sit proudly in this cave, like a Queen of Egypt.
In my service to you, I shall never know rest.
To prove my devotion, I have stolen this ostentatious offering.
But I'll show you things that your dark blue eyes haven't seen, smiles like a lake in the sun, blossoming like a water lotus.
You sit upon your great throne inscribed with a lion's head, skin bathed in ebony light.
At times, Iâ€™ll raise a lamp, and take my place at your feet.
This pendant releases the light of Sirius, which your eyes will never behold.
One who does not live for my sake, a child of this country, will bear this fire within, and herself will become frozen as northern ice.
