FLAG 2: Problem Solved by the Fist


Keima:
You seem to be struggling.

Kusunoki:
Shut up!

Keima:
If you'd like, I can tell you the way to beat her.

Kusunoki:
What?

Keima:
And it'd only take a moment.

Kusunoki:
No, thank you!
I can handle this battle on my own.

Keima:
It's very simple.

Kusunoki 2:
Huh?

Kusunoki:
Wh-Wh-Wh-What the heck is this?!

Keima:
Do you really need to fight her?
I mean really?
Why don't you just accept her for who she is?
Maybe you should simply become a feminine, strong, and super cute martial artist.
Ow!

Kusunoki:
Don't make it sound so easy!
You don't respect the martial arts.
How can I become strong if I waste time being a girl?!

Kusunoki 2:
That's right, Kusunoki.
Don't fall for this gamer's sweet talk.
I will devote myself to being a woman.
No time to waste in the dojo!

Kusunoki:
When you devote yourself to one path...

Kusunoki 2:
You must sacrifice the one for the other.

Keima:
What? So, you can't do both?
You're a big talker, but you can't deliver.

Kusunokis:
Can't what?

Keima:
Ah!
Lots of things out there are both strong and cute.
Such as cats.
Cats are fearsome hunters that prey on mice.

Kusunoki:
Human beings are nothing like cats at all!

Kusunoki 2:
Yeah!
Don't group them together like that!

Keima:
You're wrong!
Humans also can become strong and cute as well!
Look over there!

Kusunokis:
Huh?

Elsie:
Divine One, here I go!
Don't you love it?!
This battle suite's amazing!

Keima:
Enough of that. You can go now.
Shoo. Shoo.

Elsie:
What?

Kusunoki:
This is ridiculous.
It's a waste of time to listen to your nonsense!
I won't have it anymore.

Keima:
It's not nonsense!

Kusunoki:
Huh?

Keima:
When something is gained through sacrifice, it will always feel incomplete.
Besides, why should a fondness for cats be considered weakness?
You have a chance. You can become stronger.

Kusunoki:
Uh...

Keima:
A martial artist would never impose limits on herself!
You should reach inside and seek greater strength within your heart, Captain!
Let me ask you, did you consider today's attempt at the weakest date ever a complete waste of time?

Kusunoki:
Of course I...

Kusunoki 2:
No. It wasn't a waste of time.
I had fun.

Kusunoki:
Wh-What are you saying to me?!
Are you turning on me?

Kusunoki 2:
I'm not.

Kusunoki:
Huh?

Kusunoki 2:
After all, I know that you had fun, as well.
Because I... Because I am you.

A cute and strong martial artist?
That sounds good.
However, we aren't up to the task yet.
Not quite yet.
Okay, I give up!

Kusunoki:
Huh?

Kusunoki 2:
Today was enough, for the time being.
I'll let you have your way for a while.
Once you feel that you're a strong enough martial artist, give your feminine side a heads-up.
Hehehe.

Kusunoki:
Yeah.

Kusunoki 2:
There's just one more thing before I go?

Kusunoki:
Huh?
Ah... What?
No... M-My body is moving on its own...

Kusunoki 2:
Something to remember this by.

Kusunoki:
But how... how can you be doing this without my permission?

Keima:
Captain! You're killing me! Killing me!

Kusunoki:
Ah!

Kusunoki 2:
Do you not like Katsuragi?
I know you do.




Chihiro Kosaka - 小阪 ちひろ
FLAG 7 Singing in the Rain


Keima:
Don't do it!

Chihiro:
Wh-What was that for?

Keima:
I thought you were going to jump off.

Chihiro:
As if!
Why did you come after me anyway?
I thought you just hated my guts.

Keima:
I what?
All this time I was worried about you.

Chihiro:
Really.
Well, you don't need to worry about me!
Got it?!
It's just like you said.
I don't care about anything.
I already knew that!
When it comes to school, sports, I never stand out anywhere!
No matter how hard I try, I'll always be average!
It would waste calories to be serious about life!
A total waste!

Keima:
Don't lie to me!
I know that you're struggling inside.

Chihiro:
In just what way, am I remotely struggling?

Keima:
Then why do you chase guys you don't even like?
You have an answer for that?

Chihiro:
That's because...
I tend to admire people who shine brightly.
And by admiring them, I almost feel like I'm shining with them.
Though I do feel pretty dumb sometimes.

Keima:
Seriously? You're so hopeless.

Chihiro:
I never gave you permission to stand here!

Keima:
Man, it's really coming down.

Chihiro:
I kinda...
You know, I actually thought you and I were similar in a way.
You more or less ignore reality, by running to your games.
I thought you'd be able to understand me and my feelings.

Keima:
I don't get you at all.

It's true. I've given up on the real world.
However, I haven't given up on myself.
The world doesn't get to decide, it's my life to live.
It can be boring, fun, or ordinary.
That's my decision to make.
As long as I have the will, nothing is impossible.
Similarly, you can do whatever you want!

Chihiro:
Th-That's a load of crap.
The real world has limits!
Do you think that I could become an idol, someone famous like Kanon, if I wanted to?

Keima:
It's up to you, Chihiro!

Chihiro:
Ugh...
D-Don't call me Chihiro!

Keima:
Aw!

Chihiro:
It's impossible!

Keima:
I was under the impression that you were completely normal.
But it appears that you might, in fact, have more personality than the others.
Your sharp tongue warrants a higher rating than A-rank.
I have no choice but to award an S-rank.
You were the first person to knock me down completely.

Chihiro:
That's enough!

Keima:
Ow!

Chihiro:
If I could shine like they do, I would!

Keima:
You can if you want, do you?!
The real world is nothing.
It doesn't stand a chance!

Chihiro
It doesn't matter what I try, I'll always... I'll always... I'll always be just average!

Keima:
It'll be all right.
You can do it.
You can do it, Chihiro.
And whenever you start to worry, I'll be right there to help you.

Chihiro:
I can do it... Yeah...

Keima:
Yeah.
