Manager:
Hey, there. Call it.

Gimme something.
Three peanuts.

The Clown bastards are herded out on route number 5.

Manager:
Damn it, don't scare me like that.

Manager:
How about buying something for once?
This ain't a hangout for damn street gangs.

Yamagata:

Yamagata:
I don't see how you could ride something crazy like that, man.

Tetsuo:
Huh, I could.

Kaneda:
Ha!
If you want it so bad, then steal one yourself.
