Al, okay, listen carefully.
Inside this package you'll find a full taped confession and all of the evidence.
I want to explain just why this colony has been targeted for nuclear attack.
It's important but if I die, then you take this to the police.
If you can get an adult to believe you, the colony can still be saved.
You're probably wondering why I didn't just take this to them myself.
Well, you see, you have to understand it would've been like running away.
If I ducked out of fighting now, I don't think I could ever live with myself.
It's not like I hate the Federation or anything, or that I want to avenge the captain and the others.
I'm not sure how to put it. You see, I need to fight the Gundam now.
Maybe it's because I'm a soldier. I really don't know the reason why.
Hey, Al, I'm most likely going to die. But, whatever happens, don't hate the Gundam pilot.
And don't go hate the Feddie soldiers. Because they're like us, you and me.
They're just people simply doing what they think is right, that's all.
I know that is hard. But try not to hate them. And don't blame yourself, either, okay?
Please, Al, this is all I ask. With luck, if I do manage to get out of this alive and the war ends, I'll visit you.
I'll come back to this colony. That's a promise. See you kid! Well, I guess that's it.
Take care, Al. By the way, say "hi" to Chris!
