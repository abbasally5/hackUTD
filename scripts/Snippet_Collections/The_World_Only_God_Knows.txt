FLAG 1.0 : Love Makes the World Go Round


Ayumi:
Why did you call me out here?
And what is the meaning of this?
Some kind of sick joke? Really?

Keima:
I was thinking that you'd eat it.
Then you'd do your best in the meet tomorrow.
Urgh!

Ayumi:
Have you ever seen my ankle?!
Do you think I can run in the track meet tomorrow?!
Huh...

Keima:
Sure.

Ayumi:
Huh?

Keima:
After all, it's not like you're severely injured.

Ayumi:
What are you talking about?
You've never run in a real race!
Do you even know how fast I was going?!

Keima:
You might have injured yourself if you were running at full speed.
But I noticed when you fell, your hair wasn't... your hair wasn't tied up.

Ayumi:
Uh...

Keima:
You always tied your hair up when you ran all-out.
Did you plan to trip from the very beginning of the race?

Ayumi:
It's better this way.
The upperclassmen were right.
I just happened to run really well while the coach was watching, so she put me on the team.
But I haven't been able to run well ever since.
I keep practicing and trying to, but I can't improve my time.

Elsie:
Huh?

Ayumi:
It'd be better if I weren't in the meet.
Why...?
Why can't I run anymore?
I've been practicing so hard.

Keima:
Don't worry about it so much.
Just run as quickly as your legs will carry you.
If it's ranking that you're worried about, you're already in first place... in my heart and soul.

Elsie:
Ha! Oh...

Ayumi:
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
Don't creep me out like that!
Besides, all this happened because of your stupid cheering!
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

Elsie:
Huh...

Ayumi:
Uh... Hey.

Keima:
Hm?

Ayumi:
Will you come to cheer me on tomorrow, at the meet?

Keima:
Uh... Y-Yeah...

Ayumi:
Thank you!

Keima:
Ahh!




Mio Aoyama - 青山 美生
FLAG 3.0 : Drive My Car


Mio:
Katsuragi!
Where are you, Katsuragi?!
How did he find out about this?
I've been ignoring all the invitations.

Keima:
Miss Mio.
I hope the dress is to your liking.
You see, I took delivery of selecting it myself.

Mio:
Uhh...
H-He's so cute.
I guess that clothes do make the commoner.
I-I never told you to bring me to this party!

Keima:
It must be suffocating to spend all your time in that old apartment.
I was thinking that you needed to experience real high-class events occasionally.

Mio:
Th-That's not what I was talking about!
The party is over there!
This is just the backyard!
You stupid bike-riding chauffeur!
Have you no sense of direction as well as no sense of style?!

Keima:
Well, I'm not very confident in my dancing ability.
I was hoping you might give me a few pointers first.

Mio:
Oh, really?
That you're planning to join the party?
You must be joking.
This [glamour] is a very exclusive event for the rich, famous and beautiful only.
I'll have you know I've participated a number of times.

Keima:
Oh, So you've been here before.

Mio:
But of course.
I came here with Papa many... um...
Fine.
You can hold a party here by yourself.
Though there won't be any guests, attendants, or chefs.

Elsie:
Good evening.
Would either of you like a drink?

Keima:
Hey! What's with the flashy designer dress?
You should be wearing something that won't draw attention to yourself!
You're a maid!

Elsie:
Why do I have to be a maid?
I wanna wear a beautiful designer dress!

Keima:
We aren't here to enjoy ourselves!

Mio:
Katsuragi!
Don't you want me to teach you to dance?
Come over here.
Hmpf.
I don't have time to waste on the masses so we'll do this in one minute.

Keima:
Don't ask the impossible.
Huh?

Mio:
What are you doing?
Give me a hand.
You don't know anything?
Hold my hand!

Keima:
Never mind.

Mio:
What is it?

Keima:
It's... It's just... It's nothing...

Mio:
Huh?
Holding hands isn't a big deal.
It's a natural part of dancing!

Keima:
Oh, okay then.

Mio:
Let's start.
Right, right. Then turn.

Keima:
Up, down, down, left, right...

Mio:
You're a quickly study.

Keima:
Thanks.
Still, this seems like something from a storybook.
And I'm not much for a reader.

Mio:
An average commoner's observation.
This is typical of high-society life.

Keima:
A world that has nothing to do with me.

Mio:
I've danced with Papa so many times at balls just like this.

Keima:
Huh?

Guy1:
Aren't you the Aoyamas' daughter?

Guy2:
Miss Mio, what on earth are you doing here?

Guy1:
If you're here, you should come inside with us.

Mio:
I didn't... I didn't want to come here.

Guy2:
Then, why are you here?

Guy3:
Well, in any case, I was terribly sorry to hear about Director Aoyama.
Miss Mio, I've heard that you're living with your mother in an apartment?

Guy2:
Hey, you shouldn't be so rude.

Guy3:
I'm sure you're going through a difficult period, so please help yourself to the food inside.

Guy1:
Who sent her an invitation?

Guy2:
I wouldn't have expected her to show her face.

Guy3:
She's probably just here for the food.

Keima:
Why don't you stop this?
What's the point of all clinging to this lifestyle?

Mio:
Shut up!
I'm very wealthy, I'm fabulously rich!
And you're damn poor!
Didn't you say that you would help me?!
You're not helping!

Keima:
You've done enough.
I'm sure that your father is satisfied.
You lived the way your father wanted... to preserve his memory.
That's why you pretended to still be rich and didn't burn incense for your father.
But you should... you should live your own life now and be free.

Mio:
Papa! Papa!

Papa:
Mio, you've grown a little.
You should hold your head up, as a member of the Aoyama family, and work hard.

Mio:
I know!
Because I'm Papa's daughter!

Papa:
Mio.
Mio.

Mio:
Papa... Papa is with me here right now in my heart like always.
If I live the way he wanted to, then Papa will never die!

Keima:
Wait!
Just once you smiled at me.
You never simile at people.
But just once, you looked alive!
I know it's important to respect his wishes.
However, I wanna see you smile more, and be happy.

Mio:
Yah!

Keima:
Argh!

Elsie:
Uh...

Mio:
You're con man!
You pretended to help me, but it was all a trick!
Ever since you showed up, Papa's been getting smaller...
At this rate, Papa will... Papa will really die.

Keima:
Nevertheless, I want to live in your heart!
If you don't want me, you can return to that world!
You must choose for yourself.
Decide how you will live your life!
This is all up to you.

Mio:
Papa... Papa...

Papa:
You've grown up, Mio.

Mio:
Papa...



Kanon Nakagawa - 中川かのん
FLAG 7.0 : Shining Star


Keima:
There she is!
Kanon.

Kanon:
Keima...

Keima:
What are you doing?
Don't you have a big concert at hall tonight?

Kanon:
That's right. That's right.
That's right. That's right. That's right.

Keima:
Are you afraid of becoming invisible again?
Look what's happened.
You became an idol so people would notice you.
Your songs were big hits.
Your fanbase grew.
But then, you were always worried.
If people stopped paying attention to you, stopped praising you, you'd become invisible again.

Kanon:
Th-That's right! That's right!
You really do understand me.
Oh, my gosh!
Keima, thank you.

Keima:
I-It's just a coincidence.
I happened to run into a similar story... in a game.

Kanon:
Keima, stay by my side!
Give me courage!
Watch me!
You're all I have, all I have!
I can't impress all of those people alone.
I'm going to fail this time.
I am...

Keima:
Hm?

Kanon:
But if... if you're there for me, I just know that I'll... That I'll... I'll be...

Keima:
I'm sorry I can't.

Kanon:
Ah...

Keima:
It's a cop-out.

Kanon:
Cop out?

Keima:
You need other people to validate your existence?
If that's the case, you'll just become invisible again.

Kanon:
But I... But I...

Keima:
Stop lying on others!
It isn't necessary!
Your songs... Your singing is fine the way it is.

Kanon:
It is?

Keima:
You can shine! You can simply shine on your own, Kanon!

Kanon:
I-I can't do it on my own! I...
I can't do anything alone... I can't!

Keima:
But you already have, Kanon!

Manager:
Kanon, can you hear the cheers?

Keima:
Everyone's been drawn here by your light.
I can't keep you... to myself.

Kanon:
Keima...
I would have been willing to sing just for one person alone.
Good-bye.



Shiori Shiomiya - 汐宮 栞
FLAG 11.0 : The Last Day


Keima:
Hey.

Shiori:
Huh?

Keima:
I would actually prefer for quiet places to not be taken away from me.
You have my support.

Shiori:
Katsuragi...
I said his name without screwing up.

Keima:
Urgh!

Elsie:
Divine One, are you okay?

Shiori:
Originally, I thought he was being belligerent but now he shows up here.
Who is he?
He's like a character from a fairy tale.

Keima:
Hmm....

Shiori:
H-Here...

Keima:
Thank you.

Shiori:
It's a very small homebase.

Keima:
Mm.

Shiori:
I-If you'd like...

Keima:
Don't mind me.

Shiori:
He's so rude...
Is he really here to support me?
Should I try talking to him?
But what should I say?
Um... Um...
There's nothing to talk about...
He should say something.
Why do I have to do all the worrying?
Back then, they asked me how I felt about the book, so I did my best to write down my thoughts.
That doesn't work?
If I don't say anything, no one will understand me?
Ah! I spoke out loud again!

Keima:
No, huh?

Shiori:
Um...

Keima:
Can I have some please?

Shiori:
Mm-hm, mm-hm.

Ah, the power!
Ahh!

Boss:
Hehehe.
We turned off the power and reset the password.

Girl1:
Wow, the boss is pulling out the stops.

Girl2:
You could have just gone to a teacher.

Boss:
If we bother enough teachers and faculties, the future of the media room might be adversely affected.
A lot of effort went into getting it passed.

Shiori:
Uh!
Heavy...

Keima:
It'd be pretty tragic if we ended up crushed by books.
The real world is so annoying.
I wish they'd leave me alone, all alone and in peace.

Shiori:
Yes... The real world is scary.
It's a pain to deal with other people.
Katsuragi understands...
I just want to live here forever, in the quiet solitude of the library.

Keima:
That's a lie.

Shiori:
Uh...

Keima:
I'm sorry but the truth is you want to talk to others.
That's truth.
But you're frightened... of saying something that makes them hate you.

Shiori:
E-Everybody feels that way, even you, right?

Keima:
Yeah, so, I don't give a damn about the real world.
Because I... Because I... Because I believe in my world!
What are you trying to protect?
Trying to protect your books?
That it?
Or are you trying to protect your sanctuary from the outside world?

Shiori:
No. I love... I love books.
I don't care about other people.
But I want to talk... to talk about books with other people.
I wanted to talk.
That one time. That other time. That other time.
But it's too late now.
I can't talk to anyone.
Ahhh!
It's impossible... Impossible.
I can't leave this place.
I want to live here forever.
It's scary outside.
People are scary.
Scary. Scary. Scary!
But if I had the courage...
I'm not brave enough.
I can never reach them.
My voice won't reach them...
Won't reach them...
Won't reach them!

Keima:
I'll give you the courage you need.
