  Girl A:
Is he really prince Yuki's cousin?

Girl B:
I'll bet he knows everything about him.

Kyo:
Leave me alone!

Girl C:
Amazing.

Tohru:
Poor Kyo.

Yuki:
Hey. What were you trying to prove, pulling a stunt like that? Think, if you act like an idiot, I'm the one who's going to hear about it.

Kyo:
It serves you right. Why do you wanna go to a school with all these crazy giggling girls anyway?

Yuki:
I suppose you'd prefer I [live / lived] my life in fear of being transformed. You sound like Akito. He thought I should attend an all boys academy too… which is why I came here; to get away from him, and out of that house.

Kyo:

Tohru:


Kyo:
Shut up! Who do you think you are? This is between me and him, it's got nothing to do with you. You stupid little girl! From now on, just stay the hell away from me!

Tohru:
Ok. That was maximum rage. He hates me. That's all there is to it. And he really hates me.

Yuki:
You are truly an idiot.

Kyo:
So what? You're gonna hit me now?

Yuki:
And wouldn't it hurt more if I didn't?

Tohru:
I remember when I heard the story of the zodiac animals, all I could think about was the poor cat. While all the other animals were having a wonderful time at the banquet, the cat was still lying in its bed, dreaming of a party that would never come.
I know, I won't be a dog anymore. I'll be a cat too.
And I really meant it. I wanted to show the cat that no matter what, he had a friend. I like cats so much. I know I would've been the first to join a year of the cat fan club, if there was such a thing. Now he hates me. I'm such a fool, Mom. I real fool.

Hana:
Incoming Tohru's electric signals.

Uo:


Tohru:
Oh, I can't believe I did it again. I bumped my head. That almost hurt worse than the first time. Look, I'm crying. It hurts so bad.

Uo:
I would worry. But I don't think your brain damage can get any worse.

Shigure:
So, you're home. Had enough school for one day, huh?

Kyo:
I don't wanna live in this house anymore.

Shigure:
You can train on the mountains for four months. I think you can endure more than three days here.

Kyo:

Shigure:
And by "her", I take it you mean Tohru. Let me guess, you lost your temper and you yelled at her again, right? You know you shouldn't do that if you're just going to regret it. Not too bright now, is it?

Kyo:
Save your breath. I'm just not meant to get along with other people. Period. End of story.

Shigure:
Oh sure. Some people just don't. But you're not one of them. You lack experience, that's all. For example, I'm sure you can smash this table to bits with your bare hands. But I'm equally sure you could punch the table without breaking it. And why is that? Because I know your training has taught you to control your fist. At least I should hope so after four months of fighting bears and …

Kyo:
I didn't fight bears.

Shigure:


Kyo:
It'll never happen anyway.
Shigure:

Kyo:
Ok, fine. Maybe if I meet someone with brain damage… or something.

Shigure:
That's the spirit.

Yuki:
I'm home.

Shigure:
Ah, so you are. Is Tohru not with you?
Yuki:
She had to work this evening. But she'll be done by eleven. I'm thinking about picking her up.

Shigure:
That's probably a good idea. There are some real weirdos around here.

Tohru:
Another day's work, over and done. But it's late. I wonder if anyone's still awake. I hope Kyo at least got some dinner tonight if he wasn't too angry to eat again. Maybe I could…oh but I'm probably the last person he wants to see.

Kyo:
Just stay the hell away from me!

Tohru:
No one's ever hated me before. I don't know what to do.

Tohru's mother:
Just be yourself. You'll be fine.

Tohru:


Tohru:
Kyo! He's gonna think I thought he was a stalker! Oh, but I guess I did. But I can't tell him that.
Oh, wait. I'm sorry it was an accident. I was just stretching my arm and oops! Silly how something like that happens, huh? But hey, it's nice to see you …

Kyo:
Quit babbling. If you've got something to say, say it.

Tohru:
Kyo.

Kyo:
What?

Tohru:
I don't know what to say.

Kyo:
Then don't say anything!

Tohru:
I'm sorry.

Kyo:
No, don't be. Say or don't say whatever you want. And you don't have to … you know, stay away …I … Ah, just hit me again if you're angry.

Tohru:
I think …is he…? He's trying to apologize for this morning, isn't he? Maybe that's why he came our here to meet me. So … does that mean, the other day after school, I think he was trying to apologize to me then too.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong idea. I only hit you because I thought you were a stalker.

Kyo:
Oh great.

Tohru:
So you see, it wasn't because I'm mad at you. That's not it at all. In fact, I really like you. I've always liked the cat from the zodiac. What I mean is, I hope … maybe…we can be friends?

Shigure:
Someday you're going to meet someone who truly wants to be your friend.

Kyo:
What're you suppose to be? Some year of the cat fan club? Come on, let's go back.

Tohru:
I think I understand Kyo a little bit better now. He doesn't always mean to get angry. Sometimes it's just hard for him to say how he really feels. But deep down, I believe he truly is a nice person, even though he tries to hide it most of the time.

Shigure:
Kyo, I hear you gave Tohru a little scared while you were out prowling around last night. Kyo is a stalker, Kyo is a stalker.

Kyo:
You are so full of it! And you! Next time you need someone to walk you home, don't look at me!

Tohru:
That's ok. Anyway, I'd much rather see you here at the table like this more often. I'm glad you're eating. How do you like the food?

Kyo:
What do you want?

Yuki:
Nothing.

Kyo:

Yuki:
No, just looking.
Kyo:
Well, I guess there's a first time for everything.

Tohru:
Do you like it?

Kyo:
No, I don't!

Tohru:


Kyo:
Play it with that damn Yuki. I don't wanna.

Uo:

Kyo:
Fine, I'll play your stupid game. Just don't cry when you lose, yankee.

Uo:
How about this? The loser cleans the entire classroom by himself.

Hana:
Aren't those the most wonderful signals?

Tohru:
Let's ask Yuki if he wants to play too. Yuki! Wanna play "rich man, poor man"? …you're not here.

Yuki:
I'm sorry. I'm just not ready to be in a relationship right now. So, I think it would be best if we just…

Girl A:
No, don't say it. Yuki!

Yuki:
I'm sorry.

Girl A:
It's just that you're always so nice, I... You really don't want to get close to anyone, do you, Yuki? You shut everyone out like you think you're better than they are. So what? I guess a normal girl like me just isn't good enough for you, is that it?

Kyo:
Revolution!

Uo:
You cheater! What kind of cheep-ass tricks are you trying to pull?

Kyo:
What do you mean tricks? Those are the rules.

Tohru:
Let's see. Revolution makes all high cards low, right?

Hana:
Wait. Reverse revolution.

Boy A:
Now you had it, Kyo.

Boy B:
Don't cry.

Boy D:
I really feel for you Kyo, being beat by a girl.

Kyo:
Oh, stick it! Come on, let's play again!

Girl A:
You really don't want to get close to anyone, do you, Yuki?

Yuki:
"Rich man, poor man." I know the rules but I can't say I've ever actually played the game.

Tohru:
Uo just taught me how to play not too long ago. It really is a lot of fun. You should play with us next time.

Yuki:
So, it looks like Kyo was the loser today, was he?

Tohru:
Yes, but I'll still help him clean up.

Kyo:
No, a loss is a loss.
Tohru:
You're sure?

Kyo:
Don't worry about it, I'll win next time. Just like I'll win against you!

Yuki:
Wait, wait. I think I've heard this one before.

Kyo:
No joke, asshole. I am going to beat you. That's a promise.

Yuki:
I wish you'd stop making your inferiority complex my problem.

Kyo:
I swear. Every time you open your mouth, it pisses me off.

Yuki:
And every time you open yours, you sound like an idiot!

Tohru:
They're fighting again? They can't even be in the same room together, can they? I guess cats and rats aren't supposed to get along, really. But the way they fight, there's gotta be a better explanation.

Kyo:
And then I'm gonna take my place as a true member of this family.

Tohru:
Do you think … maybe … what he meant by that was…he's trying to beat Yuki, because then he thinks he'll be accepted into the zodiac. If that's true, then that means the cat will be included with the other twelve animals. That would be wonderful.

Kyo:
I'm gonna break your pretty-boy face!

Tohru:


Kyo:
That's it. Let's go!

Yuki:
I can't even stand to look at you.

Tohru:
Yuki…

Kyo:
Damn it … why can't I ever kick him in the head for a change? But he really did try to lay me out today. He must be in a bad mood or something.
 

Tohru:
I don't know. I guess it's because Yuki's always so… polite you wouldn't ever think he'd have a bad day. But if what Kyo said was true, he might just be keeping his real feelings locked up inside.

Woman A:
Hey, go check it out. There's a real looker standing out front. I don't remember the last time I saw such a pretty face like that on a boy.

Woman B:
Oh, listen to you. You just don't know when to quit, do you?

Tohru:


Yuki:
Hi there. So are you all finished?

Tohru:
Yes, but don't tell me you came all the way down here just to pick me up.

Yuki:
Sure I did. It's not too safe for you to be walking alone at night.

Tohru:
An escort, two nights in a row. I have to say you and Kyo sure know how to make a girl feel special.

Yuki:
Well, we should go.

Tohru:


I'm sorry. It's just that anytime I ever had anything on my mind that was bothering me, it always made me feel better to talk about it with someone…

Man A:
Hey love birds, go home. It's too late for kids to be out on the streets.

Man B:
Sounds like it's past your bed time too.

Man A:
What are you kidding? It's still early.

Tohru:
But then again, you don't have to. I wouldn't want to talk to me either if I kept turning me into a rat.

Yuki:
No, it's not your fault. I'm the one with the curse.
For years, living in Soma house felt like living in a cage. Akito always liked to keep me as far away from… well, everyone as he could. But what I wanted was to live in normal life with normal people. I wanted to move in with Shigure, enroll in this school. I wonder why he let me go at first. I soon found out, I could leave the house, but leaving the cage… that wasn't so easy. No, I'm still a Sohma. And no matter how much I might want to, that's something that I can never change. I'll always be … different. I know that. And what scares me is, if I get too close to someone, they might realize that too. Not like Kyo. He's shy when he first meets people, but after he gets to know them a little, he can open up to them, be himself. Because of what he is, Kyo can never be accepted into the zodiac. But isn't it better that he can be accepted by normal people for who he is? That… is exactly what I've always wanted. I guess that's why I get so angry with him, because he can't even see what he has. He's blinded by that foolish desire to join the very same family I spent my whole life trying to run away from.

Tohru:


Yuki:
But that isn't me. You say they accept me because I'm nice? Well, I only act nice, because I want them to accept me. Not because it's how I really feel. I'm not a good person, I'm just…selfish.

Tohru:
The weather didn't say a thing about rain. What's a day without surprises, I guess.

Yuki:
This is bad…

Tohru:


Yuki:
No, just a little vegetable garden I take care of.

Tohru:
Then, did you do all this?

Yuki:
Uh-huh. This is my secret base.

Tohru:
Wow, it's even better than I pictured. So you came here to try and protect them from the storm, right? I'll help if I can. Just show me what to do.
Yuki:
Miss Honda, you are a good person.

Tohru:
Who? Me? You really think so? No one's ever told that to me before. Thank you so much. But maybe I'm only being nice so you like me, and maybe I'm just being selfish.

Yuki:
I don't think you could if you wanted.

Tohru:
I don't know about that. Mom said everyone can be selfish sometimes, but then again, she also said it's always better to give them the benefit of the doubt. No one really starts out kind. All we know how to do first is want. We want food, we want attention …it's just natural survival instinct, I guess. But kindness is something that we all have to learn as we go. It's something that grows and develops slowly over time. The same way our bodies do. So kindness can come in all sorts of shapes and sizes.

Tohru's mother:
True kindness isn't something we are born with. It's something we have to work it. We have to mold it and shape it within ourselves. Not everyone has it. But I think everyone has the potential. Sometimes, you just have to look really close before you can tell it's there.

Tohru:
Ever since mom told me that, I've always tried to look for the good in everyone. It's hard sometimes, but it's worth it. Because I get to see all the different shapes that kindness can take. For example, I think yours is sort of like a candle. Whenever you're around, you always seem to bring just a little bit more light into the room. Everything's brighter and it just makes me wanna smile. Oh, but now you're looking at me like I'm crazy.

Yuki:
Oh no. I'm sorry. It's just a …I guess I'm not used to talking like this.

Tohru:


Tohru's mother:
It's not always easy to see the good in people, Tohru. And some people, you might even doubt that it's there at all. But if you can somehow find a way to believe… sometimes, it's all that takes to help someone; to give them the strengths to find the good in themselves.

Tohru:
Hurray! We've saved the base.

Yuki:
Yes, but we are a little worse for wear, aren't we?

Tohru:
Maybe we should pick something while we're here, you think?

Yuki:
Um, I guess the leeks are ready.

Tohru:
Leeks? Ewww

Yuki:
I've been thinking. Next time you play that game, could I play too?

Tohru:
Sure, of course you can. You just didn't seem too interested before.

Yuki:
Well, I … when I saw everyone together like that, I guess I let my shyness get the best of me. But next time, I'd like to join you.

Tohru:
Uh-huh.

Yuki:
 I'll keep trying. Maybe I can still learn to open up more.

Tohru:
That's wonderful. I'll introduce you to Hana and Uo, they're really great. And I know that they'll both be excited to meet you. I mean, I think Uo's always looking for another 
victim to beat at "rich man poor man."

Yuki:
Thanks for the warning.

Tohru:
I think that's the first time I've ever really seen Yuki smile.

Tohru:
Eat up everyone!

Kyo:
Are you crazy? I hate leeks.

Shigure:
And onions and miso and… am I leaving anything else out?

Kyo:
Hey, miso is okay as long as it's soup.

Tohru:
I'm sorry. I guess I didn't know. I can make something else for you if you want. Just tell me what you like.

Yuki:
Just eat.

Tohru:
It really is a shame that these two can't get along better. I have to wonder how it would be if Kyo knew that Yuki admired him a little bit. Who knows? Hope that there is even something about Yuki that Kyo admires.

Shigure:
Um, Yuki, Kyo's already passed out.

Tohru:
If they could just understand that, maybe there's a chance they'd actually stop fighting.

Yuki:
You know, all this time, I simply misunderstood you. I'm sorry.

Kyo:
No, please. I'm sorry. From now on, let's be the best of friends.

Tohru:
On second thought, that's a little scary.
