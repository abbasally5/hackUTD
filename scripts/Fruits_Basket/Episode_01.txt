Tohru:
Look at that beautiful sky. See you later, Mom. Take care of the house while I'm gone, okay? I'll be back.
Hello, my name is Tohru Honda.
I haven't always lived in a tent. Up until last May I lived with my mom. It was just the two of us. But then, the accident. After I lost Mom, I began secretly living here on my own. It's not exactly comfortable, but it's alright. And it's what I have to do. Like my motto says, "never give up!"
Look at this, Mom. Did you know there was a house here? It seems so peaceful. It must be nice. How cute. The twelve animals of the zodiac.

Shigure:
My word. Do my eyes deceive me, or is there a strange young girl standing on my porch?

Tohru:
Oh I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I was just looking. I didn't mean to barge in without permission.

Shigure:
It's alright. I'd just set them out to dry. No harm done, but I find it hard to believe that these silly little things could attract your interest.

  
   
Tohru:
  Uh-huh. My mom told it to me when I was little.  
Tohru:
  Because that poor cat. He must be so lonely. I know, I won't be a dog anymore. I'll be a cat too. 
Shigure:
  Funny. I wonder what he'll say when he hears he has a fan. 
Tohru:
  He? 
Shigure:
  You were born in the year of the dog. I knew there was something I liked about you. I mean, aside from your pretty... 
  
Tohru:
  Yuki Sohma!  
Shigure :
  What do you have in that bag? A dictionary? 
Yuki:
  No, I have two of them. 
Shigure:
  
Tohru:
  Hi, it's very nice to meet you. 

And what brings you to our home this morning, Miss Honda?

Tohru:
Ahahaha, well you know I live …nearby.


You do? Where at?

Tohru:
Right. Okay, I think I'll just be going now. It was nice to meet you.


Wait, Miss Honda.

Tohru:
Uh-huh?


Since you're here, why don't we walk together?

Tohru:
Ah...haha.

Yuki fan club girls:
L O V E, We love Yuki! Yuki! Yuki! La la la... Yuki!?

Girl A:
Okay, start talking. What was that all about, Miss Tohru?

Girl B:
Why were you walking to school with Prince Yuki? Details, and they better be good.

Tohru:
It…it was just a coincidence.

Girl C:
Well for your sake, I hope that's all it was, hmph!

Girl A:
Every girl in Kaiwara-high class 1-D knows Yuki Sohma is the best looking boy in school.

B:
And he's intelligent.

C:
And great at sports.

A:
And for your info, we are the prince Yuki fan club. We got first dibs, sister, so you better stay clear.


Hey!

Girls:
What!?


She said it was a coincidence. Now get lost! Before your big noses of yours get bruised.

Girls:
Whaaaah!

A:
Now hold it, yankee. You're not gonna scare us with that street thug talk!

Hana:
One more word and you'll all get a (bleep-censored) with electric shocks.

Girls:
whaaaaah!

Tohru:
Thanks. I didn't think they'd ever leave


Were those catty little girls bothering you? Oh. Hana, don't actually shock anyone, ok?

Tohru:
You know, the truth is, I was so nervous walking with Yuki this morning. I couldn't talk to him. No, I couldn't even look at him.

Hana:
I sense strange electric signals coming from that boy.


Here we go again, Hana's electric report.

Tohru:
Strange how?

Hana:
I don't know. He's different.


Well, I admit he does seem to have an air of mystery about him.
And there are some weird stories floating around too. I hear one of those fan club girls tried to ask him out once, but he just pushed her away. And I mean that literally. Right in the hall. Then he left her on the floor and ran off.

Hana:
Like I said, I sense strange electric signals.

Tohru:
Let's talk about something else.


How's that job of yours going?

Tohru:
Oh fine, I guess. Why?


I don't know. You've been putting in a lot of hours lately. A lot more than usual.

Tohru:
Yeah, sure.


You're having trouble saving up for tuition, aren't you?

Tohru:
No. It's just... well, yeah.

Hana:
That's odd. I didn't think tuition here was that expensive.
And I don't remember you having to work this hard before, unless something else has ...changed.

Tohru:
No. Everything is the same….


So what is it? You're in some kind of trouble? You owe somebody? Your grandfather is giving you enough to eat, right? He isn't taking your money?

Tohru:
Mm-mm.


 I know, I worry too much. But seriously, if you need me to rough somebody up for you, you just say the word, got it?

Tohru:
Okay.Uo's gonna kill me when she finds out. But how can I tell my two best friends that I live in a tent? I can still remember how tough it was on Mom after dad died. She had to work so hard just to make ends meet. But she never seemed to mind. She always had a smile. It's hard to believe that someone so smart and so strong could be taken away by an accident.
After it happened, there were a lot of people I could've stayed with, I guess. I chose to live with my paternal grandfather. He was always so nice to me. But he's retired now, living on his savings. I didn't want to be a burden. So I promised him I would worked to pay for my tuition myself.
After four month, the house needed some renovations, and grandfather went to stay with his daughter and her family until the work was done. He asked me if I had a friend here I could stay with. I told him yes, but Uo lives in a one-room apartment, and Hana's got such a large family. I couldn't ask them. They've got enough to worry about. I'd just be in the way. That's when it hit me! If I could somehow live on my own for a while, then everyone would be happy.



Huh?

Tohru:
Oh, Yuki, it's you.
I mean, it's …hi.


It seems we're beginning to make a habit of bumping into each other.

Tohru:
It was nice meeting your cousin this morning. He was funny. And those little zodiac figurines he made were really cute.


Ah yes. But I thought I overheard you saying something about how you wished there was a year of the cat.

Tohru:
It's an idea I had when I was a kid. Silly.


Cats...useless, foolish creatures.

Tohru:
Uh...


 Tell me Miss Honda. How familiar would you say you are with the history of the Chinese zodiac.


Tohru:
I know the stories my mom used to tell me.


Did you know that it was originally nothing more than a simple calendar? A mathematical system to mark the passage of time. Only later did people begin to use it for things like astrology and fortune-telling.

Tohru:
Oh…I guess the story about the animals isn't true then.


No. I'm not really sure how or when the animals first came to represent the years, but I don't believe they were there from the beginning. What I do know is at no time in the history of the zodiac, has the cat ever been included. So you see, the cat has been shunned by society for thousands of years. But as the story is told, it still yearns to be accepted. Like I say, a truly foolish animal.

Tohru:
Sounds like you really don't like cats.


I noticed that this morning, that you're starting to look a bit pale. You should really take better care of yourself. Perhaps, we'll bump into each other again. Tomorrow.

Tohru:
Wow. He really is mysterious. But I'll pretend I didn't hear that pale remark. I can't afford to let anything bring me down. I've got too much to do. Besides, Mom probably had it much much worse.

Manager:
What..? Hey, you're gonna let this trash sit here all night?

Tohru:
Oh, sorry! Like my motto says, never give up no matter what life throws your way.

Shigure:
Phew. If we keep eating out like this all the time, I'm gonna have to buy a bigger robe.


Well then, why don't you do the cooking.

Shigure:
Why? Every time I make dinner, you complain.


Pickled radish in curry is not dinner. It's disgusting. I think one complaint is more or less justified.

Shigure:
You know Yuki, You've got a good head on your shoulders but I just don't think you're cut out for housework. Let's get a housekeeper.


No. Hold up. Miss Honda?

Tohru:
Hi Mom. I'm home.I know.It's late, but I can't sleep yet. I still have a paper to write. I'm just going to go down to the stream and wash up a little, okay?

Shigure:
Ahahahah~


Shigure, don't you think you're overdoing it?


So, you've been living in that tent by yourself?

Tohru:
Uh-huh.


For how long?

Tohru:
I don't know. Just over a week?


Well that explains it. All of this land is Sohma property. It seemed odd that we'd suddenly have a new neighbor.

Tohru:
I'm sorry. But please, can't I stay there a little while longer? It's only for a few more weeks, and then I'll go. I don't have much money, but I can pay you. Please let me stay.

Shigure:
Those woods aren't too safe. We've got wild animals, landslides, the occasional weirdo prowling around. It's not a good idea for a girl to be living out there alone.


So, you're done laughing?

Shigure:
Uh-huh.

Tohru:
Don't you worry about me! I'm already used to all the bugs. And if I can stand up to them, I can stand up to ...


Miss Honda!? A fever.

Shigure:
Ice! I'll get ice. It's, uh... it's...

Tohru:
Hmph. And you call the woods unsafe?

Shigure:
Well, relatively speaking.

Shigure:
There, you hear that? There's just been another landslide somewhere.

Tohru:
Oh, really? But how do you know that?

Shigure:
Huh? I guess you could say it's instinct.


Was it close?

Shigure:
Close to the tent. ...I mean, not at all.

Tohru:
Oh, this is terrible! Mom's picture was still in there. I gotta get her out. Mom, Mom, I'm coming.


Please calm down. You already have a fever.

Tohru:
But Mom.... What am I going to do? If I don't get her up soon, she'll be...hurt…

Shigure:
Don't strain yourself. We'll come back when it's brighter. I think your mom's probably glad it wasn't you in there. And I think she'd be upset if you got hurt just now. Don't you?

Shigure:
There. Isn't that better? And Yuki's still looking for some ice, if you want it.

Tohru:
I'm sorry.

Shigure:
You must be tired. It's a lot to happen in one day.

Tohru:
I...I lost my home again.

Shigure:
Are you okay?

Tohru:
Yes. It's sad. But... not as sad as other things.

Shigure:
Like what?

Tohru:
Like, not telling Mom "be safe" on the day she died. I said that every morning. "Bye, be safe". Except that day, I didn't say it. I had a test, so I stayed up studying almost the whole night. When it was time for Mom to go to work, I didn't wake up. I couldn't tell her "be safe". And she never came home. I used to think about quitting school, working. Mom told me she didn't finish school. But she always wished that she did.

Tohru's mother:
That's why I need you to stick with it. So you can tell me what it feels like to hold that diploma in your hand. And then maybe, you can have a life I've never got to have.

Tohru:
When she said that, that's when I knew, why she worked so hard… it was all for me. And with everything she did... I couldn't even get up long enough to say good-bye when she was walking out the door. Not even that one little thing… and then she was gone. So now, I have to finish high school like Mom wanted me to, no matter what. I have to hold that diploma in my hand. I have to, for her. I can't give up. Just because… of a fever... like this…


It's amazing. She always seems so cheerful at school. You'd never guess she's been suffering like this for so long. When I was young, there were many times I wanted to run away from Sohma house. I never did, I could always find some rationalization to stay. The fact of the matter is, I just wasn't strong enough, or I could have left. I could have lived in the woods by myself in a tent. I could've done what she did.

Shigure:
(sigh) You can call it amazing. But I don't think the word does it justice.


No. No, it doesn't. Do you mind keeping an eye on her. I'd like to go out for a while.

Shigure:
What? Where? You're not going to try digging out that tent? You are, aren't you? Do you want me to come with you? It won't be an easy job for you alone.


You're right. But I don't think I said that I was going alone.

Shigure:
Be safe, Yuki.

Tohru's mother:
Tohru? Tohru? You've got a fever again. You don't have to push yourself so hard. You don't have to do things the way I did. You can just be yourself. Do things your own way, one step at a time. You'll get there. I promise.

Tohru:
Mom?

Tohru's mother:
Just be yourself. You'll be fine.

Tohru:
Mom, you're here. But how did you...?


Good morning. How are you feeling today?

Tohru:
Um um, I guess I ...


I've brought your things for you. I think this is all of them. If you'd like to check.

Tohru:
 Yuki, this must've taken you all night.


Don't be silly.

Tohru:
So then, how did you…? I mean there was so much...


It's a secret.

Tohru:
Oh.


I know the place is dirty.

Tohru:
What?


And I realize the idea of living with two strange boys might seem a little awkward. But there is an extra room upstairs. You're welcome to stay there if you'd like.

Tohru:
No No, No! Out of the question.


We're not that strange.

Tohru:
No, I didn't mean it like that.

Shigure:
Of course, it won't be free. I do intend to pay you for your services.

Tohru:
For my...services?

Shigure:
As our brand new housekeeper! We'll just take your things to your room now. I'll assume your references whill all check out.

Tohru:
Oh wait. I can't let you do this. Not after all the trouble you've gone through already.
Please, it's too much.


Ms. Honda, we're doing this because we want to. You don't have to worry that it's causing us any trouble. And besides, where else can you go?

Tohru:
Well, if I'm gonna stay here, I'll work for room and board, and that's it. I don't want any money, and I wanna know all the rules of the house. I…


Relax. It's alright. You can do things your own way here. The only thing you have to do is be yourself. Fair enough?

Tohru's mother:
Just be yourself. You'll be fine.

Shigure:
I don't know. Do you really think it's a good idea having a girl in the house.


Naturally, now it occurs to you to worry. But I wouldn't. We'll be okay as long as she doesn't try to hug us.

Tohru:
All is well that ends well, I guess. But I'm still not sure how I ended up in Yuki's house. Or borrowing some of his clothes. It's like being in a dream.


I apologize for the smell. We've had this room close off for some time. It's probably best to keep the windows open for a while.


Yo. Time to pay the piper, rat-boy. I'm here to collect.


Funny. I would have thought he'd send somebody bigger.


That's right. You better get your tough talk out of the way while you can, cause I'm about to wipe that stupid little smirk right off your face.

Tohru:
Wait, stop! Don't fight.

Shigure:
Yuki, what were all those crashing sounds I just heard? Kyo's not here, is he?

Tohru:
I'm so sorry. Are you alright? I... No! I turned him into a cat. I'm so sorry. I don't know how it happened but we're going to help you, okay?

Shigure:
Hey, hold on. Excuse me?

Tohru:
Hurry, we need to get him to a doctor right away.


Miss Honda!

Shigure:
Tohru!

Tohru:
Oh Mom, I think this must all be a dream. Everybody's turning into animals.
