Tohru
- What is that?
Shigure
- Sounds like she's here early.
Kyo
- AH!
Tohru
- Oh, I didn't know you were expecting anyone.
Shigure
- Ah- ah... not so fast Kyo.
Tohru
- Hello? Huh... strange, there's no one here. But I distinctly remember closing that door. So somebody must have- AH!
Kagura
- Are you Tohru Honda?
Tohru
- Uhhh... yes.
Kagura
- Oh, um... well that's- I mean, umm...
Tohru
- Yes?
Kagura
- I'm Kagura... That's my name. Kagura Sohma.
Tohru
- Kagura Sohma. Hi... Awww, what a cute little girl!
Kagura
- Please, I... I heard that Kyo was here and- please tell me it's true? Is he?
Tohru
- Oh... yes of course Kyo's here, would you like to come in and see him?
Kagura
- Huh, Kyo?
Kyo
- Kagura!
Kagura
- I don't believe it... it... It's really you. Kyo! KYO!!
Tohru
- I wonder... Sohma's a pretty commone name I guess, so it could just be a coincidence. But maybe... Maybe it means she's one of the zodiac animals too!
Kagura
- Kyo! Why did you run away for so long? You didn't call me... Or send a card... Where were you? Oh darling... I missed you SO MUCH!! LOVE! YOU HAD ME WORRIED SICK!!
Yuki
- Well, it appears we'll be needing another door... doesn't it?
Shigure
- Sometimes it feels like the whole world is conspiring to destroy my house...
Tohru
- I'm... sorry...
Shigure
- Oh, I was just kidding... This is normal... it's Kagura's way of showing affection.
Tohru
- I would have never guessed... So then... from the looks of it, she must really like Kyo a lot.
Yuki
- Kagura does tend to get a little carried away with her emotions. That's especially true when she's around Kyo... You might not believe it, but she's two years older than us.
Shigure
- Than you... She's also part of the zodiac.
Tohru
- Oh, I knew it! That's great! Which animal is she?
Shigure
- Hmm... I figured that would have been obvious at this point.
Kagura
--

Did you even think about my feelings? No! You're awful, awful! After all the years we've been together...

Tohru
--

I'm sorry, I uh, I guess I've been a little distracted.

Kagura
- Kyo? Darling? What happened? You're hurt! Oh, no, no... no... Speak to me! Who did this to you?
Shigure
- Um... You, I think.
-------------------------------
Tohru
- *sneeze*
Yuki
- It's cold in here.
Shigure
- Yes, I noticed that too.
Kagura
- I'm sorry... But, when I saw Kyo I got so happy... all my love just came out at once... I couldn't help it.
Tohru
- It's like she's become a totally different person...
Kagura
- But it is really your fault too, Kyo... If you'd just remembered to call me, you wouldn'tve made me miss you so hard!
Kyo
- Who says I forgot? Maybe I didn't want to call you!
Kagura
- Oh, silly, yes you did... We are getting married, after all.
Kyo
- Since when?!
Kagura
- You mean you don't remember? When we were kids! You asked me to marry you!
Kyo
- Only 'cause you were gonna kill me if I didn't!
Tohru
- Oh, so the two of you are engaged! That's wonderful!
Yuki
- At least now, he'll have someone else to fight instead of me...
Shigure
- Congratulations.
Kyo
- Eh... You guys!
Kagura
- We really do make the best couple, since we're both members of the Zodiac... Well, Kyo's not officially a member, but he's still cursed so it's almost the same... We can still understand each other in a way that no one else can... And that's good... But the best thing is we can hug each other all we want, and we don't transform!
Tohru
- I don't believe it! Kyo didn't turn into a cat!
Kagura
- See! It's okay for zodiac members to hug!
Tohru
- Why is that?
Yuki
- It's a mystery to us too.
Shigure
- Though we've seen it enough to know it isn't just a fluke with Kagura... She's one of a kind, granted, but she's not the only girl in the Zodiac.
Tohru
- Really? There are more girls? Do you think I'll get to meet them some day?
Kagura
- Kyo! You have to tell me, and be honest! Do you love me? Do you hate me? Because I love you! I do! More than anything else in the whole wide world!
Kyo
- Uhhh...
Kagura
- I'll prove it! I'll cook for you! Everyday! I'll do anything! Even if you cheat on me, I can forgive a one-time fling! No one else loves you this much, do they? No! Just me!! We should always be together, don't you think? I just told you what you think! Now say something dammnit!!
Shigure
- Ahh, this pains my heart... But moving on- Tohru, correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't you something of a cat lover yourself?
Tohru
- That's me! The Year of the Cat Fan Club!
Kagura
- *gasp* A rival! But I'm not going to lose!
Tohru
- Uhh...
Kagura
- Tohru - what do you like best about Kyo? Because I like everything! Everything!!
Kyo
- Hey...
Kagura
- The good things, the bad things- I like them all! I love Kyo no matter what, even if he changes into his other fo-
Kyo
- Shut your mouth, right now. One more word, and... and I'll...
Kagura
- And you'll WHAT, Love?!
Yuki
- You should really call 'mercy', Kyo...
Tohru
- Ah, I almost forgot about the laundry!
Kagura
- Laundry?
-------------------------------
Tohru
- It's too bad I didn't get a chance to hear which Zodiac animal Kagura is... Oh well, who knows? Maybe I can ask her myself one day. I do hope the two of ys get to be friends.
Kagura
- That's not Kyo's shirt, is it?
Tohru
- Ugh! I didn't see you there!
Kagura
- So, is that Kyo's shirt?
Tohru
- No, not yet. These are Yuki's clothes. I haven't even started on Kyo's... but they're next on the list.
Kagura
- Don't worry, I'll do it! If that's okay with you. It is, right?
Tohru
- I don't know...
Kagura
- I said I'll do it! I really want to! So please, please can I?
Tohru
- Oh, ah... well.. Okay! If you insist.
Kagura
- Yay! Thank you so much!
Tohru
- Uhh... Don't mention it...
Kagura
- Kyo! Okay, take everything off!
Kyo
- Stop it! What are you doing?!
Kagura
- Your laundry, silly! Now take off your clothes! Or do I have to wash you along with them? ...Where are you going?
Kyo
- Away from you!
Kagura
- Ah! Kyo!
Shigure
- Don't worry. I'm sure he'll wander back when he gets hungry.
Kagura
- Ohhh...
-------------------------------
Tohru
- Oh. What's the matter?
Kagura
- Why is Kyo so mad at me? I don't understand.
Tohru
- You know... he might not really be angry. Sometimes he just doesn't-
Kagura
- *gasp* That stink! How could you let him wear this? My poor, sweet darling! You'll have clean clothes from now on, or I'm not the future Mrs. Kyo Sohma!
Tohru
- I guess if you don't need anything, I'll just go hang up Yuki's shirts now...
Kagura
- Let's see... hom much detergent? Hmm... Maybe a little bit more... One more scoop for love. Ooh! Better yet, the whole thing!
-------------------------------
Yuki
- Ah, there you are... Are you still going out to shop for dinner?
Tohru
- Oh. Uh-huh.
Yuki
- I'll come with you.
Tohru
- Sure.
-------------------------------
Kagura
- Oh, yeah... Perfect. Now when Kyo comes home, we can have a nice, fresh cup of tea. Yay...
-------------------------------
Yuki
- I'm guessing you've noticed by now. It would be sort of hard not to... But Kagura has a bit of a one-track mind when it comes to Kyo. She's had her heart set on marrying him since we were little kids, for whatever that's worth. It's pretty silly, I know...
Tohru
- Oh no, not at all! I think it's amazing.
Yuki
- Uh... you... do?
Tohru
- I mean, that kind of devotion is pretty rare, you know? To like someone so much for that long... It's really wonderful, isn't it?
Yuki
- Hmm... I hadn't thought of it like that.
Tohru
- In fact... I think she'd be a great person to have as a friend.
Yuki
- You should try. I think you'd be a good influence on her.
Tohru
- I don't know about that... But it's nice of you to say...
-------------------------------
Kagura
- "Kyo! Q! I love you!" - Waah-ha!! No more smell! I'm a perfect wife!
Kyo
- Finally... Now I just gotta get my shirt back, then I get the hell outta here...
Kagura
- Maybe I should wring it out a little to make it dry faster! Dry! Damn... you!! Uh...
Kyo
- Ah! Tell me you didn't do what I just think you did!
Kagura
- My love...
Kyo
- My shirt! Ugh... And I really liked this one, too...
Kagura
- I'm sorry darling... I promise, I'll fix it right away... Here, you can wear this one until then.
Kyo
- It's soaking wet!
Kagura
- But that's because I washed it for you.
Kyo
- Is there anything of mine you didn't wash!?
Kagura
- Your pants...
Kyo
- What am I supposed to do now?! Go around half-naked?! You want me to get pneumonia, is that it?!! ...AHHH!!!
Shigure
- Kagura... how much detergent did you use?
Kagura
- All of it!
Shigure
- Hmm? *sniffs the air* Is something burning?
Kagura
- Oh no, the tea! AHHHH!!!
Kyo
- Ah!

Uh... uh...ah...

Shigure
-

Coming through...

Kyo
- Wahh!!!
-------------------------------
Shigure
- Don't we look lovely?
Kyo
- I can't believe you're laughing.
Shigure
- Oh, right... 'Now I'm mad'.
Kagura
- I... I'm sorry... I didn't do it on purpose...
Shigure
- I know that, Kagura.
Kyo
- You still did it!
Kagura
- I'm sorry... I really am... Please, Kyo... I'm sorry...
Kyo
- Yeah, so what, "sorry" isn't going to get us a new kitchen...
Kagura
- What do you want me to do!?
Shigure
- Oooh... That hurts...
-------------------------------
Shigure
- Well, you see... It- It's a long story...
Yuki
- That's all right. I think I can guess what happened.
Tohru
- Uhh... I'll help you clean up.
Kagura
- I can do it.
Tohru
- But it's too much work for you all by yourself...
Kagura
- No, please! Let me do it! I want to... It's my fault the kitchen's like this...
Shigure
- At least she's being consistent. She wouldn't let me help, either...
Kagura
- Please, it's okay... I'll do it all...
Tohru
- Well... if you insist...
-------------------------------
Tohru
- Do you really think it's okay to leave her in there?
Yuki
- Don't worry. Kagura's always been the resilient type. I'm sure she just needs some time to herself.
Shigure
- Hmm... Of course, the real crisis here, is that we won't be able to cook any dinner while the kitchen's wrecked... I guess we're just going to have to grit out teeth and call for take-out... *sigh* And I was so looking forward to another of Tohru's delicious home-cooked meals.
Yuki
- So... where'd the other home-wrecker go?
Shigure
- Aha... *points upwards* He's still busy sulking, I think. We'd probably do well to keep our distance for a while...
-------------------------------
Shigure
- I'm gonna burst... Ahhh, full, full, full..
Yuki
- You, Miss Honda?
Tohru
- I couldn't eat another bite. Oh... but what about and Kagura and Kyo? We shouldn't let their dinners get cold.
Shigure
- Ah... so let's see... Am I brave enough to go look for Kyo just yet? Mmm. No. But I think I can chance the kitchen...
-------------------------------
Shigure
- Kagura, you know we ordered you some dinner... I'm pretty sure it'll taste better while it's hot.
Kagura
- Hmm... Thanks, but... I'll eat later... You can just leave it out there for now. How's Kyo? Is he still angry?
Shigure
- Your guess is as good as mine. He still hasn't come down from hiding.
Kagura
- You're angry at me too, aren't you?
Shigure
- No, I wouldn't say that. I'm not angry. Of course... I can't say I'd want to... repeat this little incident...
Kagura
- Shigure, please let me stay here too... I don't think I can leave knowing Kyo's living in this house with another woman.
Shigure
- Woman-? Ah... We're talking about Tohru now, right?
Kagura
- No, I can't wait that long! I have to force Kyo to make up his mind tonight!
Shigure
- That's not a good idea.
Kagura
- You don't know! You don't understand how a woman feels when she's in love!
Shigure
- Yes I do... At least, I've felt enough women to venture a guess.
Kagura
- Huh?
Shigure
- Sorry. That's your cue to say, "Shigure, you perv!" And roll you eyes, slap me, whatever.
Kagura
- Uhh... Ahaha... Shigure! You... big... perv! Ha ha ha ha! Pervert! Pervert! Ha ha ha ha!
Shigure
- Ahhhh!!
-------------------------------
Tohru
- Everything's so clean... Hmmm... Kagura and Kyo still haven't eaten their dinners. They must be starving. ...Kagura...?
Kagura
- This'll take all night. I know it... Oh...
Tohru
- Has she been working this whole time?
Kagura
- *stomach rumbles* Uh... I'm so hungry...
Tohru
- Mmmm... Hi there. Um... I made you a snack. I noticed you hadn't eaten your dinner yet, and I thought you might be hungry... So I made you some rice balls with the leftovers... I hope it's okay that I served them cold... I can heat them up if you want!
Kagura
- Eh... no... I like them this way.
Tohru
- Okay then... Now why don't we see if we can't finish fixing this door?
Kagura
- Huh?
Tohru
- I thought it might make the job more fun if we worked together.
Kagura
- Yes... That would be nice...
Tohru
- Good!
Kagura
- Before we start...?
Tohru
- Yes?
Kagura
- Can I please have one more riceball?
Tohru
- Sure!
-------------------------------
Kagura
- Hey, lookie, lookie!
Tohru
- It's a cat, right?
Kagura
- Hmm hmmm.
Tohru
- It's so cute!
Kagura
- Uh-huh...
Tohru
- Look... I made one too.
Kagura
- A little rat!
Tohru
- You can tell?
Kagura
- Sure I can! It's adorable!
Tohru
- Why thank you very much! I'll put it up... right... here.
Kagura
- I'm gonna do another one!
Tohru
- All right. I will too!
Kagura
- Tohru, what are you gonna make?
Tohru
- Let's see... How about a dog?
Kagura
- Okay! Then I'll make... another cat! Ooh! And this time I'll make the tail...
-------------------------------
Kagura
- Tohru?
Tohru
- Yes?
Kagura
- Thank you... I hope we can be friends from now on...
Tohru
- Yes... I'd like that...
-------------------------------
Tohru
- Kyo...
Kyo
- Ah!
Tohru
- You're not really planning on staying up here the whole night, are you?
Kyo
- Better believe it. Kagura's still down there!
Tohru
- You don't want her to be here?
Kyo
- What do you think? You see what happens when she's around. It's always like that. She's crazy! And she won't ever shut up about all that stupid "marriage" crap... I can't stand it.
Tohru
- I think it's sweet. When you have someone who loves you as much as she does... You should really feel pretty lucky... You know? And, I think every girl dreams about getting married one day... Kagura just dreams a little... louder than most. Nuh...
Here ya go...
-------------------------------
Tohru
- Kyo, you have a dream too, don't you? To beat Yuki? Isn't that why you were up in the mountains for so long? Training?
Kyo
- Hm? Yeah- Oh. Guess Shigure told you...
Tohru
- That must have been really hard... Being out there all by yourself...
Kyo
- No. I wasn't alone. I was with my master.
Tohru
- Ooo, a master? He must be really strong then!
Kyo
- Are you kidding? He could flatten that sissy rat-boy with one punch! My master's as strong as they come! He's a Sohma, but he never treated me like the others do. He's been teaching me how to fight ever since I was a little kid! Sure, he put me through hell up there in the mountains, but,those were some of the best days of my life! It's like every day was an adventure, you know? I'd wake up every morning and ask myself, "What's he gonna teach me?" "How much stronger am I gonna get today?" It was great! Ahh... listen to me! Just talking about it gets me pumped up! Ah... But this must seem pretty stupid to someone like you, huh.
Tohru
- Oh! No! It's fascinating! I guess I just don't really know anything about fighting is all... Not to say that I'm not interested to learn! And I mean, I do know a little bit! I have a couple moves I can show you! Um, let's see... Right Straight!
Kyo
- You suck.
Tohru
- I think I've discovered somethine else new about Kyo... Underneath that angry face he usually makes, he's been hiding this little awkward smile...
-------------------------------
Kagura
- Kyo! Darling! Goodbye my love! Take care of yourself 'til I come back!
Tohru
- Glad to see everything's back to normal.
Shigure
- Incidentally, did you ever figure out which animal Kagura is?
Tohru
- No, not yet.
Kagura
- Kyo, be nice, or I'm not gonna kiss you goodbye!
Kyo
- Who needs it?!
Kagura
- That's it! Kyo, you jerk! I'm leaving you, Love!
Paperboy
- Hello, it is I! Your ever-reliable local paperboy, come to deliver the news of the day!
Shigure
- This is bad.
Yuki
- Ah, thanks for your hard work.
Paperboy
- Oh sure... It's my job. Sorry I was a little late this morning. Bye!
Tohru
- Hey, I figure out Kagura's zodiac animal. She's a boar!
Shigure
- Um... That's cheating, I think.
Tohru
- Kagura... You know, I think I'm beginning to understand better why it is you like Kyo so much... He really does have a lot of good qualities... And the more I learn about them, the more I want to see him the way you do.
Kagura
- Kyo! You two-timer!
Shigure
- I thought she was going to forgive his little flings...
Kagura
- I will forgive him, right after I kill him!
Kyo
- What the hell did I do?!
Tohru
- 'Scuse me... Maybe I should start over... What I'm trying to say is, I hope I can be like you when it comes to finding all of the good qualities in the people that I care about... They're not always easy to see...
Kagura
- You want to... be like me?
Tohru
- Uh, huh. It's wonderful the way you find so many things to like about one person...
Kagura
- I don't know what to say...
Kyo
- Put on some clothes!!
Kagura
- Okay, bye, bye! Oh, and I'll bring you a new shirt next time I come over, Kyo! Love you!
Kyo
- Hmph...
Tohru
- Goodbye! See you again soon!
Kyo
- Hey! What's that look for?
Tohru
- Nothing... You're just so... lucky.
Kyo
- Ah! Don't you even start! C'mon! We're gonna be late!
Yuki
- Oh, well... there was such a commotion, that I couldn't even do any gardening.
Tohru
- Ah, the base! Those leeks we picked were delicious. Are you planting something new?
Yuki
- Yes, strawberries.
Tohru
- Really? I can't wait, I love strawberries.
Yuki
- Hmm... I thought you might... That's why I'm planting them.
Tohru
- Oh... Thanks...
*rumbling*
Kagura
- Kyo! Stop right there! I almost forgot to give you your goodbye kiss! C'mon, pucker up! Kiss me! Kiss, kiss...
Tohru
- All of a sudden, I'm feeling like there are a few things I need to do... I'd like to learn more about Kyo and Yuki if I can... About the things they like... and the things they don't like... I think that might help me to understand them both a little bit better. And who knows? Maybe it will help me to find all the good qualities in them that I haven't seen before.
