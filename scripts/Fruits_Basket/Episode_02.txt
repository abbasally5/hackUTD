  Oh yes, they certainly are. Here's your mail.
Tohru:
  No no, we gotta do something!
Postman:
  I wish my dog was this smart. Good day!
Kyo:
  Damn it! How am I supposed to come up with an excuse if both of you transform too?
Yuki:
  Don't you dare try to blame this on us, you stupid cat!  
        Anyway, whenever our bodies come under a great deal of stress, or when we were hugged by a member of the opposite sex, we transform. After a little while we change back but the only thing is, uh… we're naked. Well, we must seem pretty strange to you at this point, huh? 
  A family curse. I guess that would explain a few things. If Yuki turns into an animal whenever a girl hugs him, that must be why he pushed that fan club girl in the hall. He didn't want her to find out his secret.       
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  It's hard to believe, Mom. All the girls call Yuki a prince, but I didn't think he could really be so …noble. I just thought it was because he was cute and good at sports but this, I've never seen him act like this at school. School!? Oh no, I'm late, I'm late, I'm late. I'm late. Sorry, thanks for everything, I've gotta go. I've gotta go.
