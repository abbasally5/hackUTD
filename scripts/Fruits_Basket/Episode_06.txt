I was so happy when you smiled,
Your smile breaks through the clouds of grey,
Far from the sunny days that lie in sleep.
Waiting with patience for the Spring,
when the flowers will bloom renewed again,
knowing there's more beyond the pain of today.
Although the scars of yesterday remain,
You can go on living as much as your heart believes.
You can't be born again although you can change.
Let's stay together always.
 
 
 
As long as I'm going to be living here,
do you think it would be all right if I told two of my friends where I am?
I'm sure they'll really want to know, if that's okay.
 
So long as you don't mention anything about, you know, the zodiac and whatnot, I don't particularly mind...
 
Thanks so much!
You see... The Sohma family has been living under a secret curse for generations.
If they're ever hugged by someone from the opposite sex, they transform into animals from the Chinese Zodiac!
It's hard to believe, but it's true!
And naturally, this is a secret they can't allow anyone to find out about...
 
 
What!?
So not only were you living in a tent, but now you've moved into Prince Yuki's house?!
Seriously?!
 
Yes. I'm sorry for not saying anything about it sooner.
There was a lot that happened, but everything's fine now...
And they're all really nice people.
So there's nothing to worry about!
 
This is definitely a bolt out of the blue... I wonder...
How will the Prince Yuki Fan Club girls react when they hear the news?
 
I thought it was strange how you've been spending so much time talking to the prince and orange-top lately...
Now I understand...
 
Perhaps we should have them invite us over. I'd like to see for myself whether or not this is a suitable environment for you to be living...
 
Hey, great idea.
Let's check it out right now.
 
Wait. If we show up unexpectedly, they may not serve snacks.
 
Ooh, another good point.
You're two for two.
Okay then... we'll stay over tomorrow night.
 
Uh... wait...
Okay!
 
High-school girls...
High-school girls...
1 -2 -3 High-school girls...
Ahh... I can't help but wonder what kind of girls these friends of Tohru's are...
 
A Yankee and a psychic.
 
Ah! They're here!
Hi, come in! I guess you found the house okay.
 
No. We got lost.
I'm thinking this was a bad idea.
Just don't do anything stupid.
 
That goes double for you, you damn rat.
 
Yes... all of us would do well to be careful while they're here.
Because I wonder, if either of these girls were to find out about the family curse, what would happen... do you think?
At the very least,
I suppose that Tohru would no longer be allowed to stay in this house.
Well, either way... something's bound to turn out!
''Que sera sera''.
 
You just like hearing yourself talk, don't you?
 
There's a dog.
Over there.
 
Oh! Yes, that's a dog!
 
So, these are my friends.
Arisa Uotani and Saki Hanajima.
Hey.
A pleasure.
 
Yes, welcome, welcome! Please, make yourselves right at home.
 
Say, it's 'Shigure', right?
This is your place?
So what do you do to pay the rent around here?
 
Me? I'm a writer...
Well a novelist, actually.
 
Did you say you're a novelist?
Why the heck are you so surprised?
 
This is the first she's heard of it.
 
Right... I really I had no idea...
What was it, again?
''Fine literature,'' or something?
 
Uh-huh... that's right.
This sort of story.
Oh sorry, my mistake...
This is my real work...
This one here was just something I did for fun.
 
So that makes it OK to write that dime store smut!
 
You're a sicko, you know that?!
What were you thinking...?
Shigure, that's amazing!
I mean, to think I actually know someone as important as a novelist... !
 
Careful, Miss Honda. You don't want to inflate his ego too much.
 
Like his head could get any bigger than it already is...
 
How wonderful! I just made another new discovery!
 
Well, enough about me. Why don't you tell us something about yourselves?
You could start by telling us how you met Tohru.
 
What, serious?
 
I'm sure we'd all like to hear!
Right Yuki? Right Kyo?
 
Uo saved me.
''Hey, pinhead! You better not step on those... you!''
 
Wait let me back up...
This one time in middle school,
I dropped all my notes in the hall...
 
What have I done...
 
Yeah, I remember that.
I guess I could get a little... 'rough' back then.
Back then?
 
Well, you were still a Yankee then... Weren't you?
 
Right... I started runnin' with them in-5th grade was it?
You always used to wear those masks all the time...
 
And I had my eyebrows thinned out, and wore those long skirts.
 
You're forgetting. You do all of those things now, Arisa.
I guess you're right.
 
That's lovely... She's so... How shall I say it- by putting it into words,
I'm afraid the nobility of it all would only be obscured...
Of what?
You know, she's so spunky!
 
You sick bastard.
How sad... Love, doomed from the start.
You're reading that?
 
That silly little thing? Oh I'm flattered! So what do you think?
 
You don't want to know what I think.
 
Oh... no?
 
But when is Volume 2 coming out?
 
Look, can we just knock it off with the books? Okay?
 
Everyone's getting along so well.
It's so nice that we can all have a good time together like this!
I know! I just thought of something fun we could do!
Wait here, I'll be right back!
 
So then... Saki, you never did tell us how you and Tohru got to be friends...
 
Are you sure you're ready to hear?
 
Oh ah... that's okay, as long as you're friends now!
That's what's important!
 
We were in middle school, and I was transferred into Tohru's class...
Ah-h... is that so?
 
Yes... You see, at my previous school, I had caused something of a disturbance...
 
Well, that is a wonderful story, isn't it.
But I just remembered I have some work to do, so if you kids will excuse me...
He ran off.
 
Ran the hell away...
 
I gotta say, I didn't know what to make of all this when she told us,
but it looks like Tohru's fitting right in here...
I'm happy for her... ...and I guess I can understand why she didn't want to say anything at first...
But still...
We made a promise.
The three of us swore over Kyoko's grave, that when the time came,
we would be there to help each other, no matter what.
That probably sounds a little bit overdramatic.
But it wasn't really, for us...
After all, Tohru was our first real friend and everything...
Tohru... Tohru and Kyoko, both... you see, they were there for me when I needed someone most...
Thanks to them, I found the strength to climb my way up out of all the crap I had fallen into...
They helped me to believe in myself... that I could change if I wanted...
And when I met the two of them... for the first time...
I discovered that I did want to change...
I wanted to be someone Tohru could be proud to call her friend, the way I was proud to call her mine...
So, this time around, with everything that's happened...
the fact that I wasn't there to help Tohru... ...that bothers me.
I mean, that she would even think she had to go through all this trouble by herself...
Maybe she doesn't think she can count on us...
Or maybe we're just not that good as friends...
Nah, I just don't think she's the kinda' girl who worries about stuff like that.
Miss Honda is... she's the kind of person who puts others' well-being before her own...
 
Huh...?
Sorry it took so long...
I hope you're all ready to play!
Rich Man, Poor Man!
Ah, that's a fine idea, Tohru.
Okay, how 'bout we pick it up where we left off?
I don't think I got to finish makin' a fool outta' orange-top here.
Yeah, talk it up! But this time, when I win, you have to dye your hair black!
Oh? Well, when you lose, you have to bleach all the dye outta' your hair, and leave it white!
It's naturally this color!
Is that right?
 
That's right!
Yuki... Would you like to shuffle the cards?
 
Uh... I...
Sure.
 
Why, you rotten little-!
You and your cheap-ass tricks!
 
Cheap nothin'! That's fair game!
You're the one playin' tricks, Yankee!
Next time you pull that crap, I'm gonna light you up!
 
Go ahead and try! It'll be the dumbest thing you ever did! I will take you out!
 
Oh yeah, some tough guy!
You're runnin' away!
Who's running?!
I'm going to the bathroom!
 
Aww. Gotta take a leak?
 
What's it to you?!
Better hurry! We don't want you to piss yourself!
 
Dammit, you got a foul mouth!
 
Oh!
Something wrong, Miss Uotani?
 
Uh... no...
 
Ahh. Well, that's good.
It's just that things sounded like they were getting pretty heated there for a minute...
 
I know! Until Kyo gets back from the bathroom, why don't we all play a quick game of Sevens!
Yeah... sure let's play...
Ohhhhâ€¦!
Uo!
 
Miss Honda, look out!
 
Tohru...
Are you okay?
Are you hurt at all?
No... I- I'm all right.
Ah! You see? I didn't fall!
Just cleaning up!
 
--Stupid cat!
--Damn rat.
 
 
OI' orange top sure is takin' his time.
Sure is...
And the prince just up and disappeared. Guess he...
 
You're right. I wonder where our kind hosts have run off to.
For the love of... we can't even start this game of Sevens, you know?
A cat...
Oh! You're playing Sevens, right?
That sounds like fun!
Think you have room for one more?
 
Well if it isn't the master novelist. You any good at this game?
Well, you should know, in the old days they used to call me ''The Sevens Bandit''.
Oh? Really?! That's incredible! !
I'll say. It's a lie.
But enough about me!
Let's get to playing, shall we?
So what are the rules?
You guys hear that?
Sounded like some kinda' 'boom'.
 
There was a definite, 'boom'.
 
This is not good! I think Kyo just changed back to normal!
 
Unless we do something, those two are going to see him.
And what's worse, he'll be naked!
 
I know! For now, I'll throw him Yuki's clothes! Maybe no one will notice...
 
It doesn't matter.
Anything to cover him up!
Kyo... !
 
Catch this, Kyo!
Huh? Why is this so heavy?
Ahh! I thought you'd run away! I'm so glad you're back! Uh... Um, Spot.
Spot?!
 
That's odd... It appears we've run out of snacks...
I'll go find the kitchen.
 
 
Oh, no! Kyo just changed back, and the idiot's already transformed again!
Okay! I've got to cause a diversion.
 
 
Oh no! Now Yuki, too?!
 
 
That's weird... I swear I thought I saw orange-top in here...
Ooh!
Miss Honda... I think Spot is trying to tell us he's hungry, don't you?
 
Yeah... That must be it!
Here! Come on boy!
Let's go to the kitchen, Spot!
Tohru, wait.
Uh... yes?
Some more snacks? If you don't mind.
Oh! Sure!
I'm really sorry...
I promise, the last thing I wanted was for this to cause everybody so much trouble...
Hey, nuffin' to abologishe for.
I'm not so sure...
Tohru, if these people are important to you, then they're important to us too...
Do you understand?
Yes. I understand. Thank you.
Oh, but I'm sure Yuki's wondering where we are...
Come on...
This game isn't going very well... now is it?
Uh... Why don't I-?
I'll go check on her...
Sorry to keep you waitin-
 
Miss Honda! !
Oh no, Yuki!
 
H- help!
 
Eh? But you're mixed in with all of the jelly buns.
I can't tell where you are!
 
Here, Miss Honda!
 
Where? Where are you?
Here!
 
Let's see... jelly bun... jelly bun... jelly bun...
Ah! ! Yuki, it's you!
 
Wait! Miss Honda, that's a...
...a jelly bun! !
Hey-y! Tohru, nice catch!
Although, most of them still fell.
Maybe I was lucky she didn't catch me.
She squeezed that bun so hard, all the filling came out! !
 
I thought we might at least find something to wear in here.
So it's empty, then?
 
Well. Tohru is very thorough about doing the wash.
 
Aww, hell with it! Just let 'em see us!
All we gotta do is erase those girls' memories and we'll be fine, right?
I suppose that's true, as long as you're okay with that.
Okay with what?
It would mean Tohru's memory would have to be erased as well.
 
Stay here! I'm gonna get us some clothes!
 
Arisa...
You're about to step on...
Yeah? Step on what?
An orange cat, with clothes tied around its neck...
...being carried in the mouth of a dog... ...who went that way.
A-one-two, one-two, one-two, one-two...
Nothing gets the blood flowing like a rubdown with a dry towel!
A-one-two, one-two, one, two, one-two...
 
Idiot.
 
 
This is a fine bed.
Isn't it? Shigure bought it for me.
Well... from the looks of it, he must really think big of you, huh?
That's exactly how it appears.
As long as he's at it, this room could probably use some more, you know, girl stuff.
Like right here.
You should have him put in a dressing table, or something like that.
 
Oh, no, I couldn't!
I couldn't think about wanting more!
I'd be asking for it! Really...
I mean, I've only just I started to realize how lucky a person am to have so much already, you know?
Tohru, if these people are important to you, then they're important to us too...
Do you understand?
 
I have a new home, living here with the Sohmas...
And I have the two most wonderful friends in the whole world, who care about me so, so much...
Just knowing that I can always count on you to be there for me, and how much strength that gives me...
I'm already so lucky.
If I'm not thankful for what I have, I'd just be asking for it!
I love you both.
 
Nah, I just don't think she's the kinda' girl who worries about stuff like that.
 
Miss Honda is... she's the kind of person who puts others' well-being before her own...
 
I guess they do understand her. Pretty well, I'd say...
That they do...
Tohru is that kind of girl.
Invincible love.
That's right.
Right...
 
 
Uh... Hey, Yuki... are you-?
â€¦ahhhh!!
So, Yuki. You're having a hard time waking up as usual...
Yeah, yeah, just keep movin' will ya'...
 
Wow, Kyo. With as much as you want to beat Yuki, you still don't try to sneak up on him when he's like this.
It's very admirable.
No, that's not it. It's not like that.
He's stronger when he's half-asleep.
Ah, so you have tried to attack him, then?
Yeah, I tried! And I got beat even worse than when he's awake! Okay?!
Do you know what that means?!
It means that stupid, dirty little sissy-boy rat is always holding back on me!
 
What gives?! I thought you were still out of it!
Your stupid voice woke me up.
Fine! I don't care anymore, dammit!
Asleep or not, it's you and me! Right now!
I'm gonna mop up this kitchen with your face!
How can you even talk about this nonsense so early in the morning?
A cat and mouse...
That's what they're like.
 
You think?
The way they're fighting, it's like a cat and mouse...
Just like the ones in the old cartoon.
Yeah... Something or other and Jerry.
 
That's right! These guys are still here!
So, the two of you don't get along too well, do ya'?
I suppose not...
 
Even so, this seems like a pleasant enough house...
Which is good,
because if it had been a poor environment for Tohru to be living in...
There are many things I would have to do to correct it.
Yes... Many things.
 
What... kind... of... 'many things'?
But I can see that the two of you... both have fine electric signals...
Oh, you didn't know?
That's even better, I think.
 
Well, I'm sure you'll do your best to be nice...
To Tohru, we mean.
Oh, Uo... Hana...
We'll come by for another visit soon.
Yes, let's...
I'm curious to learn more about the Sohma family's unique signals...
Okay! Now how 'bout some breakfast?
Yes, breakfast.
Hey, hey hey! You gotta be kidding!
Damn girls are takin' over!
I- I know it must seem that way! But, they mean well... !
You'll see! Uo and Hana are both really, really good people! So, please...
 
Fine. Whatever.
After all, they are your friends, right?
Right!
 
 
 
Now let's all gather,
Enjoying the company we share,
Our tears will dissolve into thin air,
As we drink up this wonderful life.
La, la, la...
Takin' in all the sweet love and life.
La, la, la...
Drinkin' up all this good love and life.
La, la, la...
Take it in all this sweet love and life.
 
 
 
I say we make it a riceball battle!
Hm. What if we did something like a hit and miss?
The cultural festival is about to begin.
Your both looking well, Yuki, Kyo...
 
Strange boy...
 
Yeah. Like your one to talk.
Your pretty strange yourself, you know?
When someone is jealous of somebody else...
It's probably because they can see the pickled plum in the middle of their back.
There's one stuck to your back too. A plum I mean.
