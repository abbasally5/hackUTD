Momoe:
I'm gonna buy the best pitching machine I can afford.
We can skip to sprinklers for now, and use that money for new bats and helmets.
The club budget's the two hundred thousand yen can go toward balls, so with bus maintenance and other expenses.
And then the two million yen I saved last year will do it.
I'm just glad from my heart when the money can actually go all right attended to.

Shinooka:
Ah... excuse me! ...But, I'd like to be the equipment manager, if you have me...

Momoe:
And now that we've got dugout built.

We're ready for training camp tomorrow.
I can't wait!


Tajima:
Oh, God! I forgot to drain the monster this morning!

Mizutani:
Huh?!

Shinooka:
Eh? What did you forget?

Mizutani:
No! Nothing at all!

Shinooka:
Well, if we need to stop at [the] store...

Sakaeguchi:
No, it'll be okay, I assume.

Tajima:
My jack will explode if I hold it over a week!

Izumi:
Have some respect, there's a woman here!

Tajima:
I can't help [me/it]!

Hanai:
Can't believe that guy really used to bat cleanup for the best team in the Little League.

Abe:
It's true. [I] Got it straight from the goof horse's mouth.

Hanai:
Hm...

Tajima:
Let me out!

Hanai:
Hey, about the challenge the other day, I was wondering something.
Did you pick me instead that Tajima guy, because you [thought] you could get me out easier?

Abe:
Nah, I just saw your ego would be a nice (xxx) target for him.

Hanai:
Great. Thanks, 'cause I walked straight into that one.

Shiga:
Abe?

Abe:
Yeah?

Shiga:
Mihashi's feeling a little nauseous.
Can you give him these and keep an eye on him for me?

Abe:
What? Why'd I have to?

Shiga:
I may not be an expert on baseball, but I can see that Mihashi looks up to you.
So, why don't you go look after your pitcher.

Abe:
[Yes/Yeah], fine.

I just met the guy two weeks ago, did Shiga really think I can bond with him?
[If/From] what I've seen so far, I honestly don't even know if that's possible.

Mihashi. If you know you get carsick, you should've taken these before we left.

Mihashi:
Thank you. I don't usually get carsick.

Abe:
Is there something else [along/wrong] with you?

Mihashi:
I'm not sleeping much these days.

Abe:
Yeah, how come?

Mihashi:
You heard what the coach told me, if I don't clean up my act soon, she won't let me pitch at all.
But (xxx) every time I think about it, I get so much that... I can't, I can't help it...
I know I need to be stronger, but it's so hard sometimes...

Abe:
I just don't see this guy changing much [if there's/without] serious psychiatric [care/help].
[But] I don't [wanna be (xxx/want him to get] replaced, either.
He has such amazing control, and he blindly follows whatever instructions I give him.
He really is an ideal ace.
If I can't find a way, I put up with him.

Mihashi:
Oh, no! Abe thinks I'm [anxious/obnoxious]!
I gotta do something! Otherwise I [would be/end up] getting cut from the team!


Mizutani:
Forest got character.

Hanai:
Yeah, right.

Momoe:
Get change, so we can start cleaning!
When [that finish/that's finished], we're gonna gather some wild plants.
'Cause we are gonna be making our own dinner [at the night/tonight].

All:
Uh...


Shiga:
Shakaeguchi's on bath room detail.
Nishihiro and Suyama are doing the dishes.
Uh, Hanai's dusting [the] mattresses.
Looks like everybody's hard at work ...everyone, that is, except Mihashi.

Izumi:
This light ball is dead.
Anybody know with a new (xxx)?


Shiga:
All right, let's finish [at/up] the cleaning and head out to gather some wild plants!

Izumi:
What kind of plants to expect us to find out here?

Shiga:
This time of (the) year, it's Osmunda and butterbur sprout.

Momoe:
Abe, Mihashi.
Come on, You got a different menu.


Momoe:
So this field's actually owned by the local village.
I made a deal while we can use this in exchange for helping the villagers in the forest.
That way we get a practice, and we get to work out with some manual labor.
By the way, if you really let loose, how fast can you throw?

Mihashi:
Ah, let's see... maybe like one hundred... 101?

Momoe:
101?! That's the lamest thing I've ever heard!

Abe:
Mihashi has awesome control more than makes up for his lack of speed.

Mihashi:
Abe is defending me?

Momoe:
True. But have you figured out the secret of why he has such control? I'm betting you have it.

Mihashi:
There's a secret?

Momoe:
Mihashi, show me your normal windup, but tried on top of this block of wood.

Mihashi:
My windup?
My pivoting foot... But this seems stable enough.
Okay, now up with the left and... Awww!

Abe:
Holy crap. [Are] You Okay?

Momoe:
Wow! What an impressive torso muscles!
You'll never be consistent with your control [and to/until] you learn better form.
True ball control isn't in your hand and arm.
It's in your whole body.
The point I'm making is what little control you do have is coming only from your arm.
You can throw a lot harder than you realize.

Mihashi:
I, I can?

Momoe:
Abe, grab a helmet.
'Kay, heads up, Mihashi. You're in charge of this.

Mihashi:
A radar-gun?

Momoe:
Here I go! Watch my speed!

Mihashi:
That looked... really fast.
Ah?! 122?!

Momoe:
While my shoulders warmed up, I can probably get another 2 to 3 K.

Mihashi:
That was... that was... that was... t- t- that was...great!

Momoe:
Please. Mihashi, you realize you and I are pretty close to the same size.
You're just as capable of throwing that fast.
I want you to know what [if/it] feels like to throw with your full strength. Here, take this.

Mihashi:
Whoa!

Momoe:
Go throw your normal windup and hold that instead [of] your glove.
Now, get on the mound!

Mihashi:
Right!

Momoe:
You think I'm making a mistake, don't you?

Abe:
Huh?

Momoe:
How far you think you['ll] get with just descent control and a few breaking balls?

Abe:
As far as we want.

Momoe:
(xxx) as you're the one calling (him) the signs, right?
I don't think you understand the catcher's role.

Mihashi:
'Kay, ready!

Momoe:
All right!

Mihashi:
Oh, it's heavy...
Let's see. Set up... Pitch like normal...
Ah! That feels too heavy, can't turn my body!
Crap! Gotta compensate!

Momoe:
111 kph. You won up 10 K.

Mihashi:
What?!

Momoe:
You can feel all of the blood's rushing to your hands, can't you?

Mihashi:
Yeah. My fingers are tingling.

Momoe:
Now you know you can do it.
You might even hit 130. Of course, you have to practice.

Abe:
We don't need a wild pitcher!

Mihashi:
Look, Abe, I- I'm gonna work really hard for you, I swear.
I can pitch with good speed and control.

Abe:
Think about your strike zone. If you throw all out, can you still hit on nine sections?!
His pitching is fine, isn't it?
Speed comes from natural talent, but control takes work.
You need to take into account all the work he's already done and realize the value of his accuracy.

Momoe:
So he couldn't stand to work on his mechanics.

Abe:
Well, I mean...

Momoe:
I'm gonna head back to the cabin. Mihashi, keep practicing until you're comfortable doing a full windup from the block.

Mihashi:
Okay.

Momoe:
And don't throw anymore pitches today. That's a strict order, you get me?

Mihashi:
Uh, okay.

Momoe:
Look, I understand a kind of work you've done to obtain such a accuracy.
However, your shoulder and elbow were still in pristine condition because you haven't been throwing in full strength.

Mihashi:
You might be right, but I am used to throwing every day.

Momoe:
You need to save your energy for a game against Mihoshi Academy.

Mihashi:
Oogh?!

Momoe:
When I called them set it up, they said they couldn't send their starters, so we are playing against their freshmen.
That's right! Your former teammates who hate your guts!

Mihashi:
Noooooooo!

Momoe:
Okay, [head now] for real this time, we'll see back at the cabin around five, cool? Bye!

Mihashi:
A game with Mihoshi? And she expects me that at my speed? With this hanging over my hand?
I-I don't think I can do it.

Abe:
'Kay, look. Throwing 130 would be great, nobody won't make you a fastball pitcher.
You still don't understand what makes you so good.
You're a control pitcher, you don't need speed. All you need is...

Mihashi:
I'm sick and tired [of] throwing slow.
I want to throw fast.

Abe:
I'm telling you this for your own good.
Once you mess with your mechanics, there's no turning back!
Why [jeopardize] your control just for more speed!
Fine, ignoring me?

He may act out of pity on the mound, but he's just like any other pitcher.
Openly sensitive but they (xxx) even (xxx) ego.
If I didn't (xxx) play with them, I never [even] give 'em the time of day!
Seriously, all pitchers are pricks.


Tajima:
Oh...

Sakaeguchi:
Butterbur sprout...

Hanai:
Cut it out, [dude]. No one would want yours lover.

Sakaeguchi:
Whatever, this one's mine. I picked myself.

Tajima:
I can't help myself. I gotta try!

Shiga:
No snacking around.

Tajima:
Wow! Chopstick master!

Shiga:
I'm not talking only about (the) manners. Now listen up, everyone. Time for a little sport[s] science lesson.
There are three important hormones found in the brain.

Izumi:
The brain?

Oki:
Hormones?

Shiga:
What purpose do they serve?
The first allows us to concentrate on the future, [event still of/events that have] yet to happen.

Mihashi:
[We xxx/xxx, I'm starved.]

Shiga:
This helps to motivate, "I can win the game, I can make the catch [all/or], I will hit a homerun."
When you're challenging yourself like this, the hormone, thyrotropin is released into the brain.

Hanai:
Uh... what?

Izumi:
Beats me.

Shiga:
The second is for the present.
Whether practicing or in a real game, corticotropin helps you concentrate on the now.
It's important because it helps you react to stimuli in real time.
And the third hormone (that) I wanna tell you about is released to the brain when you reflect [in/on] your past.
"I did well today, I worked hard and I accomplished the goals I set for myself."
It activates (to) the brain's ability to fill pleasure and pain.
It plays a real big role in your [own motions/emotions].
Maybe you've even heard of this one, called dopamine.

Suyama:
[Even I heard/I've not had] a class yet.

Mizutani:
[Yes/Yeah], so, what about it?

Shiga:
[Feel radically/Theoretically] when these three hormones are active [during/you're in] good shape.
But the reality is different.
Don't you hate going [the/to] practice after losing a big game?
And don't you feel down when someone else has naturally more talent[ed] than you?
Do you often give (the) priority to what you want to do instead of what you need to do?

:
Yeah, sure.

Hanai:
We all have days like that. In fact, I'm pretty sure [there's/that's] just part of being human!

Shiga:
Yes, you were right about that.
But the point I'm trying to make [us/is] when you practice or train, you should [plays/place] quality over quantity.
Believe you [cannot/can] accomplish a goal you've set, concentrate on it, and once you complete it, be satisfied with the outcome.
Though it's much harder than it sounds, especially when you've set a tough goal for yourself.
However, there is one thing we can all do together to practice this approach tonight.
And that's eating.
So before you eat, say to yourself, "I can eat this entire board."
While you're eating, concentrate on the (xxx), chew, swallow, repeat.
Then once you finish, think, "That taste is fantastic."
These three, thyrotropin, corticotropin, dopamine, all working together.
Eating flesh vegees and not snacking [all/are] the ways, we help focus your eating tonight.

:
[Yes/Yeah], so?

Shiga:
Well, much like your muscles, you can actually train your cerebral nerves.
Three times every day, you activate those hormones by eating a meal.
Basically, you're doing calisthenic[s] for your brain, teaching get to release them whenever they need it.

Izumi:
So, it will help us improve our concentration?

Shiga:
Yes!

Suyama:
We'll be more motivated?

Shiga:
You get (xxx)!

Hanai:
Ko... Ko... Koshi...

Tajima:
Koshien, now the way, dude!
We can do it for reals!

Hanai:
I can be as blindly optimistic as him?

Shiga:
Exactly! It said that the human body can learn a reflex within one week.
Like when you see some good food, you start to [cerebrate/salivate] at a sort of eating it.

Nishihiro:
You mean like Pavlov's dogs?

Shiga:
Yes! Just like that!
Now, we can train our brains to develop those reactions and activate the hormones when we see food!
Sound like fun?


Shiga:
Everyone, look at your meals.

Mizutani, Nishihiro:
Uh... looks great.

Shiga:
It looks great!

All:
It looks great!

Shiga:
It looks great!

All:
It looks great!

Momoe:
Thank you for the food.

All:
Thanks for the food!

Tajima:
Yum!

Hanai:
Yum!

Mihashi:
Yum!

All:
Yum!
Thanks meal (xxx)!


Hanai:
So, Mr. Shiga is a math teacher, isn't he?
Where did he come up with all that scientific stuff?
Did any you guys buy what he was saying?

Sakaeguchi:
Mr. Shiga's been [to] the whole kinds of schools and seminars over the years (xxx) from math.

Hanai:
Okay, how would you know something like that?

Sakaeguchi:
Well, I started practice back at the spring break.
And I sort of heard some stuff, if I remember right, Shiga ask Coach Momo on the team, something about giving new life to Nishiura's baseball program.

Hanai:
Coach Momo is a bit of a mystery, isn't she?

Sakaeguchi:
I heard she works on crappy part time jobs to raise money for the team.

Tajima:
What a nice person!

Hanai:
Yeah, it does show a commitment to the team, but don't you find the whole situation's strange?

Mizutani:
Totally.

Hanai:
So, does anyone know if... You don't think Shiga and Momoe might be dating?

Sakaeguchi:
I think... [I think I] just through open my mouth a little...

:
Me too...

Tajima:
Uh... Wait, what?

Izumi:
Hey, by the way, isn't this room a little crowded for all of us to sleep in?

:
There's a bit tight.

Shiga:
Okay, time for bed!

Sakaeguchi, Hanai, Mizutani:
Ah!

Shiga:
Lights out, everyone!

Hanai:
But, sir!

Shiga:
It's important we get our rest.
As you drift off, [we'll] reflect on the positive things that happened today.
What this does increase your dopamine levels, which in turn gets your much more restful sleeping.

Hanai:
Ah, sir?

Sakaeguchi:
This room is tiny, there's no enough space [full over] futons.

Shiga:
Uh, gotcha. You boys may be a little young for this, but here goes.
Often people only truly understand each other, once they share the same bed.
In fact, every night we're here, I want you to share a futon with a different one in your team...

Hanai:
That's sick.
You're dead!

Sakaeguchi:
You bastard!

Nishihiro:
Think fast!

Izumi:
Hey!

Shiga:
You're tired, Mihashi?

Mihashi:
Ah...

Shiga:
You didn't overextend yourself today, did you?
Were you able to sleep last night?

Mihashi:
Well, I...

If he figures out I haven't slept a wink, [xxx would just a/he'll just start] [raging/ragging] on me.

Shiga:
Hello?

Mihashi:
I'm fine. I- [I'm indeed fine/I mean it. I'm fine]. It's just....


Abe:
Damn pitchers!

Momoe:
So, how Mihashi do today?

Abe:
He did exactly what you told him to do, coach.

Momoe:
Good.
You know it's interesting. Whenever a new team is coming together, there's always two or three players who immediately stand out.
But you know what else, just two or three can't win games.
They have to inspire the rest of the team.
Tajima's something else. He's a star without a doubt, and [with] his experience batting cleanup for the Sea Breams, [who/he] would wonder as our lineup.
And Hanai's power to play this phenomenon, he'll be a star on any team in the league.

Hanai:
You can't hit me...

Momoe:
And the other one, Abe, is you.
If you want it, you could be the backbone of this team.

Abe:
That's not what I'm interesting in.

Momoe:
Why not?

Abe:
You said it yourself, I don't understand the role of the catcher.

Momoe:
You will understand, though.

Abe:
I like to think I already do!
There is more than one way to approach catching.
It's clear you and I just disagree on which one I should take!

Momoe:
Abe, you're taking this the wrong way.

Abe:
Then what do you want for me? Make me understand!

Momoe:
Don't worry so much. You'll figure it out.

Abe:
Ah...

Momoe:
You will.

Abe:
Fine. What do you want me to do first?

Momoe:
You know what I just did to you? Do that with Mihashi.

Abe:
Do what now? Are you serious?

Momoe:
Yep. As a heart attack. And I promise you will see a whole new side of him.


Mihashi:
Oh, I'm exhausted... but I still can fall asleep, just one hour, that's all I ask...


[Trailor]

Shinooka:
Tomorrow, Nishiura High's freshmen baseball team will have our first practice game of this season.
The first game is always exciting, but it's also [we/our] chance for the team to work out a lot of the kinks.
I notice Mihashi doesn't seem to be doing sour lately.
I wonder if he's nervous about having to play against his old teammates.
It's too bad they don't like him because I think he's pretty nice guy and a good pitcher, too.
Next time on "Big Windup!", "The Practice Match."
Oh yeah, I have to be the PA announcer for the game!
