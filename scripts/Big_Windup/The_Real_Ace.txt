Yeah! Five more!

Go back to T-ball, pitch!

Mihashi!

Mihashi:
Ah!

---------- [OP]

Student A:
Sign up here for intramural basketball!

Student B:
Any girls interested in the volleyball club? Now (xxx)

Student C:
Dang it, managers of the soccer teams are hottie!

Student D:
Do you have multiple personality disorder? Try out for the drama club!


:
D'you guys hear? Mihashi's transferring into another school.

:
Really? That's awesome! Now I can actually stand a play next year.

:
You mean, we'd finally be rid of those lousy pitches of his.

:
You don't think he's gonna try and play at another school?

:
No freaking way. Everyone knows he wasn't talented xxx got him on a team.

Mihashi:
I just need to accept reality. Even if I join the team here, there's no way they'll let me anywhere near a pitcher's mound.
And if I can't pitch, if I can't play the position I love, I'd rather not play at all.
I'll just sit the stands and watch... as a spectator.

Aww!
Uh, oh, wait! Uh...

Momoe:
Found another one!
So what's your name?

Mihashi:
Mi-Mihashi.

Momoe:
And position?

Mihashi:
Pitcher...

Momoe:
That's great! We've been looking for one!
This will be a freshman only club, and a school's first hardball team.
When I graduated from here several years ago, the team only played in the rubber-ball league.
I'm your head coach, Maria Momoe.
And over there, holding my cute little dog is Mr. Shiga, our faculty supervisor.

Mihashi:
Yeah.

Momoe:
And now that we have you pitching, we finally have a complete team.
Okay, let's go over the lineup!
To the left of Mihashi is our catcher. Say hey, Abe?

Abe:
What's up?

Momoe:
Then, Sakaeguchi, an infielder.

Sakaeguchi:
Hey.

Momoe:
They've been practicing here since spring break, and both have Little League experience, so they can teach us a thing or two about hardballs.

Abe:
Whatever I can do to help, coach.

Sakaeguchi:
Nice to meet everyone.

Momoe:
Let's see, at third base we have...

Tajima:
Oh, that's me! Tajima! And I also bat cleanup!

Abe:
Tajima...

Mihashi:
You play third and you bat cleanup?

Hanai:
I've always batted cleanup, too. But I change my mind, I'm not joining now.

Momoe:
What?! [Capture...] on my list... Why do you change your mind?!

Hanai:
I won't play for a woman.
A girl managing a bunch of guys, it's unheard-of. And besides, I don't really care about baseball any more.

Mihashi:
She's good.

Tajima:
Hey, let me try!

Momoe:
Hey, Abe! Heads!

Hanai:
Straight up!

Tajima:
Awesome!

Momoe:
Nice catch!

Hanai:
I've never seen such a cleanly hit fly ball in my life.
My coach in junior high must've really sucked. Now that I think of it, none of our opposing coaches could do that either. What the hell?!

Mizutani:
Aha, ha, ha! That was an amazing (xxx)
No way, I could've hit it that high.

Momoe:
All right! Almost forgot! How about some fresh-squeezed orange juice?

Hanai:
Uh... What?

Momoe:
Wait right there.
And here we go. Drink up!

Mihashi:
No way... He's actually drinking.

Momoe:
Who else wants a glass?

:
No thanks. I'll pass.

:
I think I'm allergic.

Mihashi:
High... High school coaches are...

Shinooka:
So scary!

Abe:
Mihashi, right? Grab a mitt. I wanna see what you got.

Mihashi:
I almost forgot. I'm the only pitcher.
So I have a chance to actually play in this year.

I, well... I'm... sorry, but I can't do this.

Idiot! What was I thinking, saying I was a pitcher?
It's not that I don't want to pitch. I do, but I know I won't be accepted.
I'll just be humiliated like always.

Abe:
Did I say something to make him cry?

Izumi:
Mm-hm.

Mihashi:
No, listen. I'm not what you're looking for.

Abe:
Why is that?

Mihashi:
My pitches, they're really slow.

Abe:
Look, man. We aren't expecting you to be an all-star right away.
Were you a reliever?

Mihashi:
Mm-hm.

Abe:
So, you were a starter. What school?

Mihashi:
Mi... Mihoshi...

Abe:
Mihoshi. Never heard of it. Have you?

Sakaeguchi:
Sure haven't.

Shiga:
Wait. Do you mean Mihoshi Academy in Gunma?
Oh.

Abe:
So are you from Gunma Prefecture?

Tajima:
How cool! So you're like a foreign exchange student!

Izumi:
Don't be stupid. Gunma's only one prefecture over.

Sakaeguchi:
So, what brings you to Saitama?

:
Dad got a new job?

:
I could understand it was a private school.

Hanai:
Shut the hell up! You were the ace on the team. Weren't you the best on they had?
Nobody wants to hear you brag!

Mihashi:
No, you're wrong.

Hanai:
Yeah then, what is your deal!

Mihashi:
I... was only the ace... be-because of nepotism.

Hanai:
Nepotism?

Tajima:
So why? I want to totally be the ace because of nepotism!

Abe:
I don't get it.

Mihashi:
Well... You see... My grandfather... owns the school...

All:
Oh.

Abe:
They made you a starter because it's your grandpa's school?
That's incredibly lame.

Mihashi:
It wasn't the coach's fault.
I could've given up my spot at any time, or just quit.
And I knew it would've been the right thing to do... for the sake of the team.
But I... I couldn't. Three years, I still (xxx) the mound.
Because of me, they weren't having fun.
Because of me, we lost all of the time.
Because of me, they started to hate the whole game.

Abe:
Wow, you are kind of annoying.

Mihashi:
Hello!

Abe:
But you refused to give up the mound. I never trust the pitcher who would.

Mihashi:
You... mean it?

Abe:
Don't get me wrong. I think you're a bit of a douche.

Mihashi:
Oh!!

Abe:
But hey, as far as a pitcher, you're all right.

Mihashi:
I am? 'Kay, sorry. I'll at least try.

Abe:
Cool.

Mihashi:
But I have to apologize to you now, 'cause I'm only gonna let you down.

Abe:
Most of every pitcher I've come across has its quirks, but this guy is beyond strange.

We worked all spring break to get infield at least playable, but we ran out of time so the outfield still needs work.
We used [all extra] (the) dirt [where did/we had] construct the mound, wondering what kind of pitcher we'd end up with.
So what do you think? Work for you?

Mihashi:
Yeah, I guess.

Abe:
You probably haven't thrown in a while? Try not to overdo it.

Mihashi:
Yeah, but... I (xxx)...

Abe:
You've been training? On your own? Great.

Mihashi:
Ughhh...

Abe:
Crap! I must be pressuring him somehow. This would be a long season.

Mihashi:
But I just, so, you know I can't throw like you expect...

Abe:
No expectations, man. Just throw how you like.

With his size, I bet he really can't throw the heater. But he's this insecure now.

Mihashi:
A-Augh!

Everyone's watching. They'll openly see how horrible I am. I told myself that I wasn't gonna play this year, why am I even here?
I suppose I'll just throw one or two, get this over with.

Abe:
Low... Ah!

:
That's slow-mo.

Abe:
Mihashi!

Mihashi:
What? More?

Abe:
Oh, hell! What else you got?

Hanai:
Yeah, let me guess. No breaking ball, right?

Mihashi:
No, I do!

Abe:
Like what?

Mihashi:
Uh.., well, one that does this, and I think that's a curve. And then, maybe a screwball? Plus, I have a slider... probably.

Momoe:
Four breaking balls?

Abe:
"This", "that", "maybe", "probably"? What the hell's that mean?
Haven't you ever worked with the pitching coach?
Interesting. Okay.
Tell you what, let's work out some signs.

Mihashi:
Huh?!

Abe:
Hey, Hanai.

Hanai:
You need something?

Abe:
Mind standing in the box for a second?

Hanai:
Yeah. I kind of do since I told you I'm not joining the team.

Abe:
You bat cleanup, right? How about a three-at-bat challenge.

Hanai:
Fine. Bring it.

---------- [Eyecatch]

Tajima:
Oh, what about me? I wanna try this!

Abe:
Maybe next time, Tajima.

Tajima:
Yeah well, that sucks!

Abe:
It just hit me. He's the Tajima from Arakawa Sea Breams.
Very good team. He's got a solid swing. But it doesn't seem like he'd be very imposing at the play.
Hanai's a bigger guy. So if we shut him out, it'll boost Mihashi's confidence.
But I wonder what Tajima is even doing here.

Tajima:
Hey, Grandpa!

Tajima's Grandfather:
Hey there, Yuichiro!

Sakaeguchi:
So I take it you live closeby.

Tajima:
Right under straight!

Sakaeguchi:
Hey, that must be convenient.

Tajima:
Oh, yeah. It's the reason I enrolled here.

Abe:
Man, lucky us!

We only need the infielders for this. Rest of you can just hang out.

Hanai:
You arrogant little...!
You're just pissy 'cause I'm not playing this here.
Let's go, then. I feel like hitting some dingers anyway.

Abe:
If you could really hit that balls the way you say you can, I'd beg you to stay.

Hanai:
Bastard!

Abe:
Mihashi.

Mihashi:
Huh? Yeah, coming.

Abe:
You've used signs before, haven't you?
I can just learn the ones you're used to make it easy on this.

Mihashi:
Actually, there aren't any I'm used to.

Abe:
How come?

Mihashi:
Because my catcher didn't like me very much, I think.
So that guy said he bats cleanup.

Abe:
Yeah, I know.

That's exactly why I picked him.

Don't worry about him. I've watched him play in junior high. He's a typical power hitter.

Which I know how to handle, plus I pissed him off so he's already on his edge.

Mihashi:
Sorry, but...

Abe:
Come on, man. Little late for that now, isn't it?

Mihashi:
Okay, but I'm warning you now. It won't be pretty.

Abe:
Listen. Stick by my side, and I will make you a true ace.
All you gotta do is throw whatever pitches I'm calling for.
And I sure warn ya, I really hate when pitchers shake off my signs.

Izumi:
All right! Three-at-bat challenge! And play ball!

Abe:
He looks so tense. Guess pushing his buttons is really worth.
Let's test what he's on this one.

Mihashi:
Oh, no. He's giving me a sign.
Okay, fastball, up, and away.
Here goes.
He's gonna hit it!

Izumi:
Steerike!

Tajima:
That's what I'm talking about! Big wind!

Mizutani:
You're way under, Hanai!

Hanai:
Swore I get trying too hard for the long ball.

Abe:
He swong just under that one, so he's got a good eye.
We'll be looking for more (xxx) this time.
So let's throw it down a bit.

Mihashi:
Curveball, low, outside corner.

Hanai:
Oh, slow!

Sakaeguchi:
Got it.

:
Out!

Mihashi:
A grounder at the short.

Hanai:
Patience, Hanai.

Abe:
That's one out.

Hanai:
Just one! Bring the next one! Come on!

Abe:
He's anxious. Chased after both the fastball and the curve.
'Kay, Mihashi. Do you shake this one off, or trust me.

Mihashi:
Fastball down the middle?!

(Abe:
And I sure warn ya, I really hate when pitchers shake off my signs.)

Mihashi:
Man, I'm fully expecting to blow this challenge, but I don't wanna serve of a meet ball he's gonna hit for sure.
Sh... Should I trust him?

(Abe:
Stick by my side, and I will make you a true ace.)

Mihashi:
No one's ever talked to me like that before. Ever!
He might actually believe in me...

Hanai:
Down the middle. Here I come!

Izumi:
Strike!

Hanai:
What the hell?!

Abe:
Nice. He threw it.

Mihashi:
Can't believe it he didn't hit that. It was an easy one!

Abe:
Started settling now. All right, let's test the focus.

Mihashi:
Fastball, high inside, out of the zone.

Abe:
Check swing. He's still not quite to see in the ball.

Mihashi:
Abe's signs are actually working. This's never happened to me before.

Abe:
Hanai let the inside fastball go, but he's swinging anything down the middle.
Let's see if we can trip him up.

Mihashi:
Down the middle, screw ball.

Hanai:
Dead center, again. Here!

Tajima:
I got it!

Abe:
That makes two.

Mihashi:
It's like his signs have special powers or something. Like that making my pitches faster.

Tajima:
Good one!

Mizutani:
Nice work, man!

Tajima:
Just one more to go!

Sakaeguchi:
Way to go, dude!
Keep it up!

Mihashi:
That was (xxx), it's Abe. He's amazing.
I'm almost afraid to think it. But maybe, just maybe, I can be a real ace on this team.

Abe:
High fastball, Mihashi. Middle of the plate.

Mihashi:
An ace's ball can't be touched, it just goes straight into the mitt. So that's what I'll do!

Hanai:
What the?!

Izumi:
Steerike one!

Hanai:
Come on! What the hell was that crap supposed to be?!
How would you do that?! The ball like it floated!

Mizutani:
He actually thinks it floated?

Tajima:
Excuses, excuses.

Hanai:
It was floating. I saw it!

Abe:
That's what his fastball looks like.

Hanai:
A fastball?! It was too slow to even be a change-up!

Abe:
Well, you're almost right. Mihashi can't actually throw a fastball.
Technically, his fastball is a breaking ball.

Tajima:
I always thought the fastballs were pitches they didn't break at all.

Abe:
Nope. A fastball is actually a breaking ball that thrown with clean back spins, causing more speed, less break.
Normally, pitchers are trained in how to throw like this, but since Mihashi figured it out on his own, the best his got is what you just saw.
Hanai, you said his pitches throw like it floated, which is something I heard said about the pros.
That just proves what good eye you have.
Now, most any other time the way you read the pitch would been right, are the straight change-up.
But since Mihashi's pitch didn't drop like a regular change-up, it appeared to float.
Mihashi, your fastball could become your strongest weapon.

Mihashi:
My strongest weapon?

Mizutani:
Don't get carried away, Abe. He did tell us he sucked in junior high.

Tajima:
Yeah.

Abe:
Sure, on its own, it's fastballs, nothing to write home about.
So if you're used to it all the time, you get (xxx)

Hanai:
Then why don't you explain to me why I couldn't touch it?!

Abe:
Because Mihashi never gave you the chance to learn his rhythm.
When you're up to on the mound, how many different sections do you divide the strike zone into?

Mihashi:
Uh, three down, three across?

Momoe:
That's nine sections!

Abe:
Mihashi has amazing ball controls something even professional players struggle with.
We can use that control consistently, we can get Hanai out any time we want.
Mihashi, as a pitcher, you have incredible potential.

Mihashi:
No, not me. It's you, Abe.
You're the one who's incredible.

Abe:
Glad you can see that.
Because without my signs, you're just a weak pitcher with no confidence.
Don't forget how powerless you are without me.
You'll throw exactly what I tell you to for the next three years.

Gentlemen, you're looking at our soon-to-be unstoppable ace pitcher. Long as the rest of us do a part fielding and hitting, the next thing you know, we'll be on our way... to the Koshien tournament.

All:
Uh...

Mihashi:
...Impossible.

Hanai:
Hun?! [You either xxx you're not, so] at least pretend to be?!

Tajima:
What do you mean "pretend"? I seriously wanna go to Koshien!

Mihashi:
Impossible!

Hanai:
I don't ever wanna hear you say that word again! Do you hear me, idiot!

Tajima:
Don't stop choking him!

Momoe:
To enjoy the game, you have to want to win, those who don't fail miserably.
Me? I want it.
But any of you who give up without even trying will end up riding the pine.
You want the ace number, think like an ace!

Mihashi:
Look, I hear ya. But it's impossible...

Momoe:
Go ahead, say that word again, Please.
Today starts the two-weeks of (xxx) up your lazy bodies stand during Golden Week we'll head up to training camp.
And after that, practice game against Mihoshi Academy.


:
Your pitching sucks, Mihashi!

:
You don't deserve to wear the ace number!

:
Yeah, give that jersey to Kanou already!


Mihashi:
Nooooooooo!

Momoe:
Lose that wimpy attitude or you'll never set foot on the mound! Got it?!

Hanai:
I don't know. His wussiness seems pretty well and ingrained.
You might as well be telling him to quit pitching altogether.

Abe:
He's right. Major personality change is tough.
Guess I'll just have to keep treating him like a puppet.

Mihashi:
Sorry...

Momoe:
I am not kidding around.
If you truly want to be our ace, you gotta prove to me you have some self-confidence.

Mihashi:
I do... I wanna be the ace. I really want it!

---------- [ED]

Shinooka:
The Nishiura High freshmen baseball club is in a five-day training camp xxx whip the players into shape both physically and mentally.
We're totally self-sufficient during the camp since we make our own meals and do all around cleaning.
Unlike the pros to get to hire someone to do all that.
Or half anxious, half excited to get the season started.
And as the equipment manager, I'll do my best to support the guys every step of the way.
Next time on "Big Windup", "The Catcher's Role."
You should see this awesome meal we made.
