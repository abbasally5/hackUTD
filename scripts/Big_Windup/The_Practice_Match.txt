Momoe:
Okay, now we know how hard you can throw before you start loosing accuracy.
Game's tomorrow. Let's call it a day so we'll all rest it up.
Oh, Mihashi. Mihoshi's starting pitcher, tell me everything you know about him.

Mihashi:
Uh, like what?

Abe:
His best pitch for starters.

Mihashi:
Oh, he's forker.

Abe:
Forker?

Mihashi:
Yeah, but the catcher, Hatake, had a hard time catching Kanou's forkball, so...


Hatake:
Hey, Kanou, you might hang in back for a little bit?

Kanou:
If you want to work on a few forkballs? Sure.

Hatake:
It's just during practice, coach has been with Mihashi, you know.
So if I'm never gonna learn to catch that forkball of yours.

Kanou:
Yeah, I gotcha.
We can need to stay late, our coach has to make me the new ace.


Mihashi:
They had to stay after the practice just to work together.
I knew that, and I still didn't give up the mound.


Momoe:
Okay, dinner break's over!
Next exercise.
Using this board will be improving your observation in perception skills.
We begin by focusing on observation.
Here we have the numbers 1 to 25 written randomly, as fast as you can touch each number in oder.
With practice you can train the nerve circuits in your brain to react much quicker the signals from your eyes.
If you don't train your brain, your eyes can't keep up.

Tajima:
And what is any of this have to do with baseball?

Momoe:
A lot. Fielding a bunt, for instance.
As you grab the ball and turn to throw, the batter is still in your field of vision.
But he's outside your awareness.
Your brain is not used to processing information that quickly, so he's basically invisible.
Because you all focus only on making the play.
You boys know what speed reading is?

Hanai:
Yeah, I think I heard of that.
Is that what you read a book just by flipping through all of the pages?

Momoe:
A-ha. But the keys of speed reading isn't just running to move your eyes real fast.
It's taking in the whole page, then letting your brain try to make sense of what you saw all at once.
Try thinking about this instant memorization, like taking a mental snapshot.
Anyone can do that.
Trouble is, at school, they go out of the way to train us out of these natural abilities, teaching us to form words and sentences by looking at each letter individually.
So we're gonna reclaim our natural talents, apply 'em to baseball and go out there and kick some butt!
Now who wants to try?

Tajima:
Coach!

Momoe:
Great! Tajima's first.
Mr. Shiga, ready with the stopwatch.

Shiga:
Check!

Momoe:
Ready, set... go!

Tajima:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22[two two], 'three, 'four, 25!

Momoe:
Oh...

All:
Ah...

Momoe:
The time?

Shiga:
7.9 seconds.

Hanai:
Were you pointing at the right numbers?

Sakaeguchi:
Were just pointing and counting real fast.

Tajima:
Whatever! You saw me?
I'm just [so/that] good!

Momoe:
Oh, thank you! Thank you for joining our team!

All right, now we have got five boards here, so I want you boys to partner-up and see what you can do.
Each of you give it three tries and keep track of your results to compare later.
Because the player with the best time gets to pick the batting order for tomorrow's game.

Sakaeguchi:
Oh, crap!

Suyama, Izumi:
What?!


Hanai:
...22, 23, 24, 25! Well?

Mizutani:
Uh...

Hanai:
18 seconds?!

Ah, here Tajima's incredible, but I suck!

Abe:
Earth to Mihashi. Hello!

Mihashi:
Oh! Right! Sorry! I was...!

Abe:
I was asking you if you've been sleeping any better.

Mihashi:
Eh? Oh, oh, yes!

Abe:
Don't lie to me.
You can't get tomorrow's game out of your head, can you?
Mihashi, are you having any fun on this team?
It's obvious how nervous you were practice.
I mean, it's the 4th day of camp, and we still barely even know each other.
Seems any time I tried to talk to, you just shut me down. When I actually show some concern, you lie right to my face.

Coach told me that I tried to connect with Mihashi, so I am.
And this is what I get?

Stop crying! You're making me look like a jerk!
One more thing. When you're on the mound tomorrow, forget throwing fast and just put your pitches what I tell you to.
Otherwise, we'll lose.

Mihashi:
No matter what I say, he'll still be got pathetic.

Hanai:
(xxx)

Abe:
Nah, not so far.

Mihashi:
Why [it's/is it] so hard for me to talk.
I don't want Abe to hate me.
If he does, he'll stop giving me signs.
I'll be like junior high all over again!
Then I left Mihoshi for nothing, all of that I'm right back my start.


Mihashi:
Maybe... maybe the problem really is me.
What if I'm really no good? What if I don't have what it takes to be a pitcher?


Sakaeguchi:
Must be nice to have their own diamonds.
They even have lights.

Hanai:
Yeah, try not to crap yourself to.

Momoe:
You guys, ready to start warming up!

All:
[Right/Ready]!

Mihashi:
Oh, man. I bet everybody's gonna be here.

:
Sorry, little high!

Sakaeguchi:
'S so good!

Momoe:
For the first game at the team, they all look pretty common collected.
With one exception, of course.

Abe:
This sucks. He's losing accuracy, and it's not because he's throwing harder.
Poor guy's totally flipping out. I gotta do something.

:
Nishiura High's co-ed?
[They/Does that] mean [that/they] got a girl head coach?

:
Maybe. Hm?

Kanou:
Hey!

Abe:
Dude! Where the hell are you going?!

Hatake:
What's you yelling about?

Kanou:
I just saw Mihashi.

Hatake:
Where? Show me!

Kanou:
He went to run off toward the club house.


Mihashi:
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

Hatake:
Hey.

Mihashi:
Ha-Ha-Ha-Hatake...

Hatake:
Well, what do you know you still blubber like a nervous mess, huh?
Mihashi, why are you still pretending to be a pitcher?
And against a bunch of real players you know how bad you suck?
You know everybody on the team in Mihoshi hate you [before/for] what you did us, right?
We lost every game last season because grandpa's boy had to be a starting pitcher.
Did you think we'd already forgotten?
Or maybe you thought we forgive you, huh?!
Guess I miss my chance, I should have broken your arm last year.
I still can if you want.
Is that what would it take to get truly you?!

Abe:
Mihashi?
Hey, what's up?

Hatake:
Sup?
See you on the field, Mihashi.

Abe:
Did he threaten you? Dude!
Seriously, if that guy said he's gonna break your arm, you gotta tell someone!

Mihashi:
Hatake wanted Kanou to start instead of me.

Abe:
Huh?

Mihashi:
But I... I wouldn't give up the mound...

Abe:
What? So he wanted to break your arm for that?!

Mihashi:
No. I mean, I don't think he really would have.
But they all knew Kanou was the better pitcher.
Then they all liked him better, and they all hated me, so (xxx) Hatake was only, he was only trying to...

Abe:
Pull it together, man!
Or else there's no way you'll be able to pitch!


Momoe:
Do with Mihashi what I just did to you.
And I promise you will see a whole new side of him.


Abe:
You'll be fine, 'cause you're hell of a pitcher.

Mihashi:
No, I suck!

Abe:
No, you're good!

Mihashi:
You're lying!

Abe:
Listen to me, you're rock!

Mihashi:
Liar!

Abe:
What's this deal?
When Coach did this with me, I buckled like a little girl!


Abe:
Geez, Mihashi. Stubborn much?
I mean, I know he's nervous obviously.
His hands are all cold and clammy.
His fingers are so rough.
All those are calluses, ones from sliders, some from screwballs.
Talk about dedication.
I'm telling how many pitches he throw to earn each of these, holding his control.
He's worked his ass off. I never realized.

Mihashi:
Why am I even here? I'm not pitcher...

Abe:
I see. He's not stubborn. He just has no self-confidence.
With that much practice, Mihashi should be awesome.
With all those guys he played with middle school, they made him be like this.
He's worked so hard to be got.
But instead of trying to understand him, they seemed to demand him quitting.

Dude, you really are all right.

You are annoying, you drive me nuts, but still...

And I don't just mean as a pitcher, I like you as a person, too.
'Cause you work so hard, no matter what!

I want to do something for him.
Something that making him believe he's our ace.
Is that the catcher's role?
His hand is starting to warm up.

Mihashi:
You think... that I'm working hard? You mean...

Abe:
Yeah, I do.

Mihashi:
'Cause I... I like being a pitcher.

Abe:
I know.

Mihashi:
Yeah? I'll get better, I promise!

Abe:
And I know you will.

Mihashi:
'Cause... I wanna... win! I...

Abe:
We will win!

Mihashi:
Abe doesn't hate me.
He said that I'm working hard.
He thinks I can be a good pitcher.

I... I, uh... I like you, too!

Abe:
Uh, great. Thanks.

Did it sound like creepy when I told him that?

Cool, let's go. On the way back, you can tell me all about the batters we're up against.

Mihashi:
Sure!

Abe:
Wow, maybe he's not as complex as I thought.


Shinooka:
Wait, you're talking about me?!
No way, you have to find someone else.

:
Please don't say that. You're our only hope!

:
We're begging you!

Shinooka:
What do you think I should do, Ai?
Nobody's ever asked me to be an announcer before...


Abe:
That guy is huge.

Oda:
Hey, how ya doin'?

Abe:
Sup?

Mihashi:
Hey, there!

Oda:
Ya gotta girl in your team.
That must be nice.

Mihashi:
Uh, yeah...

Abe:
So you know that guy?

Mihashi:
Nah, uh. Why?

Abe:
He's got an accent.

Mihashi:
Oh, yeah. So?

Abe:
"So"?
Mihoshi recruits players from the West? I kind and sort of need to know about it!

Mihashi:
Well, they do have a preferred athletes program.

Momoe:
Uh-huh, look who's getting along.

Mihashi:
But they don't usually come from very far the West.

Abe:
Hey, Shinooka, let me see the list for a sec.

Shinooka:
Sure.

Mihashi:
Though, I did hear they were getting some awesome new guy this year.

Abe:
Okay, who here don't you know?

Mihashi:
Umm... The guy who's batting cleanup, and the guy's batting 6th, and 7th, then 8th, everyone else I know...

Abe:
All right, batters 4, 6, 7 and 8, but you know all the rest of them.

Mihashi:
Yeah...

Kanou:
Mihashi!

Mihashi:
That voice! It's Kanou.

Abe:
That grip... A forkball.

Tajima:
A forker?

Hatake:
Nice!

Oki:
Was that a forker?

Suyama:
Why is he throwing forkballs during the practice? Stupid show off.

Abe:
Don't worry about it. Right, Tajima?
I mean, you can hit that forkball, can't you?

Tajima:
I can hit any pitch he throws at me.
In the game situation, there's never ball I can't hit.

Hanai:
Dammit! Why's Tajima gotta be so cool?

Momoe:
So, I'm counting on you, Tajima.
This is gonna be an important game for us.

Tajima:
How important?

Momoe:
If we can pull it together and win this one, Mihashi will officially be our ace pitcher.
Now then, who wants Mihashi?!

Abe:
I do!

Momoe:
Who wants an ace?!

All:
I do!

Momoe:
Good!
Then let's win for Mihashi!

All:
Yeah!!


Hatake:
Looking good! One more!

Mihashi:
Can't believe on I'm about to pitch against Hatake and those other guys.
I can never strike any of 'em out even in practice, but now it's a real game.
If I start to give them the hits a ton, we'll lose for sure.

Abe:
Mihashi.

Mihashi:
Uh, yeah!

Abe:
I'll bat to be on deck, so I need to get my gear off, but you keep better with Izumi.
Hey, don't bother scoring.

Izumi:
Got it!

Mihashi:
Abe [said/says] we can win.

Hanai:
So if we win today, that means Mihashi is one of us, right?
'Cause he's sure not one of them, he's been even jumping as usual ever since those guys took the field.
He must really done a number on up all guy.
He acts so scared around (xxx) I never guess they used to be teammates.
Sad, really. They don't even look at him, and he's avoiding them like the plague.

Abe:
Well, as far as those guys are concerned, it cost him season.
They're still holding a grudge against him, and Mihashi thinks he deserves what he escape 'em.
Either way, Mihashi feels guilty ever what happened in middle school.
And even though he transferred and played with us now, the guilty's still effecting this game.

Suyama:
What? So that's it?
He's still feeling guilty because his pitching made them lose every game for three years straight?

Abe:
Yep.

Mizutani:
What if he's even matter if we lose the practice game (xxx) these guys?
It's not like we're facing during regular season.

Abe:
It does matter!
Stop a minute and think about what Mihashi's like right now.
All the whimpering and complaining, and defeatist attitude.
If we lose here, that's where we're stuck with, and we end up losing the game that's supposed to win! Right?!

All:
Right...

Abe:
Mihashi's only like this for one reason, and it's those jerks over there in their black shirts.
I don't care sure Mihashi may not unnecessarily handle the situation the way he should have.
But he's on our team now. And we can't have its old teammates bringing down our starting pitcher.
So if we win today, maybe Mihashi can start to get past all that.
(xxx) ever gonna be the pitcher I know it can be, we have to win, for his sake.

Hanai:
I had not really planned on losing to begin with, but I promise to bring my A game.
If what you're saying is true, this isn't just the practice game.
It's more than that is, it's like a battle for the future of our starting pitcher, right?

Abe:
Mm-hm.

Sakaeguchi:
When coach asked us if we want Mihashi for our ace, I said I did, but I didn't really understand.
But now then, I'm totally with you.

Suyama:
Yeah.

Tajima:
Me too.
It is so on!

Sakaeguchi:
Those jerks want no one hit him!

Momoe:
Abe's finally starting to come around.
And he's right, I did want this game to be a turning point for Mihashi.
But what happens here today could do more for the whole team than even I imagined.

Sakaeguchi:
Can't wait to tell Mihashi what Abe just said about him.
It's bound to make him feel better.
Maybe it'll be enough to get him over his nerves.
Easy bat, let's get to win first.
I'll try for a drag bunt on the first pitch.


Shinooka:
Batting first.

Sakaeguchi:
Hey.

Kanou:
Mihashi's team.

Umpire:
Let's play ball!

Sakaeguchi:
The gap's open.
Here goes!

Hatake:
Third!

Abe:
That's it!

Mizutani:
Perfect bunt!

Umpire:
Out!

Sakaeguchi:
Thought I laid that down right in front of third, stupid pitcher [snared/snagged] it.

Mizutani:
Hey, is that a guy who couldn't start 'cause Mihashi wouldn't give up the mound?
He's gotta great arm.

Abe:
I guess so.

Suyama:
For someone without any starting experience, he's sure playing it cool.

Oki:
Swung late!

Umpire:
You're out!

Hatake:
That's two!

:
One more! /Two down! /(xxx)!

Shinooka:
Now on, the catcher, Abe.

Abe:
Two outs, nobody on.
Thought Mihashi was too worried about this guy, but maybe not.

Umpire:
Strike!

Abe:
Around 120 kilometers-in-hour, I guess.
Not bad first ball for a freshman.

(second):
Attaboy, Kanou! Nice pitching there, buddy!

Abe:
Crap! Kanou worked hard up.

Umpire:
Strike!

Abe:
He's (xxx) all our strikes, and he's not shaking off the signs.
Let me guess, intentional ball next?

Umpire:
Ball!

Momoe:
2 outs, 2 strikes.
Forker's coming.

Umpire:
Strike three!

Abe:
And he's got that money pitch!
Fine, so he's a good pitcher, but I've gotten hits off better.
Next time is mine.

Mihashi:
Uh, Abe. Here we go.

Abe:
Uh, thanks.

Mihashi:
Hey, let me get your shin guards for you.

Abe:
Hey.
I know what you're doing and I can still see you.
Besides, there's nowhere to hide once you're upon the mound.

Tajima:
Let's go!


[trailer]

Shinooka:
The practice game against Mihoshi Academy has finally under way.
Mihashi had a hard time shaking his pre-game (xxx).
But he got out of the first inning without giving up hit.
He even struck out two of the three batters he faced. Great job, Mihashi, but you're not out of the woods yet!
In this second inning, Tajima gets a piece of one of Kanou's forkballs for stand-up double.
After that, Hanai's got it sights set on the RBI.
Next time on, "Big Windup!", "The Play."
Let's keep those bats swinging, guys!
