Man:
What exactly have you been doing this whole time?

Woman:
I've been here, the one place you're too busy for! I take care of her! By myself!

Man:
Do you know how much these hospital bills are?

Rico:
Because of my sickness, my parents argue constantly. They try to do right. Follow the doctor's orders.
And, 'sign away on seventeen separate documents.'
I've heard that one a lot.

I had never left that hospital room once in my whole life.
But then on my birthday two years ago.
I got a new body and now I'm free to move however I want to.

Henrietta:
Good morning, Rico.

Rico:
Oh, good morning.

Henrietta:
I was about to do my laudry. Your wanna com with?

Rico:
Yeah.
I really like my new lif here at the agency. Everyone here is so nice
As long as I follow the rules and do like I'm told, I know they'll keep being nice.
It's the ... It's like...
The quiet morning air and the smell of fresh laundry detergent comong across it.
The sky and the clouds and the sun. And my own body.
No matter how hard you look, you just can't find any of thos things in a hospital bed.

Triela:
Henrietta, do youknow what our schedule is today?

Henrietta:
I think we're trainng at the outdoor shooting range later.

Triela:
Sounds fun.

Henrietta:
I thought that you didn't like shooting practice.

Triela:
Anything is better than sitting through another one of Hilshire's boring lectures.
"Triela. Page 36." "Begin from shylock's lin, please."

Rico:
I don't get what you mean, but it's fun to sit and watch.
There's still so much I don't know. It's interesting.

Triela:
Yes, you're interested in everything. We know, RIco.
So, Henrietta, do you have any favorite classes so far?

Clae:
How about music?
If I'm not mistaken, I've heard you around playing a violing.
Have you always liked the violin?
Did you ask for lessons?

Henrietta:
Not really. I like it, but Jose suggested it. He got sort of mad at me.

Triela:
So, even though you never asked, he's pushing violin lessons on you?

Henrietta:
Not pushing. I do really like playing the violin.

Triela:
I didn't mean it like that. Jose thinks the world of you, Henrietta.

Henrietta:
Do you think so?

-:
That was terrible.
Don't just listen to me, hear what I have to say.
You need to be more flexible.

Rico:
Yes, sir.

-:
Now, fire 10 second bursts.

Hilshire:
Raise your arms higher and line up the front sight with the rear.
Only when you have your line of sight do you fire.

-:
Hilshire, you're not actually trying to instruct Triela are you?

Hilshire:
Not much. She always fares better on her own.

-:
With a brother like you, what choice does she have?

Hilshire:
Speaking of, whrere's Angelica?

-:
Her implants aren't functioning well, so I'm letting her rest.
She'll be out of commission for a while during recalibration.

Hilshire:
How about some news on our next job?

-:
Some hot shot politician. He made an inquiry regarding personal business.

Hilshire:
Of course, that's just great.
I don't want these girls wasting their talents on meaningless jobs.

-:
Telling them to kill the bad guys and flush out the Republican Faction's safehouses is one thing.
Personal business, that's something else.

Hilshire:
Anyway, sounds like a job for Special Ops Section One, Not us.


-:
That's just the problem. This politician is big supporter of all of us over here in Cybernetics Section Two.
We have to say yes.
Hilshire:
You should always be warried about those who favor you for no reason.
Jose:
Lose your footing during the real thing, and you're dead.
Rico:
Yes, sir.
-:
We'll be there assembled and on time, sir. Out.
Jose. We have a date for the next mission.
You're gonna have to put a hold on your training.
-:
Jean, if you'd run down the plan for us...
-:
Thank you sir.
This is the mark, Congressman Mascart of the Radical Party.
Our mission commences one week from today at the Villa Gadd Hotel, where the Congressman will be staying.
Before each session of Parliament, he and his secretaries set up here and scour over documents nearly 24/7.
He's staying in room number two on the third floor.
So, we've booked all of the other rooms on that floor anonymously.
You don't have to worry about anyone coming up during the operation.
The details are here, but if you have questions, now's the time.
Jose:
Jean, is this mission what our congressman asked us to do?
-:
Yes.
-:
I've been told he and Mascart oppose each other in regards to the amendment of the Conrad Act.
-:
Mascart is very vocal in his criticism of terrorism, so we have plenty of options when it comes to placing the blame.
Hilshire and Marco, you two gather our teams and prep for departure.
-:
We're on top of it.
-:
Hey, Ferro. It almost seems like Mascart's a criminal in all of this.
-:
There's no "almost" about it. He is a criminal.
-:
Which you don't seem to have a problem with, Ferro.
Haven't you ever heard the term "love thy neighbor".
-:
Where in your little saying does it tell you that they're gonna love us back?
-:
You've got no sense of romance.
-:
Maybe you should teach her.
-:
Ha, ha. Very funny.
-:
Here's the plan, Rico. The mark is staying in that hotel across the street.
After a successful assassination, they'll find hair and footprints.
This will lead them back to the Republican Faction.
Today's a survey.
We'll check inside later.
Rico:
Right.
-:
But for now, I want you to go and check out the back entrance.
Tell me what you see.
-:
Can I help you with something?
You know this area out here is for employees only.
Do you work here?
Rico:
Uh-uh, I don't. I was just...
-:
Oh, yeah. I get it. Your were looking for a place to play your instrument.
What is it that your're carrying? A violin, right?
Rico:
Um, yeah.
-:
Your can play it right here if you want to. I'd love to hear.
What kind of songs do you like to play?
Rico:
I, uh... I can't play.
-:
Uh? Why not?
Rico:
I'm not any good and I don't really know any songs.
-:
So, you're not a musician yet.
You're still an apprentice, like me at the hotel.
My name is Emilio. What's your name?
Rico:
Rico.
Emilio:
Weird. I thought that was a boy's name.
But, in a cool way, it does kind of suit you.
I use to know a boy named Rico.
Rico:
This boy seems to like talking nicely to me.
I wonder if all boys are like this one.
Emilio:
And there's this other Rico...
Rico:
I'm not sure what I should say to him. I'm nervous.
Emilio:
...he just kinda up and left me.
So now, it's up to me to make it on my own in this world.
Rico:
I see.
Emilio:
So, I told you about my dad. What does your dad do for a living?
Rico:
Uh... He's probably with the city's waterworks bureau or something.
Emilio:
Probably? You mean the two of you don't live together?
Rico:
No, I've been on my own for a couple of years now.

Emilio:
Oh, you must live in one of those dormitories that they have at the good schools.
Rico:
Well, uh... It's something like that.
Emilio:
Don't you ever get lonely there, never being able to see your mother or father?
Rico:
No, it's not that bad. I have some friends there.
Emilio:
Friends are good.
Man:
She's taking her time.
Man:
Yep. She's incapable of doing anything by herself.
Emilio:
So then I just told Daniel right to his face, I said ``I may be just a poor kid now, but someday I'll make it big and laugh at all of you!".
That's what I said, I couldn't believe it.
Rico:
Emilio?
Emilio:
Yeah?
Rico:
You should get back to work. You've been out here a while.
Emilio:
Is something wrong?
