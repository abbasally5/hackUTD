Jose:
Don't make a move until I've determined that the mark is inside.

Henrietta:
Yes, Jose.

Jose:
If I don't ID this guy, then we walk out of here, quietly.

Henrietta:
OK.

Jose:
Good morning, sir. I apologize for intruding like this. Do you have a minute?

Louie:
No. What do you want?

Jose:
Just a few moments of your time. I am a reporter from Libero Italia.

Louie:
What is you're reporting?

Jose:
I heard that Mr.Scallo of the Costelo Company was here. And, I would love to get an exclusive.

Louie:
Yeah well, there ain't nobody here by that name. So, good luck finding your interview.

Jose:
Wait. I'm positive that he's in this building.

Louie:
And I told you that you got the wrong room, chief. You're hard of hearing?

Jose:
No.

Louie:
Then maybe it's a learning disorder. Your guy ain't here!
Jose:
Sorry I ...

Louie:
Now, get lost before I pop your eyes out and make your sister watch!

Man-3:
Louie, what's going on?

Boss:
Hey! Throw your grenade!

Jean:
Take him.

Jean:
Let's pack up and go home.

Man-4:
I got like two tons of rebar I need it hauled all the way...

Jose:
Now you've done it. Ferro... The mission has failed. I repeat, mission has failed.

Ferro:
Roger. We're on our way.

Jose:
Yeah.
Henrietta, why did you lose control?

Henrietta:
Uh ...

Jose:
This isn't like you. I've never seen you lose it like that.
Your arm's been hit. Are you OK?

Henrietta:
Yes.

Jose:
Let's go.

Jean:
Right.

Henrietta:
Jose.

Jose:
Is your arm hurting?

Henrietta:
I only... I just wanted to help you, Jose.

Jose:
We'll have a doctor take a look at that arm as soon as we get back.

Jose:
Officially, the Social Welfare Agency is a government-sponsored corporation that's in the business of saving lives.
At least that's the ruse. In reality it's an agency on the fringe of technology. They give terminal patients another shot at life using cybernetic implants. This conditioning process then shapes the patient into an efficient machine for handling all of the government's dirty work.

Jose:
How's she coming along? Do you think you'll be able to fix her, doctor?

Doctor:
The damage was minimal. The bullet shaved off some skin and artificial muscle tissue. We won't need to replace the arm.

Jose:
That's good to hear.

Doctor:
Don't misunderstand. She'll need surgery every time she sustains injuries. The conditioning process takes a huge toll on their bodies. If she continues to suffer damage, she, or any of units for that matter, could grow dependant on the reconstruction process or suffer from severe memory dysfunction.

Jose:
So, you're saying...

Doctor:
Any of our implants can be replaced with little effort. They're designed that way. But their impact on the brain and other living tissue is substantial. What happened out there today, anyway? People are saying she lost it, ignored her orders, and spun out of control.

Jose:
I don't know. She claims she killed those people to protect me.

Doctor:
That's a little disturbing. Sounds like a lost cause if you ask me.

Jean:
Jose, I know you're fond of this girl. Your think she's special somehow. So, don't you think you should increase her level of conditioning? I mean, treating a cyborg assassin like a normal little girl? Come on, that just doesn't seem natural.

Jose:
Children brought into the agency undergo what they call 'conditioning' in addition to their physical modifications.
Fortunately for her, the conditioning erased any and all memories of her past, good and bad.
Henrietta, let's go.

Henrietta:
Coming

Ferro:
It's nothing. Just fill out the location and the reason for the trip. And, just sign here.

Jose:
OK.

Jean:
A day pass?

Jose:
Yeah.

Jean:
Where's your field trip headed?

Jose:
Oh. just around. Anything else?

Jean:
The pomodoro there is superb.

Jose:
Today you learn that not only must you study and train for work but you also have to learn how to act properly in the outside world, to blend in.

Henrietta:
Yes.

Jose:
When you drink tea, hold the saucer close to the cup so it doesn't rattle.

Henrietta:
Yes.

Jose:
Henrietta! Let go of him and take your seat.

Henrietta:
Yes sir.

Jose:
Are your all right? I'm terribly sorry. I hope this helps.

Man:
Uh, thanks.

Jose:
Now, if you don't mind, cancel the grappa and bring out dessert.

Man:
Yes sir. Yes sir.

Henrietta:
Did I do something wrong again?

Jose:
Let's just continue with our meal, shall we?

Henrietta:
OK.

Jose:
As time passed, I began to put in more effort with Henrietta.
Now pay attention. Todo a job, any job, you have to learn many different things. Every successful job is just the completion of many smaller, simpler tasks. I'm going to start giving you notes to study each day.

Henrietta:
OK.

Jose:
Make sure the muzzle doesn't stick out over the edge, stay down as low as you can, and if your rifle doesn't have a bipod, then you grip that barrel tight with your bracing hand.
Anything closer than 600 meters, you aim for the head. Anything past 600, aim for the center of the body.

Henrietta:
What?

Jose:
Take a look at the sky. See that little dot by that cloud? Can you tell me what that is?

Henrietta:
No, sir. Sorry.

Jose:
How about a guess? Come on, anything will do. Who knows? Maybe it's a magic pixie.

Henrietta:
Is it a airplane?

Jose:
That's a good answer. In wars past, plenty of people mistook that light for a plane. But what if it were night right now?
What would you think then?

Henrietta:
Star?

Jose:
Close. It's the planet Venus, not far from Earth's orbit. Mke sure you don'nt look directly at the sun with that thing.
Of course, we'd probably need something a bit more powerful if we were going to shoot a Venusian in the head.

Henrietta:
Jose? You know everything, don't you?

Docter:
Are you awake? No bath. No baths until that skin on your arm takes hold. What's the matter? You have bad dream?

Henrietta:
I don't think I know. The tears just started pouring out of nowhere.

Triela:
Henrietta. Rico just told me! You flipped your lid out there today.

Henrietta:
I couldn't control it. I just snapped. Triela, I don't know what to do.

Triela:
Don't sweat it. Hey, I know! We can go have a drink in clae's room.

Henrietta:
A drink?

Triela:
Yeah. She's got the best tea, and I swear she puts magic in her cakes.
You just wanted to make him proud of you. That's all.

Henrietta:
Yeah, I guess so.

Clae:
But Triela, isn't that the only thing any of can do? We all seek approval.
And if I were him, that kink of devotion would make me feel uncomfortable.
Hey, but it's okey. "Have fun while you're still young," that's what I always say.

Triela:
Is that so? I thought that was from TV.

Clae:
No, those are my own words.

Jose:
Henrietta, are you in there?

Henrietta:
Come in, please.

Jose:
So, how's that arm of yours doing?

Henrietta:
Fine. It still feels kind of heavy, and I'm not used to it, but it's going to work.

Jose:
I'd like you to join me on the roof of the main building.

Henrietta:
Okay, I will.

Jose:
It's cold out, so put this on.

Henrietta:
Um, are you sure that I'm allowed to accept this?

Jose:
I'll be waiting for you on the roof.
Glad you could make it.
Come check this out.

Henrietta:
What's that? A telescope?

Jose:
Isn't she beautiful?
I wanted to be able to show you the stars, and not through a rifle scope.

Henrietta:
This is ... This is the first time I've seen stars. What made you do this?

Jose:
I haven't seen a better night for stargazing in a very long time.
And, it's your reward for all your hard work today.

Henrietta:
You're not angry? About today?

Jose:
Do you want me to be?
Take a look. Orion's bright tonight.

Henrietta:
In Greek mythology, Orion was mistakenly killed by his love, the goddes Artemis.
Sticken with grief over her love's death, she carried Orion's body high into the sky on her silver moon chariot.
And, she left him in the darkest place in the heavens where he would shine the brightest.
Such a sad story.

Henrietta:
Jose, you know everything, don't you?

Jose:
Yeah, Yeah I do.
