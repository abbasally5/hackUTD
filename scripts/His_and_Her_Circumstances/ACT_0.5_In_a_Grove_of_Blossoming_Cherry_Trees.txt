  Yukino:
Yukino Miyazawa’s morning starts early.
She is very disciplined like a monk training on Mt. Kouya.
She doesn’t waste a moment.
She spends most of time studying.

Arima:
Cool!

Yukino:
Wow!
An electric eel.
When we were feeling really lovey-dovey, we forget about studying and go out just fun all day.
But we’ve started studying again.
I’m working hard to prove that we can be together and get good grades at same time.
That’s a xxx anyway.
Actually, I’m working this hard because Arima’s score was so much better than mine.
Even though he was goofing off too.
Time to get up!
Get up xxxx.
Xxxxx.
Come on!
Still asleep, huh.
Ah, it looks like angelic when they are asleep.

Tsukino:
That’s disgusting!

Kano:
What did you do that for so early in the morning!

Yes, but it was effective.
You two are finally out of bed now.
And I have just a bit of family-loving playful person in me.

Family:
Let’s eat!

Father&Tsukino&Kano:
See you later!

Mother:
Oh, Yuki.
What about school?

Yukino:
Huh?
There’s no school today.
They’re having make-up exams.
I’m going over to Arima’s after I eat lunch.
I’ll make sure do laundry before I go.

Mother:
Ahh, it’s not fair that Yuki’s so perfect.

Yukino:
I’m leaving now!
I used to be a perfect daughter.
But then, I met Arima.
Arima is very special to me.
I’d always tried to be perfect and taken care of everything myself.
It didn’t matter who I was with.
I had to do everything right.
But Arima is different.
He is my equal.
I can truly depend on him.

Arima:
Miyazawa, you wanna come over on make-up day?
I’ve only got club in the moring.

Yukino:
I’d love to.

Arima:
There’ll be nobody home that day.

Right, oh my God.
That’s right.
What exactly did he mean by that!?
This is bad.
This is really, really bad!
Yeah, right.
He probably didn’t mean anything.
I’m totally reading xxx this.

Arima:
Hey, I was just taking a shower.
Come on in.

Yukino:
Sh… shower!?
No, it can’t be!
Not Arima!
He just wanted to get cleaned up after club!
Yeah, cleaned up.
Oh, but he seems kind of different today.
He looks so…
No!
He’ll never…
But it could gonna be just two of us in a big house alone.
And he is a healthy young man.
Anything could happen!
I feel exhausted already.

Asapin:
Here you go, Souichirou.
Vegetable ramen.
Hot foods are good for you, especially in the summer.

Arima:
Stop acting like a house wife.

Asapin:
Miyazawa, take a seat and have yourself.
Have some wheat tea.

Arima:
She is my guest!

Asapin:
What do you thing?
Am I good at cook xxx?
What’s with you?
It’s delicious!

Arima:
It tastes bad because a man made it.

Asapin:
Cooks and chefs are men too, you know!

Arima:
There’s a big difference between them and you.

Yukino:
But I guess you don’t play around as much as I thought.
You didn’t have to go back to school for make-up day today.

Asapin:
Huh?
Make-up day?
What’s that?
I failed most of mine.

Arima:
Yo… Yo…You idiot!
This isn’t the time to be making ramen!

Yukino:
I’m surprised you even got accepted to our school!

It’s not too late!
Go to school right now!

What?
I can go to school xxxx like this?

Arima:
Just go!

Asapin:
I’ll buy some jelly on the way back!

Arima:
Hurry up and go!
Sorry about that.
He is a freak.

Yukino:
I don’t mind.

Arima:
Wanna go to my room?

Yukino:
Sure.
Hahaha, got you, Arima!

Arima:
Xxxxx
Miyazawa, you go on ahead.
Now I’ll bring something to drink.

Yukino:
You know, we act like little kids.
I thought he was gonna kiss me.
We are together a lot, there isn’t much of what can be called progress.
Even kisses.
We did it once, but nothing since.
I wonder how this will work out.
Oh, well.
Hey, there are books scattered all over the place.
Must be Asapin.
“Romance of Three Kingdoms”
“Xinag Yu and Liu Bang”
So Arima likes historical novels.
That’s so cute.
Shiba. Ikenami.

Arima:
Hey there.
What’s up?

Yukino:
These books!

Arima:
Oh, you wanna borrow some of them?
Miyazawa, what kinds of books do you read?

Yukino:
“Fortune.”

Yukino:
Oh, come to think of it!

Arima:
Huh?

Yukino:
It’s the first time we’re at one of our house and we’re not studying.

Arima:
Oh, now that you mentioned it, you’re right.

Yukino:
Your room’s so big.
And it’s got air conditioning.
You’re so lucky.

Arima:
Yo… You think so?

Yukino:
Morning practice must be hard!

Huh?
Well, yes sorta.
The captain’s a morning person, so…

Yukino:
Oh, I see.

Arima:
Yeah, that’s right.

Yukino:
Oh, I see.

Arima:
Yeah.

Yukino:
You know what!

Arima:
Huh?
Miyazawa, I’ve been thinking.
It seems like you want more attention.
Am I right?

Yukino:
Actually.

Arima:
All right!
I’ll pay attention to you!

Yukino:
Wow, ouch!
I always feel like I’m showing more of my emotions than you are.
You’re so cool and calm and collected.
I feel like I’m the only one being affection.
You don’t love me enough to show how you feel.

Arima:
What?
I can’t believe you said that!
That’s from someone more concerned about the grades than about me?

Yukino:
Oops, that was a sore spot.

Arima:
You’re wrong about me.

Yukino:
Uh-oh, is he mad now?
This is bad.
I was only kidding.

Arima:
So do you want me to show you?
Show you how much I love you?
I feel like sometimes I can’t control my feelings for you.
I never showed it before because I didn’t want to risk scaring you.

Yukino:
Could it be… that this is…

Arima:
You wanna know, Miyazawa?
You wanna know?

Yukino:
Provocation.
Right now, we’re balanced on a very fine line.
The thinnest possible thread of emotion.
Ye… Yes.
This was different in every way compared to the only kiss we’d shared before.
I felt like my heart would fly away somewhere.
I could feel Arima’s presence all around me.

Arima:
What is it, Miyazawa?
I’ll walk you home.

Yukino:
It’s okay.
I’ll take the bus.
I’m all flushed and I need to cool down.

Arima:
Huh, okay.

Yukino:
Thanks.

Arima:
Sorry about making you flushed.
Well, see you tomorrow then.

Yukino:
Yeah, see you tomorrow.
Today was kind of weird, I guess.
But, I’ve become closer to Arima now.
In this way, our time together grows.
And love between us strengthens.
I’m home!

Family:
Let’s eat!

Yukino:
Oh, this is Heaven.
Heaven.
Good night everyone.

Tsukino:
Sis…

Kano:
What are you, in grade school!?
 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:0:&lt;h6&gt; 

Arima:
It was before I’d met you.
Shoot!
It’s fifth period!
It was spring.
I hadn’t been a freshman for very long.
It was April.
I was still alone.

I’m sorry.
I fell asleep just a second in.

Teacher:
Well, you’re the man who just represented the incoming freshmen.
What sorts of example are you setting?
You get to clean up the equipment today.

Student:
You’re covered in cherry blossom petals.

Arima:
Oh, this?
There’s a row of trees across the river.

Student:
Hmm?

Arima:
I went there during lunch break.

Student:
I had no idea.

Arima:
I ate lunch there and read a book.
It was so comfortable I fell asleep.

Students:
Oh, come on, Arima.
You should have invited us along too.
Not fair! Not fair!

Arima:
Sorry.

Student:
I’ve got an idea!
Let’s go see the flowers as a class.
Hey, sounds good.
Get some snacks and stuff.
Hey, let’s make a party!
Hey, Arima, you’ll come along, too, right?

Arima:
Huh?
Oh, sounds good.

Students:
All right.
It’s decided then.
If Arima’s going, I’m going too.

Yukino:
Arima:
You don’t have to do that.
I have clean up duty today.

Arima:
Miss Miyazawa, it’s okay.
It’s my own fault.
I’ll do it.

Yukino:
Really?
But I feel bad.

Arima:
Her name is Yukino Miyazawa.
She became a class representative this month along with me.
She’s got a big sister air about her.
She’s dependable and she’s really good with her schoolwork.
She does the committee work quickly and skillfully.
She’s an intelligent and mature person.
Miss Miyazawa.
Are those all the print outs from this moring?
I’ll do half.

Yukino:
Oh, thank you.
But I did them already.

Arima:
What ?
You did all this by yourself?

Yukino:
Yeah, I had time so I…

I’m sorry.
I had club this morning, so I couldn’t make it.

Yukino:
No, it’s okay.
Don’t worry about it.
You helped me clean up, so thank you.

Arima:
Miss Miyazawa’s amazing, you know?
She’s so considered.
She seems almost perfect.
It made me realize that people like her really exist in this world.

Students:
What!?
What are you talking about, Arima?
You just describe yourself, Arima.

Arima:
Huh?

Students:
First in this class!
Excellent at sports!
Good looks!
Good personality!
And on top of that, you’re really popular.
You’re so perfect!
Why are you so amazed by someone else!?
You really xxx clueless.
Xxxxx

Arima:
I haven’t done anything stand out.

Students:
You stand out just by being here!
You and Miss Miyazawa are like twin stars.
Yeah, yeah!
All the girls are after you.
They can’t stop talking about you.
It’s unbelievable.
All those girls can think of is you!
Don’t you get, you idiot?
Yeah, man, it really pisses me off!
We had every right to be upset about it, you know?
That’s right.
You’re a really lucky one.
Unlike us, you’re really…

Arima:
A beautiful world.
There was always a peaceful atmosphere around me.

Teacher:
So Arima, are you feeling into your high school classes?

Arima:
Yes, sir. Somehow.

Teacher:
You’re such an excellent student, Arima.
You xxx joy to teach.
All the teachers think you’re wonderful.

Arima:
I’m so sorry.
I’m late.
I’ll get ready right away.
Okay, well, don’t push yourself.

Students:
Captain, you’re going easy on Arima again!
And you’re always so hard on us!

Captain:
Shuddup!
Arima’s in the class committee.

Students:
Arima, could you show me this part?
Let’s play soccer!

Arima:
Every day was fun and I thought I was happy.
But every once in a while, I’d hear a voice, just for a moment.
“Are you really having fun?”
There was that cold voice inside me.
Like ice that wouldn’t melt.
And so, the days would go by.
Peaceful, unchanging, tranquil days.

Arima:
I’m soory.

Girl:
Um, do you have anyone you’re going out with right now?
What I mean is…

Girl:
Do you have anyone you like?
Because she likes you.

Girl:
I love you.
Arima!
I love you!

Arima:
What was it?
I felt that something was wrong.
I felt that this peacefulness had something artificial to it.
Laughing, surrounded by my classmates, there were times I’d suddenly feel that everyone was far away.
That I’d get scared.
Because I’d think that maybe I wasn’t actually feeling anything.
Even when I’m laughing, even when I’m being rowdy with my friends…
Maybe I’m just sliding along the surface of my feelings.
So that nothing have really touched me.
Even when girls confessed their feeling for me, it didn’t touch me.
In my heart, there’s a suspicion that I can’t erase.
A suspicion that I’m always alone.
That maybe I don’t really have anyone that I can call a friend.
In reality, I’ve always been alone…
In me, there was always this worry.
Why do I think such things?
I’m supposed to be blessed with more gifts than most people.
And so…the days would go by.
Those peaceful, unchanging, tranquil days.
Those days I felt completely empty.

Yukino:
Well, now we just need to copy them?

Arima:
Hmm, I’m tired.

Yukino:
Of course, because you’re so busy all the time.

Arima:
You must be busy too, with studies and the class committee.

Yukino:
Yeah, but I already accepted that this is the way things are.
I’ve always worked this hard, so I’m used to it.

Arima:
So, you are class rep material, too, huh?
I don’t know why, but the class always seems to pick me to do that sort of work.
Did you only apply xxxx to Hokuei?

Yukino:
Yeah, why do you ask?

Arima:
You’re really smart.
I was wondering if you applied to a private school

Yukino:
No.
My parents have two more kids after me.
And I won’t spend their money on my education.
I don’t wanna put any financial burden on my parents.
And I want to study all that I can within those limits.
Having a goal like that when I study makes me want to work even harder.

Arima:
You’re so mature.

Yukino:
I only think that way because my family doesn’t have that much money.
If we had more to spare, I would have like to go to a private school.
They have different courses.
It sounds fun.
What about you, Arima?

Arima:
What?

Yukino:
Your parents run a hospital, don’t they?
I think it’s more surprising that you’d go to a public school than me.

Arima:
That’s true.
But my reasons are the same as yours, I guess.

Yukino:
I guess we’re both being responsible.

Arima:
It made an impact on me.
I realized for the first time that the girls next to me was strong independent and that she had clear, unhesitating eyes.
That she decided everything for herself, made her own choices, and know exactly how she wanted to live her life,
She was so very different from me.
Her profile made a strong impression.
I want to know her.
I want to know what she’s thinking.
I want to hear about so many things.
Does she have worries and hesitations, too?
Does she feel the loneliness that I carry within me?
I want to know.
More and more.
“After school. At the row of cherry blossom trees.”
On a calm spring day like this.
How xxx I refuse her?
Something within me was trying to change.
Um…
What?
Miss Miyazawa… cares for me?
I’m so happy!
Uh, um…

Girl:
I uh…

Arima:
Huh?

Girl:
I’m sorry. I’m late.
Please forgive me.

Yukino:
Oh, were you waiting for someone?
I’m sorry.
I didn’t mean to disturb you.

Arima:
Huh!?
I.. I thought it…
I’m... I’m sorry.
At that moment, I realized that I loved her.
I want to catch her.
I want her to look at me.
I want that girl with those clear eyes to look at me.
My feelings overflowed.
I’d never wanted anything so much.
The April breeze sends the flower petals dancing towards the sky.
Under the cherry blossom trees in full bloom, for the first time, I fell in love.
She seemed like just an intelligent, pretty girl, but soon afterwards, I discovered her secret identity.
And I was to follow an unexpected path, but that’s just how life goes sometimes.
I have no regrets.
I think life is good.
Yeah.

A synopsis of what’s to come!
Sis is lovey-dovey with Arima.
She’s had her second kiss as well.
But a crisis was awaiting her.
Oh, the time’s finally come to pay for everything good that’s happened!
Next time, His and Hers: Atonement For Postponed Debts.
