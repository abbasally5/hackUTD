  Vanity, vanity, the queen of vanity.

This is how I, Yukino Miyazawa, met Souichirou Arima.

How we fell in love.

How we spent the days together.

This is my life and Arima's.

This is what happened during five months in our young life.
“The Story So Far (Part One )”
Hokuei! Fight ya, fight ya, fight ya!

Hokuei! Fight ya, fight ya, fight ya!
Good morning, Miss Miyazawa.
Oh well, good morning, Arima.

Gah, Arima!
You're always so early.
Not at all, look at you.

Man, l just had to run into this guy first thing in the morning.

But my impregnable mask won't crumble at a thing like this.
I have club practice, so I came early.
You're in the kendo club, right?

Practice must be really hard.
Yeah. We start at six in the morning and go until eight in the evening.
That much?!

And you still manage to keep up with your studies, so you must work really hard.

You're amazing.
Ah, yeah...
I wonder what he's so embarrassed about.
You're pretty smart and dependable yourself, Miss Miyazawa.

You're good at working for the class committee and things like that.

It’s amazing that people like you exist.

It showed me how big the world is and how small a world I used to live in was.
No, I'm not that special...

Foolish Arima.

The nice partner in front of you is the woman who’ll soon send you to Hell.
I finally solved it.
What? I don't understand this part.

Hey, Arima, could you show me this part?
Yeah, sure.

On this part, here you use the solutions to the discriminant and the quadratic.

Like this, see?
Oh, I see now.
Arima, show us, too!

While we're at it, let's set up a group and do it.

Good idea, let's put the desks together.

Let's do it! Let's do it!
So, don’t throw with your hands, but use your knees as much as possible, like this.,
Hey, Arima's playing a match!

Come look!
What?! I wanna watch! I wanna watch!
He got a goal just now!

He was cool!

I heard Arima takes on seniors in the kendo club.

Really? Our school's kendo club is good, right?

Yup.

And he looks good in the kendo uniform.

He's so cool!

You're so cool, Arima!
Well then, so... The infIection of ''tamae''...

Arima.
Yes, ma'am.

It indicate humility and it is a Shimonidan conjugation?
What about ''mashika''?
An ''if only'' statement and a perfective adverb.
Yes, very good.
I used to be the one that everyone noticed and I was the one the teacher trusted, until now.

Dammit!

If it weren't for him, everyone would've paid attention to me, only me!

Cold! It's cold! To be buried as an average person...

I want to be praised, acknowledged, and noticed by everyone!

Dammit!

You're an eyesore, Arima!

Just you watch.

I’m gonna be the one to send you straight to Hell
