Due to various circumstances, the opening animation attached to Act 7 will be omitted.
Please take note of this.

A synopsis of what’s happened.
The time: Around now.
The place: Somewhere in Kawasaki City in Kanagawa Prefecture
This tale begins in a completely normal town.
The main character of this tale, Yukino Miyazawa (HS Freshman), is pretty, gifted with both looks and intelligence, and leads a life above reproach.
She seemed just as if she was educated and cultured.
But in actuality, showing off was her greatest purpose in life.
She was actually a masked woman who acted out the perfect model student only in public.
And on a certain sunny Sunday, due to a stupid, infinitely careless mistake, the truth became known to Souichirou Arima (HS Freshman).
Using her weakness, he trapped her into his scheme of making her do his work.
But, after all sorts of things happened, she got pissed off and the plan was set back.
But the reason for the plot was actually for him to have an excuse to talk to her.
When this became clear, the two made peace.
Since then, having obtained new friendship, new experiences, etc, things seemed to be going their way.
And then…

 Tsukino:
Souichirou Arima got the top score on the entrance exam to school.

Kano:
Yukino Miyazawa later got the top score on her midterms.

Tsukino:
They lead a separate and high profile existence.

Kano:
Everyone thought that these two would be bitter rivals both fighting for top grades in their class.

Tsukino:
But to everyone’s immense surprise, these two were actually in love.

ACT 7.0 Their Estrangement

Yukino:
Hey come on. Be quiet, you guys.
It’s Sunday.
You’ll disturb the neighbors.

Tsukino:
Sorry, sis. But we can’t help it.
We haven’t gone out with you so long.

Kano:
I’m so happy! I’m so happy! I’m so happy!

Yukino:
That’s true.
Ever since high school started, I haven’t paid much attention to you.
Those two are so cute when they get excited.
I need to hang out with them more often.

Kano:
Hey you!

Tsukino:
Yeah!

Arima:
Hi good to see you.

Yukino:
Sorry to bother you on a weekend.

Arima:
I don't know.
My parents are out today, so come on in.
Hi there.

Tsukino&Kano:
Um, ya,…er hi.
This is our older brother.

Arima:
And what are they gonna do with sunflowers?

Yukino:
They’re both in animal committee at school.
They’re breeding hamsters right now so my sisters are gonna grow sunflowers this summer and feed the seeds to the babies.
It’s really nice of you to let us borrow you yard like this.
Our yard is too crowded.
There are sunflowers everywhere.

Arima:
It’s no problem.
Middle school sounds like fun.

Kano:
Come on, Peropero.
Here boy.

Yukino:
Ah! Asapin!

Asaba:
Yo! How are you doing, babe?

Yukino:
Oh please.
What are you doing here?
You look like a pimp!

Arima:
He slept over here last night.

Asaba:
Last night Arima and I slept together.

Arima:
In the same room.

Asaba:
Arima was completely indecent last night.

Arima:
The only thing indecent is in your mind.
Tsukino, Kano, this guy is kinda dangerous.
So stay away from him, okay?

Asaba:
Arima!

Tsukino&Kano:
Okay!

Asaba:
You wanna dig here too?

Tsukino:
I was just wondering.
Are you naked under that thing?

Arima:
Miyazawa.
How were your finals?

Yukino:
Well, actually I didn’t do that well.

Arima:
I was just wondering.
I didn’t do that well either.

Yukino:
Oh, really!?

Arima:
We've both been goofing off a lot.

Yukino:
Yeah, but I think that’s okay, don’t you.
I mean we knew we were goofing off and not studying as much.
Still I don’t like giving up the top spot on the class list, especially after I worked so hard to be number one.
But it doesn’t matter.
We’ve been doing something much more important than studying.
I’ve been happy just spending time with you.

Arima:
Miyazawa.

Yukino:
At that moment, we were truly at peace.
We were so happy.
I thought there was nothing that could separate us.

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:2:&lt;h6&gt; 
 Arima:
Hm, my rank went down after all.
Oh well.
We’ll do better next time.
Come on.
Let’s go get something to eat.
Miyazawa?

Yukino:
Why are you in third place?
And I’m way down at thirteenth.

Arima:
Huh?

Yukino:
You studied behind my back, didn’t you?

Arima:
What!?
I… I didn’t.
I’d never do that.

Yukino:
So why are you nervous then?
I’ve been tricked!
I never thought you were a geeky type to go study in secret!

Arima:
I said I didn’t.
Come on. Calm down, please.
Yesterday you said I was more important than studying.

Yukino:
What!?
I never said anything like that.

Announcement:
Souichirou Arima and Yukino Miyazawa of 1A.
Immediately come to the student discipline room.
I repeat.
Souichirou Arima and Yukino Miyazawa of 1A.
Immediately come to the student discipline room.

Arima:
What could it be?

Yukino:
I really thought that there was nothing that could separate us.
I was so naive.

Arima:
Er, is there something you want, Mr. Kawashima?

Yukino:
He is a freshman faculty advisor.
Why this serious face I wonder.

Mr.Kawashima:
You two look as though you don’t know why you were called here.
I suppose that to be expected, neither of you have been in this room before.
The two of you are extremely talented students.
Your grades and living habits are flawless.
You both become famous graduates, who will heighten this school’s reputation even more.
I look forward to it.
Now, have the two of you seen the scores from the finals?

Yukino:
Yes sir.
We just saw them posted.

Mr.Kawashima:
Your grades have dropped quit severely.
It isn’t like you two at all.
What is the meaning of this?

Yukino:
I’m sorry.
I’ve been neglecting my studies.

Mr.Kawashima:
And you, Arima?

Arima:
Same here.
I promise you that this would never happen again.

Mr.Kawashima:
Good.
By the way, I’ve heard the rumor about you two recently.
It seems you two share the relationship that is more than mere friendship.
But in fact, you two often went out as a couple during the critical time before exams.
If it’s true, your studies would have been neglected
Isn’t that irresponsible of you?

Yukino:
What!?
Is this an inquiry?
We don’t have to answer such questions.

Mr.Kawashima:
Of course we don’t want to interfere in the private lives of our students.
However with you two, we can't afford to waste your potential.
Both of you are too valuable to be wasted.
You must think of your future.

Arima:
So in other words, you think the relationship we have is undesirable.

Mr.Kawashima:
That’s ture. Yes.

Arima:
So being a couple is harmful to our futures.

Mr.Kawashima:
Well to put it bluntly, it is.
I’m sure you could understand the foolishness of taking risks right now.
As your instructors, we cannot allow it to continue.
This is for your future.

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:4:&lt;h6&gt; 
 Mr.Kawashima:
That’s right.
Your future is far too promising.
Your study should be your first priority now.

Yukino:
Until just recently, it felt good to be a model student.
I was sneaky and cunning when I was little.

Teacher:
Ah, that was very good.
See children?
If you all work very hard, pretty soon you will be able to play just as well as Yukino.

Children:
Okay!

Teacher:
Thank you, Yukino.
You’re such a wonderful example for the rest of the class.

Yukino:
Ah, thank you very much, teacher.

Teacher:
Ah you’re so cute.
Well, see you tomorrow, Yukino.

Yukino:
Looks like the teacher is completely taken with me.
Captivating adults is easier than taking candy from a baby.
I had always been a conniving child.
After all I wanted to make myself look good.
Of course, no one knows that in order to be the first in the class, I practiced on that stupid recorder to one in the morning and almost vomited blood.
I told everyone that my favorite book was "Momo" by Michael Ende.
But I'd secretly read books like "The road to becoming a millionaire" and "The ways to increase your fortunes a hundred fold."
I never thought about trusting others or friendship or love.
My only joy in life was to polish my technique and make myself look perfect to everyone.
All this may be a little eccentric. But I didn’t care because I was head of my class.
I was confident that I was doing right things and my way of life would make me a success.
Someday, I’d be a high-ranking official or a lawyer.
I’d walk with the elite in the spotlight of life.
I’d speed down the open high road and bathe in people’s admiration.
Yes, that would be my life!
What could possibly be better!
But, but then, I would find out later that in the end I didn’t understand anything.
I see, their top two students let their grades drop.
No wonder they’re panicking.
Damm, I didn’t think this far ahead.

Mr.Kawashima:
I’m sure the both of you are unhappy with your grades.
Stop seeing each other.
And concentrate on studying.

Yukino:
Mr.Kawashima.
I understand your concern.
But I still think it’s unreasonable for you to interfere in our personal lives like this.

Mr.Kawashima:
And I should think that you would find destroying your grades unreasonable, instead you plan on ruining your future by wasting the three most important years of school.

Yukino:
It’s not…

Mr.Kawashima:
You can have your affair in college.
You should think more about your future.

Yukino:
No way.
There is no way I’m doing that.

Mr.Kawashima:
I understand how you feel, Miss Miyasawa.
But sometimes you have to make sacrifices if you want to achieve something important.
You don’t get a second chance, you know.
In the future, you can live any way you want.
It might seem unfair to you now.
But someday you’ll understand that it was for the best.
Study hard now.
Just be patient for three years.

Yukino:
I understand it perfectly.
And I used to think the way you do.
I believed that was the best way to live life.
But it’s completely wrong.
It’s an empty and worthless way to live life.
I had complete confidence in myself because I thought that was best.
But then, I met Arima:
Arima smiled at the real me.
He was my first real friend.
For the first time, I felt what it was like to be accepted by someone, to be able to laugh with someone.
I noticed all the precious things in life that I’d never paid attention to before.
I ask you.
Is it really so great to be a model student?

Teacher:
Miyazawa!
Watch your language, young lady!
How rude!

Teacher:
Apologize to Mr.Kawashima.

Arima:
That’s enough.
I agree with Miss Miyazawa.
You’re being unreasonable.
We will study.
We will prove to you that we can reconcile this.
You should have no problem with that.

Mr.Kawashima:
Make sure you don’t forget those words
Go back to your classroom.
Amazing.
I can’t believe those two think of it like that.

Arima&Yukino:
(sigh)

Arima:
That sure wrecked your sweet, talented, pretty girl image.


Yukino:
Hmph!

Arima:
Seriously though, I think we really shocked those teachers.

Yukino:
Ah, who cares!
We don’t have to take that kinda crap from those idiots.

Arima:
You’re right.
We don’t have to.
All we have to do is get good grades.
And besides, the two of us are trying to become real selves.
There’s bound to be problems.

Yukino:
You’re right.
I guess we'd better study harder.

Arima:
Yeah.

Yukino:
I know Arima would be there for me.
When I’m with Arima, everything seems easier.
I’ve never felt like this before even when I was first in my class.
I honestly believe that I’m on the right path now.
This is the true me.
That’s why I think meeting Arima was the best thing that ever happened to me.
I’m home.

Mother:
Oh, Yuki.
Yuki, did something happen at school today?
I got a call from your school this afternoon.
There’s something they want to talk to me about in person.
They want your father to come too.
What’s this all about?

Yukino:
But the right path still has its problems


 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:6:&lt;h6&gt; 
Arima:
Good morning.

Yukino:
Good morning.

Yukino&Arima:
(Sigh)

Arima:
Why did they have to go this far?
They didn’t have to call our parents.

Yukino:
Arima’s family life is a little complicated.
His parents abandoned him when he was little, and he went to live with his aunt and uncle.
He loves his foster parents very much.
And he hates anything might worry them.
Sorry.
It’s my fault that teachers got angry.
I shouldn’t have talked back to them.

Arima:
Hahn?
No, it’s not your fault at all.
Besides, I agree with you completely.
So, tell me.
Did your parents scold you anything?

Yukino:
My parents?

Father:
What?
The school wants to see us about Yukino?
Thirteenth place of finals.

Mother:
Don’t worry.
I’ll go with her tomorrow.

Father:
Me too!
I want to go to school too.

Yukino:
But why do you want to go so much?

Father:
I will xxxx for my dear sweat daughter.
And after all, it’s wonderful to be fighting for love again.
Back in old days, your mother and I fought for our love too.
The two of us married young, so when I asked your grandfather for his permission, he beat me black and blue.

Mother:
I remember.
You looked like a bloody ball.

Father:
Fighting against teachers.
Xxxxxx shivers of excitement.

Yukino:
Hey, don’t make things any worse, okay?

Mother:
Don’t worry.
Your father knows how to take care of them.
Xxxxxx.

Yukino:
That’s not what I meant!

Father:
Sweet heart, let’s take some weapons, shall we?

Mother:
Oh my.
Absolutely.

Yukino:
Ah, daddy…


Father:
Well then, we’ll both go tomorrow.
Just leave it to us!

Yukino:
No, I didn’t get scold.
Then I’m just fine.
I’m totally xxxxx.
My wacked parents are coming and there’s no telling what they’re gonna do.
What a nightmare.
They’re gonna ruin everything.

Arima:
Why can’t we live the way we want to.
I know studying is important.
But, what’s point if we can’t feel anything?
So I get the best scores.
Who cares?
There’s something else, something much more precious.
I was really happy the way you stood up to those teachers.

Yukino:
The two of us are not going to give up.
Xxxx rest of the world doesn’t get it, I wanna be myself.
I wanna be free!
That’s all xxxx to it.
And they can’t understand that.

Arima’s father:
Mr. Miyazawa, thank you for taking care of our son.

Yukino’s father:
She… she’s not worthy but we hope you will accept our daughter into your family.

Yukino:
It’s way too early for that.

Yukino’s father:
Nice tackle.
I think you might xxxx my spleen.

Yukino:
Oh, you make me so mad.

Yukino’s mother:
You shouldn’t do that in public.

Mr. Kawashima:
Now then, I asked for you the parents to attend this session today because I believe your decision will deeply influence your children’s future.
Both of them possess outstanding intellect.
I’m sure you must all be looking forward their promising future.

Yukino:
Dad…

Mr. Kawashima:
However, these two are making a terrible mistake.
They were so preoccupied with their relationship that they neglected their studies and ruined their grades.
It lost their minds.
They are both about to step off the path.
As their parents, I’d like you to speak to them.
No matter how you xxxx, their relationship can only serve to harm for their studies.
Excellent students don’t do this.
They don’t throw away their future over their emotion

Arima:
Mr. Kawashima, please take that back!

Arima’s father:
Souichirou.

Mr. Kawashima:
Neither of them will listen to their teachers.
Xxxx completely lost their senses.
I’m asking you as the parents to bring them around.

Yukino’s father:
But Mr. Kawashima, I’m confused.
Why do you think they’ll step off their path if they keep their relationship?

Mr. Kawashima:
Are you serious?
The exam scores already dropped dramatically.
Look at their grades.
What more proof do you need?


Yukino’s father:
You know, Yukino always did seem too smart to be our kid.

Yukino’s father & mother:
Yeah, it’s kind of annoying.

Yukino’s father:
Since she was young, our daughter has always decided everything for herself.
So I’ve never instructed her to do anything.
Of course, I can understand what you’re saying.
But actually, it’s because I’m thinking of her future that I don’t want to start telling her what to do.
I feel that I would take away all my child’s possibility if I tried to restrict her now and make her face her studies.
I believe children have the right to think and feel for themselves.
Studying is important.
But if you think about it, a single day in high school is far more presious than a month in adulthood.

Mr. Kawashima:
Then you don’t care?
You’re saying you don’t care your if child live to regret it?
And you’ll agree with him, Mr. Arima?

Arima’s father:
I do.
Our son is a gift.
He filled our lives with happiness.
All we xxxx to do was praise him.
He’s never troubled us for anything.
We almost look forward to the day when he needs our help.
So he can share his worries.
And I’ll show him how much we love him.

Yukino:
I guess my parents aren’t so crazy after all.
I guess he is more than just a big brother.

Arima:
Um.

Yukino’s father. 
Yukino.
We’re gonna have tea with Mr. and Mrs. Arima.
So see you later.

Yukino’s mother:
Yuki, would you please wash the rice xxxx?

Yukino:
Dad, you have to be quiet in the hallways.

Yukino’ father:
Oh, please excuse us.
Thank you for waiting.
Come on, let’s go.

Yukino:
What will we do?

Arima:
I supposed in their own ways the teachers were worried about us.

Yukino:
Thoughtfulness xxx the time like this is a mark of model students.

Arima:
Mr. Kawashima.

Mr. Kawashima:
What is it?
You two haven’t gone home yet?

Yukino:
We’re very sorry for saying anything rude.

Arima:
We intend to study properly.

Mr. Kawashima:
I want you two to do as you think best.
These days I can’t tell what students are thinking xxxx.
I thank you both.
It was nice to find xxx students who can think for themselves.
Have a safe trip to home.

Yukino:
There are time when things don’t go smoothly
But sometimes you discover things because of that.

Arima:
Want to go home?

Yukino:
We are all just flowers.
Small nameless flowers.
Little barely budding things supported by something far greater than ourselves.
Even though, we all dream of the day we eventually blossom.
Free under the wide open sky.

A synopsis of what to come.

Finally they become a couple that are recognized by the school.

That day she goes to Arima’s house no one else is at home. 

Could this be a 100% xxxx relationship?

Next time.

His and hers.

Her day.
