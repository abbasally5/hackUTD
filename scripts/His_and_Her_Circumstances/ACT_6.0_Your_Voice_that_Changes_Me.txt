  He is perfect.
He made an effort to be so.
There is probably no one around him who would deny that.
It had become a part of him to be perfect in his studies, his character and even his personality.
But that was only until he knew what love was.
What a summer.
After our first date ended in failure, we went on dates like crazy.
Since we couldn't spend any time together after we started going out due to various reasons, you could say that we were half obsessed.
Miyazawa!
Which way?
That way. We'll have to walk a little.
It's fun to be with Arima.
Since we both lived lives of constant effort and self-control, it was great to just goof off.
When we meet outside like this, I realize all over again...
Arima is handsome.
What is it?
Oh, it's nothing.
Weren't you staring at me just now?
Here, I can see beauty personified.
He has prettier looks than most girls. And his personality is composed and refined.
On top of that, he's the smartest in the class.
He's good at sports and his family is rich.
He's good at everything he does.
He spends time with me and he's nice to me.
And it doesn't seem like I have to worry about him cheating on me.
Truly flawless. Flawless man, Arima!
Even though we spend more time together I never get tired of gazing at his face.
For tea, do you like Earl Grey or Royal?
Actually, I only like Nestea.
Nestea?
But I still don't understand Arima.
I don't know what's underneath that perfectly polished surface.
What he's thinking, what he's feeling. I'm curious.
Those are the things I want to know.
I wanna watch him always.
Will I ever be able to understand him?

That summer was hot.
After our first date ended in failure, we went on dates like crazy.
Though it was inevitable, I regretted that we couldn't spend much time together since we started going out.
As a man, I was ashamed.
But we were both so busy, you could say I was half-obsessed.
Miyazawa!
We might be a little early.
Then do you wanna take the long way?
It's fun to be with Miyazawa.
Since we both lived lives of constant effort and self-control, it was great [to just goof off].
When we meet outside like this, I realize all over again.
Phew... It's so hot!
Miyazawa is weird.
What is it?
Oh, it's nothing.
Weren't you staring at me just now?
She's probably immersed in mysterious speculation again.
I'll probably never be able to read her thoughts.
Sure, I love her and I think she's cute but still, I've fallen in love with a very interesting person.
She's a selfish person. Her personality is twisted and her thoughts are unpredictable.
She's emotional and scary when she gets mad.
On top of that, I was given the rare experience of getting jump-kicked in the stomach by the person I had a one-sided crush on.
It's also amusing that, once in a while, she seriously agonizes over the fact that she's weird.
And now that we spend more time with each other, I never get tired of watching that unique world.
Sorry about bringing up tea...
Don't worry. I like this tea.
I bet she doesn't know that I have a complex about her.
Our grades are the same, but she has originality. It's not fair.
Watching Miyazawa, I think that I'm a truly dull, unoriginal person.
In the end, my only worth is that I'm "well-made."
And I thought I could be happy if I was perfect.

Yo, Miyazawa.
Yo, Asaba. Hey.
Hey.
You tan more and more everyday.
I'm doing body-boarding right now.
Body-boarding. Getting into fads again.
You gonna get the women on the beaches now too?
Hey, that's good! Swimsuit girls!
The sea is a man's paradise!
I see.
Hey, wait. You went on a date with Arima yesterday, didn't you?
How're things working out?
Hohohoho! Well, deary.
Miyazawa, what's with the old lady act? You're freaking me out.
Yeah, we went to the Shinagawa Aquarium and the Toshimaen Amusement Park.
And we've seen three movies, too. And the cake from Tops was yummy.
We're gonna see the fireworks at Edo and Sumida Rivers during summer break.
We're gonna go to Disneyland, too.
Take me, too.
No way.

Yo, Arima.
Hideaki.
I just saw Miyazawa.
You tan more and more every day.
I'm doing body-boarding right now.
Finals are coming up, so you better study.
What's with you? You're going on dates like crazy, too.
You're having fun.
I study, so I'm fine.
Miyazawa looked happy.
She gets to go on dates with Arima after all! Lucky her!
I wanna do it too!
What're you talking about?
Being with me isn't fun or anything.
It's been almost three months since I met Miyazawa.
I had a crush on her for a month.
In the second month, we became friends and we started going out in the third month.
I was supposed to be able to change, if I was with Miyazawa.
But in the end, I haven't changed that much.
I tend to suppress my feelings.
Reason always comes before emotions.
Sure I'm human, so I become emotional at times.
But in the end, I always shut away my emotions.
There is a door to my emotions, and I can never do away with it.
It felt like only you were changing.
I felt that someday I won't be able to keep up with you.
I'm sorry, Arima.
I have class committee stuff so I can't go home with you today.
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'm really sorry.
Tomorrow, let's go home together. I'll wait even if it gets late, okay?
Okay.

Time for us to eat!
So, Sis, how far have you gone with your boyfriend?
Kano! You know!
Too soon. It's too soon for anything in high school!
Father, you are so far behind the times.
Yeah, really. In high school, anything is normal now.
Anything?
Yeah. Anything.
Not good! Not good at all!
In your father's days, the most we'd do is hold each other!
Dear, but times have changed.
De...Dear... not you, too.
And? How is it?
With your boyfriend.
There isn't anything!
I guess that's how it is in the end.
That's so boring.
And in the rest of the world, the couples who got together after the sports fest are overflowing with mingled feelings of joy and sorrow.
And our sister is taking her own sweet time.
I think Yuki is just out of touch with the world, that's all.
I'm fine with that. It's better if there's nothing.
If you'd have a fight right about now, it would be interesting.
Sis isn't capable of something like that.
I'm fine with that. Yukino, it's fine the way things are.
Oh, dear, pass me the soy sauce, please.
Oh, here you go.
Thank you.
This family is just so...!
By the way, Souichirou.
Yes?
No, it's nothing.
Yes, sir.
True, just like Kano said, there were so many couples around but they aren't as noticeable anymore.
Expiration date, one month.
The world is full of couples who can't even survive one summer.
I guess if there are meetings, there will always be partings.
Oh, where is true love?
Hey!
With you, it's love for cheap. A real bargain.
Huh?
Where is Arima?
You always say stuff like that.
There you go again.
Is Miyazawa really happy when she's with me?
Am I really a man who's worthy of her?
Oh, sorry, did I wake you?
Was I asleep?
Oh, right. We were supposed to go home together today, weren't we?
Yeah, but I'm sorry I'm so late.
Oh, look. It's started raining.
I've never seen you asleep before.
Your face is neat, even when you're asleep.
You think so?
Tsukino kicks in her sleep, you know?
Kano sometimes dreams about something sad and she sobs in her sleep.
And she's cute like that.
Rain, huh?
Do you have an umbrella?
Nope.
Me, neither.
What'll we do?
Do you wanna wait and see for now?
It feels so good at school when everyone's gone home.
Normally, people say it's creepy.
Were you waiting for me to wake up? You could've woken me up.
But you looked like you were sleeping so well.
And at school, you're busy with committee meetings and club.
I can't be with you much and I wanted to let you sleep, so it's okay.
She only...
She only laughs like this in front of me. I know this, for sure.
Miyazawa, you're like a puppy.
Yeah! I've been a big sister all this time and I've been keeping up my image all this time, so I've never depended on anyone before.
It feels so good to depend on someone.
But, I don't wanna depend on anyone other than you.
I wanna be with her. I wanna be with her. I wanna be with her. I wanna be with her.
Did it strike... just now?
It struck...
Oh, uh... um... Sorry, I'll go cool my head.
Oh, is this music?! Oh, this song! I know this song!
In this super-important scene, I can hear the song!
That song is endlessly running around in my head, in my ears!
Oh, the chorus won't stop!
No! The song won't unstick from my brain! Make it stop! I can't stand it! Please, make it stop! I can't take it anymore!
What have I done? Done something dirty.
What have I done?
What'll I do?
How am I supposed to face Miyazawa? What'll I do...?
I mean, Miyazawa, what just happened...
You know, I thought of something more I wanted to say.
About me not wanting to depend on anyone else in the world besides you.
Oh, yeah. Right.
Arima, you can depend on me, too.
I was wondering if hiding my true self and putting up this huge image all through middle school was really a waste.
But it might not be.
Maybe I can think of it this way.
Because I've put in that effort all this time, I might have the strength to support you.
Then the me up through middle school won't go to waste.
You don't have to push yourself.
It's exhausting to always have to stand by yourself.
Because you want someone who'll support you.
Rapidly, the memories go back to the past.
Him and her before they met.
For her image in order to be proud, in order to be number one, she works hard to be perfect.
Due to his birth, for his aunt and uncle who raised him.
Because his relatives look down on him, he works hard to be perfect.
Wow! Miss Miyazawa got number one on the finals again!
She's always number one!
There's no one who can match her!
Sis, there's something interesting on TV!
Let's watch together!
I want to finish this homework, so I can't.
Again?! Really? Is it that fun to get number one?!
Well, yeah. There's nothing else that I really enjoy.
Wow! Arima got number one on the finals again!
He's always number one!
There's no one who can match him!
Um, would you please accept this?
Sorry, I can't.
Is there someone you're going out with? Or someone you like?
I'm sorry.
I'd never cared for anyone.
My emotions never seem to be moved by anything.
But it doesn't matter. I'm gonna become a respectable person.
Become a respectable person that Mother and Father can truly be proud of.
I don't care about anything else, as long as my parents are happy.
When they entered high school, their worlds changed greatly.
Oh, I know why I love you so much now.
You always change me.
We can support each other.
Miyazawa has the key that will open the door to my heart.

Yo, Asaba, hey.
Hey.
You got darker again, didn't you?
You look so toasted.
Oh my, should I do stuff like UV care, you think? I'll get freckles.
Man, yesterday's thunder was amazing.
Yeah. You guys going on a date again this Sunday? Hope it's clear.
It's all okay. Come rain or wind, we'll be okay.

Yo, Hideaki.
Arima!
You've tanned more! What about studying?
Man, yesterday's thunder was amazing.
Don't change the subject.
Heard you guys have a date Sunday.
Man, hope the weather will be clear!
It's all okay. Come rain or wind, we'll be okay.
That's right, come rain or wind, we'll be okay.
We've only just begun, after all.

A synopsis of what's to come.
Sis and Arima are dating and goofing off lots and they're really happy together.
But not everyone is happy. The school has noticed that their grades are dropping.
Will they have to break up to save their future?
This could be bad.
Next time: Their Estrangements.
