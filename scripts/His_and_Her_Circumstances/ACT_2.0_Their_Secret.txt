Tsukino and Kano:
A synopsis of what has happened!

Tsukino:
Souichirou Arima.
Excellent grades, good at sports with a good personality that everyone likes.
In addition, his family is a long line of doctor since the Edo era.
A real thoroughbred.

Kano:
Yukino Miyazawa.
Good looking, gifted with both intelligence and beauty.
She is a commoner, raised in a middle-class family, but she also has the intelligence and grace comparable to that of Arima.

Tsukino:
These two, who absolutely captivate everyone who surrounds them, met each other in high school.

Kano:
The other day, however, Arima found out, quite by accident, that Yukino was actually very common.

Tsukino:
Sis was careless.

Kano:
On top of that, Arima had confessed his love for Sis only a short while ago!

Tsukino:
But Sis simply rejected him without even thinking about it.

Kano:
And right after that, this incident happened!

Tsukino:
Sis really was careless.

Kano:
She is truly doomed.

Tsukino:
And because of the grave that she dug for herself, Sis has fallen into a desperate situation!

Kano:
Now, what'll you do, Yukino Miyazawa?

Tsukino and Kano:
And what's gonna happen, Souichirou Arima?



Yukino:
You only need to look once to know someone's superiority.

Student:
Arima.

Yukino:
Arima... He knows everything now.
The mistake of my life.
Knowing his intelligence, he must have guessed everything after seeing me like that.
The way I act at school is a complete bluff.
Image, image, image!
An incarnation of image, who lives only for image!
That's me.
Now he knows the true identity of Yukino Miyazawa.
And what will you do now, Arima?
Will you tell everyone and make me a laughing stock?
Will you look at me with contempt?
Or will you sympathize with foolish little me, like the model student that you are?
Why, why of all people did Arima have to find out?
No, I don't want him to laugh at me, feel contempt for me, or even feel sympathy for me!

Student:
Miss Miyazawa was looking this way just now.
Think she was looking at me?

Student:
Yeah, right.
Like she'd even consider going out with you.

Student:
Oh, you think so?

Student:
But I like her as she's so delicate and ladylike.

Student:
Maybe I'll confess how I feel to her after all.

Student:
That would be completely useless.
You'd only get hurt.

Yukino:
I fearfully awaited my moment of judgment.
Right now, those girls laugh kindly with me,
but by tomorrow, they'll know that they've been deceived and then they're gonna look at me with contempt!

Student:
Oh, by the way, about that class just now...

Student:
That teacher's got really bad handwriting, you know?

Student:
And he talks a lot, too.

Student:
Yeah, really.

Student:
It's like, give us a break.

Student:
Yeah, really.

Student:
It's exhausting just to be in class...

Yukino:
But, many days passed and Arima never said anything to me.
And it didn't seem like he'd told anyone else, either.
Days passed... Many days passed, and nothing happened.
Could it be that he let me get away with it?
Yeah, that must be it!
He's got a good upbringing and a good personality!
He doesn't do cheap things like tell on people and poke at someone's weakness!
So, that's it! All right!
I'm so lucky!
Guess I got off easy!
And then, I was relieved.

Yukino:
Oh, gotta go to the library.
But a terrible conspiracy was awaiting me at the library.
Who could have possibly predicted it?

Arima:
You look quite different.
What am I, the devil?
Did I surprise you?
I think I did.
I saw something I wasn't supposed to.
I was completely deceived, too.
To think that the innocent little Miss Miyazawa was actually like that.
I bet everyone will be surprised.
It'll be sensational.
I wonder how they'd react.
Would they laugh?
Would they throw up their hands?
What is it, Miss Miyazawa?

Yukino:
Don't... don't tell anyone.

Arima:
Come on, now.
Say please.

Yukino:
Please don't tell anyone.

Arima:
Sure. Okay.

Yukino:
All right!

Arima:
Here you go.
Do those for me by the end of the day.
I appreciate it.
Well, later, I've got club.

Yukino:
What are these?
Why do I have to do these for him?
And who the hell was that?
Who the hell was that freaky guy and what did he do with Arima?

Teacher:
Then... Arima, translate that part for me, please.

Arima:
Yes, ma'am.
"Her breath was so faint.
And it seemed that she wanted and needed to say something.
But she seemed to be exhausted and to be suffering greatly, so no matter what may come after this, the Emperor..."

Teacher:
Now, next... Miyazawa, interpret this.

Yukino:
Yes, ma'am.
In this part, they are said to be married.
This helps to express the climax of emotions in the story.
Back then, death at the court was considered to be a defilement, and no one was allowed to die there, except for the Emperor.
The Emperor tried to keep the consort by his side, and...

Teacher:
Yes, very good.
You were both quite splendid.

Yukino:
They raise their voices in admiration and praise.
Of course, none of them know... that now I am Arima's servant!
My tragedy started after that day.

Arima:
Good evenin'!
Hey, you're doing it. You're doing it.
Good work.
Wow, it's perfect!
You're done already!
You're amazing!
That's what I'd expect of you!

Yukino:
What the hell?!
What is the meaning of this?!
Why are you making me do all your work for you?!

Arima:
It's simple.
I've discovered your ultimate weakness.
So I may as well use it.

Yukino:
I... I... I know that!
Don't rub it in!
That's called blackmailing, you know.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

Arima:
Mm-hmm.
What else am I supposed to do?
I'm far too busy and you're the perfect person to do my work for me.

Yukino:
Bastard!

Arima:
You're going to be very useful.
Well, I won't force you to do it.
If you don't want to, just say so.
That is... if you have that kind of courage.

Yukino:
You scheming bastard!
What a blunder.
To think he had a hidden side, too.
I've been able to keep up appearances for fifteen years now.
I've never been so humiliated!
Dammit! What's with that bastard?! Dammit!

Tsukino:
Sis, I think you should be grateful to Arima.

Tsukino and Kano:
Right?

Kano:
He's teaching you not only the worthlessness of image, but also the harsh reality that there's always someone better than you.
I think you should go straight up to Arima and thank him.

Tsukino and Kano:
Right?

Yukino:
That jerk isn't doing this to help me!
Dammit!
But right then, he had me.
I had no means of escaping his trap.
All I could do... was to curse my own fate.
But it was too late for that, too.
Now, every day, I'm buried in Arima's work.

Student:
Did you know about that math teacher, Yoshida?
All his teeth are dentures.

Student:
No, really?!
No way!

Yukino:
You're terrible, making a girl do so much work for you.

Arima:
Pretending to cry won't work.

Yukino:
Dammit!

Arima:
Miss Miyazawa, you're actually tough and strong, aren't you?

Yukino:
Why don't you just shut up?!
What's this work for then?

Arima:
It's the plans for the school trip committee.

Yukino:
You're even doing stuff like that?!
Now that I had to do this work, I could see that Arima truly had a lot on his hands.
Class committee. Volunteer club committee. School trip committee.
He's also on the executive committee of many other events.
And he's part of the main staff of all those committees, and on top of that, he has club and his schoolwork.
And, he also deals with our classmates who come to him to ask questions.
By the way, I run away from these things.
You're gonna die soon.

Arima:
It seems as if I stand out somehow.

Yukino:
Yeah, it's a hard life, isn't it?
With your looks and your brain, you'd think you could lead a better life than this one, Arima.

Arima:
Hmm, I see. You think so?
Well, it's a good thing I've got you to help me with everything.

Yukino:
What am I, your dog?

Arima:
Good puppy.

Yukino:
Arima, you were student body president in middle school, right?

Arima:
Yeah, what about you?

Yukino:
I did it, too.

Arima:
Then you must've had a lot of work to do.

Yukino:
Mm-mm. Not particularly.

Arima:
Huh? Why didn't you?

Yukino:
"What'll I do?
I'll never get all of this work done."
I said that and a guy did it for me!

Arima:
So sad.
Deep down, you're really just a con artist.

Yukino:
You! You hypocrite!
You're the same!

Arima:
Huh? No, actually I'm not.
Most of the time, I'm really not like this.
I'm acting like this because I'm following your lead.

Yukino:
So, it's my fault?!
I don't believe it.

Arima:
But it is the truth!

Yukino:
It's completely dark outside already.

Arima:
Miss Miyazawa, you feeling hungry?

Yukino:
Hungry? Yeah, I am.

Arima:
Then I'll treat you to something, this time.

Yukino:
In the end, Arima's perfect, somehow.
I wanna eat steak.

Arima:
Dummy.

Yukino:
Where... Where does it come from?
Up until yesterday, there was nothing.
Up until just now...

Student:
Those two, over there.
Look, look!

Yukino:
It wasn't anywhere...

Student:
That rumor must be true after all.
Yeah, it's gotta be.

Arima:
You awake?
I just got here after club.
Thought I'd wake you.

Yukino:
Suddenly... suddenly, he seemed special.
Arima seemed special to me.



Yukino:
I wonder what that was, that time with Arima.
I wonder what this sensation is.
I don't understand this feeling very well.
It feels kind of hazy and restless somehow.
The first time I felt like kind of...
This... This couldn't be... the "love" that everyone talks about?!
Is this that "love" or "adoration" or "crash" thing?!
It couldn't be! Not me!
How idiotic.
I can't believe it.
Feels like I've lost touch with reality.
But then... What'll I do?

The Miyazawas:
Let's eat!

Kano:
You've been coming home pretty late recently, Sis.

Yukino:
Huh? Oh, I have work to do for the class committee.

Kano:
Mm-hmm?
Really?

Yukino:
Yeah.

Tsukino:
See there?
You were wrong after all.

Kano:
Hmm... but still...

Yukino:
What is it?

Mother:
What?

Father:
What are you talking about?

Kano:
It's just really strange.
You suddenly started coming home late all the time.
And you used to tell us everything that was happening in high school, but you don't do it anymore.
And besides, you don't wear your sweats anymore.
You have a boyfriend, don't you Yukino?

Yukino:
Wha... Wha... Wha..

Father:
What?!
A... A... A... A man?!
Yukino! I love you more than anything in the world.
Of course, I love Tsukino and Kano more than anything, too.
But you chose another man over your father, who's so full of love for you?!

Yukino:
Wha... What are you babbling about?!

Tsukino:
Hey, she's bothered by it.

Kano:
So, you have one after all.

Mother:
I want to see a picture of this boy.
I wonder if he's good-looking.

Tsukino:
Most likely he's gorgeous.

Father:
Be... Better looking than me?

Tsukino:
Without a doubt.

Mother:
Yuki cares a lot about looks.
I wonder who she chose.

Yukino:
Leave me alone already.
I said, it's work.

Father:
Yukino!

Yukino:
You're choking me!

Father:
I believe in you.

Yukino:
Really, they don't even know what I'm going through.
If I'd just met him normally and came to feel this way, I wouldn't have any problems.
That's right. I'm in trouble.
All because... Arima is...

Student:
Hey, Miss Miyazawa.
I was just kind of wondering.
Are you and Arima... dating each other?
Because you're together a lot recently.
Oh, but I don't mean it in a weird way.
You both really suit each other and everyone envies you, but everyone feels it's okay if it's you.
And I was wondering how it was really.

Yukino:
True... he confessed his feelings for me, but...

Student:
This one brave girl went up and asked Arima about the two of you.
And then, she said Arima just laughed and didn't answer her at all.

Yukino:
I knew it.
I've been thinking about it for a while.
Just where had that confession gone inside Arima?
After that one time, Arima never talked about it again.
I knew what he said...
I thought maybe he meant it, but....
Arima loved the me before he found out what I was really like.
Not the real me.
I fell in love with Arima after I found out what he was like, but...

Arima:
Miss Miyazawa.
Sorry, would you stay behind today, too?
It won't take too much time today, so you won't have to stay too late.

Yukino:
I see.
Those feelings he had for me... they must have completely disappeared.

Arima:
Oh, I see you're still here.
I saw the classroom lights, so....
Did it really take that long?

Yukino:
They're done already.

Arima:
That's good.

Yukino:
I quit.
I'm not gonna do this anymore.

Arima:
Huh?

Yukino:
I won't do it anymore.
I'm not going to help you.

Arima:
Really?
But then, you'll have a lot of problems, won't you?

Yukino:
I don't care... if you tell them.

Arima:
Wait!
What are you angry about?

Yukino:
I'm not angry.
Let me go.

Arima:
You are angry.
Getting so angry...
If there's a reason, say it.
I won't understand otherwise.

Yukino:
It doesn't matter.

Arima:
Yes, it does.

Yukino:
Let me go!
I said, let go!
I'm just so sick of it!
I'm sick of being used!

Arima:
Miyazawa!

Yukino:
I'd forgotten, because we'd been talking like we were friends.
Arima's just been taking advantage of me.
It's awful!
When he found out what I was really like, his attitude completely changed.
And he used me without hesitation!
It's terrible!
So I'm gonna put an end to this, once and for all!
What the hell?!
Why are you chasing me?!

Arima:
Because you're running away!

Yukino:
Don't follow me! Don't follow me!

Arima:
Like hell!
Why do you have to run so fast like that?!
I said, wait!
Why you little...!
This could cause some misunderstanding...
Huh? You're still gonna run away?!
Didn't you scrape something?!
Show me your face! Your face....

Yukino:
So, I'm a really weird girl!
I'm all show and I'm spoiled and a liar!
I'm calculating and I'm greedy!
I'm sure I disappointed you quite a bit!
But even so, why did your attitude change, huh?!
Am I such a worthless person if I'm not acting elegant?!
I hate you! I hate you!
Don't touch me!

Arima:
I'm sorry.

Yukino:
I mean, am I that weird to you?
Am I a worthless person if I'm not a model student?

Arima:
That's not true at all.
The way you really are is fun, and actually I kinda like it.

Yukino:
I'm... I'm funny?

Arima:
No, not in a weird way.
I never had any intentions of telling anyone to begin with.
It wasn't that I really wanted to use you.
I just wanted an excuse to talk with you.
I thought it would be fun and that you'd enjoy it.
And it was fun for a while.
Because I'd never talked to anyone like this before.
But I thought that's what you liked to do.
I didn't know it was hurting you.
I'm so sorry.
I won't tell you to help me anymore.

Yukino:
I see.
It wasn't that he didn't care about me.
He did care.
I'm glad.
I cried a lot.
From that day onward, Arima and I became friends who shared a secret.
A secret just between us.
Hmm, so you're an only child.
But then, you sort of seem like it.

Arima:
What about you?

Yukino:
Well, I've got two kid sisters.

Arima:
Hmm, are kid sisters really cute?

Yukino:
Well, to be exact, Arima misunderstood things a little.
Yeah! They're really impudent and super-cute!
I'll show 'em to you sometime.

Arima:
Impudent and cute?
What does that mean?

Yukino:
He thinks the reason I got mad was because he made me do all his work.
Well, that's okay.
For the time being, I know that my existence is special to Arima.
Even if it isn't love.
Well, you did a good job.
You even fooled me.
I never would have thought that you were this sort of person, too.

Arima:
I guess you're right.
You're right.
I'm surprised myself.
You might not believe it, Yukino, but I really didn't know there was a me like this deep inside until I met you.
Why do you bother me so much?
Why do I follow your lead so much?
I was drawn toward you more and more, and soon, I was a different me.
Is that a good thing?
Or is it really a bad thing?



PREVIEW:
A synopsis of what's to come!
The two made peace.
Will they go straight to being lovey-dovey?!
They aren't allowed to!
Arima's attitude turns cold.
Oh, will Sis just get rejected?!
Next time: His Circumstances.
Yeah!
