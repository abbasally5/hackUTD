  The feelings that come through our joined hands...
I hope we can always, always be together.
Excuse me! But has Arima from class 1-A come this way?
Oh, Miss Miyazawa. Wait a minute, okay?
I'm sorry. They said he went over to the construction department.
Just a minute, okay?
They said he got called to oversee delivery. Was just here...
Oh, wait a sec.
They said he went to practice the 100 meters. He was just here.
Okay, I'll look for him.
He's not here. He might be over by the relay.
I don't know where Arima is.
Oh, shoot. I have to go to the bookkeeping department soon.
Oh, Miss Miyazawa! Arima just came here looking for you.
Miss Miyazawa?
The preparation for the sports fest has started.
Because of that, executive committee members are extremely busy.
We had started going out yesterday.
But we also have a lot of jobs and we're running around everyday.
I haven't seen him for three days, ever since classes have stopped.
We finally started going out and now we're gonna busy all the time with the sports fest.
I hope we can at least eat lunch together sometimes.
Really? I can eat with you, Arima?
Of course, Miyazawa. I want to eat with you too!
Arima's so cool!
We should be eating together alone, just the two of us.
And we're sharing time together in an unfolding sweet love story like a cola commercial...
But this is what has happened.
Our love and appetite have been left behind.
Where did our happiness go?
I guess, right now, there's no time for that.
It's gonna fall!
Oww, you just smashed my foot, you idiot!
Ah, it's a cockroach!
It's all right! It's dried up! It's dead!
I just wanna see Arima...
No, seeing him even when we're busy is true love!
All right! I'm going to work hard to find him!
Arima? I just saw him, but...
It's so close! He just left a second ago.
No, he hasn't come this way.
I've bought some lunches and *beep*!
Thanks. Then, could you go hand this to Mr.Saitou?
The copier's out of toner! Isn't there a store somewhere?
How can we be out of toner? We had three of them.
Then please make a run to the next town.
The calculator is broken!
Go steal one from the faculty office!
Hurry! The printing deadline is three o'clock!
Gotcha!
Excuse me! Coming through!
No, I don't think he's come this way.
I think I hear Arima's voice.
I saw him ran through here really fast.
Sir, there's another misprint!
Just ignore it!
No! *Beep* won't work!
I wanna go home.
Why in the world am I doing this?
This is no longer about eating lunch together with Arima.
I'm gonna die if I keep this up.
Excuse me, sir. I delivered the list...
Not here. I wonder what happened.
Oh, well.
I guess Arima must be this busy too.
Hokuei! Hokuei!
I fell asleep.
I dreamt memories from the past.
Right. Until just a while ago, it was like that.
I was still pretending that I hated Arima.
Arima was always nearby.
That's right. Arima was there.
I wanna see him! I wanna be near him!
Back then, I never thought... that I would come to love Arima this much.
There you are!
Miyazawa!
Arima! Arima!
There he is. Arima, there's something we need you to do.
Don't ask me about every little thing! Dammit!!
Sorry. I think I need to take a little break. Is that okay?
Yes. Ple...Please take it easy.
I'm really stressed out.
It looks like you're having a hard time, too.
The afternoon program will now begin. Please take your seats.
This mess is finally gonna end tomorrow.
Oh! Arima! Arima! Arima! Arima! Arima!
Oh... ho...how you doing?
Huh? Ye...Yeah, I've been good.
Oh, what about you? You seemed upset just now.
Oh, don't worry. I'm doing good too.
I see.
Yeah, that's right.
It's been so long. I'm kind of embarrassed.
Man, what are we so nervous about?
Sorry! I really should think of something to say but I can't.
I can't think of anything either!
To be honest, it was really boring not being able to be with you.
Yeah. It was really boring for me, too.
This sports fest is the pits, you know?
I really don't want to do the school festival right now.
In the end, we can't do anything like a normal couple.
Nice day, huh?
I've gotta get back now. Later.
That was scary. I'm not sure what happened.
I wanna be with you forever and ever!
All right! I'm gonna do it!
The actual sports fest was really great.
Arima competing was really cool and we finally got to eat lunch together, too.

Around this time the groups you hang out with generally become set according to the clubs you participate in.
Also impromptu couples are mass produced.
A specialty of the sports fest.
There are a lot of new couples in school now as if they just popped up out of nowhere.
But this pair is two boys.
They're both good-looking, so they really stand out.
Hey, what's that boy's name down there?
Oh, you mean Asaba?
Miss Miyazawa, you don't know who Asaba is?
Hideaki Asaba from 1-F and Arima, the two best looking freshmen.
He's really popular, too.
He carried the trash bin for me.
He got a ball for me.
I hear Asaba really likes girls.
He's so cute somehow, you know?
Yeah, yeah.
Well, I think firefighters are the coolest thing right now.
If he's such good friends with Arima, I should try to be friends with him too, right?
After all, I'm going out with Arima.
Oh, hello.
Oh, you're the one, right? Arima's girlfriend?
You're pretty popular among all the other guys.
But now that I get a close look at you, you're not that hot.
Breakdown of Relations
Hey, Miyazawa. What're you doing?
Arima...
Does my face look...
You look cute.
Damn you, Asaba.
I may not be vanity personified any longer but saying something like that to me is unforgivable!
Just you wait, Asaba. You shall know my wrath!
Why you brat! I thought you were supposed to be a nice model student!
Ha! It's your fault for making me mad.
You piss me off, woman! I can't stand you!
Shut up! Exact same thing right back at you!
You drive me nuts!
Having started out on the worst foot possible, a battle to the death would unfold whenever we set eyes on each other.
I wonder what happened between Miss Miyazawa and Asaba.
They really don't get along for some reason.
Well, usually she's really nice and polite and Asaba's usually nice to girls.
I heard that you don't get along with Asaba.
I don't wanna hear that name right now.
You don't know what I can do if I get into a fighting mood.
Really? Why's that?
Oh, come on! Arima, why're you friends with a guy like that?
What's so great about that jerk anyway?
Huh? I'm not really.
He talks to me, so I talk back.
But I don't really think of him as a friend.
I should change the subject.
What're you looking at?
A movie magazine. Want a look?
Yeah!
Movies, huh? I haven't seen one in a while. So what's playing?
Well, I thought this one looked good...
Yo...You know, Miyazawa...
That is, if you don't mind...
You wanna go watch it together this Sunday?
Yeah! I'll go! I'll go, I'll go!
Yay, my first date!
A lot of things have happened since we started high school but we've finally come this far!
My mood just turned sour all of a sudden.
Yo. You seem to be in high spirits.
It's none of your business!
Going out on a date with Arima or something?
So, what if I am?
Arima sure is eccentric.
If he wanted to, he could have his pick of much better girls.
What're you doing? Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!
At this rate, Arima'll cool down pretty soon.
Guess there's nothing to worry about.
Shut the hell up.
I'm gonna take Arima from you.
But... what're you talking about?
No way. Well, maybe you but... Arima... I just didn't think that...
No! That's not it!
Listen up.
I love only girls! Understand?
My sweet, sweet little lambs.
Ever since I was little, I loved to be surrounded by them.
And somewhere along the way, I came to harbor an ambition.
I want to be surrounded by more and more girls.
Someday, I will realize the Asaba Maryland!
That's where Arima comes in.
He is the perfect partner I've been searching for.
His good looks will surely contribute greatly to my ambition.
All the Marys will be blinded by our charm and they'll form herds many times the current size and flock to us, to me.
Pervert! You're sick!
Why're you trying to drag Arima into something like that?
So what? I don't care about anything as long as I'm comfortable!
So, that's why you're so mean to me!
I'm in the way because I'm his girlfriend!
So you've finally realized.
I thought if I poked at you a bit, you'd run off crying because you're a nice model student.
What a miscalculation.
Guess I don't have to go to the trouble of forcing you guys apart now.
I'm sure Arima will start avoiding you on his own.
Really! Oh, you make me so angry!
You're the worst!
Even I didn't think you could be such a total jerk.
How can you be so uncaring and mean?
Aren't you ashamed?
Then let me ask you.
What about you?
I don't think you and I are all that different.
You've been tricking people all this time, pretending to be a model student.
If I'm the worst, then that means you're the worst, too.
Why don't you think about whether or not you're a match for Arima?
If it pisses you off, say something back.
If my reasoning is wrong, I won't mind giving up on Arima.
His words cut deep.
Miyazawa?
It was something that was always on my mind, so I couldn't say anything back.
What did you say to Miyazawa?
You can't hide it. I know you're trying to use me.
I don't mean to be conceited.
There have been a lot of people who've tried to use me in the past.
But I won't let you get away with hurting her.
You sure seem to care about her a lot.
I don't get it. Tell me what's so great about her.
Can't you tell?
The way she stays with me when there's nothing to be gained.
I got here early.
I gotta cheer up.
I can't quit being his girlfriend just because of something that jerk said.
Which one were we going to see?
You think we can still make it? I'm a little worried.
Oh yeah. No problem.
Sorry. Did you wait long?
I'm sorry. I'm so late.
He's not home.
I've got the right time and place, right?
Well, see you tomorrow at one.
I wonder if something happened.
Wasn't that fun?
Yeah!
Thanks for treating.
See you later.
I was looking forward to this too.
Yo! What're you doing in a place like this?
On a date with Arima?
Looks like the movie's already begun.
Ha-ha, you got stood up, didn't you?
Shut the hell up!
What's with you! You don't have to tease me at a time like this!
So I've been waiting for a long time! Well, sorry! So what?! I have to wait! I want to wait! Just leave me alone!
Sorry, I didn't think you'd actually been waiting so long.
Sorry about all the things before, too.
Is this some game?
No, please believe me! I was wrong! I'm sorry.
Why this sudden change of heart?
Well, [for] all sorts of things.
Basically, I'm not gonna fight a battle I can't win.
What about the Maryland plan?
Oh yeah, none of that anymore.
It just all started feeling futile.
And also I've just realized now but if I think about it without trying to make Arima my partner, I actually kind of like you.
You know, it was pretty fun going at it with you. Don't you think?
Oh...
I'm sorry! On the way out, my mother got anemic. My father wasn't there, so I...
Apologize!
Making a woman wait for so long! You're a disgrace to men!
You don't make a woman wait, even if you have to abandon your parents!
Die! Die and make amends!
It's okay! I don't mind anymore!
So she says.
Oh, he did that on purpose.
He put on a big performance so there won't be any ill feelings between us afterwards.
But that was really dangerous.
At first, I didn't like him. But since then, Asaba has totally become a member of our group.
Why are you here?
The other day, when I stayed over at Arima's house...
You even go over to his house?
Just before going to sleep, Arima told me all the details about what the two of you did that day. You should have seen him -- he was blushing the whole time. He's so cute.
He's such an innocent little boy.
You big-mouth! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
No matter how you look at [, it is your] love.
In any case, we've made a new friend.

A synopsis of what's to come!
Having made a new friend, Sis is headed for happiness.
Trying to make up for their first failed attempt, Sis and Arima date like crazy. And finally, the fateful day.
Ah, so embarrassing.
