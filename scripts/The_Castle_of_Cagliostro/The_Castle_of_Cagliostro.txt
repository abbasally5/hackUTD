Gang:
They're getting away!
Get 'em!
Get in the car!
Grab the guns!
Look out!
Whoa!
Oh, boy...
Ugh...
Son of a bitch!



Jigen:
Billions of bucks with unmarked serials!
We're rich bastards!

Lupin:
Hey, don't drown me in it!
I've got a lot of spending to do before I die!

Jigen:
If you don't kill us with your driving first!

Lupin:
Hmm?

Jigen:
What's wrong, Lupin?

Lupin:
It's fake.

Jigen:
Huh?

Lupin:
This stuff is counterfeit. Top quality, too.

Jigen:
You're kidding.
They're bogus?
Aww, you're just pulling my chain.
These look real to me!

Lupin:
They're Goat Bills.

Jigen:
No way!
You mean the legendary forgeries?

Lupin:
We ripped off funny money from the national casino.
Jigen, I've picked out our next job.
Let's have a pre-victory celebration!
Hee-hee!
So much for an early retirement!

Jigen:
Well, what the hell, who wants to sit around getting fat on fine wine and gourmet food with beautiful women in some lush tropical setting anyway?



Guard:
Passports please.

Lupin:
That's my dad.

Guard:
Mmhmm.
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

Lupin:
Thanks, I'm sure we will.



Jigen:
Your dad!? Hmph! I don't look that old!

Lupin:
Well, I regard you as a father figure.

Jigen:
So this is the Duchy of Cagliostro.
I've never heard of the place!

Lupin:
The smallest member of the United Nations, with a population of 3500.

Jigen:
What makes you think this burg is where the Goat Bills originate?

Lupin:
This place is infamous with the crime world. It's the black hole of counterfeiting!

Jigen:
Huh? Black hole?

Lupin:
Yeah. Snoops who get too nosy around here are never seen again.

Jigen:
Oo-oo-ooh stop, I'm scared!
Fear wears me out.
Wake me if I start smoldering...

Lupin:
Hey!

Jigen:
Hmm, what, am I burning?

Jigen:
Christ Lupin, your spare's balder than a flat.

Lupin:
Peaceful, isn't it?
...Hmm?
Hmm!?

Lupin and Jigen:
Huh?

Jigen:
What the...!?

Lupin:
Get in!

Jigen:
Hey!

Lupin:
Hang on!

Lupin:
Oh, everybody's in a big hurry!

Jigen:
Who we chasing?

Lupin:
The girl!

Jigen:
That figures.

Lupin:
Their tires!

Lupin:
Aah!
Oh shit!

Jigen:
Damn! They didn't buy that off the lot!

Lupin and Jigen:
Aah!

Jigen:
Finally, some excitement around here!

Lupin:
I'm going up!

Jigen:
Watch it!
Tree!
Oh, oh!

Lupin:
There they are!

Jigen:
This calls for something more heavy-duty.
Yes!

Lupin:
Hey! Hey, hello!
...What?
She's unconscious!

Jigen:
Her car's coming apart.

Lupin:
Here, take the wheel!

Jigen:
Huh? Aah!

Jigen:
Watch it!

Lupin:
Huh!?
Aagh!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:4:&lt;h2&gt; 
Lupin:
Ow!
Oh n-n-n-n-no! Stop! Stop! Hold on! Hold on! Wait!
Stay! Staaay--!



Clarisse:
...No!

Lupin:
Hey! Cut it out!
Stop, or we're gonna fall!
Look down! Look down!
Phew...
There. Now you just stay like that, okay?

Clarisse:
Are you all right? Sir?

Lupin:
Oh, m--

Clarisse:
Ah! It's okay. There.
I have to go!

Man:
There she is!
Fend her off!

Jigen:
Lupin! You alive?
Thought you were a goner!

Lupin:
...Hmm?
Where'd my bride go?

Jigen:
She left you at the altar.

Lupin:
Damn!

Jigen:
Who the hell were those goons? And the dame?
Hmm? Hey, it's a ring!

Lupin:
I swear I've seen this some-- (gasps)
Hmm...



Jigen:
Are you gonna tell me what's going on or not?
I caught that weird look in your eye when you saw the ring.
Ow! Slow down, will ya!?



Jigen:
Hmm?
We rushed here to look at an old ruined castle!?
Hmm? It's the very same crest that was on her ring. Hmm...
Lupin?
This place hasn't been abandoned long.
Fire, huh?

Christopher:
Who are you?

Lupin:
Just a couple of passersby.

Christopher:
Tourists, eh?

Lupin:
Yeah, you could say that.
I was under the impression that this was the Grand Duke's palace.
I must be wrong.

Christopher:
No mistake in that--this is it.
Which means you're trespassing on private property.

Jigen:
You call this a palace?
It's just a burned-out shell!

Christopher:
There was a fire here seven years back.
The Duke and his wife died in the flames.
Since then, the place has been left to decay in the elements.

Jigen:
The Grand Duke was sort of, uh, like your king, wasn't he?
Does that mean you don't have a ruler now?

Christopher:
There's a regent, and folks say there's no cause to worry.
Now you two leave the way you come!

Jigen:
Old coot!
Where you going?



Lupin:
Well you've grown up, haven't you?
What's up?

Jigen:
Don't play dumb with me.
Talk!

Lupin:
No, no, no, no, no...!

Jigen:
You're not gonna keep a secret from me!
Come on! Talk!

Lupin:
Nooo!

Jigen:
Tell me!

Lupin:
Okay, I'll talk! I'll talk!



Jigen:
Now that's what I call upscale living!

Lupin:
The castle of Count Cagliostro, the regent.
Now look over there.
Down more.
To the right, past the aqueduct.

Jigen:
Hmm? Well I'll be damned!
That's the boat we saw earlier.

Lupin:
They docked in the old floodgate.
The place is still the same.

Jigen:
Are you telling me you've broken in there before?

Lupin:
I tried to, more than ten years ago, to uncover the secret of the Goat Bills.
I was just a young punk back then.

Jigen:
Yeah, so what happened?

Lupin:
I got a royal butt-kicking!
And I, um, ran off with my tail between my legs.

Jigen:
...Hmm?
I didn't think they still flew autogyros!

Lupin:
The Count does.

Jigen:
Hmm...

Lupin:
Let's go find a room for the night.

Jigen:
Huh?



Count:
You were very careless, Jodo.

Jodo:
I beg your forgiveness, My Lord.
It occurred while she was being fitted for her wedding gown.
She slipped away when the guards left her to change.

Count:
She's in the north tower now?

Jodo:
Yes, My Lord.
The lady has been heavily sedated.

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:6:&lt;h2&gt; 
Count:
Foreigners?

Jodo:
Yes. Two men, My Lord.
They assisted the lady in alluding her pursuers.

Count:
Find them.
And have the interlopers dealt with!



Count:
Hmm? It's gone!
I need that ring!
Summon Jodo!



Man:
Another beer, please.

Waitress:
Okay!

Lupin:
Hmm... the inscription's in Capran, a dead language.

Jigen:
So, can you read it?

Lupin:
'Course.
"When light and shadow are joined once again, it shall be restored. AD 1517."
The date's in Roman numerals.

Jigen:
That thing's over 400 years old!

Waitress:
Sorry for the wait, gents.

Lupin:
Ooh, delicious!

Waitress:
Something sure has your attention!
What is that?

Lupin:
Oh, it's just an old ring I found.
Maybe it's worth something.

Waitress:
Oh, it's beautiful!
That's the royal crest of Lady Clarisse!

Lupin:
Clarisse?

Waitress:
There's an old photo of her over the bar, see?
That was taken when she was a child.
She just returned from the convent yesterday.
I'll bet she's gorgeous now!

Lupin:
A convent?

Waitress:
Don't you know?
I thought both of you were here like everyone else who came to watch the wedding of Lady Clarisse and the Count.

Lupin:
I see. Well, that explains all the sightseers in this place.

Waitress:
I don't envy Clarisse though.
The Count's got a reputation as a playboy.

Lupin:
Playboy? Just like me!
Now, how 'bout a smooch, huh?

Waitress:
(Giggling) Aah, you!

Man:
What a wild time! We had a blast!

Lupin:
That guy was one of the Count's men.

Jigen:
I know.

Lupin:
Hey, you hog!

Jigen:
That dame's not enough; they want that ring, too!

Lupin:
No you don't!

Jigen:
You've known the whole time that girl was the Grand Duke's daughter, haven't ya?

Lupin:
Hmm? I thought I mentioned it.



Jigen:
"When light and shadow are joined once again, it shall be restored," huh?
Do you think "it" is a treasure?

Lupin:
Ah!

Lupin:
Hey, look!
The whole gang's here!

Jigen:
Bullets don't work.

Lupin:
They're trained killers!

Jigen:
Whoa!
Dirty bastards!

Lupin:
Hee-hee.

Jigen:
Let's go! Let's go!!

Jigen:
Oh, yeah, that was fun!

Lupin:
That was a full-scale attack they launched.
I think we hit a nerve.

Jigen:
And I thought this would be dull.



Count:
These bills are inferior.
The quality's becoming worse in the new batches.

Man:
It is a problem, sir.
But it can't be avoided if we continue mass-producing them.

Count:
Redo them.
We can't miss that delivery date.

Man:
Yes, sir.

Count:
Who's there?

Jodo:
My Lord, I come bearing you bad news.
I have failed you.
The rats escaped the trap.

Count:
Hmm?
Jodo, what is that stuck to your back?

Jodo:
Huh?
What the...?
Why that...!

Fujiko:
Lupin?

Jodo:
Lupin's calling card!

Count:
Read it.

Jodo:
But My Lord, the message--it's...

Count:
Do it.

Jodo:
"To the lecherous and greedy Count,

I shall purloin your bride.
That day will come soon.

Signed Lupin III."

Count:
Mmhmm... very convenient.

Jodo:
Huh?

Count:
Just wait for the man.
Lupin will come here to us.

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:8:&lt;h2&gt; 
Man:
That's it over there.

Jigen:
Boy, you got here quick.

Goemon:
What's the job?

Jigen:
Goemon's here.

Lupin:
Yeah, so is someone else.

Jigen:
Who?

Lupin:
Take a look.

Jigen:
Huh? Japanese cops here?

Lupin:
It's Zenigata.

Jigen:
What!?

Cop:
Hey, everybody out!
Break formation.

Lupin:
And now the players are all in place.
Ow, hot, hot hot!

Zenigata:
Forgive me for barging in like this.
You see, I'm Zenigata of Interpol, sir.
We've received a report that Lupin sent one of those notorious calling cards to you.

Count:
Ah, you're no doubt referring to the grandson of the petty thief Arsene Lupin.
Is Interpol in the habit of interrupting people's meals for such trivial matters.

Zenigata:
Lupin is very treacherous, Your Excellency.
He'll rob you right under your nose.
Your wedding is just five days off.
Until then, please, let me keep a round-the-clock watch of your castle.

Count:
We have law enforcement too, although we prefer the refined term of 'Royal Guard.'

Gustav:
My Lord, you rang?

Count:
Gustav, I expect you to give your full cooperation to our guest Inspector Zenigata.

Gustav:
xxxx.

Zenigata:
Your Excellency, Lupin is a master thief.
Why is he after your bride?

Count:
Huh.
You tell me you're the one who's a great detective, aren't you?

Zenigata:
Good-bye, Count.

Jodo:
Do you think it's wise to have the fellows inside the castle, my Lord?

Count:
Don't worry.
I have influential friends even at Interpol.
Our guests will be leaving soon.


Lupin:
Yep, you can always rely on good old Zenigata, devoted archetypal Japanese worker.


Zenitaga:
What is that?

Gustav:
Do not proceed any further please.

Zenitaga:
Why?

Gustav:
Observe.

Zenitaga:
Ah!

Gustav:
If you don't want to be killed, don't wander around.
Please tell that to your men, too,

Zenitaga:
Hm!

Cop:
Sir, I'm picking up anti-personnel radar.

Zenitaga:
Hmm, this is fishy.
There're a lot of extra security here for your average(xxx) count.


Goemon:
A woman?

Jigen:
Relax. It's not what you're thinking.
Lupin just rescued some bride, then everything is snowball.

Goemon:
What's important with the ring in all this?

Jigen:
We'll find out after we nail the girl from that lecherous fart Cagliostro.
And anyway, my Magnum couldn't dent their hardware.
Let's see how they do against your sword and this anti-tank gun.
Hey, Lupin. Find a way in yet?

Lupin:
Nope. Can't swing a dead cat without hitting the lasers and radar.

Jigen:
That sucks, wish we had a tank...

Goemon:
That's why you sent for Zenigata.

Jigen:
What!? Did you?

Lupin:
I did. Goemon, good call.

Goemon:
Pit your foes against one another, huh?

Lupin:
Here is Cagliostro castle.
In here we are.
This old Roman aqueduct is still in use.
And it's the only way to get in.
The castle water is supplied by the lake.
And it's brought in via the aqueduct.

Jigen:
So, no lasers in the water because no one is crazy enough to come in that way. I like it.
Goemon, keep watch here.

Jigen:
Wow...

Lupin:
I forgot to mention the hole,

Jigen:
I forgot to mention the piranhas and crocodiles zigging.

Lupin:
Shut up.

Jigen:
Hmm. The first hurdle.

Lupin:
Let's go!

Jigen:
Lupin!

Jigen:
Well, this must be the clock machinery room.
Hope that poor SOB made it.


Zenigata:
Hmm? What's that windmill for?

Cop:
Gustav told me it is used to bring water up to the castle.

Zenigata:
Hmm, where does it come out?

Cop:
Um, that's a fountain on the battlement.

Zenigata:
Hm, c'mon!

Cop:
Yes, sir!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:10:&lt;h2&gt; 
Cop:
Inspector!
Orders just came from Paris Headquarters! "We'll pull out at once"

Zenigata:
What!? That's ridiculous! We can't!
Lemme talk to him!

Zenigata:
But we got a sound evidence.
That was a written threat from Lupin!
Hm? He said what?
Well too bad if the count Cagliostro is well or he's gonna twist(xxx), I'm a cop, not a court jester!
Hey, Hello! Are you there?!

Zenigata:
It seems I have to have a little chat with his Highness!

Lupin:
Old boy, Lead the way.


Zenigata:
I wanna see the Count at once! Did you hear me?! Right now!

Gustav:
Halt!
Only authorized persons and guests are allowed to pass at here.

Zenigata:
You mean the officers in Interpol aren't authorized!?

Gustav:
You all ought to vacate the premises.
I must ask you to leave.

Zenigata:
How would you know about that order?!

Gustav:
We don't need your Orientals to help us catch a burglar.
Now, go!

Zenigata:
Rest assured we'll be back.
We are pulling out for now!

Cop:
Sir!


Gustav:
Hm?

Zenigata(Lupin):
Tell me, was I just up here?!

Gustav:
What?

Zenigata(Lupin):
That was Lupin, that disguised as me, trying to sneak in here, rube!
Didn't you see through that with your old grown xxx head!

Gustav:
Follow me!

Zenigata(Lupin):
Don't let that xxx get away!

Gustav:
Hold it right there
You cannot run, Lupin!

Zenigata:
Lupin?!
Stop it! Damn it!
That's Lupin!
I'm not, you hear me?!

Cop:
Protect the Inspector and our men there!
Go! Go! Go!

Lupin:
Wow, calls it a crash.

Zenigata:
He's Lupin!
Damn it!

Zenigata:
Lupin!

Lupin:
Ah!

Zenigata:
Ahhhh! Lupiiinnn....!

Butler:
It appears we caught someone.

Jodo:
The fool.
He should've left when we gave him a chance.
What happened to the guards?
Gustav!
What the hell is he doing leaving his post?!
Stay here while I look for him.

Butler:
Yes, sir.

Lupin:
Sorry, old boy, tee-hee.

Jodo:
Get your men back to the station, this is in minutes!
You idiot!
Lupin tricked you, now he's in the castle.

Gustav:
xxx!

Jodo,Gustav:
Ah!

Jodo:
Let go! Let go! I can't hold on!

Gustav:
My God!

Count:
Ha ha ha...
So Lupin got inside after all.

Jodo:
I have no excuses, my Lord...

Count:
Inform the Mr. Zenigata's men that he went back to the head quarter ahead of them.
People vanish well while traveling all the time.

Jodo:
Yes, my Lord.


Lupin:
Don't move!
Good evening, Fujiko.

Fujiko:
Lupin!

Lupin:
As usual, you look your loveliest when you're absorbed in work.

Fujiko:
I cannot believe you made it in here.

Lupin:
That's all you have to say after a year, I'm crushed.
Huh, I searched the world for you.

Fujiko:
Uh-huh, you can stop the sweet talk, I know you came for Clarisse.

Lupin:
Oh, well, yeah, that's true.

Fujiko:
If I tell you where she is, will you promise not to interfere with my job?

Lupin:
Yes! Yes! For you, anything.

Fujiko:
All right.
At the top of the North Tower, but I'm afraid it is impossible to get into the place.
Oh? Lupin?


Lupin:
Damn. When they locks someone up, they aren't kidding around,

Lupin:
Come on!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Come here, wait, wait!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:12:&lt;h2&gt; 
Clarisse:
Ah! Who's there?

Lupin:
I'm just a simple thief of the night, my lady.

Clarisse:
I have nothing to steal.

Lupin:
Well, hello there, Miss bride.

Clarisse:
Ah! You-you're the man who rescued me!

Lupin:
You forgot this,

Clarisse:
Ah, you came just for this?
But you'll be killed if the count finds out you're here!

Lupin:
Just another occupational hazard.
It comes with the job.
I'll leave when my work is finished.

Clarisse:
But what work?
Because I'm a prisoner, all I have are a few pieces of furniture.
Is not much to offer.
Wait! You can take this. My ring.

Lupin:
What I came seeking is the precious jewel that an evil sorcerer has locked away in a dark forbidden tower.

Clarisse:
Uh?

Lupin:
Will you consent this humble thief will liberate the lovely gem.

Clarisse:
Meaning me?

Lupin:
Uh-huh.
Like a beautiful treasure that hidden away in a shadowy vault.
An innocent maiden is forced to marry against her will, but an outlaw whisks her to freedom.
Ooh...
You see, heroism goes along with my job.
Uh-huh.

Clarisse:
Then you've come to get me out of here?

Lupin:
Uh-huh. Hm?

Clarisse:
I truly appreciate this.
But you don't know about the terrible secrets of the Cagliostro family.
I'll never be able to escape the Count.
Please just go...

Lupin:
Hmmm....
How can it be a happy ending to this romantic tale?
The fair damsel believes in the power of the wicked sorcerer, yet she has no faith in the powers of the thief.
Oh, if only she'd believe in him!
Then he'd be able to fly through the air!
Or drink every last drop of water in the lake in one gulp!
One... gulp...

Clarisse:
Huh?

Clarisse:
Oh...

Lupin:
This'll have to do for now.

Clarisse:
Oh...

Lupin:
Hahaha...

Clarisse:
Hehehe...

Clarisse:
Ah!

Clarisse:
I'm sorry!

Lupin:
Hey, treat the lady gently, you lousy gorillas!

Count:
I must offer you my thanks for returning the ring, Lupin.

Lupin:
And I wanna thank you, Count, for this warm reception.

Count:
I regret that we have to dispose of you.

Lupin:
I warn you. I'm not an easy guy to get rid of.

Clarisse:
Oh, Count! Please let him go!
You have what you want now!

Lupin:
Don't forget fair damsel, you've got to have faith in the thief.

Clarisse:
Mr. Thief!

Lupin:
Hey, don't worry about me, all right?
I'll be back real soon.
Well, now, what game shall we play, hm?

Count:
They'll rip you to shreds if I give the word, but I don't want my fiancee's boudoir stained with the blood of a petty criminal.

Lupin:
I'll make you regret that, you pompous drip.

Count:
I've grown weary of you, Lupin.
Ta-ta.

Clarisse:
Ah...

Count:
If the fall doesn't kill him, that pit is a foul hell from which there is no escape.

Clarisse:
Ah...

Count:
That pretty face has already tempted a man to his doom.
No question, you're a Cagliostro.
You'll make a fitting wife.

Clarisse:
Monster! Cold-blooded murderer!

Count:
You're so right. I do indeed have blood on my hands, but you do as well.
My family has served in the shadow of the Grand Duke for centuries, carrying out his assassinations and plots to support this country.

Clarisse:
You're disgusting! Don't touch me!

Count:
Don't feign ignorance with me, Clarisse!
You're as much a Cagliostro as I am.
In both our veins flows the ancient blood of the ram.
We share a common heritage and its legacy.
My lovely, you know our bloodline has been divided--for 400 years the Light and Shadow have been kept apart.
It's time to reunite the houses of Cagliostro.
Look!
When the golden ram of my house is joined with your house of the silver ram, then it will be revealed the hidden treasure of our ancient ancestors.

Lupin:
I heard that, you dirty so-and-so!
Clarisse, he's just marrying you for the treasure!

Count:
It's him!

Lupin:
The counterfeiting count!
Everything he says or does is phony!
Bloodline be damned!
That girl's a wonderful person, nothing like you, you nasty old goat!

Clarisse:
Is that really you, Lupin?

Lupin:
Yup. The one and only.
Because you believed in the thief, he was able to fly through the air!
I'll be winging my way to you soon and steal you from here, okay?

Clarisse:
Okay.

Count:
Damn you! It's the ring!

Clarisse:
Aiiieee!

Count:
Give me that!

Lupin:
Okay Count, listen up!
So help you, if you lay one slimy finger on Clarisse, your precious little ring is gonna end up like this!

<Bang!>

Count:
Grrr! It's fake!

Lupin:
How rude!
You sure do know how to make a guest feel unwelcome!

Count:
He fell?

Jodo:
Probably.

Count:
Make sure!

Jodo:
That rank abyss is not a place for the living, sir.
Let him rot; in a while he'll be dead.

Count:
Lupin still possesses the ring.

Jodo:
I'll handle it, My Lord.

Count:
Just wait--I'll bring your dear thief back to you flayed and quartered!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:14:&lt;h2&gt; 
Lupin:
Hmm... must be previous uninvited visitors.
It does have a certain rustic charm.
Some fresh paint, curtains, new plants, maybe track lighting...

Centuries of political murder, and for what?
Rest in peace, you poor bastards.

"Here Gennosuke Kawakami, spy for the Japanese army, met his end. Avenge me."
Hmm...

Zenigata:
Hmm? Aah! Lupin!
I got you now, you little weasel!

Lupin:
Yeah, it's nice to see you too, Old Man.

Zenigata:
Be quiet, I'm taking you in!
Just show me the way out!

Lupin:
But I fell in, same as you.
It looks like you've been wandering around here for a while.

Zenigata:
Shut up!
I won't take pity from a punk!

Lupin:
You might as well get cozy--there seems to be no way out of here.
'Scuse me there, my good buddy.
Say Old Man, got a light?

Zenigata:
Lupin, what the hell gives with the cadaver tone?
Doesn't seem like a catacomb.

Lupin:
Take a peek at the wall there.

Zenigata:
Good God!
May your soul be at rest, old soldier.

I had a gut feeling something was suspicious about this place... but what kind of secret is worth so much trouble to hide?
That's why you're here, isn't it?

Lupin:
That's what Fujiko's trying to find out.
Hope she won't meet a fate like these boys.
At any rate, worrying won't do a lick of good right now.
Let's get some shut-eye.
Good night, Old Man.



Jigen:
Christ, it's cold out here.
I'm freezing my fricking ass off!
Damn, he's been in there a long time... how does it look?

Goemon:
I've seen nothing.

Jigen:
Well I'll guess we'll have to keep waiting.



Jodo:
What's keeping them?

Jodo's assistant:
Mr. Jodo, look!

Jodo:
Ah, they found the ring!

Jodo and his assistant:
I can't swim!
Hey, wait!
Curse you!
You'll pay for this!



Zenigata:
Huh? These are coffins.
Huh!?

Lupin:
Well, this brings a whole new meaning to the whole business.

Zenigata:
What the hell is all this stuff?

Lupin:
Whoa...

Zenigata:
These are 10,000-yen bills!
And so is the whole heap!

Lupin:
Oh... exceptional quality.
Hey, Old Man! Check it out!

Zenigata:
West German Deutsche Marks also!

Lupin:
Pound notes. Dollars. Francs. Rubles. Rupees. Pesos, lira, shekels!
Huh? Wow, even Chinese won!
The whole world's represented here!

Zenigata:
A major counterfeiting ring...
Lupin! Do you think this is what they're hiding?

Lupin:
Bingo.
The birthplace of Goat Bills, legendary fakes you can't tell apart from the real thing.
The notorious imitation currency that silently brought about the upheavals in medieval Europe.
It caused the collapse of the Bourbon Dynasty, provided Napoleon with funding, and eventually triggered the Great Bank Panic of 1927.
Goat Bills were responsible for some of history's most influential and devastating events in the last 400 years.
And those who came here looking for the source, never left.

Zenigata:
I've always heard tell about them... but who'd suspect a tiny country'd be behind it all?

Clarisse:
It's coming from underground!

Goemon:
Hmm? Movement.

Jigen:
That's our boy!




Man:
Move! Move! Move! Move!

Man:
Come on!



Man:
Sir! The fire appears to have started in the printing plant!

Count:
Put it out immediately, dammit!

Man:
Yes, my Lord!

Count:
Shut that blasted door! Go on, idiots! Help them!
Jodo, have you disappointed me once again?



Lupin:
Hey, Old Man!
Shake a leg and our company ought to be here soon!

Zenigata:
Evidence! I need evidence!!



Jodo:
That doesn't go!

Man:
Huh?

Jodo:
Lupin and that cop did this!
Find those bastards! They're probably still in here!

Gustav:
Fine, Get in there!

Man:
Yes sir!

Gustav:
It's Lupin and Zenigata! After them!

Jodo:
Put out the fire!

Gustav:
[Deah!]

Lupin:
We're in the chapel!

Zenigata:
This way!

Man:
What's that?!

Clarisse:
It's my thief!

Fujiko:
Lupin and Zenigata?
The autogyro is up there.

Man:
They're up there!

Man:
Stop, you!

Count:
Imbecile!

Jodo:
You can rake me over the coals later.
They're after Lady Clarisse! Hurry, sir!

Zenigata:
Get a move on!

Gustav:
Halt!

Zenigata:
You wanna tangle with the Tokyo Metro Police?!

Lupin:
Old Man, we're leaving!

Zenigata:
Sayonara!

Lupin:
I'm afraid we've gotta make a small detour.

Zenigata:
Kidnapping a cop is illegal!

Lupin:
No, we're on a rescue.

Clarisse:
Ah, they're coming here!

Fujiko:
Stand back.

Grenade-proof. That figures!

Clarisse:
Save yourselves! We can't break the window out!

Lupin:
Old Man, take over!

Zenigata:
What?! Hey, Lupin! Wait! I can't fly this thing!

Lupin:
Someone call for a cab?

Clarisse:
Oh, mister thief!

Lupin:
Your chariot awaits, my Lady.
C'mon, throw me a line!

Fujiko:
Quit bossing me around!

Clarisse:
Fujiko!

Fujiko:
Hurry!

Clarisse:
My hero!

Lupin:
Here we are. You're safe now!

This way, Old Man! Down over here!

Zenigata:
I'm trying, you idiot!

Lupin:
That's it! A little closer!
Uh? Uh-huh... Argh!

Fujiko:
Lupin!

Jodo:
Don't move, you meddling bitch!

Count:
Fujiko, I think I'll have to interrogate you later in my chambers.
Jodo, finish off Lupin now.

Jodo:
Yes, sir.

Clarisse:
No, please, I'm begging you!
You have to kill me before you kill him!

Count:
Fire.

Hmmm... I admire your devotion, Clarisse.
Get the ring for me and I'll forgive you dear.
Become my wife without a fight, then I'll even let your thief live.
Or you can both die right now together.
Which will it be, Clarisse?

Clarisse:
Lupin, where's the ring?

Lupin:
No, Clarisse. Don't do it. He's a liar...

Fujiko:
His collar. He always hides stuff under there.

Lupin:
Dammit, Fujiko!

Clarisse:
All right! I have the ring!
If you want it, let Fujiko and this man go, or else I'll throw it into the lake!

Count:
I swear on my life.
Now please put on the ring and come here!

Jodo:
Shall I shoot?

Count:
Wait until I have the ring.
Hm?

Zenigata:
Incoming!

Count:
Shoot! Don't let them escape!

Clarisse:
No!
Lupin was right! You are a liar!

Count:
I would never let anyone leave here alive who saw those printing presses!
Ha ha ha. Finally it's mine! Ha ha ha.

Fujiko:
Hey, you owe me for today, honey.
Bye!

Jigen:
Man! Pulling out even before we get to join in!

Zenigata:
Hang on! We're gonna down!
Jump for it!

Goemon:
This is unworthy of my blade...

Zenigata:
Lupin! Don't even think about dying before I arrest you!



British Guy:
We have a sticky wicket here.

Guy:
Implicated xxx

Italian Guy:
xxx thing is.
It has xxx brought us some kind.

Zenigata:
Let me bust this guy!
Look at the evidence. There's no better proof!
I saw it myself!
There were printing presses everywhere!

Interpol Chief:
We understand that, Inspector.

Zenigata:
Hmm?

Interpol Chief:
We have a high-level political dilemma.
Interpol's exercise of authority would not be recommended at this matter at all.

Zenigata:
What do you mean?!
We've got Cagliostro dead to rights.

French Guy:
It is not that simple.
Even Interpol cannot force a criminal investigation.
A United Nations' independent member.

German Guy:
The situation is not very in our favor.
Have you seen the front page headling of the leading global newspapers?
"Courageous Count defends Fiancee."
"Theif's attempt to kidnap Princess fails."

Guy:
Along with reports of a henchman disguised as you.

Zenigata:
Henchman, my eye, that was me!

Japanese Guy:
That seems like a rash behavior for a man of your standing.

Zenigata:
Do you guys care about the truth or not?!

U.S. Guy:
That's relevant. The world believes what we want to.

French Guy:
It believes the Count!

Russian Guy:
I heard the rumor that the Count has many friends in the Western governments.
The truth could be way embarrassing to some nations.

U.S. Guy:
Especially for a certain country that placed a huge order for U.S. counterfeit dollars!

Russian Guy:
Yeah, I suppose this fake rubles were not xxx by the CIA?

Guy:
Gentlemen, please!
This is neither the time xxx or your nations' quarrels.

Guy:
The only way to deal with this is for each country does.

Guy:
Have ever told problem this xxx

Police man:
Inspector, we're ready to mobilize.
Just give the word, we'll leave for the castle at any time.

Zenigata:
No one's going.

Police man:
Huh?

Zenigata:
The sooner they find a replacement for me, the better then we can get off this damn case.
All you just get ready to go home.



Christopher:
It's me.
Some food.

Jigen:
Great! Thank you!

Christopher:
How's your friend doing?

Jigen:
Better. His fever broke.
Thanks to the treatment you gave him.

Christopher:
You know, it's the hound you oughta be grateful to.

Jigen:
Hm?

Christopher:
That old animal doesn't like anyone.
But when you brought your friend here, the dog refused to leave his side.
Not for that, I'd have never hidden you boys.

Lupin:
Karl, old boy.

Christopher:
Hmm?

Jigen:
Hey, look! He's awake!
Welcome back, pal. How're you feeling?

Lupin:
Jigen... Goemon... it's sure been a long time.

Jigen:
Long time? Whoa. Why'd he say that?

Goemon:
Seems his wounds have temporarily out all his memory.

Lupin:
Good boy.
Why aren't you out romping with your owner today, Karl?

Christopher:
How does a complete stranger like you know this dog's name?
The only other person besides myself who knows it is Karl is Mistress, Lady Clarisse.

Lupin:
Pretty name.
So, a woman called Clarisse owns you, huh fella?
Hmm... Clarisse

Jigen:
Lupin...?

Lupin:
How many days have I been out!?
Jigen, tell me! How long?!

Jigen:
Um, well... three.

Lupin:
Wedding...
He marries her tomorrow! I have to-- Urgh!

Jigen:
Hey, you can't push it. You're gonna reopen your injuries.

Lupin:
Bring me food... I gotta eat something!

Jigen:
Want some mush? Porridge?

Lupin:
I've lost blood, Jigen!
I don't wanna eat baby food. I want a feast!

Jigen:
Oh, well... that won't be easy...

Christopher:
I'll see what I can do.

Jigen:
You damn fool!
Stop stopping yourself. Your stomach can't handle it.

Lupin:
Clam up!
Gimme 12 hours and I'll be fine.

Jigen:
See, what did I tell ya?
You turned into green. You want a bucket?
Huh? You what?
Lupin said he's full...



Christopher:
I see. So he did it for the princess.

Jigen:
As not much I can do now as he's hurt.

Goemon:
You seem to have a deep connection to Lady Clarisse from the past.

Christopher:
I've always tended the palace gardens.
As a girl, the princess loved flowers and plants.
After her parents were killed in the fire, she was sent off to the convent.
She gave Karl to me be she left.

Jigen:
So when the dog got a whiff of Lupin, it probably picked up Clarisse's scent.

Christopher:
Possibly. But that doesn't explain how he knows the dog's name.

Jigen:
Hey, when he tried to rescued the girl, maybe she mentioned it.

Lupin:
That's not how I know.

Jigen:
You're awake already, huh?

Lupin:
It was just ten short years ago.
I was a kid stepping out on my own, fearless and eager to take on the world.
I had more enthusiasm than brains.
Stupidly, I decided to find the wellspring of the Goat Bills.
Somehow, I staggered to the shore, but I collapsed, unable to move another inch.

Clarisse:
Karl, what's the matter? Did you find something?

Lupin:
When she ran off, I thought my goose were cooked for sure.

Clarisse:
Here, Mister?

Lupin:
Huh?

Clarisse:
Water.

Lupin:
Oh...

Lupin:
Her little hands trembled that she gave me the glass of waster.
That's when I happened to notice the ring.
I'm almost embarrassed to say, I'd forgotten all about it until I saw the ring again.

Jigen:
Hear that? It's Fujiko's bike!

Lupin:
It's a clipping from today's paper.
"Tomorrow, an archbishop is arriving from the Vatican to perform the marriage."
Hmm... Hehehe.



Zenigata:
Go away...
Talk I'm a busy man!
Fujiko?!
How do you know he's gonna hit the wedding?!
Yes, sure?

Fujiko:
Your superiors wouldn't fault you for going back there to catch a thief, right?

Zenigata:
That's right! Excellent!



Driver:
We have to get through here! Move it!

Guy:
Hey, you blind?
Did you happen to notice this traffic jam?

Woman:
Yeah, there's a landslide, walking the road up ahead.

Archbishop:
There must be some other way we can take.
We can't be late for the wedding!

Pastor:
Excuse me.

Archbishop:
Huh?

Pastor:
Would you by any chance be the archbishop?
Ah, yes, I can see you are.
Please would you mind blessing this lamb, xxx?

Driver:
You live here?
Do you know any other way to Castle Cagliostro?

Pastor:
Sure. Nearby, there's an old country road.
Hop in please!

Driver:
Fantastic! Will you show us where it is?

Pastor:
Mm-hm.
Of course. Anything for the archbishop.



Zenigata:
Put some muscle into it, will ya!?
We gotta make it to the castle by nightfall!
Just one more hill, men!



Gustav:
Are you sure this is
It doesn't not see like a good idea to bring a TV crew in here?

Jodo:
His Excellency wants the world to witness his marriage to a proper, decent young woman.
Ah! The archbishop has finally arrived!

Gustav:
You suppose Lupin will come?

Jodo:
I have my shadows closely watching over the bride.
You just worry about watching the front gate.

Gustav:
Yeah.


 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:20:&lt;h2&gt; 

Count:
The time is at hand for light and shadow to unite.
Clarisse, come.



Archbishop:
Bring forward the proof that will validate these two as truly noble members of the ancient bloodline of Cagliostro.
In accordance with the old custom, you shall exchange these rings and recite your vows.
Clarisse d' Cagliostro, daughter of the Grand Duke of Cagliostro, if you or anyone present objects to this marriage, you must speak now.
Otherwise, silence will be accepted as a consent to this union.

I [then will] confer God's blessing upon you.

Lupin:
I object!
This wedding is soiled by the Count's evil desires.

Archbishop:
It is an omen!

Count:
Don't panic. These are earthly meddlers to our dealing with.

Lupin:
In the name of the dead who lie beneath this castle,
I have come to take your bride to be.

Archbishop:
Mamma mia! A ghost!

Count:
Stand back. Enjoy the fun.

Lupin:
Clarisse, you must come with me!

Fujiko:
What a terrible turn of events!
That scoundrel Lupin just turned out.

Man:
Stop the broadcast!

Fujiko:
Ha? What're you doing!?

Zenigata:
Let's go!!

Lupin:
Clarisse... Clarisse!
Poor girl. They drugged you, didn't they?
The evil Count didn't want you to be able to speak!

Clarisse:
Noooo!

Count:
Stay back, [xxx]. Please [xxx]!
Ha ha ha!
You were the fool. Let his friends die with him.

Archbishop(Lupin):
Don't cry, Clarisse.
Your thief can't die that easily.

Lupin:
I'm coming for you, Clarisse!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
How do you like my wedding gift, Count?!

Man:
Excellency! Look!

Lupin:
These are the counterfeit bills you made!
Take it as my payment for the rings!

Count:
Find him! He's got be in here!

Man:
Huh?

Count:
Huh?

Archbishop(Lupin):
Hee hee hee!
Well, look what I got.

Count:
What is this!?
Lupin?!

Clarisse:
You're alive!

Count:
Why, you! How dare you make a fool of me!

Lupin:
Goat-boy, chill out before you burn yourself!
Check this out! Haha!

Zenigata:
You're not getting away this time, Lupin!

Fujiko:
After experiencing some technical difficulty, we'll now zoom full coverage of the wild wedding ceremony.

Lupin:
Well, gotta run!

Count:
Die!

Man:
Follow after them!

Fujiko:
Lupin's escaping with the princess and the Count is chasing him in a rage!
Ha! Ah, now the police are joining in.

Zenigata:
Lupin's under the alter!
All right, men! Charge!

Fujiko:
Cops storming the way to the fund of the chapel.
Oh, and here come the Count's royal guards men... led by Captain Gustav!

Zenigata:
Deploy the rear guard!
Stand your ground!

Fujiko:
The place looks like a war zone!
Most of the fighting seems to be centered around that altar?
No wonder, there's a secret underground stairway!
Hey, could that be where Lupin is hiding?
Well, let's take a camera in and find out!


 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:22:&lt;h2&gt;

What is that idiot doing?!

American Guy:
He disobeyed orders.
Recall him.

Interpol Chief:
There's no time
This is a live satellite feed.

Zenigata:
Oh-ho! What have we here?! Those look like printing presses!
Hmm? And what do I see over there?!
Oh my! These are yen. Could they be counterfeit?!

Interpol Chief:
Lord, he's a bad actor...

Fujiko:
What a terrible discovery!

Zenigata:
There's fake money of almost every nation!
I came looking for Lupin but I uncovered a criminal plot!
Oh, what to do?!



Jodo:
Go! Go! Go!

Lupin:
We're gonna get you out of here first thing.
Well, gentlemen, are you ready?

Jigen:
Always. We'll hold 'em off here.

Lupin:
Let's go!

Clarisse:
Please... promise me you'll be careful.
And you, sir Jigen.

Jigen:
Eh?

Clarisse:
Be sure both of you come back alive.
I'll never forget your chivalry.

Goemon:
You better get going.

Lupin:
Clarisse, come on! Hurry!

Clarisse:
Right!

Lupin:
See ya!

Jigen:
She called me "Sir"!

Goemon:
She is lovely.

Jigen:
Let's do some damage!

Goemon:
Tonight, you'll face this sword is like no other.



Count:
Damn it, I curse Lupin! He hasn't beaten me yet!

Jodo:
We'll secure the castle, My Lord.

Count:
Good.



Clarisse:
Your wounds hurt?

Lupin:
I never felt better.
Now, let's get through here.
Hmm?
A crest of two rams... Each one facing the other.
Putting 'em together and a message appears...
It's in Capran.
Light and shadow... It's too worn, I can't read it!

Clarisse:
When light and shadow are joined, face the sun-washed ram on high, the hour keeper and place this for them in its eyes.
There're old words that have been passed down through my family.
Are they any help to you?"

Lupin:
My dear, the mystery is solved!

Clarisse:
Ah!

Lupin:
It's the Count! This way!

Count:
They headed to the tower gear room.
Moor the boat!

Lupin:
Duck!

Count:
Look! There they are!

Lupin:
So, look [xxx] rough.

Clarisse:
Oh!

Lupin:
Run!

Count:
Turn the lasers off now.
The fools can't get out of the corner.

Clarisse:
Get down!

Lupin:
You afraid?

Clarisse:
Not really.

Lupin:
Great girl. Come on!

Man:
Don't let 'em go!

Man2:
No, no, no... Argh!

Lupin:
Don't look!

Man3:
Not that way!

Count:
Take the stairways, you half-wits.

Lupin:
Stay here. I'm gonna block the entrance.

Clarisse:
Be careful!

Lupin:
Be right back.

Man:
There he is!

Clarisse:
Behind you, Lupin!

Count:
Eeengh!

Lupin:
Hurry up!
Hi, Count old pal!

Count:
Bastard. I'll skewer you!

Lupin:
Take your best shot! It's your last chance!

Count:
Eeengh!

Lupin:
One more!

Hey!
Come and get me, Caggy! Are you scared? Hmm?
Huh?

Count:
Aha ha ha...

Clarisse:
Lupin!

Count:
I'll finish you off first, my darling fiancee!

Lupin:
Go on, Clarisse! Run!
I'll be there as fast as I can!

Count:
Where're you running off to, Clarisse? Huh?
Oh, dear. It appears that you can't go any further!
And your thief isn't here to save you this time!
What a pity.
Let the Cagliostro bloodline end here. Farewell, Clarisse!

Lupin:
Now, wait a minute, Count! Let's haggle!

Count:
It is too late!
Stand there and watch as I run the girl through!

Lupin:
Just listen to me!
I'll give you the secret of the rings,
Then take the damn treasure and do what you want with it.
In exchange, let the girl go. Set her free.
Look. See the ram crest up there?
That's the sun-washed ram on high, the hour keeper.
There's a hole in each of its eyes where the rings go.
I'll give you the rings now.
But if you hurt the girl, I'll throw them into the lake and I swear I'll kill you!

That's far enough. Thank you!
Now, send Clarisse inside!

Count:
No... I don't think so!
Ha ha ha ha. You fool!
I still had one ace up my sleeve.
Come!
The rings are back in my possession now.
And for solving the mystery, your reward, Lupin!
Aah! Oh, let go!

Lupin:
Hold on, Clarisse!

Count:
Let me go!

Lupin:
Hi, feel like standing? Feast your eyes.

Clarisse:
Wow...

Lupin:
The mysterious hidden treasure...

Clarisse:
An ancient Roman city laid out at the bottom of the lake all these ages.

Lupin:
I'm assuming the Romans built the floodgate, and they flooded the city when they were driven from here.
Your ancestors unknowingly inherited it.

Clarisse:
Hahaha...

Lupin:
Haha, good!

Lupin:
This is a treasure, all right, the one to be shared with mankind.
Too big for my pocket, anyway.

Lupin:
So, Interpol finally got off its fat ass.

Clarisse:
Does this mean you're going to leave now?

Lupin:
Hm? Hm... Well, you see...
There are some very scary men after me.

Clarisse:
Take me with you!
I know I can't be a thief yet, but I can learn!
Oh, please! I want to... I want to go with you, my thief!
I'll follow you anywhere!

Do you wanna go back into the darkness?
Why, you've only just found your way into the sunlight!
Hey, your whole life is ahead of you.
It's beginning right now.
Besides, you don't wanna be a ne'er-do-well like me.
But if you're ever in trouble, I'll come running.
Just let me know and I'll rush you to rescue you from the far reach of the earth.

Blast! Just one step behind!
The thief managed to steal again!

Clarisse:
No, he didn't take anything. I swear.
He saved my life putting his own at risk.

Zenigata:
I'm right. That devil stole something precious and priceless.

Clarisse:
Huh?

Zenigata:
Your heart, my lady.

Clarisse:

Zenigata:
Well, duty calls!
After Lupin! I won't rest until he is caught!

Christopher:
Good folks like that you sure don't meet every day.

Clarisse:
For some reason, I get a feeling that I knew Lupin a long ago.
My thief, we will meet again one day, I know it.

Jigen:
You know, she is a pretty nice kid.
You could stay if you wanted.

Lupin:
What the... Fujiko!

Fujiko:
Hey, sweetie, I really scored. Take a peek!

Lupin:
Huh? The goat bill printing plates!
Oh, yeah, that's my girl.
Whoo-hoo!

Fujiko:
