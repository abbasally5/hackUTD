  Noble #1:
The time has come.
Two hundred years have passed since the day of destruction which is said to have been brought down upon us by Darcia the First.

Noble #2:
All the necessary items have been assembled as was recorded in the Book of the Moon.

Noble #3:
The guide of the Lunar Flower, awakened at last by wolf's precious blood.
The chosen wolf whose birthright is to rule this world.
The Moonlight Crucible, which has given power to this city by converting the moonlight it is bathed in to energy.

Noble #2:
However, that role is at an end.

Noble #1:
Yes. This is the dawn of a new age, where Paradise will be opened for us Nobles, and not for the wolves.

Cher:
Cheza!

Jaguara:
I've been waiting for you.

Darcia:
I never imagined I would look upon that face again in my lifetime.

Jaguara:
The countenance of your beloved maiden.

Darcia:
She's your younger sister, as I recall.

Jaguara:
You know it as well as I. That her soul was lost ever since that day.
But you were the only one unwilling to face the truth.
So I released you from that heavy burden.
I did it all for you, my beloved.
Yes... We were only alike in face and body.
If Hamona was light, then I was shadow.
I was content with that.
And then you appeared, and thrust us into turmoil.
The unrivalled instigator, Darcia the Third.
You brought it all upon yourself.
Come, let us dance.

Noble #1:
The city's lights will soon go out.

Noble #2:
The final spell. Darcia the First once gave his life while attempting to cast it...

Noble #1:
That spell is now beginning.

Cher:
Cheza... She's withering?
It has to be the water.
No, wait... She's starting to bloom!

Kiba:
Cheza...
Cheza...
Where are you? I can't...I can't hear your song anymore...

Cheza:
Kiba...
Kiba...

Kiba:
Cheza!

Cheza:
If we do not do something, Paradise will be...

Kiba:
Cheza!

Jaguara:
The gates of Paradise are opening.
For the Nobles... No, a Paradise only for the two of us.
Come...

Toboe:
Hey, it moved just now!

Tsume:
Finally! Keep trying!

Hubb:
So that's how...
You can't open 'em that way!
Listen to me!
It looks like the locks to these cells are powered by electricity. And the flow of energy to this place is starting to become erratic.
If you slam your bodies into the doors at the same time the lights go dim, I think they'll open.
Hit it now!

Toboe:
I think he's right!

Hubb:
Try it again! You guys can do it!
Yes, just one more time!
Here we go!

Toboe:
It worked!

Hige:
Well, what d'you know? Looks like I came all this way to rescue you for nothing.
Hey.

Toboe:
Hige!
I'm so glad you're not dead!

Hige:
Well, get out of there.

Tsume:
So where the hell are you planning on taking us?

Toboe:
What're you talking about, Tsume?

Tsume:
What kind of trap are you gonna lead us into this time?
I saw them. The wolves in that hall that had been stuffed and mounted like trophies.
What happened to your collar?

Hige:
That stupid thing was just a number.

Tsume:
Then explain how you managed to waltz in here without being noticed!
Was it your mission to lure us to this keep?

Hige:
I don't know.

Tsume:
Yeah, right! You were the Nobles' dog! You helped them kill your own kind!

Hige:
If you think that's what I am, then kill me!
Please, I mean it.

Toboe:
Cut it out! That doesn't sound like you at all!

Hige:
Sound like me?
What the hell does that mean, "like me"?
How can I sound like me when I don't know who that is?

Toboe:
Well, I do.
The Hige I know is funny and nice, and kind of careless.
But he's-he's always someone you can count on.
That's the real Hige.

Hige:
Things have gotten pretty weird inside the keep.
You guys can make it out if you hurry.

Tsume:
And just where do you think you're going?

Hige:
I need to take care of something.

Toboe:
Hige!

Hubb:
What are you waiting for?
You're going after them, aren't you?
Thanks...
I'll be damned. Wolves.

Blue:
The scents are coming back.
Pops! Oh no!
He's alive.
You'll catch your death of cold if you fall asleep out here.

Quent:
Lay off, will you?

Blue:
You're not one of the locals, are you?
So where're you from, old man?

Quent:
Just what the hell difference does it make to you?

Blue:
Not much. Just making conversation.

Quent:
From Kyrios.

Blue:
Ah.

Quent:
You mean you know it?

Blue:
No, but from what I understand, the place was wiped out by Jaguara's troops ages ago. They torched the town looking for wolves.

Quent:
That's a lie! Don't you give me that crap!

Blue:
Sorry, but it's true. I heard it from some soldiers.
They were hunting a pack of wolves that just happened to pick Kyrios as a hideout.
So they burned it.

Quent:
I don't believe that for a second...
No!
I saw them with-with my own two eyes!
It was wolves... They killed him. They killed Ruus!

Blue:
The wolves didn't kill him!
You've got to believe me. Please, Pops...

Quent:
Oh my God, Blue!
Blue...

Noble #1:
At last, our Paradise is opening...

Noble #2:
Is this the world brought forth by the Moonstone?

Cheza:
Goodbye, Kiba...

Kiba:
Cheza...

Cheza:
This one... is going to wither.

Kiba:
Cheza!
Hold on!

Jaguara:
We Nobles have become lost, disconnected from the world of our birth. We quietly wait for a lonely death.
But you and I can stop time, and hold this moment forever.

Darcia:
But in this stale and stagnant moment of time, one can neither long for the past, nor change what is yet to come.

Kiba:
A fabricated Paradise. Such a place holds no future.

Jaguara:
But what of your grandfather? He too searched for a Paradise meant only for the Nobles.

Darcia:
That man thought only of himself. He cared nothing for those he left behind.
That's why he vanished. And our clan was cursed...

Kiba:
A Paradise created from a cursed world...

Kiba/Darcia:
Is meaningless.

Jaguara:
Liar.
You've been deceiving yourself from the beginning, never once giving your heart over to the truth.
Even now, when what you long for is right before your eyes.

Darcia:
It is meaningless.

Jaguara:
Because of Hamona?
You are not so ignorant. You've always known who it was for, haven't you?
That eye... Your blood... They have longed for Paradise.

Kiba/Darcia:
You're wrong.
This world is not Paradise.

Jaguara:
Who are you? What trickery is this?
It can't be! A wolf?
But why?

Darcia:
It's over.
Your Paradise has been closed.

Noble:
This is the end of everything...
The world is dying.

Kiba:
Cheza!

Cher:
Cheza!
Cheza! Cheza!
I know... I know. I saw it too.
But that-that wasn't it, Cheza.
It'll be alright. They'll come. I know they will.
It'll be alright...

Jaguara:
But why? I did it all for you...
Why, my love?
Why do you love her, and not me?
I love you, Darcia.
It's alright.
Come with me. Come to Paradise.

Darcia:
Stop it!

Jaguara:
That's right, my darling. The sword was poisoned.
My sweet but affective messenger of death.
Now you will belong to me. Forever.
Don't interfere!

Toboe:
Hige!

Cheza:
Kiba...

Jaguara:
What do you want? Get out!

Kiba:
Paradise is ours, we're taking it back!

Toboe:
Hige!

Hige:
I have to...

Toboe:
Don't try to move!

Hige:
I promised to make things right...

Toboe:
Hige!

Tsume:
That's enough!

Hige:
I gave...my word!

Jaguara:
I'll take it all. Every last ounce of your strength!
Impossible...
Darcia...

Darcia:
As I thought, you truly are the chosen wolf.

Kiba:
What are you? I have to know. You're not a wolf, or a Noble.

Darcia:
I was chosen as well.
Now I understand.
It is not merely that we search for Paradise.
But that Paradise is calling for us.

-End credits-

Cher:
All things must come to an end.
I suppose even my supple skin and beautiful looks will simply fade away one day.
Life can be so cruel.
But it's not over yet.
