  Darcia:
What have those fools done?

Elmira:
Honey, do you think something might have happened?

Honey:
Fireworks, maybe? Could be a festival, my dear Elmira.

Elmira:
Fireworks, huh? I suppose you're right.

-Opening-

Neige:
Lord Darcia, you're here...
I beg of you, please forgive me, my Lord...
Lady Jaguara's reach extended even here...

Darcia:
Jaguara...

Neige:
Please forgive me. I tried but there was nothing I could do to protect her.

Darcia:
Don't do that.
Don't do that...
Don't do that!

Neige:
They say they'll stop at nothing to kill every last wolf.

Darcia:
Those people don't know anything. None of them do.
Hamona...

Hamona:
My love, I wish to see you once more.

Darcia:
Even without the wolves, there's still this one thing I have left within me.
I have the eye of the wolf...
I can see you whenever I like.

Hamona:
I know we will meet again.

Darcia:
Yes, someday soon.

Hamona:
I love you, Darcia...

Neige:
My Lord Darcia...

Thug #1:
Get back here!
What's the matter, baby? I thought you wanted work!

Blue:
As if I'd take a job to please some filthy human!

Thug #2:
We paid the broker good money for you.
Now, be a good girl.

Hige:
You up and moving already?
Come on, guys!
I know we've been through a lot, but why all the moping?

Toboe:
I couldn't sleep, that's why.

Hige:
Yeah, well neither could I.

Tsume:
You slept like a dead man, as always.

Hige:
Look, I'm just as shocked and frustrated as the rest of you.
But none of that is gonna help us figure out what the hell to do now.
Are we gonna live here in a stupor for the rest of our lives?
Somebody say something, damn it!
Kiba! You haven't said a single word to any of us since everything happened.

Tsume:
Drop it.

Toboe:
Leave him alone. Kiba was hurt the worst, remember?

Kiba:
It's not that.
It's just...I'm really pissed off.

Thugs:
She went that way!
Get her!
Come back, damn it!
She's over there!

Hige:
Wow, what a babe...

Thug #1:
She's got friends...

Hige:
Yeah, so what's it to you?

Thug #1:
Hand over the girl.

Hige:
Why should we?

Thug #3:
She's our merchandise.

Thug #1:
Move.
You guys aren't from around here, are you?

Hige:
Yeah, so what if we aren't?

Thug #3:
There's a big demand for young bodies in this town.

Thug #2:
People pay top dollar for healthy organs.

Tsume:
You don't expect us to give up our bodies, do you?

Thug #2:
I'm going crazy... Oh, no it's the curse!
It's the curse of the House of Darcia...

Tsume:
Did you see that stupid look on their faces?

Toboe:
I know, that felt terrific.
Kiba, are you alright?

Kiba:
Yeah.

Hige:
Hey, are you alright?

Blue:
Yeah. Thanks for helping me.

Tsume:
We didn't do it for you, you know.
Those idiots just happened to catch us in a bad mood, that's all.

Hige:
She was just thanking us. Why do you have to be so harsh? It's not like we run into girls every day!
By the way, I'm Hige.

Blue:
My name is... It's Blue.
It's been a while, huh?

Hige:
Huh? You guys know each other?

Kiba:
You could say that.

Tsume:
You did some pretty nasty things to us when you were with the human.

Toboe:
That old guy... Where is he?

Blue:
Something happened, and we were split up.

Kiba:
He was still tracking us in the last city we were in.

Blue:
I know he was. That's why he was there.
Pops will track down a wolf to the ends of the earth.

Toboe:
I don't get it. Aren't you a wolf too?

Blue:
Hey, that girl! Isn't she with you?
You know, the one you guys were travelling with?
She had a...a really strange scent.

Toboe:
The girl? You mean Cheza?

Blue:
Cheza...

Hige:
Oh, uh, about that...
Well, let's just say we shouldn't talk about that right now, okay?
I know! Why don't we look for some food?
I mean, we did just bump into each other and all.
Besides, there's a whole mess of dangers for a girl on her own in a town like this.

Tsume:
Not a chance, Porky.

Hige:
Why not?

Tsume:
As if I'd ever hang with her.
She was doing everything she could to hunt us down.

Hige:
Yeah, but...

Toboe:
You know you're only saying that because it didn't happen to you.

Blue:
Forget it. I don't want to hang out with a bunch of kids, either.
See you around.

Hige:
Hey, aren't you guys being a little cold?
Hold on, it's dangerous! Wait up!

Toboe:
But Hige!

Tsume:
His tail wags whenever there's a girl around. Just let him go.

Kiba:
When we were back in that city, she found out she was half wolf. Cheza told her.

Toboe:
Half wolf?

Kiba:
That side of her must have woken up after meeting Cheza.

Toboe:
Cheza... I wonder what she's doing?
You think she's okay?

Hige:
Wait up, will you?

Blue:
You should go back. Your friends are gonna leave you behind.

Hige:
That's okay. Life's pretty boring when it's only guys.

Hubb:
I can't believe it held together this long.

Bar manager:
So you say you're from Freeze City, is that right?

Hubb:
That's right.

Bar manager:
Well, if you've come all this way to find her, she must have done something pretty awful, huh?

Hubb:
Yeah, she's a master criminal with the face of an angel.

Bartender:
Hey, wait... That's the woman.
You know, the one who drank like a fish.

Hubb:
You mean, you saw her?

Bartender:
Yeah, she came in here a while ago.
She was throwing 'em back with that old guy over there.
Mister?
Hey, Mister!

Hubb:
You again!

Quent:
I can't believe she was the woman you were looking for.

Hubb:
How did she look? Was she okay?

Quent:
Well, considering the amount of booze she was drinking, she seemed fine to me.

Hubb:
Oh, is that so...

Quent:
You'd be better off to just give up on a headstrong woman like that.

Hubb:
She only seems that way, but I know how she really is.
I've been at her side for as long as I can remember.

Quent:
Believe me, it's a big mistake to think that you know everything about someone just because you're with them all the time.

Hubb:
So I take it your search for the wolves is going well?
And where's your dog? Was she too headstrong for you?

Quent:
I guess she was. She ran off on me.
I'm so tired I can barely think.
It's gotten so bad, I don't even know what the hell I've been searching for.

Hubb:
Wolves, remember?

Quent:
Yeah... It was the wolves.
It's always been wolves.

Hubb:
I'd love to stay and chat, but I really don't have the time.
Excuse me.

Quent:
I've always had the suspicion...
Ever since my boy found Blue and brought her home, even though she was just a pup, I figured she had some wolf blood in her.
That's the reason she was able to track down the wolves so well.

Hubb:
I've never been good with drunks.

Toboe:
I wonder where Hige ran off to?

Tsume:
Once he gets dumped, he'll come sulking back.

Toboe:
I'm gonna go look around for him. Just take it easy 'til I get back.

Kiba:
That's the same crest from the castle where Cheza was held.

Tsume:
This area must still be part of that Noble's territory.

Kiba:
The curse of the House of Darcia, huh?

Tsume:
What?

Kiba:
That's what the guy back there said when he saw us.

Tsume:
Humans have always seen wolves that way. That's why they're so scared of us.
Why didn't you let 'em have it back there?
I would have expected you to jump at the chance to rip those humans to pieces.
It's not 'cause of your injuries, is it?

Kiba:
Even if we had killed them, I doubt they would've tasted very good.

Tsume:
Can't argue with that.

Hige:
So how come those guys were chasing you, anyway?

Blue:
I thought that I should work, you know?

Hige:
Work? I've never given it much thought.

Blue:
That's how it's supposed to be, huh...
But it's hard to let go of when it's all you've ever known.
For my entire life, I've been at Pops' side, always wanting to be useful to him somehow...if I could.
I'll bet from your point of view, choosing to live that way must sound like complete nonsense.
But the thing is... I was always happy being that way.
If nothing had happened, I could have stayed happy forever.

Quent:
There were wolves.
It was as if they were mocking me.
They took away everything in my life that was precious to me.

Blue:
I don't know what happened, or if it really was wolves who killed everyone.
But even so, that's what Pops believes.

Hige:
Man, and just because of that, he hates all wolves?

Blue:
If I had stayed ignorant of what I was, I would've been able to remain at Pops' side forever.
If I had never met that girl, I could have kept on living the way it always had been.
If I hadn't learned that there was some wolf in me...

Hige:
So what're you gonna do now? You want to go back to that guy?

Blue:
I can't go back.
If I did, I'd have to hunt you guys down again.

Hige:
Sounds nice... I wouldn't mind being hunted down by a girl.
I'm usually the one who does all the chasing.
But somehow they always manage to get away.
When I get in the mood, I always have to take a leak.
Kinda like right now.

Blue:
Well, go somewhere and do it. That's disgusting.

Hige:
I'll hold it! It looks like you're ready to run.

Blue:
You're nice. Gross but nice.

Hige:
Yeah, I get that all the time.

Blue:
Hey, why don't you come with me?

Hige:
Where to?

Blue:
It doesn't matter where, does it?

Hige:
Sounds tempting...
What the hell are you doing here?

Toboe:
I just happened to be passing by.
Was that a...
Hige!

Hige:
Damn...
Hey, what're you doing? We've gotta go!

Thug #1:
Well, looky here. We found us some wolves.
Jaguara's people will pay us a small fortune for you!

Tsume:
Jaguara?

Hige:
They're gone...

Toboe:
Huh?
Looks like someone was shot!

Kiba:
Are you okay?

Tsume:
Don't worry, the bullet only grazed my arm.

Elmira:
What's the matter?
Have you boys been hurt? Are you alright?

Honey:
Elmira! You come over here now!

Kiba:
We have no intention of hurting either one of you.

Elmira:
Well, for heaven's sakes, dear. Put the gun down. They're only children.

Honey:
Don't be stupid! They're strays and they're dangerous!

Elmira:
What are you talking about? Have you lost your senses?

Honey:
Elmira, I may be an old man, but I am not going senile. Take a close look at those two!

Hige:
Oh, crap!

Kiba:
We are not going to do anything to you, so just leave us alone.
I don't want to fight, if there's no reason to. I don't want to kill.

Thug #1:
Did you see the wolves?
Search over there!

Tsume:
Those people want to capture us and sell us to the highest bidder.
It's up to you whether we can avoid bloodshed.

Honey:
Die, you damn wolves! Take this! And this!

Thug #1:
Did you kill them?

Elmira:
Stop it, that's enough!

Honey:
They cast a spell on me! I was only...!

Elmira:
Calm down. It's safe now.

Honey:
Let go! Let go of me!

Thug #1:
Damn it! Those things are worthless if they're dead!

Hubb:
Nobody should ever get married...

Quent:
You got that right. A man's better off without a wife weighing him down.

Hubb:
What the hell is wrong with being single? You can live your life just fine!

Quent:
Wives do nothing but drive a man crazy... There's just no figuring 'em out.

Hubb:
You think you know her, but the minute the 'I do's are done, she becomes a different person!

Quent:
You are so right.

Hubb:
And it's only after the divorce she loosens up...

Quent:
No sane man should ever have a family...

Hubb:
Damn straight... You're better off not having anything that's precious to you.
Oh, Cher. Where are you?

Quent:
Hey, Detective Dandy.
Wanna go up the road and check out the next town?

Hubb:
The what?

Quent:
If she was still in the area, you should've bumped into her by now.
And since you haven't, my guess is she's either gone back home or she's moved on to the next city.

Hubb:
Cher would never go back. Not with the way things are.

Quent:
Well, then. That settles it.

Elmira:
Please forgive my husband.
I can't believe he thought you were wolves, of all things.
He's starting to get more and more confused lately.
That's why we came out here on this little jaunt.
"Let's spend the time we have left on the road", he said.
So now, this trailer is our home, as well as our coffin.
But we've seen such horrible things.
That castle of the Darcias to the west of here, which must have been beautiful once, is nothing but a giant grave.

Kiba:
The castle of the Darcias?

Elmira:
It's as if everything in this world has given up its desire to live.

Kiba:
No, it hasn't.
The old man isn't confused at all. He's right. We are wolves.

Hige:
You ready to go?

Toboe:
Mm!

Blue:
Goodbye, mister. Take care.

Honey:
Where are you going to go?

Kiba:
To the castle in the west.

-Ending-

Quent:
There are times in your life when you shouldn't drink.
At work, and behind the wheel.
Don't drink when you drive, and don't drive when you drink.
If you ask me, I say why buy the car, when you can spend the money on more booze?
