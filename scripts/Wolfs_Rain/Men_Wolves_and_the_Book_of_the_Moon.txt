  (Hubb's Recap Episode)

Quent:
Blue! Don't go too far!

Bartender:
Wolves?
I haven't heard about them since my grandpa was alive.
He always used to tell me, when the world finally comes to an end, Paradise would appear on the Earth.
But the trouble is that only wolves would know where to find it.
Who knows?
Maybe the world is coming to an end right now...

Quent:
Wolves are only servants of death!
Don't you believe all that pagan garbage!

Bartender:
Relax, old man.
Wolves have been extinct for 200 years.
It's just a kid's fairy tale.

Quent:
The thing about fairy tales is there's always some truth in 'em.

-Opening-

Hubb:
My name is Hubb Lebowski.
I'm a detective on the Freeze City police force.
Or at least I used to be.
My life was pretty straightforward, but after meeting this man, all of that changed.

Quent Yaiden.
So tell me, what brings the sheriff of Kyrios to our humble city?
That's some heavy artillery you've got there.
But I doubt you came all this way for the hunting.

Quent:
What did you do with it?
Where's the animal I put down?

Hubb:
Dead, apparently.
The carcass will be disposed of here.

Quent:
That's impossible!
There's not a chance in Hell that thing is dead!
Don't you get it, it's a wolf!

Hubb:
You think it's a wolf?

Quent:
It may look like a dog, but it's not.
It's a wolf!
These wolves exist and we have to destroy them all!

Hubb:
So, do you think it's really a wolf?

Cher:
I don't know.
I've never seen a real one before.
But if it is a wolf, it may be what's causing the sudden reaction in Cheza.

Hubb:
Oh please.
Not Cheza again.

Cher:
What's that mean?

Hubb:
It's because of her you and I broke up.

Cheza. The crowning achievement of an ancient alchemy.
My wife...uh, my ex-wife was among those in charge of a top-secret research project for one of the Nobles.
The Flower Maiden and the wolves...
Two beings that existed only in legend...
Was that animal really a wolf?

It's gone...
You think someone stole it?

Cher:
Could be.
Or maybe it escaped on its own.

Quent:
You're obsessed with the wolves, huh?
You're dying to know everything now, isn't that right, Detective?

Hubb:
That dog you shot ran away.

Quent:
What a surprise.

Hubb:
And you think it put some kind of spell on us to escape?

Quent:
You got it.
There are a lot more of them, you know.
People you pass every day on the street or the market, the poor slob sitting next to you in the bar...
Any one of 'em could be a wolf.
"I tell you now the words of Red Moon.
From the Great Spirit was born a wolf, and man became its messenger".
In other words, the human race was created from wolves.
So says the author of the Book of the Moon.

Hubb:
"Book of the Moon"?

Quent:
I guess I might as well say it.
Instead of looking for wolves, you oughta start suspecting humans.

Cher:
Everything's fine.
The lab's power supply is independent from the main grid.

Darcia:
Yes, I know.
Cheza is not vital to you. Is that correct?

Cher:
Who are you?

Darcia:
Everyone is resting now.
You look exhausted as well.
So tired. You should rest a while.

Hubb:
Cher disappeared, leaving me the key to her apartment.
In the midst of all that neatness and order, I found something.
The Book of the Moon.
A arcane volume written by Darcia the First, an alchemist of unparalleled genius who had vanished over two hundred years ago.
Why was it here? What was Cher doing with a book that was now banned?

Cher:
It's a faint signal, but it's moving.
Commander, she must be somewhere inside that vessel.

Commander:
Can you be certain?

Cher:
I'm sure these readings confirm it.
Cheza's awake, and she's reacting to something.

Darcia:
Don't do it!

Cher:
Oh no!

Commander:
I can't believe that ten of my men were injured, while we let them escape.
But they won't be able to get away from us, not from this aerial city.

Cher:
Commander, who do you think those boys really are?

Commander:
I would imagine they're some of Lord Darcia's people.

Cher:
To be honest, I'm not so sure...
That expression that the Flower Maiden had on her face when she was running with those boys...
Cheza was smiling.
She was smiling, as if she were truly happy.

Have you heard of how wolves might still be alive even today?

Commander:
No, I haven't.

Cher:
There's a very real possibility that these boys we saw aren't ordinary humans.
They could be wolves who've learned to survive by deceiving us.

Quent:
A glass of whatever will warm me up.

Bartender:
Yes, sir.

Cher:
I'd like a chilled sherry, please.

Bartender:
Yes, ma'am.

Quent/Cher:
Hit me again.

Hubb:
I don't know how long it's been since I started searching for Cher.
The lab where she worked was shut down, and all the researchers had gone into hiding.
I even took a stab at getting information concerning the Nobles.
At that point, I would have risked almost anything.
And then finally, I got a lead.

Serena:
It's Cheza...she was stolen by someone over a month ago.

Hubb:
What about Cher?

Serena:
Doctor Degr√© went with the retrieval team to help find the Flower Maiden.

Detective:
Let's just leave it at that, shall we, Detective Lebowski?
The House of Lords has issued a warrant for your immediate arrest.
Please come with me.

An invasion? But...
Lord Orkham is what?!

Troop member:
Hubb! Are you alright?

Hubb:
Don't worry. It's not your fault.

Troop member:
But still, how did this happen?

Hubb:
I guess I was deceived.

Troop member:
Do you mean by wolves?
What the hell is going on?

Hubb:
Sorry, pal.

Darcia:
The Book of the Moon...
For my clan, that was where all of this first started.
Within its pages lies my grandfather's research. An accumulation of the finest alchemy of his day.
And every last bit of it was intended to be a means of reaching Paradise.
My grandfather disappeared into Paradise.

Cher:
But what exactly is Paradise?

Darcia:
It is a world where wolves reign supreme.
Paradise will save me. It will lift the horrid curse that is upon me, and that of the woman I love.
My beloved Hamona was ravaged by what is called Paradise Sickness.
Her soul was stolen by Paradise, yet she still lives.
Her skin has lost the warmth that yours still possesses.

Neige:
My Lord Darcia, it appears Lord Orkham's keep has fallen.

Darcia:
As I thought, Jaguara has made her move?
The time is ripe.

Hubb:
Lord Darcia...aerial city, huh?

Wolves... The Flower Maiden...
And the blood-red moon.
One by one, everything that was written in the Book of the Moon is coming true.
Is this really the end of the world?

Neige:
Lord Darcia, you're here...
Lady Jaguara's reach extended even here...

Darcia:
Jaguara...

Neige:
Please forgive me. I tried but there was nothing I could do to protect her.

Bar manager:
Well, if you've come all this way to find her, she must have done something pretty awful, huh?

Hubb:
Yeah, she's a master criminal with the face of an angel.

Bartender:
Hey, wait... That's the woman.
You know, the one who drank like a fish.

Hubb:
You mean, you saw her?

Bartender:
She was throwing 'em back with that old guy over there.

Hubb:
You again.
So I take it your search for the wolves is going well?
And where's your dog? Was she too headstrong for you?

Quent:
I guess she was. She ran off on me.
I've always had the suspicion...
Ever since my boy found Blue and brought her home, even though she was just a pup, I figured she had some wolf blood in her.
That's the reason she was able to track down the wolves so well.
Wanna go up the road and check out the next town?

Hubb:
The what?

Quent:
If she was still in the area, you should've bumped into her by now.
And since you haven't, my guess is she's either gone back home or she's moved on to the next city.

Hubb:
Cher would never go back. Not with the way things are.

Quent:
Well, then. That settles it.

Cher:
Hubb!

Hubb:
Cher!

Cher:
Hubb, what are you... How did you...?

Hubb:
Is this a dream?
I can't tell. I've had so many dreams about you.

Cher:
I met him. I met Darcia.
I'm sorry, Hubb.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you came all this way to find me.
But I have to go.

Hubb:
But why, Cher?

Cher:
Please try and understand. I have to find out Cheza's true purpose.
I'm being drawn to something, Hubb, and I need to know what it is.

Hubb:
Alright, then I'll go with you.
Then why in the hell did you leave this thing for me to read?
I'm going with you.

What is it?
Hey!

Darcia:
It's because of you. You and your kind stole everything from me.
And in return, you gave me a curse. And grief. And suffering.
And my eye transformed into one such as yours.
The price I paid for being cursed by Paradise.
And now...the only thing that surrounds me is despair.

Kiba:
Don't! What is it? What do you want?

Darcia:
Have you found it? Have you found Paradise?

Kiba:
We will. No matter what!

Darcia:
And what do you expect to find there?

Kiba:
A future.

Darcia:
A future?

Kiba:
Not hope. Or despair. Just a future.
Nothing more.

Darcia:
I no longer have any need...for a future.

Quent:
It's over, wolf!

Blue:
No, don't!

Quent:
B-Blue...

Neige:
My Lord Darcia!

Kiba:
Cheza!

Tsume:
Kiba!

Kiba:
Cheza!

Hige:
Blue, no!

Quent:
How could you?
Why, Blue?
Blue!

Cher:
Jaguara!

Blue:
That way!

Hubb:
Did that wolf just say something?!

Darcia:
I can see you whenever I like.

Hamona:
I know we will meet again.

Darcia:
Yes, someday soon.

Hamona:
I love you, Darcia...

Neige:
My Lord Darcia...

Kiba:
They say there's no such place as Paradise.
Even if you searched to the ends of the Earth, there's nothing there.
No matter how far you walk, it's always the same road.
It just goes on and on.
But in spite of that, why am I so driven to find it?
A voice calls to me, it says: "Search for Paradise".

-Ending-

Kiba:
I'm afraid you're out of luck.
You will not find what you seek, and those you await will not come.
But there is a hint of new love in the air.
Now's when your honesty will be put to the test.
Your lucky colour is white.
