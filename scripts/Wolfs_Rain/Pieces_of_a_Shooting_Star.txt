  Passenger #1:
It's over... It's all over...
This is it...It's over...
This is the end.
The end of everything...

Passenger #2:
Quit your mumbling, would you?
Just shut the hell up!
I can fix this for some bucks...
Oh yeah! I know I can make good money off this little baby!
Jaguara's troops carry around some pretty nice crap!

Passenger #1:
It'll all vanish...
Soon, everything's just gonna disappear...
This is it. The end of the world...

Passenger #2:
Will you shut up?
Why do you have to keep babbling on and on about what all of us already knows?

Passenger #1:
It doesn't matter if we try to run... There's nowhere to go.

Passenger #2:
I know somewhere you can go!

Quent:
That's enough!

Passenger #2:
It ain't gonna end. Jaguara ain't gonna end.
Even if this whole stinking world does disappear, she ain't going anywhere.
Jaguara is the only hope that any of us have left!
She'll save us, see? Her keep...
Her keep is an island of dreams.

Passenger #1:
Of dreams, huh?
An island of dreams?

Passenger #2:
I knew you had a big mouth to spout all of that crap!
You'd better not make one more sound!

Passenger #1:
I-It's all over...Over...

Passenger #2:
I told the guy to shut up.
I warned him not to make another sound.
But he wouldn't listen.
I told him and told him to shut up...
Just shut up...

Quent:
Stop it! Calm down!

Quent:
Everything's going crazy...
Everything.

-Opening-

Cher:
Tell me...
How did you and that old man get split up from one another?
Are you that strong because you're a wolf?

Blue:
I guess.
The one thing Pops hates more than anything in this world is what I am.

Cher:
But you've been at his side this whole time, haven't you?
I'm sorry, this is strange for me.
I've never had a conversation with a dog before...

Blue:
Just think. If I'd been able to do this sooner, I could've talked to Pops about all kinds of things.

Cher:
Are you kidding? He'd pass out from shock.

Blue:
Maybe.

Cher:
Shouldn't you be looking for him?

Blue:
It's okay. For now, I'll save Cheza.
That's what you're after too, isn't it?
Or are you trying to rescue Mr. Sensitive?

Cher:
A bit of both, I guess.
It's just... I really don't know.
There's so much we still can't seem to get right.
Who knows what'll happen in the end.

Toboe:
Is this an ocean?

Kiba:
It's an ice floe.

Toboe:
What's an ice floe?

Tsume:
A frozen sea.

Toboe:
Are we gonna walk across this?

Kiba:
We have to. It's on the other side.

Toboe:
That's cold!

Hige:
Would you be careful, runt? You know we're on top of water here.

Toboe:
I know that! C'mon, let's go!
What are you waiting for? Hurry up!
This cold feels great!

Hige:
What the hell's he so happy for? It's freezing.

Tsume:
He's such a pup...

Hubb:
Cheza?
Cheza!
Ch-Cheza...

Hige:
Hey!
What the hell are you waiting for?
Are you scared?

Toboe:
I was just getting ready to, alright?

Hige:
Getting ready to do what?

Toboe:
Right...
Ow...
Are these all bird bones or what?

Hige:
Not so much as a scrap of meat left on 'em.

Kiba:
Don't worry. We should find something in the town up ahead.

Tsume:
Yeah, you're right.
The sooner we put this frozen dump behind us, the sooner we can eat.
Hey, Toboe? You still in one piece?

Toboe:
O-Of course I am!
Let's get moving!

Hige:
C'mon, birds! Let's see some flying up there!

Shake a leg, runt! You're falling behind!

Toboe: 
I know, I know!

Old lady:
You smell nice.

Hubb:
Hello? Is there someone there, or am I hearing things?

Old lady:
How did you end up here, stranger?

Hubb:
Huh? Well, if I started from the beginning, it'd take too long to tell.

Old lady:
Then make it short.

Hubb:
Oh, well, I was brought here...
Excuse me.
I came from Darcia's keep.

Old lady:
Darcia?

Hubb:
What on earth are you doing in a place like this?

Old lady:
I guess you could call it treason.

Hubb:
What kind of treason? You mean against the Nobles?

Old lady:
Jaguara has detested my kind for generations.

Hubb:
What do you mean "your kind"?

Old lady:
To her, we've always been a terrible nuisance.

Hubb:
You can't be the only one here. Where are the other captives?

Old lady:
They've all been taken away. To Jaguara's great hall.

Hubb:
Great hall?

Old lady:
And there...they are all put to death.
You don't have to worry about that.
They'll just leave you here to rot.
While my time is almost up.

Hubb:
But why? Why would she do this?

Old lady:
Tell me. Why do you have such a lovely scent?

Hubb:
My scent?
You must be smelling Cheza.

Old lady:
Cheza?

Hubb:
A Lunar Flower girl... I-I mean, uh...

Old lady:
Then the Flower Maiden is here?
The time has finally come.

Hige:
Man, it's like a junkyard for bones...

Tsume:
I've got a bad feeling about this.

Kiba:
That may be, but we still have to pass through it.

Hige:
I kinda figured you'd say that.
Toboe, what happened to your arm?

Toboe:
Oh, I must have bumped into something. It's just a scratch.

Kiba:
Why don't we rest for a while?

Toboe:
Don't baby me, I said I'm fine.
C'mon, daylight's wasting!

Hige:
If he's got that much energy, he must be okay.

Kiba:
But there's no telling what the smell of fresh blood will attract.

Tsume:
Look on the bright side. If something does decide to show up, we can always eat it.

Hige:
All the better if that something has a lot of red meat on it.

Hey, runt! You okay over there?

Toboe:
Thanks for asking, I'm just fine.

Hige:
What the hell?
Toboe, no!
Get out of the water!

Tsume:
Bastard!

Hige:
Kiba!

Kiba:
Toboe, don't do it!
Are you alright?

Tsume:
Yeah. Where's Toboe?

That damn kid went crazy...

Hige:
This sucks... This really sucks...
Why is he taking so long to come back up?
Come on, Toboe...
Toboe!
Toboe!
Are you okay?

Tsume:
I can't believe it.

Hige:
What got into you?

Toboe:
Something happened...And then, I just...
I just...
I don't know. It was like something deep inside of me just snapped all of a sudden.

Walrus:
You must be joking...
Not once have I ever been defeated on this island.
I have been here protecting it since long, long ago.
Even when I was the only one left.
In this world, it's either kill or be killed.
But understand this...
I will not die a victim...
I am going...to save you.

Kiba:
Hige.
He's your kill, so you eat first.

Jaguara:
I tell you now the words of Red Moon.
From the Great Spirit was born the wolf, and man became its messenger.
The beast lives his life in silence, abiding where the blessings of the blood of the gods is bestowed upon him.
The white flower, after winning the favour of the lord of the night, will share her scent.
Preordained and eternal in countenance, her form is of a lily-white, supple maiden.
She distills and condenses all of time until it becomes a precious, frozen mass.
Only then will appear the wretched beast.

-Ending-
Blue:
It's a girls-only road trip.
Which of course invites every idiot in a pair of pants to make a pass at you.
Aren't there any decent guys around here?
Maybe I'll make the first move for a change. See what happens when the tables are turned.
