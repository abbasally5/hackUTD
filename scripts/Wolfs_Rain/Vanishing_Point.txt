  Noble:
Terror is fierce, overwhelming fear.
Ye accursed of the earth, you will be rent asunder by the poisonous fangs of the night, and dawn will not come for you.
Ye poor soul ravaged by heat, the vast spirit of the light will never again favour you with the magnificence and warmth of her seductive smile.
Hear me, ye accursed of the earth.
Your world will never rouse from its perpetual slumber, and through devastation be lured into a darkness that transcends the night.

Lord Orkham:
A prophecy of destruction?

Noble:
This night portends a full moon.

Lord Orkham:
Call out the royal guard! At once!

Serena:
Sorry to keep you waiting!
Come on, let's go.
Just keep walking. Pretend we're old friends.

Hubb:
Who are you?

Serena:
I used to work in the same lab as the Doctor Degré.

Hubb:
Where have you been all this time?
I've been trying to track you people down for weeks, but it's as if you all vanished, and every trace of the lab's existence has been erased.

Serena:
It was shut down by agents of the intelligence bureau who report directly to the House of Lords.

Hubb:
But why?

Serena:
It's Cheza...she was stolen by someone over a month ago.

Hubb:
What about Cher?

Serena:
Doctor Degré went with the retrieval team to help find the Flower Maiden.
Sorry.
I don't have any idea where they went...but I'm sure the doctor's alright.

Hubb:
Why are you...

Serena:
It's because she used to talk about you all the time.
I hope you find her.

Hubb:
Thanks for that.

Detective:
Let's leave it at that lovely sentiment, shall we, Detective Lebowski?
I suppose I should call you by your new title.
Suspect Lebowski...
The House of Lords has issued a warrant for your immediate arrest.
Please come with me.

Lord Orkham:
You! You're Jaguara's...

-Opening-

Hige:
Man, what a seedy-looking town...

Tsume:
It's my kind of place.

Kiba:
I bet it is.

Tsume:
Smell the danger in the air. My blood's on fire.

Toboe:
Me too! Me too!

Hige:
Pretty big talk for someone who's scared all the time!
But that's not the only reason for you're fired up, is it, runt?
For one thing, tonight's...

Kiba:
Yeah. It's a full moon.

Toboe:
I know it's like that for us 'cause we get our strength from the full moon, but what about Cheza? She looks like she's glowing too.

Kiba:
Yeah.
"Once a year on the night of a full moon, flowers will hear the moon's call and return to Paradise".
That's a legend I heard once.

Tsume:
So you mean tonight, she'll...

Kiba:
I'm not sure if it'll be tonight. We'll just have to wait and see.

Toboe:
What? What's gonna happen to her?

Hige:
You're not saying that Cheza's gonna bloom or something, are you?

Cheza:
This one is excited too!

Detective:
Tell me. What exactly were you thinking, carrying around a banned book like this?
You say you're looking for a woman who divorced you.
But Lebowski, there's no corroborative evidence that such a woman ever existed in this city.
In fact, there are no records anywhere that prove you were ever married.
Lebowski... Thanks to the protection of Lord Orkham, we've all been able to eke out a substantial living for ourselves.
What the hell happened to you?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't it your policy to do everything you could to stay out of trouble?

Hubb:
Yes, it was. But something's changed.
Either me...or else the world.

Detective:
What?

Hubb:
You spend your whole life licking the Nobles' boots, and what does it get you?
Once you become a liability, you're abandoned, just like I've been.
"Lord" or no, Orkham is nothing but a cowardly old man.
Tell me, did being beaten at his own game by that fallen Noble really upset him that –?

Detective:
If you mean Darcia, we already shot him down!

Hubb:
Darcia?
But you haven't found them yet, have you?
Darcia... Or Cheza.

Detective:
Darcia's aerial city might be protecting him! Along with his accomplices.
But it's only a matter of time before we find them!

Hubb:
Thanks for clearing that up...
Can I ask you one more thing?

Detective:
What? What is it?

Hubb:
This Darcia... Which Darcia do you mean?

Detective:
You know which!
The Darcia in here, in this book!

Hubb:
Oh...

Detective:
Yes?
Yeah.
What? Combat units?
What do you mean?
An invasion?
Lord Orkham is what?!

Troop member:
Hubb! Are you alright?

Hubb:
Don't worry. It's not your fault.

Troop member:
But still, how did this happen?

Hubb:
I guess I was deceived.

Troop member:
Do you mean by wolves?
What the hell is going on?

Hubb:
Sorry, pal.

Man #1:
What's going on?

Man #2:
Lord Orkham's been shot!

Hubb:
Hey, are you alright?

Troop member:
What happened?

Hubb:
I don't know. He suddenly collapsed.
Sorry, but could you take care of it?

Commander:
What's happened?
I want a status report right now!

Soldier #1:
Sir, Lord Orkham, he's... He's been assassinated.
Lady Jaguara's combat units have taken control of the keep.
Reports say that our remaining forces are still engaging them in the surrounding city.
Your orders, sir?

Commander:
Direct all squads to withdraw!
We've got more important things to do right now than look for some flower girl!
We will attack Jaguara.

Soldier #2:
But sir, what about our mission?

Commander:
With Lord Orkham gone, our city could suffer the same ruinous fate as this one! Do you really want that to happen?

Soldiers:
No, sir!

Cher:
It's magnificent...
If I had use of this device, I would be able to tap into and communicate directly with her mind...
Just as it was written in the Book of the Moon...

Darcia:
It would appear that I have granted you too much freedom.
The time for dalliance is over.
You have soothed the loneliness of my isolation long enough.
I must go now and retrieve the Flower Maiden.

Cher:
Tell me, do you know where she is?

Darcia:
I can sense Cheza's presence within my very soul.
Tonight, we will see a full moon.

Tsume:
So this is it.

Hige:
Yeah, right about now, I feel like I could do almost anything.

Toboe:
I mean, we've all seen a full moon before. Because Cheza's with us, it seems different, doesn't it?

Tsume:
Oh man, I just wanna howl my head off!

Kiba:
Something's about to happen.

Darcia:
The Book of the Moon...
For my clan, that was where all of this first started.
Within its pages lies my grandfather's research. An accumulation of the finest alchemy of his day.
And every last bit of it was intended to be a means of reaching Paradise.
My grandfather disappeared into Paradise.

Cher:
But what exactly is Paradise?

Darcia:
It is a world where wolves reign supreme.
Paradise will save me. It will lift the horrid curse that is upon me, and that of the woman I love.
My beloved Hamona was ravaged by what is called Paradise Sickness.
Her soul was stolen by Paradise, yet she still lives.
Her skin has lost the warmth that yours still possesses.

Cher:
Are you sure you should be telling me all of your secrets?

Darcia:
You may wait for me here.
Until I return with Cheza.

Neige:
My Lord Darcia, it appears Lord Orkham's keep has fallen.

Darcia:
As I thought, Jaguara has made her move?

Neige:
So it would seem.

Darcia:
The time is ripe.

Hige:
It's the path to Paradise!

Tsume:
Is that really what it is?

Toboe:
Amazing! It's amazing!

Darcia:
The wolves... It's been a long time.

Tsume:
That stench... He's a Noble?

Kiba:
What are you doing here?

Darcia:
Was your little dream pleasant? The one where you were going to Paradise.

Kiba:
What?

Darcia:
The time has not yet come for that.
Return to me, Cheza.

Kiba:
Get out of our way!

Darcia:
It is futile.

Hige:
Toboe!

Darcia:
Ah, the blood of the wolves... How magnificent.

Cheza:
Kiba...
That is enough.

Kiba:
Don't go!
D-Don't!

Cheza:
It is alright.

Kiba:
Don't go, Cheza...
We're wolves. We're not afraid to die.

Cheza:
This one knows that. But this one has decided.
It is alright.
Kiba... This one will surely protect you.

Kiba:
Cheza...
Cheza...

Hubb:
Lord Darcia...aerial city, huh?

-Ending-

Hubb:
Hi. Lebowski here.
Personal circumstances have forced me to resign from my job.
Spring has sprung!
So I'm setting out on a journey, where I'm sure only pleasant encounters await me.
