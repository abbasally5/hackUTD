  Neige:
Lord Darcia.
A wolf has appeared in the domed city to the north.
They have not been seen since passing into legend two-hundred years ago.

Darcia:
Yes.
You were but a child then.
The Flower Maiden. Has she awoken?

Neige:
So it would seem.

Darcia:
Hamona...
Very soon, you will awaken as well, my love.

-Opening-

Cher:
Anything on the kirlian?

Female lab member:
Spectral radiation unchanged.

Cher:
Any response to the tests?

Female lab member:
None, just as we suspected.

Cher:
So, she's been awake this whole time...

Female lab member:
Yes.
Although she appears to be rather calm now, the data indicates that she's still in a fairly excited state.

Male lab member:
Doctor Degre?
You've got a call.

Cher:
Who is it?

Male lab member:
It's your husband.
I mean, your ex-husband.
Uh, Detective Lebowski is on line one.

Cher:
Yes, what is it?

Hubb:
C'mon, Cher, does it really matter what title they call me by?

Cher:
Just tell me what you want.

Hubb:
There's something I need you to see.

Cher:
So what did you catch this time, an elephant?

Cher:
Sorry, humans aren't really my specialty.

Hubb:
He was one of the kids involved in the warehouse theft.
He fell from the roof while trying to escape.

Cher:
Are these tooth marks from a dog?

Hubb:
The wounds are still pretty fresh. What do you think?

Cher:
Are you trying to tell me the dog that escaped did this?

Hubb:
I dunno. I should have taken some moulds of its teeth when I had the chance.

Cher:
I wonder why it hasn't been found yet.
With a dog that big running wild around the city, you'd think someone would have reported it..

Hubb:
Maybe they are trying to deceive us.

Cher:
Huh?

Hubb:
No, forget it. It's impossible.

Cher:
Oh, Hubb.

Hubb:
Hm?

Cher:
Am I down here just because you wanted to see me?

Hubb:
Maybe just a little.

Cher:
You never change, do you?

Leara:
Here. Try some of these, they taste better.
C'mon, you can have them.
You're hungry, aren't you?
Don't be afraid. They're not poisoned or anything.
See, it's fine.
Where'd you come from, little fella?
If you wander around here too long, the dog catchers will get you for sure.
You sure are warm, aren't you, boy?

Leara's father:
Leara!

Leara:
'Bye, now.
No, stay. Sorry, boy, but even if you followed me home, I couldn't keep you.
Well, that's funny. It's almost like you can understand me.
I'm sorry.

Man:
What the hell?!

Troop member:
Hold it!
Hold still, damn it!

Man:
I didn't do anything!

Woman #1:
Did you hear? Someone saw a wolf in town. Can you believe it?

Woman #2:
What is the world coming to?
You don't suppose it was just a big dog, do you?

Woman #1:
From what I heard, no one's ever seen a dog that big before.
Oh, these are troubled times.

Hige:
See, what did I tell you? Nobody notices us.

Kiba:
This is awful.

Hige:
It's the best you can get around here.
If I see a deer loping by, I'll be sure to catch it for you.
The Nobles are at it again. Seems like they pick up one idiot after another.

Kiba:
Where do the troops take them once they're caught?

Hige:
Well, the same place they took you, I guess.

Kiba:
That's perfect.

Hige:
Huh?

Kiba:
I'll blend in and sneak inside.

Hige:
What?! But we had to fool them just to get out of there!
That hot dog fried your brain.

Kiba:
I'm going back in.

Hige:
Now, wait a second! What the hell happened to Paradise?

Kiba:
Look. The scent is coming from somewhere inside that building.
And as far as we can tell, the only way in is to get captured.
You know what's there, don't you? What they're hiding behind those walls.
The beacon that will lead us to Paradise.

Hige:
Well, forget it. You'll never get close to Cheza.

Kiba:
Cheza?

Hige:
The Flower Maiden that was created from Lunar Flowers.
That's what they say, anyway.
Listen, it's useless. They got that place locked down.
Even I couldn't get as far as the lab.

Kiba:
So then why did you try to sneak in there?

Hige:
For a little excitement, I guess.

Kiba:
Hige, don't you believe in Paradise, too?

Hige:
I'm not going. No way.

Kiba:
Alright. See you around.

Hige:
Hey, Kiba!
Try to give a guy advice, and what does it get you?
See if I care.

Chen:
They say the Nobles have put a bounty on every gang in the city.

Tsume:
Is that so?

Sedo:
Yeah, they've already started to round people up.
And our stuff's been kinda high-profile lately.
We figure we're next.
Maybe it's time we should move on.
There's a freight train pulling outta town at midnight.
We can sneak on...

Tsume:
Our next raid is gonna be tonight.
Make the usual preparations.

Chen:
Why? So you can just sit back and watch?
Gehl's dead because of you. You let him die.
Sorry, pal, but I ain't working with you anymore.
I wouldn't wanna slow you down now, would I?

Tsume:
Suit yourself.
We'll meet up at midnight. Get the word out.

Cher:
We analysed the dog hairs from inside the cage, and they don't match the ones that were found on the corpse.
There's also a third set of hairs yet unidentified.

Hubb:
A third set?

Cher:
As far as we can tell, there were two types of hair around the cage.

Hubb:
What the hell is going on? There isn't anywhere for them to hide.

Cher:
Are you okay? You're not acting like yourself.
No offence. But I thought you didn't like dogs.
And to be honest, you're starting to sound a little obsessed.

Hubb:
I'm not obsessed, Cher. Don't worry.
I'm probably just looking for another excuse to see you.
It may be time to track down that guy.

Quent:
Listen up, Blue. I know you can understand me.
You can't let them get away.
Wolves are evil. They'll kill you if they get the chance.
Right now, they're laying low somewhere, breathing their foul, demon's breath.

Toboe:
Uh, uh...
Thanks a lot. For before.

Leara:
Huh?

Toboe:
For the sausages.
Uh, remember back in the alley? Well, that was my dog you gave them to.

Leara:
That beautiful dog belongs to you?

Toboe:
"Beautiful"?
Uh, yeah! Yeah, he's mine!

Leara:
But how did you know about it?

Toboe:
Um, I...I heard it from the lady at the store.

Leara:
What's the name, anyway?

Toboe:
Uh, name?
The name is Toboe.

Leara:
"Toboe"? What a weird name.

Toboe:
You think so? Yeah, I guess it is...

Leara:
My name is Leara. What's yours?

Toboe:
I just said, it's Toboe.

Leara:
I thought that was your dog's name.

Toboe:
Uh.
Well, we're a lot alike, so I decided to name him after myself.

Leara:
You're pretty weird, alright.

Toboe:
You're another one... Just like me...

Tsume:
Move it, kid.

Quent:
You find something?
A boy?
No, you're not a boy.

Tsume:
Jump!
Hurry up!

Toboe:
I was getting ready to!

Quent:
That was them. I finally found 'em.

Toboe:
Who the heck was that?
And what's up with his dog...

Tsume:
I have no idea.

Toboe:
Hey, you're Tsume, right?
This is a first for me. I've never met a wolf. I mean, other than myself.
I heard rumours about you from the crows though.
They said you make friends with humans and run wild with them.

Tsume:
You heard wrong. I don't have friends.

Toboe:
I'm Toboe. Thanks for the help back there.
You know what? I've been living with humans my whole life too –

Tsume:
Just get lost, will you?
I'm getting pissed off, and that only happens when I'm around idiots.

Toboe:
But...can't I come with you?

Tsume:
No, you can't.

Hige:
Yo.

Kiba:
Hige? What in the world are you doing in here?

Hige:
C'mon, we're friends now, aren't we?

Kiba:
Coming from you, that sounds kinda fishy.

Toboe:
Leara!
Here, it's your bird.
Hey.
Wake up.
Leara?

Leara:
He's dead...
My bird's dead.

Toboe:
But, I...
I didn't mean to kill him, I swear.
I knew it was yours, and I just wanted to...
I didn't think it would die.

I never meant to kill anything.
Granny, she... I was all alone at the entrance to the dome, and she was so nice to me.
She said I was so little my eyes had barely opened.
She gave these to me, and we lived together ever since.

Tsume:
You mean she kept you as a pet.
That human tamed you. You were nothing more than an obedient dog.

Toboe:
I wasn't!
I...I only... I wanted to protect her. But she still...

Tsume:
She still threw you out?

Toboe:
She still died.
She died.
I let her die.

Quent:
Well, look who it is. Detective Dandy.

Hubb:
I need to ask you some questions.

Quent:
And there's something that you need to see.

Tsume:
Sedo...

Sedo:
No one is gonna come.

Tsume:
Then why are you here?

Sedo:
I'm leaving after this.
Tsume, you're just too different from the rest of us.

Kiba:
Do you feel that?

Hige:
Feel what?

Kiba:
This isn't right. Something's gonna happen.

Hige:
I don't smell anything, except for the mildew.

Kiba:
It's getting closer.

Hige:
So you wanna break out of here?

Kiba:
Yeah.

Male lab member:
Doctor? Doctor Degré?

Cher:
Oh, is it that late already?
Did something happen?

Male lab member:
No, ma'am. There's been no change for a while now, so I thought you might want to call it a night.

Cher:
I'm too pretty to look like this.

Male lab member:
What the hell?

Cher:
Everything's fine.
The lab's power supply is independent from the main grid.

Darcia:
Yes, I know.
Cheza is not vital to you. Is that correct?

Cher:
Who are you?

Darcia:
Everyone is resting now.
You look exhausted as well.
So tired. You should rest a while.
It's been a long time, Cheza.
You can sense my presence, can't you? Though your eyes do not see me.
There is nothing to fear. You are awake now, at last.
We can finally set out on our journey.

Hige:
This way!

-Ending-

Quent:
There are times in a man's life when he's gotta take a journey.
Just like there's times when he's gotta take a drink.
There's nothing like warm vodka on a cold night...
