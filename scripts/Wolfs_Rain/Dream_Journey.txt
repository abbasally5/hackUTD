  (Toboe's Recap Episode)

-Opening-

Toboe:
I never imagined that I'd be able to come this far.
I guess I didn't think I'd ever set out on a journey.
But one day, I found myself all alone.
I didn't know what else to do, you know?

Leara:
Here. Try some of these, they taste better.
C'mon, you can have them.
You're hungry, aren't you?
They're not poisoned or anything.
See, it's fine.
Where'd you come from, little fella?
If you wander around here too long, the dog catchers will get you for sure.
You sure are warm, aren't you, boy?

Leara's father:
Leara!

Leara:
'Bye, now.
No, stay. Sorry, boy, but even if you followed me home, I couldn't keep you.
Well, that's funny. It's almost like you can understand me.
I'm sorry.

Toboe:
At that moment, all I could think about how nice she was. And how great it would be if I could live with her.

Uh, uh...
Thanks a lot. For before.

Leara:
Huh?

Toboe:
For the sausages.
Uh, remember back in the alley? Well, that was my dog you gave them to.

Leara:
That beautiful dog belongs to you?

Toboe:
"That beautiful..."?
Uh, yeah! Yeah, he's mine!

Leara:
But how did you know about it?

Toboe:
Um, I...I heard it from the lady at the store.

Leara:
What's the name, anyway?

Toboe:
Uh, name?
The name is Toboe.

Leara:
"Toboe"? What a weird name.

Toboe:
You think so? Yeah, I guess it is...

Leara:
My name is Leara. What's yours?

Toboe:
I just said, it's Toboe.

Leara:
I thought that was your dog's name.

Toboe:
Uh.
Well, we're a lot alike, so I decided to name him after myself.

Leara:
You're pretty weird, alright.

Toboe:
Leara!
Here, it's your bird.
Hey.
Wake up.
Leara?

Leara:
He's dead...
My bird's dead.

Toboe:
But, I...
I didn't mean to kill him, I swear.
I knew it was yours, and I just wanted to...
I didn't think it would die.

I never meant to kill anything.
Granny, she... I was all alone at the entrance to the dome, and she was so nice to me.
She said I was so little my eyes had barely opened.
She gave these to me, and we lived together ever since.

Tsume:
You mean she kept you as a pet.
That human tamed you. You were nothing more than an obedient dog.

Toboe:
I wasn't!
I...I only... I wanted to protect her. But she still...

Tsume:
She still threw you out?

Toboe:
She still died.
She died.
I let her die.

What does he know? I'm fine by myself.

Hige:
Uh oh. Must have taken a wrong turn.
Huh? Hey, it's one of our own!

Kiba:
Move it, will you?
That's the last time I trust your nose.

Hige:
Well, anyone's nose would go numb after a night in that stink hole.

Toboe:
Y-You guys... No way... You're...
Leara!
Don't be scared. I won't do anything.
I just wanted to see you again.
I'm so sorry about your bird.

Leara:
Daddy...Daddy...
Daddy!
Daddy!
Come quick! It's the wolf!
The wolf is here!
Daddy, over here!

Toboe:
Stay calm, stay calm, stay calm!
Why, Leara? Why did you scream?

Leara:
No, stay away!
There's-There's something wrong with you! You're not normal!
How can anyone ever trust you?

Toboe:
Leara, please! I only showed you so you could trust me.

Leara:
Don't come any closer!

Toboe:
Why? Didn't you come here to catch me?

Leara:
Ahhhh!

Hige:
Come on!

Toboe:
If we stay here, we'll have to spend the rest of our lives in hiding or worse.
We just can't live with the humans anymore and survive.

Hige:
Jump already!

Toboe:
I was getting ready to, alright?

Tsume:
Move it!

Toboe:
Our journey had begun.
The road is rough, and we've got nothing to eat.
It's much harder than when I was back in the city, but...
I don't know, it's kinda nice.
It feels like I've got my friends with me.

I had a dream that we'd reached Paradise.
Oh, it was so amazing.
There were all these red and blue flowers blooming as far as the eye could see.
And you know what? They were all Lunar Flowers!

Hige:
Have you ever seen a Lunar Flower before?

Toboe:
Well, no, not really...

Kiba:
The scent is really faint, but it's Lunar Flowers, alright...

Toboe:
Guys, this is it! Paradise is right up ahead, I know it!

Zali:
Where are you boys from?

Kiba:
A city to the north.

Zali:
Why are you here?

Tsume:
Just passing through. You don't expect us to do business here, in a dump like this?

Zali:
Well, then where are you going?

Hige:
Where are we going?

Toboe:
To Paradise!
Kiba, why are they laughing?

Kiba:
Because they obviously don't know anything about Paradise.

Zali:
We know all about it.

Moss:
It's nothing but a stupid legend.

Toboe:
Legend?

Moss:
That's right, kid. There's no such thing as Paradise.
We know because we've been there. We've all seen it.
And I'm telling you it wasn't Paradise. That place was more like Hell.

Gramps:
Look. That's the entrance over there.
There have been many young wolves that have set out through there.
But sadly enough, not one of them ever reached Paradise.

Hige:
That reeks. It smells like death warmed over.

Toboe:
I wonder what Paradise is really like.

Tsume:
So tell me. You still believe in it?

Kiba:
Believe in what?

Tsume:
Paradise. There's no such place.
They said they'd been there and apparently it was no Paradise.
We'd be stupid to keep going.

Toboe:
Don't say that. Besides, getting angry just makes you hungrier.

Tsume:
Maybe we can feed off Kiba's confidence for a while.

Kiba;
It's not confidence.
I'm not really sure what it is.
But it's always there, screaming inside of me.
I just have to know. I have to get there, that's why I've kept on running all this time.
I can't imagine living without believing in it.

Moss:
Why the long face? Giving up on going to Paradise?

Gang member #1:
It's not safe for a kid to wander around by himself, you know.

Gang member #2:
You should move with your pack.

Kiba:
What are you guys doing? Just standing around with no purpose?

Moss:
What'd you say?

Kiba:
I know why you weren't able to get to Paradise.
You're nothing but a pack of dogs.

Moss:
Why, you little punk!

Tsume:
What the hell is going on down there?!

Zali:
The train makes a quick stop.
It gives the humans and us a chance to eat.
It's the only way we can all make a living out here. We work for them, and they feed us.

Man:
There's a stray dog loose!

Kiba:
Clinging to this disgusting place and doing what you do, how can you call that a life?!

Zali:
What the hell do you know about it?

Kiba:
You're pathetic.

Zali:
You kids are still young.

Tsume:
What were you up to last night?
I know you didn't get all those wounds at the station.
Not like I care or anything...

Kiba:
I saw them once before, when I was little.
In the region where I was born, they had blossomed all over.

Tsume:
What are you talking about?

Kiba:
White flowers that only bloomed under a full moon...
They were Lunar Flowers.

Tsume:
You mean you ordered this?

Zali:
Ordered what?

Tsume:
Don't play dumb!

Zali:
What are you talking about?

Kiba:
Is it true what we heard? That you sold out our friend to those humans?

Toboe:
That guy said to kill him! I heard you tell those humans to kill him!

Zali:
Moss!
This is my pack!
Why in the hell did you sell out their friend?

Moss:
He's an outsider, that's why.

Gang Member #2:
Zali, isn't it you who's been selling out your friends?

Zali:
What?

Gang Member #2:
It's the truth, and you know it! You don't even do a dog's work!

Moss:
Well, nobody here sees you as the leader anymore!

Cole:
Stop it!
Just stop it!

Moss:
That's enough... Enough!

Cole:
Zali!

Zali:
If you plan to give up on Paradise and turn back, now might be the time.

Kiba:
I don't have anywhere to go back to. The only thing I can do is keep moving forward.

Tsume:
Even if Hell is what we're headed towards.
You people may not have been able to find Paradise, but there's absolutely no doubt in my mind that we will.

Toboe:
I don't know why it happened.
Maybe it was just from hoping.
But I always believed Tsume would say something like that.

Driver:
You damn dogs!

Zali:
This is as far as I plan to go. From here on out, you're all on your own.

Kiba:
You mean you're not coming with us? You're gonna keep living here?

Zali:
I don't know if the place we tried to find was real or not.
But I believe that there are some that can make it to Paradise, and there are some who can't.
And it's time for you to find out for yourselves if the real Paradise does exist, somewhere at the end of this road.

Tsume:
You know, you don't seem like much of a wolf.

Kiba:
Tsume!

Tsume:
A wolf protects its own. It's not natural for it to look after another pack.

Zali:
You're right. I guess I really have fallen.
Flowers are clever things.
Even if it looks like they vanish, they never really go away, you know?
Like a pack of wolves.
As long as there's a moon, flowers will never die.
And neither will us wolves.

Toboe:
A lot has happened since we left the city.
We're still as hungry as ever, but...
I don't know. Maybe we're all feeling the same way now.

Hige:
C'mon, runt!
Get a move on, or we'll leave you behind!

Toboe:
What's going on?

Hige:
Man, they're really going at it.

Kiba:
She's there...
I can feel it...

Hige:
Feel what?

Kiba:
I'm not sure. But it's so familiar...
Come on, don't you guys feel anything at all?

Tsume:
Kiba!

Toboe:
Wait for us!

Hige:
That scent...

Toboe:
What-What is that?

Hige:
It's her. It's really her.

Toboe:
My heart just skipped a beat!

Tsume:
Who is that?
Hold on!

Kiba:
Cheza.

Cheza:
We meet at last.

Toboe:
I wanna be held like that...

Tsume:
Can that really be...?

Hige:
Yeah.
That's her. That's the Flower Maiden.

Toboe:
We're still going, and now we've got Cheza with us.

-Ending-

Hige:
In life, changing your point of view can let you see different sides of things.
Like, you might think a guy is nice, but he's really a jerk.
Or that someone's clever, but he's actually an idiot.
Hey, that's me! No, wait, I'm not like that!
What the hell am I talking about?
