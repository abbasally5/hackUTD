  -Opening-

Soldier #1:
This makes six shots.

Soldier #2:
"A rifle was fired at four young men accompanying a girl who's believed to be the target".

Soldier #1:
It's just like he said to the Commander.

Soldier #3:
Those "Forest of Death" rumours...do you think they're true?

Soldier #2:
The Geomagnetic abnormalities have been confirmed.
Compasses are useless, and machines go haywire the minute you turn 'em on.

Soldier #3:
They say nobody's ever gone in and made it back out alive, right?
I wouldn't be surprised if that place was haunted.

Soldier #1:
Ha! If you're so curious, why not go in?

Soldier #3:
Get real.

Hige:
Man, this place is depressing.
I thought forests were supposed to be more alive, you know?

Toboe:
It's the Forest of Death, remember?

Kiba:
That's the reason the humans can't follow us in here.

Hige:
Well, we don't have to rely on compasses or whatever...
But shouldn't there at least be some animals? You know, like a rabbit or a fox?

Toboe:
Rabbit, huh? In other words, you're hungry.

Hige:
Sue me, alright?

Kiba:
We'll probably come across a town once we're through this forest.
Just hang in there until then.

Tsume:
If we make it out of here alive, that is.
There are plenty of bugs though.

Toboe:
Thanks a lot, Tsume.

Tsume:
I've never seen a bug like this.
Here.
You're hungry, aren't you? Chow down.

Hige:
Why the hell should I?

Toboe:
'Cause you've got the strongest stomach, right?

Tsume:
Eat it.

Hige:
I ain't your taster!
And how come you're giving me orders? You're not our leader or anything?
Right?
Hey, I know!
Let's give it to Cheza!
I bet you're hungry, right?

Kiba:
Cheza does not eat bugs.

Hige:
Well then, what should we feed her?

Cheza:
This one doesn't eat. Anything.

Hige:
Not a thing?

Tsume:
Now that you mention it, I've never seen her eat...

Toboe:
She drank some water that one time.

Cheza:
This one drinks and basks.

Kiba:
Basks in what?

Cheza:
But not here.

Toboe:
Oh, I get it! Sunlight!

Hige:
Makes sense, she is a flower...

Quent:
It was just like I told you, right?

Commander:
Four 30-caliber metal jacket slugs.

Quent:
It was six.

Commander:
Now, why don't we try this again, from the beginning?

Quent:
Do you always treat helpful civilians this way, who are offering you information?
Of course a shot of vodka might make me more cooperative...

Commander:
I was told that you had a dog with you. So what happened to it?

Quent:
Ain't there anything to drink around here?

Commander:
We found animal bite marks on the corpses of my dead men.
There weren't any pet dogs in that town, much less any strays.

Quent:
Well shucks, Commander. I guess they all must've been killed by wolves.
Yeah, sure, it must've been wolves.

Kiba:
Let me see it.

Toboe:
Okay.

Kiba:
Well, it doesn't look sprained.

Hige:
He can't even handle this little forest...
Like I always say, you can't take city kids to the woods.

Kiba:
Do you think you can walk?

Toboe:
I'm okay. I can walk just... Ah!

Hige:
Cheza?

Toboe:
Cheza?
Wow, thanks, Cheza.

Hige:
Does that... feel good?

Toboe:
Real good! The pain is just melting away.

Hige:
Cheza? Um... Could you pet me too?

Toboe:
C'mon, Tsume! Have Cheza pet you too!
It feels unbelievable!

Hige:
She smells so good!

Cher:
Where have you taken me?

Darcia:
Please forgive my rude behaviour.
I simply wanted to see you.

Cher:
Where's Cheza?

Darcia:
It would seem Cheza despises both me and your people.

Cher:
What are you after anyway?
Tell me, Cheza... what is she? What's her significance?

Darcia:
Lord Orkham is ignorant of her purpose.
He stole the Flower Maiden from my clan solely as a display of his power.

Cher:
What do you intend to do with me?

Darcia:
That depends entirely on you.

Hige:
This forest ain't so bad once you get used to it.
Nothing to fight over.
And the best part is there's no humans around!
We've got it all to ourselves.

Toboe:
Yeah, and if we get hungry, there's plenty of bugs we can eat.

Hige:
Fat chance, pal!

Tsume:
Then you better not complain when we don't share 'em with you.

Hige:
I'll say it again. Who the hell died and made you the leader, huh?

Kiba:
Neither one of us is the leader, Hige. Ours just isn't the kind of pack that has one.

Tsume:
What kind of pack are we, then?

Toboe:
Guys, c'mon, that doesn't really matter, right?
Hey, I know! When we all finally make it out of here, what's the very first thing you want to do?

Hige:
What do you think?

Tsume:
Eat as much as I can.

Kiba:
Eat and sleep.

Toboe:
I guess you're right...

Hige:
You moron! Isn't it obvious?

Kiba:
Cheza!
You must be exhausted. We'll rest a while.

Cheza:
It is alright, this one is fine.

Hige:
A bird!

Toboe:
Where?

Tsume:
It's the Forest of Death. You must be seeing things.

Hige:
No, I'm sure I heard the flapping of wings above us.
It was from an owl.
Which means...
We got bird meat!

Tsume:
Hey! Hige!
Come back here!
Damn it...
What an idiot... Stay here.

Toboe:
Okay.

Tsume:
You must've seen some dead leaves falling or something.
Let's go back.

Hige:
It doesn't make sense... I'm absolutely sure I saw it.

Owl:
Hoo! Hoo!

Hige:
See, what did I tell you? It was an owl!
But there isn't enough meat to split with everybody...

Tsume:
Careful, Hige.
There isn't any scent.
There's something suspicious about that owl.

Owl:
An owl that's suspicious...
Wolves that look delicious...
They all wandered in and got lost as one...
Well done!

Tsume:
The thing is screwing with us!

Owl:
Lost as one, well done, well done!

Tsume:
Damn it.

Hige:
That howl! Is that...

Tsume:
Toboe!

Kiba:
Cheza! Hang in there! You can do it!

Tsume:
What's wrong?

Toboe:
All of sudden, she just...

Tsume:
What?
Is that...is she withering?

Kiba:
She needs water. Even sunlight would help!

Tsume:
But there isn't any...
The woods are too thick.
And the ground, it's too dry.
We'll never find any water here.

Kiba:
We have to!
We still have to try!

Toboe:
Which way do you think we should go?

Hige:
I say to the right.

Kiba:
Hige, do you smell any water from there?

Hige:
No, not a drop. But just standing here isn't helping us any.

Owl:
Here isn't helping!
Here isn't helping!

Kiba:
It's an owl.

Tsume:
The damn thing is back.

Owl:
It can't be helped if there is no light.
It can't be helped if there is no water.
It can't be helped if the flower is withering.

Kiba:
What did you say?

Toboe:
Wait a minute.
That owl probably lives here in this forest, right?
And if he does, don't you think he knows where we can find water?

Kiba:
Alright, tell us!
What's the closest place around here that has water?

Hige:
Stupid bird! Cut the theatrics already and spill it!

Kiba:
Do you live here in this forest or not? And if you do, then tell us!
She has to have water now!

Cheza:
Kiba...
Kiba? Who are you talking to?

Kiba:
To an owl, Cheza.

Cheza:
An owl?

Owl:
Hoo...

Kiba:
Come on! Isn't there any water in this forest?

Owl:
Go astray, go astray, my good wolves.
Answers always lie in confusion.

Tsume:
We can't lose him!
He's the only lead we've got!

Owl:
You never find what you are looking for.
If the searcher were to find that which is searched for, it would become a mere object.
The answer lies within the darkness.
The answer lies within confined spaces.
Only those who bravely enter will be rewarded.

Toboe:
Is that a riddle?

Hige:
Bird-brain wants us to go in the cave.

Toboe:
So does that mean there's water inside?

Tsume:
How should I know?

Hige:
Hey! Don't go in there!
Are you gonna believe what some old owl tells you?
This whole thing stinks!

Kiba:
You tell me where we can find water, then!
Can you do that, Hige?
At this point, we don't have any other choice.

Cher:
So much data!

Darcia:
You only know the slightest fraction about Cheza.

Cher:
Is what was written in the Book of the Moon the truth?

Darcia:
Tell me. Do you believe what you've read?

Cher:
I've seen them. I've seen wolves.
They were running together by Cheza's side.

Darcia:
I see.

Cher:
I'm sure of it now. They were the same wolves who turned up in the city.
The same ones who first appeared when Cheza awakened.

Darcia:
They will be the key to Paradise.

Cher:
To Paradise?

Owl:
Only those who bravely enter...
Who bravely enter...
Who bravely enter...

Hige:
We saw this thing a while ago!

Toboe:
You mean we've been going in circles?

Tsume:
Stupid place is like a maze.
And to make matters worse, it all looks the same...

Kiba:
We went left last time.
Damn it all!

Tsume:
Just take it easy, will you?

Toboe:
Kiba, you're just tired, right?
You want me to carry her?

Kiba:
Why? Can you carry her?
Do you think you can carry her? Answer me!

Toboe:
Well, I...

Kiba:
I'm fine, so walk! We don't have time to take a rest!

Tsume:
Would you cut the crap?
We can't trust your nose anymore. The scent of flowers has screwed it up.

Kiba:
My nose is fine!

Tsume:
Kiba, put Cheza down.

Kiba:
Tsume, do you still not trust her?

Tsume:
With the way you've been acting, it's you we can't trust.
As leader of a pack, you have to be calm and detached.
And right now, you don't have that.
It's impossible for someone to be right all the time, you know.

Kiba:
Stay out of my way.

Tsume:
Is that a threat?

Toboe:
Guys, cut it out!
Are they...bones?

Hige:
Human bones?

Toboe:
I'm not so sure. I think...they're from a bird.

Hige:
A bird?

Toboe:
It looks like... Wait, could this be an owl?
There's a million of 'em!

Tsume:
I knew we shouldn't have trusted that owl!

Hige:
Let's get out of here!

Toboe:
Where can we go?

Kiba:
Cheza?

Toboe:
Get off! Stupid bug!

Tsume:
Kiba!
Up here!

Kiba:
Tsume!

Cheza:
Tsume...

Tsume:
We'll handle it.
Are wolves gonna lose to a bunch of bugs?

Toboe:
Though I must admit, we both like to hang around flowers...

Hige:
Nicely said, runt.

Kiba:
Here they come!

Cheza:
Everyone...
Wait...We'll all go...together.
This one can be useful, too...

Kiba:
Cheza!

Tsume:
Damn it!

Toboe:
Cheza, no! What are you doing?

Cheza:
That way! Through there!

Kiba:
Cheza!
Cheza!

Tsume:
No, wait.

Kiba:
Cheza...

Cheza:
Don't worry. This one is fine.

Kiba:
Thank goodness.

Cheza:
This one heard them. They said they were hungry.

Tsume:
They're plants that eat bugs, huh?

Hige:
I guess this means we were saved by Cheza's friends.

Toboe:
Hey, guys!
I see light! It's the way out!
There's water!
And check it out! There's moonlight too!

Hige:
Water! Yes!

Kiba:
Look, Cheza. There's your water. Now you can...

Cheza:
This one will be able to eat and drink all at once.

Kiba:
Yeah.

Hige:
Hey, Toboe, drink up, you runt!

Toboe:
I've had plenty!

Hige:
Aw, c'mon!

Tsume:
Hige, leave him alone.

Darcia:
The life of a flowers is very brief.
And Lunar Flowers are no exception.
Moonlight will give her strength to survive for now.
However, after basking in the full moon only a few more times, Cheza's life will come to an end.

-Ending-

Kiba:
No one really knows what the future has in store for them.
If they can't avoid it, then why do people always want to know what it is?
On the night of the full moon, the path will be revealed.
