  -Opening-

Cher:
So how are your men holding up?
If there's anything I can do to help out...

Commander:
Our own medical staff is more than enough to handle the situation.
I can't believe that ten of my men were injured, while we let them escape.
But they won't be able to get away from us, not from this aerial city.

Cher:
Commander, who do you think those boys really are?

Commander:
I would imagine they're some of Lord Darcia's people.

Cher:
To be honest, I'm not so sure...
That expression that the Flower Maiden had on her face when she was running with those boys...
Cheza was smiling.
She was smiling, as if she were truly happy.

Commander:
Crying, smiling, it makes no difference.
Our mission is to bring back that flower with detectable life signs, and that's just what we're gonna do.

Cher:
It can't be. That's impossible.

Toboe:
She can tell?

Hige:
Well, sure. She's a Flower Maiden, isn't she?

Toboe:
Yeah, but how?

Hige:
She uses her antennae, how else?

Toboe:
She doesn't have any of them!

Hige:
I know you can't see 'em or anything, but I bet they're there.

Toboe:
I wonder if she's on edge. I mean, around us. But why?

Kiba:
It's because you're all on edge around her, that's why.

Tsume:
Who the hell wouldn't be on edge?
She's not a human, and she's not a wolf.
Or even a flower.
How are we ever supposed to trust something like that?
And even more so 'cause a Noble created it.
Are we really going to take her with us?

Kiba:
Yeah.

Tsume:
What for?

Toboe:
I don't see anything wrong with it.
It'd be mean to just leave her here, and besides, I think it'd be kinda nice to always have the smell of Lunar Flowers around. Don't you?

Tsume:
Isn't that exactly what makes her a danger to us?
If she stinks up the place while we're moving around, it's as good as giving away our location.

Kiba:
A human's sense of smell isn't that sensitive.

Tsume:
But my eyes tell me she's trouble.
What good is she to us, anyway?

Kiba:
Cheza is more important to us than anything else. And if you're a wolf, Tsume, you should know this.

Tsume:
Sorry, but I don't.

Kiba:
She's gonna get us to Paradise!

Tsume:
I am so sick of hearing that word.

Toboe:
All of a sudden, I'm feeling...really sleepy...

Tsume:
Damn it, Toboe, don't fall asleep!

Toboe:
Too late... My body's already out cold...

Tsume:
What's happening?

Kiba:
I have no idea what's going on.
I just...

Toboe:
Cats always freak me out...
Is this where we were supposed to hook up?

Hige:
What the hell is that thing?

Toboe:
I thought that maybe she might be cold.

Hige:
What are you talking about? She's a flower. Cold's got nothing to do with it.

Toboe:
But still I... What are those?

Hige:
I figured the mountain paths might be a little rough on her delicate feet.

Toboe:
Even if she's a flower?

Hige:
Come on, let's go.

Toboe:
Hmmm.

Cheza:
You slept the longest out of everyone.
Did you have sweet dreams?

Tsume:
I don't remember.

Cheza:
You were running while you were sleeping.

Kiba:
It's no use. Those people are covering every road that leads off the mountain.
We're gonna have to find another way out of here.

Tsume:
Next time, don't leave it here with me. I'm not gonna be responsible.

Kiba:
I tried to wake you up, but you didn't even budge.
Besides, you seemed pretty happy wherever you were.

Tsume:
Oh, shut up! I was tired, that's all!

Toboe:
Is it just me, or do you get the feeling we're being watched?

Hige:
Yeah.

Toboe:
You don't think it's them, do you?

Hige:
With their stench, I can smell them coming a mile away.

Toboe:
I heard something from the cats here.
They said there's a ghost wandering around.

Hige:
You say a ghost?
Is she following us?

Toboe:
Yeah.
Is that a ghost?

Hige:
Run!

Commander:
What does this mean?

Soldier:
We think they must have used some sort of sharp knife.

Commander:
Very well.
I want all of you men to split up into your squads and take the routes I gave you.

Soldiers:
Sir!

Cher:
Human infiltration tactics?

Commander:
Only because it seems like a waste of time to wait around for radar readings.

Cher:
Commander?
Have you heard of how wolves might still be alive even today?

Commander:
No, I haven't.

Cher:
There's a very real possibility that these boys we saw aren't ordinary humans.
They could be wolves who've learned to survive by deceiving us.

Commander:
Well, well...
I always knew there was a thin line between scientists and daydreamers, but I never would have expected you'd be one of the latter.

Hige:
Wow, that was rough!

Toboe:
We're back!

Kiba:
You two sure took a long time.

Hige:
The runt here kept wandering off.
Here, some food.

Toboe:
We picked up some other things, too.

Tsume:
What the hell do you plan to do with that?

Toboe:
What do you think? It's a present.
Here!
I guess you don't like it?

Kiba:
It sure looks that way.

Hige:
What did I tell you? Now these are great.

Tsume:
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

Hige:
You like 'em, huh?

Kiba:
Cheza?

Cheza:
Who are you?

Hanabito:
You are wolves.

Kiba:
Old lady, who are you?

Cher:
Why is it suddenly...

Kiba:
Tell us. Who are you?

Hanabito:
The Hanabito is what they used to called us.

Cheza:
This one could tell that from your scent.
But you're not like this one?

Hanabito:
That is true.
You are not like my kind. You are a perfect creation.

Kiba:
Perfect creation?

Hanabito:
You must know I have been here waiting for you for a long time.

Toboe:
I guess she wasn't a ghost.

Hige:
That stench.

Kiba:
It's them!

Tsume:
I've got a feeling we shouldn't hang around here any longer.

Toboe:
Do you think it's safe to go with her?

Hige:
If she's like Cheza, we shouldn't have to worry.

Hanabito:
I felt them within my body, the terrible events that occurred...
And those Hanabito who were the unfortunate and imperfect ones had no choice but to wither and die.
I was fortunate enough to escape from the castle.
In the forest at the foot of the mountain, I stayed in hiding.
For a long, long time.
And before I knew it, I was left all alone.
Even if you know nothing about yourself, I do.
I know you well indeed.

Cheza:
All this time, this one has been asleep and waiting. Waiting just for him.

Hanabito:
The wolf seeks out the flower, and the flower seeks out the wolf.
And yet, no matter how you feel, you must not go with them.

Cheza:
But why?

Hanabito:
It will only lead to destruction.

Kiba:
Are you crazy?

Hanabito:
I'm not talking to you!

Kiba:
Come on, Cheza. Let's go.

Hanabito:
The faintest scent of flower can offer is all I have left now.
And soon, it too will fade completely.

Cheza:
What should this one do, then?

Hanabito:
You have the ability to sustain the life of a Hanabito.
Stay here...

Kiba:
Cheza, don't listen to her!

Hanabito:
Wolf, just what precisely do you hope to achieve by taking this precious girl with you?

Cheza:
To get to Paradise.
We are going to Paradise.

Tsume:
Be quiet!

Hige:
I smelled her back at the castle.
I know I've seen her before, but I don't know where...

Tsume:
What now?

Kiba:
Let's go.
Cheza, let's go!

Cher:
You're the boys I saw...
Who are you? What's going on here?
Cheza!
I found them! I found the boys who took Cheza!
Why is it... What's going on?

Commander:
What happened?
Does this ridiculous radar pick up everything, even flowers and trees?
Search the town!

Cheza:
She is crying.
She will wither away.

Kiba:
Do you mean the old lady?

Cheza:
Kiba, can this one stay with you?
Is it alright that this one stays with you?

Kiba:
Cheza, you have to stay with us.

Cheza:
Hige?

Hige:
Sure, why not? When you're on a journey, the more the merrier.

Cheza:
Toboe?
Tsume?

Tsume:
Fine, you can tag along.
If it gets us to where we're going, I can put up with you.

Hanabito:
Dear, it's alright.
My having met you was enough.

Cheza:
This one is going.
With them.
With the rest of them.

Hanabito:
I will pray for you. I will pray for your safety...

Cheza:
Ever since we came here, this one has heard voices.

Hanabito:
The flowers are singing.
They're always singing.
But people never seem to notice...

Cheza:
This one's sorry.

Tsume:
Did either of you tell her about Paradise?

Hige:
I didn't.

-Ending-

Cher:
It's said that a flower's life is brief. I can relate. I'm getting to that age where working all night takes a toll on your body.
There are some nights when I feel like having a quiet drink alone, alright?
