  (Tsume's Recap Episode)

-Opening-

Tsume:
I can't remember anymore how long it's been since I first found my way here.
Or even why the hell I decided to come.
The stench of this city only adds to the pervading filth.
The cold wind the creeps in through the cracks in the dome makes its way into every damn inch of this place.
Scavenging rats feeding off the trash.
Greedy gossiping crows.
Humans with exhausted faces.
Residents perfectly suited to life in this city.

Man:
What the hell?!
Let go, damn it!

Tsume:
And me?
What else? I was starving.

Let's go.

Thief:
Hurry up!
Dumbass!

Gehl:
Tsume...

Tsume:
There's a risk that comes with almost everything, but if you're strong enough, you can always get food.
Survival of the fittest. It's the one rule that applies, no matter where you go.
This city isn't really so bad.
I found a place where I truly belonged.
Everything was fine. And then he showed up.

Tsume:
What is it?

Thief #1:
It's a dog.
But I don't think it's gonna make it.

Thief #2:
Maybe it's worth something.

Thief #3:
Maybe we can eat it.

Thief #4:
I've never seen a dog this big. The sucker's huge.

Tsume:
That is not a dog.
Pull it out.

Thief #1:
Okay...

Tsume:
How interesting...
That was quite a stunt.

Kiba: 
I was protecting myself, that's all.

Tsume:
Don't be so quick to kill.

Kiba:
What's wrong with killing?

Tsume:
I don't know what mountain you came down from, but you're in the city now.
There are rules.

Kiba:
Rules?
Is running around this city with a pack of idiots one of the rules?

Tsume:
I'm only using 'em.

Kiba:
Your rules stink like this city.
What's the point of living if it means throwing away your pride?

Tsume:
You've got a big mouth for someone half dead.

Gehl:
Are you okay, Tsume?
Hey, you're bleeding.

Tsume:
Don't touch me!
And stay out of my business.

Gehl:
I wanted to thank you.
You saved my life back there.
I always thought maybe you didn't care if one of your friends got killed.
I guess I thought maybe I'd never be one of your friends.

Tsume:
We're not friends.
It's just... I'm not like you people.

Chen:
Hey, Tsume!
Where's the fire?
Can't we slow down a little?
There's nobody following us.

Tsume:
I know.

Sedo:
Haven't we gotten enough already?
I'm mean, there's plenty to go around.

Tsume:
The provisions for the Nobles are going to be passing through the checkpoint tomorrow.

Gehl:
We're gonna hit 'em again?

Tsume:
Chen, Sedo, you're in the advance squad.

Chen:
Why doesn't that surprise me?

Gehl:
Yeah, but we messed it up bad there last week.
Security's gonna to be even tighter now.
We lost two of us today as it is.

Tsume:
Gehl, you're on standby.
Anyone who isn't willing to fight should get out now.

In the end, it's a human city.
It's much too cramped for a wolf to live in.
I guess I knew that from the beginning.
I could try and run from it all I wanted, but this burning feeling in my gut would never disappear.

Gehl:
I'm coming with you guys.
I wanna fight.
I can help you.
Just tell me what to do.

Tsume!

Chen:
They say the Nobles have put a bounty on every gang in the city.

Tsume:
Is that so?

Sedo:
Yeah, they've already started to round people up.
And our stuff's been kinda high-profile lately.
We figure we're next.
Maybe it's time we should move on.
There's a freight train pulling outta town at midnight.
We can sneak on...

Tsume:
Our next raid is gonna be tonight.
Make the usual preparations.

Chen:
Why? So you can just sit back and watch?
Gehl's dead because of you. You let him die.
Sorry, pal, but I ain't working with you anymore.
I wouldn't wanna slow you down now, would I?

Tsume:
Suit yourself.

Woman #1:
Did you hear? Someone saw a wolf in town. Can you believe it?

Woman #2:
What is the world coming to?
You don't suppose it was just a big dog, do you?

Woman #1:
From what I heard, no one's ever seen a dog that big before.
Oh, these are troubled times.

Tsume:
No matter where we go, nothing ever changes.
We may disguise our true form, but we're still wolves.
I should have known better than to get mixed up with a clumsy pup like him.

Quent:
A boy?
No, you're not a boy.

Tsume:
Jump!
Hurry up!

Toboe:
I was getting ready to!

Hey, you're Tsume, right?
This is a first for me. I've never met a wolf. I mean, other than myself.
I heard rumours about you from the crows though.
They said you make friends with humans and run wild with them.

Tsume:
You heard wrong. I don't have friends.

Toboe:
I'm Toboe. Thanks for the help back there.
You know what? I've been living with humans my whole life too â€“

Tsume:
Just get lost, will you?
I'm getting pissed off, and that only happens when I'm around idiots.

Toboe:
So what are you gonna do now? Do you have somewhere to go?

Tsume:
Who knows?

Toboe:
I wonder if I'll ever see Leara again...
Hey, you think it'd be okay if I went to visit her?

Tsume:
You saw that look on her face, didn't you?

Toboe:
She was just...a little surprised, that's all.

Tsume:
You can't be serious. She was pissing in her pants.

Toboe:
She was not!

Tsume:
That girl was reeking of it.

Toboe:
Why do you have to lie about everything?
Why can't you just be honest with yourself for once?

Tsume:
Fine, whatever. If you want to go, then go.
It's not like I care what happens to you.

Toboe:
So why did you save me, then?
If you really don't care, then you should have just left me, or pretended not to recognise me.
I mean, I'm not your friend or anything...

Tsume:
You're right. You're not my friend.

Toboe:
Yeah, I forgot, you're only friends with humans.
It's easier that way, isn't it?
'Cause no human is ever gonna be as strong as you. They'll do whatever you tell them to.

Tsume:
You don't know what you're talking about!
You have no idea what it takes to survive in this city, how dangerous it is.
Nothing!
Go on. Let's see how well you do on your own.
Beat it!

Toboe:
Being alone doesn't bother you?

Tsume:
Hey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I ever got mixed up with a kid like you.
I'm sick of friends. Who needs 'em?

Sedo:
Tsume!

Tsume:
You sold me out?

Sedo:
They got caught when we tried to sneak on the train.
We couldn't let just you get away scot free.

Tsume:
You damn humans...

You're pretty good.

Damn it.

Hige:
What a crap heap. Why the hell did you bring us here?

Toboe:
Tsume!

Hige:
Wha-?

Kiba:
I could smell the blood from your wound.

Tsume:
What?

Kiba:
I smelled it all the way here from town.

Tsume:
And you're gonna nurse me back to health?
Well, I don't need your help.

Toboe:
Tsume, look, I...
We're leaving the city. I really think you should come with us.

Tsume:
And just where is this merry band of yours going?

Kiba:
To Paradise.

Tsume:
You're kidding me. You're going with them because you believe in that crap?

Toboe:
I don't know, but...
If we stay here, we'll have to spend the rest of our lives in hiding or worse.
We just can't live with the humans anymore and survive.

Hige:
Look, I hate to interrupt, but a nasty stink is headed this way.

Tsume:
We're surrounded.

Kiba:
Let me ask you. Why did you guys come to this city?
It was because of the flower scent, wasn't it?
Well, it's gone now. There's no reason to stay.

Tsume:
The flower has nothing to do with it.
I'm here because I belong.

Kiba:
I can see that. This city is a dump.

Tsume:
I still have a score to settle with you.

Hige:
We don't have time for this!

Tsume:
The last time we met, you said something about how your pride wouldn't allow you to pass as a human.
Well, you look pretty human now. Where'd your pride go?

Kiba:
Nowhere. Nothing has changed.

Tsume:
Do you have the slightest idea of what leaving the city would mean?

Kiba:
Yeah.

Tsume:
You'll just die.

Kiba:
Possibly. Everyone's gonna die. It's a natural part of life.
But if life has no purpose, you're dead already.

Toboe:
Thank you.

Tsume:
Go on. Hurry up!

Toboe:
You're really not coming with us?
Tsume!

Hige:
What the hell are you stopping for?

Toboe:
Tsume!

Kiba:
This way!

Hige:
Jump already!

Toboe:
I was getting ready to, alright?

Tsume:
Move it!

Hubb:
Hey, wait a minute!

Toboe:
Tsume, what are you waiting for? C'mon, jump!

Kiba:
Are you scared?

Tsume:
Yeah, you wish.

Screw this stupid journey.
Paradise can kiss my ass.
I'm just...fed up with this stinking town.
It was time to move on, anyway.

Kiba:
I saw them once before, when I was little.
I was still just a cub. In the region where I was born, they had blossomed all over.
White flowers that only bloomed under a full moon...
They were Lunar Flowers.
They were all burned to ashes.
A fire raged across our land...it burned all the flowers in an instant.
And all...all of my friends, whose escape route was cut off, were killed.
I was the only one who survived.
Why me? Why just me?
I don't have a pack anymore.
The only place for me now is Paradise.

-Ending-

Toboe:
There's all kinds of things in this world.
And you can't really do much about most of it.
But sometimes just waiting to see what happens is what makes the journey fun, don't you think?
I wonder whatever happened to that girl?
