  Troop member:
#23, huh?

Troop member:
Doesn't look like any others are with him.

Hige:
Why did they spare me?
I don't get it.

Cher:
Just ignore it. Don't stop. Keep walking.

Man:
Damn it, let go!
That bastard! I paid him a fortune for this!

Cher:
We lucked out. Looks like ours are the real thing.

Blue:
The city looks a lot different up here than it does down below.

Cher:
Yeah. It's so clean and orderly...Almost anti-septic.

Blue:
But not in a good way.

Cher:
It's like it'd become more dangerous the further we go in.

Blue:
Maybe, but it doesn't matter. Cheza's in there.

-Opening-

Tsume:
We've been to all kinds of places before, but...

Kiba:
But what?

Tsume:
I've never felt such a sense of danger as I do here.
Every hair on my body is on end.
This stupid place is freaking me out, and I don't like it.

Kiba:
Well, there's something new.

Tsume:
How's what?

Kiba:
I never expected to hear you whine so much.

Tsume:
It's a normal reaction under the circumstances.

Kiba:
Well, why don't you just go back then?

Tsume:
And leave all the excitement to you? Not a chance, pal.

Toboe:
Huh? Oh man, I'm going in circles!
Geez... There's no scent at all in this place!
Cleanliness is one thing, but this is ridiculous!
I wonder if Hige headed back to meet up with the others already?

Hige:
Damn it... What the hell is going on around here?

Cher:
I thought we could get to Jaguara's keep if we headed for the center of the city, but all these streets are so convoluted.
Besides the fact that everything looks the same.
It's as if someone's deliberately trying to make us lost.

Blue:
There's something unnerving about this place.
It doesn't seem human at all.

Cher:
Ma'am? Could you help us?

Elderly citizen:
Certainly.

Cher:
Thanks. I'm wondering if this is where we can catch a bus here that will take us to the keep.

Elderly citizen:
No, dear.

Cher:
Do you know where, then?

Elderly citizen:
There aren't any buses like that, dear.

Cher:
Well, what about one that goes near it?

Elderly citizen:
I think you're confused, dear. There's no keep in this city.

Cher:
I...

Schoolgirls:
C'mon, hurry!
Wait for me!

Blue:
What's the deal with the people here? It's like they've all been brainwashed.

Cat:
Pretty close. The people in this city are all zombies.

Blue:
What do you mean?

Cat:
They live their lives in a comfortable daze. They don't think, they don't feel, and they don't question.
So what do you want to know?

Blue:
Well, a couple of things. Like what's the truth hiding underneath the facade of this place.

Cat:
Come with me.

Blue:
Where to?

Cher:
Blue, what's the matter?

Blue:
It looks like we might finally get some answers.

Cher:
Hey, wait!
A bookstore? 
Oh, I see... They might have a map of the city here.
Excuse me, sir. We were hoping you'd have a city map.

Store owner:
Map, huh? You must be outsiders.
Don't be alarmed. I was an outsider myself once.

Cher:
Oh.

Store owner:
Of course, I was a lot younger then.
That's right, boy. So were you.
Don't get many requests for maps these days. The people who live here don't need 'em.

Cher:
Why's that?

Store owner:
Because they're not interested in anything that doesn't have to do with their own lives.
Alright, we're currently in this area.
And over here is where you'll find Jaguara's keep, at the heart of the city.

Cher:
What's this?

Store owner:
They say that's where the crucible lies. It generates the city's energy.

Cher:
Crucible?

Store owner:
The Moonlight Crucible.

Cher:
Moonlight Crucible? I've never heard of such a thing. What is it?

Store owner:
Beats me. No one really talks about it.

Cher:
How can everyone be so completely ignorant about what's happening in their own city?
Doesn't anybody even bother to think about what's happening around them?

Store owner:
Thinking only causes more trouble than it's worth. Why should we care about things that don't concern us?

Cher:
Do you honestly believe that this life will go on forever?

Store owner:
Why would I have any reason to think otherwise?

Cher:
If you've been outside, then that should be reason enough.
Didn't you see what's happening to the world?

Store owner:
Oh, yes. It was like a bad dream.

Cher:
It's not a dream. It's real.

Store owner:
Trust me. Once you've lived here for a while, you won't care about anything either.
Just like the rest of us.

Cher:
Fine. I'll just take this.

Store owner:
Suit yourself. But I think you're wasting your money.

Cher:
Let's go.

Store owner:
The sooner you get used to living here, the happier you'll be.

Cat:
They may say that, but he's not used to this place, either. Not completely, anyway.

Blue:
You don't know how lucky you are.

Toboe:
Even from way up here, I can't tell where anything is...
The old guy made it! I'm so glad...

Quent:
Hold it!

Tsume:
I smell something.

Kiba:
Tsume!

Tsume:
Kiba! Kiba, can you hear me?
At least we're both heading for the same place. One thing's for sure...I smell flowers.

Cher:
I'm starting to think it really was a waste of money.
The roads leading to the keep aren't marked at all on this thing.
Maybe it means that the only ones who can go in and out are the Nobles and those soldiers.
Blue?

Blue:
Cheza. I wonder if she's alright.
You don't think they're hurting her, do you?

Cher:
I know you're worried for her. You wolves have such a strong affection for Cheza. Why do you think that is?

Blue:
It's because of Paradise.
She's going to guide us there. At least that's what Hige and the other wolves believe.

Cher:
"Wolves will open the way to Paradise"...So the story was true.

Blue:
Whenever I'm around Cheza, I feel like I really am a wolf, you know?
Back when I was living in Kyrios, it never even crossed my mind that I was a wolf. Not once.

Cher:
Kyrios?

Blue:
It was this little nice town. We were so happy there.

Cher:
Do you want to go back?

Blue:
No, I wish I could. But it was destroyed in a fire a long time ago.

Cher:
I see.
I guess I don't have anywhere to go back to, either.
I'll go with you. We'll both go to Paradise.

Great, another dead end. What in the world is wrong with this stupid city?

Troop member #1:
Excuse me, Miss. Are you lost?

Cher:
No.

Troop member #2:
What town are you ladies from?

Cher:
What do you mean?

Troop member #2:

You don't have to hide it. If you both have the proper identification, we don't really care.
As long as you're not from Freeze City, that is.

Blue:
We're from a little town called Kyrios.

Troop member #1:
Did you say Kyrios?
It's strange that you'd come from there. Only because I could've sworn that Kyrios was wiped from the planet many years ago.

Troop member #3:
Yeah, it was the first time we attacked after I joined up.

Blue:
What do you mean?

Troop member #3:
We burned every inch of that place to the ground.

Cher:
But why on earth would you do that?

Troop member #2:
A pack of wolves was hiding there. And it was our mission to kill 'em all.
Man, that was a beautiful fire.

Troop member #2:
Hey, she's a wolf!

Troop member #1:
What?!

Troop member #3:
Damn it!

Troop member #1:
Relax, will you? She may have escaped for now, but she'll never get out of this city alive.

Blue:
Wolves didn't do it after all, Pops. It wasn't them...
Hige, is that you?
Hige!

Hige:
Blue?

Blue:
What in the world happened to you? Did someone hurt you, Hige?

Hige:
You made it out of that place in one piece... I'm glad...

Blue:
But where are the others?

Hige:
I don't know, we got split up.

Blue:
Oh.
I always believed that you and I would see each other again, but I never thought it would be in a back alley of this awful place.
The only thing I could ask for now would be to find Pops...
Hige, I could tell him so much!
That it was the soldiers from this city who attacked and burned our village. They were the ones who killed my family.
The wolves didn't have anything to do with it... It wasn't them. It was never them.

Hige:
Hey, Blue... How about you and I get out of this place?

Blue:
Huh?

Hige:
We can't stay in a city like this forever.

Blue:
But the others are still alive, right? And what about Cheza?

Hige:
I don't care!
Come on.

Blue:
Wait, what's the matter with you?
Hige, what's happened?

Hige:
They're watching me...
They're watching me again, I know it!
Always... They've always been watching!

Blue:
You're starting to scare me, Hige.
Hige?

Hige:
We have to get out of here!

Tsume:
The scent is getting stronger. I'm close...

Toboe:
I don't have any idea which way to go...
Hey, that's it... I know where I am!
I can finally go back down!

Jaguara:
Faster, now...and even faster!

Blue:
Hige, what are we doing?

Hige:
We have to run away from here, fast!

Blue:
Run away? To where?

Hige:
It doesn't matter where! We never should have come to this stupid city in the first place!

Blue:
Would you wait a minute?
Hige, we can't just run away.
What about Cheza? And everyone else?
Are you really going to abandon them all like this?

Hige:
It's too late!
It's too late for them!
It's over... Can't you see?
And it's my fault. All of it.

Blue:
Hige.
It's Toboe.

Hige:
Toboe! No!

Jaguara:
It is time. Come to me, wolf that was chosen by the flower...

Kiba:
Cheza, I'm coming...

-Ending-

Toboe:
Have you ever gotten lost? It seems like that's all I ever do in life.
As a little bird once told me:
"Go astray, go astray, my good wolves!"
"The answers are buried beneath the sand".
Hoo!
