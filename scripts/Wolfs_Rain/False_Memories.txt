  Hige:
We have to run away from here, fast!

Blue:
Run away? To where?

Hige:
It doesn't matter where! We never should have come to this stupid city in the first place!

-Opening-

Old lady:
Stop that.
You're hurting yourself for no reason.
They all tried to get out that way.
But it was useless.

Tsume:
Who's "they"?

Old lady:
They captured my entire pack and brought us back to this place. There were many others who were caught, too.
The only wolf they spared was the one wearing the collar.

Tsume:
What did you say?

Old lady:
That bastard...betrayed every one of us.

Blue:
Hige!

Hige:
Don't follow me!

Blue:
Hige.
Hige! What's going on? Please, what happened to you?
Hey, come on... Quit playing around!
You have to get up! Toboe needs our help!
Hige!
No...
Come on, you've got to wake up! Don't do this!
Don't you die on me!
You can't...leave. Don't leave me...
Hige...

Hige:
Hey, Blue... Do me a favour, will you?
My colllar...

Blue:
Your what?

Hige:
Would you take this collar off of me?

Old lady:
My pack was relatively small.
But we managed alright.
Everyone looked out for one another.
Whenever we came upon a stray, we tried to make them feel like they were one of our own.
So, naturally, when he came along, we took him in without a second thought.
We shared our food, our beds, everything...
We should have known...
Soon after we met him, we started getting attacked by soldiers without warning.
No matter where we hid, or how far we ran, they'd find us.
When we came here, we finally figured it out.
We knew then that it was all because of him.

Hige:
It's okay. Just forget about it...

Blue:
No way! If this stupid thing is what's been hurting you, I have to get it off!

Hige:
You know what? You're a great woman...

Blue:
Don't start talking crazy on me now!

Hige:
I've been so blind...
It's funny. There's so much I never understood...but now, it all makes sense.

Blue:
Hige?

Hige:
My memories weren't real. None of them. Everything was just a lie.
Blue!

Troop member #1:
That bastard got lucky...

Quent:
Hey, Mr. Wolf Hunters!
What's that you got there?

Troop member #2:
It's none of your business.
Come on, let's go.

Quent:
I wanna know why you guys have been capturing wolves.

Troop member #1:
We are protecting our people, and securing this city.

Quent:
That recruiting poster crap doesn't work with me.

Troop member #2:
Laugh all you want, old man. Those things are extinct because of us.

Quent:
That's where you're wrong... There's still more of 'em hiding out there.
Is everyone blind in this place but me?

Hubb:
Water...
Gimme water...

Toboe:
Let go! Let go of me!

Tsume:
Toboe!

Toboe:
Tsume?
I said let go!

Hubb:
C'mon, please let me out... What's gonna happen to me?
Wait a minute... That lady...
She was a wolf?

Toboe:
Tsume?

Tsume:
What happened to Hige?

Toboe:
I don't know! We got split up!
Where's Kiba? I thought he was with you.

Tsume:
He's probably somewhere inside the keep.

Toboe:
You don't think he's been killed, do you?

Tsume:
If anything had happened, I'm sure we would have felt it.
Kiba's alive.
He has to be.

Toboe:
What d'you think's gonna happen to us?
If we don't do something, we'll all get split up, and we won't be able to save Cheza...
What're we gonna do? What do we do?

Tsume:
I don't know, but none of that's going to matter if we don't get out of here.

Toboe:
But how, Tsume? They're gonna come back and kill us just like that old lady!
I'll never see the others again...

Tsume:
You're starting to whine, runt.

Toboe:
We won't get to Paradise, either!

Tsume:
We are going to Paradise, do you hear me?
I'll be damned if I let it end like this!

Hubb:
Excuse me. Are the two of you wolves?
You are, aren't you?

Tsume:
So what? Who the hell are you?

Hubb:
Everything that was written in the Book of the Moon... Is it true?

Toboe:
Hey mister, how come you're locked up in here? You're a human.

Hubb:
If you're looking for Cheza, I was with her.
The soldiers brought us here together.
But I don't know where they're keeping her.

Toboe:
We gotta get out of here now!

Jaguara:
Can you sense it, my dear? This feeling of joy within my heart?
Everything is about to begin.
Yes. He will come. Soon, my beloved will come to me at last.

Kiba:
Cheza!
Are you alright?
At last... I finally found you...
Why won't you answer me?

Jaguara:
The white wolf.
You are the one. The "wolf chosen by the flower".
How beautiful you are...
Come, open your eyes.
Open them for my Paradise.

Cheza:
Kiba!

Jaguara:
My prayers have been answered.
Cheza, we must feast in celebration, don't you think?

Cher:
Have you seen Blue anywhere?
Why would I ask when I can't understand the answer?

Quent:
I've seen 'em, you know. The wolves, they're in this city.

Troop member #1:
You've had too much to drink, old man.

Quent:
I shall tell you now the words of Red Moon.
Only then will appear the wretched beast!
The wolves are everywhere! They're here! Can't you see them?
What the hell is wrong with you people? Have they got you all under their spell?
Open your eyes, you spineless coward!
There are wolves all around you! All over this city!
All over the world!
Open your eyes...

Troop member #1:
Dumb old fart. Think we should throw him in jail?

Troop member #2:
This isn't the time to bother with a nuisance like him.
Now when Paradise is about to open.

Quent:
Did he say Paradise is opening?

Cher:
Darcia!
Wait!

Darcia:
Will you follow me into the very heart of darkness?

Jaguara:
The preparations are now complete...
Tell me, am I not beautiful?

Servant:
Of course you are, milady.

Jaguara:
For the final rite, we will stoke the Moonlight Crucible with the wolf's blood.

Cher:
Can you tell me what's about to happen?

Cheza:
Kiba...
Kiba... Are you alive?

Kiba:
Cheza...
Cheza, sing for me...

Toboe:
It's Cheza! I can hear Cheza's song!

Hubb:
Her song?

Tsume:
Why is she crying like that?

Toboe:
I don't know. It's so sad...

Hubb:
Are you hearing Cheza's voice?
You'd both be willing to die for her...
Why would wolves sacrifice so much...

Jaguara:
Welcome to the great feast!
Tonight, Jaguara's Paradise will be loosed upon the world!

Hige:
I'm sorry I made you run so much.

Blue:
It's okay.

Hige:
Blue, I have to go.

Blue:
You're gonna save them, aren't you?

Hige:
Yeah. I have to at least try.
I guess I always thought it was luck that brought me to them.
What a joke. I was nothing but trouble for those guys from the beginning.

Blue:
That's not true...

Hige:
Yes it is. But I honestly didn't remember anything. I just thought we could all make it to Paradise.
The whole way here, that's all that was going through my mind.
And then we all ended up in this place.
That's why I have to go.

Blue:
Then I'll go with you!

Hige:
I knew you would say that. But I can't let you.

Blue:
Why not?

Hige:
I need you to wait here.

Blue:
No, Hige. Don't leave me behind!

Hige:
I won't. Please, Blue.
If I know you're waiting for me, I'll make it back, no matter what.
It's the only thing that can get me through this. If I know you're here, I won't give up. I'll do whatever it takes to come back to you!
I promise I'll never leave you alone, Blue.

Kiba:
Cheza...

-Ending-

Hubb:
What is Paradise like, I wonder?
I'm sure each of us has his own version of it.
For me, Paradise would be where my beloved wife and I could treasure our time alone together, and...
Come on! What're you making me read here?
