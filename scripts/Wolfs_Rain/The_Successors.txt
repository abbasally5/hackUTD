  Moss:
Guess the hunt has started, huh?
You know, Zali, if those kids get caught, they could be handed over to you.
If that happens, they'll be forced to work for us.
And we're gonna work 'em like dogs.
They'll feel right at home. And then, before you know it, they'll start thinking this is Paradise.

Zali:
Tell me. When did you start looking at things that way?

Moss:
What's that?


Zali:
Like one fallen so low and desperate.

Moss:
Yeah, right.
You think you're any different?
Come off it, Zali. We're only acting this way because we're all following your lead.

Toboe:
This should hopefully help his wounds heal a little faster.

Hige:
It's typical. He never thinks first. Damn Kiba.

Toboe:
He couldn't watch that without doing something about it.

Tsume:
Still, he shouldn't have butted in.

Toboe:
Tsume.

Tsume:
Let's just go, get the hell out of here.

Toboe:
But we can't move Kiba now.

Hige:
Which is exactly why we should've gotten outta here yesterday.

Tsume:
Whatever happened to living here had more going for it than you thought?

Kiba:
Let's go.

Toboe:
Wait! You're not going anywhere with these wounds and an empty stomach.

Tsume:
Well, I know somebody here who has a stuffed gut.

Hige:
Hey, you were the ones who didn't eat!
Cole was nice enough to bring us food, and you turned up your noses!
It's rude to let food waste.
I had no choice but to eat it all myself. Someone had to do it.

Toboe:
You could have left us some.

Hige:
Well, you were the ones who wandered off by yourselves, not me.

Tsume:
Did you have a nice time on your little "date"?

Hige:
I dunno. There was something about her that seemed kinda lonely.

Toboe:
So what do we do now? We've gotta do something.

Hige:
Oh, like imposing on Cole's hospitality for a while?

Tsume:
No, like you getting us something to eat! By yourself!

Hige:
By myself?
Alright, I'm going...

Toboe:
I'll go find more herbs for his wounds.

Cole:
Moss and the others left to go on patrol.

Zali:
When did our pack first begin to split?
I must have been blind not to see it coming.

Cole:
Zali...

Zali:
Am I the only one who didn't notice it was happening?
Maybe. Either that or I simply chose not to see it.

Cole:
I need to ask you something. Do you really that living here is what's best for us? That there's...nothing else?
I thought that the appearance of those boys would change you back into the man you used to be.
When they told us that they were searching for the way to Paradise, I was hoping that it would breathe some life into this city.

Zali:
They're still very young. And everything we've gone through is different.

Cole:
No, it's not. They're walking down the same road you did.
Was there really no Paradise?

Zali:
That dream is over. We've already awakened.
We all believed that one day, we could go to Paradise.
But the group I led, the ones that put their trust in me, didn't find the Paradise they were hoping for.
The tunnel was filled with toxic gas.
I lost so many of my friends that day...
I couldn't bear to lose any more of the pack.
I brought back those who survived. We carved a life out for ourselves in this city.

Cole:
And I thought when you came back for me, you'd say, "We found Paradise!"
By now, I think everyone's realised.
All the island's machinery is dead.
The gas no longer exists!
You could go back to the path and try it again...

Zali:
Cole!
It's too late now. It's over.

Tsume:
Hey. You know, we've wasted a hell of a lot of time because of you.
The others have gone off to look for food.
What were you up to last night?
I know you didn't get all those wounds at the station.
Not like I care or anything...

Kiba:
I saw them once before, when I was little.
I was still just a cub. In the region where I was born, they had blossomed all over.

Tsume:
What are you talking about?

Kiba:
White flowers that only bloomed under a full moon...
They were Lunar Flowers.
They were all burned to ashes.

Tsume:
What the hell brought this on?

Kiba:
A fire raged across our land...it burned all the flowers in an instant.
And all...all of my friends, whose escape route was cut off, were killed.
I was the only one who survived.
Why me? Why just me?
I don't have a pack anymore.
The only place for me now is Paradise.

Hige:
If it was really that easy to find food, I guess Zali's pack wouldn't be doing what they're doing, now would they?
Huh? Alright! I smell fresh mutton!
Oh, crap!
Get me outta here!
My fangs are way too delicate for this.
Oh, good, it's you. I'm glad you're here.

Moss:
So wolves still get caught in traps like that even today, huh?

Hige:
Yeah, am I ever embarrassed.

Gang Member #1:
Well, that's what happens when you get all cocky.

Hige:
I'm sorry. So, uh, you think maybe you could open this now?

Moss:
What do you think? Should we help the kid out?

Gang Member #2:
These little brats keep meddling in our business. They've been trouble from the start.

Hige:
I, uh...
Look, I'm sorry!
Come on, let me out!
What's your problem?! Are you gonna just stand there and watch me die?

Moss:
Why shouldn't I? You stuck your nose where it don't belong.
This here's our turf.

Hige:
Oh, is that right?
Well, I wouldn't want help from a bunch of old dogs, anyway!

Moss:
What?

Hige:
You're not wolves, you're not even dogs!
You're lower than humans!

Moss:
You little punk!

Male driver:
Hey, caught one right off the bat, huh?
And it's a big one, good.

Moss:
Nah, it's too wild. It'd be better to put it down.

Toboe:
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

Tsume:
What do you think you're doing?

Kiba:
I'm alright. I can move now.

Toboe:
Kiba! Are you alright?

Kiba:
Yeah. Sorry.
You're by yourself?

Tsume:
Where's Porky?

Toboe:
That's just it!
He got caught, in this really big trap, and then...and then they took him away somewhere!

Tsume:
All he has to do is fool the humans who caught him and then he can get away.

Toboe:
But he can't! He was knocked out by those wolves that we saw, the ones that live here!

Tsume:
Why the hell would they do something like that?
Where were they headed?

Toboe:
I don't know!

Tsume:
Why didn't you give us a warning by howling?
And what are you doing here, anyway? You should've followed them!

Toboe:
Yeah, you're right!

Kiba:
Let's go.

Tsume:
Where to?

Kiba:
The city...

Tsume:
This is taking forever...

Kiba:
Hey, cut it out!

Toboe:
Hurry! If we don't, they're gonna kill him!

Kiba:
Tsume, you can put me down! I can walk on my own now.

Tsume:
Alright, let's get a move on.

Toboe:
That's the lady. The one from yesterday...

Gang Member #1:
Well, now. It looks like last night's beating didn't sink in.

Cole:
Zali...

Tsume:
You mean you ordered this?

Zali:
Ordered what?

Tsume:
Don't play dumb!

Zali:
What are you talking about?

Kiba:
Is it true what we heard? That you sold out our friend to those humans?

Tsume:
Just how low will you mongrels sink?

Zali:
What's going on here?

Moss:
Hell if I know.

Toboe:
That guy said to kill him! I heard you tell those humans to kill him!

Zali:
Moss!
This is my pack!
Why in the hell did you sell out their friend?

Moss:
He's an outsider, that's why.

Gang Member #2:
Zali, isn't it you who's been selling out your friends?

Zali:
What?

Gang Member #2:
It's the truth, and you know it! You don't even do a dog's work!

Zali:
Is that how you really feel?
I always thought as the leader, I did what I had to do for the pack.
Without letting my personal feelings get in my way.
Everything I've done was to protect the pack.

Moss:
Yeah? Well, none of us sees you as the leader anymore!

Gang member:
Stay out of this!

Cole:
Stop it!
Just stop it!

Moss:
That's enough... Enough!

Zali:
Wait...
Where did they take 'em? Tell me where they took their friend, Moss!

Moss:
I don't know... I don't know!

Cole:
Zali!

Tsume:
You don't have any idea where they might have taken him?

Toboe:
They had him on the back of an orange truck.

Zali:
If you plan to give up on Paradise and turn back, now might be the time.

Kiba:
I don't have anywhere to go back to. The only thing I can do is keep moving forward.

Tsume:
Even if Hell is what we're headed towards.
You people may not have been able to find Paradise, but there's absolutely no doubt in my mind that we will.

Toboe:
Tsume...

Zali:
Come on.

Cole:
Zali.

Zali:
I can still run.

Passenger:
This one does look like he could be pretty strong.

Driver:
Yeah, but it's a royal pain to tame dogs that big.
If it went crazy, it'd be impossible to control.
Killing it ain't such a bad idea.

Passenger:
I almost feel sorry for it.
Man, I always hate having to watch 'em die.

Driver:
We're just gonna toss it into the incinerator.

Hige:
Hey! C'mon, look back here!
Damn it, do you guys always have to be so rough?

Toboe:
Do you know how lucky you are to be alive?

Tsume:
Come on, you can get out of there yourself, right?

Hige:
Yeah, but you know, that barbaric stuff really isn't my thing.

Driver:
You damn dogs!

Bartender:
You want another round?

Quent:
No, thanks. It's about time I got outta here.

Bartender:
Oh yeah? Well, the bar's gonna miss you.

Quent:
I'm leaving this city.
There's nothing left for me now.
What I'm looking for ain't here anymore.

Bartender:
So, where are you headed?

Quent:
Good question. I'll let my dog lead the way.

Bartender:
Seems pretty haphazard to me.

Quent:
Never underestimate a dog's nose.

You've butched yourself up a bit, I see.

Hubb:
We need to talk.

Quent:
Well, that's it for me. I'm done.

Hubb:
Have you ever seen this?
Is what's written inside this book just made up? Or black magic? Or a dream?

Quent:
Or reality?
Interpret it however you want.
Okay, Blue, what do you say we get going?

Hubb:
Just a minute.
Cher, the woman who left this book for me... She suddenly disappeared.
Something horrible is happening, isn't it?
It's not as if my life has ever felt that peaceful or anything...
I've always had this strange sense of restlessness inside.
I could never get a handle on what it was.

Quent:
Does it seem like the moon's getting closer?
And glowing red. As if the whole thing were burning up.

Hubb:
Does that mean the destruction of the moon? That the world is coming to an end?

Quent:
I have no idea. Maybe it just means my eyes are going bad.
But as long as I can see, I'm gonna search for those wolves.
You should look for your woman.
Blue.
If she's important to you, that is.

Hubb:
Oh, Cher...

Toboe:
This is the only way, right?

Hige:
Are you sure this tunnel is really safe?

Tsume:
I'd say it's better than being burned up with the trash.

Zali:
This is as far as I plan to go. From here on out, you're all on your own.

Kiba:
You mean you're not coming with us? You're gonna keep living here?

Zali:
I don't know if the place we tried to find was real or not.
But I believe that there are some that can make it to Paradise, and there are some who can't.
I'm convinced of that.
And it's time for you to find out for yourselves if the real Paradise does exist, somewhere at the end of this road.

Tsume:
You know, you don't seem like much of a wolf.

Kiba:
Tsume!

Tsume:
A wolf protects its own. It's not natural for it to look after another pack.

Zali:
You're right. I guess I really have fallen.
Flowers are clever things.
Even if it looks like they vanish, they never really go away, you know?.
Like a pack of wolves.
As long as there's a moon, flowers will never die.
And neither will us wolves.

-Ending-

Quent:
Sometimes you see things in this world that defy belief.
When that happens, you have only two choices.
You either believe what you see with your own two eyes, or you give up drinking.
