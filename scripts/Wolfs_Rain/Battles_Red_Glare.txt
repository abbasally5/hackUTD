  Toboe:
Did you see that flash in the clouds just now?
Look! There it is again!

Tsume:
I don't think it's the clouds that are flashing. They must be reflecting light from the ground.

Hige:
It smells like something's on fire...

Kiba:
It's the stench of battle.

-Opening-

Soldier #1:
It's no use. All communication between us and the remaining units in every city has been lost.
As of this moment, we're completely cut off.

Commander:
Alright. I've heard enough.

Soldier #2:
Jaguara and her damn thugs...

Soldier #3:
But why would she attack our city now?

Soldier #1:
They said the squad that took control of the keep seemed pretty desperate to find something.

Soldier #2:
Searching for wolves...

Soldier #1:
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would they be looking for something that's been extinct for two hundred years?

Soldier #2:
Don't be so sure. Rumour has it Jaguara still has squads that specialise in wolf hunts.

Soldier #1:
Huh?

Soldier #3:
Since you just joined up with our unit, you probably haven't heard this.
And it may sound hard to believe. Our squad saw some boys when we were sent to Darcia's aerial city.

Soldier #2:
We had to fight them when they tried to escape with the Flower Maiden, and the men who were killed were covered in claw marks.

Soldier #1:
You mean the wolves can appear as humans?

Commander:
Impossible!

Soldier #3:
Commander?

Commander:
It's nothing but superstitious nonsense.
If you let that garbage get to you, you've already lost.

Soldier #2:
We've lost? But, Commander...lost to what?

Commander:
On the battlefield, a soldier never questions why he is fighting.

Soldier #3:
But the outcome of this battle was clearly decided long ago. So what are we fighting for?

Commander:
Answer me this. Who exactly do you think we are?
We are soldiers who were hired by a Noble.
We still have weapons.
And an enemy that threatens to destroy us.
What more reason do we need?

Soldier #4:
Sir! We've secured an attack route to the flotilla of berthed airships!

Commander:
Good. Alert the men.
Unit B will blow up the airships.
Unit A and I will wait by the exit. We'll take out anyone who comes out of the Dome!

Soldiers:
Yes, sir!

Tsume:
Those stupid humans are killing each other.

Hige:
And all for a Noble's glory.

Toboe:
Kiba, we should go, don't you think?

Hige:
It's Jaguara's troops.

Tsume:
We found 'em.

Commander:
Who are those guys?
Don't move!
Alright. Who are you?
And why the hell would you want to rescue us?

Kiba:
It wasn't intentional.

Hige:
Hey, check it out. This is one of those guys that was chasing us back in that city where we first met Cheza.

Kiba:
You mean you know about Cheza?

Commander:
What are you talking about?

Toboe:
She's a girl who was made from Lunar Flowers.

Commander:
You're the boys... From Darcia's city...

Hige:
See, I told you.

Kiba:
Where did they take her?

Commander:
I thought the flower went with you, and then...

Tsume:
She was kidnapped by people wearing the same armour as these idiots.

Commander:
You mean Jaguara?
It all make sense now...
I never really understood why Jaguara would want to attack us...
Orkham... Jaguara... Darcia...
The Nobles would risk everything they had just to get their hands on that flower...

Hige:
Look, pal, we don't give a crap about what the Nobles are doing.
The only thing we wanna know is whether or not you've seen Cheza.

Commander:
No, I haven't seen her.
But if they did take the Flower to Jaguara's keep, you'll find it be heading that way.
Out beyond the sea of floating ice.
Wait a minute!
Tell me something. Are you really going to fight Jaguara alone?

Kiba:
Whether I'm alone or not, I'm always gonna fight to protect the ones that need me.
No matter what.

Soldier #1:
Commander, were those...

Commander:
That's right.

Soldier #2:
So they do exist...

Commander:
Assemble the men from units A and B that are still inside the Dome.
Take out any of Jaguara's troops that got through the blockade.

Soldier #2:
Why, sir?

Commander:
Our boys are dead, thanks to her. And we're going to settle the score right now, by killing the bastards who did this.

Blue:
You've been awfully quiet. Are you doing alright?

Cheza:
It is because this one is not alone.

Blue:
You know, I... I really like your scent a lot.
It's funny, but whenever I'm around you, I get the strangest feeling.
Even at a time like this.

Cheza:
Why did you let them take you when you were you captured with this one?
You could have escaped easily, and yet you did not.

Blue:
I guess you're right. But I just wanted to see things through for once.
Pops, and Ruus too. There was nothing I could do to protect either one of them.
When they both needed me the most, I couldn't help them.
Besides, I can't be with him.
Not anymore.
Because until the day I met you back in that city, I'd spent my whole life not knowing who I really was.
So I don't have any of that wolf's pride in me that Hige and the others seem to thrive on.
But maybe somewhere deep in my heart, I always knew what it meant.
That's why I decided that no matter what happens, I have to protect you.
I didn't mean to get so serious on you. Sorry.
It's amazing I can talk to you like this. You're almost too good to be true.
Anyway, I'm positive he'll be coming for us soon enough.

Cheza:
Yes.

Blue:
But until then, I'll be here to protect you.

Cheza:
Hige. You have faith in him, do you not, Blue?

Blue:
Why would you think that?
Faith in that sexist jerk? Gimme a break...
Hey, Cheza. This "Paradise" place, what's it really like?

Cheza:
This one does not know.

Blue:
Oh. Well, I guess we'll find out when we get there.

Hige:
Looks like they're at it again. What's the plan?

Tsume:
Well, one thing's for sure, we're never gonna get anywhere if we keep attacking them one by one like we have been.

Kiba:
I know.
It's time we headed for Jaguara's keep.
No more distractions.

Hubb:
Cher.

Cher:
What?

Hubb:
It's alright. I'm with you now.
Ow!
Why do things always work out this way?
It figures the first chance I get to have you all to myself is with my hands tied in the back of a truck.
That reminds me. I heard some interesting news during my interrogation.
Thanks to the House of Lords, you and I aren't exes anymore.

Cher:
What are you talking about?

Hubb:
Apparently all the documentation that proved we were ever married has been destroyed.
Which would mean of course that our divorce never happened, either.
It's one of those happy stories that almost makes you sad too.
Damn it!
Hold still!

Cher:
Hey, Hubb. When I get home, I want to bake some bread.
If the two of us ever get out of this alive, let's go away. Find a place where no one knows us.

Hubb:
We can build a house by the sea, with a red roof and a garden out back.
We'll grow giant tomatoes and every kind of herb...
And a dog! We'll get a dog!
And then...
After a while...let's have some kids.
A girl would be nice.
With your maternal instincts, I bet you'll make a terrific mother.
And after that...
We can all...
Is that what you really want?

Cher:
That's all over now.
At this point, it doesn't really matter what I want any more.

Hubb:
Don't you lie to me, Cher. It isn't over, and you know it.
Why would you make all those sacrifices if you weren't going to see it through to the end? You can't give up now.
It'll be alright. I'm gonna protect you.
That's why I came. I threw away everything I had for this.
None of it mattered to me. The only thing I ever cared about was you.

Cher:
Hubb...
Are you alright?

Hubb:
Yeah, more or less.

Cher:
Those are Lord Orkham's troops.

Hubb:
Whoever they are, this is our chance.

Cher:
You're right. Let's take it.
We have to find Cheza.

Hubb:
Cher.
This tingling again...
This way!

Cher:
That's way too convenient.
Cheza!

Hubb:
Isn't that Quent's...?
We'll get you out.

Blue:
They've gotta get away from here.

Cher:
Hubb, move!

Blue:
Cheza!

Cher:
Hubb!

Why are you doing this?
What's the point? Orkham and Darcia are both gone.

Commander:
Yes, I know.
But everybody has their own way of surviving, and this happens to be mine.
I guess I'm just a fool of a man who can only maintain his pride through fighting.

Cher: 
Your pride...

Commander:
We met those wolves when Jaguara attacked us.
Wolves that have survived by casting a spell over humans...
I had always believed it was nothing more than the ramblings of some dreamer.
I never thought it would be true...
They were all trying to find the Flower Maiden.

Cher:
The wolves will seek out the girl created from Lunar Flowers.
Everything is happening exactly as it was written in the Book of the Moon.

Commander:
While none of us were looking, I guess somehow we all got mixed up in a world of legend and fairy tales.
How about we give you a lift to the nearest city?

Cher:
Thanks, but no.
Would you mind if we took that?

Commander:
Suit yourself.
So what now? Where are you gonna go?

Cher:
We're heading south, straight for Jaguara's keep.
I'm looking for something too, and I think it might be there.

Commander:
I understand.

Cher:
What about you?

Commander:
Us? We're going to Freeze City.

Soldier:
But sir, Jaguara's troops have taken over the whole area!

Commander:
This may prove to be the one battle that determines our fate as men.
That's why I'll fight, not for the glory of the Nobles.
But for the honour of protecting our very existence.
We'll stand together, and we'll fight to save what is ours.

Soldier:
Sir! The troops are ready, and await your command!

Commander:
Good. You may give the order to move out!

Soldier:
Yes, sir!

Blue:
I'll leave the driving to you.

Tsume:
What is it?

Kiba:
No doubt about it...
Let's go!

-Ending-

Cher:
I can't remember the last time I was behind the wheel.
It's a good thing I've still got my license.
Anyway, I've always been an excellent driver.
Wha...? Wait a minute! This car isn't an automatic?
Who in the world drives a stick anymore?
