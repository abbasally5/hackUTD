  Kiba:
They say there's no such place as Paradise.
Even if you searched to the ends of the Earth, there's nothing there.
No matter how far you walk, it's always the same road.
It just goes on and on.
But in spite of that, why am I so driven to find it?
A voice calls to me, it says: “Search for Paradise”

Tsume:
Let's go.

Boy:
Hurry up!
Dumbass!

Gehl:
Tsume...

Man:
That's a Noble's ship...

Tsume:
I hate that sound.



Quent:
Vodka.
I tell ya, this lousy city isn't fit for a dog, much less a man.
Never thought it'd be so cold inside a dome.

Bartender:
Well, I don't know where you're from, mister, but I doubt there's anywhere fit to live these days.

Quent:
Always helps to have a friend when you're crossing the mountains.
Never know what you might run into.
Like bears...
... Or wolves.

Bartender:
Wolves?
Now there's something I haven't heard about in a long time.
Not since my grandpa was alive.
He always used to tell me, when the world finally comes to an end, Paradise will appear on the Earth.
But the trouble is that only wolves would know where to find it.
Who knows?
Maybe the world is coming to an end right now...

Quent:
Wolves are only servants of death!
Don't you believe all that pagan garbage!

Bartender:
Relax, old man.
Wolves have been extinct for 200 years.
It's just a kid's fairy tale.

Quent:
The thing about fairy tales is there's always some truth in 'em.
What! What is it, Blue!
Did you see one?!

Chen:
Hey, Tsume!
Where's the fire?
Can't we slow down a little?
There's nobody following us.

Tsume:
I know.

Sedo:
Haven't we gotten enough already?
I'm mean, there's plenty to go around.

Tsume:
The provisions for the Nobles are going to be passing through the checkpoint tomorrow.

Gehl:
We're gonna hit 'em again?

Tsume:
Chen, Sedo, you're in the advance squad.

Chen:
Why doesn't that surprise me?

Gehl:
Yeah, but we messed it up bad there last week.
Security's gonna to be even tighter now.
We lost two of us today as it is.

Tsume:
Gehl, you're on standby.
Anyone who isn't willing to fight should get out now.

Tsume:
What is it?

Man:
It's a dog.
But I don't think it's gonna make it.
Maybe it's worth something.
Maybe we can eat it.
I've never seen a dog this big. The sucker's huge.

Tsume:
That is not a dog.
Pull it out.

Man:
Okay...

Tsume:
How interesting...

Tsume:
That was quite a stunt.

Kiba:
I was protecting myself, that's all.

Tsume:
Don't be so quick to kill.

Kiba:
What's wrong with killing?

Tsume:
I don't know what mountain you came down from, but you're in the city now.
There are rules.

Kiba:
Rules?
Is running around this city with a pack of idiots one of the rules?

Tsume:
I'm only using 'em.

Kiba:
Your rules stink like this city.
What's the point of living if it means throwing away your pride?

Tsume:
You've got a big mouth for someone half dead.

Gehl:
Are you okay, Tsume?
Hey, you're bleeding.

Tsume:
Don't touch me!
And stay out of my business.

Gehl:
I wanted to thank you.
You saved my life back there.
I always thought maybe you didn't care if one of your friends got killed.
I guess I thought maybe I'd never be one of your friends.

Tsume:
We're not friends.
It's just... I'm not like you people.

Cher?:
I've never seen this expression on her face before.
Has the solution been altered?

Researcher A:
No, it's the same as always.

Researcher B:
Do you think she's awakened?

Cher:
According to the data we found, the first thing Cheza showed a response to was blood, wasn't it?

Researcher B:
Wolf's blood, you mean?

Cher:
Yes. The smell of wolf's blood.

Researcher A:
But, what evidence is there that...

Cher:
None.
Many things exist that can't be explained by scientific proof simply due to a lack of evidence.
Cheza herself is the crowning achievement of an alchemy that cannot be proved.
The Flower Maiden and the wolves are being drawn to one another.
Like an ancient scholar's fairy tale.

Hubb:
Quent Yaiden.
So tell me, what bring the sheriff of Kyrios to our humble city?
That's some heavy artillery you've got there.
But I doubt you came all this way for the hunting.

Quent:
What did you do with it?
Where's the animal I put down?

Hubb:
Dead, apparently.
The carcass will be disposed of here.

Quent:
That's impossible!
There's not a chance in Hell that thing is dead!
I have to see it with my own eyes.
Don't you get it, it's a wolf!

Hubb:
You think it's a wolf?

Quent:
It may look like a dog, but it's not.
It's a wolf!
You don't honestly believe that we wiped those things from the face of the planet, do you, detective?

Hubb:
The last appearance of a wolf was over 200 years ago.
Just how do you suppose they survived all this time?
The mountains and forests have been stripped bare.
There's nowhere on Earth they could live or hide.

Quent:
There's all around us!
They've just put us all under some kind of spell!
These wolves exist and we have to destroy them all!

Hubb:
I figured this kind of thing might be under your jurisdiction.

Cher:
So it's alive?

Hubb:
Just barely.
But it's only a matter of time.

Cher:
That sounds like the two of us.

Hubb:
We're not over yet.
All we have to do is keep trying.

Cher:
I'm not so sure.

Hubb:
Hey, what are you doing?
What department are you with?

Hige:
Oh, sorry.
I was looking for cleaning supplies, I guess I must have got lost.

Hubb:
The cleaning crew, huh?
Just go out that door, supplies are on the right.

Hige:
Oh, are they?
Thanks.

Hubb:
So, do you think it's really a wolf?

Cher:
I don't know.
I've never seen a real one before.
But if it is a wolf, it may be what's causing the sudden reaction in Cheza.

Hubb:
Oh please.
Not Cheza again.

Cher:
What's that mean?

Hubb:
It's because of her you and I broke up.

Cher:
Stop acting like an idiot, Hubb, and bring this up to the lab.

Hubb:
I'll have someone do it later.
Dogs and I don't get along all that well.
I'm kind of allergic to them.

Cher:
This is the reason you and I would never work.

Hubb:
I don't know, maybe it is just a matter of time.

Gehl:
I'm coming with you guys.
I wanna fight.
I can help you.
Just tell me what to do.
Hige:
Man, you really screwed up.
I mean, I've seen one of us get caught before, but never this badly.

Kiba:
I can get out of here whenever I feel like it.

Hige:
Uh-huh.
So then why are you in there?

Kiba:
I just needed a place to rest for a while, that's all.

Hige:
I'm Hige, it's nice to meet ya.

Kiba:
So why are you in here, anyway?

Hige:
No reason.
It smelled like something interesting was going to happen and I just followed my nose, ya know?
Besides, I've got nowhere else to go.

Kiba:
That's not your true form.
Why do you hide yourself?

Hige:
So I don't end up where you are.
These people are terrified of us, so, you know, if we look like them, they pretty much leave us alone.

Kiba:
You're living a lie, just so you can die a miserable death in this city?

Hige:
Gotta do what you can to survive, right?
Keep looking like that, and you'll be back here in no time.
It draws too much attention.

Kiba:
Have you given up your pride as a wolf?

Hige:
You're a strange one, alright.
But having pride doesn't count for much if you're dead.
Ya know?

Gehl:
Tsume!

Man:
Sir! That big dog, it disappeared!

Hubb:
What?!

Hubb:
It's gone...
You think someone stole it?

Cher:
Could be.
Or maybe it escaped on its own.

Hige:
Your wounds, have they healed?

Kiba:
Yeah.
After all, it's a full moon tonight.

Hige:
So why'd you come to this crummy town, anyway?

Kiba:
I smelled something.
The scent of Lunar Flower.
It's here, in this city.

Hige:
Yeah, I know.
My nose can tell when a dog's taking a dump 10 kilometres away.

Kiba:
Yeah?
That must really stink.

Hige:
Sure does.

Kiba:
So why did you escape with me?

Hige:
Oh, I don't know.
I just felt like it, I guess.
Besides, you seem kind of interesting.
So, what's next?
Where are you headed?

Kiba:
To Paradise.
There isn't any moonlight in this place.

Hige:
Paradise, huh?
That sounds like fun.

Kiba:
My name is... Kiba.


City of Howls


Next Time
I met the cutest girl by that garbage dump by the alley.
She gave me food and everything.
She's so nice. Really nice.
Oh wait, you don't know me yet, do you?
Just watch the next episode, you'll see.
