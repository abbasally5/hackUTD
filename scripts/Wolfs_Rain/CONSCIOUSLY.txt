  Cheza:
Kiba!

Kiba: 
Who's there?

Tsume:
Kiba!

Hige:
Kiba!

Toboe:
Kiba!

Kiba:
Who's there? Where are you? I can't see.

Owl:
Who are you? Where are you?
I don't know!

-Opening-

Iyek:
Beyond those rocks is a land called the Desert's Bones.

Tsume:
The Desert's Bones?

Iyek:
If your friend really did go in there, looking for him won't do any good.
Why don't all of you stay here and live with us?

Tsume:
I'm afraid we can't do that.
You see, our friend is the one who was looking for Paradise.
See you around. Let's go.

Toboe:
I'm...not going.
I...
I want to stay here!

Tsume:
You're gonna stay here, huh? So does that mean you don't want to be with us anymore?

Toboe:
Yeah.
There's something about this place...how Iyek and his people live, that's Paradise to me.

Tsume:
Are you sure? Toboe, is this what you want?
Well, if that's really what you've decided, then it's okay by me, kid.

Hige:
Hey!

Tsume:
Take care of yourself.
Since the day I met him, that kid's wanted to be with humans.

Hige:
Tsume?

Tsume:
The runt's always had a soft spot for 'em.

Hige:
I guess that was pretty obvious.

Tsume:
Didn't you say you'd given up on Paradise, too?
Don't feel like you have to tag along for my sake.

Hige:
You'd keep going? Even if you had to do it alone?

Tsume:
I want to see it for myself.
If wolves really do cause the world to end, then I want to be there when it happens.
Besides, there's no way I'm giving up now, not after spending time with that pig-headed jerk.
So I'm gonna look for him.

Hige:
Hey, Tsume, when did you start talking like that?
You sound like him.

Mew:
Kiba, what's wrong?

Kiba:
I can't remember.
I've been hearing all these different voices...
But I can't remember who they belong to.
I feel like I should know them, but I can't see their faces.

Mew:
Your memory fades, little by little.
And then you get used to it.

Owl:
Yes, little by little.
And little by little still...
Then, little by little...

Mew:
Don't worry, Kiba. I'm with you. I'll always be with you.

Kiba:
Sure.

Owl:
Where are you? Who are you?
Whether alive or whether you're dead...
There is nothing, nothing matters...
The answers are buried beneath the sand...

Granny:
Toboe.
Toboe.
That's my good boy. Are you ready to eat?
Now, now, calm down! Stop that!
Toboe, please... I can't breathe...

Horse:
Are you sure?

Toboe:
Oh, it's you.

Horse:
About not going to Paradise, I mean?

Toboe:
I'm sure. I don't really have what it takes.

Horse:
Does anyone ever really have what it takes?

Toboe:
It's no wonder they all think I'm a coward. Not that it matters any.
I'm sure Kiba will be alright, and it's not like I have to worry about Tsume or Hige.
I mean, all I ever did was hold them back.
They don't need that.
If I'm here, I won't get in their way.

Hige:
Man, talk about a wasteland.

Tsume:
Is that it?

Hige:
It's those guys!

Toboe:
Oh, no!

Iyek:
Do you sense something?

Toboe:
It's coming from where Tsume and Hige went! Something is definitely wrong!
I think it might be them.

Iyek:
You mean the people who attacked the dogs?

Toboe:
And attacked us, too.

Tsume:
The way they're coming, it's almost like they can track our moves before we make them!

Hige:
Which means it's kinda pointless to run and hide.

Toboe:
Kiba!

Iyek:
Stay back!
Don't get any closer!
The poison from that grass has paralysed him.

Toboe:
But he can't be! He can't!

Tsume:
He isn't dead!

Hige:
Maybe not yet, but if we don't pull him out of there, he's gonna...

Iyek:
Your friend's spirit has been taken.
I'm sure the Elder can call it back.

Toboe:
Hurry!

Mew:
Stop it...

Kiba:
Why, Mew? What's wrong?

Mew:
It looks like someone's found you.

Kiba:
What do you mean?

Mew:
I wanted to be with you forever.
But now, I know you shouldn't stay.
You're right. This place, it isn't Paradise at all.
It's a world where time no longer exists.
Eventually, you won't remember anything, or even why you're here.
You'll forget, just like I have.

Kiba:
Why are you doing this?

Mew:
Kiba, you have to go.

Kiba:
No, wait! Come with me.
Mew...

Mew:
You and I are more different than you realise.

Kiba:
Mew!

Mew:
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Kiba.

Cheza:
Kiba?
Kiba?
Do you know who this one is?
Kiba, remember.

Kiba:
Cheza.

Toboe:
Kiba?

Hige:
Remember us?

Toboe:
Kiba...
Kiba!

Kiba:
Hey, guys. Long time no see.

Hige:
I suppose you think that's funny, huh?

Toboe:
You scared us half to death! Where have you been?

Kiba:
Someplace peaceful...
It was almost like Paradise...

Tsume:
But it wasn't, right?

Kiba:
No...
They kicked me out.

Elder:
Do not worry. Your friend has returned to you.

Tsume:
We should leave once Kiba's back on his feet.

Hige:
What do you wanna do, runt?

Tsume:
No matter how hard you try to hide, at some point, you'll have to fight.
Like it or not, that's just the way it is.

Toboe:
I know. I know that...

Tsume:
You okay now?

Kiba:
Yeah. Guess I overslept.
I feel like I've been dreaming for a really long time.
A strange and wonderful dream.

Elder:
What your spirit beheld was the Garden of Eternity.

Kiba:
Garden of Eternity?

Elder:
You experienced joy and tranquillity unlike any you've known before, yes?

Kiba:
Yeah...

Elder:
That is enough to satisfy most people.
They embrace the illusion, and never look back.
But for you, that bliss was not enough. Or you wouldn't have returned.

Kiba:
Yes. There's somewhere else I need to go.

Elder:
Tell me. Why are you searching for Paradise?

Kiba:
I have to, to survive.

Elder:
I see.

Tsume:
So what happened to you in that garden place?

Kiba:
Nothing.
Except... I met a nice girl.

Hige:
You? Met a girl? No way!

Tsume:
I should have guessed. No wonder you seem less uptight.

Toboe:
Wait, I don't get it.

Tsume:
And you won't for a few years.

Hige:
Aw man, Kiba has all the luck.

Toboe:
But why can't I get it now?

Kiba:
When I was there, the whole time, it felt like I was forgetting something.

Tsume:
You mean Cheza?

Kiba:
Not just her. I mean you guys.
I thought you were dead.

Hige:
You've gotta be kidding!
Do you have any idea how hard we busted our butts trying to find you?

Kiba:
Oh, you did? Sorry, I didn't know.

Hige:
That brain of yours is never gonna change, is it?

Kiba:
Let's go.

Toboe:
I...
I...
I'm not gonna whine anymore.
And I won't run away.

Hige:
Wanna bet?

Toboe:
No way.

Tsume:
Ready? The kid sure is.

Kiba:
Yeah.

Iyek:
Is Paradise far from here?

Kiba:
I don't know.
But there's no doubt in my mind we're gonna find it.

Toboe:
Do you think it's okay, that we're trying to get there?

Iyek:
Take comfort in knowing that the spirits are with you.

Kiba:
See you.

Iyek:
Sure.

Tsume:
Let's go.

Hige:
Later.

Toboe:
Well, I guess this is goodbye.

Horse:
You've got what it takes to get to Paradise, and then some.

Toboe:
Thanks a lot.
Iyek...
There's something I need you to do for me.
He's got my scent on him, so he shouldn't be too hard to find.

Quent:
Ah, shut up...
No matter where I am, it's the same damn snow...
Oh well. Death will be here soon enough...
When he comes for me, I'll see Ruus again.
Who are you?

Iyek:
You chugged all of my restorative potion...

Quent:
To me, it was the water of life...
I'm back from the grave...

Iyek:
I was asked as a favour to rescue you.

Quent:
To rescue me?

Iyek:
Yeah. Asked by a wolf.

Quent:
Yeah, right, pal. Not likely.

Iyek:
Why? Don't you believe in wolves?

Quent:
I believe in 'em, alright.
I believe they're servants of the devil.

Iyek:
Here's some food.
I'll keep my promise to help you, regardless of what kind of man you are.

Quent:
Why in the hell would they want to show me pity at this point?
Gimme a freakin' break...

-Ending-

Tsume:
Why are all these idiots going soft over a bunch of women?
We men have our own world.
A world of blood and grease and gunpowder that reeks of sweat.
On second thought, I'll take the one with the women.
