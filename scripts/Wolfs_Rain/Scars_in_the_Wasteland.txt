  -Opening-

Toboe:
Oh, man. I sure am hungry...

Hige:
Yeah, you could say that again.

Toboe:
How long has it been since we ate anything?

Hige:
I don't know... I guess it's been about three days, or so.

Toboe:
We've gone that long without eating?

Hige:
Yeah, not a bite.

Toboe:
How much longer before we get any food?

Hige:
I have no idea... Another three days, I guess.

Tsume:
Will you two quit your whining already?
It's only been three stupid days.

Toboe:
Yeah, but if we hadn't left the city, we would have something to eat right now.

Kiba:
We can last a lot longer if we bask in the moonlight.
I travelled a full month once, and I did that.

Hige:
Did you say a month?!

Kiba:
It should stop snowing any time now. Once it does, and night draws closer, the moon will be out.

Tsume:
Well, if worse comes to the worse, we can always eat each other.
We could start with the runt, since he's gotten so weak, and of course, there's always little Porky over there.

Toboe:
Wait a second, how come Kiba isn't on the menu?

Tsume:
Because the guy's totally full of crap, that's why.

Toboe:
Come on, cut it out!
You don't mean it. You're just saying stuff like that 'cause you're hungry!

I wonder where it came from? I mean it's all by itself out here.

Tsume:
You're gonna eat that?

Hige:
Yeah, aren't you gonna?

Toboe:
You know what, this tastes pretty good. It's only a little bit tougher than hamburger.
Hey! C'mon, Tsume, have some!
We still have a long way we have to go.

Tsume:
Go? Go where, exactly?
To that "Paradise" place? Off in the direction you smell the flower?

Toboe:
Tsume...
Come on, Kiba, tell us. What's Paradise really like?

Hige:
It's an amazing place.
The flowers are always in bloom, and there's food everywhere!
Oh, and there's beautiful babes all over the place.

Toboe:
You mean it?

Hige:
Of course there are!
I hope so, anyway.

Toboe:
You don't know...

Tsume:
Paradise is just a totally unfounded fairy tale.
And if it isn't, then it's probably just some idiot's dream.

Hige:
So then why the hell did you come with us?

Toboe:
We'll never know unless we look for it!

Tsume:
How far are you gonna let this guy string you along?
How far are you gonna follow this guy in pursuit of a place that doesn't even exist to begin with?
That's it. I can't put up with you losers anymore.

Toboe:
Tsume!

Hige:
Hey, where'd you think you're going all by yourself?

Tsume:
To look for Hell, I guess.

Kiba:
Suit yourself.

Toboe:
Kiba.

Kiba:
But remember, that set of rules you have doesn't apply way out here.

Tsume:
It really pisses me off when a smug kid like you has that know-it-all look on his face, and he's actually clueless.

Toboe:
Tsume! Come on, don't leave now! We finally made some friends!

Tsume:
Play with your buddies all you want. I'm outta here.

Hige:
If you ask me, the only one who's acting like a kid around here is him.

Toboe:
Don't say that. I like Tsume, he's really nice.
Just wait here. I'm gonna go get him!
Hey! Wait for me, Tsume!
What are you so mad about, huh? C'mon, come back and join us, okay?

Tsume:
Shut the hell up.

Toboe:
You know it's dangerous to move around alone.

Tsume:
It doesn't matter, does it? We're always alone.

Toboe:
But, wait, I...

Tsume:
Stop bothering me!
And don't follow me.

Toboe:
Tsume!
Tsume!
Tsume?
Tsume!
Hey! Tsume!

Tsume!
Tsume!
Hey! Tsume!

Hubb:
He came this close to shooting the guy right in front of me!

Cher:
Keep your voice down.

Hubb:
That man is unbelievable.
He's convinced that those boys are wolves, and nothing on this earth is gonna change his mind.

Cher:
Listen, Hubb, there's something I need you to do for me.
If it's not too much trouble, could you water the plants in my apartment while I'm gone?

Hubb:
Gone? What do you mean?

Cher:
I'm taking a little vacation. I'll be gone for a while.

Hubb:
Vacation? Wait a minute, what's going on? I thought you said you were feeling better.

Cher:
That's why I'm taking a vacation.

Hubb:
I don't understand. What about... You know?
That thing you've sacrificed your whole life for, including us.

Cher:
It doesn't really matter whether I'm here or not. Nothing's ever gonna change.
Certainly not the lab, or even the world.

Hubb:
What are you saying?

Cher:
All this work I've been doing... I mean, seriously, what's the point?
I feel like everything around me is an illusion.
I just...don't know what's real anymore, Hubb.
So much for light conversation.

Hubb:
You know, wolves may actually exist.

Cher:
But Hubb.

Hubb:
Listen to me, that dog we saw was not...

Cher:
Stop it, Hubb.

Hubb:
Just hear me out. I think there may be more of them, Cher.

Cher:
Okay, give it a rest. I don't want to think about it right now.
I'm going.

Hubb:
You're going now?

Cher:
Thanks for dinner.

Hubb:
Huh? Cher! Wait! Wait a minute!

Toboe:
Are you okay?

Tsume:
Stay away!

We're gonna have to jump!

Toboe:
But...
What the heck is that thing?

Tsume:
How should I know?

Toboe:
Tsume...

Tsume:
Damn it... The stench of this place is starting to make me sick.

Hige:
You know, I was thinking, we should go ahead and ditch that guy.
I mean, it's not like he has to tag along with us or anything.
It was happenstance that threw us together, and they just ended up with us, that's all.

Kiba:
The same goes for you.

Hige:
I don't know, that Tsume guy's been giving me a real dangerous vibe from the start.

Kiba:
He's just different from us, that's all.
He's always had someone else to blame.
It's pretty darn lucky, if you ask me. Give him a break, he'll come around.

Hige:
Okay, so what the hell is up with you anyway?
I mean, you're always talking like you got an answer for just about everything.
What happened to you before all this?

Kiba:
Nothing much. Nothing much at all.

Hige:
Hey...
Hey, Kiba. Do you smell that?
What's that?
Maybe there used to be a military base around here.
Hey, Kiba! Wait!
What a drag. Whatever.

Tsume:
Stop that! Don't ever touch me!
What's it doing?

Toboe:
It's not after us. Looks like we gave it the slip.
You're covered in scars.
That one, there on your chest... Man, it's really cool!
I wonder what happened to Kiba and Hige?
I bet they're pretty worried about us by now.

Tsume:
I don't trust anyone.
And because of that, no one has to trust me.
That way, it keeps things nice and simple.

Toboe:
I don't care. I still like you anyway, Tsume.

Tsume:
Ah, damn!

Toboe: 
Forget about it, Tsume! You'll get yourself killed!

Tsume:
Well, at least then you'll finally have something to eat.

Toboe:
Don't be stupid!
I'll act as a decoy and distract him so you can get away!

Tsume:
Don't do it!

Toboe:
You can trust me, it's okay.

Hige:
Tsume! This way!

Hubb:
One of the plants? She doesn't have any.

Hige:
Hey, you okay?

Kiba:
It's only a scratch.

Hige:
Yeah, right. Ever since I met you guys, nothing but trouble.

Toboe:
I knew it. Well, I wasn't sure, but...I had a feeling that you guys would come for us...

Hige:
Well, don't get too used to it, kid.

Tsume:
I didn't ask for help.
Why would you do that? Risk your life for me?
And don't try telling me that it's because we're friends.

Kiba:
That's easy. It was just instinct.

-Ending-

Hige: 
It's really a drag being hungry all the time, you know? I mean, it's a crappy way to live.
A man needs adventure and romance in his life!
And this is one man who lives for love.
