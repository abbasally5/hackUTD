  Cher:
It's Jaguara's troops...

-Opening-

Hubb:
Are you crazy? I can't afford that much!
Hey, wait a minute!

Quent:
Not very good at haggling, are you?

Hubb:
Well, then help me out here!

Quent:
It wasn't my car that broke down now, was it?

Hubb:
You're gonna ride in it, aren't you?
You want that much for this?

Mechanic:
Believe me, pal, you won't find a better car in this village.

Hubb:
Why do I feel like I'm being screwed?

Mechanic:
Tell you what. If you want, I can fill her up with enough gas to get you to the next town.

Hubb:
For how much?

Mechanic:
Boy, you catch on quick.

Hubb:
Terrific. Now I'm broke.

Quent:
Look on the bright side. At least you got a car that works.

Hubb:
Assuming it does.

Toboe:
They went that way, right?

Hige:
They sure did.

Toboe:
Are we going?

Hige:
Well, yeah, we have to.

Blue:
So where are you guys headed?

Hige:
We're all trying to make our way to Paradise.

Blue:
Paradise?

Hige:
It's something every wolf has to try to do.

Blue:
Oh, right. To find Paradise.

Hige:
You're gonna come with us, aren't you, Blue?

Blue:
It sounds tempting, but I can't go.

Hige:
Well, then I'm not going either.

Blue:
Hige...

Kiba:
You know, you'd probably be better off, if you stayed with the humans.
It's not too late to go back.

Hige:
What the hell are you saying, Kiba?

Blue:
I have no intention of going back.
I can never return to the way I was before, not now.

Hige:
Blue...

Blue:
I just... I need to find out what I really am.

Kiba:
Well, then the only thing you can do is move forward.

Hige:
Yeah, he's right! You just gotta move forward! Right? Right?

Tsume:
Oh yeah, I can see right through you, Porky.

Toboe:
Now if only Cheza were with us...
Ow!

Hige:
I told you not to say that!
Okay! Now that everything's settled, time to get a move on!
Onto Paradise!

Kiba:
We're going this way.

Toboe:
Paradise isn't over there.

Kiba:
But Darcia's keep is.

Hige:
His keep?

Kiba:
Yeah.

Toboe:
Do you think... Cheza's there?

Tsume:
Kiba, Cheza left us of her own free will, you know.

Kiba:
She only did that to protect us.
She's waiting for us. I know she is.

Tsume:
That Noble will be there too.

Kiba:
I wouldn't doubt it.

Tsume:
We all might get killed this time.

Kiba:
If it we're meant to die, then so be it.

Tsume:
When that happens, you'll be on your own.

Toboe:
So we're going? To find Cheza, right?

Hige:
Right. Let's go!
C'mon!

Quent:
You're gonna give yourself wrinkles if you keep that up, loverboy.

Hubb:
My head is killing me. I usually don't drink that much.
Well, you're certainly in a good mood.

Quent:
Come on, don't you think it's hilarious?

Hubb:
What is?

Quent:
Here I am tracking a pack of wolves, and here you are chasing a fox.
We make one hell of a team.
What's funny is you're the one who's afraid. You're scared to find her.

Hubb:
Would you please get off me!

Quent:
"Please get off"?
Excuse me, my chickadee.
That's right. Women always run when you chase 'em.
It's been that way since the dawn of time.

Hubb:
How about you drive for a while? We've got a ways to go.
So we'll take turns behind the wheel.

Quent:
What the hell kinda dumb thing is that for a cop to say?
You're gonna let a drunken man drive?

Hubb:
So how about now?

Quent:
You're out of your mind...

Hubb:
And you're forgetting that I'm not just a cop. I'm also a wanted fugitive.

Quent:
Fine, whatever. See if I care.

Hubb:
Here.

Quent:
What is it?

Hubb:
Swallow it. It's a sobriety pill.

Quent:
You're kidding.

Hubb:
It breaks down the alcohol in your system.
And it starts working almost immediately.
It has a few side-effects, but nothing to worry about.
They'll let you drive with a clear head.

Quent:
Why the hell should I take this thing when I got a perfectly good buzz going?
It's a damn waste...

Hubb:
Would you prefer if I left you here?

Quent:
You've had enough.

Hubb:
Careful. Now just keep your eyes on the road.
An attentive driver never regrets the accident he avoids.

Quent:
Do you always have to talk like a cop?

Hubb:
You're on the force too, I recall.
For crying out loud, what would make a man like you want to become a sheriff?

Quent:
Alright, then. What made you become a cop?

Hubb:
My folks. Like a good little boy, I did what I was told, that's all.

Quent:
Daddy's little trooper, huh?
Come on... Leave some for me, will you?

Hubb:
My parents used to gang up and lecture me.
"Now Hubb, don't go getting into trouble. There are rules in this world".
"Stick to the rules. You can never go wrong".
You think that's funny?
Nothing was ever funny to me.
I did exactly what they said and followed every rule in the book.
But I still...

Quent:
Don't chug it!

Hubb:
When did I take a wrong turn?
Where the hell did I go wrong?

Quent:
So, that include your marriage?

Hubb:
What?

Quent:
Was getting married your parents' idea too?

Hubb:
No, Cher and i were... Well, we first met through a friend of mine.
It was love at first sight.

Quent:
You haven't done anything wrong.
And despite your concerted efforts, believe me, you ain't such a good little boy.
Didn't you say something about there being side effects to that thing?
I'm pissing a freaking river here.

I can't see a thing, damn it...
Can't hear, either. What a night...
Blue!

Hubb:
What's the matter?

Quent:
Forget it, it was nothing.

Hubb:
Damn you!
You bastards!

Quent:
Why the hell are you so frustrated?

Hubb:
Can't you see what's going on?
Somewhere out there I don't know, something's happening.

Quent:
You may think that something unknown is just playing games with you.
That you're the only one who's being kept out of the loop.
Trust me, that's not the case.
All you're doing...is watching the scenery go by.

Hubb:
Cher...
You're so beautiful.

Cher:
Sleep-head...
Time to wake up.
Hey, Hubb.
Wake up...

Quent:
There's drool on your chin.
You've been smiling since you fell asleep.
That must've been one hell of a good dream.

Hubb:
No. It was just another sad one.

Quent:
It's your turn to take the wheel.

Hubb:
It was two years after we were married.
Cher got a scouting offer from the Noble's science division. To head up their new research lab.

Cher:
So Hubb, what do you think?

Hubb:
I don't know. I've never really understood how the professional world works.
How do you feel about it? You want it, don't you?

Cher:
Yes... It's a big opportunity.
And where I am now, I'm already seeing the limits of my research...
Besides...
I could use a change. Maybe it would get me out of the rut I've been in lately.

Hubb:
You? In a rut? If you are, then it's news to me.
Cher, you're more alive than anyone I know.

Cher:
Do you think so?

Hubb:
'Course I do.

Cher:
I guess I've never really given it much thought, you know?
About my life and what I want to do.
Hubb, what about you?

Hubb:
You mean, what do I want?
Look, just do whatever you want to do, Cher.
I'll be here, whatever you decide.
Gradually she became more and more absorbed in her research.

Quent:
And like two ships that pass in the night, you got a divorce.
Talk about cliche...
Why couldn't you stop it?

Hubb:
Cheza.
After a while, that was all she could talk about.
Night and day, it was Cheza, Cheza, Cheza.

Quent:
"Cheza"? What the hell is that?

Hubb:
An entity.
An original life form created by highly advanced biotechnology.

Quent:
What do you mean?

Hubb:
Well, from what she told me, she was working on a research organism that could adapt to and survive in any given environment.
It was something about it being created by weaving it from the essence of a special plant.

Quent:
The essence of a plant?

Hubb:
Made into the form of a beautiful girl.
Beautiful, just like a flower.

Quent:
Hey, why'd the car stop? It can't possibly be my turn to drive yet.

Hubb:
Quent, why did the car stop?
What a piece of junk...
Hey, Quent! I could use a little help, you know!

Quent:
The flower maiden and the wolves...
It couldn't be.

Alright, how about we meet back here at nightfall?

Hubb:
Sure. We can decide then whether or not to get a hotel.

Quent:
So what's your plan? How are you gonna find her?

Hubb:
I'll just act like a cop and start walking the beat.

Quent:
Fight hard for her, or you'll always regret what could have been.

Elmira:
Oh, thank you so much. You really helped us out!
Please, could we offer you a cup of coffee?

Quent:
No, that's alright.

Honey:
Now, don't be like that.
If we had a little rum, it'll warm your bones.

Quent:
Well, I guess just one.

Elmira:
So tell us. Where are you headed?

Quent:
Well, actually we only just arrived.

Elmira:
Sorry to disappoint you, but there's not much here.
Why don't you try the castle of the Darcias in the west?
It sits in the middle of a lake, it's quite lovely.

Quent:
I didn't exactly come out here for pleasure.

Honey:
We're off to visit our daughter and that new husband of hers.

Elmira:
But Hon, Jessica isn't... Well, she's gone, dear.

Honey:
I wonder if they've left town already... Those wolves, I mean.

Quent:
The what?

Elmira:
Oh, it's nothing. My husband mistook some boys for wolves.

Honey:
Mistook them?
Don't be silly, Elmira... They were wolves, alright.
In all my years, the first living wolves I've ever met.

Elmira:
Please, dear...

Honey:
And the pretty black one... You could tell how attached to people she was.
It felt as if my own daughter was there at my side.

Quent:
Blue...

Cher:
Hubb!

Hubb:
Cher!

Cher:
What are you... How did you...?

Hubb:
Is this a dream?
I can't tell. I've had so many dreams about you.

Lord Orkham's been killed.

Cher:
Oh.

Hubb: 
On the way into town, I saw a military caravan.
But I don't have the slightest idea where they were headed.
I think something insane is about to happen.

Cher:
No, it's been insane all along.

Hubb:
All along?
Please Cher, I need to know. What are you trying to do?

Cher:
I'm going to Lord Darcia's keep.

Hubb:
Darcia's keep? But why?

Cher:
Because that's where Cheza is.

Hubb:
No, you're wrong.

Cher:
I'm not wrong. I saw her.
But no...

Hubb:
What else did you see? Why won't you look me in the eye?

Cher:
I met him. I met Darcia.
I'm sorry, Hubb.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you came all this way to find me.
But I have to go.

Hubb:
But why, Cher?

Cher:
I don't know why!
It's just...it's something that I have to do.
Please try and understand. I have to find out Cheza's true purpose.
I'm being drawn to something, Hubb, and I need to know what it is.

Hubb:
Alright, then I'll go with you.
Then why in the hell did you leave this thing for me to read?
I'm going with you.

-Ending-

Toboe:
There are times in your life when you shouldn't drink.
At work, and behind the wheel.
Hey, that's a great idea! We should drive there, too!
We can't? What, none of you guys has a license?
