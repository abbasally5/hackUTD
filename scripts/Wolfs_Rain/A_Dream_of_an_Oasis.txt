  Cheza:
Kiba!
Kiba!

-Opening-

Toboe:
He's gone. Why can't we find him?

Hige:
Listen, we looked for him everywhere we could.

Toboe:
But he... he couldn't be.

Hige:
Maybe he is. He might not have made it.
Tsume, where are you going?

Tsume:
To look for him again.

Hige:
What's the point? You won't find anything. I'm telling you, even his scent isn't there.
I give up. It's hopeless.

Tsume:
Give up on what?

Hige:
Paradise. I don't give a damn anymore.

Tsume:
What are you saying?

Hige:
I'm saying count me out.

Toboe:
What? You can't be serious!

Hige:
I was never really interested in going to Paradise in the first place.

Tsume:
Really? And you always seem so happy to be with us.

Hige:
If I'd never met him, none of this would have ever happened to me.

Tsume:
You're right.
If he hadn't shown up in the city, I doubt any of us would have left.
We probably could've spent our whole lives there without too much trouble.

Hige:
Things were a lot easier, that's for sure.

Tsume:
Yeah. Except we were pathetic back there.

Hige:
Well, we're pretty pathetic out here, too.

Toboe:
Come on, cut it out, would you?
Isn't it bad enough that our bodies have been totally wrecked?
Why does everybody have to fight about everything, arguing and stealing from each other all the time?
I mean, it's a big enough world. Why can't we share it?
Wolves and humans, and birds, and flowers...
Living together as equals.
If we all got to Paradise, that's how it would be, wouldn't it?

Tsume:
What is it?

Toboe:
I'm not sure, but it's a familiar scent...

Tsume:
A scent?
It's him again.

Toboe:
His body's almost frozen!

Hige:
Just leave him! It's what he deserves.

Toboe:
How can you say that knowing how important he is to Blue!
If we don't do something, he's gonna die!
We couldn't do anything to save Blue, either, remember?

Tsume:
Would you stop it?
Don't take it out on him.

Hige:
We're looking for Kiba, right? Then let's go.

Tsume:
Toboe?

Toboe:
Why don't you go on ahead? I'll catch up, okay?

Hige:
Don't come crying to me when he wakes up and shoots you.

Tsume:
Hey.

Toboe:
Just go on.

Tsume:
Don't get too involved. He's a human, after all.

Quent:
Oh, Blue...
There you are, my big girl. Blue...
I'm...I'm so sorry...
Ruus!

Kiba:
Who are you?

Mew:
Who am I?
I'm Mew. What's your name?
It doesn't really matter.
This place doesn't care who you are, or where you came from.

Kiba:
What do you mean by that?

Mew:
Can't you tell? In this world, everyone can be free.

Quent:
I should have been in the grave by now.

Hige:
The fact of the matter is, it's useless to keep looking.
I mean, do we go back and search around the fallen keep again, or go past those huge mountains and look for him there?
Either way, we still don't know if he's alive.

Tsume:
I had no idea you were so worried about that "Blue" chick.

Hige:
Hey, what do you mean? I haven't said a word about her.

Tsume:
It's because you haven't said anything. That proves you're worried.

Hige:
It's not like that...

Tsume:
Those are the same guys who brought down Darcia's keep.
Whichever Noble they work for... They're too strong for us to fight.

Hige:
It's Jaguara.

Tsume:
Jaguara?

Hige:
They must be hers. She's the ruling Noble to the south.

Tsume:
How do you know?

Hige:
I just heard the name, is all.

Tsume:
Jaguara... That's what that human said in the last town.
He made it sound like she was collecting wolves.
But why the hell would she want to do that?

Are you one of Jaguara's flunkies?
Why's she after us? What the hell does she want?

Iyek:
Jaguara?

Tsume:
She's capturing wolves, and I want to know why!

Toboe:
What's the deal? Why are you laughing at us?

Iyek:
If you were wolves, you should've just said so in the first place!
That's just great... The Elder's gonna have my hide for this.
Sorry about that.
You see, some of our friends were attacked last night, and we just assumed it was you.

Tsume:
Well, it wasn't.

Iyek:
I know. It couldn't have been wolves.
For one thing, they used guns.
Besides, we of the Hmong tribe believe in wolves.
In their existence, and their spirit.

Toboe:
Believe in us?

Iyek:
Well, here we are.

Toboe:
Everyone lives here? Together, I mean.

Iyek:
Yeah. We travel around as a unit.

Toboe:
Wow...

Iyek:
Is that so unusual?
We live together by treating everything as equally as the next, that's all.
Horses. And dogs. And humans.
So how's he doing?

Girl #1:
He's better now. And he's stopped whimpering.

Girl #2:
He drank a whole bunch of milk a little while ago.

Iyek:
He did?

Tsume:
Is he one of your friends who was attacked?

Iyek:
I don't know if they were poachers or what. They just hurt the dogs and left.
This one kept fighting up until the very end.

Tsume:
We know who might've done this.
That old human.

Toboe:
But he couldn't have. That guy was half-frozen.
Besides, he knows the difference between a wolf and a dog.

Hige:
How come you're trying so hard to protect that geezer?

Toboe:
He was...talking in his sleep.
He said, "Blue, I'm so sorry".

Hige:
Maybe, if they mistook the dogs for wolves...

Tsume:
Jaguara then?

Hige:
She might be killing anything she can get her hands on. Even if it only looks like a wolf.

Tsume:
You mentioned earlier about "believing in wolves". What exactly did you mean by that?

Iyek:
What did I mean? I meant what I said.
Wolves are ancestors of every human being.
Except the Nobles, of course.

Elder:
Iyek.

Iyek:
Yes, Elder.

Elder:
Bring along our guests, won't you?

Kiba:
Don't follow me.

Mew:
But why not?

Kiba:
Aren't you terrified of me?

Mew:
Not a bit.

Kiba:
I'm a wolf, you know.

Mew:
Well, isn't that obvious, silly?

Kiba:
Is this...Paradise?

Mew:
Paradise?

Kiba:
A place where you can be free. I've been searching for it my whole life.

Mew:
If that's what you think it is, then it must be.
This is a Paradise made just for you.
Kiba... Will you stay with me here forever?
If this really is your Paradise, would you stay with me like this?

Kiba:
You and I, we're different species.

Mew:
But I can sense your feelings. And you can sense mine.
Are you scared?

Kiba:
I'm not scared of anything.
Not even the thought of dying scares me.
Since I was born, death's been nipping at my heels.
It was as if my very birth had somehow called it there.

Tribe leader:
Kiba.
A white soul.
Do you wish to speak with me?

Kiba:
Why did I survive? I've asked myself that a hundred times.
There must be some reason for me to be here. What is it?
I keep hearing this voice from deep within me.
It says I can no longer stay here.

Tribe leader:
The time has come for you to set out on a journey.
You did not survive on your own.
The flowers protected you, and the land spared your life.
Listen well to the words of your soul.
Your destiny must lie in a different place than this.

Kiba:
A different place?

Tribe leader:
You must leave this land, and never look back.

Kiba:
I've spent every waking moment searching for it... For where I'm meant to be.
It's so strange.
Being able to talk about everything that's happened to me...
I guess I've never really opened up to anyone before.
Not to my friends. Or even Cheza.
For the first time in my entire life, I'm finally at peace.
It's here. This is Paradise. It must be.

Elder:
Long ago, back when man was still an animal, there were evil monsters who ravished this world.
Mother Earth opened the gates to Paradise and set the wolves upon the land.
The wolves fought bravely against the evil, and vanquished the monsters. To the ignorant man-beasts that remained, they taught many things.
And from part of their own bodies, the wolves created humanity.
This tale has been passed down in our tribe since ancient times.

Toboe:
You mean humans were created from wolves?

Elder:
Yes, little one. Back when the world was young, as you are now.
When the wolves seek out Paradise, this world will come to an end.
Or perhaps the world will end because of their search as they make their way home.
It is unclear which will happen first.
Regardless, when the wolves find it, everything in this world will cease to be.
Who first began this search? Was it you?

Toboe:
Was it my idea? No, sir.

Elder:
Was it you?

Hige:
Not likely.

Elder:
You, then?

Toboe:
So we shouldn't be trying to find Paradise?
I mean if the world ends, what'll happen to everyone?

Elder:
As to that, no one can be certain.
No matter where nature goes, our path is to simply follow.

Toboe:
Iyek.

Tsume:
It's time for us to take off.

Iyek:
Already?

Tsume:
We're looking for a friend of ours.
But we can't seem to pick up his scent.
Do you know what lies beyond those mountains?

Iyek:
A dangerous land. No one goes there.

Tsume:
So it's a place that nobody else would be able to find, huh?

Iyek:
Let's go.
Beyond those rocks is a land called the Desert's Bones.

Tsume:
Why the Desert's Bones?

Iyek:
The earth is so parched, even the sand has left it.
But it is said whoever ventures in experiences true happiness.

Hige:
Why the hell would you find happiness in a desert?

Iyek:
The spirits of the land tell us there's a patch of giant grass that's been growing there for thousands of years. It guides anyone who rests beneath it to the Garden of Eternity.

Hige:
Garden of Eternity?

Toboe:
Do you think that could be Paradise?

Iyek:
I don't know.
No one who's gone there has ever returned, so we don't really know what the place is like.
Why don't all of you stay here and live with our tribe?

Tsume:
I'm afraid we can't do that.
You see, our friend is the one who was looking for Paradise.
See you around. Let's go.

Toboe:
I'm...not going.
I...
I want to stay here!

-Ending-

Quent:
A man needs something to satisfy his soul.
Booze? No, not booze. Love.
No matter how old he gets, a man lives his life in love with love.
Regardless of what reality has to say on the matter...
