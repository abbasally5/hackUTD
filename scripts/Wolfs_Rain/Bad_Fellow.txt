  -Opening-

Darcia:
Wolves?
You have my gratitude. For it was you who woke her.

Kiba:
What?
Who the hell are you?

Darcia:
The Flower Maiden is mine.

Hige:
The Maiden? Is that Cheza?

Tsume:
Cut it out!
Toboe, be quiet!
Just shut up!

Darcia:
We'll meet in Paradise.
If we meet again, that is.

Quent:
Look at this.
Pretty, ain't it? A souvenir from an angry wolf.

Hubb:
You can't prove it was a wolf.

Quent:
Well, there weren't any cats of ferrets around.
There was only a young human.
That beast turned into a little boy right in front of my eyes.
He was just a kid.

Tsume:
Hey.
Hey! Snap out of it, would you?

Toboe:
Is it...? It's gone...
You felt that, didn't you? You heard it, right?
Such a sad voice.

Tsume:
It was a machine, that's all.
Probably the dying sounds of some old robot breaking down.

Hubb:
Can you remember at all what this boy's face looked like?

Quent:
I'm trying to, but for some reason, my memory's a little fuzzy.

Hubb:
Maybe I should come back another time.

Quent:
It'll always be the same. But I'm not drunk yet tonight.

Hubb:
I don't know why I ever thought I could come to you for advice.

Quent:
You're obsessed with the wolves, huh?
You're dying to know everything now, aren't you, Detective?

Hubb:
That dog you shot ran away.

Quent:
What a surprise.

Hubb:
And you think it put some kind of spell on us to escape?

Quent:
You got it.

Hubb:
That just isn't possible.

Quent:
These claw marks and the fact that you're here should be proof enough for anyone.
There are a lot more of them, you know.
People you pass every day on the street or the market, the poor slob sitting next to you in the bar...
Any one of 'em could be a wolf.
"I tell you now the words of Red Moon.
From the Great Spirit was born a wolf, and man became its messenger".
In other words, the human race was created from wolves.
So says the author of the Book of the Moon.

Hubb:
"Book of the Moon"?

Quent:
I guess I might as well say it.
Instead of looking for wolves, you oughta start suspecting humans.

Hubb:
I gotta go.

Hige:
Where the hell are we going?
Places like this are rough on my delicate nose, you know.

Kiba:
I got a hunch there's food down here.

Hige:
Huh?

Kiba:
Just a hunch.

Hige:
Looks like that guy stole the only clue we had.
And the scent of Lunar Flowers is gone now, too.

Kiba:
Hige, he knew about Paradise. That's why he took her.

Hige:
Well, we'll just have to find another flower.
She can't be the only one around, right?

Kiba:
That man knew us.
He saw what we are the minute he looked at us.

Hige:
Why don't we blow this town? C'mon, let's look for Paradise.

Kiba:
He'll meet us there. That's what he said.

Hige:
He said a lot of crazy stuff.
Listen, if you're thinking of going after him, you're out of your mind.
He's a Noble, if I've ever seen one.

Kiba:
A "Noble"?

Hige:
I keep forgetting you're new here.
Look, those guys are bad news.
And I, for one, am smart enough not to mess around with 'em.
Trust me, Kiba. Just let it go. Forget about him.

Lord Orkham:
Nothing has happened. Nothing has been stolen.
I desire but one thing.
Bring me the white flower.

Toboe:
So what are you gonna do now? Do you have somewhere to go?

Tsume:
Who knows?

Toboe:
I wonder if I'll ever see Leara again...
Hey, you think it'd be okay if I went to visit her?

Tsume:
You saw that look on her face, didn't you?

Toboe:
She was just...a little surprised, that's all.

Tsume:
You can't be serious. She was pissing in her pants.

Toboe:
She was not!

Tsume:
That girl was reeking of it.

Toboe:
Why do you have to lie about everything?
You heard that sound too, didn't you?
And it must have made you feel sad!
So stop lying, and just be honest with yourself.

Tsume:
Fine, whatever. If you want to go, then go.
It's not like I care what happens to you.

Toboe:
So why did you save me, then?
If you really don't care, then you should have just left me, or pretended not to recognise me.
I mean, I'm not your friend or anything...

Tsume:
You're right. You're not my friend.

Toboe:
Yeah, I forgot, you're only friends with humans.
It's easier that way, isn't it?
'Cause no human is ever gonna be as strong as you. They'll do whatever you tell them to.

Tsume:
You don't know what you're talking about!
You have no idea what it takes to survive in this city, how dangerous it is.
Nothing!
Go on. Let's see how well you do on your own.
Beat it!

Toboe:
Being alone doesn't bother you?

Tsume:
Hey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I ever got mixed up with a kid like you.
I'm sick of friends. Who needs 'em?

Cher:
Hi, Hubb.

Hubb:
You're looking well. I was afraid it was something serious.

Cher:
I was just overworked.

Hubb:
A gift for the lady.

Cher:
Thank you. Can I open it?

Hubb:
Mm-hmm.
I'd forgotten how lovely you look, lying in bed.

Cher:
Oh please. I must look awful.
Your sense of fashion's terrible as ever.

Hubb:
They told me you'd worked yourself into the ground, but I didn't believe it.

Cher:
No kidding. There goes my Iron Woman reputation...

Hubb:
The red snow will fall.

Cher:
The red snow?

Hubb:
Cher...
This isn't the best time to ask, but do you know about the "Book of the Moon"?

Cher:
Yes. I think it's a pagan book, isn't it?
Why do you ask?

Hubb:
Well, that man who brought in the dog, he told me something pretty weird.
Some old story about how humans were created from wolves.

Cher:
A Red Moon...

Hubb:
Huh? What?

Cher:
It doesn't matter. That book is probably banned by now.
And besides, it's just an old fairy tale.

Hubb:
Yeah, you're right. It's all nonsense.

Cher:
I should rest a while.

Hubb:
Sure. You must be tired.
You'll feel better in no time.
And when you get out of here, we'll go celebrate. Our anniversary is coming up.

Cher:
But we were married in the summer. And besides, we're...

Hubb:
I meant the one for our divorce.

Sedo:
Tsume!

Tsume:
You sold me out?

Sedo:
They got caught when we tried to sneak on the train.
We couldn't let just you get away scot free.

Tsume:
You damn humans...

Leara:
Dad... Is it okay if I go look for it a little?

Leara's father:
Let it go, Leara.

Leara:
But it's true, Dad! I swear I really did see one of them!

Leara's father:
Enough, already! Keep talking like that, and people will think you're crazy!

Leara:
You already do, don't you, Dad?!

Leara's father:
Wait, Leara!
Sorry.
Leara!

Toboe:
What does he know? I'm fine by myself.

Hige:
Uh oh. Must have taken a wrong turn.
Huh? Hey, it's one of our own!

Kiba:
Move it, will you?
That's the last time I trust your nose.

Hige:
Well, anyone's nose would go numb after a night in that stink hole.

Toboe:
Y-You guys... No way... You're...
Leara!
Don't be scared. I won't do anything.
I just wanted to see you again.
I'm so sorry about your bird.

Leara:
Daddy...Daddy...
Daddy!
Daddy!
Come quick! It's the wolf!
The wolf is here!

Leara's father:
Leara, where are you?

Quent:
Blue!

Leara:
Daddy, over here!

Toboe:
Stay calm, stay calm, stay calm!
Why, Leara? Why did you scream?

Leara:
No, stay away!
There's-There's something wrong with you! You're not normal!
How can anyone ever trust you?

Toboe:
Leara, please! I only showed you so you could trust me.

Leara:
Don't come any closer!

Toboe:
Why? Didn't you come here to catch me?

Leara:
Ahhhh!

Hige:
Come on!

Leara's father:
Leara! What happened to you?

Tsume:
You're pretty good.

Hubb:
First dogs, and now birds.
My allergies are killing me.

Troop member:
The Aviation Bureau says there weren't any unauthorised aircraft in the vicinity.

Hubb:
Well, the Nobles are the only ones allowed to fly anymore.

Troop member:
You know, you really shouldn't talk like that.

Hige:
I told you, I hate smelly places!
Hey, runt, what's eating you?

Toboe:
I'm not a runt! My name's Toboe!

Hige:
That's cool. Well, I'm Hige. And this here is Kiba.

Toboe:
Where are we headed anyway?

Hige:
Where do you think? To the exit, of course.

Toboe:
To the exit?

Hige:
We're leaving town.

Toboe:
You're leaving town? Where else are you gonna go?

Kiba:
To Paradise.

Toboe:
Paradise?
Hey, guys. Do you know Tsume?

Kiba:
Tsume?

Hige:
Nah, never heard of them.

Kiba:
Is he the one with the scar on his chest?

Toboe:
Yeah! That's Tsume, alright!

Kiba:
Okay. What about him?

Toboe:
He's one of us, so I thought he might want to leave, too.

Hige:
Well, I don't know him. Where is he? Hiding out some place?

Toboe:
I don't know.
We got split up.

Hige:
Sorry, pal, but it's too late to go back for him now.
So what? Is he like a friend of yours?

Toboe:
No, he's not! He's not my friend.

Hige:
So ditch him already.
Shake a leg, runt!

Toboe:
That's Toboe!

Hubb:
"Book of the Moon"...
No matching records.

Troop member:
Hub. Hey, your dinner's here.

Hubb:
Thanks, I'm starving.
Isn't it kind of late to be going out on a raid?

Troop member:
It's that gang of thieves again. They finally found the last of their hideouts.
They were tracking the leader this afternoon, a young guy, but then out of nowhere this huge black dog shows up.

Hubb:
Dog?

Troop member:
Yeah. And the weird thing is, when they lost sight of the guy, this other dog appeared
What's wrong?

Hubb:
You!

Hige:
What a crap heap. Why the hell did you bring us here?

Toboe:
Tsume!

Tsume:
You!

Hige:
Wha-? Hey, is this him?

Kiba:
I could smell the blood from your wound.

Tsume:
What?

Kiba:
I smelled it all the way here from town.

Tsume:
And you're gonna nurse me back to health?
Well, I don't need your help.

Toboe:
Tsume, look, I...
We're leaving the city. I really think you should come with us.

Tsume:
And just where is this merry band of yours going?

Kiba:
To Paradise.

Tsume:
You're kidding me. You're going with them because you believe in that crap?

Toboe:
I don't know, but...
If we stay here, we'll have to spend the rest of our lives in hiding or worse.
We just can't live with the humans anymore and survive.

Hige:
Look, I hate to interrupt, but a nasty stink is headed this way.

Tsume:
We're surrounded.

Kiba:
Let me ask you. Why did you guys come to this city?
It was because of the flower scent, wasn't it?
Well, it's gone now. There's no reason to stay.

Tsume:
The flower has nothing to do with it.
I'm here because I belong.

Kiba:
I can see that. This city is a dump.

Tsume:
I still have a score to settle with you.

Hige:
We don't have time for this!

Tsume:
The last time we met, you said something about how your pride wouldn't allow you to pass as a human.
Well, you look pretty human now. Where'd your pride go?

Kiba:
Nowhere. Nothing has changed.

Tsume:
Do you have the slightest idea of what leaving the city would mean?

Kiba:
Yeah.

Tsume:
You'll just die.

Kiba:
Possibly. Everyone's gonna die. It's a natural part of life.
But if life has no purpose, you're dead already.

Toboe:
Thank you.

Tsume:
Go on. Hurry up!

Toboe:
You're really not coming with us?
Tsume!

Quent:
What made you decide to join me?

Hubb:
Wolves don't exist. I'm only here to prove that.

Hige:
What the hell are you stopping for?

Toboe:
Tsume!

Kiba:
This way!

Hige:
Jump already!

Toboe:
I was getting ready to, alright?

Tsume:
Move it!

Hubb:
Hey, wait a minute!

Toboe:
Tsume, what are you waiting for? C'mon, jump!

Hubb:
Stop it! You don't have the right to shoot!

Quent:
You idiot!

Hubb:
He's a human, Quent! He looks human to me!

Kiba:
Are you scared?

Tsume:
Yeah, you wish.

Quent:
I'm not tracking them for pleasure or curiosity, you know.
It's for revenge.
Now do you believe?

Hubb:
Believe what?

Quent:
That you've been deceived this entire time.
By a pack of wolves.

Hubb:
You're wrong...
It's not possible.

Tsume:
Screw this stupid journey.
Paradise can kiss my ass.
I'm just...fed up with this stinking town.
It was time to move on, anyway.

-Ending-

Hubb: 
Hay fever season is almost upon us again.
Overcoming your allergies begins with improving your lifestyle.
A balanced diet is important, as is a regular sleeping schedule and preventing stress from building up.
