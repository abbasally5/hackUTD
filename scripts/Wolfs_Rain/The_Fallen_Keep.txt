  -Opening-

Hige:
Kiba!
Damn it, will you wait up?
Come on, you're going too fast! Let's take a break.

Kiba:
We don't have time for that.

Hige:
Would you use your head for once?
We've got a girl and a little kid with us!

Blue:
I can hear you, you know.
Don't worry about me, I can keep up.

Toboe:
Yeah, me too...

Tsume:
You realise he's the one who wants to rest, don't you?

Hige:
I do not! I just...

Tsume:
But you've got to admit he does have a point.
At this rate, none of us will make it.
We can take shelter in those rocks 'til the storm clears.

Hige:
That settles it, then. Can you guys hang in a little longer?

Blue:
Just worry about yourself, alright?

Hige:
Yes, ma'am. Sorry.

Tsume:
Let's go.

The sun'll be up soon. We should rest here until then.

Hige:
What do you say, Kiba? I mean, the storm will blow itself out by morning.

Kiba:
It already has.
Come on. It'll be fine.

Tsume:
Well, none of us will be fine!

Kiba:
Do what you want. I'm leaving.

Blue:
Look, I can handle it.

Toboe:
Yeah, let's get going.

Hige:
No! I'm not going anywhere 'til morning.

Kiba:
I understand.

Toboe:
Kiba!

Hige:
Let him go.

Toboe:
But why?

Hige:
Right now, the only thing he can see is Cheza.
It doesn't make any difference whether we're with him or not.

Tsume:
We'll follow him once the storm blows over. For now, just get some rest and don't worry about it.

Blue:
Hige, you sure about this?

Hige:
He obsesses too much. What can you do?

Hubb:
So, I take it you didn't like the scarf that much, huh?
It's really too bad, I thought it suited you.
Uh, I guess not.

Cher:
You lunkhead.
Cheza is...
A girl made from Lunar Flowers by utilising an ancient alchemy.
It was Lord Darcia the First who created her.
She was stolen by Lord Orkham and brought to the lab for us to study.
Hoping that we could awaken her and open the gates to Paradise.

Hubb:
Paradise...

Cher:
It's a world where wolves reign supreme.
They're drawn to the Lunar Flower, because it's the one thing that can guide the world's remaining wolves to Paradise.

Hubb:
Tell me, Cher. Did you know about all of this from the very beginning?
Then who told you?
Wait a minute! You mean at the keep we're headed towards...

Quent:
A world of wolves, huh?
If that's what you call Paradise, I'll take my chances in Hell any day of the week.

Hubb:
Quent, you were awake?

Quent:
Hey, what can I say? It's too cold to stay drunk.

Cher:
The Book of the Moon, it isn't just a fairy tale, you know.

Quent:
Maybe.
But even if you're right, there's nothing we humans can do about it now, is there?
I'll never be able to forgive the wolves. Not after what they did.
Even if they are the supreme rulers of this rotten world, I'm gonna eradicate every one of 'em.

Neige:
My Lord Darcia. Inside the keep, there's...

Darcia:
A wolf?

Neige:
Yes.

Darcia:
My love, now that I have lost you, Paradise holds no meaning for me.
And yet...
This wolf's eye throbs.
Why?
What is this feeling that threatens to overwhelm me...
My beloved Hamona... Tell me.
What should I...

Cheza:
He is here.

Tsume:
So this is the keep of Darcia.

Hige:
The place looks like it should be haunted.

Toboe:
By what?

Hige:
By the ghosts of all the cursed Nobles.

Toboe:
Come on, don't say stuff like that!

Blue:
But still, are you sure that girl is inside of there?

Hige:
The scent is faint, but it's definitely a Lunar Flower.

Tsume:
He's got visitors.

Hige:
Hey, hold on!

Blue:
Pops is here!

Hige:
Blue, what is it? What's gotten into you?

Toboe:
Come on!

Hubb:
Who are the Nobles, anyway?

Cher:
There was extensive literature dealing with the Nobility, but most of it was lost with the decline of civilisation.
Yet there are some things we do know.
They say that long before the world became as it is now, the Nobles extolled the virtues of this culture. By using an amazing form of alchemy, they blazed a path to the stars, and opened the doors to space and time.
But in an instant, all of it simply vanished.
No one really knows what happened then.
But many people disappeared. The development and execution of their alchemy came to be a secret known only to the remaining Nobles that was never to be passed on to the people.
All of that happened almost two hundred years ago.

Quent:
And now what remains of this world is slowly fading away.
Along with the blood-red moon.

Cheza:
He is here.

Kiba:
Cheza!

Cheza:
Kiba!

Hige:
Why the hell are you in such a rush?

Blue:
It's Pops. I know he's here...

Toboe:
But do you really want to see him? That "Pops" guy?

Blue:
No. It might be better if I didn't.

Toboe:
But maybe the reason he's out here is to find you.

Tsume:
So, what if he is?
Are you gonna go back to being that human's dog?

Hige:
Hey, lay off!

Toboe:
Yeah, Tsume, be quiet! You don't know what it's like!

Tsume:
Guess I don't.
Unlike the two of you, I've never had the pleasure of being kept as a pet.

Hige:
Now, now, let's find Kiba and Cheza. We can fight later.
The flower scent's coming from over there.

Hubb:
The worship of wolves, huh?

Cher:
But it's not just a simple animal cult.
It's deeper than that. I think the vision of this world has split somehow. There's one we humans can see, and one we must have lost sight of at some point.
I'm fairly certain the animals are aware of that.

Hubb:
Including the wolves?

Quent:
What the hell brought that on?

Hubb:
I have a terrible allergy to dogs.

Quent:
Is that a fact? Then they must be over this way.
Those allergies sure do come in handy.

Hubb:
Glad I could help.

Cheza:
Kiba!

Kiba:
Cheza!

Darcia:
So wolf, have you come for revenge?

Kiba:
You will not hurt Cheza.

Darcia:
Cheza, she is a being that we created, a mere embodiment of a Lunar Flower.
Why is it that your desire for her is so desperate?

Kiba:
I don't know who you Nobles are. Or what you're trying to do.
And to be honest, I don't really care.
Cheza is all that matters. She's going to show us the way to Paradise.

Darcia:
You damn wolf... All of this first began with your wretched breed.

Hubb:
What is it?
Hey!

Darcia:
It's because of you. You and your kind stole everything from me.
And in return, you gave me a curse. And grief. And suffering.
And my eye transformed into one such as yours.
The price I paid for being cursed by Paradise.
And now...the only thing that surrounds me is despair.

Kiba:
Don't! What is it? What do you want?

Darcia:
Have you found it? Have you found Paradise?

Kiba:
We will. No matter what!

Darcia:
What do you expect to find there?

Kiba:
A future.

Darcia:
A future?

Kiba:
Not hope. Or despair. Just a future.
Nothing more.

Darcia:
I no longer have any need...for a future.

Quent:
It's over, wolf!

Blue:
No, don't!

Quent:
B-Blue...

Toboe:
Kiba!

Neige:
My Lord Darcia!

Kiba:
Cheza!

Tsume:
Kiba!

Kiba:
Cheza!

Hige:
Blue, no!

Cher:
Cheza!

Hubb:
We have to hurry!

Quent:
How could you?
Why, Blue?

Hubb:
Quent!

Quent:
Blue!

Cher:
Jaguara!

Blue:
That way!

Hubb:
Did that wolf just say something?!

Hige:
Kiba!

Tsume:
What are you doing?
Kiba!

Cheza:
Kiba!
Kiba!

Toboe:
Kiba!
Kiba!
Kiba!

-Ending-

Neige:
A human life is an ephemeral thing.
It is always wise to look on one's past from time to time.
But perhaps my life is a trifle too long to dwell upon.
And so, I bid you adieu.
