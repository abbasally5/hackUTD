  Hamona:
This feels great.
The sunlight is so peaceful... How I've missed it.
My love. What are you looking at?

Darcia:
How beautifully your hair shines in the sunlight.
And your eyes so gentle and so full of love.
I wish to engrave this image of you in my heart, so that this moment will last forever.

Hamona:
But why?
We are always together, you and I, and we always will be. Together until the end of the time.

Darcia:
Hamona... Beautiful Hamona...
Dearest, I will give you my word.
I promise that one day, I will take you to Paradise.

Hamona:
No.
For me, this is Paradise.
When you and I are together, wherever we are, that is always Paradise to me.

Neige:
My Lord. The Lady Hamona has fallen ill.

Darcia:
Paradise Sickness?

Neige:
Her soul is slowly fading away.

Darcia:
Are you telling me she has the curse of my clan?
You are my only hope.
You must guide this miserable soul from despair...
Cheza, the Flower Maiden.

-Opening-

Hige:
C'mon, runt!
Get a move on, or we'll leave you behind!

Toboe:
Hey, doesn't this forest seem kinda strange to you?
There aren't any animals around.

Hige:
Tell me something. You do know that you're a wolf, right?

Toboe:
Huh?

Hige:
Think about it, genius. They probably ran off when they saw us coming.

Toboe:
Oh, of course!

Hige:
This is the problem with taking city kids to the woods.

Toboe:
I was thinking, I haven't smelled the flower at all since we left that cave.
I wonder if this is really the right way...

Tsume:
You wanna give us a clue here?

Kiba:
Sure.

Tsume:
Where exactly are we headed?

Kiba:
To Paradise.

Tsume:
And just what in the hell is guiding you there?

Kiba:
I'm going on instinct.

Hige:
Here we go again.
I just wish at least it felt like we were getting a little closer, not that I'm complaining or anything.

Tsume:
That noise...

Hige:
It's an airship. It must be one of the Nobles.

Toboe:
I hate that sound.

Darcia:
We're getting close. Can you sense it?
That castle is where you were born.
So, they're here.

Cher:
It's a faint signal, but it's moving.
Commander, she must be somewhere inside that vessel.

Commander:
Can you be certain?

Cher:
I'm sure these readings confirm it.
Cheza's awake, and she's reacting to something.

Soldier #1:
It's been over a month since she was stolen.
There's no telling if she's even alive, let alone awake.

Cher:
He's not going to kill her.
It was him we took her away from in the first place.

Commander:
And now, gentlemen, it is our sole objective to retrieve it.
Fire a warning shot.

Toboe:
What's going on?

Hige:
Man, they're really going at it.

Kiba:
She's there...

Tsume:
Hold it! It's nothing to do with us! Stay out of it!

Kiba:
I can feel it...

Hige:
Feel what?

Kiba:
I'm not sure. But it's so familiar...
Come on, don't you guys feel anything at all?

Tsume:
Kiba!

Toboe:
Can you?

Hige:
That guy is hopeless.

Kiba:
The Flower Maiden...

Cher:
Look at these readings. What's it mean?

Commander:
Target his main engines.

Soldier #2:
Yes, sir.

Darcia:
Cheza!
Don't do it!

Cher:
Oh, no!

Tsume:
Kiba!

Toboe:
Wait for us!

Hige:
That scent...

The scent is faint, but it's up there.

Tsume:
Why in the hell are you so worked up?

Hige:
Aw, man. It's got the stink of a Noble mixed in there too...

Tsume:
A Noble?

Toboe:
Hey, Kiba!
I got this fluttery feeling in my chest...
Is that what you meant?

Kiba:
Let's go.

Soldier #1:
The crest of the House of Darcia... Was this their stronghold?

Cher:
From what I understand, this was just one of many villas the Darcia family had.
But that was years ago.

Soldier #1:
Yeah, they were cursed by Paradise and the family fell into ruin.
Soon this place'll fall, too.

Cher:
The town is a match for the flower habitat that was depicted in the Book of the Moon.
Cheza was born right here.
Still, it's hard to imagine that Lunar Flowers ever bloomed on this devastated mountaintop.

Toboe:
I don't know why, but my heart is pounding!
And I feel all warm and tingly inside...

Hige:
This is that cool feeling you get before pouncing on a pretty girl...

Tsume:
Don't let your guard down.
But there's a shiver up my spine, too.

Hige:
It's her. It's really her.

Toboe:
My heart just skipped a beat!

Tsume:
Who is that?
Hold on!

Kiba:
Cheza.

Cheza:
We meet at last.

Toboe:
I wanna be held like that...

Tsume:
Can that really be...?

Hige:
Yeah.
That's her. That's the Flower Maiden.

Commander:
What's going on?

Cher:
I don't know.
Whatever it is, it's coming from the garden.
But the reading's so large, I can't get an exact fix on it.

Commander:
Surround the garden immediately! Mobilise all units now!

Cheza:
This way! This way!

Hige:
That's Cheza, alright. That's the Flower Maiden.

Toboe:
She's a flower and a maiden? That's pretty weird.

Hige:
Well, the way I heard it, some Nobles with too much time on their hands made her from a Lunar Flower in a lab somewhere.

Tsume:
They made a human from a flower?
Give me a break. Do you really believe all that?

Hige:
Come on, she's standing right there, isn't she?

Toboe:
Yeah.
And she smells nice too.
Like a flower.

Tsume:
Smell or no smell, I don't trust any of this.

Toboe:
Even though your heart skipped a beat too?

Hige:
Well I, for one, believe it.
I mean, just think about it.
As crazy as it seemed at the time, Kiba led us straight to this place on instinct or whatever you want to call it, right?
Even if it is some big coincidence, at least it finally feels like we're one step closer.

Toboe:
It sure does!

Hige:
Well, either way you look at it, she's really not my type at all.
It's such a bummer.

Cher:
The signal's definitely moving.
No, of course I don't know why!
I need you to surround the area before we lose the signal, do you understand?

Cheza:
This one has been waiting for you.
This one was born right here in this place for that reason.
Everybody! This one's home!
Oh my. There is no one here anymore.
They...They all withered and died.
This one is the only one left.

Hige:
Kiba, we're in serious trouble! I smell humans all over the place!

Toboe:
I think we're surrounded!

Kiba:
No! It wasn't her!

Toboe:
Come on, guys, we don't have time for this! We have to escape!

Hige:
What do you mean "escape"? We're surrounded! Where the hell are we supposed to go?

Tsume:
Where are you going?

Hige:
Didn't you hear what I said?

Toboe:
What do we do, huh?

Tsume:
We don't have much of a choice.

Hige:
Kiba's lost it this time.

Toboe:
Kiba, wait for me!

Cher:
Are you trying to kill her?

Commander:
What's going on?

Soldier:
Sir, we're being attacked...

Commander:
Someone's trying to escape with it.

Cher:
Darcia.

Commander:
I don't know.

Hige:
Man, look at all those guys!

Tsume:
Damn it...

Hige:
We're totally screwed! They've got that end completely blocked off.

Tsume:
What do we do? If we left her here, we could get away.

Kiba:
Forget it!

Toboe:
Guys!

Cheza:
This way!

Commander:
Can you confirm how many?

Soldier:
Information is still being gathered, sir.
A couple of reports said they saw some boys.

Cher:
Some boys?

Commander:
Is she close to here?

Soldiers:
Let's go!

Cher:
She... She was smiling.

Hige:
What the hell?

Toboe:
It's no use! There's no way we can get outta here!

Hige:
We could always try surrendering.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding!

Cheza:
This way.

Toboe:
Where did that giant hole come from?
The wall just moved!

Hige:
Hey, I'm not complaining. Let's get outta here.

Toboe:
Tsume, c'mon!

Soldier #1:
They vanished?

Soldier #2:
That's impossible! Start searching!

-Ending-

Darcia:
Night is a time of sleep.
However, there are some tales that can only be told in the dead of night.
You seem exhausted, as well.
