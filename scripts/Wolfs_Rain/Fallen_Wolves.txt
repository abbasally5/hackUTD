  Little girl:
Doggies!

Toboe:
I had a dream that we'd reached Paradise.
Oh, it was so amazing.
There were all these red and blue flowers blooming as far as the eye could see.
And you know what? They were all Lunar Flowers!

Hige:
Have you ever seen a Lunar Flower before?

Toboe:
Well, no, not really...
But Granny was there too, and she took care of us and she cooked for us, and made us all kinds of delicious food.

Hige:
What're you talking about?

Tsume:
I guess you'll be happy being somebody's pet even in Paradise.

Toboe:
It's not what you're thinking.
It was like a party, and we were all treated like guests, and there was great music playing and everything.

Hige:
It sounds like a city coffee shop to me.

Toboe:
But it's true, Hige! It was so amazing!
It made me think that this was really Paradise!
It's kinda hard to describe...

Hige:
Well, with a brain like yours, what'd you expect?

Toboe:
Give me a break. Not even Kiba's told me what Paradise is really like, so how am I supposed to know!
What colour are Lunar Flowers, anyway? Can you tell me that?

What is it?

Kiba:
The ocean.
The scent is really faint, but it's Lunar Flowers, alright...

Toboe:
Guys, this is it! Paradise is right up ahead, I know it!

-Opening-

Hige:
You smelt flowers, huh?
Well, all I smell is the stench of some old rancid oil.

Tsume:
Man, what a crappy city.

Toboe:
Do you think they're all afraid of us?

Hige:
Not used to visitors, that's for sure.

Tsume:
What are we supposed to find here anyway?
This is some Paradise.

Hige:
It's a woman...

Zali:
Where are you boys from?

Kiba:
A city to the north.

Zali:
Why are you here?

Tsume:
Just passing through. You don't expect us to do business here, in a dump like this?

Zali:
Well, then where are you going?

Hige:
Where are we going?

Toboe:
To Paradise!
Kiba, why are they laughing?

Kiba:
Because they obviously don't know anything about Paradise.

Zali:
We know all about it.

Moss:
It's nothing but a stupid legend.

Toboe:
Legend?

Moss:
That's right, kid. There's no such thing as Paradise.

Kiba:
What makes you say that?

Moss:
Maybe because we've been there. We've all seen it.
And I'm telling you it wasn't Paradise. That place was more like Hell.

Tsume:
Well, that's no surprise.

Zali:
You'll all find out soon enough.
You'll see that Paradise isn't worth looking for.
Now, why don't you all just get lost? You do have somewhere you belong, don't you?

Toboe:
Come on, Kiba, let's go. I don't want to hang around here.

Tsume:
What a damn joke...
A bunch of down-and-out losers just gave me the brush-off.

Hige:
Yeah, right. You're not exactly one to talk, you know.

Tsume:
What'd you say?!

Hige:
It's just in a couple of years, we could be just like those guys.

Toboe:
This city is scary. It doesn't feel right.
There may be a lot of wolves that live around here, but this place is really cold.

Tsume:
Well, maybe they're right. The sooner we get out of here, the better off we'll be.

Kiba:
And where do you think we should go exactly?
There has to be something here.
Look how many wolves are in this city. I think we should stay and find out.

Boss:
Yeah, yeah. 'Course I need workers, but everyone you bring me is always too old.

Zali:
They still get the job done, don't they?

Boss:
Sure, but for how long?

Zali:
Look, do you need workers or not?

Boss:
Alright, alright. Come back tomorrow morning.

Cole:
Those kids remind me of you, how you used to be in the old days.
Unafraid of anything... That fire in their eyes...
Zali... Are you satisfied with our life here?

Zali:
Yeah. Sure, I am. This is the life suits us all just fine.

Cole:
Can you say that with as much pride to those boys?

Moss:
Those kids went off toward the graveyard. I doubt anyone will see 'em.

Zali:
Fine. Just keep a close eye on them until they leave town.

Moss:
Don't worry, when they find they can't get any food, they won't stick around for very long.
Unless of course you wanna train them, they can work here.

Zali:
Leave the thinking to me, got it?
When it comes to the pack, we only take care of our business. That's the way it is.

Hige:
Who was that?
Oh, it's me.
But it was Tsume that time.
How do those guys live here with nothing to eat, standing around a bunch of trash all day doing nothing?

Toboe:
I can't walk another step...

Hige:
Okay, then. I guess we should just find a place to sleep.
Where the hell are you going?
Oh, wait up!

Tsume:
This'll be a good place to sleep.

Hige:
Well, it looks like we can forget food.

Toboe:
This place is giving me the willies.
Guys, I keep hearing something weird.

Tsume:
Damn it, would you stop being afraid of everything?

Hige:
Hey, gramps, what are you doing? You scared the crap out of us!

Gramps:
Oh, I was only digging a hole for myself.

Hige:
A hole for yourself?

Kiba:
Are you saying you're digging a grave?

Gramps:
Well, when you get to my age, you begin to recognise when your time has come.

Tsume:
You might want to dig a little faster, then.

Toboe:
I thought I was a goner too...

Kiba:
Excuse me, but do you know of any Lunar Flowers in this city?

Gramps:
Oh, a flower bed that went on forever!
Long long ago, they bloomed all over this island.
But then one day they were all dug up, and now there isn't a single petal left.

Hige:
A long time ago, huh?

Toboe:
Hey, can you tell us what colour they were?

Gramps:
What colour? Well, let's see...
The colour of the moon.

Tsume:
And what about Paradise? Have you been there?

Gramps:
Every wolf goes in search of it.
I myself tried to find it once.

Toboe:
What'd you do?

Gramps:
Look. That's the entrance over there.

Hige:
That reeks. It smells like death warmed over.

Toboe:
I was kinda hoping it'd be a nicer place.

Gramps:
I wouldn't.
There have been many young wolves that have set out through there.
But sadly enough, not one of them ever reached Paradise.
And what's left for the ones that return is to eke out a living here.
Just like the rest of us.

Zali:
Okay, old man. I think you should call it a day. Don't forget there's work to do tomorrow.

Gramps:
I see...
Well, I've dug it deep enough.

Kiba:
Wait a minute. When you and your pack tried to get to Paradise, is this the path you took?

Zali:
I thought I told you it doesn't exist.

Gramps:
Zali.

Zali:
If you kids disrupt the peace of this pack in any way, I'll show you no mercy.
Now get out of town before dawn! Is that clear?

Tsume:
So tell me. You still believe in it?

Kiba:
Believe in what?

Tsume:
Paradise. There's no such place.
They said they've been there and apparently it was no Paradise.

Kiba:
Well, maybe what they found wasn't the real Paradise.

Tsume:
Where the hell does all that confidence come from?
Anyway, you know it's hopeless.
There's absolutely no guarantee that we'll ever reach it, either.
We'd be stupid to keep going.

Toboe:
Don't say that. Besides, getting angry just makes you hungrier.

Tsume:
Maybe we should just hang around here and die in the gutter.
Start digging some holes like that old man?

Kiba;
It's not confidence.
I'm not really sure what it is.
But it's always there, screaming inside of me.
I just have to know. I have to get there, that's why I've kept on running all this time.
I can't imagine living without believing in it.

Cole:
You boys must be starving by now.

Hige:
Yes, yes! We are, we are! That's very kind of you to notice!

Toboe:
Wait, Kiba!

Hige:
Ah, just let him go.
Thanks, this is really great.

Cole:
What about you? Aren't you gonna eat?

Hige:
Aw, come on. Lighten up and dig in already, will you?
I mean, let's face it, pal, there's no telling when our next meal is gonna be.

Tsume:
Weren't you listening back there? Our little trip is over.
We don't have a destination. It's finished.

Hige:
Well, what do you think, Miss, uh...?

Cole:
My name is Cole.

Hige:
Cole, huh?

Cole:
Maybe you boys should think of staying around for a while.

Hige:
Well, that's tempting, isn't it?

Toboe:
Guys! Kiba went off by himself!
Tsume? Wait, what's the matter?

Tsume:
This isn't worth my time.

Toboe:
Now Tsume's left!

Hige:
Who cares? Let him go.
This place has more going for it than I thought.

Toboe:
Come on, where are you going?
We can't keep doing this, 'cause before you know it, we'll all get split up and be separated for good.

Tsume:
That's fine by me.

Toboe:
Well, it's not by me.

Hige:
Oh man, am I stuffed!
And I thought this city was tapped clean. Where did you get all this food?

Cole:
If you really want to know, you should come to the station tomorrow morning.

Hige:
The station? Wait, you mean there's more there?

Cole:
That's right. You'll see something fascinating.

Hige:
Oh well. I wonder where the hell those guys ran off to.

Tsume:
I'm really tired. What do you say we rest here?

Toboe:
'Kay.

Moss:
Why the long face? Giving up on going to Paradise?

Gang member #1:
It's not safe for a kid to wander around by himself, you know.

Gang member #2:
You should move with your pack.

Kiba:
What are you guys doing? Standing around with no purpose?

Moss:
What'd you say?

Kiba:
I know why you weren't able to get to Paradise.
You're nothing but a pack of dogs.

Moss:
Why, you little punk!

Toboe:
Hige?

Hige:
Word is they'll give us some food here.

Tsume:
What about...?

Hige:
Kiba, you mean? I dunno. He never did come back.
What are they doing?

Tsume:
What the hell is going on down there?!

Man:
Okay, hold it there! Rest the dogs!

Tsume:
Start talking, mister!

Zali:
The train makes a quick stop.
It gives the humans and us a chance to eat.
It's the only way we can all make a living out here. We work for them, and they feed us.

Hige:
Scratching each other's backs? Just like you, Tsume. You used to do the same thing.

Tsume:
I may have used them, but I was never used by them!

Zali:
Your opinion doesn't change a damn thing.

Hige:
Gramps is in serious trouble!

Man:
There's a stray dog loose!

Zali:
I thought I told you not to interfere.
We have our own way of doing things around here.

Kiba:
Living like a bunch of down-and-out strays?
Clinging to this disgusting place and doing what you do, how can you call that a life?!

Zali:
What the hell do you know about it?

Kiba:
You're pathetic.

Zali:
You kids are still young.

-Ending-

Tsume:
What the hell is going on in this town?
Every last one of 'em pisses me off...
You know, I got hungrier when I got mad just then...
Hey, we are gonna get something to eat next time, right?
