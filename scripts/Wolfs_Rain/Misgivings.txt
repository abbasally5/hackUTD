  -Opening-

Hubb:
A rumour was going around that there was a theft at the house of Lord Orkham's just a month ago. And apparently, it was never reported to the police.

Prostitute:
What a silly reason to come here.
The more important question is why are you shaking?
Am I so scary, little boy?

Hubb:
No. You see, I'm allergic to snakes.

Prostitute:
I've never heard that one before.
Come on, you can talk about work later, right?

Hubb:
Well, the truth is, I always embarrass myself in situations like this.
I'm pretty sick of it, myself.

Prostitute:
Oh, that's the cutest line I've ever heard...
But nevertheless, it's not really customary for a detective to go digging around in a Noble's affairs.
What are you after?

Hubb:
I'm looking for someone.

Prostitute:
Your lover?

Hubb:
My ex-wife.

Prostitute:
Is that so?
It's been said that the thieves that got into the castle were the last survivors of a fallen Noble family.
The lord of the manor has his pride, you know?
I think he wants to catch them himself.

Hubb:
Is that why it wasn't reported?

Prostitute:
Perhaps he wanted to keep whatever was stolen a secret from the police, you know?

Hubb:
Thank you.

Quent:
A glass of whatever will warm me up.

Bartender:
Yes, sir.

Cher:
I'd like a chilled sherry, please.

Bartender:
Yes, ma'am.

Quent/Cher:
Hit me again.

Quent:
Looks like you still got a fair amount of tourists round this place.

Bartender:
All the uninvited ones, anyway.

Quent:
So what do they come here to see?
That old castle on the mountain top?

Cher:
That place is nothing but ruins now.
And besides, you can't get anywhere near it.

Quent:
Oh?

Cher:
There are wolves up there.

Quent:
What?

Cher:
Give me another.

Bartender:
Don't you think you've had enough?

Cher:
I guess.

Kiba:
Cheza...

Cheza:
We have a friend, even here.
It is alright.
You do not know what you are? You never did. Is that not right?
There is some wolf inside of you too.
You were alone your whole life, were you not?

Kiba:
Cheza!

Soldier #1:
No doubt about it, sir. We've pinpointed the target's location.

Commander:
Good. Continue to keep a trace on them.

Soldier #2:
Should we hit them all at once, sir?

Commander:
No, make sure the town's surrounded first.
After you've cut off all their escape routes, I want you to move your men in and capture the target!

Soldier #2:
Yes, sir!

Soldier #3:
What about the woman?

Commander:
You can ignore her. At this point, she's useless.

Hige:
This should be a perfect place to hide!

Tsume:
Once we catch wind of what they're up to, we'll come right back.

Kiba:
Cheza, you stay here with Toboe.

Toboe:
Leave it to me!
Don't be too long, okay?
I like this. The idea of friends waiting for other friends. It's really a nice feeling, if you know what I mean.
What is it?

Cheza:
This one is stuffed!
And you?

Toboe:
Um... Sure.

Soldier #1:
This way! Get 'em!

Boy:
Hasu, let's meet up in town!

Hasu:
Right.

Soldier #2:
Those kids were no ordinary kids...

Soldier #1:
Not that crap again? Come on, stop being a chicken.

Soldier #2:
But they weren't carrying any weapons!
How d'you explain how I got these cuts?
They can't possibly be human...
They moved almost like they were wild animals...

Soldier #1:
Well, now that you mention it, that woman was saying weird stuff like that.
Something about wolves.

Soldier #2:
About wolves?
That's him!

Hasu:
Oh, crap!

Soldier #1:
Hold it!

Quent:
It's hard to believe how big you've grown...
Hey, Blue, do you remember this?
Ruus found you somewhere and brought you home. Look at you. You were nothing but a little pup back then.
I told him "no" again and again, but he wouldn't listen.
And in the end, he just stood there in the doorway, not saying a word, with those big eyes of his all full of tears.
Damn it, if it's one thing that kid got from me, it was my stubbornness.
Well, partner, how many years has it been?
You're all grown up now, aren't you, Blue?

Soldier #2:
Stay still, kid!

Hasu:
Let go of me!
I said let go!

Soldier #2:
You little...

Soldier #1:
Hey, that's enough!

Soldier #2:
S-Stay...Stay away from me!

Quent:
Get away from him.
Hey.

Hasu:
Geez, you reek...

Merchant:
Anything in particular?

Cher:
Hypothetically speaking, if a member of the House of Darcia came back, where exactly do you think he'd...

Merchant:
The Darcias?
Now that takes me back...
The family fell into ruin, and this city died.
It's all their fault.
I doubt if they'll ever come back here again.

Cher:
For argument's sake, what if they happened to come back to get something that was truly vital to them?
Something like-like a Lunar Flower.

Merchant:
Well, the castle may be a mess, but the Darcia family cemetery at the foot of the mountain is still intact.
Of course, no one goes near it now.
You see, just beyond it lies a dense forest called the "Forest of Death".

Cher:
Forest of Death?

Merchant:
Something out there makes the earth's magnetic field go haywire.
They say it makes humans lose their way.

Cher:
Thank you, you've been very helpful.

Merchant:
That's not for sale.
That's a portrait of Lord Darcia.
It was painted centuries ago.
It's really supposed to be hanging in the palace, but I'm keeping an eye on it for now. Just to make sure nothing happens to it.

Hasu:
Ow...

Quent:
Hold still.
So kid, you live alone?

Hasu:
Isn't it obvious?

Quent:
Where's your mom?

Hasu:
She's dead.

Quent:
And your dad?

Hasu:
Like they say, Nature makes a fine mother.

Soldier #2:
Well, well, we meet again.

Soldier #1:
Would you just give it a rest?
Yes, sir.

Soldier #2:
Hey. You really spooked me back there before, you know that?
Now I get to return the favour.

Soldier #1:
Roger that.
We're going back to base!

Quent:
Now listen to me, kid. I know it's important for you to feel like you're making it on your own, but...

Hasu:
Yeah? And what would you know about it?

Quent:
I know. And so will you, when you have kids of your own someday.

Hasu:
Yeah, I bet I will.
Then I'll just decide to take off one day, saying it's for the good of the family, and when my kid tries to stop me, I'm just gonna ignore him.
You're like that too, aren't you?
If you're done with your good deed for the day, then just leave me alone.
I'm sick of being lectured by people with nothing better to do.

Quent:
Be seeing you, kid.

Hasu:
Ah!

Quent:
Sorry I bothered you.

Toboe:
Haha!
What took you so long?
Hey, welcome back!

Kiba:
How'd it go?

Hige:
They've really got us surrounded this time.
So we'll have to move at night.

Kiba:
There's a place that's not too far from here that the local humans call the Forest of Death.

Toboe:
The Forest of Death... That doesn't sound good...

Kiba:
They say if you get lost in it, you never come out.

Hige:
Big deal. With our noses, that forest'll be a piece of cake.
Am I right?

Kiba:
Right.

Hige:
How's it looking?

Tsume:
I found an escape route that'll be perfect.

Kiba:
That settles it. We'll be leaving tonight.

Toboe:
Alright! We can finally get outta here!

Cher:
The cemetery of the House of Darcia...
Forest of Death...
Darcia!

Soldier #1:
We have the area surrounded, sir.

Commander:
Good, get ready to storm that thing. Kill everyone in sight but the target.

Soldier #1:
Yes, sir!

Soldier:
They're not here!

Commander:
But how? Where the hell'd they go?

Soldier #3:
What?

Soldier #4:
Roger.
The commander says they got away.

Hige:
Who got away?

Soldier #3:
They're here!
All forces, converge on my...

Soldier:
There they are! Shoot!

Quent:
That's the boy!
No doubt about it!
Oh, Blue!
Blue...
What the hell happened to you?
I'll be back as soon as I put an end to this.

Toboe:
Shouldn't they be here?

Kiba:
They are here.

Toboe:
Wh-Where?

Tsume:
Sorry we're late.

Hige:
Operation successful!

Quent:
You damn wolves!
You'll never fool me again!

Cheza:
Kiba!

Quent:
He protected her?
Blue...

-Ending-

Cheza:
Forest of Death.
Another apple.
Grab the gorilla.
Trumpet grass tides.
Old wise owl.
True or not true?
Man in a mask.
Wonder and wait.
