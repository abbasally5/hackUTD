  Cher:
Look at that energy field. Why is there so much of it concentrated in this one place?

Blue:
It gives me the creeps...

Cher:
A remote stronghold lost by the golden age. The Nobles call it the Lost City.
And Jaguara controls it.

Blue:
Her keep is somewhere inside there, huh?

Cher:
What do you intend to do with Cheza?

-Opening-

Guard:
Don't stop. Keep the line moving. That's it.
Sorry, sir. Come with me.

Quent:
Hey...
What seems to be the problem here?
So, it was this.

Toboe:
Wow, it's so warm!

Hige:
See? Boy, when I'm right, I am so right.
Right?

Toboe:
You forgot to mention it stinks here.

Hige:
Stop complaining!

Kiba:
How'd you know about this?

Hige:
Can't say for sure. Hey, must be my keen instinct.

Tsume:
Instinct, huh?

Toboe:
Look how high the ceiling is!
Man, I've never seen a dome this big before!

Tsume:
So, what's the plan?

Kiba:
Cheza's got to be somewhere inside the keep.

Hige:
Well, if that's the case, it should be over there.

Toboe:
How do you know that?

Hige:
Hey, why don't we break up into teams?
You guys look for a way in or something.
And the runt and I will scope out the joint, 'kay?

Tsume:
Don't you mean scope out the food?

Hige:
Don't worry. We'll be sure to bring back enough for everyone.
Right?

Toboe:
Mm-hmm! Leave it to us!

Tsume:
We would be less conspicuous if we split up.

Kiba:
Alright. The two of us will go check out the area around the keep.

Hige:
It's a plan. We'll meet you back here at moonrise.

Toboe:
Hige, wait for me!

Blue:
I've got a bad feeling about this place... Doesn't it feel like we're being watched?

Cher:
Maybe the keep is up there.
It looks like you can't get into the city without an ID.

Blue:
Well then, I guess we'd better get some.

Cher:
Easier said than done... What do you suggest?

Skater #1:
Hello, ladies!
Damn, you're fine!
See? Didn't I tell you they were hotties?

Cher:
Hey, can I ask you something?

Skater #1:
Sure, what do you wanna know?

Cher:
Do you boys have any IDs?

Skater #1:
Well, can't you tell by lookin' at us?

Cher:
See you around, fellas.

Skater #1:
Snap! Ugh, that's cold! Don't be like that!
Check it, man! This one's even younger 'n prettier than the blonde!

Cher:
Come on.

Skater #1:
Wait a second!

Cher:
Let go!

Skater #1:
What's your damage?
It won't kill you to have a little fun, will it?

Blue:
Hands off.

Skater #1:
Oh man, I love your eyes! You got us both shaking all over!

Blue:
If you don't get lost right now, you're gonna regret it.

Skater #1:
You got it wrong, babe. I don't regret nothing!

Blue:
Are you okay?

Cher:
Yeah.

Skater #1:
Oh yeah!
Hoo-wee, you're strong!
I'm all weak in the knees!
Catch you later!

Blue:
What was that about?

Cher:
Who knows?
Thank you, Blue.
Those boy didn't know what hit 'em. You're amazing.

Blue:
They were kids.
Anyway, you have some pretty amazing weapons of your own, you know?
You got brains, and guts, and the wiles of a woman.

Toboe:
We should be able to find food, and water, and just about anything else in a place like this.
Don't you think?

Hige:
After you turn the corner up ahead, there's a big stairway that leads up...
After that...

Toboe:
What are you talking about?

Hige:
It's really here!

Toboe:
Hige, what's going on?

Hige:
You morons! Watch where you're going!

Toboe:
I guess this place has people like Tsume, too...

Tsume:
So what now?
Trying to go through the front gate would be suicide.
Not that that scares me.
Just seems kinda pointless is all.

Kiba:
Wise men's words. You want to find the back door?

Tsume:
Well, if you insist. I suppose we could.

Servant:
Pardon, milady.
It's come to my attention that #23's signal has been detected somewhere within the city walls.
What does milady desire us do?

Jaguara:
23...

Servant:
Yes, milady. This would mean that they have all returned.
The long-awaited time has finally arrived.

Jaguara:
Leave me.

Servant:
Yes, milady.

Jaguara:
The last wolf, hidden by the blinding light of the moon...
What will he be like, I wonder. This wolf that will lead me to Paradise?

Toboe:
Come on, wait up!
Hige.

Hige:
And just up ahead, there's a little elevator...
And past that...

Toboe:
I don't believe it.

Hige:
This oughta take us all the way up.

Toboe:
Hey, shouldn't we be heading back by now?

Hige:
Relax, we'll be fine. Let's just see how far we can go, okay?

Toboe:
Hige... How did you know? You've been here before, right?

Hige:
Nope.
But when your instincts are as sharp as mine are, you get a feel for things.

Quent:
I don't like this place...

Bartender:
What can I get you?

Quent:
Vodka.
And fill this up for me, will you?

Troop member #1:
So we finally mopped up what was left of Orkham's troops, huh?

Troop member #2:
What a miserable way to go.
Well, that means the world belongs to Lady Jaguara now.

Troop member #3:
Speaking of which, what's with the snazzy dresser that was brought in?

Troop member #4:
Oh, you mean that dandy we captured with the Flower Maiden?
Mr. Fancy-pants keeps claiming he's some kind of detective.

Troop member #1:
I always knew the detectives belonged in the dungeon.

Bartender:
Excuse me, sir, but something tells me you're new to this city.
So where're you from?

Quent:
From the ends of the earth. I came here looking for wolves.

Troop member #4:
The old guy says he's a wolf hunter!

Troop member:
Gimme a break!

Troop member #2:
Too bad for him there's no bounties to be had around here, at least not anymore.

Quent:
I ain't here for that. Besides, what difference would a bounty make?

Troop member #1:
Sorry about that, old man... We didn't mean to laugh at you, it's just that...
It looks like you got here a little late.
There aren't any wolves. My men and I have already killed almost all of 'em.

Troop member #4:
We just got a "mission complete" notification. It was handed down to us from Lady Jaguara herself.

Troop member:
Maybe you don't realise who you've been talking to.
We're Special Ops. Anti-wolf.

Troop member #3:
You feel free to look for 'em if you want, but trust me, pal, you're not gonna find any.

Quent:
Those things aren't that easy to kill.
There are still wolves around here. I know it for a fact.

Toboe:
Hey, how come there isn't any scent in this place?

Hige:
Who knows? Maybe that "Jaguara" lady's a clean freak.

Toboe:
Wait up, would you?
What's the matter?

Hige:
Every time I try to think, my head starts pounding...

Toboe:
Probably not used to the strain is all.
Hige, please. Tell me what's wrong.

Hige:
Nothing's wrong, okay?

Toboe:
Come on, you've been acting weird since we got here.

Hige:
Get off my back, will you!

Toboe:
Hige!
Hige?
Hige!
Hige!
Hige!

Man:
Thief!

Kiba:
Remind you of anyone? Even this city has people like the old you.

Tsume:
Yeah, looks that way.
But it's guys like that who know the back alleys better than anyone.

Skater #1:
What the hell do you want?

Tsume:
I want to talk.

Skater #1:
Keep walking, pal! I'm not in the mood for hand-outs.
Go get your own food!

Tsume:
I just want to ask you a question.

Skater #1:
Look, I'm tired and hungry, so leave me alone.
What's the deal?
Hey, if you guys want a fight, that's fine by me.

Skater #2:
You're the man...

Skater #1:
Alright, I give. You guys are too tough to argue with.
So where are you from, anyway?

Tsume:
Oh, here and there.

Skater #1:
I know the feeling. Me and Verbal here have been wandering from dome to dome ever since the fat hit the fire.
They said this one was the best of the lot, so we decided to check it out.
I can't say that I agree with them. Can you?
So, you got a question? Fire away.

Tsume:
We're trying to get into the keep. Is there a way to do it without being spotted?

Skater #1:
Are you guys nuts? You don't mean Lady Jaguara's keep, do you?

Tsume:
Uh-huh.

Skater #1:
Forget it.
I know you're strong and all, but not even the two of you could get in there.
Why the hell would you even want to do it in the first place?

Tsume:
They stole a woman from us.

Skater #1:
And you wanna steal her back from that Noble?
You must really think I'm a sucker!

Kiba:
We're serious.

Skater #1:
That's suicide. You can't mess around with a Noble...
Especially Lady Jaguara. Word on the street is she's some kind of witch who casts all these wacked-out spells...

Kiba:
We don't care who or what she is.
We came all this way to save Cheza. And there's nothing they can do to stop us.

Skater #1:
Man, you guys are asking for a whole mess of trouble, you know that?
But hey, if that's what you want, it's not like I give a crap.
We can show you the way in, but that's all.

Kiba:
That'll be enough. Once we're in, I'm sure we can handle the rest of ourselves.

Skater #1:
Damn, you're cool!

Skater #2:
He's the man...

Man:
What is this, some kind of shakedown?
You bitches tricked me!

Blue:
Do you want to get slapped again?

Man:
Alright, enough already! Fine, you can have them.
Here. Now get lost!

Blue:
If you'd done this in the first place, you never would've gotten yourself hurt.

Cher:
Beautiful flowers always have thorns.
You would do well to remember that.

Skater #1:
This is it.
No one's ever followed it all the way to the end before, but the cables around here definitely run underneath the keep. Any luck, they should get you in.

Tsume:
Right.

Skater #1:
Some guy told me that these things are supposed to carry energy into the city or something.

Tsume:
Do you feel that?

Kiba:
Yeah. It's the complete opposite of basking in the moonlight.

Tsume:
It feels like my strength's being sucked out.
And something tells me it's only gonna get worse up ahead.

Kiba:
I know.

Skater #1:
Listen... Are you really going in there?

Kiba:
Yeah.

Tsume:
Thanks for the help, guys.

Kiba:
You know, Tsume. The others might be waiting for us.

Tsume:
Do you want to turn back?
Then let's keep going.
Knowing Hige, I'm sure he'll catch up with us sooner or later.
We just need to have a little faith.

Skater #2:
Good luck wolves. You can do it.

Hige:
Damn it...
What the hell is wrong with me? Why am I...

Troop member:
#23, huh?

Troop member:
Doesn't look like any others are with him.

Hige:
Why did they spare me?
I don't get it.
My head... What's going on?

-Ending-

Hige:
Damn, my head hurts!
At times like this, a little temple rub from a cute girl would fix me up in a flash...
Oh well. There's no sense in dreaming.
Guess I'll have to try some pickled plums.
