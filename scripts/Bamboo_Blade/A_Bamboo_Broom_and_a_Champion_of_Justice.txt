Toraji:
 A challenge? Alright, you're on!
 I'll gather five brave warriors and assemble a force that will be UNSTOPPABLE!!
---
Toraji:
 Tonight? Sure, if it's after 9 o'clock. Sounds good, senpai. I'll see you then.
 Kirino, do you mind?

Kirino:
 We're in a dojo, sensei! Maybe you shouldn't be taking calls in here!
 Was that your girlfriend?

Toraji:
 Yeah. How'd you know?

Kirino:
 Then how come you were calling her "senpai"?

Toraji:
 So you were snooping.

Kirino:
 Come on! You need to teach me more!
 You owe it to me and the rest of the team because if we don't get crackin', how're we gonna make it to nationals, huh!?
 Uwaaaaaaaaaah!!

Toraji:
 I agree completely, but every upperclassman left the team except for you.
 Just hang in there until we get some new members.

Kirino:
 Wait a sec, you're not leaving, are you?
 You promised me an hours worth of sparring!

 Toraji:
 I'm hungry. I'm not in the mood.

Kirino:
 Hmph. You call yourself a teacher? Then TEACH!

Toraji:
 This club is extracurricular. The entire point is not to win but to have fun, so why don't you just hang out and take it easy?

Kirino:
 I don't want to hang out when we have a tournament to win! SPAR WITH ME! Men! Men! Men! Men! Men! MEN! MEN!!

Toraji:
 Ow, that hurts! What're you, a sadist!? You just wanna hit me, don't you? OWWW!!!
---
Toraji:
I have no money. And it's not like I'm just short for the money; I'm literally broke.
I don't even have enough money to eat this week.

...I'm pathetic.

Wow. How do you pull off teaching at two different schools at the same time?

Kenzaburou:
 Ah, I find a way. Now tell me I'm amazing.

Toraji:
I don't have a problem saying it, senpai. You're amazing. You have the chops to run for political office!

Kenzaburou:
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

Toraji:
Ha ha ha ha ha...
(There's no WAY I could afford all this.
I'll just butter up his ego, get him nice and toasty and he'll foot the bill at the end of the night. Piece of cake.)
We'll take one more round!

Kenzaburou:
 I got a good team of girls lined up for this year. You have a kendo team yourself, don't you? We should have a match sometime.

Toraji:
Yeah! Any time!
Problem is, we only have one girl at the moment, but as soon as we fill out the roster, it's on.

Kenzaburou:
 Kojirou.
 Are you a betting man?

Toraji:
A challenge? Alright, you're on! I'll gather five brave warriors and assemble a force that will be unstoppable!
---
Toraji:
HAAAAAAAH!!

 Kirino:
 Ah! Whoa, hold on a sec!

Toraji:
Move your feet!
Firm up your wrist!
Tuck in that chin!
Come on, Kirino! What happened to your fighting spirit!?
SHOW ME WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF!!!

Student A:
 What's up with those maniacs?

 Student B:
 Scary....

Kirino:
 Geez, sensei, where'd you get all that energy? You're a lot more agressive than yesterday....

Toraji:
I'm pumped up! You said it yourself, Kirino. If we want to make it to nationals, we need to get to work!

Kirino:
 Really!?

Toraji:
As captain of the team, you need to get stronger so you can attract more people into joining.

Kirino:
 Yes, sir! I will work harder!

 Student A:
 Excuse me, but can we join your club? We'd like to give it a try.

Toraji:
GET LOST! We don't need any BOYS on this club, now SCRAM!

Student A:
 Okay, okay!

Kirino:
 Whaaa?
---
Toraji:
The match is against a team of girls. That's why, NO BOYS.

Kirino:
 What match?

Toraji:
Oh. I guess I forgot to tell you, but I set up a practice match against my senpai's kendo team.
So it's important that we get four more girls to join our team. Then we'll become an unstoppable force of nature!

Kirino:
 Ooooh!

Toraji:
But I'm gonna need your help. I need you to convince Saya to come back.

Kirino:
 Well...the chances of her coming back anytime soon are not looking good.
---
Kirino:
 What's up?

Yuuji:
 Is it alright if we observe you guys for a while?

Toraji:
NO! NO BOYS ALLOWED!
AGH!

Kirino:
 Why waste your time observing when you can join the club and start kicking butt? Better sign up before the roster fills!

Yuuji:
 Oh, okay.

Danjuurou:
 Nakada, you said you were gonna come with me to check out the ping pong club today, don't you remember?

 Yuuji:
 Yeah, of course I still remember. We'll go and check it out real soon.

 Danjuurou:
 I hope so. Those ping pong guys are scarier than you think.

Yuuji:
 Is this...everyone?

Kirino:
 The seniors basically retired to start their college prep, but we're expecting some sophomores to join soon.

Danjuurou:
 Looks like no one even wants to join this club, Nakada. We'll probably have better luck with the ping pong club.

Yuuji:
 Yeah, but I actually really like kendo.
 Well, it is kinda dead in here today, so maybe I'll just come back tomorrow.

Danjuurou:
 Let's get out of here.
---
Toraji:
Hey, Kirino?

Kirino:
 Yeah, what is it?

Toraji:
I'm a horrible teacher. I always put my own needs above my students.
But you know...life can be hard when you're an adult...with responsibilities.
You wouldn't happen to have any spare light bulbs lying around I could borrow, would you?
---
Toraji:
Ugh...I wish there was a way we could single out all the good athletes.

Kirino:
 I know exactly what we can do! We find people that're holding sticks similar to a shinai, then start throwing rocks at them!
 Anyone that can handle a blade will knock 'em down easily.

Toraji:
I don't think assaulting people is the way to go.

Kirino:
 Oh, come on...what do I care, I'm already happy! You getting motivated for my sake is just so sweet!

Boy A:
 Heads up!
 Baseball coming in!

 Boy B:
 Tennis ball coming in!

 Boy C:
 Rugby ball on the loose!

 Boy D:
 Vice-principal just fell out of the 3rd-storey window!

Kirino:
 Uh!

Vice-principal:
UWA!

Boy A:
 Home run!

 Girl:
 Holy crap! Did you see that? That was crazy! Are they shooting a movie or something?

Toraji:
Hey, wait up! Would you be interested in joining the kendo club?

Tamaki:
 Kendo?

Toraji:
Your natural ability is unbelievable!

Tamaki:
 I'm not interested.

Toraji:
She's not...interested?

I don't believe it! It's impossible! She's no ordinary girl!
Aha! There you are. Tamaki Kawazoe...you WILL join my team!
---
Man A:
 So strong.

Tamaki's father:
 That's enough. Good work. Very nicely done.

Tamaki:
 Thank you for sparring with me.

Man B:
 She didn't even break a sweat!

 Man A:
 She's crazy!

 Man C:
 What is she, a robot?

Tamaki:
 I made supper.

Tamaki's father:
 It smells really good.

Tamaki:
 There's enough for you, too, dad. You'll just have to warm it up in the microwave.

Tamaki's father:
 Thanks.
 So, Tamaki...are you going to join the kendo team at your school?

Tamaki:
 What would be the point of that?

Tamaki's father:
 Well, because....

Tamaki:
 I do kendo at home everyday.

Tamaki's father:
 I know that, but I think if you did it at school as well, it would give you a chance to have some fun with other students.
 I don't mean to push you.

Tamaki:
 I'm gonna go to my room. The dishes are soaking; I'll finish washing them later.

Tamaki's father:
 If only her mother were still with us...she could help me understand what she's going through.
---
Comedian A:
 One problem.

 Comedian B:
 Oh, what's that?

Tamaki:
 I recorded the wrong show. Too bad. Well, ?....

Comedian A:
 Are you following the recipe?

 Comedian B:
 Who needs a recipe? You said so yourself, it's easy. Besides, I'm usually playing a game with my other hand.

 Comedian A:
 So you're putting in zero effort! You should apologize to the gods of curry!

 Comedian B:
 Ooh, I'd sure come back to nice and spicy today.

 Comedian A:
 Well, if your jokes are all gonna be as bad as your food, we are gonna be in major trouble.

Tamaki:
 That was funny.

アイキャッチ
Kirino: I'm Kirino Chiba! Captain of the kendo team!

Yuuji:
 My name is Nakada. We came by here yesterday, remember?

Toraji:
You came back!

Kirino:
 Name and class, please!

Yuuji:
 I'm sorry. My friend's a little upset.

Kirino:
 Why's he crying?

Yuuji:
 Turns out...there never was a ping pong club.

Toraji:
Well, yeah. I could've told you that.

Kirino:
 Uh-huh. It's pretty common knowledge.

Danjuurou:
 It's not fair, I wanna play ping pong!

Kirino:
 Can't you see what's happening? They brought you here so you could join the kendo team!

Danjuurou:
 But I've never kendoed before.

Kirino:
 That's okay! Ping pong paddles and kendo swords are both made of wood, so....

Toraji:
(That's a stretch.)

Kirino:
 Just because you're a beginner doesn't mean you can't join.
 Kendo makes the summers hotter and the winters colder and the equipment kinda stinks, but that won't stop you from having fun!

Toraji:
Oh, and by the way, if you have a girlfriend, perhaps she would be interested in joining the team as well.

Yuuji:
 Sorry, I don't have a girlfriend.

Danjuurou:
 I have one. I could ask her.

Toraji:
Huh?

Danjuurou:
 Last time I talked to her, she hadn't picked a club yet.

Toraji & Yuuji:
You have a girlfriend!?
---
Danjuurou:
 Kirino, can I hold the bamboo sword? I wanna swing one like a ninja!

Kirino:
 No! You're gonna be busy for a while doing strength training!

Danjuurou:
 What!?

Yuuji:
I think I'm gonna have to buy one of these for myself.

Danjuurou:
 Hey, no fair! How come Nakada can play with the sword and not me? What makes him so special?

Kirino:
 It's not that he's more special, he just has more training! How long have you been in kendo?

Yuuji:
 I was on my middle school's team all 3 years, and I used to take classes when I was in grade school.

Kirino:
 Yeah? Where at?

Yuuji:
 At the Kawazoe Dojo.

Toraji:
THE KAWAZOE DOJO!??!
TANAKA!!

Yuuji:
 Uh, it's Nakada.

Toraji:
SO IT SEEMS MY EXPERT RECRUITING SENSES PAID OFF!!

Yuuji:
 I wasn't recruited. I joined on my own!

Danjuurou:
 Sensei, I wanna put on the armor and play with the sword, too! Can I? Please?

Toraji:
YEAH, SURE. GO AHEAD AND DO WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANT! I DON'T CARE! KIRINO, GET HIM SUITED UP!
---
Toraji:
Was there a girl about your age that went to the same dojo as you?

Yuuji:
 Oh. You mean Tamaki?

Toraji:
Yeah, yeah, that's the one. Tamaki Kawazoe, she's a freshman, right? She's incredible. I ran into her yesterday and I can't get her out of my mind.

Yuuji:
 Uh, why?

Toraji:
I need you to do me a favor. Get her to join the team.

Yuuji:
 You want me to recruit Tama? Uh, she doesn't have much interest in this kind of stuff.

Toraji:
What?

Yuuji:
 I asked her the same thing back when we were in junior high together. She just doesn't see the point. I think to her, kendo is like a chore she does when she's home instead of being something fun to do. It's just the way she is.

Toraji:
I see. So she's a tough one to crack. What do you think it'll take to get her to join?

Yuuji:
 Mr. Ishida, why're you so desperate to recruit Tamaki?

Toraji:
Because we won't get very far without her. No. Without her, we don't have a chance at winning.

Yuuji:
 It would help if you told me what's really going on.

Toraji:
It's a bet.
---
Toraji:
A bet?

Kenzaburou:
 I gotta say, my team's lookin' pretty good this year. Now if your little girls can win this match, I'll give you unlimited, free meals at my old man's restaurant for a year.

Toraji:
Authentic Tokyo-style sushi! All I can eat! It's free...!

Kenzaburou's father:
 Hey! Have a seat!

Toraji:
Authentic Tokyo-style sushi! All I can eat! It's free!

Kenzaburou's father:
 Koujirou! The usual?

Toraji:
AUTHENTIC TOKYO-STYLE SUSHI! ALL I CAN EAT! IT'S FREE! THERE IS A GOD!

Kenzaburou's father:
 The sky's the limit, Koujirou! ANYTHING YOU WANT!!

Toraji:
I'm willing to do whatever it takes to win, because if we do, I'll get all the sushi I want!

Yuuji:
 Geez, this guy's pathetic...and desperate. He's incredibly self-centered. He's not thinking about his students at all, it's just all about him. I guess I just assumed all teachers were more grounded than that. Boy, was I wrong.
---
Yuuji:
 Tama! Headin' home late today, huh?

Tamaki:
 Yep. I skipped the dojo today and went out shopping, but I couldn't find it on sale anywhere.

Yuuji:
 What were you trying to find?

Tamaki:
 A DVD. It's a limited-edition box set, but they'd already sold out of them. I was busy on the pre-order day, so I wasn't able to reserve one in time.

Yuuji:
 Hmm..
 Tama...you think you...

Tamaki:
 What?

Toraji:
I'll get all the sushi I want!

Yuuji:
 Oh. Nevermind. It's nothing, really.

Tamaki:
 Hm.

Yuuji:
 See ya.

Tamaki:
 Yuuji?

Yuuji:
 Yeah?

Tamaki:
 Would you please stop calling me Tama? I'm too old for that.

Yuuji:
 Then, what should I....
 Tamaki...Kawazoe? But that's what I've always called her. Ah, she must've been kidding. I'll stick with Tama.

---

Toraji:
Eiga's girlfriend, huh?

Kirino:
 I wonder what she's like!

Yuuji:
 Apparently, they've been a couple since junior high.

Toraji:
Not to be rude, but I'm just curious to know what kind of girl would go out with him. The more I wait, the more I doubt she even exists. For all we know, she could be a figment of his imagination.

Yuuji:
 Oh, I'm sure she's real, but I think she's more his friend than his girlfriend, know what I mean?

Kirino:
 You know, this may come as a shock to you boys, but guys like him tend to get some really cute girls!

Toraji:
It's gotta be a balance! A couple that's too good-looking pisses me off, but an ugly pair's just depressing. A couple's looks should combine to a hundred points. If a guy is a 30, his girl should be a 70. If a girl is a 10, the guy should be a 90. The world would be a better place if people stuck to this rule.

Kirino & Yuuji:
Wow. Sounds like someone has some issues.

Toraji:
That means, she's probably a total babe.

Yuuji:
 We'll see.

Danjuurou:
 Sorry, I'm late! Look! I brought Miya-Miya with me!

Miyako:
 Nice to meet you. I'm Miyako Miyazaki.

Toraji & Yuuji:
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!!
---
Iwasa:
 Toyama? What're you doing, can you still not find your cell?

Toyama:
 I must've dropped it in History class. Let's get outta here.

Iwasa:
 Okay....

Boy:
Hey, Toyama. Here. I think this is your cell phone. Sorry, but I must've taken it by mistake. I have the exact same phone.

 Iwasa:
 Not good....

Toyama:
 Thanks a lot.

Boy:
Sure...UGH!

Iwasa:
 What a shame.

---

Yuuji:
 Uh, I should probably be practicing right now.

Toraji:
You and I need to do some brainstorming. We need to work up a strategy to recruit Tamaki.
You, get the applications, find Miya-Miya, and have her fill one out, okay? She could be a valuable asset to the team.

Kirino:
 Aye-aye, sir!

Iwasa:
 Hey, what's up, Koujirou?

Toraji:
Where have you two clowns been? Quit playing hooky, and come back to practice!

Iwasa:
 Sorry. We're kinda busy today.

Kirino:
 They're upperclassmen.

Yuuji:
 Oh.

Toyama:
 Kirino. Did he really make you the new captain?

Kirino:
 That's right. And we got some fresh blood on the team. They'll take your spot if you're not careful.

Toyama:
 Hmph.
---
Danjuurou:
 Check out my totally sweet ninja moves, babe!

Miyako:
 Oh, Danny, you're the coolest!

Toyama:
 The battery's dead.

Iwasa:
 Dang. You had one hell of a day, dude.

Toyama:
 Ehm! This sucks.

Danjuurou:
 Check this out! Thrust!

Miyako:
 Will you protect me, Danny? Kill 'em for me! Yeah!

Toyama:
 I think I'll blow off some steam in the dojo.
---
Toraji:
What are we missing? There's gotta be something we can do, I'm running out of ideas here!

Yuuji:
 I don't know.

Kirino:
 Heeey! Tama! We met the other day. I'm Kirino Chiba. I'm captain of the kendo team. Nice to meet you!

Tamaki:
 Hi.

Kirino:
 Have you picked a club yet? Why not join the kendo team?

 Tamaki:
 I'm not really interested.

Kirino:
 I know! But how could you know for sure unless you see what we have to offer?
 Come on! Let me show you how awesome our team is!

Tamaki:
 I'd rather not, actually.

---

Danjuurou:
 Omph! Leave me alone!

Toyama:
 Stand up, freshman. Your senpai isn't quite done with today lesson. Let's work on wrist strikes.

Miyako:
 Will you please make him stop? He's hurting him!

Iwasa:
 Take it easy!

Kirino:
 Toyama! I leave you alone for one minute and you're already picking fights with freshmen!?

Toyama:
 I'm just taking the initiative to start the rookie on some training. Now leave us alone, we're doing our own thing here.
 On your feet, freshman. I'll teach you throat strikes.

Kirino:
 I better go get sensei...

Tamaki:
 Why's that? You're the captain, Kirino, so why can't you just tell him to stop?

Kirino:
 It's just that he's the strongest member of our team, so he kinda does what he wants. A few have even quit because of him.

Tamaki:
 So he thinks he's in charge just because he's the strongest?
 I understand.

Yuuji:
 Most of the time, Tama's really quiet and prefers to keep to herself, but she's also very idealistic. She's always had a thing for superheros and stuff like that, so if she thinks you're a bad guy, watch out.

Tamaki:
 I am the freshman Tamaki Kawazoe...joining on a trial basis.



次回予告
Kirino: The new school year is giving me the push I need to start working harder than ever! Unfortunately, our newest member has been a target of hazing from a veteran on the team! Suddenly, a pretty, purple-eyed warrior calls out for him to stop! And it's none other than Tama! Have you met Tama? Whaddaya think of her heroic grace? Pretty striking, isn't it? She's a tough, little cookie. When the situation seems dire, she springs into action! Are you hungry? We should totally do lunch! Next time on Bamboo Blade, the plate goes to you with "The Blade Bravers and Boxed Lunch!" See ya then!
