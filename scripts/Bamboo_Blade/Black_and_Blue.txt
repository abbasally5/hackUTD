Toraji:
Alright, listen up! The match is approaching. Starting tomorrow, we'll be training during lunch. To maximize time, we'll be eating here in the dojo. I will be joining you as well, so don't forget to bring your lunch with you, and be sure to pack more food than normal to keep your energy up.





Toraji:
Miya-Miya, this extra practice is mostly for YOUR benefit. You're still a novice, and we're throwing you into a match very quickly, so you need all the training you can get.















Toraji:
Okay. Everyone get changed into your street clothes. Today, we're going shopping for protective gear.


Toraji:
Hello! Hey, there!







Toraji:
Yes, sir. We need to get them some protective gear and shinai.



Toraji:
Well...
...this guy's a little too old-school for me. I asked him to coach the team for a day once and things got kinda out of hand. He got so into it, he ended up pummeling all the kids into the ground like he was a drill sergeant. When he left, he had this look on his face like he was a warrior that just defeated an army all by himself. Was really something to behold.
But the next day at school, the kids used me as a verbal punching bag! I'm not going through that again!



Toraji:
Uh-ha...you're such a busy man that I don't want to take up any of your time.






Toraji:
Dan. Miya-Miya. We'll start with the shinai. The rest of you, feel free to look around.











Toraji:
The lengths may all be the same, but the weights are all pretty different from sword to sword. Try testing as many as you can to find the weight that works for you. So you guys should pick up a couple and give 'em a good swing.





Toraji:
Hey, put those down!



Toraji, Kirino, Yuuji:
(shock)

Toraji:
Uh...

Toraji:
Now on to chest guards, also called dos. They're pretty much all the same.
Although for the girls who have breasts, we may need to buy a size up.



Toraji:
W-what!? I was just stating a fact!



Toraji:
Hands off! Those things are expensive!


















Toraji:
Hey, thanks for helping me out back there. That guy can be a little pushy at times.



Toraji:
You know what? I'm glad you joined the team, but I'm sure it must be hard juggling school with the duties at your father's dojo.





Toraji:
Thanks for all your help, Sakaguchi.

Miyako and Danjuurou:
Thank you, sir!








Toraji:
My team's just about ready to go. We should still be on target for the match early next month.



Toraji:
Oh. I hadn't thought about that. Do I need to offer something?



Toraji:
Hey, wait a second. Whaddaya mean?



Toraji:
MY SNES!?



Toraji:
My trophy?



Toraji:
UWAAH!
Oh, please. It's hardly a prize possession. If it were, I would've unpacked it when I moved into this place.
Young Toraji:
HAA...ME-E-EN!!



Young Toraji:
Sorry, senpai. That point was a fluke. I think I just got lucky.



Young Toraji:
Yes, sir!



Young Toraji:
But the season's already over, senpai. Oh, I get it. You just can't live with the fact that I won our last match with a lucky hit. Let's do it; I'll even bet the trophy I just won.



Young Toraji:
Whoops.

Toraji:
(Ever since then...)



Toraji:
(Your eyes are serious.)
Senpai...although I may not have said this back then, I know...
...there is no such thing as luck in kendo. That day, our last official match together, I was better than you. This trophy means nothing to me, but if it's what you want, then by all means, it's yours.

HOLY CRAP! Uwahaah!?
Now I definitely can't lose this match...!

Miyako: All aboard! Next stop: Miya-Miya!

Toraji:
Where is everyone?



















---

Toraji:
Check everything and make sure you got exactly what you ordered...and, uh, you all owe me some money now, too. I've got a bill for each of you.



Toraji:
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

Kirino, Yuuji, Tamaki, Miyako, and Danjuurou:
You want us...to give you...our money?

Toraji:
Hey, now! What's with all the dirty looks? I said I'd take care of it.
Whatever. Anyway, come on, try on your gear.

Kirino, Yuuji, Tamaki, Miyako, and Danjuurou:
You want us...to give you...our money?

Toraji:
LOOK, YOUR MONEY'S SAFE WITH ME, I'M NOT GONNA STEAL IT!






Toraji:
But not if you put on your gauntlets beforehand.















---

Toraji:
Tama, you'll be Red.



Toraji:
Exactly. This team I have assembled to defeat my senpai are called the "Warriors of Justice", and the leader of the Warriors of Justice is you, Red.







Toraji:
Hmm. Let me think. I'll make you...Yellow! Look at your hair, it oozes yellow!





Toraji:
Miya-Miya is...Pink! Without a doubt.



Toraji:
Uh...what the...?
(Am I crazy or was she just covered in a black cloud?)



Toraji:
Sayako! She's Blue, and the last member will be Green. I will lead you as Commander Kojirou, to victory and beyond!

Kirino, Yuuji, Tamaki, Miyako, and Danjuurou:
Commander...Kojirou? For real?

Toraji:
Why do you guys keep doing that!?


Toraji:
You? If I had to say...you're Yellow.





Toraji:
Well, it's just for this match, so just think of it as building team unity. And by the way, Kirino, is there any news on the Blue front?





Toraji:
Naah. That's kinda how she is. You'll see for yourself soon enough. In the meantime, why doesn't everyone try on their nafuda, those customized name cloths? Here you go. Just tuck it in to your hip protector.





Toraji:
What's wrong, Pink?







Toraji:
It says "Eikou" instead of "Eiga".
You know, it's actually pretty ironic considering it's THAT weird, little guy.


























Toraji:
Danny, make sure Miya-Miya comes with you tomorrow. Out of everyone on the team, she needs the most work to get up to speed.





























次回予告
Miya-Miya: Hey! I'm Miya-Miya and I absolutely love kendo! It's so much fun, but I'm still just a beginner!  You wanna know why it's fun? You get to BEAT people with a stick, and the best part: it's totally legal! VIVA VIOLENCE! You get stronger physically AND mentally as well!  Seeing the pain on my opponent's face after I destroy them makes the sadist in me smile! You get to learn about teamwork and it really helps you mature as a person and stuff!  What she meant to say is I'll do anything as long as Danny-boy's by my side! Well, I hope you tune in next time for "Pink and Blue"!  All you sicko masochists should TUNE IN FOR SURE!
