Kirino:
 So, goodbye!

Schoolmate A:
 Take it easy!

Kirino:
 Later!

Schoolmate B:
 See ya tomorrow!

Kirino:
 Goodbye! Goodbye!

Schoolmate C:
 Huh!?

 Schoolmate D:
 Look at her...so happy.

 Schoolmate E:
 Yeah. Chiba's kinda always like that. Plus, I heard she's been having a really good time with her team lately.

 Schoolmate D:
 Huh? Weird, I didn't think kendo could be that much fun. Maybe that means I should've joined the kendo team instead of the pottery club.

 Schoolmate E:
 Hold on. You know, summer's coming up?

 Schoolmate D:
 Yeah. so?

 Schoolmate E:
 The gear starts to stink.

 Schoolmate D:
 Ugh, you're right. I never thought about that. So that means....

Kirino:
 Bye, you guys!

Group of schoolmates:
 See ya!

Kirino:
 Uhmm....

Toraji:
Wait a minute, this is too sudden! W-what? It can't wait? It would just be better for me next month. Really? Okay. Next week, then.

Yuuji:
 Sensei?

Toraji:
Oh, I'm sorry. Didn't know you were here.

Yuuji:
 We can't do anything to help you with the money and I'm really sorry about that...but stay strong and try not to let the pressure get you down.

Toraji:
Oh! No, I'm not having any financial problems!

Danjuurou:
 Here, sensei, you can have this. Please, you need to eat!

Toraji:
I do NOT need your charity! But...that was a very sweet thought, guys. Thanks a lot!

Yuuji:
 (He took it. He must really be struggling.)

Toraji:
We've got one week.

Yuuji:
 Is that when your next payment is due?

Toraji:
I told you, this is not about money! I'm talking about the girls' practice match! My senpai is bringing his team! It's happening! It's next week!

Kirino:
 A practice match!?

Sayako:
 Next week?

Miyako:
 But wait, our team only has four members right now. Aren't we short by one person for a team match?

Toraji:
Don't worry, ladies. I've got everything under control.
Toraji:
We don't have much time to prepare, so suck it up and give it everything you've got. And don't think that just because this is a practice match, I'm gonna let you off easy!
Tama, you come over here.

Tamaki:
 Hm?

Toraji:
I'll spar with you today.

Sayako:
 Me! Me! Please, sir! I wanna be Tama's opponent! I still haven't seen how strong she is! I know you're new here and all, but you have a lot of experience, right?

Tamaki:
 Well, I...um....

Toraji:
Hm. Alright. Sure. You'll be a great first sparring partner for her.

Sayako:
 Cool!

---

Sayako:
 Now, I want you to come at me for real, Tama!

Tamaki:
 For real....

Toraji:
(I hope Tama knows that just because Saya said to use full force doesn't mean she has to--)

Tamaki:
 ME-E-EN! ME-E-EN! ME-E-EN!

Toraji:
(Nope. I should've known better. I think this one could use a lesson in restraint before she'd kill someone.)

Sayako:
 I'm no good anymore! I suck! And I just got my butt kicked by a freshman! It's my fault! I've gotten rusty! I suck! I SUCK! I'm no good! No good at all!

Toraji:
Come on, Saya. You know that Tama here is a special case...aren't you?

Tamaki:
 I'm sorry.

Kirino:
 It's all good! I mean, Tama didn't do anything wrong, did she?

Toraji:
What're you guys doing? Why aren't you practicing!?

Yuuji:
 Well, because...

Kirino:
 ...we thought it might be better practice to just watch Tama fight, sir!

Toraji:
Ugh, really? Okay, whatever, gather around! There are a couple of decisions we need to make.
Kenzaburou:
 Girls, I need the five of you in the match to gather around.

Toraji and Kenzaburou:
We're going to determine the match order.

Toraji:
Now, first position...Tama, it's all you.

Tamaki:
 Yes, sir.

Kirino:
 Uhmm...but sensei, I thought I was always first position.

Toraji:
That was before you were team captain...and captain serve as commanders!

Kirino:
 Oh, commander!

Toraji:
Uh, yeah....
(I'm gonna have to figure out some way to outwit him. We just don't have the fighting power to go head to head.)

Danjuurou:
 If Tama's the best player we've got on our team, do we really want her going out there and fighting first?

Yuuji:
 Oh, yeah. Because an early win is always great for building up the team's morale. We want a strong person to go up there first, but it's also a good idea to have a really tough point person.
 Now we only have four players, so one way to do it would be to forfeit the final match against their strongest fighter and match up our best against their weakest links.

Danjuurou:
 Wow. Kendo's kinda rough, huh?

Toraji:
It's strategy, my dear boy!
But I suppose there's no point in trying too hard in overthinking it. Knowing him, he'll probably guess exactly what I'm gonna do anyway.

---

Kenzaburou:
 Kojirou, I bet I know exactly what you're gonna do. You're gonna put your big guns on deputy and second-in-command. I'm afraid your senpai knows you too well, don't I? The poor guy, he really thinks he has some kind of shot. Sorry, Kojirou, but I'll just have to show you what sort of show I'm running at Machido Private High School.

Yokoo:
 Uh, what's sensei mumbling about?

Ando:
 No clue.

Kenzaburou:
 Harada.

Harada:
 Yes, sir!?

Kenzaburou:
 I'm trusting you to lead off. I want you to smoke 'em.

Harada:
 Sir!

Kenzaburou:
 For deputy, I, uh...where's Asakawa?

Harada:
 Oh, I'm pretty sure she left when everyone else did. She said her boyfriend was waiting for her.

Ando:
 That girl is such a ditz. I wish she'd just drop dead.

Yokoo:
 Hey, quiet....

Harada:
 I don't get it. She could be such a great player if she'd only get serious about training.

Kenzaburou:
 Agh, this is hopeless! This happens every time!
Toraji:
Miya will be our deputy.

Miyako:
 Yes, sir.

Danjuurou:
 Ya-a-ay!

Toraji:
I'm sorry, I realize it's not really fair to throw you in like this. Once we get past this match, we'll spend plenty of time training, but I still want you in the line-up, even if it's just a formality.

Miyako:
 Yes, sir. I'm happy to participate.

Danjuurou:
 Come on! We should go and start practicing right now, Miya-Miya!

Miyako:
 Yeah!

Toraji:
For center, we'll go with Saya.

Sayako:
 Yes! Oh, it's been so long, I just can't wait! I'll do my best, sir!

Toraji:
Just make sure you win.

Sayako:
 Yes, sir! I know I can win! Don't worry.

Toraji:
You'd better win for sure, Saya.

Sayako:
 Uh....

Toraji:
WI-I-I-I-I-IN!!! DO I-I-I-I-IT!!!

---

Kenzaburou:
 Center, Nishiyama.
 You are gonna be able to keep it together, right?

Harada:
 Oh, yes, sir, she'll be great! Won't you, Nishi?

Nishiyama:
 Yeah. I'll do my best....

Kenzaburou:
 I don't understand, you do so well at practice, but we haven't seen any of it in competition.

Yokoo:
 You know, I don't think Nishiyama's even competed in a serious tournament before.

Ando:
 It's weird 'cause she's good enough to be commander.

 Nishiyama:
 I...it's just...to smack around someone I just met with a bamboo sword isn't very...well, it's not very nice...at all...it's horrible...! I can't! I can't do it!

 Yokoo:
 Then why the hell did you join the kendo team!?

Kenzaburou:
 There, there. Don't worry, Nishiyama, we'll tackle that mental weakness of yours. Giving us a strong fight in the practice match should do the trick, right?

Nishiyama:
 Okay...I'll try....

Kenzaburou:
 Ando, you're second-in-command.

Ando:
 Okay.

Kenzaburou:
 Now I expect you to behave, young lady.

Ando:
 Of course I will, sir.

Kenzaburou:
 Don't play dumb! None of your sneaky little tricks!

Ando:
 Uh, whaddaya mean?

Kenzaburou:
 Like, no stomping on your opponent's foot or shoving them so hard they fall down....

Ando:
 Oh, those things.

Kenzaburou:
 Mm-hmm. I'm serious.

Ando:
 But sir, I would never do something like that on purpose.

Kenzaburou:
 Mm-hmm....

Yokoo:
 What a liar!
Toraji:
Second-in-command is Kirino.

Kirino:
 I'm second?

Toraji:
Second-in-command.

Kirino:
 Second?

Toraji:
Yes. Second.

Kirino:
 But you said team captains are supposed to be commanders.

Toraji:
Well, sure. If we had enough people, you would be, but we only have four team members, so it's a special circumstance. We'll just try it for this match, okay? You'll be great!

Yuuji:
 Hey, it's actually pretty good strategy.

Kirino:
 Yeah, I know, and I'm sure the other team will probably have their strongest fighter in the commander position, but I still wanted to do it....

Toraji:
Come on, it's not that dramatic.

---

Kenzaburou:
 Yokoo, commander.

Yokoo:
 Yes! The commander, man, that's freakin' rules! Don't worry, sensei, I'm totally ready for the responsibility.

Kenzaburou:
 I want you to listen to me very carefully: you're gonna be fighting a girl and I don't want you to make her cry.

Yokoo:
 Hahahahaha! But sir, I'm a girl, too!

Kenzaburou:
 Well, that should do it. I think it'll work.
 Just win!

Harada, Yokoo, Nishiyama, Ando, and Asakawa:
Yes, sir!
Yuuji:
 Men!

Tamaki:
 Men!

Yuuji:
 Wait...hold on. I need a time out, Tama.

Toraji:
Sorry about this, Yuuji, but you're the only one who can really match up against Tama and give her a real workout.

Yuuji:
 Huh...well, I'm done. Come on, switch places with me, sensei.

Toraji:
Alright. Let's do this, Tama. You sure you don't need a break?

Tamaki:
 No. I'm fine.

Toraji:
So, listen. No matter what happens, I absolutely have to win against my senpai. Unfortunately, our team only has four members...which is a huge disadvantage, maybe even a crisis, right?

Tamaki:
 Right.

Toraji:
But you see, there actually is someone else. Our team has one more person, a fifth member. This fighter appears out of nowhere in the hour of need and battles to save the people! A champion of justice known to mortals as...BLADE BRAVER.

Tamaki:
 Huh?

アイキャッチ
Kirino: Wait a second, I'm SECOND-IN-COMMAND?
Toraji: For the last time, YES.

Young Toraji:
HAA...ME-E-EN!!

Referee:
 Match win!

Young Toraji:
Sorry, senpai. That last point there was just a fluke. I think I just got lucky.

Young Kenzaburou:
 Look, it doesn't matter how you got the point, man. It still counts. You won the match, and that's all that matters.

Young Toraji:
Yes, sir!

Spokesman:
 Congratulations.

Young Toraji:
Thank you. YEA-A-AH! YE-A-A-AH!

Harada:
 I'm sorry, sensei, but it doesn't look like anyone's even here yet.
 I don't know what happened. We were supposed to meet up at 9 o'clock....

Kenzaburou:
 It's okay. I figured something like this might happen. Hop in. We'll go looking for 'em.

Harada:
 Oh, yes, sir!

Kenzaburou:
 You called 'em, right?

Harada:
 Yes, and I'm still trying, but nobody seems to be answering their phone; I keep getting...voicemail.

Kenzaburou:
 Ah. There's Nishiyama.
 Okay. You might wanna hold on.
 Harada, run out and grab her.

Harada:
 Yes, sir! I'm so sorry, Nishi!

Nishiyama:
 NOOOO!!

Kenzaburou:
 Yeah, this whole 'running when you're scared' thing, we're definitely gonna have to work on that.

Nishiyama:
 I'm gonna throw up....

Kenzaburou:
 There's another one.

Yokoo:
 It's a good thing you came to get us, sensei. She's a lot heavier than she looks.

Kenzaburou:
 Oh, great. She's still breathing, right?

Yokoo:
 Of course! What kind of girl do you think I am? Let's roll!

Kenzaburou:
 So we're still missing Ando.

Harada:
 I keep trying, but I still haven't been able to reach her.

Kenzaburou:
 Great. Well, at least she lives all the way across town.

Ando:
 Sorry....

Harada:
 Oh, my gosh, Ando, you have to hurry up and get changed right now!

Ando:
 But I'm so sleepy....
Coach:
 One, two!

 Runners:
 One, two!

Toraji:
Hey, so what's the deal? Where are you, guys? You didn't get lost, did you?

Kenzaburou:
 Sorry, man, but we're still at least an hour away.

Toraji:
What?

Danjuurou:
 We're ready to rumble!

Toraji:
I need you all to be a little bit more serious about this, guys! You don't wanna lose, do you?

Sayako:
 But the other team hasn't even shown up yet, and you said we'd be starting at 10 o'clock!

Toraji:
Uh, I...yeah, well, I'm sure they got a very good reason for being late. Tama!

Tamaki:
 Sir.

Toraji:
Why don't you take everyone through a few training drills until the other team gets here?

Tamaki:
 You want me to lead it, sir?

Toraji:
Yeah, just...a light practice. Nothing too serious. We don't want to wear everyone out before the match.

Tamaki:
 Are you alright, sir?

Toraji:
Yeah...fine. I'm just taking a quick break.
(I thought skipping a couple of meals to make room for sushi was a good idea...guess not.)

Kirino:
 This is perfect! So, Tama, can you teach us some of your surefire tips on how to win matches?

Tamaki:
 I don't really know. I guess the fundamentals would be most important.

Miyako:
 Oh! Do you think you can teach us the fundamentals?

Tamaki:
 Sure...and footwork is important, too.

Kirino:
 The footwork, right. I hate to say this, but we've never really practiced it that much. I'm sure it wasn't our coach's fault.

Sayako:
 I know! Why don't you give us a little demonstration?

Tamaki:
 Of course.
Ando:
 Sorry about this, you guys. I can't fight until the blood starts circulating to my brain, and the only way to make that happen is to eat something sweet.

Kenzaburou:
 Huh...well, there it is, so hurry up and eat it.

Ando:
 It's funny...the whole world looks slanted today....

Yokoo:
 Get it together, girl!

Kenzaburou:
 Hey! Wait a minute, why'd the rest of you order that stuff!? Come on, Ando, your head fell over again! And what's the point of you eating that crap, Harada!? Asakawa, wa--is Asakawa breathing!? Check her!

Nishiyama:
 Delicious.

---

Tamaki:
 Successive: this step is the best way to execute a powerful strike from a short distance. Draw your left foot close to your right, and use that momentum on your right to take a big, strong step forward.

Sayako:
 Oh, the successive step. You know, I think I remember practicing that one.

Kirino:
 There were a lot of other steps, too...what were they called?

Tamaki:
 Sliding step, clearing step, successive step, and walking step. Those are the four basic ones you should know. Footwork is extremely important. Try to keep your feet from lifting off the floor as much as possible, and keep your movements smooth so your body's always ready and in a position of strength.
 I'm sorry. I'm not trying to tell you guys what to do. I just want to help, that's all.

Kirino:
 Uh...

Sayako:
 It's no big deal! Really, we don't mind at all! Just keep teaching, this is awesome!

Tamaki:
 I don't know. I wouldn't want to go over Mr. Toraji's head.

Kirino:
 Oh, nevermind about all that, Tama! Besides, we all know you're way better than him!

Sayako:
 Totally! We'd really like you to keep teaching us, right?

Kirino, Danjuurou, Yuuji, Miyako, and Sayako:
Yeah!

Tamaki:
 But, I....

Kirino:
 We said it's fine, so it's fine! Even though you're just an underclassman, we'll make an exception!

Sayako:
 Yeah, but just because it's you, Tama!

Tamaki:
 Alright. I'd like you all to watch my form carefully. Position your right foot forward, keeping it parallel to your other foot about a half a step apart. Distribute your weight on the balls of both of your feet, and try to visualize keeping your right heel a paper's width off the floor. Again, your feet should be half a step apart. If they're any wider, forward reach is limited when attacking and your executions will be incomplete. If they're too narrow, you'll be unstable and executing moves will be difficult. Your opponent could slam into you and easily knock you off-balance.

Sayako:
 Tama is such a little cutie, right? Oh, look at her out there, she's so tiny and so forceful!

Kirino:
 She's really giving it her all! I guess Tama just lives every day to the fullest!

Sayako and Kirino:
She's so adorable!

Tamaki:
 When clearing to the right, step diagonally forward to the right with your right foot and pull your left leg in. To move to the left, step diagonally with the left foot and then just move with the right foot just like this.
 (Somehow, I get the feeling they're not paying attention at all.)

Toraji:
Yellowtail...salmon...fatty tuna...shrimp....
Yokoo:
 Oh, man, why did I eat so much...? I feel sick....

 Kenzaburou:
 WHAT THE HECK DO YOU EXPECT IF YOU'RE EATING ALL THAT CRAP, HUH!?

Harada:
 That's not all, she ate an entire pizza, too.

Kenzaburou:
 Uh, hang on. Harada, do you happen to know where we are right now or where Muroe High School is?

Harada:
 No, sir. I have no idea.

Kenzaburou:
 I'm goin' in for a map. Stay put.
 Hey, sorry, uh, Kojirou, I'm a little lost here. Uh...where's your school again?
 We finally made it.

Toraji:
We've been waiting all day for you.

Danjuurou:
 I'm so hungry, you guys.

Yuuji:
 Just hang in there until we get this match over with, Danny, okay?

Toraji:
This would've been a great opportunity to get some joint practice in for our teams before the match, but considering the time, I guess we should just get right to it, don'tcha think?

Kenzaburou:
 Oh, uh...sure.
 It's been a while. It could've been fun for us to face off again, you know?

Toraji:
Yeah, but I guess there wouldn't be much point to it after all this time. So we'll have to leave the fighting to our students.

Kenzaburou:
 You're right.
Kenzaburou:
 I'll be the chief referee.

Toraji:
Yuuji and I will sub-ref. I'm counting on you, okay?

Yuuji:
 Yes, sir.

Toraji:
Dan, do you think you can handle the clock and the scoreboard?

Danjuurou:
 Yep! I'll do my best!

Toraji:
You remember...HOW to do everything?

Danjuurou:
 Yep! I'll do my best!

Yuuji:
 (Hope he gets it right.)

Toraji:
Hmm...what should we do about record keeping?

Kirino:
 Me! I'll do it, sir!

Toraji:
Oh, good. Then, here you go.

Kirino:
 Thank you!

 Kenzaburou:
 Are the teams ready? Then let's commence with the Muroe High and Machido High practice match. You may bow to the front and bow to each other!

All:
Let's have a good match!

Kenzaburou:
 This'll be a winner-take-all match. Each matchup will be five minutes. Overtime is three. Three rounds, and whoever gets two points first wins.
 Kojirou, you only have four members on your team?

Toraji:
Oh, that's right. One seems to be running late, but I'm certain she'll turn up in a bit.

 Kenzaburou:
 Okay.

Kirino and Sayako:
(What!?)

Kenzaburou:
 Begin!

Harada:
 Haaah!

Tamaki:
 Haaah!

Harada:
 Haaa--

Tamaki:
 ME-E-E-EN!

Kenzaburou:
 Head strike!

Yokoo, Nishiyama, and Ando:
(She's fast!)


次回予告
Sayako: Hey, there! It's Saya! Next time, it's "Tamaki Kawazoe and the Tardy Braver", and THIS is a theme song I composed! "Where's Tama? Tama disappears in the middle of the night and she is gone! Ka-poof! We're all so sad, we're in the middle of the match, a new hope arise! Bureiba comes along! The one is two and the two are one and it's （聞こえなかった） just like that! Hold me tight in the tide of the night! Win or lose, grazie, grazie! The heavy chest guard and the stinky wrist guard （聞こえなかった） and run out together FOREVER!!!"
