  Blade Bravers:
Super Sword Squadron Blade Bravers!

Red Braver:
 The city is under attack! It's that fiend Death Armor!

Death Armor:
 Uwahahahahaha! Give it up, Blade Bravers! You don't stand a chance against me! I am the most powerful being in the world, and I will do what I will with it! Hahahahaha!

Red Braver:
 Death Armor, I swear this on my honor, we will end your reign of terror and BRING PEACE BACK TO THE WORLD!!

Toyama:
 Who's the runt? Do we have a new member?

Kirino:
 Her name is Tamaki Kawazoe. She's a freshman, but she has lots of experience.

Toyama:
 Oh, yeah?
 Alright, freshman. Suit up. I'll give you your first test.

---

Kirino:
 I'm sorry I dragged you into this mess, Tama.

Tamaki:
 It's fine.

Kirino:
 That's his style. He picks on all the new people right away like that, shows them who's boss so he can feel important or something.

Tamaki:
 Even the girls?

Kirino:
 I actually think he's harder on the girls. If you ask me, he gets off on it.
 You'll see that all the time, being in clubs with boys. They're always throwing their weight around. They all just love to show off how superior they are, it makes me sick!
 COME ON, TAMA! STAND UP! STAND UP AND FIGHT THAT BIG JERK! WE'VE PUT UP WITH THIS CRAP FOR FAR TOO LONG! MOP THE FLOOR WITH THE-E-E-EM!!

Tamaki:
 Um...hey, Kirino?

Kirino:
 Yeah?

Tamaki:
 Do you have any pants smaller than these?

 Kirino:
 Uh...those are the smallest we've got.

Tamaki:
 Maybe I can fold up the front. I'm afraid of stepping on the hem. It'll probably be okay.

Kirino:
 Listen, don't worry about it. We'll just do it some other time when you have your own stuff.

Tamaki:
 No, it's fine. It's just for today.
Toyama:
 Hey! Where do ya think you're goin', freshman?
 You're up when I'm done with her.
---
Yuuji:
 One time, back in grade school, some of the older kids were picking on me and my friends and things started to get a little out of hand.

Young Yuuji:
 Stop it!

Boy A:
 "Stop it!" What, are you gonna cry?

 Boy B:
 I'll give you something to cry about!

Yuuji:
 One of the older kids picked up a metal pipe and started coming right for me.
 All of a sudden, there she was. The champion of justice.

Boy A:
 Ow!

Young Tamaki:
 STOP FIGHTING!

Toraji:
Tamaki Kawazoe....

Yuuji:
 Yep. It was her, alright.

Toraji:
Champion...of justice....

---

Toyama:
 Should've took you long enough. Alright, let's get this over with.

Tamaki:
 Okay. Good luck.

Iwasa:
 You'd better be careful, half-pint. Toyama's not messin' around. He's using a special shinai made out of carbon. It's gonna sting like hell when he hits ya. Actually, the reason he loves to use it is because one of his favorite things in the world is seeing his opponents suffer. He's a real sicko. Just thought you should know.

Toyama:
 Knock it off, man! You'll scare her away. Heh heh.

 Tamaki:
 Hm.

Toyama:
 Hey. Kawazoe. Don't pay too much attention to him, okay? I'll be gentle with you, I promise. This isn't like a real match or anything.
 And after all, this is just kendo.

Toraji:
Champion of justice. A hero, huh?
I just hope she'll put food in my poor belly...
---
Yuuji:
 Crap, I'm so late! Whoa...sounds like fighting in there.

 It's Tama!

Toyama:
 She's so fast, I can't land a single hit. It's starting to piss me off. Guess it's time to get serious.

Tamaki:
 DO!!!

Yuuji:
 Way to go!

Kirino:
 That's it!

 Hold on!

Miyako:
 Is something wrong?

Kirino:
 In kendo, once someone scores a point, both fighters have to return to their original positions!

Tamaki:
 Aren't we going to start over?

Toyama:
 Like I said in the beginning, this isn't a real match. We're just testing your strength.

Iwasa:
 Yeah. Of course this isn't a real match. All he wants to do is beat the crap out of her. Freakin' sicko.

---

Tamaki's father:
 The true purpose of kendo is not to harm the one before you. It is to discover yourself and the warrior spirit within you. We do not aim to tear down our opponents; we constantly aspire to build up ourselves.
 That may have been a little over your head. But you must understand this, Tamaki. Kendo begins with a bow and ends with a bow. It is a sport that values courtesy above all else. There is nothing to be afraid of.

 11 years have gone by. My little girl is at an age that's hard for me to understand.
 It's getting late. What could she still be doing in school?
---
Toyama:
 What's the matter, runt! Attack me!

Tamaki:
 (He's wrong.)

Toyama:
 This is just kendo.

Tamaki:
 (It's not kendo at all.)

MEN!!!
 MEN!! DO!!

Kirino:
 Aw, yeah!

Toyama:
 So you got a lucky shot! Big freakin' deal! I barely even felt it! You better be careful, 'cause your luck IS ABOUT TO RUN OUT!!

Kirino:
 Oh, man...I just knew it....

Yuuji:
 You knew what?

Kirino:
 Her pants are too big, so she keeps stepping on the hem.

Yuuji:
 Oh, that's why she's moving so slow.

Kirino:
 He's really going after her now. This does not look good!

Yuuji:
 Relax. I wouldn't worry too much about her.

Tamaki:
 DO!!!
 Ugh!

Toyama:
 Sorry. I guess it just slipped.

Iwasa:
 Alright, guys. Seems like a good place to stop for today, huh?

Toyama:
 SHUT UP!
---
Toyama:
 (So she can't back off, huh? All I gotta do is go for her and knock her down. Then she'll see that girls have no business to take on a man. Look at her! She hasn't even broken a sweat!)

Tamaki:
 (I need to concentrate. I won't be able to beat him with my strength alone. In that case....)

Tamaki's father:
 Tamaki, you put too much power into your throat strikes. It's as if you were delivering a lethal blow against a villain. You should not even be using throat strikes.

Young Tamaki:
 I can't use them on anyone?

Tamaki's father:
 Huh. Well, perhaps if you were fighting an older man, but only if he is experienced in the ways of kendo, and you were at least in high school. Until then, it is off-limits.

Tamaki:
 (He's a man...he's older...and he has kendo experience.
 Father...mother...I'm in high school now. IT'S ALLOWED.)
 AAAAAAHHHH!!!!

Kirino:
 Yeah!!

---

Toraji:
Okay. It's time to go home, eat some ramen, and think things over. Hopefully, a full stomach will help me figure this out.

Iwasa:
 Toyama, you alright? Talk to me, man! Geez, you really hit the ground like a ton of bricks.

Kirino:
 That was amazing! You're a hero! I'm not kidding, if those jerks ever come back, I know you'll be the only one who'll be able to protect the rest of us!

Tamaki:
 I'm the only one?

Kirino:
 Uh-huh!

Tamaki:
 I understand. As long as I am needed, I will stay here and be your protector.

Kirino, Miyako, Danjuurou, Yuuji:
(all compliment Tamaki)

Toraji:
Uh...hey-uh...?

アイキャッチ
Tamaki: Tamaki Kawazoe. Champion of justice.

Red Braver:
 Atomic Fire Blade!

Death Armor:
AAAGGGHHH!! It's not over yet, Blade Bravers! Mark my words...I will retur-r-r-r-rn!

Red Braver:
 I will ALWAYS be here to protect mankind. Mark MY words!

Tamaki:
 Oh!

---

Tamaki:
 Bye, father.

Tamaki's father:
 Tamaki, what's all that?

Tamaki:
 I joined my school's kendo team.

Tamaki's father:
 Haha, is that right? I'm so glad that you found the motivation. What made you finally do it? Was it a friend? Or a teacher, perhaps?

Tamaki:
 No, sir. It's to defend the world against evil!

Tamaki's father:
 Uh....

---

Toraji:
So...I guess that's it. We'll go over that worksheet...next time, okay?

Student:
 You feeling alright? What's wrong?

Toraji:
I'm starving....
(I skipped breakfast again...if I don't win that match with senpai soon, I'm a goner.)

Girl A:
 Well, do you want this, then? It's my lunch, but I'm trying to stay on kind of a strict diet these days.

Toraji:
Really!? You're just gonna give it to me!?

Girl B:
 Here, take mine, too.

Toraji:
Oh! Oh! Food! Glorious food!

Girl A:
 He must really like buns.

 Girl B:
 Y'think so?
---
Kirino:
 Ta-daaaa! Check it out, you guys! Does this look like the meal of a champion or what!

Miyako:
 This one is especially for my little chipmunk!

Tamaki:
 That's it.

Yuuji:
 It's pretty manly, don'tcha think?

Danjuurou:
 Let's eat!

Miyako:
 Hey, you guys, we should all share what we have! Everyone, please help yourselves!

Tamaki:
 I'm sorry, but I don't think I can split my umeboshi.

Yuuji:
 Oh. That's cool.

Kirino:
 Yeah, you only got one.

 Tamaki:
 But I can share the rice.

Kirino:
 Okay! Thanks!

Tamaki:
 All done.

Kirino, Yuuji, Miyako, and Danjuurou:
Whoa!

Kirino:
 Oh! By the way, did you know my family runs a deli? Here. Why don't you try a meat patty?

Danjuurou:
 Oh, yeah! You should have one of these amazing fried shrimps that Miya-Miya made for me!
 (She almost chewed my arm off!)

Yuuji:
 Here you go! Something to drink.

Tamaki:
 Thanks, you guys, but I'm starting to feel like a charity case.

Kirino, Yuuji, and Danjuurou:
Oh, really?

Kirino:
 It's not that! You're just so small, we want you to grow a little! Get big and strong!

Tamaki:
 (You mean fat.)
---
Yuuji:
 Hey, I just thought of something. Isn't there supposed to be another second-year student on the team?

Kirino:
 Yep! Her name's Saya. She's gone to the same schools as me since we were little.

Miyako:
 Why hasn't she been coming to class?

Kirino:
 Uhmm, let's just say she has her moments from time to time. But don't worry! They always blow over, sooner or later.

Yuuji:
 I was wondering, how did our team do last year? Like, what was our record?

Kirino:
 Nothing special. Like, it was a really big deal if we made it to the second round. Some of the guys did well, individually, but the girls, not so much.

Yuuji:
 Well I guess the instructor has a lot to do with it.

Kirino:
 You're right about that. But lately, he seems really fired up and ready to go!

Yuuji:
 (If she only knew...!)

Danjuurou:
 Hey, Yuuji, how well did you do back in middle school?

Yuuji:
 Uh...I did okay. Actually, I made it to top 8 in the prefecture.

Kirino:
 Top 8!? That's awesome!

Yuuji:
 Aw, come on. It's not that big of a deal, guys.

Kirino:
 Yeah? Is that so? Well, I never even made it far enough to compete in the prefecture level. I couldn't get past the preliminaries. If you're "no big deal", I guess that means I really suck.

Yuuji:
 Oh! Well, what I meant was I'm awesome! I'm totally awesome!

Kirino:
 Well, what about you? What's your record?

Tamaki:
 I never competed.

Kirino:
 What? You never have?

Yuuji:
 But I'm sure that if you did, you would've done great.
 You probably could've even won the nationals.
---
Toraji:
Tamaki Kawazoe, Kirino Chiba, Miyako Miyazaki, and Sayako Kuwahara. That's still only four members. Just one more. One more and we'll have an actual team.
Nevermind that! I gotta work on our training regimen so we can kick their butts!

Yoshikawa:
 Well, someone around here is excited.

Toraji:
Sorry, Ms. Yoshikawa. I got a little carried away for a second--

Yoshikawa:
 No, no! It's actually pretty refreshing to see you so enthusiastic about something for a change, you know?

Toraji:
Yeah....

Yoshikawa:
 It seems that the school has been in kind of a slump lately, so it's good to see someone fired up around here.

Toraji:
Oh. Is that right?

Yoshikawa:
 Oh, yeah! Enthusiasm is definitely contagious, so maybe you'll spread it around to your students, and with a little luck, they'll pass it on, too!

Toraji:
Right.
(I can't tell her why I'm really doing it....)
---
Toraji:
Kirino, I told you not to strike just using your wrists!

Kirino:
 I'm sorry...it's just so hard not to....

Toraji:
Tama, please show her how it's done.

Tamaki:
 Yes, sir!

Kirino:
 Oh...we're finally a real team! Working up the sweat! Dripping with sweat! Gleaming in sweat! SHINING IN SWEAT!

Toraji:
What is wrong with you? Do it again, and keep it straight this time!

Kirino:
 Yes, sir!

Toraji:
You gotta relax your shoulders.

Kirino:
 Aw...feels ni-i-ice....

Toraji:
Tama, keep going!

Tamaki:
 Yes, sir!

Toraji:
Yuuji! You know if Dan and Miya-Miya are out running their laps?

Yuuji:
 Yeah, they're out on the track right now.

Danjuurou:
 Wait for me, sweetie pie!

Miyako:
 Honey bear! You're one lap behind me!

Toraji:
Those two really need to work on their strength and endurance...plus their lovey-dovey stuff is getting annoying.

Yuuji:
 Tell me about it.

Toraji:
Right! Well, we have to get Miya-Miya up to speed for competition. We can't waste anymore valuable training time fooling around.

Kirino:
 That's ri-i-ight....

Toraji:
Tama!

Tamaki:
 Yes, sir!!

Toraji:
Let's go! You and me!

Tamaki:
 Uh...yes, sir....
---
Toraji:
I just realized I haven't tested your skills first-hand. Now, give me all you've got!

Tamaki:
 Yes, sir.

Toraji:
Ready....

Tamaki:
 Men!

Kirino:
 Go easy on him, okay?

Yuuji:
 I mean, you gotta let him keep a little bit of his dignity, don'tcha think? Maybe an instant kill was a bad idea.

Kirino:
 You can win, but you don't have to make it look so ridiculously easy!

---

Toraji:
I've grown soft. It's true.

Yuuji:
 (But I actually really like kendo.)

Kirino:
 (You getting motivated for my sake is just so sweet!)

Yoshikawa:
 (Oh, yeah! Enthusiasm is definitely contagious!)

Toraji:
Alright, Tama. One more round!

---

Tamaki's father:
 Tamaki. We got more koshi hikari rice from your mother's family. Not only that, but we got more umeboshi plums from my family. They're the organic ones you like, from Kishuu.

Tamaki:
 Sorry, father. Sorry, mother. I am thankful. But tomorrow, I'm going to take sandwiches so I can share with everyone.
 I think I've made some friends.
