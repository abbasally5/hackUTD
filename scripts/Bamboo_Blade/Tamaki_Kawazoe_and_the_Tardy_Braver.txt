Tamaki:
So wait, you want me to fight both the vanguard and the commander?

Toraji: The vanguard starts out the match with their helmet on, so they won't get a good look at your face.  Pretty brilliant idea, don't you think?

Yuuji:
No!  They'll see right through it.

Toraji: Huh?

Yuuji:
You can't mask her physique, and I'm sure they'll know it's her from her fighting style.

Toraji: That's why she'll be suppressing her abilities in the vanguard match.  Just try to fight at half power.

Tamaki:
At half?

Toraji: But you'll have to fight the commander match at full strength, making you look like a completely different person.

Tamaki:
(Half-strength.)

(Cheering.)

Yuuji:
This won't work.  You can't tell Tama to go half way.

Kenzaburou:
Round two.

Yuuji:
I don't know if he realizes, but she hasn't even gotten up to half strength at practice.

Tamaki:
Men!

---

Kenzaburou:
Match!

Ando:
Nice try, Harada.

(Cheering.)

Danjuurou:
Head-strike.  Win one.

Kirino:
He's actually doing it right.

Harada:
I'm sorry guys.  I failed you.

Yokoo:
Don't sweat it.  It's no big deal.

Kenzaburou:
(Not a good sign at all.  Harada is one of my best students.  She's strong.  And she's always training. 〇〇〇 she practically lives at the dojo, but she was no match for that girl.  What's her name?  Kawazoe.  A first year student?  Hmm.)

Kenzaburou:
Kojirou, where'd your vanguard run off to?

Toraji: Huh?  Ah, she had to go home early.

Kenzaburou:
What!?  We're in the middle of a match!

Toraji: Well, I think she had a dentist's appointment.

Kirino:
She did?

Sayako:
Oh no, is she getting braces?

Yuuji:
Ehahahaha...

Kenzaburou:
What the--  You told her the match was today, didn't you?

Toraji: If you guys weren't so late, it wouldn't be a problem.

Kenzaburou:
Okay, fine.  Let that match be a wake-up call to you guys.  Get your heads back in the game.  Asakawa?

Kirino:
All right, get 'em Miya! ???

Sayako:
You the wo-man! ???

Miyako:
Right.

Kenzaburou:
Deputy vanguards.  Red is Miyako Miyazaki.  White is Akemi Asakawa.

Kirino:
Hey.  Check out the white side.  She doesn't look to good.

Harada:
What's up?  Did something happen with your boyfriend?

Yokoo:
Bingo.

Asakawa:
(I hate him.  I hate him.  I hate him.)

Kenzaburou:
Begin.

Sayako:
Go Miya-miya!

Kirino:
That's it, Pink, attack!

(Cheering.)

Kenzaburou:
(Asakawa.  What the 〇〇〇's going on?  You're being pushed around by an amateur.  What happened to your footwork?)

Kenzaburou:
Out of bounds.  Reset.

Sayako:
Come on Miya-miya, get vocal!

Kirino:
Good work!

Danjuurou:
Hey, Sensei?  I gotta go pee-pee.

Toraji: What?  Just hold it until this round is over.

Danjuurou:
But I can't!  It's gonna be here any second.

Toraji: Well can't you wait until Miya-miya's done?

Toraji: All right, Danny.  Just, hurry back.

Danjuurou:
Woooo!  Sorry, Miya-miya!  Good luck!

Kenzaburou:
Begin!

Miyako:
Men!  Men!  Men!  Kote!

Yokoo:
Hey!  Move!  Fight back!

Sayako:
Yeah!  Way to go!

Kirino:
Get her, Black!

Miyako:
Men! (I keep hitting her, but why am I not scoring any points?)

Toraji: (Those aren't valid strikes, Miya.  This sport would be easy if all you had to do was hit them.  It's hitting a moving target with efficiency.  That simple premise is usually hard to grasp for a beginner.)

Miyako:
Men!

Toraji: (You're nowhere near getting it yet.)

Yokoo:
Asakawa!  Concentrate, dummy.

Toraji: (We may have a chance.)

Kenzaburou:
Out of bounds!

Sayako:
Oh, man.  You were so close!

Kirino:
You can do this, Miya-miya!

Kenzaburou:
(What is her problem today?)

Asakawa:
(I just don't care anymore.)

Kenzaburou:
What are you doing Asakawa?  Get back to your starting position, now!

Kenzaburou:
Begin!

Asakawa:
Men!

Kenzaburou:
Head-strike.

Asakawa:
Do!

Kenzaburou:
Body-strike!

Kenzaburou:
Match!

(Cheering.)

Yokoo:
That's way to do it.

Sayako:
Don't worry, Miya-miya, I'm sure you'll win next time.

Kirino:
You almost had her!

Kenzaburou:
I thought we were screwed for a minute there.  Asakawa, where are you going?

Asakawa:
Hey, Sensei?  I think I'm gonna head home, okay?  I already won my match, so everything's cool, right?

Kenzaburou:
No, it's not!  Your teammates haven't finished yet.  Get back here and cheer them on.

Asakawa:
Right, of course.  Hey, good luck everybody.

Danjuurou:
Miya-miya!  I'm sorry you lost.

Miyako:
Pookie?

Danjuurou:
You have to get stronger so you can be the best kendo fighter ever.  But don't worry because I'm gonna help you do it.

Miyako:
Mmm.  Sounds good.

---

Toraji: Sneak out the back so they don't notice you, then come inside and pretend you're running late.

Tamaki:
What am I doing?

Tamaki:
Sorry everyone, but my stomach can't wait any longer.  I'll be there soon.

---

Sayako:
Men!  Men!  Kote!  Men!

Sayako:
(She keeps scurrying around like a scared little mouse, but she's the size of an ape.)

Nishiyama:
(I'm so scared.)

Harada:
Nishiyama, if you keep running away, you're gonna get hit with another foul.

Yokoo:
Moron!

Harada:
Attack, attack!

Yokoo:
Kill, kill!

Nishiyama:
But, I--

Nishiyama:
Do!

Kenzaburou:
Body-strike!

Yokoo:
All right!  It's about freakin' time.

Kirino:
Aww, Saya.

Danjuurou:
Body-strike.  On the board.

Kenzaburou:
(Nishiyama's the strongest of all of our fighters.  Physically-speaking.  Whenever she's cornered, her reflexes are spot on.  Problem is she HAS to be cornered for that raw instinct to come out.  Not perfect, but she can still win.)

Kirino:
Saya, don't lose your cool!  You still have a chance!

Sayako:
(I dare you to come at me with all you've got.  Just be ready to feel some serious pain.  Come on already!)

Danjuurou:
There isn't much time left, guys.

Sayako:
Men!

Toraji: (Wow, look at Saya's footwork.  I've never seen her move like that.)

Tamaki:
(Short-step.)

Sayako:
Kote!

Sayako:
Wrist-strike.  She did it.

Toraji: Nope.

Yuuji:
Shallow.  Forward step too weak.

Miyako:
She's out of bounds!

Kenzaburou:
Two fouls.  Point to red.

Harada:
Oh man.

Yokoo:
You dummy!

Danjuurou:
Out of time.

Miyako:
That means they're tied at one point.  She just barely made it.

Kirino:
Yeah, but it would have been better if she'd gotten a point for the wrist-strike.  But, a point is a point.  Now all she has to do is get one more in overtime and she'll win the match.  Go, Saya!

Toraji: (Good work, Saya.  Your footwork put her on the defensive.  You're usually just a ball of energy, but you were able to calm yourself down and move with some purpose.  Tama must have taught her to be patient.  It seems like everyone's learned SOMETHING since Tama joined the team.  Wait, why is Tama the one getting all the respect?  I'm the coach.  That's my job.  Geez, I need to step it up.)

Kirino:
Come on, Saya!  You're in overtime!

Kirino and Miyako: Go!

Sayako:
Yeah!

Tamaki:
I'm finished with my lunch.

アイキャッチ

Sayako:
I'm Saya, and I'm gonna sing.  Oh man, there's not enough time.

---

Tamaki:
Is this cheating?  I hope not.

Toraji: It's not.  Besides, it's just for a silly practice match.  But even though it's practice, it is still the real deal.  We cannot lose this match, you hear me!?  So, just disguise yourself enough so they don't get suspicious.

Assistant Principal:
You saved my life, Miss Kawazoe.  Now if you would like to borrow these, then please be my guest.

Tamaki:
Thank you, sir.

Assistant Principal:
However, I'll need them returned by Monday.

---

Kenzaburou:
Halt!

Harada:
They're out of time.  It's a draw.

Yokoo:
Ugh, that sucks!  You should of had her!

Kirino:
Wait to go, Saya!  You did great out there, really!

Sayako:
I'm exhausted.

Nishiyama:
I'm so glad it's over.

Yokoo:
What's wrong with you?  It's like you don't even want to be on the team.

Kenzaburou:
You need to work on your conditioning so you can actually last a whole match.  Same goes for your mental strength.

Tamaki:
Hey everyone.  Sorry I'm late.

Yuuji:
Oh, hey Tam--

Toraji: No kidding you're late, uh, um...  I...  Uh...  Um...  Uh...  Bureiba!  Bureiba!  One of our new freshman, Bureiba.  Don't ever be late again, you got that, Bureiba?  Now get changed for your match, Bureiba.

Kirino:
What the heck?

Sayako:
Don't tell me he--

Kirino, Sayako, and Miyako: --plans to use her in the final match, too?

Kenzaburou:
(That's the same girl who fought in the vanguard match.  Ah, who cares?  I wanted to see her fight again, anyway.)

Harada:
(Didn't I fight against her?)

Nishiyama:
(She was their vanguard.)

Yokoo:
(Something's fishy here.)

Yokoo:
It's okay, Harada.  I don't want to be the only one without an opponent, anyway.  Besides, I've been wanting a chance at cracking her skull all day.  This is about to get fun.

Sayako:
Kick her butt, Kirino!  Show 'em why you're our team king captain!

Miyako:
Baby, how's my favorite time-keeper doing?

Danjuurou:
I'm all over it.

Kenzaburou:
Second in command.  Red, Kirino Chiba.  White, Yuuri Ando.  Begin!

(Cheering)

Tamaki:
I just realized I haven't cheered on any of my teammates today.  I feel really bad about that.

Sayako:
You can do this, Kirino!  Start mashing the B button really fast!

Kirino:
Look at her.  She's dead behind the eyes.

Harada:
Is that on purpose?

Yokoo:
Of course it is.

Harada:
She's trying to be annoying?

Yokoo:
Isn't it obvious?

Harada:
Is Ando even going to try to win?

Yokoo:
She's more into sadism than winning.

Sayako:
All she's doing is forcing deadlocks and not attacking.

Miyako:
It is an interesting strategy.  I really wish I could have fought her instead.

Sayako:
Your dark side, Miya-miya.  I can actually see your dark side.

Yokoo:
Push her, Ando.  Knock her on her butt.  Take her out.

Kirino:
Whoa...  That hurt.

Kenzaburou:
(Watch it, Ando.  I told you, no funny stuff.)

Ando:
Hey, are you all right?

Kirino:
Yeah!

Toraji: (Kirino.  You can't let it get you down.  You have way too much determination to lose to someone who acts like she's phoning it in.  Just remember the lessons Tama has taught you, and you'll win.)

Yuuji:
What about what you taught her!?

Kenzaburou:
Begin!

Toraji: Stick to the fundamentals you know.  Find the same intensity you get when you practice, and you'll win every time.

Tamaki:
(Before your target is within range, snap your wrists and deflect your opponent's sword by drawing yours in semi-circle.  But do not stop there.  After you deflect the blade, continue the motion in a fluid arc, and it will become an attack.)

Kirino:
Kote!

Tamaki:
(I still feel like I'm deceiving everyone.)

Kenzaburou:
I'll tell you what.  You're into all that anime and manga, right?  If you help me win with match against my senpai, I'll let you have one of my super-rare collector's items.

Tamaki:
(A collector's item.)

Kenzaburou:
Begin!

Sayako:
Go, Kirino, go!  Get her!

Yokoo:
You're better than her!

Harada:
Come on ○○○

Yokoo:
You can't afford to lose again!

Harada:
We can win this one!  Go!

Yokoo:
Didn't you learn anything in training?!

Harada:
Come on, we can win this one!  Let's go!

Sayako:
Come on, keep it up!

Yokoo:
You can do it!

Sayako:
Come on, Tama, cheer her on with me.  The louder, the better.

Tamaki:
Oh, okay.  I guess I could do that.

Danjuurou:
We're almost out of time, guys.

Miyako:
Way to keep time, Monkey!

Kirino:
Men!  Men!

Tamaki:
Go.  You can do it.  Yeah.

Sayako:
She can't even hear you.  Speak up.

Ando:
Another head-strike?  No, she's going for the body.  Then I'll go low and ram my shoulder right into her--oh, crap.

Sayako:
Men!

Kenzaburou:
Head-strike!

Harada:
She just lost.

Kenzaburou:
Match!

Yokoo:
You couldn't even score one point, you stupid moron!?

Sayako:
Kirino, that ruled!

Miyako:
Way to go, captain.

Tamaki:
Um, senpai?  Congratulations.

Kirino:
Thanks for cheering me on, Tama.  It really helped me out.  Well, guys?  I did it!

Danjuurou:
Head-strike.  Yeah.  Heh-hehehe.

Toraji: (Two wins, one loss, and a draw.  We can win this.  As long as you stick to what I told you, the match is all yours, Tamaki.)

Yuuji:
But you haven't taught Tama anything!

Toraji: All right.  Get that helmet one, uh, Bureiba.

Tamaki:
Sir.

Kenzaburou:
Yokoo!  Why aren't you suiting up for your match?

Yokoo:
Don't worry about it.  Geez, sensei, I still have plenty of time.

Yokoo:
(Hm.  She looks strong.  I mean, she's tiny, but there's a certain confidence to her.)

Harada:
What are you waiting for?  You'd better get your helmet on.

Yokoo:
Harada, do you think I'll be able to beat her?

Harada:
I don't know.

Yokoo:
Wow.  I haven't felt this excited in a while.

Yokoo:
One point at a time.

Harada:
Good luck, Yokoo.

Kenzaburou:
Commanders, step forward!

Toraji: Uh, Bureiba, what are you doing?  You forgot your name flap again.  I mean, this is getting hopeless, Bureiba.  How could you be so careless, Bureiba?

Kenzaburou:
Commander match!  Red, Buh--Bureiba.  White, Maya Yokoo.

Kirino:
Poor Bureiba.  She's so much smaller.

Sayako:
No fair!  That girl's a beast!

Miyako:
Great.  Tama's gonna get pummeled and we're gonna lose.

Harada:
Looks like this is gonna be a good match.

Nishiyama:
I just hope that nobody gets hurt.

Kenzaburou:
Begin!

Kirino, Sayako, and Miyako: Scary.

Tamaki:
Hah!  Hah!  Men!

Kenzaburou:
Head-strike.

Yokoo:
Oh, man.  I didn't even have time to react.

Kenzaburou:
Round two.

Yokoo:
Wait.  Hold on a second.

Tamaki:
Men!

Kenzaburou:
Head-strike.

Kirino:
Yeah!  She did it!

Sayako:
Bureiba!  Bureiba!

Kenzaburou:
Match!

Yokoo:
I don't know what happened.  I just--froze up.

Harada:
Let's line up.

Kenzaburou:
With three wins, one loss, and a draw, the winner is Muroe high.  Bow.

Girls: Thank you so much for the wonderful match.

Danjuurou:
We did it, Miya-miya.

Toraji: (Yeah!  Woo!)  senpai, your team found an excellent match. (I beat you.  I beat you.  Woo!)

Kenzaburou:
Mmm.

Toraji: Your kids fought fearlessly, and with class.  I'd expect nothing less.

Sayako:
You did it, Bureiba.  They never even had a chance against you.

Toraji: Senpai?

Kenzaburou:
Kojirou.  Would you be opposed to the idea of me fighting a round?

Toraji: What?  But we already agreed that fighting against each other would be pointless.  Well, I guess I'd be fine with it, but we would have to gear up and get--

Kenzaburou:
Not with you.

Kenzaburou:
Your name?

Tamaki:
Um...  Bureib--

Kenzaburou:
Your name.

Tamaki:
I am Tamaki Kawazoe, a freshman at Muroe High.

Kenzaburou:
I'm Kenzaburou Ishibashi.  Miss Kawazoe, will you fight a match with me?


次回予告

Toraji: Bamboo Blade, or BamBla for short, is already on its seventh episode.  To celebrate, I'll perform an acrostic poem.  Let's see here, I'm supposed to adlib the last "La" into a punch line.  Okay, okay, okay, I get it now.  I'm really good at this sort of thing.  Well, anyway, here goes nothing.  "Ba".  Bam.  One point for me.  Clean head-strike.  "M".  Mmm.  I got a fault for hitting too low on the body.  "B".  I blathered on and on, complaining to the referee.  "La".  Ah man, this is so lame.  I ran out of time before I could finish.  Next time, it's "Sushi and Mince Meat Cutlets".
