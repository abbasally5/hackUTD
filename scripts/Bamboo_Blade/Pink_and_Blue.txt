Toraji:
You gotta have rock-solid footwork, guys. If you can't get that down, forget about winning any matches. Let's see what you can do with this.

No, no, swing down with the shinai and step forward at the same time.





Toraji:
Not bad. With a little more practice, you two might actually get the hang of this, so keep doing that for the rest of our time here today.




Toraji:
Kirino, why don't you help Miya-Miya for a while?


Toraji:
You're right. Well, Tama, wanna play coach for a bit?









Toraji:
Well, now that red's here, I guess I'm gonna be on the sidelines, huh?



Toraji:
So, what's the deal with blue? Any news?



Toraji:
Ugh...that girl is a little on the touchy side.
Toraji:
Wow! Those are some pretty hardcore swings, Saya. You're starting to look like one of the boys.



Toraji:
No, no! You-you've got it all wrong! It's not what I meant at all!



Toraji:
(I mean, she is pretty tall for a girl, but....)







Toraji:
Think about it for the sec. You're pretty new at this, and Kirino was on the middle school team for 3 years. But for someone who just started last year, you're actually doing really well.



Toraji:
Don't blame it all on me! It's just how it works! Kirino is more skilled than you, and you're not gonna beat her until you get to HER level.



Toraji:
Kendo is a completely different thing.







Toraji:
Well, I guess she's still got a little bit more to learn in the way of sportsmanship.



Toraji:
And she's definitely on the passionate side. If she can get that under control, she'll be great.



Toraji:
She definitely has the potential to become one hell of an athlete. It's too bad for her I completely suck as a coach.




Toraji & Kirino:
Huh?



Toraji:
Does it look like I'm trying to stop you?



Toraji:
So you're just gonna walk out? That's it?





Toraji:
(The same thing happened over and over. She'd storm out...come right back like nothing happened.)



Toraji:
Back to work!
(Then there was the fashion emergency.)
Rockin' a pretty bold do there, Saya! Looks like your head's being eaten by an octopus!



Toraji:
(That took her out for a couple of days.)
That wasn't her longest stretch, though, was it? I can't remember...but didn't something happen that she really lost it over?



Toraji:
Oh, that's right.










Toraji:
EVERYBODY! GET OUT OF HERE!



Toraji:
It's a bug fogger, but...I think I went a little overboard.







Toraji:
Hey, Saya, where you going?













Toraji:
Those are the breaks, kids. And by the way, Miya-Miya, I want to see you at morning practice first thing tomorrow.



Toraji:
To get up to speed, you're gonna have to work until you're totally sick of kendo.







Toraji:
Uh....

アイキャッチ
Sayako: I guess what I'm trying to say is "I'll be fine." Thanks for the text, girl! Sayako Kuwahara.



Toraji:
Yo. Top o' the mornin' to ya. 'Sup?


Toraji:
Your boyfriend's not around, so you can drop the act, okay?
Just be yourself. You're not getting graded on this. So, let's have some fun.

Toraji:
Okay, guys. We're gonna start by going over attacks this morning, so you should get geared up.



Toraji:
Kirino, you will be her opponent.



Toraji:
That's the spirit!





Toraji and Kirino:
It's Blue!

Toraji:
I'm so glad you're here, Blue! It's great to have you back!



Toraji:
You're lookin' a little rough there, Blue.



Toraji:
Hey, let me introduce you to Pink. She's...huh? Where'd she go?



Toraji:
That's great and all, but I was hoping you'd help us get Pink up to speed.






























---

Toraji:
Let's go right into strikes this morning to really get your blood going. Don't forget to call them out or they won't count.





Toraji:
Ready? Begin.





Miyako:
Ah!















Toraji:
Relax for a sec, and then we'll do some more.



Toraji:
Okay. Ready for another round?













Toraji:
Okay, that's enough! Slow down there, killer! Kirino, how about I take your place against Pink?













Toraji:
Don't worry. Saya's gone already.
What's up? You were acting pretty weird around her.



Toraji:
Ha ha ha ha ha ha! You actually threw her bike into the water?



Toraji:
Come on! It's really not that complicated. If you don't want to have to avoid her everyday, just tell her you're sorry.



Toraji:
Then why were you hiding from her?
Just think about it for a minute. If you would've actually gotten into it with those two clowns, it would've definitely been a much bigger deal. Maybe Sayako saved you.



Toraji:
You don't really know Saya. She's not like that. She's not the type of girl that'll hold a grudge forever, and trust me. I should know. So what now? You gonna quit the team over it?



Toraji:
Well, I know things will be better if you apologize to Saya.



Toraji:
Miya-Miya, do you watch any superhero movies?



Toraji:
Those guys are always working hard. Whether it's to protect the Earth or just their friends, they're always trying. How do you think they can keep going fight after fight? Because they believe what they're doing is the right thing to do. That gives them the courage they need. Sometimes doing the right thing can be the toughest thing to do, but courage and conviction will help you the whole way. Is it not the right thing to apologize to Saya? You can do it if you think about it that way. I know that you've got it in you.



Toraji:
Heh heh heh. Finally, huh?



Toraji:
Best of luck to you, Pink.

Toraji:
I think we may have found ourselves a true warrior.



次回予告
Tamaki: Tama here. I'm going to take a minute to answer a few of your questions. "What is your favorite food? Red bean buns? Are there any foods that you don't like?" I like all foods, but red bean buns are very good. Why did you think those were my favorite? "What's your favorite anime?" I don't know. I like all anime. Anime rules. "What's the title of the next episode?" It's "Muroe High and Machido High." See you again.
