  Rukia (narration):
We stand in awe before that which cannot be seen
and we respect with every fibre that which cannot be explained...
I sense a strong spirit energy nearby.

Thug #1:
You got a death wish pal?! 
Nobody jumps one of my boys for no reason
and lives to tell about it!

Ichigo:ï»¿
hmm

Thug #1:
THat's all you got to say?!

Thug #2:
Lil Yama's down! We gotta help him!

Thug #3:
Are you crazy? I'm not taking on that psycho!

Ichigo:
Now listen up you pond scum!
Do you see that?!
First question, what do you think that is?
You! The one in the middle! Answer!

Thug #2:
Wait! You talking to me?
I guess somebody left those flowers here for some 
kid who died here.

Ichigo:
Correct!
Now, the next question. That vase over there, why is 
it lying on its side?

Thug #3:
I guess one of us knocked it over when we were
skateboarding through here. We didn't-

Ichigo:
You guys catch on fast!
Now go and apologize otherwise the next time
the flowers will be for you!

Thugs #1 #2 #3:
Ahh! We're sorry!

Ichigo:
There. That oughta keep those punks from showing
their ugly faces around here.
Sorry about all of that.
I'll bring you by some new flowers tommorrow.

Young girl ghost:
Thankyou for coming to my defense.
I think I'll finally be able to rest peacefully.

Ichigo:
No problem. It's the least I could do. After
all you deserve to rest in peace.

Narration (Ichigo):
My name is Ichigo Kurosaki. I'm 15 years old, 
so I'm a high school student. My family runs a 
medical clinic here in town. 
Maybe it's because we are entrusted with the 
live of the living. I'm not sure...
But for as long as I can remember, I've been able 
to see the souls of the dearly departed. 

Ichigo:
I'm home

Dad:
Hayaa! You let your guard down! Always stay alert 
when you enter a room and you're late for dinner again!

Ichigo: 
Come on! Is that any way to welcome your son after he
just risked his life to help a spirit find peace!

Dad:
Silence! Oh so it's the ghost's fault now is it?! I suppose
it's the ghost who left your room a mess!
When are you going to show some discipline!? 
Just because you see ghosts and I dont doesn't make
you boss of this household!

Yuzu:
Hey stop the fighting you two!
Come over here and eat your dinner!

Karin:
Let 'em fight. More rice for me.

Yuzu:
That's not very nice Karin.

Ichigo:
I gotta tell ya dad. For any normal, healthy high school
kid a 7 o'clock cufew is really uncool.

Karin:
Speaking of uncool, you have a new one.

Ichigo:
How long have you been there?
Take a hike will ya! Damn pest!

Karin:
Aha. I'm so done.
Poor Ichigo. Dad or ghost it's always something.

Yuzu:
I think he's kinda lucky to be able to see ghosts.
I sorta sense their prescence sometimes but that's about it.

Karin:
I don't see what the big deal is with ghosts.
I don't even believe in 'em.

Yuzu:
Karin! I don't even get how you could say 
something like that.
I thought you had the power to see spirits too!

Karin:
I'm in permanent denial. 
Just seeing 'em doesn't make me beleive in 'em.

Ghost man:
Brrrr! That's cold!

Ichigo:
Like my dinner...

Dad:
You dropped your guard again!
Ahahaha....Gotcha...
No charge for the lesson...

Ichigo:
Nevermind dinner. I'm going to my room.

Yuzu:
Wait, Ichigo..

Karin:
You sure have a way with kids dont ya?

Dad:
M-me? What did I do?

Yuzu:
Ichigo is kinda having a rough time right now.

Karin:
Yea, he said he is seeing more spirits than ever before.

Dad:
What?! Why would he talk about these things 
with you two,instead of coming to his own dad?
That doesn't make sense!

Karin: 
Sure it does. For one thing you're over 40.
For another, emotionally you are still on 
a preschool level Dad. Admit it.

Dad:
Oh my dear wife! Maybe it's because
they're hitting puberty but our daughter is 
so cold to me. What do I do?! What do I do?!

Karin:
Well for starters you may wanna take down that poster.

TV reporter:
The incident occured just outside of Katakura station
just after 7.30am, as the moring commute was getting into full swing.
Witnesses reported hearing a loud crash and feeling the 
ground shake beneath their feet. The entire area has been cordoned off.

Ichigo:
Hey.

Yuzu:
Good morning Ichigo.

Ichigo:
Morning. Where's Dad?

Karin:
Early meeting. Said he'd be late tonight too.

Ichigo:
Again, huh? 
hm?

Yuzu:
Somethng bad happen?

Ichigo:
That's near here.

Ichigo:
Hello!
huh?

Street woman:
Listen do you hear that sound?

Street man:
What sound? 
I don't hear anything except you.
Ahhh!

Ichigo:
Wow. What the hell is that?!

Young girl ghost:
Help me!

Ichigo:
Run! Hurry!

Young ghost girl:
What is that thing?

Ichigo:
I don't know!
Come on! We've gotta move!
Wow...Hey! Hold on!

Random man on street:
What was that?
The sidewalk is burning. There must
have been another explosion.

Ichigo:
Who was she? I can't make any sense of what
happened out there today.
What the hell are you doing here?
Ah! Put that thing away you're not slicing me up!
Hey!

Rukia:
It's getting closer. I feel it.

Ichigo:
Who are you anyway and what do you want?!
If you think you're a burglar you're not a very good one!
For starters you shouldn't talk to yourself!

Rukia:
You kicked me, but I can't be seen by
ordinary humans.
Are you saying you can see me?

Ichigo:
Well considering that was my foot
I just planted in your behind.
You tell me.

Rukia:
You are the one I saw in town earlier.
I remember.

Ichigo:
Boy, nothing gets by you.

Rukia:
How very starnge. 
You look normal but you must be 
defective in some way.

Ichigo:
I'll show you defective!
Who are you?

Rukia:
You want to know?
Then I'll tell you.
I'm a soul reaper.

Young ghost girl:
Oh! Oh no not again!

Ichigo:
Alright.
So you're something called a soul reaper.

Rukia:
Mmm

Ichigo:
And you're telling me you were sent
here on a mission by something 
called the soul society.

Rukia:
Mmm

Ichigo:
To deal with demons like the ones 
we saw on the steet today.

Rukia:
Mhmm

Ichigo:
That's all believeable to me.
Along with flying pigs and the tooth fairy!

Rukia:
How dare you! Why wouldn't you believe in
soul reapers?
When you just admitted you can see spirits!

Ichigo:
I've never seen or heard of soul reapers before
and frankly your whole story is too incredible.
I dont believe in anything I can't see.

Rukia:
Well, you see me don't you?

Ichigo:
Well that's true and I'd agree to the fact
your not human. But why dont you play 
your little soul reaper game somewhere else?
Ok little brat? Run along.

Rukia:
So I'm a brat, am I? 
Bukudo Number 1 Strike!

Ichigo:
I can't move!
What did you do to me?!

Rukia:
Paralysis. Iv'e used what's called
a keido on you. It's a high level incantation 
only we soul reapers can cast.
It's useless to struggle against it. 
You're just wasting your energy.
I may appear young to you but I have
lived nearly 10 of your lifetimes.
I would kill you on the spot for your insults, 
if it were not against my orders. 
So you little brat, be grateful.

Ichigo:
You've got nerve.
Ah! It's that ghost from yesterday.

Rukia:
And now...

Ghost man:
No, please don't .
I don't want to be sent to the underworld.

Rukia:
You needn't worry becasue you are bound
for a better place. The soul society.
There your soul will be at peace.

Ichigo:
Where did he go? 
What did you do to him?

Rukia:
I sent his spirit to the soul society.
It's one of the main responsibilities
of a soul reaper. People here sometimes 
call it 'passing on'.
Now I'll explain to you why I'm here and
I'll use small words so you can understand.
There are two types of spirits in this world.
The first kind are the good spirits called
"wholes" the ghosts that you see are usually
this kind. 
The second kind are evil spirits known as "hollows".
The hollows attack people living or dead,
im order to devour their souls.
Any questions before I go on?

Ichigo:
First of all, who do your drawings 
suck so bad?
Ahh! You'll pay for this!

Rukia:
Let us continue with our lesson Monsieur.
These are the main jobs for soul reapers.
Frist to lead "wholes" to the soul society 
through console, as I just did.
The second, to exorcise the "hollows" 
whenever we find them.

Ichigo:
That hollow with the bug body this afternoon,
Why was it chasing that girl?

Rukia:
That I don't know. 
We are yet to understand what motivates
the hollows to do the things they do.

Hollow:
I can smell it. An especially tatsy soul.
It's nearby. Along with the smell 
of a soul reaper.

Ichigo:
Waht was that?!

Rukia:
One thing we do know,
there is still a second hollow
prowling somewhere nearby.

Ichigo:
Then what the hell are you waiting for?!
Go out and kill it!

Rukia:
I would but I can't seem to detect its location.
Usually I have no trouble finding a hollow that's
close by but here it's as if my sense are jammed by 
some powerful force-

Ichigo:
What are you deaf?!
There's something howling out there!
That sound has to be a hollow!

Rukia:
Something howling?
What do you mean? Huh?
Now I hear it.
Definitely a hollow.

Ichigo:
That's what I've been telling you.

Yuzu:
Waaaaah!

Ichigo:
That's Yuzu! Hey! Wait!
Untie me!

Rukia:
This spirit pressure is among the strongest
I have ever felt.
How could I have not have sensed it earlier?
Huh?

Yuzu:
Ichigo...Ah...

Ichigo:
Yuzu! What happened?

Yuzu:
Ah..Ichigo..Karin's been..Ichigo..
You've gottah help her...

Ichigo:
Hey! You gotta let me go!
Hey! Gotta break free...

Karin:
Ahh! Put me down!

Rukia:
Saty out of it!

Ichigo:
Dammit!

Rukia:
How can he be on his feet when
he's under my spell?
Fool! You'll only get in the way

Ichigo:
Shut up!
Karin!

Rukia:
Stop! THe keido is too strong for
a human to break if you keep trying
you'll only cause damage to you soul!
What? he's breaking the keido that's impossible!
Don't do it!

Karin:
Ichigo get me out of here!

Ichigo:
Karin...

Hollow:
Iv'e found you!

Ichigo:
Karin! No!

Rukia:
Don't worry she'll be alright.
The hollow left without devouring
either of your sister's souls.

Ichigo:
Are you sure?

Rukia:
Yes, it seems it was seeking a 
specific soul to eat. 
One with a much higher concentration
of spiritual energy. In fact the hollow
earlier was hungry for the same soul too,
not the girl's.

Ichigo:
But why?

Rukia:
For some reason most of your spiritual energy
was hidden deep within you. Unjtil now when you 
needed it to save you sister. That;s why I didn't
sense anything unusual about you when I arrived.
It also explains why the hollows haven't come after you.
The spirit energy you have bottled up inside you has
started to pour out when you made contact with that 
young girl's ghost. As a result, you soul became 
exposed. Those two hollows today detected your soul
through that girl and they have been using her to track
it down. Which means the holows are really after you.

Ichigo:
Those things...want me?

Rukia:
Its back! Get out of here!

Ichigo:
No! So the vicious attacks on that poor girl
were because of me?

Rukia:
Well that's one way to look at it.

Ichigo:
And now both of my sisters could
wind up dead and the whole thing is my fault?

Yuzu:
Ah help us Ichigo

Karin:
Do something Ichigo!

Rukia:
Stop!

Ichigo:
Coward! Quit attacking others!
If it's my soul you want come and get it!
Fight me one on one you ugly bastard!

Rukia:
Oh no!

Ichigo:
Soul Reaper!

Rukia:
You- are a fool. 
How could you have possibly thought,
you were any match for a hollow?
Did you really think everything would
be over if you gave him your soul?
One soul doesn't satisfy them for long.
If you don't stop interfering we are all going
to end up as its food. I'm too injured to fight.
Do you- want to save your family?

Ichigo:
Of course I do!
If there's a way then tell me how!

Rukia:
It will only be temporary but 
you must become a soul reaper yourself.

Ichigo:
What?

Rukia:
You must take my zanpakuto and run it
through the centre of your being so that I
may pour my powers into you.
I can't gurantee you will live but if it doesn't
work it won't matter.

Ichigo:
Then give me that blade, Soul reaper.

Rukia:
My name is Rukia. Rukia Kachiki.

Ichigo:
And my name is Ichigo Kurosaki.

Rukia:
How could this happen?
I meant to only give him half of my powers 
but he's taken nearly all of them.

Ichigo:
This ends now.

Rukia:
Huh? What kind of being is he?
I've never seen a human with spirit energy
this strong. That's what was jamming my
senses before. Iv'e never heard of a human
with enough strength to break a keido on his 
ownand I have never seen a soul reaper weild 
such a huge zanpakuto.

Ichigo:
You will pay for hurting my family
you hollow scum!
Feel the wrath of my blade!
