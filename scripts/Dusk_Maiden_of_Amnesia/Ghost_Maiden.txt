Teiichi-kun!



Momoe:
"Paranormal Investigation Club Log.
On duty: Momoe Okonogi.
I will organize the rumors about strange occurrences that have happened on school grounds."
Uh! Hm?
Oh, well, here they are.
"While there are quite a few rumors that are most likely entirely unfounded to say the very least."
Hmm...
"Rumors that are most likely entirely..."
"Rumors that are most likely entirely unfounded...
Quite a few of the statements are highly credible."
Hm? Huh?
I swear I put it down there just a second or two ago.
Did it move?
Could it be a poltergeist?!
Maybe there's a ghost right here!
Yeah, right!
I'm just out of it because I didn't get enough sleep.
But I guess these incidents really do happen in some places...
The fact that there are this many reports certainly suggests something is truly here.
Something to be found.
Even as I do this, invisible ghosts could be roaming the campus...
As a member of the Paranormal Investigation Club, I must do everything I can to solve this mystery!
But I don't have a sixth sense or anything like that...
I guess solving something like this will require Niiya-san, huh.
Niiya-san is really amazing.
He takes action, senses the supernatural, and isn't afraid of any old ghosts.
And he's pretty cute.
To be like him, I'll have to work really hard.
And so that means, well, I may not be able to solve this case, I have to do every thing I can in my power.
Huh? What's that?
I don't remember this key chain falling over.
Could it really be...? Is someone here?!

Teiichi:
Oh, hi, Okonogi-san.
How's it going?

Momoe:
Niiya-san!

Teiichi:
What's going on?
Did we get any new information?

Momoe:
Listen, Niiya-san... something paranormal just happened!

Teiichi:
Huh?

Momoe:
This key chain suddenly moved! I think that is a poltergeist!

Teiichi:
Y-Yeah, I was on class duty today...
I mean, n-no! I'm sure... I'm sure it's just your imagination! That's all.

Momoe:
But I'm telling you there's something in this room...

Teiichi:
Ahh... come on, cut it out already!

Momoe:
If even Niiya-san is acting scared... something must really be here!

Teiichi:
Oh, no, no, no, no! That's not what I meant.
Uh, there's no need to worry, Okonogi-san.
There's nothing scary here.

Momoe:
I wonder if that's true.
Niiya-san can communicate with the spirit world, so he could be lying to keep me from worrying.

Teiichi:
I'm not lying, okay?

Momoe:
Huh?
How did you know what I was thinking?! So cool.
I always knew you had supernatural abilities!

Teiichi:
Maybe you're right, huh.

Momoe:
You know, you're really amazing. You have a wonderful gift! I admire you!

Teiichi:
Cut it... Cut it out already, would you?

Momoe:
Sorry...

Wait, if Niiya-san can tell what people are thinking, maybe he knows how I feel about him, too.

Teiichi:
Oh, trust me. I do know.

Momoe:
He really can read my mind?

Teiichi:
Uh...

Momoe:
Then... um...
Niiya-san, answer me this...
What was the birthplace of Mesopotamian civilization?

Teiichi:
No clue...

Momoe:
It worked?! Or did it?
Damn it! I should have asked an easier question than that!

Kirie:
My god... Could you please stop that?

Teiichi:
Kirie-san...

Kirie:
Being around you is embarrassing, flirting all day like that...

Momoe:
I'm sorry, I...

Kirie:
You needn't worry. I was talking to myself.

Momoe:
I-I see! I thought you were talking about me...
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

Kirie:
Stop it!
Niiya! All of this is your fault!

Teiichi:
Huh? My fault?

Momoe:
Oh, no. This is all because Niiya-san and I were getting too close...

Teiichi:
That isn't true at all!

Momoe:
Niiya-san's sixth sense is kicking in again?!

Teiichi:
Huh?

Momoe:
What's the matter, Niiya-san?

Teiichi:
Wh-Why would you ask me about something like that?
I'm not sure if I have an opinion on that sort of thing.

Momoe:
Niiya-san is communicating with the spirit world?!

Kirie:
Niiya! Why are you screwing around?

Momoe:
Don't say that, Kirie-san!
He's communing with the spirit world.
If you interfere, you'll get haunted!

Teiichi and Kirie:
Uh...

Teiichi:
Ahem. Okay, let's officially begin this Paranormal Investigation Club meeting.

Momoe:
Excuse me, but will the club president be missing today's meeting?

Teiichi:
Huh? O-Oh, yeah! The president's... um...
Uh? Oh, right, my phone.
Yes, Niiya speaking.
Oh, President... Hello...
You're always goofing off, aren't you, Miss President?

Momoe:
We haven't even met...
I wish our president would visit us.

Teiichi:
We'll manage. Please don't worry.

Apparently, the president can't make it, due to a cold.
Anyway, go on, Okonogi-san.

Momoe:
Huh? Oh, yes.
I have summarized the verbal interviews.
It appears there is, indeed, some paranormal activity at this school.
The most mysterious rumor concerns this dumbwaiter for school lunches.
Although it's been a while since the school ceased providing lunches, the elevator apparently moves on its own!

Teiichi:
Wow...

Momoe:
Rumor has it that the vengeful spirit of a student, who died when his head got stuck in there, moves the lift.
This spirit lures lone students, just passing by after school, into the dumbwaiter, to abduct them to another world.
I've name it the Vengeful Spirit's Automatic Elevator!

Teiichi and Kirie:
Uh...

Momoe:
Ugh!
Niiya-san! Niiya-san, c-c-could this be...?
Are we witnessing paranormal activity right now?!

Teiichi:
I suppose that's true in one sense, but in another, it really isn't so much.

Kirie:
Well, it looks like a ghost is doing something.

Momoe:
Wh-Wh-What's going on, Niiya-san?!
I'm so scared!

Kirie:
Argh!

Momoe:
Niiya-san!

Kirie:
Niiya!

Momoe:
Niiya-san is actually...

Kirie:
Let's go after him, Okonogi!

Momoe:
O-Okay!



Momoe:
"Paranormal Investigation Club Log.
On duty: Momoe Okonogi.

Uh! Hm?

Yuuko:
Oh...

Momoe:
Oh, well, here they are.

Maybe there's a ghost right here!

Yuuko:
You noticed. Not bad...

Momoe:
Yeah, right!
I'm just out of it because I didn't get enough sleep.

Yuuko:
Figures...

Momoe:
But I guess these incidents really do happen in some places...
The fact that there are this many reports certainly suggests something is truly here.

And he's pretty cute.
To be like him, I'll have to work really hard.

Yuuko:
Look! I'm a ghost.
Uppity kids will get haunted...

Momoe:
And so that means, well, I may not be able to solve this case, I have to do every thing I can in my power.

Yuuko:
Seriously, how dense can you be?

Momoe:
Huh? What's that?
I don't remember this key chain falling over.
Could it really be...? Is someone here?!

Yuuko:
You're a quick one!

Teiichi:
Oh, hi, Okonogi-san.
How's it going?

Momoe:
Niiya-san!

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun!

Teiichi:
What's going on?
Did we get any new information?

Momoe:
Listen, Niiya-san... something paranormal just happened!

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun, you're late.

Momoe:
This key chain suddenly moved! I think that is a poltergeist!

Teiichi:
Y-Yeah, I was on class duty today...
I mean, n-no! I'm sure... I'm sure it's just your imagination! That's all.

Momoe:
But I'm telling you there's something in this room...

Yuuko:
Cat ears.

Teiichi:
Ahh... come on, cut it out already!

Momoe:
If even Niiya-san is acting scared... something must really be here!

Teiichi:
Oh, no, no, no, no! That's not what I meant.
Uh, there's no need to worry, Okonogi-san.
There's nothing scary here.

Momoe:
I wonder if that's true.
Niiya-san can communicate with the spirit world, so he could be lying to keep me from worrying.

Yuuko:
Are you sure you had class duty today?
Maybe your fibbing in it was some girl.

Teiichi:
I'm not lying, okay?

Momoe:
Huh?
How did you know what I was thinking?! So cool.
I always knew you had supernatural abilities!

Teiichi:
Maybe you're right, huh.

Momoe:
You know, you're really amazing. You have a wonderful gift! I admire you!

Yuuko:
Monster antenna!

Teiichi:
Cut it... Cut it out already, would you?

Momoe:
Sorry...

Wait, if Niiya-san can tell what people are thinking, maybe he knows how I feel about him, too.

Yuuko:
I got really bored because you were so late.
You have no idea how I feel.

Teiichi:
Oh, trust me. I do know.

Momoe:
He really can read my mind?

Teiichi and Yuuko:
Ugh...

Momoe:
Then... um...
Niiya-san, answer me this...
What was the birthplace of Mesopotamian civilization?

Yuuko:
Uh... why is she staring at you?

Teiichi:
No clue...

Momoe:
It worked?! Or did it?
Damn it! I should have asked an easier question than that!

Kirie:
My god... Could you please stop that?

Teiichi:
Kirie-san...

Kirie:
Being around you is embarrassing, flirting all day like that...

Momoe:
I'm sorry, I...

Kirie:
You needn't worry. I was talking to myself.

Momoe:
I-I see! I thought you were talking about me...

Yuuko:
You really should smile more.

Momoe:
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

Kirie:
Stop it!

Yuuko:
You're so mean to her all the time!

Kirie:
Niiya! All of this is your fault!

Teiichi:
Huh? My fault?

Momoe:
Oh, no. This is all because Niiya-san and I were getting too close...

Yuuko:
She might be right.
This is all because you can't understand a girl's heart.

Teiichi:
That isn't true at all!

Momoe:
Niiya-san's sixth sense is kicking in again?!

Yuuko:
Hey, Teiichi-kun. Could you take a look at this?

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
I tried wearing a bra today. What do you think?

Momoe:
What's the matter, Niiya-san?

Teiichi:
Wh-Why would you ask me about something like that?

Yuuko:
Because you said you understand girls' hearts.
So I wanted to hear your opinion.

Teiichi:
I'm not sure if I have an opinion on that sort of thing.

Momoe:
Niiya-san is communicating with the spirit world?!

Kirie:
Niiya! Why are you screwing around?

Momoe:
Don't say that, Kirie-san!
He's communing with the spirit world.
If you interfere, you'll get haunted!

Yuuko:
Yeah, I'll haunt you for life.

Teiichi and Kirie:
Uh...

Teiichi:
Ahem. Okay, let's officially begin this Paranormal Investigation Club meeting.

Momoe:
Excuse me, but will the club president be missing today's meeting?

Teiichi:
Huh? O-Oh, yeah! The president's... um...

Yuuko:
Hm-hm.

Teiichi:
Uh? Oh, right, my phone.
Yes, Niiya speaking.

Yuuko:
Hello, this is the president.

Teiichi:
Oh, President... Hello...

Yuuko:
Meetings are boring, so let's skip it and play!

Teiichi:
You're always goofing off, aren't you, Miss President?

Yuuko:
Aw... Come on, spoilsport.

Momoe:
We haven't even met...
I wish our president would visit us.

Teiichi:
We'll manage. Please don't worry.

Apparently, the president can't make it, due to a cold.
Anyway, go on, Okonogi-san.

Momoe:

I've name it the Vengeful Spirit's Automatic Elevator!

Teiichi and Kirie:
Uh...

Momoe:
Ugh!

Yuuko:
You never noticed that it's still operating normally?

Momoe:
Niiya-san! Niiya-san, c-c-could this be...?
Are we witnessing paranormal activity right now?!

Teiichi:
I suppose that's true in one sense, but in another, it really isn't so much.

Kirie:
Well, it looks like a ghost is doing something.

Momoe:
Wh-Wh-What's going on, Niiya-san?!
I'm so scared!

Kirie:
Argh!

Momoe:
Niiya-san!

Kirie:
Niiya!

Momoe:
Niiya-san is actually...

Kirie:
Let's go after him, Okonogi!

Momoe:
O-Okay!

Teiichi:
Wait. So the truth behind this ghost story is...

Yuuko:
Yeah, I was using it because it's so handy.

Teiichi:
And you put people in here this way?

Yuuko:
Not at all.
You're the first person I've ever been in here with.

Teiichi:
What about the part with abduction to another world?

Yuuko:
I don't even know where that is.
I think the rumor has evolved on its own.

Yuuko and Teiichi:
Ah!

Teiichi:
Please don't move so much.

Yuuko:
But there isn't any room.

Teiichi:
W-Wait, and I know, but I'm touching your...

Yuuko:
It's okay, as long as it's you.

Teiichi:
No, it's not okay.

Yuuko:
Oh, you don't wanna touch me?

Teiichi:
Th-That's not the point here.

Yuuko:
I like being touched by you.
You're the only one who ever touches me this way.

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san...

Yuuko:
Other people don't notice when touch them. They don't hear me when I speak to them.
They don't even try to see me--my existence, my actions...
Everything is beyond the perception of living human beings.
It's like I'm not even here. No one pays any attention to me.

Teiichi:
You must be lonely, huh.

Yuuko:
Lonely?

Teiichi:
You mean, you aren't lonely?

Yuuko:
I don't know. I don't really understand "lonely..."

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
But I... I do understand "happy..."

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san...

Yuuko:
Uh...

Teiichi:
It's not that I dislike touching you or anything.
It's just a little embarrassing.

Yuuko:
Thank you, Teiichi-kun. But that's...

Teiichi:
Huh?
Huh? Wha? Aah...!
Wait, wait, I didn't do that on purpose.
I-It just happened. It's not my fault...

Momoe:
Per... Per... Per...

Kirie:
Pervert.

Momoe:
Perfect! Oh, my god!
You threw yourself, head-first, into the mystery and investigated it in the end!
I'm so impressed!
Well, what do you think?

Teiichi:
Huh? Oh, oh no, uh... it's...

Momoe:
Did you go to another world?

Teiichi:
Either Heaven or Hell.

Momoe:
Uh-huh. That really felt like a poltergeist's work, huh?

Teiichi:
Uh, sure.

Kirie:
That was an evil ghost--a nasty, evil ghost, who happens to haunt Niiya.

Momoe:
Actually, I think that thing just now might have been caused by Yuuko-san.
What do you think?

Yuuko:
Uh...

Teiichi:
Um... Wh-Why did you say that?

Momoe:
Because Yuuko-san appears in quite a lot of the school ghost stories.

Kirie:
Well, I suppose that's true...

Teiichi:
I wonder about that, though.
I don't think it's right to blame her for everything that happens here.

Momoe:
Hmm... but doing so does explain a lot of things...
Oh, that reminds me! I have a very special scoop about the same Yuuko-san!

Teiichi:
A special scoop?

Momoe:
Supposedly, Yuuko-san's grave is on the mountain, behind this very school!



Momoe:
Behind the school's highest point, the chairman's office, there's a hill, and I heard that the grave is somewhere along that way.
I think it's our duty to go and check it out.
They say that the grave has the name "Yuuko" engraved on it.

Teiichi:
If Yuuko's name's on that grave, then it must be in, don't you think?

Yuuko:
I really have no idea.
I've never been here before, so I don't know what she's talking about.

Teiichi:
Then I wonder why...

Momoe:
Here it is! This is it!

Teiichi:
You're right. It does say "Yuuko."

Yuuko:
It does. That's weird, 'cause, to think about it, my body is still under the clubroom.

Teiichi:
That's true, I guess. Then what do you think this is?

Momoe:
Niiya-san?

Teiichi:
Ah, no, I was just thinking it's probably not likely that Yuuko's body is actually here.

Momoe:
You're probably right about that.
But, you know...

Teiichi:
But what?

Momoe:
Maybe Yuuko-san was someone who really did exist at this school.
And this grave was erected by someone who really cared about her.
Even if it's a scary ghost story... if it isn't merely just a rumor, but the trace of something that really happened... isn't that kind of romantic?

Yuuko:
Hmph!

Momoe:
(Shriek)
The grave fell over by itself!

Teiichi:
C-Calm down, Okonogi-san!
It's okay. I just tripped and you know...

Momoe:
No, that's not possible! You weren't doing anything! I'm completely positive I saw it!
The grave fell over by itself! This is a curse! A curse, I tell you!
Eek! I'm going to be cursed! Oh my gosh!

Kirie:
Wait, Okonogi!

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun.

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
Could you come here for a just minute?




Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun, isn't this pretty?

Teiichi:
Huh? Oh, uh, yeah.

Yuuko:
Earlier, I said that I didn't know this place, but I come here all the time for the view.

Teiichi:
Yuuk...

Is this a bell?

One of the ghost stories told at Seikyou Academy is of Yuuko-san--a ghost who has lost all memory of her past.
And right now, she is the ghostly president of the Paranormal Investigation Club.
I'm not sure when it started, but she's been possessing me.
I hadn't yet realized... that it was in the truest sense of the word.




The visible soul...
One's invisible shadow...
The mirage that fools the eye...
