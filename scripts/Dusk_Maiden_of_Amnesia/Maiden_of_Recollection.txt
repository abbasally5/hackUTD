  Yuuko:
Please tell me who you are.
I do apologize.
I'm terribly sorry.
I must have forgotten you.

Teiichi:
What do you mean?
It's me, Teiichi Niiya!

Yuuko:
So your name is Teiichi-kun.
Nice to meet you, Teiichi-kun.
It was pleasure.
But now we have to say goodbye.
Don't come to see me again.
You must be someone who caused me pain.
And that's why I forgot all about you.
It's the reason we shouldn't meet anymore.

Teiichi:
I caused you pain?

Yuuko:
What happened to your leg?

Yuuko:
Could I have caused you injury?
I knew it. We shouldn't meet again.
For you sake, too.

Teiichi:
No, wait, Yuuko-san!

Yuuko:
No, don't touch me.
Who are you? Please tell me.



Kirie:
Yuuko's memory is gone?

Teiichi:
Yeah, and apparently any memories she had involving me have been completely removed as well.
She isn't her usual cheery self, either.
I don't know how to say it, but she seems kind of detached.

Kirie:
I see.
It seems to me that Yuuko really might be casting off her memories.

Teiichi:
She's casting off her memories?

Kirie:
She might be doing it to protect herself from all negative or unpleasant memories.
Did you guys have a fight or something like that?

Teiichi:
No...

Kirie:
But I thought you said Yuuko pushed you down the stairs.

Teiichi:
Ugh...
No, Yuuko-san would never...
It must've been an accident or something.

Kirie:
Even if that was an accident, Yuuko is trying to keep you away.
Whether that's out of guilt, or for some other reason, I don't know.
But it seems like she's excised her memories of you.
A kind of forgetfulness, the loss of her memories...
It's amnesia.



Teiichi:
Amnesia?

Kirie:
So that must explain how her naive personality was crafted.

Teiichi:
A crafted personality...

Kirie:
When you did something bad as a kid, didn't you get scolded?
Because the scary memory of being scolded became a kind of trauma, you wouldn't consider doing that now, even though you're older.
But suppose you didn't have the memory of that.

Teiichi:
Then, even if you had the knowledge that it was bad, you wouldn't necessarily feel like it was bad personally.

Kirie:
Saying that people's personalities are products of their pasts isn't totally wrong.
The way people live depends on their experiences.
If it were possible to discard all unpleasant memories of tears or anger, it's possible her carefree personality would be the result.
And now that she's lost even her memories of you, she may no longer be the Yuuko you used to know.
So what did she say?

Teiichi:
She said we shouldn't keep meeting.

Kirie:
And you walked away meekly?

Teiichi:
That isn't...

Kirie:
Then what is your plan, Niiya?

Teiichi:
I don't know yet.
The Paranormal Investigation Club was originally formed to look into Yuuko-san's past, so she could reclaim her memories.
But if she's just going to discard everything we find, I don't see any point in continuing the investigation anymore.

Kirie:
That's not even what I've been talking about.
What I'm asking you, Niiya, is if you're going to resume your relationship with her!

Teiichi:
Uh...
Ow! That hurt! What'd you do that for?

Kirie:
You really are an absolute idiot.
Why are you taking about that now?
If that's what you really think, then isn't everything fine?
After all, you're a living human and a ghost, so you're incompatible, anyway.
You just need to forget about her, too.
And by the way, if you think you can't just forget her, I would be happy to step in as her replacement.

Teiichi:
Huh?

Kirie:
If I grow my hair, I bet I'd look just like her.
Th-That was just a joke.
Laugh, man!

Teiichi:
How can I laugh at a time like this?

Kirie:
Then why did you say that I was a girl, too?

Teiichi:
Huh...

Kirie:
Never mind!
Okonogi was praising you the other day for being reliable because of your ability to take action.

Teiichi:
I'm not really like that at all.

Kirie:
Yeah, you can say that again.

Teiichi:
You're really sticking it to me, huh?

Kirie:
Well, at least, that's the way poor Okonogi sees you.
She thinks you're a man of action.
That's not the only reason she likes you, but maybe that's how you should be from now on.



Teiichi:
The ability to act, huh?
But Yuuko-san doesn't even remember me.
That means we'd basically be meeting for the first time.
So what should I say to her?
Ah...

Yuuko:
Hm?

Yuuko:
No, don't touch me.

Teiichi:
That...

Yuuko:
Don't come to see me again.

Teiichi:
That...

Yuuko:
And goodbye, Teiichi-kun.

Teiichi:
But that...

Kirie:
And now that she's lost, she may no longer be the Yuuko that you used to know.

Teiichi:
That's...

Yuuko:
Please tell me who you are.
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?

Momoe:
Niiya-san?
Are you okay, Niiya-san?!

Teiichi:
Okonogi-san.

Momoe:
Please don't push yourself.
I'll find out some help!

Teiichi:
It's okay.
I just stumbled a bit, that's all.
I'm not used to the crutches yet.

Momoe:
Oh, okay. I'm relieved...
When I saw you like that, my heart almost stopped.
Oh! No...
I mean, you're such an important member of the Paranormal Investigation Club.

Teiichi:
I see.

Momoe:
I'll lend you my shoulder, okay?

Teiichi:
Huh? No, that's not...

Momoe:
Don't worry about it.
I'm actually very strong, you know.
Were you on your way back to class just now?

Teiichi:
Yeah.

Momoe:
All right... Let's go!
I'm honored that I could be of use to you.
I... You can put more weight on me, okay?
I actually don't mind it at all, you know.



Momoe:
Here you go, Niiya-san.
Say "Ah!"

Teiichi:
Uh...

Momoe:
No need to be shy, silly.
You're injured, so being cared for is completely normal.

Teiichi:
You realize it's my leg that's injured, right?

Momoe:
The human body is quite sensitive.
That's why you should be extra careful with everything.
"Ah."

Teiichi:
A-Ah...
Uh...

Momoe:
Is it good? It's good, right?

Teiichi:
Yeah, it's good.

Momoe:
By the way, aren't you coming back to the club room anymore?

Teiichi:
No... It's a little hard for me to get there.

Momoe:
I guess that makes sense.
The floor in the old wing is bad, so it'd be easy to trip.
Please allow your leg to heal quickly, so you can return soon.

Teiichi:
Oh, uh, sure.

Momoe:
All right, sweet omelet is up next.
Say, "Ah."

Teiichi:
Ah...

Momoe:
Oh, uh... my hand slipped...
Niiya-san, I'm silly.



Momoe:
Niiya-san!

Teiichi:
Okonogi-san.

Momoe:
You have a new crutch?

Teiichi:
Yeah, I'm quite a bit better now.

Momoe:
I'm glad to hear that.
But I'm a little sad because I know that soon you won't be needing my help anymore.
But that means you can come back, can't you?

Teiichi:
What do you mean, come back?

Momoe:
Don't be silly.
Back to the club!

Teiichi:
Oh yeah, that's right.



Momoe:
Say, "Ah."

Teiichi:
Ah...
Wow, I've never realized you're such a cook!

Momoe:
Not really. But you like it?

Teiichi:
Yeah.



Momoe:
Niiya-san!

Teiichi:
Okay.
I got it!
What?

Boy:
Who did that?

Girl:
What's she doing over there?

Boy 2:
She should stay out of our way.



Teiichi:
Is there a reason we had to meet here?

Kirie:
Are you honestly sure you're all right with this?

Teiichi:
When you say "this," uh, what do you mean?

Kirie:
Nothing, never mind.

Teiichi:
But now you've piqued my interest.

Kirie:
Then it... really is over.
If that's how things are...

Teiichi:
Huh?

Kirie:
...I won't say anything else.
If you don't see xxx up, I don't know what to say.
Sorry.

Teiichi:
Come on, just tell me how you feel already.
You're not acting like yourself at all.
I mean, what did I do?

Kirie:
You know, I admired you!
And then..
You just...
You can't...
You won't...
Teiichi... you...

Teiichi:
What's wrong, Kirie-san?
Are you okay?

Kirie:
You shouldn't be worrying about me!

Teiichi:
Yeah, but...
Ugh, Kirie-san!
Uh... Kirie-san!

Kirie:
Wh-What... just happened here?
A bell?



Momoe:
That's what she told me.
Can you honestly believe it?
I'm gonna go buy some drinks.
What would you like?

Teiichi:
Oh, I'll let you pick this time.

Momoe:
Okay.

Teiichi:
The paranormal investigation log?
Uh... Yuuko-san... Uh...
Come to think of it, I don't remember how long it's been since I spoke to her last.
Could it be that you're here by now?

Momoe:
Here you go, Niiya-san.

Teiichi:
Uh, thank you.

Momoe:
The wind is really strong today...
I almost tripped over there.
Huh? What's wrong, Niiya-san?

Nishikawa and Kawatou:
Momoe!

Momoe:
Nishikawa-san and Kawatou-san.

Nishikawa:
Oh, so you're the fabled Niiya-kun?

Kawatou:
You're really cute.
I guess it makes sense that you're Momoe's favorite.

Momoe:
Hey! What are you guys talking about?! Geez.

Kawatou:
You're always saying how handsome he is.

Nishikawa:
As your friends, we're obligated to do a quality check.

Kawatou:
Mmhmm.

Momoe:
I-I'm not...

Kawatou:
Well, good luck.

Nishikawa:
Sorry for intruding.

Momoe:
Um... it isn't...
It isn't like that.
I always thought you were cool... you could always get things done.
That's why I admired you, or rather...
I always thought that you were super cool, I'm just saying.

Teiichi:
I'm not... I don't think I'm cool at all.

Momoe:
Please don't say that, Niiya-san.
You were always so cool when you were doing stuff for the... Paranormal Investigation Club.
You made me feel that you were working hard for something, that you were working really hard for someone...
I thought that was wonderful of you to do.

Teiichi:
You felt like I... was working hard for someone?

Momoe:
Um, I...
Niiya-san... is there someone you like, is there?

Teiichi:
Someone I like...
Someone I like...
Someone I like...

Mmhmm.

Momoe:
I though so... That makes sense.
I always kind of knew that.
I knew...
But I still had to try my luck a little.

Teiichi:
I'm sorry, Okonogi-san!
There's someplace I have to go, right now!

Momoe:
Right!
See you later, Niiya-san!



Kirie:
Hey, Niiya!
What are you doing? Even if you go back...

Teiichi:
I'm going to go see Yuuko-san!

Kirie:
I thought you couldn't see her anymore, remember?

Teiichi:
No!
If my feelings are real, I'm sure I'll see her again!

Kirie:
Yuuko has forgotten everything!
She won't remember, no way!
She'd never remember something so painful she cast it off...

Teiichi:
That's not good enough!
If her memories are her heart, then I...
I don't want her to lose any more of them.
And... and I don't want Yuuko-san to forget me.

Kirie:
Niiya...

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san... Yuuko-san!
Yuuko-san... Yuuko-san...
Yuuko-san!

Yuuko:
What?

Teiichi:
You're here.

Yuuko:
Uh...

Teiichi:
Please come with me.

Yuuko:
What?

Teiichi:
You might not remember, but we ate lunch together...
We went for walks... took naps... talked... solved all sorts of ghostly mysteries...
We met in front of the big mirror in the old school wing, where I'd gotten lost...
Discovered your body in the basement...
We founded the Paranormal Investigation Club...

Yuuko:
Who are you? Tell me, please.

Teiichi:
My name is Teiichi. I'm Teiichi Niiya--the Teiichi Niiya who spent all those days with you.
I enjoyed the Paranormal Investigation Club... looking into your past...
I wanted to learn more about you.
But... what I really want to know is who you truly are.

Yuuko:
But why is that?

Teiichi:
Because...
Don't you understand?
It's because I... I'm in love with you!

Yuuko:
Why are you... making that face at me?

Teiichi:
Please remember me... even just a little!
And if you can't do that, at least acknowledge me from now on!
Ah, Yuuko-san!
I-I'm sorry! I...

Yuuko:
Uh...
Teiichi-kun, you touched me again.
The same place you first touched me.

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san, your memory...

Yuuko:
I remember everything all the things we did and said.
Do you know why that is?
Here. Feel how fast my heart is beating?

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san...

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun, I love you!

Teiichi:
And I love you so very much.
Never forget that.

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun...

Momoe:
So that's how it was!

Teiichi:
Gah! I, uh... I, no, I, um...

Momoe:
So that's how it was!
Niiya-san loves the ghost of the old school wing, Yuuko-san!
I understand now...
It all makes perfect sense!
Well, I see that I never had a chance against that famous ghost story.
It's okay.

Teiichi:
Um, no, th-that wasn't...

Momoe:
It wasn't?

Teiichi:
No, you're right.
I do love Yuuko-san.

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun, I love you, too!



Kirie:
If Yuuko pushed away her memory of Niiya, where have the memories been until now?
Was it really...?
A bell...
Shadow Yuuko...
Back there, that was you...

Shadow Yuuko:
Who are you?



Vanished times.
Lost memories.
Revisit them once more.
Happiness is painful.
