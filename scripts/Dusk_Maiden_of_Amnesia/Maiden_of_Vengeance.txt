  Someone 1:
Hey, have you heard it?
The rumor about the monster Akahito-san?

Someone 2:
Is he the one who attacks students who stay late?

Someone 1:
If he catches you, he'll kill you by draining you dry.
That's why he's red... from the blood splashing on him.

Someone 3:
Recently, a lot of people claim to have seen him.

Someone 1:
I heard he was wielding a knife as he chased them.

Someone 2:
Are you serious?

Someone 3:
I don't wanna die...

Someone 2:
You think I do?

Someone (1):
Well, guess what, then...



Teiichi:
It sure is quiet today.

Kirie:
Yesterday, quite a few people came by...

Momoe:
Do you think it's because we don't have enough decorations?
Kirie-san, let's go check the science room we went to yesterday.

Kirie:
Definitely not! Why do I have to go and...

Kirishima:
Excuse me...

Teiichi, Momoe and Kirie:
Uh...

Kirishima:
I heard that I could meet a real one here...

Momoe:
Yes! That's right!
The Paranormal Club's authentic haunted house is right here!

Kirishima:
Oh, really?

Teiichi:
It's dark, so please watch your step.

Kirishima:
Thanks.
You know, I came here because I wanted to meet Yuuko-san.

Teiichi:
Huh?
Wait, does that mean she can see Yuuko-san, too?

Kirie:
Well, she said "Yuuko," but she probably meant from the stories.
I mean, that is the school's most famous ghost story.

Momoe:
Speaking of ghost stories, have you heard that Akahito-san rumors going around?

Teiichi:
Akahito-san?

Momoe:
A monster that appears after school, and attacks the students.

Kirie:
M-Monster...?

Momoe:
But it's strange...

Teiichi:
Hm?

Momoe:
The real Akahito-san in the legend was actually a servant of the gods.

Kirie:
The legend?

Momoe:
Yes, the legend about a human offering.

Teiichi:
What do you mean "offering?" Like a sacrifice?

Momoe:
A long time ago, the people who lived here believed the lands were cursed by the gods' anger.
In order to appease their fury, Akahito, servant of the gods, would select one villager to take to the gods...
That's the legend of human offerings that involves Akahito-san.

Kirie:
Then why is he suddenly a monster?

Momoe:
Huh? You're already done?

Teiichi:
Did you get to see Yuuko-san?

Kirishima:
Yeah... It was very scary.
Thank you so much.

Momoe:
Come again!

Kirie:
Is it just me or you guys, that did she not look scared at all?

Teiichi:
Yeah, you're right.

Yuuko:
She's lying.
She didn't see a thing--not a single scary thing.

Teiichi:
Then, why did she...?



Girl 1:
There she is.
Have you heard? Is it really true?

Girl 2:
Someone from another class saw Akahito-san this morning!

Girl 3:
That makes thirteen times.
I think someone will definitely be attacked this time...

Girl 1:
What should we do? I don't wanna die...

Kirishima:
Don't worry.
I'll protect you, no matter what.

Girl 1:
Thank you... Yuuko.



Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun, this way!
Hey, what kind of food do you wanna try next?

Teiichi:
What? Are you killing me? You still wanna eat more?

Yuuko:
We've only had fried octopus, fried noodles, chicken skewers, and kebabs.
Oh, that's right. And cotton candy.

Teiichi:
I think that's more than enough.

Yuuko:
No way!
We still haven't had ramen burgers, oyaki dumplings, crepes or candied apples!

Teiichi:
Okay, okay...

Yuuko:
What's wrong, Teiichi-kun?

Teiichi:
Oh, nothing.
It just seems like rumors about Akahito-san are everywhere.

Yuuko:
Hmm... looks that way.

Teiichi:
Are there actually any ghosts here at the school that you know about, I mean, besides you, of course.

Yuuko:
Hmm... I've never met one.
Besides, Akahito-san is technically a monster, not a ghost.

Teiichi:
I suppose that's true, but...
Huh? What is this?

Yuuko:
What's going on?

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san, over there!
Could that be...? Is that Akahito-san?

Kirishima:
(Shriek)

Kirie:
Hey, Niiya!

Momoe:
Niiya-san.

Teiichi:
What in the world happened here?
That's...

Kirie:
Apparently, she was attacked by Akahito-san.

Teiichi:
Yeah, but... Akahito-san is...



Girl 1:
Did you hear... about how we can appease Akahito-san?

Boy 1:
Akahito-san wants a human sacrifice.

Boy 2:
If we don't offer one, every single one of us is going to be killed.

Girl 2:
The sacrifice is the one who stays latest after school.

Girl 3:
The one who never leaves the campus, and who haunts the school for eternity.
Yuuko-san...

Yuuko-san...
She's in the old school wing... in the very last room.

Girls:
Open up, quick! Yuuko-san! Come out!
I know you're here!
Open up, quick!

Teiichi:
Why do they want Yuuko-san?
Come on, guys! You gotta calm down!
Why do you mean to...?

Girls:
I know she's here!
We know you guys are hiding Yuuko-san!

Kirie:
This is totally pointless.

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san, please run away!
At this rate, we...

Momoe:
Huh? Yuuko-san?

Momoe:
Okonogi, what are you doing?

Momoe:
Oh, I'm sorry.

Girls:
Hand over Yuuko-san!
Give me Yuuko-san now...

Teiichi:
Ah!

Momoe:
Niiya-san!

Girls:
...Yuuko-san.

Teiichi:
Please stop it!
What's wrong with all of you?

Boy:
We'll be killed... We'll all be killed!
Run, everybody! Run!

Teiichi:
What just happened?
Yuuko-san?

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun, are you all right?

Teiichi:
So it was you after all.

Yuuko:
I went out (of) the window, then circle back around.

Teiichi:
I see...
Uh, you aren't hurt, are you?

Kirishima:
Such a shame... Though so close.
Hello there.

Teiichi:
It's you...

Kirishima:
I haven't introduced myself yet. My name is Yuuko Kirishima.

Teiichi:
Yuuko?

Kirishima:
Surely, you are well aware of what sort of connotation that name carries in this school.
I hate those who blindly believe in ghost stories.
I hate the ones who spread the ghost stories.
And I really hate people like you, who fuss over them as if they're fun.
Nothing could be better than being able to crush all of that.

Teiichi:
I see, so you're the one who started all of this trouble.

Kirishima:
Yuuko-san should just disappear forever.
I'll destroy ghost stories!



Kirishima:
I will destroy...

I will destroy...
I will destroy... all the ghost stories!
I will destroy!

I will destroy ghost stories and all those who believe in them, everyone and everything!
All of them!

Girl 1:
Yuuko!

Kirishima:
You guys...

Girl 1:
Yuuko! What should we do?
We couldn't find Yuuko-san!
None of us want to die!

Girl 3:
Is Akahito-san going to kill us?

Kirishima:
No, the one Akahito-san will kill is Yuuko-san.

Girl 1:
Yuuko-san?

Kirishima:
Yeah. That's why Akahito-san is searching for Yuuko-san.
For the sacrifice, the one who's required has to be Yuuko-san.

Girl 2:
Akahito-san is gonna kill Yuuko-san?

Girl 3:
To sacrifice her?

Kirishima:
That's right...
Akahito-san is going to kill Yuuko-san.

Girl 1:
Then, if Yuuko-san dies, we're going to be safe?

Kirishima:
Don't worry.
I will protect you guys, no matter what.
You can trust me.

Girl 1:
Thank you so much, Yuuko. I mean, Yuuko-san.

Kirishima:
Huh?



Teiichi:
Destroying a ghost story...
Do you think that sort of thing is really possible?

Yuuko:
I'm not sure.
But maybe, if, say, someone started a rumor... about Akahito-san killing Yuuko-san, it might be possible.

Teiichi:
Yeah, but that's...
Would you really be okay with that?

Yuuko:
Okay or not, I have no real right to stop her, if that's what she honestly wants.
Because of my existence, she was bullied in her entire life.
It's only natural that she would hate me.

Teiichi:
But that... I know that's horrible, but...
If that happened, wouldn't it be painful for you?

Yuuko:
Painful?

Teiichi:
Huh?

Kirie:
Niiya!

Teiichi:
Kirie-san?

Kirie:
Come quickly! The students made Kirishima human sacrifice.

Teiichi:
What do you mean?
I thought Kirishima-san was the one behind Akahito-san thing?

Kirie:
Those guys took the rumors too seriously and went nuts!
There's no telling what they'll do.
Let's go, Yuuko-san.

Yuuko:
Me?
But... she did all this because she hates me and...

Teiichi:
It doesn't matter.
Because you're the one she holds a grudge against, you have to be the one who saves her when she is in trouble!



Kirishima:
No! I'm not Yuuko-san! I'm not the sacrifice!

Girl 1:
I'm so relieved...

Girl 3:
Now we don't have to die.

Girl 2:
Akahito-san will forgive us now.

Kirishima:
Since it seems no one noticed, I'll tell you, I was actually behind Akahito-san.
I set this all up, so...
Are you listening?
Everyone, listen to me!
Please listen, everyone.
Listen, all guys, please!
What the hell is Yuuko-san?!
What the hell is Akahito-san?!
You guys must be really stupid if you're so frightened of things that don't exist!
You listen up, you're all a bunch of idiots, who could never, ever...

Girl 1:
They do exist. Akahito-san exists.

Girl 2:
That's right.
I mean, every single one of us is so frightened.

Girl 3:
That's why we need Yuuko-san.
We only need to hand over Yuuko-san, and no one will be attacked anymore.

Guys:
We won't have to be scared anymore.

What is the sacrifice?

Akahito-san wants Yuuko-san's blood.

Yuuko-san's blood...

If we give him Yuuko-san...

To dye his coat red.

Akahito-san will forgive us.

Yuuko-san will save us.

That's what the sacrifice is for, right?

No one wants to die.

Yuuko-san will save everyone.

I don't wanna die...

I'm afraid of dying.

I'll finally be able to focus on class.

All we need is to shed Yuuko-san's blood...

I'll finally be able to sleep.

It's thanks to Yuuko-san.

All we need to do is offer Yuuko-san...

Yuuko-san... Yuuko-san is...

You wouldn't abandon us, right?

Yuuko-san was chosen by Akahito-san.

We believe in you, Yuuko-san.

That's why he's searching for her.

Please bleed, Yuuko-san.

You must be happy that you can save everyone.

Yuuko-san will turn from a ghost story into a legend.

Yuuko-san, you're amazing.

Are you ready, Yuuko-san?

Yuuko-san will save all of us?

Hurry and shed Yuuko-san's blood.

Please, Yuuko-san, bleed, just bleed, Yuuko-san.

Akahito-san will...

If you do, everyone can be happy!

Girl:
Thank you, Yuuko-san.

Boy:
It's Akahito-san.

Akahito:
You are not Yuuko-san.

Yuuko:
I'm sorry.

Akahito:
This is not Yuuko.
Deception is a grave offense.
And all of you will pay with your blood.

Girl 3:
We'll be killed! Save me!

Girl 1:
I don't wanna die!



Teiichi:
Are you injured?

Kirishima:
You...
J-Just now, I-I saw...
Is that...

Teiichi:
It was her, Yuuko-san, the ghost of the old school wing.

Kirishima:
Huh?



Kirishima:
Aren't you afraid of ghost stories?

Teiichi:
Huh? No, not really.

Teiichi:
Uh, by the way, Kirishima-san, for you, Yuuko-san might embody everything you hate.
But the real Yuuko-san is... she is not a scary ghost.
Actually, she...

Kirishima:
You may be right.

Teiichi:
Huh?

Kirishima:
I mean, at least I don't have to worry about you calling me Yuuko-san, do I?

Teiichi:
Uh...
Yuuko-san...

Kirishima:
Huh?
I'm sorry...

Yuuko:
Uh...

Teiichi:
Um, Yuuko-san...

Yuuko:
Hm? What is it?

Teiichi:
I'm sorry as well. What I said before was out of line.

Yuuko:
No, I was happy.
Because of the things you say, I am...
Thanks.



Momoe:
Um, Kirie-san, why did we ring this thing?

Kirie:
Hmm? I guess it was a little scare tactic.

Momoe:
What? You're telling me it was just a prank?!

Kirie:
It wasn't really a prank so much.

Momoe:
This is bad!
We have to get out of here, or a teacher's gonna find us!
Kirie-san, hurry...
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god...

Kirie:
Jeez...
Ah!



The carved name is my symbol.
What I can see is my truth.
I want to forget, I want to forget.
Crying in fear.
