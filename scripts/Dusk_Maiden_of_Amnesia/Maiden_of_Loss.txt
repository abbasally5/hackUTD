  Yuuko:
The weather is great today.

Teiichi:
Huh? Th-This is Y-Y-Y-Yuuko-san?

Yuuko:
Oh, I gained a little...

Teiichi:
Oh, no! I-I shouldn't look!
I-I can't turn my eyes away!
I get it.
This is Yuuko-san's memory.
No way! No, Yuuko-san, don't!



Teiichi:
What I'm seeing is her memory from sixty years ago.
It's inside Yuuko-san's...
No, it's the memory inside the Shadow Yuuko that Yuuko-san excised.
I'm powerless.
I saw...
I'm sorry, Yuuko-san...
Uh, her chest is so heavy...
I see.
I'm experiencing everything felt by Yuuko-san firsthand.
Ah, that's...

Yukariko:
Nee-sama.

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
Yukariko.

Teiichi:
Yukariko?
Could that be Yuuko-san's sister?
That means she's Kirie-san's...

Yukariko:
Are you going to visit that little girl again?
You just went there.

Yuuko:
Yes, Asa-chan didn't feel well yesterday, either.
I figured I'd try to take care of her as much as possible.

Yukariko:
Please stop doing that!
If you also contracted that illness...!

Yuuko:
I'll be fine. It's only a cold.
The doctors said it's okay, too.

Yukariko:
But something bad could still happen!
It's careless for you to be around her like that.
If something happened to you because of her, I don't know what I do and...

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san?

Yuuko:
Why are you still talking like that.
Get a hold of yourself.
Right now, the village is in trouble.
Everyone should help each other.
You should help as well.

Yukariko:
I am not a child.

Teiichi:
Yukariko-san, huh?

Yuuko:
That girl...

Teiichi:
Mmm, it's sweet.
I can even feel what Yuuko-san's lips feel.

Yuuko:
Ow! My pinkie...

Teiichi:
Ow, ow, ow... Be careful, Yuuko-san...
That hurts...

This used to be a mining town.
I think it was copper...

Cat:
Meow...

Yuuko:
Oh, a kitty.
I'll give you something later.

Teiichi:
Huh? Smells like something's burning.

Yuuko:
It's coming from Nakamura-san's...
I guess they all passed away.

Teiichi:
I see.
This is the pandemic mentioned on the Stone of Curses--the one that killed so many villagers.
And the one that Yuuko-san was sacrificed to stop...

Yuuko:
Excuse me. I'm coming in.

Teiichi:
It's so quiet. Is someone really here?

Yuuko:
Good morning, Asa-chan. How are you feeling?
I brought breakfast. Let's eat together!

Asagi:
It's fine. I'm going to die soon anyway.

Yuuko:
Asa-chan...

Asagi:
How is it? The fish is from a can.
It's good, right?

Teiichi:
It tastes like normal canned fish.
Oh, right! Back then, canned goods were a luxury.

Yuuko:
Are you full already?
Then how about some candy?

Asagi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
Here you go.
Isn't it good?

Asagi:
Mmm...

Yuuko:
I'm glad...

Asagi:
I'm afraid that if you keep coming here, you'll become infected, too.

Yuuko:
I'll be fine.
The doctor said that you don't have the disease.
So I won't get infected.

Asagi:
That's a lie.

Yuuko:
It is not.

Asagi:
Liar...
You're such a liar!
My dad, my mom, my grandma, my brother...
They all... They all...

Yuuko:
Yes, what happened to them was terrible...
But you're gonna be fine.

Asagi:
That's not true. It's a lie!
I'm going to die of this disease soon, too!

Yuuko:
Asa-chan...

Asagi:
Don't! You'll get infected and die too!

Yuuko:
No, I won't. It's yummy.

Asagi:
No, don't!
If you were to die, I... I don't...

Yuuko:
Don't worry. I won't die.

Asagi:
Yuuko-neechan...

Yuuko:
I won't die.

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san...

Yuuko:
I know, you can have this.

Asagi:
This is...

Yuuko:
A charm.
Think of it as me when I can't be here.
See? They match!

Asagi:
Yuuko-neechan!

Yukariko:
Nee-sama.

Yuuko:
Yukariko, you were waiting for me?

Yukariko:
Being alone was scary...

Teiichi:
She's crying.
She's so much like Kirie-san.

Yuuko:
I'm sorry. Let's go home together.
Did you talk to anyone?

Yukariko:
Uh-uh. I didn't.
All the adults are kind of intimidating...
Everyone is pretty uncertain.
But I'm sure they're trying to come up with a solution.
How long will this go on?

Yuuko:
I don't know.
But you mustn't lose hope.
We have to stay positive.

Yukariko:
Nee-sama...

Yuuko:
If you give up hope, everything is over.

Yukariko:
Okay. Huh?

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yukariko:
That's the mayor and the other adults...
Are they going to the school?

Yuuko:
I bet they're going to discuss what we should do from now on.
We should go, too.

Yukariko:
But...

Yuuko:
This concerns everyone.
We should hear what they have to say.

I wonder where they went...

Men:
Enough!
At this rate, the entire village will be wiped out!

Even still... there's nothing we can do.

It's quite unfortunate about the Nakamuras.
Now all of them are gone.

We burned their belongings, clothes, tatami mats, dressers, everything...

How many does this make?

This is the thirteenth entire family we've lost to the disease.

Even now, half the families have at least one infected member.
I won't last much longer, either...

What are we gonna do?
Just wait for everyone in the village to die?!

Why is this happening?

It's the Curse! It must be the Curse...

What curse?

The school was built atop the remains of a shrine!

You say the remains of a shrine, but it was burned in the air raid.
Nothing was left behind.

That doesn't matter, the shrine was standing here.
Was it properly purified?
Maybe the purification was insufficient?

Only human sacrifice.

Teiichi:
Ah!

Men:
You're right...
Our village's been cursed for building the school here without a human sacrifice!

The gods were angered because something else was built here without the proper offerings.
Every member of this council knows it.

That may be... but it's too late for any of us to do anything about it now...

No, we must make a human sacrifice at once!

The shrine is still beneath the school!
If we open it up, we can make the offering immediately!

If that would be enough to soothe the god's' wrath...
But whom would we sacrifice?

It's hard to decide.
We don't have any criminals in the village...

That would be useless.
The gods won't be satisfied with criminals or old people on the verge of death!
The best sacrifice is a young, innocent life!
And all of us know that.

But the children are the village's treasure!
And if the rest of the village knew, surely they would never allow such...

So many men have already died.
Just one more won't worry anyone.

We'll just say that the disease claimed another victim.

But who could be such a candidate?

Gentlemen, I believe it's time we pick an Akahito.
And entrust everything to them!

Akahito...

The name will be written on "copper", and is pronounced "Akahito".
The servant of the copper mountain's god.
We'll draw lots and select the villager to be Akahito.
The one who becomes Akahito will then choose a child to offer as a sacrifice to the shrine.

Yukariko:
Nee-sama...

Yuuko:
Let's go.

Man:
Who's there?

Yuuko:
This way!

Teiichi:
This is... the Paranormal Investigation Club room?

Men:
Where did you go?

Hey, get back here.

Teiichi:
But there isn't any hole in the wall!

Yukariko:
Nee-sama...

Yuuko:
Shh, quiet.

Men:
Find them!

They got away.
Think they heard us?

If they hadn't, they wouldn't have run!

What should we do?

By the way, I think that shrine is around here...

Oh, that's right...
This isn't the time! We need to go after them!

You're right!

Spread out and look for them!
 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:0:&lt;h1&gt; 

Don't let them get away!

Yuuko:
It's okay...

Teiichi:
That's...



Asagi:
Thank you for the meal.

Yuuko:
Sorry, it was so sparse!
I'll make some tea.

Yukariko:
I'll do that, Nee-sama.

Yuuko:
Really? Thank you.

Yukariko:
Mmhmm.

Asagi:
Yuuko-neechan, are you sure it's okay for me to live here?

Yuuko:
Your color is returning.
I told you, it really was just a cold.

Teiichi:
Those people were talking about sacrificing a child.
That's why they couldn't leave Asa-chan by herself and brought her here.

Yukariko:
All the adults are so busy, they can't handle anymore, and we have spare rooms here.

Yuuko:
Drink it while it's hot, and warm yourself up.
While you're still weak, you should be careful, or you really will catch that disease.

Asagi:
Mmhmm.



Teiichi:
I looked again...

Yukariko:
Nee-sama? Can I come in, too?

Teiichi:
What?! No, no, no, th-that's not o-okay!

Yuuko:
Are you scared on your own?

Yukariko:
Nee-sama, those people...

Yuuko:
A human sacrifice would never be seen as acceptable in this day and age.
We're living in a time of science, with cars, and with airplanes that fly through the air.
Whom do they expect that superstition to save?

Yukariko:
Then, what do we do?

Yuuko:
I have to stop them somehow.

Yukariko:
No! If you do that and anything happens to you...

Yuuko:
I don't care!
I'm not interested in saving only myself!

Yuuko:
What are you doing?!

Teiichi:
Aw...

Yukariko:
Trying to get through you!
Even if you say so, I will not allow it!
You should place more value on your life...

Yuuko:
Who do you take me for?!
I can't possibly run away alone, not when we should be helping each other!

Teiichi:
Hmm...

Yuuko:
Why won't you understand?

Teiichi:
Can't you see, Yuuko-san, Yukariko-san is worried about you, too.

Yuuko:
The moon is so pretty.

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san really was compassionate, wasn't she?
I guess I shouldn't be surprised, she's a normal girl after all.



Yuuko:
Asa-chan, I asked the doctor to come treat you here.
Asa-chan?

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
Oh, she took this off again...
What's she going to do if her cold returns?
Yukariko, where's Asa-chan?

Yukariko:
Is she not in the living room?

Yuuko:
No.

Yukariko:
Then I don't know.

Yuuko:
I see.
Yukariko, how long ago did you see Asa-chan in the living room?

Yukariko:
I saw her before I took my bath.

Yuuko:
You haven't seen her since?

Yukariko:
No, I went directly back to my room.
Are you mending that?

Yuuko:
Huh?

Yukariko:
Where did that big tear come from?

Yuuko:
Ah!
You stay here!

Yukariko:
Nee-sama...?

Yuuko:
Asa-chan!

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san, don't go!

Yuuko:
That shed?

Teiichi:
You can't go!

Yuuko:
I won't permit this...

Teiichi:
No, Yuuko-san!
It isn't Asa-chan!
History's proven it!
Yuuko-san!

Yuuko:
That's...
Ah! Asa-chan...

Teiichi:
Don't! Please don't go, Yuuko-san!

Yuuko:
Stop it!

Teiichi:
People...

Yuuko:
What are you doing?
Asa-chan...

Asagi:
Yuuko-neechan!

Men:
Akahito-sama has spoken a name!

Akahito-sama has spoken a name!

Akahito-sama has chosen a sacrifice...

Akahito-sama has chosen!

Akahito-sama has chosen a human sacrifice!

Human sacrifice...

There she is...

Yuuko:
Run!

Asagi:
Yuuko-neechan! No!

Yuuko:
Stop it!
Stop! Stop it!
No!

Men:
That's it.

Yuuko:
No!

Teiichi:
No, this is bad!
Yuuko-san, run!

Yuuko and Teiichi:
Aaah!



Yuuko:
What is this place?

Teiichi and Yuuko:
Aw!

Teiichi:
My leg... the born is...

Yuuko:
It hurts... It hurts...

Teiichi:
This is horrible. It's too horrible...
Don't they realize there's no way something like this would cure anyone?!
There's no way anyone would be saved by this!

Yuuko:
I'm glad.

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
Asa-chan didn't have to become the human sacrifice.
If I become the sacrifice...
If I die, Asa-chan and Yukariko won't... won't...
I'm glad...
This was good...
I'm glad...

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san...

Yuuko:
This... Is that the shrine?

Teiichi:
Don't do it, Yuuko-san.
If you force yourself to move...

Yuuko:
What? What is this?
I'm scared! I'm scared!
Dying?
I'm going to die?
No!

Teiichi:
Please don't move, Yuuko-san...
Your leg!

Yuuko:
Someone! It hurts!
My leg is broken!
Call a doctor!
Please help me... Please let me out!
I'll do anything. I'll do whatever you say! Please!
Help me! You can hear me, right? Just help me!
Forgive me. Please forgive me...
I beg of you...
Please tell me why. What did I do wrong?
Why? Why? Why?
No!

Why...?
It hurts...
It hurts...

Teiichi:
I know it does.

Yuuko:
It's cold. So cold...

Teiichi:
I know it is.

Yuuko:
There's no food, then I'm hungry...

Teiichi:
I know you are.

Yuuko:
I'm scared...

Teiichi:
I know.

Yuuko:
Why me?
I didn't... I didn't do anything wrong...
Why is this happening to me?

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san...

Yuuko:
Who was it?
Who decided... Who decided that I would be the sacrifice?
Akahito-san...
Is she the one to blame?

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san, no!

Yuuko:
I was so nice to her.
It's because she called my name.

Teiichi:
No, it isn't her fault!

Yuuko:
I hate her... I hate that girl...
She did this to me...
Asa!

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san!

Yuuko:
What am I thinking?
Of course it's not her fault.
She is just a little girl.
But it... it's so painful...
I can't take it.
It hurts...
I can't hate Asa-chan.
I won't...
I just can't...
That isn't who I really am.
I don't get angry...
I try to love everyone.

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
I'm not at fault...
Someone else I don't hate...
I don't hate anyone...
I can't, that's just not... me...

Shadow Yuuko:
Yes, I was the one who hated.
Hate... Hate... Hate... Hate...
I hate those who sacrificed me to try to survive...
I hate those who killed me!
Hate... Hate... Hate... Hate!



Teiichi:
That... was Shadow Yuuko's memory?
That was the beginning of Yuuko-san's ghost story.

Yuuko:
What am I... What am I doing here?

Shadow Yuuko:
I hate you...
You who discarded me.



Invisible you.
Soundless you.
Untouchable you.
You... You...
