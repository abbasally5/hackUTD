  Kirie:
Why? Why? Why did this happen to me?



Kirie:
I knew this wouldn't be my kind of thing.

I suppose that there is a genuine one here, but...

Teiichi:
Our ghostly club president had this sudden idea...

Kirie:
That isn't an actual reason to do this.
I mean, a haunted house...

Momoe:
You can even summon an actual ghost...
You truly are amazing, Niiya-san!
Ghost-san, thank you for helping us with the cultural festival.
We really appreciate it.

Teiichi:
Are you okay with this?
I thought... I thought you wouldn't like playing this kind of part.

Yuuko:
It's fine. Festivals aren't held every day.
We should just enjoy it.

Teiichi:
Whoa! Wait... Yuuko-san...

Momoe:
Frustrating, isn't it?
Not having time to properly decorate this location.

Kirie:
Huh? What are you talking about?

Momoe:
If only we'd finished our preparations a little earlier...

Kirie:
O-Oh... That's what you meant.

Momoe:
I got it!
Do you wanna come with me and look for things we can use to decorate the haunted house?

Kirie:
What? Uh, why me?

Teiichi:
Wait, Yuuko-san... Not so close.
Y-You're touching my...

Yuuko:
By the way, Teiichi-kun...
Could you tell me what it is that I'm touching?
You... You have to ask?

Kirie:
Let's go, Okonogi.

Momoe:
Huh? K-Kanoe-san?

Teiichi & Yuuko:
Huh?



Momoe:
But, please wait!

Kirie:
Come on!
Why? Why does this annoy me so much?!

Momoe:
Kanoe-san? Kanoe-san!

Kirie:
Hm?

Momoe:
Kanoe-san, what has gotten into you?

Kirie:
Nothing.

Momoe:
Hey, by the way...
This is weird. Where are we?

Kirie:
What do you mean?
Okay...



Teiichi:
But how do you plan to scare anyone, given that only Kirie-san and I can see you?

Yuuko:
Usually, that's true.
But remember, others have been able to see me before, when the situation is right.

Teiichi:
You mean...

Yuuko:
Yeah.
If we can create an atmosphere that makes it easier to see something...
The dark haunted house in the back of the mysterious old school wing.
It will become a place where they can imagine all kinds of creepy things
And then I've got 'em.
Well, it won't do anything for those who are unafraid of ghosts.
But you can't have them all.
So, I am... ready for... this.

Teiichi:
Y-You ready, huh?

Yuuko:
What I mean... is that only one thing is left to do.

Kirie:
Um, well... I'm pretty sure this way.

Momoe:
Really? Do you get lost often, too, like I do?
Huh?

Kirie:
The old science room.
We should be able to find a few things around here to decorate the haunted house.
Let's take a look.

Momoe:
D-Don't, Kanoe-san!
It's dangerous to enter the old science room!

Kirie:
Huh? Why's that?

Momoe:
You don't know? The Heartless Anatomical Models!

Kirie:
Wait a second.

Kirie:
I'm pretty sure those models never had any feelings.

Momoe:
That's not it!
There's a ghost story, involving a brutal play on words about anatomical models.
It's one of the scariest rumors at this school...



Yuuko:
Oh, nooo!

Teiichi:
Wh-What the...?
I-I don't get it. What's so funny about this?

Yuuko:
It just is.

Momoe:
The anatomical models in the old science room have no hearts.
The rumor goes that they wander around in the night, seeking to find their lost hearts.

Kirie:
A-A rumor... right?

Momoe:
On his final rounds, the janitor felt someone behind him.
When he turned around, an anatomical model that didn't belong there was directly behind him...
The next morning, they found the janitor's body with his heart cut out.

Kirie:
Wh-What?

Momoe:
And where is that anatomical model now?
Because I don't see it anywhere.

Momoe:
But... according to the story, it should...
Huh?
(Shriek)
I-It's here... The model is here.
And it really doesn't have a h-heart!
I... have to run.
Fast... Fast...
I-I-I-I have to run...

Kirie:
Okonogi!
Take a good look!
That model isn't going anywhere.
It certainly won't take your heart, either.
It's merely an object.
If you keep your head, this is nothing.

Momoe:
Wow...
Kanoe-san, you really are absolutely cool!
You're always so uber-calm and collected!
You're pretty and have a nice figure too.
I wish I could be more like you...

Kirie:
I'm not like that at all.

Momoe:
Huh?

Kirie:
I'm not pretty, or anything like that...
My hair's short.
Uh... my chest is...

Huh?

Momoe:
Go! Get out!
Shoo! Shoo!
That was pretty spooky, huh, Kanoe...
She's crying...
Are you okay?

Kirie:
Seriously... what's going on here?

Momoe:
I guess some things even scare you, don't they, Kanoe?

Kirie:
Of course!

Hey, Okonogi...

Momoe:
We've switched roles, huh?

Kirie:
And we're really bringing this along with us?

Momoe:
Of course, we are.
It's gonna make Niiya-san so happy.



Girls:
(Shriek)
A ghost!
Dumplings are so scary!
No, not extra lessons!

Teiichi:
I guess they really do see what they're afraid of.

Yuuko:
One group down!

Teiichi:
Y-Yuuko-san, come on... What if the others would come back?

Yuuko:
Oh, you're such a perv...
Were you planning to do something that might look bad?

Teiichi:
Y-You know that's not what I meant.

Yuuko:
I was just joking.
Anyway, those two are probably out there enjoying themselves right now.



Momoe:
Kanoe-san, over here!

Kirie:
This isn't really my scene...

Momoe:
Huh? Is something wrong?

Kirie:
Uh, no no, not really.
O-Okonogi, your tongue is bright red!

Momoe:
It's from a candied apple.
It represents what makes these food stands so much fun.
Here you go!

Kirie:
What's this? Some kind of wafer?

Momoe:
What? It's for scooping goldfish.

Kirie:
What? Usually, those are made from paper and...

Momoe:
That goldfish with the bulging eyes is so cute!

Kirie:
Are you even listening to me?
Wow, that one looks just like you...

Momoe:
Hey! That's really mean!

Kirie:
Didn't you just say you think it's cute?

Momoe:
But those are completely separate things.

Kirie:
All right. I'll fish it out for you.

Momoe:
Come on, let's go over here!



Momoe:
Wanna check that out next, Kanoe-san?

Kirie:
Okonogi... Hang on.
Do you think maybe you could... call me Kirie?
And not call me by my last name anymore?

Momoe:
Sure, I can, but... but why?

Kirie:
What do you mean, why?
It's just... Kanoe is...

Nishikawa:
Momoe!

Momoe:
Nishikawa-san! Kawatou-san!

Kawatou:
Great, we've found you. Where have you been?

Momoe:
Is something wrong?

Kawatou:
Well, actually, we...
Oh...

Momoe:
What's wrong, Hitomi?

Nishikawa:
Oh, I see...

Momoe:
Wh-What's up with you two?

Nishikawa:
Momoe, come here for a second.

Momoe:
Sorry I kept you waiting!

Kirie:
What? Is everything okay?

Momoe:
Sure... Well...

Kirie:
What...?



Nishikawa:
Stop struggling!

Kirie:
Hey, wh-what are you doing?
S-Stop it!
Wh-What are you thinking?

Kawatou:
All right, let's get started.

Kirie:
No, stay away from me!

Momoe:
Don't be scared. Don't be scared.
You'll be fine.



Boy:
Argh!
Stop!
Don't look under the bed!
The reanimation spell!

Yuuko:
Man, they all run away so fast.
No challenge.

Teiichi:
Uh...



Momoe:
You look adorable!

Girl1:
Welcome back, Onii-chan!

Girl2:
I knew it would look great on you...

Girl3:
Having a good base to work with makes such a difference.

Kirie:
How do I end up here?

Momoe:
Okay, we have some customers all ready waiting!
You have to go greet them now!

Kirie:
Hey, hey, hey, hang on a second...

Momoe:
Good luck! Have a great time!

Everyone:
Huh?

Kirie:
Uh, yeah... uh...
W... We... Wel... Welcome back, Onii-chan...

Everyone:
Oh!

Momoe and Girls:
All right!

Girl4:
Could I order, please?

Kirie:
Yeah, right away.

Boy:
Me too, please.

Girl5:
Me next!

Girl6:
Over here, quickly!

Kirie:
U-Um, well...

Girl7:
She's so cute when she's confused, too.

Kirie:
C-Cute?
Here you go, Onii-chan.
Welcome back, Onii-chan.
What the...?
This is really...



Announcer:
Today's cultural festival is now closed.
Let's give it our best again tomorrow, so that our festival will be a success.
Everyone'll have a wonderful day!

Girl:
Good work, everyone!

Kirie:
I'm exhausted...

Momoe:
You want some tea?

Kirie:
Juice is fine, yeah...

Momoe:
Okay, I'll get you some right away.

Kirie:
I guess I went over pretty well...
Maybe I'm not the bottom of the barrel, after all.
My chest isn't big enough, but my skin's not too bad.
If my hair were long like this, my face'd look even more like...
Would look like...
Who? Like... Almost like...

Momoe:
Huh? What's wrong?
What about your juice?

Kirie:
Why? Why? Why does this annoy me so much?!

What a horrible face...

Yuuko:
Is that because...?
Because it looks like mine?

Kirie:
Yuuko...

Yuuko:
Doesn't something about me bother you?

Kirie:
What are you talking about?
Why should I be...?

Yuuko:
Really? Am I wrong?
You may be right.
But you want to be like me.

Kirie:
No! Stop spouting nonsense!

Yuuko:
But it isn't nonsense.
I think you want to be me.

Kirie:
That's... not true!
It's not, it's not true at all!
Why would I wanna be like you, when you're a...

Yuuko:
That's right...
I am... I am dead...
And you mustn't open your heart to the dead.
You mustn't betray your grandmother.

Kirie:
Th-That's right... I...
And that's why I... I can't betray...

Yuuko:
But you really do know, right?

Kirie:
Even so, I...
Please stop!

Niiya!

Teiichi:
What's wrong, Kirie-san?
Why are you running?
Did Yuuko-san do something to you?

Kirie:
So you didn't confuse me with Yuuko?

Teiichi:
Huh?

Kirie:
What is it you like so much about Yuuko?

Teiichi:
Uh...

Kirie:
I'm asking, what is it that's so great about her?

Teiichi:
Oh, well, it's a bit sudden to have to answer that question...

Kirie:
Is it her eyes?

Teiichi:
Uh...

Kirie:
Her long hair?

Teiichi:
Uh...

Kirie:
Her face... Her face, right?

Teiichi:
Well, uh...

Kirie:
Don't you realize that I have all those things, too?

Teiichi:
Huh?

Kirie:
Even still, you prefer Yuuko?
I can't get why you think she's better than me.
I don't care how feminine she is...
Yuuko is... She's still a ghost!

Teiichi:
I, uh, honestly don't know much about this.
But when it comes to love, I don't think if the person is a ghost or not really maters that much.

Kirie:
I see, yeah... I guess it doesn't really matter.

Teiichi:
Uh, but, uh, listen, that doesn't mean I don't like you, or anything like that. I just, um... Well...

Kirie:
Still, you wouldn't say that you're in love with a ghost, right?
[I'm/Imean] [convinced/common/c'mon??].
What is it?

Teiichi:
Uh, y-your chest... It's, uh...

Kirie:
Wh-What the hell?
Why are you blushing?
Seeing this can't be that fascinating, right?

Teiichi:
What do you mean?
You're a girl, too.
I mean there's just a...

Kirie:
I know that...
Idiot!

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san?

Yuuko:
Oh, yeah...
This haunted house shows you what you're frightened of.

Kirie:
Please get out of my way.
This is so annoying...

Yuuko:
That girl just... She...

Kirie:
This is the first time I've ever touched Yuuko.
It was pretty amazing, after all.
What I saw before wasn't really Yuuko...
It was my own fear. It was the me who couldn't learn to love myself...
Huh?
Then if what I saw before was just an illusion of Yuuko, does that mean she's been here the whole time?
So she heard everything...?



Kirie:
What is this supposed to mean, Niiya?!

Teiichi:
Apparently, Yuuko-san brought that here from somewhere or other, I guess.

Yuuko:
Okay!

Teiichi and Kirie:
Uh...

Momoe:
That's what this was all about?

Kirie:
Okonogi?

Momoe:
So, since the Heartless Anatomical Model can't move itself, it urged us to bring it to its heart's location, proving that it always knew where it was!
Therefore, it was never a heartless anatomical model after all!

Kirie:
What?
Can't you start making sense?
That's just creepy!

Momoe:
It's not creepy in the least...
As a girl, you should be more romantic, Kirie-san!
Kirie-san?
What's wrong?
Kirie-san?

Kirie:
You may be right.

Yuuko:
Huh?
Those two look like they're having fun.

Momoe:
You look so cute!

Kirie:
Okay, okay, please stop.

Momoe:
No, you're adorable!

Kirie:
Now, you really stop saying to me.

Momoe:
No, really!



A blade, wet with reproach.
A scream, tainted with fresh blood.
A maiden, tortured by her own rage.
Hatred for that name.
