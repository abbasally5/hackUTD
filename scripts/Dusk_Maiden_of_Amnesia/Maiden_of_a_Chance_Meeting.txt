  Teiichi:
This is a story from back when I still didn't know anything.
About a "me"... that I no longer remember.
Seikyou Academy is a private school.
After countless extensions to, and modifications of the buildings, its middle and high schools have become intertwined.
All in all, these cobbled-together structures hold sixty years' worth of history.
Classrooms that have become storage rooms.
Stairs that no one ever climbs.
Hallways that simply end abruptly.
Buildings as complicated as mazes.
All of these have helped to birth many mysterious rumors.



Teiichi:
Oh, man... Seriously, where am I?
I'm pretty sure that this should be the old building's first floor.
Huh?

Someone:
Have you heard it?
The rumor about the ghost in the old school building?
Apparently, a big mirror is in there somewhere.
No matter what happens, when you're in front of the mirror, don't...

Teiichi:
I just had to remember that, didn't I?
No matter what?
Huh... What was it?
Maybe it's this way...
Oh, man...
Huh?
Is anyone in here?
Yeah, right. Like that would happen.
Is this a storage room?
Huh?
Looks like a mirror. That's kinda creepy.
This couldn't be the mirror in the rumors, could it?

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun.

Teiichi
Huh?
Aah!

Yuuko:
Oh, wow. How rude.
Is my face really that terrifying to you?

Teiichi:
Oh, no, I'm sorry!
Uh, it's not that... I was just surprised. That's all.

Yuuko:
It's rare for people to come here. But I don't mind.
So, tell me something, are you a first year?

Teiichi:
Uh, yeah...

Pale skin. Almond eyes. Tall, slender build...
But that wasn't all.
There was something about her that felt strange.

Yuuko:
So, you managed to wander in here. You must've been really lost.
Have you heard it? The rumor about the ghost in the old school building?

Teiichi:
Huh...

Yuuko:
Is there something wrong?

Teiichi:
Oh, i-it's nothing.
But uh... what were you doing in that old room?

Yuuko:
Huh?

Teiichi:
You said it's unusual for people to go into that place.
When you put it that way, it almost makes it sound like you're always there.

Yuuko:
I am... always...

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
After all, I'm the ghost of the old school building.

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
I'm a ghost--the ghost from the stories.

Teiichi:
Uh...

Yuuko:
One more time, I am a ghost.

Teiichi
S-Stop joking around!
What is this?
Th-This can't be real, right?
I mean, it's not possible, but...
I know, if she's a ghost, I can't touch her.
If she's a ghost... I can touch her?!

Yuuko:
Ah!

Teiichi:
Ah, I'm so sorry!
I just thought if you were a ghost, I couldn't touch you.

Yuuko:
Just because you can touch me doesn't guarantee that I'm not a ghost, silly.
But, isn't that irrelevant, anyway?

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
I really don't remember anything about my death.
I just know I'm here now. I have no memories of my past.

Teiichi:
You don't?

Yuuko:
I don't know when or why I died.
But I don't have any regrets or grudges.
I can't remember, and I don't really wanna find out.
And that's why... what I am doesn't matter.
I hope you understand.
My name is Yuuko. Yuuko Kanoe. And you are?

Teiichi:
Teiichi. Teiichi Niiya.

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun, huh? That's a really cute name.

Teiichi:
Wait. Didn't she already know my name?

Yuuko-san, you really aren't interested in finding out?
About your death, I mean...

Yuuko:
Well, now... so you have accepted the fact that I'm a ghost.

Teiichi:
No, that's not really what I meant.

Yuuko:
Ah... I think I get it now. You're curious about me, aren't you?
Very well. Shall I show you?

Teiichi:
Ah! Wh-What are you doing?

Yuuko:
I just thought I'd show you the uniform from my time. That's all.

Teiichi:
Since you're a ghost, can't you just change your appearance like instantly or something?

Yuuko:
How could I do that?
I'm not magic. I can't do anything that you can't do.

Teiichi:
Really? So, uh, that's how it works.

Yuuko:
Huh?

Teiichi:
Aah! Sorry, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry!

Yuuko:
You're funny. Did I tell you that you couldn't look?

Teiichi:
Isn't it embarrassing though?

Yuuko:
It's not like my body is actually here, you know.
Done! What do you think? Do you like it?
This is the uniform I was wearing before my death.

Teiichi:
I guess it does kind of suit you better.

Yuuko:
Are you saying that I'm an old-fashioned woman?

Teiichi:
That's not what I meant.
And anyway, why are you hanging onto me like that?

Yuuko:
It's just so nice... being able to touch someone like this.
I wonder why that is?

Teiichi:
Whoa, what are you...?

Yuuko:
For the time being, let me do what I want.
Soon enough, I'm sure you won't be able to even see me anymore.

Teiichi:
Huh? What do you mean?

Yuuko:
I'm an illusion you're seeing.
A ghost story just isn't enough. That's not reality.

Teiichi:
I don't really understand, but... is there anything you can do to keep things this way?

Yuuko:
Let's see... maybe... something like this?
(Kissing)

Teiichi:
Ugh, are you teasing me?

Yuuko:
Yup!

Teiichi:
Well, stop it then.

Yuuko:
Oh, come on... you know you liked it!
Well, what do you think? Did that kiss make me unforgettable?

Teiichi:
I feel more like I'm being haunted.

Yuuko:
That's mean!

Teiichi:
But you wouldn't actually do anything like that, would you?

Yuuko:
A long time ago, there was a story that used to be told.
There was a young girl who died on the school grounds.
That death was slow and painful.
And as a result, the area around the school was cursed.
To this day, her whereabouts remain unknown, and she continues to slumber here, somewhere.

Teiichi:
So, do you think that story is about you?

Yuuko:
Sometimes I wonder.

Teiichi:
Huh.
But if the story really is about her, that means she might be locked away somewhere on the campus.

Yuuko:
I'm waiting for you.

Girl:
I'm scared! Please help me!

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun? Is something wrong?

Teiichi:
Just now, was that a dream?
No, that wasn't a dream. There's no way
Maybe that really was her, begging for help...

Yuuko:
Hey, Teiichi-kun.

Teiichi:
Somewhere... somewhere in the old part of the school...
Ah!

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun, wait!

Someone:
Have you heard it?
The rumor about the ghost in the old school building?
Apparently, a big mirror is in there somewhere.

Teiichi:
Ha!
It had to be the big mirror in the old wing.
And behind it, is Yuuko's...

Yuuko:
Wait! Behind that is... No, don't!

Teiichi:
Ow, ow...

Someone:
Apparently, a big mirror is in there somewhere.
No matter what happens, when you're in front of the mirror, don't turn around.
If you do, the building's ghost will drag you in, and you'll be forced to wander within the mirror forever.

Yuuko:
Then... you did see that... even though I told you not to...

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san...

Yuuko:
It's just so... It's just so... It's so... embarrassing!

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
You saw everything...
You saw the innermost places of my body, when I asked you specifically not to do that.

Teiichi:
Wait a second, what's embarrassing here?
I mean, aren't those just bones?

Yuuko:
This is the ultimate state of nakedness!
Cover me up, already! Ooh, stop looking! You're a pervert!

Teiichi:
What?! Pervert?!



Teiichi:
Yuuko-san really was the ghost of a girl who died on campus.
She got trapped in an accident or something, and then...
Well, I guess the ghost stories just evolved from the rumors.

Hold on, what is this?

Yuuko:
I thought I'd start a club like a good student would.

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san?

Yuuko:
I kinda started to think I'd like to know more... about myself, you know.
You'll help me, right?
I mean, you did look at my most private places.

Teiichi:
Oh, come on!

It seems like Yuuko-san did end up haunting me...
Well, I guess in a way...



Teiichi:
"The private school Seikyou Academy was constructed over the remains of a mountain-top shrine.
At first, there was a small mountain village, but after the mining industry developed, it grew in size very quickly.
To accommodate the sudden increase of students, the school underwent..."

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun, what are you reading?

Teiichi:
I thought that if I researched some of the school's history, and then told it to you, then maybe your memory would come back.
We don't have any other leads, so it's worth a shot at least.

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun, you pervert!

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
Can't you stop thinking about my body?
I bet you were considering sneaking in for another look.

Teiichi:
Wh-Why would I...?

Yuuko:
But, that's gonna have to wait! At least until you're an adult.

Teiichi:
Hey, that's dangerous!

Yuuko:
Your eyesight, really kind of stinks.
Aah!

Teiichi:
Watch out!

Yuuko:
I'm sorry... Are you okay?
Would you like to touch them?

Teiichi:
Huh? No-No! No, no, no, no, no.

Yuuko:
Teiichi, if you harbor dirty thoughts, you shouldn't touch a girl.

Teiichi:
Wh-Wh...

Yuuko:
Right?

Momoe:
Please help me!

Teiichi:
Um, nothing unsavory is going on here or nothing...

Momoe:
Oh, I know! You're in the middle of some spirit ritual!
I completely understand... I'll wait!

Teiichi:
Huh? You'll wait? For what?

Yuuko:
Don't worry. She doesn't know I'm here.

Teiichi:
But I can see you.

Yuuko:
Apparently, people can't see me unless they are conscious of me--neither myself nor the actions I take.
The only reason you're able to see me is not hard to figure out.
It's because you're so deeply aware of me.

Teiichi:
Will you stop! Not now! Then that girl needs my help!



Teiichi:
So, what's the matter?
You said, "Please help me!"

Momoe:
I did...
At this rate, I'm definitely gonna be killed by Yuuko-san!

Yuuko and Teiichi:
Huh?

Momoe:
My name is Momoe Okonogi.
To be honest, three days ago, I played hide-and-seek.

Teiichi:
Hide-and-seek?

Momoe:
It's an old ritual, passed down in this school, in which you put a name on a doll.
That name is... Yuuko.

Teiichi:
Huh?

Momoe:
This ritual is enacted after school, when no one else is around.

Let's play hide-and-seek, and I'll be it.
Let's play hide-and-seek, and I'll be it.
One and two and three and four and five and six and seven and eight and nine and ten.
Found you.
Buried Yuuko-san...
Buried in the pillar.
Yuuko, now you're it.

Then you have to hide. It's a game you play alone. No one can find you.
However, they say that something will come looking for you, without fail.
There's only one way to end this.
That's to tell the doll that it's over.
But if you're unable to do that, the game will never come to an end.
And you will end up being pursued by whatever kind of thing you summoned.
Just for fun, my classmates played, but they failed.
So I thought I should make sure to end the game properly...
Ever since then, I feel like I'm always being followed.
And the feeling keeps getting stronger and stronger.
I'm sure Yuuko-san is going to kill me!

Teiichi:
Um, I don't think that's...

Momoe:
I stabbed her, after all...
How can this be resolved?

Teiichi:
Well, um, I'm not sure actually...

Momoe:
But this is the Paranormal Investigation Club, right?

Teiichi:
I guess so...

Momoe:
Then, please investigate!
Please won't you help me?!

Teiichi:
Um, is that really what this club's supposed to be about?

Yuuko:
Who knows?

Momoe:
Huh?

Teiichi:
Who knows? What do you mean?
Don't pretend like you aren't involved!
But, don't you think we should...
Hold on! You don't mean me!

Momoe:
Ah, who are you talking to?
Could it be a ghost that you summoned earlier with that ritual I saw you doing?
That is super cool.

Teiichi:
Uh, no no no! I was just talking to myself!

Yuuko:
Oh, very well... Look over here.

Teiichi:
Oh, yeah, a good idea!
Hold on, I'll give our club president a call.
She's rarely here, like a ghost president.
This is Teiichi. Are you there, President?

Yuuko:
Yes! Ghost president speaking.
This is a perfect opportunity.
It may turn into a clue for deciphering my past.

Teiichi:
Are you really sure we should just accept this?

Yuuko:
I see now. So you don't care anything about my past?

Teiichi:
Come on, this has nothing to do with that...

Yuuko:
Okay, okay... I guess I have no choice.
I guess I'll do something about it.

Teiichi:
You think that talisman is actually gonna work?

Yuuko:
Of course, I made it myself.

Teiichi:
Made it yourself... So it's fake!
I thought you were going to do something!

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun.
There is no way that a doll could disappear on its own.
There must be a reason for it!

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san...

Yuuko:
Huh?

Teiichi:
What's that over there?
Isn't that the doll Okonogi-san was using for her ritual?
What the heck is it doing here?!

Yuuko:
I found it when I was taking a walk.
It said "Yuuko," so obviously, I couldn't leave it there.

Teiichi:
That means the only reason the ritual failed is because you messed with it?

Yuuko:
I guess you could put it that way.

Teiichi:
How am I gonna explain this to her?

Yuuko:
The thing about hide-and-seek is that it's simple auto-suggestion for the person playing.

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
A creepy ritual, in a gloomy classroom.
If you hide in a confined space when you're nervous, you'll be anxious, and you might even see things.

Teiichi:
You're saying, it's all imaginary... meaning there's no real danger then.

Yuuko:
Strong suggestions can be dangerous.
That girl has already seen things that don't exist.
If she can see them, getting caught and killed by them is not entirely impossible.

Teiichi:
Oh, no...
If we can actually defeat those things, then we could fix this problem.
But if they're imaginary, there's nothing we can do.

Yuuko:
All right, let's go.

Teiichi:
Go where?

Yuuko:
Ghostbusting, silly.



Momoe:
As long as I have this talisman... I'll be fine... I'll be fine!
Huh?
This is the back of a handout?
What? No!

Teiichi:
Okonogi-san!
Run!

Momoe:
Huh? Right!

Teiichi:
And you're absolutely sure that's the thing that was chasing you?

Momoe:
Yes!

Yuuko:
Wait! Wait!

Teiichi:
Look!
There's your doll, the one that disappeared.

Yuuko:
Although that was kind of my fault!

Teiichi:
Hide-and-seek is a ritual that summons spirits like evil ghosts.

Yuuko:
I'm not an evil ghost!

Teiichi:
The doll... was possessed by one of those spirits!

Yuuko:
Totally rude...

Momoe:
Oh, no...

Teiichi:
This way!
We must escape this evil presence!
Fortunately, I have a real talisman!

Momoe:
Niiya-san!

Yuuko:
Any crying children here?

Teiichi:
There you are, evil spirit! Leave, foul ghost!

This is the doll, right?

Momoe:
Yes. I'm so sorry...

Teiichi:
The evil ghost is gone, so you'll be fine now.
I'll clean up here, you go home and rest.

Momoe:
Okay, thank you so much!

Yuuko:
My acting was spot-on, wasn't it?

Teiichi:
I guess...

Yuuko:
People who fear things that aren't there will see me the way they expect.
Because she was convinced that I was this terrible hideous thing, she saw me as a monster.
It's really pretty simple.

Teiichi:
They used to say something like a ghost examined closely is nothing but withered silver grass.

Yuuko:
So, when all is said and done, I'm nothing but an illusion, right?

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
Oh, it's nothing. It's not important.

Teiichi:
Oh! It's really sorry about before!

Yuuko:
Don't worry about it. It isn't as though you did it deliberately.

Teiichi:
Yeah, but, I-I mean...



Yuuko:
I guess we never did find any connection between hide-and-seek and me, did we?

Teiichi:
I thought there might be some connection to you though, since they use the name Yuuko for it and everything.

Momoe:
Excuse me... Is anyone there?

Teiichi:
Okonogi-san.

Momoe:
Thank you so much for yesterday.
Since then, nothing has happened.

Teiichi:
Oh, that's good.

Momoe:
It's all because you exorcised the evil ghost!
Y-You were v-very cool! I mean, really awesome!

Teiichi:
A-ah, I couldn't have done it without our ghost president's help.
Although she really is a ghost president...

Momoe:
Huh?

Teiichi:
Hold on! Yuuko-san...

Yuuko:
I get it. I'm just a ghost president, after all!

Ghost Story Three: "Maiden of Dusk"
