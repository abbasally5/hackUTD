  Kirie:
My name is Kirie Kanoe.
I perform an absolutely essential task here at this cursed school.
After a certain day, all the ghosts that wandered these school halls lost their memories.

Girl 1:
They saw it again.
Scatter Ashes-san appeared by the fountain this time.

Girl 2:
How scary.
After school, we should avoid going anywhere near that place.

Kirie:
Well, looks like we've got trouble again.

Yuuko:
Eat up, fishies!

Kirie:
Yuuko, what are you doing?

Yuuko:
Huh? What does it look like?
Feeding the fish.

Kirie:
Stop it! You're a ghost.
Think about it.
Do you have any idea what effect your actions have on those around you?

Yuuko:
Not really. Not a clue.

Kirie:
People are going to think it's a corpse that stands in front of a fountain, scattering her own ashes?
Ha, come on, don't you get it?

Yuuko:
But the goldfish...

Kirie:
They're not yours to raise!
There are new ghost stories all the time because you always do these unnecessary things!

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san! I brought some bread crusts.
Oh, hi! Is something wrong, Kirie-san?

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun, Kirie-san is bullying me again.

Kirie:
I challenge you, Yuuko!
And should you lose, you'll show a little restraint in your activities.
You got that?
You help, Niiya!

Teiichi:
Huh? But why me?

And now for the first competition: a foot race.

Kirie:
I'm confident in my speed.

Teiichi:
Because you're used to running away?

Kirie:
Shut it.

Teiichi:
Ready...

Yuuko:
Goal!

Teiichi:
The next match is... a test of knowledge.

Kirie:
This'll be a piece of cake.
Yuuko screws around twenty-four, seven.
There's no way I'm losing this one.

Teiichi:
And go!

I will now announce the results of the test.
Yuuko Kanoe: ninety points.
Kirie Kanoe: thirty points.

Kirie:
Gah...

Yuuko:
All the time I've been stuck in this school wasn't for nothing.

Teiichi:
These problems were seventh-grade level...
Are you all right, Kirie-san?

Yuuko:
Awkward...

Kirie:
It's not over! I have not lost yet!

Teiichi:
A beauty contest...

A courage contest...

Home Economics contest...

Kirie:
How did I...? I don't understand...

Teiichi:
Why don't we call it quits?

Kirie:
Niiya...

Teiichi:
We've tried every thinking, and you just can't win against her.
There's no shame in second place.

Kirie:
You! Seriously, would you just shut up?!
Yuuko!

Yuuko:
Hm?

Kirie:
I didn't wanna use this, but it's for peace at this school.
You leave me no choice.
Now, witness the power of a descendant of the shrine!

Rin! Pyou! Tou! Sha! Kai! Jin! Retsu! Zai! Zen!
Frugativi et appelavi!
Now, vanquish the daemon!
Evil spirit, begone!

Just die, already!

Yuuko:
What was that about?
She's crazy.

Teiichi:
Beats me...

Kirie:
What? They aren't following me?



Momoe:
Now then, I'd like to begin the True Paranormal Investigation Club's training camp.
And by that I mean...

Teiichi:
Well, I'm not quite sure...

Kirie:
I honestly don't care anymore.

Yuuko:
It means we just forget about what's happened in the past, and we start again fresh.

Teiichi:
Well, I suppose the core purpose of the club hasn't changed at least.

Momoe:
You are totally right!
And so I've come up with a theme for our training camp.
And here it is...

Teiichi:
What's this?

Momoe:
A mysterious text about legends hidden away for years at our school!
xxx this is just gonna be so fun!

Yuuko:
If you already know that much, how is it mysterious?

Kirie:
And anything that's been hidden for years can't really be a legend.

Teiichi:
It looks like ghost stories of some sort are written here.

Momoe:
This is from the other day, when I was doing research in the library.
Between the pages of an old book I was using, I found this sheet of paper.
It's full of ghost stories that I've never heard until now.

Yuuko:
She's right.
I've never heard any of these before.

Momoe:
It's our duty to check it out, as the True Paranormal Investigation Club!

Teiichi:
So you said you haven't heard any of these before?
They must be pretty old that someone wrote them down before you came here.

Yuuko:
But I started here. I was already here right when the old school first opened.

Kirie:
I would have expected all the school's ghost stories to have originated with you.

Yuuko:
I don't think they necessarily have to.

Momoe:
This is it.
The first mystery is the mystery of Youko-san!

Teiichi:
Youko-san?

Kirie:
Did they just misspelled Yuuko?

Momoe:
They say that if a girl and a boy perform a certain ritual after school in an empty classroom, Youko-san's ghost will appear.
If they're meant to become a couple, she leaves a note saying, "I wish you happiness," and disappears.
But if not, she takes the boy with her to the underworld.
And he disappears forever.
So, uh, Niiya-san...
Would you like to try the ritual with me, um, just to see if it's true?

Teiichi:
Mmhmm, sure, let's do it.
Sounds like fun.

Kirie:
Uh...

Teiichi:
What's wrong, Kirie-san?
Too scary?

Kirie:
Niiya, you're pretty dense.

Yuuko:
Grrr...

Momoe:
Let's begin.
Youko-san! Youko-san!
Please answer our... uh, an answer already!
"I wish you..." huh?
"happi... wish wish were worse!"

Teiichi:
Ah.

Momoe:
If we weren't meant to be a couple, Youko-san will take you away from me.
But if I stop it, then nothing has to happen, does it?

Teiichi:
Y-You think it'll be that easy?

Momoe:
I'm sure, I will!

Yuuko:
I don't want you to have any false hopes, just cut in here.

Teiichi:
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

Kirie:
Help me, Kirie-san!
You're gonna help me!

Kirie
So you're telling me that I have to fight over you, too?

Teiichi:
Kirie-san!

Kirie:
Guess I have no choice.
I'll teach you a secret strategy.

Teiichi:
A secret strategy?

Kirie:
This happened long ago, at the court of Ohka Echizen No Kami Tadasuke.
When two woman, both claiming to be a child's mother, tugged the child toward themselves, he ruled as follows:
"The one who releases this child for the child's sake, is the mother."

Teiichi:
Okay then, all I have to is being in a lot pain, right?

Kirie:
Right.
If they both truly love you, they'll release your hands.

Teiichi:
Okay.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

Yuuko:
A boy shouldn't whine so much!

Momoe:
It'll be over soon!

Teiichi:
It hurts... It hurts... It hurts! It really hurts!

Momoe:
Oh, wow!
Niiya-san is... he's so uber cute when he's totally in pain like that!

Yuuko:
Wow. That's just so adorable...
It make me wanna hurt that boy even more.

Teiichi:
It hurts! It hurts... You'll rip off my arms!

Momoe:
That was close.
It was like something in me was on the verge of awakening...

Yuuko:
Something in me already woke up.

Teiichi:
Your trick didn't work very well, Kirie-san...

Kirie:
I'm sorry for you...

Momoe:
The second mystery... is a man-eating child monster.

Kirie:
Monster?

Teiichi:
That one sounds pretty straightforward...

Momoe:
They say it appears after school to swallow students head-first in a single gulp.
Oh, it says here how to vanquish it.

Kirie:
Oh?
This is right in my area of expertise.

Teiichi:
Your expertise?

Kirie:
You guys don't stand a chance against any dangerous monsters.
I'm the one with qualifications in exorcism.
Seems I'm up.

Teiichi:
Exorcism?

Yuuko:
Qualifications?

Kirie:
Stand back and learn something.
Leave this to me.

Teiichi:
You're using a Christian crucifix, but you've got Buddhist talismans.
Is this really gonna work?

Momoe:
I bet that'll catch the monster off-guard, so it'll be even more effective.
Go, Kirie-san! Yeah!

Kirie:
Right!
I summon the twenty-one descendants!
Seven in my right hand, as a sword.
Seven in my left hand, as a shield.
Seven to the deflect evil magic, as my armor!
Elohim Essaim!

Yuuko:
G-Grrr?

Kirie:
Don't pity me!

Momoe:
Huh?

Kirie:
They still aren't following me?



Teiichi:
We haven't seen a single mystery here, have we?

Kirie:
Can we really believe that piece of paper she's carrying?

Momoe:
The next mystery involves a bath that three mustn't enter at once.
It says it's forbidden for three or more to simultaneously enter the bath at this school.
If three or more enter... something terrible will happen to them.

Kirie:
Is she serious?

Teiichi:
That's weird.
I didn't know this school had a bathing area in the first place.

Yuuko:
I does!

Kirie:
Oh, I see it's where you warm up again after swimming?

Momoe:
I guess it's basically a bath.

Yuuko:
It is a bath.
It's not that shocking.
I get in all the time.

Teiichi:
You get in here?

Yuuko:
Mmhmm. Every chance I get.
I am a girl, you know.

Teiichi:
Then you must know about all the problems we have when someone added bubble bath, and there were bubbles everywhere for days.

Yuuko:
Yeah, I'm coming in...
The health teacher bought it, and I borrowed a little.

Kirie:
Should've known it was you.

Momoe:
But, uh, three or more are in here right now, and we all seem to be just fine.

Kirie:
The swim team uses it all the time, too.

Teiichi:
Huh. When did they build this, anyway?

Kirie:
I heard they built it after they completed the new buildings.

Momoe:
That means it was made after the stories recorded on the paper I found.

Teiichi:
In that case, they must have meant the old bathing area from before the new school was constructed.

Yuuko:
Hmm... So maybe they're talking about...

Ta-dah!

Teiichi:
They had a bath in here, and they kept it around?

Kirie:
Back then, a part of the school was leased as an office for the mines.
The workers used this area then.
So that explains this bathtub.

Momoe:
It's like an old tiny wooden bucket.
It's tiny and cute and retro sort of way.

Kirie:
It has a metal pipe for wire intalled.
And while it might be really tight, it does look like more than three could fit in here.

Momoe:
Well, let's try it, Niiya-san!

Teiichi:
Sure, we've got nothing to lose.

Momoe:
And you know what that means...
All of us have to get...

This hot water feels great!

Kirie:
It's not so bad to do this every once in a while.

Momoe:
The faint scent of wood is really nice, don't you think so?
Niiya-san! The water feels great!
You need to get in the tub, too!

Teiichi:
I-I think I'm fine over here. Thank you very much.

Momoe:
Come on and hurry up!
We don't have all day, the water's gonna get cold.

Teiichi:
D-Do I really have to get in there?

Momoe:
Of course you have to!
We need three people here to test the mystery and take off your bathing suit!
No clothes... naked! Stark naked!

Kirie:
What's wrong, Niiya?
Why are you so bashful all of a sudden?

Momoe:
It's okay!
We kept this area of the tub separate for a male bath.

Teiichi:
The problem is getting over there...

Kirie:
It's fine...
It won't get smaller if we see it.

Teiichi:
Wrap it up, you're just saying that 'cause your stuff can't get any smaller...

Kirie:
What are you talking about?!
What can't get smaller?

Momoe:
Kirie-san and I are naked too.
All of us are in this together.

Teiichi:
It's two against one, though.

Momoe:
Boys should be brave and fearless.
Now, get in!

Yuuko:
Or maybe... you want me to help hide you from them?

Teiichi:
How long have you been there?

Yuuko:
I've been here for a while.
Don't worry, I've got this one locked down.
Go...

Kirie:
What the hell?
That's no fun.

Teiichi:
I-I'm in.

Kirie:
It's about time.
But you know what, Niiya...?

Teiichi:
Yes.

Kirie:
Okonogi is unable to see her, so your trick didn't really work.

Teiichi:
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

Yuuko:
Oh, that's right.
She isn't able to see me, so she might have seen everything.
Well, after all, you were naked.

Teiichi:
Wait. What? What? What? What?!

Momoe:
That was yummy.

Teiichi:
What are you going to do about this?

Yuuko:
Whoops... Sorry.
It just slipped my mind.

Momoe:
Well, now we have three people in the bath.
So something mysterious should happen.

Kirie:
Doesn't really feel like anything's going to, though.
Without any clothes, you look positively huge, Okonogi.

Momoe:
What are you talking about?
You're skinny and ripped, I'm sure some people like that.

Kirie:
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

Momoe:
Oh my gosh!
The water level went up, you guys!
Why is that?
Could it be a mystery about to occur?

Teiichi:
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What are you doing?
The girl side is over there.

Yuuko:
I'm not getting in over there. I wanted to get in with you.

Teiichi:
B-B-B-B-but...

Yuuko:
This is the first time we've ever gotten to share a bath together.

Momoe:
What is that?
Niiya-san is acting pretty strange.

Kirie:
He's always acting strange.

Yuuko:
Your skin is so pretty.

Teiichi:
I-It's normal, really.

Yuuko:
It's nice... so smooth.

Teiichi:
But, you cut it out!

Yuuko:
Can't I? Just a little?

Teiichi:
C'mon! Don't get so close to me..

Yuuko:
Oh, really? Why wouldn't you want me with you?

Teiichi:
But... but... listen, Kirie-san is right over there.

Yuuko:
So? I don't care.
Oh, what's this?
It's so cute.
Am I making you nervous?

Teiichi:
S-Stop, Yuuko-san...
You're being to rough!

Yuuko:
How funny...
It's so...

Teiichi:
Please stop!
You'll break me in!

Kirie:
You two, knock it off!

Everyone:
(Shriek)



Kirie:
I assume that what they meant by "something terrible" is that the tub will break if more than three get in there.

Yuuko:
I guess it is old, and we were packed in there pretty tight.

Teiichi:
But it wasn't really supernatural, was it?
Just super violent.

Momoe:
Our important document got all wet from the water.

Kirie:
Just forget it... That paper is a total fake.

Momoe:
Hey, what's this?
Invisible ink?

Teiichi:
"Paranormal investigation club"?

Kirie:
Paranormal investigation club?

Yuuko:
I know about that.
They used to have a club like that at school really long time ago.

Momoe:
Oh, now I remember!
This is the predecessor to the third newspaper club I'm in.
They put out a bulletin that featured mysteries and ghost stories.

Teiichi:
Oh, really?

Momoe:
Yeah...
When the occultism boom started to fade way back then, the club president got interested in journalism, and changed the club's direction.
That's how today's third newspaper club began.
This is an old club activity log left behind before they changed their focus.
According to it, they were trying to create ghost stories and mysteries for when they needed bulletin material.

Kirie:
So it's straight-out fakery then.

Teiichi:
Oh, I get it.
So that means the paper had rejected these paticular stories, huh?

Yuuko:
No wonder I didn't know about them.

Momoe:
The ghost story about Youko-san seems to have been cooked up by two members in love.
How romantic.
They created it to have a pretend ritual date alone after school.

Kirie:
We were running all over for something as completely ridiculous as that.

Teiichi:
Then I guess our efforts were in vain, weren't they.

Yuuko:
Oh, you think so?

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
I had a lot of fun... just being with all of you.

Teiichi:
Yeah, so did I.



Momoe:
Ta-dah!
What do you think, Niiya-san?

Teiichi:
The yukata is really cute on you, Okonogi-san.

Momoe:
You really think so?
Thank you so much, Niiya-san!

Kirie:
Ahem.

Teiichi:
Uh...
Wow, that's really beautiful.

Kirie:
You think I do?

Teiichi:
You look great in it, Yuuko-san.

Kirie:
Huh?

Yuuko:
Thanks very much. That means a lot to me.

Momoe:
Oh, Kirie-san, you look fantastic!

Kirie:
Y-You think?

Momoe:
Oh, yes!
I always say you need a Japanese body to look good in a yukata!

Kirie:
I know I'm not curvy, so sue me!



Kirie:
Is that... your idea fun?

Momoe:
It is. Very fun.

Kirie:
Really?

Momoe:
Yeah!
These are actually really fun.
I like how they shine a lot.
Hey, try this!

Yuuko:
So pretty...

Teiichi:
It is, isn't it?

Yuuko:
Mine!

Momoe:
Yay!

Kirie:
Hey, that's dangerous!

Momoe:
What are you talking about?!
You're supposed to throw them!

Kirie:
Not like that!

Teiichi:
Never a dull moment with those two, is it?

Yuuko:
I think it suits the Paranormal Investigation Club.

Teiichi:
It's funny, isn't it?
I never expected that people in the past were doing the same things that we're doing now.

Yuuko:
You know, I think it's actually something that's always happened.

Teiichi:
Do you mean people telling ghost stories?

Yuuko:
Not that, I mean, people loving someone else.

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san...

Yuuko:
I love you.
And you love me back.
It's just one person, but it's enough for me to be happy.
And then all of a sudden done, isn't that all that really matter?

Teiichi:
It isn't just one person.

Yuuko:
Huh?

Teiichi:
People might think of ghosts as something scary or something they don't understand, but there are something about them, something that draws people xxx then again and again.
I believe that your story was passed on over and over for decades, because something about it is attractive.

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun...

Teiichi:
For example, look at us now, that's why we're all gathered here.

Yuuko:
Yes, it is.
You might be right.
