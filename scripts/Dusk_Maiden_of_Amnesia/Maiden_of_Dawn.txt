  Kirie:
Whoa, Okonogi, you're better endowed than I thought.

Momoe:
Huh? No, not really.

Kirie:
Y-Yeah...
Seeing you like that is making me...

Momoe:
Kanoe-san, I think being slender like you is way better...

Kirie:
You... You really think so?

Momoe:
Could I... touch your legs?

Kirie:
Uh...

Momoe:
I'll let you touch my breasts if you want to.
I'll even throw my butt in, as well!

Kirie:
Maybe I should drink some milk or something...

Momoe:
Could I touch your legs?



Kirie:
The Paranormal Investigation Club's summer training camp starts now!

Momoe:
Yeah!

Teiichi:
But, Kirie-san, why are we suddenly holding a camp?

Kirie:
Huh? Well, I mean it's pretty obvious that at least a couple of paranormal phenomena will occur at school, at night, over the summer.
Any halfway decent paranormal club would stay and investigate!

Teiichi:
But that means we're also spending the night at school, right?

Kirie:
What? Are you scared, Niiya?

Teiichi:
Uh, no. Actually I think I'll be fine.
I was more worried about you, Kirie-san.

Kirie:
Wh-What do you mean?

Teiichi:
Well, I did find you crying alone, so I thought you might frighten easily.

Kirie:
I told you that was because I fell in the dark, and I couldn't figure out how to get back up again!

Momoe:
Wow! A sleepover party with Niiya-san sounds like so much fun!
And, how exactly is this training camp supposed to help us the Paranormal Investigation Club?!

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san...

Momoe:
I suspected it would be Yuuko-san!
She is the subject of this schoool's most famous ghost stories! Right, Niiya-san?

Teiichi:
Eh? U-Uh, right, of course.

Momoe:
As always, your judgment is spot-on!
So where do we start? We have a lot of time!
So this will be so much fun.

Kirie:
Here's the old night duty room. We'll stay here tonight.

Momoe:
Wow, it has tatami!

Teiichi:
I can't believe you actually got permission for an unofficial club to do this.
Well, I just have to ask my grandma, that usually produces results.

Teiichi:
Your grandma?

Momoe:
I'll make some tea.
I mean, you can't work a night shift without tea and bread, am I right?

Teiichi:
Wait. What?

Momoe:
B-Blood's coming from the faucet!
Niiya-san, do something! We already have paranormal activity...

Teiichi:
The pipe's just rusty because it hasn't been used in a long time, that's all.
Let it run, and the water will turn clear.

Momoe:
That was scary...
But it's too bad there wasn't a real ghost.

Teiichi:
I wonder what's up with Yuuko-san.
She's usually all... like that.

Momoe:
Look, it's a night duty log.
This thing's ancient. I wonder how old it is.

"It came again tonight. Bang bang. Bang bang.
The door keeps being pounded upon.
It came yesterday, and the day before, as well.
When I open the door to see who's there, no one ever is.
But if I ignore it, the pounding at the door gets stronger and stronger.
It's terrifying.
There really is something at this school that isn't of this world."

Kirie:
A ghost story about the night duty room?

Momoe:
Tonight will be really fun.

Kirie:
All right... after sunset, we'll start the investigation in earnest.
No leaf will go unturned tonight!

Teiichi:
Ah...
Well, uh-huh... Yuuko-san?



Teiichi:
So why are we at the pool again?

Momoe:
We have it to ourselves, to ourselves!
Thanks, Kanoe-san.

Teiichi:
Th-That wasn't my point.

Kirie:
The real inquiry starts at nightfall, so during the day, we should keep up our spirits.

Momoe:
I-I put on my new bathing suit...
What do you think, Niiya-san? Do you like it?

Teiichi:
Huh?

Momoe:
It really looks that bad on me?

Teiichi:
Ugh... uh...

Momoe:
Ah! It's so bad, it's painful?

Teiichi:
What? No no no, ow ow ow...

Momoe:
Y-You're right... I should take it off. This is too flashy!

Teiichi:
No, you got the wrong idea. It's fine! You look good in it! Seriously!

Momoe:
No, no. Saying that out of pity is even crueler.
I'm sorry... I'll change right away!

Teiichi:
Wait, Okonogi-san!
Why did you do that, Yuuko-san? She totally got the wrong idea.
Uh, Yuuko-san?



Kirie:
Ready, Niiya?

Teiichi:
Any time!

Momoe:
Over to you, Niiya-san!

Kirie:
Got it. Take that!

Momoe:
All yours, Niiya-san!

Kirie:
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

Teiichi:
Huh? Ugh!



Kirie:
Well, let's go, Niiya!

Teiichi:
You really wanna go out there?

Momoe:
I'll hold down the fort here.
The Night Duty Room Ghost might appear.
And in horror movies, it's always the person alone who first encounters the ghosts!
Hahaha, you guys!

Teiichi:
They are also usually the first to die, you know.

Momoe:
Ah!

Kirie:
The atmosphere is starting to feel right.
This is what's needed.

Teiichi:
It's kind of weird, though.
I never figured you for the type who'd like these after-school overnight camp-things.

Kirie:
I told you we're looking for ghosts.

Teiichi:
Huh? But we already know a ghost, don't we?
Yuuko-san.

Kirie:
Not Yuuko...
I'm pretty sure this school has other ghosts.
The first time I saw her, Yuuko looked like she does now.
Back then, I didn't think she was an evil spirit, either.
However, then I saw it. A shadow...

Teiichi:
A shadow?

Kirie:
It was in the school, after sunset.
A shadow twisted by rage and hatred.
When I saw that, I thought I was seeing Yuuko's true form.
That was when the Yuuko I'd seen started to have that horrible form.
But that was just because I'd decided it.
She wasn't actually that evil spirit.
In that case, what was the awful thing I'd seen that day at school?
There is definitely some kind of evil spirit on these grounds.
I wanna know the truth, too.
Until now, I've been alone, and all I could do was run away...
But I'm not alone anymore.
So please, Niiya, I need you to help... ah!
Niiya? Niiya! Niiya, where are you?!



Teiichi:
Yuuko-san?

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun... idiot.

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
Why did you leave me alone for so long?!

Teiichi:
Oh, but well... I was on summer break...

Yuuko:
And now that you're finally back, all you do is play with the others...
You didn't even mention my bathing suit! You don't care about me at all!
Idiot...

Teiichi:
I'm sorry...

Yuuko:
Don't you get it? You're the only one I have.

Teiichi:
I know, I'm sorry.
Oh, but I wouldn't say that. There's Kirie-san, too.
I mean, she can also see you just like me.

Yuuko:
I don't like that girl. She's just mean.
She sees me, but she won't touch me.

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san...

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun... Please touch me.
I haven't been touched in so long.
But it's... it's always me who seems to be touching you.

Teiichi:
Y-Yuuko-san...

Yuuko:
After all, you were the first one who touched me.

Teiichi:
I-Is that right?

Yuuko:
Touch me anywhere... anywhere you want.
You can even touch me where you did the first time.

Teiichi:
Then, uh, I'll touch your hand.

Yuuko:
My hand? I guess you don't remember then...

Teiichi:
Wh-What do you mean?

Yuuko:
Nope, you missed your chance.

Teiichi:
Huh? Chance for what?

Yuuko:
The hand is fine. Please take my hand.

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun!

Teiichi:
Y-Yes?!

Yuuko:
Shall we go?



Yuuko:
She really is crying...
Um, I'm sorry that we left you by yourself.
Let's go back together.

Kirie:
I was just a little surprised because he disappeared so suddenly!
Let's go!

Teiichi:
K-Kirie-san!

Really, I'm sorry.

Kirie:
I'm fine!



Kirie:
It's locked.

Teiichi:
Do you think Okonogi-san fell asleep?

Kirie:
Why don't you knock and wake her?

Kirie:
Wh-What was that?

Teiichi:
Do you think it's the Night Duty Room's Ghost?

Yuuko:
What's that?

Teiichi:
It was written down in the log, how an other-worldly being would come at night.

Kirie:
Niiya, let's try the window.

Teiichi:
Right.

Okonogi-san!
What...?

Momoe:
Niiya-san!
The Night Duty Room Ghost was here...
He was banging against the door!
I was about to be its first victim because I was all alone and you guys weren't here!

Teiichi and Kirie:
Huh?

Yuuko:
The ghost at the night duty room...
Oh, I see...

Teiichi:
Huh? Yuuko-san?



Momoe:
Cards... Let's play cards, you guys!
They say liveliness keep ghosts at bay!

Yuuko:
Oh, really?

Kirie:
Fine. Let's play Old Maid.

Momoe:
Well, what?
Why are you dealing to four people?

Kirie:
Why wouldn't I? We have four players?

Kirie:
Myself, Niiya, Okonogi...

Yuuko:
Hehehe...

Kirie:
Ugh...

Momoe:
Ah! Something else is here with us!
Oh my god, my god, my god, my god, my god!



Teiichi:
You aren't going to sleep?

Yuuko:
Ghosts don't sleep.

Teiichi:
Is that the night duty log you're looking at?

Yuuko:
The night duty guard used to let me in here, a long time ago.

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
It gets cold in the winter, and there was a nice warm stove here.

Teiichi:
Then, there was someone else who could see you?

Yuuko:
No...
But if you knock, they'll think someone has come to see them, and open the door.

Thanks for letting me in.

Then I'd slip through the open door.
But after I did this a couple of times, no one would open up anymore.
It makes sense... No open was ever there when they opened up.
After a while, the knocking began to frighten people.
So you see, what's written here is true.
I'd completely forgotten about it until now...
I guess that old tale made you sleepy, didn't it?
Good night, Teiichi-kun.
Mysteries are always boring, once you've solved them.
My memories will be boring too, when we find them.
I don't wanna risk it, if something like that might threaten what we have now...
Ah! The Stone of Curses...

Teiichi:
Ah, Yuu... Yuu...

Yuuko:
Quiet.

Teiichi:
But I thought you said ghosts weren't able to sleep.

Yuuko:
I don't sleep. But I like sleeping with you.
Let's go outside.

Teiichi:
Huh? At this hour?

Yuuko:
After sun down, it can get really cold outside.
Because this school is on a mountain, even summer can get chilly.
Sorry for the wait.

Kirie:
Why are those two sneaking out?
What are..? What...?
I guess a normal guy couldn't ignore her...
What does she have that I don't?
Her breasts...
I should stop. It's not like thinking about it will change anything.



Yuuko:
Maybe I should grow my hair out...

Teiichi:
So, where are we going, anyway?

Yuuko:
Have you heard about the Stone of Curses?

Teiichi:
The Stone of Curses?

Yuuko:
If you write the name of a person you hate on this stone, they will be cursed and die.
But if you find your own name inscribed on the stone, you will be cursed and die.
They claim that such a stone is at this school.
Look, here.

Teiichi:
In the courtyard of the old school wing?

Yuuko:
They say a teacher here discovered the stone.
But that teacher was targeted by the stone's curse.

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
It says he quit his job here to escape the curse.
That's what this log entry says anyway.

Teiichi:
The tale of the Stone of Curses...

Yuuko:
Wanna check it out?

Teiichi:
Do we have to right now? Can't we do it tomorrow?

Yuuko:
Nope! I wanna find out now!
Come on, let's go.

This way.

Teiichi:
Oh, a dead end?

Yuuko:
You used to be able to get there this way, but then they added the new part.
From there, you can get to the next building.
It's beautiful.

Teiichi:
Yeah...

Yuuko:
Come on! This way.

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san, watch out!
Hey, wait, Yuuko-san!

Yuuko:
I'm just teasing!

Teiichi:
The roof of the next building, huh?

Yuuko:
Over here.

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san, hey, hold on!

Yuuko:
Now, this way.

Teiichi:
How do we get out of here?

Yuuko:
Looks like this is a dead end.

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
I just wanted to come here!

Teiichi:
So we have to use the window again?

Yuuko:
You can only get in there through the window.
This is the old wing's courtyard.

Teiichi:
This is it, huh?
This place is weird.
All surrounded by hallways?
According to the log, the Stone of Curses should be somewhere around...

Yuuko:
Hey! Isn't that the stone over there?

Teiichi:
Something is written on it...
Are these all... people's names?!

Yuuko:
If you scratch someone's name into the stone, you can curse them.
And if you find your own name written there, you become cursed and die.

Teiichi:
So this is the Stone of Curses...
Ah!

Yuuko:
What's the matter?

Teiichi:
There... It has my name on it.
Does that mean I'm cursed?
Who would do this?
What will I do now?
Well, does that mean the curse is gonna kill me?

Yuuko:
He he he...

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san! You woke me up just for this joke?!

Yuuko:
Yup! How do you feel? Like you'll die?

Teiichi:
I don't even know!



Yuuko:
Curses aren't actually real.
Well, I guess feeling bad could in and of itself, be considered a curse.
You should swim, too.

Teiichi:
B-But I didn't bring my bathing suit...

Yuuko:
I bet the story from the log about the Teacher's Curse was only that... projection.
Maybe he had some reason to think someone would curse him.

Teiichi:
And he quit his job over such an intangible thing...

Yuuko:
People are funny.
They don't see that they have the choice to believe in things or not.
Even if the belief is merely subconscious, believing in something can make it happen.
I'm sorry.
The Stone of Curses has existed, but it was an excuse.
This is nice.
Did you enjoy our walk tonight? I did.
I wanted to show you another face of this school.
I knew you would enjoy seeing it.
Each time the sun rises, it's such a wonderful moment that it makes me believe it might never rise again.
Strange, huh?
Maybe I'm just weird but... I never considered this before.
The nights always passed so fast.

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san...

Yuuko:
Once again, it's thanks to you, because you're the one who noticed me after all.
Thank you, Teiichi-kun.



The beautiful woman who appears in the full-length mirror.
The emotions that are avoided.
The me who loves you.
Ghost Story Five: "Maiden of Longing"
