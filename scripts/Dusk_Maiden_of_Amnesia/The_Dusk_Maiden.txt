  Momoe:
This is bad. This is so bad!

Kirie:
Nice getup, Okonogi.

Momoe:
That isn't important right now!
This is very bad!
When I went to our club room this morning, it was completely blocked off!
Apparently, the chairwoman found the remains of an unknown girl in the basement beneath that very room!

Kirie:
Oh, yeah, Grandma... I mean, the rumor is that the girl was related to the chairwoman or something like that.

Momoe:
And about that... according to an eyewitness, there was evidence of some sort of ritual.
They're saying she might have been the human sacrifice used to build the old school building...

Yuuko:
Actually, a human sacrifice after the buildings were completed.

Momoe:
But you know, what's weird is that the club room was completely trashed.
It looked like a poltergeist had gone on a rampage...
Everything was torn up and thrown around all over the room.

Yuuko:
It was Teiichi-kun, who did that one.

Momoe:
Maybe the sleeping ghost of the girl who was sacrificed woke up and stormed about!
What are we going to do, Niiya-san?

Teiichi:
You don't have to worry, Okonogi-san.

Momoe:
How can you be so sure?

Teiichi:
Uh, well...

Momoe:
Could it be that you know the identity of the remains in the basement?
Like, what if she's actually Yuuko-san, the ghost you're always talking to?
I bet it's probably her!

Yuuko:
Correct!

Momoe:
Oh my god, that's it!
I'm right, aren't I?

Teiichi:
After all, you're totally in love with the Yuuko-san from the stories!
But you know... it's fine that you're summoning ghosts, but I think maybe you should use a dedicated notebook for it.

Yuuko and Teiichi:
Huh?

Momoe:
I mean, I got embarrassed...
I couldn't help seeing it while updating the daily log...
You know?

Yuuko and Teiichi:
Aah!



Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun!
Here you go... Salt.
It's important that you purify yourself since you just got home from a funeral after all.

Kirie:
Home? This is school.

Teiichi:
But I, anyway... I don't really think I need purification salt, given that it was your funeral and everything.

Kirie:
Fine, I'll take some too.

Yuuko:
Here you go.

Kirie:
I just wanna be clear, I feel this is wrong on multiple levels...

Yuuko:
But it's taken quite a while for my body's discovery until the funeral.

Kirie:
Technically, it was an unnatural death, so they had to perform an autopsy.

Yuuko:
An autopsy?
You mean they looked at me?
At my body?
Like there... and there?

Kirie:
Who cares? It's only a bunch of old bones.

Yuuko:
No... No... It's so embarrassing!

Teiichi:
I guess this concludes a few things.

Kirie:
Yeah, Yuuko's remains have been interred.
The shrine beneath the club room will be moved and rectified.
The grave that Asagi-san made on the hill has also been moved to the Kanoe family plot.
The underground passage will be filled, and the club room will become storage again.
Everything is taken care of.

Teiichi:
It feels a little sad though, don't you think?

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun!
Let's go on a date!

Teiichi:
What? All of a sudden?

Yuuko:
Yes, let's go on a date.

Teiichi:
But, you can't leave this school grounds though, can you?

Yuuko:
That's right.

Teiichi:
Th-Then it would be just like our normal club activities, right?

Yuuko:
Not at all!
If I say we're on a date, then we're on a date!

Teiichi:
It's not that I mind but... exactly what would we do on a date?

Yuuko:
Isn't that obvious?
All the things I haven't done with you yet!

Teiichi:
Wait, all of them?

Yuuko:
Yes, all of them.
Now hurry!
Run!

Teiichi:
I didn't think that dates were supposed to be this rushed!

Kirie:
What in the world could they still need to do?
What could they...? What is it?
Wait, that? No.
You gotta be kidding me!
Whatever!
Screw you guys!
I'm definitely drinking milk...



Teiichi:
Where did you get those clothes?

Yuuko:
I borrowed them from the theater club.
We're on a date, so I have to dress up.

Teiichi:
But I, uh, I don't think that's your size...

Yuuko:
What?
Are you saying I'm fat?

Teiichi:
That's not what I meant.
Watch out!

Yuuko:
What are you doing?!

I'm sorry. Did that hurt?

Teiichi:
Not really. And it was kind of my fault anyway.
Funny it sounds I'm actually sort of happy about this.

Yuuko:
Huh?

Teiichi:
It was different, you know?
Until recently, you hardly ever got angry.

Yuuko:
After I united with my other self, the emotions I'd discarded returned.
Maybe this is my true self?

Teiichi:
You were great before, but I love you the way you are now, too.

Yuuko:
Thank you, Teiichi-kun.

This feels so nice.

Teiichi:
We're surrounded by snow.
Are you sure it's okay?

Yuuko:
Of course, it is, silly.
Please stroke my hair.
I always let you rest your head on my lap, so I thought the opposite might be nice.
I know!

Teiichi:
What are you doing, Yuuko-san?

Yuuko:
Now you can rest it on my arm!

Teiichi:
Honestly... Yuuko-san...
What's the matter?

Yuuko:
I was just thinking of how happy I feel right now.

Teiichi:
Yeah, me too.

Yuuko:
I just keep wishing this happiness would last forever for us.

Teiichi:
It will.

Yuuko:
Huh?

Teiichi:
It'll last forever. I promise.

Yuuko:
You promise... forever...

Aw! What's going on?
It's numb! I can't feel my arm!

Teiichi:
I tried to warn you about that, didn't I?
It'll be fine in a minute.
I'll let you rest on my arm this time.

Yuuko:
Um...

Teiichi:
Huh?
You don't want to?

Yuuko:
No, it's not that.
Some other time, okay?

Teiichi:
S-Sure.

Yuuko:
Here, your bento.
We're running behind schedule, so you'll have to eat fast.

Teiichi:
Wait, what schedule?

Yuuko:
The schedule that I made for a date.
We still have folk dancing, freestyle judo, holding hands while skating across the ice on the pool, and riding a bike together.
Doesn't that sound great?
What's that? Any complaints?

Teiichi:
No, not at all!
We're gonna be spending a lot of time being close with all of that.

Yuuko:
I-If it's a date, what's wrong with that?
We're on a date!

Teiichi:
Y-You're right about that and it's a date after all.

Yuuko:
Then, here we go.
Ready? Ta-da! A super-fancy sweet omelet medley!

Teiichi:
Well, you're really sensitive about the whole omelet things, huh?

Yuuko:
There's plenty...
Bonito stock, kelp stock, sardine stock, and this one is chicken consomme stock.
Okay, are you ready?
Here we go... Ready?
All right. Say, "Ah!"

Teiichi:
Ah...

Yuuko:
I finally was able to feed you a piece of sweet omelet.
I'm... I'm so happy...

Teiichi:
So happy you're crying?

Yuuko:
Let me... I'm just so happy.
I really am so happy...
I can't help crying.

Teiichi:
Here, you too, Yuuko-san.

Yuuko:
Huh?

Teiichi:
Here it comes.
Open up.
Now, "Ah."

Yuuko:
Ah...

Teiichi:
Is it good?

Yuuko:
Mm, yes, it is.
It's the best thing I've ever tasted.

Teiichi:
Now you're exaggerating.

Yuuko:
No, I'm really not.
It's the first time something has tasted so good to me.
Teiichi-kun, have more...
Here, "Ah..."
I-I'm sorry...
I'm just nervous.
"Ah..."
Since I dropped my chopsticks... let's try again.
"Ah..."

Teiichi:
All right.
Ah...

Yuuko:
I guess I overdid with the food, huh?

Teiichi:
The final batch with the tonkotsu pork stock was a bit much.
Uh, you don't need skates?

Yuuko:
No, I can't move anymore.

Teiichi:
I guess not.

Hm?
Yuuko-san...
You dropped something.
Yuuko-san?

Yuuko:
Don't.

Teiichi:
Huh?
Is something wrong?

Yuuko:
Thank you... Teiichi-kun.
Thank you for everything up to now.
So thank you...
And goodbye.

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun, we should separate.



Yuuko:
Let's say our goodbyes, Teiichi-kun.

Teiichi:
Hold on a second!
What are you talking about, Yuuko-san?

Yuuko:
Looks like this won't work anymore...

Teiichi:
Won't work? What do you mean?

Yuuko:
I... I can't stay in this world any longer.

Teiichi:
What are you saying?

Yuuko:
I'm going... I'm going to disappear.
The reason that I stayed in this world as a ghost... was probably because I needed to do something.
That was reuniting my two selves, which had become separated.
Thanks to you, that came to pass.
With your help, I was able to integrate my bitter past, the memories of that time, and the emotions I'd excised.
I have no more regrets.
And so...
I-It looks like this is the end...

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san!

Yuuko:
But that's okay.

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
I was very happy... every moment since the day I met you.
That's all I really needed.

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san, you...

Yuuko:
Inside of me, the memories of my other self exist, too.
That self that suffered every single day, for sixty years since that incident.
This time with you managed to heal even those bitter memories...
Thank you, Teiichi-kun.

Teiichi:
Uh...

Yuuko:
Let's say goodbye now.

Teiichi:
Why are you doing this?!

Yuuko:
Because it's the end.
I want us to have a nice parting.

Teiichi:
Well, that's not what I want!
Isn't there anything?
Any way you don't have to disappear?
Why?

Yuuko:
Have you ever seen any ghosts other than me?

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
A lot of people are born and die, so why aren't there any other ghosts?
It's strange.
Ghosts don't exist in this world, Teiichi-kun.

Teiichi:
Please don't give up!

Yuuko:
Even if they do exist, they can't stay in the world of the living forever.

Teiichi:
But we've been able to spend all this time together!

Yuuko:
Once their regrets are gone, they fade along with them.

Teiichi:
There must be a way! There has to be!

Yuuko:
I had a feeling something like this was going to happen to me at some point.

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san!

Yuuko:
So it isn't painful.
I mean, I'm already dead, right?

Teiichi:
No.

Yuuko:
That's why I can't be sad.
It's time that wasn't really mine.

Teiichi:
No.

Yuuko:
That's why...

Teiichi:
No, no, no!
I don't want you to go away, all right?!
I'm not going to accept this!
We'll come up with a plan, anything!
I'm sure Kirie-san will know something...

Yuuko:
Please stop.

Teiichi:
I'll explain the situation to Okonogi-san, too.
She knows all about this stuff...

Yuuko:
Stop.

Teiichi:
Don't worry...
I'm sure they'll both be willing to help us.

Yuuko:
Stop!

Teiichi:
What are you doing?!

Yuuko:
It's our last moment!
I don't want anyone to intrude!

Teiichi:
It can't be our last moment together!
If there's even an ounce of hope, I will do anything!
Even if we have zero chance, let's do everything we can!

Yuuko:
I've done all that... long ago...
Everything I could think of.
Everything that I could do...
I tried everything but...
But... it's impossible.

Teiichi:
Then... if there really is no way at all, I'll stay by your side until the end, because every second counts.

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun, please give up...

Teiichi:
I will not give up.

Yuuko:
Just go home now.

Teiichi:
I will not go home!

Yuuko:
Just leave me alone here.

Teiichi:
I will not leave you alone!

Yuuko:
Please!
I don't want you to see me disappear!
I know you'll continue to love me.
That's why I know that watching me disappear will make you really sad.
Then I can't stand that.
You must continue living after I'm gone.
You have to find someone new, fall in love with them, and find a new happiness.
For that to happen, you have to forget about me quickly.

Teiichi:
But... there's no way I can just forget about you!

Yuuko:
I'm sorry I forced you to stay with me until now.

Teiichi:
No, it wasn't like that at all! It wasn't!

Yuuko:
Goodbye...
Let go...

Teiichi:
I'm never letting go.

Yuuko:
Please... let go.

Teiichi:
No! No matter what, I will not let go of your hand!

Yuuko:
Don't...

Teiichi:
Listen to me, I am going to stay with you until the end!
I'm not going to leave you!

Yuuko:
Please...

Teiichi:
No, I'm staying!
If nothing else, I have that right!
Every second we have together is important... because I love you!

Yuuko:
I said I don't...
Please just go...

Teiichi:
It's not so bad, is it?

Yuuko:
If you say stuff like that, my resolve will weaken...
I wanted to make our parting nice...

Teiichi:
But, I couldn't leave you to be sad all by yourself.

This is where we first met, isn't it?

Yuuko:
Yes.

Teiichi:
I was remembering a ghost story and looking into this big mirror when I sensed something behind me.

Yuuko:
That's why you were aware of me and were able to see me.

Teiichi:
The reason I came into this room was because I felt like I was being called here.
I-I think it was the sound of a bell.

Yuuko:
My other self had called to you... in order to overcome the endless hours.
I know now she was lonely.

Teiichi:
Is that because I'm Asa-chan's grandson?

Yuuko:
No, I'm honestly not sure about that, but I do know my other self liked you, too.
In the end, all I am is me.

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san...

Yuuko:
Because you... really loved me.

Teiichi:
Huh...

Yuuko:
You were the first... showed me what I was like to lo...
So I thought...

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san, your voice is...

No...

I guess so, huh.

You don't have to apologize to me.

I'll try...

I guess not.

Not a single tear, okay?

Don't worry. I promise...

No, I won't do anything that might weigh on your soul.

Yuuko-san...

If I do that, do you promise you'll feel at ease?
If I do that, will you finally be able to go on without regrets?
I understand.
Then I'll forget about you just like you asked me to.
Don't worry.
I think it'll take time.
I doubt I'll be able to do it right away.
But I won't keep carrying you as baggage forever.
If that's really what you want me to do, I'll forget about you, and find someone new...
I will live my life like I did before we met.
I'll work hard and move on as best I can... if that will make you happy...

Yuuko-san! Yuuko-san!
Don't go!
You can't!
Not yet!



Momoe:
Niiya-san!
We'll be able to enter the old school wing again soon!
Cool, huh?

Teiichi:
Huh? The old school wing?

Momoe:
There were rumors about tearing it down.
But I heard they're gonna keep it because it has historic value.
Let's revive the Paranormal Investigation Club!

Teiichi:
Mmhmm. Sounds good to me.

Kirie:
Niiya.

Teiichi:
Huh? Kirie-san.

Kirie:
You seem well.

Teiichi:
I guess so.

Kirie:
All right.
Then that's fine.

Teiichi:
Kirie-san?

Kirie:
Hm?

Teiichi:
Would you please join the club again?

Kirie:
Maybe if I feel like it.



Teiichi:
This is a story from back when I still didn't know anything.
About a "me"... that I no longer remember.
After countless extensions to, and modifications of the buildings, these cobbled-together structures hold sixty years' worth of history.
Classrooms that have become storage rooms.
Stairs that no one ever climbs.
Hallways that simply end abruptly.
Buildings as complicated as mazes.
All of these have helped to birth many mysterious rumors.
No, it was all a dream, an illusion.
I know nothing anymore.
I've sealed away all memories of her.
I won't allow myself to remember them.
After all, that's what she wanted.
That's why I...



Teiichi:
The "True Paranormal Investigation Club"?
Okonogi-san... outdid herself.
If she planned to do this, she should have said something.
Ah, she repaired it...
Huh?
If you open this you'll be cursed?

Yuuko:
You just had to open it, didn't you?
I'm back home!

Teiichi:
But how?

Yuuko:
I'm not sure, but it appears I wasn't really ready to move on.
I thought I had no more regrets left... but I guess I was wrong because here I am again.
Back with you and I think I know why that is... I simply just couldn't forget about it...

Teiichi:
Forget what?

Yuuko:
What do you think, silly?
The thing that brought me back to you was the last kiss... we... shared.

Teiichi:
Ooh!

Yuuko:
It was so amazing...
I couldn't leave this world.
I had to stay here with you.
So... you... mean... to take responsibility.
You can do that, right, Teiichi-kun?

Teiichi:
Take responsibility? What do you mean...?

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun!



Teiichi:
And that's how it happened.
And in every meaning of the word, I was truly possessed by Yuuko-san.
