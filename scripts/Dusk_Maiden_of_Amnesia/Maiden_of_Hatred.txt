  Shadow Yuuko:
Angry. Scared. Lonely. Sad...
Bitter. Jealous. Hurt...
Hurt...

Momoe:
Kirie-san!

Kirie:
Ah!

Momoe:
I'm so glad you're here.
Since you haven't been coming, I was afraid you'd quit the club.
The last time you came was when Niiya-san took his break.

Kirie:
Okonogi?
Huh?
She's gone again?



Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun!

Teiichi:
Huh? Hey, good morning, Yuuko-san.

Yuuko:
Hurry up! You're too slow. Start running!

Teiichi:
Huh? Okay, okay...

Yuuko:
Good morning, Teiichi-kun.

Teiichi:
Hey! What... What are you doing?

Yuuko:
What do you mean? I'm hugging you.
Aren't you happy?

Teiichi:
Huh? Oh, yeah, uh...

Yuuko:
After all, you do love me, right?

Teiichi:
Don't you understand?
It's because I... I'm in love with you!

Yuuko:
Or was that a lie?

Teiichi:
N-No, it wasn't.

Yuuko:
Then, I wanna hear it again

Teiichi:
What?

Yuuko:
Tell me you love me. Tell me you love me right this second.
Can't you do it?

Teiichi:
Well, I, uh...

Yuuko:
You don't want to?

Teiichi:
No, that's not a...

Yuuko:
Then say it.
I... am... waiting...

Teiichi:
O-Okay.
I love you.

Yuuko:
I can't hear you. Louder!

Teiichi:
I love you.

Yuuko:
Louder!

Teiichi:
I love you.

Yuuko:
Just a little more.

Teiichi:
I'm in love with Yuuko-san!
Kirie-san?

Kirie:
Why are you putting on a comedy act?

Yuuko:
Pardon me? Comedy?
It was just getting good, so don't interrupt.

Kirie:
Yuuko, you know that if you block the gate, you're in the way.
You really never tire of it, do you?
You guys are all over each other constantly.
Anyway, Niiya, I wanted to talk to you about...

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san?

Yuuko:
Let's go, Teiichi-kun.

Teiichi:
Uh, hey, hold on a sec.

Kirie:
Yuuko... got mad?



Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun.
Hey, Teiichi-kun.
It's boring if you don't reply.
That's not important.
You still haven't finished declaring your love.
Why not?
If you do, I'll tell you all the answers.
I can sneak up front and look at them.
Then say it.
What's that say?
What? Is that all?
Not good enough. You have to say it!
You're trying to get out of saying it!
I'm not gonna let you.

Teiichi:
Ow, stop it!

Teacher:
All right, time's up.
Those in the back, please collect the forms.

Teiichi:
But... wait a sec...

Teacher:
How dare you mock your teacher?



Teiichi:
Yuuko-san, you're terrible...

Yuuko:
You'll be fine.
To make up for it...
Ta-dah!
Well? Pretty good resemblance.

Teiichi:
Did you make this yourself?

Yuuko:
Yeah, I snuck into the cooking class to whip it up for you.

Teiichi:
This is great. I didn't know you could cook.

Yuuko:
Impressed, aren't you?
Say, "Ah."

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
Not "huh," silly.
"Ah..."

Teiichi:
But it's embarrassing.

Yuuko:
It's no problem. Nobody else around here can see me.

Teiichi:
I-I know that, but if they look at me, then...
Ah...
That's even more embarrassing...

Yuuko:
It's really fine.
You don't stand out at all, so I'm sure you're just as invisible as me.
Anyway, anyone's going to feed you sweet omelet around here, it's gonna be me.

Teiichi:
Don't tell me you're still hung up about that.

Yuuko:
Say, "Ah"!

Momoe:
Niiya-san!

Teiichi:
Hey, Okonogi-san, is it true that I don't stand out?

Momoe:
What are you talking about?
Quite the opposite. You shine just like the morning sun!
But aren't you going to eat your lunch?

Teiichi:
Huh? Oh, well, uh...

Momoe:
Would you like to eat lunch with me?
I made a special pork cutlet bento today.

Yuuko:
Ah!

Teiichi:
Uh...

Yuuko:
Ah!

Teiichi:
Wait, wait! Come back!

Momoe:
If it's drinks, I have those, too.
If you're okay with Diet.
Oh, you did bring a lunch.
Wow, that's amazing! It looks just like you. That is so cute.
Can I have a taste, is that okay?
That is just so adorable!

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san was... crying?



Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun's an idiot! Ah!
I won't forgive you for this, Teiichi-kun.
But I'm going to stick to you like glue today.
Huh?

Teiichi:
I thought you'd be here, so I, uh...
I'm sorry about how things turned out at lunch.
Okonogi-san can be pretty pushy, but she doesn't mean anything.
I mean, she can't see you.
Uh... what's wrong, Yuuko-san?
Your face is beet red.

Yuuko:
(Shriek)

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
Are you pervert?!

Teiichi:
Pervert? But usually you're the one who...

Yuuko:
Just get out of here!



Kirie:
Well... what are the two of you doing now?
Looks like something in a seedy club.

Yuuko:
What's that supposed to mean?

Kirie:
Anyway, this morning, I wanted to tell you... that I saw her again, Shadow Yuuko.

Teiichi:
Shadow Yuuko?

Kirie:
Yesterday, she was in this room.
"Angry. Scared. Lonely. Bitter. Jealous." she said.
She looked just like Yuuko, except she was a repulsive ghost.
Yuuko, you didn't see her?
Aren't you always on the school premises?

Yuuko:
I have no idea. I've never seen her before...

Teiichi:
Wait, you don't remember?

Yuuko:
Remember what?

Kirie:
I thought so...
It isn't that she doesn't remember.
She doesn't know. She excised the memories.

Momoe:
Niiya-san, why didn't you say anything?!

Teiichi:
Huh?

Momoe:
You could have let me in on it.
Why didn't you tell me there's a ghost in the club room?
Is it really the Old School Wing Ghost, Yuuko-san?!

Teiichi:
Kirie-san...

Kirie:
I told her.

Teiichi:
And exactly how much did you tell her?

Kirie:
I just told her there's a ghost here.

Teiichi:
But why? Why now?

Kirie:
You know the situation.
I thought it'd be better to have as many allies as possible.

Momoe:
Where's Yuuko-san?
Where's the ghost?
Is she the only ghost-san in here?

Kirie:
I thought being aware let you see her...

Momoe:
Maybe Ogopogo or Meke Meke or even the chupacabra is here, too!
Please come out! Come out!

Teiichi:
Yeah, but I think her awareness is focused the wrong way.

Momoe:
I knew this school was a treasure trove of the paranormal...

Yuuko:
So let's go investigate those things, Teiichi-kun.
I can't wait.

Teiichi:
You mean the chupacabra?

Yuuko:
What are you talking about?
You said you'd investigate my past and help me regain my memory.

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
I found some interesting stories in this log book -- the one we found at the training camp.
This school has a Stone of Curses.

Kirie:
A kind of forgetfulness.

Teiichi:
Amnesia.



Momoe:
Here it is, Niiya-san!
That's the Stone of Curses.

Teiichi:
Yeah, it is.

Momoe:
There's something written here.
Huh? These are all.. people's names!

Teiichi:
If you carve someone's name there, you can curse them.
And if you find your own name on the stone, you'll be cursed and die.

Yuuko:
How do you know that?

Teiichi:
Oh, well...
So, Yuuko-san forgot that, too.

Momoe:
Ah!

Teiichi:
Huh?

Momoe:
Niiya-san, your name is here!
What should we do?
We should do something, so you don't...

Teiichi:
No, it's okay.
It's just written with a marker, that's all.

Momoe:
Huh? You're right.
Who'd do something like this?
That's not funny at all!
Ah! My name's here, too!
It wasn't there a second ago. Why?! Jeez...

Teiichi:
Then even if we do learn about Yuuko-san's past, she'll just discard the memories she gets back.

Kirie:
It isn't as though she loses everything.
This morning, she got angry and slapped me.
The old Yuuko would never have done that, because she had excised the emotions like anger.

Teiichi:
Today, I saw Yuuko cry for the first time, after she dropped a rolled omelet.
She's more stubborn than she ever was before.
And she gets more embarrassed, too.
It's like she isn't quite the same anymore.

Kirie:
Yuuko forgot about you, but she regained those memories.
While she's forgotten you, where do you think those memories went?

Teiichi:
What do you mean, where?
You mean, to shadow Yuuko?

Kirie:
Teiichi, even when you hurt your leg and were trying not to see Yuuko, I kept seeing her.
But it was something other than Yuuko.
And it was jealous.

Momoe:
Huh?

Kirie:
It's possible that, alongside her memories of you, her jealousy was also sent into Shadow Yuuko.
alongside:(前置詞)と一緒に

Teiichi:
If that's true then she...

Kirie:
Maybe when Yuuko remembered you, she also somehow regained other displaced memories and emotions.

Momoe:
Seriously, who would do that?
That's not something to joke about.
What do they think ghost stories are?
And not just the stone, but my face...

Teiichi:
Really, that was a little too much.

Momoe:
That was for what she did to my lunch.

Teiichi:
Huh?

Yuuko:
I don't want you to go.

Teiichi:
But...

Yuuko:
Don't leave me.

Teiichi:
But I have to.

Momoe:
Niiya-san, what's wrong?
You coming?

Teiichi:
I'll see you again, tomorrow.

Yuuko:
But...

Teiichi:
See you tomorrow, Yuuko-san.

Momoe:
I kind of want a beef bowl...

Yuuko:
What is... What is this feeling?
I can't breathe... My chest is getting tight...
Is this loneliness?
Teiichi-kun, come and see me. Please...
I'm so lonely... Don't leave me alone!
No!
No...

Shadow Yuuko:
Did you remember?

Yuuko:
No...

Shadow Yuuko:
That is your truth.

Yuuko:
Please stop.

Shadow Yuuko:
That is who you are.

Yuuko:
Don't. I don't wanna remember.

Shadow Yuuko:
But that is the reality.

Yuuko:
No...

Shadow Yuuko:
You want to stay pure that badly?

Yuuko:
That's right.

Shadow Yuuko:
You don't want to dirty yourself?

Yuuko:
That's right...

Shadow Yuuko:
Even though you're actually ugly?

Yuuko:
That's right!
I mean, I don't want Teiichi-kun to stop liking me!
Huh?

Shadow Yuuko:
You are horrible...

Yuuko:
Don't come near me...

Shadow Yuuko:
Why not?
I am you. You are me.
I am always you, and the two of us were originally one.

Yuuko:
No!

Shadow Yuuko:
Did you remember all of those memories?
Did you remember the emotions?
You don't want to, right? It's painful. It hurts.
So much that you want to forget. But I cannot.
You know why? Because I am that very memory.
Do you understand my pain?

Yuuko:
I don't... I don't want to understand!

Shadow Yuuko:
I understood your pain, your suffering.
And then, a new pain was born...
The pain of envying you as he loved you.
And then, new pain was forced on me again...
The pain of not being able to see him.
Share you comfort with me...
I want to share my pain with you, too!
I can't bear it anymore.

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san!

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun...

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san, run!

What is this?
She's appearing and disappearing like a ghost...
Wait, is that how it's meant to be?

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun, why?

Teiichi:
I came back because I was worried about you.

Yuuko:
Teiichi-kun...

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san, please hide in here.

Yuuko:
I can't. She'll find me.

Teiichi:
It's fine. I'm going to talk to her.

Please come out!
I know you're here.
You can hear me, right?
Listen to me.
Please don't cause Yuuko-san any more suffering!

Shadow Yuuko:
How enviable...
You're always like that.
That's what's causing me pain.

Teiichi:
Who are you?
What are you?

Shadow Yuuko:
You already know.
I am Yuuko, Yuuko Kanoe.

Teiichi:
Why are you making her suffer?

Shadow Yuuko:
I'm the one who's suffering.
That child is just running from it.

Teiichi:
But that's...

Shadow Yuuko:
I am the ugly emotions that she cut away and discarded, her dirty memories.
Unlike her, I must continue to live those memories without any hope for peace.
That is who I am.
Do you hate me?
Even though I am Yuuko? The very same Yuuko.
I see. She wants to throw me away...

Teiichi:
Yuuko-san!
Yuuko-san...

Shadow Yuuko:
Did you think you could escape?!

Yuuko:
No! Nooo!

Shadow Yuuko:
You can't run away from yourself.
Why do you keep struggling?
Let's end this...
Let's end this now...

Teiichi:
Stop it!

Wh-What just happened?
Yuuko-san, this way!
The school gate... Why is...?

Yuuko:
It's no use, Teiichi-kun.

Teiichi:
What's going on?

Yuuko:
It looks like I can't leave school grounds!

Teiichi:
But we were...

Yuuko:
I'm sorry...
Why is this happening to me?

Teiichi:
Come on!
Please just stop!



Teiichi:
What happened to me?
Where am I?
My body is moving by itself.
Wh-What am I trying to do?
What?
Is that...?
Uh, what?
Could this be... Yuuko-san's memory...?

Yuuko:
The weather's great today!
