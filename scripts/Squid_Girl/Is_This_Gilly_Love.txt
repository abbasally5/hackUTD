  Nagisa:
The wind is really picking up. I better go in.

Goro:
How are you feeling?

Nagisa:
I don't know. What happened?

Goro:
A wave got the better of you.

Nagisa:
So then, you must have saved me from drawning.
Thank you for doing that.

Goro:
Just so long as you're safe. The surf's high today, so be careful.
See you.

Nagisa:
Wait. Who are you?

Goro:
My name is Goro Arashiyama.
I'm a Life Saver. My job is protecting the sea. Bye.



Eiko:
What? You nearly drawned?

Nagisa:
I was surfing in a big wave wiped me out.

Eiko:
It's okay to get into it but you got to be careful.

Chizuru:
Here. Could you serve these, please?

Nagisa:
Sure.

Squid Girl:
You know, next time you might not be so lucky.

Nagisa:
You mean, a squid person was behind that?

Squid Girl:
I just love the way she jets scared of me.
Yeah, that's right.
I'm the emissary of the sea after all. Controlling waves is almost second nature to me.

Nagisa:
Y-You can really do that?

Squid Girl:
I love how bad Nagisa is at hiding her emotions.

Nagisa:
What are you planning on doing to me?

Squid Girl:
Would you like to know?

Eiko:
Quit it! You waste way too much time acting fishy and scaring her!

Squid Girl:
Stop trying to sound like me, it's insulting!

Eiko:
What if I squid around a little too?

Squid Girl:
Not squiding way! Now you take that back right now!

Nagisa:
Talking like a squid person?
I knew it. Everyone here has been brainwashed by squid people.
I've got to resist with all my strength.

Chizuru:
Oh, hello there, Goro.

Goro:
Ch-Chizuru! Hi, ah, good afternoon.
I'll, ah... I'll have some shrimp-fried rice.

Chizuru:
Okay.

Nagisa:
I'm grateful for what you did for me yesterday.

Goro:
Oh, you're that girl.

Nagisa:
I'm Nagisa Saito.

Goro:
Well, it's nice to meet you, Nagisa.

Eiko:
Well, well. Look at Mr. suave over here. You two got something going?

Goro:
Lay off, it's not like that.

Nagisa:
He saved me when I was drawning in the surf yesterday.

Eiko:
Oh, is that so? Well done!

Squid Girl:
He saved Nagisa?
What the kelp do you think you're doing squiding around with my Nagisa, Goro?
Oh, no. Do you plan to spill the beans to her that I'm actually pretty friendly for an inkvader and that I'm the most popular squid around here now?
I've got to do something.
I need Nagisa to be even more scared of me.

Squid Girl:
Hey, Goro!

Goro:
Oh, it's you, squid.

Squid Girl:
Nagisa here is my prey!

Nagisa:
She called me her "prey."

Squid Girl:
So you keep your tentacles off her.

Goro:
All I did was save her from drawning.

Eiko:
Have you completely lost your little mind? Since when did Nagisa become your prey?

Nagisa:
That's right and what does she mean by "prey" anyway?
She's gonna try brainwashing me next?

Eiko:
Oh, I get it. You're jealous of Goro, aren't you?

Squid Girl:
Huh? I'm not jealous of anysquid!

Eiko:
You turned bright red which, I guess, proves my point.

Squid Girl:
It's not true! Why the gill would I be kraken jealous with someone like Goro anyway?

Goro:
What do you mean by that?
You know, you really ought to watch that mouth of yours, squid.

Squid Girl:
You better watch your beak too or I'm gonna have to squid you a lesson!

Goro:
Is that so?

Nagisa:
He deals with her normally enough.
But someone who protects the sea could never get along xxx an invader.
There must be some reason.

Nagisa:
Mr. Arashiyama!
I was wondering how you feel about this squid person.

Goro:
How do I feel about her?

Eiko:
Wait, does Nagisa have a thing for Goro?

Squid Girl:
If he tells anything weird now, it'll damage my reputation as a fearful inkvader from the sea.

Goro:
Well, I...

Squid Girl:
He thinks I'm a great threat to humanity who's really really dangerous and ought be feared and respected.

Goro:
You don't get to answer this!

Squid Girl:
What's the big deal? I was just squiding what you were thinking.

Goro:
That's not what I was thinking, squid.

Nagisa:
I'm serious about this!

Eiko:
Well, I guess I was right. She's really into him.

Goro:
Ah, all right.
As you probably noticed she's usually pretty hostile towards me.

Squid Girl:
I'm gladius to hear it.

Goro:
But kids like her and she tends to be very helpful. She even helped me save this one kid who was drawning.
She's a good person, deep down.

Nagisa:
Really?

Goro:
Right, Squid?

Nagisa:
H-He's smiling!

Squid Girl:
He must have me confuse with some other squid. I'm really an inkvader so I never do anything like that. Really!

Eiko:
Nah, nah. Don't be shy.

Nagisa:
Just like the others. He isn't afraid of squid people either.
Which means, that he's been brainwashed by her too!
Nooo!

Squid Girl:
Hey! Look what you did! I just lost a true believer because of you!

Goro:
Did I just say something I shouldn't have?

Eiko:
Maybe you should listen to your heart.
This guy is dense.
But then, he only has eyes for Chizuru.

Goro:
I wonder when her rice will be ready.

Nagisa:
Mr. Arashiyama is this beach's last line of defense.
There's no hope for the world if I can't bring him back to his senses.
It's the least I can do since I owe him my life.

Chizuru:
Here you go.

Goro:
Chizuru's fried rice.
Hey!

Squid Girl:
That's some good shrimp, you know.

Goro:
Not again. Damn it! Give me back Chizuru's cooking. I'm getting tired of this. Give it back right now!

Squid Girl:
It's what you jet for saying to Nagisa what you did!

Nagisa:
I'm not gonna give up on you, Mr. Arashiyama. No matter what!

Goro:
Huh?

Eiko:
She said it! Wow!

Chizuru:
It's not easy being popular, is it?

Goro:
It's not like that!

Nagisa:
Oh, yes it is!
I have decided. I'm gonna protect you, Mr. Arashiyama.
I'm not afraid of likes of you, squid!

Squid Girl:
Oh, good. She's still gilly afraid of me. This is great.
Nagisa, you don't have to pretend to be brave!
I'm so happy.

Eiko:
You know, this is started to get really interesting.

Sanae:
Is Squiddie around?

Eiko:
This is complicated enough as it is!

Sanae:
Huh?
