Happy birthday, Yoshio.
Happy birthday.

Squid Girl:
How come I've never seen this menu before?

Eiko:
Because it's only for special occasions.

Chizuru:
We'd like to offer families a really nice discount on birthday cakes if they have their parties right here at the shop.

Squid Girl:
Birthday?

Chizuru:
You see, here on the surface once a year we'd like to celebrate the day we were born.

Squid Girl:
Day you were born...

Eiko:
I guess she doesn't even know when her own birthday is.

Squid Girl:
Okay. I declare that today is my hatch day!
So I get a celebration too, right?

Eiko:
You just decided that arbitrarily. It's not your birthday, is it?

Squid Girl:
Oh, yeah, so what if it's not! I want in on this action!

Eiko:
You know, you really are getting more shameless everyday.
Look, even if today really were your birthday, which I'm sure it's not,
who'd wanna celebrate that for a squid who wants to conquer mankind?

Squid Girl:
I can't believe you swam there...

Chizuru:
That's a good idea. I think we should throw a nice hatchday party for Squid Girl.

Squid Girl:
All right!

Eiko:
C'mon, are you serious?



Takeru:
We're back from shopping!

Squid Girl:
So what did you buy at the store!?

Eiko:
Geez. What are you doing?

Squid Girl:
Is there anything else ink here?
A golden tentacle?
No, somehow I doubt it.
Just show yourself for what you gilly are!

Eiko:
Huh? Oh, what now?

Squid Girl:
Hey, cut it out. You're so stubborn.

Eiko:
Hey!

Eiko:
You can stay in here.

Squid Girl:
What for!? Why!?

Eiko:
Because you're the star here so just chill out.

Squid Girl:
The star?

Eiko:
That's right. We call you when we're read, okay?
So just sit tight for a while.

Squid Girl:
I jet it. Someday I'm gonna be the conqueror and supreme ruler of the entire surface world.
Naturally, all the little fish on the surface will be working exclusively for me.

Takeru:
Oh, wow, that looks really great, Sis!

Eiko:
You think? Well, it's more than she deserves.

Chizuru:
Well, Goro, you're really going the extra mile.

Goro:
Well, I figured this was necessary.

Squid Girl:
What the squid! Are those suckers enjoying making me an outcast out of me!?

Takeru:
Oh, wow, that looks really great, Sis!

Eiko:
You think? Well, it's more than she deserves.

Chizuru:
Well, Goro, you're really going the extra mile.

Goro:
Well, I figured this was necessary.

Everyone:
Tonight we all dine on a tasty meal of Squid Girl!

Eiko:
All right, Squid Girl. We're ready!

Squid Girl:
You stay away from me!

Takeru:
There you are!

Everyone:
Happy hatchday, Squid Girl!

Squid Girl:
Wow, I feel like I squid something really important!

Eiko:
You didn't do anything...

Chizuru:
Here's your hatchday cake.

Squid Girl:
Let's hurry up and eat it!

Eiko:
Wait. We have to put candles on to show how old you are.
How old are you anyway?

Squid Girl:
Beats the squid out of me.

Eiko:
If I had to guess based on how slow you are, I'd say it was this.

Squid Girl:
Hey! My life's been a long, more meaningful than that!
That needs to be at least ten or twenty candles here!
That's more like it.

Eiko:
You're not that old. No way.

Takeru:
Now, just blow them out, Squid Girlie!

Chizuru:
Here goes.

Squid Girl:
Oh, wow, I'm feeling squiddy dizzy...

Takeru:
Squid Girlie!

Chizuru:
Not enough oxygen.

Eiko:
Yeah, it's because she insisted on so many candles.

Goro:
Hey, are you all right down there?

Squid Girl:
I'll get this!

Goro:
Squid ink...

Eiko:
That doesn't work as a cake topping...

Squid Girl:
Um, well, I just... I mean I didn't...
The addition of squid ink makes it an authentic squid cake!

Eiko:
Nobody asked for your clever input!

Takeru:
C'mon guys! Let's light some fireworks!

Squid Girl:
Ah, squiddy good idea!

Takeru:
Here you go. This is a hatchday present for me to you!

Squid Girl:
So these are called fireworks?

Eiko:
It's so pretty!

Chizuru:
I think it's fun doing this on the beach at night.

Goro:
Huh? I thought there were more in there than that.

Takeru:
Well, there was, a minute ago.

Squid Girl:
You suckers have a lots to learn!
I think my way is overwhelmingly squidier!

Eiko:
Does anybody else consider this an absurd waste of talent?

Squid Girl:
Hot! Hot! Hot!

Eiko:
Don't wave them everywhere!

Goro:
You need water!

Takeru:
Squid Girlie, are you okay?

Goro:
You have to be careful when you handle fire.

Eiko:
You're obviously not cut out to be an invader if you can't even deal with some silly fireworks.

Squid Girl:
Well, that's not your kraken business!

Chizuru:
I'm surprised though.

Takeru:
About what?

Chizuru:
I thought fire would be something that fish and shellfish would fear more than anything else.

Eiko:
Come to think of it, I have heard that the squids are viscerally attracted by light.
There you go.

Takeru:
Squid Girlie, look out!

Squid Girl:
I thought I was a dead squid!
What's the big idea, Takeru!

Eiko:
She's an animal.

Squid Girl:
You tried to kill me? Well, are you?

Eiko:
You must be hyperactive the way you never stop moving like that.
Just relax.

Squid Girl:
All right. So this is what humans do to celebrate my hatchday, huh?

Eiko:
There's a fireworks display in town tonight.

Takeru:
I forgot all about it.

Goro:
Those big ones really are intense.

Chizuru:
You're right.

Eiko:
You always have to light up some sparklers to end the night.

Chizuru:
It's so elegant.

Squid Girl:
I can't wait for my hatchday when it comes next month.

Eiko:
Huh? But birthdays only happen once a year.

Squid Girl:
But that's kraken boring!
