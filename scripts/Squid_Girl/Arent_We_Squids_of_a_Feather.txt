  Goro:
Sometimes the Life Savers watch over the swimming area.
And sometimes they risk their own lives to save people.
They truly are the guardians of the sea. They are the Life Savers!

Girl:
Umm, excuse me! I'm not sure but it looks like someone's drowning there!

Goro:
Oh, no! Hang on! I'm coming!

Squid Girl:
Help! Help me! ...tentacles... cramped... help!



Takeru:
Are you okay, Squid Girlie?

Goro:
I take it, you know her?

Squid Girl:
I squidn't bother to stretch first, and my tentacles cramped up.

Goro:
Stand back, Takeru!

Squid Girl:
You don't have to get all up in arms, you know.
I know Takeru. He's not a bad fish.

Goro:
I was protecting him!

Squid Girl:
Huh?

Goro:
Now what are those wavy things!?
I think I might've just dragged something awful and monstrous out of the sea!

Eiko:
Hey, Squid Girl!
Huh?
What're you doing?

Takeru:
Oh, hi, Sis.
Squid Girlie was out in the ocean drowning and Goro here swam right out and saved her.

Squid Girl:
Umm, do you know the swimming human over there?

Eiko:
Yeah. We're childhood friends.
Hey, wait. How exactly does a squid suppose to drown?

Squid Girl:
Well, I squidn't any warm up exercises like I should have.

Eiko:
Are you a grade schooler?
Wait, if you came from the sea is it even possible for you to drown?

Squid Girl:
Oh, you're right, I can't!
I'm so used to surface life, I've completely forgotten I couldn't drown!



Chizuru:
Thank you, Goro. You're very brave.
I want you to have this on the house.

Goro:
I just did what's expected of all Life Savers, the guardians of the sea.

Chizuru:
Yeah, well, I'm very grateful you're out there watching everyday.

Squid Girl:
Look at him. Is he afraid of Chizuru of somefin?

Goro:
Well, I love the ocean more than anybody I know!

Squid Girl:
What!?

Goro:
What do you mean "what"?

Squid Girl:
Who the gill are you, anyway?

Goro:
A Life Saver who protects the sea. I'm Goro Arashiyama.

Squid Girl:
I'm Squid Girl, an emissary of the sea and its protector!

Eiko:
Hey, Goro, you do realize what she is, don't you?

Goro:
We feel the same way about the sea.

Squid Girl:
Two squids in a pod!

Eiko:
It doesn't mean the same thing.

Squid Girl:
Now then, why don't you go ahead and show me how a Light Saber like yourself does his noble job.

Goro:
I'm a Life Saver!

Takeru:
I'm coming too!

Goro:
A job like mine has many responsibilities. I patrol the beach's swimming area.

Squid Girl:
He must be making sure that no human suckers pollute the sea.

Goro:
I check the strength and direction of the currents.

Squid Girl:
He senses the wrath of the ocean through his skin.

Goro:
And I have to stay in excellent shape. Because you never know what'll happen.

Squid Girl:
You never know when the time will come to squid it to the humans.
Hmm, I think you do squiddy good work. For a human, of course.

Goro:
Life Savers are always on guard and prepared.
So how about you? What is it that you like to do to protect the sea, Squid Girl?

Squid Girl:
Huh?
I'm not doing a thing!

Takeru:
What's wrong, Squid Girlie?

Squid Girl:
Well, most of the time I just do this and that.

Goro:
This and that?

Squid Girl:
'kay! By the way, what the squid is that thing?

Goro:
Ah, that's where I sit everyday, and look out over the whole beach to make sure nothing's going wrong.

Squid Girl:
This is a tentacular view!

Takeru:
We're so high up! It feels great!

Goro:
You can't just climb up there!

Girl:
Catch!

Squid Girl:
Kneel before Squid Girl!
Shell some respect for the emissary of the sea!

Goro:
You're breaking the rules!

Squid Girl:
The first step in protecting the sea is conquering mankind!

Goro:
Why does that need to happen?

Squid Girl:
I guess we don't have that much in common after all.

Takeru:
Squid Girlie!

Squid Girl:
I'll show him which squid really deserves the title, an emissary of the sea.
Wait a minute. If he really squids up while he is the emissary and protector of the sea,
then won't that mean I'd be better suited than him for the job?
There he goes into the water.
I think it's time that sucker learned how humiliating it can be to nearly drown [like a/while you're] swimming.

Goro:
Ah, my leg's caught on something!

Squid Girl:
Having a little trouble?

Goro:
Squid Girl?

Squid Girl:
I guess even Life Savers have trouble in the water sometimes.

Goro:
Hey! This is no time for that! There's a kid over there caught in a riptide!
Damn it! Look. The last thing I wanna have to do is to depend on an amateur like you but please save her!

Squid Girl:
But if I go squidding over there to do that there's a chance you could die here!

Goro:
I don't care about that! I'm not asking you to save me!
Hurry! Get that little girl to safety!


Girl's mother:
Thank you so much. I'm so grateful.

Goro:
Oh, no. I'm afraid it wasn't me who did it.
If you wanna thank someone she's the one who saved your daughter.

Girl:
You saved me! Thank you, Miss!

Eiko:
Wow. Looks like all that squid stuff finally came in handy.

Chizuru:
You're right. Good for her.

Takeru:
Wish I could've seen her do it.

Squid Girl:
Well, it's not like I saved her because I wanted to or anything.
Mankind is my kraken enemy, you know.

Goro:
Yeah, well, thanks anyway. I think better of you now.

Goro:
Oh, Squid Girl. Thank you so much for rescuing me. I'm sorry I made you look like a fool!

Squid Girl:
That's gilly what was supposed to happen!
Be warned, human! You and I are enemies from now on!
