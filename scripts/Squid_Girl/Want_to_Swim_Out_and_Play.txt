  Eiko:
He's so cute!

Chizuru:
He's a sweet dog. What's his name?

Sanae:
His name is Alex.

Eiko:
Thanks for bringing him.
He's so cute. I could just pet him all day long.

Sanae:
Wow, Eiko. You sure do like dogs a lot.

Eiko:
Oh, you're adorable, aren't you?

Squid Girl:
Hey, what's that animal you're petting?

Eiko:
Don't you know what a dog is?
There really is a lot you don't know.

Squid Girl:
Well, in the ocean, I'm smarter than the average squid!
Hey, let go of that! It hurts! What's the squid idea!?

Eiko:
Sanae, call him off.

Sanae:
Alex! Stop that! Let go of that nice girl's hair.
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

Eiko:
Yeah, really, are you okay?

Squid Girl:
I think so...

Eiko:
I mean the dog.
You really shouldn't let a dog eat raw squid, you know.

Squid Girl:
You gotta be squidding me!

Sanae:
Yeah, sorry. Alex tends to bite unusual things he encounters.
I haven't been able to get him to stop doing it.

Eiko:
Bad boy, Alex. You don't want indigestion, do you?

Squid Girl:
That thing is the bad fish around here so why are you treating me and it this way!?

Eiko:
Isn't it obvious? He is the cute one!

Squid Girl:
Is that all?

Eiko:
You just thought he was cute for a second, didn't you?

Squid Girl:
Huh? What are you talking about? I did not!
Anyway, I deserve more love than he does.
I'm nicer and I don't bite.

Eiko:
I think that's pretty funny coming from Miss Conquest of Mankind herself.
Not even a hundred of you being nice would be as sweet as one Alex on this worst day.

Squid Girl:
I demand that you treat me with the same level of dignity as this very little creature!

Chizuru:
Really? The same level?

Squid Girl:
What the gill is this thing?

Chizuru:
It's a collar. Now you're on the same level as Alex.

Sanae:
Squiddie's so cute.

Chizuru:
Sit. Shake. Down.
Good girl! That's my Squiddie.

Squid Girl:
This is supposed to be equality but I feel like I'm being treated even worse than before.
This is for the gulls! I don't wanna be equal!

Chizuru:
Oh, pooh. That's no fun.

Eiko:
You were just messing with her, weren't you?

Sanae:
I feel jealous.

Eiko:
Huh?

Sanae:
No, never mind.



Sanae:
C'mon in.

Eiko:
Thanks for inviting us.
Are you sure you want me to bring her along?

Squid Girl:
Hey, that's a rude thing to say, you know!

Sanae:
She's right. You've come here to invade us, right, Squiddie?
Then I think it's important that you experience what it's like to be inside a human house.

Eiko:
Oh, Alex. What a good dog greeting us at the door like this.

Sanae:
She really is cute!

Eiko:
Huh?

Sanae:
Oh, Squiddie! You're great.

Eiko:
What? Oh, yeah? What's so great about her?

Sanae:
What do you mean "what"?
Everything is. Could this be... "love"?

Eiko:
No. It's more like really "weird."

Sanae:
Oh, I forgot.
It's time to take Alex up for his walk. Problem is I also have to watch the house.

Eiko:
I'll take him out if you want.

Sanae:
Really? Thanks, Eiko.

Sanae:
Make yourself at home, Squiddie.

Squid Girl:
How strange. Why does it feel so cool in here?

Sanae:
Because of the air conditioner.
It blows cold air in the house to keep it comfortable.

Squid Girl:
That's tentacular!
This coolness reminds me of home.
And it's so comfortable.
It's a bit inksular in here but it's a lot more pleasant than the Lemon beach house.
Maybe this house would be the perfect springboard for my inkvasion.
I better inkspect it a bit more first.
That's my name.

Sanae:
I thought maybe you could help me out with my collection.

Squid Girl:
I'm feeling like I'm the one who's being inkvaded.

Sanae:
Oh, wow, that's awesome, Squiddie!
You know, you're way too cute to be just working that silly part-time job.

Squid Girl:
Somehow that job doesn't seem so bad now.

Sanae:
I've got a lot more where that came from.

Eiko:
Sanae's alone so I'd better head back now.
Squid Girl's there too.
Sanae's in danger!
Sanae! Are you okay?

Sanae:
Oh, Eiko. You're back.

Eiko:
What's going on here?

Sanae:
Come over again soon.

Eiko:
S-Sure.

Sanae:
You too, Squiddie. I'll have even more ready for you next time.

Squid Girl:
I jet the feeling I won't enjoy another visit here.



Squid Girl:
Honestly, why do there seem to be so many weirdos around you?

Eiko:
You're one to talk!
