Chizuru:
Squid girl, I need you to take this to table four.

Squid Girl:
Okay.

Eiko:
We need more cola in the fridge.

Squid Girl:
I know. I'm on it!



Squid Girl:
I didn't come here to do this. I came to here to inkvade.

Squid Girl:
Must be my swimagination...
I feel somebody or something watching me...

Takeru:
These zigzag things are a lot of fun!

Squid Girl:
"Zigzag"? How dare you refer to my tentacles in that way?

Takeru:
Wow, look at it move! It's really weird!

Squid Girl:
He's treating me like a sucker.
I think it's time to teach him exactly how scary a squid can be.

Takeru:
Wow, that was great!

Squid Girl:
It backfired!?

Takeru:
Do it again! Do it again!
Again! Again!

Squid Girl:
Oh, wait. I know. I'll play with you if you agree to be my soldier.

Takeru:
Soldier?

Squid Girl:
Yes. That's right. I'm emissary of the sea, Squid Girl.
You have to refer to me as "captain".
And you have to respect my squid authority. You've got that?

Takeru:
That's an affirmative. Captain!

Squid Girl:
That sounds totally tentacular.

Squid Girl:
We're going to get right to work planning out our surface inkvasion of mankind.
Are you ready?

Takeru:
Yes, ma'am, Captain!

Squid Girl:
First on the agenda, we take over this place.

Takeru:
Yeah!

Squid Girl:
All right, then. Charge!

Takeru:
Right!

Eiko:
Squid Girl, what're you doing?

Squid Girl:
From now on, this place is mollusk territory.

Eiko:
Are you with her, Takeru?

Takeru:
That's right, Sis.

Squid Girl:
You mean, you're her little brother?

Takeru:
I serve under captain Squid Girl now, Sis.
We're gonna invade the surface together.

Eiko:
Oh, my own brother, huh?

Squid Girl:
It's just a game. We're just playing "inkvade."

Takeru:
But you said I was gonna be your soldier!

Squid Girl:
There's no way I'm gonna work with an silly image or human child.
I'm a very busy squid.

Takeru:
Hey, Squid Girlie!
She won't work with a human child...?
I've got it!

Eiko:
Umm, what are you doing?

Takeru:
Maybe this will make me look like Squid Boy.

Eiko:
Squid Boy?

Chizuru:
It's that thing Squid Girl wears.
That looks just enough like it that I can't tell the difference.

Eiko:
Yeah, well, it's so simple. I think a grade school kid could probably make it blindfolded.
This is her we're talking about.
Won't she just get mad and say "quit squidding around" or something?
Told you she'd get mad.

Squid Girl:
I never thought I'd see another squid up here!
You must have come here to try to inkvade the surface too, right?

Takeru:
Umm, you bet, your beak.

Eiko:
She doesn't realize that's Takeru?

Chizuru:
It could be that hat is all he needed for her to think he is one of her kind come from the sea, you know.

Squid Girl:
Now let's get right down to business and discuss inkvasion plans.

Takeru:
Squid power!

Squid Girl:
Right now, I've taken complete charge of doing clean up of that place's floor.
In other words, squids are taking charge from the ground up.
Next step, I'll be working on overthrowing all the tables and chairs.

Takeru:
She must be pretty happy to have somebody on her side.
But I'm not sure I really...

Squid Girl:
That's why your job is gonna be to get your tentacles on that counter as soon as you possibly can.

Takeru:
Sure, I'm, ah, your squid!

Squid Girl:
By the way, where are all your tentacles?

Takeru:
I've got to jet real quick, bye!

Chizuru:
Hey, what's the matter?

Takeru:
I, ah, I need some help.

Takeru:
Hi, Squid Girl. I'm back.

Squid Girl:
Oh, thank goodness. All your tentacles grew back!

Chizuru:
All right. She really bought it!

Eiko:
Is that a good thing?

Squid Girl:
But I think there's something wrong with them.
Your tentacles seem kinda scrawny and lifeless.

Takeru:
Oh, no. That's not true at all.

Squid Girl:
Well, it looks like they're pretty much just hanging there.
You don't have a gillness, do you?

Takeru:
I'll be back in a squid!

Squid Girl:
That's better. Now they're looking really lively.
We're gonna be just fine.
Right. Let's go ahead and get this squid on the load.

Takeru:
Right now?

Squid Girl:
That place is gonna be no much for our army of two!

Takeru:
Does she really think a plan that's simple would work?

Squid Girl:
Where are you going!?
I can't believe it...

Takeru:
She figured it out!

Squid Girl:
I can't believe I met a fellow squid and he just suddenly up and died like that!

Chizuru&Eiko&Takeru:
Huh!?

Takeru:
Hey, Squid Girlie?

Squid Girl:
What!? I'm not your captain and you don't work for me anymore!

Takeru:
She's treating me like a human again.

Squid Girl:
My fellow mollusk... 
At least you can now rest in peace in our home, the sea...

Eiko:
Hey, you know, you did everything you could.

Squid Girl:
Farewell, my squid brother!
