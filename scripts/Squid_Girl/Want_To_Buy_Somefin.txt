  Squid Girl:
The only thing these humans do is well is leave their kraken litter all over the place.
What the gill is this thing?



Squid Girl:
Nagisa!
Can you tell me what this is?

Nagisa:
I-I think it's a wallet.

Squid Girl:
What's a wallet?

Chizuru:
Squid Girl.
They located the owner of that wallet you found.
He left you a reward.

Squid Girl:
Ten thousand yen!? So what exactly can you buy with ten thousand yen?

Eiko:
You can buy all kinds of things with that much.
DVDs, CDs, video games.
And these days discount rates are on the high side.

Chizuru:
You have even more choices if you don't mind buying second hand.
You could end up paying ten percent off the list price.
I wonder what used blu-rays go for right now.
Oh, that was too much for her to process.

Eiko:
Squids can probably only rap their minds around a few hundred yen at a time.

Chizuru:
You don't have to spend it right away, you know.
You could wait until there's something you really want.

Squid Girl:
I want total authority!

Eiko:
Yeah, as if ten thousand yen could buy that.
Hey, wait a minute.
I bet you don't even know much about what kinds of things are sold up here on the surface.
Why not go on an excursion over to the shops. Take Nagisa.

Nagisa:
Me? Why me? I don't...

Eiko:
Because we're not busy right now.
Go on. It'll be fine.

Eiko:
Good. Maybe now they can learn to get along better.

Chizuru:
Is that why you sent them?

Eiko:
Yeah, of course. Why?

Chizuru:
I've figured you just thought it'd be amusing.

Eiko:
Gee, thanks.

Squid Girl:
So much stuff here!

Nagisa:
Yes, that there is...

Squid Girl:
Hey, what's over their?

Nagisa:
Maybe she's planning to steal our science and technology.
No! Not that.
I think electronics are way out of your price range.

Squid Girl:
Too bad. What's that?

Nagisa:
Maybe she's trying gathering intelligence for her surface invasion now.
Wait a minute. That stuff over there looks a lot more interesting than books.

Squid Girl:
Where exactly?

Nagisa:
Well, you see, I, ah, must have been imagining things.

Sanae:
It's Squiddie!
Who's she?
How dare she betray me with that girl!?
Wait.

Squid Girl:
I'm kraken buying this!
And this too. And this too, by squid!

Nagisa:
Something like this happened before.
Do you really like shrimp?

Squid Girl:
Well, no more than the next squid does.
I like shrimp just as inksanely and tentastically as anybody else and no more.

Nagisa:
I have no idea what that means.

Squid Girl:
Shrimp, shrimp, shrimp! Squid, squid!
Shrimp, shrimp, squid!
I love my shrimp!
Shrimp, shrimp! Squid, squid, squid!

Nagisa:
Are you sure you want to boil all ten thousand yen's worth at once?

Squid Girl:
It's beautiful, isn't it?

Eiko:
Out place stinks of shrimp.

Eiko:
Hey, wait!

Squid Girl:
What the gill was that for?

Eiko:
You need to learn to have a little more restraint.
You even ate all the shrimp off of Goro's fried rice the other day.

Squid Girl:
Well, he deserved it.
Those shrimp would've been wasted on that sucker.

Eiko:
Yeah. But what if one day you did that to some customer we don't know?
You need to learn to show a little discipline.

Squid Girl:
But... I want to eat them...

Eiko:
You're worse than Sanae's dog Alex.
Even he can wait at least an hour to eat.

Squid Girl:
Don't compare me to that mingy dog!
Good food is meant for the beak, not for the eyes.

Eiko:
Hey, c'mon!

Squid Girl:
What the squid...?
All she's doing is looking at me but I can't move my arm...

Chizuru:
Okay... when I give the signal you can eat.
Right now... is no longer the age of PM Yoshida.
Go ahead... and review information before a test.
You can... feel better after a shower.
Hey, this is really a lot of fun!

Eiko:
I think I would truly hate to be her pet.

Eiko:
I can't believe she ate every last one of those shrimp.

Squid Girl:
Yeah, It's a relief though because this is what I expected of her.

Eiko:
What? You mean her voracious appetite?

Chizuru:
Not that. How she spent her reward.

Eiko:
Well, she was definitely decisive about it at least.

Chizuru:
She could have made things infinitely easier on herself by putting her reward money
 toward fixing the hole in the wall she caused when she first arrived here.

Squid Girl:
Oh, kelp. There went the big one that gotta way.

Eiko:
You truly enjoy this, don't you, Sis?

Delivery man:
Hello there. I have delivery for you.

Nagisa:
Okay.

Delivery man:
Here.

Nagisa:
This delivery is for... Squid Girl?

Eiko:
It's huge!
It's from Sanae. What would she send her.

Squid Girl:
Oh, look. There's also a letter with it.

Sanae:
I thought that Squiddie might like this wonderful shrimp.
So I decided to mail her some.
There's plenty of it in the box. So enjoy!

Eiko:
But she just finished ton of it.
You're gonna eat it?

Squid Girl:
There's always room for more shrimp!

Eiko:
But this package is huge. How much do you think is inside there.
P.S. This is only meant for Squiddie's enjoyment.
Only for her enjoyment?

Squid Girl:
Shrimp, shrimp, shrimp. Squid, squid.

Eiko:
Still hungry?

Nagisa:
These people... are completely out of their minds.
