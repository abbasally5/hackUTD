  Nagisa:
Everybody I work with at the Lemon Beach House is so nice...except for one.
I'm Nagisa Saito, and I'm afraid of Squid Girl.

---

Nagisa:
I'll see you tomorrow!
I'm lucky that squid person wasn't here today.
Too bad it's not like this every day.

Eiko:
Hey, you have any plans tonight, Nagisa?
Wanna come eat at our place?

Nagisa:
Huh? Really, you mean it?

Eiko:
We haven't held a welcome party for you, and it's about time that we did.

Nagisa:
Well, the Squid Girl isn't around.
Thank you, I'd love to. Sounds like a lot of fun!

Eiko:
I'm home! And I brought Nagisa with me!

Chizuru:
Hi! Welcome!

Nagisa:
Thanks, Chizuru. I'm honored.

Chizuru:
Why don't you just wait in there until everything is ready.

Takeru:
Come on!

Squid Girl:
Waaaaaaah!
Ooooooooooooooooh...!

Nagisa:
I don't get it. What are you doing here?
Maybe this is where she....

Squid Girl:
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha! I know what you're thinking.
"What's that terrible inkvader doing here in this house?
She must be up to somefin really really bad!"

Nagisa:
How did you know all that!?

Takeru:
Isn't it great? Squid Girlie came over early to help us set everything up for your welcome party!

Nagisa:
Huh?

Squid Girl:
You didn't have to say that, Takeru.

Takeru:
I'm thirsty. I'm gonna go get some juice.

Nagisa:
So, uhmm, I guess that's the reason why you didn't come to work today.

Squid Girl:
That was just a cover story for all you suckers.
I've actually been inking through my master plan of attack.
It's coming along gilly nicely.

Nagisa:
What? You really have...a master plan of attack?

Squid Girl:
Yeah, I do. And I'm going to put it in the water right after you leave to go home.

Nagisa:
What terrible thing is she planning to do?

Squid Girl:
Beyond that, I'm not at liberty to say anymore.

Eiko:
Hey, guys. We're ready now.

Squid Girl:
That's good. I think I've waited long enough.

Nagisa:
Just look at that grin of hers.
She'll never fool me.

Eiko:
Here's to a successful future, Nagisa.

Eiko, Chizuru, Takeru:
Here, here!

Squid Girl:
Here, here!

Nagisa:
Thank you. I hope for the best, too.

Chizuru:
Feel free to eat as much as you want, okay?

Takeru:
You'll love Chizuru's croquettes! They're the best I've ever had.

Nagisa:
I've got to do something.
I can't let her destroy this happy family with her tentacles.

Eiko:
Hey, is everything okay? Why do you look so worried?

Squid Girl:
The little squid room's that way.

Nagisa:
Please! I want you to let me stay overnight.

Eiko:
Uh, tonight? But that's really short notice.
Well, I guess it's cool.

Nagisa:
I'll be their protector!

Good night, everyone.

Squid Girl:
Good night, squid dreams.

Nagisa:
What on earth is she planning?
I better stay awake and keep watch.
That was quick! No. This might be part of her plan.
I've got to remain alert.

It's been three hours now.
She's finally on the move.

I've gotta hurry and save her!
She's gaming....

Good morning....

Eiko:
Aww, didn't you sleep well?
I guess you couldn't relax enough to get a decent night's sleep with Squid Girl around.
You look like you're still pretty sleepy, too.

Squid Girl:
You're imagining that.

Nagisa:
Isn't it because you were gaming all night?

Eiko:
You were what!?
Didn't I tell you no late night video games!?

Squid Girl:
How did you know I was up playing!?
Nagisa! I can't believe it! How dare you blab my secret!
That's it! You can bet your beak you'll pay for this!

Eiko:
Nevermind about Nagisa, just get in the bathroom and wash your face!

Nagisa:
I wonder, why does she focus on me so much?

Squid Girl:
Nagisa here is MY prey!

Nagisa:
As far as I can tell, no one else around here is afraid of her.
In fact, they're really candid with her.
If this is how she does things, she wouldn't need me since I don't fit that mold.
Or maybe, because of that, she regards me as dangerous.
Then if she still pays this much attention to me...I must be her primary target!
It's all over if I get killed. I better pretend not to be scared for a while.

Squid Girl:
I'll tear you to pieces with my tentacles if you're lazy and don't work hard!

Eiko:
Quit it, Squid Girl!

Nagisa:
Aww, you can stop making bad jokes now, Ms. Squid Girl.

Eiko, Squid Girl:
M...M-Miss Squid Girl?

Eiko:
Uhmm, aren't you scared of her anymore, Nagisa?

Squid Girl:
You can't sucker me with your bluffing, you know.

Nagisa:
Oh, no, don't worry! I'm not bluffing at all.
I'm not scared of you anymore.

Eiko:
That's great! You were able to overcome it.
Now you two can finally get along.

Nagisa:
Looks like maybe I fooled her.

Eiko:
Hey, Squid Girl, hold on!

Nagisa isn't afraid of you anymore. Is it that shocking?
You know, there's nothing wrong with being an invader that everyone accepts.
You like Nagisa, don't you?
When somebody that you like avoids you, it makes you feel lonely, doesn't it?

Squid Girl:
Lonely? Maybe I am, a little.

Eiko:
Well, you can try to get along with her better, can't you?

Squid Girl:
Mm-hmm.

Eiko:
Then let's head back.

Squid Girl:
I was a bad squid to menace you all this time.
What do you say you and I try to be friends from now on?

Nagisa:
I'm sorry! I can't do it! I really am scared! Please forgive me! AAAAAHHH!!!

Squid Girl:
So what the gill am I supposed to do now?

Eiko:
Just do what you always do.
