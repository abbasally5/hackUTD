  Nagisa:
I love the sea!
I love waves!
And I really love surfing!
I'm Nagisa Saito!



Nagisa:
Good morning! Thank you for hiring me to work here.

Chizuru:
I'm Chizuru Aizawa.

Eiko:
Eiko Aizawa. Good to have you.

Nagisa:
Thanks.

Eiko:
I'm surprised you'd wanna work here instead of that convenience store when it's hotter and pays less.

Nagisa:
It's because I can surf when I'm not working.

Eiko:
So you like surfing, huh? I think it's a pretty cool skill to have.

Nagisa:
Oh, well, it's really no big deal.

Chizuru:
Have you seen Squid Girl anywhere?

Eiko:
Oh, right. Hey! Get over here and introduce yourself, Squid Girl.

Nagisa:
Who's Squid Girl?

Squid Girl:
I am Squid Girl, emissary of the sea!

Nagisa:
What is this creature? She isn't human!

Chizuru:
Oh my.

Eiko:
She's not ready for this.

Nagisa:
I'd better call the police right away.

Eiko:
Hold on a second.
She may not look it but she's absolutely harmless. Really, I promise!

Nagisa:
She looks dangerous in my opinion.

Eiko:
Well, she has been known to penetrate walls and snatch people up in the air with those.

Nagisa:
Well, that's even worse than I was thinking!

Squid Girl:
I can also vomit squid ink.
This is how I've been wanting to feel ever since I came up to the surface world.
This fear is the appropriate way to react to me, an emissary of the sea and inkvader of all mankind!

Eiko:
Cut it out!

Nagisa:
Umm, you two really aren't afraid of her at all, are you?

Chizuru:
Afraid?

Eiko:
I'll admit I was shocked when she smashed our wall with her tentacles.
But it made me more angry than anything else.
I still feel that way.

Chizuru:
You see her ink's so tasty we put up with her.

Nagisa:
You put it up in a bottle?
You two should be a little more sensitive to danger!
I think it's a serious thing that someone as dangerous as her is roaming around up here on land!
You're in for trouble if you underestimate her!

Eiko:
It sure looks like said dangerous creature's taken quite a liking to you.
Well, for what it's worth, my opinion is that you're being kind of paranoid about all this, Nagisa.

Nagisa:
How can you say that?

Eiko:
Once you work with her, you'll see.

Customers:
I'll have a beer!
Me, too!
You can make that three.

Squid Girl:
I need three draft beers, please.

Chizuru:
Okay.

Sanae:
My Squiddie.

Squid Girl:
Let go of me!
Here's the shrimp fried rice you ordered.

Goro:
Thanks.

Squid Girl:
Right. Enjoy your meal.

Goro:
Wait a minute. Why is this fried rice plain?

Squid Girl:
Whatever do you mean?

Goro:
You ate them, didn't you?

Squid Girl:
No, I did not!

Goro:
Then what's that by your mouth!?

Squid Girl:
These aren't toys, by squid!

Nagisa:
Something's wrong here. It's like I'm the only weirdo who's scared of her.
I see now! Nobody else here is normal enough to realize what she truly is!
I'm the only one!
If I don't do something, more and more people will begin to believe she's harmless.
But I don't wanna get involved with these people if I can help it!

Chizuru:
Nagisa?

Nagisa:
Yes?

Chizuru:
What do you think of the job?
If it's not working out for you, it's okay if you reconsider.

Nagisa:
That's right. I need to be decisive!
No! I'll keep working here!

Chizuru:
Yay!

Nagisa:
For the good of mankind!

Eiko:
Mankind?

Nagisa:
Somebody around here needs to have some common sense.

Eiko:
She's bizarre.

Chizuru:
She's so interesting.

Squid Girl:
She's tentacular!
This Nagisa human is just like a shooting star of hope that suddenly appeared in the heavens just for me!
If I can find more humans around here like her, the world will be mine before you can say squid!

Nagisa:
I still don't feel comfortable around her.

Eiko:
You'll get used to her soon enough.

Squid Girl:
That's true. Over time she might very well get used to me.
I better get kraken and pressure her so it doesn't happen.
Nagisa. I'm starting to think you're only afraid of me because I look different than all of you.
We've got problems it that's all it takes to scare the kelp out of you.
After all, the only reason I came up to the surface was to conquer the whole of mankind.

Nagisa:
Oh, no... That's just so horrible.

Squid Girl:
(Yes! This is the reaction I was squidding for!)
What you've seen is only the tip of the ice...

Eiko:
That's enough showing off.

Squid Girl:
Squid.

Eiko:
Nagisa, get this. A couple of day ago, she was so afraid of a blow-up killer whale, she cried.

Squid Girl:
Why the gill did you have to bring that up again!?

Eiko:
She even ended up fainting and that's why...

Squid Girl:
Enough already! Why don't you just jet back to work!
She looks like she's starting to have doubts about me.
It won't be long before she no longer believes I'm a dangerous inkvader.
I've got to come up with something to convince her.

Nagisa:
Hey, where are you going?

Squid Girl:
I need to think. I mean, get ready to inkvade.

Eiko:
Oh, right.

Chizuru:
See you later, then. You'll be careful out there.

Eiko:
I'm getting worried.
Looks like she's willing to do whatever it takes to scare Nagisa.

Chizuru:
It's the first time anybody's been afraid of her.

Eiko:
I guess I understand how she feels, I suppose.

Chizuru:
But we can't let Nagisa quit over this. We really need her help around here.
How can we make her less afraid? Oh, I know!

Eiko:
Nagisa.

Nagisa:
Yes?

Eiko:
Have you ever fished for squid?

Nagisa:
Ah, no. I can't say I have.

Eiko:
Hold onto this.

Nagisa:
Is this a... fishing rod?
Are we going down to the water to fish even though we're still working?

Eiko:
No, we can do it here. You are about to see something interesting.

Nagisa:
Squid fishing? In here?
Wait. Is she talking about the squid person?
She'd never fall for bait like that if she's here to conquer mankind.

Squid Girl:
I-I'm such a total sucker...

Eiko:
See? She's harmless.
She talks a big game but deep down, she's just an everyday squid who's not very bright.

Nagisa:
What the heck are you talking about?
I'll admit, maybe she acts kind of stupid sometimes.
But that doesn't change the fact that she has dangerous ideas!
Like this conquest of mankind and that she always has access to those powerful tentacles!
We should all be afraid of the Squid Girl!

Squid Girl:
She saw me totally disgrace myself and yet she still thinks I'm a squid worth fearing.
Nagisa might be the only one in this whole world who gilly understands me!
Nagisa! Thank you so, so much, Nagisa!

Nagisa:
Get off of me!

Eiko:
Hey!

Chizuru:
Are you all right?

Eiko:
Why are you laughing when she hates you?

Squid Girl:
Because things are just tentacular!
