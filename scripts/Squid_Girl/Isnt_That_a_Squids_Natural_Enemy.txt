  Squid Girl:
It's been a while since I swam to the surface.
Way back then, I actually thought I'd have mankind half-conquered by now.

Customer:
Where's that beer?

Eiko:
Yeah, it's on its way!

Squid Girl:
I mean, what the kelp am I doing here anysquid.

Eiko:
It's your own fault for breaking a hole in our wall.

Squid Girl:
That hole has been fixed for ages!

Eiko:
You've got to work enough to cover the repair bill.

Squid Girl:
How much longer gill it take?

Eiko:
Five or six years?

Squid Girl:
Exactly how little are you paying me anysquid!?

Takeru:
Eiko, can I borrow Squid Girlie for a little while?

Squid Girl:
"Borrow"?

Eiko:
Don't break her.

Squid Girl:
What the gill am I, a toy!?



Eiko:
Keep an eye on Takeru, okay? Make sure he doesn't drown.

Takeru:
You've got to have some fun once in a while!

Squid Girl:
But the repair bill...

Squid Girl:
Takeru!
Okay, this time I'm gonna swim out a little farther!

Takeru:
O-Okay...
You know, it's dangerous if you go too far out. Squid Girlie!
We're in a pretty deep area, Squid Girlie.

Squid Girl:
Says you. This is still kind of shallow by my standards.

Takeru:
Wait a minute, do your legs reach the bottom?

Squid Girl:
My tentacles do.

Takeru:
I think it's really cool that you can live both on land and in the ocean.
Living out here sounds like a lot of fun.

Squid Girl:
That's not always true.
It's a dangerous place even for an experienced squid like me.
(Squid!)
It's great when you're the one doing the eating, but one wrong move and...
(Squi-i-i-i-id!)
And you could end up the squid being eaten!

Takeru:
(Don't you think you should conquer your own oceans before you tackle humanity?)

Squid Girl:
But, they wouldn't be in shallows like this so there's no...
K-k-k-k-k-k-killer whale!

Takeru:
What's wrong?

Squid Girl:
What's my natural enemy doing in water this shallow!?
And there's even children riding on top of it!

Boy:
Heads up!

Squid Girl:
How come it let them treat it that roughly and not get angry?
They must have undergone a gilly strict training program.

Takeru:
Training?

Squid Girl:
Humans are more inkpressive than I thought.

Girl:
Silly!

Squid Girl:
What in the name of all that's wet...
There are all over the squidding place!
I'm in trouble...
Squid!
Let's get out of here before they attack!

Takeru:
They, who?

Squid Girl:
Swim for your life!

Goro:
I'm coming!

Chizuru:
Are you okay?

Takeru:
Yeah.

Goro:
I'm pretty sure he didn't swallow any water.

Eiko:
How could you let this happen?
Can't you even look after a little kid?

Chizuru:
Well, at least he's safe now.
Goro, thank you for saving him. I'm grateful.

Goro:
Well, I only did what any Life Saver would do!

Takeru:
Hey, could you teach me how to swim?
It's kinda stupid to live so close to the ocean and not know how to swim.

Eiko:
I guess you're right.
Could you teach him, Goro?

Goro:
I'm pretty busy so it'll have to wait.

Chizuru:
It'd be so helpful if you did this for us.

Goro:
Right! I'd be happy to!
All right! Let's go start training!

Takeru:
I'm ready!

Goro:
Follow me, Takeru!

Takeru:
Sure!

Eiko:
He is easy to read, isn't he?

Squid Girl:
You wait just a kraken minute!

Takeru:
Squid Girlie?

Squid Girl:
I'm the only one around this beachfront who knows how to jet away from them.
Leave this in my tentacles!

Goro:
Good. You stayed down pretty long. Well done, kid.

Squid Girl:
What do you mean? He didn't last a minute.
He couldn't even outswim a shrimp at that rate.

Goro:
It's okay. He's just starting out.

Squid Girl:
Just watch me. I'll show him how it's done.

Goro:
There you go. Relax your legs a bit more.

Squid Girl:
Hey! You gotta a lot of nerve ignoring me!

Goro:
What do you want from me?
Now, I want you to practice breathing in a 1-2-3 rhythm, all right?
You're making this difficult!

Squid Girl:
Look. Forget that lame swimming style.
I'll teach you a way of doing it that's a lot easier than what he wants you to do.

Takeru:
Yeah? Really?

Goro:
What way might that be?

Squid Girl:
First, you do this.

Takeru & Goro:
She's not using her arms or legs!

Squid Girl:
See? Easy as squid.
Not even they can keep up with you when you swim using that technique.

Goro:
You're nuts.

Takeru:
It doesn't teach me anything if you don't use your arms or legs.

Squid Girl:
But arms and legs are redundant.

Takeru:
Wait! That's crazy talk!

Goro:
Look. Humans can only swim using those redundant limbs.
It's not really impressive to see you swim with ten of those all-purpose tentacles when you've lived in the water so long.
If you wanna impress us, try swimming the way humans do!

Squid Girl:
That's an inkteresting idea.
I'll show you all what a squid can gilly do!

Goro:
This is pathetic.

Squid Girl:
Humans are the weird ones if you can swim without tentacles!
It's squidiculous to think that you belong in the ocean, you know!
Absolutely squidiculous!

Goro:
What the hell?

Squid Girl:
Yeah, I'll show you. Just you wait.
Oh, no, there they are again! This time there's even a shark!
Crocodile! What's a kraken crocodile doing in the ocean!?
I've never even seen one of those giant, yellow fish before!
I-I'm in squid hell!

Eiko:
Oh, great. What's she doing now?

Takeru:
Hmm. Oh, hey, I think I just figured it out!

Squid Girl:
I can jet back without them finding me if I swim underwater.
Nice idea if I do squid so.
I'm safe and sound now that I'm back up here on dry land.

Takeru:
Squid Girlie! Look what I just rented!

Squid Girl:
It's no fair if they can be on dry land too...

Takeru:
Huh? Didn't you wanna ride one?



Squid Girl:
They're just swimming aids!?
Why didn't you all just squid so in the first place!?

Takeru:
Sorry.

Eiko:
She's...not bright.
