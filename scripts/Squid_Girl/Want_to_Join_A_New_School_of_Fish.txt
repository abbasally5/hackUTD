  Eiko:
I'm ready.
Oh. Hey, Squid Girl.
Take care of the shop. I'll be back around noon.

Squid Girl:
So, where is it you're going in that cosplay getup?

Eiko:
This isn't cosplay.
I'm just wearing this uniform because today is a school day.

Squid Girl:
A school?
I wanna go with you!

Eiko:
Huh? No way are you going to school.
Do you know what would happen if you use those tentacles in a school full of people?
It'd be a lot worse than with Nagisa.

Squid Girl:
Would the humans fly into panic and run screaming for the gills?

Eiko:
Listen, you need to go and work hard to cover for me while I'm gone, okay?

Squid Girl:
It's not fair if you're the only squid who gets to have any fun!

Chizuru:
We have a lot of work to do today.

Eiko:
Be back later!

Chizuru:
See you.



Sanae:
So, you ended up leaving Squiddie at home?

Eiko:
Yeah. Of course I did. I can't look after her while I'm sitting here in class.

Sanae:
I even brought a brand new school uniform for her to wear.

Eiko:
So why is it you come to school again?

Girl:
Hi. Long time no see.

Eiko:
Morning.
I'm not about to let her come here and ruin things when I haven't seen everyone in so lo--
That little creep!

Sanae:
What's wrong, Eiko?

Eiko:
Whatever. I'll deal with it later.

Squid Girl:
I just realized they're all dressed exactly the same way.
What if this is some squid of a military base?
It was worth sneaking past Chizuru so I could do some recon.

Girl:
What the?

Squid Girl:
Wow. Look at all these fishy experiment tools.
This must be where they develop all their high-tech scientific weapons.
Exsquid me...
Th-They even do tests on living people...
This place is gilly scary.
Here's where they learn how to hack.
I guess this must be where they make field rations.
This is where they do all their training.
This is the war counsel room.
It's shut tight as a clam. Must be weapons.
This is where they care for all the casualties they sustain on the battle field.
This place is a lot better equipped than I expected.
I'd better stop underestimating these humans.
What's this place?
This room is gilly clean and spacious compare to the rest!
This is proof of victory.
They place the heads of their enemies on this thing.
From now on, I'm gonna be the top squid in charge around here.
All who oppose me will be summarily executed.

Principal:
Exactly who might you be?

Squid Girl:
Never mind that! Who the gill are you?

Principal:
As a matter of fact, I'm the school...

Squid Girl:
If you came in here without knocking, then you must be the leader of this fishility.

Principal:
I suppose that's one way you could put it.

Squid Girl:
Which means that if I defeat him, I'll become the top mollusk in charge around this place.

Principal:
Now, listen. You're not allowed to just walk in here.

Squid Girl:
There's nothing wrong with me walking in.
Because as of now this room and everything around it belongs to me.

Teacher:
All right, everyone. That's all for today. We'll continue tomorrow with...

Squid Girl:
Hear me, foolish humans!
My conquest of this fishility is complete!

Sanae:
It's Squiddie!

Eiko:
Damn it!

Squid Girl:
I'm taking over as the top squid in charge around here.
If you try to resist, your former leader will be as good as dead.

Principal:
Oh, my. This isn't good, is it?

Squid Girl:
Every one of you will become one of my elite soldiers who'll infiltrate the rest of mankind and take over the surface world in my name!

Sanae:
Isn't it wonderful? Squiddie is a leader of our school!

Eiko:
Hey.

Sanae:
And I'm gonna get to be her body guard!

Eiko:
Hey!

Squid Girl:
Once I succeed in taking over the entire surface world I...
once I take over... every squid and, uh... once I rule, inkvade, conquer, take over, subjugate...
Ah! I'll eat all the tasty shrimp I want every day!

Principal:
Shrimp?

Squid Girl:
You got it!
Tempura, deep fried, sashimi...
If you serve me I'll let you get your tentacles on a few of them too as long as you don't eat too many.

Principal:
No. I have a terrible shrimp allergy. So I can't eat crustaceans of any kind, you see.

Squid Girl:
If you can't eat any shrimp how are you able to get any true enjoyment out of life?
Now open your beak. Too good to eat my shrimp, are you?

Eiko:
Cut that out!
What a pain in the rear.
Please, you'll have to forgive her.

Principal:
I don't understand students anymore.

Squid Girl:
If all you do here is learn, then you should have just squid so in the first place.

Eiko:
Yeah, maybe. But you're the one who went way off the deep end.

Squid Girl:
Eiko, I want to try going to school too, okay?

Eiko:
You better start with grade school first.
