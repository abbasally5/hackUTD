  Takeru:
Done for the day.
Wow, we sure had a lot of customers today.

Chizuru:
Thanks for the hard work.

Eiko:
Why don't we head home?

Chizuru:
Okay.

Eiko:
You don't need to come with us.
Why do we have to go through this every night!?

Squid Girl:
Oh, c'mon, please! Where the gill do you go!?

Eiko:
I told you a million times, we go home.

Squid Girl:
Well, I'm going to go home with you this time!

Eiko:
No-you're-not!
Our home is the one place you're never allowed to go. Got it?

Squid Girl:
They think they're so smart but they're all suckers.
Now this place is once again my inkvasion base!
At least until morning. Let's see.
I think I'll squid some TV.

Announcer:
... on the east side of the ring is grand champion Kainomi and on the west side of the ring, it's...

Squid Girl:
Oh, no. What's the matter?
Are you suddenly feeling sick or something?
Oh, squid.
If you leave me tonight how am I supposed to make it all the way ungill morning without getting lonely and really bored!
I could work on the inkvasion.
Never mind that.
After all it's evening already.
Inkvasion business hours' inappropriate five o'clock everyday.
I'm getting gilly hungry.
Looks like they know I've been snacking at night.
Well, it'll take a lot more than these chains to crack this mollusk!
I'm sorry. I hope you understand.
But if I break these chains Chizuru might just break me.
But how can they ignore me like this, deny me food on night and gill back to their base by themselves and expect me to take it.
If that's how they wanna play it, well, I can play dirty pool just as well!
Now, let us begin tonight's festivities.
Time to play inkvasion!
Yes! Squid punch! She got me. 
Squid Girl is inkredible!
Yes! Now you know how powerful I am!

Takeru:
You know, right there!

Eiko:
He gotta be kidding!

Takeru:
Oh, oh, he started!

Eiko:
Will she make it? Will she make it? She made it!

Squid Girl:
Squid ink attack! Now!
I totally inkvaded Chizuru!
All right. Now it's Eiko's turn.



Chizuru:
Good morning, Squid Girl. We're here.

Takeru:
Good morning.

Eiko:
Thanks for watching the place over night.
These are for you.
Someone in our neighborhood gave them to us yesterday and they are pretty good.

Takeru:
We made sure to save some for you. So you could try them.

Eiko:
Squid Girl! I can't believe you did this.
What the hell did you do here last night!?
Where'd you run off to!?
Get back here! Get back here xxx ... or else...

Squid Girl:
Yeah, well, it's gonna take a lot more than a few berries to cajole me.

Eiko:
I can't believe you did this! Look at this place! It's a total...



Takeru:
Welcome home. I heated up the bath for you.

Eiko:
You'd make somebody a really good wife.

Squid Girl:
I would like to take a shower too.

Eiko:
Wait a minute! What are you doing here?
And a squid taking a shower? Is that supposed to be some kind of bad joke!?

Chizuru:
Well, the TV back at the shop is broken.
So I decided that she can stay here.

Eiko:
That isn't much of a reason.

Squid Girl:
A beach house with no TV can hardly be called an appropriate base of operation.

Eiko:
It was never your base to begin with!
She's going to be a big problem if we let her stay here.
I think it's a really bad idea.

Chizuru:
Don't you worry about it. Should anything happen while she's here, rest assured, I'll handle it personally.

Eiko:
I know but that's just one more thing to worry about.
Now, all right. It's just for one night.

Squid Girl:
Wow, this place looks gilly shabby, compare to the house that Sanae lives in.

Eiko:
I take it back! Get out of my house!

Everyone:
Thank you for the food.

Squid Girl:
You eat stuff that tastes this good everyday after work!? No fair!

Chizuru:
What a compliment.

Eiko:
What the heck have you been eating?

Chizuru:
Oh, look, how late it is.
Time to go to bed.

Squid Girl:
Huh?

Eiko:
Yeah, I'm beat.

Chizuru:
Good night, Squid Girl.

Takeru:
Good night, Squid Girlie.

Eiko:
You better get some sleep too.

Squid Girl:
But I'm not done squiding around! Being by myself is boring.
Hey, Takeru, rise and squid.

Takeru:
Sorry, I'm tired, Squid Girlie.
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

Squid Girl:
I thought Takeru at least would play with me.
Oh, well. I guess he's still just a little kid.
So this is Chizuru's room.
My inkstincts are telling me that I shouldn't open this door.
I guess waking Eiko is my only option if I want some company.
Hey, Eiko. Rise and squid.
Hello?
Fine then. I'll just lay myself down on the floor and sleep here too.

Eiko:
What the hell is going on here?
And what's Squid Girl doing sleeping up there in my bed!?

Squid Girl:
You're a big shrimp...

Eiko:
Huh?

Squid Girl:
Come here, shrimpy.

Eiko:
Are you talking in your sleep!?

Squid Girl:
Looks really squidilicious. xxx.

Eiko:
Hey, let me go!

Chizuru:
Good morning. Breakfast time.
Oh good. Looks like you two are getting along much better.

Eiko:
...watch, help me, would you!?

Squid Girl:
Now you're all mine!
