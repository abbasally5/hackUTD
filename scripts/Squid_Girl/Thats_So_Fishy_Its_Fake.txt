  Eiko:
Wow, this beach has a lot more people on it than ours ever does.

Squid Girl:
We wouldn't have known if we haven't come to do recon.

Eiko:
We should start by checking out some of the better known local food places.

Boys:
It's Squid Girl!
This is awesome!
Tentacles!
So wild!

Squid Girl:
Hey! Cut that out!

Eiko:
Wow. I'm awfully surprised that all these kids recognize her, considering it's a first time here.
What in the hell is that!?
It's not supposed to be Squid Girl.
The head's kind of [xxx she could try heart] of the outfit.
And why is the head so huge!?
Oh, I felt she'll be pissed when she sees this...

Squid Girl:
It can't be... It's another me over there.

Eiko:
... or maybe not.
Here. Take a closer look at her. She's obviously different, in lots of ways.

Fake Squid Girl:
Hello.

Eiko:
You see? It's artificial. I'll bet the tentacles don't even move.

Squid Girl:
They're moving.

Eiko:
That's pretty high-tech.

Fake Squid Girl:
Try pushing my nose.

Eiko:
You mean like this?
Oh! Some ink's coming out.

Owner of the Souther Beach House:
Ah, I crammed so much stuff in this thing.
The head ended up being oversized.

Eiko:
Uh, who are you, Mr.?

Owner of the Souther Beach House:
Me? I'm the owner of the Southern Winds Beach House.
I saw how popular the Squid Girl over your place was with all the kids.
So I made my own.
You got to admire the real deal.
What do you say?
I'm sure it's no coincidence we met.
Maybe you'd like to consider swapping your Squid Girl for this lovely one over here.

Eiko:
No thanks!

Owner of the Souther Beach House:
You stand something to gain from it.
Let's have a little competition.
We'll have them try to snatch each other's hats.

Eiko:
Yeah? And what if we win?

Owner of the Souther Beach House:
You get 10,000 yen.

Eiko:
You're on!

Owner of the Souther Beach House:
Begin!

Eiko:
Squid Girl, go show her what true tentacles can do!

Squid Girl:
If she loses her hat she'll die!
No, I just can't do it!

Owner of the Souther Beach House:
Now's our chance!

Eiko:
xxx! This just got really creepy!

Fake Squid Girl:
Oh, my! I can't see where I'm going!

Squid Girl:
Oh, my squid! My head came off! My head came off! My head came off! 

Eiko:
Calm down! That's not your head. That's hers.
That was traumatizing.

Owner of the Souther Beach House:
This little situation calls for a rematch.

Eiko:
You still haven't given up?

Owner of the Souther Beach House:
We'll hold our second match on your home turf.

Eiko:
Huh? Are you serious about this? What about your Squid Girl?

Owner of the Souther Beach House:
She'll be right along.



Eiko:
Are you trying to pick a fight here!?

Owner of the Souther Beach House:
This is the real version.

Eiko:
What's the point of making a real version that looks like that!?
Look! Squid Girl's reputation is bad enough around here without you coming in and making it worse.

Squid Girl:
Bad enough!? What's that supposed to mean!?

Owner of the Souther Beach House:
Don't you worry. The other one was a prototype.
This is the new and improved model.

Eiko:
Improved model? Then why does that look so unfortunate?
I mean, what's wrong with her wearing just a wig and a squid hat?

Owner of the Souther Beach House:
Huh? That would just make it silly cosplay.

Eiko:
Exactly what are you trying to accomplish here?

Owner of the Souther Beach House:
Just check it out. The Squid Girl from before is the type that's popular with kids.
This is the type that gets a lot of work done.

Eiko:
Good intentions don't make it good.

Owner of the Souther Beach House:
All right, then. Let's forget about snatching squid hats.
And you just take a gander at what my Squid Girl can do.
Then if you think mine's a superior worker you'll let me borrow yours for a little while.

Eiko:
So, what do you think, Sis?

Squid Girl:
Hey! Does my opinion even mean squid around here?

Chizuru:
It sounds like fun. So it's fine by me.

Eiko:
Then you can feel free to just hang out, Squid Girl.

Squid Girl:
Am I just supposed to be gladius about all this?

Chizuru:
Nagisa, this girl's going to work in Squid Girl's place for a little while today.

Fake Squid Girl:
Nice to make your squidquaintance, Nagisa.

Nagisa:
Yeah, sure... Same here, I suppose.

Fake Squid Girl:
Squid you for your patience, Sir.

Nagisa:
You know, um, I hate to say this but... this might be bad for business.

Eiko:
But I gotta say our Squid Girl is a lot more efficient. Since she can move her tentacles at will.

Owner of the Souther Beach House:
You really haven't seen what my Squid Girl can truly do. Now for the kitchen!

Eiko:
She's quick!

Fake Squid Girl:
It's ready.

Eiko:
Why do all the sauces and seasoning have to come out of her face!?
What the heck are you trying to do?

Owner of the Souther Beach House:
One of the big advantages we have over you is a much bigger menu.
We can fix just about any dish that customer asks for.
For example, if you wanted barbecue!

Squid Girl:
I inkspire fear even in myself.

Eiko:
I keep trying to tell you she's not you!

Fake Squid Girl:
Um, hang on, the fire won't stop.

Eiko:
Get some water!

Fake Squid Girl:
I can't do this...

Customer:
She's so cute.

Fake Squid Girl:
I'm sorry. This turned out badly.

Eiko:
What were you trying to burn us down?

Owner of the Souther Beach House:
Sorry, kid. Everybody makes mistakes.

Eiko:
I meant you, not her!

Owner of the Souther Beach House:
We'll be back.

Eiko:
Yeah? Don't bother!

Customers:
Who was that gorgeous girl?
Does she work here?

Eiko:
I guess I should have had her stick around for a while without the mask.
