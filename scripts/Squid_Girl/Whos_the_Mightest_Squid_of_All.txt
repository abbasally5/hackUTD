  Chizuru:
Boy, the shop sure is quiet when it rains.

Eiko:
What's wrong?

Squid Girl:
Who's that woman standing right over there with the gilly long hair?

Eiko:
Huh? She's been here the whole time.

Squid Girl:
Of course she has! I know that!
What I'm trying to ask you is if she's related to you and your brother somehow.

Eiko:
What? You mean, you haven't noticed? She's our big sister. Her name's Chizuru.

Squid Girl:
Your sister? You're as different as squids and whales!
You're violent and mean and your little brother is pretty much just an annoying tag-along.
But your sister isn't violent or annoying.
And she looks like she's a gilly good person.

Eiko:
Well, excuse me for being violent!

Chizuru:
C'mon now, Eiko. Relax, okay?
You shouldn't be picking on Squid Girl.

Squid Girl:
She's so kind!

Chizuru:
Squid Girl, would you mind holding onto this for me for a minute?

Squid Girl:
I'd be glad to!
A-A-A-Atchoo!
I'm sorry. It's a little chilly today.

Eiko:
What is all that you just coughed up?

Squid Girl:
Why are you freaking out like that?
All I did was spit squid ink.

Eiko:
Oh, I thought you were coughing up blood! Hurry! Wipe it off!

Chizuru:
Hey, it's true. It is squid ink.

Eiko:
This doesn't bother you? You even licked it.

Chizuru:
I gotta hand it to you. You really are squid-like, Squid Girl.

Eiko:
What do you mean, "squid-like"?
You better go take a shower. You smell like ink.

Chizuru:
Yeah. Good idea. You two keep an eye on the shop for me?

Squid Girl:
I'd be in deep squid if that was you.

Eiko:
Yeah, you got that right.
I'm not going to be able to even go near squiddy spaghetti for a while thanks to you.

Squid Girl:
Are you serious? Squid ink spaghetti?
Are you trying to tell me that humans really eat this stuff?

Eiko:
Stop hacking it up in front of me, would you?
That's right. We eat it with spaghetti and rice along with fresh squid meat.

Squid Girl:
Meat!? Are you going to eat me?

Eiko:
Who'd eat you!?

Squid Girl:
Maybe not you but some other customer might...

Squid Girl:
There aren't any humans around.

Eiko:
That's because it's raining.

Squid Girl:
So, wait. Do humans go away when it rains?

Eiko:
Yeah, well, you'd have to be pretty weird to wanna have fun in this weather.

Squid Girl:
That means, the only suckers around here right now are quiet, black-haired Chizuru.
And that annoying little Takeru. And this one here. She's only a squiddle strong.
It's the perfect time.
Eat them before they eat you. This is my chance to take over this place.
Today is the day, the day I beat the squid out of them!

Eiko:
Well, I guess I might as well do some cleaning while it's slow.
C'mon, I want you to help me out, Squid Girl.

Squid Girl:
Not a chance.

Eiko:
Huh? Do you realize the tenuous position you're in right now?

Squid Girl:
You took the words right out of my beak.
Yeah, you act all high and mighty for a human.
Why do you think I'm here on the surface in the squid place?
Why do you think I chose this shop?

Eiko:
Because you wanted a job?

Squid Girl:
It's the conquer, humanity!
First I need a base of operations and that means taking this place.
And right now you're standing in my way, sucker!

Eiko:
Hey, what's the big idea? Put me down!

Squid Girl:
You know, you should really watch that beak of yours when you speak to me.
One quick twist of my tentacles and you'll be-

Takeru:
What are you doing to her?

Eiko:
Takeru, run for it!

Takeru:
Not fair! How come you get to have all the fun?
I wanna play with Squid Girl too.

Eiko:
Is that what you're thinking when you watch disaster movies?

Squid Girl:
Don't you worry. I wasn't going to leave you out of this.
There's just one more fish to catch.

Eiko:
[You're] going after Chizuru?

Squid Girl:
Don't even try to stop me. I'm kraken serious today!

Eiko:
No. Listen to me. I really think you better let us go for your own sake, okay?

Squid Girl:
And I don't think you're in any position to squid like that[, do you?]

Eiko:
Hey, I said it's for your sake, Squid Girl, not ours.

Chizuru:
Hey, guys. What's going on?

Squid Girl:
There you are, sucker. This is where you let me catch you like a fish.
And then I happily hang the three of you out to dry.

Chizuru:
We'll have none of that inside our shop. Got it?

Squid Girl:
Y-Y-Yes...

Chizuru:
I'm glad you understand.
Now I think you owe them an apology.

Squid Girl:
I'm gilly sorry.

Eiko:
That's okay.

Takeru:
I had fun!

Eiko:
Anyway, I tried to warn you, remember?

Chizuru:
By the way, Squid Girl?

Eiko:
What did you make that pasta for?

Chizuru:
Please put ink on this.

Eiko:
Wait a minute, you mean her ink?

Chizuru:
Sure.

Eiko:
You've got to be kidding!

Chizuru:
How come?
It is squid ink, isn't it?
You know, like when you sprayed me with it.

Squid Girl:
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm gilly sorry!

Chizuru:
You don't understand. I tried some and it tasted perfect for spaghetti.
Would you mind covering this in ink, Squid Girl?

Squid Girl:
Okay, I can put any amount of ink on that you want.

Chizuru:
There. It's all ready.

Takeru:
Hey, can I have some too, big sis?

Chizuru:
Here. You try some, Eiko.

Eiko:
I saw her puke it out. How could I-

Chizuru:
It'd be rude not to try some.

Eiko:
It's really good.

Customers:
This is good.
I just love the taste of salty squid ink right after a swim.
Squid ink spaghetti, please.
I'll take an order that's spaghetti two.
Squid ink spaghetti for me.
Two squid ink spaghetti, please.
Squid ink spaghetti!
I'll take one order to go, please.
Squid ink!

Chizuru:
Wow, it's really popular.

Takeru:
Sure is.

Eiko:
Like they say "Ignorance is bliss."
Hey, we got four more orders.

Squid Girl:
I'm just about out of ink and I can't let them keep squidsploiting me like this!

Chizuru:
C'mon, Squid Girl. You got to keep it up.
We have customers waiting for orders.

Squid Girl:
Right! On your squid!

Eiko:
Looks like she's finally figured out who the scariest one here is.
