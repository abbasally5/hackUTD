  Narrator:
Ladies and Gentleman, I'd like you to take one more look.
Now, do you see it? It's right there.
What should have been a fun summer memory suddenly becomes a bone-chilling terror thanks to this mysterious phantom.

Takeru:
C'mon, Sis. Let's watch something else.
I'll be just too scared to go to the bath room alone.

Eiko:
But summer's the best time to watch all these ghost specials.
It always seems to make it scarier.

Squid Girl:
I don't get it. What's a ghost?

Takeru:
The spirit of a dead person who can't rest in peace and wanders around the earth, haunting everyone.
You usually can't see them.

Squid Girl:
I don't get what's so scary about something you usually can't see.

Takeru:
It's scary because it's invisible.

Squid Girl:
That's pretty unscientific.

Eiko:
You're one to talk!

Takeru:
What about that picture?

Narrator:
He almost seems to be saying...

Squid Girl:
They just composited his picture on top of it.

Eiko:
Well, I suppose some of them are like that but...

Squid Girl:
It's all in your swimagination.
I'm no sucker. I'll believe it when I see it.

Eiko:
Now I'm feeling the urge to show Squid Girl a real ghost so it'll scare the heck out of her.



Eiko:
All right, now. We're gonna test our courage!

Sanae & Takeru:
Yeah!

Squid Girl:
Why do I need to be here?

Eiko:
Because it's a fun Japanese tradition. That's why.

Goro:
And why am I here?

Eiko:
You're a bodyguard.

Goro:
I thought Chizuru was going out to be here too.

Eiko:
Oh, she said something came up and had to beg out...
At least I think...

Goro:
Huh?

Sanae:
Don't worry! I'll protect you if anything happens, Squiddie. I promise!

Squid Girl:
Sanae! I'm so squidding scared!

Sanae:
You're safe now, Squiddie.

Eiko & Sanae:
She's not scared at all!

Goro:
This place gives me the creeps.
Can we get outta here?

Eiko:
You can't get scared. We need our bodyguard to be brave and dependable.

Goro:
Well, nobody mentioned any inhuman threats!
And Chizuru's not here...

Eiko:
Oh, there she is.

Goro:
Bring it on! Dead guys!

Eiko:
Oops, she's actually the ghost of some dead soldier.

Goro:
Ahhhhhh!!! Stop doing that!



Squid Girl:
So, when does this supposed fun start, anysquid?

Sanae:
I'm not sure if fun is really the right word...
Aren't you scared at all, Squiddie?

Squid Girl:
Of what? It's just as dark as ink out here.
What's so squiddly scary about that?

Sanae:
This is a graveyard. It's the place where we bury people after they're dead.

Squid Girl:
Oh, please. Shark and killer whales are a lot scarier than dead humans.
You're one funny school of fish.

Eiko:
This isn't working the way I thought it would.

Goro:
All right, then. Why don't we just go?

Sanae:
No! I'm not leaving this place until it happens!

Eiko:
Fine. All right.

Sanae:
It's no surprise this isn't enough to scare her.
So, I'll just have to set things in motions!

Goro:
Aghaaaa!!!

Eiko:
Would you stop shouting like that?

Goro:
Hey, you just threw a rock!
Cut that out!

Sanae:
[What!?] You cut it out! You're ruining my plan! Chicken Life Saver!

Goro:
What did you just call me!?

Sanae:
A chicken!

Eiko:
[xxx]. Give me a break.
Hey, wait. Where's Squid Girl?

Goro:
Good question.

Sanae:
Maybe she went on ahead?

Squid Girl:
Where'd they all swim off to?
But I don't know the way back by myself.
Okay then. Time to shed some light on this.

Narrator:
Squid Girl possesses the power of the firefly squid.

Squid Girl:
There. Now they can see me from a mollusk away.

Takeru:
Hey! Squid Girlie!

Sanae:
I'm worried. I don't see her anywhere.

Eiko:
What could she be doing?

Goro:
I'm sure she just left and went home. We should leave too.

Sanae:
Hey, what's that?

Squid Girl:
Oh, there they are.

Takeru:
What is it?

Sanae:
Oh, no.
It's coming this way!

Goro:
It's somebody's ghost!

Eiko:
[xxx]!

Squid Girl:
Huh?

Takeru:
Somebody help!

Squid Girl:
Hey, why the squid are you running away?

Goro:
Keep run away! It's one of Genji's soldiers!

Sanae:
Noooo!

Squid Girl:
Wait for me!
Why are they running? Maybe they don't know I'm here.
I'll show them.

Takeru:
Now it's flashing!

Eiko:
And is flying!

Squid Girl:
They'll have to notice me now that I'm flashing.

Goro:
It's Genji firefly's cursed beam! It's trying to curse us!

Squid Girl:
Humans are so heartless sometimes.
I can't jet back to the sea by myself...
What do all of you want?
I really don't have time to squid with you now.
Huh?
I can't even understand what you're saying!
Why don't you all beak up!?
Hey, let go of me! Wait. Where are you taking me!? Hey!
Get your tentacles off me already!
I know where I am!
Were you just trying to show me the way back to the sea or somefin?
Sometimes, the humans you run into are nice.



Squid Girl:
I can't believe you kraken left me there! That wasn't nice!

Eiko:
Sorry about that. But... we were a bit distracted at the time.

Sanae:
I tried taking a picture of it.
What do you make of this?

Takeru:
I say it has to be a ghost.

Goro:
We should hold a memorial service just in case.

Chizuru:
Yeah...

Eiko:
We shouldn't have taken the picture of it.

Squid Girl:
You'd have to be a sucker to believe in stuff like ghosts.
