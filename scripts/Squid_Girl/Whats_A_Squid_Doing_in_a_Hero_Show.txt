  Squid Girl:
Huh? What are they all squiding around here for?

Takeru:
Hey, Squid Girlie. A hero show's about to start.

Squid Girl:
Huh? What's a squid doing in a hero show?

Announcer lady:
Hi, everybody. Welcome to the big show!

Children:
Hi!

Squid Girl:
What the gill?

Announcer lady:
It's nearly time. Our hero show is just about to get started!
Right!

Announcer lady:
All right. Before we begin, let's all call out a hero's name, loud and clear!
One, two, Noh Mask Rider!
No! Looks like we're being invaded by the Black Tights Army.

Squid Girl:
Humans are such hatchlings if something this squidiculous is all it takes to captivate their minds.

Announcer lady:
Ah! There're so many. I think the reason that they showed up here is because when we called a hero's name we didn't all shout loud enough.
Let's do it again and put more spirits in it.
One, two, Noh Mask Rider!

Nor Mask Rider:
One expression fits all my emotions.
One expression to save the world!
I am Noh Mask Rider!

Squid Girl:
Hahahaha. What a gilly fishy hero!
She's just wearing a mask.

Devilsquid:
That's far enough, Noh Mask Rider!
Squid-squid-squid.
My name is Devilsquid.

Squid Girl:
Hahahaha. It's so funny it hurts!

Devilsquid:
You human have been polluting the sea and now I'm going to punish you all.

Nor Mask Rider:
I will never let that happen! Not as long as I have breath in my lungs, Devilsquid!

Devilsquid:
Oh really? We'll see how big you talk once I'm through with you.
Here I come!
Squid-squid-squid. Squid-squid-squid.

Announcer lady:
Oh my goodness! Noh Mask Rider's in big trouble!
Everyone needs to cheer as long as you can for her!

Children:
Don't get that silly! Get him!

Takeru:
Hey, c'mon, you better cheer too, Squid Girlie.

Squid Girl:
Kick that sucker's butts, Devilsquid! Fight to win!

Children:
Hey, you see that? Squid Girl is cheering for Devilsquid.
But the announcer lady said that we're supposed to root for Noh Mask Rider. Shouldn't we do that?
Well, Devil squid's not so bad.
Come to think of it, Noh Mask Rider is not all that cool.
Hey, c'mon, let's all just cheer with her.
One-two.
Win the fight, Devilsquid!

Nor Mask Rider:
What?
Now what? This is really awkward.

Devilsquid:
I'm afraid this gonna turn into a riot if Devilsquid loses the fight.

Nor Mask Rider:
Can't you say something up for us?

Announcer lady:
I don't know but I'll see what I can do.
The fight between Noh Mask Rider and Devilsquid continues to rage on.
The question is that who will be victorious!
Find out in ten minutes!

Nor Mask Rider:
This sucks. I never thought things would go this way.

Devilsquid:
Maybe we should have chosen a different monster for this show.
Or maybe it's just that the kids who live around here are mutant freaks and odd balls.
I don't know. I mean, do you think maybe these kids would be happier if we let Devilsquid win this time around?

Nor Mask Rider:
We'll get in big trouble if we go and change that.
Then again, it might turn out to be a pretty bad day if I beat Devilsquid with this crowd.
What if Devilsquid were to evolve into Deviloctopus?

Devilsquid:
Devilsquid's the only costume we brought.

Announcer lady:
I got it.
How about we play it like they just talked it over and reached a compromise?

Devilsquid:
That's good.

Nor Mask Rider:
That sounds like a painless way to get out of this!
I sure think it's worth us to try!

Devilsquid:
Where'd the Devilsquid's costume go?

Squid Girl:
Squid! Squid-squid-squid.
Who's that?
And what are all those blue things?
Squid-squid-squid.
I won't let have a squid lose just because some squidiculous grown-ups want him to.
Devilsquid is the one who should triumph over all in this fight.
Squid! Squid-squid-squid.

Nor Mask Rider:
First thing we need to do is get that suit back!
All right. C'mon Devilsquid. Let's do this!

Squid Girl:
I don't have to listen to you, you sea slug!

Children:
Kick some butt, Devilsquid!

Squid Girl:
I never knew how good I could feel when a crowd is on your side and cheers for you.
You're a dead squid, Noh Mask Rider!
Take this! Tentacle attack!

Hannya:
That's far enough, Devilsquid!

Squid Girl:
Who's the gill are you?

Hannya:
I bring the curse of death upon evil. The only emotions I express are rage and anger.
I am Noh Mask Rider Hannya!
HN for short.

Squid Girl:
Squid.

Children:
She say Hannya?
I think she said HN.
I wonder what that's all about.

Devilsquid:
Who's she?
Oh, this is out of control.

Announcer lady:
Yeah, well, who even cares at this point?

Hannya:
All right. I'll set him up and you finish him up. Got it?

Nor Mask Rider:
Ah, sure.

Squid Girl:
Who cares if there's two of you. You're little fish in a big ocean.
I use my powers to beat the ink out of both of you.
You suckers!

Hannya:
Now, go for it!

Squid Girl:
She sounds familiar.

Nor Mask Rider:
Noh Mask Rider Diving Cross Chop!

Squid Girl:
Squid...

Nor Mask Rider:
We won...

Children:
Wow!
Noh Mask Rider is really cool!
Yeah! She is the best!



Narrator:
She fights for justice and crushes evil.
One expression fits all her emotions.
Her name is Noh Mask Rider!

Squid Girl:
I don't get it. Hannya didn't show up.

Takeru:
There's no character like that in Noh Mask Rider.

Squid Girl:
But didn't we just see her today?

Takeru:
Maybe she only shows up at hero shows.

Squid Girl:
Huh?
