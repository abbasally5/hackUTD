Tachikoma: Comrades!
It's sudden news, but they've decided to make a sequel to Tachikomatic Days!

Tachikomas: Huh?

Tachikoma: Sequel? What're you talking about?

Tachikoma: Yeah, that's right.
They announced that they were gonna go with "CEO Jameson Strikes Back".

Tachikoma: I hear you, friend.
Geez, what a pain.

Tachikoma: Silly Tachikoma!
Who would wanna see anything other than us in action? I mean, come on!

Tachikoma: Do you even have any stories to share?

Tachikoma: You brought it up, you do the work.

Tachikoma: Um, well, that’s where I wanna start.
I'd like to build a story with you guys right now.

Tachikoma: Oh, I wish they'd shut up...

Tachikoma: Nobody xxx xxx nothing go on. (distant voice)

Tachikoma: No one xxx.

Tachikoma: What? But for us, it's all for one, one for all!

Tachikoma: Huh? ...Gweegh!!

Tachikoma: What happened just now?

Tachikoma: We didn't fall asleep, did we?

Tachikomas: Nah, couldn't have.

Tachikoma: Which means that...
Wait, don't tell me that that one...

Tachikoma: Maybe we should put some distance between us [and it].

Tachikoma: Yeah.

Tachikoma: Ah!? I- I stepped on something!

Tachikoma: Hey, stop! Don't move!

Tachikoma: What is this thing? Some kind of switch?

Tachikoma: "Reset the World"?

Tachikoma: Gee, being a decoy sure is tough work.

Tachikoma: I really wanted to fire my main gun.

Tachikoma: A grenade would've been useless with its low initial velocity.

Tachikomas: Phew...

Tachikoma: Foolish Tachikomas!
We're tanks! Tanks!
What about that!? Why don't you dummies understand!?
I mean, what's the big idea that cutting loose with your main guns the way a tank should!?

Tachikoma: We've never hit the target.

Tachikoma: Wouldn't have had any effect.

Tachikoma: Yeah, what's the point?

Tachikoma: Silence! xxx tanks are far superior to advanced weaponry!

Tachikoma: Even so, the muzzle energy needed for something like that has got to be enormous.

Tachikoma: Come on, we don't have space for barrel reinforcement devices.

Tachikoma: We can’t boost the maximum pressurization limit?

Tachikoma: No way, not without an effective blocker mechanism.

Tachikoma: In that case, I guess we could always use shaped fragmentation shells.

Tachikoma: We’d probably be better off firing armor piercing rounds!

Tachikomas: Yeah!

Aaah!

Tachikoma: I guess he gave us the slip.

Tachikoma: Yeah.

Tachikoma: Hey there, you two!
Now, this is what I call what pathetic sight!
Don't you feel ashamed and embarrassed as AI's, letting a full-body cyborg like that get away from you?
You need a lesson in how to fight a humanoid opponent, so watch closely, and I'm gonna show you how it's done!
Click it.

Ring announcement: Ready... Fight!

Tachikomas: You can do it! You can do it!/ Go for it! Go for it!

Tachikoma: Wait a minute! When I said "humanoid," this isn't at all what I meant!
I-I wanna request something that's human-sized!

Tachikoma: It's starting! Good luck! Remember, you got what it takes!

Tachikoma: There comes a time when an AI's gotta fight, even though he knows he's gonna die...
I think...
Aah! Forget this! Aaaagh!

Tachikoma: Get back in there!
Don't forget your tank warrior spirit!

That's strange. I'm crying for some reason... Wow!

Tachikoma: Now, then. I'd like to talk about the amphibious mer-Tachikoma that played such a major role in the offense against the Individual 11!

Tachikoma: Huh? You mean there was one of those?

Tachikoma: And away we go!
Instead of tires, propellers are now attached.
Therefore, our top speed depends on how much effort we put into it.

Tachikoma: Propellers? But it doesn't have a rudder.

Tachikoma: And in addition to the usual weapons, two torpedo launch tubes have been added.

Tachikoma: Wait a second. Doesn’t our oil go in those?

Tachikoma: Terrorists won't stand a chance against these.

Tachikoma: We won't be able to walk straight on those propellers, so they'd be useless on land!

Tachikoma: Hey, it's half Tachikoma and half fish, it's expected that it can only move halfway decently on land and in the water.

Tachikoma: This one’s hopeless...

Tachikoma: Comrades! These times we live in could be best described as an age of food!
Which leads in to our topic for today, Machine Oil.
Let's use our keen sensors to guess which is Mr. Batou's natural oil!

Tachikomas: Yay!

Tachikoma: Guess correctly, and the lucky winner will get a year's supply of oil!

Tachikomas: Wow!

Tachikoma: Guess incorrectly, and there will be a penalty, of course.

Tachikomas: Awww!

Tachikoma: Here goes Tachikoma No. 1!
Gulp, gulp! Gulp! Gulp! Gulp! Gulp! Uh...

Tachikoma: Okay, this time out, I'd like for us AI's to lend a helping hand to Mr. Togusa, because he's such a lousy shot!

Tachikomas: Woo-hoo!

Tachikoma: It works like this.
We'll make use of an agent’s ballistics program and incorperate our precise fire-control software into the shells that Mr. Togusa fires.
What do you think of this accuracy rate?
If he let us handle things, becoming a super-class A sniper wouldn't be out of his reach.

Tachikomas: Mm-hm, mm-hm.

Tachikoma: Without further ado, I'll show you how it's done.

Tachikomas: Huh? How it's done?

Tachikoma: Okay, let me demonstrate.

Will the world that spread out before the Tachikoma be the pure land of ultimate bliss or the hell of pandemonium?
What will be the outcome of this final showdown with the Arm Suit?

Tachikoma: How much faster this makes them is gonna dependent on us.

This will let them turn that camouflaged ship into Swiss cheese.

Tachikoma: Excuse me, but don't you mean, turn itself into Swiss cheese?
