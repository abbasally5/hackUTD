Tachikoma: Are you watching? Are you watching?

Tachikomas: Hi!/ Hi!/ How are you?

Tachikoma: Fellow Tachikomas!
Verbalization! Verbalization comes from words, right?
But we're always using data links!
Don't you feel the need to express yourself with words every once in a while? With oral communication!

Tachikoma: Hey, what's with all the babbling?

Tachikoma: Beats me.

Tachikoma: A-A-Achoo!

Tachikoma: With the data link, you instantly comprehend everything through simple visualization, so why use such a primitive method?

Tachikoma: Why, indeed? It makes no sense.
After all, the faster the data transfer, the better.
In my opinion, that kind of archaic protocol should be abolished for everyone, humans included.

Tachikoma: I agree!

Tachikoma: Yeah, yeah!

Tachikoma: What kind of oil are you guys on! None of you know what you're saying.
Just stop for one minute and consider why we're equipped with high-performance linguistic drivers and voice synthesizers that enable to make full use of those drivers!

Tachikoma: From a data standpoint, words are completely obsolete.
They clearly have too many shortcomings regardless of whether they're written or spoken.

Tachikoma: But maybe the most dangerous thing is the firmly-rooted notion that words are actually a data transfer tool.

Tachikoma: Maybe they're not tools.
Maybe they serve some other purpose that we still haven't figured out yet

Tachikoma: ZZZ... ZZZ...

Tachikoma: Wha...!?

Tachikoma: Perhaps the Major tells us not to chatter 'cause she doesn't want us to find out what that is.

Tachikomas: Ah...

Tachikoma: Help me!

Tachikoma: I'm back!
Listen, listen!
Huh? Isn't anybody here?
Hm? Oh!?
Let's see here...
"While you were gone, we were all ordered out on a call by the Major.
The destination is a secret.
Furthermore, in order to utilize words in a positive manner, we wrote you these notes."
Ah!
Darn it! They don't understand the point of word use in the least!
This is exactly the sort of information that ought to be relayed electronically, why did they waste time writing a long note just to tell me that?
The significance of words isn't their superficial ability to convey facts, but rather to structure the self-programming quality that's inherent in language itself! They don't get it!
Take, that, you, stupid!
Huh?
You know, I've been noticing some strange tremors.
I wonder, could it be an error in my control system?
Maybe that's what's causing my anger circuit to be stimulated.
My self-diagnostic program indicates that nothing is... Huh?

Tachikoma: Ah! Ah! Ah!

Tachikoma: Who's that!?

Tachikoma: Aaah!!
Good grief! What the heck is going on around here?

Tachikomas: Look up! Look up!/ Up! Up!/ Watch out!

Tachikoma: Daddy... Mommy... Daddy...
I'm back!
Whew, what an unclassy experience that was.
Huh? Did that tank get everyone else, too?
Still, they weren't taken out the same way I was.
Hm?
What have we here?
"Souvenir: Danger"...
Aagh!! I, oh, it's a souvenir!
Huh?
So, this is one of those mementos intended just for those, like yours truly, who had stay behind, huh?
How thoughtful, the Major didn't forget about me!
Which must mean that these other ones, who didn't stay behind, got clobbered when they tried to take my souvenir for themselves.
That'll teach 'em. "Danger" is written right on here, plain as day.
Sheesh, they really ought to give more thought to the meaning of words.
Well, this cyberbrain of a Jeri-model android from Genesis Androids, is it?
Only those who fulfill their duties and responsibilities are deserving.
So without further ado... Away we go!

Jeri: I love you, Marshall. I love you, Marshall.

Tachikoma: Ahem!
And on that note, I had Mr. Ishikawa whip up an antivirus training program in order to strengthen our antivirus procedures!

Tachikoma: Hi, all you kids sitting in front of the TV out there!
Today's Science File is about the mysterious life cycle of the Tachikoma!
Now, I wonder what sort of secrets will be revealed.
A Tachikoma begins its lifelong journey as an egg.
After we hatch from our shells, we enter the stage of rapid growth and shedding.
The typical Tachikoma will go through an average of 6 to 7 moltings before reaching physical maturity.
The final molting is called "emergence".
A Tachikoma transforms directly from larva to adult without pupating.
Put in big words, this is a scientific term called "incomplete metamorphosis".
So, boys and girls, has this taught you something about the amazing life cycle of a Tachikoma?
That's all for today's Science File!
See you later, everybody!

Tachikoma: Hi, all you kids sitting in front of the TV out there!
Today's Science File is about the mysterious life cycle of the Tachikoma!
Now, I wonder what sort of secrets will be revealed.
Tachikomas regularly outgrow their pods during their lives.
Each time our pods become too small for us, we swap it for a new one that's more suitable to our body sizes.
But sometimes we just don't have any luck finding the right sized pod, in that case, we'll dock with any old thing that happens to be on hand.
Illegal dumping is really common these days, so all sorts of stuff is usually lying around.
So, boys and girls, has this taught you something about the amazing life cycle of a Tachikoma?
That's all for today's Science File! See...
Hey! Quit yanking on my pod!
