  Lelouch, a youth of Britannia, had been granted special abilities by a mysterious girl.



Jeremiah: We've found your fingerprints all over this weapon. You're also suspected of murdering members of the Royal Guard.
Come clean now, and you'll be judged as though you were born a Britannian, not some worthless Eleven.

Suzaku: You're wrong! I've done nothing!




Tamaki:
That's why we should've issued freaking statement sooner.we could've taken credit for it.

Ohgi:
Naoto. I'm not cut out for this, I'm no leader.


Old Man:
Yes, everything is just as you requested. We have the best in the business working on it.
Once the slide system is in order, it's all yours.
Once I've erased all of the evidence I should forget this ever happened, right?

Principal:
Truely this is bitterly painful incident for all, the viceroy of area 11, our beloved prince Clovis has been lost to us forever.
However, we can and will bear the weight of this tragedy, and from this darkest of hours draw strength.

Lloyd:
We've lost the most crucial part of the equation.

Cecile:
Can we do it without him?

Lloyd:
Don't I wish. The other units never let go of a good pilot. And even if we got one, they never match his readings.
His operational efficiency clocked at 94 percent. Then you wanna replace him?

Cecile:
You should tell them that, perhaps they'll let Suzaku go.

Lloyd:
He's an honorary Britanian, they'd never listen.
Ever since general Bartley's disgraced, the purebloods have the military and I am gripped.

Shirley:
The pureblood's what?

Lelouch:
Well, from what I understand, they're saying that only pureblood Britanians should be allowed to serve in the military.

Lloyd:
Their view is one of their own can never be a criminal.
But if the criminal is an Eleven, it pays the way for Margrave Jeremiah to shut down the practice of granting natives honorary status.

Cecile:
And what about Suzaku?

Lloyd:
He is fake so but decided.

Cecile:
Hmm.

Rivalz:
Hey Lelouch! You got anything going on later?
After all classes have been cancelled for the day, hawks have been asking for a rematch.

Shirley:
You are not gambling you guys!

Rivalz:
Come on. Don't be such a stick in the mud.

Lelouch:
She's right though. Maybe it's time to quit.

Rivalz:
Huh?

Lelouch:
I found a better opponent actually.

Shirley:
You did? I don't get it.

Rivalz:
You'll cut me in on the action too, right?

Lelouch:
A-Hahaha. Better not. It's not really up your alley.

Guide:
Britania's resounding victory over Japan opened the unenlightened nation's eyes to it's true place in today's world order.
Since then the empire and area 11 had walked hand in hand down the road to revival.

Kallen:
16 hundred hours at Tokyo tower. Why here of all places?

Sugiyama?:
It was Kururugi who contacted us wasn't it?

Ohgi:
Hard to say.

Yoshida?:
Yeah, but he might have been arrested after his communication with Kallen.

Sugiyama?:
Then we are in danger here. We should go.

Announcement:
Attention please. Paging Miss Kallen Stadtfeld, Ashford Academy.
One of your personal effects has been turned in at the kiosk on the observation deck.
I repeat.

Woman at the counter:
Hi. I'm assuming that this phone is yours, ma'am.
Uhm, something wrong? It is yours isn't it?

Kallen:
Ah, yeah thank you so much.

Ohgi:
Oh yeah, there's no debating. Life is better here thanks to Prince Clovis.
I mean it's all due to Britania that we can rebuild as quickly as we did.
I'm happy about that...

Kallen:
Zero?
Uhm... Hello?

Lelouch:
I want you to board the outbound train on loop line five. And bring your friends.

Kallen:
What?


Jeremiah: You handled His Highness's memorial program very well, a little too weepy from my taste but...Diethard: Yes, well the masses tend to like tear-jerker, your excellency.Diethard: It's quite common from memorial program to be set in advance for important people.Jeremiah: Does that including me as well?Diethard: Recent event may have bumped you up the list a bit your excellency.Jeremiah: I wasn't deemed important enough till now is that it? How forthright of you!Diethard: I'm afraid so sir.Jeremiah: Ever thought of enlisting? The army could use more men like you.Diethard: I don't think it would be a very good fit. Not really my cup of tea.Jeremiah: You prefer the civil sector I take it. No matter, I have another favor to ask of you. Tomorrow night Suzaku Kururugi will be transfered to his court-martial.Diethard: We should line the road with good patriotic Britannians.Jeremiah: Excellent. You catch on quickly don't you? Be sure the rabble can see his face.Viletta: Lord Jeremiah, there are those among the Elevens who see private Kururugi as a hero. Some might very well make an attempt to free him.Jeremiah: I'll be there personally aboard my Sutherland. If anyone even thinks of causing trouble, they will be executed on the spot.Announcer: Attention all passengers if you become aware of any suspicious items on board, please alert metro personnel by using the nearest inter-telephone.Kallen: What now?Lelouch: Face forward and look to your right. What do you see?Kallen: The Britannian city. It was stolen away from us and built on our sacrifice.Lelouch: And on the left?Kallen: I see our city. Remnants of the desiccated city after the Britannian sucked it dry.Lelouch: Good answer. Now make your way to the front of the train.Announcer: The next stop is Okubo. Okubo is next. Those wishing to transfer to the Chuo-Soubu line should exit at the next stop. Okubo will be next. Once again. Those wishing to transfer to the Chuo-Soubu line should exit at the next stop.Kallen: Was it you? On the phone?Yoshida?: Wow... Do you think it's a trap?Kallen: Well, was that you in Shinjuku? Was that cease fire your doing?Yoshida?: Hey, we're talking to you.Lelouch: What do you think of my tour at the settlement?Ohgi: Your tour?Yoshida?: Come-on, there is no way it was this joker.Lelouch: I wanted you to fully grasp the two, the settlement and the ghetto.Ohgi: Yeah, we know. There is a difference between us and them. A very harsh one. And that's why we resist them.Lelouch: You are wrong. Britannia will not fall to terrorism.Ohgi: Fall?Lelouch: It's a little bit better than childish nuisance.Yoshida?: What was that? You call us a bunch of kids?Lelouch: You should know your enemy. It is not people, but Britannia itself. It is a war you must wage, but not on the innocent. Take up your sword! Fight for justice!Kallen: Oh please. That's all easy enough to say, isn't it? Hiding behind that mask... why should we even trust you?Yoshida?: She's right! Lose the mask!Ohgi: Right. Are you going to show us your face or not?Lelouch: Very well, I'll show you. But rather than my face, bear witness to my power. If I deliver to you the impossible, then I might have earned your trust.

: He killed the prince of Britannia. Suzaku Kururugi should be treated as a hero.

: Yeah, but he's an honorary Britannian.

: Prime minister Kururugi was his father.

: So what? The bastard gave up Japan, and people don't know that about him.

: The whole Shinjuku business was the work of Kouzuki's group wasn't it?

: Yes, sir. They're being led by a man named Ohgi at present.

: Has Kururugi's family said anything?

: No, sir. They broke contact with him once he joined the military.

: Tohdoh, what are your thoughts?

Tohdoh: We should not become involved in this public execution.

: That's cowardly! You are Tohdoh, the miracle worker right?

Tohdoh: There is difference between miracles and foolhardiness.


Lloyd: Congratulations! Those two you asked me about weren't on the list of casualties.

Suzaku: That's good to hear..

Lloyd: Not much luck on your end though, you may be getting a trial, but no one is pulling for you certainly.

Suzaku: But the courts are where the truth comes to light.

Lloyd: I expect there'll be more smoke and mirrors than anything. The truth is scarce of late.

Suzaku: If that's how the world works, then so be it. I've no regret.



Announcer:
Any moment. Any moment now. It's a sight to see.
The throngs' lining the route.
All of them waiting on bated breath. Waiting for the accused murderer of Prince Clovis to pass by.
An honorary Britanian and a former Eleven Suzaku Kururugi.

Diethard:
Camera 5 is a little slow.
Talk to me, Charles, your team been deployed yet?
What? The studio? Let them wait. Nothing has been pushed back.
Everything is going according to plan. Here we go.
----
Cecile:
This is insane. We know that Suzaku is innocent.

Lloyd:
The court deemed our testimony inadmissible. There is nothing we can do.

Cecile:
Yes, but...

Cecile:
This isn't a time for a game of semantics!

Lloyd:
Not much else to do? We both know where this case is headed, don't we?
We couldn't reach him at the summit. All we can do is cut our losses, really.



Announcer:
Voices of scorn growing ever louder. Voices bearing testament to a people's love of their prince.
Raining their judgement down on a terrorist.

Nunnally:
Suzaku!
----


Episode Preview: 
So naive! I was sure Suzaku would understand. Change the system from within? Ridiculous! The system will just swallow him up! It’ll eat him alive! I can’t beg for their charity to live my life! I just can’t. I won’t live by their rules anymore!
