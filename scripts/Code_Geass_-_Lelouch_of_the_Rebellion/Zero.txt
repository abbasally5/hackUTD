  I see... So you were Zero... the entire time...
Darlton was right... he said it was someone with a grudge against the Britannian Imperial Family...
Y--you did this for Nunnally?

Correct.
I will demolish the present world then build a new and better one in its place.

You killed them all for the sake of that madness?!
Clovis... even Euphy?!

You're one to talk, my dear sister, considering how you idolized my mother, Marianne the Flash.

It would seem... that talking with you further would prove to be utterly pointless.

Indeed. Well, then... Lelouch vi Britannia orders you to answer him!

Go on.

Sister, are you the one who killed my mother?

I'm not.

Then who was it?

I don't know.

But you were put in charge of her personal guard, were you not?

Yes.

Then why did you withdraw her escort?

I was asked to.

By whom?!

Lady Marianne.

Mother did?! It's impossible!
My mother knew she would be attacked that day?!
No... that can't be... If she did, she would have gotten us out of there!
What really happened back then?! Who killed her?!
Who killed my mother, dammit!
You don't know the truth? Then who does?! Someone must know!
You yourself investigated what occurred that day!

I remember His Majesty the Emperor ordered Schneizel to transport the body out of there.

The body? You mean mother's? Then what was in that coffin?

Hey, get back in here!

I know! The government bureau defense forces will be here soon.

No! Your little sister's been kidnapped!

Hmm? C.C., this is not the time for jokes.
We'll take Cornelia back to the command center as our hostage.

She's been taken! I just know because shes the reason you live!
She's on Kamine Island!

Kamine Island?


ALL HAIL BRITANNIA!
Mr. Zero? Can it really be? What?!
Oh, what luck! What fate! What evil fortune!

Is that you, Orange Boy?

Oh! Oooohhh! I beseech you!
I'm begging you, please die.

Damn! Get Cornelia!

I'm already on it!

Zero! I... must rid the world of the empire's enemies!
Yes! And so... ALL HAIL BRITANNIA!

It's a damned disgrace! If we report to the prince what happened here...

It's only his emotions running wild. His behavior's too hard to predict right now.

I wish we could communicate with him, get through to him somehow!

Out of the way!

ZEROOOO!!!



STAGE 25: ZERO



Currently passing through Ozu[XX] area.

Why did you try to stop Suzaku?

I'm a military contractor.

You didn't want him killed, did you?

Why should I care? You know as well as I do.
The biggest human flaw is that we're so pitifully fragile in our bodies, our hearts, and our relationships with each other.

Nevertheless, you can't bend the world or people any which way you want.

I want every part in my mechanisms to function exactly as I wish.
If we lose Kururugi, we'll just have to find another Devicer.


Be careful, please! Any Knightmare entering the field will shut down immediately!

Understood.


He's very good.

Ohgi, it's Zero.

Zero! Thank God!

Hm? What? Minami? Where's Ohgi?

Someone shot him! We're treating him, but he's unconscious.
And the culprit who shot him is still...

All right, he'll do. The girl in the wheelchair, do you know where she is right now?

Uhh, isn't Ohgi more important?

I'll arrange for his replacement later! The girl in the wheelchair comes first!

His replacement?

Confirm her location! Hurry!

All of the students we had confined alone have disappeared in the confusion when Ohgi was shot...

Bring as many as you can, medicine too!

Hang in there, Ohgi...

Lelouch, this is a bad time...

Is Nunnally there with you?

No, she's in the clubhouse. We're just a short distance away.

Understood!

No, wait! Hey, where are you anyway?!

I can't get through to Nunnally or even Sayoko!

Lelouch, you know I'm here with you as your accomplice, but also as your ally.

So I should just trust you, take the word of a woman who won't give me any reasons?

Look, I don't want you to die. At least, that's true.

Hmph! That's just one-sided convenience!
Third Squad, enemy aircraft!
Synch fire and shoot it down!

Roger! Tracking enemy... Fire!

I see them... (voice echoing) I see them...

Wh--what the hell is that?!

Captain Kagezaki!

Zero! ZERO!!!

That's it! I don't have time to fool with cannon fodder like you!

C.C.! Get to 12th Street now!

Talk about one-sided convenience!

You missed! You can't hit me, Jeremiah Gottwald!

You're wrong, Orange Boy. You're being hit right now.

Coward... behind from back!

Be smashed to dust, you relic!
All right, now to get to Nunnally.


Damn, that's a thick hatch!
Wish we had the sword with the rotating blade.

Tamaki, what do you want us to do with them?
Should we lock them in the dorms or the gym with the other students?

Students?

Call Zero!
I guarantee you that Zero wants us to be safe!
If not, something's wrong!
He's trying to guard us!

Aw, shut up! Zero and me are tight -- I know the man better than anybody!
And he's not gonna hesitate to shoot anyone at a time like this!

Stop!

Oh, what's this? The Japanese knight comes out to help the Brits, huh?

Suzaku...

That white Knightmare is all we came here to get!
A dirty traitor like you can die right there!

Arthur!

Stupid-ass cat! Screw this, just kill all of 'em!

Good evening, everyone!

Retreat! Let's pull out!

You're kidding! That Earl of Pudding actually came out to the front lines?!

Rakshata... I thought it was you.

C'mon!

Oh, you...!

Well, Miss Cecile, how are the test parts working out?

They're ready to be practically applied.

It's back on!

Unlock your fuel hatch -- we'll replace your energy filler.

Right! But why did you come out here, too, Miss Cecile?

Good question. Why did we, Lloyd?

Why else -- to recover the Lancelot, and do a few other things as well.

It's a Sutherland arm, is it showing contact?

It cleared the compatibility check.

Good, now leave this place to us. You go after Zero.

Thanks to you, I will. Please protect Ashford Academy and everyone here!

Yes. After all, my fianc√©e is here too.

Hmm? Royal private channel?

K--Kururugi...?

Viceroy Cornelia?!


Damn their tenacity! I'd expect that of Cornelia's elite!

Tohdoh!

Hmm?

From here on, I'm leaving all operations in your hands!
Ohgi's been wounded. Have Diethard assume his duties.

Hold on a second, what do you mean, leaving them to me?!

I'm afraid there's another urgent matter that requires my attention.
I won't respond to any further communications from you!

W--wait! What else could be more urgent than this, Zero?!

Seventh Squad, wiped out!

What?!

Remain calm! You're safe, so wait your turn! Younger students go first!

We gotta fall back!

Destroy any records you can't take!

Hurry! Hurry!


This battle situation... bodes victory for my forces...
Am I clear? Do all you can to hide the fact that I've been wounded.
It'll only upset them... Guilford... and the Glaston Knights...
You're the only one... I can tell...

Don't try to talk anymore.

Kamine Island... that's where Zero's headed.
Any more than that... It's no use. I can't remember.

Geass!

Y--you're Euphy's knight, aren't you?
Then you must go and clear her dishonored name!

Y--yes!

I know this is a bit informal, but I dub thee Knight of Honor of Britannia.
You are now a knight in both name and station.
Go, Suzaku Kururugi...

Yes, Your Highness!


What, does this mean that Zero's disappeared?

Not at all, he's simply transferred command to us on-site here.
Right.
Why... why now, of all times...?


I wanna know why Ohgi was shot! And where the hell is Zero?!

I said I don't know!

Can't someone get a hold of him?!

It makes no sense -- he had no reason to run away.

In spite of Tohdoh's experience, if he doesn't see the entire picture.

Zero... I don't know what to do next...

K--Kallen...

Ohgi! Are you all right?!

Yeah... Kallen, listen to me -- go after Zero!
There must be... a reason... he's acting this way...
Save him... Zero... the one who will realize... Naoto's dream...

But... how do I find him?!

You should see it soon...

That's... the Lancelot! What would be drawing him away from here?
Rakshata... put a transmitter on it...

Understood!

Supply corps, send a captured air transport to me ASAP -- it's top priority!

Dammit! Can't we at least hold this place?!

It will only be until all the students are aboard the ship. Hang in there.

Yes, I will.
Why am I reading a thermal reaction in there?!

A Knightmare!

What in the world does that antique doing here?!

The Ganymede...?
Nina!

Oh, hell! Cease fire! That goes for you two, Black Knights!

Huh?

Call a temporary truce! We can't fire on that!

Listen, everyone, do what he says! Hold your fire!
If it's got Lloyd that panicked, then...

Nina, did you complete it?

There wasn't time to test it. I don't know if it'll explode.
Still, I try to...

Nina, what did you mean by "explode?!"

It's dangerous! Stay back!

You see, if her theory is correct, that thing may destroy the entire Tokyo Settlement.

But that is impossible!

Believe it! She's even using Sakuradite!

Zero... where is he? Tell me where he is! Princess Euphemia will be avenged!
WHERE IS ZERO?!!!


If I've lost Nunnally... then what have I been fighting for till now?
What's the point of this war of independence?
Why did Euphy have to be sacrificed?!

Kamine Island in sight!

I'm taking Nunnally back... no matter who tries to stop me!



It figures it would be here. Do you have some sort of connection to this place?

Not this one.

Humph. Meaning there are other places similar to like this one?
Does Nunnally's abductor have a Geass power?

I don't know that much.
It's the truth.

I don't doubt it.
We're still accomplices, so at the very least I should give you the benefit of believing you.

Thank you.

What's the matter?

I see! This is--!

What?!

Calm down! We're caught in a trap that was set for intruders. The one who activated it is--

What is this...? The past...?

C.C.! No... But...

Hold it right there!

Stop it... STOP IT!!!
C. C., these visions -- are these of your...

All I have left are my memories from when I was a witch.
Other than that, I don't even know if I was ever human to begin with.
Every person who has ever hated me and each and every one that has showed me any kindness are gone forever; they've vanished into the current of time.
Always existing with the endless flow of eternity, I am utterly alone.

You are not alone!

Huh?!

We're each other's accomplice.
Therefore, if you're supposed to be a witch, then perhaps I should be a demon.

Odd thing to say at a time like this.

C.C., you okay?

Don't you know who you're talking to?

Zero! It is I!
Repent is now!

Stubborn ass!
The section Cornelia damaged before!

There's one shot left in the Hadron Cannon!

It's time for my wonderful vindication!
Insidious isolation impudence!

I'll handle this lunatic! You go after Nunnally!

But, we're out of energy!

I'll be all right!
Well... I am nervous.
You have to prevail, over your own past, and over the outcome of your own action.

C.C., don't die.

Who are you talking to?

Hmph. You have a point.

I've found him!

You're not my first pick to commit suicide with, but...


Hold your ground! Victory's within our reach, be strong!

Dammit, we can't hold out!

Enemy reinforcements will be here soon!
What should we do?!

Inoue...?
Where the hell is he? ZEROOO!

All forces, charge! We'll smash these filthy rebels with one blow!

Fight to your last breath! Stop at nothing!
Because if they break through here, our forces will collapse completely!

It's not that Tohdoh isn't a brilliant military leader; he simply lacks the incredible charisma Zero possesses.
We need him... He can't run out on us -- not now!

Oh Zero, have you really abandoned us?
Have you abandoned Japan?


That trap at the entrance was designed to buy them time.
Was I the intended target... or was it C.C.?
No matter. The first thing to do is make sure Nunnally is all right.

Turn and face me, very slowly.

Dammit, why now?!

Didn't you hear me, Zero?
I said, turn and face me, very slowly.

Euphemia randomly murdered throngs of innocent Japanese people. You'd fight for a woman like--

Your Geass power is quite convenient, isn't it?
You get to hide in the shadows while others take all the blame for doing your dirty work.
You're just an arrogant coward -- that's your true nature, the real you.
Kallen!
Don't you want to know Zero's true identity, too?

What are you saying?!

You have a right to bear witness.

No, wait!
But how... how could you...?!

I didn't want it... to be you.

L--Lelouch is the...?

Yes, I am Zero -- the man who leads the Black Knights, who challenges the Holy Britannian Empire, the one who holds the entire world in his hand.

You used us... the Japanese people...? You used me?!

And as a result, Japan will be freed. You certainly can't complain about that.

I should have arrested you when I had the chance...

You knew it was me?

I wasn't sure at first, so I convinced myself that it wasn't true.
But I really wanted to believe in you.
But you were lying to us -- to me, your sister Euphy... and Nunnally!

Yes, and now Nunnally's been kidnapped!
Please, Suzaku, can't we call a temporary truce? I need your help!
Together we'll be able to save Nunnally!
There's nothing in the world that you and I can't do together!

I'm done with that!
Had you only joined up with Euphy first, we wouldn't be here!
If you and she had combined forces, things would be different!
The world could have been--

That's all in the past! Over and done.

Past?!

You killed your own father, didn't you?
Wallow in remorse when you have time for it!

No, you're hopeless!

What?

I know you! In the very end, you'd betray the entire world, the way it's betrayed you!
I'm not going to let your sick, twisted dream be realized!

You fool! You think ideals alone can change the world?!
Fine, then go right ahead and shoot me, come on!
Set your aim on this liquid Sakuradite!
If my heart stops, this vial will explode. You'll both die with me.

Damn you!

Listen, I'll make a deal with you.
I wanna know who told you about Geass. Did they abduct Nunnally?!

Nothing that happens now is any of your concern!
Your very existence is a mistake!
You need to be erased from the face of the Earth! I'll take care of Nunnally!

SUZAKU!

LELOUCH!
