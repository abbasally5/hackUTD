  Arabian Commander: Open fire!

Arabian soldier: Gloucester?

Arabian soldier: It's supposed to be in Serupham.

Darlton: Shoddy oversized imitation Knightmares.

Guilford: They would've been wise to surrender from the start.

Arabian Commander: What?

Arabian Commander: So Cornelia. A single unit did this?

Cornelia: Another victory. Area 18 has been established.

Subordinate: My Lady, about our next course of action.

Cornelia: Sorry to have you clean up after my foolish younger brother.

Subordinate: Please don't apologize, my Lady. We live to serve and our place is with you.

Cornelia: Humph. Do you think the Area 11 needs our usual treatment?

Subordinate: Yes, my Lady.

Cornelia: Good.

Cornelia: I'll drive you into the open, Zero. Clovis will be avenged.

Lelouch: I'm back.

C.C. : Welcome home, Lelouch.

Nunnaly: I'm so glad. I was worried.

C.C. : I'm assuming you ate out tonight judging from your appearance.

Nunnaly: Thank goodness. I thought maybe you've gotten caught up in all the uproar caused by that man Zero. I tried calling you but you didn't answer your cellphone. I wanted to tell you Ms. C.C.'s been waiting as well.

Lelouch: C.C.?

Nunnaly: Your friend goes by such an unusual name, only her initials.

Lelouch: Yeah.

Nunnaly: I was just wondering, is C.C. your girlfriend?

Lelouch: Huh?

C.C. : He made a promise about our future together. Right?

Lelouch: Huh?

Nunnaly: A future together? You mean marriage?

Lelouch: No! No, that isn't what she was talking about. It's like a... she's kidding around.

C.C. : No, I'm not.

Nunnaly: Well you're certainly doing this sooner than most. But everyone's different, aren't they? So I suppose it isn't THAT strange. And if you feel like you're ready for...

Nunnaly: Oh.

Lelouch: Oh, C.C. Look what you've done, you're soaking wet. Come on, let's get you to the bathroom and into a dry change of clothes.
Nunnaly, stay here and I'll clean it up in a minute. And she was kidding before. Kidding. Just a dumb joke. That's all.



Lelouch: Who are you?

C.C. : She said my name. I'm C.C.

Lelouch: That's not I meant. Why aren't you...

C.C. : Supposed to be dead?

Lelouch: Hmm...

C.C. : So, do you like the power that I gave you?

Lelouch: As I thought, it was you.

C.C. : Dissatisfied?

Lelouch: On the contrary, I'm grateful. It allows me speed up my schedule tremendously, which is a huge help.

C.C. : Your schedule?

Lelouch: Yes. My schedule for obliterating Britania. I would've had to wait much longer before I could've made the initial move.

C.C. : You believe you can destroy it simply by using that power?

Lelouch: I intended to do it without this power.

C.C. : I just knew that he'd turn out to be a fascinating guy.

Lelouch: But what'll you do now? I'm sure the military is after you.

C.C. : Not the entire military, only a small faction of it. So it shouldn't be difficult to find hiding place. I can make do here.

Lelouch: What? You expect to stay here?

C.C. : A gentleman would sleep on the floor.

Lelouch: Don't joke around.

C.C. : My being caught would cause trouble for you too.

Lelouch: It's dangerous to stay together.

C.C. : If I wander the streets, they'll find me.

Lelouch: This isn't about you. It's my situation.

C.C. : I hate stubbornness.

Lelouch: You sure take things casually, don't you? How did you manage to survive before this? What did you do before now? And what's the deal with that so-called contract you spoke of...

C.C. : Good night, Lelouch.

Lelouch: Hmm...







Cecile: Fukushima, Kouchi, Hiroshima. This has been the seventh occurence since that man named Zero raised his head.

Lloyd: It seems the other groups are following his lead and putting up a valiant fight.

Cecile: And now, suspicions about that "Orange" thing have cost Margrave Jeremiah his command.

Lloyd: Maybe he wasn't good enough. Thanks to him, connections between the police and the administration are screwed up. It's made a fine mess for us as well.





Senba?: Help them Tohdoh! Zero has thrown the Britannians into chaos. Now is the time for us in the Japan Liberation Front to make our stand!

Tohdoh: Calm down. The information of Kyoto giving the Guren Mk-II to Zero hasn't been confirmed. If we pay too much attention to Zero we may trip ourselves up.





C.C. : So, what did "Orange" turn out to be anyway?

Lelouch: Hunh.

C.C. : Well?

Lelouch: You know for someone who isn't willing to answer any questions, you certainly do ask a lot of them.

C.C. : If you don't want to answer my questions, you don't have to. Just as I don't.

Lelouch: Humph. There is no "Orange". It's something I made up. But, the more they claim to be comrades of like-mind, the easier it is to divide them with the thorns of suspicion.

C.C. : H'm.

C.C. : Everyone on earth is looking for you. Because of you the world is going through an upheaval. So, is this it? Is this what you wanted to see?

Lelouch: No. This uproar's simply a means to an end. The world is destined to descended into a greater chaos.



Judge: Case No.107 Private Suzaku Kururugi, Area 11 Military Forces. In the murder of His Highness Prince Clovis you are no longer a suspect, and are hereby set free due to lack of evidence.

Suzaku: What happened? I'm free.

Euphemia: Out of the way, please. Look out below!

Euphemia: Oh!

Suzaku: Uh, are you all right?

Euphemia: I'm sorry. I wasn't aware you were down here until I had leapt.

Suzaku: Well, don't worry. I wasn't expecting a girl to come falling out of the sky and into my arms, either.

Euphemia: Oh, my...

Suzaku: Huh? Is there something wrong?

Euphemia: Yes! There is something wrong.

Suzaku: Huh?

Euphemia: The truth is bad guys are chasing me. So considering the circumstances could you help me, please?





Pure Bloods member: We must get rid of this "Orange" character before Princess Cornelia assumes her new post.

Pure Bloods member: Now the loyalty of us Pure Bloods is being called into question.

Pure Bloods member: Are the reports we've been hearing true? Lord Jeremiah was bribed?

Pure Bloods member: Do you know what this "Orange" means?

Pure Bloods member: Ugh.

Pure Bloods member: In any case, Lord Jeremiah is definitely hiding something.

Pure Bloods member: Saying he can't recall anything, Bartley offered the same excuse.

Villetta: Lord Jeremiah's memory is muddled. Exactly like those of the men in Shinjuku whose Sutherlands were stolen. And...





Euphemia: We haven't introduced ourselves yet, have we? My name is... Euphie.

Suzaku: Euphie?

Euphemia: Yes.

Suzaku: My name's ...

Euphemia: Don't tell me.

Suzaku: Huh?

Euphemia: 'Cause I already know it. You're a celebrity, son of Prime Minister Genbu Kururugi, Private Suzaku Kururugi.

Suzaku: Humph. You lied before. There's no one chasing you at all, right?

Euphemia: Meow!

Suzaku: What?

Euphemia: Meow meow. Aww, does the kitty's paw hurt? Oh, meow meow meow!

Kitten: Meow? (Sniff-sniff) Meow!

Euphemia: Meow meow.

Euphemia: (Tittering)

Suzaku: H'm...huh.

Kitten: (Chomp!)

Suzaku: Aargh!

Euphemia: Oh, my...



Lloyd: We're running late. I hope he's still waiting for us.

Cecile: Considering the charge, did they really release him?

Lloyd: Yes. They had no evidence. I'm sure they put him through the third degree because of that Zero incident, uh-huh?

Lloyd: What? Why is he...

Cecile: Aha.




Sound truck: If you want to enjoy...

Euphemia: Do you have trouble with cats?

Suzaku: H'm. I like them fine. However...

Kitten: Grrr...

Suzaku: H'm. The attraction isn't mutual.

Euphemia: I think an unrequited love is a mark of a kind person. Oh.

Suzaku: Oh.

Euphemia: The kitty ran away.

Suzaku: Oo. Euphie, why did you tell me that lie when we met?

Euphemia: Do you ask because you're concerned about me?

Suzaku: Huh? Um... of course.

Euphemia: Good! Then you can accompany me some more.

Suzaku: Alright.

Euphemia: Come on. It'll be fun.



Euphemia: You know, being here is just like being in Britania. I feel right at home.

Suzaku: Are you from the homeland?

Euphemia: Uh-huh. I was a student there up until last week.

Suzaku: Last week? So what're you doing now? By student do you mean high school? You can go sightsee anytime, can't you?

Euphemia: Heh-heh. You ask a lot of questions.

Suzaku: Ah, sorry.

Euphemia: Oh! No, I don't mean it like that. You see... today is the last day of my vacation. I wanted to see as much of Area 11 as I could because I'd like to know what kinda place it is.

Suzaku: Well, you didn't need me for that.

Euphemia: No, I'm glad I could see it with you.

Suzaku: Is that right?



Euphemia: Suzaku, would you mind taking me to one more place, please?

Suzaku: Your wish is my command, my Lady. Where to?

Euphemia: Take me to Shinjuku.

Suzaku: Uh,

Euphemia: Suzaku Kururugi, please escort me there.



Kallen: Lelouch?

Lelouch: Hm?

Kallen: Do you have a minute?

Lelouch: Uh-huh. What is it?

Kallen: About that phone call the other day.

Lelouch: A phone call?

Kallen: Yeah, you know, when you and I were in the bathroom.

Lelouch: Uh-huh.

Kallen: Can you find out what the caller ID was? I want to contact that person again.

Lelouch: It was a school phone, so I'm not sure such... EEK!?

Kallen: I see. Make sense. I should have known.

Lelouch: That girl...

Kallen: What? Is there something wrong...Woa?

Shirley: Huh? No way.

Kallen: Excuse me. What are you doing?

Lelouch: Ah... what indeed.


Bartley: To think I turn to homeland like this, I wish I never involved the damn girl.


Lelouch: Are you insane? You can't go walking around.

C.C.: Don't act strict with me, I never leave the school ground so it's fine.

Lelouch: It's not. You can't do as you like here, you don't belong.

C.C.: I don't belong anywhere.
Hmm? What's with her?

Lelouch: Oh, is she doing again today?

C.C.: Again?

Lelouch: She is going to be marking the wall like that every day, because I used my Geass on her to make her do it.

C.C.: Geass?

Lelouch: The name of the power I have. That's what I heard when we first made contact.

C.C.: You testing how long it lasts?

Lelouch: I need to know the specs of my weapon, don't I?
So behave or I'll try it on you.

C.C.: Would it work on me?

C.C.: Oh relax, you and I are in this together, I won't do anything to endanger us or our unique partnership.



Suzaku: The Shinjuku Ghetto... ruined again. The residents were starting to return too.

Britannian: Man, they didn't use RG on the Elevens. I figured they wouldn't.

Britannian: Hey, look! Those are marks of Hummer rounds. Get a clear shot of it.

Britannian: Say cheese! Got it. Okay, me next.



Jeremiah: This is accurate? This information about Zero?

Pure Bloods Operator: Yes, sir. Lord Kewell contacted me.

Jeremiah: Right. Set up a cordon around Shinjuku Ghetto Sector 4 at once.

Pure Bloods Operator: Cordon Sector 4. Roger. Okay, ball's in your court now, Lord Kewell. Ugh!

Villetta: I wanted to be put through to Lord Jeremiah. But it appears that you're too busy now.



Tamaki: Get out of here, you damn Britanian bastards!

Euphemia: Eh?

Suzaku: Stay here.

Britanian: How dare a lowly Eleven speak like...

Tamaki: Don't call me Eleven! I'm Japanese.

Britanian: Wrong. You seem to forget you people lost. You're nothing but a beaten dog!

Tamaki: Grrr... you racist pig.

Suzaku: Stop. Please no violence!

Tamaki: Stay out of this!

??? : You're that...

??? : Are you Suzaku Kururugi?

??? : The guy who killed Clovis?

??? : No, it... it... it was Zero who killed him.

Tamaki: Tchick. This guy is nothing more than a slave. Big deal. You're an honorary Britanian. Nobody cares. You sold your pride, your people, yourself, yet you call yourself Japanese?

Suzaku: No! You're wrong!

Tamaki: I am not wrong! You stinking Britanian lapdog aaah...

Others: Ah.

Tamaki: Oh!

Suzaku: Stop, please!

Tamaki: (grunt)

Suzaku: I've warn you I've been trained for military combat. Don't make me fight against my own people.

Tamaki: Like hell your own people!

Eleven: Come on. Just let it go.

Tamaki: Oof, lousy traitor.

Euphemia: Suzaku.

Euphemia: Oh, my... Are you okay?

Suzaku: Yeah, I'm alright.

Britanian: Well I'm not O.K. Just look at my prime-G and my elex-4.

Britanian: Why did you wait? Damn it, some honorary citizen you are.

Britanian: Why'd you let 'em go? You should have killed 'em. What's a few dead elevens to a guy like you! Who do you think's taking care of you all these years anyway? Ugh!

Euphemia: I'll not allow you to insult this man any longer you oaf.



Lelouch: To use my Geass, I need to have direct eye contact with the subject. Transparent objects like eyeglasses present no problem. The effective range is approximately 270 meters. And a subject appears to have no memory of events before, during, or after the power is used. I think this is due to damage caused by the Geass interfering with the brain of the subject. Also if the signal's optical I can reflect it.

C.C. : In the short time you had it, you've learned a lot.

Lelouch: My opponent is an Empire that controls more than 1/3 of the entire world. There's no such thing as being too careful.

C.C. : I'd understand if you were an Eleven, but you are a Britannian, aren't you? This opponent may be too large and strong to fight with only Geass for a weapon.

Lelouch: Is it good to be strong?

Suzaku: Is it bad to be weak?

Suzaku: Back then when I was ten, the world seemed like such a terribly sad place. A world without any hope at all.

Lelouch: Starvation,
Suzaku: disease,
Lelouch: filth, decay,
Suzaku: racism,
Lelouch: constant war and terrorism.
Suzaku: Living in a never-ending cycle of hate.
Lelouch: Rats running in a wheel.
Suzaku: The cycle must be broken. Somebody has to do it.

C.C. : How idealistic.

Suzaku: Of course, it's doubtful if the one who does it will make all the bad things go away.

Lelouch: I'm not that arrogant, and so...

Suzaku: No one should lose more of the people they love. At least, a world without war.

C.C. : And to have this utopia you'd...?

Euphemia: How would you do it?

Lelouch: It's simple. When somebody wins, the fighting will end.

C.C. : Somebody?

Suzaku: I don't know how you would do it. But if I stop trying, then my father's death will have been in vain.

Euphemia: The Prime Minister's death?

Suzaku: My own father died, because he had to sacrifice his life in that war.

Euphemia: Ah.

Kewell: Jeremiah. You are going to pay for letting Prince Clovis' murderer go free.

Jeremiah: Kewell! You dirty coward. That sighting of Zero was a lie, wasn't it?

Kewell: We have to wipe away our disgrace before Princess Cornelia takes up her post here.

Kewell: This is how we keep our officials honest.

Cecile: Suzaku!

Suzaku: Miss Cecile.

Cecile: It's dangerous here, get in.

Lloyd: The Pure Bloods are having a silly squabble. Let's get out of here. Oh, and by the way, what a shame about your acquittal. Because now you'll have to work for me again.

Suzaku: Wait, please! Isn't this an opportunity to gather battle data for the Lancelot?

Cecile: Ah?

Lloyd: Oho?

Euphemia: Suzaku...

Suzaku: I'm sorry, Euphie. We have to say goodbye here. I need to do this. I think I can stop them with the Lancelot. I have to try. I... I must!



Jeremiah: Damn, it's four against one. Cowards!

Kewell: Don't worry Jeremiah. We'll say you died in battle. Your family's name won't be disgraced.

Jeremiah: You're serious then? You actually intend to kill me? Kewell!

Kewell: Silence, Orange! We serve the Imperial family. Why else would we be here? All Hail...

Pure Bloods: Britannia!

Kewell: What, ugh...



Suzaku: Stop it! You're all Britannian soldiers!

Jeremiah: That's him, it's that Honorary Britannian. The advanced weapon, Lancelot.

Kewell: What business of the Special Corps want here? Interlopers will die.

Suzaku: No! I can't stand by and ignore this senseless battle.

Kewell: Oh my God. They've perfected the MVSes. Too late, I won't back down.

Suzaku: We're on the same side!

Jeremiah: Suzaku Kururugi... is saving me?

Kewell: We can at least kill Orange.

Kewell & Jeremiah: Grrrr

Viletta: Lord Jeremiah!

Jeremiah: Viletta! Thanks.

Suzaku: Still wanna fight?

Kewell: Men, stand down.

Suzaku: You... you understand then?

Kewell: I'm using a chaos mine.

Suzaku: Huh?

Euphie: No, stop it now!

Suzaku: Ah.

Jeremiah: What?

Euphie: Ahh!

Suzaku: Nng, ahh

Euphie: Ah. Hmph.

Viletta: That Honorary Britannian. He risked his life for...

Euphie: Everyone, lower your weapons at once. In my name I command you.

Kewell: It...can't be.

Euphie: I am Euphemia li Britannia of the Empire. And the third princess of the royal family.

Suzaku: Ah! Euphie.

Euphie: I'm assuming command here. Now fall back.

Jeremiah: It is her, it's the princess.

Cecile: Did you know it was her, Lloyd?

Lloyd: Uh-huh, but she's been a student up until now and hasn't made her public debut yet.

Kewell: We, we're truly...

Pure Bloods: We're truly sorry, your Highness!

Suzaku: My Lady!

Euphie: Ah.

Suzaku: I had no idea who you were. Please forgive me, Princess.

Euphie: Suzaku, you and I bear a similar deep pain. You have lost your father as I have lost my brother.

Suzaku: Ah.

Euphie: Will you let me help you in your quest to ensure that no one ever again has to suffer the loss of a loved one on the battlefield.

Suzaku: Yes I'm unworthy of your kindness.

Cornelia: I heard what you did, Euphemia. You shouldn't be so reckless.

Euphemia: I know, Sister. Forgive me. But...

Cornelia: You will address me as Viceroy here, Sub-Viceroy Euphemia. Because we're sisters we need to follow a stricter protocol.

Euphemia: Yes, I understand.

Cornelia: Humph. Now then, give me your report.

Subordinate: Yes, my Lady. The first order of business is a welcome party we've arranged for your Highness and... Oh!

Euphemia: Ah.

Cornnelia: Sloppy, senile, corrupt. Where is Zero? I want the enemy of the Empire caught! Get Zero!




Lelouch: Huh?

Suzaku: I'll be joining the student body here at Ashford Academy beginning today. My name is Suzaku Kururugi. It's a pleasure to meet you.





次回予告

Lelouch: Yes, I understand. I'm lying. To Shirley and Rivalz and the others. Even to Suzaku and Nunnaly. But there's no going back now. I can't turn back. As long as C.C. and I are bound by our contract, I have to keep at this. Because I don't wanna lie to myself any more.
