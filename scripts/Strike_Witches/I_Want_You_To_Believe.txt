Minna:
So you're really gonna fly?

Mio:
True.
I've done a lot of thinking about it.
I'm already 20. My powers aren't strong as they used be.
It doesn't matter how hard I train.
I'm a Witch and in the end we all have the same fate.



Yoshika:
Hey!
I just don't understand. You don't act like you could be our enemy.



Mio:
What do you think you're doing, Miyafuji?

Yoshika:
Sakamoto!

Mio:
Damn you!

Perrine:
Major!

Minna:
What was that?
What just happened?

Yoshika:
Sakamoto was shot by the Neuroi!

Barkhorn:
She put up her shield but she's hurt pretty badly!

Perrine:
Major, please be okay...

Yoshika:
Please open your eyes.
Can you hear me?
Sakamoto, please, answer. Sakamoto!

----[OP]----

Perrine:
Major, can you hear me?
I'm here. Everything's gonna be all right, major. I promise!
Please answer me!
Do something!

Lynne:
Are you okay?
I've got you.

Yoshika:
No, it's all my fault.
Yoshika;
Sakamoto, c'mon! Please wake up!
You have to... for me. Open your eyes! Please...

Lynne:
Yoshika!

Yoshika:
Let go me, right now! I'm fine!

Minna:
Sergeant Miyafuji, calm down.

Barkhorn:
Minna.

Perrine:
Major!
Major...
Barkhorn
Miyafuji!

Lynne:
No! Yoshika! Do you need a doctor?
Are you okay? Can you hear me?
Yoshika!



Lynne:
How are you feeling?

Yoshika:
Ah, fine...

Lynne:
You're up at least. That's good.

Yoshika:
Where am I?
Is she gonna be okay?
Sakamoto! What happened to her?
Answer me, Lynne!

Minna:
Has there been any improvement?

Doctor:
No. But it's still too early to make predictions.



Perrine:
All this is because of you!
Well, say something! Or are you still waking up from your damn nap?

Lynne:
She passed out from using all her power to help Major Sakamoto...

Perrine:
Would just shut up?

Lynne:
No, I won't!
You're not being fair!
Yoshika was trying to help!

Perrine:
And look how much good it's done!

Lynne:
Yoshika, wait!

Yoshika:
Please wake up.



Lucchini:
Have you heard anything about the Major?

Shirley:
Not yet. We're still waiting.
Bite in the mean time I brought us some food.

Lucchini:
Not that again.

Shirley:
Well, aren't we pecky?

Sanya:
Shirley, what would happen? Do you think Yoshika would be okay after disobeying orders?
What is it?

Eila:
I'm rating Yoshika's fortune.

Sanya:
Yeah, what'd it say?

Sanya:
Says death.

Everyone:
(sigh)



Barkhorn:
We're dealing with unauthorized actions and violation of orders
leading to superior getting injured and the enemy slipping away.
It's a serious offence.

Hartmann:
So, you're saying she should get court marshaled and shot, huh?

Barkhorn:
No, that's not what I'm saying!

Hartmann:
I know.
If that would be the case, then I've been killed a bunch of times.

Barkhorn:
Damn Erica! Do you think you could take this more seriously?

Minna:
Okay, that's enough, you two.
I'll handle this after Major Sakamoto wakes up.

Hartmann:
Okay.

Barkhorn:
Don't go too easy on her!



Lynne:
Yoshika, look!
I think we've got a pulse!

Yoshika:
Sakamoto!

Perrine:
Major!
Please hang in there!

Yoshika:
Can you hear us?

Lynne:
Be right back. I'm gonna go get the doctor!

Yoshika:
C'mon, I don't get it. I'm giving all I've got!

Perrine:
Oh please.

Yoshika:
I'm so scared. I need help. I wish mam and granma were here...

Perrine:
Well, they're not! So you're just gonna have to get trying!
I'm sorry. It's just you're the only one who can help.
Please don't give up, Miyafuji.
Are you listening to me?

Yoshika:
I'm the only one?
You're right.
I'm the only one who can help her now.
I'm not giving up!

Perrine:
Thank you...

Yoshika:
I can do this.
Just concentrate...



Doctor:
She's gonna be all right.
That's an amazing magical touch she's got there.

Minna:
Mio...

Minna:
Are you still gonna fly?



Mio:
Shh.

Yoshika:
Oh, sorry.

Mio:
You look pale.
You should try to get some rest yourself.
Thanks again.
Why didn't you shoot?
You know what I'm talking about, Miyafuji.
Why didn't you shoot the Neuroi?

Yoshika:
I just couldn't.
I don't know.

Mio:
Because it was shaped like a human?
That was just a trap to lure you in.

Yoshika:
You sure?
'cause at the time it seemed like... like really wanted to be my friend.

Mio:
It's the enemy. Not your friend.

Perrine:
Major Sakamoto, you're okay...



Minna:
Sergeant Yoshika Miyafuji.
In addition to performing unauthorized actions, you have ignored your superior officer.
These are serious offences.

Yoshika:
Yes, ma'am.

Minna:
As you know I'm the only judicial officer in this squadron, I'll give you the option.
So do you wish for a court-martial to be convened?

Yoshika:
I... um...

Minna:
All right. From your lack of response I will conclude that you do not wish for a court-martial.
Due to violations of orders from a superior with the exceptions of your duties on base daily meals and medical needs,
I'm sentencing you to ten days of confinement.
Do you object?

Yoshika:
No, but... when the Neuroi was shaped like...

Minna:
I'll ask you again. Objections?

Yoshika:
Please just listen to me!

Minna:
Do you object?

Yoshika:
No, ma'am.

Minna:
Then you're dismissed.



Lynne:
Huh? Yoshika! Hi!
The Major's doing better. Isn't that a great news?

Yoshika:
Uh-huh.

Lynne:
Are you happy?

Yoshika:
Uh-huh.

Lynne:
Hmm.
I know! Let's take a bath together!
You're probably drained. This will help!
C'mon! Hurry it up!

Yoshika:
'kay! Just a minute!

Lynne:
Here we are!

Yoshika:
Over here.

Shirley:
Hey, Yoshika. I heard that you got confined your room.
You have lucky. That could actually be fun.

Lucchini:
Yeah. She's been a lot worse, Shirley got the imprisonment penalty 5 times.

Shirley:
Hey, what the hell! It was 4 times. Learn how to count!

Hartmann:
I win. 6 times.

Yoshika:
I have to tell you something.
It's about the Neuroi.
I think the one I met was different from the others.
It was friendly.
It made me think that maybe not all of them are bad.
Maybe you don't have to fight them all...

Barkhorn:
What the hell are you talking about?

Lynne:
Please calm down.

Yoshika:
I'm saying back there I felt like we understood each other.

Barkhorn:
Really? Do you realize what they've done to us all these years?
They've done nothing but terrorize people.
Are you trying to say that you're on their side now?

Yoshika:
I'm just talking about one.
This one was different!

Barkhorn:
Do you really think you fought enough of them to make that distinction?

Hartmann:
I've heard of a human shaped one appearing but never seen one.

Eila:
Did it appear at the Kauhava base? 'cause that's just a rumor.

Sanya:
But wasn't the singing Neuroi human shaped?

Eila:
Who cares? The whole thing was just a trap!

Lucchini:
Yoshika, this is supposed to be relaxing.
Cheer up!
Gotcha!

Yoshika:
Francesca, stop!

Lynne:
Lucchini!

Eila:
So do you think you've got any bigger?

Sanya:
No...

Lucchini:
Yoshika's aren't big enough yet.

Lynne:
Francesca, why are you looking at me like that?
Nooo!

Lucchini:
Shirley.
Now this is what I'm talking about.

Hartmann:
Wow, I wonder if that's any fun.

Barkhorn:
No, it's stupid!
What do you think you're doing!

Hartmann:
Hey, yours are really big and soft, Trudy.

Barkhorn:
These things are completely useless in combat!

Shirley:
These things?

----[A/B part]----

Barkhorn:
All right, Miyafuji. This is it.
You may only leave your room when absolutely necessary.

Yoshika:
Why won't anyone believe me? It's not fair.
Maybe I was wrong.
No.
I wonder. Should I try again?
I have to. I have to find out for myself.

Perrine:
May I start up by saying that you're always too nice to her.
I mean, all you did was take her in and let be a part of saving world.
What'd she do, she turns around and get you injured.
I thought I had lost you.
I mean I know that everything is okay now and you survived and I know...
I know it's most of because of her magic but... just because I don't have power like hers... doesn't mean that she's...

Mio:
Perrine.

Perrine:
I'm sorry.

Mio:
People told me. I know that you never left my side the entire time.
It means a lot. I'm very grateful.

Perrine:
Oh, thank you.

Mio:
Thank you.



Lynne:
Yoshika!

Yoshika:
Oh, Lynne.

Lynne:
Please don't do this. If they find out you left you'll get much worse confinement.

Yoshika:
It's just something I have to do.

Lynne:
Look. I don't know anything about the Neuroi but I know you.
You're someone who doesn't give up.
On anything or anyone you really care about.
That's why... that's why I'm going to go with you!

Yoshika:
What?

Lynne:
I'm gonna go get ready!

Yoshika:
No, Lynne, you can't come!

Lynne:
Why not? 'cause I'm not good enough?

Yoshika:
No, it's not that.
It's just that I really think I need to do this alone.
Please.
I'm sorry.

Lynne:
Please promise you'll come back soon.

Yoshika:
Uh-huh.

Lynne:
I'll be waiting here for you.

Yoshika:
Okay.



Minna:
Sergeant Miyafuji has escaped!

Shirley:
But how?

Hartmann:
Impressive.

Barkhorn:
That idiot!

Minna:
What's wrong with her?
I hope headquarters doesn't find out about this.
We need to bring her back immediately.

Minna:
Hello, this is the 501st.
Yes.
But Your Excellency, she's...
No, I understand completely.

Minna:
Listen up.
Headquarters has commanded us to shoot down Miyafuji.

Lynne:
Huh?



Minna:
I think that's everything.
Perrine, I need you to take care of the major while we're out there.

Perrine:
Right!

Minna:
Hold on a minute, Lynne.

Lynne:
Yes?

Minna:
I'm gonna need you to stay here.
It's just for today.
But I'm gonna need you to stay behind in confinement in Yoshika's place.

Lynne:
Right.

Minna:
What is it with these Witches from Fuso.

Mio:
Atchoo!

Perrine:
Major, are you okay?
Do you need a doctor?

Mio:
No, I'm okay.
So this is all because of her?

Perrine:
Yes. It's because of Yoshika Miyafuji that the whole bases are in uproar.

Mio:
I know.
Perrine, I have a favor to ask of you. And you're the only one who can help me with this.

Perrine:
Oh, right.



Yoshika:
I think I was around here, somewhere.

Yoshika:
Wait!



Hartmann:
They're over there. I can see her now together.

Barkhorn:
Neuroi!
That's the bastard that shot the Major.

Minna:
Wait!

Barkhorn:
What for?

Shirley:
Look! What is that?

Minna:
The Neuroi hive.

Shirley:
Cool...

Hartmann:
I've never seen that before.
So that's where they come from?

Barkhorn:
Many of our allies have attacked in order to try and destroy it.
But damn it! No one's ever been able to get close enough.

Lucchini:
Until now. Yoshika's going inside.

Barkhorn:
She's what?



Yoshika:
It's like a [whole] hall of clouds.



Shirley:
She just went in.

Hartmann:
I don't think anyone's ever done that before.

Barkhorn:
It's all part of their trap!

Lucchini:
I'm going!

Minna:
Get back over here.
I think we should wait while.



Yoshika:
What is this?
Is that the... core?
Is that us?
Sakamoto, no!
A Neuroi fragment?
Where is that?
That's me!



Hartmann:
She still hasn't come out yet.



Yoshika:
Wait! Come back!



Hartmann:
It's the one from before.

Lucchini:
Where's Yoshika?

Shirley:
She's not here.
It was a trap!

Minna:
Everyone, break!

Everyone:
Yes, ma'am!

Barkhorn:
Look!



Yoshika:
Hey, where did you go?



Lucchini:
What do I do?
I've never seen beams like this before.

Shirley:
This is bad.

Hartmann:
Where's the other one?
Just what is that thing?

Minna:
Is that a...

Lucchini:
It's a beam!

Shirley:
Is that thing a Neuroi, too?

Hartmann:
It's really strong!

Shirley:
It took out the Neuroi in one hand.
What is it?

Barkhorn:
I don't know.

Shirley:
That beam. I've never seen power like that.

Lucchini:
Ah! Yoshika!

Shirley:
Hold on!



Perrine:
Um, do you think it'll fit?

Mio:
Yeah. Just a little bit further. Right there. You got it.

Mio:
Looks like it's started.



Lucchini:
Yoshika, are you okay?

Yoshika:
Yeah. Did see where the Neuroi went?

Minna:
Sergeant Miyafuji, you are detained for a crime of absence without leave.
Return to base!

Lucchini:
Hey, you look. Someone's there.

Maloney:
Welcome back, Commander. Very good work.

Hartmann:
It's that thing again!
