Mio:
Impressive.
You've created quite dramatic scene here.

Minna:
Promise me.
Say you won't wear Striker again!

Mio:
Is that an order, Commander?
The reason I ask is that it's hard for me to take you seriously when you're wearing that outfit.

Minna:
Oh, I'm very serious.
If you go into battle again, you'll die.
You're not strong enough, Mio.

Mio:
So you've decided to kill me yourself instead.
Is that what's going on?
Very paradoxical. And not like you at all.

Minna:
You're right.
It's not!

Mio:
I'm sorry.
But I'm still going into battle.

Minna:
Stop!

----[OP]----

Sanya:
(yawn)

Eila:
Whoa!
Hmm. Oh, c'mon. Just for today, but that's it, okay?



Mio:
Got a minute?

Yoshika:
What's in here?

Mio:
I'm sorry.
Should I get someone else?

Yoshika:
No, really. It's not that heavy.

Mio:
Some data for you.
Regarding the recent Neuroi.
Specifically, the singing Neuroi that Sanya intercepted on two occasions.
Each time it appeared various monitoring stations picked up an unusual frequency.
Well, the frequency is unusual, the waveform is very familiar.
It's the same as Sanya's.

Minna:
Oh.

Yoshika:
The song?

Mio:
The Neuroi was mimicking Sanya. Her actions and her voice.

Minna:
I see.

Mio:
We need to rethink our whole analysis.
This should be our top priority.

Minna:
I think you're right.

Mio:
I'd like to inform Hartmann and Barkhorn of this and get them working on it together.
As soon as possible.

Yoshika:
Um, sorry, just that you should know, Barkhorn's not here.
She and Hartmann left earlier today.

Mio:
Where'd they go?

Yoshika:
London.

Mio:
London?

Yoshika:
Yeah. Apparently her sister woke up. She's not in coma anymore.
She was so happy.
When she heard the news she immediately put on a Striker to fly there but the others talked her out of it.
That was really weird. She's usually so calm.

Minna:
Well, that makes sense.
And I don't blame her at all.
Barkhorn's sister is the very reason she's fighting.
I think we all have someone like that. Someone who we will defend at all costs.
Sometimes that's the only way to summon any courage to fight at all.

Yoshika:
Yeah.



Nurse:
This is a hospital. Be quiet please.

Barkhorn:
I'm so sorry, miss.
I was in a hurry to get here.
Chris...

Barkhorn:
Hi...

Chris:
Good to see you.
Thank so much for coming.
Were you okay without me?

Barkhorn:
Of course, yes!
I'm just fine. Why wouldn't I be?
Is that what you think of me?

Hartmann:
She was a complete wreck.
The nightmares were making her cry out.
"Oh my sister, when will my baby sister ever wake up?"

Chris:
Is that true?

Barkhorn:
You shut your mouth!
This is supposed be a happy reunion!

Hartmann:
But it's true.

Barkhorn:
I am a dedicated soldier of Karlsland.
I get people nightmares, got it?

Chris:
Well, sister, you look happy.

Barkhorn:
Really?

Hartmann:
You can thank Miyafuji for that.

Chris:
Who's Miyafuji?

Hartmann:
Well, she's a newest recruit to the Strike Witches.

Chris:
Huh?

Barkhorn:
She looks a little bit like you.

Chris:
Like me?
Do you think I can meet her?

Barkhorn:
Why not? I think you need to stop by the base.

Chris:
Can I?
Do you think she'll be my friend?

Barkhorn:
Well, she is little bit odd, but she is nice.
I'm sure that two of you will be great friends.
You two may look alike, but you're much cuter. Absolutely.

Hartmann:
Wow, no bias there.



Hartmann:
So who left this?

Barkhorn:
Ahh, no clue.

Hartmann:
Let's see.
Mina Dietlinde Wilcke.

Barkhorn:
Well, that's odd.



Perrine:
Major Sakamoto!
Why do I always have to hide?
I should just go tell her. Here I go.
I don't know what's changed.
It used be easy to be around her.
What turn me into a nervous [wrecker] as to hide when I see her.
It's all Miyafuji's fault.
Ever since that brat came here I've changed!
Excuse me, Major Sakamoto?
I was hoping to learn your reverse corkscrew or perhaps you could teach me the [floor pass leg lock].
Miyafuji's room? Why would she go in there?
Why must my leg [be so felt unconcerted from] disappointments!

Yoshika:
Ma'am, you wanted to talk to me?

Mio:
Yes.
But at ease. This is your quarters.

Yoshika:
Yes, ma'am.

Mio:
You did great.
In yesterday's fight. Your first core kill, right?

Yoshika:
That's right.
But it was thanks to all of the Witches. Especially you.
Because you trained me. You told me how to stay focused.
You're the best teacher I've ever had.

Mio:
Ahahaha!
That was well said, Miyafuji.
It's true. You're still young.
Who knows how much potential you have.
I'm going to have to do everything in my power to find out.
That means training you harder than ever before.
Therefore, starting tomorrow, I'm going to triple your training resume.
How does that sound?

Perrine:
I want triple training...

Lynne:
Um...

Perrine:
Don't sneak up a people like that, okay?

Mio:
Perrine.
And Lynne.
What are the two of you doing out here?

Lynne:
Ah, I saw Perrine here... and...

Perrine:
Shh!

Yoshika:
What's wrong with you, Perrine?
Your face is all red.

Perrine:
There isn't anything wrong in my face!
It just turns red sometimes.

Yoshika:
You could have a fever.

Perrine:
You leave me alone!
My face is fine!

Mio:
Enough of this.
All of you report for extra training.

Lynne:
Oh, that reminds me. Yoshika, I have a message to give you.

Mio:
Well, stop wasting time. Get ready!

Everyone:
Yes, ma'am!



Perrine:
Miyafuji, you've got Francesca closing in from behind!

Yoshika:
Ah, okay!

Lucchini:
Ha! I've got you!

Perrine:
That technique...

Lynne:
This round is Perrine and Miyafuji's.
Way to go, Yoshika!

Lucchini:
How we lose?
That's so weird. A couple of more seconds and I've gotten her.

Shirley:
You're really growing into this, Miyafuji.

Yoshika:
Really? Thank you!

Lucchini:
I'll be the judge of that!

Yoshika:
You let go!

Lucchini:
No. [Nothing is] growing into anything around here.
That's such a tragedy.

Shirley:
That's true.

Yoshika:
C'mon, you guys!

Shirley:
But your fighting skills have gotten better.

Yoshika:
You think so?

Lucchini:
But you have no chance against me in high altitude.

Yoshika:
Hey, Perrine, we just might make a better team than we thought.

Perrine:
I don't think so. Not in a million years.



Lynne:
Well, you're just so amazing, Yoshika.
You're the newest Witch here but it's like you've been here forever.

Yoshika:
C'mon! You think so?
I bet Barkhorn would say I'm still a rookie with a long way to go.

Lynne:
So then I must have even longer way to go. Wow.
I'm so jealous of you.

Yoshika:
But there's sure some things you can't practice in order to make them better.

Lynne:
Oh, yeah? Like what?

Yoshika:
Just... some things.



Perrine:
Miyafuji!
Where did you learn that reversal technique you used in training?

Yoshika:
Perrine. Hey, when did you show up?

Perrine:
I've been here the whole time!
The corkscrew reversal is Major Sakamoto's technique.
When did she teach it to you?

Yoshika:
She didn't teach it to me.
I just watched and that looked kinda fun.

Perrine:
Don't you lie to me!
It's much too difficult. Or [us] all be doing it by now.
Yes, I bet she's been teaching you in secret, hasn't she?
It's not fair!

Yoshika:
Hold on.
I'm not lying to you.

Perrine:
So, you're still trying to play innocent.
It doesn't work on me.

Yoshika:
What doesn't work on you?

Perrine:
That's it!

Yoshika:
Now what?

Perrine:
A duel!
That's the only way we're ever going to settle this matter.

Yoshika:
A duel?



Barkhorn:
I apologize but I opened it to see what was inside.
"Don't get involved. You know too much."
What does that mean?

Hartmann:
Very intriguing.

Mio:
Minna has nothing to hide.
Right, Commander?

Minna:
Oh, I'm sorry. That's right. No secrets.
We've simply been investigating the Neuroi further.

Barkhorn:
So what does this note have to do with that?

Hartmann:
Any idea who might have sent it to you?

Mio:
Too many of them to keep track of.

Minna:
It's true.
There are many in the military who voice their opposition to us.
I'm sure they'd love to see the Witches disbanded.

Mio:
But I can take a guess as to who would send such a foolish warning.
There's one reason he did.
He must have gotten his hands on something big.
I don't know what.
We're close to it or he wouldn't be scared.

Barkhorn:
Who is he?

Mio:
Trevor Maloney.
He's a general in the air force.



Perrine:
We're not using those.

Yoshika:
We're not? How come?

Perrine:
We're dueling. Which of course means using the real guns.

Yoshika:
No! I don't want to.
I can't shoot at you using a real gun!

Perrine:
Please. We're not actually going to shoot at each other with them.
It just makes it feel more real.

Yoshika:
That's so dumb!
There's no way I'm going to risk accidentally shooting another Witch!

Perrine:
You're scared?
But you're always so confident.
And now you know that I'm going to show you up.
Don't worry. It's just for show.

---[A/B part]---

Perrine:
Miyafuji, can you read me?
The first person tail the other for 10 seconds wins. Simple as that.
You think you can handle it?

Yoshika:
It's okay. My safety zone.

Perrine:
There she is.

Perrine:
C'mon, almost there.
What[Why] don't you stop moving around so much!?



Perrine:
It's the alarm!

Yoshika:
Do you think it's the Neuroi?



Minna:
One unit. Sector 23. East grid. On the direct course for London.

Perrine:
Commander, this is Perrine.
Miyafuji and I are up training. We're closest to that location.
We will intercept!

Minna:
Training now?
I never authorized extra training.
Your orders are to maintain your current position.
Understood?

Perrine:
Yes, ma'am.

Minna:
Mio!

Yoshika:
Perrine!

Perrine:
You heard the commander.
We're supposed to stay right here.

Yoshika:
I'm not gonna wait. Bye!

Perrine:
Wait! Don't!

Yoshika:
We can't let it get away!

Perrine:
You're in violation of direct order. Get back here!

Yoshika:
Don't worry about me, Perrine.
I'll try to slow it down till the others can get here.

Perrine:
Wait! You have to come back! Miyafuji!



Minna:
Mio.
So you're really gonna fly?
But you can't. I saw it.
Your shield stopped working during the last battle.

Mio:
True.
I've done a lot of thinking about it.
I'm already 20. My powers aren't strong as they used be.
It doesn't matter how hard I train.
I'm a Witch and in the end we all have the same fate.

Minna:
Then why push yourself?

Mio:
I've outlived a lot of other people in this war.
Even so, my place is in the sky.

Minna:
This is about Miyafuji, isn't it?
She'll be fine on her own.
No Witch has more training than her.
You've done enough.

Mio:
Not quite. Miyafuji still has much to learn and much more that she's capable of doing.
Before long now, she's going have to lead the Witches.
She shouldn't be content to simply stay in the background for the rest of her life.
I'm so sorry. As long as I can still fly, I have to.

Minna:
Mio...



Yoshika:
Where is it? I should be getting close by now.
Found it!

Yoshika:
It's so small. But it has to be a Neuroi.
I should be able to take this one down by myself.
The safety's still on!
Got it!
What's going on?
It looks like a human.



Mio:
You're saying she went after it by herself?

Perrine:
I'm sorry. It's actually my fault she was out in the first place.

Mio:
Save it till after we take down the Neuroi.

Perrine:
Yes, ma'am.

Mio:
Don't get any funny ideas, Miyafuji.



Yoshika:
The other Neuroi started imitating Sanya singing.
Could they be trying to be like us?
What if... what if they're trying to communicate with us?
Oh, it's flying like a Witch.
Wait! Wait just a minute!

Yoshika:
So, um... it's nice to meet you. I mean, what's your name?
Wait. Do Neuroi have names?
You're pretty different from the other Neuroi, huh?



Minna:
Miyafuji is there.
She has to have somehow made contact with the Neuroi.
However, beyond that, Sanya can't tell us anything further.

Sanya:
I'm sorry.

Eila:
You mean... that she might be captured?



Mio:
What's happening? Why don't you order her back towards us?
We keep trying to contact her with no luck.

Minna:
Same here. We've [xxx] all the frequencies twice.
But all of our transmissions are jammed.

Mio:
Miyafuji...!



Yoshika:
Are you trying to play game with me?
Hey! Wait up! C'mon!
You're too quick for me.

Yoshika:
I'm laughing. I'm laughing with the Neuroi.

Yoshika:
Hey!
I just don't understand. You don't act like you could be our enemy.



Mio:
How far off are they now, Minna?

Minna:
The Neuroi has turned back toward Gallia.
It might be returning to the hive.

Mio:
They could be leading her into a trap!
It looks like another Witch with her.
But I can see a core! That's a Neuroi!

Mio:
What do you think you're doing, Miyafuji?

Yoshika:
Sakamoto!

Mio:
Shoot that thing! Shoot it, Miyafuji!

Yoshika:
Sakamoto! You don't understand!

Mio:
What are you waiting for? Just shoot it!

Yoshika:
No, please wait!

Mio:
Don't be fooled! It's just mimicking you!

Yoshika:
No, it's not! Please just wait!

Mio:
Then I'll do it!
Damn you!

Perrine:
Major!

Yoshika:
Sakamoto!
Sakamoto!

Perrine:
Major!

Minna:
What was that?
What just happened?

Yoshika:
Sakamoto was shot by the Neuroi!

Barkhorn:
She put up her shield but she's hurt pretty badly!

Minna:
Listen to me, Lieutenant. You will pursue the Neuroi!

Barkhorn:
But the major needs attention!

Minna:
Pursue right now!

Barkhorn:
Understood...

Sanya:
Commander Minna...

Minna:
Mio...

Perrine:
Major, please be okay...

Yoshika:
Please open your eyes.
Can you hear me?
Sakamoto, please, answer. Sakamoto!

----[ED]----

Why won't anyone listen to me.
Nobody believes me.
I've got a proof what I've felt with that Neuroi.
Next time on Strike Witches "I Want You to Believe."
