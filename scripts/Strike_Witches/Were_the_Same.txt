  ----[OP]----

Minna:
Your displeasure is written all over your face.
Calm yourself, Major.

Mio:
They call us all the way over there and then start telling us how the budget is totally fubar.
Of course I'm pissed off. They owe us!

Minna:
They're just panicking.
We're currently the only ones consistently getting results at this point.

Mio:
They're not going to see anything other than what they want until it's far too late.

Minna:
That's just how the warmongers behave.
If the Neuroi had never shown up, they would have you, me, and everyone on this team split into sides and killing each other instead.

Mio:
Those damn bankers think they run the world.
Sorry about that, Miyafuji.
I really wanted to show you around Britannia so you could know how beautiful her people could be.

Yoshika:
It's okay. I was actually just thinking how everyone in the military is so different.
Um... do you hear something?

Mio:
That's just Sanya singing.
We're approaching the base. She came to escort us.

Yoshika:
Thank, Sanya!

Yoshika:
Is Sanya really shy? She just pulled away.

Minna:
She may be a little shy but she has a pretty voice. She is a good girl.
Hold on.

Mio:
What is it, Sanya?

Sanya:
Someone is looking at us.

Mio:
Someone is what? Repeat that, please.
I'm having trouble reading your transmission.

Sanya:
I'm sorry.
There is an unknown bogey inbound from the direction of Sirius at high speed.
(bogey: enemy aircraft)

Minna:
So is it a Neuroi?

Sanya:
Yes, I believe it's them.
Its speed is too great to be a normal aircraft.

Mio:
I don't see anything, Sanya.

Sanya:
It's in the clouds.
Target cannot be acquired visually.

Mio:
So that's how it is.

Yoshika:
Umm, Major, what are we supposed to do?

Mio:
Nothing we can do.

Yoshika:
We're trapped here?

Minna:
Without our Strikers Units we're just regular passengers on this plane.
Do you think they planned it this way?

Mio:
The Neuroi aren't capable of such complicated strategies.

Sanya:
Target is still inbound, fast. Contact in 3 minutes.

Minna:
Sanya, try to buy us time until backup arrives.
Avoid a direct engagement if possible.

Sanya:
Yes, ma'am.
I'll draw their fire away from the transport.

Minna:
Don't do anything reckless.

Mio:
Watch closely, Miyafuji.

Yoshika:
Okay.
Sanya can find Neuroi even you can't see?

Mio:
Yes. Her magical abilities allow her to see what lies beyond even the horizon.

Yoshika:
Wow...

Minna:
That' why we always have her assigned night patrol.
It's where she makes sense.

Mio:
It's no different than your healing magic.
You heard her song, right?
That's one of her spells.
She uses it to guide the transport.

Sanya:
No return fire.

Minna:
Just as I thought.
She's able to battle them before they're even visible.

Yoshika:
I can't see any Neuroi at all.

Mio:
You can take Sanya's word for it.
Sanya, that's enough. Return to base.

Sanya:
But it's not...

Mio:
Good work. You were able to protect us by yourself.



Hartmann:
It's raining so hard. I can't see a thing!

Barkhorn:
Wait, look over there!

Eila:
Sanya!


Perrine:
Hold on, Eila. You can't go alone!

Barkhorn:
No, she'll be fine. Looks like it's all over.



Barkhorn:
So, nobody actually saw the Neuroi except Sanya?

Mio:
It stayed hidden in the clouds and never showed its face.

Hartmann:
'kay. But I heard it didn't even bother trying to shoot back at her.
When does a Neuroi do that?
Are we even certain that it really was a Neuroi?

Lynne:
Maybe it was a shy Neuroi.
... or maybe not.
Sorry...

Perrine:
No, it's true. Maybe they were connecting on the same wavelength like sisters, perhaps.

Minna:
How a Neuroi thinks is not known.
We need a clear picture of their intentions.
Until we have that, there's no way to predict what they will do next.

Mio:
There is a high likelihood this Neuroi that failed would return over and over again till it succeeds.

Minna:
I agree.
Because of that very reason, I'm going to set up a special units specifically for night missions.
Sanya.

Sanya:
Ma'am?

Minna:
Miyafuji.

Yoshika:
Ah? Yeah?

Minna:
Starting immediately, the two of you will constitute the new night combat team.

Yoshika:
Are you really sure you want me?

Mio:
You're the only other one with experience with this Neuroi.

Yoshika:
But I only sat there and watched...

Eila:
I'd like to volunteer for night combat!

Minna:
That's great.
So Eila makes three total for the night patrol.
We'll have to rework the rotation schedule a bit to accommodate your shift.

Sanya:
Sorry. This is all because I let the Neuroi get away...

Yoshika:
No, nobody said that, Sanya!

Sanya:
Hmm.



Perrine:
Blueberries. Why do we have so many, huh?

Lynne:
My uncle ships them here all the way from our farm back home.
Blueberries are supposed be really good for your eyesight.

Hartmann:
Let's eat!

Barkhorn:
Yes, it's true. In Britannia all the night pilots eat Blueberries.
It's likely they discovered their benefits as well.

Lucchini:
Yoshika, Shirley! Stick out your tongues!

Yoshika & Shirley:
Hmm? Hmm...
Ahahaha!

Perrine:
Typical!

Eila:
Perrine...

Mio:
Everything in moderation.

Perrine:
How could you do such a thing to me!

Eila:
I didn't do anything.

Sanya:
Delicious.



Mio:
You finished your breakfast. That's good.
It's time for you three to go to sleep.
Dismissed.


Yoshika:
Huh?

Yoshika:
But we just woke up.
And did they really have to come and cover up all the windows, too?

Eila:
They probably want us to get used to the dark.

Yoshika:
Sorry, they turned your room into such a dark cave, Sanya.

Sanya:
They didn't. This is how I like my room.

Yoshika:
Oh, really?
Hey! These are some type of talisman.

Eila:
Talisman?

Yoshika:
Some people think they're good luck charms that scare away ghosts.

Sanya:
People sometimes mistake me for a ghost.

Yoshika:
Yeah? Because you're always playing around at night?

Sanya:
Uh-uh.
Happens a lot during the day.
They say they can't tell if I'm really there or not.

Eila:
Don't pay attention to anything Miss Priss Four-Eyes says.
If you're bored I've got tarot cards.

Yoshika:
Tarot cards?

Eila:
It's fortune telling.
I can use my magic to see into the future.
I can't see very far, though...
Now, let's see.
Well, this is good!
You're going to see someone you've been longing to see!

Yoshika:
Is that true?
It's not. That's not possible.

Eila:
Why not?

Yoshika:
Because that person isn't coming back.

Eila:
I see. Hmmmm, I don't know what to tell you, then!



Lucchini:
Time to wake up! It's night!



Yoshika:
It's dark in here.

Lynne:
Uh-huh. They said it's to help your eyes adjust to flying during night time missions.

Yoshika:
What's this?

Perrine:
It's a special merigold herbal tea!
I've heard it can help your eyesight just as much as blueberries.

Lynne:
Oh really? I heard that that was just an old wives tale.

Perrine:
What? I've never met such an insolent brat in all my life!
This secret recipe is my grandmother's!

Lynne:
I'm sorry.

Yoshika:
This smells like Sansho.

Lynne:
Sansho?

Lucchini:
Lynne and Yoshika, stick out your tongues!

Eila:
She's got a point.

Perrine:
This isn't a contest!
I was just trying to be helpful!

Eila:
Yuck.



Yoshika:
My hands won't stop shaking.

Eila:
Why?

Yoshika:
I didn't think the sky would actually look this black at night.

Eila:
Is that's your first night time mission?

Sanya:
Do you wanna scrub it?

Yoshika:
Will you both hold my hands?
I'm sure I could do it if you hold my hands, Sanya.

Eila:
Let's get going.

Yoshika:
Wait! I have to... ah... I'm not ready yet! No!
Please don't let go my hands! Promise you'll hang on to me!

Sanya:
Wait just another minute.
We're almost above the clouds.

Yoshika:
It's beautiful!
I could've never made it up here on my own!
Sanya, Eila, thank you!

Sanya:
It's okay. It's our job.

--------[A part/B part]--------

Perrine:
What's this?

Yoshika:
Liver oil. From a Lamprey.
It's good for eyesight and temperament.

Hartmann:
It smells kinda fishy.

Barkhorn:
It's fish oil. The nutritious benefits should more than outweigh the difficult flavor.

Perrine:
Are we back in the kindergarten, Yoshika?
What an absurd choice?

Mio:
Is that so?
I'm the one who brought it.

Perrine:
I love fish oil.

Lucchini:
Ewww. What's this?

Shirley:
Tastes pretty similar to engine lubricant.

Mio:
I was forced to drink this as a cadet and I couldn't stand it either.

Perrine:
I couldn't agree with you more.

Minna:
Another round?



Yoshika:
Um... Eila and Sanya, where are the two of you from before all this?

Eila:
I'm from Suomus.

Sanya:
Orussia.

Yoshika:
Oh, where were those again?

Eila:
Suomus is in the northern part of Europe.
Orussia is in the east.

Yoshika:
All right. Wasn't most of Europe destroyed by the Neuroi in the first round of attacks?

Sanya:
Yes. The city I lived in fell a long time ago.

Yoshika:
What happened to your family?

Sanya:
When the Neuroi came they fled the city and took shelter further east.
Much further east. Over the Ural Mountains.

Yoshika:
Thank goodness for that.

Eila:
What's so good about that? Don't you hear what she is telling you?

Yoshika:
Well, they may be far apart right now but at least they can get back together someday...

Eila:
Huh, Orussia is a huge place.
"past the Ural" is dozens of times the size of Fuso.
It's not so easy to find people once you've lost them.
Besides, there's a Neuroi hive between here and there.

Yoshika:
I see what you mean.
But I'm still little jealous.

Eila:
You're kinda stubborn, aren't you?

Yoshika:
You don't understand. What I mean is... you wanna see your family again, right, Sanya?

Sanya:
Yes.

Yoshika:
Well, I bet they wake up every morning just like you.
Thinking and wondering about the day that you'll be reunited as a family.

Sanya:
Yes.

Yoshika:
If neither of you ever gives up, then someday you'll have to be together again.
And it must be so wonderful to be able to think that way.



Sanya:
Hmm...

Yoshika:
I feel so yucky.

Eila:
Then why don't we go to the Sauna?

Yoshika:
Sauna?

Eila:
C'mon, you've never been to a sauna before?



Yoshika:
Um, Eila, this is getting really boring...

Eila:
In Suomus, we like saunas more than baths.

Yoshika:
Sany, your skin is so white.

Sanya:
Hmm?

Eila:
Hey, what are you looking at?

Yoshika:
Nothing. She just has really pretty skin.

Eila:
Stop looking at Sanya like that!



Eila:
It's right over here.

Yoshika:
You sure this is okay?

Eila:
Bathing after a sauna is a must.

Yoshika:
Water is nice and cold but...

Eila:
Calm down. It's just us girls out here.

Yoshika:
It's not that I...

Sanya:
(singing)

Eila:
When I hear her. Her song. It makes my heart ache.

Yoshika:
Yeah.

Yoshika:
I'm sorry!

Sanya:
What are you apologizing for?

Yoshika:
Well, we didn't mean to interrupt you...
That song, it's so beautiful!

Sanya:
My father, he wrote that song for me a long time ago when I was a little girl.

Yoshika:
Your father?

Sanya:
One day many years ago, when I was little, I was stuck inside because of the rain.
I was counting raindrops out of boredom.
And my father turned it into a song for me.

Eila:
Sanya went on to study music in Vienna at her father's recommendation.

Yoshika:
Sounds like a wonderful man.

Sanya:
Your father was a wonderful man, too, Miyafuji.

Yoshika:
Huh? Why is that?

Eila:
That's easy. Because Dr. Miyafuji was the one who invented the Striker Unit that you wear.
That's a special connection between you.

Yoshika:
That's true.
But it's not really the typical present that father gets for his little girl.

Eila:
Don't be so picky.
Those units are expensive.



Yoshika:
Hey, guess what? You'll never guess but today is my birthday!

Eila:
Why didn't tell us it was?

Yoshika:
I usually ignore it. Because it's also the day that my father died.
It's a long story and I didn't wanna explain it to everyone.

Eila:
Well, that's just plain stupid.
If it's your birthday, then we're obligated to have some fun, right?

Yoshika:
Are you sure about that?

Eila:
Of course.

Sanya:
Miyafuji, I want you to listen closely.

Yoshika:
Okay.

Yoshika:
Hey, I can hear something.

Eila:
It's the radio.

Sanya:
At night, the sky is quiet.
So I can pick up radio waves from distant places over the horizon.

Yoshika:
That's amazing. I have no idea you could do that.

Sanya:
Yes. It keeps me company while I'm flying at night.

Eila:
I thought this was our little secret.

Sanya:
I'm sorry. But tonight is a special occasion.

Eila:
It's your magic. Do what you want.

Yoshika:
What's wrong?

Sanya:
You'll see.

Eila:
Tonight just also happens to be...

Eila:
What?
What is it?

Yoshika:
It's a song.

Eila:
But how could...

Minna:
Is this the Neuroi's voice?

Mio:
It's mimicking Sanya's frequency.
Where is she?

Minna:
According to the schedule, she's in the middle of the night training mission with Sergeant Miyafuji.

Mio:
Call them back now!

Minna:
We can't. The song is blocking our signal.

Mio:
Damn it! They're after Sanya!

Sanya:
Its sounds... like...

Eila:
Is it the Neuroi, Sanya?

Yoshika:
The Neuroi? Where?

Sanya:
You need to leave right now!

Eila:
Sanya!
You, idiot! Why fight him alone?

Sanya:
The enemy is after me.
I can feel it.
You have to get away from me.
If you're here...

Eila:
C'mon, what are you talking about?

Yoshika:
We can never do that!

Sanya:
Please go.

Yoshika:
You can't see it!

Eila:
Sanya is going to tell me where that Neuroi is hiding.
After that, I'll be able to predict the enemy's movement short term with my magic so I'll be fine.
You're not the same as that thing, Sanya.
It may be alone. But you've got us. Together we can't be defeated.

Sanya:
Neuroi inbound, from the intersect line, 2 degrees off Vega and Altair.
Distance to target, 3,200m.

Eila:
Here?

Sanya:
It's accelerating. A little more lead. That's good. Three seconds.

Eila:
Take this!

Eila:
Did I miss?

Sanya:
No, it's decelerating.
It's sustained heavy damage.
It's coming back!

Eila:
Oh no you don't!

Yoshika:
It dodged it!

Eila:
Damn it! Show yourself!
It's there!

Sanya:
Eila, stop, get out of here!

Eila:
There's no time!
Good thinking, Miyafuji!

Yoshika:
We've got this! We're not gonna lose to that thing!

Eila:
'cause we are a team!



Eila:
I can still hear it.

Yoshika:
Why? Didn't we destroy it?

Sanya:
No. That's my father's piano.

Yoshika:
I see. The radio.
It's reaching to us from somewhere down there.
Wherever he is. It's miracle!

Eila:
To be expected really.

Yoshika:
Huh?

Eila:
After all it is Sanya's birthday today, too.
Technically yesterday, but, you know.

Yoshika:
It's the same day as mine?

Eila:
What better way for a father to celebrate his daughter's birthday and to play the song he wrote for her.
That kind of love allows for moments like this.
For those who are open to feel it, it's no miracle.

Yoshika:
Eila, you're so nice.

Eila:
No, I am not, idiot.

Yoshika:
Idiot?

Sanya:
Oh mother, oh father, your daughter is listening. I'm right here.

Yoshika:
A happy birthday, right, Sanya?

Sanya:
You, too.
I hope you had a happy birthday. Miyafuji.

Eila:
Happy birthday.

Yoshika:
Thank you both.



Mio:
The Neuroi had its sights on Sanya this time.
It even adapted to her actions, mimicking them.

Minna:
It's quite obvious that we're going to have to start re-thinking the way we approach combat with the Neuroi.

Mio:
Do you think command is aware of any of this?

Minna:
I don't know.
It's possible they could know even more than we do.

Mio:
We can't let our guard down for a second.

----[ED]----

Yoshika's a little twerp who gets on your nerves.
Shirley's a giant pumpkin [within] super carrots.
Lynne's the super ace at least that's what I think.
Barkhorn is the pretty one and I'm the one who stinks!
