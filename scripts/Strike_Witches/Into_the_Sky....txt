Yoshika:
That's the...

Maloney:
Nicely done, Commander Minna.

Minna:
I guess you're in charge, right? General Maloney.

Maloney:
Yes, I am.
Here's a copy of the official transport order.
So, Commander Mina. As of now, this base is under the direct command of the 1st Atrategic Airborne Assault Team.
That's mouthful to say so we refer it to as Warlock.

Minna:
Warlock?

Maloney:
Now that I have all the Witches present.
Am I addressing Sergeant Yoshika Miyafuji.

Yoshika:
Sir.

Maloney:
You left the base in breach of military regulations.
Isn't that right?

Yoshika:
Oh, no...
I've seen that!

Maloney:
Are you referring to the Warlock?

Yoshika:
Yes, I've seen it.
It was in a room with the Neuroi. Some sort of laboratory.

Maloney:
You don't know what you talking about!

Yoshika:
That's not true, I saw it!

Maloney:
Answer my question now.
You deserted your squad. Correct?

Yoshika:
Yes... but I...

Maloney:
And you. I issued you orders to shoot this deserter down a moment you might contact.

Minna:
Yes, but sir!

Maloney:
A junior officer flying military hardware in violation of house arrest,
a senior officer disobeying shoot to kill orders from a general.
The break down in the chain of command is clear.
At times like this I am left with no other options to preserve military order.
Commander Minna, be advised. The 501st Joint Fighter Wing has been dissolved.
The Strike Witches are officially disbanded.
You have each been reassigned back to your home country's main unit.
That is all.
Is that understood, Commander?

Minna:
Understood, sir.

Yoshika:
No... the Witches are disbanded...

Maloney:
Your unauthorized actions were the cause of all this, Sergeant Miyafuji.

Yoshika:
But I... I... I just...

Maloney:
No need to worry. We'll be fine.
The Warlock has been designed to completely annihilate the Neuroi.
Britannia no longer needs the protection of Witches.

----[OP]----

Yoshika:
Hey.
Where is everyone?
Where'd you go?

Lynne:
Yoshika. Yoshika.
Yoshika, wake up.
You're all right. That's good.

Yoshika:
Hey, Lynne, everyone.
What's up?

Lynne:
You collapsed on the runaway after we heard.

Minna:
It's probably the combination of shock and fatigue that caused you to pass out.

Yoshika:
No! There's something not right about that Warlock thing.
Hey, I bet if we all just looked into it...
Um, Lynne. What's wrong?

Lynne:
It's orders. We are now left with any other choice except go back to our home countries.

Yoshika:
So then the Witches are really disbanded? It's true?

Lynne:
Yeah...

Yoshika:
Then... it's my fault. Sorry...

Lynne:
No, it's not.

Yoshika:
I'm so sorry. I should never come. I'm so stupid...

Lynne:
You're not. We are all with you.

Lucchini:
Cheer up. It'll be fine!

Yoshika:
I'm sorry... It's all my fault...



Mio:
Let's go.

Yoshika:
Okay.



Lucchini:
Wow, I hope that thing can make it to Romagna.

Shirley:
Big deal!
I have to cross the Atlantic in that bucket after dropping you off.




Sailor:
General Maloney, all Witches have vacated the area.

Sailor:
That's good news.

Maloney:
Like hell that's good news, Lieutenant.
We couldn't possibly ask for worse timing.
Coming out under the openness early was not our plan.
We currently only have one operational Warlock.

Sailor:
But sir, we couldn't stay hidden forever.

Maloney:
That's true. But our time table acceleration is all that little girl's fault.
If she hadn't made contact with the Neuroi we could have progressed as planned with the Warlock anonymously.

Sailor:
Do you think that it was wise to let her return to Fuso?

Maloney:
What do we have to fear from a Witch without a Striker Unit.
She's only [a?] little girl.
We have nothing to worry about.

Perrine:
Farewell, Britannia. I'll miss you.

Mio:
Perrine, I'm sorry. By making you take me all the way to Fuso.

Perrine:
Don't worry. I prefer to be of use to you, Major.
Besides, it's not like I really have any home to return to.

Mio:
Sergeant Miyafuji, I'm sorry.
When I brought you here I had no idea it will end this way.
Britannia is a long way away from your family and Fuso.

Yoshika:
Please don't. There's no need to be sorry.
I only wish I could've been more help to the Witches.
As it is it's my fault we're all going home.
But still... I can't regret the opportunity to be at that base.
Everything I've learned and all the wonderful people.
How always treasure every moment with the Strike Witches.

Mio:
That's good.



Minna:
Their surveillance is finally stopped.

Barkhorn:
Maybe we should've just gone back to Karlsland.
At least there we would no Witch enemy we're really fighting against.

Hartmann:
Huh?

Barkhorn:
What's wrong?

Hartmann:
It was your idea for us to come back here.

Barkhorn:
Well, yeah... because... Miyafuji... that's all.

Hartmann:
I know.
She's [her xxx/hard to resist].

Barkhorn:
It's just... we... we at least owe it to her to uncover what's really been going on.
I couldn't call myself a true soldier of Karlsland and I get...

Minna:
It's okay. I think you've explained enough.
Besides, I'm still concerned about what Miyafuji said before.

Hartmann:
You mean about being friends with the Neuroi?

Minna:
No. About seeing visions of the Warlock with the Neuroi.
From his reaction to Miyafuji's stories it appeared General Malonely was hiding something.
We need to figure out just what he's up to.

Barkhorn:
If the general's acting without orders, that will give us enough reason to take him down.

Minna:
Absolutely.

Barkhorn:
Good.

Minna:
The question is what is our first priority.

Hartmann:
Hey! How about a ride!
Hi!
You jerk!
You wouldn't know sexy if it bit you!

----[A/B part]----

Sailor:
Warlock unit 0, ready for take off.

Sailor:
Coordinates set, for the Gallia region.

Maloney:
Go!

Sailor:
Warlock unit 0, go for launch!

Sailor:
Transformation to flight mode, complete.
Course confirmed to Gallia region.
Cruising at sub sonic speed.

Maloney:
Perfect.
The Warlock outperforms those Witches in every way.
All our research is finally paying off.

Sailor:
But sir, the chief engineering feels it's still too soon to put a Warlock into a combat without a proper testing.

Maloney:
I'm aware of his concerns.
But, with the Witches now exiled, we aren't left with any other option.
The Warlock must produce results.
With the Neuroi eliminated our new hardware should put us at the top of the world food chain.

Barkhorn:
They're already trying to control Gallia.

Hartmann:
Busy beavers.

Minna:
If they can use this opportunity to demonstrate the Warlock's superior abilities
they'll gain the approval to begin mass-production.
The Warlock's strong.
But I can't believe they're going into battle with just one unit.

Hartmann:
It still seems like there's something else they're trying to hide about the Warlock.

Barkhorn:
This is a perfect chance to see what they're up to.
What's wrong?

Hartmann:
You're excited. Is this all for Miyafuji?

Barkhorn:
No! That's not it!

Minna:
Let's keep our eyes on them.

Hartmann:
Right.



Shirley:
It's the Warlock.

Lucchini:
I don't like that sound.

Shirley:
I wonder where it's going.

Lucchini:
Stupid!

Shirley:
[Hey,] now.


Mio:
Bring me opposite side!

Perrine:
Yes, ma'am.

Mio:
They're going to Gallia.

Perrine:
That shouldn't take long.

Yoshika:
The Neuroi hive.

Mio:
Destroyed it in one shot!

Perrine:
That thing is unbelievable!

Mio:
I don't get it. How did the Warlock get access to Neuroi beam technology?
What is it, Miyafuji?

Yoshika:
That's it!
The Neuroi was showing it to me.
She wanted me to know that they met before.

Mio:
There's only one way the Warlock could talk to the Neuroi.

Perrine:
But that's impossible!
They Neuroi are our sworn enemy.
If they obtained Neuroi technology they would've told us by now.
It just doesn't make any sense to keep that from us.

Yoshika:
But...

Mio:
Normally I'd say you're crazy.
However it all adds up...
It would seem as if the Neuroi aren't the Witch's only enemy.
Well then it looks your rebellious actions may not have been in vain after all.

Yoshika:
Huh?



Sailor:
Warlock unit 0 has taken out the Neuroi.

Maloney:
Yes. That's right.
Our power has already exceeded that of the Neuroi.

Sailor:
What's that?
What's going on, soldier?

Sailor:
Two Neuroi craft, inbound.

Sailor:
Not 2, it's 3.

Sailor:
What?

Sailor:
Who cares. Destroy them all.

Mio:
That's strange.
The Neuroi has completely changed its attack pattern.
What's this?
I don't understand.

Sailor:
Now there're 8 Neuroi, no, 9.

Researcher:
The Warlock is reached its maximum capacity.

Maloney:
Activate the Warlock's core hijacking system!

Engineer:
But we only have one Warlock active.
It takes 5 to generate enough residence to control the core field, sir.

Sailor:
Core controlling system has been activated remotely!

Sailor:
What?
Engineer:
I don't know how but the Warlock has activated the core hijacking system on its own.



Yoshika:
What's happening?

Mio:
I've never seen that many Neuroi!



Sailor:
The Warlock's core control system is functioning perfectly.

Sailor:
It now has control of all the surrounding Neuroi.

Sailor:
What the hell is happening?

Mio:
It can't be. The Neuroi are attacking the other Neuroi!

Perrine:
But why?
Is it just a mistake?

Mio:
It's no mistake.
The Warlock is controlling the Neuroi.

Perrine:
How can that be?



Sailor:
The Neuroi have been eliminated!

Sailor:
Sir!

Maloney:
What's wrong?

Sailor:
The signal's gone!

Sailor:
We've lost control of the unit!



Mio:
Looks like it's over.
The Warlock defeated them.

Yoshika:
But... the Neuroi fought themselves.

Mio:
Yes.
They were definitely attacking each other.

Yoshika:
It's coming back.

Sailor:
It appears the unit that was fighting the Neuroi is headed back this way, sir.

Sailor:
Let's hope it's friendly.

Perrine:
Get attacking from the Warlock!

Sailor:
Sir! The carrier Akagi is being attacked by the Warlock.

Maloney:
What?

Sailor:
The Warlock's gone crazy!
I can't control it!

Maloney:
Try again!

Sailor:
Sir, I recommend the emergency fail-safe.

Maloney:
No. That is our only Warlock.
We have to get it back under our control immediately.

Sailor:
But sir, it's turned against us.
We can't just stand by and do nothing while it destroys our allies.

Maloney:
Fine. Shut down.

Sailor:
Initiating Warlock fail-safe on the general's orders.

Sailor:
Fail-safe set and ready, sir.

Sailor:
Ready!

Sailor:
Any aircraft [xxx]
Ready the 40 millis. [xxx]
Fire at will!
Fire! Fire! Fire!



Sailor:
Activating Warlock forced shutdown system.

Maloney:
Let's shut it down... now!

Maloney:
Wait! What's wrong?
Why isn't it shutting down?



Barkhorn:
Our base!

Hartmann:
[xxx], where'd that beam come from?

Minna:
We have to go!



Sailor:
Disturber main deck's been hit!

Sailor:
38, 2 and 3 are gone!

Sailor:
Fire group to engineering, contain that brace!

Sailor:
It's [xxx]
Seal the secondary!

Yoshika:
I'm coming!
Let's keep going!

Mio:
Good team work, ladies!

Yoshika:
Yes, ma'am!



Shirley:
Look!

Lucchini:
What is it?

Shirley:
Let's find out!
Yahoooo!



Sanya:
The ship... on fire...



Lynne:
Oh, no!



Sailor:
Abandon ship. Abandon ship.

Perrine:
We've got to get to a lifeboat.
This ship's going under!

Yoshika:
Just run?
There has to be something we can do!

Perrine:
Don't be stupid!
What can we hope to do without our Striker Units!

Mio:
Hold on!
Perrine, help me up!

Perrine:
Major, you shouldn't!

Mio:
We've still got an ace in the hold, right here.

Yoshika:
Is that... a Striker Unit?

Mio:
I'll take off and try to buy us time until reinforcements get here.
I want you two to get to safety.

Perrine:
Major, you can't! No! Let me go with you!

Mio:
How, Perrine? There's only one Striker.

Perrine:
But, Major...

Yoshika:
Wait, Major!
Let me!
It's time I fly!

----[ED]----

I wanna help however I can.
It's time to spread our wings and never give up.
We have to fly! The future depends on it!
