----[OP]----

Sailor:
All ships, break formation [of remained in] sections at maximum operational speed for evasive action.


Captain:
Damn it!
Why don't those bastards hurry up and finish us off?

Sailor:
Maybe they enjoy taking us apart piece by piece, Captain.

Captain:
Prepare all fighter squadrons for take-off now.
It's time to show those alien scum that we're not going to give up with our serious fight.

Sailor:
Sir!


Mio:
Miyafuji.
I won't have that. Get that feel out of your eyes. You are at, see now young lady, at war.

Yoshika:
Sorry. It's just... the shaking doesn't ever stop.

Mio:
You'll get used to it.
Here. I need you to look up at me for a minute.
Stay still.
It's an intercom.
Now you'll be able to communicate to me whenever you want with that in your ear. Okay?

Yoshika:
Okay.

Mio:
However, you should only use it when it's an emergency.
Is that understood?

Yoshika:
Yes.

Mio:
Well, I should really be getting back up to the flight deck.

Yoshika:
Major Sakamoto...

Mio:
Hm?

Yoshika:
Um... are you gonna fight them for real?

Mio:
Of course I am. I have a duty and I'm going to honor it.

Yoshika:
What do I... should I just...

Mio:
You should stay right here.
Don't go outside no matter what happens.

Yoshika:
What if...

Mio:
Are you worried to something's going to happen to me?
Don't be scared. I'll be just fine.


Sailor:
Restrict 20mm and .50 cal. fire --- during take off.
All hands, prepare for launch!

Mio:
Major Sakamoto, prepare to launch!

Sailor:
The destroyer Yukikaze has been hit! No response!

Captain:
Forget it. All units, take off now.

Mio:
The Neuroi can regenerate indefinitely unless their cores destroyed.
All fighters draw their fire while I search for the core.
Distance to track 300, I'm on the ceiling!

Sailor:
Roger!


Mio:
There's less defenses up here.
This thing is like a porkypine.
I can't even find an angle to try and look for the core!

Sailor:
Receiving incoming flash traffic from Britannia.
501st Joint Fighter Wing dispatched, ETA to your position, 20 minutes.

Captain:
Damn! We're so close.
Order all ships to continue evasive maneuvers.


Yoshika:
Major Sakamoto is out there.
But I'm in here.


Yoshika:
Major Sakamoto, are you okay?
Major!

Mio:
What are you doing out here?
I told you to stay put. Now get back inside!

Yoshika:
Major Sakamoto, I'm so glad that you haven't been shot down.

Mio:
Miyafuji! I'm ordering you to go back inside immediately.
You can't do any good out here.
You're only going to get in the way!

Yoshika:
I can't stand by and do nothing.

Mio:
There is no time for this.
Get back in sick bay before you get somebody killed!

Yoshika:
Major Sakamoto! Major! Answer me!

Mio:
She's a reckless little girl. But she certainly has a lot of heart.
I better show the same.

Sailor:
The Isokaze has been hit!

Mio:
Time to finish this!

Sailor:
Oh...

Yoshika:
Wow. That's how a Witch fights!

Mio:
Found it!

Yoshika:
Sakamoto!

Yoshika:
Hold on!
I'm going to help you!

Yoshika:
Concentrate... breathe...

Sailor:
What are you doing? Back off!

Yoshika:
Wait! I was trying to use some healing magic.

Sailor:
You're trying to tell me you're a Witch?
Your power is a weak.
I can do a better job without your magic. Stand back!

Yoshika:
No!
I have to be able to do something to help out!

Sailor:
Don't be stupid! This is a thwarter, kid! There's no place for you here.
Get back down to sick bay!

Yoshika:
I won't go! There must be something I can do!

Sailor:
Fine, kid. Bandages, okay?
Get us as many as you can carry and bring them here. Got it?

Yoshika:
Okay.


Sailor:
Major, we're trying to buy you some more time!

Sailor:
But just make sure you find that core, get me?

Mio:
I'm counting on you. God's speed, Lieutenants.

Sailor:
Damn it! I'm hit!

Mio:
You haven't won yet!

Sailor:
All fighters are downed except for Major Sakamoto, Sir!

Captain:
Damn!
Where are our reinforcements?
Can't those Strike Witches fly here any faster?

Sailor:
That was too close.
The next one will cripple us for sure.

Captain:
She just needs to stay afloat till the cavalry gets here.


Sailor:
This is a thwarter, kid. There's no place for you here.

Mio:
You can't do any good out here. You're only going to get in the way!

Yoshika:
I guess... there's nothing... I can do...
Ahhhh.

Mio:
The Akagi!
Miyafuji! Miyafuji!
Come in! Miyafuji! Miyafuji!
Miyafuji! Miyafuji! Miyafuji!...

Yoshika's father:
...Yoshika. Yoshika. Yoshika.

Yoshika:
Daddy... I'm sorry... I can't do anything...

Yoshika's father:
Yoshika, know that you have great power inside of you just like your mother and grand mother.
Promise me when you grow up you'll use that power to protect everyone.

Yoshika:
Daddy...


Sailor:
Direct hit to the destroyer Tanikaze! No response!

Captain:
Well, looks like this is finally the end. Damn.
All right, men. Prepare to abandon ship.

Sailor:
All hands, prepare to abandon ship.
What's this? Who gave that authorization?

Captain:
Huh?

Sailor:
Captain. There appears to be someone operating in the central elevator.

Captain:
What?


Yoshika:
I have to do what I can.
With whatever power I have.
I promised I protect everyone.




Captain:
Who is that?
How could she equip a Striker Unit?

Sailor:
That's the girl Major Sakamoto brought. Her name is...

Yoshika:
Yoshika Miyafuji.

Captain:
Miyafuji? As in Dr. Miyafuji?

Sailor:
It can't be!

Mio:
Miyafuji?

Yoshika:
Let's go!

Captain:
Pull off! You've got to pull off now!

Yoshika:
Fly!

Mio:
Fly! C'mon!

Yoshika:
I'm... I'm flying! I can fly!

Mio:
I can't believe it!
It's the very first time she's worn the Striker Unit!

Yoshika:
Major Sakamoto!

Mio:
Hey, where are you going?

Yoshika:
I'm here to help!

Mio:
Look out!
That shield is incredible!
She has more power than I thought!
Interesting.
Glad to have you onboard, Miyafuji.

Yoshika:
Major, I brought you another gun!

Mio:
I think you should keep it.
You wanna help us, right?

Yoshika:
Yes, ma'am!

Mio:
Excellent!
Let me show you.
Its core is hidden under the surface right there.
You expose the core, while I draw its fire.
Think you can?

Yoshika:
I'll try and do my best.

Mio:
Okay. Two seconds, then follow me!

Mio:
Are you okay?

Yoshika:
Yes. I'm fine. I'm sorry, ma'am.
I... I can still fly! Give me a second.

Mio:
It's her first flight. Her first battle. She's had enough.

Yoshika:
One more time. Please let me try.

Mio:
All right, then, get ready. This could be our last chance to destroy it.

Yoshika:
Right!

Yoshika:
If I do it the same way, I'll get hit again. I have to think.
I see.
I have to stay close to it.
Hold it together, Yoshika.
I can do this!
I'm going to protect everyone.
That's the core!
... No! I can't!

Yoshika:
Did I... did I do it?

Mio:
Unbelievable!
She's had no training... and she pulled it off!

Lucchini:
Core destruction, confirmed.
That makes me 10 for 10, not bad, huh?

Barkhorn:
Confirmed here as well.
The Neuroi has been taken out.
Good job. The operation is a success.

Perrine:
Major Sakamoto! Are you all right?

Lucchini:
Perrine always turns [its] such a complete second to the Major after every battle is over.
I'm gonna make sure to tease her later on.

Perrine:
I don't believe it! Who is that!? Why is she touching the Major!?

Yoshika:
Did I...?

Mio:
Good to have you back.

Yoshika:
Major Sakamoto...

Mio:
I'm proud of you.
I don't know how much longer I could have survived if you hadn't shown up when you did.

Yoshika:
But I was supposed to destroy the core and in the end all I did was shoot around it, right?

Mio:
What are you talking about, Miyafuji?
This was only your first battle, which you did great.
C'mon. Take a look.

Yoshika:
Daddy. I did it. I...


Yoshika:
Are you sure it this is the address?

Mio:
Yes. Until 5 years ago, this was Dr. Miyafuji's development lab for the Striker Unit.
Up until the day of the accident.

Yoshika:
Major... did you know all of this before?

Mio:
I'm sorry.

Yoshika:
You don't have anything to be sorry for.
I'm so grateful that you brought me all the way here even though I acted so selfishly from the moment I met you.

Mio:
I used to live here with him a long time ago.
That letter was probably sent back then and just got lost.

Yoshika:
My dad really has terrible timing.
He left on my first day of school.
I've found out he died on my tenth birthday.
Suddenly this letter arrived then, for a second I thought... maybe...
I can see we're supposed to be father and daughter.
But I just don't know him.

Mio:
Use your power to protect everyone.
That was one of his favorite phrases he'd say.
It's why he made the Striker. He just wanted to protect everyone.

Yoshika:
Daddy...


Mio:
Shall we get going?

Yoshika:
Yes...
Um... Major Sakamoto...
If it's still okay, I'd like to join the Strike Witches.

Mio:
You sure?

Yoshika:
I want to stay here and continue my father's work.
I want to use my power to protect everyone I can.

Mio:
Miyafuji...

Yoshika:
I'm sure.
It's what my father would've wanted me to do.

Mio:
I see.
Hahaha!
All right, then. You better get ready.
I'm going to push you until you turn into a real Witch.
A true Witch. Are you ready?

Yoshika:
Yes!

Mio:
Hahahah. Hahaha!


Mio:
As of today, the 501st Joint Fighter Wing has a new member!
Yoshika Miyafuji!

Yoshika:
I'm Yoshika Miyafuji.
I'm happy to meet you!

----[ED]----
So we have a new recruit.
I wonder what she is like.
I wonder if she is really good.
She could be better than me.
What if she is?
Next time on Strike Witches "You're Not Alone."
