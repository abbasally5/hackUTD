Sailor:
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

Perrine:
We've got to get to a lifeboat.
This ship's going under!

Yoshika:
Just run?
There has to be something we can do!

Perrine:
Don't be stupid!
What can we hope to do without our Striker Units!

Mio:
Hold on!
Perrine, help me up!

Perrine:
Major, you shouldn't!

Mio:
We've still got an ace in the hold, right here.

Yoshika:
Is that... a Striker Unit?

Mio:
I'll take off and try to buy us time until reinforcements get here.
I want you two to get to safety.

Perrine:
Major, you can't! No! Let me go with you!

Mio:
How, Perrine? There's only one Striker.

Perrine:
But, Major...

Yoshika:
Wait, Major!
Let me!
It's time I fly!

----[OP]----

Mio:
What are you saying?

Yoshika:
That I'm gonna fly!

Mio:
Sergeant!
That is not a decision for you to make.

Yoshika:
Fine!
But I'm not ready to give up!

Mio:
Who's giving up?

Yoshika:
You! [Are] you trying fly that thing?
You're still too weak to fight.
And if you can't fight then that means, it means we're giving up and I can't do that!
Not without at least putting up a fight!
I made a promise to protect you!

Mio:
You'll protect me.
I bet you would be surprised at how many times I heard that.
Miyafuji, prepare to attack!

Yoshika:
Right!

Shirley:
What is that?

Lucchini:
A carrier. But why is it being attacked by the Warlock?

Shirley:
Strange that you think I would know.
Hold on tight!

Lucchini:
Holding!

Perrine:
Warlock 10 o'clock! Altitude 2,000m. Right above us!

Mio:
The right engine spotters a little after start but don't let that distract you.
Once you get going you're fine.

Yoshika:
Yes, ma'am.

Perrine:
The enemy is here!

Mio:
All right, it's time!

Yoshika:
Right!

Mio:
Miyafuji!

Perrine:
Major!

Mio:
C'mon! You can do it!

Perrine:
Oh, Miyafuji!

Yoshika:
Oh, no!

Mio:
Nice work, Perrine!

Perrine:
Thanks!

Shirley:
No way!
Is that Miyafuji fighting the Warlock?

Lucchini:
Hurry! We've got to help her!

Shirley:
Yeah.
I've forgot this thing doesn't have any weapons.

Perrine:
Here!

Mio:
Go for it, Miyafuji!

Sugita:
What the...? Miyafuji!



Maloney:
What exactly are you planning to do with us?

Barkhorn:
What do you think, Minna?

Minna:
You certainly have been keeping busy, haven't you?
I guess it's not an easy task deceiving the Witches, is it?
The only way for you to become stronger than the Witches was to use Neuroi technology.
You try to hide your method by forcing us to disband.
If we were gone who else would even think to question you.
A decent plan.
However Sergeant Miyafuji's actions exceeded military understanding and caused you to slip.

Barkhorn:
I wish... I wish we had known to trust Miyafuji's instincts earlier.

Hartmann:
Hey, this doesn't look good.
I think the Akagi is sinking.
It looks like the Warlock is fighting a Witch.
But who is it?

Minna:
Sergeant Miyafuji!

Barkhorn:
Are you sure?

Maloney:
Impossible!
You don't have any Strikers to use.
Everything is locked away in the hangar, isn't it?

Minna:
This signal I'm receiving... is from Mio's Striker.

Hartmann:
What? How?
Not bad at all, Miyafuji.

Barkhorn:
I've heard to deceive your enemies first deceive your friends.
That sounds just like Sakamoto.

Minna:
I'm betting Miyafuji's gotta hands full just trying to buy time.
Let's go!

Hartmann:
Yeah, you're right.
C'mon!

Barkhorn:
Hey, wait!

Yoshika:
I don't get it.
Why is the Warlock attacking the Akagi?
It's just like the Neuroi.
Neuroi...
If it's a Neuroi then...


Man:
Was that a Witch I just saw?

Lynne:
Yes. In fact she was my friend.
She was the best friend I've ever had!



Yoshika:
No way! This isn't the Neuroi that was my friend!
This one is the real enemy!

Perrine:
Oh, wow.

Mio:
Yes. It's amazing that she can hold on against that monster.

Barkhorn:
All right, then.
So we're saying that when Miyafuji flop there to make friends with the Neuroi,
those guys freaked out on us and that's the reason we have to help her fight.
Does that make sense, Minna?

Minna:
Yep.

Barkhorn:
Well, what do you think?

Hartmann:
Yes, sure. But who are and what did you do to Trudy?

Minna:
Eila. Sanya.

Barkhorn:
Hi, guys. What are you doing? Is everything okay?

Eila:
Well, uh... we... we... it's the train's fault!
We fell asleep and when we woke up, we're back at the starting station.
So, you know, since we were here we figured we'd see what was going on.
Right, Sanya?

Sanya:
No, we found out Yoshika's fighting.
So we... we thought maybe she could use some help.

Eila:
Sanya, what's wrong with you?

Hartmann:
You're not very good liar.

Minna:
I don't think we're either.

Barkhorn:
Hey! What do you mean? I'm not lying about anything!

Hartmann:
Oh, c'mon. Who cares?

Minna:
What do you say we get started.



Perrine:
Major. Keep holding out, okay?

Mio:
I'll be fine!
Let go!

Perrine:
No!
I'm very sorry, Major.
That's one order I won't accept!

Yoshika:
Sakamoto!

Shirley:
Okay, now!

Lucchini:
I'm ready! Let's go!

Yoshika:
Francesca!

Mio:
Let go!

Perrine:
I can't!

Shirley:
All right!
Whoa! Nice catch!

Lucchini:
Welcome back!

Yoshika:
Yeah!



Lynne:
Wait. Please wait for me, Yoshika.
I'm almost there!

Lucchini:
Hi, Lynne!

Hartmann:
Hey, Lynne, we're over here.

Barkhorn:
You're late.
We'll let it slide this time.

Minna:
Hurry it up. You're the last who arrive.

Lynne:
Right. Yes ma'am!

----[A/B part]-----------------------------------------

Yoshika:
We did it!

Lynne:
Nice work, Yoshika!

Sugita:
The Akagi...

Sailor:
It's sinking, sir.

Shirley:
Thanks for waiting.

Lucchini:
Yoshika!

Yoshika:
You're all back!

Mio:
I'm quite impressed!
Nice work!

Yoshika:
Thank you.

Barkhorn:
Looks like you won't be needing these anymore then.

Eila:
That may not be true.
Look over there.

Sailor:
It can't be...

Mio:
The Warlock... and the Akagi!

Mio:
Perrine, thank you.

Minna:
'kay. Letting go.

Mio:
Don't worry about me.
Wait. Am I seeing things?

Minna:
The Warlock and Akagi have fused together.
It's beyond our control at this point.

Mio:
Still, we have to try.
This thing is no longer just a Warlock or a Neuroi.
It's completely different.
We're not going to give up.
If the Witches can't stop it then no one else will be able to.

Sanya:
It's coming.

Minna:
All right. Listen up!
All units, prepare to attack.
Our targets are the Akagi and the Warlock!

Everyone:
Right!

Mio:
The core is in the Akagi's engine.

Minna:
I don't think we'll be able to destroy it from the outside.
Which means we'll have to go inside.

Mio:
I'll go. I know my way around the interior.

Yoshika:
No, Major, I'll go!

Lynne:
I'll be her backup.

Perrine:
Well, I know little about the inside. We don't want you getting lost.

Yoshika:
Thank you, Perrine.

Perrine:
Don't thank me.
It's not like this is some kind of gesture.

Mio:
Well, it'll be very comforting for me to know that you're with them.

Perrine:
Right!

Minna:
Now, the rest of us will provide cover for them and clear a path so they can fly safely.

Everyone:
Roger!

Mio:
Commence attack!

Barkhorn:
You're not gonna let the others take all the credit for that, are you?
Hey! Wait!

Hartmann:
See you later!
Strum!

Barkhorn:
Hey, that's my job!

Eila:
Move to the right.

Sanya:
'kay.

Eila:
Head upward.

Sanya:
'kay.

Eila:
Are you getting sleepy?

Sanya:
Uh-uh. I'm okay.

Shirley:
The attack seemed to be letting up.

Lucchini:
So should we go?

Shirley:
Ready?
Go!

Yoshika:
Is she okay?

Shirley:
Go for it, Yoshika!

Perrine:
Time for us to go!

Yoshika & Lynne:
Right!

Perrine:
That's the bulkhead.

Yoshika:
Yours, Lynne!

Lynne:
Got it!

Perrine:
No, your weapons!

Perrine:
In here.
We're gonna need more than one gun.

Yoshika:
Oh, no!

Lynne:
But we've come all this way.

Yoshika:
What are you doing?

Perrine:
I was planning on saving this till we really needed it.
Tonnerre!

Lynne:
Yoshika!

Perrine:
What are you doing?
Are you completely crazy?

Yoshika:
Lynne, please. Both of you. I need your help.

Yoshika:
Thanks for everything.



Shirley:
They did it!

Lucchini:
It's Yoshika!

Lynne:
Yoshika...
You did it, Yoshika! You're amazing!
I don't know how you figure that out, but, wow!

Perrine:
What's that?

Mio:
Look at the hive!

Shirley:
It's disappearing!

Lucchini:
We won!

Perrine:
Gallia... my homeland is freed... after all this time.

Lynne:
Amazing! You're amazing, Yoshika!

Mio:
So that's it.

Minna:
Yeah.
Great work, Witches. All units, return to home.

Everyone:
Yes, ma'am!

Yoshika:
In September 1944, the complete annihilation of the Neuroi in the Gallia region was confirmed.
And 501st Joint Fighter Wing, the Strike Witches, were officially disbanded.
But never forgotten.

----[ED]----

Yoshika:
And to think, it all started with just this letter, didn't it?

Michiko:
Yoshika, I need your help!

Yoshika:
Michiko, what happened?
I see. I can do this.
Wow, isn't it amazing?

Michiko:
Yes, it is. Thanks!

Yoshika:
What's that?
A Witch!

Amaki:
Hi, I'm Amaki of the Army Airforce Squad 47.
How are you two doing today.

Yoshika:
We're fine.

Amaki:
Do you know Yoshika Miyafuji?

Yoshika:
Yeah. I'm Yoshika.

Amaki:
Oh, that's great news!

Yoshika:
Huh?

Amaki:
I have a letter for you.
From your dad.

Yoshika:
Huh!?
