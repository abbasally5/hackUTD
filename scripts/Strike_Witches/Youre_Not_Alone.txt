Officer:
It seems the reinforcements and supplies arrived from Fuso safely.

Minna:
Yes, sir.
Major Sakamoto and a supplementary member named Yoshika Miyafuji have arrived.
As usual, we will be treating her as a sergeant.

Officer:
We're certainly thankful for the increased man power.

Officer:
Especially after hearing that the Neuroi attacks are becoming much more irregular.

Minna:
It's true, sir.
Their interval seems to be gradually narrowing from their usual weekly pattern.
Increasing our numbers should help.

Officer:
I doubt we'd be able to leave things as they are.

Minna:
With all due respect, I refuse to have armchair theories imposed upon us.

Officer:
All we're asking for here is results.

Minna:
And you'll have them, sir.
Rest assured that Britannia's skies along with the rest of the world will be protected by the Strike Witches.


----[OP]----


Yoshika:
Huh?
(yawn)

Yoshika:
Oh, that's right. I joined the Strike Witches.



Mio:
Sergeant Miyafuji, how are you today?
Did you sleep well?

Yoshika:
Yes.
Uh...Major Sakamoto, do you always train this early in a morning?

Mio:
Hahahaha!
Of course.
And we're both in the navy now, you don't have to call me Major.

Yoshika:
Yes, ma'am.
Sakamoto, then?

Mio:
That's better.
This is the front line.
We must always be prepared for an enemy attack and train as often as possible.
It's the key to our survival.

Yoshika:
The front line?

Mio:
Ha ha ha...
Oh, come on, don't give me that scared look.
You definitely have what it takes.
Our training together will ensure that you are ready for anything.

Yoshika:
I'm counting on you!
(And you can count on me.)

Perrine:
Who does she think she is?!
She's getting closer to the Major every day!
Ohh, that is not okay!



Minna:
Your attention please. Good morning.
Quick announcement.
In case you haven't gotten to meet her yet, this is our new recruit.
Major Sakamoto brought her to us from the Fuso Empire.
This is Yoshika Miyafuji.

Yoshika:
Thank you for having me.
I've been looking forward to meeting all of you.

Minna:
Miyafuji's rank is sergeant, the same rank as you, Lynne, so would you mind getting her settled in?

Lynne:
Okay.

Minna:
Good.
Now all the documents, clothing, rank insignia and identification you need are in here.

Yoshika:
Excuse me?

Minna:
Yes?

Yoshika:
I, um...I won't be needing a gun.

Minna:
Well, I hope not, but you should keep it with you in case you do.

Yoshika:
Sorry. No, thank you.

Minna:
Right.

Mio:
Hahaha!
She facinates me.

Perrine:
I don't get it!
What do you think of her?

Lucchini:
Huh?

Perrine:
That's it!

Minna:
Well, I certainly wasn't expecting that to happen.
I guess individual introductions will have wait 'till later.
You are now dismissed.

Shirley:
So...?

Lucchini:
Consolation prize.

Eila:
Lynne's are so much bigger.

Lynne:
Ummmm...

Shirley:
A ha ha ha.
You can never compete with this.

Shirley:
Hi there, my name is Charlotte Yeager.
I'm a flight lieutenant from United States of Liberion.
But you can call me Shirley.

Yoshika:
Hi.

Shirley:
You need to eat more if you expect to get bigger.

Yoshika:
Ahhhh...

Lucchini:
I'm so bored.

Eila:
I'm Eila Ilmatar Juutilainen.
Suomus Air Force ensign.
This is Sanya Litvyak, an Orussian Army lieutenant.

Lucchini:
Francesca Lucchini, Romagna Regia Aeronautica ensign.

Yoshika:
I'm pleased to meet all of you.

Mio:
All right. That's enough of the introductions.
Time to get ready for duty.
Lynne and Miyafuji will begin training this afternoon.

Yoshika:
Ma'am!

Mio:
Excellent response.
Lynette, begin by showing Miyafuji around the base.

Lynne:
Yes, ma'am. Okay.

Yoshika:
I'm Yoshika Miyafuji.
Thank you so much for helping me.

Lynne:
It's my pleasure.
My name is Lynette Bishop.



Lynne:
So, have you memorized the room locations, Sergeant Miyafuji?

Yoshika:
Yeah!
Pretty much!

Lynne:
Well, this one is my room.

Yoshika:
Here?
No way, that means we're neighbors!

Lynne:
Oh, is that so?
It looks empty.

Yoshika:
Yeah. That's because I don't have anything yet.

Lynne:
I know a good place to go for furniture and other things you might need.
It's kinda far, but...I'd be happy to take you if you wanna go sometime?

Yoshika:
Wow, thank you!
Do you think this place will have a really big pot that I can buy?
You know, for cooking.

Lynne:
Sure. But... is that all you want?

Lynne:
And this is the kitchen and the dining hall.

Yoshika:
Who gets to be on cooking duty?

Lynne:
We have someone who does it regularly, but every once in a while, we let everyone make their own ethnic cuisines.

Yoshika:
Wow!
I can make some really great stuff with all this!

Lynne:
So I guess you're a pretty good cook, huh?

Yoshika:
I wouldn't say I'm good.
But I like cooking and like when people eat what I make.


Yoshika:
Aw...!


Yoshika:
Who's that?

Lynne:
That's Lieutenant Hartmann.
Her shoot down count reached 200 recently.

Yoshika:
200?
Wow, so I guess you guys have been fighting the Neuroi for a long time.

Lynne:
Captain Barkhorn, next to her, shot down 250.
And Commander Minna's count is over 160.
Without the three of them, this place would have been conquered by the Neuroi a long time ago.

Yoshika:
That's incredible!

Lynne:
On top of all that, they also have special magical abilities and are protecting many people's homelands at the same time.
The Witches are really amazing, aren't they?

Yoshika:
But the only thing I know how to do is heal people.

Lynne:
At least you can do something.
All I do is slow everyone down. I can't do anything.

Yoshika:
Ah, that's not true.

Lynne:
Huh...c'mon, let's keep going.

Yoshika:
Ai...

Lynne:
I'm sorry!

Yoshika:
It's okay, silly.



Yoshika:
Wow! That's amazing!

Lynne:
This is the highest point on the entire base.

Yoshika:
So the whole island is the base, then?

Lynne:
Yeah. We're right off of the Strait of Dover. It looks really small from far away.
And if you look over there you can see Europe.
Unfortunately, the majority of it has fallen into the enemy's hands.

Yoshika:
(It's so quiet here.
And yet there's a war going on.)



Mio:
You can run faster than that!
Miyafuji! Tell me what you see in front of you!?

Yoshika:
The sea!

Mio:
Lynne, tell me what's beyond the sea!?

Lynne:
Europe is, ma'am!

Mio:
And what is the situation in Europe!?

Lynne:
It's been occupied by the enemy!

Mio:
That's right.
It's up to you to regain that territory.
The only way you're going to that is by training. Got it?
Training, training, training!
Move!
What you need more that magical strength is physical strength!

Yoshika & Lynne:
Yes, ma'am!

Mio:
Good! Give make ten more!

Yoshika & Lynne:
Right!

Yoshika:
Huh!?

Mio:
Miyafuji! Eyes forward!

Yoshika:
Ye--yes, ma'am!

Mio:
Two more sets!

Lynne:
I can't...

Yoshika:
Me, neither...

Mio:
(sigh)



Mio:
Hmm, a little too much to the right.
Pay more attention to the wind.

Lynne:
Yes, ma'am.

Mio:
Good! Nice shot, Lynne.

Yoshika:
That was amazing!
Wow, I can't even see the target from here.

Lynne:
Hmm, I'm sorry...

Mio:
'kay, Miyafuji, you're up. Get in position.

Yoshika:
Huh, ah...

Mio:
Next thing we need to do is get you trained on the Striker Unit equipment.

Perrine:
Major Sakamoto, permission to assist our new recruits?

Mio:
Permission granted and may I say I am impressed.
Good to see you volunteering your time.

Perrine:
Ah... well... I'm happy to help and figured it might be easier to work in pairs.

Mio:
Good thinking, Perrine.

Perrine:
I'm Perrine Clostermann, lieutenant of the Gallia Arm√©e de l'Air.
I've been under Major Sakamoto's care for a very long time now.
You should know you're very lucky to have me accompanying you.

Yoshika:
Oh, yes. Thank you so much. I promise to do my best.

Mio:
Worn out already, Miyafuji?
Well, it's your first day. That's to be expected.
Though I didn't think your magic control would be so sloppy, you need to work on your baseline staminas, too.

Perrine:
And I suggest you start working on these things right away.
Otherwise, you'll continue to be a nuisance.
Honestly, I think you'd be better off going home.

Mio:
Hahaha!
She'a novice, Perrine.
This is her first day.
Don't be so hard on her.

Perrine:
Oh, right.
Well, there's this aerial combat technique I'm trying to perfect in case of an attack.

Mio:
I see. Shall we go up one more time, then?

Perrine:
Oh, yes, I'd love to!

Mio:
Miyafuji, Lynette, that would be all for today.




Minna:
She doesn't seem to be showing any improvements.

Mio:
She's having some trouble with control.
But her magical power is a quite strong.

Minna:
Lynette's doing great, isn't she?
I don't know why she can't do this outside training.

Mio:
I would be happier if she did only half as well in battle.

Minna:
Agreed.


Mio:
Good work! You're done for today.

Lynne:
Captain Barkhorn.

Barkhorn:
Newbie!

Yoshika:
Yes!

Barkhorn:
Don't you realize this is the front line?
Your skills in combat are all that matters here.
Are you prepare to die?

Yoshika:
Well... I don't know. I just really wanna help people.

Barkhorn:
The Neuroi aren't going to wait for you to imporve your training.
So if you want to survive, I suggest you become stronger.


Lynne:
Sergeant Miyafuji?

Yoshika:
Hi, Lynette.

Lynne:
[Even] you found my favorite spot here.

Yoshika:
I did? It's beautiful, isn't it?

Lynne:
Yes.

Yoshika:
I got in trouble again. I need to try harder.

Lynne:
I'm little jealous of you, Miyafuji.

Yoshika:
But why?

Lynne:
Your ability to keep trying harder and never give up.

Yoshika:
Wow! That's exactly what it says in my report card!

Lynne:
I don't think there's anything good anyone could say about me.
I just don't belong here.

Yoshika:
That's not true. I saw you. You're amazing!

Lynne:
No, I'm not really. Believe me.

Yoshika:
C'mon, yes, you are!

Lynne:
Only during training.
During actual fighting I'm a failure. I can't even fly.

Yoshika:
But if you could do it during training...

Lynne:
I know it's hard for you to believe 'cause you're good at everything but I'm not you!
Ah... I'm sorry about that...

Yoshika:
Lynette! Wait!


Minna:
We've receieved a report from the observation post.
It looks like the enemy has entered the East Grid Sector 1-14.
Altitude is higher than usual.
To compensate we'll be changing formation.

Mio:
Barkhorn and Hartmann will be upfront.
Shirley and Lucchini will take the rear.
Perrine, you're with me.

Minna:
The rest of you will standby at the base with me.

Everyone:
Roger!


Yoshika:
Wow, look at them go!

Lynne:
Yeah, it's great...

Yoshika:
Is there anything we can be doing right now to help?

Lynne:
Maybe you can... but I would just get in the way.

Yoshika:
Where are you going?

Minna:
Miyafuji, may I speak with you for a moment?

Yoshika:
Ah... sure.

Minna:
Britannia is Sergeant Bishop's homeland so she's sensitive.
You're aware that Europe has recently fallen into the hands of the Neuroi, aren't you?

Yoshika:
Yes. Lynette told me.

Minna:
That's why this is so hard for her.
You see? Britannia may be Europe's last hope.
And the pressure becomes too much for her when defending that during combat.

Yoshika:
I understand.

Minna:
So what about you?
Why did you decide to join the Witches?

Yoshika:
Me? I wanna help people who are in need and protect them.

Minna:
You know, that's exactly what Lynne said when she first enlisted.
Never forget those feelings.
I'm sure your desire to help everyone will give you strength.


Mio:
Enemy sighted! Attack!

Perrine:
That was almost too easy, wasn't it?

Mio:
Something isn't right!
I can't seem to find the core.

Perrine:
Do you think it could be a diversion?

Mio:
Let's go! The base is in trouble!


Yoshika:
Lynette...
I am... I'm terrible at magic. Plus I'm always in trouble.
I can't fly and I won't use a gun.
What's more... I don't even care about fighting against the Neuroi.
I just wanted to be in the Witches.
I wanna be able to use my magic to help someone. Even if it's just one person.
But I hope it's not. Because... I wanna protect everyone.

Lynne:
Protect...

Yoshika:
That's why I keep on trying.
And that's why you should, too, Lynette.


Minna:
You're saying you and I are the only ones who can do this?
But what about Sanya?

Eila:
She used up all of her magic during the night patrol. No good.

Minna:
Right. Well, it's just the two of us, then.

Yoshika:
I wanna go, too!

Minna:
Thank you, Sergeant Miyafuji. But it's much too soon for you to fight.

Yoshika:
No, it's not. I won't get in anyone's way. Please! I wanna help!

Minna:
I cannot send someone with inadequate training into battle. That would means certain death.
Not to mention the fact that you don't even want to shoot a weapon.

Yoshika:
I'll shoot to protect someone.

Lynne:
Miyafuji...

Minna:
None of that matters, Miyafuji. You're just not ready.

Yoshika:
But...

Lynne:
Then I'm going, too.

Yoshika:
Lynette...

Lynne:
If you let us work together we'll be just as strong as one.

Minna:
You have 90 seconds to get ready.

Yoshika & Lynne:
Roger!


Minna:
Looks like the enemy will be approaching from 3 o'clock.
Eila and I will move on ahead.
You two stay behind and provide backup, okay?

Yoshika:
Right!

Lynne:
Right!

Minna:
All right. We're counting on you.

Lynne:
Miyafuji... I was actually really scared when I volunteered.

Yoshika:
I'm still really scared.
I know this may sound strange but I would've been more afraid if we just stay behind and not done anything.

Lynne:
That's what I usually do.

Yoshika:
What's wrong?

Lynne:
Look! Over there!


Eila:
Fast...

Minna:
This is by far the fastest one yet.
Boom and Zoom tactics aren't going to work.
Prepare to max speed!


Yoshika:
Neuroi?

Lynne:
I'm afraid so.

Yoshika:
It's coming this way!


Eila:
It's speeding up.

Minna:
It's too fast! This is bad.


Lynne:
I can't do. [No?] I can' hit it!

Yoshika:
Yes, you can! It's just like when you were in training.

Lynne:
It's taking everything I've got just to fly and
I won't have enough energy to control my shots with magic.

Yoshika:
Fine! Then I'll support you, okay?
That way you can just concentrate on shooting.

Lynne:
Huh? What are you doing? Wait!

Yoshika:
See? Don't you feel more stable?

Lynne:
Umm... well... yeah. Thanks!

Minna:
Bishop, Miyafuji, the enemy is heading in your direction.
You're the one we're counting on it at this point.
This is your moment!

Yoshika:
Right!

Lynne:
West-north-west wind... velocity 3... and speed... position...
That's it!
If I caluculate the enemy's future position after evasion and use that as my target...

Lynne:
When I give you the signal, I'm gonna need you to shoot with me.

Yoshika:
Okay, You got it!

Lynne:
Shoot now!
Hit it!

Minna:
Lynette, you did it!

Yoshika:
Look at that!

Lynne:
Miyafuji, did you see that? I did it. That's the first time I've ever [managed to help everyone]
and it's all because of you. Thank you so much!

Yoshika:
We're friends, aren't we?
You could stop calling me Miyafuji.

Lynne:
Then you can stop calling me Lynette.

Yoshika:
'kay! Lynne, right?

Lynne:
Yeah, Thanks Yoshika!

Yoshika:
Ah, I can't. I can't breath!


----[ED]----


My homeland was overunned by the Neuroi.
And eventually went down in flames.
Now there's nothing left for me but to fight.
Even if it means I fight alone.
Next time on Strike Witches: "Thanks"
