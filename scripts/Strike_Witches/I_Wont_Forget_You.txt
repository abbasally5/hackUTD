Yoshika:
I wanted to thank you for all your help.
I've made some snacks for everyone to eat as a way of saying thank you.
These desserts are from my homeland Fuso.

Sailor:
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Commander Minna has prohibited us from having any unnecessary conversations with any of you Strike Witches.

----[OP]----

Yoshika:
The wind sure is blowing today!

Lynne:
It sure is.
But at least the laundry will dry a lot faster.

Yoshika:
Something weird happened.
I was in the hangar earlier today.

Lynne:
Hmm?

Lynne:
That is kind of strange.

Yoshika:
So, why do you think Commander Minna would make up a rule like that?
Do you know, Lynne?

Lynne:
I'd heard of it before.
But I guess I never really thought there is anything weird about it.

Yoshika:
Well, it just doesn't make any sense. It's such a dumb order!
You have to agree with me on this one.

Lynne:
I haven't really had the opportunity to talk to many men unless you include my brothers.

Yoshika:
Not even when you were attending school?

Lynne:
I went to Our Mother of Mercy all-girl school.

Yoshika:
Oh, okay.

Lynne:
I guess I'm not much help at this.

Yoshika:
Don't worry.
Oh, wow!
Look!
It's the Akagi!

Lynne:
The Akagi?

Yoshika:
It's the ship that brought me here.
I heard it was being repaired.
It must be fixed already.

Lucchini:
Hey, there she is.
Yoshika!

Shirley:
Commander Minna wants to see you!

Yoshika:
Oh, okay!
What did I do?



Yoshika:
Excuse me! Um...

Sugita:
Sergeant Miyafuji.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

Minna:
May I introduce the captain of the Akagi.
He took time to come over here and meet you.

Sugita:
I'm captain Sugita.
On behalf of our entire crew I am here to express our deepest thanks.

Yoshika:
For what?

Sugita:
It's result of your action that our fleet bound for Europe was able to make it there at all.
Many lives were saved that day because of you.
I wanted to come thank you personally.

Yoshika:
Why me? I didn't do anything.
Sakamoto and the other Witches are the ones that did all the work.

Mio:
It's true.
If you hadn't made the choice to fly that day, the whole fleet could've been wiped out.
You should be very proud of yourself, Miyafuji.

Yoshika:
If you say so, ma'am.

Sugita:
This is a small token of appreciation from myself and the crew.

Minna:
Wow, that is quite a tremendous honor, Yoshika.

Mio:
Now don't forget to say thank you, Miyafuji.

Yoshika:
Of course!
Thank you very much, sir!

Sugita:
Before we launch into a counter offensive operation they've ordered us to execute a probing attack.

Minna:
That's good. It's about time.

Yoshika:
Counter offensive?

Sugita:
Yes. My stop here today is actually a break from it.
We disembark tomorrow.
Please stop by if possible. The sailors would love to see you again.

Yoshika:
Yes, sir.

Minna:
Unfortunately captain, we've already been scheduled for a mission tomorrow.

Sugita:
I see. That's too bad.



Lynne:
But the captain's in charge of the carrier group so he outranks Commander Minna.

Yoshika:
Really? I didn't know he was so important.

Lynne:
I can't believe the captain came to thank you in person. That's amazing!

Sailor:
Sergeant Miyafuji!
I really wanted to thank you for saving our ship from the Neuroi.
I thought that you were totally amazing.
I bought this card at the PX for you because I couldn't afford flowers.

Yoshika:
Oh, okay. That's sweet, I guess.

Sailor:
Ah, well, will you take this card... please do, I got it just for you.

Yoshika:
The rules!

Lynne:
Huh?

Yoshika:
I don't think I...

Lynne:
Oh, I bet that it's a love letter.

Yoshika:
A love letter...?

Lynne:
Uh-huh. Here, let me free up ya hands 'kay?

Yoshika:
Ah!

Sailor:
No!

Lynne:
Oh... cute!

Yoshika:
Commander Minna.

Minna:
You're both aware fraternization has been strictly prohibited.

Sailor:
It's my fault, ma'am.
I was only trying to say thank you to her.

Yoshika:
It's true. He wasn't doing anything wrong, Commander.

Minna:
Unnecessary contact with the Witches is against regulations.
I cannot allow you to give her this contraband.

Sailor:
It was my mistake, sorry.



Lynne:
Commander Minna seemed so angry.
I wonder what he wrote to you.
Hey, Yoshika?



Mio:
I heard about the letter.

Minna:
Mio...

Mio:
You forbid her from accepting it, didn't you?

Minna:
It is against base regulations.

Mio:
You still haven't let go.



Yoshika:
Wow, a Fuso doll.

Lynne:
It's adorable.

Yoshika:
Hey Lynne, how can I thank them?



Minna:
Initial reports from Gallia are that the enemy is advancing.

Mio:
It seems they finally got their predictions right for once.

Minna:
Yes. Their current altitude is 15,000 and they're headed directly for the south-east base.

Mio:
Right.
We will execute intercept pattern Alpha Tango 7.
So here are your assignments.
Barkhorn and Hartmann will take the lead.
Perrine and Lynne will follow up behind.
Miyafuji, Minna and I will take the rear.
Well the rest of you will remain here at the base on highest alert.

Lucchini:
I love it when we get to house-sit.

Shirley:
I can adjust the gyro on my Striker Unit.

Mio:
Right. You're all dismissed.

Lucchini:
'kay, see you later.



Mio:
Enemy sighted.

Minna:
Its class?

Mio:
Confirming that now!
M-class. 300.
Standard attack formation?

Minna:
Affirmative.

Mio:
Yes, ma'am!
Move out!

Minna:
That's not good.

Mio:
It divided!

Minna:
There's 80 on the right, 100 in the center and 30 on the left.

Mio:
That's 210 in all.
We should all be getting medals after this one

Minna:
That's right.

Mio:
So, what's the plan?

Minna:
I need you to locate the core.

Mio:
Roger that!

Minna:
Barkhorn, you take the middle.

Barkhorn:
Yes, ma'am.

Minna:
Perrine, your team has the right.

Perrine:
Yes, ma'am.

Minna:
Miyafuji, I want you to stay with Major Sakamoto.

Miyafuji:
Yes, ma'am.

Minna:
Keep the path clear for the major until she finds the core.
Do I make myself clear, Sergeant?

Yoshika:
Yes, ma'am!

Hartmann:
That makes ten.

Barkhorn:
I've got 12.
Nice to have a little friendly competition.

Hartmann:
It does seem like its [been] forever.

Perrine:
Your gun is not suited for rapid firing.
So stay up here and pick them off from me.

Lynne:
Yes, ma'am.

Perrine:
Just make sure you cover my back. You got that?
Casting this always messes up my hair for the rest of the day.
Tonnerre!

Perrine:
That's what you Neuroi get for messing with me.

Perrine:
It seems you're not useless.

Lynne:
They're all so incredible.

Mio:
Just like that, every time.

Yoshika:
Right, Major.

Barkhorn:
20!

Hartmann:
There's no end!

Barkhorn:
Where the hell is the core?

----[A/B part]----

Minna:
Have you located the core?

Mio:
No, not yet.

Minna:
Okay.
Do you think it's a diversion?

Mio:
I doubt it.
I can sense the core nearby but it's not emanating out of the main group.

Minna:
The battle field appears to be moving.

Mio:
Agreed.
It's migrating toward the continent.

Yoshika:
Up there!

Mio:
Damn it! I can't see!

Yoshika:
I got them!

Mio:
Just keep firing.
You've almost got them!

Yoshika:
Yes, ma'am.

Mio:
I found it!

Minna:
There. That one?

Mio:
Yes, ma'am!

Minna:
Attention, all units!
The enemy core has been located.
Keep those other Neuroi off of us while we engage!

Everyone:
Yes, ma'am!

Minna:
All right, let's go!

Everyone:
Right!

Minna:
There!

Mio:
Miyafuji, it's all yours!

Yoshika:
Right!

Minna:
Mio.

Lynne:
Yoshika, you were amazing!

Perrine:
Just a lucky shot is all that was.

Barkhorn:
Yeah, lucky we had Miyafuji on the team targeting the core.
I think that's what you meant to say.

Hartmann:
Whoa, Miyafuji, you're a pretty good shot.

Yoshika:
You really think so?

Yoshika:
It's beautiful.

Mio:
Yes. When they're neutralized.

Perrine:
Even the most beautiful flowers may have some thorns.

Hartmann:
Talking about yourself?

Perrine:
That is so rude!
Except the part of I being beautiful. That's true.

Hartmann:
I don't know. I think you're pretty thorny.

Perrine:
Why must you always bring others down to your level?

Hartmann:
Thorny Perry.

Barkhorn:
Minna, wait.

Hartmann:
Hey, where is she going?

Mio:
Not now.
She needs to be left alone.

Barkhorn:
I see. This is Pas-de-Calais...



Minna's boyfriend:
Ostmark has just been destroyed.

Minna:
I know. I received my orders to transfer to the front lines.

Minna's boyfriend:
I volunteered to go as well.

Minna:
No! We agreed that you go studying music.

Minna's boyfriend:
Before the invasion started you wanted to study music in Vienna with me.

Minna:
I'm a Witch. I have a duty to use my powers to protect everyone.

Minna's boyfriend:
My love, I don't want you to fight at the front line.

Minna:
That doesn't matter. I have to go fight.
But you don't.

Minna's boyfriend:
I can't bear to let you go so I'm coming with you.

Minna's boyfriend:
No, Minna!



Minna's boyfriend:
Operation Dynamo seems to be working.

Minna:
I don't think they'll be able to evacuate Gallia fast enough.

Minna's boyfriend:
I heard most people are getting out on the trains to the south.

Minna:
There's not going to be enough time.

Minna's boyfriend:
We have to at least evacuate all of the civilians.

Minna:
Then we've got to stay here till they're gone.

Minna's boyfriend:
That's right.
You Witches are our guardian angels.

Minna's boyfriend:
Okay, here all set to go.
We're going to have to abandon this base.
When the battle's over you should rendezvous with the others in Britannia.

Minna:
What about you?

Minna's boyfriend:
We'll be leaving right behind you.
I'll meet you over there.

Minna:
Promise me you will?

Minna's boyfriend:
Of course.
Minna, I've got a present to give you later.



Minna:
They haven't arrived yet?

Hartmann:
Uh-uh. None of them.

Barkhorn:
Wait!
Minna, the other units are doing all they can to support the retreat.
And our powers are too weak for us to be any use right now.

Minna:
No, he's... he's right over there!

Minna's boyfriend:
I'm sorry, Minna.



Mio:
Are you ready to go now?

Minna:
I am.
C'mon. Let's get back to the base.

Mio:
All right. Commander.

Sailor:
She didn't come after all.
Huh?
It's Miyafuji!

Yoshika:
Hi! Thank you everyone!
Thank you! Please be careful!
We'll be there when you need us most.

Lynne:
Yeah, we will, won't we, Yoshika.

Yoshika:
They got my thank you.

Mio:
They appreciate what you've done for them.

Yoshika:
Yeah.

Lynne:
They all look so happy.

Yoshika:
Yeah, they do.

Mio:
All right, let's head back to the base.

Yoshika:
Yes, ma'am.

Sailor:
Captain, we have an incoming transmission.

Sugita:
Put it through.

Sugita:
It can't be.
Patch it throughout the ship.

Sailor:
Yes, sir!

Minna:
(singing)

Yoshika:
Minna, that song was so beautiful!

Minna:
Well, thank you.

Yoshika:
What do you think you're doing?

Eila:
No mention of Sanya's piano playing.
Why is that?

Yoshika:
tell, I promise!

Eila:
Don't stop there. Tell me more.

Yoshika:
I'm telling you!

Eila:
Anything else?


Yoshika:
Oh please let me go now?

Eila:
Nope, you're not done just yet.

Yoshika:
C'mon, starting to hurt my face.
Stop laughing and help me.
Eila!



Mio:
That was a perfect song.

Minna:
Why, thank you, Mio.

Mio:
Thank you for granting permission to see them off.

Minna:
You wanted to go with them, didn't you?

Mio:
That ship protected me for a long time.

Minna:
When I lost him I was certain that ache in my heart would never stop hurting.
To shelter myself from future anguish I swore I'd never love anyone.
But... I was wrong.

Mio:
Is that so?

Minna:
Even now I'm afraid of losing someone.
So I have to make sure that never happens again.

----[ED]----

She's hanging around Major Sakamoto again?
I'm going to have to teach her a lesson or two.
I won't let that little raccoon dog back into the Major's life.
Next time on Strike Witches "What I Want to Protect."
