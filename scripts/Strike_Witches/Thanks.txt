  Last week, the 501st Joint Fighter Wing gained a new recruit: Yoshika Miyafuji.
Yoshika was paired with another rookie, Lynette Bishop, and the two spent many arduous days training together.
However, even after enduring many hardships with her, Lynette just couldn't seem to open up.
She felt embarrassed of her own shortcomings and was afraid of what Yoshika might think.
But during an attack, the two worked together and Lynette attained her first war achievement as well as a new friend.

----[OP]----

Barkhorn:
Chris! No!
Why that dream again? Why now?



Lynne:
Yoshika, did you hear?
They're having Kauhava base mobilized for a missing child.
Isn't that wonderful?

Yoshika:
I didn't know they did operations like that here.
That's really cool of them.

Lynne:
And to think it's all just for one child.

Yoshika:
Of course, how can we save a country if we can't help one person?
It's such a beautiful statement and makes me proud to be here.

Lynne:
Yeah, I agree.

Barkhorn:
We can't save everyone.
Doesn't matter what you do, someone always gets left behind.

Yoshika:
Wait, what do you mean?

Barkhorn:
Nothing. I was just talking to myself.



Anna:
Is there something wrong, Trudy?
What's with the long face this morning?

Eila:
You haven't even touched your food.

Barkhorn:
I had two. There was a lot of it.

Eila:
That's what people say when they're upset and don't wanna eat.
I know something's wrong now.

Lynne:
What's wrong, Yoshika?

Yoshika:
Nothing.
I just got a really weird feeling like someone was watching me.

Lynne:
Who do you think it was?

Yoshika:
Maybe just my imagination.

Lucchini:
I want seconds!

Yoshika:
Coming!

Yoshika:
Oh, no. I'm so sorry, did you not like it?

Lucchini:
Do I get seconds or not?

Yoshika:
All right. Of course you do. I'm very sorry!

Perrine:
Honestly I can't say that I blame her.
I mean you've served us rotten beans.
No one should have to eat that.
Are you trying to poison us?

Yoshika:
Not at all.
Sakamoto said she liked it.
It's just Natto. It's really good for you.

Perrine:
Did you just call the Major "Sakamoto"?
You shall address her as Major, got it?
I don't even call her Sakamoto!
Well, not all the time, of course, I mean...
Whatever, it doesn't matter!
I really don't care if she likes it or not, this stuff smells absolutely horrible, and you should never make it again!

Yoshika:
Uh...

Lucchini:
Hey, I'm still hungry!

Yoshika:
Okay, I'm sorry!



Yoshika:
Wow, that's amazing!

Lynne:
It's Captain Barkhorn and Lieutenant Hartmann doing formations.

Mio:
She's not keeping up.

Minna:
No. She's a little slow today.

Mio:
That's so strange.
Barkhorn is usually such a perfectionist.
Do you think maybe we should take her off the next shift so she can rest?

Minna:
Perhaps.
It'll be disconcerting if we can't use our ace.

Mio:
I know exactly what you mean.
Even though the others have gotten better, we still won't have enough fire power without her.
I wonder if she's burnt out from too much training.

Minna:
I don't think so.
Seems like something else is bothering her.
I think it has something to do with Miyafuji.

Mio:
You sound certain.

Minna:
I am.

Mio:
Let's try pairing them up.



Perrine:
You again!
What was that for!?

Yoshika:
I'm so sorry!
Here. You can use this.

Perrine:
No, thank you!
So pathetic!
It's like you don't pay attention to anything.
You're so scattered.

Yoshika:
Um...hi...!

Perrine:
Hello, Sergeant Miyafuji?
Turn around when someone is talking to you!
That's so rude!



Barkhorn:
I don't get it.
Why am I remembering it now?

Doctor:
Her external injuries have healed.
But there's no sign that she will regain consciousness, perhaps due to shock.

Barkhorn:
Are you sure?

Doctor:
This city needs your attention.
Your sister is still scheduled to leave with me on the next boat to Britannia.
You still okay with that?

Barkhorn:
Yes.
Please hurry.
Chris...

Minna:
I'm so sorry....



Lynne:
Yoshika's late. I hope she's okay.

Yoshika:
I'm here! Sorry I'm late.

Lynne:
What happened? I was worried about you.

Yoshika:
I was cleaning. This place is huge, it took me forever, I'm sorry!
But I'm ready to help you now.

Lynne:
What's the matter, Yoshika?

Yoshika:
Just thinking.
I get the feeling that Barkhorn doesn't like me.

Lynne:
Huh? Why would you say that?

Yoshika:
I don't know, it just seems like she's always avoiding me.

Lynne:
Oh, don't worry about it.
Captain Barkhorn is like that to everyone.
It doesn't mean anything.
I take that back.
She's not like that to Hartmann or the commander.

Yoshika:
How come?

Lynne:
In the beginning it was just the three of them.
They fought all the battles by themselves.
They have a bond now.

Yoshika:
Wow.



Minna:
According to the report from the operations room, we will attack the day after tomorrow.
Please use today to rest up.
You're certainly going to need all of your energy for the coming battle.

Mio:
Hold on. Sergeant Miyafuji, Lynette. Don't forget you two have training after this.

Yoshika & Lynne:
Yes, ma'am. We promise we'll be there.

Perrine:
Oh, gross!
She's completely indecent.

Yoshika:
Who. me!?

Lynne:
She didn't mean that.
But you really shouldn't be slurping your tea so loudly.



Perrine:
I still don't get it.
What is it about that girl that Major Sakamoto likes so much?



Minna:
All right. What do you want me to do with it this time?

Barkhorn:
The same thing you always do with it.
Nothing's different.

Minna:
Are you sure?
I really think you should keep some of it with you.

Barkhorn:
The only thing I need with me is food, clothing, and shelter and I have that.

Minna:
Sergeant Miyafuji?

Yoshika:
Yes, ma'am?

Minna:
Could you come here for a minute?

Yoshika:
I'm so confused, Lynne.
I just got my salary from Commander Minna.
I don't even think they would be paying me.
I was so surprised.

Lynne:
Why am I not surprised you're surprised?

Yoshika:
The thing I'm confused about is the amount.
How much is a pound worth?

Lynne:
Well, let's see. Fuso's currency is umm...

Yoshika:
It's the yen.

Lynne:
Okay, well, then that means at the recent rate a pound is kind of like...

Mio:
One pound is equal to 19.6 yen right now.

Yoshika:
Oh, Major Sakamoto, we didn't know you were here.

Mio:
I noticed. We should work on that.
You two really need to be more observant.

Yoshika:
Yeah...
19.6 yen is worth one bag full of rice which means ten pounds is...
That means ten pounds is worth a thousand bowls of rice!?

Mio:
Oh, is that so, Miyafuji?
Then I suggest you spend your money wisely.
By the way, you've only been paid for half the month so far.

Yoshika:
Really, that was only half?
But Major, why are we getting paid so much?

Mio:
Simple.
We are continuously standing on the front lines.
Because of that, we never know when a battle may be the last one we fight.
Does that make sense?

Yoshika:
Yeah, I think so.

Mio:
They wanna make sure we have proper compensation.
That way we'll have no regrets in the line of fire.

Yoshika:
Oh...

Perrine:
They are in the same bath tub together.
How encouraging.

Yoshika:
If that's the whole reason for this money, then I don't think I wanna keep it.

Lynne:
I understand how you feel.
But I like the thought of being able to send something to my family.

Yoshika:
You send it home?

Lynne:
Yeah, I have a lot of siblings and they always appreciate the extra help.

Yoshika:
That's such a good idea, Lynne.
I think I'm gonna send mine to my mom and grandma.
I bet they could really use it!

Perrine:
Yoshika Miyafuji! Can you please explain how you got to be such an insensitive human being!?
I've had just about enough of you, you beastly girl!
First you gave us gross disgusting beans for breakfast,
then you put a mop in my face!
You slurp while drinking your tea, and then you have the nerve to take a bath with the major!
You're like some rabbit raccoon dog mixture!

Yoshika:
Raccoon!?

Perrine:
Dog mixture, yes!
And if you don't wanna be that, then how about an ugly smelling mongrel?

Yoshika:
Why are you so mean to me!?
There's no reason for you to call me any of those awful names!

Perrine:
Someone from your land shouldn't be so chummy with the major.

Yoshika:
What are you talking about!? There's nothing wrong with it!
Sakamoto's from the same country I am!

Perrine:
Major Sakamoto!
How many times do I have to tell you that before it sinks in!?

Yoshika:
She told me not to call her Major, okay, so I'm not going to!

Minna:
All right, ladies, that's enough.
Fighting is strictly prohibited.
You know the rules, so I'm gonna have to punish both of you.
One week of toilet cleaning should be enough?
Are you gonna respond?

Yoshika & Perrine:
Yes, ma'am.

Minna:
That's more like it.
All right, dismissed.

Yoshika:
Dear mom and grandma.
I joined the Strike Witches, but it's been really tough.
My friend Lynne is super nice to me, but there's still so many people here that I can't really talk to yet.
I think...I just...have to try...harder...



Minna:
What's the matter?
Why are you in the dark?
Let me guess. You're thinking about your sister?
I hope you realize it wasn't your fault.

Barkhorn:
Course it was.
If we had attacked the Neuroi sooner then Chris would've never gotten involved.
And there's no way anyone could ever change my mind about that!

Minna:
Don't you forget we slowed enemy's advancement down and bought time for people to escape.

Barkhorn:
It doesn't matter.
The country wasn't protected!

Minna:
You weren't the only one responsible for that.

Barkhorn:
I'm sorry.

Minna:
Wait a minute.
You have a lot of vacation days.
Why don't you take some time off and go visit her?
I'm sure she'd like to see you.

Barkhorn:
She doesn't know me anymore.
My life belongs to the Strike Witches now; nothing else matters!
The sister Chris once knew died that day.
Make sure you put me on the next mission.



Mio:
Today, we will be focusing on flight formation.
Lynne will be on my wing.

Lynne:
Yes, ma'am.

Mio:
Barkhorn will be working with Miyafuji.
Miyafuji!
A response please!

Yoshika:
Yes, ma'am!

Mio:
Wingmen, your only responsibility today is to follow your leader.
Should be easy enough!
If she changes direction, you change direction.
If she tells you to fire, you fire.

Yoshika & Lynne:
Yes, ma'am!

Mio:
Trust your leader.
She always has her eye on the enemy.
She will give you specific orders, so pay attention.
There's never any reason to question her.

Yoshika & Lynne:
Yes, ma'am!

Mio:
This dual-craft formation is called a Rotte, and two Rottes form a Schwarm, which is also called a flight.

Yoshika & Lynne:
Yes, ma'am!

Mio:
During today's training session, our unit will be evading and Barkhorn's unit will be pursuing us.
Is something wrong, Barkhorn?
Can't you hear me over there?

Barkhorn:
Everything's fine.
Let's get moving.

Mio:
Okay, Lynne. Follow me!

Barkhorn:
All right, newbie. Sure hope you're ready.

Yoshika:
Right.

Perrine:
That disgusting smelly raccoon mutt!
What's that?

Mio:
Incoming!

Yoshika:
No way!

Lynne:
Oh, no!

Barkhorn:
Can't be!

Mio:
It's the Neuroi!
It's entered the East Grid, sector 7, altitude 15,000.
Their attack cycle has been quite erratic recently.

Minna:
I heard there was some activity in Karlsland, but I don't know all the details just yet.

Barkhorn:
Did you say Karlsland?

Mio:
Something wrong?

Barkhorn:
No, ma'am. There's nothing wrong.

Mio:
All right, prepare to change formation.
Perrine will now be Barkhorn's wingman.
Sergeant Miyafuji will follow my lead.
Let's do this quick and efficient.

Perrine:
(Not again...!)

Mio:
Enemy sighted!

Minna:
Barkhorn unit, move in.
Major, cover them.

Mio:
I'm right on it.
Miyafuji, follow me!

Yoshika:
Right!

Perrine:
(I can barely even keep up with her.)
She's flying right next to her.
That rabid little mongrel!

Minna:
Something is definitely wrong.

Lynne:
Wrong, ma'am?

Minna:
With Barkhorn. I mean, she always keeps her wingman very close within her field of view.
But for some reason, she's trying to do it all herself.

Minna:
Hold your aim right there.

Lynne:
Right!

Mio:
Back up, Barkhorn! You're too close!

Perrine:
Captain!

Yoshika:
Captain Barkhorn!

Mio:
Damn it, all!

Perrine:
Ah, captain!



Perrine:
This is all my fault!
What am I gonna do?

Yoshika:
She's bleeding.
We can't move her.
It'll only make it worse.
I'm going to have to heal her here.

Perrine:
That's okay.
Please, just save her!

Yoshika:
Stay calm, Yoshika.
You have to concentrate.
You can do this.

Perrine:
Wow, that's amazing.

Yoshika:
Hold still. I think it's working.

Barkhorn:
What are you think you're doing?
You have to get away from me or you'll put everyone else in danger!
Go on, get out of here!
There's no point in saving me.
Just forget about it, use your powers on the enemy!

Yoshika:
Hold on! I will save you!
We're friends, aren't we?

Barkhorn:
You're here to defeat the enemy!
My fate is to die here!
I don't deserve to live!

Yoshika:
That's not true.
You protect people.
If you're not around, then people will die!

Barkhorn:
I can't do it....
There's no way I can protect all these people that you're talking about.
I couldn't...I couldn't even save my own sister.
Forget about me.
I'm useless. Just go...

Yoshika:
I know it's impossible to protect everyone, Captain!
But I'm still gonna try, because that's what I came here to do, I'm not leaving!
I wanna help as many people as I can, and right now you need help!

Perrine:
Hurry! I can't fight it off much longer!

Yoshika:
Almost done. Just a little longer...there!


Barkhorn:
Chris!
I don't wanna give up...I have the power to help.
This time, I will protect them!

Mio:
The core!

Yoshika:
Captain....

Barkhorn:
Minna!

Minna:
What do you think you're doing!?
If we lose you, what are we supposed to do!?
I understand that you lost your homeland and that must be really, really difficult, but we are a team!
No, a family!
You, me, the entire squad!
Chris is going to get better. I promise you that.
So for her sake, and for the sake of your friends, don't take your life for granted.
I don't know what we'd do if you died.
We're the only ones who can protect our country, so stop being so selfish and stay with us!

Barkhorn:
I'm sorry. We are a family. You're right.
That vacation you mentioned, I think I would like to take it after all.
I'd like to go and visit her.

Mio:
So, I see you finally decided to do it, huh?



Yoshika:
Ah, I didn't even get to do anything.

Lynne:
C'mon, that's not true.

Yoshika:
Yes, it is, Lynne, okay?

Perrine:
Well, I suppose I should thank you.
I figured the least I could do's express my gratitude.

Erica:
Sergeant Miyafuji!
I heard all about the way you saved Trudy.

Yoshika:
Trudy?

Lynne:
Captain Barkhorn. That's her first name.

Yoshika:
Oh, yeah.
Well, I guess you could say we saved each other, then.

Erica:
Either way, I just wanted to say thank you.

Lynne:
Oh, look! I think they're back.

Everyone:
Welcome back!



Yoshika:
Captain Barkhorn!
Your ride is here!

Barkhorn:
All right. I'm coming.
Someday, I'll find a way to repay her.
...thanks.

----[ED]----

Ta-dah!
What do you think of my new bathing suit?
Great, if you like showing off how flat you are.
At least I can see the ground in front of me.
Besides it's still growing!
Next time on Strike Witches "FAST, BIG, SOFT"
