Narrator:
It was the year 1939. They appeared all over the world without warning. We call them Neuroi. Nobody knows where they came from or what they want. But the hell they brought drove us all from our countries. From our cities. They drove us from our homes. Mankind came up with a new weapon to fight the Neuroi and began to stand and fight. The striker unit. A device that heightens natural magical ability. The only thing capable of combating the Neuroi. This modern witches' broom made individual flight possible, but only for a select few who possess the power. A call went out to Witches across the world to render skills to the battle. This elite task force organized to fight the Neuroi was named the 501st Joint Fighter Wing. But these young women are known by another name, simply called, the Strike Witches.


Mio:
There it is. Conn 15,000 at my 2 o'clock in the clouds.

Minna:
Yes, Major. All units, engage the Neuroi. Formation Bravo. Strike Witches, attack now!

Minna:
Finish it off.


Mio:
Copy! Perrine, you're with me!

Perrine:
Right!

School announcement:
School has ended for the day, girls. Any student still on campus should go home at this time.

School girls:
She's gonna fall. It's stupid. ...careful. Oh my gosh! That poor kitten!

Michiko:
Don't, Yoshika! It's too scary. Do you want me to call the teacher?

Yoshika:
No. I'm ok. I can do this!

Michiko:
Yoshika! That's enough! Get down here!

Yoshika:
Not yet. Just a little bit further. All right! Almost there!

Michiko:
Be careful.

Yoshika:
Ok. You're gonna be all right now.

Michiko:
Yoshika! Oh, Yoshika.

Yoshika:
That was close. Someone help me!

Michiko:
Hang on! I'll get the teacher!

Michiko:
Did she yell at you?

Yoshika:
What was wrong with trying to save a poor kitten's life?

Michiko:
I suppose that's why I like you so much. You're always trying to do things as if you were already grown up.

Yoshika:
Hm? Aha ha.

Michiko:
Huh? Grandpa!

Michiko's grandfather:
Hello, Michiko! Ha ha ha ha.

Michiko:
That's amazing!

Yoshika:
I know.

Michiko:
Wow! That ship is huge! It's got to be the battleship they said was coming.

Yoshika:
Battleship?

Michiko:
Yeah.

Yoshika:
A ship that's made only for war. Don't like it.

Michiko:
Oh. Because of your father?

Yoshika:
Uh-huh. He left when I was six. It's been really hard without him.

Little Yoshika:
Where are you going, Daddy? You said that you'd take me to my first day of school tomorrow.

Yoshika's dad:
I'm sorry, Yoshika. But I've got an important work to do. If I can succeed, we'll finally defeat the Neuroi. But, when I'm finished, I'll never leave you again.

Little Yoshika:
Really? You're gonna stay with me forever?

Yoshika's dad:
Yes. I promise. Yoshika. Know that you have a great power inside of you just like your mother and grandmother. Promise me, when you grow up, you'll use that power to protect everyone.

Little Yoshika:
Ok! I promise!

Yoshika:
That was the last time I ever saw my dad. What did come back was his death certificate and a bag of his personal effects. Three years later. They said his cause of death was classified military information. So we never found out what happened. One thing I know for sure; if it weren't for the war, my dad would be home with me now.

Hijikata:
So that's the girl.

Mio:
Yes. Yoshika Miyafuji.

Hijikata:
She certainly doesn't look like she's anything special.

Mio:
Her academics are average. Her athletic ability is average. The only place she seems to excel is cooking.

Hijikata:
Do you really believe she's our leading candidate? Major Sakamoto. What do we do now, huh?

Mio:
Wait and see.

Yoshika:
Michiko!

Mio:
Hijikata!

Hijikata:
Right!

Michiko's grandpa:
Michiko! Michiko, wake up!

Yoshika:
Oh, no! Michiko! No!

Michiko:
Yoshika. Please. It hurts so much.

Yoshika:
Don't try to talk.

Hijikata:
What's that?

Mio:
A healing spell. One of the most powerful. She's having trouble controlling it.

Yoshika:
My power...

Mio:
Calm down, Miyafuji. Concentrate! Relax and breathe into it. Let the spell do the work. You are in control of the magic.

Yoshika:
I am in control.

Yoshika:
Michiko!

Yoshika's mother:
She is going to be fine.

Yoshika:
Mom?

Yoshika's mother:
We've closed the wound, and there shouldn't be any scarring.

Yoshika:
Well, that's good news.

Yoshika's grandmother:
Apparently you still haven't figured out how to control your powers. Remember your feelings mustn't control you. I understand the youthful impulse to want to help everyone. But if you don't learn how to direct these energies we possess, you'll overextend and end up paying with your life.

Yoshika:
I'm sorry. I just wanted... I want to learn how to save people's lives like you two do. I know that I can do it. Besides, I made a promise.

Mio:
Don't lose heart.

Yoshika:
Yeah.

Mio:
Your natural talent is incredible. Once you learn how to use it, there's no way you won't develop into a great witch.

Yoshika:
Wait! A witch? And just who are you anyway?

Mio:
Oh, I'm so sorry. I forgot to introduce myself. I am a member of the elite squad, the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, also known as the Strike Witches. Major Mio Sakamoto.

Yoshika:
Uh, oh. Hello.

Yoshika's mother:
She is the one who carried you and Michiko back here to the clinic, Yoshika.

Yoshika:
Carried?

Mio:
We've been searching all over the globe for witches with great magical potential and a possible future with us. I was able to witness your powers first hand. They were unfocused but very powerful.

Yoshika:
Thank you.

Mio:
Now let's say we put that power of yours to work for us fighting against the Neuroi.

Yoshika:
All right! Huh?

Yoshika's mother:
Hold on.

Yoshika's grandmother:
Are you trying to get my granddaughter into the military?

Yoshika:
Military? I don't want to. Thank you. But I plan on taking over this clinic when I graduate.

Mio:
Well, taking over this clinic is certainly a noble idea. But there are people who are more in need of your power than you'll ever see at this place. I never expected you to just say yes to my offer without thinking about it. However I just know somehow you'll be coming with me in the end.

Yoshika:
And just what makes you so sure about that?

Mio:
Hm? Intuition. Those with gifts such as yours are always led to where their power's needed the most. Ok. You can find me at the port. Hijikata.

Hijikata:
Yes, ma'am.

Yoshika:
Mmeehh! What's her deal, really? They need my power? But if I do what she wants, I'll be part of that awful war. Not in a million years!

Mailman:
Mailman.

Yoshika:
Coming! Thank you very much, Mr. Mom! Grandma! How do we get a letter from Dad? This is meaning that he really didn't die, huh?

Yoshika's grandmother:
Try to calm down.

Yoshika's mother:
It appears to have been sent from Britannia.

Yoshika's grandmother:
Why is it just showing up now?

Yoshika:
Daddy! There's another one.

Yoshika's mother:
Isn't that...

Yoshika's grandmother:
It's that woman. Major Sakamoto.

Yoshika:
Somehow the major knew my daddy.

Mio:
Hm. So, you're here. See? I told you that you'd change your mind. I'm glad you've decided to come put your power to work.

Yoshika:
No! I...

Mio:
Don't worry. It'll all be taken care of. I'll see to it that your enlistment and school classes are my top priority.

Yoshika:
I... Hold on! You see, I didn't come over here so that you could sign me up.

Mio:
Aha ha ha ha ha.

Mio:
A letter from Dr. Miyafuji?

Yoshika:
That's right. I wanted to know how well you knew my dad.

Mio:
Well, I do owe him my life. Your father's research is the reason I'm in the position that I'm in now.

Yoshika:
Well then, do you know if my daddy is still alive?

Mio:
I'm sorry. I don't know. But I will look into it.

Yoshika:
You have to take me along with you to Britannia! I need to find out what happened to my dad. Please!

Mio:
Glad to hear it. Now then. The ship leaves tomorrow.

Yoshika:
Thank you so much!

Mio:
Ok. Now about your enlistment papers...

Yoshika:
Forget it! I will never help you with your war!

Mio:
Ha ha ha ha. Settle down, ok?

Michiko:
Goodbye, Yoshika! Good luck! Bye!

Yoshika:
Michiko, I miss you so much! Take care, ok?

Yoshika's grandmother:
Stay safe, dear. And be sure to delight!

Yoshika's mother:
Yoshika...

Yoshika:
Mama... Grandma... I'll be baaaaack!!

Mio:
So, enjoying your time on the Akagi?

Yoshika:
Oh, um, yes. It's very comfortable.

Mio:
Good for you. But you'll only find that while you're aboard this ship. I'm sure you've heard what Britannia is like nowadays. The Neuroi have taken over the whole continent. It's the front line in our battle against them. Britannia used to be so beautiful. Are you only interested in going there so you can find your father?

Yoshika:
Not just that. There are a lot of people in Britannia who need help, right?

Mio:
Yes. Far too many.

Yoshika:
Then, I..., should protect them. If anybody is wounded or sick, I need to use these powers of mine to help them survive as best I can. I made a promise to my dad. Major Sakamoto. Tell me anything I can do to help. Cleaning, laundry. I don't care what it is!

Mio:
That's the way! Good girl! Ha ha ha ha.

Mio:
Excuse me.

Yoshika:
Aha ha ha. Wiiiii!! Aha ha ha.

Mio:
Um. Check. One. Two. Miyafuji, are you on deck? Wait for me there. I have something I wanna show you.

Yoshika:
Show me?

Mio:
Major Sakamoto. Now commencing flight training alpha.

Yoshika:
So cool! Major Sakamoto!

Mio:
What do you think?

Yoshika:
That was so amazing! You were flying around so fast all over the sky! It was like you were a bird!

Mio:
Ha ha ha ha. A bird, huh? But birds aren't nearly as fast as we are. We are part of the 501st. We're the Strike Witches.

Yoshika:
The Strike Witches...

Mio:
And our magic broom is right here. You are looking at the striker unit. The invention of none other than Dr. Miyaufuji.

Yoshika:
My dad invented these?

Mio:
The invention of the striker unit made it possible for us to finally fight back against the Neuroi. Without your father's invention, the world would be completely destroyed by now. The entire human race owes Dr.Miyafuji a deep debt of gratitude.

Yoshika:
My father?

Mio:
Wanna try it on? Your father was the one who invented it after all. It's not going to bite you.

Yoshika:
Hm. I think I'll pass on it.

Mio:
I see.

Yoshika:
Now I understand the work that my dad was doing. But I won't help with war.

Shirley:
Hey! Welcome back! Hm?

Perrine:
As usual, the two of you have complete disregard for regulations. We're on standby alert. And here you are wearing next to nothing.

Shirley:
Grow up. The lieutenant cornel gave us permission. Besides, Operation says we won't see another Neuroi till 0800. Or maybe, maybe you're frustrated 'cause I'm so tempting.

Francesca:
Yeah. Or maybe you're mad because no one wants to see you like that.

Perrine:
That's totally not true. And besides, Major Sakamoto is going to be back any minute now. I'll be certain to put in my report how much time the two of you spent lying around doing absolutely nothing.

Shirley:
You're so tragic.

Francesca:
Yeah. Especially in the chest.

Perrine:
You just shut your mouth! It's not like you have anything to brag about either!

Shirley:
Neuroi!

Perrine:
It can't be. It's much too soon.

Yoshika:
I still can't see it.

Mio:
Britannia is still about half a day away at least. Patience, Miyafuji.

Yoshika:
But I've already been on the ship for over a month!

Mio:
Once we get to Britannia, we'll go to your dad's address. And then after that...

Yoshika:
What is it?

Mio:
Neuroi. Statiooons!! 12 o'clock! Distance 4000! Contact confirmed! This is not a drill!

Yoshika:
That's a Neuroi.

Mio:
Miyafuji! It's too dangerous for you to be up here now! Get below deck to the sick bay.

Yoshika:
I-I..., ok. Where's my dad?

Mio:
The roar of the enemy shook her young heart to the core. Will she succumb to her fear or face the enemy? Next time on Strike Witches: "That which I can do."
