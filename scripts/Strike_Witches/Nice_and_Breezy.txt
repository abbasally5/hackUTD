Yoshika:
I overslept...

Perrine:
I'm late!
I'm late!

Perrine:
My Glasses...
My Glasses...

Minna:
Shirley, good morning.

Lynne:
I'm sorry!

Eila:
What the hell...?
Sanya...?
That's weird.
How did she end up in the wrong bedroom?
Well, I guess just for today.
Oh, great.
So long as she doesn't go making it a habit.

Barkhorn:
It's morning!
Wake up, Hartmann!

Hartmann:
Just five more minutes... mam... maybe seventy...

Barkhorn:
I don't think so!

Hartmann:
Okay, forty...

Barkhorn:
Get up!
For a soldier of Karlsland, discipline first!
Second discipline!
Third, forth, fifth, discpline!
Sixth, seventh, ninth, discipline!

Hartmann:
And tenth?

Barkhorn:
Do you know what today is, Hartmann?

Hartmann:
Sleep day?

Barkhorn:
No! Your commendation is this afternoon!
In recognition of your 250 kills in service and combat you're being awarded a Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords.
Commander Minna told you last night!

Hartmann:
Can I trade my award for sleep?

Barkhorn:
You can't! Now get up!
Put on some panties, or pants, I mean cloth.
Just cover yourself already!

Barkhorn:
You left this prestigious medal on the floor?
And you dare to call yourself a soldier of Karlsland?!
It's time for breakfast!
Finish dressing and meet me in the dining hall!

Hartmann:
What?
They're gone.



Mio:
Put your hips into it!

Yoshika:
Yes, ma'am!

Mio:
More strength in your top hand!

Yoshika:
Yes, ma'am!

Mio:
Body and mind are one.
It is not a sword that defeats the enemy.
Understand, Miyafuji?

Yoshika:
Not really!

Mio:
Is that so?
100 more swings.

Yoshika:
One hundred more swings...?

Perrine:
Major, you're so close to her. Please don't.
I need sword practice, too.
Shouldn't I get special training sessions with you?
Why does she get your undivided tension every morning, filthy raccoon dog run!

Lucchini:
Hey. So what are you looking at, Perrine?

Yoshika:
Hey you look! It's Francesca and Perrine. What are you doing?

Lucchini:
I spent all night up in this tree.

Perrine:
Hello...

Mio:
Miyafuji, get back to work!

Yoshika:
Oh, right!

Perrine:
Ah... Me, too?

Mio:
Well, good idea!
Yes. You need the training!

Perrine:
Yes!

Mio:
Lucchini, you, too!

Mio:
Hard! You must train hard!

Lynne:
They're all out training again.
Major Sakamoto, she's so very inspiring.

Minna:
I just hope that she's not panicking.

Lynne:
Eh?

Minna:
No. I'm sorry.
This will be good. Glad you volunteered.
We need a guide familiar with the area.
This is a very important delivery we're picking up.

Lynne:
I'm happy I could be of use to you.

Shirley:
No one else is coming down.

Barkhorn:
Typical. We're the only disciplined ones.

Shirley:
Well, the Neuroi won't be attacking today.
It's okay.

Barkhorn:
You're far too optimistic, yankee.
Always be prepared. Right?

Shirley:
So says the Karlsland girl who can't relax.
I was saving that big one!

Barkhorn:
Blitzkrieg.



Hartmann:
My pants... gone.
Well...



Lucchini:
Last one in is a rotten egg.
That'll be you, stinky!

Mio:
Nothing beats a good soak after training.

Perrine:
Y-Yes, you're so right!

Perrine:
Major...
Ah... oh, Major?

Perrine:
It's so steaming. I can't...

Perrine:
Stupid girls! Who left a bar of soap on the floor!

Mio:
Umm, are you all right?

Perrine:
I just... I'm... touching... can't be... I'm so sorry!

Perrine:
Umm, is it all right if I sit with you?

Mio:
Sure. Don't be concerned about rank in the bath.

Yoshika:
I'm really sorry, Perrine, okay?
This soap just slipped right [out of/on] my hands.

Perrine:
What kind of stupid orphan raccoon dog! You could've killed me!
I mean... thanks so much.

Yoshika:
Huh?

Mio:
Huh?



Hartmann:
Ah-choo!
Still little breezy.
Hey! Hmm...



Lucchini:
Where are my panties?
No fair!
Hmm.



Perrine:
Oh, no. Oh, no! This is bad! Oh my! They're gone!?
Now hold on. It's not a big deal.
Perrine Clostermann, remember to remain calm.
A noble lady of Gallia must retain her composure at a time like this.
That's right. Who cares if I have no underwear.
It just feels so uncomfortable.
If I could replace mine... Those are the major's...
But I can't touch them without asking. I must be mentally insane.
I hear them calling out to me. "Yes. Off course! Why not? You can just try them on!"
No. You must control yourself to be [calm or it] would be horrible! Horrible!
I was just...

Mio:
What are you doing, Perrine?

Yoshika:
Ah, those are mine.

Perrine:
Someone's been stealing panties.



Lynne:
It sure is a lovely day.

Minna:
Indeed. It's very peaceful here.



Barkhorn:
Hmm...A crime...
That's for certain.

Yoshika:
Can I... have my cloth?

Barkhorn:
No. This is being kept as evidence.

Yoshika:
But...

Barkhorn:
You're not wearing anything?
Then I'll let you borrow mine.

Yoshika:
Wait! No!
I'll be fine...

Barkhorn:
No need to be shy.

Yoshika:
Yes, there is, please!

Mio:
Here. Take my coat.
This should make it better.

Yoshika:
Sakamoto, thank you very much.

Barkhorn:
What turned you into such a prude?
...Strange girl...
Let's start the investigation.
Now who could possibly want to steal Perrine's underwear?

Shirley:
Maybe she wasn't wearing any to begin with.

Perrine:
That's absurd! Of course, I was!

Barkhorn:
We have to assume that someone has stolen them.

Barkhorn:
Now, given that, we need to know who proceeded officer Clostermann in the locker room.

Barkhorn:
It was Ensign Francesca Lucchini!

Shirley:
Get her!

Perrine:
Those panties are mine!

Shirley:
Wait! Stop!

Yoshika:
Wait! Don't take that!
Come back here!

Lucchini:
I'm sorry...

Perrine:
Lucchini, wait!

Mio:
Stop!

Shirley:
Slow down!

Barkhorn:
Just making things worse!

Hartmann:
Delicious!



Barkhorn:
Which way?

Shirley:
I... don't know.

Barkhorn:
Let's go!

Perrine:
We'll go... that way!

Yoshika:
Right!

Mio:
Hey! Lucchini!

Perrine:
Ah... no... it rubs...
I can't... without...

Yoshika:
You're mine!

Lucchini:
No! No!

Yoshika:
Francesca, just give them back!
C'mon, please!

Lucchini:
But why? You should come and get them!

Lucchini:
Yoshika, I can see you!
Yoshika?

Barkhorn:
There she is! Stop!

Shirley:
This is stupid! Don't run!



Lucchini:
Eila... shh!
Oh please, oh please, oh please...
Perfect!

Eila:
Hey! Wait! I need those!

Eila:
Hmmmmm... Crap!

Shirley:
Where is she?

Eila:
She climbed down.

Barkhorn:
Go!

Lucchini:
Tada!

Yoshika:
We've got her now!

Perrine:
Just approaches, you thief!

Barkhorn:
No way to run!

Eila:
Give it up!

Lucchini:
I'm not a thief!

Perrine:
She's... too... fast!



Lucchini:
This is...



Yoshika:
The alarm?

Perrine:
It's the Neuroi!

Barkhorn:
Battle stations!

Everyone:
Right!

Hartmann:
'kay! Let's go!

Lynne:
An attack?

Minna:
Our battle predictions are completely unreliable. Better hurry.

Eila:
I feel so weird.
It just isn't the same fit.

Yoshika:
Ahh, Sakamoto, I [can't be?] exposed...

Perrine:
And I'm not wearing anything either.

Mio:
Ahahaha!
I don't care!
This is combat, girls!
No one cares about your panties!

Sanya:
I'll go, too.

Eila:
Sanya...

Sanya:
Hey, Eila. You're wearing my tights.

Lucchini:
They're going to be so mad at me.
Maybe you mean to hit the switch...

Hartmann:
What switch with that, thief?

Lucchini:
No switch. I didn't. Not me...

Eila:
I can't take them off right now!

Sanya:
But those are mine, Eila.

Yoshika:
But Major, it's breezy!

Mio:
Just deal with it!

Yoshika:
Yes, ma'am!

Barkhorn:
Why are you wasting all this time!
Let's move out, all units!

Shirley:
All right.

Minna:
Everyone, stop!

Yoshika:
Commander Minna!

Barkhorn:
Commander! The enemy!

Minna:
...is not here!
It was a false alarm.
You can come out now.

Barkhorn:
Lucchini!

Yoshika:
Francesca!

Lynne:
Lucchini accidentally set off the alarm when she was hiding.

Minna:
Also, I've confiscated these.

Perrine:
There they are.

Eila:
That's a relief.

Mio:
Excellent work, dear Commander Minna.

Minna:
Not me. All of the credit here has to go to Lieutenant Hartmann.
Amid the all the confusion, she was the one who retained her composure and apprehended the guilty party.

Hartmann:
Thank you, ma'am.

Barkhorn:
Hartmann, I'm so proud of you!
You're the Karlsland Military's finest.

Mio:
Good job. Officer.

Minna:
Well, it's time to begin the award ceremony.
That is of course if you're ready, Lieutenant Hartmann.

Hartmann:
Yes, ma'am.



Mio:
Lieutenant Hartmann, front and center!

Hartmann:
Ma'am!

Lucchini:
It's breezy.

Lynne:
Poor Lucchini...
She's cold.

Yoshika:
Yeah.
But something doesn't add up.

Lucchini:
That's right. I never would have taken them if I had mine.
My underwear was stolen.

Perrine:
What?

Lynne:
Really?

Yoshika:
Oh, no! There still are people running around the base!

Lynne:
But, who it's still someone's panties?

Perrine:
She's just trying to make excuses.

Minna:
We will now be presenting one of our highest honors.
Lieutenant Hartmann, an recognition of your distinguish service in the field of combat,
it is my honor to bestow the Knights Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords.

Minna:
They're just absolutely speechless.

Hartmann:
Right!

Minna:
Congratulations, Lieutenant Hartmann.

Hartmann:
Thank you very much!
