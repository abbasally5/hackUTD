  Last time Yoshika was still having a hard time fitting in.
She fell victim to Perrine's jealousy.
Then Barkhorn took out her traumatic past on Yoshika by giving her the cold shoulder
and refusing to mentor her.
The tables turn when the Neuroi attacked and Yoshika was once again drawn into battle.
During combat, Captain Barkhorn was seriously injured by the Neuroi but survived because of Yoshika's healing powers.
After that moment, Yoshika finally felt accepted by the other members of her squadron.

----[OP]----

Yoshika:
Wait... what are you doing...
No... don't...
Lynne... c'mon... oh, wow, they're huge...



Lynne:
Yoshika! What's going on in there?

Lynne:
Are you all right?
Can you move?

Yoshika:
I'm fine.
I fell.

Lynne:
I know.

Yoshika:
I, um... I had a dream about us.

Lynne:
What was it about?

Yoshika:
It was something I don't know! I can't remember!
Isn't it funny how you get... just... forget?
Oh, and I swear I didn't see anything...



Lynne:
It's funny. You never stop working, do you?

Yoshika:
Huh? What? Of course, I do, silly.

Lynne:
I mean last night, you were dreaming that we were in formation together.

Yoshika:
Wait, we what? Oh! Yeah! That's... you mean training!
That's all we were doing, just some point training, yeah.

Lynne:
I know. That's what I mean.
You're training even in your sleep.
No wonder you're good.
But um, hopefully after yesterday you can get some real rest.
We just fought the Neuroi so you can forget about fighting them for a while.

Yoshika:
Why did I dream about that?
It was so weird.
It felt so real. They felt real. Lynne's breasts were...
In my dream I could...

Mio:
Hey! Miyafuji!

Yoshika:
It's not what you think!

Mio:
Are you amused with yourself?

Yoshika:
Ahhhhh!

Lynne:
I didn't even see you there.

Yoshika:
Me, neither. I'm so sorry!

Mio:
You're slacking.



Yoshika:
We're going to the beach?

Mio:
That's right.
We leave tomorrow morning.
We'll be going to the eastern coast of this island.

Yoshika:
All right! The beach! I love the sea!
Um... don't you guys love the sea, too?

Lynne:
Yoshika...

Yoshika:
Hmm?

Lynne:
We're going there to train. Not play.

Yoshika:
Oh, we are?

Mio:
That's right, Sergeant. We have to be prepared for anything.
And that means in any location.
For example, what are you going to do if you lose your flying capability out at sea and fall in.
We'll be training for those types of situations.

Yoshika:
Hmm...

Mio:
What was that Miyafuji?
Do you not want to train with us?

Yoshika:
No! I mean, yes!
I wanna train! I do!

Minna:
Okay, I want all of you to meet us here.
We will be expecting you at 1000 hours, clear?

Everyone:
Yes, Commander.

Minna:
Do you understand the instructions, Sergeant?

Yoshika:
Yes!

Minna:
Then will you do me a favor in convey this information to Shirley and Ensign Lucchini for us?
Shirley was working in the hangar this morning so look there.
And Lucchini is... she's probably sleeping somewhere so I suggest checking the base.

Yoshika:
Right. Got it.

Minna:
Thank you.
Oh, and there's one more thing.
I suppose I should tell you, you won't be training the entire day.
In other words, there'll be some downtime between drills so... pack your swimsuit.

Yoshika:
Yes, ma'am. I will!
Um, I'll be right back!
Will you come with me for just a second, please?

Minna:
So much energy.

Mio:
Shirley's in the hangar again?

Minna:
Yes. Since early this morning.
Do you think she's gonna come out for air sometime?

Mio:
It's about to get noisy around here.



Lynne:
What do you think I should do about a swimsuit?

Yoshika:
You don't have one?

Lynne:
I do. But it's from last year.
I'm worried if it won't fit anymore.

Yoshika:
[---] so does that mean you got bigger then?

Lynne:
Well, um, yeah, --- where you think...

Yoshika:
What was that noise?

Lynne:
I think it came from the hangar.

Yoshika:
Let's go!



Yoshika & Lynne:
Shirley!

Shirley:
Yo! What's up, you guys? Getting in a trouble?

Lynne:
Um, we thought we heard something.

Shirley:
Oh, are you talking about this?
Now check this out.

Yoshika:
Oh, wow, it's really [neat] and noisy!

Shirley:
Yeah? It's looking good.
Maybe I should adjust the acceleration on the front a little bit.

Yoshika:
Shirley, um, it's really loud!
My ears are... I can't...
Can you please turn it off!

Shirley:
Are you trying to blow my ears out?

Yoshika:
I'm so sorry.
But what [do you sustain] and what are you doing in the hangar you could really hurt yourself!

Lucchini:
Why are you guys yelling?

Shirley:
Huh?
Lucchini!

Lucchini:
Did you come in here just to wake me up and put me in a bad mood 'cause of so congratulations.

Yoshika:
I'm so sorry.

Lynne:
Do you mean you can sleep in the hangar with all that noise around you?

Lucchini:
Yeah, because it happens all the time.

Yoshika:
It does? So does that mean that you're down here a lot? What are you working on?

Shirley:
I just finished modifying the Striker's engine.

Yoshika:
You modified the whole engine?
What does that mean?

Shirley:
I'll be happy to show you. C'mon!

Yoshika:
What does modification mean, again?

Shirley:
It means I adjusted the energy allocation of the magic engine.

Lynne:
And by allocation you mean that you changed the amount of energy we use for attack and defense?

Shirley:
Yeah, you got it.

Lynne:
So what part of the engine did you enhance, Shirley?

Shirley:
I enhanced the speed.

Lucchini:
Ready?

Shirley:
Right!

Lucchini:
Go!

Lucchini:
Yeah! Looks great!

Yoshika:
Wow, that was fast!

Lucchini:
Oh, that's nothing.

Mio:
That's quite an improvement.

Perrine:
Exactly 50 seconds to reach an altitude of 1,000m.
That is by far her fastest rate of ascend ever!

Minna:
It is rather loud, though.

Mio:
Let's see which she does this time.

Shirley:
All right, Merlin! Magical engine, full output! Go!

Lynne:
I can't believe she's still accelerating.

Lucchini:
Yep. 770, 780, 785, 790, 795, wow, 800km, that's a new record!

Yoshika:
Wow!

Lucchini:
Go!

Shirley:
C'mon, let's go! Speed it up!

Perrine:
Her acceleration is peaking.

Mio:
How fast did she go?

Perrine:
Just a little over 800km.

Mio:
I see.
So that means she tops out after reaching 800.

Minna:
We were right.
It would appear that this was her limit after all.

Mio:
The speed of sound... still remains just beyond her reach.



Lynne:
That's amazing.

Lucchini:
Shirley, you-you set a new record.

Shirley:
All right!

Shirley:
Let's go get something to eat!


Yoshika:
What is all this?

Lynne:
"New record achievement of glamorous Shirley."
Um, why are you on a biker magazine?

Lucchini:
I don't know. I think it's because she used to ride bikes before she became a pilot.

Shirley:
Have you ever heard of the Bonneville Flats?

Yoshika:
Bonneville?

Shirley:
Yeah. It's a Flat made of salt as far as the eye can see right in the middle of Liberion.

Lynne:
Wow, I've never heard of that place before.

Shirley:
I'm not surprised. It was kind of like a holy land for us speed freaks.
You could say that article is the reason you graced with my presence today.
The day it was written I was told about these Witches who fly to the air at the world fastest speeds with magical engines.
I went home that day and applied to enlist in the military.
Then now I'm here in a hangar working with you two, ladies.

Lynne:
That's great!
So when you're days off you try to break your speed record with the equipment you're working on here?

Yoshika:
You have the top speed! That's so amazing!
But if you are already at the top how fast will you have to go before you're satisfied?

Shirley:
Never thought about it, huh.
The speed of sound. I wanna exceed mach one someday.

Yoshika:
Wait. What do you mean by the speed of sound?

Shirley:
It's the speed which sound travels.
At about 1,200 km/h.

Lynne:
Do you really think it's possible to go that fast?
The numbers sounds almost made up.

Shirley:
Who knows? I don't.
But if we don't chase after a dream or we'll lose them forever.
'kay that's all I've got for today.
Hang on a sec. You guys came in here for something. What was it?

Yoshika & Lynne:
Huh? Oh, no, we forgot!



Yoshika:
We suppose to meet at 1000 hours tomorrow morning.

Shirley:
How fun! I can't wait!

Yoshika:
Oh. To train somewhere else?

Shirley:
To see you two in swimsuits.



Lucchini:
Gyaaaaa.
It's gonna be okay...
[I'll just repair it] together then no one will notice.
Hold on. These look exactly alike.
Which one goes on top?
Maybe it was this way...

Lucchini:
There. It doesn't look any different.
I don't think...



Sanya:
My skin is burning.

Eila:
I'm hungry.

Yoshika:
I don't understand. Why do we have to wear these?

Mio:
You'll need them in a marine emergency.
I don't like repeating myself, Sergeant.

Minna:
All right, girls. Everyone else is completed their training.
Looks like you two are the only ones left.

Mio:
Stop wasting time and get in there!



Mio:
They're not coming up.

Minna:
Nope.

Mio:
I guess this means they won't be flying.

Minna:
Do you think we're pushing them too hard?

Mio:
This isn't the kiddy pool. Stop dog-paddling.
Take a page out of Perrine's book!

Perrine:
So sad.

Yoshika:
It's heavy. I can't...
Help!

Sanya:
I'm sleepy.



Mio:
Okay, everyone. Time for a break.

Yoshika:
I... can't... move.

Lynne:
Me, neither...

Yoshika:
Hey --- Lynette, they said we'd have breaks.
But they still haven't stopped torturing us.

Shirley:
You got used to it?

Yoshika:
Hi, Shirley.

Shirley:
It gets easier. Trust me.
And besides, you get a train on the beach.
Nothing wrong with that.

Lynne:
This feels so good.
I love it.

Yoshika:
Yeah, me, too.

Shirley:
And me, three.

Yoshika:
What's that?

Lynne:
What's the matter?

Yoshika:
I don't know. I saw something.
It was flying across the sun.

Shirley:
What was it?
The enemy!

Yoshika & Lynne:
Neuroi?
Shirley, hold on!

Mio:
It's an enemy craft.
It appears to have slipped through the radar net.

Minna:
Damn! The second time it's been two days ahead of schedule.

Mio:
Who do we have?
Shirley and the others are already on the move.

Yoshika:
Wow, she even runs fast.

Shirley:
This is Yeager. Taking off.

Yoshika:
Shirley, wait!

Lynne:
Are you okay?
We gotta go!

Minna:
Shirley, can you hear me?

Shirley:
Yes, ma'am.

Minna:
We've spotted an enemy craft.
An ultra high speed model.
It's already moving in land.

Shirley:
What's its course?

Minna:
Current heading, west-northwest from your location.

Mio:
Judging by its course... its target is...

Minna:
London!

Mio:
Heading to London.
Single unit, take the lead.
Shirley, this one's [owe?] you.
Show them your speed!

Shirley:
Yes, ma'am.

Lynne:
Look how far she is already.

Yoshika:
Lynne, c'mon, we gotta hurry!

Minna:
C'mon, Shirley, please don't let us down.

Lucchini:
Oh, no. Shirley's left the hangar already?
I really hope I put back together right.

Mio:
You put what back together right?

Lucchini:
Well, um... last night Shirley's Striker was... [---]
Um, nothing. I forget.

Minna:
Are you sure about that?
I suggest you try to remember, Ensign Lucchini.



Shirley:
What's happening? Something feels different.

Mio:
Lieutenant, (noisy) return immediately.
I repeat. Come in, Lieutenant. You must return to the base!
I repeat. Lieutenant Shirley, return to the base. Shirley!

Minna:
Where are they?
Time is running out.
They need to catch up quickly.

Yoshika:
She's just getting farther away!

Lynne:
We'll never catch up to her now!

Shirley:
Strange. The acceleration isn't slowing down.
The engine must be doing better today.

Mio:
(noisy)

Shirley:
I recognize this feeling.
It's the same!
It's just like that day.

Mio:
Return to base immediately. Do you copy?

Shirley:
Did I do it?
Did I break mach one?
Is this what super sonic speed feels like?
Wow! Awesome!
I did it! I really did it!

Mio:
Do you copy, Lieutenant? Answer me!

Shirley:
Major, I finally did it!
I exceeded the speed of sound!

Mio:
Stop! You're going to crash into the enemy!

Shirley:
Oh, no!

Lynne:
The enemy's been destroyed.

Mio:
What about Shirley?

Yoshika:
She's um... she's... she's fine!
She made it! Shirley is gonna be okay!

Yoshika & Lynne:
Whoaaaaa...

Yoshika:
Oh, no, I...!

Mio:
What is it? What happened?

Lynne:
It's nothing! She's fine, Major.
Shirley has been rescued but...

Mio:
Yeah? But what?

Yoshika:
Wow. They are gigantic...

Lynne:
Yoshika! What do you think you're doing!

Mio:
Damn it! Sergeant! I demand you tell me what's going on!

Lynne:
I'm sorry, Major. It's too hard to explain...

Shirley:
I'm so hungry...
