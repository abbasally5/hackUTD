Papa:
Mama's miso soup is good, huh?

Ana:
Yes! And her miso soup with clams is best of all!

Papa:
Mama, would you pass the soy sauce, please?
 Natto is even better with soy sauce.

Mama:
Sure. Here you go, dear.

Papa:
Thanks. And ah... could I have the mustard too, please?

Ana:
Oh, no. I think it's better with kimuchi, papa.

Mama:
Never mind the kimuchi, sweet heart.
 Listen Ana. Your father and I are hoping you settle into new school quickly.

Papa:
Yes, now that you are a young lady...
 Oops! I just got some on my shirt.

Ana:
Papa, You have to stir it really well and then pour it on your rice in one motion.
 Just... like... this!

Papa:
Ah, I see. I must say I do admire your skill with chopsticks.
You handle them so elegantly.

Ana:
Haha. That's because I'm a lady.

Papa:
Ha-ha! Isn't that the truth!

Ana:
I'm off!
 The time has finally come...
 The first day of my brand-new school...!

(27:36)

Ana:
Gosh, it's been 5 years since we moved from England because of Papa's job...
 I'm getting pretty used to life here.
 Let see... I speak Japanese, and I even love miso soup.
 After being here for so long I guess I've become quite attached to Japan...
But I was so...
I was so desperate back then...
 It seemed like everyone hesitated when they saw my blonde hair and blue eyes.
 So I had to show people right away that I was friendly...
 I had to prove it...

past Ana:
Hi, everybody! It's nice to meet you.
 I'm Ana and I was born in England, in a corn 'n' wall.
 Oops! Not in a corn and wall... in Cornwall over in England.
 Yes! Cornwall, England!
 Cornwall...
 Corn...

Ana:
But the past is the past!
 I won't make the same mistake twice!
 Anyway, why does an English girl, like me, have to speak Japanese in the first place?
 It's not like it's cool to speak Japanese or anything.
 But it's all my parents speak at home these days.
 I've pretty much completely forgotten how to speak English.
 I am still English, though.
 And I want to stay English!

Miu:
Huh? It's a foreigner.

Chika:
Sure is.

Ana:
Since it's my very first day at this school, nobody around here knows me...
 Nobody knows that I can speak Japanese, or that I love to eat miso soup well!
 That's it then no more!
 I say goodbye to Japanese! From today on I'll be English!

Miu:
Good morning!

Ana:
Oh! Good afternoon!


Miu:
Wow... She fell down after I said hello.

Chika:
You sure know how to approach people, Miu?
 You know, she is a foreigner.

Miu:
But she was speaking Japanese!

Chika:
She was?
 That's right! She did just say, "Good afternoon." to us!

Ana:
Excuse me, but um... what grade are you two in?

Miu:
Sixth grade, Class Two!

Ana:
Thank goodness, they're in a different grade... I'm still safe.

Miu:
Do you want a piece of this?
She may look cute, but she's actually a snob, boss.

Chika:
Boss?! What are you talking about?

Miu:
Just knock her down!

Chika:
I'm not an underling, either!

Miu:
Hey! You're just gonna leave us here?
 Help meeeee!

Chika:
I don't get it, Miu.

Miu:
Yeah! That's gonna be my thing today.

Chika:
Oh, Miu...

Ana:
I already slipped up once this morning...
 But now, for the real test...!


(31:00)

5-2 teacher:
Okay, everyone, quiet!
 As you can see, we have a new student joining us today.
Um... Excuse me.
 Your name...
 Um... Your name, please. On the blackboard?

Ana:
Yes.
 Um... A... NA...
 Dah!!!

everyone:
Dah?

Ana:
My name is Ana.
 I come from England.
 How do you do?
 Nice to meet you!

students:
Whoa, I can totally understand her...
 Maybe I do have a knack for English.

5-2 teacher:
Did this girl really just come from England...?

Ana:
I'm fooling them.
 Now... How do I say "hitotsu-yoroshiku...?"
 One, please!

5-2 teacher:
Did everyone understand her?
 That means "Glad to make your acquaintance."

Sasazuka:
Um... Teacher... Doesn't that...

5-2 teacher:
Go stand in the hallway, Sasazuka.
Now... this seating.
 I'd like... everyone in this row to move back one.

Matsuri:
Huh?

5-2 teacher:
She's going to sit in the front seat.

Matsuri:
Um...!

5-2 teacher:
I'm sure there are lots of things she doesn't know yet, so I'll need to help her.

Matsuri:
T-Teacher... Um, excuse me...


Ana:
Hello.

Matsuri:
Uh.... Hello.

Ana:
Hello.

Matsuri:
H-H-H-Hello...

Ana:
I may have been a little too forward, but... I think this girl is over-reacting a little.


6-2 teacher:
Read from the 5th line, please?

Miu:
I don't understand Japanese.

6-2 teacher:
Then you may sit down.

Miu:
I did it!

6-2 teacher:
You do understand...

Miu:
Why me...?


6-2 teacher:
Try it.

Miu:
I said I don't understand Japanese.

6-2 teacher:
This is math...

Miu:
Busted.
This is an American joke.

6-2 teacher:
I see...

Miu:
Ummm!!! Like I said, "Why me!?"


(34:39)

6-2 classmate:
Miu?

Miu:
Uh-huh?

6-2 classmate:
You know, right?

Miu:
Umm...

6-2 classmate:
You're on day duty.

Miu:
Oh, yeah!

6-2 classmate:
Move this.

Miu:
Oh, my god!
 This is discrimination.

Chika:
I'm not even supposed to be on day duty.

Miu:
I will fight this surely.

Chika:
But it's your turn to be on duty.

Miu:
Huh... Ha?
 Who's Shirley, anyway?

Chika:
Probably nobody.

MIu:
Then, where?

Chika:
What are you talking about...?

Miu:
Chika, that's no good...
 Even though you're young, you sure don't have much of an inquisitive mind.

Chika:
What's to be inquisitive about?
 So, what exactly are you looking for, Miu?

Miu:
Ha! Look at this!

Chika:
What is it?

Miu:
I found a funny place name!
 Hey, Chika! Wait for me!


5-2 classmate:
Um... He-he, hello.

Ana:
Hello.

5-2 classmate:
Let's see... Where in England did you come from?

Ana:
Corn...
Oh, no! I almost answered her even though she's spoken Japanese!
 How do you ask someone to repeat themselves in English...?
"Why?" ...Um, no...
 "How?" ...Uh-uh...
 Oh, I know!
 What?

5-2 classmate:
Huh?!

Ana:
I wonder if that was right...

5-2 classmate:
Um... Where... did you... come from...?

Ana:
Okay!

5-2 classmate:
Yes. That's right. This is Japan.

Ana:
Was that ever a close call...?
I only got away with it because that girl thought I couldn't understand a word of Japanese.
I need to keep my guard up from now on...

5-2 teacher:
Who can tell me what this means?

Sasazuka:
I know.

5-2 teacher:
Are you showing off, Sasazuka?
 "Simplicity and fortitude" means...
 So, who knows how to read this?

Ana:
Yes, that's it... Keep your guard up...

5-2 teacher:
Sasazuka, if you don't know, go stand in the hall.

Sasazuka:
Huh?

5-2 teacher:
So, who knows what happens next?

Ana:
Hang in there... Keep your guard up...


classmates:
Let's eat!

Ana:
Aha... Huh?
Oh no! That was way too close...!

classmates:
Look at that! She won't eat it!
 'Cause the food's so different!
I guess they really do eat bread, do not rice!?
Yeah, I guess so!
 And they probably don't eat miso soup.

Ana:
Hold on!
 An English person will not be able to use chopsticks naturally.
I'm going to have to act like I can't use them.
It's so difficult...!

5-2 teacher:
Do you understand, Sasazuka?
 This is how the British do it.

Sasazuka:
Huh?

5-2 teacher:
Stand up.




(38:43)

Ana:
Silly me...
 If I don't speak Japanese, how can I communicate with the people around me...
 Oh, but it's too late now...
I'm really surprised you found it so difficult.
 It wasn't exactly hard to open.

Matsuri:
Ah, Thank......
 Huh?

Ana:
No...! I've been caught.
Listen carefully!
 I have no desire whatsoever to speak Japanese at this school!
 So, everything you just heard?!

Matsuri:
Ah, Ana...?

Ana:
What!?

Matsuri:
You mean you can speak Japanese?

Ana:
You're actually asking me that?!
 Are you serious?!
 Didn't you hear me talking just then!?
 You were staring right at me!
 Don't play dumb with me!?

Matsuri:
That was 'cause... you had... rice on your cheek...
And I... well, I noticed it...

Ana:
So you're saying you didn't hear me speaking Japanese a second ago?!

Matsuri:
Huh?

Ana:
Don't "huh" me!!!

Matsuri:
Um... You were speaking Japanese...?
 Huh?!


(41:03)

Matsuri:
I see... So, you decided not to speak Japanese...

Ana:
Yes, after all I am English.

Matsuri:
But, Ana, you won't make friends here if you only speak English...
Oh, I'm sorry, that's not true!
 Language barrier shouldn't matter one bit!
 Besides, you're good at Japanese!

Ana:
You cannot tell that to anyone else! Do you hear me?!

Matsuri:
Oh, I see...

Ana:
Will you please keep it a secret...?

Matsuri:
Um... Uh-huh!
 Ana, I just remembered that I promised to walk home with some friends of mine today.

Ana:
Oh that's okay.

Matsuri:
I'm supposed to meet them right here.

Ana:
I don't mind.
 But don't forget!
 I won't speak Japanese in front of anyone else but you, all right?

Chika:
Thanks for waiting!

Ana:
Dah!

Miu:
Oh, it's the foreigner who's fluent in Japanese.



(42:20)

Chika:
I'm home!

Nobue:
Hey! Welcome back!

Chika:
Nobue! What are you doing getting home earlier than us, today?

Nobue:
Why? Would you like to know my secret?

Chika:
Nope.

Nobue:
What?!

Chika:
Listen, Nobue. We want you to meet a new girl from Matsuri's class.
 Her name is Ana!

Nobue:
Ummm...

Chika:
Are you even listening?
Earth to Nobue...?

Nobue:
Smooth blonde hair...
 Clear blue eyes...
 Skin as white as porcelain...!
 Slender... long legs...!
 She's mine!!!

Chika:
 My sister's turned into a crackpot!

Matsuri:
There's an awful lot of empty beer cans...!

Miu:
Nobue gets totally stupid when she drinks...

Nobue:
So, you're Ana... Sorry about that...
 Yep! I'm terrible!

Ana:
That's okay.

Chika:
Look at this! How many beers did you just drink!?

Nobue:
...Five!

Chika:
That's nothing to brag about!
Guess, that explains why you grabbed poor Ana!
Sorry.

Ana:
Oh, I've forgotten it already.

Nobue:
Well, she's so darn cute!

Ana:
Not really...

Miu:
Yeah, she is cute. And she also speaks Japanese!

Chika:
Hey! Leave her alone, would ya?!

Miu:
Chika! It is amazing! Since she is English and all.

Chika:
Oh yeah! English people don't put lemon in their tea, do they, Ana?

Ana:
That's right. They drink it plane or with a bit of milk.

Chika:
It's always been a mystery, but do you pour the milk first? Or the tea?

Ana:
Well, if you mix hot tea and cold milk together it curdles, you see?
 So that's why you have to pour the tea last!

Chika:
Ah!

Miu:
Oh! What about the... curry flavor?

Chika:
Oh yeah! What's your last name, Ana?

Ana:
Oh...!!! Uh... It's not really that important, Chika...!

Chika:
...Huh? Why?

Ana:
Please, never mind that now...

Miu:
I know... She is a secret samurai saving the world...!

Nobue:
She is English!

Ana:
Just call me Ana!

Chika:
Come on and tell us!

Ana:
Don't worry about it. It's not important.

Miu:
Nobue... Hey, what does this say?

Ana:
Eek!

Nobue:
You should be able to read this much.
 Ana... Coppola... Coppola!

Chika:
Coppola?

Matsuri:
Coppola.

Miu:
Coppola...

Everyone:
Not cool......!

Miu:
Don't worry about it!
 It's a great name... Coppola! Coppola!

Nobue:
Quit saying it!

Miu:
I have an idea! Let's all think of a new nickname for Coppola!
 Yeah! he-he!

Chika:
Hey, hey!
 Ana isn't happy right now!

Miu:
Um...
 Ha! In that case!!!
 This will fix everything!
 I hereby name you!

Why me......?



A cat:
Meow~

Miu:
Matsuri!?
 Matsuri turned into a cat!

Chika:
What?

Miu:
Look!
 There's her ears, her tail, she's even wearing a bell!

A cat:
Grr...!

Miu:
Ouch!
 Matsuri, don't scratch me with your claws.

Matsuri:
Hello-nya.

Miu:
Huh!?
 There are two Matsuris!?

Matsuri:
What?

Chika:
Just leave her alone.
 Let's go to Ana's house.

Miu&Chika&Matsuri (?)
