  (1:14:13)
Chika:
Huh?
 It's freezing...
 Ou...! Oh, what's the big idea?!

Miu:
Oh, you're finally awake, Chika! Snow, snow!

Chika:
Snow? ...Oh!

Nobue:
I can't handle it. It's freezing in here.

Miu:
Today is Christmas Eve!

(1:15:29)
Nobue:
I hate this! This is a guy's job...!

Chika:
The snowman looks like he's upside down...

Miu:
Try looking at it from upside down.

Chika:
Nah, whatever.

Nobue:
Hey, Chika, Miu, come and help me shovel the snow!

girls:
Oh!!!

Chika:
Satake!

Miu:
Can you hear me?!

Chika:
Satake!

Matsuri:
 Ah!

Ana:


Matsuri:
Ana, help me!

Ana:
I can't! I'm sliding too much! I'm slipping!

Nobue:
I wonder how long it's gonna take them to get over here.
 "To help or not to help, that is the question."

Ana:
Matsuri!



(1:16:15)
Miu:
There!

Chika:
What is that?

Miu:
New Year's mochi.

Chika:
Oh! Oh, for heaven's sake, it's only Christmas.

Matsuri:
That's so pretty! It looks like a Christmas tree!

Ana:
It certainly does!

Chika:
It's called "heavenly bamboo."

Matsuri:
Heavenly bamboo?

Ana:
Come to think of it, I've seen one in a flower shop.
 You're supposed to hang it up for New Year's Eve.

Chika:
That's right!

Miu:
Wait, can you eat the red berries?

Chika:
Well, if anyone can eat them, it would be you.

Miu:
Ahaha... Cool! ...Wait, what did you mean by that?

Chika:
It doesn't feel like Christmas at all in our house.
 We don't even have a tree.

Matsuri:
At Ana's house, they have all these Christmas lights outside and a big tree!
 You should see it! It's so beautiful!

Chika:
Lucky you!

Miu:
Hm, is that so?

Ana:
It's my mom's hobby to put them up every year.
 To tell you the truth, it's kind of embarrassing.

Nobue:
Huh, I'm exhausted...

Ana:
Nobue!

Chika:
Sis, there's steam coming off of you.

Miu:
Ahahahaha... Let's all warm ourselves up a little!

Nobue:
Does my head look like a heating vent?!
 Uh, I just shoveled all the snow out of the way, so I'm boiling hot!
 Chika, why didn't you stop playing for once and help with the cleaning?
 It's gonna be New Year soon!

Chika:
Yeah, but it's Christmas before that.

Nobue:
Humph, who cares about Christmas!?

Matsuri:
There.

Chika:
Let me guess, it's Santa Claus.

Matsuri:
Yes! What kind of Christmas presents did all of you ask for?
 From Santa Claus, I mean.

Chika:
Um... Well, I...


 Ana:
 Uh...


 Matsuri:


Miu:
I'm getting new clothes bought for me!

Matsuri:
Huh, bought for you?


 Chika:
 Uh... um...

Ana:



Miu:
Oh, that's right! Matsuri still thinks Santa...

Ana:
...No! Oh, I'm so sorry, I totally slipped!

Matsuri:
Miu, are you okay?

Nobue:
So, what did you ask for, Matsuri?

Matsuri:
I want a Harry Potter book.

Nobue:
Oh, a Harry Botter book, huh?

Matsuri:
Not Harry Botter, Harry Potter!

Miu:
Hey! I've been lying in the freezing snow, don't pretend I'm not here!

Chika:
Ana, do you wanna come in for hot chocolate?

Ana:
Yes please, that will be great.

Miu:
Hmm! Hey what about me?!

Chika:
Oh, when did you get here?

Miu:
That's an old joke!


heavenly bamboo: ナンテン（のど飴でおなじみ）
vent: 排出口
for once: たまには、一度くらい、今回だけは


(1:18:42)
Chika:
Go on ahead, I'll be up in a minute.

Ana:
Okay.

Miu:
...Huh?

(1:18:53)
Nobue:
Hey, Chika?
Uh... What are you guys doing with that?

Matsuri:
I haven't seen a Riko dollhouse for ages!

Ana:
I'm... I'm just playing with Matsuri...!

Chika:
Um, Miu brought it up from downstairs, sis.

Nobue:
I've finally got it all packed up. Why'd you have to bring it out again?

Miu as father:
Thanks for taking care of my Riko, little lady!

Nobue:
Yeah, whatever...

Ana as mother:
Riko! Dinner is ready!

Matsuri as Riko:
Oh! It looks so good!

Miu as father:
I'm home! Today is Christmas Eve, isn't it?

Matsuri as Riko:
Yes, papa!

Miu as father:
It's a good thing our house has a chimney, Riko?
 Because if there's no chimney, Santa can't get in!
 ...By the way, is it true that your friend Matsuri's house doesn't have a chimney?

Ana as mother:
...Papa!

Miu as father:
Then Santa won't be going there!

Matsuri as Riko:
I heard that as long as you keep your window unlocked, it'll be okay.
 Because Santa will come in through the window instead.

Miu:
That's not Santa, that's...

Ana as mother:
Darling...! Why don't you go have a bath?

Miu:
Anyway, Santa's not who... Ugh!
...Alright, I give up, I give up!!!

Matsuri:
Ah, um...

Nobue:
...What?

Matsuri:
I really hate to ask this, but is Santa not going to Miu's?

Miu:
Well, my house...
...You see, I...
Santa gave up on me when I was six years old...


Girls:
 Hum?

Chika:
Gave up...?

Ana:
What do you mean by that...?

Miu:
I remember when I was three years old...
 I asked for a traffic light...
 He gave me three flashlights...
When I was four, I asked for a hot-spring.
 I got a secret hot-spring bath salt set...
When I was five...
Then on my sixth Christmas...
 Santa just gave up...
"Your wishes are too big, I can't make them come true.
 From now on, your mother and father will give you your Christmas presents.
 Miu, try to go easy on them...
 From Santa."
Santa is just a big talker.

Chika:
You asked for a traffic light?

Ana:
I feel bad for poor Santa.

Matsuri:
I feel bad for poor Miu...


 Nobue:


(1:22:25)
Nobue:
When Santa Claus stopped coming here, how old was I...?

Nobue:
I'm home! Hm?

Chika:
Oh, sis... Is it true that Santa isn't real? It's a lie, right? He is real, right?

(1:23:13)
Nobue:
I'll bet anything that Chika... doesn't remember... Hm...



(1:23:34)
Miu:
Hey, Nobue?

Nobue:
Huh?

Miu:
Wanna explain what we're doing.

Nobue:
We're all gonna show Matsuri that Santa Claus is real!

Miu:
He is a big fake.

Chika:
...I'm sleepy.

Nobue:
Hang in, it'll be fast! Let's go!

Ana:
Santa Claus aside, do you think it's really necessary for all of us to dress up like this?

Chika:
Now that you mention it, why do you even have this costume set, Miu?

man:
Why are you being so shy?

Chika:
Oh, no, sis! Someone is coming...!

man:
...What do you mean "because"?

woman:
You know what, you're being so mean...

Miu:
A lovey-dovey couple is approaching...!

man:
Why are you so worried? It's not like we're doing anything wrong here.

woman:
Stop it, I'm embarrassed!

man:
What the...! What on earth are they!?

woman:
Oh! How cute! Are you Santa? Is this for a contest?

Miu:
Yeah! Actually, we're giving away a nice fine vacation to the best couple in this city!

woman:
Really?

Chika:
No! No, it's not true!

man:
So, what are you guys really doing here?

Nobue:
Uh, nothing.

man:
A part time job? How's the pay? It must suck working on Christmas Eve.

Nobue:
Just shut up...! It's none of your business!

man:
Whoa, scary! You don't have to get mad, it was just a question.
 Let's go. I find single people so bitter.

Miu:
Now we've done it...


man:
Huh?


 Nobue:


woman:
Oh! Toshihiko!

Nobue:
Why don't you break up already, stupid couple...
 Come on, let's go.

Chika:
You know, sis, you don't have to take your frustration out on others...

(1:25:28)
Chika:
The window is open a little bit...
 She certainly made sure it was possible for Santa to get in...

Nobue:
Look at her... sound asleep...

Chika:
Hey, sis, the present.

Nobue:
Oh, yeah. Santa, hand it over.

Miu:
Here...!

Nobue:
You really thought I bought for that?!

Miu:
Hello, which of these two squeaky hammers did you drop?
 Was it the iron hummer, or perhaps the copper one?

Nobue:
Knock it off, would ya?!
 Let me see... Harry Potter... Harry Potter...

Chika:
Hey, sis! Harry Potter is already here!
The same one...!

Ana:
Just wait a minute, everyone. Didn't Matsuri say she asked Santa for that book?

Nobue:
That's right... I remember her telling us...

Chika:
So, this was a waste of time...

Nobue:
Would you shut...! Ah...

Matsuri:
Huh? Santa?

Nobue:
...Hey, Santa, come on, go for it...!

Miu:
'Kay, I'm on it!
 ...Meeeeerry Christmas!!!
...C-cold...

Nobue:
Um, Matsuri?

Matsuri:
Uh-huh?

Nobue:
You see... the book that you wanted... Um... It's, it's your present.

Matsuri:
Oh, thanks a lot.

Nobue:
Well, sorry to wake you. Uh, we're going now. We still have work to do.

Matsuri:
...Keep up the good work, Santa.

Nobue:
Yes... Good night...


lovey-dovey: ラブラブな
squeaky: きしむ


(1:27:45)
Nobue:
Oh, brother, what in the world were we thinking!?

Miu:
Yeah, really, Nobue!
 If a reindeer talks that much then there is nothing left for Santa to say.

Chika:
We didn't even get to give her the present.

Nobue:
Oh, just be quiet! I'm clearly a bad Santa, anyway.

Ana:
But, Matsuri looked happy, didn't she?

Chika:
And she was half asleep, at least we managed to keep her dream of Santa Claus alive.

Nobue:
What are you saying?
 You just stood there and watched!

Chika:
Anyway, why are you in such a crabby mood, Nobue?

Nobue:
She'll find out soon, so what was the use of prolonging her illusions.

Chika:
Hey Ana, I'm curious. How old were you when you finally stop believing in Santa Claus?

Ana:
When I stopped believing? Let's see...

Chika:
Can't remember?

Ana:
Yes, I can... A long time ago, my English grandmother...

Miu:
Was Santa Claus?!

Chika:
Let her finish, Miu.

Ana:
You see, I'll never forget what she told me when I asked her... "Is Santa real?"
 Gramma said, "What do YOU think?"
 When I said I thought he was real, she laughed. And then, gramma said to me...
 "Whether he is real, or not, if you believe he is, he'll come."

Miu:
So, does that mean Santa's real or not?

Ana:
Gosh, I don't really know for sure.
But I don't think it's about whether he is or not,
because to someone who actually believes in him, he is real.
I think the act of believing in Santa is what brings him to life.

Miu:
Hum, I need a little more convincing than that...

Ana:
Listen, what are you trying to do!? Enough already.

Chika:
So what you're saying here is that Santa Claus comes to those who believe in him, is that right?

Nobue:
Yes, he comes. Or rather, he goes.

Chika:
Huh? What happened to you, sis?

Miu:
She's snapped...!

Nobue:
Come on! Let's go before we catch a cold.

Chika:
Hey, hey, wait up!

Miu:
Carry me!

Nobue:
That was dangerous!

Miu:
Go, reindeer!

(1:30:14)
Nobue:
So cold... Ugh, still all piled up...
Come on, Chika, you have to help shovel snow, too. Chika?
 Oh, she's gone...
Why am I the one who does everything all the time?
 ...Huh? Where is the shovel? Um...
Those girls... I can't get my scooter out now...

(1:31:14)
Chika:
What a day!

Nobue & Chika:
Hey there.

Chika:
Morning! Wow, you're up early, sis?

Miu:
Huh?

Chika:
I'm off!

Nobue:
See you later.

Miu:
Hey, hey, Chika!

Chika:
Huh? What are you doing? You'll be late!

Miu:
Wait a sec! I'll come out the front door!

Chika:
Hmm, I keep telling her not to come in the window. Hmmm...
Good morning!

Matsuri:
Good morning.

Ana:
Good morning, Chika.

Miu:
Come off it, Chika. Just let me copy your homework!

Chika:
I said no way!

Nobue:
Hey guys!

Miu:
Where are you off to, Nobue?

Nobue:
I'm going to school, of course.

Matsuri:
It's rare to see her up so early, isn't it?

Ana:
Is something going on, Chika?

Chika:
Actually, now that you mention it, the other day she did say that she met a cute guy.

Miu:
Seriously?!

Ana:
You mean... a possible boyfriend?!

Chika & Miu:
No, no!

(1:32:50)
5-2 teacher:
And so, just as if nothing has happened, the seasons continue to repeat themselves...
...You're not listening to me, Sasazuka. Go stand in the hallway.

Sasazuka:
Huh? No way.

Matsuri:
The picture book of England I borrowed from Miu is really interesting, Ana?

Ana:
It is?
 Quite frankly, it's all Greek to me. Oh, I mean, there wasn't that much to it!

Matsuri:
Huh, is that so?

Ana:
But the book you loaned me is incredibly interesting! You know, "I was a cat"?

Matsuri:
"I am a cat"...

Ana:
Oh, that's right.
I wonder what Nobue is doing right now.

Matsuri:
Yes, I wonder exactly what kind of boy he is.

Nobue:
Huh... Nah, forget it...

Miu:
Hey! Do you wanna get candy at Meibundo on the way home?

Chika:
We're not supposed to eat on the way home.
 Besides, haven't you already spent all of your allowance this month?

Miu:
Oh, yeah! That's right. Then you can treat ME!

Chika:
No way! You're dreaming.

Miu:
Teacher! Chika won't let me copy her homework,
 and she won't buy me some candy on the way home! She's stingy!

6-2 teacher:
You have a lot of nerve, Matsuoka.
