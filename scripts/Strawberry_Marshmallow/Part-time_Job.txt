 Hey, did you notice that last customer?
 She was a cute little foreign girl with blonde hair.

My big sister?

Matsuri:


Ana:
Mm-hm!
 Yeah, I couldn't believe it at first either!

Chika:
Hmm...she told me she started a new job.



Matsuri:
You really think it might be your sister?

Ana:
I'm not lying, you guys?!

Chika:
Should we go there...?

Matsuri:


Chika:
Yep, so we'll just look through the window.

 If she finds out, there will be trouble.
 ...Guess I was wrong.

You called?

Huh?

 Could you please bring water to the girls at table 10?

Nobue:
Mm-hm, no problem.
 ...Oops, wrong table.
 I'm sorry.

Miu:
Hey, where're you going, Nobue?

Nobue:
You must've mistaken me for someone else.

Miu:
Ooh, I didn't know you liked to wear dumb frilly dresses.
 Is this new?

Nobue:
Back off.

Miu:
Can I take a picture?

Nobue:
Behave yourself, Miu!
 Now, who told you?

Ana:
Uh, I'm sorry...
 It was me...

Chika:
Come on, it's not your fault, Ana.
 You didn't do anything wrong.
 Besides, Nobue wanted to dress like...
 ...I'm sorry, sis!
 ...It's cold!

Nobue:
Aside from the stupid uniform, no other job pays this well.

Chika:
Okay, okay!

Nobue:
Do you understand, Miu?


Miu:
What?


Nobue:
 Don't do anything weird.

Miu:
Loud and clear, big sister.

Nobue:
Stop calling me big sister!
 You and I are complete strangers.
 Understand?

Miu:
Okay, okay.

Nobue:
So.
 I'll be back to take your order when you've decided.

Miu:
She didn't notice 'cause her butt's already being exposed.

Chika:
Watch it, Miu...
 She's gonna kill ya...

Senior:
Is that your little sister, Nobue?

Nobue:
Yeah...it is...
 But don't be nice to them.

Senior:
Oh...look!
 It's table 10!

Nobue:
You mind?

Senior:
What?
 Don't be silly.
 They want to see you.

Nobue:
Huh...
 Oh, boy...

 Have we decided what we want?

Miu:
I'd like the breakfast special!

Nobue:
I'm afraid breakfast is over now.

Miu:
Really?
 Hey, waitress.
 Isn't it a bit pricey here?
 Are you being rude to a customer?!

Nobue:
I'm gonna kill you!
 Damn it all...
 Now I'm sunk...

Miu:
Okay, listen.
 This is my treat.
 So eat up, everyone.

Matsuri:
You sure about that...?

Miu:
Are you saying you don't wanna eat my chocolate parfait...?!

Chika:
Yeah, well, this isn't your treat, Miu.

Ana:
Chika's right...
 I'm feeling awfully bad for Nobue...

Miu:
So you don't want it then...?

Ana:
Huh?
 It's just...I mean...Nobue did give them to us after all.

Chika:
You're right!
 And Nobue won't be happy if we just leave them here, right, Matsuri?

Matsuri:
Y...Yes...
 I...I guess so...

Chika:
I guess that's all we can do.

Senior:
Nobue...!
 Behind you!
 The manager!
 Cigarette...

Welcome.

Nobue:
What's going on...?!
 What're you doing here again...?!

Miu:
Nobue...your outfit!

Nobue:
You tried that yesterday...!

Ana:
Nobue...I swear I was against it...

Matsuri:
Me too...

Nobue:
I figured...
 Hey!

Miu:
Huh?

Nobue:
It had to be you, Miu?!

Miu:
My name is Catherine.

Nobue:
You little...

Miu:
So, I'd like this broiled with salt, please.

Nobue:
I'm afraid that we don't offer that kind of service here.

Miu:
Then with Teriyaki sauce.
 ...With Miso...?

Nobue:
You know we don't do that!

Miu:
Thanks for the treat.

Matsuri:
Is it really okay...?

Chika:
Well...we can't let it go to waste, can we...?

Ana:
Yes, you are right, Chika!

Senior:
Nobue...

Nobue:
Yeah, yeah...

さらに翌日

Chika:
Just for the record, I said, "No."

Matsuri:
I'm sorry, Nobue...I'm sorry...

Ana:
I swear that today is the last day I'll hang out with you!

Miu:
A big scoop, lots of sauce.
 ...This is the last time!
 I swear!

Nobue:
It'd better be!

Miu:
Let's eat!

Everybody:
Yeah!
Let's eat!

Senior:
Hey, have you seen the bottle of hot sauce that was here?

Nobue:
Nope.

Nobue:
Hey, you didn't pay for the drink bar!

Miu:
Charge it!

Nobue:
To who...?
 ...Are you okay...?
 Please be careful.

Miu:
Thanks, I will...!
 ...Lady, are you all right?
 You should be careful.

Nobue:
Yeah, I will.

Senior:
Ah, excuse me, Nobue...?

Senior:
Nobue, the manager wants to talk to you.

Nobue:
Okay...

Miu:
Let's go out for dinner!

Chika:
Nah, I don't want to.

Ana:
Yeah.
 Me neither.

Matsuri:
If we don't behave, Nobue will get fired.

Miu:
This seasonal sweet oak leaf parfait looks so good.
 Let's all hit the road!

Chika:
Why aren't you...working?

Nobue:
I quit.

Miu:
Remember, Nobue!
 I'm against violence!

Girl Students:
That's so funny.
Really? Really?

Nobue:
Well, nothing I can do about it now...

Miu:
It won't come off!




Miu:
 Nobue, just tell me who you like better. Me or Coppora?
 You're not going home until you answer me.
 Why are you eating the hot pot so slowly?
 Give me some meat.
 I want some meat, too.
 Don't you think you're a bit of a space cadet?
 Look over here, Nobue!

Nobue:
Atchoo!
I wonder if someone's talking about me...

Be sure to watch the next Marshmallow!
