  student:
Stand... and bow!

Ana:
So, you're spending your summer vacation at your Grandpa's?

Matsuri:
Yeah. But only for a week.
 Are you gonna leave town this summer, Ana?

Ana:
I'm going to our summer home in Karuizawa, and some relatives from England are coming to visit, too.

Matsuri:
Wow, that's great!
 What about you, Chika?

Chika:
Who, us?
 I don't think we're doing anything that's special this summer.
 It's always that way, though.

Miu:
You three, stop!

Chika:
What are you doing with all that stuff?
 And the teacher said to slowly take our stuff back by the end of the school term, remember...?

Miu:
Okay, Ana, you take this. Matsuri, you take this.
 And since you're the big sister of the group, you get the big one!
 Come on, then, let's go!

Chika:
Okay...

Miu:
Hey! Don't walk away without my stuff!




Chika:
Sis, look! We got a postcard from Matsuri!

Nobue:
This is so Matsuri.

Chika:
Do you want some barley tea?

Nobue:
Yeah, I'll have some.
I just noticed that it's been really quiet lately, and I realized Miu hasn't been around.

Chika:
Yeah, she said she was gonna do all of her summer vacation homework this week.

Nobue:
Oh, I see.
 We know how that'll turn out.
Huh?
 What do you think you're doing...?

Miu:
Independent research!

Chika:
Come on. Close the window or it's gonna get hot!

Miu:
This is Nobue Ito.
 Note the crow's-feet on the corner of her eyes.
Let's get a closer look at them, right now!

Nobue:
Just what kind of independent research is this, anyway!

Miu:
"An observation diary of the Ito Sisters!"

Chika:
This isn't a nature show!

Miu:
Okay, here we go!

Nobue:
Excuse me...?

Miu:
Ready? I want you to forget about the camera and just act normal.

Nobue:
... All right.
 Hey, these are good!

Chika:
Well, I made a lot of them 'cause I wanted to save some for Ana and Matsuri to try.

Nobue:
Oh yeah? So when are they supposed to be coming back?

Chika:
I think they said next week.

Nobue:
Next week, huh?
 There is not much to do till then?

Chika:
It'll go fast.

Miu:
Ugh... Boring...
 Listen! I'm trying to make a film here. Do something interesting, would ya!

Chika:
But, you told us to act like we always do.

Miu:
Well, I didn't mean it literary!

Nobue:
...Show us an example of what you want.


Miu:
For example, you eat this cookie...
 Wh-who did this...? They must've used poisonous mushroom!
 Like that.

Nobue:
...That's how you usually act.

Chika:
And it's not normal, by the way.

Miu:
Come on! Let's go outside!

Nobue:
Nah, it's too hot.

Chika:
Forget it, Miu. You won't be able to video anything interesting here.

Miu:
Remember this!

Nobue:
...Remember what?

Matsuri:
Excuse me!

Nobue:
Oh, Hi Matsuri! How was the country?
 ...It looks like you had fun!

Matsuri:
I had a great time!
 My Grandpa cut me a slice of water melon that was this big!
And then I went and ate so much of it that I couldn't even finish my dinner.
So my mom got mad at me!

Nobue:
Huh... Hey, I can see you, you know?

Miu:
You have a keen eye, Nobue...

Matsuri:
Miu! What on earth are you doing!

Miu:
Let's experiment!
 What do you think will happen if I take Nobue's smokes away!?

Nobue:
Nothing.

Miu:
Then hand them over.

Nobue:
There you go.

Miu:
And... Rolling!

Nobue:
'Kay, give them back.

Miu:
Matsuri! Catch!
 We're doing an experiment, so don't give them back to her.

Matsuri:
Um, Okay.

Nobue:
Hey there, Matsuri.

Matsuri:
Um... What is it?

Nobue:
How was your report card?

Matsuri:
Oh, well I, I got another 4, Nobue.

Nobue:
Wow! That's great! Good work, Matsuri.
 It must be because you've been studying every day.
 Hard work does pay off.
 Smart girl!

Matsuri:
Yeah, but I also got another 2.

Nobue:
Really?
 Knowing you, Matsuri, the next time you'll get all 4s!
 Oh, and can I have those cigarettes?

Matsuri:
Uh-huh.

Nobue:
Ah, thank you.

Miu:
You sure know how to manipulate her...


manipulate: 操作する、操る




Ana:
Hello!

Nobue:
Oh, it's a video letter, huh?
 You sure are trendy.

Ana:
Not really.
 I was planning to send it to you while I was still away.
 But then, by the time I finished recording all these things,
 we were on our way back home.

Chika:
Is there a commentary to go along with it?

Ana:
Of course, there is!

Chika:
Okay, I'm gonna play it now.

Matsuri:
Look, it's Ana!

Ana on the video:
Uh... Hello!
 My name is Ana!

Chika:
So cute!

Matsuri:
She looks like a doll!

Ana:
You're all way too sweet.

Ana on the video:
Hello, Chika and Nobue. This is a video letter. Thank you.
 I'm... at the my... family's second house in Karuizawa.
 With Papa and Mama and... uh... my relatives.
 Every day, English... is what everybody speaks, so...
 I'm... forgetting... memory... and my... Japanese Language.
 Thank you.

Ana:
Everyone speaks English here, so I feel like I'm going to forget Japanese.
 That's what I said.

Nobue:
Yeah, we understood.

Chika:
In fact, it was mostly in Japanese...

Matsuri:
It was amazing!
 Hey, Ana!

Ana:
Uh-huh?

Matsuri:
What were you reading on the video?

Ana:
I wasn't reading anything!

Matsuri:
Huh? But you...

Miu:
Look! The video is still playing.

Ana on the video:
We're finally having Japanese food.
 We've been eating bread all day along.

Mama:
Not bread, Bagels!

Papa:
Ana sure loves her rice!

Ana on the video:
Yes! Pass that seaweed roll?

Ana:
Okay, that's the end!

Matsuri:
Poor Ana, it must have been awfully difficult for you.

Ana:
I don't know what you're talking about!
 It's been ages since I could enjoy the English way of life, and it was easy!

Chika:
I didn't get that impression one little bit...

Nobue:
Let's not say anything, shall we?

Miu:
I'm next!
 Here is a big news flash for you.

Chika:
News flash?

Nobue:
...That's...

Chika:
Hey, that's me!

Miu:
Shock value... Chika boobs!

Chika:
What do you think you're doing!?

Miu:
It's just an exclusive story, that's all.

Chika:
It sure is hot again today.

Miu:
Um, this is the street that leads to school.
 We're on our way to the swimming pool.

Chika:
Are you still doing that?

Miu:
Yep! 'Cause the portion of summer homework I'm focusing on is independent research.

Chika:
What do you mean "portion"?

Miu:
Let me copy the portion of homework you're in charge of later, okay?

Chika:
I haven't done it yet.

Miu:
...What? You said you were gonna finish it in one week!

Chika:
No I didn't. You're the one who said that.
 Besides, we didn't actually divide it.

Miu:
Sheesh! How can you be so irresponsible!
Wow! Watch out!
 Phew! That was really close.

Chika:
Have you gone insane, Miu?

Nobue:
Huh...? Looks like it's gonna rain...

Chika:
Oh no, it's raining! I should've brought my umbrella!

Ana:
Um, I have one, but it's a bit...

Chika:
It's a bit cramped.

Miu:
Could everyone stop crowding me. Move out a little bit, xxxxxxx.

Chika:
Why don't you take your own advice?

Miu:
For Pete's sake, Ana, why didn't you bring a bigger umbrella?

Ana:
Huh!? How can you say that!?

Miu:
You know the old saying, "Be prepared, you'll be happy."

Chika:
Ouch! You just stepped on my foot!

Matsuri:
Are you okay?

Miu:
Stop thrashing, would ya!?

Chika:
Miu! You're the one that's thrashing!

Matsuri:
It doesn't look like it's gonna stop, and the pool's closed...

Chika:
Huh... I'm gonna go look for an umbrella...

Miu:
Huh? I'm going, too!

Ana:
Matsuri! Your belly button!

Matsuri:
Huh?

Ana:
Listen, you have to cover up your belly button quickly,
 or else the thunder spirits will come and take it away!

Matsuri:
O-oh, okay...
Wow, you sure know an awful lot about Japan, don't you, Ana?

Ana:
There's an old saying that goes, "When in Rome, you should do as the Romans do."

Matsuri:
Yeah, my Grandma said that to me when we were in the country.
 ...But Ana, what do the thunder spirits do with the belly buttons when they take them...?

Ana:
Well, I think that they...
 ...It's Nobue!

Nobue:
The thunder spirits?

Matsuri:
Yeah, I was wondering what they do with all the belly buttons they take.

Nobue:
They probably turn them into electricity.

Matsuri:
Really?
 Does it tingle when they take your belly button away?

Nobue:
Maybe it does.

Matsuri:
Do you think so?

Miu:
Forget about that!
 Let's go to the pool, come on!

Nobue:
We can't go swimming in the rain, Miu.

Miu:
Then how about a shoot "Breaking news! Chika's boobs are fake!"?

Chika:
Just knock it off, would ya?!

Miu:
But I need to find something interesting for my independent research.

Nobue:
Will you stop it if we let you film?

Miu:
Huh?

Nobue:
What do you say, if the weather is good next week...
 why don't we all go to the beach together?

Miu:
The beach!

Chika:
You'll really take us there, sis?

Nobue:
Yep! But you'll have to finish your independent research project there, Miu.

Miu:
Yes, yes!

Nobue:
Well, it's decided then.
 Alright... To the beach!

It's the ocean!

Chika:
Yey! Ha-ha!

Ana:
Smell that salty air.

Chika:
There aren't many people here. It's perfect!

Nobue:
Sure is.
 So, Miu... Where is your video camera...?

Miu:
Huh? Why would I bring a thing like that to the beach!?

Chika:
She forgot... Completely forgot...

Nobue:
I should've known better, but I had hoped...

Chika:
It is Miu after all.

Miu:
Come on! Let's go swimming!

Nobue:
Yeah, okay.

Miu:
Chika! Why are you wearing your school swimsuit to the beach!?
 You, too, Matsuri!

Chika:
Oh, it's fine. Besides, I don't have another one.

Miu:
You're not a kid anymore, you know. So you should be sexy like me.

Nobue:
What's so sexy about you?
 You don't even have any boobs to speak of.
 Ana, on the other hand, well, compared to Miu, she's...

Miu:
You know, you don't have much to brag about either.

Nobue:
Now I can finally relax...

Chika:
Yeah, that's the truth!

Miu:
Hey, you can relax!? You, you!
 No-booby sisters.

Nobue:
Well, since we're here, we might as well have some fun.
Ana, to your right!

Chika:
Straight ahead!

Matsuri:
Oh, but she's...

Nobue:
Right there!

Miu:
Um, I'm sorry...

Ana:
Oh, Miu, are you okay?

Miu:
Please let me play...!

Nobue:
Are you sorry?

Miu:
Uh-huh.




Matsuri:
Oh, I can't see anything!

Nobue:
Now, we'll spin you. One... two... three... four... five!
 Matsuri!
 Are you okay?

Matsuri:
Yes...

Miu:
Straighter!

Chika:
Huh? Further? Isn't this too far?
 I don't remember it being this far...

Miu:
No, not yet!
 Okay! Okay, stop!
 Turn left!

Chika:
This way?

Miu:
Now, say you want one grilled corn.

Chika:
Huh?

Nobue:
Are you feeling better now?

Matsuri:
Mh-hm...

Miu:
Here I go!

Chika:
Here, Ana!

Nobue:
Matsuri, do you wanna go swim for a little bit?

Matsuri:
Yes, but...

Nobue:
We did come all the way to the beach, and besides, you're wearing your bathing suit.
 I'll go with ya, come on!

Matsuri:
Mh-hm.

Nobue:
That's right! Keep your body straight like that.

Chika:
Is that Matsuri?

Ana:
Is she learning to swim?

Miu:
...Well, it looks like she's drowning to me...

Nobue:
Help her out if she needs it, okay?
 I said, "Help her."

Matsuri:
Where is Nobue?
 Where is she?

Nobue:
I'm over here.

Matsuri:
How'd that happen?

Nobue:
Matsuri, you swam there all by yourself!

Matsuri:
All the way here?

Nobue:
See? If you practice, you'll learn how to swim!

Matsuri:
Really!?

Miu:
Teach me, too, Nobue!

Nobue:
You already know how to swim!

Miu:
Yeah, so what!?

Nobue:
Fine.
 All right, let's go.

Miu:
Okay! I'm coming!
 ...Where am I? Where did Nobue go?

Nobue:
You can swim anywhere you like!

Miu:
Hey! What do you think you're doing!?

Matsuri:
 The waves are getting higher.

Ana:
Oh yeah, that's because the mid-summer tide is almost here.
 Summer is almost over...

Matsuri:
You sure know a lot of stuff, Ana!

Ana:
Oh, no, not true.

Nobue:
Hey, we'd better get going!

Ana & Matsuri:
Okay.

Matsuri:
Nobue, Ana is amazing!

Ana:
It was nothing, you know the saying "He that toucheth pitch shall be defiled".

Miu:
She's an expert on Japan.

Ana:
Oh, stop!

Miu:
Her spirit is "Wasabizuke".

Chika:
You mean "Wabi-Sabi", right?
That was fun.


Nobue:
Mm-hm.

Chika:
What are you doing?

Miu:
Independent research!

Chika:
School starts tomorrow, you know?
 Is it gonna be ready?

Miu:
Nah, I don't even have my exclusive report, yet.

Chika:
I see.

Miu:
Um, hey, Chika?

Chika:
Uh-huh?

Miu:
Can I copy your homework?

Chika:
No way!

Miu:
But, you're responsible for written homework!

Chika:
...And what are you responsible for?

Miu:
Independent research by Miu!

Chika:
Can I use your desk, big sis?

Nobue:
Yeah, sure. What are you doing?

Chika:
My homework.

Nobue:
Oh, okay.
 By the way, what happened to Miu's independent research?

Chika:
I don't know.

Chika:
No... It can't be...! You did!?

Miu:
I only came in second place.

Chika:
She focused on the uniqueness of each of her friends.
 It was very good!?

Miu speaking about Miu's independent research:
During the summer holidays, my friend's big sister, who lives next door,
 had to become a parisienne in order to quit smoking and she traveled to Italy.
 My crybaby friend went to the country to play with the water spirits.

Chika:
...My English friend who's bad at speaking English played detective at her summer house.
 My friend with not much character went to the big ocean in search of romance, treasure and bigger breasts!?
 It's all lies!

Miu:
If I'd left this in, I might've gotten first place!
 Breaking news, "Chika's boobs!"

Chika:
I said, "Stop it!"

Nobue:
What are we gonna do about that thing...?


parisienne: パリジェンヌ
crybaby: 泣き虫




Miu:
 Woo-hoo!
 It's featival time!

Ana:
 I'm a little nervous 'cause I've never worn a yukata before...

Matsuri:
 Oh, there's gold fish-scooping, corn, candy, and lots of food stands!

Chika:
 Let's go to the fireworks later.
 Hey, where's Miu?

Miu:
 Welcome, welcome!

Ana:
 It looks like she's set up a shop!

Nobue:
Ah... she's a stranger.
Just pretend we don't know her.

Miu:
 Hey, Nobue!
 Over here!

 Be sure to watch the next Marshmallow!
