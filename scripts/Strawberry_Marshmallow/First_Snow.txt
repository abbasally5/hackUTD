Matsuri:
 I can't believe how huge they are.

Nobue:
 If they keep growing, we might have to change the tank next year.


Matsuri:
 Are they really gonna get that big?

Nobue:
 If you let them, they'll get this big.
 By the time you're an adult, they'll be the size of a whale.

Matsuri:
 Really?

Miu:
 Go! Weird doll NO.1!

Ana:
 Why did you do that?


Matsuri:
 Look! Now they're both scared!

Chika:
 Hey! I made that in art class!

Miu:
 That's why I said weird doll.


Chika:
 It's a tribal clay figure.

Nobue:
 Whatever it is, it's gonna make the water dirty, so take it out.

Ana:
 Looks like they're attracted to something.

Matsuri:
 Huh? This?

Nobue:
 It's so cute.

Chika:
 You got a new one.

Matsuri:
 Yes, it's gonna be Christmas soon.

Nobue:
 I see.

Matsuri:
 That means Santa's coming.


tribal: 部族の


(51:16)
Miu:
There's nothing to do...

Chika:
Nothing!? You've got piles of homework!

Miu:
What a pain! I'll copy yours.

Chika:
Oh, no, you won't.

Miu:
Huh...

Chika:
Whoa!?
 Hm... I hate it when you do that...

Miu:
Do your homework later!

Chika:
There's nothing else to do, remember?
 Why don't you go home?

Miu:
What's wrong with you?

Nobue:
Chika's just too damn serious.

Miu:
Oh, I see. She's too damn serious.

Nobue:
Yep, damned serious.

Miu:
She is damned serious.

Chika:
Shut up! Didn't you say earlier that you have a report to write, sis!?

Nobue:
Yes. But, unlike you, I have lots of friends who'll let me copy theirs.

Chika:
For your information, I have lots of friends too, you know!?
 I swear, if either of you need help later, I won't have a thing to do with it!

Miu:
Do you guys have any homework? What's the scoop?

Ana:
Yes, we do. But only a little bit.

Matsuri:
I already did mine during recess.

Nobue:
Huh. O-oh no... You're too damn serious.

Miu:
Yeah! Matsuri is too damn serious!

Nobue:
But that's okay for Matsuri.

Miu:
Right.

Chika:
Will the two of you just shut up!? Huh!
 Oh, I was supposed to be ignoring them...!

Miu:
Really Chika, if you're not gonna play the straight man in our comedy team,
 who will?

Chika:
I have no idea! It's not my responsibility!
 That does it! I'm not gonna waste my time on you!

Miu:
Oh, well. Huh...
 Looks like, today, you're the straight man, Matsuri?

Matsuri:
Huh? The straight man?

Nobue:
Achoo! ...Oh, Miu, can you pass the tissue?

Miu:
Okay. Tissue, tissue, tissue... Ha!
 Here.

Matsuri:
Ha! ...Um, no, wait! She meant this one!

Miu:
Boring. Matsuri, you're boring...

Nobue:
You’re saying the right stuff, but something's not quite right...

Miu:
I know! Let's get Chika to show us how!

(53:43)
Chika:
Haaa...! Stop bothering me!

Nobue:
Oh, so that's the way to do it.

Chika:
Look, if you're really that bored, why don't you just go outside and play!?

Miu:
Okay, let's go!

Chika:
Are you even listening to me, Miu? I'm telling you to go with my sister!

Nobue:
Oooh, it's too cold out.

Ana:
And I heard the weather is supposed to get worse.

Matsuri:
Really?

Ana:
Yes, it's supposed to rain or snow.

Matsuri:
Rain or snow?
 ...I prefer the snow.

Ana:
 Huh?


 Matsuri:
 Well, Santa Claus rides the sled, so it's much better for him if there's lots of snow by Christmas.

Ana:
Oh...

Nobue:
Santa, huh...?
 Huh, it makes me wanna smoke...

Matsuri:
Ana, do you think Santa smokes?

Ana:
I don't think I've ever heard that...

Matsuri & Ana:
Huh! The chimney!

Nobue:
Let me see... huh?
None... Not having any just makes me wanna smoke more...
Ugh, it's freezing...!

(55:17)
Miu:
Let's do this!

Ana:
Paper sumo?

Matsuri:
Mine's done.

Ana:
It's so small.

Matsuri:
Is that bad?

Ana:
Yes! The sumo has to be big!

Matsuri:
That's too big...

Miu:
Wimp... "Chika's nose"!

Chika:
Enough!!!

Ana:
You mean "Chika's flower", right?

Chika:
Why are you dragging me into this...?

Miu:
Would "Chika's ocean" be better?

Chika:
I said stop using my name!

Miu:
"Three Cedar Chika"?

Chika:
Never mind! Do whatever you want!

Miu:
Matsuri, you're first!

Matsuri:
O-okay.

Miu:
Chubby Chika is pumped!
 Ana, you're the referee, okay?

Ana:
Okay. Um, ready... go!

Miu:
Go, go, go, go! Go,go,go, Chubby Chika, go, go, go!
Oh. Chika's lame.

Ana:
Matsuri-maru is the winner!

Matsuri:
Yay!

Miu:
It was ten years too early to bring out Chubby Chika.
 Besides her tummy sticks out too much.
Now, I'm going to interview the winner.
 Matsuri-maru, you defeated Chubby Chika!

Matsuri:
Huh? Who me?

Miu:
Tell us how today's fight was!
 ...Just talk like a sumo wrestler.

Matsuri:
Like a sumo wrestler?

Miu:
Let's just forget it.
...What about commentator, Ana?


 Matsuri:



 Miu:
 What was Chubby Chika's weakness?

Ana:
Huh? Am...
 The reason Chubby Chika lost is because her opponent absorbed her initial attack after the face off.
Chika then thrust her hand out, but her opponent just flipped her over!
 Ah! Um...!

Miu:
Are you a bit of a sumo fun, Ana?

Ana:
No, no, I-I was just making it up, that's all.

Miu:
Didn't seem that way to me...

Matsuri:
...Huh! ...Why, thank you.

Miu:
Okay, let's do it over again!
 In the west is Chubby Chika. And in the east is Chestnut Coppola.

Ana:
You can't choose my sumo name!

Matsuri:
And, go!

Miu:
Go, go!

Ana:
Use momentum! Grab his belt! Sweep his leg! Push! Pull her leg and tumble her!
 Oh!

Miu:
Push! Chubby Chika, don't let Chestnut Coppola win!

Ana:
I told you not to give me a name!

Miu:
Coppola, Coppola, Coppola....

Ana:
Oh...! Shut up, shut up, shut up!!! I won't lose!
Ah, I did it!

Miu:
Umm... Chubby Chika lost...
 Chubby Chika, you're weak!

(58:03)
Miu:
Gee, I wonder why she did that.

Nobue:
Ah-choo!


Girls:
 Huh?

Miu:
Oh, it's Nobue...

Ana:
Oh, dear, what's wrong?

Nobue:
Well... at the convenience store...
Freezing...!
Isn't the bath ready yet?
 Ah, I'm so cold! Achoo!

Miu:
Here.
Look.

Chika:
Hey, Sis, bath's ready.

Nobue:
Oh, it's so cold. I'm gonna freeze...
 (Scream!)

(59:16)
Chika:
I called the gas man, and he said he can fix it tomorrow.

Nobue:
Oh... for real? What do I do till then?

Chika:
What do you mean?
 You'll just have to be patient and wait.

Nobue:
I don't want to! I wanted to take a bath! Now what am I supposed to do?!

Chika:
How am I supposed to know...?

Nobue:
...The public bath.

All girls:
Public bath?

Nobue:
Yeah, we'll get all wrinkly together!


wimp: よわっちい、勇気がない（→Cambridge）
thrust: 押し付ける、突き出す（thrust the hand out で「つっぱり」か？）
momentum: 勢い、運動量
tumble: 倒す、ひっくり返す
wrinkly: (長湯で)ふやける



(59:55)
Chika:
It's been years since I've gone to the public bath.

Matsuri:
I've never been to one...

Ana:
This is my first time, too.

Nobue:
Thanks for waiting.

Miu:
Your scarf is so long! How fashionable!

Nobue:
...What do you think you're doing with all that?
You know you can't bring that stuff along...

Miu:
Oh, are float rings not allowed?

Chika:
It's not a pool...

Matsuri:
Is that from England?

Ana:
Um... Huh? Da!?
 Yes, well, my skin is sensitive to Japanese products, so I always get it sent from there.

Matsuri:
Wow! That's kinda cool!
 Which one's shampoo?

Ana:
We don't wanna get too cold. We should go!

(1:00:45)
Matsuri:
It kind of looks like a temple.

Nobue:
Public bath... Huh, it makes me wanna smoke...


Ana & Matsuri:
 Huh?
 Hm!


(1:01:11)
Chika:
It's early. There is no one here.

Nobue:
We've got it all to ourselves!

Matsuri:
What's this?

Nobue:
They're foot-lockers.
 You put your shoes in, and then take the letter.

Matsuri:
I see.

Ana:
Gosh, it's hard to choose which letter to take!

Matsuri:
Where is "M" for "Matsuri"?

Ana:
It's alphabetical, so it's right here.

Matsuri:
Wow, thanks a lot.

Miu:
Here, Ana. Choose one you like.

Ana:
I don't want any of those!

(1:01:50)
Miu:
Matsuri...

Matsuri:
Please, sir!

Nobue:
Here, that's for 4 kids and 1 adult.
Matsuri, don't worry about it.

(1:02:30)
Chika:
I can't remember the last time I was at a public bath.

Nobue:
Yeah, me too.

Chika:
Huh?
What are you doing...?

Miu:
Setting a trap.

Nobue:
It's no good without any bait.
Wow, it worked!

Chika:
Sure did.

(1:03:08)
Nobue:
It warms you to the core. It's true the Tokyoites were made for hot bath.

Ana:
Nobue, are you a Tokyoite?

Chika:
She is a dirty old man.

Miu:
Come on everyone. Let's play!

Nobue:
I told you not to bring that stuff.

Miu:
Yeah, and I didn't bring the float rings!

Nobue:
Whatever, just take it off.

Miu:
Y-you want me to get naked?!

Nobue:
It is... a bath.

Miu:
What a pain... "You can't do this", "You can't do that", "You can't do anything"...
 Adults just don't understand how kids feel, do they?

Chika:
Just deal with it. It's not allowed.

Miu:
But, Chika, having rules makes people wanna break'em.

Chika:
Dunno. That might be true.
 But what are you asking me for? How should I know?


bait: エサ
Tokyoite(s): 東京都民、東京人（-ite: そこに住んでいる人→Longman）


(1:04:05)
Nobue:
Ana.

Ana:
Huh?

Nobue:
Can I use some of this?
Shampoo from England sure smells different.

Ana:
N-no, you...!

Nobue:
Huh? What's wrong?

Ana:
Oh, nothing...
Do you mind if I use your shampoo, Nobue?
 I should try Japanese things.

Nobue:
Yeah, of course.

Matsuri:
Eek! It's cold!

Nobue:
The red one is hot water. I switched it for you.

Matsuri:
Thanks.
Nobue...

Nobue:
I told you, I switched it to the shower.
 Oh, well...

Matsuri:
I'm sorry...

Nobue:
Just stay like that, okay?

Miu:
That's not fair! You have to wash my hair too!

Nobue:
You just did it yourself a minute ago.

Miu:
But it can be washed twice!

Nobue:
All right, if you insist...
I kinda feel like I'm in a movie.

Chika:
But it's kinda fun.
 You really are white, aren't you, Ana?

Ana:
Am I really?

Chika:
Look! You have a mole here.

Ana:
Oh, I didn't know. I guess I can't see it way back there.

Miu:
What about on my back?

Nobue:
There's a button here.

Miu:
Try pushing it.

Nobue:
That's it?

Miu:
Well, how could there possibly be a button.

(1:06:11)
All girls:
Hummm...

Launch control center:
Three, two, one...

Nobue:
Hey, Miu...

Miu:
Huh?

Nobue:
What the heck did you eat!?

Miu:
What are you doing?

Nobue:
Your fart stinks! You!

Miu:
I can't help it!

Nobue:
Don't fart in front of other people!

An old man:
...This place is no good either.

(1:07:07)
Matsuri:
Oh... Ouch!

Chika:
She did it again...

Nobue:
Wow, English shampoo sure smells different than Japanese stuff.

Miu:
I want to drink this!

Nobue:
Why not? You must be thirsty.
Mister, we'll take 5 bottles of milk!

Miu:
...Monkey fart.

Chika:
Miu...!

Miu:
Oh, dear!

Nobue:
I can't believe you did that!

Matsuri:
Oh, no, look what you [mean to do.] How could you...?

Miu:
Hey, I got wet, too!

Nobue:
That was your fault! And get me a towel to wipe this out!

Miu:
Here.

Chika:
Hey, that's my shirt!

(1:08:02)
Chika:
Wow, so cold...!

Nobue:
Let's get home quickly.

Miu:
You're all weak! Compared to Siberia, this isn't cold at all!

Nobue:
Wow, you're strong!
 ...And a little stupid too.

Matsuri:
We got all warmed up, and now we're gonna get cold again...

Ana:
You're right.
Ah! It's snowing!

Nobue:
No wonder it's so cold...

Matsuri:
Now Santa won't have any problem with his sled!
I wish I can meet him, Santa Claus...

Miu:
Matsuri, I'll tell you something special. Santa is really...

Nobue:
So... Matsuri, tell me, have you ever met Santa?

Matsuri:
Ah... n-no...
 Every year I try to stay up as late as I possibly can, but...

Nobue:
I see...

Matsuri:
Huh?

Nobue:
If this keeps up, it'll stick.

Ana:
But it really is cold.

Nobue:
Huh... Ha-ha!

Miu:
That's not fair! Hey, let me in, too!

Nobue:
I can't. There is no room.

Chika:
It's warmer than Siberia, so you're fine!

Miu:
Don't say stupid things!

Nobue:
Wouldn't it be great to meet him?

Matsuri:
Huh?

Nobue:
Santa Claus!

Matsuri:
Mm-hm!

Miu:
Come on! Let me in!
 Hm?


mole: ほくろ
fart: おなら、おならをする
stink: 悪臭を放つ
stick: くっつく→長くとどまる→降り積もる


Chika:
 Snow!
 There's time of snow!

Ana:
 It's a... white Christmas.
 Oh my!
 I'm suddenly speaking English!

Miu:
 Take that!
 Snow ball!

Chika:
 I'll get you for that!

Nobue:
Okay everyone, let's get ready for a little plan.

Chika:
 Why are we doing cosplay?

Nobue:
We've [gotten a] santa and reindeer for christmas.

Ana:
 I think people are staring at us...

Nobue:
Reindeer Ana...

Ana:
Nobue!

Chika:
 You're the one that's staring.

 Be sure to watch the next Marshmallow!
