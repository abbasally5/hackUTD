  Matsuri:
Ah, excuse me? I'd like to try this, please.
Ana:
Yes!
Matsuri:
Oh. It didn't fit me. Smaller size, please.
Ana:
Yes.
Matsuri:
Excellent!
Ana:
Yes.
Matsuri:
How much is this, please?
Ana:
Yes.
Matsuri:
How much is this?
Ana:
Yes.

Matsuri:
I was asking you how much it is.
Ana:
Look, I couldn't hear you. That's all.
Matsuri:

Ana:
Two... One thousand yen.
Matsuri:
O-Okay, then I'll take it.
Ana:
Thank you.
Matsuri:
Um, you're getting better...
Ana:

Matsuri:
Well, we are in Japan after all.
Ana:

Matsuri:

Ana:

Matsuri:
Yeah, I think that should be totally fine, Ana.
Ana:

Matsuri:
Mm-hm.
Ana:

Matsuri:
Yeah, you're right, Ana... I understand...




Nobue:

 Hummm... It's spring all right...

Miu:

 Matsuri, scream...!
Matsuri:
Huh? ...Eek...
Miu:
Matsuri, scream, would you? And say "It hurts!"
Matsuri:
Eek, it hurts.
Miu:
Say "She's torturing me!"
Matsuri:
She's torturing me.
Nobue:
You know, some of us are writing papers... papers that are due on Monday.
Miu:
Hey! If you don't pop up, I'll have to get nasty.
Nobue:
Huh... Okay, I'm coming. I'll be right there...
 Oh well... Guess I'll play along...
What've you done to Matsuri!
Ummm...
Miu:
Glad you showed up...!
Nobue:
Huh? Why are you the one tied up?
Miu:
Um... Help me!
Nobue:

Miu:

Chika:
What?! I thought I was the bad guy.
Miu:
Don't talk back! Untie me already!
Matsuri:
Um, I should really get going!
Chika:
You have to be somewhere?
Matsuri:
Yeah, at two, Ana and...
Nobue:
Ana? You made plans with Ana?
Matsuri:
Oh no, never! What I meant to say was... um, ana... ana... "anago rice roll!"

Miu:
Hang on, missy!

Chika:
Since when did the victim become the bad guy...?
Matsuri:
I can't afford that...!
Chika:
Don't worry. She's not serious, Matsuri.
Miu:
Hello! My life happens to be on the line here!
Chika:
All right... I give up...
Miu:
If you gonna leave, you might as well kill me now...
Matsuri:
Huh... huh?
Nobue:
Boy, this makes daytime television look like a high art form.
Matsuri:
N-Nobue... Wh-What should I do, Nobue...?
Nobue:
...Well, I guess I should help her.
Everyone:
Huh?

Matsuri:
But I...
Nobue:
Now, that's more like it!
Matsuri:
Uh, thanks Nobue! See you later!
Miu:
Wow, Chika! I didn't know you guys had a cat costume!
Chika:
It's news to me...
Miu:
Huh?! ...Then...
 You pervert...

Matsuri:
I think I finally escaped...
 Hi, Matsuri here.
Ana:
Matsuri! What happened! It's after two!
Matsuri:

Ana:
I just want to make sure you alone...
Matsuri:
Yeah, I'm by my... Huh?!
Ana:
Hello?! Matsuri?!
Matsuri:
Um, I'll call you right back.
 Hello, Miu?
Miu:
Oh, hi, what a coincidence!
Matsuri:
A coincidence?
Chika:
But I thought you said you were going home, Matsuri?
Matsuri:
Ah, yeah. That's right. I'm just on my way home now. Bye!
Chika:
But your house is in the opposite direction...
Matsuri:
Um... Oh, well... Yeah, my mom asked me to do some shopping, so...
Nobue:
Then we'll keep you company.
Miu:
Besides, we were on our way to your house anyway.
Matsuri:
Um... I-I'd rather go alone...
Miu:
Then gimme five million yen.
Matsuri:
Huh?! ...Ummm...
Miu:
She took off!
 Oh, she fell.
Chika:
Matsuri?! Are you okay?!
Matsuri;:

Aren't you even... gonna take a little peek...?
Miu:

Matsuri:
Huh?! Huh...?!
Miu:
But it doesn't look very lively...
Chika:
Maybe, that's 'cause it's dead...
Miu:
I'm gonna talk to it...!
 Huh... It's no use. It only speaks Italian.
Matsuri:
Are you serious?!
Nobue:
How far are you gonna take this, Miu?
Chika:
What would it take to make you look the other way, sis?
Nobue:

Chika:
"Nya", huh......
Matsuri:
"Nya"...?
 Hello, nya?
Nobue:
Um, a bit more like this...
Matsuri:
Oh! Hello there, nya?
 But you are all facing the other way?
Chika:
The view's better this way.
Miu:
So, you're saying?
Matsuri:
Huh? Oh, looks like I'm stuck, nya.
 Hello, nya?
Ana:
Where are you!?
Matsuri:
I'm sorry, nya. I'm on my way, nya.
Ana:
"Nya?"
Matsuri:
Well, bye for nya.

Nobue:
I hear you, nya...!
Miu:
Pervert.
Nobue:

Chika:
Great idea!
Matsuri:
Huh...? Um... but...
Chika:
See ya!
Nobue:
Be careful on your way home.
Matsuri:


Chika:
This is her house?!
Nobue:
It's huge!
Matsuri:
Um... I think we should leave now...
Miu:
Wow! She's totally rich!
Chika:
It's gorgeous!
Miu:

Ana:

Chika:
Hi there, Ana!
Nobue:
I know you didn't expect us.
Matsuri:
I'm... I'm sorry...
Ana:
All right... Well then... Please c-c-come right in!
Nobue:
We'd love to.
Chika:
What an amazing house!
Ana:
Oh, not really...
Miu:
Not fair...!



Ana:
Come on in.
Nobue:
So, this is your bedroom.
Chika:
It's so cute!
Ana:
It's nothing, really.
Nobue:
It's so exotic!

Ana:
You know, the usual stuff... Ha!
Nobue:
Huh? Is something wrong?
Ana:
No! Everything's just fine!
 What's up!? I asked you not to bring them here!
Matsuri:
I know...
Ana:
Swear, you won't tell them you came to practice English with me?
Matsuri:
Yeah, okay.
Nobue:
Oh, by the way, where did Miu go?
Chika:
Yeah! She disappeared!
Ana:
 ...Oh, you mean Miu was with you too?
Chika:
Yep! She should be...
Nobue:
She probably got lost along the way.
Miu:

Help me!!!
Nobue:
Did she climb over the wall?
Chika:
Ana, whose dog is that?
Ana:
Um... his name is Frusciante. He's our family pet.
Nobue:
Geez... Does he bite?
Ana:
I don't think so...
Chika:
Not so far...
Miu:

Nobue:
That'd be you, Miu.
Miu:
Don't just stand there! Do something!
Nobue:
Come on now, little Fruanshite!
Ana:
No! It's Frusciante!
Nobue:
All righty, then.
Frushiaten!
Miu:
You're mixing it up on purpose!

Ana:
Can I bring you something, Miu?
Miu:

Chika:
You are the one who snuck in over the fence.
Nobue:
If you think about it, he's actually trained pretty well as a guard dog... Right?
Miu:
Don't you think his name is too long?
 I know! From now on, your name'll be Fu-chan!
Nobue:
That sounds good!

Chika:
Shikoku?
Miu:
You mean Gifuhashima, right?
Nobue:
That's the train station.
Matsuri:
Uh, I think she's from England, nya.
Ana:
Nya?
Chika:
Hey, Ana. Where exactly are you from?
Ana:

It's surrounded by nature, if you could only see how beautiful it is there.
Chika:
Nature...
Nobue:
Beauty...
Matsuri:
Cornwall...
Miu:
Corn... corn... Half-price...
So, what are you trying to say?
Ana:
Huh?

Nobue:

Well, that makes sense!
Ana:
Are you familiar with them, Nobue?
Nobue:
Oh, sure! I listen to them quite a bit!
Ana:

Nobue:
There aren't many elementary kids who listen to western-music.
Ana:

Nobue:
Yeah, well, Japanese kids are pretty immature compared to western kids.
Miu:

Nobue:
You don't know them, Miu...
Miu:
Weren't they on the Red-Team?
Nobue:
Ana! So, which CDs are your all time faves?
Ana:

Nobue:
Yeah! That sounds great!
Chika:
What happened to the tea...?


righty: rightのくだけた言い方(=rightie)
immature: 未熟な、子供っぽい、大人げない
fave(s): お気に入りの(=favorite)




Nobue:
Wow, you have this one...
Ana:
If you'd like, you could borrow it.
Nobue:
Really?
Ana:
Of course!
Miu:
Nobue...
Nobue:
What's up?
Miu:
I found "Manju Three Brothers"!
Nobue:
...A foreign version?
Ana:

Miu:
But, there is a name on the back.
 And there is "Fish Heaven", too!
Nobue:
That's not too surprising. She is in fifth grade.
Ana:
Actually, to tell the truth, Nobue...
I got them in kindergarten.
Miu:
Were "The Manju Three Brothers" together back then?
Ana:

Miu:
Fine...
Ana:
Huh?
Nobue:
Ana... Coppora.
Miu:
It looks great!
Ana:
Don't paint things without asking!
Miu:
But, it looks really good there.
Ana:

Nobue:
You shouldn't get upset about it.
Ana:
Why, Nobue?
Nobue:

Miu:
Yeah. But if it's weird, it's weird...
Nobue:
I don't think it's that bad...

Ana:
Oh Nobue...
Nobue:

Miu:
But, when a Japanese person hears that, they'll laugh!
Nobue:
It's not the name that matters; it's what's inside that counts...
Ana:
Nobue...
Nobue:
If you believe in yourself Ana Coppora, then I don't think anyone will pay attention to your name...
Miu:
But in reality, your name alone can dictate your character, and actually, for that matter, your entire fate can be decided by your name.
Nobue:
Don't worry. If we shut her up, no one at school ever has to hear about it.
Miu:
Why? I was just telling the truth!
Nobue:
If you keep saying that, I'll give you a weird nickname!
Miu:
Yeah, like what? Like what?
Nobue:
Kondosare Shibamata!
Miu:
Why that?
Nobue:
Just go away, Kondosare Shibamata!
Miu:

Nobue:
Huh?
Miu:

Nobue:
Huh?! Wow Miu, that's not amazing you're just flexible!
Miu:
For your information, at school I'm called "Hiroshou's Gazelle".
Nobue:
"Gazelle" means you're fast on your feet, doofus.
Chika:
We drank all the tea.
Miu:

Matsuri:
Huh? You want me?
Miu:

 Matsuri, you're not very bendable for a cat, you know.
Nobue:
No, you're just too bendable, Miu...
Chika:
Nobue, what are you guys doing...?
Miu:
Okay, Chika. You're next!
Chika:

Miu:

 Well, if you're flexible...
 You could easily pick it up!
Chika:
You can squat.
Miu:
Okay, Coppora. Let...uh!
 Hey...!
Chika:
Why'd you kick us out?
Nobue:
Just leave us alone.
Miu:
Well, let's take a look around the house.

Miu:
There're so many clothes!
 Wow, look at all the clothes!
 Uh, can you hit me on the back?
Chika:
Won't work!
Nobue:
Hey guys, we really need to get going soon.
Miu:
Oooh... How come?
Nobue:
I'm sorry, Ana. She's an idiot, will you forgive her?
Ana:
Mm-hm...

Ana:
Oh! That book...! It's my... it's my...
Nobue:
Oh, wow! Ana, you mean you're teaching your friend how to speak English?
Ana:

Nobue:

 Oh! This is very pretty. How much is this?

Ana:
T-two... um, one thousand yen.
Matsuri:
Hey, you know what you've really improved, nya!


snoop: コソコソ詮索する
doofus: バカ、アホ



Ana:
You won’t believe in!
I’m positive I just saw someone frilly and ruffled at the restaurant!
 
Chika:
Calm down, Ana.
Now, what exactly did you see?
 
Ana:
This, this, that, and the other!
 
Matsuri:
Nobue got a part time job?
 
Ana:
Ahahahahaha…!
 
Chika:
Hey, Miu!
When did you get here?
 
Miu:
Let’s go check it out right away.
Come on!
 
Chika:
Hey, wait!
 
Ana:
Oh, no!
I’ve unleashed a monster…
 
Matsuri:
Really?
 
 
Be sure to watch next Marshmallow!
