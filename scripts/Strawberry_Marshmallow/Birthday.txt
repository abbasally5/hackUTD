Nobue:
 What a beautiful day.

Nobue:
 So, how's it going? I'm Nobue Itou.
 As you can see, I'm just your average 16-year-old.

Nobue:
 Okay, that's a lie. I'm actually a 20-year-old college student.
 Hmm...

Nobue:
 Anyway, let me introduce you to my piggy bank.
 Aha... I mean my adorable little sister.

Nobue:
 Knock knock. I'm coming in, Chi.

Nobue:
 Chi, can you hear me?

Nobue:
 Oh! She's learning how to make desserts.
 Impressive!
 Yummy, are you full yet?

Chika:
 Whoa! Oooh ! Huh, huh?
 Sis, I wish you'd knock first.

Nobue:
 I did. But you didn't notice.

Chika:
 Huh? Seriously? Sorry.

Nobue:
 This is my little sister Chika. She is 12 and in sixth grade.
 Um, her distinguishing trait is her total lack of distinguishing traits.

Chika:
 What's going on, Sis?

Nobue:
 Huh? Nothing special.
 Put your leg down and sit properly.

Chika:
 Mm, what is it? Huh?


Nobue:
 See?

Chika:
 Not really, see what?

Nobue:
 You couldn't stand up right now even if you wanted to.

Chika:
 No, I couldn't. Not with your finger stuck in my face.


(3:58)
Miu:
Hahaha.

Nobue and Chika:
?

Chika:
 Try using the front door, Miu.
 It's a lot easier.

Miu:
 Ah... What are you guys doing in here, huh?

Nobue:
 That's what I should be asking you, right?

Chika:
 My sister was just taking a picture of me, and...

Miu:
 What?!
 Take one of me, too!

Nobue:
 You?

Miu:
 Take a picture of me, Nobue.
 My outfit's brand new. My mom just got it for me.

Nobue:
 Okay.

Miu:
 Ah?

Nobue:
 So, what's with the innocent look all of a sudden?


Miu:
 My pretty girl face.

Nobue:
 A pretty face, huh?

Miu:
 Hurry and take it.

Nobue:
 A cup.


Miu:
 Ugh!

Nobue:
 This is Miu Matsuoka.
 She's in sixth grade, too, and she's been friends with Chi since they were little.
 She's always crossing the roofs and bursting in like she did a minute ago.

Nobue:
 Humph. Nice shot.

Miu:
 That was sneaky! Shame on you!
 I'm bored. Can you think of anything fun to do?

Nobue:
 I've known Miu for ages, but I still don't have a clue what's going on in that head of hers.


Chika:
So, what did you come in here for, big sis?

Nobue:
 Huh? Yeah right. There was something I wanted to ask you... What was it?

Chika:
 Hello? How should I know?

Miu:
 Boy, you sure are forgetful. Now that you're so old...


Nobue:
 It was something super important, too.

Miu:
 I know what it was.
 You wanted to give me and Chika a little bit of spending money.

Chika:
 Not likely, Miu.

Nobue:
 What are you talking about? How do you know?

Miu:
 'Cuz, you said you'd give it to me.

Nobue:
 I never told you that!

Nobue and Chika and Miu:



(5:46)
Matsuri:
Hello. It's me.


Nobue:
 Hi, come on in. 

Nobue:
 This is Matsuri Sakuragi.
 She's from the neighborhood.
 She's 11 and in the fifth grade.

Masturi:
 I was really looking forward to the pudding I'd saved.
 Then my dad went and ate it...

Nobue:
 Oh... That wasn't very nice of him, was it?
 Look. I'll buy you another pudding.
 So don't cry. 'Kay?

Matsuri:
 Oh, thank you. That'd be nice.

Miu:
 I-I want a pudding, too.

Nobue:
 No way.

Miu:
Discrimination! That's so unfair!


Nobue:
What was it?
 Okay, I'm out of here.


Chika:
 I wonder what it was she wanted to talk about.

Nobue:
Cigarettes. That was it.

Nobue:
Yep. Things sure can change in just a few seconds.

Miu:
Miu flung herself at Matsuri.
It was quick.

Nobue:
What's the trash can got to do with it? Enlighten me.

Nobue:
Oh, never mind.
 If you try to stand up right now.

Chika:
Yah yah, you already said that.

Nobue:
 Chi, where's your wallet?

Chika:
 Wait a minute.

Nobue:
 I'm having some cash flow probs so I need to borrow this.
 I'll pay you back soon.

Chika:
 How much are cigarettes?

Nobue:
 50,000 yen.

Chika:
 Quit smoking then.

Nobue:
 No no, I'm joking, Sis.
 They are only 2,000 yen.

Chika:
 For one pack?

Nobue:
 No, I buy them in bulk!
 I can't keep coming back to you for money, you know!

Chika:
 You have to promise you'll pay me back this month.
 With a hundred yen you can buy one pack, right?

Nobue:
 Chi, when I get paid, I'll buy all I want!

Chika:
 Pay me back my 100 yen.

Nobue:
 Whatever.

Matsuri:
Nobue please help me!

Nobue:
 Oh, I almost forgot.

Nobue:

Hey, do you guys know what day it is tomorrow?


Matsuri:
Hm?


Chika:
 Tomorrow?

Miu:
Dunno.

Nobue:
 I see.
 Oh, well.
 Doesn't matter.
 Wow, you're sure getting big.
 This is Satake.
 As you can see, he is a tiger.
 Well, see ya.


(8:35)
Miu:
Why'd you leave when I came over here to play?


Chika:
 Miu, did you do your homework?

Miu:
What about you?

Chika:
 I'm finished.

Miu:
Can I see it?

Chika:
 Nope.

Miu:
 But don't you think our teacher can be awfully scary when you forget your homework, Chika?


Chika:
 Not gonna show you.

Miu:
Chika, don't be so uptight! Come on! Let me have a peek.

Chika:
 No way. You're just gonna copy mine word for word.

Teacher:
Itou and Matsuoka.
Your answers are exactly the same.

Miu:
I copied hers.

Teacher:
Both of you stand up here.

Miu:
I'm so bored.
 Let's go play.

Chika:
 Stop it, would ya?!


(9:34)
Miu:
Hey! Look look.
 I bet you can't swing this high.

Chika:
 Don't you think we're a little too old for that?


Matsuri:
Uh-huh.

Miu:
Hey, doesn't it feel like we're forgetting something?


Chika:
 Like what? Huh?

Matsuri:
I don't know, but we are starting to sound like Nobue always forgetting stuff.

Chika:
 Huh.
 She asked what tomorrow was.
 Is there something going on then?

Matsuri:
Um, let's see.
 Today is Sunday, right? So tomorrow is... Monday?

Chika:
 You're just pretending to be dopey, right?

Matsuri:
Uh. Yeah.

Miu:
Massachusetts!
 Chika, what's the date?!

Chika:
 Um, it's the 17th, isn't it?

Miu:
So, what day is it tomorrow?

Chika:
 Are you stupid?

Miu:
Look that way for a sec.
 Chi-ka, so?

Chika:
 Yeah, so what's the big deal?

Miu:
What's the big deal?!
 Tomorrow is Nobue's birthday!


Eye Catches

(10:59)
Chika:
Her birthday...?
 Yeah, that's right!

Miu:
Why are you so forgetful, Chika?

Chika:
It's not that!
 My sister isn't all that interested in celebrations and holidays.

Miu:
Oh...

Matsuri:
I see it's her birthday tomorrow...

Miu:
You should at least give her a present, you know?

Chika:
Sure...
 But I don't have a whole lot of money.

Miu:
What?!
 Oh, I know. How about a nice home-made gift?

Chika:
Like what?

Miu:
Hmmm... Let me see...

Matsuri:
Why don't we pick some nice flowers, and make a hair-decoration for her?

Chika & Miu:
Won't suit her!

Miu:
How about making an ashtray?

Chika:
Yeah...! The one she's got is pretty disgusting... Good idea!

Matsuri:
Oh, and we could also make her a birthday card from all three of us!

Chika:
Yeah! Sounds great!

Matsuri:
...But, Chika, how on earth are we gonna make an ashtray for her?

Chika:
I think that we can make it with molding clay.

Matsuri:
Oh! I have a couple of packages of molding clay at my home!

Miu:
Then it's settled!

Chika:
So, we'll do it tomorrow afternoon after school.

Matsuri:
'Kay.

Miu:
What're you guys talking about?!

Chika & Matsuri:
Huh?

Miu:
Not tomorrow! No, it has to be today!

Matsuri:
Why today...?

Miu:
It's only a day away.

Chika:
Ah, but it's already so late, and...

Matsuri:
Mm-hm.

Miu:
You agreed, so you have to.
 Let's start big meeting at Chika's house!

Chika:
For real?


(12:57)
Chika:
Matsuri, did you let your parents know?

Matsuri:
Mm-hm. Yes, I told them I'd be staying at your house tonight.

Miu:
'Kay, here's an example of the ashtray... we're gonna make today.

Chika:
Matsuri, what do you think of this design?

Matsuri:
Oh, it's cute!

Miu:
At least, react to my design.
 It's your duty.

Nobue:
You're still playing?

Chika:
I told you to knock, Sis?!

Nobue:
Yeah, yeah. It's six thirty, so you should all be...

Miu:
I... was just about to leave!

Nobue:
Why are you guys acting so jumpy?

Miu:
It's nothing...!

Nobue:
Matsuri, do you want me to take you home?

Matsuri:
No, um, my house is so close, anyway.

Nobue:
'Kay, but you better go before it gets dark.

Miu:
She will!

Nobue:
...Well, I'm off to work.

girls:
Okay! Good-bye!

Nobue:
What's up with them...?


(13:56)
Miu:
All right! Nobue is gone!

Matsuri:
My heart's pounding right out of my chest!

Chika:
All right, then let's dive in!

Miu:
Wait!
 I'm hungry...

Chika:
We haven't even started yet!

Miu:
Yeah, but... We need strength to mold the clay, and eating will give us more energy!

Chika:
So, go home and eat!

Miu:
We can't waste even a second, right?

Chika:
Why don't you just be honest and say you wanna eat our food?

Miu:
That's exactly what I was saying.

Miu:
Thanks!

Matsuri:
Thank you.

Miu:
Yeah... That's better. My tummy is full now. I think I'll go to bed...!

Chika:
Hey! What happened to making the ashtray, tonight?!

Miu:
What? You wanna make it now?

Chika:
It was your idea, remember?!

Matsuri:
Come on, let's do it! For Nobue!

Chika:
Matsuri's sure enthusiastic.

Miu:
Huh, you really should follow her example.

Chika:
You mean you should! You...

Miu:
Huh...?
 You rolled up your sleeves, that's it?

Matsuri:
Oh, sorry about that.
 This is the time I usually get ready for bed.

Chika:
Yeah, I understand...
 Huh? What are you writing, Miu?

Chika:
Wow, you're really serious, aren't you, Miu!

Miu:
When it's about Nobue, of course!
 Do a good job.

Chika:
Shall we pull her out on three?

Matsuri:
Mm-hm.

Chika:
Ou...!

Matsuri:
...ch...!

Chika:
Why hit us?!

Miu:
If you fall asleep again, you'll regret it!

Chika:
When did you... make that...?

Miu:
Just now.

Chika:
Make the ashtray!

Chika:
Matsuri, Matsuri...!
 Hey, Miu!

Miu:
I wasn't sleeping, I was just unconscious...

Chika:
That's the same thing!
 ... Go to wash my face...

Matsuri:
Me too...

Miu:
Together...

Miu:
Don't fall asleep!!!
 I said if you fall asleep again, you'll regret it 'cause I'll hit you with the fan, are you ready...?

Chika:
No mercy!


Chika:
Well, coffee helps you stay awake.
 At least, that's what Nobue says...

Miu:
Is this really gonna wake us up, Chika...?

Chika:
Dunno...

Miu:
How was that...?

Matsuri:
Hummm... It's bitter...

Chika:
But, I think I'm a little less sleepy!

Matsuri:
Maybe...?

Miu:
It must be nice... being... so dumb.
I wish that I could say the same thing...

Miu:
Next we're gonna try using... ice to wake us up!

Matsuri:
It's cold.

Chika:
Think this will actually work, Miu?

Miu:
Well, it's better than nothing.
 That's gross!

Chika:
Huh?

Miu:
Wake up!


Chika and Matsuri:
Huh?


Miu:
Aren't you embarrassed that you're letting your sleepiness get the better of you?

Chika:
That'd be you.

Miu:
Won't give in.
Let's not forget about our reflexes.

Matsuri:
What are you doing...?

Miu:
Like this. One... two... whack!
 You see, Chika? When you hit the shin bone like that, your leg kicks up automatically.

Chika:
That was her knee...

Miu:
Ha! I am not going to give in to this.
 Try hitting it. Go on!

Chika:
Huh... All right.
 You're losing big time...!

Miu:
Damn! It doesn't have anything to do with winning or losing!

Chika:
Okay, I get it. Let's finish the gift!

Matsuri:
Yes, we're almost done, Miu.

Chika:
Flicking time!

Matsuri:
More Chili peppers...

Miu:
Stop it!

(19:10)
Nobue:
So tired...
 Huh... Kids these days... Hey guys!
 What time do you...?

Miu:
Nobue!

Matsuri:
Happy.

Chika:
Birthday.

Nobue:
They didn't have to work on this till the middle of the night.
 Huh?


(20:59)
Chika:
Hey, why didn't you wake me up, Sis?!
 Now, I'm gonna be late for...

Miu:
I'm just gonna say I slept in, so I'm skipping school.

Chika:
Cut it out! Our teacher won't buy that excuse anyway, Miu?

Miu:
Yeah, she usually gets furious.

Chika:
Exactry!
 What are you smiling for, Miu?

Miu:
Thirty minutes has gone by.


Chika:
I'm off!

Miu:
Wait!

Chika:
Matsuri!
 Let's go!

Matsuri:
Um... Okay...
 ...Huh? Chika, what is...

Miu:
It's another beautiful day today!
 Let's go, Chika!

Chika:
Huh?



(23:27 Be sure to watch next Marshmallow!)
Miu:
You'll never believe it!
 There's a new student coming to our school and she's from England.

Chika:
Yeah, I know!
 She's in the fifth grade, class two, right?
 The same class as Matsuri.
 I wonder if we get along with her.

Miu:
I don't know.
 She had a problem on Japanese food at lunch.
 I have a stinking feeling that Nobue's gonna adore her.
 Do something, Chika.

Chika:
Ah... like what?

Miu&Chika:
Be sure to watch the next Marshmallow!
