Nobue:
 Strawberry Marshmallow broadcast was about to begin…
 We were headed back to earth.
 The journey was peaceful… until that fateful moment.

Miu:
 Uwaa!

Nobue:
 Where did you come from?
 Spying again?

Miu:
 That’s not important.
 We’re in big trouble you guys.

Announcement:
 Emergency. Emergency.
 Oxygen levels are dropping rapidly.
 Please prepare emergency space suits.

Chika:
 What happened?

Miu:
 Who cares? All that matters is that we’re running out of oxygen and there won't be enough to last us till we get back to earth!

Nobue:
Hmm, it’s a serious matter, all right…


Ana:
Oh, it’s getting lower…

Nobue:
It’s not good. There’s not enough oxygen for all of us.

Chika,Ana,Matsuri:
No way!

Matsuri:
But I have to get home before dark, or my mom will get mad.

Ana:
Yeah. And I haven’t done my homework for tomorrow yet.

Miu:
Nobue, you have to think of something to save us.

Nobue:
There’s no other choice.
I’ll have to play my trump card.

Miu:
Well, don’t you stand there. Hurry up and show us what it is, you dummy old bag.

Chika,Ana,Matsuri:
Yay! We’re still alive!

Matsuri:
Huh, that was so scary.
My heart's pounding like crazy.

Ana:
You saved the day, Nobue!

Chika:
By the way, what was your big idea, anyway?

Nobue:
Well, we had enough oxygen for four people.

Chika:
Huh?

Matsuri:
Four?

Ana:
And…?


Chika:
Look, there is Miu!

Matsuri:
Huh?

Ana:
Oh, dear.

Matsuri:
I don’t see her.

Chika:
She’s that tiny little spec floating around.

Ana:
Oh, you’re right!

Matsuri:
Oh yeah, well!

Chika:
Sis, do you think Miu will get to earth safely?

 Nobue:
She’ll be fine.
Once she enters the atmosphere, it’s right there.

Chika:
You’re right, Sis.

Matsuri:
Huh? Look, look!

Chika,Ana,Matsuri:
Wow…

Ana,Matsuri:
It’s gorgeous!

Chika:
Wow, looks like we made it!

Nobue:
You need to be at least 30 meters away from the television while you're watching it, girls.
Time for our debut, yeah…
