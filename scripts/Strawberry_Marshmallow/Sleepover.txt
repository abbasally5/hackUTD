Um... English.

Chika:
I wonder what we're gonna do in PE class today.

Miu:
The vaulting horse?

Chika:
No, I don't think so, Miu.

Miu:
The horizontal bars maybe? I really hate both things.

Matsuri:
I'm afraid I'll fall on my head...

Ana:
Huh...

Miu:
What's wrong, Coppo...?

Matsuri:
You know what... Ana's tired of pretending that she can't speak Japanese.

Miu:
Then, she should just speak it.

Ana:
It wouldn't be so stressful if I could do that!

Matsuri:
It's a secret from everyone at school that Ana can speak Japanese.

Chika:
Oh, I get it. So we're the only ones who know you don't speak English well?

Matsuri:
Mm-hm...
 Because Ana can't speak English yet, we have to keep her secret until she can.

Miu:
Ana can't speak English.

Ana:
You know, you don't have to go repeating that over and over and over again!

Matsuri:
I'm sorry, but I thought it would be better if I explained it to everyone.

Chika:
Do they know about your last name?

Ana:
No...! If they knew, it would be awful...!

Miu:
Oh, really? Cop...

classmate:
I've been wondering...

Matsuri:
What?

classmate:
You and Ana both get along really well, don't ya?
 I always see you coming to school together.
 So, how do you two communicate?
 Well, she speaks English, right?

Matsuri:
Oh, A-Ana talks really slow for me.
 Sometimes I can understand what she's saying
 by looking in her eyes, that's helpful too... for me...
 Wow! You've got another one of those!
Another letter from a secret admirer!

Ana:
This is the third one! I'm so embarrassed!

Matsuri:
Open it! I'm dying to know what it says!

Ana:
No, now! Don't be impatient because I'm gonna read it first!
It's no good...

Matsuri:
...Huh? It says... "love!" Here and here, see?
A minute ago, someone asked me how I communicate with you.

Ana:
I know... I heard...

Matsuri:
I said I could understand you by looking in your eyes.

Ana:
So do you know what I'm thinking right now?

Matsuri:
You want to speak English?
 ...Am I right?


vault: 跳躍する(vaulting horse:跳び箱)

Matsuri:
In order for it to last longer, I securely braided the straw.

5-2 teacher:
Very good, Sakuragi.
 Okay, Ana, your turn.
 Let's read, just read whatever you can.

Ana:
With... pride...

5-2 teacher:
Good! ...And next... Sasazuka. Continue the sentence exactly where Ana left off.

Sasazuka:
Ah, excuse me. Can't I just read it normally?

5-2 teacher:
Go stand in the hallway.

Matsuri:
A huge boy is coming. He's walking over fields.
 He's coming over mountains and he's swimming through the sea.
 A huge girl is coming, too.
 She's climbing over buildings, climbing over bridges, and over mountains, too.

5-2 teacher:
That was good! You're a good singer, Sakuragi!
 Ana, you're next. Let's sing, just sing the parts you know.

Ana:
A huge...

5-2 teacher:
Very good.

Sasazuka:
Uh...

5-2 teacher:
Sasazuka, go stand in the hall.

5-2 teacher:
That's correct! Good work!

Ana:
Mm-hm.
 It sure helps that I don't have to talk in Math class.

5-2 teacher:
Sasazuka, go stand...

classmates:
That book sounds so interesting.
 Do you think I could borrow it?

Matsuri:
Okay. I'll bring it tomorrow.

classmates:
Cool! I'm looking forward to it!
 Getting back to what I was just saying, my older brother likes cos-play, and the other day...

Matsuri:
"Cos-play?"

classmates:
Yeah.

Matsuri:
Um, what's "cos-play?"
 ... Ana, what's wrong?

Ana:
It's the stuff you spray in your hair.
 ...Ha!

Ana:
All right! This is what we're gonna do!
 I'll whisper in your ear and then you'll simply tell everybody what I just said to you!
 That way, I'll be able to talk to anyone I want to!
 Oh, why didn't I think of this earlier!?

Matsuri:
Um, you're forgetting something important, Ana.
 Won't it look like I speak good English?

Ana:
That's exactly why you study English!

Matsuri:
Huh?


Miu:
A, B, C, D, E, F, G...

Chika:
Miu, I can't see, you're in the way.

Miu:
Huh?
 Come on, now!

Chika:
You're scheming again, aren't you...

Miu:
Scheming?
 H, I, J, K, L, M, N... Softball...

Chika:
Throw it!

Miu:
Don't get your knickers in a knot, Chika?
 They don't get any points until they cross home plate.

Chika:
You're supposed to be at third base.
 So what are you doing over here?

Miu:
Pinch-hitter, Matsuoka!
 Come on!

Classmate:
Go, Miu!

Chika:
Oh, no...

Umpire:
Play!

Miu:
Ta-dah!

Ana:
Oh, mistake! Japanese is hard!

Miu:
Whammo!

Ana:
That could've hurt us...

Matsuri:
Whoever hit that must be really strong...

Miu:
Excuse me, but the ball went in here.
 Oh, here it is.
 Huh...? Oh! Coppola! Hi there!
 Oh, yeah! This is fifth grade, class two!


Ana:
Aahh!

 Ouch!


Miu:
... Ha!
 Oh, no, not Coppola. I meant to say Ana, It's Ana!
 Right, Coppola?

Chika:
Miu!!!

Miu:
It's a nickname, Coppola is only a nickname!
 ...Oh, darn, it's no good as a nickname, either!

Nobue:
I see... So Miu's the culprit.
 Ana. Please put that down.
 Besides, you don't actually know if Miu did it on purpose or not, do you?

Ana:
...But I...

Nobue:
Oh, dear. I know she is a trouble maker, but she wouldn't hurt you on purpose.

Miu:
I do know the difference between what I should and shouldn't do, you know!

Nobue:
That's true... Yeah...

Matsuri:
"Gray..."


Chika:
Huh?

Nobue:
Tell the truth...!

Miu:
On purpose!

Ana:
Noooooooo!

Matsuri:
"Hammer."

Miu:

Nobue:

 ...Let me see...

Miu:
Come on, hurry up!

Nobue:
If I could take only one person to a deserted island...?

Nobue:
Let me see... I need leeks, Chinese cabbage, tofu,
 green onions, shiitake mushrooms... and pork.
 I think that's it.
 Huh?

Chika:
Big sis!
 Snacks!

Nobue:
O-Okay...
 Well, I did get money from mom and dad.
 You can all choose something you like.

Chika:
Really?!

Miu:
Yeah, yeah!

Chika:
Ana, Matsuri.


 Miu:
 Okay!

Nobue:
We're having a sleepover because mom and dad are away
 at a relative's memorial service.

Miu:
Big sis, big sis!
 I want this one, 'kay?

Ana:
Can I have this one here, please?

Nobue:
Mm-hm. Yeah, sure, anything.

Miu:
Hey! What about me?!

Nobue:
Just because...

Miu:
Why won't you let me...? You said whatever we like.

Nobue:
Isn't Petit-Cheese Pie... hard to say...?
 ...There're two "chi"s in a row, so it's tricky to say.
 "Petit-Cheese." There is too much "ee", see?

Miu:
So I can't have it?

Nobue:
That's right, A-cup.

Miu:
A-cup, huh?! You cheap!

 Petit-Cheese... Easy to say...

Nobue:
That's fine.

Miu:
Stop hanging onto Nobue like that!
Are you dating or something, flat... Huh?!

Nobue:
No, we're not dating. But this is the first time Ana's been to this store.
 And it wouldn't be good if she got lost. Right?
 ...Shall we go, Ana?
 Go earn your own money and buy yourself, A-cup.

Miu:
It's different! It's Rare Petit-Cheese Cake!
 You both have flat chests, too!

Nobue:
...Listen, I said no.
 ...Oh, you can get that.

 Ou...!
 Oh...! That hurt!

Ana:
It looks so good!

Matsuri:
Yeah, it does!
 It's kinda exciting, to have dinner with just us kids!

Chika:
Mom said dad got drunk and went to bed already.

Nobue:
Really?
 Well, let's dive in.

All:
Let's eat!

Miu:
Let's all eat.
 Thank you for the meal.

Nobue:
Hey...

Chika:
Here. These are your chopsticks, Ana.

Ana:
Oh, thank you.

Miu:
What would you like to eat, Nobue?

Nobue:
Don't worry, I'll get it myself.

Miu:
Eat whatever you like.

Nobue:
Do you really care about me this much, Miu?

Miu:
Sure I do.

Nobue:
Do you love me?

Miu:
I love you!

Nobue:
Really.
 ...Ah, are you okay, Matsuri?!
 Make sure you blow on it.
 There you go.

Chika:
I think I may have made it too spicy.
 Are you all right, Matsuri?

Matsuri:
I think I can handle this much.

Chika:
'Kay.

Miu:
Matsuri, Matsuri!
 Pig body.

Nobue:
Don't make it sound so gross.
 Matsuri, what's your favorite thing in the hot pot?

Matsuri:
Uh... um... I think... "shiitake mushroom."

Miu:
Matsuri, Matsuri?
 Wilted Chinese cabbage.

Nobue:
Don't pay any attention to her, Matsuri.

Miu:
Chewed up cabbage.

Everyone except Miu:
That was good!

Nobue:
All right.
 Does anyone want a bath?

Chika:
I'll have one later, thanks.

Nobue:
What about you, Ana?
 Seeing as it's your first sleepover, do you wanna take one together?

Ana:
Oh, okay.

Miu:
Hang on, sister!

 Please stop looking at me like that?
 Come on, for you guys?

Nobue:
Oh, sorry.

Miu:
What's the big deal, I mean you're wearing a bath towel?

Ana:
Yeah, but, I'm gonna wash my body now, so please look the other way?

Nobue:
Oh, right.
 Miu, look this way.
 I'll watch just make sure you don't miss anywhere.

Miu:
I'll only look at your boobies...

Ana:
No!

Nobue:
The bathroom's free!
 Oh...! Ana, your hair looks good straight.

Ana:
Oh, really?

Nobue:
Mm-hm.

Miu:
Hey! My hair is straight now, too!

Nobue:
Do you always do that when you get out of the bath?

Ana:
Ah, yes.

Nobue:
Hum... That looks cute, too.
 Huh...? It's always like that.

Miu:
I've had just about enough of this!
 Who's more important to you, me or Ana!

Nobue:
Have you been trying to compete with Ana?

Miu:
It doesn't matter!
 I won't let you go home until you tell me the truth!

Nobue:
Um, this is my house...?
 Let me see... I think Ana, eight to two.

Miu:
Why...? But why...?!

Nobue:
Oh... No...! For real?!

Miu:
You're jerk!

Nobue:
I'm sorry, Miu. Hey, you're number one.

Miu:
Ugly!

Nobue:
Sorry Ana, but would you tell Chika that Miu's gonna sleep in my bed tonight?

Ana:
Okay.


jerk: バカ



Miu:
Nobue, you always talk about Ana...

Nobue:
Hum... That's not true at all.

Miu:
Petit... Petit-Cheese...

Nobue:
Petit-Cheese Pie, huh?
 Okay. I'll buy it for you tomorrow. I'll buy you two.

Miu:
I don't want it...

Nobue:
You don't want it?

Miu:
I'm always on the bottom of the heap anyway...

Nobue:
Bottom? What do you mean?

Miu:
You always treat Ana like she's number one...
 It's always... always about Ana...

Nobue:
Like I said...

Miu:
And Matsuri, too...

Nobue:
So... She's been lonely, too.
 I should've guessed...

Nobue:
Already...
 ...Pillows?

Miu:
Good morning, Nobue!

Nobue:
That was quick!
 Everything about this is wrong...

Matsuri:
That was fun, wasn't it?!

Ana:
Yes! And the corn this morning was so yummy!

Miu:
It got stuck right here in my teeth!

Ana:
Me, too!

Matsuri:
And that orange thing was so delicious!
 What was it?

Nobue:
Loquat!
 Summer's almost here!

Chika:
If you don't hurry, you'll be late!

Nobue:
Uh-huh?

Ana:
Thanks for having us!

Nobue:
See ya!

Matsuri:
See you!

Miu:
Hey, where's my shoe?

Nobue:
It's there, by the umbrellas.

Miu:
Oh!
 'Kay, I'm off!

Nobue:
Well then, away with you!
 ...Sleepy.
 I think I'll go back to bed...

Miu:
It's summer time!
 It's so hot in the summer that you don't feel like doing anything...

Chika:
You're such a baby, Miu.

Miu:
Then, take this!
 I'll open the window!

Chika:
Stop it!
 The cool air from the air conditioner will escape.

Miu:
Ha! See?
 You're a weak modern-day kid just like me.

Chika:
If you're loud, you'll just get hotter.
 Now stay in the room and be quiet.

Miu:
I guess you're right.
 It is summer after all...

Be sure to watch the next Marshmallow!
