Nobue:
Guess I have some time to kill...

(27:47)
TV:
Everyone please relax...
 Yes, your eyelids are starting to feel heavy...

Chika:
Do you think this is real?
 Seems kinda phony to me.

Miu:
Hmm... Hey, I know, why don't we give it a try?

Chika:
Uh, I don't think so...

Miu:
I wanna be hypnotized!

Chika:
You wanna be hypnotized?

Miu:
Why not?
 It could be fun 'cause all sorts of things happen like you get sleepy, or you wanna play, or you just say funny things that pop into your head!
 Who wouldn't wanna try that!?

Chika:
But you're already like that anyway, Miu.
 I'm gonna start...

Miu:
I'm ready!

Chika:
You're feeling very sleepy... Sleepy... Very sleepy...

Miu:
Eek!!!

Chika:
Um, Miu... I didn't say to curl up like a prawn.

Miu:
Huh? Oh, yeah.
 But you know my stomach does feel like it's attached to my back!

Chika:
Uh, yeah, that's just because you're hungry.

Miu:
You think so?
 Okay, now I'll do it to you, Chika?

Chika:
Huh!? Why me!?

Miu:
Just watch! I'm gonna turn Chika into Satake!

Chika:
Miu, wait a sec...!
 Um... huh! I need to go to the bathroom.

Miu:
Hey, don't run away!

Ana:
...Was that ever close.

Matsuri:
It sure was...


Matsuri, Ana:
Huh?


Miu:
Ta-dah!

Matsuri:
Um... Is that Chika?

Satake:
Woof!

Matsuri:
Oh! It really is! Miu, you're amazing!

Chika:
Um, hello Matsuri...?

Matsuri:
Huh?!

Miu:
I am really worried about your future.

Chika:
And I'm more worried about yours...

(30:00)
Nobue:
Excuse me, how many specials do you have left?

TV:
It's a purple sweet potato Mont Blanc...

Miu:
That looks great!
 I'd love some cake! ...Hey?

Ana:
Uh, oh.

Miu:
Don't you want some?

Chika:
Sure I do. But I don't have any money.

Miu:
Your allowance?

Chika:
I said I'm broke.

Miu:
Chika, hold out your hand.

Chika:
What am I supposed to do with this?

Miu:
Um, let's see...

Chika:
You have no idea, do you, Miu?

Miu:
I know, hypnosis time!

Chika:
It's not gonna work.

Matsuri:
Huh? Who me? No, John?

Miu:
You want to go and buy some cake...!
Good! Now go straight to the cake shop!
...Alright!
Then, Chika is going to buy some...

Chika:
You mean Satake?

Miu:
There're two Chikas!

Chika:
No there aren't...
 Wait a minute, are you calling me a puppy!?

Miu:
I'll try it on this Chika.
 Now you will begin to submit to the power of the hypnotist...!

Chika:
Like I said, it doesn't work.

Miu:
Ugh... Why isn't it working on anyone? It should work on at least one of you?

Ana:
But we can't help it if it doesn't.

Matsuri:
Mm-mh....

Miu:
Sigh...

Matsuri:
A-and, maybe it's true that it didn't quite work on any of us right now,
 but I'm sure there must be someone out there the hypnosis does work on!
 At least I think so... maybe...?
 Hmm...

Miu:
Somebody out there, you want to eat cake!!!

(32:06)
Nobue:
Hi, Chika. Where are you? At home? And everyone else?
 ...Really. That's perfect.
 Who, me? Oh, I'm on a bench, by the lake.
 Come on down, and bring all girls.

Chika:
Why? But that's so far! Why do we have to go there?

Nobue:
Never mind the whining, Chika. Just don't forget, "Bring everyone."

Chika:
Ugh, she's so pushy.
 Okay, Ana and Matsuri, you're both gonna go by bus.
 And Miu and I will take our bicycles.
 We'll meet the two of you at the bus stop, all right?

Miu:
Huh? But I'd rather take the bus!

Chika:
You feel a strong urge to ride your bicycle...

Miu:
Are you okay, Chika? You know hypnosis doesn't work, right?

Ana:
See you there!

Chika:
Huh? Oh... My bike has a flat!

Miu:
Oh, no... What'll you do?

Chika:
What is my sister thinking anyway?
 I mean she definitely isn't considerating what other people wanna do.
Hey, Miu! Wait!

Miu:
Yay! He he, I'm the winner!

Chika:
What's the point of racing with someone who doesn't even know it...!?

Miu:
You know, you need to have a bit more pride, little missy!
That looks so easy...

Chika:
Stop running off like that, we should be going together...
 Huh? Miu?

Miu:
Yu-hoo!

Chika:
...You have no pride.

Miu:
First place! Losers!

Ana & Matsuri:
Huh?

Miu:
You have to work harder!

Chika:
Hey...!

Ana:
Gee, are you alright, Chika?

Chika:
I'll be okay...

Miu:
Let's play the penalty game.

Chika:
How come?!

Miu:
It's pretty obvious that you're the last one.

Matsuri:
Excuse me, Miu. Can you give me back the money I just loaned you?

Miu:
Huh? I don't have it.

Matsuri:
But... what will I do now...?

Miu:
You can ask Chika for some!

Chika:
Huh?! What was that?! Miu!
 I'll get it for you later. Go on ahead!
 Miu! Wait!

Miu:
As if!!!

Nobue:
They sure are taking their time... What're they doing?

(35:39)
Ana:
We keep heading north, which is this way, right?

Matsuri:
Mm-hm.
Hang on... "Nishi" is west right? And "higashi" is east...
 So what's "kita" ?

Ana:
It's "nows", like the opposite of "snow"!
 You can remember it because it's cold in the north.

Matsuri:
Oh, I see!
 ...Wait a minute, Ana, isn't the opposite of "snow" "hot"?

Ana:
Huh? Well, the word for "snow" is "yuki", and the opposite of cold snow... is, um...
 wait... now that you mention it, Matsuri...
 Oh... that's weird! It doesn't make any sense at all!
 The opposite of "south" is "susa" so...

Matsuri:
Hey, which way is north from here?

Ana:
Huh?

Matsuri:
Do you know where north is?

Ana:
Um...

Matsuri:
Hm... Oh, but I thought that you knew the way, Ana...

Ana:
No I don't. I thought it was you who knew the way...!

Matsuri & Ana:
Oh...

Matsuri:
Oh, no. A-Ana, then which path do you think we should take now...?
 Uh... Huh???

Chika:
Come off it, Miu. Let me have a turn...!

Miu:
Huh? It's just a little further!

Chika:
It's not fair! I'm the one who's been running the whole time...!

Miu:
I suppose that's true.

Chika:
Come on, give me a break!
 Besides, you have more energy than me anyway...!

Miu:
My point, exactly, you need more training, so you'd better keep running!

Nobue:
Huh! For goodness sake, where are they?! Hm...

Matsuri:
Huh... I'm so tired...

Ana:
It's just a little further, you can do it.

Matsuri:
Oh, all right... Just lemme rest a little more...

Ana:
Well, okay then.

Matsuri:
Huh? Oh, John!

Ana:
Wait for me, Matsuri!

Matsuri:
John! No!

Ana:
That's why I said you have to hold on to it tighly!

Matsuri:
Oh, John...!

Nobue:
Huh, that's weird. Why isn't she answering her cell?

Matsuri:
John! Stop! Please wait for me! Huh?
 Excuse me, sir, I wonder if you can help it, please grab him!

Nobue:
Let's see... What about Chika and Miu...?

Chika:
Am I ever hot and sticky and exhausted...

Miu:
Considering it's you, you did pretty well!

Chika:
Listen here...!

Miu:
So, what do you say we give it a try again?

Chika:
I'm thirsty. Can I go buy some juice?

Miu:
I don't have any money, you know?

Chika:
Yeah, and now.

Miu:
Then it'll be fine.

Chika:
This time it's your turn to run, okay? I'm done.

Miu:
Gosh, you're weak, Chika.

Chika:
That's not the point!

Nobue:
What's up? Chika is not answering... That's really strange...

Chika:
After I have a drink, we're gonna switch, 'kay?

Miu:
Fine, fine.
 If you wanted to ride the scooter so badly, you should've just said so...

Chika:
Is that right...
 ...Hmm, which one do I want...? Something refreshing, I think! Yeah.
Why did you do that for?!

Matsuri:
Thank you, sir... What a relief. Phew!

An English man:
Oh, you're welcome! So cute!

Matsuri:
Ah, it's a foreigner! Ana, help!

Ana:
Uh, what? But I don't want...!

An English man:
You're not Japanese! Could you tell me the way to the Johoku Library?

Ana:
Um, um... No, no, I cannot speak English!

An English man:
Oh, my god!

Matsuri:
Just hung on, Ana. I think what he said is that he wants to go to the library.

Ana:
Huh? You understood him?

Matsuri:
Mm-hm, I did.

Ana:
But how?

Matsuri:
Because I've been studying with you, Ana. Well, haven't I?

Ana:
Oh, so you have...!

Matsuri:
Hey, I know where the library is, we can take him there!
 Because he did catch John for me, I need to show my thanks!

Ana:
Are you sure...? Well, if you really think so... then that's fine with me.

Matsuri:
I think it's that way, over there! Maybe...

An English man:
Thank you very much!

Ana:
Oh, brother... I'm pitiful...

Nobue:
What on earth is taking them all so long?!
 Oh, forget it. I'm going home...!

Matsuri:
Hello?

Nobue:
Matsuri? Where the heck have you been?
 I've been looking all over the park for you girls.

Matsuri:
Well...

Nobue:
Huh? You're helping a foreigner, why?

Matsuri:
It's kind of a long story... You see...

Nobue:
Okay. You're taking him to the library because he helped you catch John who escaped.
 Oh, yep. I see. Okay then...
 So should I meet you there? Stay put and I'll come and get you.
 Seriously, don't move an inch! ...Okay.
 Well, now I know about Matsuri and Ana... But where are Miu and Chika?
 Are those two still wandering around?
 ...Hello?

Miu:
Yes, yes, Nobue, this is Miu!

Nobue:
What are the both of you up to and how long are you gonna make me wait for...?

Miu:
We're riding a swan right now! A swan!
 Oh! I see a couple! Chika, begin pursuit.

Chika:
Come on, let's stop this.

Nobue:
Hey Miu...!

Chika:
I'm sorry!

Miu:
You should come too, Nobue! It's so much fun!
 Chika and I are out on the lake around the...

Miu:

Chika:
You just get so carried away sometimes.

Miu:
Come on, Chika! You had fun and you know it.

Ana:
I'm glad we all got here safely.

Matsuri:
Yes, me too!

Chika:
So, why did you call us all here out of the blue, big sis?

Nobue:
...What was it?
 Oh, I wanted to buy you cake.

All girls:
Huh?!

Miu:
It was 'cause of the power of the coin!

Nobue:
Yep, I wanted to... but not now.


 All girls:


Chika:
Big sis...?

Nobue:
I'm leaving.


 All girls:


Miu:
But Nobue, we played the penalty game,
 and chased people, and rode on the swan boat!

Nobue:
I don't care.

Matsuri & Ana:
Hmm...

Chika & Miu
Huh... Hm!

All girls:
...Nobue!

Nobue:
...What?

 Huh...

All girls:
Thank you!

Storekeeper/Waitress:
You're very welcome.


 Miu:
Ahahaha...

Chika:
That was so good!

Ana:
Yes, I wonder what that delicious filling was made of.

Matsuri:
Persimmon, I think.

Ana:
Oh, I guess it's in season right now...

Matsuri:
Yes...

Nobue:
Huh... Well, so much for being spontaneous, I guess.

Chika:
Big sis!


 Nobue:
Huh?

Ana:
Thank you so much!

Matsuri:
Yes, it sure was delicious!

Nobue:
Mm-hm.

Chika:
You did a good job of finding this little place!


 Nobue:
 Huh...

Miu:
Well, let's go home!

Ana:
Okay.


 Nobue:


Ana:
I was so scared when John ran away from us like that...

Matsuri:
Me too!

Ana:
Yes, we were really lucky that man was so nice!

Chika:
Hey, Miu! If you're not gonna ride the scooter any more, give it back to me.

Miu:
No, I'm using it!

Chika:
Oh no, you're not!

Miu:
Yeah, well, I'm gonna use it now.


 Chika:
 Huh?

Matsuri:
Come, look!

Ana:
What is it?

Matsuri:
Just look! There is a flower in bloom!

Chika:
Oh wow! It really is!

Ana:
It's so cute!

Miu:
I didn't know flowers grew in a place like this.

Chika:
Of course, they do.

Miu:
But it must be tough! I mean with all these weeds around...
 Good for you, little flower!

Matsuri:
I wonder what kind of flower it is.

Chika:
Let's look it up when we get home, okay?

Matsuri:
Mm-hm.

Nobue:
Everything is so simple for you girls...


All grils:
 Hum?

Chika:
You don't really get this sort of thing, do you, sis?

Nobue:
Come on, let's go home.

all girls:
Okay!

Chika:
 Something's wrong with the hot water tank.

Nobue:
What?
Then let's go to the public bath.
Come on everyone. Let's go.

Miu:
 Yeah!

Nobue:
Miu, what are you doing with all those toys?
We're not going to the pool, you know.

Chika:
 Oh, Masturi, you changed the strap on your cell phone.

Ana:
 What a cute snowman!

Masturi:
 Hahaha.
 Well, Santa's coming soon...


Be sure to watch the next Marshmallow!
