  Miu:
It's so hot...

Chika:
Even this heat is too much.
 It's just wrong.

Matsuri:
On TV this morning, they said, "It's the hottest day of this summer".

Miu:
It's even hot enough to melt Ana.

Ana:
I am not melting.

Miu:
Tell us what it feels like to melt, Ana.

Ana:
I said, "I'm not melting."

Miu:
Hey!
 Wanna play *rock-paper-scissors?
The loser carries the bags.

Matsuri:
No!
 *I'm terrible at that game.

Miu:
Let's do this *two at a time!
 It's a *fierce midsummer playoff!

Matsuri:
B... But...

Chika:
You only have to win one out of two tries.
 Don't worry, Matsuri.
 I'll *take her on first.

Matsuri:
Ah... OK...

Chika & Miu:
Rock-paper-scissors!

Ana:
Okay, are you ready?

Matsuri:
Uh, yes.

Ana & Matsuri:
...One-more-time, rock-paper-scissors!

Miu:
So, who lost?

Ana:
Matsuri did.

Miu:
*What do you know! I lost too.
 OK! Rock-paper-scissors!
I can't believe how mean you guys are!
 I feel light as a feather.

Chika:
You don't have to carry mine.

Ana:
Chika's right.
 I'll carry mine too.

Miu:
Hey hey hey, hang on a sec.
 What do you think you're doing?
 We have to *stick to the big master plan, you guys?
 Otherwise, what did we play rock-paper-scissors for?
 See, by letting someone else carry your bag, you *get a little taste of the easy life.
 Uum, excuse me.
 I think you're all being unfair.
 Uhh, melting...

Chika:
...It's so cool.

Nobue:
Yeah, air-conditioning is awesome.
 Almost as awesome as beer, 13 Tokyo-Dome-sized glasses of beer.

Chika:
I can't even imagine having to live my life without the joy of an air-conditioner.

Miu:
I wonder how the dinosaurs were able to live!?

Nobue:
...Huh?

Chika:
Huh!?
...Air-conditioning is the best invention ever!

Nobue:
Totally.

Miu:
Stop slacking off!

Chika:
Hey! What are you doing, Miu!?
Stop it! It's too hot!

Miu:
Welcome to the desert!

Chika:
...What?

Nobue:
Hey!

Miu:
A drop of water equals a drop of blood!

Nobue:
One drop of liquor is equal to one drop of blood.

Miu:
Water...!

Chika:
Cut it out, Miu.
 If you need a drink, you can just say so, okay?

Miu:
You can't drink that 'cuz there's poison in it!
 Chop.
I-I need water...!

Chika:
Well, you're the one who spilled it!

Miu:
Why can't you play along?

Chika:
Huh? ...Oh!

Miu:
There is an oasis! I can see an oasis!
 ...We have been on a long 40-day journey.
 We've come through a sandstorm, we've lost our camels and water.
 And worst of all, we haven't been able to watch our favorite TV shows...!

Chika:
Oh, that's really terrible, Miu.

Miu:
Our friends have been kicking the bucket one by one...
And, Ana finally melted.
 After all that, we can finally see an oasis!

Chika:
Oh, yeah. So, where is it, boss?

Miu:
Over there!

Chika:
Yeah, I see it now. Just a little further. Come on, we can do it.
 Hm, hm?

Miu:
Don't worry about me... You go on...

Chika:
Um... Nope.
 No way. I can't do that, Miu.

Miu:
Leave the rest to me, Chika.
 The real enemy is right over there.

Chika:
You mean in the oasis?

Miu:
I'm afraid it's your real father!

Chika:
So what?

Miu:
Why won't you play along?

Chika:
You just changed the plot in the middle of the story!

Rock, paper, scissors!

Miu:
...What is that?

Chika:
Flypaper.

Nobue:
Chika wins.

Miu:
Hello, noodle restaurant? I'd like to place an order.

Chika:
Noodle restaurant?

Miu:
One ice-cream, please.

Chika:
You're only ordering for yourself?

Noodle restaurant clerk:
Don't fool around!

Miu:
He got mad.

Chika:
Of course he did.

Miu:
Well, I'll call the police then.

Nobue:
You better not go too far with those pranks of yours.

Miu:
You could have it back.

Nobue:
You mean you're using my cell phone?!


fool around: いじくる、ふざける
prank(s): いたずら



Matsuri:
I'm so thirsty...

Ana:
...Gi-n-ge-ru...? Gingeru... Gingaeru.
 Milky Way, silver frog. That's a bit of a strange name for a soda pop.

Man:
G-I-N-G-E-R A-L-E... Ginger ale, that's how you read it...
 Thanks for the other day.
 That family restaurant was my favorite place to relax...

Ana:
Ah... I don't know what you're talking about!
 You're mistaken!


Matsuri:
Ana!
 You're sure energetic in this heat!

Ana:
The man from the restaurant was there, but he mistook me for someone else,
 an-and it's supposed to be ginger ale not milky way frog, right!?


Milky Way: 銀河



clerk of Ichigomart:
...Two Hiyahiya-kun, and three pints of Mild Dazs. That'll be 1,176 yen.

Nobue:
Can I have a receipt?

Clerk of Ichigomart:
Your name, please?

Nobue:
Write Matsuoka Miu.
 Where is my cell phone...?
 Guess I must've forgotten it...


Miu:
To all the weak kids of today.
 Do you find your throat dry and damaged from over-using your air-conditioner?
 Let us now begin our throat examinations.
Ohhh, I'm so very flushed!
Say it.

Chika:
Huh. Why?

Miu:
What an attitude! You should have some sympathy for the air-conditioner.
 Say it! Do it!

Chika:
...Oh, I'm so very flushed.

Miu:
Your turn, Matsuri.

Matsuri:
Um... Oh, I'm so very flushed!

Miu:
Okay, Ana, you're next... In English.

Ana:
Why me!? Why me!?


pint: １パイント(約0.5リットル)、１パイント容器（どう見てもそんなに大きなアイスではないので、翻訳ミスかも）
flushed: 顔を赤らめる、体が火照る




Nobue:
Yo!

Ana:
...Oh, Nobue.

Nobue:
It's okay.

Miu:
Oh, big sis. You're back.
 Where is the ice cream?

Nobue:
It's in the freezer.
 Do you want some now?

Miu:
Later...

Nobue:
Of course. I mean, you're all ready for bed, anyway.
Ice cream?

Miu:
Toilet...
 ...No, I'll go later.

Nobue:
You shouldn't wait, you know.
 Come on, now, Miu.
 Close the door!
 Goodness sake!
...Just go!

Miu:
No, it's too hot!
 I'll fry! I'll boil! I'll burn!

Nobue:
Don't say I didn't warn ya.

Miu:
It was hot... AHHHH!
 Hey, stupid! Stupid!

Chika:
Hey! What are you doing!?

Miu:
That's where I'm sleeping!

Chika:
Stop hitting me!

Miu:
You're stupid!

Chika:
This is my room, you know!

Miu:
You're dimwit!

Chika:
What did you say!?

Matsuri:
...I'll leave my glasses here.

Miu:
I was sleeping there first!

Chika:
That doesn't matter!

Miu:
Shut up! Shut up!

Chika:
No, you shut up!

Chika & Miu:
Huh!? Get out!

Miu:
Move!

Chika:
No! You move!

Miu:
What do you think you're doing!?

(for) goodness sake: for God's sakeの婉曲表現
dimwit: バカ




Chika:
What are you doing?

Miu:
Shhhhh!
 We can't wake up Nobue...!

Matsuri:
The hallway is incredibly hot.

Ana:
Really?

Matsuri:
Satake is panting hard.

Ana:
That's because dogs only sweat from their tongues.

Matsuri:
His tongue was hanging out of his mouth!

Miu:
Shhhh!


pant: 荒い息をする、ドキドキする




Miu:
Okay. Ready.
 I'm beginning the ear examination.

Chika's voice from cell phone:
Oh, I'm so very flushed.

Miu:
Can you hear me?

Miu's voice form cell phone:
 Ohhh, I'm so very flushed!

Nobue:
Achoo... Hm... Um... What are you doing?

Miu:
An ear examination!




Ana:
This is really delicious, isn't it?

Matsuri:
Ice cream is so good in the summer!

Miu:
I can't imagine life without ice cream.

Chika:
Uh-huh.
 I wonder how the dinosaurs managed to exist without ice cream.

Miu:
Chika, are you okay?
 You know, ice cream wasn't around way back then.

Chika:
Hm!

Nobue:
Achoo!

Chika:
Do you have a cold, big sis?

Nobue:
Uh-hm. Maybe 'cuz I let the air-conditioner on while I was asleep...

Chika:
Yeah, I guess, maybe, we should've set the temperature a bit higher.

Miu:
Like 180 degrees?

Nobue:
We're not baking a cake.

Chika:
Ice cream is yummy, and so is cake!
 Jelly too!

Matsuri:
I like jelly!

Ana:
I like tokoroten!

Nobue:
It's good with molasses.

Miu:
Oh, speaking of tokoroten... I'm really cute, aren't I?

Nobue:
Don't just randomly say things... No one understands!

Miu:
Hey! Take a real good look at me!

Nobue:
Cough, cough!

Miu:
Don't get all choked off!

Nobue:
It must be a cold...

Miu:
If you have no guilt in your heart, then look your father straight in the eye!

Nobue:
What exactly are you trying to do!?

Miu:
Nothing...


molasses: 糖蜜



Miu:
All right! Let's play shadow-tag on the way home.
 If you step in the light, you have to carry the bags.

Chika:
(Are) you serious?

Miu:
Very serious! Come on, let's go!

Miu:
A challenge!

Miu:
This isn't fair...
 That's it. I'm telling...

Miu's voice form cell phone:
 ...very flushed...!
 Ohhh, I'm so very flushed...!
 Ohhh, I'm so very flushed...!
 Ohhh, I'm so very flushed...!
 Ohhh, I'm so very flushed...!
 Ohhh...



shadow-tag: 影踏み（なお、shadow-tagでgoogle検索すると「陰踏み鬼」はでてくるが、ここでの「陰踏み」は出てこない。tag: 鬼ごっこ(Longmanの２)）




Chika:
 It's finally summer holiday.
 Big sis, I wanna go somewhere!

Nobue:
OK. Why don't we go to the beach?

Chika:
 Really?

Miu:
 Yeah! The beach!

Chika:
 What are you doing with that video camera, Miu?

Miu:
 Independent reserch.

Chika:
 Of what?
 Hey! That's me!

Miu:
 Isn't it shocking?
 I have one of Nobue, too.

Nobue:
Uh... ah...
 I should bury her in the sand.

Everyone:
 Be sure to watch the next Marshmallow!
