Matsuri:
Look at Richard and James!
 They're getting so big!

Chika:
Really?

Matsuri:
Roasted sweet potatoes?

Nobue:
I keep saying it's too early.

Chika:
Yeah, there aren't nearly enough leaves yet.

Miu:
Huh... That's not nearly enough.
 Huh?
 Chika, give me a saw.

Chika:
Forget it, Miu.

Nobue:
We'll buy some.

Chika:
Mm-hm.

Nobue:
Come on, Matsuri. Let's go.

Matsuri:
O-okay...

Chika:
Oh, they smell so good!
 Which one do you want, sis?

Nobue:
Huh, that one I think.

Chika:
Then I'll have this big one.
 What about you, Matsuri?

Matsuri:
Uh, well... Um, I think I'll have that medium sized...




(2:48)

Nobue:
Let's eat!

Matsuri:
Mm-hm.

Miu:
How can you have fun eating those loser potatoes?

Chika:
Then I guess, you won't be wanting any.
 Well, let's eat!

Miu:
That potato is huge!

Chika:
We each picked the one we want a second ago.
 So, this one is yours.

Miu:
Hey there, Chubby.

Chika:
Delicious!

Miu:
Hey, Chubby.

Chika:
...Huh? Are you talking to me?

Miu:
Have you gained a little weight lately?

Chika:
 Say whatever you want to, you're not getting this.

Miu:
I'm completely serious, Chika.

 See?
Chika:
Knock it off!

Miu:
Do you see, Chubby!

Chika:
I wish you'd stop saying that, Miu!?

Nobue:
Hey, Matsuri. Careful not to burn your tongue.

Matsuri:
Mm-hm.

Nobue:
...You know, I'm spoiled from all of Chika's great baking.
 This isn't as good.

Matsuri:
Yes! Chika is the best baker around!

Nobue:
Chika, why don't you go make something for us?

Chika:
Huh? Sure, okay.

Nobue:
Oh, I want some of those...

Chika:
Chocolate cookies, right? I know you like them.

Matsuri:
I like them, too!

Chika:
I'll be back in a flash, you guys.

Miu:
Hang on, Chika, I'll help.

Chika:
No thanks. I'll be fine on my own.

chubby: まるまると太った、ぽっちゃりした
flash: 瞬間、一瞥、速報（in a flash: すぐに）




(4:17)

Chika:
It can't be true...
 Whoa!? No way...!
 Whoooooa!!!

 No! That can't be...!
 Oh, I know what it is! The scale must be wrong...!

Miu:
Nope.

Chika:
When'd you get here!?

Miu:
Well, "Whoooooa!!!" after that.

Chika:
But, I told you not to come!

Miu:
Well, how much weight have you gained?

Chika:
None! I was just making sure.
 I came to check because of what you said to me earlier. That's all.

Miu:
Why the "Whoooooa!!!", huh?
 Oh...

Chika:
Could I have put on that much weight?
 Maybe I really am getting chubby...
Huh?
Oh, I had this on me. That's why!
 Did that ever scare me.

Miu:
Are they ready yet?

Chika:
Huh... Almost...

Miu:
 La la la la...
Come on and tell me. How much do you weigh?

Chika:
Look, I haven't gained weight, okay?

Miu:
Hm... Huh?
 ...There's a kilogram of flour here.
 Huh? Huh-huh... And this scale, right here, can weigh up to 2 kilograms.
 Hm... This weighs 10 kilos...

Chika:
Sigh...

Miu:
No way, Chika! 10 kilos!?

Chika:
No, Miu! Of course not!
 If you're gonna be here, then help me.

Miu:
Yes, sir!

Chika:
You can draw whatever you want.

Miu:
Then I'll write "dog"!
All right!

Chika:
Let's see?

Miu:
Oh, I was really trying to write "dog".

put on: 太る



(6:50)
Nobue:
Boy, you sure are a slow eater, aren't you, Matsuri?

Matsuri:
Yeah, I'm always the last to finish lunch at school.

Nobue:
Hello?

Ana:
Huh? Nobue?

Nobue:
Oh, Ana. Sorry, Matsuri is... drinking tea and just catching her breath.

Chika:
Huh! Yeah, that's about right.

Miu:
Do you think this tastes funny?

Chika:
Huh?
 Tastes like it always does.

Miu:
Are you sure? Here, give this one a try.
 And this one.
That was the beginning of Chika's weight gain hell...

Chika:
Shut up, Miu.
 And stop being so stupid.

Miu:
Yeah, but you usually eat this much.
 You know, when you doing taste-test.

Chika:
I hadn't even noticed...!

Nobue:
Tasting? You do it all the time.
That's why mom's always teasing you about sampling your wares.

Chika:
Really...?

Miu:
Hey! I said wait till I got back from the bathroom!

Nobue:
You don't have to shout about it, you know.
 There's plenty.
Take this one.

Miu:
This one is poisonous.

Nobue:
Then don't eat it.

Matsuri:
Um, aren't you gonna eat any, Chika?

Chika:
No. I'm fine, thanks. I don't want any right now.

Nobue:
I'll bet you just tested too many. That's all.

Chika:
I certainly did not.

Miu:
I worked hard making these.

Chika:
I'm the one that made them!

Miu:
Chika's gained weight lately, you know.
 She'll make a great Sumo wrestler.

Chika:
No, I have not!

Miu:
"Thank you for the meal!"



(8:57)
Ana:
We got so much, I thought I'd share.

Nobue:
1, 2, 3... There's exactly 5.
 Do we really get a whole pastry each?

Ana:
Yes. I can't eat them all by myself.

Miu:
I want this one here!

Nobue:
Chi, I can see the one that you'd like.

Miu:
...Hey, aren't you gonna eat it?

Chika:
Ah, no...

Miu:
Then I'll have it! Yeah!

Nobue:
Huh? Are you sure?

Chika:
Yes. I really don't feel like eating anything at all right now.

Miu:
Let's eat!
 Delicious!
This one's even better!
 Oh, I'm sorry, want a bit of this?
 ...Cold sweet potato.
Make sure you win the next Sumo wrestling tournament, Chubby Chika.

Chika:
Just go home!

Matsuri:
Bye for now, James.

Ana:
But isn't that one Richard?

Matsuri:
Huh? Oh, is it really?

Nobue:
I'm back.
 I can walk the two of you home now.
 Let's go, Satake.

Matsuri & Ana:
Thanks for having us.

Chika:
Bye. See you later.

Chika:
There's nothing in my pockets this time...
 And, didn't eat any more cookies or cake...
...That can't be...!

pastry: ペストリー（小麦粉を練った菓子）



Chika:
I'm done.

Chika's mom:
Oh my, you left so much of your food again.

Chika:
Well, I'm a kid, so I guess that I should divide the calories in half or something...
 Huh? HUH...?!

Nobue:
Hello.
 Chi, listen. Do you happen to have that CD I lent you?

Chika:
Oh, uh... I thought I gave it back to you.
 Hung on a second... Now, where did I put it...?

Nobue:
Hmm...
 What a beautiful day this is.
 It's been a while since we all played outside.

Chika:
Huh?

Nobue:
I think our bodies might need some exercise.

Chika:
Oh, yeah. What a good idea, sis.

Nobue:
Let's call everyone and say we'll meet them at the park.

Chika:
Okay.

Nobue:
...If she moves around a bit, she'll feel better.

Do you happen to ～ ?: もしかして～してない？



Nobue:
Looks like we're all here.

Matsuri:
I don't like to exercise.

Nobue:
Oh, don't worry about it.
 I called you so the teams would be even, that's all.

Matsuri:
Oh... I see...

Nobue:
Well, why don't we play baseball?
 Chika, mind being pitcher?


Chika:
Uh-oh.

Ana:
But I don't really know all the rules, Nobue.

Miu:
It's no sweat, Ana.
 This ball is called a "strike", hit a "homerun", and you'll be "out".

Nobue:
It sounds like you know the words, but not the rules...

Miu:
Okay, I'll be the umpire.


Nobue:
Huh...


Miu:
Play ball!

Nobue:
It's not good that you say things you don't understand with such confidence.

Ana:
So, what do I do, Nobue?


Nobue:
Well, you two go over there and if the ball comes to your way then you catch it.

Okay, let's begin!
Don't forget that you're the catcher, too.

Miu:
I won't.
 Hey, Chika!

Chika:
Huh?

We didn't talk about hand signals before the game...
 I'll ignore her.

Here goes!


Chika:
Sis, you took my comic book, didn't you?

Nobue:
Oh, did I?

Chika:
Everyone is laughing at me! I wonder why?!


Nobue:
You're too sensitive.

Chika:
How do you read this kanji, sis?

Nobue:
"Batistuta". That's how it's pronounced. So don't forget it, Chika.


Nobue:
Ou...!

Chika:
Oops...

Nobue:
Why you little...!?

Chika:
I'm sorry I just remembered so many things.

Nobue:
Huh? Remember things...?

Miu:
Strike!

Nobue:
Huh?! But why!?

Miu:
Because it was in!

Nobue:
No, it wasn't!

Miu:
Then "ball"!

Nobue:
It's not a "ball", either!

Miu:
Talk back to the umpire and you're out of the game, Missy!

Matsuri:
The ball never comes this way.

Ana:
This is boring...

Nobue:
Heads up!

Matsuri & Ana:
Huh?

Ana:
Just... just catch it, 'kay?

Matsuri:
No, no I can't!

Ana:
Um, it's... it's this way...? No, that way...?

Matsuri:
Um... um, watch out!

Nobue:
I guess I'll take two bases.

Chika:
Really?




Nobue:
I think we'd be better off playing soccer today than baseball.

Ana:
I can play soccer a little bit.

Miu:
I'll be the referee! Tweet! You're out!

Nobue:
No, I haven't done anything yet.

Chika:
But how are we gonna divide into teams?
 Because the team that you're on will be way stronger, sis?

Nobue:
You're right... So then, it'll be me against all of you, and I'll win.

Miu:
What!? Really!?

Nobue:
But there'll be no rough play, okay?

Miu:
Okay!

Nobue:
All right! Let's begin! Tweet!

Chika:
Ana?

Ana:
Alright!

Nobue:
So, it's Ana, huh?

Ana:
Here I go!

Chika:
Huh, you're good, sis!

Nobue:
Come and get it!

Miu:
That's not the way to do it, Ana! You gotta do this!

Ana:
Huh? ...EEK!

Chika:
It's all mine!

Nobue:
Hey!

Chika:
Ana!?

Ana:
Uh, Yes!

Nobue:
Hey, wait!

Chika:
No way!

Ana:
Pass that!

Nobue:
Too easy!

Miu:
I won't let you!

Nobue:
OU...!

Miu:
Chika, do it now!

Chika:
O-oh!
 There!
 It's a goal!

Ana:
Watch out, Matsuri!

Matsuri:
Huh? Oh!

Miu:
Way to go! Nice try!

Chika:
Miu's a sports announcer.

Nobue:
Miu!!! You!

Miu:
I didn't do it on purpose! I couldn't help myself!

Nobue:
You did to do it on purpose!

Miu:
Let's play dodge ball next! I'll be the referee!

Nobue:
No! You're out!

[be] better off ～: ～したほうが(より)良くなる
way: [副]かなり、はるかに
way to go: やったぞ！ よくやった！




Chika:
I'm done.

Chika's mom:
Huh? Already? You hardly ate anything again.

Chika:
I just had a snuck, I'll finish it later.

Nobue:
That girl...

Chika:
Let me see.
 "Stretch your leg out, and hold it there for 10 seconds."
"And then lie still for 30 seconds and let your body and heart rest."
 I see.
Huh...
 That smells good... I am so hungry...
 ...Smells good?!
I knew it!

Miu:
Want some chips, Chubby?

Chika:
No, I do not!

Chika's mom:
Chika, the bath is ready!

Chika:
'Kay!
 I'm going to have bath. So I'll see you later.

Miu:
Huh...?
 He he...

Chika:
Let your back and bum sit in the bathtub, and lift your legs...
 Uh... whoa, that's pretty difficult!
 Huh...?

Miu:
Whoooa!!! This is for girls only!

Chika:
Oh, shut up!
 How long are you gonna stay?

Miu:
What? I'm here to hang out with you!

Chika:
Stop bothering me, would ya?

Miu:
Uh-huh... And fire!!!
Chika:
Eek!
 I said, "Stop bothering me"!
Miu:
...And they say that if you alternate between hot and cold water, it's exactly like getting a real massage.
 And there's a few hundred kilos of water pressure in the bath, so it's good for dieting.

Chika:
Did you read that book?

Miu:
Mm-hm.

Chika:
Hm... It doesn't make any difference if you read it, you know?
You're always using stuff in my room without asking my per... huh?
 ...Um, Miu?
 ...What are you doing?

Miu:
Just drifting away...
Hey! It's dark! It's all black! Why!? Where am I!?
Gosh, I really thought I drifted away there.

Chika:
Don't be ridiculous. Now, move over.

Miu:
It's squishy in here, now.
 We used to be able to bathe together.

Chika:
We're both bigger now, so we can't be helped.
 Yeah, and I never worried about getting fat before now either.

Miu:
Chika, You're like an adult.
 Are you 48 years old or something?

Chika:
You're just childish, that's all.
 Huh...

bum: 尻
ridiculous: ばかげた、おかしな（Don't be ridiculous: ばかなことを言うな）
bathe: 入浴する、水を浴びる
squishy: (不明：squish は squash: 押しつぶす と同じ意味で使われることがあるので、その形容詞型も押しつぶされるという意味が残っているかも）



Nobue:
Oh, dear... For goodness sake...

Chika:
Sorry that I didn't ask to borrow it...

Nobue:
That's fine. But, you know what...

Chika:
But I'm fat!

Nobue:
Huh?

Chika:
It's true, sis! I gained one kilo since I had my last health checkup at school!

Nobue:
One whole kilo...?

Chika:
What should I do?
 Because, if this keeps up...

Nobue:
Wait a second. You know what, go stand over there, would ya?

Chika:
Huh?

Nobue:
142.5 centimeters. Get it?

Chika:
I'm taller...

Nobue:
See?

Chika:
Huh?

Nobue:
You're grown, Chi.
 So, of course your weight is gonna increase some.
 Because your body is growing, little sister? Don't you get it now?
 The extra weight is from the extra height.

Chika:
Oh, I see... Now I get it!

Nobue:
So, go and eat your dinner, 'kay?
 You've got leftovers.

Chika:
Yeah, ha!

Nobue:
Let's see... In your 20's, beware of gaining weight.
Ha! ... No way... It can't be...
 The scale must be off of it.

Miu:
Huh? Nobue?
 Want me to bring you the diet book?

Nobue:
Yeah...

Chika:
I'm off!
 Miu, I'm going! Hurry, hurry!

Miu:
Hey, wait!

Nobue's mom:
Oh, Nobue, you haven't eaten yet.

Nobue:
Ah, um, I'm just having coffee... Ouch!

beware: 気をつける
leftover(s): 食べ残し


Preview for episode 10
 Miu:
 Hey, hey, fight, fight!
 You're slow, Chika!

 Chika:
I'm tired of running…
Miu, let me ride that now.


 Miu:
Don't give up!
You don't wanna lose to the Matsuri-Coppora team, do you?


 Chika:
We're not competing.
Besides, what is Nobue's thinking getting us all together so suddenly?


 Miu:
She prob'ly isn't thinking about anything.


 Chika:
No, that would be you!


 Miu&Chika:
Be sure to watch the next Marshmallow!
