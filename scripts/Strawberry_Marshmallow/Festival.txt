  Miu:
Oh, yeah, today is festival day!


Chika:
Hey, that's my recorder!

Miu:
Maybe that's the truth!

Chika:
Use your own!
 Or it's gonna break!
 Give it back to me!

Miu:
There'll be fireworks at night along the river.
 And food stands selling yakisoba, soba, soba, takoyaki and cotton candy.
 And candy apples, apricot candy. Thump, thump, throat candy.

Chika:
They don't have them...

Miu:
Uh-oh. I don't have any cash, not a single yen...

Chika:
Didn't you say you got 1,500 yen for the festival?

Miu:
I think I spent it all. I bought comic books and then more comic books.

Matsuri:
Nobue said she'd help both of us put on our yukatas.

Ana:
That was really kind of her.
 ...Huh?

Matsuri:
What's wrong?

Ana:
I don't think I have a yukata...

Matsuri:
What do you mean you don't have a yukata?

Ana:
I've never worn one, and now that I think about it, I haven't ever seen one at my house!

Matsuri:
Gosh, that's just like a foreigner!

Ana:
Uh, Matsuri... did you say that on purpose?

Matsuri:
Huh?

Chika:
Done! Huh?
 Hey, Miu, the test is over in one minute. So, are you done?

Miu:
What, what, what... what, what what what.
 What is a test?

Chika:
I said, stop using my recorder!
 For goodness sake!

Miu:
Then, show me your test!

Chika:
No!

Miu:
Teacher! Chika won't let me look at her answers!

 Huh!


Miu:
...Why me? I ask.


firework(s): 花火、激しい怒り、興奮




Miu:
Incoming!

Chika:
 Oh!

Miu:
 Ha-ha-ha.


Nobue:
Your kimono fold is on the wrong side.
Chief once said it's bad luck to have left side on top.

Miu:　
Cheese... cake?

Nobue:
Chief, I said chief.
 The chief chef of the restaurant where I had a part-time job.

Miu:
Part-time job?

Nobue:
Breathe in, Chika.

Chika:
Ow! That's too tight, sis!

Nobue:
If it's not tight enough, it'll come loose too quickly!
The uniform at my old job was a kimono, and the chief chef...

Miu:
Just tell me what flavor the cheese cake was at your part-time job!?

Nobue:
There. That's good now. Huh?
Hello? Oh, Ana, what's wrong?
 Huh, you don't have a yukata? I see...
 Hum... Hum...
No that's okay. Come on over.

Ana:
Oh, dear. I just don't feel right wearing it...

Nobue:
Yeah... But it sure suits you, nicely, huh?

Chika:
Yeah! You look so cute!

Ana:
But, I feel kinda bad for Miu...

Miu:
Too cruel, how can you do this to an unwed girl.
 Today is festival day and it only comes once a year...

Matsuri:
Hello everybo...

Miu:
Stop right there!

Matsuri:
Huh? Why are you... dressed that way?

Miu:
Remember this!
 Hi-ya!

Chika:
But she's not dressed.

Nobue:
...You're next.


unwed: 未婚の




Nobue:
Is is too tight, Matsuri?

Matsuri:
No, it's okay.

Miu:
Mmmmmm... Nin, nin!

Nobue:
Your costume is wrong...

Matsuri:
Uh, Miu?

Miu:
No, I'm a ninja! Wa!
Namuuu...!

Nobue:
Miu, everything you're doing is wrong...
 Anyway, where did you get this stuff?
 Ah!

Miu:
Ah... Bring it on!

Ana:
It sure is hard to walk in a kimono...

Chika:
Yeah, but it really suits you, Ana.
 Would you mind getting the door?

Ana:
Sure.

Chika:
We're back.

Miu:
Nobue, prepare yourself! Ya, ya, yaa!

Nobue:
Your CD ninja star attack is failed.

Chika:
What do you think you're doing?!

Nobue:
Humph, next time around you'd better watch your back too.

Miu:
De-defeated...


bring it on!: かかってこい！
prepare yourself!: 覚悟しろ！
ninja star: 手裏剣



Nobue:
By the way, Chika is really good at baking, you know.
Ana:
Yes, these are delicious!

Matsuri:
Yeah!

Chika:
You know you shouldn't encourage her. Huh?


Nobue, Ana, Matsuri:
 Huh?

Miu:
I gotcha!

Nobue:
What kind of face is that?
 Are you a panda, a thief or a ninja?

Miu:
...And what if I'm all three?

Nobue:
What!?


Miu:
Charge!

Matsuri:
...What for?

Miu:
Not good, Matsuri. In the feudal era, you'd be dead.

Nobue:
You can't let your guard down in front of this panda thief...

Miu:
Don't call me that! I gotcha!
 Wait up!

Nobue:
No way, panda thief!

Chika:
You are both so immature...

Miu & Nobue:
Wa-ha-ha-ha!

Chika:
Hey, Matsuri, did you get spending money for today?

Matsuri:
Um, well I...

Miu:
Look, a UFO!

Nobue:
Yeah, you're right.

Miu:
Huh...?
Huh, damn it!
 How am I ever gonna find her weakness.
 Oh, I know, the seduction trick!
 After all these years, I know your weakness.

Nobue:
Huh?

Miu:
Oopsy! I dropped my sword!
 Oh, I can't reach it, I can't reach!

Nobue:
Now, who's vulnerable?

Miu:
What exactly is the seduction trick?

Nobue:
I don't know.
 But what you just did is definitely not it.

Chika:
Do you have spending money, Ana?

Ana:
I have about 2,000 yen.

Miu:
Huh,I know! Ana!


 Ana:



 Miu:
 Can you help me for a sec?

Ana:
O-kay.

Miu:
Sit right here, and act sensual.

Ana:
Huh? Sensual?

Miu:
Yeah, do this.

Ana:
You mean like this?

Miu:
No, that's not quite it...
 Put your thumb like... that. Yeah, yeah!
 Now turn your eyes upward!

Ana:
Miu, what are we doing here?

Miu:
 I think we just nailed it.

Miu:
Gotcha!

Nobue:
Put your feet a bit more that way.

Miu:
You're tougher than I thought!

Chika:
Aren't we ever gonna leave for the festival?

Nobue:
Oh, Chika, did you find it?

Chika:
Right there.


Everyone:
 Huh?

Nobue:
Alright, Miu. Get undressed.

Miu:
Lord Magistrate!

Nobue:
Sheesh.

Chika:
That was Nobue's yukata, from when she was a little girl,
 and we got mom to take it out of storage for us.

Matsuri:
It's so cute!

Nobue:
It looks pretty babyish now.
 But I think it'll suit Miu nicely.

Miu:
What's that supposed to mean?!

Nobue:
Just put it on!

Nobue:

Chika:
There are gonna be fireworks later, too!

Ana:
Can we please go and watch the fireworks from close up?

Chika:
Great idea! They're amazing! Breathtaking!

Ana:
Yay, I'm so excited!

Nobue:
The fireworks' display is quite ways from here.
 So, we should leave early.

Matsuri:
I'm scared of big fireworks...


 Miu:
 Ugh! 

Nobue:
You're so cute and timid, Matsuri?

Matsuri:
Um, b-but fireworks are so loud that they're scary to peal around.
 They go boom!

Ana:
Are they really that loud?

Matsuri:
Huh? Hm-hm, even louder than a starting gun at a race!

Chika:
I'm curious, Miu. What do you have in that big bag?

Miu:
In here? Cool things.

Nobue:
I don't understand what goes on in that head of hers
 and I really don't think I want to...


breathtaking: 息をのむような、驚くほどの
timid: ビクビクした、自信のない
peal: 大きな音がする、(鐘などが)鳴り響く

Matsuri:
Just look at all the people and stalls!

Nobue:
Come on! We're going, Miu.

Chika:
I wonder who would buy this kind of mask.

Ana:
...Goldfish scooping! Wow!


Miu:
Hey, Ana, do you know what goldfish scooping is?

Ana:
Huh?

Miu:
Just watch. Stand over them like this, and... Say red!
 Hey, it's no big deal, it's all just for fun.

Nobue:
Stop making up stories.

Chika:
Guys, can we get started?

Nobue:
Alright then. Let's do it!

A man in the stall:
Step right up.
 300 yen, thank you.
 Here you go!

Miu:
Here.

a man in the stall:
Ummm... Huh?

Miu:
What's wrong? You've never seen a sock before?

a man in the stall:
But... A sock, it's...

Miu:
My father's socks are 500 yen a pair, so one of them is worth 250 yen.
 And mini-soap is 50 yen, so.
 Huh?
 Alright, fine! What about this!?
 This is a high quality environmentally friendly item.
 And all you have to do is bring it back to the supermarket recycling box!
 Well then?
 ...Now what am I supposed to do?

a man in the stall:
W-what are you supposed to do?

Nobue:
Okay, that's it...!
 I'm sorry about that...
 Pay me back with interest!

Matsuri:
Oops, oh, um, darn...

Ana:
Oh... look it ripped...

Matsuri:
So did mine...
Wow, Chika, you caught two!

Miu:
Hang on, goldfish! I promise I'll save you.
 You can't die, goldfish... Gotcha!

Ana:
Ah, I get it, Miu's not scooping them, she's saving the goldfish.
 Not this one, but this one!

Matsuri:
Oh, I see, Ana, she's not catching them, she's helping them!

Chika:
You sure know some hard characters.

Nobue:
You're good at this, Miu. I'm impressed!

Miu:
Amazing, huh? Catch and release.

Nobue:
Watch it!


stall(s): 屋台
step right up: いらっしゃいませ
rip(ped): 破れる



Chika:
They're so cute!

Nobue:
You better take care of them, you know.
 ...But they're festival fish, so they probably won't last long.

Chika:
That's not true.
 On TV, they said if you can take care of them, they can live for as long as 10 years.
 Oh, I should name them.

Nobue:
Call them Richard and James.

Chika:
What kind of names are those?

Nobue:
It's decided then.

Ana:
A target practice game!

Miu:
Yeah! The object of the game is to shoot...

Nobue:
See all those prizes lined up on the shelf?
 You shoot them with this, and if you hit one of them, that lady will shoot back at you.
 Kinda scary, huh?

Miu:
Come on now, it's no good if you make up stories like that.
 The truth is, if you hit those things, everything around us will blow up!
 It'll go "Bus-gas-bakuhatsu!"

Nobue:
...No, that's not right.
 Actually, it doesn't make any sense at all.

Miu:
It's true! Hey Matsuri...!

Ana:
Hm... I know how to play target practice.
 It's easy...

Miu:
Matsuri, can you say any tongue twisters?
 If you ask me, you don't look like you'd be able to.

Matsuri:
Huh? Um, gee, I don't know.

Miu:
Okay, let's try!
 "Fruit-juice-chushutsu-chu." Go.

Matsuri:
Alright. Fruit-chu-chu-chu-chu...
 Mmmmm...

Nobue:
I got something cool...!

Matsuri:
...Fruit-*`<_@%#...

Nobue:
...Matsuri, there're easier ones.

Matsuri:
Huh?

Nobue:
"Shujutsu-chu." Try it.

Matsuri:
Syu-ji-ju...

Nobue:
Oh, dear...
 Can you say it? Go "shujutsu-chu."

Chika:
Shujutsu-tyu.

Nobue:
That was good!
 What about you, Ana?

Ana:
Shujutsu-chu...?

Nobue:
Ha, that was kinda cute.
 Hey, Miu, "shujutsu..."

Miu:
Doctor, thank you so much for taking care of my boy.
 It isn't much, but please accept this...!

Nobue:
That comes after the operation, doesn't it?


tongue twister(s): 早口言葉



Chika:
Let's do the ring tossing game.

A man in the stall:
Here you go. A hundred yen.


 Miu:



A man in the stall:
 Hm?

Nobue:
Sorry, she gets things a bit mixed up sometimes.


Chika:
I did it!

Ana:
Chika, you're good!


 Miu:
 Huh?

Chika:
Ana, you can throw some of my rings if you want to.


 Miu:
Ya!


 Chika, Ana:
 Huh?


 Miu:
 Ha!

Nobue:
Let's see. Try saying it with the accent on the "tsu", 'kay?

Matsuri:
"Tsu?"

Nobue:
Yes, Shuju-"tsu"-tyu.

Matsuri:
Shu-ju-jyu. Mmmmmm...

Nobue:
Listen, don't worry about it so much, alright?

Chika:
Hey, do you want to get something to eat 'cuz I'm hungry.

Miu:
I agree!

Nobue:
How many do we need?

Chika:
Hm... Two should be enough, I think.


 Miu:
 Ya!

Nobue:
Hey, Ana, why don't you try a candy apple?
 They're good.

Ana:
Uh, beautiful!

Nobue:
I'd like one candy apple, please.

a man in the stall:
Here, please enjoy.

Nobue:
Thanks.
 ...Huh?
Oh no. Can somebody lend me change for the bus?

Chika:
You didn't have to pay for everything.

Nobue:
It just happened...
 Ana, how's that candy apple?

Ana:
It's really delicious!

Nobue:
Hey, show me your tongue!

Ana:
Huh? Mmmm!

Nobue:
Good work!

Chika:
Huh?

Nobue:
...What?

Ana:
It's Miu!


 Matsuri:
 Huh?

Miu:
Welcome, step right up!
 One try is only 1,000 yen!
 Come on! It's cheap!
 If an apology is good enough, you won't need the cops!
Come on! Cheer up, people! What's wrong with everyone!?
 Okay fine! Only 50 yen! ...Alright, 30 yen!

Nobue:
What are you thinking, Miu!?
 And besides, what kinda sale is this?
 It's weird!

Chika:
This shampoo bottle is empty.

Ana:
And this water bottle has nothing in it either.

Matsuri:
And this glove is completely worn out!

Nobue:
You probably found it on the ground somewhere, right?
 There isn't a single item here I would buy...

A man:
Hum? Hey, little girl.
 Listen, you need a license if you're gonna do business here.

Miu:
Yah! In fact, I'm not doing business.
 I haven't sold a single thing yet!
 So, if you'd like buy something, that'd be great.

A man:
This is a walkway, so it could be hazardous. Please just quickly...

Miu:
Wah, uh, uh, seriously!?
 I'm so sorry, customers.
 I have to close early today, so please come again tomorrow.

Nobue:
Hm. Oh my, I wonder what that food stand is selling! Ha, ha...
...Now, which way did Miu go?

Matsuri:
Maybe she's hiding, 'cause she thinks she's in trouble.

Nobue:
It's not likely she'd hide.


 Chika:
Huh?


Nobue:
Huh? Festival tunes have gotten a lot more catchy over the years...

Chika:
Whoa! Miu!

Nobue:
What's wrong, Chika?

Chika:
Look, sis, it's Miu!

A man:
Little girl, little girl, where did you come from!?

Miu:
Mister, you're in the way!

Nobue:
Nop, I don't know her, I don't hear her...

A man:
Give me back those drum sticks.

Miu:
Hey, stop it!

A man:
Ouch!

Miu:
I'm in the zone here! Don't be surprised and you get burned
 if you're too close to me!

Chika:
Sis, I think this is getting out of hand!

A man:
Hey, just give that stick to me!

Miu:
No!

A man:
Ow! Behave yourself!


 Ana:
 Miu!

Miu:
Let go! Help me, Nobue! Nobue Itou!
 This is your cute little sister calling for help from in front of the drums!

Nobue:
That does it! Chi, hold this and don't move.

A woman:
Your cute little sister is asking for help in front of the drums.

Nobue:
I'm so sorry for all of this.
 I promise I'll give her a good talking to.
 Please forgive her?
 Now, say you're sorry.

A man:
Ha-ha-ha-ha, well, well it is festival time after all.
 I don't want to be too hard on her.

Miu:
Now, do you see, Nobue?
 I'm sorry she's being such a big spoilsport.
 I'll give her a good talking to.

Nobue:
Why you...! Huh?

Chika, Matsuri, Ana:
Huh? 

Miu:
Fireworks...

Matsuri:
Looks like they already started...

Ana:
We can't see 'em...

Don't even say that.

Chika:
Maybe we weren't able to see the fireworks, but the festival was great, wasn't it?

Matsuri:
Yeah, the booths were so interesting.

Ana:
And we got to ware yukatas. It was a lot of fun.


 Nobue:
Huh?

Matsuri:
I have marks on my feet from my sandals.

Ana:
You do!

Chika:
Me too.

Miu:
Look! Look! My foot!

Matsuri:
The bottom of your foot is so black, Miu!

Miu:
Isn't it amazing?

Chika:
Miu, it's nothing to brag about, you know?

Nobue:
Hey, you guys.
 Look at what I just discovered in the storage room.
 Wanna try 'em?

Girls:
Yes!

Nobue:
This is pretty cool, too.

Matsuri:
I prefer these kinds of fireworks.

Ana:
Summer sure has flown by, hasn't it?

Chika:
It was fun! But I'm a little sad that it's over already.

Miu:
Yeah!

Nobue:
You...!
 I'm gonna take you back to the festival and sell you!

Miu:
Eek! Help me! Richard! James!


brag: 自慢する
fly by (has flown by): あっという間に過ぎ去る




Chika:
 I'm done.

Nobue:
 Why'd you leave so much food on your plate?

Chika:
 I'm not very hungry right now.

Nobue:
Really?
 You did the same thing yesterday.

Miu:
 Well, since Chika's dieting, I'll eat 'em for her.

Chika:
 Stop saying that, Miu.
 I'm not dieting.

Nobue:
What's wrong with Chika?

Miu:
 I'm so worried I can't eat.
 Oh, can I have seconds, please?

Nobue:
There's none for you.


 Be sure to watch the next Marshmallow!
