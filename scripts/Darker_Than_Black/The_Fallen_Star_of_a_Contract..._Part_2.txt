Chiaki:
Did you know? Whenever you see a falling star, it means one of them has died.
Just now, out there in the world somewhere, a contractor took his last breath.
It's their sky now, ever since that day, ten years ago, when the real stars disappeared, they became the new stars. Cold-blooded contractors with special abilities, soulless dolls...
Most people, they have no idea, the truth the governments don't want them to know.
They use Gate-based technology called ME to erase the memories of anyone who comes into contact with them.
Of course, behind the scenes, these same governments are all too quick to exploit them for their abilities.

Hei:
Sounds like you know a lot about them.

Chiaki:
I worked at the national laboratories for a long time.
I may have read a few files I wasn't supposed to along the way.
But even before that you could say I had something of a personal interest.
Seen my mom and dad died when I was pretty young, still in high school, sophomore, I think.
Police said it was an accident, but... that was a lie, I saw it, a contractor, murdering my parents.
My eyes were open that day. I have been fascinated ever since.



Kirihara:
Astronomics confirmed the activity of another suspected French agent at about the same time you say you lost her.
Code name, Jean. Our files list his ability as matter exchange teleportation.
The surveillance specters pinpointed the scene of latest activity, but beyond that, no leads as to where he might be now.

Saito:
Sorry about this, chief. We had her, I don't know, maybe if we'd reacted faster...

Kirihara:
What you do on your own time is your business.
But don't let your guard down.
They tell me BK201 is also showing signs of activity.
Watch yourselves.

Saito & Kono:
Right.

Saito:
Damn it, this is all your fault.

Kono:
Mine? How you figure?



Chiaki:
I guess... someone already beat us here.

Hei:
You should grab what you can and get changed.
I think it's safe, but if anything happens, I'm right next door.

Chiaki:
It doesn't feel real. But it is, isn't it?
Louis was a contractor... that he's dead...
Wait! Don't go, please!



Chiaki:
Leave the lights off?
It's so strange.
It's like I'm home but not at the same time.
Your apartment is an exact copy of mime, just in reverse.
It's like a reflection.
You know, I've only been living here for two weeks now.
But already it's hard to imagine that I ever lived anywhere else.
It's like for the first time, I felt alive.
I mean, here I am, me working in a place called club pinky.
And I can honestly say I've never been happier.
When I think about the person I was obsessing over my work night and day in the lab and the person I am now.
Everyday I wait here it's harder to tell which is the real me.
I figured none of that would matter, though. Soon Louis was gonna come and take me away... to get to start over.
But he's not coming back, is he?

Hei:
Do you know what you gonna do now?

Chiaki:
Haven't you been listening?
Louis was the one with the answers, not me.

Hei:
We'll figure something out.
We could run away together.

Chiaki:
But you... No, that's crazy, right?
You just moved in here today.

Hei:
I know. But somehow it feels like, this is what was supposed to happen.
I think it was fate that we met today.
I mean, if you believe in that sort of thing.

Chiaki:
Listen to what you're saying... what you need to do is forget today ever happened and forget about me.

Hei:
They've seen my face, right? They'll come looking for me eventually.

Chiaki:
Can I... really trust you?

Kono:
Ah, nice.

Saito:
At least we're on the right track.
C'mon, let's get to it. Maybe they left something behind.

Kono:
Yeah, sure, I wouldn't get my hopes up.

Kono:
Just a cat, huh?



Hei:
So this is the guy I know.
He runs this little import business in Macao.
He's got a lot of backroom connections and that sort of thing.
I think he can set us up with passports.

Chiaki:
Passports. You're talking about smuggling ourselves out of the country...?
How do you know about all this? I thought you were just a student.

Hei:
Actually, it's a little more complicated than that.

Chiaki:
That always is, isn't it? I guess I shouldn't be surprised at this point.

Hei:
But, listen. To do this, we're going to need a lot of money.

Chiaki:
Money, huh?
Remind to have a problem there, I just got what's in my purse, that's it.

Hei:
Then maybe there's something else, like something we could trade.

Chiaki:
How about information?

Hei:
What do you mean?

Chiaki:
I mean... what if I say I could get my hands on a stash of Pandora files, high level stuff, top secret...

Hei:
Can you? That might be enough.
I hear people will pay a good price for any information about the Gate even if it's trivial.

Chiaki:
Yeah, but... I'm talking the most radical theories since, say, compressed-gravity repulsion units or ME technology.

Hei:
Then that sounds perfect.
If anything it's more than enough.
He might just get out of this yet, Miss Haraguchi.

Chiaki:
I guess it's about time I told you.
That's not actually my name. It's Chiaki. Chiaki Shinoda.

Hei:
Chiaki, huh? Nice. Very pretty.
I'm glad I finally earned your trust.
There any other secrets you need to spring on me?

Chiaki:
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.
No, no more secrets.

Clerk:
Here you go. Sorry for the wait.
I think that's all of it. If you need anything else, let me know.

Hei:
Thanks.

Clerk:
Enjoy.

Chiaki:
I know I said you could order whatever you wanted... but... who the hell are you gonna eat all of this!?

Hei:
Did I overdo it? Sorry this is actually less than I usually get.

Chiaki:
You're gonna get so fat. FAT.
Sure maybe you can get away with it now but by the time you're 30 and your metabolism slows down, I mean, if there's any justice in the world...
Now that I think about it, running for your life does tend to burn the calories.

Hei:
Everything all right over there?

Chiaki:
I'm fine, just a little worn out.
I'll be right back, okay?
You go ahead and eat.

Huang:
I gotta hand it to you.
They said you were supposed to be good, but this is something else.

Hei:
What is?

Huang:
You make it looks so easy all your guises like you were made for this kinda work.
'cause it helps you don't have that pesky conscience get in the way.
You got a line on the stuff, right? So hurry up and get it.
They'll be on you before you knowing.
I suggest you take care of the girl before there's a problem.

Clerk:
Thanks, come back and see us!

Clerk:
Good evening. Is it just the two of you?
Excuse you!

Cooks:
Wow, folks, you can't come back here!
Stop! We're not kidding!

Hei:
Hurry!

Chiaki:
Wait, are you hurt?

Hei:
Just go!

Alain:
We lost 'em. Yeah, both of 'em.
Come meet us here.
Yeah, it's him. He's a rat.



Mao:
The transmission's been cut.

Huang:
What's he doing? Thinking try to put it over on us?

Mao:
Not likely. I doubt he'd stand to gain anything.
He's a contractor. It's his nature to do what's in his best interest.

Huang:
He's gotta strange way of going about it.
He should kill the damn girl and get out of there already.
I mean, what the hell's he waiting for?

Mao:
It is odd. I'll give you that.
Where is he now?

Yin:
I don't know
He's in a place with no water.



Chiaki:
Should I stop?

Hei:
No.

Chiaki:
I'm so sorry. This is all my fault.
It doesn't matter what we do, does it?
They won't let us escape.

Hei:
Listen, you're tired.
I mean it, you're pale as ghost.
You should try and get some sleep.

Chiaki:
I am tired. I'm tired of running. I'm tired of being afraid.
It's always the same thing over and over... just when I start to feel safe that's when they show up again.
Maybe it's something about me, maybe I draw them to me somehow.
I don't know why they come.
All I do know was I want this to end.
No contractors or dolls. I just wanna feel what it's like to walk down a street again without looking over my shoulder.
But I brought this on myself. I realize that now.
Back then, the day my parents died, for some reason I didn't tell anyone what I saw.
That first contractor was just a kid, a little girl, I think.
I never even got a good look at her face. It was just that glow, the synchrotron radiation, cold and soft like starlight.
No matter how much I wanted to, I couldn't look away.
It still doesn't seem real sometimes.
I have to remind myself that it wasn't all a dream.
You know?

Hei:
It's not too late. You can still have those memories erased. Start over.

Chiaki:
It's not that easy.
They've been with me for so long... as awful as they are my memories have made me who I am.
If I erase them now, I'll erase myself.
So what if you were me? Could you erase your memories if you thought you might lose yourself in the process?

Hei:
Contractors are not humans, Chiaki.
They're monsters, killing machines in human skin.

Chiaki:
I know that.

Hei:
All they care about is self preservation and they won't hesitate to kill anyone they see as a threat.
They're liars, betrayers.
The Less you know, the better.



Chiaki:
How did they find us here?

Hei:
Try to forget.

Police:
Lady, you're okay?
Miss?

Saito:
Saito here.
I got a report that one of our units just picked up the Shinoda woman outside the Mita station.
They also spotted the man matching the description of that French agent.
I'm heading there now.

Kirihara:
Roger that. I'll send some additional backup your way.

Astronomics:
New data from astronomics.
BK201 is showing activity.

Kirihara:
Understood.

Matsumoto:
Chief, it's Matsumoto.
We've just IDed Chiaki Shinoda's body.

Kirihara:
Where?

Police:
Can you stand, Miss?
Here. Let me help you.
Come back here!



Jean:
We've been looking for you.
You're the contractor who killed Louis, aren't you?

Chiaki:
Was it really you? Are you the one who killed him?

Hei:
That's right.

Chiaki:
You lied.

Hei:
I told you. Contractors are liars. I'm no different.

Jean:
And now the rat falls into our trap.
This lovely thing isn't actually Chiaki Shinoda.
We used ME to implant a doll with Chiaki's memories.
There's no way you'd guess she was a copy. She didn't even know herself.
Now that I've used the key phrase to revert her programming, the Chiaki you knew has gone forever. Now we're lost.
The memory implants would've only lasted another day or two, anyway.
Besides, she served her purpose. She drew you out and handed you right to us.

Alain:
I can't believe Louis got himself killed by this guy.
I really thought he would've put more of a fight.

Mao:
He will. And when he does you might want to keep in mind.
Hei doesn't wear that coat as a fashion statement.
It's bulletproof.

Jean:
Alain!

Huang:
So you fell for a decoy and walked right into an ambush.
Meanwhile, the real item has already been acquired by another team.
In other words, the syndicate thought this one coming, you get me?
You should have just killed that damn puppet like I told you to.

Hei:
Don't call her that. She wasn't a puppet.

Huang:
She sure as hell wasn't a person.
An empty shell, nothing more. That's what dolls are, just like all you contractors are nothing but cold-blooded killers.

Mao:
That's enough, Huang. Let's focus on finishing the job.
Yin, have you located him yet?

Yin:
Yes. He's not far.



Hei:
Yes?

Kirihara:
Sorry to bother you, sir. We were hoping you could help us.
We've been talking to the tenants in your building about the woman who was living next door, Ayami Haraguchi.
We were wondering if you've ever noticed anything unusual about her, anything at all.

Hei:
I never met her. I only just moved in a few days ago. I'm sorry.

Kirihara:
So you're new here. In that case, would you mind if I asked to see some identification? Just a formality.

Hei:
Sure.

Kirihara:
All right, sir. Thank you for your time.
I'll leave you my card. If you happen to remember anything or if you hear anything that might be of interest to us, you can call that number day or night.

Saito:
What is it? Is there something wrong, chief?

Kirihara:
No. No, it's nothing.
Come on. Let's go.

Saito:
Right.



Hell is the place forgotten within the fog. The soft blue glow, a constant reminder of the past that cannot be escaped. Stop! The girl is innocent. The scream hangs in the air. Unheard, unanswered. Still the star burns brighter. The mark of the contractor. The curse that can never be erased. And then, the light disappears.
