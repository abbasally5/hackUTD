Hei:
Answer me!
Just fill in the blanks, Carmine.
The day the Heaven's Gate disappeared you, Amber and Pai were all there.
You must have seen it. You know what happened.
I don't wanna keep hurting you but I will.
Why are we the only ones left? Where are they?
What happened to my sister!?

Havoc:
I don't know. I worked best alone just like you.
Amber and Pai were my colleagues but they weren't my friends.
Who knows where they are. I don't know what they were doing or even they were still alive.
Yeah. I was in South America just like them.
Carrying out my mission with the syndicate at Heaven's Gate.
But, whatever made it vanished lost me now. I only remember the light.
It's swallowed me whole them. When I wake up I was across the ocean with no idea how I'd gotten there.
For whatever reason, my powers had disappeared.
So I stayed in Romania. Doing whatever it took to get by.
Without papers or any jobs that was traceable.
No syndicate, no contracts.
I just tried to fade away.

Hei:
You don't remember?
You expect me to believe that?

Havoc:
Yes. If you're what people think you are.
I don't have the answers you want. That should be obvious by now.
Emotions can make normal humans unpredictable and royal to others.
But contractors are rational which means they are transparent.
They don't care about ideology or the people they work for.
It's us or them.
Humans may choose tortured to protect greater cause but contractors will always talk to save themselves. Always.
That's a simple pragmatism any contractor understands so why don't you.
You were called the black reaper for a reason.
In the old days you were more ruthless than anyone.
Even though you weren't changed like us by the power.
But now that you've become a contractor you've somehow stopped acting like one.
You're letting a poor lost sister turn you soft.

Hei:
Shut up!

Havoc:
See? You are emotional.
Like someone in Moratorium but that can't be right because you're stable and in control.
You don't seem to pay a price for your powers either.
Are you really a contractor at all?



Kirihara:
BK201. I know the rumors that He's cursed, shadowed by riddles and death.
But what's the real story. Who's backing him?
And our friends from MI6?

Saito:
We checked them into the hotel.
Kono and Matsumoto are watching their every move, Chief. Don't worry.
We wouldn't let them roam free in our city after what they...

November 11:
Well, this must be the place.
Precisely as July described it.

Kirihara:
I didn't realize you would be joining us

November 11:
I've been looking for you, Mizuki.

Kirihara:
I assigned two of my men to you, November 11, so you can contact me with these [kinds of] concerns.
Excuse me.
This had better be good.

Kono:
Chief, I'm sorry. The MI6 clue, we've lost them.

Kirihara:
They're standing right behind me.

Kono:
What? How?

Kirihara:
Doesn't matter. Just get over here.

November 11:
I trust everything is all right?

Kirihara:
Fine.

November 11:
I'm glad. Then let's talk about how we can help you.
We are servants at your feet.

Kirihara:
Thank you, but we've got this under control.

November 11:
With all due respect, we are in this together.
We have a contractor who shrouded in mystery. He's abducted a forfeiter who is the most lethal agent on record before her power somehow disappeared.
And the blame for abduction falls equally on both our shoulders.
Now we just want to work with you to prevent any new death toll.
You'll stay completely in charge, of course.
But mark my word. We'll get Havoc away from this 201 without either of them ever hurting your men or your citizens.

Kirihara:
I believe you will.

Saito:
But, Chief!

Kirihara:
Your team will be very useful to us.



Havoc:
Where am I?

Havoc:
I see your new power hasn't affected your appetite.
Do you always cook your meals yourself?
Most in my life, up until the day I lost my abilities, I never enjoyed food at all like I didn't even taste it.
It was just means to xxx, you know, fuel for my next attack.
But then, in Romania I met Lola's family and they taught me what it really means to cook.
Her kids hated stuff I'd make and they try to keep me busy while I turn on the oven.
But I kept practicing and before long they didn't complain and even make request for my meat or bean stew.
I gotta love that. I gotta be obsessed with it.
Always looking for more recipes to try.
It was the look they got when they first taste it's something new. I lived for that.
Can you picture me there? Cooking for smiles.
Me who used drink children's blood as my price.
That's so good.
Lola's mother was always giving me advice.
She told me I should never trust a man who knows how to cook for himself.
He'll be nothing but trouble till the day he dies.
I'm teasing you, Hei.
You mad at me now?
This sensitive contractor, huh.
Whatever's happened, they really have changed your life.
Relax. That's a good thing.

Hei:
It's not just me.
You're different also.
Tonight is the first time I've ever seen you smile.

Havoc:
It's a hardly a feeling I'm used to.
But I'm sure you can relate to that.
I don't know why Heaven's Gate vanished.
But what if it was by design? And this is what they gave us. Our second chances.
What if the rest of them live through it too, spread out across continents.
Untraced with a clean slate.
I wanna help you find out.
The moment my plane landed here I was sure of it. If I go to Hell's Gate I'll get everything back, my powers, my lost memories.
And if I learn what happened that day, I should be able to tell you where your sister went.
But I won't go unless you promise me one thing, Hei.
Once I'm there if I start changing, if I go back to how I was, you have to kill me right there on the spot.



Yin:
I see him.

Huang:
Where is he?

Yin:
Ichigaya, Yanagi-Cho. They're on the move now.

Huang:
At least the best that hasn't gone far.

Mao:
Yin, which way are they headed?

Yin:
To east.



November11:
It's a peculiar feeling being here.
Any contractor will tell you. The Gate has a pull, stirs us to recall.
You might say it's like coming home.
I see why researchers want to study Havoc here but I just hope they're prepared.
There's no telling how she reacts.

Kirihara:
We'll detain her before that happens.

November 11:
That's an excellent plan.
If she does regain her powers for instance, those sub-machine guns aren't going to do you any good.
Of course, the other pressing question is what Mr. 201 gains by bringing her here.
When Havoc was taken I thought she should be floating face down within the air.

Kirihara:
And why is that?

November 11:
Simple.
With all the work Havoc did before she went dark, I'm sure several groups will be inconvenient if she regains her memories from Heaven's Gate.
201 is an assassin from one of those groups, or so I thought.
But he's had his opportunity and Havoc's still alive.
And after all that trouble to keep her from Pandora, he's doing that work fool them by taking her to Hell's Gate and support team doesn't seem to be with him.
Quite a puzzle.




Hei:
We can stop.

Havoc:
Let's go...



Yin:
Found him.

Mao:
Location?

Yin:
Sotobori-Dori street. At the fence.

Huang:
And is Havoc still with him?

Yin:
She is. Hold on.



Kirihara:
Base, is that you?

Otsuka:
Chief, we've got a report from Astronomics priority one.
It's a real time spectrum report.
Havoc's star is entering the visible domain.

Kirihara:
Your signal's cutting out. Repeat after Havoc.

Otsuka:
Her star is active. It looks like she's getting her power back.

Kirihara:
Mobilize the special forces units at my coordinates.
But tell them not to fire under any circumstance until I give the orders.

Otsuka:
(noisy)

Kirihara:
Where did November 11 go?

Saito:
He was right here.

Kono:
Now what?



Hei:
Wait!

Havoc:
I'm sorry, Hei. Stay away.
I can feel... the impulse of the anger. They're coming back to me.
I put if [you] could change I could do, that I control with this time and be something close to human.
But I was giving myself.
I can't fight it now.
I'm sorry. It's not meant to be...
If only I had met you earlier...
Maybe I could've learned... kept those better parts of me...
Maybe I wouldn't be a forfeiter... I wouldn't have needed to forget...
Kill me... Please, Hei.

Hei:
I won't let you give up.
Remember you're not a contractor anymore. And you don't ever need to be.



Saito:
We've seen that before.



Havoc:
I'm scared. Please. I can't go back.
No. I can't kill anymore! I can't see their faces again!
Don't let me! Please!

Hei:
You're not going to.
Your powers won't come back if we get you away from the Gate.
I'll learn what happened to my sister some other way.
You won't kill again.
Alright?

Havoc:
It's too late. Run.
Hei...



November 11:
The problem with classified mission is you never get xxx.
Love the fighting spirit. Though your strikes aren't going to reach me from over there, I'm afraid.
Hardly fashionable but effective for sure.
I have to hand it to the [factory] xxx. Their rubber is all within of the highest grade like it's xxx electric cancel deck.
Havoc's dead.
Whatever your mission was, it's over. And I've used most of my power thanks to you.
Let's say we both get benefit from little friendly conversation.
Cooperate, and we'll make sure you're not charged with anything.
There's no need to turn you over to the local police or Pandora's pros.
MI6 doesn't mind xxx fellows.
Learning about the organization xxx and that's much more bound to us.
Make the rational choice like the contractor you are, 201.
I would hate to see you suffer.

Hei:
Die!



Kirihara:
Strange, she didn't use her power when she had the chance, don't you think?
We just got a full report from Astronomics.
Seems Havoc was in the process of gaining her power but she stopped.
I didn't realize you are that afraid of anyone, let alone a forfeiter who didn't even wanna fight.
Relax. That's a joke.



Mao:
You disobeyed direct orders. Why?

Huang:
The syndicate believes we were flashed out of xxx a team.
If they learn we covered for you we'll all pay.
And I don't plan to die for you.

Hei:
If you're so worried then maybe you should've killed me when you had the chance.

Huang:
Don't xxx, freak! You don't know how close I was!

Mao:
Huang!

Huang:
You contractors are just weapons so do your job xxx don't xxx fire!



Decade:
Go ahead.
I've already read the report.
No, I want you to stay put.
See what else you can find out about the organization and this BK201.
