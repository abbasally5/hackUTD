Hei:
It's a list of employees going back ten years.
It'll be helpful in finding the contractor we're looking for.

Huang:
If we can smoke out the industrial spies that infiltrated Fiore xxx we should be able to find him and eliminate him.

Hei:
Yin, have you had any luck locating Mao?

Yin:
Nothing yet. Right now he could be anywhere.



Yabuta:
Sergeant Yabuta, robbery and homicide.
If you don't mind I'd like to ask the lady of the house a few questions.

Mao:
What the hell did I get myself into?



Yabuta:
I had forensics run tests on the victim's teeth.
The body you found belongs to Katsuragi Toshiko.
Usually in a case like this, we assume the stair's handrail is loose and the victim simply leaned against it and fell.
It happens more than you think in old houses like that.
So we go in, take some photographs, write a report and close the book.
But not this time. 'cause you're in the thick of it, Matsukichi.

Kurasawa:
I dropped my past and the name Matsukichi a long long time ago, sergeant.
Nowadays I'm known as Gai. Gai Kurasawa.

Yabuta:
Oh, please. Do you think you're impressing me with that silly name?
Great. It's more impressive than [near/your] detective work.
Connecting this case with the cosmetic suicide conspiracy?

Kurasawa:
I just remembered why I quit this place.
I can't stand working with a bunch of close minded putzes like you.

Yabuta:
You quit because you couldn't detect your way out of a wet paper bag.
Do us all a favor and drop this PI farce.
You're not fooling anyone.
I don't even think you're fooling yourself, Matsukichi.

Kurasawa:
Hearing the name Matsukichi is dumb. I can't lie.
But I know he's dead. Replaced by Gai Kurasawa.
And Gai Kurosawa has a hunch that the missing pussycat of a dead man's ex-wife is somehow connected to a cosmetics empire.
Hell, it probably goes even further than that. How far is anyone's guess.
But the difference between me and a hack like Yabuta is that I'm willing to take that walk.

Ukiyama:
It's about time.

Kurasawa:
You again. It's a little late to be going to work at this hour.
What are you doing around here?

Hei:
I didn't know it was wrong to take a walk.

Kurasawa:
It seems a little odd is all.

Hei:
I like to watch the stars.

Kurasawa:
The stars? Sorry, kid. But it's cloudy up there.



Kurasawa:
Are you holding up?
They asked you a lot of personal questions, right?
Cops really do love making a high class lady like yourself feel guilty.
I'm sorry about all that.

The widow:
There's no need to apologize. I'm familiar with how cops act.

Kurasawa:
Well, at least I found your cat. That was yours, right?

The widow:
What cat?

Kurasawa:
That black cat.

The widow:
Yes, of course. That black cat.
That one you found isn't my cat.

Kurasawa:
What?

The widow:
Mine has much more refined features.

Kurasawa:
How was I supposed to tell they look exactly the same?

The widow:
No. They're completely different.
Miko was gentle. The one you brought has bad attitude.

Mao:
If only I hadn't dropped my radio.

Kurasawa:
Gotcha!

Mao:
This is how people end up in the pound.

The widow:
Well, you see. When Toshiko was still married to Yuzuki she once confronted me, threatened me actually.

Kurasawa:
You're speaking of your husband's first wife?

The widow:
Yes. She told me I was no longer allowed to be around Yuzuki.
She never yelled, but I could sense the threat.
Often it's the calmest people who are the most intimidating.
But her eyes frightened me so much.

Kurasawa:
They say they're the windows to the soul.

The widow:
It was then that I realized something.
Her smell... Toshiko never wore any kind of fragrance.
Yuzuki want to... actually he demanded that she never wear perfume.
He desired her natural scent over any manmade variety.
I can't explain why but knowing this inferiorated me.
Wouldn't you be angry too?
Every person is born with their own unique scent.
It's like being told that he prefers you wearing makeup other than showing your natural face.

Kurasawa:
Her relationship to Toshiko was trickier than I thought.
The easy answer is she murdered her.
But, no. That can't be right. Not a classy dame like her.
The cat! I can't take this!
What am I supposed to do with the cat!?
Now that I think about it, the guy with big appetite was also hanging around Toshiko's. That's kinda suspicious.
It's possible he could have killed her.
He'd certainly have the energy with all the food in his gut.
But things don't add up for him. And why am I talking to a cat about this?
Knock it off, cat! You're messing up my detective style.
What am I gonna do? I can't have a cat in the office.
I already got Kiko.
If I was crazy I toss you down there and watch you sink.

Mao:
Now hold on. That's animal abuse.
What are you, some kind of sociopath?

Kurasawa:
Who's there?

Ukiyama:
Don't worry. I'm not here to fight.
Just give me back my jacket nice and quiet.

Kurasawa:
I know you. We bumped into each other outside that cafe.

Mao:
It's him.

Kurasawa:
You've been following me. Why? Is it the cat?

Ukiyama:
Like I said. My jacket...

Kurasawa:
That's it. I'm getting close to the truth.
You don't want me to solve this case.
[That about summed it up?]

Ukiyama:
What case?

Kurasawa:
Don't play dumb with me, pal. You know what I mean.

Ukiyama:
No, I do not know. Who the hell are you? Are you a contractor?

Kurasawa:
Contract. You mean there was a contract to knock off the first wife?

Ukiyama:
Look, I don't know what you're talking about and I don't care.
Like I said. I just came to get my jacket back.

Kurasawa(Ukiyama):
This guy's body is a wreck. Smells like xxx. xxx.

Mao:
He's taken over the detective's body.

Kurasawa(Ukiyama):
This could've been avoided if you'd just given me the jacket.
Stop it! Come back here!

Mao:
I think the item you killed for is in this jacket, isn't it?
You should be more careful.
Hard to control an unfamiliar body.

Kurasawa(Ukiyama):
A talking bird. Ah, I get you. You're that cat from before.
If you were just that bird. You're like me.

Mao:
Don't flatter yourself.

Kurasawa(Ukiyama):
And you lost yours as well. Like I did.

Mao:
What?

Kurasawa(Ukiyama):
Your real body...

Mao:
No, no! Please!
Hei!

Kurasawa(Ukiyama):
So this guy is your partner, huh?

Mao:
Don't let him make eye contact!
If he can't see you, he can't use his power!


Mao:
No! Not this again! Come on!
Hei, I'm going under! Get down here quick! Help!



Kiko:
Boss, you're totally crazy pants.
What were you doing, swimming in the storm after midnight.

Kurasawa:
I have no idea.

Kiko:
You were probably sticking your big beak where it doesn't belong.
And I'm bet you gotta hit on the head for it.

Kurasawa:
I hate seeing you so broken up over me.
So, miss flatty flat chest, have you found our lady's missing cat yet?

Kiko:
Would you please stop with the sexual harassment?
No cat but that trash house sounded interesting, so I went spinning couple of hours looking around the crowns.

Kurasawa:
You checked it out on your own, huh, where you got some balls.
Well, at least they're big.


Kiko:
Keep it up, I swear I'll sue.
Anyway, while I was out I heard a very odd story around the neighborhood.
Apparently your girl's friend plays a big role in it. The hottie widow.

Kurasawa:
What role?



Kurasawa:
That's the government for you.
It only took five months to start clean.
What is that?

Mao:
This from Huang?

Yin:
Mm-hmm.

Hei:
This is the guy I encountered.
What do you think, Mao? Mao, listen.

Mao:
What? Sorry. I was busy downloading the data pack from the network.

Hei:
What are you talking about?

Mao:
You don't know about that.
I interface with the server that helps make up what cat's brain lacks.
If I don't do this semi-regularly the feline brain will take over.
Like earlier when I got lost in the trash house.
That's our man.

Yin:
Norio Ukiyama. He can control gravity.

Hei:
Gravity? I thought he could swap bodies.

Yin:
I don't know. Ukiyama used to operate out of northern India.
His partner was Amitabh Kapoor, contractor, possession [and those].

Mao:
I get it.

Hei:
Kapoor...

Mao:
I believe Kapoor took over Ukiyama's body. But while swap, Kapoor's original body suffered some kind of accident that's trapping Kapoor and Ukiyama forever.
It's a story I'm quite familiar with, [would you might imagine]?



Kurasawa:
According to the police report Toshiko suffered from rather severe hard condition.

The widow:
I had no idea.

Kurasawa:
She could've had some chest pain while walking past that house's old stair rail.
She leans against it, it breaks, and she falls to a death.
I'm pretty confident that the cops are gonna rule it an accident. But...

The widow:
What?
You think I had something to do with her falling off that railing, don't you?
I'm sure it was an accident.

Kurasawa:
Are you positive about that? You told me to search that house no matter what. Even if I had to break in. Why?

The widow:
She may have taken the ca...

Kurasawa:
There's no way Toshiko stole your cat and we both know it.
There's an old cat superstition.
It says you can keep them away if you leave bottles of water in front of your house.
If this lady hated cats enough to put out water bottles, do you think she'd steal your cat just to piss you off?
You've been looking for someone to go to that house and find the body for months, haven't you?
I report it to the police and since I'm the guy who found it I look suspicious, end up taking the fall for you.
But I'm afraid that won't work.
There are people, witnesses who say they saw you hanging around there about six months ago.
Interesting is that's around the time the cops believe she fell and died.
On top of that, you're the only one with a clear motive.
You murdered her out of jealousy. Just admit it.

The widow:
You don't have any proof.

Kurasawa:
No, I do not. But I have my gut feeling.
Madam, I suggest you turn yourself in.
I'm sorry. But it's the only way.
What are you laughing about?

The widow:
Of course, you don't have any proof, detective.
I couldn't go over there and kill someone if they were already dead.
It's true I went to Toshiko's house six months ago.
I'd heard the rumors about her falling into depression and her house filling with garbage. I had to see it.

Kurasawa:
Why would you do that?

The widow:
It was the house Yuzuki had lived in since he was a child.
I just couldn't bear the idea of it becoming dishonored like that.
The house was in even worse shape than I imagined.
I wanted to yell at her for causing such a disgrace.
Maybe she can't hear me.
But believe me, detective. I didn't send you over there to flame you.
Her body had just gone unnoticed so long.
I thought it was time the authority finally found out about her death.
The image of her lying there was haunting me.

Kurasawa:
Flame job or not, the fact of the matter is you still used me.

The widow:
I apologize for that.

Kurasawa:
I still don't get why you didn't just report this when you first found her.

The widow:
At the time, I didn't think I could take dealing with the police.
No, wait. That's not right. I think I felt that way initially, but then...

Hei:
Are you the one who called me here?

The widow:
Thinking of that body rotting there... I liked that her scent which Yuzuki loved dearly could now turn into something so disgusting.
I began to think it fitting that she decompose right there alongside her stinking garbage.

Kurasawa:
Why were you so hateful?
Think about it. None of this is justified.
You stole Yuzuki away from her, you broke her heart and she had complete nervous breakdown.
That more than explains her holding garbage.
She lost her mind and her life all because of your selfish desires.

The widow:
She never lost the one thing I never had.
Yuzuki, you see, liked to use all his senses during out love making.
His sight, his touch, his taste.
If those were his only senses she would have stood no chance against my youth.
Not without old body.
But, no. Yuzuki was forever obsessed with... smell.

Kurasawa:
Smell?

The widow:
His fetish for scent dominated everything.
He would sniff... sniff every inch of my body deep into the night.
His nose's desire was never satisfied.
As if he were searching for something I did not possess.
The scent he would always last for, the scent he would always love, was not my own.

Ukiyama:
All it ever does is rain here.
Hand over the item so I can leave.

Hei:
No, I'm afraid I have something else in mind.

Ukiyama:
Why are you here?

Mao:
Did you kill him?

The widow:
But... do you know what's odd?
Even though Yuzuki hated my scent I began to appreciate it as a part of my identity.
You might even say that... that we're all defined by our body's natural fragrances.
I was his attractive young wife, yes.
But the one thing I could not change... my scent.
Meant that I was never going to be the woman he truly wanted.

Hei:
What are these?

Mao:
Samples stolen by spies.
He's been trying to recover them one by one.
My suspicion is they have something to do with the Gate.

Huang:
Give them here.

Hei:
Let's go, Mao. Mao?

Mao:
He was trying to sniff a tube sock.

Hei:
It was his payment.

Mao:
But he never had a chance to use his powers against you.

Hei:
So, what are you saying?

Huang:
He probably just liked the smell of all sweaty socks.
Who knows how contractors think? What are creepy wills.

Mao:
Huang's right. This contractor, he was fixated on the way it smelled.
What if this sock was an article of clothing from his original body?
After years this sock's residual smell would be only the connection he had left to his true self.
He had no price left to pay.
Upon losing his real body in that accident years ago, this contractor's payment was complete. The same as with me.



Kurasawa:
Damn, more rain.

Estuko:
Sir, wait.

Kurasawa:
What is it now?
Thank you.



Girl:
See you later, Rika!

Rika:
Bye!
Hernandez? What are you doing here? Oh, you're not him.
Here, kitty. Wait! Don't go!
Kitty, you dropped your collar. "Miko."

Kurasawa:
I never found the cat. Probably because it never existed.
Now that I know the real story. I'm pretty sure the widow made up the whole thing to get Toshiko found and her conscience clean.
So, the search for the made-up cat, like that husband's nose, went deeper than I expected. But I got paid. And that's all that matters.

Kiko:
I saw him again at the noodle place!
He must've eaten 17 bowls of ramen and it was so adorable!
I think I should stalk him. I really wanna stalk him.
Do you have any good stalking tips for me?

Kurasawa:
Get bigger boobs.
Since then, I've seen Kiko's crush around town.
He doesn't bother anyone. He just eats a lot.
Why was I so suspicious?
Oh, well. Unlike [him], maybe I can't trust my gut all the time.

Hei:
Mao, Huang wants us.

Mao:
I hate being woken up in the middle of a good dream.

Hei:
So cats have dreams. I never thought about it.

Mao:
Of course I do.
They're mostly about trivial stuff when I was a man.
Bathing, eating at a table, it's all very present but not exactly exciting.
At least no one ever complains when they see me sleeping away the afternoons in the park.
It's the best reason I can think of for jumping into a cat.
Well, that and the delicious xxx.
Relax. I was joking. It was funny, huh?
