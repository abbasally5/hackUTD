Corinna:
Do you think it's true? That urban legend, I mean.
You know the one, that was in the Gate you can regain whatever it is you've lost if you're willing to pay the price in return.
What is the price, I wonder?

Hei:
Well...

Corinna:
You don't believe a word of it, do you?
Neither do I.
Moku Corinna. I'm a student in college.

Hei:
I'm Li Shengshun.

Corinna:
Nice to meet you.
It's a lot bigger than I imagined.



Huang:
You're to infiltrate the PANDORA research facility.

Mao:
You can't really be serious.
That place is right next to the Gate.
When a Contractor gets that close to a hotspot, there's a risk they won't be able to keep their powers under control.

Huang:
So I've heard but that's the job.

Mao:
In any event I doubt he'd be able to get past the first security check point.

Huang:
Maybe. But the Syndicate is serious.

Hei:
And what do they want me to do when I'm in?

Huang:
Recovery.

Mao:
Recover what?

Huang:
There was an explosion in the facility two weeks ago.
Two guards died when they were caught in the blast.
PANDORA launched an internal investigation and decided that the whole thing was caused by a short in electrical system.
But a few days ago, a spy embedded by the CIA determined that the explosion was deliberate, part of an attempt to steal something called the "Meteor Shard."
An artifact recovered from inside the Gate itself.

Mao:
And whoever did it still hasn't brought this thing outside the Wall?

Huang:
That's what the Syndicate thinks.

Hei:
What do I do once I recover it?

Huang:
You smuggle it outside the Wall and we deliver it to the Syndicate.
Don't worry about a thing.
All you have to do is keep your head down and follow your orders. Just like always.



Doctor:
Do you think of yourself as the patient type?

Hei:
No, sir.

Doctor:
Have you ever seen a UFO?

Hei:
No.

Doctor:
Do you believe in the existence of God?

Hei:
No.

Doctor:
Do you know about the Contractors?

Hei:
No, sir.

Hei:
Excuse me, is something wrong?

Corinna:
No, nothing.

Hei:
Are you sure you're...

Corinna:
I told you it was nothing, damn it!

Hei:
Look, I'm sorry.

Kirk:
What's going on?

Corinna:
It's nothing. Thanks. I'm fine.

Guard:
Next!

Kirk:
You're gonna have to come with us.

Corinna:
No! No! Let me go! Stop it, please!

Kirk:
Take her back to the check point.

Guard:
Next!

Hei:
Ah, right.



Kikuchi:
It's not unusual to see ghosts or phantoms around here.
Things will suddenly vanish then reappear at random somewhere else.
Auditory hallucinations are everyday occurrence.
If you let stuff like this gets to you, you're never gonna be able to do your job.
You're just gonna have to adjust.
Some of the best scientific minds in the world are gathered here, working day and night to shed some kind of light on this phenomena.
But they're depending on us for support.
It's up to us, an janitorial services to provide them with the spotless clean environment for their work.
That is no easy task. Nevertheless, you might as well make up your mind to do your best because there's no way you're gonna be allowed outta here for the next 30 days, even if you drop dead.
Do I make myself clear!?

Cleaning guys:
Yes, sir!

Kikuchi:
This is research block 3.
It's the most important area under [out/our] supervision so we need to take special care.
This is one of the busiest blocks in the facility so we usually wait and clean it at night.
Are you paying attention?

Hei:
Ah, yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

Kikuchi:
That's the only room on the block we don't have to clean.

Hei:
Why is that, sir?

Kikuchi:
'cause the guy who's in charge is an obsessive nitpicker.

Sergei:
Excuse me?

Kikuchi:
Section Chief Sergei!
Out of the way, fool!
Why don't you watch where you're standing, you clumsy oaf!
I'm so sorry, madam.
Don't stand there like a post! Help her with her stuff!

Hei:
Yes, sir.

Sergei:
I'll meet you inside.

Meena:
Oh, of course!

Kikuchi:
Gimme that.
Again, I'm very sorry. You didn't hurt yourself, did you?

Meena:
No. Thank you.

Hei:
I'm sorry.

Kikuchi:
Moving on.



Hei:
How did you know it was me?

Meena:
I received a message that you're going to be posted to the janitorial department.

Hei:
Are there any other members of the Syndicate here?

Meena:
There are. But I haven't met any of them during my time here.

Hei:
I see.

Meena:
Listen. There's something I need to tell you right away.
Please don't expect anything from me.
I only cooperate with the Syndicate so I could conduct research here.
This is my first time doing anything like this.
I didn't hear from them for two years and now all of a sudden...

Hei:
You can relax. I won't depend on you.
However, I would like to know more about the "Meteor Shard."

Meena:
So just what exactly?

Hei:
Just tell me everything you know.

Meena:
Honestly, I really don't know anything specific about it at all.
But I do know this, they found a similar object at the South American site before it disappeared.
The preliminary research suggested it might prove useful on answering some of the questions surrounding the Gate.
But still, why the CIA would put so much trouble to steal it?
I haven't got the slightest idea. Of course that really isn't my job now, is it?
I have to be going. If there's anything else I will find a way to contact you.
Oh, and one more thing. My name, it's Meena Kandaswamy, if you want to know. Nice to meet you.
And about the patch on your neck, there's no need for you to wear it.
There's really no way to tell a Contractor from a regular human being.



Nick:
Don't touch that, please.
The experiment is still running.
They were supposed to tell you guys that there's no need for you to clean up in this area.

Hei:
Yeah, sorry. It's just that I used to have a telescope exactly like this one.

Nick:
You got a Satake. So you're stargazer too.

Hei:
I was, before the real stars disappeared.

Nick:
What's your name?

Hei:
It's Li Shengshun.

Nick:
It's nice to meet you.

Hei:
Likewise.

Nick:
So, tell me, Li. How would you like to come with me and see the real stars?



Nick:
Satake got into the telescope market pretty late in the game.
But they carved out a niche by offering inexpensive high performance lenses.
Though with the ML-800 here, the trade-off was a rather limited focal ratio.
Did you use a Barlow lense?

Hei:
I wish. The ones they're compatible were way too expensive for me.

Nick:
I see. Well, after ten years your wish is about to come true.

Hei:
Um... Just what are you going to do?

Nick:
What is it like I'm doing? I'm going to look at the stars.

Hei:
Yeah, but...

Nick:
Are you going to give up stargazing just because the sky is a fake?
I couldn't do it.
Ever since the sky has changed things have gone to hell.
But no matter what happens, this is one thing I'm never going to give up.
[Call it tradition.]
Have a look.

Hei:
I don't see anything.

Nick:
Try to forget everything that's happened.
Forget that the earth moon has disappeared. Forget that the rockets we've tried to send past the stratosphere have all gone missing.
Just believe. Believe in the sky. Believe it's the one we used to watch with such awe and wonder.

Hei:
Impossible! There was nothing there a minute ago!

Nick:
We're inside the Gate here. It's like they say, impossible things happen all the time.
That's the best answer I can give you right now.
It's not a very scientific theory, I know.
But one thing I am sure of, what we're witnessing is one possible future for the stars somehow slicing through the false sky.
Li, if all the people in the world were able to see what we just did, what do you think would happen?
What I think, is that the sky would come back to us. The real sky, as it was before.
You really are an honest man, aren't you?
The look on your face says you don't think that could ever happen.
Well, that's okay. But I still hope one day you'll join in our little club.
Of course, right now the only members are me and my sister.

Hei:
Your sister?

Nick:
Yeah. She's stuck in a wheel chair these days.
But someday I know, I'm going to able to take her past this false sky and into the [round of] the real stars.
Well, that's my dream at any rate.

Hei:
That dream of yours, I hope it becomes true someday.

Nick:
Yeah.



Hei:
May I sit here?
Are you all right?

Corinna:
I can see what I've lost.
I can see them standing there. They're in twos and threes.
I've decided... I'm getting out of here.

Hei:
Getting out. But that's impossible.

Corinna:
If I give it to that man, I'm sure he can.
I told you already it's none of your business!
How long are you going to stand there staring?
You're dead so leave me alone!
You have no right to say I'm betraying our country and our family.
From this moment on I'm... I'm my own person! Let me go!

Nick:
She's got it bad.
She's gonna have hard time readjusting to the real world.

Hei:
That may be. But she sure sounded determined to get out of here.

Nick:
Without waiting the month out? How?

Hei:
I don't know. She didn't go into details.

Nick:
I see. I hope she's okay.



Hei:
What happened in there? What's going on?

Cleaner:
It's that crazy girl, Corinna. They found her dead this morning.
They're saying she might have been murdered.
Appearently, the security cameras are down too.

Kirk:
You're sure about that?

Kikuchi:
Yes, sir. I saw them talking together earlier in the day.
That's him. There.

Kirk:
I understand you two were very close.
You'd be surprised how many things happen here that might normally seem impossible.
For example, it's possible that a man [like you] got romantically involved with a woman he barely knows, and kill her no apparent reason.
Who else was she associating with?
Did she say anything to you before she was murdered?

Hei:
No, nothing.

Kirk:
Keep an eye on him.

Kikuchi:
Understood.

Kirk:
I'm here. Go ahead, sir.

Corinna:
So you weren't the one who killed her?

Hei:
I had no reason to kill her.

Corinna:
Do you really need to have one?
I'm sorry but... you're a Contractor and they say...

Hei:
Is that all you wanted?
If that's all I'm leaving.

Corinna:
Um... you're not... angry, are you?
Forgive me. I-I'm surprised.
I'd always heard that Contractors had lost their feelings.
But if it wasn't you, the question remains: who killed her?
I've done it again. Oh, I'm sorry.
I know that really isn't my job but I can't seem to help...

Hei:
I don't care if you speculate about things but whatever you do, don't make any moves on your own, not if you want to continue with your research.
Is that clear?

Corinna:
Yes... it is...

Kirk:
There's no question about it.
The murdered woman was a mole xxx by the CIA.
In exchange for handing over the Meteor Shard to us, she wanted us to release her from the Gate facility.
No, I'm sorry. We have no idea where she could have hidden it.
I understand. I'll do everything in my power.

Announce:
Attention. The exploratory camera survey headed by the Sergei team is now beginning.
All personnel assigned to block 3, please report to conference room 2.

Sergei:
Within the environment of the Gate, one event can have a variety of observed outcomes that are different one for each observer.
I've gathered all of you here today so that we can collect the widest possible spread of data based on your individual observations.
We want you to tell us everything you see, you feel, as it happens. No detail...

Nick:
I heard you had a pretty rough time.

Hei:
Nick.

Nick:
I know. I went through a similar experience once.
Don't worry, Li. I'm your friend.
I know you're not the kind of person who'd kill someone.

Sergei:
It's time. Let us begin.

Meena:
[There xxx/Their body] camera probe is on the move.
The probe is about to pass through block 3 and is moving toward the city center.
No activity detected.

Sergei:
Stop there.
Can you zoom in past that car?
Well, it looks like we're going to have to redraw all the maps again.
Pull back and see if you can make it through on the west side.
You saw that?

Corinna:
Yes, sir. I did.

Sergei:
Over there.
Play that back again. In slow motion. There!

Corinna:
A synchrotron radiation field!

Nick:
Well, well. Would you look at that?

Sergei:
We found a Meteor Shard.
