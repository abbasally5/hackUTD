Saito:
Don't move!
Now, hands in the air, turn towards me, slowly.
Damn it, he's a contractor!

Saito:
Suspect's on the move, heading north east.
It's a contractor.

Otsuka:
Astronomics has confirmed activity for star GR544.
Identified as a French agent. Code name; Louis.

Kirihara:
Understood. Monitor the wind direction.
Have all units standing by to converge on his new position.

Saito:
Roger!

Kirihara:
All units, be advised.
Contractor GR544's ability is gravity nullification.
Take appropriate precautions.
Use of deadly force authorized. Shoot on sight.



Mao:
That's the price of your contract, huh?
You've got it pretty rough.

Louis:
A specter... Damn dolls!

Hei:
Where is it?

Louis:
I... don't know.

Louis:
No, it's the truth. She has it. The girl...

Hei:
Where?

Louis:
Where are you working for?
Talk to me. We can make a deal. I can help you get it from her.
Nice and easy, everyone wins.

Hei:
A very rational proposal.
I'd expect no less from a contractor.
Where is she?

Hei:
Yin, where are the police?

Yin:
They're passing point A.
Now, you have less than 3 minutes.

Mao:
Time to spare. Let's go.

Louis:
No, wait. You need me. She won't tell you where it is unless I'm with you...

Mao:
Stop. He's right, Hei. He can still be useful.

Hei:
You're all the same.
You make me sick.

Mao:
Hei!



Saito:
Chief! A star just fell.

Kirihara:
I know. I saw it.
It's been ten years since it happened. The incident.
Hard to remember now that the city wasn't always like this. That "it" wasn't always here.
What it is, where it came from, why it came... No one knows.
The greatest minds from around the world were brought in to study it.
Their solution? Build a wall. They called it "Hell's Gate."
They say the first sightings of individuals with super human powers, called "contractors," and passive mediums, called "dolls," came only days after the Gate appeared.



Saito:
This was a guy. Code name, Louis. Real name, unknown.
Suspected ties to the French Directorate General for External Security.
Known contractor. Messier code - GR544. Ability - gravity nullification.

Matsumoto:
Not surprisingly, the French authorities are currently denying any involvement.

Hourai:
Cause of death?

Kono:
We don't know.
The medical examiner found nothing. Just a couple of broken fingers.

Saito:
There's a possibility of another contractor.

Otsuka:
I have the latest state from astronomics.
It seems they've identified the most likely candidate for the activity at the time is star number BK201.
That number has yet to be assigned.

Hourai:
You're sure?

Otsuka:
Yes. If it does belong to a contractor, we don't know the first thing about him.
What he looks like, the abilities he has, we're completely in the dark on this one.

Kono:
Maybe it's him. The one we keep hearing all the rumors about. The reaper.

Kirihara:
Our concern is facts, not rumors.
It won't do us any good have you spreading them here.

Kono:
Right. Sorry.

Kirihara:
Now, what about the item?

Matsumoto:
Someone from the national laboratory was able to gain access to the Pandora core and made off with the cache of classified information.
As for the content, well... They say that's need to know and apparently we don't.

Kirihara:
And the woman?

Saito:
Chiaki Shinoda, 26, recent doctor graduate, earned her degree with the thesis on various physical phenomenon within the Gate.
Took a research position at the national laboratories.
She's been way off the past 2 weeks. Current whereabouts - unknown.

Kirihara:
According to this, she's had at least one encounter with contractors in the past.
I assume ME was used to erase the memories.

Saito:
You mean the incident with her parents.
No. At the time it was determined she hadn't had any direct contact.

Hourai:
Any potential leak of information regarding the Gate is a serious threat to the national security.
Whatever this woman's level of involvement, she must not fall into enemy hands.
No matter what. Understood?

Kirihara:
Sir.



Kirihara:
The government tries to keep the existence of contractors secret from the general public.
As a matter of protocol, any civilian who comes into direct contact has their memories erased.
Still, there's no stopping the rumors.
Monsters, killer robots, people can sense something's out there.
Something they don't understand, maybe that's what's scares them the most.
My name is Mizuki Kirihara, public security division foreign affairs section 4.
This case will be the first encounter between my team and the contractor known as BK201.



Misuzu:
What is it? Delivery?

Hei:
No, I'm...

Misuzu:
One of them God freaks!
We don't need save yet.

Hei:
No, I'm not...

Misuzu:
You must be that noisy tombstone salesman!
I told you when I need one, I call you!

Hei:
No, that's not it.
I'm actually here about the...

Misuzu:
Oh, yeah. You're here for the TV. Why didn't you say so?
Now, time you'd show up. Come on in!

Misuzu:
It's been nothing but fogs for a couple of days now.

Hei:
Right. Listen...

Misuzu:
Don't stand in the door, you fat! You blocked reception!
At the store you guys said, once we switched to this digital-whatever-it-is, there'd be no more static, right?

Hei:
Sorry. It wasn't me.

Misuzu:
How's that gonna fix it? You even know what you're doing!?

Hei:
No, I guess I don't.
There. How's that?

Misuzu:
But, ah-oh...



Misuzu:
So here we are. Ah, sorry, what was your name again?

Hei:
Li Shengshun.

Misuzu:
All right. I remember you're the kid the realtor called about.
New to the city, huh?

Hei:
That's right. I'm here for school.

Misuzu:
Well, I know you kids like to have a good time when you're not studying.
I don't mind a little party.
Just don't go start any trouble, got me?

Hei:
Right.

Misuzu:
Miss Haraguchi! I'd like to introduce you to your new neighbor, Mr... help me out, kid.

Hei:
It's Li Shengshun.

Misuzu:
Mr. Li... whatever.
Hey, you're not gonna turned out to be some kinda stalker, are you?

Hei:
No, ma'am.

Mao:
He's in. Target acquired.

Huang:
Our black reaper has earned his mark.
Let's see how good he really is.



Kono:
So, ayami, tell us about yourself.
What do you like, 18? 19?

Chiaki:
Oh, c'mon! I'm almost 22.
Seriously, my birthday is next week.
You're gonna come celebrate with me, right?
Yeah, you and your friend should both come!

Saito:
Sure. That sounds great.

Girl A:
So, tell me. What kind of work do you do?

Saito:
No, it's not very interesting.

Chiaki:
Something in finance? Accountants, maybe?

Kono:
No, not even close.

Girl A:
Lawyers?

Kono:
Nah, that's funny. Think the opposite of that.

Chiaki:
All right, like you're gangsters or something?

Saito:
No. We work for the city, miss.

Chiaki:
Oh, gotcha!
I guess that would be pretty boring [xxx like] undercover cops, right?

Clerk:
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I'm afraid their time is up.

Girl A:
Well, bye. Ask for me next time you come in.

Chiaki:
Next week. Don't forget.

Kono:
Not a chance.
That one in a red dress look kinda like her, what do you think?

Saito:
Not [a/the] same build, I guess. [With] hair and makeup... I don't know.

Saito:
What are we even doing here, seriously?

Kono:
We're looking for leads, right? Don't worry about it. We'll get a receipt.

Saito:
Are you out of your mind? If the chief finds out...

Girl B&C:
Good evening, gentlemen.

Saito:
Hey, wait!

Clerk:
Sir. Take your seat. If you're harassing one of our girls, I will call the police.

Saito:
What? I'm the police. Now, move it!

Saito:
Hold it!

Hei:
Are they chasing you?
Here, quick.

Chiaki:
No, I have to go...

Hei:
Just be quiet.

Chiaki:
But... I...

Hei:
Sorry, about that!

Chiaki:
You were looking at the stars?

Hei:
Yes.

Chiaki:
In the middle of the city?

Hei:
Uh-huh.

Chiaki:
But you know they're all fake, right?
The real stars aren't there anymore.
Say, um... Have we met somewhere?

Hei:
Miss Haraguchi?
That is your name, isn't it?
From apartment 202. I'm Li, we met this morning.
Remember your new neighbor.

Chiaki:
Sorry, I have to go.
Thanks a lot.

Hei:
Hang on!



Jean:
Chiaki, it's me. It's Jean.

Chiaki:
Jean!

Jean:
Thank goodness, you're safe.

Chiaki:
What? What's going on? Where's Louis?

Jean:
Be quiet. Louis got himself into something. He couldn't make it.
He sent me instead.
Who are those men?

Chiaki:
Police, I think.
They just showed up at the club.

Jean:
So they're already onto us.
Was it just them? Did you see anyone? Talk to anyone else?

Chiaki:
So, where's Louis now?

Jean:
He's somewhere safe.
He's gonna keep his head down for a few days.
He said it's time to move the stuff. Where is it?

Chiaki:
He said that? I don't understand.
He told me never to talk about that with anyone, not even with our friends.
Take me to see him! I know it's risky, but, please!
You...!

Hei:
What happened? You're all right?

Chiaki:
Hurry! Run! Get out of here!

Hei:
What about...?

Chiaki:
Just go!
Synchrotron radiation... but that's...

Chiaki:
You're a contractor...



Jean:
No need to rush or make a mess of things.
It's like with these stones here.
The design seems simple, but each piece has to be carefully placed.
One careless mistake and it's ruined.
It's a useful lesson, though, truth is I have no idea why I do this, the significance of it...
I stop trying to find the meaning a long time ago.
It's the price I pay for my contract.
There.
Louis's dead.

Chiaki:
That's a lie.

Jean:
Not this time.
Louis is dead. Someone killed him.
Unfortunately, as far as contractors go, Louis was one of the best.
Seems he met someone better.

Chiaki:
Wait. You're saying... Louis was a contractor?

Jean:
I see. So, he decided to keep that from you, too.
Who is that man in the alley?
I don't particularly enjoy being clubbed in the back of the head.
But he learned that the hard way, didn't he?
I got the sense you two knew each other.

Chiaki:
What? No, no. I just met him today.

Jean:
Unlucky for him.
In any case, time is short.
You'll understand if I make this quick.
Now why would you run?
That hurts me, Chiaki. I thought we were friends.
Contractors have feelings, too.
We're not human, but that doesn't mean we're entirely without personality.
We're not dolls.
What is it?

Paul:
We're being watched.

Alain:
What?
No way. That's impossible.

Jean:
Not for a doll.
A specter, only a contractor would see it.

Alain:
Hold it!

Alain:
I don't get it.
Those locks were state-of-the-art. They shouldn't just short out like that.

Jean:
You're right.
Hard to imagine that it was a coincidence.



The rain(s) stops. The clouds part. But the only lights that shine through are false stars. Tender words thaw a long-frozen heart. The woman steps out from her shell into the endless night. Darker than black. The man searches the false skies, hoping for a sign. For an instant, he sees it, the dying glow of a life burning itself out. And then, the star falls.
