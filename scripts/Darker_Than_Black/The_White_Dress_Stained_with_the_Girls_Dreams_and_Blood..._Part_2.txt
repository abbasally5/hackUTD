Alice:
Misaki, you eat way too much greasy food. You know it's not good for you, right?

Kirihara:
Well, it tastes great and I'm hungry.

Alice:
You're gonna ruin your figure.

Kirihara:
I burn calories walking everywhere. I'll be fine!

Alice:
Kanami, what are you working on over there?

Kirihara:
Oh, career survey, huh?

Kanami:
I'm done with this thing?
I'm still young. I have no idea what career I want.

Kirihara:
You gotta have some idea.

Kanami:
There's a lot of parting to be done before I start a career.
Right now, I'm all about fun.
Oh, thanks, Misaki. It's easy to cast judgment. You've got your career all picked out.

Alice:
What?

Kanami:
Oh, yeah. She told me that after college she's joining the police force.

Alice:
Is this true?

Kirihara:
Kanami.

Kanami:
Yep. Following daddy's footsteps.

Kirihara:
Kanami, that's not the reason.

Kanami:
Are you sure?

Kirihara:
Okay, maybe my dad has a little bit to do with my decision.
But, trust me, I have my own reasons.

Kanami:
Like what?

Kirihara:
I see victims. People who are played on by others.
Criminals who take pleasure in attacking the weak and poor.
I wanna help those who aren't able to help themselves.
Joining the police force is the only way.

Kanami:
Sorry, Misaki, but your little speech there was boring.
Still I can't think of better job for you. Goody-goody.

Kirihara:
C'mon! That's not fair! I was answering your question!

Kanami:
Wait! Stop it! Those are mine! Give 'em back to me!

Kirihara:
Sorry I already ate them all.

Kanami:
You eat too much. You know that?

Kirihara:
Give me another one.

Kanami:
No. You don't!



Alice:
Hasn't today been just wonderful?
Misaki, don't you agree that things have never been better?
Don't hide, Misaki. Come out of the shadows and celebrate your old friend Alice.

Kirihara:
Don't scream. What are you doing up here?

Hei:
Sorry, ma'am. The catering manager told me to bring something to drink up to the owner.
When I got here...
This is bad... I don't wanna end up like that. C'mon, let's go.

Kirihara:
I'm afraid it's not that easy.

Alice:
The bees help ease my pain though some feelings are very deep they refuse to go away. But tonight, even those feelings vanish for good.
Everything that has made my life into a prison.
The Qing Long Tong, my dear dead father, everything wiped clean.

Captain C:
Why, Wei? You, monster!

Alice:
Because Wei understands my means. He's helping to set me free.
He's more supportive than any friends, or father.
What a day. I'm glad you're here for this, Misaki.
It was fate bumping into you tonight of all nights.
I couldn't have asked for more perfect birthday.

Kirihara:
When I give the signal, you start running.

Alice:
I have an idea for a gift you can get me.
You can come out and die and set my soul free.
Where are you, Misaki?

Kirihara:
Go! Now!

Alice:
I will find you. Misaki.

Hei:
Excuse me, but who are you, ma'am?

Kirihara:
Police.

Hei:
But I thought you were Miss Wang's friend, aren't you?
What should we do now?

Kirihara:
Well, I think the first thing we should do is try to find a way out of this building.

Security:
Sorry for the inconvenience. Ladies and gentlemen, just be patient.
Go back and enjoy the party.

Kirihara:
So much for plan A. They're not letting anyone down.

Hei:
I know where there's an emergency staircase.

Kirihara:
I'm guessing that's the first thing they might've sealed off.

Alice:
No one gets in or out until I say otherwise. No one.

Wei:
Yes? I understand.

Wei:
The board meeting has ended, gentlemen. Now please put the room back in order.

Security:
Sir.

Hei:
Uh, ma'am? Do you have a plan for our next move?

Kirihara:
Give me time. I'm thinking about it.

Hei:
All right.

Kirihara:
Wait a sec. Do you have a cell phone?

Hei:
No. You can get fired if you're caught using one during work hours. I'm sorry.
Power outage. But I think it would be okay. I'm pretty sure the hotel has its own generator for backup.
See?

Kirihara:
They're cutting off the hotel from the power grid to stop a bleach by our spectors.

Hei:
What are spectors?

Kirihara:
It's nothing.
Why is she doing this?

Hei:
I don't know.

Kirihara:
Alice is tearing this building [up/apart] just to kill me.
She was my friend. What happened?

Hei:
She betrayed you, huh? That's rough.

Kirihara:
What would you know about it?

Hei:
I'm sorry.

Kirihara:
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

Hei:
I just meant... it must be hard having someone turn on you like that. Someone you trusted.

Kirihara:
It seems odd to talk about these serious things in a bathroom.

Hei:
You're right, ma'am.

Kirihara:
Don't call me ma'am. 'kay?

Hei:
Yeah, I guess we're past that, aren't we?

Kirihara:
You know, she never saw your face. There's no reason for you to hide in here especially if it's only going to put you in danger.
You mean you haven't realized that?
Hold on. What if... Go out into the hall and bring Saito in here for me.
When you're done, go back to work, act normal, lay low and you'll be fine. Okay?

Hei:
I can do that.
My name is Li Shengshun. It's nice to meet you. I didn't catch your name.

Kirihara:
Misaki Kirihara. I can't believe I'm introducing myself on a toilet.

Hei:
Me, neither.

Kanami:
What? Misaki is in the hotel? What is she doing in there?
Before that building went off the grid and shut our surveillance spectors we registered a contractor using his abilities. It's VI-952. He's inside and still active. We have to get her out of there now!

Matsumoto:
That's what we're trying to do. She's not answer your cell so whatever's going down on there is already started.

Policeman:
Recon here. No reports of any injuries inside. We're gonna need a warrant to start kicking down doors.

Matsumoto:
So get one, damn it! There's not much time!

Saito:
Chief, you wanna talk like this?

Kirihara:
Don't be a baby. Get in here.

Saito:
Okay.

Alice:
Oh, Wei. Will you go find Misaki for me? I need her dead. So I can be free.

Wei:
I'll bring her to you. There's no way she can escape. She's trapped now. And all alone.

Alice:
No. Not quite. She's not alone. There was a man with her.

Wei:
I'll find them.



Kirihara:
Saito, isn't there a better way to get me out of here?

Saito:
You wanted to move around without being seen, right?
The laundry is down in the basement. I'll roll you there and you can escape through one of the service tunnels.
Oh, Chief, whole building is acting crazy. You wanna fill me in on what happened?

Kirihara:
I'll explain everything later.

Saito:
All right. So, Li, you wanna tell me what the heck is going on?

Kirihara:
What's wrong?

Saito:
Ah... Nothing...



Wei:
Ah, so you have come. Were you trying to use that police woman as a distraction?
That was foolish. I don't know who you're working for but they've sent you to your death.
Of course, I'll need you to return that.
Oh, the blood? No need to worry. Cutting myself is the price I pay for my contract.
I don't even feel it anymore. Now, let's get started!
Don't tell me you're done. I'm beginning to enjoy this.
I've heard the rumors. About highly skilled contractor with the power to control electricity. It's you, BK-201, isn't it?
You let me close in on you. Luring me so I would drop my guard.
But you couldn't finish the job. You're fast. But unfortunately for you, I'm faster.



Manager:
Saito, roll it here.

Saito:
Oh, ah, well...

Kirihara:
Don't panic. Act normal. Don't draw any attention.

Saito:
Right.

Manager:
I need you to clear this room.

Saito:
Got it.
Wait, are you sure? There aren't any tables in here.

Alice:
Would you look at that? You're so resourceful.

Kirihara:
Alice, no! Please, I can help you!

Alice:
I don't need you anymore. Today is the day I destroy everything that has held me back for so many years.
It's been said the Qing Long Tang believe blood to be the most important currency.
I inherit the blood of my father, Wang Shaotang, making me richer than any captain or potential leader of this criminal empire and this mere accident of birth determine my future are foreign concept to you I'm sure.
No matter my own dreams or even outside events like Hell's Gate, my blood would always lock into his word.
Now Wang Shaotang is dead and the Qing Long Tang has been wiped out with him.
All thanks to my Wei Zhijun.

Saito:
Chief, who's he?

Kirihara:
VI-952.
Saito.

Alice:
Now is the time, Wei. You may set your mistress free.

Wei:
Now you shall be free, mistress.

Kirihara:
Alice! No!

Alice:
Wei...

Wei:
You never desired true freedom and independence, Alice.
You enjoyed being controlled by others and you only sought to replace one dominate personality with another.

Alice:
That's wrong.

Wei:
If it wasn't your father it was Misaki. And it was no longer xxx became me.
You wouldn't know how to live without someone telling you what to do at every turn.
Death is the only freedom I can give you.

Kirihara:
Alice! Alice, no. Alice...

Wei:
You bear responsibility for this too.
You sent Alice on this death spiral when you first met and revealed your strong personality.
It was xxx forcefulness her father's.

Kirihara:
That's insane.

Wei:
You were unimpressed by her father's position and scoffed at her station of birth.
You were the first and only person whoever stood up to Alice in this manner.

Kirihara:
Oh, save it. Your father's got nothing to do with this.

Wei:
And so she turned to you for guidance. The same way she relied on her father.
But you became a cop. Putting you at odds with her.
She became lost. Spent the rest of her life trying to find the control you once both provided.

Kirihara:
Alice...

Saito:
Watch out!

Kirihara:
Are you okay?

Wei:
And now you die.

Kirihara:
It's him. BK-201.

Wei:
I thought that you were dead.
It was your own blood on your mask. You put it there in a split second.

Hei:
Unfortunately for you, I'm faster.

Kirihara:
Stop!



Huang:
Wei Zhijun decapitated the Qing Long Tang leadership so we can have the entire cartel under his control.
He slaughtered Wong and his captains. Even the pretty daughter Alice got killed.
The guy's a completely sicko.

Mao:
And worst of all, he was trying to set up Hei is the man responsible for the bloodbath.

Huang:
We might not be done. There are rumors that Wei's body vanished from the morgue early this morning.

Mao:
I'm not surprised. I checked. His star hasn't fallen yet.

Hei:
Now, the mission's over.



Kirihara:
Let's say, I never joined the force, never drifted away.
Do you think I could've saved Alice?

Kanami:
I don't think so. Her problems went deeper than that. Deeper than your line of work.
I mean, can you even imagine not becoming the police officer, Misaki?

Kirihara:
Kanami, since when do you smoke?

Kanami:
What can I say? I might not look at it but I guess deep down I'm one of those weak people who needs a little crutch to help me get through the day.
I know that a lot of people look to you for guidance and help.
But still you kinda bring some of that on yourself by always trying to be everything to all people.
Look, if that makes you feel any better, I don't know what I do if you didn't come running whenever I needed help.

Kirihara:
Thanks for that.
Still, do me a favor. Please don't smoke by me. I don't want you stinking up my cloth.

Naoyasu:
You're turning down the promotion?

Kirihara:
Yes.

Naoyasu:
And your reason for this is what now?

Kirihara:
The incident at the hotel. I was [inadequate/ill-equipped] to deal with the situation.
It's clear I'm not ready to lead a division.
I was the only one who might have prevented the death of Alice Wong.
She depended on me and I failed.

Naoyasu:
You're aware that if you refuse this position your chances for advancement are slim at least for a few years.

Kirihara:
I accept that.

Naoyasu:
Okay. In that case, Chief Kirihara, you're dismissed.

Kirihara:
Sir!

Saito:
So, Chief. Something happened in there?

Kirihara:
Why do you ask?

Saito:
Just a hunch.

Kirihara:
Is that really any of your business?

Saito:
No! Sorry, ma'am.

Kirihara:
I'm glad I can depend on you.

Saito:
Ah, did you say something, Chief?

Kirihara:
No. Nothing.
