Mob boss:
You come alone?

November 11:
I'm a man of my word.
That's what makes me so good at business.

Mob boss:
New step makes you prudent.
I'd like to skip the acting like we're friends part and move to the deal.
That'd work for you?

November 11:
On one condition.
You do me the favor of not lighting up those cigarettes while I'm here.
Secondhand smoke kills, you know?
It's far worse than the fumes you inhale directly.
Take dimethy nitrosamine, one of those nasty carcinogens your doctor might have warned you about on your last visit.
First time smoke is between 5.3 and 43 nanograms but in secondhand smoke, it's between 680 and 823.
Then we've got quinoline, another effective one. Secondhand smoke is 18,000, 11 times more than the amount you're sucking down firsthand.
You can make the choice to black your lungs for a buzz.
But don't expect to force that on me. After all, we're not even friends.

Henchman 2:
If you're that worried you can hold your breath.

November 11:
Let's just forget I came by.

Mob boss:
Wait.
You, deaf?
Open it.

November 11:
Think of this as a show of good faith.
After you bring me a little acquisition and I ensure there'd be no mistake, you'll receive two more brief cases just like this.

Mob boss:
Then what do you plan to do with this acquisition, Mr. Smith?

November 11:
Well, to start, I thought I walk through the doors of a rival company and kill 3,000 of their best men.
Kidding.
Actually I'll just resell it.

Henchman 2:
[I'm/We're] getting tired of your stupid jokes!

Mob boss:
As a man of his word, do you really think it's that valuable?

November 11:
Unquestionably.

Mob boss:
I'm sorry, but the deal is off.

November 11:
And why is that?

Henchman 1:
When boss says [it's] off, it's off, and you walk away.

November 11:
Doesn't seem very business friendly.

Henchman 1:
I said walk.
Oh my god! Oh, help! Oh, help! Oh, help!

Mob boss:
What did he do to your arm!?
You... I know you're kind, damn it! You're a contractor.
No! Get back!
You, monster, I'll kill you!

Mob boss:
My legs! What did you do... Damn it!
Stay back! I swear, I'll shoot you!

November 11:
I want the location.

Mob boss:
All right, I'll talk! Go to 2220, Tito Street.
Keep on your money. I don't care. Please, just don't kill me.

November 11:
Please this makes you prudent.

April:
Your payment really is a disgusting habit, 11.

November 11:
Charming.
Let's go.



November 11:
So, this is the famous Havoc.
I have some good news.
For the next few months, you'll be working with us in our associates.
Starting from your right, that's April, July, and I, of course, November 11 at your service. We're agents for MI6.



Saito:
Code name; Havoc. From what I gathered she's a real bogeyman, the most ruthless of them all.
They say even other contractors are terrified of her.
It was during the third South American conflict, where "Heaven's war," where she earned reputation. The official death count in a file are several hundreds, other estimates put it in a thousands.
Forensics thought she created hard vacuums which caused earthquake like disasters.
Knowing it close enough to study and death. This was brutal stuff.
It's been five years since the last time her power was observed.
Astronomics run a full star spectrum analysis and now her official designation is forfeiter.

Kono:
A forfeiter, you don't say. I figured that was just a theory.

Matsumoto:
They're very rare.
You can see why contractors who's lost their abilities would perk up Pandora's ears.
That's why these cases are yanked from investigations and moved into research.

Kono:
To be test subjects, you mean.

Matsumoto:
She's the mother of all lab [brats/rats].

Kirihara:
Anything else?

Saito:
MI6 claims that during interrogation of her, Havoc admitted working with the CIA, but that occurred in US before her disappearance.
Naturally, the CIA denies having anything to do with her, just they deny everything else.

Eric:
And my name is Eric Nishijima. I represent Pandora.
I'm going to ask you a few questions today.
After your plane touched down, can you remember experiencing any strange physical sensations?

Havoc:
Nothing really.

Eric:
Did you think or feel anything odd?

Havoc:
I felt what I always do.

Eric:
Pandora is the UN-led research organization and after this you'll be working with me and a team of scientists helping us with important experiments inside Hell's Gate. Would say that idea concerns you?

Havoc:
Nothing changes for me. You're the one who's concerned.



November 11:
The rise and fall of a contractor, tragic, in a way.
It's been five years since Heaven's Gate vanished and she's been missing ever since. Who knows what she went through before she even landed on Romania?
How could a specimen with so much power become such a shell?

Kirihara:
I'm sorry, but I don't believe we've met.

November 11:
Of course. How rude of me. Feeling comfortable with strangers, it's a habit of the trade.
Jack Simon, British Foreign Ministry. The pleasure is mine.

Kirihara:
Yes. The British diplomat, I've heard stories. Minister, right?

November 11:
Please, no need for titles. Call me Jack.

Kirihara:
Chief Kirihara.



Saito:
So is this your first visit here, Minister?

November 11:
No, I've been here twice before, actually on business.
A bit of assassination work.
You can relax. That was a joke.

Kirihara:
There's something I'd like to ask.
On a more serious note, if you don't mind.

November 11:
I'm an open book.

Kirihara:
Capturing Havoc was some fee by MI6.
Every intel agency on the planet was after her.
So why wouldn't your country do its own research, instead of handing her over to Pandora?

November 11:
That's what the new laws require.

Kirihara:
Sure. But with all the finger pointing over South America, no one has faith in anybody.
Havoc could reveal so much about the Gate and abnormal powers.
Seems any country would keep those findings for itself.

November 11:
Even yours.

Kirihara:
Honestly, yes.

November 11:
Remember Britain's recent history. Governments aren't the only ones suspicious since Heaven's War. The masses don't know about contractors but enough was uncovered about our human experiments for watchdog groups to pop up everywhere.
As the politicians see, going throught lawful procedures was the best way to get the knowledge and still keep our hands clean.
Though I suggested she had to be killed on the spot or sent back to that filthy brothel. Far as I'm concerned, she [and all] Britain would be better off.
Talk to me. What's wrong?

Kirihara:
Hello?
What is it, Kono?

Kono:
We got problems, Chief.
You know the helicopter that's transporting Havoc? Apparently some other aircraft is making an approach on it.

Kirihara:
How would you know that?

Kono:
'cause they're talking about it right behind me.

November 11:
My lord, have they no self restraint.
Here we are, being good global citizens giving her to the UN, so no one gonna have monopoly, and what does the CIA do the first chance they get?
Well, it's their loss. Blow them out to the sky, before that won't be pretty but we'll have chief Kirihara will deal with that.

Kirihara:
Stop the cars right now.
Kono, Matsumoto, get verification. If there's an assault, I want it on tape.
Saito, have the director warn the CIA through diplomatic channels and encourage the British just stand down.
We don't need an international incident.
Hurry! Go!
Are you going to explain yourself?

November 11:
There's no xxx to explain. The CIA's making their move, and strong reaction from my government is the only smart play.
It's the xxx or any bait and switch. xxx.

Kirihara:
A bait and switch?

November 11:
Yes. Open the trunk. The Americans xxx bit of a surprise.

Kirihara:
You mean...!

Saito:
My god.

Kono:
They were eyes on it the whole time.

November 11:
Mostly, yes. Which is why we couldn't use a larger more suspicious suit case.
It's not we don't trust you. We just had to see what kind of leaks you have.
Shouldn't take it as anything personal.



November 11:
The street we're driving, is it a regular route?

Kirihara:
There's nothing to worry about.
We'll be at Pandora's headquarters in a few minutes.

Kirihara:
What is it?

Saito:
Some guy just ran out in front of us!

Kirihara:
Saito, there's nobody on the street.

Saito:
I'm telling you. He was there.

November 11:
Are we ready?

July:
It's a tame.

Saito:
Minister, please stay in the car. We'll escort.
We're here to protect you.

November 11:
You've escorted us into a trap.

Saito:
We've what?

Havoc:
Here they come.

Saito:
Chief! Look!
That's him! Over there! He's the one who jumped in front of the car!

Kirihara:
Who is he?

Havoc:
He is the black reaper.

Kirihara:
What do you see?

Matsumoto:
Foreign ministry, my ass!

Saito:
Chief, these people are contractors!

Kirihara:
Headquarters, come in. This is car #19.
We need immediate backup!



Kirihara:
I'm sorry. This was my failure.

Hourai:
Drop the apologies. Focus on finding the contractor who took Havoc and how you plan to get her back.

Kirihara:
Sir.

Eric:
Are you sure that's all this calls for?
Your police have proven themselves incapable of preventing leaks.
Even after the CIA's move, this unknown group was tipped off practically in real time.
Seems November 11 was right to be suspicious.

Kirihara:
November 11? Who's that?

Hourai:
He means Jack Simon, the British diplomat you're charged with escorting during the incident.

Kirihara:
Hardly a diplomat's title.

Hourai:
He's MI6's top field agent and you didn't need to know.

Eric:
In any case, according to article 22 of the Pandora Act, your section will now be under Pandora until Havoc is in our custody which means you'll take orders from me. Do we have an understanding?

Kirihara:
Sir.



Kono:
That's what I'm saying. So what if he's a legend in the field.
It sure didn't stop him from getting his ass hand to them like the rest of us.
Big names like that are nothing but hype.

Matsumoto:
The guy had no problem fooling us the first time.
Maybe he was in on the grab two.

Kono:
What would he get out of that?

Matsumoto:
I don't know.
Why don't you call him and ask?

Mayu:
Chief, there you are.
We just received tonight's star analysis from Astronomics.
They cross-referenced all strong readings with your report and BK201 became highly active at the moment of the attack.

Kirihara:
BK201 was there with us?



November 11:
Smoke though we hate to smoke, drink though we hate to drink.
They say contractors don't have real allegiances.
We have our chain xxx rest of you.

April:
Speak of self-love, I'm having a brilliant time.

Kirihara:
Some of my colleagues think you knew about the second play for Havoc beforehand, November 11.
What do you think I'll tell them?

November 11:
I'm in a service of the clown.
If I had known about the attack, we would have done more to prevent it.
I failed on my best interests.
If you're smart [chief] you'll tell them they're fools.
But there is one important thing we learned tonight.
Diplomacy failed.
The CIA was exposed heads of states stepped in and make threats that couldn't back down from it escalated from intelligence to military.
All agencies may play cat and mouse but nobody wants a war.
And that means...

Kirihara:
That Havoc wasn't captured by the CIA.

July:
Shinjuku Torino Theater... Parking is available.
Shinjuku Torino Theater... Parking is available.

November 11:
Well, you heard the boy.
Maybe this time, we'll get to jump on him.
You're not the only one who'd like to [see] under BK201's mask.



Huang:
Yes, she's been a good girl. Nice and calm.
No. No signs of Yin spotted. You got it.
We'll turn her over to the syndicate in the morning.

Mao:
They must really wanna keep Havoc away from the Gate, to go to all this trouble.

Huang:
I'll just be glad she's away from me.
Of all you monsters, she's gotta be the most repulsive.

Mao:
Tactful as ever, Huang.

Huang:
Great. What the hell's going on? Where's Havoc?

Mao:
Hei's not here either. I told him to guard her.
Yin, where are they?

Yin:
They ran away.

Huang:
Yeah, we can see that. Where'd they go?

Yin:
I don't know.



Hei:
I thought you were dead, Carmine.

Havoc:
I can't remember the last time anyone call me that.

Hei:
What happened that day? I need to know.
Where is Pai? Damn it, where's my sister!?
