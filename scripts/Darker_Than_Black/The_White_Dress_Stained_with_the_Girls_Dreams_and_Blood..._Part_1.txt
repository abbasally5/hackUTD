Kirihara:
Richard Lao?

Lao:
Yeah.

Kirihara:
You have some information for me. About a contractor. Is that right?

Lao:
Yeah. That's right. I'll tell you everything but... first, I need to know that you can guarantee my safety.

Kirihara:
That all depends on what you've got.

Lao:
I can give 'em to you. The guy you are after, the one wack in the Qing Long bosses.

Kirihara:
VI-952?

Lao:
Yeah, him. So, you have a deal?

Kirihara:
All right. We'll take you into protective custody. Set you up with a new identity.
But, I want the information first.

Lao:
Fine. You got it. But not out here.

Kirihara:
Wait. What's that on your back?
What is it? Talk to me! What's wrong!?

Matsumoto:
Chief! You all right?

Kirihara:
Yes. I'm fine. Contact the director right away and let him know what's happened.

Kono:
Oh, ma'am.

Kirihara:
Kono, call forensics. Hold down the scene until they arrive.

Kono:
Right.



Kono:
Looks like it's some kinda matter transport ability.
Well, I gotta say it's pretty damn twisted way to use it.
The blood you saw on his back must have acted as a catalyst or something
Well, I mean, considering there's nothing left of him but gave him hole.

Matsumoto:
But how does the blood get there without Lao noticing. That's the question.
He didn't get to be Wang Shaotang's right hand man but being careless.
Maybe a contractor has an accomplice.
Are you okay, Chief?

Kirihara:
What do you think? I just lost my key witness.

Police:
You there. Hold it.
You're gonna have to turn around, fella.

Naoyasu:
No... Officer, I'm...

Police:
Listen, there's been an incident here. Right now, no one gets in but authorized personnel.

Naoyasu:
I don't think you understand.

Kirihara:
Why is dad here?

Kono:
Dad?

Police:
Who is that, sir?

Matsumoto:
Superintendent Naoyasu Kirihara. You know, head of the NPA security bureau.

Naoyasu:
This one is the ninth case, isn't it?

Kirihara:
Yes.

Naoyasu:
And the victims were all captains in the Honk Kong mafia, Qing Long Tang.
Could be an inter-syndicate quarrel or internal power struggle perhaps.
So, any likely suspects?

Kirihara:
All of the killing have the same M.O.
We believe a single contractor is responsible. But we haven't determined his identity yet. Only his Messiah code.

Naoyasu:
VI-952.

Kirihara:
All due respect, sir, if you already knew why bother asking?

Naoyasu:
You can drop the "sirs", Misaki. "Dad" works just fine.
Last I checked, office hours are long over.

Kirihara:
I'm still in the middle of an investigation.

Naoyasu:
Listen. Why don't we go get something to eat?

Kirihara:
I just told you!

Naoyasu:
Are you going to force me to pull rank here, Chief Kirihara?
I will if I have to.

Kirihara:
In that case, fine.
But only if you let me pick the place.

Naoyasu:
Fair enough.



Naoyasu:
What were you thinking?
Of all the restaurants in this city, this is where you choose.

Kirihara:
I like the food here.

Naoyasu:
That's not what I meant.
You just happen to pick Wang Shaotang's hotel.

Kirihara:
And?

Naoyasu:
And this hotel is just a front Wang operates to maintain appearances.
He's the boss of the Qing Long Tang. Surely you knew.

Kirihara:
Please. Any kid on the street could probably tell you that.

Naoyasu:
Then why come here?

Kirihara:
You pulled me away from my investigation at the crime scene.
So this was the next best thing.
Besides, like I told you, the food's good here.
Seem like a perfect choice to me.
So, what did you have to say?
You practically force me to come here. So it must be something important, right?

Naoyasu:
Actually, I just wanted to celebrate your new promotion.
Congratulations, Misaki. You're finally going to have your own division.
You'll have to transfer to another department for a while but in time I'll have you assigned to headquarters report in directly to me.

Kirihara:
I don't understand why you are doing this now.

Naoyasu:
You're a rising star, Misaki.
You play your cards right and there's every chance you could one day go as far as becoming our first female Superintendent.

Kirihara:
Sounds like you have my whole career mapped out.

Naoyasu:
Now why would you say it like that. I thought you'd be thrilled by the opportunity.
Listen. Do you remember why you joined the force?
You wanted to be a policewoman to help the weak.
That's what you used to say, isn't it?

Kirihara:
Yeah?

Naoyasu:
Then how could being promoted possibly be a bad thing?
Imagine all the good you can do, all the people you can save, with an entire division at your disposal.

Kirihara:
That may be true but I can't abandon my team.

Naoyasu:
There's still some time before the formal announcement is made.
Sleep on it. It's the right thing. You'll see.



Naoyasu:
Now, don't you go [do] anything too reckless.

Kirihara:
I won't, dad.

Alice:
Misaki!

Kirihara:
Alice, hi.

Misaki:
I don't believe it! You came. That's great! Thank you.
You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
What, then? Here for work?

Kirihara:
Y-Yeah...

Misaki:
Do you even remember what day it is today?

Kirihara:
Wait, today's...

Misaki:
Yep. It's my birthday, same as every year.
I thought maybe you were here for the party tonight but I guess not.

Kirihara:
Sorry.

Wei:
Excuse me, miss. We should go.

Misaki:
He hasn't changed a bit, has he?
You remember my body guard from school, don't you? The ever punctual Wei Zhijun?

Kirihara:
Oh, of course.

Wei:
It has been a long time.

Alice:
Listen. Why don't you come up for a while?

Kirihara:
No, I couldn't.

Alice:
C'mon. How often you get an invitation like this? Don't you wanna take a look around?



Wei:
Enjoy your evening, miss.

Alice:
There's no one watching us. You can relax.
This is our private elevator up to the penthouse where father and I live.
There're no cameras. No one gets past the guard without our permission.
Father does like its privacy.
He's certainly not in a habit of inviting the police up for a visit.

Kirihara:
Oh, you don't say.

Alice:
So, you had dinner at the restaurant, right? How was the duck?

Kirihara:
Ah, good.

Alice:
I knew it. You couldn't resist.
You always did have a weakness for greasy food.
You're gonna get fat.

Kirihara:
It's okay. I get a lot of exercise chasing bad buys.

Alice:
Now that brings back memories. I can xxx we had this conversation before.

Kirihara:
You're right.

Alice:
Now you're loosening up. What? Were you nervous?

Kirihara:
No, you just caught me off guard is all. I'm fine now.

Kirihara:
Um, don't you think this slit is just a little bit too high?

Alice:
Well, that's what you get for forgetting my birthday.

Kirihara:
Alice!

Alice:
There. Seriously it would mean a lot to me if you wore this to the party.
Please?

Kirihara:
Fine. I'll wear it.
Easy!

Alice:
You look perfect.

Kirihara:
Thanks, I guess. So do you.

Alice:
Would you look at us?
Wang Shaotang's daughter and her friend the police chief.
We do make quite a pair, don't we?



Alice:
What are you doing?

Kirihara:
This is a filthy habit, you know that?

Alice:
Yeah, so what? It's none of your business.

Kirihara:
Yes, it is. We're classmates, aren't we?

Alice:
Did you put her up to this?

Kanami:
Don't look at me.
If you're smart enough to not get caught then I'm not gonna tell you what you can and can't do. Really makes no difference to me.

Kirihara:
Kanami!

Alice:
There. You heard what the class-rep said.
Now what don't you leave me alone?
Give them back.

Kirihara:
I said no.

Alice:
What are you doing? You know who [am I/I am], don't you?

Kirihara:
Yeah, you're Alice Wang, right?

Alice:
Not my name, stupid! Don't you know who my father...

Kirihara:
Oh, save it! Your father's got nothing to do with this!
It's just sad. You know that?
Only people who smoke are kids trying to look older or weak people who can't get through life without some kind of crutch.

Alice:
Is that right?
Well, I guess you just got me all figured out then.
Think whatever you want. I don't care. It's none of your business what kind of person I am.

Kirihara:
Yes, it is! I've got to sit in the seat right next to you every day.
You stink! And your clothing reeks of smoke!

Wei:
You seem frustrated, miss. Is something the matter?

Alice:
I'm fine!
That weirdo.



Guest 1:
Happy birthday, miss. My family and I wish you the best.

Alice:
You are very kind.

Guest 2:
Good evening, miss. Congratulations on a lovely party.

Alice:
Oh, thank you.
C'mon. I'll introduce you to my father.

Kirihara:
Misaki Kirihara, sir.

Wang:
Wang Shaotang.
That qipao suits you, Miss Kirihara.

Kirihara:
Qipao, sir?

Alice:
He means your Chinese dress.

Kirihara:
Right. Of course. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Wang:
I've heard much about you over the years.
My daughter is fortunate to have been blessed with such a royal friend.

Kirihara:
No, it's the other way around.

Wang:
Well, I hope you give my regard to your father the next time you see him.
Now, please enjoy the party.

Kirihara:
Thank you, sir.

Wang:
Have you lost your mind?
What are you thinking inviting that filthy dog into our home?

Alice:
Oh, relax, father. She's here as my friend. It'll be fine.

Wang:
I find it disgraceful.
Her in that qipao while you flirt this cheap western gown.

Alice:
Who said it was cheap?

Wang:
You mock me now? Fine, then. But friend or not, she's still a police officer.
Watch yourself.

Alice:
That goes double for you, father.

Wang:
I'm going back upstairs.

Kirihara:
Who's that?

Saito:
Would you care for something to drink, miss?

Kirihara:
Saito?

Saito:
So you managed to sneak in too. That's job.

Kirihara:
No, as a matter of fact.

Saito:
What? Did you flash your little leg to get by security?
'cause that's some dress.

Kirihara:
Look. Be serious. What have you found out?

Saito:
As far as I can tell, they don't have a handle on who it is that's been running around killing their captains, either.
That's what tonight's really about.
This birthday party for Wang's daughter is just a smoke screen.
I hear they're actually going to hold an emergency board meeting.

Kirihara:
He's calling us captains together at a time like this?

Saito:
He's testing their royalty I suppose.
If they're scared off by these murders then they're not fit to be his captains.

Kirihara:
What? What's that?

Saito:
Ah, Li.

Kirihara:
You know him?

Saito:
Yeah, he's like a compulsive eater or something I don't know what you're calling.
The Kid's got this crazy appetite. I mean he is always hungry

Manager:
Li, is that you again?

Kirihara:
Again?

Hei:
I'm sorry, sir.

Manager:
You're done working on the floor. Get back in the kitchen and wash dishes. Go!

Hei:
Right.

Manager:
And you, Saito. What are you laughing about?
Come here. You're being caterer work not flirt with the ladies.

Saito:
But sir, I wasn't! I was just...

Manager:
I don't wanna hear your excuses. [Come on]! You're nothing just...

Saito:
You got it all wrong. I [should] I was not flirting...

Kirihara:
Saito...? He used his real name to go undercover. Idiot.

Saito:
Wow, Li, you went there?

Hei:
Not on purpose. Took a wrong turn and got surrounded by all these scary looking men in suits.
For a minute there I didn't think I was going to make it out alive.

Saito:
Well, that'll teach you to look where you're going next time, won't it?
Hey, that's a private elevator for the hotel owner and his daughter.
Goes straight up to the penthouse on the top floor.
Keep security pretty tight. I guess they don't wanna anyone wandering around up there.

Hei:
I see. Seems like you know a lot about here.

Saito:
Nah, not really.
Men, people out there can eat, huh? These dishes just keep on coming.

Hei:
There are a lot.

Saito:
Damn manager! I stuff a chat for one second he [dicks/sticks] me with this!

Hei:
Did you know her from somewhere?

Saito:
Huh?

Hei:
The woman you were talking to. In the red Chinese dress.
It'd look like you two were close.

Saito:
Well, sort of.

Hei:
She was beautiful.

Saito:
Oh, no. Don't let her pretty face fool you, kid. Trust me. That woman is damn scary which what's she wants to be.

Hei:
Ah. She is, is she?

Saito:
Like no other.



Alice:
Thank you.

Kirihara:
Is this the board meeting?

Alice:
I know what you're thinking.
Sorry, Misaki. I can't let you go near that room no matter who you are.
But if it's information you want I have something else for you.
It's something special I've been saving.
Wouldn't you like to know the identity of VI-952?

Kirihara:
They're stone.

Alice:
That's right. Stone flowers.
And before you ask, they're not statues. No, these plants are very much alive.

Kirihara:
How's that possible?

Alice:
Possible? How do you think? They came from the Gate.
And what's interesting, we found that bees raised on the nectar from these stone flowers produce unique substance within their bodies.

Kirihara:
What are you doing?

Alice:
One little sting and all of the pain and sorrow disappears.

Kirihara:
What?

Alice:
It takes me to another world. A world filled with light.
Would you like to try?
Here!



Captain A:
Wei, what's keeping the boss?

Captain B:
This meeting was supposed to start 20 minutes ago.

Captain C:
And I ordered expectably young Miss to be here by now as well.

Captain A:
Would you care to tell us what you find so amusing?

Wei:
Wang Shaotang will not be coming, I'm afraid.

Captain A:
What?

Wei:
Tonight, the Qing Long Tang enters a new era.

Captain B:
What is this? What are you talking about?

Kirihara:
This wound...

Alice:
Wei did that. Wei Zhijun. It's him. He is your VI-952.

Captain A:
No! Wait!

Kirihara:
Alice, please listen to me!

Alice:
Good bye, Misaki.
It's been fun.

Kirihara:
No!

Hei:
Oh. Hi, there.
