Man:
You're late. Who the hell are you?

Ukiyama:
I hate this country. All it does is rain.

Man:
Look, I wasn't told about any middle man.
Get off me!

Ukiyama:
Losing your job must have been hard for you.
It's a shame and drove you to this.



Kurasawa:
I hate this season. The weather sucks up all the slime and filth on streets and pours it back down on you.
But then, that's what this city is all about.
Name is Gai Kurosawa, private eye.
I've spent my life in this concrete merry-go-round watching the same crimes play out year after year like a jukebox with only one sad song.
It's a city with no one to trust and no one to love.
Where cigarette butts are the only ass you get.

Kiko:
Peeyew! This place reeks!
I can't take it!

Kurasawa:
We've all got a deal with hardships like me.
I've got an assistant who's flat.

Kiko:
That's harassment.
I totally sue [if your word something].
You've been doing your vulgar thing, haven't you?
I don't know how you think your coolness, stink cloud.
It's like tobacco, athlete's foot's xxx, rotten eggs or something.

Kurasawa:
Yeah, that'd be body odor.

Kiko:
Huh, you should die!
But, listen. There's no time for this crap.
We have got problems.

Kurasawa:
Since when?

Kiko:
Some jerk came by saying we have to pay for cable right now.
What a freakin' hammock on a box outside!

Kurasawa:
We still get broadcast for free.

Kiko:
Broadcast doesn't have my favorite show!

Kurasawa:
What is that, anime?
And why are you watching that nudie crap while I'm paying you to work for me anyhow?

Kiko:
It's called fringe benefit, puke hole.
You think I'd be working in a sty for any other reason?
It's not like you're getting me baseball tickets.

Kurasawa:
Remind me what you do here again?

The widow:
Hello?

Kurasawa:
It's a woman, and a real knockout.

Kiko:
How on earth can you tell that?

Kurasawa:
A detective's intuition.

Kiko:
Idiot! Everytime you say that, you end up in the hospital!
I bet she's a [con], don't let her take you in.

Kurasawa:
But when I saw her at the door, I didn't mind being taking in.
In fact, I insisted on it.

Kiko:
Wait! You really wanna hire us, like with money?

The widow:
Yes. Isn't that why people come here?

Kiko:
Nope, usually they're bill collectors...


Kurasawa:
No. We get plenty of cases. But looking for a missing cat...

The widow:
Yes. Yuzuki. That is my husband and I loved that cat like he was a child.
I can't imagine what he'd say if he knew I've lost our beautiful little Miko...
I feel so guilty.

Kurasawa:
Sounds like your husband is out of the picture now.

The widow:
Well, yes. Forgive me. He passed away almost a year ago.

Kurasawa:
Really? I'm sorry to hear that.
You must be terribly lonely. I see why this cat means so much.
But missing person is one thing, searching for a missing cat is a little bit more...

The widow:
I know it's beneath you, isn't it?
You look like a man who lives for danger.

Kurasawa:
That's not what I mean. I found tons of lost dogs.
Sometimes even for money. But finding a lost cat is a little bit more...

The widow:
I see. I'll give you 500,000.
I'll pay you the first half up front if you take the case.
You can keep that for your travel whether you find Miko or not. No questions asked.

Kurasawa:
Very generous offer. But that's not the problem either.

Kiko:
What my boss is trying to say is we'll take it.

Kurasawa:
I am not! If I were trying to say xxx three words!

Kiko:
Kurasawa detective agency is at your service!



Ousan:
There's two more for you, champ.

Hei:
Thanks a lot.

Kurasawa:
Look at all that food.
Okay, that guy has a tape one.

Kiko:
What was your problem back there?
You gotta phobic or something?
It's not like we can afford to turn down that job.
We haven't been employed in weeks.

Kurasawa:
Weird. Former cosmetics innovator falls to death. Sounds a little familiar.
Police are investigating it as a suicide.
Family are shocked, never saw any sign of depression.

Kiko:
Would you pay attention?
We should call the animal shelters and put up a bunch of posters.
We could make flyers too, dupe the neighborhood kids into helping us for free.
Post something in the classifies. I say we hit this from all angles like real pros.

Kurasawa:
It's a same company every time.
Are you getting a funny feeling about this story?

Kiko:
No, I'm getting the feeling you aren't listening to me.

Kurasawa:
A whole string of suicides.
And every single one [no/of] them ex-employee of Fiore Cosmetics.

Kiko:
Fiore Cosmetics?

Kurasawa:
Yeah, you know them?

Kiko:
Ah, yeah, thought I recognized it.
The cat lady. That's a perfume she was wearing. It's super expensive.
It's one of the Fiore signature scents!
Didn't you notice she smelled like she broken a freakin' bottle of her head?

Kurasawa:
Well, she did smell heavenly.
No... Stay focused.

Kiko:
Why don't you concentrate on job instead of pretending you're a cop.

Hei:
Thanks again.

Ousan:
I'll see you.

Kiko:
Hey boss, did you see that guy who was sitting behind me?

Kurasawa:
Yeah, Mr. tape one. Gonna be a poker.
Once he hits 30, he'll blow up like a balloon.

Kiko:
I think he looks dangerous and like totally sexy!
So you think he wanna go out with me if I tell him I'm in college?



Rika:
You were hungry, weren't you?

Ousan:
Rika! I need you in the kitchen. Stop feeding strays and help me!

Rika:
Oops. Bye, Hernandez.
Oh. Come again!

Hei:
Looks tasty.

Mao:
Shut up. I didn't wanna be rude to the girl.

Hei:
So, what did you wanna see me about, Hernandez?



Kiko:
Yeah, there's definitely a resemblance.
But his nose is black and Miko's is pink.
Looks like the search will have to continue. Sorry!
But here's your consolation prize.
Pictures of me in cosplay.
Look at them. Are they the coolest thing you've ever seen?
Where have you been? I had to build this whole freakin' neighborhood search party myself!

Kurasawa:
Please! Chasing kitten is work for a skirt.

Kiko:
A - That's more harassment.
B - Nobody calls girls skirts anymore.
And C - Just that'll make you afraid of cats.

Kurasawa:
Get away, get away!
Anyway, I've done a little investigating.
The widow's late husband, turns out he was a big shot executive at Fiore Cosmetics.

Kiko:
Your point?

Kurasawa:
All those suicides by ex-employees and dead executive's cat goes missing.
Don't you think that's something more than mere coincidence?

Kiko:
Not really.

Kurasawa:
Naive take, Kiko.
You don't solve cases going to obvious about because the truth always lies on the French.
That's the skill of a classic detective. This is work for men.

Kiko:
So, when my boss rambles like an idiot, we'll keep searching for my cat, okay?

Boys and girls:
Okay!



Kurasawa:
Gardenias, huh?

Maid:
Yes. Who is it?

Kurasawa:
Detective Kurasawa, ma'am.
I've got an appointment with the lady of the house.
It's-It's about the cat.

Maid:
Come in.

Kurasawa:
That's her late husband? He looks like somebody's grandfather.
Some guys get all the breaks.

The widow:
Detective. I'm sorry for the wait.

Kurasawa:
Oh, no, ah, it's fine.
That's some kind of a collection you've got.

The widow:
Oh, you mean the perfume.
That was my husband's passion.

Kurasawa:
I've been reading up on him a little bit actually.
Mr. Yuzuki Sakutaro.
I understand he was on the board of Fiore Cosmetics for many years.
Seems he started his career as a perfumer but then move to the executive side.

The widow:
Yes, his sense of smell was very particular.
But you already knew that, right? You know everything.

Kurasawa:
No. It's just the basics, really.

The widow:
Oh, well, this is unusual.
Chanel doesn't warm up to strangers but she loves you.

Kurasawa:
Oh, lucky me.

The widow:
So, you like cats, detective.

Kurasawa:
Big time. Can I use your john?
I can't believe I pissed myself...
Oh, sorry. Wrong room. Too many doors, you know?
Wait. You...

Kurasawa:
That kid's working for you?

The widow:
Yes. He's straightening up the old study. Do you know him?

Kurasawa:
No. Just someone I've seen around town. That's all.

The widow:
So, do you have any leads on Miko?

Kurasawa:
No, ma'am. These things take time.

The widow:
I'm sure you're doing all you can.

Kurasawa:
Actually, ma'am, on a related note...
If I could, I'd like to ask you a few questions.

The widow:
It's her. Of course!
I don't know how I didn't see this before!
It's Toshiko, I'm sure of it.

Kurasawa:
Who's Toshiko?

The widow:
You've done all the legwork, detective.
You must know I wasn't his first wife.

Kurasawa:
Ah, yeah.

The widow:
And you know other stories about how I stole him from his first wife Toshiko.

Kurasawa:
Yeah, sure.

The widow:
It's all right. I'm not a fool. I know what people might think.
But I loved my husband and if anyone is a thief it's her.
She left him but she took all that she could.
Enormous settlement, the house, and now...

Kurasawa:
Wait. What are you saying?
You really think the ex is still bitter enough that she kidnapped your cat?

The widow:
You don't know how she is!
She's evil. Can't you go to her house and see if she denies it?
She lives nearby though I hear she travels frequently.
If she's gone maybe you could take a look around.
Won't you do it for me? It'd mean so much.

Kurasawa:
Okay.

The widow:
Detective...

Kurasawa:
Yes?

The widow:
There's something I'd like to do for you.
Please Detective, it's my pleasure. You're working so hard for me.

Kurasawa:
Oh, god. That's incredible!
I've never done it this way before.

The widow:
I could tell with all the wax.

Kurasawa:
Well, thanks, I'm not sure I deserve this kindness, though.

The widow:
Nonsense. We all deserve to have clean ears.

Kurasawa:
Maybe so. But this is different. I mean, some kind of weird ear heaven!

The widow:
Well, I must say, this is becoming an obsession of mine.
You've heard the saying, haven't you?
People with waxed ears tend to have strong body odor.

Kurasawa:
Oh, that's just a myth. There's no truth to that.

The widow:
You think so? Well, what do you smell like?

Kurasawa:
Oh, there you go. I'm going... I'm going... Yeah, I'd better go.

The widow:
It's okay. I have waxed ears too to be honest.
My husband, he told me that.
He hated my natural scent. That's why I wear all this perfume.
Do you think it's too much?

Kurasawa:
No, not at all.
It is familiar, though.

The widow:
Gardenias.
My husband said it was a good fragrance for this season so I wear it every spring.
I used to hate strong perfumes but even though he's gone I'm still trying to please him.
There was nothing I wanted more than to make him happy.



Kurasawa:
I'm sorry about earlier, pal.
The widow tells me you're doing some work for her.
Well, me too.
Gai Kurasawa, private eye. You can keep that.
I saw you back at the noodle house.
Funny coincidence, huh? Or was it?
Like a packed bus at rush hour this case was heating up.
A young man crossing my path as if he was on my tail.
A widow who wanted my body. And suspicious maid.
Something smells the foul play and no perfume would cover it.

Bus driver:
What's gonna be, pal? You getting on or just sitting?

Kurasawa:
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.



Kiko:
You're gonna break into the first wife's house?

Kurasawa:
What? Only if she's not there.

Kiko:
Is this your plan to scot-free cable again?
By getting yourself thrown into jail?


Kurasawa:
Don't be dramatic. I'm not going in a jail.
I wouldn't steal anything. I just break in to look for the lost cat.

Kiko
Yeah, that's still all kinds of illegal.
But do what you want. I don't care.
By the way, starting tomorrow I'll be taking a paid vacation.
Didn't I tell you?
There's a big anime convention this week. Gotta do my duty as [a fan].

Kurasawa:
You're leaving me to solve this case by myself?

Kiko:
Well, yeah, why wouldn't I? I mean it is work for a man.



Hei:
Is he close?

Mao:
Yin managed to follow him into that bridge then he got too far from the water.
Sounds promising.



Mao:
So that's your payment. Funny.

Ukiyama:
What the...?

Hei:
Murder in cold-blooded and make it look like a suicide.
Maybe I'll try that on you.

Mao:
Hei!

Hei:
You shouldn't have interfered.

Mao:
Maybe not. That's how you gonna thank me.
I just saved you from being hijacked.

Hei:
What does that mean?

Mao:
He's a body jumper, like me.
That's how he staging the suicides.
He projects himself into their skin.
I can only body-jump into animals. His ability works on humans.



Kurasawa:
Can't xxx. The rain clears up for ten minutes but then it gets so hot you still feeling miserable.

Waitress:
Sorry, it took so long to seat you.

Kurasawa:
First wife doesn't answer her phone.
Guess I'll have to make a friendly house call.

Waitress:
Sir, are you going to order something?
xxx for customers only.

Kurasawa:
Oh, no. I just stay down the street. Big meal, very pricy.
Pardon me, sir.
Okay, sorry I forgot something.
Just be a second. No worries. Jacket, see? Sorry. I'm leaving. Bye.
Like I was a jerk.
Wow, him again. What's he doing here?
What the...?

Hei:
Mao. There's a problem.
I need to lose this guy, stay with the target.
You copy that, Mao? Mao?

Kurasawa:
Two times could be by chance. Three was a guarantee.
But what was the man's story?
Had the widow hired him more than sorting books? Or was he a spy on first wife's payroll?
From a looks of her mansion she could certainly afford it.
What is that stench?

Neighbor:
Hey, you there!

Kurasawa:
I wasn't doing anything. Just taking a walk.

Neighbor:
Nice shot! That lady next door. You're not friends with her, are you?

Kurasawa:
No.

Neighbor:
I was hoping you talk to her for me.
That house has been xxx for months.

Kurasawa:
How so?

Neighbor:
Just look at it. It's a trash house.
I've emailed to home owner's association but they're not doing check.
Ah! Hell!

Kurasawa:
What is a trash house?



Waitress:
And how would you be paying for your meal today, sir?

Ukiyama:
Hey, this isn't my jacket.
Damn...



Kurasawa:
Trash house. I got it.
Not too safe, either.
Seriously, my god!
How does this lady live like this?
You think you could afford of...
Cat...
Wait! Get back here!
I'm gonna pay my stupid debt with you!
I gotcha!
