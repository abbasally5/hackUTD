 Hey... have you ever heard of Otokoyo?

Yeah. It's that secret game they play in that creepy dark town, isn't it?

I heard it's really cool.

Yeah, I guess... but I also heard it's really dangerous.
And everyone says not to even go near that town.

That's exactly what's so cool about it!
I'll bet they're just trying to keep all the fun to themselves.

Yeah. I heard that... demons live in that town.

Demons?!

Yeah, yeah! They say demons live there.
They can smell kids, and then they come at night, and snatch them!

I heard a lot of kids went to that town... and never came back.

BS! You're totally lying.

I'm not! It's no lie!

OK, my friend... he told me that he once saw a huge shadow of a demon near that town.

Then why don't we all go there and find out ourselves?

What?! No way!

What are you laughing at?!

The game of Otokoyo.

Huh? Wait... you know something about it?
Are you serious?

Hey! You better not be messing with us!

Well c'mon! Tell us about it!

Shh! Be quiet.
Listen, we won't tell anybody about it, promise, so... tell us.

Otokoyo is a secret game they play in that town.
It's a game of hide and seek.

Sometimes, the lights in the town get eerily brighter.
And the whole town becomes a maze.
But there are signs.
If you follow the neon lights of O, TO, KO, and YO, then you can find your way.

Look! I found it!

When you get to the end, you'll arrive at the Otokoyo Square.
And when seven kids arrive, the game begins.
All kids must wear a fox mask to play.
Otokoyo is not a normal game of hide and seek.
It's very... dangerous.
They say that demons appear to steal away the children who play the game--and it's true.
In the game of Otokoyo, kids will disappear.

Looks like we're not the first ones here.

Wait, there are eight kids here.
Didn't she say we need seven?

Oh, who cares?
I'm gonna reveal this demon's identity anyway!

Yeah.

So, I guess it's begun.
Hikora, are you sure about this?

Yeah.

Well... it looks like the game's on.

C'mon, let's go.

The thing with the door was pretty creepy...

OK. Let's go inside.

OK.

C'mon Boss. Can't you be a little quieter?
The demons are gonna find us.

You idiot! "The demons are gonna find us!"
Haha, you don't really believe they exist, do you?
Hahaha!

What's that?!

It's probably somebody pushing a hot-dog cart or something...

That sounded awful big for a hot-dog cart--are you sure?

Who cares?

Oh... looks like some sort of sculpture or something.

Boss, don't tell me you're a--

Who put this stupid thing here?!
Serves him right.

Boss, that's not cool--that's bad luck...

Hikora, about your sister...

Sorincha?

Yeah, Sorincha.
Are you sure she played Otokoyo?

She... disappeared... the other day, when they were playing the game.

In the game of Otokoyo, kids will disappear.
So you're playing the game to find Sorincha, right?

Yeah.

You know, I've always wanted to find the missing kids, too.

That... girl we met earlier.
She... looks a lot like Sorincha...

Something's coming!

That's her!
Hey! Wait!

Hey!

Huh?

I'm starving! You guys have anything to eat?

No...

Then why don't you go look for that hot-dog cart we heard!

OK...

Wait up!

Hey, Suku!
Are you going... too...?
No way...! It can't be...

Hey!
Boss!

Oh, you guys. Don't scare me like--

Behind you!

Huh? What, is the hot-dog cart back there or something?

Run!

Boss!

She's not here...

Then... where did she go?
Huh?

Yaimao... she really looks a lot like Sorincha...
Yaimao, what... is this?

Isn't it just another poster?

No. It's... it's different.
"Liver-Taker, Blood-Taker, Oil-Taker, Child-Taker"--these are all names of demons.

There are four.
Then... what's this in the middle?
Hey, wait a minute--doesn't this...?

Hey. What are you looking at? Huh?
It's a demon!
Hikora! Run!
Come with us!

Boss...

Shut up, Suku!
Go hide somewhere else! Now!

[???]... [?Suku].. help me!
Help me...

Just as we thought!
This game of hide and seek--

Hikora... look at that!

Where are we?

I think the kids... are all here.

Maybe Sorincha, too.

Hikora! Run!
Go, Hikora! Go find Sorincha!

Yaimao!
Yaimao...

You...!

Yaimaaaaooo!!

Four... five... six...

That's... Sorincha's voice.
Sorincha?

Seven...

Sorincha?

Eight... nine... ten...
Ready or not...

Sorincha? Is that you?

...Here I come.

Just... what are you?
You are...
--What's this in the middle?
--There are eight kids here.
...wait a minute...
--Didn't she say we need seven?
...the fifth... demon!
You... are the demon!

Who'll play hide and seek with me?
When we play the game of Otokoyo, the town gets brighter.
However, that doesn't last for long.
That's why we must play this game of hide and seek--again, and again, and again...

Everyone...

Hikora...

Yaimao...!
Yaimao!!

Who'll play hide and seek with me?
Come and meet me here...
Everyone has been caught!

The kids--are used to light up this town!

You're the last one. You've won!
Now, you are it.

Five... six... seven.. eight... nine... ten!
Ready or not...

Ready!

...Here I come!
