Alphonse: Brother.

Edward: Hm?

Alphonse: The stories about this priest in Lior, do you think they’re true?

Edward: The ones about his miracles? They say he can transmute flowers out of thin air, right? Could be slight of hand, some cheap trick like that.

Alphonse: But…what if they’re not?

Edward: Right…if it’s not then I suppose all that leaves is the real thing, huh?


Edward: The celestial stone that destroyed the city of Xerxes in one night. The Grand Elixir, sealed away by the Eastern Sage. It goes by different names, but it's always the same thing: some kind of object that amplifies Alchemy. And that's the Philosopher's Stone. If we could just get our hands on it somehow, I might be able to get your body back... Damn books! They tell us everything but how to find it!


Edward: Al?

Alphonse: Yeah?

Edward: I think I have a good feeling about this one.

Alphonse: Hm…me too.


Episode 02 The First Day(はじまりの日)


Trisha: Ed? Al? Where are you? Oh you boys…Are you in here messing up your dad’s study again? And Ed, you know better than to scribble on the floor.

Edward: Yea, but it’s not scribbling. Here watch.

[Transmuting]

Trisha: Oh my. That’s alchemy isn’t it? Did your dad teach you that?

Edward: How can he teach us anything if he’s not here?

Alphonse: Right. We read about it in these books.

Trisha: I can’t believe you’ve done this.

Edward: I’m sorry. Did we mess up?

Trisha: No! It’s great! You definitely take after your father. My little geniuses, you make me so proud.

Edward: And that was it, mom had given us all the encouragement we needed. From that moment, we were obsessed with learning alchemy. But then…At the summer of the same year, an epidemic wraps the country. The sickness came and took her.
