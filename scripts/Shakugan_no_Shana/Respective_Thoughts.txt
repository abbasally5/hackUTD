  A heartbeat that lasts for eternity, lives consumed in soundless balls of fire.
No one can tell when the world is displaced and the flames of the Crimson World sweep over all.


Yuji:
Yes. But it's still better than waiting for the end to come and then being forgotten.
I think my existence, my memory is a part of Ike and the others' now.
And now as you, you won't forget me.

Shana:
You're right. But it won't make any difference in the end.

Yuji:
She was going to remember me. And at the time, I thought that was enough.
But there was so much I didn't know. I didn't know anything.

I wonder where she went.
Oh no, Shana!

Shana:
Stay back!

Yuji:
What's the matter? What happened to you?

Shana:
Leave me alone.

Yuji:
You're... hurt.

Shana:
It's your fault.

Yuji:
I'll... get something for you to change into. Come into the house. Shana...

Shana:
You're nothing to me... Just a Torch.

Friagne:
So... I wasn't imagining things... Someone out there is removing all of the Torches I so carefully placed.

Marianne:
Is it her?

Friagne:
No. This isn't the work of a Flame Haze.
If they wanted to lure me into the open, they would erase more than a single Torch at a time.
Besides, I don't think they even know that I need the Torches. They don't know that I plan on using them.

Marianne:
Oh, master...

Friagne:
There, there, Marianne. No matter who they are, I won't let them get away with the tampering. That's I promise.

Yuji:
Bye, Mom!

Yoshida:
I can do it. It's all right. I can say it. I can do it. It's all right. I can say it.

Ike:
Hey, Yoshida. Good morning.

Yoshida:
Hi! Good morning, Ike.

Ike:
So, what's up?

Yoshida:
Oh, nothing. Where's Sakai?

Ike:
Umm... I haven't seen him yet.

Yoshida:
Oh...

Ike:
Why? Do you wanna speak to him?

Yoshida:
No! I mean yes, but... My dad gave me these two free tickets, or maybe even a... movie.
I would be okay... but I thought this'll be nice, too. And so I thought I just...

Yuji:
Good mooring.

Yoshida:
Good morning to you, too.

Ike:
Huh, speak of the devil.

Yuji:
Pardon me?

Ike:
So, got anything lined up after school?

Yuji:
After school? Nothing in particular.

Ike:
Hi, excellent. Hey Yoshida, what about Sakai here?

Yoshida:
What?

Ike:
You were telling me about that person who cancelled and how you need someone to go with.

Yoshida:
Me!? Umm... well... I have two tickets to the art exhibition today. And... I thought if you want to do anything after school.

Yuji:
Two tickets...? With me?

Sato:
Class's already started. What a drag. So we wanna skip out?

Tanaka:
For sure. Ah, what's wrong?

Sato:
Just unluck, we had to run into damn!

Margery:
That was quite a beating she took. I don't think we'll see the Blazing-Eyed little brat for quite a while.

Marcosias:
Yeah. Now if we can just find our main dish, the Corpse Collector. We'll chew him up, and split him out!

Margery:
Same plan as always. We need to find someone who knows the city and can show us around.

Marcosias:
And it wouldn't hurt if they're young and good looking, hey.

Margery:
That's enough, Stupid Marco. These two will do just fine.

Marcosias:
Okay, okay! Are they a bit too young for your liking though?

Boys:
Get back here!

We got 'em now!

Sato:
I-I don't know who you are, lady, but we're hurry up, we have to! So you better not get in our way!

Margery:
Don't make me hurt you always as well.

Sato:
You just shut up! Let's go, Tanaka. You deaf? What's the matter?

Tanaka:
May I call you Big Sister? Can I?

Ike:
So, what are you gonna do?

Yuji:
Huh?

Ike:
What do you mean "huh"? After classes. After school.

Yuji:
Ah, umm...

Ike:
After all, you said you were free, and it would be a shame to let those tickets go to waste. You should go with her.

Yuji:
You're right. I'd be glad to go with you.

Alastor:
Shouldn't you be a little closer to the Mystes?

Marcosias:
And that's why the two of you are gonna help us look for the Denizen in this city.

Margery:
Understand?

Sato, Tanaka:
Mm-hm.

Margery:
That's good.

Tanaka:
So, umm... Big Sister, what exactly are we supposed to do?

Margery:
Oh, let's see... For now, just answer any questions I ask. You boys are from around here, right?

Sato:
Yeah.

Margery:
Watch you, kid.

Sato:
Yes, ma'am.

Margery:
Have there been any major disturbances or accidents lately? Anything out of the ordinary?

Sato:
You know, maybe you should buy a newspaper.
I don't read the paper. I've heard about some traffic accidents, but nothing else.

Margery:
Well... There's something strange about this city.

Friagne:
Please stay here, Marianne.

Marianne:
Master?

Friagne:
I found you...

Alastor:
Do you know why?

Shana:
Why what?

Alastor:
Why you lost to the Chanter of Elegies.


Margery:
That's it? Just one little robbery? There hasn't been anything else unusual?

Sato:
No, nothing.

Margery:
Then let's focus on those Torches I was telling you about.
Where would we find a large group of them congregating?
Then... what about a spot where a lot of people tend to gather?

Tanaka:
Let's see... There's always a big crowd at the station.

Margery:
Okay. We'll start with the building and then do a thorough search of the neighborhood.

Tanaka:
What's up? Is something wrong?

Margery:
A pale white flame...

Marcosias:
You know what, that means...

Margery:
The Hunter... Friagne. You boys two, just wait here for a bit.

Friagne:
That's strange... The culprit should have been somewhere around here.

Margery:
I didn't expect to run into him. Quite a bit catch, don't you think?

Marcosias:
Yeah. It's like chasing a minnow when finding a whale.

Margery:
A perfect chance to kill him, agreed?

Marcosias:
Agreed! I think that's a fantastic idea! Margery Daw, My Fangs of Destruction!

Friagne:
I can sense it. There's a Flame Haze near.

Shana:
The Hunter is on the move again.

Alastor:
Leave him be. The Chanter of Elegies is heading that way now.

Shana:
But!

Alastor:
It's dangerous, you're too distracted. There are other things you must do in the meantime.

Yuji:
Wow, this one's beautiful.

Yoshida:
Yeah. It sure is. There's a lot more. I hear there is a stained glass displayed in the back.

Yuji:
Really? Let's go see it.

Yoshida:
Okay. Sounds good.
You're all right?

Yuji:
A Crimson Denizen!

Yoshida:
Is something the matter?

Lamies:
Ah... so, you can tell. Now I see... you are a Mystes.
Have no fear. I'm not going to do anything with you.
I dislike doing anything rush, anything that would upset the balance of the world.
I think you and I should have a talk.

Yuji:
Huh?

Yoshida:
Do you know this person?

Yuji:
I... oh, yeah, sort of...

Friagne:
Margery Daw, the Chanter of Elegies... And Marcosias, the Claws and Fangs of Violation...

Margery:
Hunter Friagne...

Friagne:
So you're the new Flame Haze in town. Somehow I doubt it, but are you the ones who've been meddling in my affairs?

Margery:
I don't know what you're talking about. I only decided to kill you just now.

Friagne:
I see, then... It seems the one who's been so rudely tampering with my Torches has already left.

Margery:
He was here?

Marcosias:
Sounds like the Hunter's after him, too.

Friagne:
Never mind. I really don't have time to play around with the super Tool for Destruction like you.
But I guess the smart thing would be to kick a stone out of the way before I end up tripping on it.

Margery:
I'll teach you do interfere with my prey!

Friagne:
Your prey...

Marcosias:
Even if you won't ready, we'll still rip you apart!

Yoshida:
Isn't it beautiful, Sakai?

Lamies:
Let me introduce myself. I am Lamies, the Corpse Collector.
And as you surmised, I am a Crimson Denizen.

Yuji:
So, you're one of them. Are you the one who hurt Shana?

Lamies:
Shana?

Yuji:
She's a Flame Haze, of course!

Lamies:
Relax. I did no such thing. But first off, I introduced myself.
Perhaps you would return the favor, and tell me who you are, my young Mystes friend.

Yuji:
My name is Yuji Sakai.

Lamies:
You sound quite certain you've retained your sanity despite learning the true nature of the situation you're in.
That's quite impressive. Oh, perhaps you've simply given up on everything.
You mentioned Shana a moment ago. Is that Flame Haze often by your side?

Yuji:
I gave her the name "Shana". She's the Flame-Hair Blazing-Eyed one.

Lamies:
She's what!? Then I imagine Alastor, the Flame of the Heavens is nearby.

Yuji:
You mean you two know each other?

Lamies:
Yes, something like that. I see, the Flame-Haired Blazing-Eyed Hunter...
Then I should be able to avoid a meaningless fight.

Yuji:
What do you mean "avoid it"? You're a Crimson Denizen.

Lamies:
I do not victimize humans. I am called the "Corpse Collector", because I prey solely on Torches that are weak.
Like the one you just saw, they are on the verge of vanishing anyway.
In fact, this body was borrowed from a Torch, so as to conserve the power of existence.

Yuji:
Why would you want to do that?

Lamies:
I have my reasons.

Yuji:
What reasons?

Lamies:
I have developed an Unrestricted Method of restoration.
I'm in the process of gathering enough power of existence to put it into a fact. That is my purpose in the life.
I want to see the infinite future that lies before us with my own eyes. I want to touch it, and make it a certainty.

Yuji:
That's why you're targeting Torches?

Lamies:
Although I only gather the weak ones, you're a Torch, and I understand how this knowledge must bother you.
Rest assured, my stay here will be brief. I came moving to stay ahead of the harms.
And there are others out there who are not very pleased with my actions in general.

Margery:
Time to get this party started. Strike without mercy, Marcosias!

Marcosias:
We'll kill them, destroy them! We'll tear them into pieces!

Friagne:
I get the impression you know who's been devouring all of my Torches here.

Margery:
I already told you, we're the ones hunting Lamies! That bastard is our catch!
Let's see you get away from those.

Friagne:
Lamies... Lamies, the Corpse Collector?

Margery:
You don't have to worry about him. Because your time!

Marcosias:
Is up!

Friagne:
Flame Repelling Ring, Azure!

Margery:
What!?

Marcosias:
That's not fair!

Margery:
Come back here!

Friagne:
I'd love to play some more, but I just don't have the time.

Margery:
You're not gonna get away that easily!
He's gone! Damn not an ass hole!
Damn all of them!

Tanaka:
Are you okay, Big Sister?

Margery:
I need a drink! Show me a quiet place with a lot of alcohol where get during my face up and pass out!

Tanaka:
Where we're gonna find... oh.

Lamies:
You've told me what I wanted to know. It's time I get going.

Yuji:
Umm...

Lamies:
Ask your question. It's only fair I return the favor. I'll provide you with what you want to know.

Yuji:
It's not really a question. It's just you seem to be living your life for one single objective.
I was just wondering what that must feel like. You don't have to answer that. I'm gonna go now.

Lamies:
Are you bothered by the fact that your existence will soon disappear?

Yuji:
Everyone I ever knew was going to forget I was here.
But Shana's the one person who will remember that I actually lived. And that's...

Lamies:
Young man, can you say with complete confidence that you are the real Yuji Sakai?
You appear to be nothing more than a Torch to me.

Shana:
You're nothing to me. Just a Torch.

Lamies:
Let me rephrase that. You said she will always remember that you lived, but are you fine with that?
Is the person that she's going to remember the person you are now?
There's a reason I didn't prey on you. It's because the flame of your Torch still burns brightly within your body.
Let me give you some information. This city is in grave danger and no one even knows it yet.
The person you are right now will know what to do with this knowledge.
Friagne has something terrible in mind for this place. He's going to wipe it out. He plans to consume the entire city.

Yuji:
Wipe out the city!?

Lamies: 
Nothing will be left when he is done.
You and everything you've ever come into contact with will be gone.
Everything will disappear.

Alastor:
Why are you distancing yourself from him?

Shana:
I don't know...

Friagne:
Two Flame Hazes to deal with, as well as Lamies, the Corpse Collector... We have to move quickly.
A little earlier than I would like, Marianne, but I think we should put the plan in motion.

Marianne:
Master...

Shana:
I don't get it! What is about him!?

Alastor:
Very well then...

Shana:
He's just a Torch that's gonna disappear soon!

Alastor:
It's that Mystes... We have to destroy Yuji Sakai.


The plan to consume Misaki commences. Both the city and I are in grave danger.
And Shana struggles with her inner-thoughts. Now she confronts the Denizen, Friagne?
