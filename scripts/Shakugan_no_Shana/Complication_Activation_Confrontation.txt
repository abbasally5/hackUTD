  A heartbeat that lasts for eternity, lives consumed in soundless balls of fire.
No one can tell when the world is displaced and the flames of the Crimson World sweep over all.


Yuji:
A Crimson Denizen calling himself Lamies appears before me and tells me something disturbing.
He explains that Friagne is on the verge of carrying out a horrifying plan to devour the entire city.
My mother, Ike, Yoshida... everyone will simply vanish from the world. I was shocked, but I knew I had to do or something.
I didn't know that in the meantime, Shana was being forced to make a decision about me.

Shana:
Alastor... what did you just say?

Alastor:
I said we have to destroy the Mystes. Over the last few days, we've been distracted by it for no good reason.

Shana:
Oh, no... But we're using him as bait to draw Friagne out.

Alastor:
Right now, he's doing us more harm than good.

Yuji:
My mom and my friends are gonna disappear?

Lamies:
Not only people. As the world devour implies, it will consume the entire city and change it to power of existence.

Yuji:
I won't let him. It's horrible. I won't let him do it!

Lamies:
In that case, do what you think is necessary.

Yuji:
Yoshida! I'm sorry. See you at school tomorrow, okay? I'm really sorry.

Yoshida:
But Sakai...

Lamies:
Don't take it personally. He's gone to do something that only he is uniquely qualified for.
It may not amount too much in the greater scheme of things, but at least it will prove that he did his best with the time he had.

Yuji:
Shana... I have to let her know!

Marianne:
Are you really going to put the plan into motion, Master?

Friagne:
Yes, I am, my adorable Marianne.
It's unfortunate for that Torch-eating Corpse Collector is here. The situation is becoming serious.

Marianne:
But you won't be able to start the City Devouring for a while yet.
If a Flame Haze were to attack in the meantime, you'd be in great danger, Master.

Friagne:
There, there. I'm touched by your kindness and concern, my dear Marianne. But not to worry. I have already taken precautions.
When I begin the actual City Devouring, I will divert attention from it by engaging in a battle with the Flame-Haired Blazing-Eyed little girl.
The Chanter of Elegies will use that as a opportunity to go after her own prey, the Corpse Collector.
Once she's out of the picture, we'll keep the little one busy, and wait for time to pass.
As long as I keep ringing this bell, the "String Keys" and all of the Torches throughout the city will be tied together.
Marianne, with the power we obtain, you will exist forever. And we will know eternal life together.

Marianne:
Oh, Master...

Friagne:
Now, let us begin the ceremony.

Alastor:
If this information comes from Lamies, then I believe it's most likely true.
It would also explain the unusual number of Torches in this city.

Yuji:
Shana. Let me be a decoy. Wouldn't I draw out Friagne?
What's wrong? We have to do something about him quickly! My mom and my friends are in danger.
Why won't you say something!? What is it!?
Oh, I get it. You can't help me or talk to me because I'm nothing but a Torch to you!

Chigusa:
Oh. Yu-chan.

Yuji:
Ah, hi, Mom.

Chigusa:
Hello, there. So, who's your friend?

Yuji:
She's... ah, Shana. She's only a classmate.

Chigusa:
Oh. May I call you Shana-chan? Well, you two have a good time now.

Yuji:
Ah, Mom. Don't call her that.

Chigusa:
Why not? What's wrong?
Oh, by the way, I'm making your favorite supper tonight. Omelet rice. So don't be late.
It was very nice meeting you, Shana-chan.

Shana:
Only... a classmate?

I'm only a Flame Haze, nothing more. In a way, I'm the same as a Torch.

Yuji:
Why do you keep saying "only"? Just stop it!

Shana:
Those were his words!

Yuji:
Umm... let's get back to our conversation.

Shana:
He's disgusting! He makes me lose focus! Again and again and again!

Yuji:
Shana, are you listening?

Shana:
Get away from me!

Yuji:
A seal!? Shana...?

Shana:
I want you to stop calling me that!

Yuji:
Why? Give me a reason.

Shana:
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! I told you I'm only a Flame Haze! Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!
It's Friagne!

Yuji:
Shana... Why...?

Shana:
I didn't expect you to come to me. Saved the hassle of finding you!

Friagne:
You're welcome. The least you could do is say thanks, little girl.
Decided to show up without your pet Mystes?

Shana:
Why don't we cut the chit-chat?

Friagne:
I beg your pardon. Shall we get started then?
Come, little girl. Come to me now.

Yuji:
She's fighting Friagne now? I guess, I just have to leave the rest to her.
I really wanna help her. But I can't. There's nothing I can do.

Lamies:
Can you say with complete confidence that you are the real Yuji Sakai?
Are you really satisfied with what you are, the way you are now.
You appear to be nothing more than a Torch to me.

Friagne:
Do you like this Treasure? It's the simple yet effective Bubble Root.
However impressive your sword might be, I very much doubt it can break these rings.

Shana:
Fine, then... I'll cut you instead!

Yuji:
Shana! Jump back!

Shana:
What are you doing here!?

Friagne:
Well, well... If I didn't know better, I think you actually want me to take this Treasure from you. I wonder what it is.
How amazing. A Flame Haze actually stopping her sword in mid-swing?
You are going to have to come after me if you want to get this Mystes back. I will prepare the stage for a fitting finale.


Margery:
When you said you had a place in mind, you were talking about Keisaku's house?

Tanaka:
Yeah. It's a long story, but the point is he lives in this huge house by himself.

Margery:
Well... so you're a silver spoon kid. Must be nice.

Marcosias:
Yeah, you're just jealous 'cause you are in gutter home!

Margery:
Quiet!

Margery:
But don't you find it hard living alone? I mean dealing with your parents and your reputation.

Sato:
That's cool. My parents don't say anything. It's not as if my reputation can get any worse.

Margery:
I see.

Tanaka:
Wow, awesome! What is it?

Sato:
It's a map of Misaki.

Margery:
I've covered this city with an Unrestricted Method net.
With this map, if Lamies tries to get away, I'll sense him immediately.
Enough talk! Get me a drink.

Tanaka:
Yes, ma'am. Right away.

Friagne:
The little girl's late, isn't she? I do hope she wasn't blown apart in the last explosion.

Yuji:
She'll come! Shana's a Flame Haze. She'll show up and she'll beat you!

Friagne:
For your sake?

Yuji:
I don't have anything to do with this.

Friagne:
Poor Flame Hazes. I do pity them.
Maniacal to their missions, fettered to their Crimson Lords, they will never escape.
Such a pointless existence deserves my sympathy.

Shana:
Oh, that's nice. But I don't remember asking for your sympathy.

Yuji:
Shana, you're here.

Shana:
Prepare yourself. Your time has come!

Yuji:
Shana!

Alastor:
No! Don't! Head-on attacks won't work against him!

Yuji:
There's nothing I can do to help her.

Lamies:
Are you really satisfied with what you are?

Yuji:
But I'm...! Shana's fighting. I just feel so helpless!
No. There's got to be something I can do!
Shana! Behind you! Kick it!

Shana:
What? This isn't some kind of game we're playing.

Yuji:
If I concentrate, I can see a pattern to the balls of light.
I have to tell her! Shana, behind you!

Shana:
Shut up!

Yuji:
Above you!

Shana:
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
What's going on? My body's responding. And I'm starting to feel hot!

Alastor:
The intensity of your flame has increased.

Marianne:
Master, please. I think we should stop. She's getting stronger!

Friagne:
Yes. I feel it, too, Marianne. But we must see this undertaking through to the end.
We can't give up on my plans for us now, not or so, close to attaining eternity!
We're almost there. The City Devouring will commence shortly. We have to pursue of you just a little longer.

Margery:
Marcosias, look.

Marcosias:
No doubt about it. That bastard with the thing for dolls is up to something.

Margery:
If he keeps that up, I'll never find Lamies, even with the network through all over the city.

Marcosias:
Wanna crash his party?

Friagne:
We're so close just a little longer. My Unrestricted Method will be complete any moment now.
We're almost there. We are almost there.

Marianne:
Master...
I pray for your safety, Master.
Prepare to die, Flame Haze!

Friagne:
We're almost there, my precious darling Marianne... Soon our wishes will come true...

Yuji:
That's strange. Those big balls of light are gone, but he's still ringing the bell.
And why did he lure Shana to this roof where there's nothing up here?
Maybe... maybe he brought her up here just to keep her distracting!
That must mean he's already started consuming the city!

Friagne:
Everything is in place. The longer way to the City Devouring that we have prayed for it is about to begin.
But before it starts, let's get rid of her. When a mere Tool for Destruction there is to defy us, they must be punished.

Yuji:
Shana!

Shana:
Stay back!

Friagne:
You know what? I think I'll use your power to operate the Trigger Happy.
Don't worry. I won't drain you completely. We don't want you to miss the City Devouring.

Yuji:
Sha... Shana...

Friagne:
This shot will signal the beginning of our eternity together, Marianne.

Yuji:
Don't do it. Wake up, Shana! Wake up!

Friagne:
Now, good bye, little girl. And farewell to the city that gave us eternity.

Yuji:
Shana!

Friagne:
It's not over... The ceremony for our life of never ending bliss isn't over. It... isn't... over!

Margery:
Gimme a break. How long are you gonna stretch this out for?

Friagne:
Look at this[it], Marianne. [And][Up] then, worked perfectly... we're going to be together now... forever!
Marianne... We'll be together... forever...

Yuji:z
We won...

Shana:
At the end... it was you who gave me the strength I needed.

Yuji:
Well, it's good to know I could be of some help.
Most of my existence has been drained. I guess I'm gonna disappear pretty soon.
I wanted to help even though I'm only a Torch.

Shana:
Don't say "only". You're Yuji Sakai. And don't you forget it?

Yuji:
But... I'm sorry. Yesterday you lost because of me, didn't you? That's why you tried to cut me.

Shana:
It wasn't you. It wasn't your fault...

Yuji:
Really? I'm glad to hear that.
At least what I did while I was here had some meaning... Take care now, Shana.
What!? What the...!? What's just happened to me?

Alastor:
I'd say that confirms it.

Shana:
That's the power of the Treasure inside you.
The most valuable in all the Crimson World. It's called the "Midnight Lost Child".
At the first stroke in midnight, whatever existence you've lost during that day, it's fully restored.

Yuji:
So, what does that mean?

Shana:
Don't you get it yet? It means you're still gonna be around further while.

Margery:
Well... am I interrupting anything?

Shana:
You're not gonna make me thank you, are you?

Margery:
Don't bother. I had to do something to bring that stupid fight to an end. Oh my, did I upset you?

Shana:
Someday, you and I are gonna settle this once and for all.


Driven by her hatred for all Denizens, Margery Daw renew so pursued of Lamies.
Another confrontation turns violent, when Shana gets in her way.
