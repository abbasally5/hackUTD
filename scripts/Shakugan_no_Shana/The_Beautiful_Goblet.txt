  A heartbeat that lasts for eternity, lives consumed in soundless balls of fire.
No one can tell when the world is displaced and the flames of the Crimson World sweep over all.


Margery:
Now, I wonder where he's hiding.

Marcosias:
We've Sealed the place off. So the only thing moving around is gonna be that Denizen scum.

Lamies:
They've finally found me...

Margery:
Hello, Corpse Collector... The time of your demise has finally come.

Marcosias:
We just wanna give you a little kiss. A kiss you only get once in a lifetime!

Lamies:
Should I use it? No.

Margery:
Thinking you're fighting?

Marcosias:
Bring it on! It's your choice! Either of them won't change the outcome!

Lamies:
Be confused...

Margery:
Nice...

Marcosias:
Oh, bravo! Well done with him! There're so many little birdies, we don't know where he is! Yeah, right!

Margery:
Did you really think the pathetic trick like that would work against us?

Marcosias:
Save your breath, scum!

Margery:
You little brat! When did you get here?

Shana:
Allow me to reintroduce myself.
I am the Flaming-Haired Blazing-Eyed Hunter, the partner of Alastor, he who is known as the Flame of Heavens.
I am Shana!

Lamies:
So, she is with the Flame of the Heavens. I see...

Margery:
Your trick worked on us after all. With all those flapping wings, we couldn't sense the little brat moving in closer.

Marcosias:
Well, Corpse Collector, you're gonna pay for that trick!

Yuji:
Get back.

Lamies:
It's you again.

Shana:
Keep your hands off him!

Margery:
Looks like you brought along someone to help you.

Marcosias:
A Mystes... He can move inside the Seal.

Lamies:
I think I know what's inside you.

Yuji:
Let's talk about it later, okay?

Shana:
Make your choice. Either leave Lamies, the Corpse Collector alone, or prepare to be hurt!

Margery:
Someone's overconfident... Do you really think you have what it takes to stop us?
I'm afraid you're the one who's gonna get hurt here. Is protecting a Denizen really worth it?

Shana:
It is a duty of a Flame Haze. There's a risk the city could be severely damaged if you destroy him.

Margery:
He's a Denizen. It's more dangerous to leave him alive.

Shana:
Lamies is harmless.

Margery:
A Denizen who doesn't cause any harm? You don't seriously expect me to believe that?

Shana:
I'm not gonna get it into an argument. And I don't intend to lecture you, either.
Just hurry up and make your decision. Either back away or you'll get hurt!

Margery:
You little brat!

Marcosias:
You want an answer? We choose number three! We're gonna kick your butts!

Margery:
We'll kill you all!

Shana:
Well, you're welcome to try.

Margery:
Oh, good. Looks like you've raised your game to the point where it's gonna be fun killing you!

Marcosias:
Indeed she has. What are we waiting for? Let's do it! Let's claw them!

Yuji:
Shana, look out!

Lamies:
That was well done.
She's antagonized them to the point where they're focusing entirely on her, and they're ignoring us.

Yuji:
Shana...

Margery:
Let's play a little sally go around the moon!

Shana:
That one.

Margery:
She dashed straight!

Marcosias:
Behind you!

Margery:
She's quick! Think you're smart?

Shana:
I can (be) stronger, because Yuji's here! I can do anything!

Marcosias:
Damn it! She won't stand still! Damn!

Shana:
You're betting a give up yet?

Margery:
You first. You said it was your mission to protect that worthless worm, Lamies.
A Flame Haze's real mission is to get rid of Denizens!

Shana:
You're wrong. Our job is to maintain the balance between the two worlds.
And to keep the balance, I've got rid of many harmful Denizens without hesitation.
But you go out of your way to kill them because you like it!

Margery:
Who are you to tell me what's right and what's wrong? You don't know what I've been through, brat!

Shana:
You're quite right. I don't know what your reasons are.
And I really don't care either. To me, you're just a pain in the ass.

Margery:
Why? You little...

Marcosias:
Margery, hey!

Margery:
Don't worry. I've got it under control.
There is something about her... But it's not her fighting style. It's like a something within her.
Something's given her this irritating confidence. Could it be... that. Let's see what happens.
Rain on the green grass, where I can see! Rain rain everywhere but not upon me! Attack!

Lamies:
Oh... The Fire Repelling Ring...

Margery:
How did he survive that?

Marcosias:
Here she comes!

Shana:
Did you think I'd actually be stupid enough to leave Yuji unguarding?

Margery:
You mean... you were waiting for me to target him all this time!?

Marcosias:
Look out! The Unrestricted Method is collapsing!


Tanaka:
Big Sister... Isn't she pulled them off... you know, got rid of that Denizen?

Sato:
How should I know?

Tanaka:
You wanna go check it out?

Sato:
Why? What for?

Tanaka:
Are you the least bit worried about her?

Sato:
Think about it. What will be the point of us going out there?
She wouldn't have dumped us if we're still useful.

Tanaka:
I guess you're right.

Sato:
Come on.

Lamies:
Young man!

Shana:
Yuji!

Yuji:
Shana! Shana...

Shana:
Yuji... Yuji, lower your protection when I jump! Otherwise my flame won't work!

Alastor:
Wait. If you dissolve it now, we're an easy target.

Margery:
You can fall down or you can get shot down. This time, it's your turn to decide.

Lamies:
Well, well... This is a sight you don't see too often.
Though I'd love to stay and see how it turns out, I'm afraid I really must be going.

Marcosias:
You're not getting away that easily!

Shana:
Okay! Drag your protection! I can do anything!

Yuji:
Shana! The building!

Alastor:
Calm yourself. She'll have control in a moment.

Shana:
Yuji, you're gonna have to hold on to me! I can't fly like this!

Yuji:
I gotcha!

Shana:
Yuji, I can do anything...

Margery:
There's nowhere left for you to run to, Lamies...

Marcosias:
This game of hide-and-seek is going on far too long!
What the hell!?

Margery:
Before... we never had anything that was worth it damn. I had my life. But everything else had been taken...
So I just wanted to tear everything down... I was going to ridicule, destroy, steal and kill everyone!
But... even now, that's taken away from me... He took it away.
Just because he wanted to show me that I no longer had anything left to destroy.
Then I was empty... If only I could hurt him... that's all I want! Just him...!

Marcosias:
Go on. Finish the thought. You're an empty container.
A beautiful vessel of an ultramarine finish.

Margery:
Who are you?

Marcosias:
Call for me. In a murderous shout, call for me!
My vessel, I will fill you up, and you will carry out my will...
That's right. Call for me. My Beautiful Goblet!

Yuji:
What is that!?

Alastor:
That is the manifestation of the Claws and Fangs of Violation.

Lamies:
He's raging... out of control. At this rate, he'll shatter the Seal.

Yuji:
What will happen then?

Lamies:
You cannot repair the damage once this touches the outside world. Everyone in the Seal will vanish.

Yuji:
Everyone!?

Lamies:
And right now, his hatred and his rage are spinning forth out of control.
Such a display must be having some kind of effect outside the Seal.

Alastor:
But he's passed the point where he's willing to listen to reason.

Shana:
The we'll just have to hit him until he does listen. Yuji.

Yuji:
I'm ready to help. Just give me the word.

Shana:
Okay. I'm gonna fly us as close as I can. When I give the word, use the ring to protect us.

Yuji:
I understand.
Ah, right. Umm... I'm gonna grab on to you now, okay?

Shana:
Hurry up! I can't see anything if you're there!

Yuji:
Oh, yeah, sorry. Ugh! My face is getting squished...

Shana:
The instant I attack, I want you to protect us by the Azure Ring. Wait for my sign.

Yuji:
You think it'll work?

Shana:
It will.

Yuji:
Right.

Shana:
I still have that feeling... I can do anything.
Do it now!

Yuji:
Just then... for the first time, I knew what Shana meant when she said to feel the "kill".

Marcosias:
Hey.

Margery:
I think I'm still alive...

Marcosias:
Yeah, you and me both.

Margery:
I'm surprised you didn't kill us.

Shana:
I know you wouldn't have hesitated. It's a good thing we're different than you.

Margery:
Because Flame Hazes don't do that?

Shana:
Yes. That's not part of our duty.
I hurt you just enough to keep you from chasing after Lamies.
I stopped you and that is as far as I needed to go.

Margery:
You go on and only about your mission. Like you're a Crimson Lord. Disgusting...

Shana:
Yeah well, I don't like you, either.

Yuji:
Would you two stop acting like children?

Margery:
What is he anyway? It's not fair...

Lamies:
Don't worry. I have no intention of harming you. I know the Claws and Fangs of Violation well.
"Your death will be a painful one if you dare touch my Goblet."

Marcosias:
Shut up! Nothing is changed between us.
What do I care about the balance?
I'll swallow all the existences around here and I'll kill, kill, kill you all!

Lamies:
Don't go after Silver...

Marcosias:
Bastard! Do you know who he is!?

Lamies:
You'll be wasting your time. You chase but never catch, search but never find. He appears at will.

Margery:
No. I could never stop looking!
You don't know what you're asking! Finding him is the only thing that matters to me!

Lamies:
You will have your chance to meet him when the time is right.
How you accept it and what you'll do then are for you to decide.

Alastor:
Can you not tell us who this "Silver" is?
Very well... I won't ask again.

Lamies:
This area has been quite severely damaged. I don't think either of you have enough power to repair all this.

Yuji:
Well, you can use me.

Lamies:
So it is the Midnight Lost Child. But even if I would use all of your existences, it still would not be enough.

Yuji:
But those are...!

Lamies:
Thank you for your help, Flame of the Heavens and Flaming-Haired Blazing-Eyed Hunter, or rather... Shana.

Alastor:
You were great help to us as well.

Yuji:
Thank you for restoring the city to the way it was. But it costs you all the power you've been gathering.

Lamies:
Never mind. I consider it a fair exchange for having my faith in others restored.

Yuji:
How long?

Lamies:
What?

Yuji:
It's just... I was wondering how long it took you to gather up all the power that you had to use up today.

Lamies:
Forget that. Let's talk about you.

Yuji:
Huh?

Lamies:
I take it you're no longer just waiting to disappear.
Things will change now that you have the Midnight Lost Child within you.

Yuji:
Oh, yeah. Well, I'm really glad I'm not going to vanish.

Lamies:
Not only will you not vanish, but you...

Yuji:
Huh?

Lamies:
No... The Midnight Lost Child and a Flame Haze.
I'm sure the breeze will bring me word of your exploits. Until we meet again.

Yuji:
Is it appropriate to say "Take care of yourself"?

Lamies:
Farewell, Flame of the Heavens. I will see you again at the crossroads of misfortune.

Alastor:
I pray that your flower of hope will one day bloom, "Spiral Wind Harp".

Shana:
He's Wind Harp!? That guy!?

Yuji:
Who's that?

Shana:
"Spiral Wind Harp", a Crimson Denizen who's a master of Unrestricted Methods. He designed a lot of them.

Yuji:
Really?

Alastor:
"Corpse Collector" and "Lamies" are merely aliases.
He uses such names in this world to provide him with the freedom he needs as he pursues his goals.
Goals so lofty, they are worth spending hundreds of years to bring about.
It is the only thing that matters to him anymore.

Margery:
Well, the seesaw, Margery Daw... Sold her bed, and lay on straw...

Alastor:
Chanter of Elegies... We are not passing judgment on you, nor do we see to influence you.
However, should you forget what the true mission of a Flame Haze is, rest assured, we will stop you once again.

Shana:
As long as we're clear about that.

Margery:
Don't chase, don't destroy, don't kill, don't take things of yours.
What was there left for me to do? Hey, Marcosias. We're so beat up like a bad joke.
I'm completely empty... I'm what they call a woman with a bad reputation.

Marcosias:
Hey.

Margery:
Please don't say something corny like "You've still got me."

Marcosias:
No. No. Look below.
It's not much. But it looks like we still got a place to stay.

Yuji:
Remember, I'm still new with this, so you could go a bit easier on me in training.

Shana:
Hey, you're the one who asked for lessons.

Yuji:
Yeah, I know. But still...

Yoshida:
Sakai and Yukari... They're together again... And they both missed school yesterday.
I wonder if they're...! No, it's just a coincidence. Don't worry. I'm sure I'm wrong...


Glittering water. Bright lighting. A battle takes place in an indoor water park.
Dressed only in their swimsuits, the girls face off against each other.
