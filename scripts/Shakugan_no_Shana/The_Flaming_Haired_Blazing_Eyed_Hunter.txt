  A heartbeat that lasts for eternity, lives consumed in soundless balls of fire.
No one can tell when the world is displaced and the flames of the Crimson World sweep over all.


Wilhelmina:
Hesitation and mercy are unnecessary. Persona, God Vessel.

Tiamat:
Understood.

Wilhelmina:
No defects.

Tiamat:
Checked. Commence.

Orgon:
Damn!

Tiamat:
Goal achieved.

Flame-Haired Blazing-Eyed Hunter:
There's nothing you can do from here on. Alastor and I are going to take care of the rest.
Find the most flawless and suitable Flame Haze that you can.
Consider this the final request of a woman who is getting ready to end her life.
Farewell, Wilhelmina, Tiamat. Thanks for everything. May fortune and good luck forever smile upon you.

Wilhelmina:
Thousand Ordinances. The Flaming-Haired Blazing-Eyed Hunter's contract is indeed now in effect.

Orgon:
Flame-Hair Blazing-Eyes!?

Wilhelmina:
However, her existence must be kept secret until she becomes accustomed to the outside world.
Obviously, I cannot afford to let you escape this Palace.

Orgon:
Escape? Who can defeat me?

Wilhelmina:
You will be fighting someone else. Neither I nor the Blazing-Eyed Hunter will be your opponent.

Orgon:
Rainbow!? It can't be! It's... it's impossible! Rainbow Wings, Merihim!

Merihim:
Is this to be my task, then?

Wilhelmina:
Your skills are rusty. We will have you practice before the great battle that indeed fulfills your pledge.

Merihim:
Huh. So this is to get me back in the shape. Long time no see, Orgon.

Orgon:
How...

Merihim:
You will be a worthy opponent on which to test the power of my Rainbow Sky Sword.

Orgon:
But... how...!?

Merihim:
Now, let's get started, shall we?

Orgon:
What are you doing here?

Flame-Haired Blazing-Eyed Hunter:
Do you remember... that day when we began our contract?
It had nothing to do with fate. I chose it on my own free will.

Girl:
I decided that this is right for me. This is my path.

Vine:
Damn it! This is too much... I've gotta get away from here.

Tenmokuikko:
I will fight the mighty warrior...

Vine:
Wait! No! No! Don't do ...

Girl:
I'm ready.

Tenmokuikko:
Mighty warrior...

Girl:
Watch it! I saw it! I saw that. I can feel the strength within me.
This... this is what it means to be a Flame Haze!
It's incredible. I really am fighting for my life!
Even a monster like him has to have some kind of weak point.
How's that? A little more, then he's finished!

Alastor:
Get away!

Girl:
No! I'm trapped! What's this?

Alastor:
Your Night Cape, an Unrestricted Method in the form of a black cloak.
It is the garment of the Blazing-Eyed Hunter.

Tenmokuikko:
My quest... to hand over the blade... to award the warrior... to that end, I became a Mystes on my own free will...

Alastor:
A human choosing to become a Mystes!?

Girl:
Why would anyone do that?

Tenmokuikko:
Mighty warrior... I have searched for a warrior... powerful enough to wield me...
And to that end, I became a Mystes on my own free will...

Girl:
Wield me.. Is the sword talking!?

Alastor:
Hmm... It seems that three separate souls have merged.
The armored warrior, the weapon itself and the swordsmith who fashioned it.

Tenmokuikko:
This weapon must go to the mighty warrior with the greatest skill...
The Nietono no Shana carries the essence of my life...
To that end, I have searched for the warrior who was worthy.

Alastor:
Madness... You're saying you gave up your humanity all for the sake of finding this perfect warrior...

Girl:
I get it. You are the same as me.
You just wanted to know where you belong, and you decided to go out and find that place on your own.
Well, you can stop looking. The mighty warrior who will wield you is standing before you.

Tenmokuikko:
Mighty warrior... Prepare yourself...

Girl:
Focus everything on one blow!

Wilhelmina:
Will you be going now?

Merihim:
It is not a matter for discussion, Wilhelmina Carmel.
I must fulfill my pledge to her. That is why I am here.
Is it not the same for you?

Wilhelmina:
No, it's not. I chose this...

Alastor:
Clearly, you were overdoing it. I just acquired you.
I'm a little worried that I'm going to lose my Flame Haze so soon.

Girl:
I was lucky to survive that.
It was a hundred times more difficult than my training, and a thousand times scarier than that Denizen.
You think it's okay?

Alastor:
It is your responsibility.

Girl:
I will take it. Thank you. Our journey begins together!

Bel-Peol:
Ah, one of them has just been defeated.

Alastor:
A great cataclysm is at hand.

Girl:
The Crimson World is here. Shiro! Get ready, Alastor!



Flame-Haired Blazing-Eyed Hunter:
It looks like I win. The winner controls the loser's fate. Not the kind of power you want to give the woman you are in love with.
Promise me three things. You will never consume any other person. You will never bother this world again.
And that you'll help train the next Flame-Haired Blazing-Eyed Hunter.
Do it the very best of your abilities. Please do this for my love. Our last battle was the most difficult and the most enjoyable.
No, I won't wait for you. Rainbow Wings, Merihim, this is goodbye.

Merihim:
Hm. I've longed for this, Flaming-Hair Blazing-Eyes. Come at me, Flame Haze!

Don't touch me! Wilhelmina Carmel... There is a reason why both of us are still here.
We are to carry out her last wish. We shall remain here together, for that reason, and that reason of all.

Wilhelmina:
He's so irritating... Right to the end, he got on my nerves...
That happened so long ago.
Indeed, right now, my sights are set on a new era. Yes, a new era...

Merihim:
Tenmokuikko's strengths lay within his sword.
He was an opponent against which you did not need to use Unrestricted Methods. However...

Against Crimson Denizens such as I, your opponents' attacks will not be evident to the naked eye.
Learn to keep your eyes open while sensing the changes in the power of existence within.
You must be able to detect the sign of an Unrestricted Method being generated!

This does not mean you should neglect what your eyes tell you.
And most of all, never forget this. Unrestricted Methods by Denizens cause seemingly impossible situation.

It's pointless to be surprised. Focus on what is actually there.
You should always be able to see us through our techniques.
For they defined us, that is how we, Crimson Denizens, do battle with others.

The time for talking is passed. 
Here I come!


Girl:
Wilhelmina...

Wilhelmina:
A whole new era... awaits you, indeed.

Well then, it's indeed time we say our goodbyes.

Alastor:
Thank you for all you've done.

Wilhelmina:
No need to thank me.

Girl:
Aren't you coming with us?

Wilhelmina:
If I join you, all my efforts up to now will have been wasted.

Girl:
But...!

Wilhelmina:
Indeed from now on, you have to do everything on your own without my help.
I know you'll be just fine on your own. Forgive me for insisting to be this way.
As long as you act as we've taught you, you'll have no real problems.
Besides, the Flame of Heaven is with you now. You indeed have nothing to worry about.

Tiamat:
You are ready.

Alastor:
Hmm...

Wilhelmina:
Oh.

Girl:
Oh, Wilhelmina...

Wilhelmina:
I will be there to watch over you. So make sure you don't eat too many sweets.
Indeed, allow us to hug before you go.

Yuji:
Hey, Shana. Why do you love melon bread so much?

Shana:
Well, you see...

Yuji:
Yeah, go on.

Shana:
It's a secret!

Yuji:
Wait a minute! Shana, wait!

Shana:
Forget it.

Yuji:
What do you mean "forget it"?



A Tuner by the name of Khamsin arrives in Misaki City.
The Bal Masque finally makes its move.
And a girl with feelings for Yuji learns of the real world.
