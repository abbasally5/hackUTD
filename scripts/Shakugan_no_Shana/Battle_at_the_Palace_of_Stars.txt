  A heartbeat that lasts for eternity, lives consumed in soundless balls of fire.
No one can tell when the world is displaced and the flames of the Crimson World sweep over all.


Wirhelmina:
Once we storm in there, there would indeed be no turning back.

Shana:
I know.

Wirhelmina:
And our objective?

Shana:
The only thing I'm certain of is that I have to go in there.

Wirhelmina:
I understand. If we go, I'm sure the answer will become clear.
Because you... are a Flame Haze.

Shana:
Yeah.

Tiamat:
Enter.

Yuji:
Shana. She protected me. Even though I'm nothing but a Mystes. Why?

Shana:
Yuji! I can feel you!

Wirhelmina:
They have not set up a protective seal.

Alastor:
Yes, but not surprising considering they knew we were going to be coming.

Tiamat:
Stay focused.

Shana:
Right.

Hecate:
Flame Hazes...

Yuji:
Shana.

Wirhelmina:
Indeed I expected to see more Denizens roaming the Palace of the Stars.

Shana:
It's too quiet. And there aren't any Rinne.

Wirhelmina:
I sense something over there.
A vast amount of power of existence is pouring forth.

Shana:
That's where Yuji is...

Alastor:
Hmm...

Wirhelmina:
They're not even trying to hide the whereabouts of the Midnight Lost Child.

Tiamat:
A trap.

Alastor:
But, we don't have the luxury of working out a perfect plan to counter every situation.

Yuji:
Then your name is Shana!

Shana:
Let's go.

Wirhelmina:
Indeed the mission will be a success if even one of us gets through to the Midnight Lost Child.
Go forward and hold nothing back.
What... what is your answer?

Tiamat:
Time is running out.

Tanaka:
She's going up against that huge thing? Is Hirai gonna be all right?

Sato:
Wait, look there! The castle has Unrestricted System things moving all over it.

Professor:
Look! They're here! [The adamants like them break in] to obstruct my experiment! ... Domino!

Domino:
I'm here! All the preparations are complete!

Professor:
We will experiment on the experiment obstructors that play a key role for the theme of my Whole Sacred Chapel is ecologizing and recyclizing!

Wirhelmina:
Something's here.

Shana:
A Denizen?

Wirhelmina:
No.

Robot Rinne:
[xxx ... ]

Shana:
These guys...

Wirhelmina:
Indeed, these are Rinne.

Tiamat:
Automatons.

Alastor:
The Seeker's doing...

Shana:
What's happening here? My power of existence has been drained.

Wirhelmina:
This machine...

Professor:
It's a success!
Oh! The Unrestricted Method drains existence from [testers] in order to power my Rinne!
It's succeeded excellently!

Domino:
Yes, sir, Professor! We'll continue the attack!

Alastor:
Hmm... Cursed Seeker... How obstructive.
That's why we were so easy to gain the entrance.

Shana:
How come they're still moving?

Alastor:
He's likely equipped them with some special device that empowers them.

Wirhelmina:
Indeed here they come!

Shana:
The Nietono no Shana is... heavy!

Alastor:
The only things you can count on are the physical techniques you've worked.
Remember the lessons from the Palace of Heaven's Road!

Shana:
Right!

Wirhelmina:
We've come too far to turn back. Our only... chance is to find the Midnight Lost Child.
Indeed how ironic. There's an endless supply of power of existence outside.

Yuji:
Shana... She's fighting!

Hecate:
Fighting...

Yuji:
Power of existence is flowing into the city. Because of the Midnight Lost Child.
It's true. If I want to protect the city, then maybe this is for the best.

Hecate:
For the best...

Yuji:
Why?

Hecate:
I'm nothing but a Mystes...

Yuji:
Stop it! What do you have to look inside me?

Hecate:
You're wrong. You... are the one who's entering me.
Your thoughts... are fulfilling me...
I have prayed for this moment... searched for an answer...
And now that is here.
That's why... I want... more of who you are.

Yuji:
You're... taking my...

Shana:
Yuji...



Bel-Peol:
Well, I wonder how long they're gonna last.
Care to make a little wager?

Sydonay:
Have you forgotten, Bel-Peol?
We're fighting the Flame of Heaven and the Tiara of Dreams and Illusions.

Bel-Peol:
But the Flame Hazes they're using have been denied access to power of existence, making them no different than your average human.
Besides, we've already completed the Sacred Chapel.
We'll be collecting power of existence forever now.

Robot Rinne:
[xxx ...]

Sato:
So she's fighting in there right now?

Tanaka:
Probably... Come on, Hirai... What the...!?

Alastor:
Warning! The power of existence has reached saturation point!

Wirhelmina:
Indeed they're endless.

Sydonay:
Is that a part of this calculations?

Bel-Peol:
Who knows? I get the feeling we're in unknown territory here.

Professor:
How exciting! We've never seen that like before... a world filled to the brim with the power of existence.

Domino:
Professor, what's gonna happen next?

Professor:
I don't know. That's why we do these experiments!
In order to find out the real truth, the real laws and the real state of the world!

Yoshida:
Sakai... Yukari...

Sato:
Right... I don't know what's going on, but I do know we're in trouble.

Tanaka:
Yeah, and so is... the city!

Margery:
Hey! Guys! Are you there? Keisaku! Eita! You guys aren't dead, are ya?
Hello! Is there anyone there? Keisaku! Eita! Answer me right now!

Tanaka:
I... we... you... Big Sister!
Big Sister!

Marcosias:
Ha ha ha. Glad to hear you two are still alive.

Tanaka:
You decided to come back!

Margery:
Ah, it's the duty of a Flame Haze.

Marcosias:
Oh, where's if? You went all pale and then rushed... ow!

Margery:
Anyway, I need you to get to the Crystal Altar.
There's something I wanna check.

Tanaka:
Already there! I ah... just thought you should know...

Sato:
Listen! We've been waiting at the Crystal Altar for you!
Now hurry up and tell us what to look for!

Marcosias:
Ha ha ... That's the way to tell her?

Margery:
Huh, all right. I'll pretend that I didn't hear you just snapped at me.
Take a look at the Palace of Stars.

Sato:
Palace of Stars?

Margery:
The huge castle floating in the sky. I'm pretty sure the little brat were in there.
But there's this strange Unrestricted Method around it.

Tanaka:
Yeah, that's right.

Margery:
Trace it back to find where part of the castle is coming from. And hurry!

Tanaka:
Right, we'll do!

Marcosias:
They're pretty reliable. A result of your influence I'd say.

Margery:
Guess so.

Tanaka:
Sato, she came back. Big Sister actually came back!

Sato:
Yeah, she sure did. She just comes and goes.
Right there!

Margery:
Play one more [for Eita]!

Marcosias:
Hey, play one more pretty Margery!

Margery:
Please Dear. Will you play one for me?

Marcosias:
Hey play one more pretty Margery!

Margery, Marcosias:
Goodbye and goodnight!

Professor:
Aaaaaaah! Why has my devices stopped functioning!?

Domino:
The devices that powers our special Unrestricted Method...
It appears to be broken.

Professor:
This can't be happening!

Robot Rinne:
[xxx ... ]

Sydonay:
It seems the Chanter of Elegies has returned.

Bel-Peol:
Oh well, why do Flame Hazes have a tendency to smash any new experiments they encounter?

Sydonay:
If she's come this far, then pretty soon she's gonna be the destruction to Hecate.
I think I'll go and greet her.

Bel-Peol:
Then I guess I'll have to go say hello to our first two guests.

Wirhelmina:
Indeed, it appears that we've been saved by the Chanter of Elegies.

Shana:
Yeah. She's here!

Wirhelmina:
This energy... Judge of Paradoxes.

Margery:
Hello there. Been a while, wouldn't you say?

Sydonay:
I prefer that you'd not get in our way.

Marcosias:
Ha... Can't agree to that. Not after all the weird things you guys have been doing!

Margery:
Today isn't a day for backing down. We're swimming in power right now.
Why don't we make this fight to remember?

Sydonay:
All right, then... Let's end this before we grow to fond of each other.

Wirhelmina:
You should go on.
We'll be okay as long as one of us makes it.
I hope you know what your answer is by now.
And will you indeed destroy it?

Shana:
I won't do it.

Wirhelmina:
Then you're willing to have the world thrown out of balance?

Shana:
I won't let it. Wirhelmina, I am the Flaming-Haired Blazing-Eyed Hunter. But, I'm also Shana.
My mission is clear, but I will not destroy the Mystes, Yuji! They are the same! And without him, I am not me!
I am not only a Flame Haze, I am Shana, with the Flaming-Hair and Blazing-Eyes and I fight for my beliefs!
That is my answer.

Wirhelmina:
Then go on ahead. If you've made a decision, I indeed have nothing more to say to you.

Shana:
Wirhelmina...

Wirhelmina:
I faith in you... without reservation or doubt, I do indeed believe in you.

Alastor:
Then we're off. We shall meet again, Specialist of Everything, Tiara of Dreams and Illusions.

Bel-Peol:
Oh, how sad to see you running away from me.

Wirhelmina:
Indeed, I am to be your opponent.

Tiamat:
Commence battle.

Bel-Peol:
Lovely. You and I are gonna have some fun.

Shana:
Alastor, you asked me what I wanted to do with Yuji, or more like what I wanted him to do.
I still don't know yet.

Alastor:
I see.

Shana:
And yet... I love... Yuji... That's all I do know.

Alastor:
Hmm...

Shana:
Yes. That's enough! I can fight with just that!

Yuji:
Then... your name is Shana. That's what I call you.
Stop saying you're only a Flame Haze!

Hecate:
Shana... Flaming-Haired Blazing-Eyed Flame Haze...

Yuji:
Yes... I gave her that name.
Since then, the Blazing Eyed Hunter has been called... Shana.

Shana:
Yuji...

Yuji:
Now I see... She protected me because she's Shana!

Hecate:
Because she's Shana...

Yuji:
Right. She's not just a Flame Haze. But I was...
I was the one who only saw her as a Flame Haze! It was me!

Shana:
Yuji!

Yuji:
Shana!

Hecate:
An obstacle...

Shana:
Yuji... I'm coming for you.



Shakugan no Shana, final episode: Crimson Thoughts.
At that moment, her smile, from the girl stepping into the flames.
