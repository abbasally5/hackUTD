  A heartbeat that lasts for eternity, lives consumed in soundless balls of fire.
No one can tell when the world is displaced and the flames of the Crimson World sweep over all.


Yuji:
I knew I was going to leave this world before too long, but I also knew that I was Yuji Sakai.
And even though one day no one will remember me, the power of my existence helped save Ike and the others.
I was satisfied with that, and I was glad I could do some good before I disappear.
I thought I understood what was going on, but the truth was... I didn't know anything.
Everything was just beginning, including my ties with Shana.

Let's see... Where are those coffee spoons?

Shana:
That Torche's flame is about to go out. But then, it recovered.
How? It's impossible.

Alastor:
Hmm... It may have something to do with the Treasure inside.

Shana:
So what kind of Treasure? You don't mean...

Alastor:
The Midnight Lost Child.

Shana:
Is that possible?

Alastor:
I agree. It isn't credible that something with such value would just appear.
But if it's true. Then it's even more reason why we cannot let the Hunter
acquire it. We'll need to be watchful as events unfold.

Yuji:
Sorry about the wait. Here. What?

Shana:
Nothing.

Yuji:
It's starting to rain.

Shana:
I can see that.

Yuji:
Wanna come inside?

Shana:
Huh? The house?

Yuji:
Yeah. You're getting soaked. First of all, if you're watching over me, I think you wanna be by my side.

Shana:
True.

Yuji:
Doesn't that make sense?

Shana:
It's not something you need to brag about!

Yuji:
I-I wasn't bragging about it. I was just wondering.

Alastor:
Flame Hazes are not bothered by weather conditions.

Shana:
Okay. Let's go.

Yuji:
Sure, okay.
My mom's sleeping on the main floor. So, just don't make any loud noises.
You['ll] use that bed. I'm gonna go sleep in my dad's study.

Shana:
Hey, if I came in here to guard you, what are you doing sleep in another room?

Yuji:
Ah, because...

Alastor:
This was your suggestion. Sleep here.

Yuji:
W-what are you doing!?

Shana:
I'm getting changed... obviously.

Yuji:
Sure, but... Look, is there some place you...?

Alastor:
What are you getting so [rattled] about? You've nothing to fear.

Shana:
Hide while I change!

Yuji:
Ah... okay.

Shana:
Don't peek or I'll clobber you!

Yuji:
Man, you're testing...

Shana:
I said move!

Yuji:
Don't rush me. It's... something I didn't expect.

Shana:
What is...?

Yuji:
I think you're embarrassed about this, too.
No p.j.s?

Shana:
I told you not peeking!

Yuji:
I wasn't. I was just asking if you have any pajamas.

Shana:
Well, I don't. Just my underclothes. Alastor cleans my body with his flame. So I don't have to change very often.

Yuji:
Wow, that sounds convenient. Oh, I have a jersey in my draw beside my bed.
You can use that. By the way, why didn't you have any bags?

Shana:
Almost everything I have is with me.

Yuji:
Where?

Shana:
My Night Cape, a black cape especially for Flame Hazes.

Yuji:
That sounds like magic.

Shana:
Yeah, thank Alastor for that.

Yuji:
That's incredible. So, what kind of person is Alastor?

Alastor:
I am not human. I am a Lord of the Crimson World.

Yuji:
What? You are one of those Denizens? The thing that [suck up] existences?

Alastor:
There are those who consume existence without restraint. And then there are those like me, who oppose them.
This world is filled with the power of existence, something the Crimson World lacks. That is why the Denizens are drawn here.
They seek out this power, because it can be used to fulfill their desires.

Yuji:
Ah. And so where did these Denizens come from?

Shana:
From the Crimson World. The world next to this one that cannot be reached by ordinary means.

Yuji:
Like a different dimension?

Alastor:
That's a good definition as any. But toying with the power of existence will eventually upset the balance between the two worlds.
Thus, the need for Flame Hazes. It is our task to prevent this from happening.

Yuji:
It sounds like there are more than just you two out there.

Shana:
There are other Flame Hazes. But we are on our own.

Alastor:
Their reasons for fighting and methods vary from one to the other.
There are even times when Flame Hazes will battle each other.
Some of them are easily agitated.

Yuji:
Oh. I think it would make more sense if everyone cooperated.

Chigusa:
Yu-chan, what's going on?

Yuji:
Nothing. I'm just cleaning my room.

Chigusa:
Oh. Well, it's late. So do it quickly.

Yuji:
Yeah. Gotcha.

Shana:
I should've punched him another ten times!

Alastor:
I don't understand. That's only a Torch.

Shana:
Your point!?

Alastor:
Would you be embarrassed being naked in front of a rock or a tree? This is out of character for you.

Shana:
Look, I just felt (some) uncomfortable!
You feel it?

Alastor:
Yes, a Flame Haze...

Shana:
Do you think it's here after Friagne?

Alastor:
Even if it is, I'm sure it'll leave when it finds out that we were here first.
After all, it is well known the encounters between Flame Hazes never turn out well.

Margery:
Your best room and don't tell me it's not available.

Hotel staff:
Y-yes, ma'am...

Margery:
Oh, come on. This is the best room in the city!? I'm so grateful I couldn't wait.

Marcosias:
Why not charm some young star and giving you a nice place to sleep again, hey, hey!? My Dear Mrs. Princess Margery Daw!

Margery:
Quiet Stupid Marco!
Damn! What an absurd little city to wander into. The Corpse Collecting bastard!
There's a Denizen as well as another Flame Haze in this [dive].
In some place, scattered Torches. It makes me very difficult to sense [where he is].

Marcosias:
Then why don't you deal with the Denizen or the Flame Haze first!? Smash them! Burn them!

Margery:
That's not a bad idea. This place is a joke! These bottles are tiny. And it's nothing but cheap booze!

Marcosias:
This is a wonderful hotel!
Then you don't drink, you don't snore!
Which means [I'll relax] maybe a little get some of sleep!

Friagne:
I feel it. It's a Flame Haze. Unfortunately, this means I have to postpone my hunt for that Mystes.

Marianne:
Master... Another Flame Haze... As if that, one with the fiery hair [wasn't enough].

Friagne:
Calm yourself, Marianne. I've almost acquired enough of the power I need for you.
I won't let anyone interfere with the plan.
When all this is over, you will no longer be a mere Rinne.
You will be an existence and will live in the world as you deserve.

Marianne:
You have already done so much for me, master.

Friagne:
No. It's not enough.
If not from my powers, you would vanish in a matter of days.
That's too transient to be a real existence.

Marianne:
I think you and I share a special bond, one that can't be defined by words alone.

Friagne:
Oh, Marianne. Marianne. You said the most wonderful things to me.
However... I must see this affair through to the end. That's why I came here. The reason I pursue existences.
I'm doing it for you. Everything I do is for your sake. Oh, what a sublime sight. Look, so many existences out there.

Marianne:
Master...

Friagne:
Don't worry. Everything is going to be just fine...

Shana:
Why...? I'm sleepy...

Alastor:
You haven't been getting much rest lately. I think you should go inside the house to sleep.

Shana:
Okay.


Yuji:
My pillow smells nice... Oh, it's only you, Shana... What's the...!?

Alastor:
Hm... I see you're awake.

Yuji:
What did she do in my bed!?

Alastor:
Nothing for you to be concerned about.

Yuji:
What are you talking about!? I'm still shaking!

Shana:
How dare you!?

Yuji:
Stop! Wait! I didn't do anything, honestly!

Alastor:
Don't you remember? You were tired, so I suggested you go into the house to sleep.
It was your decision, half asleep I might add, to crawl into his bed. I don't see the problem.
Normally, this wouldn't bother you.

Shana:
Right. There is no problem. Because you're nothing but a Torch.

Yuji:
And... that makes it okay?

Shana:
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

Yuji:
Okay, then, ah... Let's get ready for school. You get change while I go and wash up, okay?

Shana:
Why...?

Yuji:
This is crazy. I didn't realize how cute she was. Oh, just forget it!

Mr. Kondo:
Hey you may get succeed some energy out there!

Student:
Oh, what the hell's wrong with him? He's sure desperate about something.

I don't know. Kondo's always been kinda weird.

I guess he looks like a pervert.

Mr. Kondo:
Quiet! Save your breath for running! Damn it.
Look at her. I bet she thinks she's smart making fun of the other teachers.
She won't get away without my class. I'll teach her a lesson.

Ike:
What is this? [How we can run rough so all day?]

Yuji:
Yeah, for something funny here.
One good thing, at least she won't be getting in trouble with the teachers out here.

Shana:
Why...?

Mr. Kondo:
Damnz (it)! She hasn't even broken a sweat! Why isn't it getting to work?

Student:
An ass hole! It's getting a kick out of this.

This is really pissing me off!

Yoshida!

Kazumi!

Mr. Kondo:
You! What are you doing?

Student:
Please Mr. Kondo, you've got to let Kazumi rest!
Everybody knows that she's anemic!

Mr. Kondo:
That's just an excuse to slack off! Physical fitness demands effort!

Yuji:
Mr. Kondo, that's enough! I think this is a little overblown! [overboard!]

Mr. Kondo:
Sakai! I'm doing this for your own good!

Shana:
Move it, jerk.

Mr. Kondo:
Were you little fag!?

Shana:
This drill is stupid. It is tiresome, and I fail to see the purpose.
Explain to me the point behind running around in circle.

Mr. Kondo:
Were you...? Hirai, do you understand how serious it is for a student to kick a teacher!?

Yuji:
You're all right?

Yoshida:
Yeah...

Mr. Kondo:
You are a problem student! You're suspended. No! Expel!

Shana:
[Whatever, how xxx/What an impulsive toad]...

Mr. Kondo:
Stop talking at me like that!

Yuji:
She's actually thinking of hitting you?

Mr. Kondo:
Well, say something!

Sato:
Hirai's gonna pop the teacher. Let's help her.

Tanaka:
Right.

Yuji:
This is gonna get ugly. It's too late to stop her now.

Mr. Kondo:
Are you even listening to me!?

Yuji:
Kick him!
Thanks, Shana. Mr. Kondo, are you okay?
It's dangerous just wandering on in the track like that.
Right, everyone?

Students:
Ah... yeah.

That's what happened.

I saw the whole thing.

Me too. Hirai's a really fast runner.

A traffic accident, man?

Mr. Kondo:
[Sabotage!]

Yuji:
So you wanna threaten him? Shake him up a little bit?

Shana:
I see you just happen to be on the track.

Yuji:
Mr. Kondo, you should be a little more careful in the future. Can we go now?

Mr. Kondo:
Free period, kids... Do whatever you want...

Students:
Wow, Sakai, all of a sudden, you're bursting with confidence.

You were awesome, Hirai!

That was great!

Yuji:
Things would beginnig to look up. For I thought, what I didn't know was that Shana was starting to feel a little uneasy.

Shana:
I was going to punch him in a face.

Yuji:
Kick him!

Alastor:
I'm not trying to heap praise about him, but I think he showed superb judgment.
Without him, you would've struck the teacher. I believe that would have resulted in severe repercussions.

Shana:
Dare he! Giving me orders! Why...? Why...?

Alastor:
What is it about the mere Torch that has you so upset?

Shana:
That what I'd like to know.

Margery:
Oh, it is so exasperating. I'm sensing a Denizen and a Flame Haze, but I can't lock in on the Corpse Collector.

Marcosias:
He probably planned that way. He's got you this time, partner.

Margery:
I'm gonna go in a little deeper.

Marcosias:
You sure about this? We're not the first who arrive. In a way, we're trespassing here.

Margery:
Who cares? If they wanna complain, I'll just have to kick their teeth down their throat.

Marcosias:
Sounds good to me! I'm ready anytime you are!

Margery:
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John! Cover all corners and find the ghost who disrupts our dreams!

Alastor:
It appears they still are here, even though they must have sensed our presence.
It's an Unrestricted Method used for searching a large area.
Are you sure? This could end in a battle if you're not careful.

Shana:
At least I won't have to think if I'm in the middle of a fight.

Margery:
Marco.

Marcosias:
They've noticed us. Cancel your spell! They're [riding] a fight!

Margery:
[That suits me] just fine. Be sealed!

Shana:
There they are!

Margery:
Flaming Hair!

Marcosias:
Blazing Eyes!

Shana:
What do you think you're doing here?

Margery:
My... What a rude little girl, not even a hello.

Marcosias:
Long time no see, Flame of the Heavens!

Shana:
Alastor, do you know these two?

Alastor:
Marcosias, the Claws and Fangs of Violation.
And Margery Daw, the Chanter of Elegies.
They're tough, and they won't back down.

Margery:
If you two just pack up and quietly leave this city, I'll gladly see you off.

Shana:
We were here first. I'm taking out Friagne myself!

Marcosias:
So that's how it is! It's that pervert with the doll fetish!

Margery:
I'll have to deal with him later. We've come here for the Corpse Collector.

Alastor:
The Corpse Collector!? But he's an exception.
He actually goes out of this way, not to upset the balance.

Margery:
Exception!? There are no innocence in the Crimson World!
I plan on killing all of them! Really what to do with them is to kill, kill, kill!

Marcosias:
She's what you might call a devoted Flame Haze!

Alastor:
Your hatred for others is blind that you tell the truth. You blood thirsty bastards!

Marcosias:
Pretty strong words!

Shana:
What do you say, Alastor? Can we fight them now?

Alastor:
Wait...

Margery:
I take it you're not going to leave.

Marcosias:
Strike them down without mercy, My Beloved Goblet Margery Daw!
The reason this place is filled with Torches is because they let that Denizen alone.
They're incompetent!

Margery:
Indeed. Too bad they won't be more of the challenge.

Shana:
Get ready for a supply.

Alastor:
Wait. Don't be reckless.

Margery:
Not bad...

Marcosias:
She's very slick.

Alastor:
That's the Toga, a gown made of flames. It's her specialty. Be cautious.

Margery:
What a lively little brat! You missed! Let's see if you've been let me know.

Alastor:
Be calm. Think first.

Shana:
I don't have to think of anything! I don't! Because I'm a Flame Haze!

Margery:
Missed again.

Marcosias:
Surprise!

Margery:
A fox bride's [electrical] shower.

Marcosias:
You'll be dead within a next three seconds!

Margery:
Are you the real Flame Hair Blazing Eyes?

Marcosias:
You're not as strong as I thought you'd be.

Margery:
Enough of this. One final attack and then I'll let her go.

Marcosias:
Yeah. This isn't any fun, get her a big blast and then I'll call quits.

Shana:
This can't be happening... I must get up?

Margery:
A pain of a life, a hasted strife!

Shana:
Get up.

Margery:
Double Solomon Grundy...

Alastor:
Watch out! Move!

Margery:
There! Game over!

Shana:
Why...? Why!?


Two girls struggle with [in the turmoil.]
Shana's still confused, while Kazumi deals with her feelings for someone else.
Meanwhile the Hunter and the Chanter of Elegies crash.
