  A heartbeat that lasts for eternity, lives consumed in soundless balls of fire.
No one can tell when the world is displaced and the flames of the Crimson World sweep over all.


Yoshida:
You're one of them...?

Shana:
That's right. I am called a Flame Haze.
My task in this world is to fight the Denizens.

Khamsin:
See how the world really is.

Yoshida:
I can't take this... It's too much...

Shana:
Yuji... Where are you?

Alastor:
Shana.

Shana:
It appears your help is needed to fix this city's distortion. Come with me. Quickly!

Sato:
Then, you are the Mystes Margery's been talking about.

Yuji:
Yeah. And you. You're with the Chanter of Elegies.

Sato:
Right. Tanaka, too.

Yuji:
I see, surprising.

Sato:
That's exactly what I was thinking.
If you really are a Mystes, then... the real Yuji Sakai...

Yuji:
Yuji Sakai... is dead. That's right. I'm dead.

Sato:
You are... You're pretty tough.

Yuji:
Sure? You think so?

Sato:
Not too many people could stay calm. You've got guts.

Yuji:
I'm not like that. I've always worried about how people would react if they found out the truth.
Tonight, for instance. That's right. I gotta go find Yoshida.

Sato:
Yoshida?

Yuji:
She's found out that I'm a Torch. She was completely shocked by it.
I need to explain all of this. Though I guess that won't change anything.
A fact is a fact.

Professor:
Domino, I can see the Whole Sacred Chapel rising before me.
Can I assume it's almost fully operational?

Domino:
Indeed, your assumption is correct, Professor!
At this point, I am pleased to report that Flame Hazes seem to have absolutely no idea what it is!

Khamsin:
You know, I don't think its purpose is to actually increase the distortion.
More likely than not, the distortion is nearly a side-effect from its other operation.

Behemoth:
The Seeker... does have a reputation for doing unnecessary things.

Khamsin:
We'll just observe for now.

Margery:
Damn it! How much longer do I have to deal with these pests.
And why haven't Keisaku and Eita reached the Crystal Altar yet?

Marcosias:
I'm not taking up anything from that whacked-out crazy Professor!
But he's not shy of moving his Rinne all over the place.

Margery:
Now what...?

Marcosias:
That reminds me. There's another Flame Haze in the mix.

Margery:
I wonder if he has something to do with the Seeker.

Marcosias:
Why don't we find him and put him on the spot?

Margery:
Sounds good. Then, shall we go?

Marcosias:
Climb on!

Sato:
What are those things?

Yuji:
These Rinnes don't have anything to do with them. Another to Shana.

Sato:
It's the other Flame Haze.
Margery said something about another one showing up in this city.

Yuji:
It's his. This is his. This thing showed everything to Yoshida.

Sato:
Sakai, where are you going?
Wait, I've gotta get to the Crystal Altar.
He's... a Torch...

Yoshida:
Yukari is a Flame Haze? And she knows about everything happening in this city. And about Sakai...
She knows everything and yet she still... And yet she still cares for him...

Shana:
Let's go!

Yoshida:
I'm fine. I can keep up.

Shana:
Good.

Yoshida:
I can keep up.

Khamsin:
Ah, it's Chanter of Elegies. So you were the one who was fighting.

Behemoth:
Hmm... explains the aggressive presence we sensed.

Margery:
Oh, it's only you two, geezers. How boring...

Marcosias:
You wouldn't have anything to do with that crackpot Professor.

Behemoth:
Hmm... I take it you're just as puzzled as we are over not being able to detect the Seeker.

Margery:
Of course. He must be using some kind of trick. But what?

Khamsin:
We're trying to figure... Oh, what have we here?
Seems to be a Mystes.

Margery:
He's not involved. Don't worry.

Marcosias:
He looks pretty mad for some reason.

Yuji:
This belong to you?

Khamsin:
Yes. If I'm not mistaken you're Yuji Sakai.

Behemoth:
Who would have thought you'd end up being a Mystes?
I feel bad for what that young lady had to go through.

Yuji:
Why? Why did you have to get her involved?

Khamsin:
We need someone to cooperate with us. And she was the best qualified.

Yuji:
Qualified? You gave her this Treasure based on that kind of nonsense!?

Shana:
Yuji...

Yoshida:
Sakai...

Yuji:
Can you imagine how shocked she must have been, when she saw how the world really looked?
She didn't know anything about all of this! So why did you have to drag her into this world? Why!? Why!?

Khamsin:
Be calm. I can see that she is a very important person to you.

Yuji:
Yoshida's a person of great kindness. She wasn't supposed to come to this world.
She should have stayed behind in the world I can't go back to...

Yoshida:
Sakai...

Yuji:
Yoshida... Sorry for everything.

Shana:
Oh Yuji...

Margery:
All right. We're very touched. That was a beautiful scene.
But let's try to focus on reality, shall we?

Khamsin:
Yes, she's right. I think I've got a grasp on the situation of the System.

Alastor:
Shana.

Shana:
Kazumi Yoshida has nothing to do with us!

Yuji:
That wasn't like Shana. Why'd she say that?

Khamsin:
About the Unrestricted System.
It's going to open a hole in space by utilizing the city's distortion.

Margery:
A hole in space?

Khamsin:
Yes. As if you took a piece out of a jigsaw puzzle. That's what it would look like.

Marcosias:
Sure, but why?

Alastor:
What meaning is there in doing something like that?

Behemoth:
Hmm... The Seeker has always done things that simply don't make much sense.

Khamsin:
In any case, it's clear the city is being affected by it.
We should begin the tuning as soon as possible.
As I explained yesterday, we'd like you to cooperate with us.

Yuji:
What cooperate? It's not fair to involve her in this.

Khamsin:
Unless we act, this city is only gonna get worse.

Yoshida:
Sakai, it's okay. I made a promise to Khamsin.
And I'm just fine now. I'm sorry for running off before.

Yuji:
Yoshida...

Khamsin:
Come here, please.
Ventricle of Qadesh.

Marcosias:
Hey! Nothing's happening!

Khamsin:
Yes, we seem to have a problem.

Behemoth:
Hmm... That Unrestricted System is preventing the numerous markings we placed in the city from moving.

Margery:
All that and now you say you can't do your tuning?

Khamsin:
That's right.

Margery:
Just a minute.

Tanaka:
Big Sister, can you hear me?

Margery:
Sure can. What took you so long?


Tanaka:
Sorry, I was held up.

Margery:
Forget that. Is the Crystal Altar working?

Tanaka:
Ah, just a moment. Umm...
There's a hole at the top of that Unrestricted System above the city.

Margery:
We know about that. Anything else?

Sato:
The System is spread across the city.
But the lines meet to a single location.

Margery:
Where?

Sato:
The riverbank. Maybe... the festival's main stage.

Margery:
The festival's main stage down by the river.
He says that's where the core of the Unrestricted System is.

Yuji:
I bet it's the tower!

Shana:
I don't sense anything.

Khamsin:
Come to think of it, the Seeker has a mechanical assistant working for him.
A Rinne comprised of machinery.

Margery:
It's called Domino, right?

Behemoth:
Hmm... I've forgotten about it.
It's not surprising we weren't able to sense his assistant.

Khamsin:
I'm sure destroying that Rinne would affect the Unrestricted System.

Margery:
Here, use this to reach me, just in case. Let's go, Marcosias!

Marcosias:
Tally Ho!

Alastor:
We should go as well.

Yuji:
Be careful.

Shana:
Usually, he'd say he was coming along.

Domino:
Professor! The basic value of the Whole Sacred Chapel is now within estimated range!
This means the requirements for the experiment have all been satisfied.

Professor:
How excellent! While we're at it, we'll head down to a trial experiment using a sample Unrestricted System that I so thoughtfully brought along.

Domino:
Oh, detecting incoming Flame Hazes!

Professor:
I see, just you prepare yourself and do something about them.
I, on the other hand, will proceed to our rendezvous point.
That's over, over and out.

Domino:
Alrighty!

Margery:
That's it.

Marcosias:
Hey, hey, already!?

Shana:
What just happened there?

Marcosias:
The Rinne...

Margery:
I see. Defensive Unrestricted Method is being used to deflect power of existence.

Domino:
Your attacks are ineffective against me! Begin transformation!

Marcosias:
Is there a point to all this?

Margery:
I don't know. But that deflection earlier has me a bit worried.
It's too dangerous to approach.
There's the lunatic nut. He's making his move.

Shana:
He was outside the city!

Khamsin:
Yes. He wasn't actually hiding from us at all.
That's why we weren't able to detect him.

Behemoth:
But how is he planning on entering the city?

Khamsin:
There's no doubt. He is coming closer.

Yuji:
That's it!

Professor:
Now, I've arrived in style.

Margery:
An airship...?

Khamsin:
The Seeker loves to be showy for no real reason.
I wouldn't be surprised if there's no meaning to his plan at all.

Yuji:
Hang on a second.

Khamsin:
What is it?

Yuji:
There could be a reason why he chose to come in from the air.
You said something earlier about removing a jigsaw piece from space.

Khamsin:
Yes, that's right.

Yuji:
Any chance that airship is the final piece?

Margery:
You know, the boy's theory has merit.

Yuji:
I think you should head to that space and forget about the robot.

Margery:
I bet the airship is protected with the same kind of defense mechanism.
Attacking it isn't goona work.

Yuji:
But if my theory is correct, any defensive measures would be affected by the System that made the hole.
Which would mean...

Margery:
The mechanism would have to be deactivated to get near the space.

Yuji:
Right.

Yoshida:
Sakai is incredible...

Khamsin:
And if needed, I'll stage an attack on the airship myself.

Marcosias:
Is he serious!?

Margery:
I sincerely hope he doesn't do that.

Shana:
I can't hear Yuji's voice... He's so far away...

Domino:
Okay! I finished transforming! Now, Flame Hazes, come at me!
There's no one there...?

Professor:
Behold, the climax and the grand finale!
Begin the experiment! Deactivate the Unrestricted Method!

Margery:
Ride a cock-horse to Banbury Cross.
She shall have music wherever she goes!

Professor:
Nooooo! Wait, Flame Hazes!

Margery:
He's still mad as a fruitcake.

Shana:
We can't let him get away with this.

Professor:
Damn them! I'm being fooled by wrongheaded thinkers who refuse to be enlightened.
Doooominoooo!

Domino:
Yes, sirree!

Professor:
It's time to use the special technique we prepared in case things way they're lying!

Margery:
What is that?

Marcosias:
This is getting too silly for me.

Margery:
I guess he wanted to try it.

Professor:
This really maneuver [xxx] the end!

Khamsin:
Please get out of the way. I'll finish him off.

Margery:
You will? The old man's gonna open fire!

Marcosias:
Run for it!

Shana:
What!?

Alastor:
Move! Now!

Professor:
Have I won the fight already?

Domino:
Perhaps it was pointless to combine like that? Ow, ow!

Professor:
I decide whether something is pointless or not! Escaaaaaaape!

Margery:
What in the world did he come here for?

Marcosias:
I don't even wanna know.

Yuji:
Yoshida, are you all right?

Yoshida:
Yes...

Yuji:
Ah, sorry. Yoshida?

Yoshida:
Sakai... You're so warm... Are you... ever gonna get better?

Yuji:
No. The real me is already dead.
The me right here... isn't even human.

Yoshida:
No, Sakai. You're human. I know it, for a fact.

Yuji:
Human? But why?

Yoshida:
Because... you're so warm... Your body... and your heart...

Yuji:
That makes me human?

Yoshida:
That's what I like about you more than anything else.
I... I love you, Sakai...

Khamsin:
Now, the Ventricle of Qadesh.
Young lady, please imagine the city as you know it.
That image will correct the distortion and fine-tune the process.

Yoshida:
Okay. My city...

Yuji:
I feel it. It's the city. The one I have lived in ever since I was born.

Behemoth:
Hmm... This is good. The images are very warm...

Yuji:
I... lived here.

Yoshida:
No, Sakai... You're human.

Shana:
I can tell... Yuji... Yuji's not gonna come with me! What am I gonna do?

Wirhelmina:
What seems to be bothering you?

Shana:
Wirhelmina...

Bel-Peol:
I thought I warned you not to overdo things.
Ah, Seeker, you were only responsible for the preparations.

Professor:
Well, the experiment achieved full results, didn't it?
I really don't appreciate you nagging me for success.

Bel-Peol:
You're right. Everything's going so well.


It's been a while since Shana last saw her old teacher.
But Wirhelmina is sensing some changes in her.
And then, she gives Shana an ultimatum.
Next episode: Heartless Wirhelmina.
