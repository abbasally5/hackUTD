  A heartbeat that lasts for eternity, lives consumed in soundless balls of fire.
No one can tell when the world is displaced and the flames of the Crimson World sweep over all.


Shana:
Anyway, you can't go after Yuji!

Yoshida:
Sure I can! You are being completely unfair about this!
But I'm gonna tell Sakai that I love him, and you'll be out of the picture!

Shana:
It is not unfair! You can't go after him! 'Cause Yuji is my...! Yuji's my... what?
Believe me, it's better for Yuji to be with me than you.

Yoshida:
That is not true! Sakai should be the one to decide that!

Shana:
But you don't even know anything about Yuji!

Yoshida:
I'll get to know him!

Shana:
You can't!

Yoshida:
Why not?

Shana:
Because I say so!

Yoshida:
I said what I had to say.

Shana:
Forget it. I won't lose to you.

Sydonay:
There's no doubt. The Midnight Lost Child is inside that Mystes...

Shana:
Here. This one's for you.

Yuji:
Is anything the matter, Shana?

Shana:
What do you mean?

Yuji:
Don't take this wrong, but... sometimes it kinda seems like you're irritated about something.

Shana:
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! You're going to ruin the taste for me.
No way. I'm not going to lose to her.
That's not the way you're supposed to eat melon bread.
Like this. First you bite off the crispy bun, and then you savor the spongy soft filling.
Another bite of the crispy part, followed by more spongy filling.
This allows you to balance both textures equally. You got it?

Yuji:
Er, yeah, sure.

Shana:
Good. What is this spice they've added? The shop has no respect for the natural taste of real melon bread.

Yuji:
You really love it, don't you? When I think of you, I always think about how much you love melon bread.

Shana:
Love?

Yuji:
Yeah.

I don't know whole a lot about Shana.
But I do know two things for certain. That she's a Flame Haze and that she sure loves melon bread.
There's no doubt those two things are very important to who she is.
And I'm also sure there's a pretty good reason why she loves those buns so much.

Wilhelmina:
And that about sums it up, Flame of Heaven.

Alastor:
Well, what do you think?

Wilhelmina:
She is most suitable indeed. She excels at both her studies and the martial arts.
She quickly applies what she learns, knows her limitations and has a merciless work ethic.
Indeed, it's rare to find such self-respect combined with a natural ability to fight.
It's pointless to even compare her to the others we've seen. She is indeed an individual of exceptional talent.

Alastor:
Unexpected results from a girl we encountered by happenstance.

Wilhelmina:
The unfortunate incidents were a coincidence, as was my appearance on the scene.
Likewise, my bringing her here to the Palace of Heaven's Road.

Alastor:
Hmm... What is it? You seem uneasy about something.

Wilhelmina:
You must be aware of this, indeed as I am.
But I get the feeling she has another side. A side she is not showing us.
I feel indeed she is keeping a secret to herself. One that she has decided not to reveal to us.
Something in the darkest corners of her heart. A mystery that no one must know about.

Alastor:
You're right. But you could say the same things for every one of us.

Wilhelmina:
Yes.

Indeed, all this time, and you still haven't landed a blow on Shiro.

Girl:
Hello, Wilhelmina. I guess you're back from shopping.

Wilhelmina:
Yes.

Girl:
Oh, did you bring me a treat again?

Wilhelmina:
Indeed, your fault, not his that it was ruined.

Girl:
I can't fight in this stupid outfit! The skirt is too long, it keeps getting in my way when I kick!
I can't keep up with Shiro wearing this!

Wilhelmina:
In the world that lies outside the Palace of Heaven's Road, that is the attire of many warriors of outstanding ability and skill.

Girl:
Yeah, but...

Wilhelmina:
Indeed, I have personally witnessed to many individuals moving and fighting at top speed in just such an outfit.
Though they have fewer problems than you do.

Ah!

Girl:
Meh! You're not being fair, Wilhelmina!

Wilhelmina:
"Fair" has nothing to do with it. I'm here to judge you.

Girl:
Crimson Denizens that eat people, and the Flame Hazes who battle them...
Is the outside world really like that?

This time for sure.

I told you. I'm okay.

Wilhelmina:
So where did that hurt the most?

Girl:
My ribs on the right.

Wilhelmina:
Do you need treatment?

Girl:
No, thanks.
Ow!

Wilhelmina:
That looks very painful to me.

Girl:
Anyone would jump into the air if you poked me in the side like that!

Wilhelmina:
That behavior is quite rude, indeed.

Girl:
Good night.

Wilhelmina:
Good night... And rest easy.
There's plenty of time before it happens.

Girl:
I can't sleep, Alastor. Could you tell me my favorite story again?
The Flame-Haired Blazing-Eyed Hunter...

Are you going shopping today?

Wilhelmina:
Yes, that's right. I'll be back this evening.
Your lunch is in the microwave. Indeed, you know what to do.

The only thing left to pick up... is indeed one of those buns she likes.

Tiamat:
Unrestricted Method.

Wilhelmina:
Analysis confirmed. But I'm only picking up an extremely weak entity nearby.

Tiamat:
Be alert.

Wilhelmina:
Acknowledged. I've been extra cautious lately indeed.
I conclude that nothing has changed and it's safe to make the assumption that our location is still unknown to those who might be hunting us.

Tiamat:
Carelessness is your enemy.

Wilhelmina:
I understand. However, the Palace of Heaven's Road is undetectable.
Indeed, not even a master of Unrestricted Methods could find it.

Vine:
Putting a net here wasn't that bad idea. Palace of Heaven's Road here I come!
You... Thousand Ordinances...



Vine:
I never expected to see you in Asia, Thousand Ordinances.

Orgon:
It's not but unusual considering I've been sent here by a leader of the Bal Masque, Bel-Peol to be specific.

Vine:
Is there an operation underway?

Orgon:
Even someone like you must know about many brothers were falling to its prey one after the other.

Vine:
Yes. There's a powerful Flame Haze somewhere out there.

Orgon:
Many of our fallen brothers were very skillful, which means our enemy is truly a force to be reckoned with.
Any information?

Vine:
I'm so close to finding the Place of Heaven's Road. I'm not going to let him claim the glory after all my hard work!

Orgon:
You were... You know something!

Vine:
Ah, yes. An enemy just a moment ago.

Orgon:
Oh, and what kind of enemy did you find?

Vine:
There's no doubt. I've found a Flame Haze down there.
We could get information on your quarry by interrogating it.

Orgon:
Very well... However powerful this enemy might be, I will track it down and crush it!

Vine:
Excellent! I am truly grateful for your assistance.
I just hope he doesn't kill the Flame Haze before it can lead me to the Palace.

Girl:
How can I beat Shiro?
That's it!
That's to last. Shiro taught me that one of the basic rules is to catch your opponent off guard.

Bel-Peol:
Vine, the Drifting Eye... Help me. Avenge the loss of your brothers.
The tools of destruction, the pathetic Flame Hazes must pay.
Slaughter them. Slaughter them all.

Vine:
Lady Bel-Peol... Your patience is about to be rewarded. I'm on the verge of accomplishing something magnificent. A truly momentous advance at hand.

Wilhelmina:
Which one... oh well... hmmm… mmmm… mmm… er… maybe... No... Indeed I shouldn't spoil her. But she's... No. Oh maybe just one...

Tiamat:
Incoming.

Wilhelmina:
Roger that, confirmed.

Tiamat:
Leave now.

Wilhelmina:
Abandoning baggage, prepare for immediate exit of area.

Orgon:
I don't believe we have met, Flame Haze...

Wilhelmina:
Orgon, the Thousand Ordinances.

Tiamat:
Correct.

Orgon:
What's wrong? Why aren't you changing to prepare for battle?
Could it be you are a novice, newly contracted and unsure of your powers?
Humph. That's why I give the fullest mean to a lightweight like Vine. Well, now that I'm here I'll find out what you're made of.
First, have a taste of Hogier! Next, behold the power of La Hire!
If you're not going to reveal your true appearance, there is no need for me to employ the remainder of my four cards.

Wilhelmina:
Ah yes, that's the Thousand Ordinance's power, Legion.

Girl:
I got him! Uh okay, I bet that was a surprise.



Vine:
W-what is that? I... I found it! The Palace of Heaven's Road!

Wilhelmina:
We have a real emergency indeed.

Vine:
This is fantastic! The world has started to turn in my favor!

Tenmokuikko:
Mighty warrior... I am here to fight you...


The Crimson Denizens attack.
Joined by Tenmokuikko, the most powerful Mystes of all.
As the Palace shakes, a young girl becomes a Flame Haze.
