  A heartbeat that lasts for eternity, lives consumed in soundless balls of fire.
No one can tell when the world is displaced and the flames of the Crimson World sweep over all.


Margery:
I think we're in for the hell of a good time here, Marcosias!

Marcosias:
Yeah! It's been ages since we battled a real knockdown fight!
Margery Daw, My Beautiful Goblet, let's kill him!

Alastor:
That's Supreme Throne, Hecate.
She's one of the leaders of Bal Masque.

“頂の座”ヘカテー。
仮装舞踏会 （バル・マスケ）を率いる者の一人だ。

Shana:
Well, I don't care who she is!
Give Yuji back to me!

誰だろうと関係ない。
悠二を返してもらう。

Yuji:
Shana...

Hecate:
You belong to me now.
We've already opened ourselves to each other.

あなたは私のもの。
もう器を合わせたのだから。

Alastor:
This production of power of the existence...
She seems to be the core of the entire system.

彼女がこの膨大な存在の力を生み出す仕掛けの核のようだ。

Shana:
I'll defeat her and stop it!
Plan B!

こいつを倒して止める！
だったら！

Alastor:
As I feared, the only way to win this is to stop Supreme Throne.
We must hurry! At this rate, the city itself may collapse!

やはり、頂の座を止めぬことにはどうしようもない！
急がねば！このままでは、街が崩壊するやもしれぬ！

Shana:
But what can we do to stop it?!

でも、どうすれば…

Yuji:
Misaki City... No! I have to do something!

岬市が… 駄目だ、何とかしなきゃ…

Hecate:
Ha..., your thoughts are fulfilling me...
It's something I've never been able to achieve before...
No matter how many I touched, how many ambitions I felt...

あなたの思いが満ちて来る…
今までどれほど器を合わせ、欲望を飲み込んでも得られなかったものが…

Yuji:
You're just...

君は…

Bel-Peol:
It's a shame. I think we're done.
I have to go see how Hecate is doing.

悪いが、ここまでだよ。
ヘカテーのところへ行ってやらなきゃね。

Wilhelmina:
A little longer, your presence is still required.

もう少し、相手をしてもらうのであります。

Tiamat:
Continue battle.

戦闘続行。

Bel-Peol:
How persistent!

しつこいねえ。

Sydonay:
Having unlimited energy has its own problems...

ちっ、燃料がありすぎるというのも厄介だな。

Margery:
You're right. Conceivably we could fight forever...

そうね。 永久に戦えそうだわ。

Marcosias:
Thousand Changes, is this what you guys really want?

"千変"よぉ、これがてめぇらの狙いってか？

Sydonay:
For myself, I'd be happy just to have my Hecate achieve fulfillment.

俺は、俺のへカテーが満足できりゃそれでいいのさ。

Marcosias:
Heh, another weirdo...

けっ！　変態野郎め。

Margery:
You don't look like you play with dolls.

お人形遊びってガラ？

Tanaka:
What's going on?!

どうなってんだ！？

Sato:
Hey! Look there!

おい、見ろ！

Tanaka:
What are those?!

な、何だ！？

Yoshida:
It's okay. They'll come back. They will.
Sakai and Yukari, they've got to make it.

大丈夫。 帰ってくる。 絶対。
坂井君もゆかりちゃんも帰ってくる！

Shana:
I can't get any closer!

全然近寄れない！

Alastor:
You must get Yuji Sakai out of there!
Separate her from the Midnight Lost Child, then we should be able to stop this madness!

坂井悠二をあそこから出すのだ！ 
零時迷子を切り離せば全てを止められるはずだ！

Shana:
I'm on it!

やってみる！

Yuji:
Are you saying... you're satisfied fulfilling yourself with... my memories... and my thoughts?

君は、僕の記憶や思いで自分を満たして、それで満足してるってのか？

Hecate:
I've always desired it. I've prayed for it.

私はずっと求め、祈っていた。

Yuji:
For this?

こんなことを？

Hecate:
Yes.
Once I made contact, I suddenly realized... that this is what I was looking for.

そう。
あなたに触れて、やっとわかった。私が求めていたもの。


Yuji:
You're Shana! Stop saying you're only a Flame Haze!
And I'm not only a Torch! I'm Yuji Sakai!

Hecate:
And now I know who I am.
I've been searching for myself.
And now I know, I have proof, I really do exist.

それは私。私が求めていたのは私。
確かに存在している私自身。

Yuji:
You're right.
When we first made contact, you really were empty.

確かに、
最初に器が重なった時から君は空っぽだった。

Hecate:
But... not now.
I'm no longer an empty vessel.
I'm completely fulfilled.

今は…違う。
私はこんなにも満たされている。

Yuji:
With my memories...

僕の思いで…

Hecate:
My memories now.

今は私の思い。

Yuji:
You're mistaken.
There's no point of filling yourself with other people's memories.
That's not you.

違う。
人の思いで自分を一杯にしたって意味ないよ。
そんなのは君じゃない。

Hecate:
But you're just a Torch. And you're filled with Yuji Sakai's memories.

でも、トーチであるあなたも坂井悠二の思いで満たされている。

Yuji:
Yeah... and, when I first met Shana, it's true that I was nothing but a Torch.
But now... things are different.

うん。だから、シャナに会った時の僕はやっぱりただのトーチだったんだ。
でも、でも今は！

Shana:
Yuji...

Yuji:
Everything's different.
I know that I'm the one who's doing all the thinking, the worrying and the feeling.
And I know through fact that it's all true!
So I'm Yuji Sakai! Who are you?! Where are you?! The real you?!

今は違う！
あの時からずっと考えたり、悩んだり、思ってきたのは僕だ！
だからもう一度はっきり言う！
僕は坂井悠二だ！君は誰？君だけの君はどこにいる！？

Hecate:
The real me...

私は…

Shana:
Yuji, I'm here! I'll save you!

悠二、お前は私が守る！


Yuji:
Shana!

Shana:
Oh, Yuji...

Yuji:
Shana!

Hecate:
The thing that was fulfilling me is gone... disappearing...

私を満たしていたものが…消える…

Yuji:
It was wrong.
You can't fill yourself with my memories.
Right from the very beginning, you've been empty.

違うよ。
僕の思いで満たされたりするわけがない。
君は最初からずっと、空っぽのままだ。



Bel-Peol:
What!? It's stopped!

Yuji:
Are you okay, Shana?

Shana:
Yeah.

Yuji:
I'm sorry. All of this for me.

Shana:
Don't worry. They asked me to bring you back.
Those two guys. And Kazumi Yoshida.

Yuji:
Are you serious? You mean everybody was worried about me?

Shana:
Mm-hm. But I was the one who was most worried.

Yuji:
Shana....

Right from the very beginning, you've been empty.

Sydonay:
Hecate!

Margery:
Hey you! I thought we agreed there'd be no quitting!

Bel-Peol:
Oh no!

Wirhelmina:
What the...?

Tiamat:
Abnormal situation.

Shana:
Alastor!

Alastor:
Supreme Throne is spilling forth all the power of existence within her!
But she can't hold that tremendous amount of power.

Yuji:
The city! Oh no...

Alastor:
With this much power flowing freely, waiting for it to dissipate naturally is simply not feasible!

Yuji:
Oh no!

Professor:
Oh my goodness! This is so exciting! The reality! The data! The results!
Fully saturated power of existence, exceeding the world's natural safety level!

Domino:
Oh, what's gonna happen now?

Professor:
Oh, good question! We're gonna find out pretty soon!

Bel-Peol:
Time to move on...

Alastor:
There's only one solution for this.

Shana:
Mm.

Yuji:
Really?

Shana:
The manifestation of Alastor, the Flame of Heaven...

Alastor:
Hmm...

Yuji:
So then...

Shana:
Alastor will appear in the world physically.

Alastor:
Being one of the most powerful Crimson Lords.
My manifestation will consume a great amount of existence.
It seems likely my manifestation will absorb the excessive amount of power here.
And this result would stop the city's impending destruction.

Yuji:
Then...

Alastor:
However... when I manifest, the Flame Haze which I occupy is destroyed...
This is happened before...

Yuji:
But, by destroyed... do you mean...?

Shana:
Yes... I'll die.
It is the destiny handed to the Flaming-Haired Blazing-Eyed Flame Haze.
It's not a surprise. I knew this when I entered into the contract with Alastor.

Wirhelmina:
I'm getting a bad feeling about this indeed.

Tiamat:
Hurry.

Shana:
I saved you, Yuji... as Shana.
Now I have to carry out my mission as a Flame Haze.
That's who I am. But now...

Alastor:
Yuji Sakai... Unfortunately, we have no way to get you to safety in time.

Yuji:
Let's go... I decided long ago...
I'll go where you go. And I still feel that way.

Shana:
Yuji...

Shana:
Tenpa... Josai...
I love you... Yuji Sakai.

Wirhelmina:
Oh no!

Tiamat:
Tenpa Josai.

Professor:
Nooo! Reality is dissipating!
There's only one thing left to do! Escape!

Domino:
Right on you!

Professor:
We shall move on to our next experiment!

Margery:
What are you doing!? You wanna die!?

Marcosias:
Move it! If we're engulfed by the Flame of Heaven, we're done for!

Hecate:
Nothing... I'm nothing...

Sydonay:
It's all right, Hecate. Be calm. You are you.

Margery:
That little brat...


Yuji:
...na. ...ke up.

Shana:
What?

Yuji:
Shana. ...up!

Shana:
Who is that?

Yuji:
Shana.

Shana:
Yuji? But why?

Yuji:
Wake up!

Shana:
Wake up? But, I'm not...

Yuji:
Shana! Shana! Thank goodness.

Shana:
Why am I still alive...?

Alastor:
Your body was able to contain my physical existence.
I'd sensed this possibility when we forged our contract but...

Yuji:
You're saying we can do this all the time?

Alastor:
Do not be foolish. We can't risk our lives on what might've been a lucky occurrence.

Shana:
No way... I am alive...

Yuji:
Mm-hm. And me, too.

Shana:
Yuji...


Yuji:
Ah... You're kind of [on]...

Shana:
You were looking!

Yuji:
No!

Shana:
You were looking all right!?

Yuji:
I didn't see anything!

Shana:
Then why did you look away?

Yuji:
Oh, because...!

Shana:
Don't looking!

Yuji:
Shana, you moved!

Shana:
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!



Wirhelmina:
Excuse me for what I am about to do, indeed.

Shana:
Wirhelmina...

Margery:
They're pretty lucky, all right.

Marcosias:
Oh, look who's talking. Well, what do you think?
We take off for a little while, and all hell breakthroughs.

Margery:
You got a point. I guess we could hang out for a little longer.

Marcosias:
Help me! You two! Help me, these very men!

Tanaka:
Isn't it great? Big Sister's gonna stick around!

Sato:
I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing.

Margery:
Oh, what are you saying? You are honest to your feelings!

Chigusa:
See you later! Bye.
Shana-chan, I'm setting a place for you, so drop by for supper!

Tanaka:
H-hi...

Ogata:
Good morning...

Ike:
Hey.

Yuji:
Morning.

Ike:
This semester... you've got a competition.

Yuji:
Huh? Ike, wait a minute!

Yoshida:
I am not gonna lose to you.

Shana:
Huh?

Yoshida:
Round No.2 starts today.

Shana:
What!? What do you mean?
When I brought Yuji back, you thanked me with tears in your eyes!

Yoshida:
And that was the end of Round 1. May the best girl win. See ya!

Shana:
Huh? Well, I'm not gonna lose. You can bet on it.

Yuji:
For now, we're living our lives the best we can.
The short distance away... from where the world... is displaced.
