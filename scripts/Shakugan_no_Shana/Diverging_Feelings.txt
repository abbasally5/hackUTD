  A heartbeat that lasts for eternity, lives consumed in soundless balls of fire.
No one can tell when the world is displaced and the flames of the Crimson World sweep over all.


Wirhelmina:
On a stroll at this late hour? You've indeed saved me the trouble of drawing you out.
You won't suffer long.

Tiamat:
Single-shot kill.

Wirhelmina:
Indeed, it's no use calling for help.
The Flame-Haired Blazing-Eyed Hunter fully supports my decision to destroy you.

Yuji:
Shana... supports this!?

Shana:
Yuji!

Wirhelmina:
How curious. Indeed you can control some power of existence.

Tiamat:
Ridiculous.

Yuji:
Shana! Shana didn't give me up.

Wirhelmina:
What are you trying to achieve here?
After all, you agreed to the destruction of the Mystes.
Indeed, I ask you to move out of the way. Now!

Tiamat:
Withdraw.

Alastor:
Shana.

Wirhelmina:
Tell me. Do you indeed object to the destruction of the Mystes?
Randomly transferring the Midnight Lost Child to a new location would indeed enable us to avoid confrontation with the Bal Masque.
A major battle will upset the balance of the world. From that perspective, it is the only practical choice.
Indeed, given that we're unaware of the enemy's plans and that they may in fact already be in motion, this is our best move.
But indeed you already know this. Because... you are a Flame Haze.
Are you indeed still opposed?

Yuji:
Shana...

Yoshida:
What is this strange feeling?

Sydonay:
Hecate, what's the matter?

Hecate:
The Palace of Stars is trembling.

Sydonay:
Yeah. Because that hag Bel-Peol had the crazy Professor fiddle around with it.
They're planning on activating the Whole Sacred Chapel for real.

Hecate:
The Sacred Chapel?

Sydonay:
You're going to be busy. Soon you'll have no time for praying.
Might be easier to just tell me what you want. What do you wish for?

Hecate:
An answer. I want the answer to what I desire.

Sydonay:
And what is that?

Hecate:
I desire the thing I desire.

Bel-Peol:
You get the same response every time. It seems she doesn't desire anything.
However, once the Sacred Chapel has been activated, this child would be in great demand.

Sydonay:
That's fine with me. But you're certain Hecate won't be harmed by this?

Bel-Peol:
Relax, Thousand Changes. Hecate will become eternal.
And power of existence will flow forever.

Sydonay:
Hmm... Well, I'll do my part until sure it happens.
I just want to protect Hecate.

Hecate:
Remember, I do not belong to you.

Sydonay:
More's the pity. Hecate, you're pure and unspoiled. Please stay that way.

Bel-Peol:
It's almost complete.
Soon I'll have achieved what no other Crimson Lord has ever dreamed of...
A fount of existence...

Wirhelmina:
If you have no answer for me, then indeed refrain from getting in my way.

Tiamat:
Destroy.

Yuji:
There's no way Shana can oppose them.
That's because... she's a Flame Haze.

Alastor:
Wait! Specialist of Everything!
We're not done with this Mystes.

Wirhelmina:
What are you saying?

Alastor:
We need to hear him.
Earlier in the day, he was trying to tell us about the Denizen.

Yuji:
Yes, that's right. The Denizenâ€™s bird ornaments.

Alastor:
Shana, you were going to ask about that, weren't you?

Shana:
Ah... yeah.

Wirhelmina:
A trivial reason to postpone its destruction.

Alastor:
You cannot assume this is trivial.
This Mystes has aided us on a number of occasions with his insight.

Shana:
That's right. He helped us in the last battle.
I think it would be wise to hear it... w-what the Mystes says.

Yuji:
What the Mystes says...

Wirhelmina:
That look on her face... Is it that important?
If you two feel this strongly about it, then I guess there must be some value indeed in keeping the Mystes around.
I will postpone destroying it, just this one time.

Tiamat:
Acknowledged.

Shana:
Wirhelmina...

Wirhelmina:
Indeed, I believe you. I indeed do not wish to lose hope in you.

Yuji:
So, what I was trying to tell you.
This city's remaining bird ornaments. I was wondering if they're still safe.
That Denizen yesterday didn't turn all of them into Rinnes.
You really had no use for them?

Alastor:
You're saying they could still pose some kind of danger to us.

Yuji:
We really don't know exactly what he was trying to accomplish now, do we?
What if we can't figure it out because his plan isn't finished yet?

Alastor:
You have a point. It certainly is a possibility, and more than the enough reason to be cautious.

Shana:
That makes sense.

Yuji:
Was that worth keeping me around?

Shana:
I only meant...

Yuji:
I know. I'm a Mystes. And you're only a Flame Haze... Right?

Yoshida:
Sakai... and Yukari...

Yuji:
Shana, listen. I'm pretty sure that I've made up my mind. I'm gonna leave.

Shana:
Yuji!

Yuji:
I've been thinking. I've decided I can't involve this city or the people in it in any more battles.
Heading out on a road is the only thing I can do to help protect everyone.

Shana:
Protect everyone...

Yuji:
I wanna... protect the people.

Shana:
For the people? No! This isn't what I want!
I want him to come with me but not for this reason!

Yuji:
So, I'm gonna leave this city.

Shana:
It's all wrong! Because if you leave, um, Bal Masque was to chase you, or you could be tracked down by other Denizens.

Yuji:
So I'll change locations, or fight back.

Shana:
You can't!

Yuji:
Why not?

Shana:
You can't because you can't!

Yuji:
You're telling me I should stay here?

Shana:
I didn't say that!

Yuji:
What are you saying?
I bet you're going to destroy me, aren't you?

Shana:
No!

Yuji:
I mean that's what any other Flame Haze would do when face with this problem, isn't it?

Shana:
No! You're wrong! That's not it!

Yuji:
Then what else am I supposed to do?
Shana, I have no idea what's going through your head.

Shana:
Yuji...



Yoshida:
Sakai.

Yuji:
Yoshida. What are you doing out this late?

Yoshida:
I guess... it's because of this special amulet. That's why...

Yuji:
I see. You felt the Seal.

Yoshida:
Sakai, are you really... are you really thinking of leaving here?

Yuji:
You overheard me?

Yoshida:
I'm sorry.

Yuji:
Yeah, it's true.

Yoshida:
But why?

Yuji:
Yoshida, partly because of you, I made the decision to leave.
You said... that I'm a human being.
That I realized how much I wanted to protect the things, they were important to me as a person.
Because of that desire, it proves I really am Yuji Sakai.

Yoshida:
But... Yes, but...

Yuji:
Thanks, Yoshida.
It really meant a lot to me when you told me how you felt.
I'm sorry. But my mind's made up.

Yoshida:
Sakai...

Tanaka:
Good for you!

Yuji:
Tanaka. Sato.

Tanaka:
I have to say that was pretty moving, Sakai.
You're all right in my books, dude.

Yuji:
Ah, why are you here?

Sato:
Well, apparently we can detect Seals because of this thing.

Tanaka:
Actually, we were kinda hoping Big Sister'd come back.

Sato:
Speak for yourself.
I said we'll see if it's a Denizen, and if it is, we'll clobber it.

Yuji:
So, you're saying Margery is not here anymore?

Tanaka:
Yeah...

Sato:
That's all over. It's done.

Yuji:
I see. Margery's gone, too.

Alastor:
I must say I support Yuji Sakai's opinion on these matters.
Concerning whether or not to destroy him, and whether to leave the city or stay.

Shana:
That means...

Alastor:
You would have struck the Specialist of Everything with your sword if I hadn't intervened.
But it's also clear you're struggling with your sense of loyalty to her.
What do you want to do with Yuji Sakai?

Shana:
I don't...

Alastor:
Or rather... what do you want him to do?

Shana:
I want Yuji to... Yuji should... I don't know... I have no idea!

Tanaka:
They'll kill you? And send the Midnight... doowacky off somewhere else?

Yuji:
Apparently, that would make it really hard to find again.
And when the Midnight Lost Child's gone, there'll be no reason for the Denizens group, Bal Masque, to attack Misaki City.

Sato:
But then... you'll die, right?

Yuji:
Yeah.

Yoshida:
Oh no...

Tanaka:
So is Hirai... I mean Shana, is she actually going along with this?

Yuji:
Shana? I don't know.

Sato:
Damn all those Flame Hazes!
None of them give a crap about ordinary people anyway!
Sakai, if you're gonna leave this city, I'll go with you.

Yuji:
Ah...

Sato:
Nothing about this place or my house is keeping me here.
I'd sure feel better getting out.

Tanaka:
Okay. I'm with you. Can't let Sakai suffer alone now, can we?

Yuji:
Thanks you guys.

Tanaka:
But we can come back every now and then, right?

Sato:
You're backing out already?

Tanaka:
I'd like to see some people.

Sato:
What?

Tanaka:
Ah, nothing.

Sato:
What do you mean "nothing"?

Tanaka:
Never mind!

Sato:
Mind what?

Tanaka:
Just forget it!

Yoshida:
Sakai's pretty serious. Leaving the city's a big decision.
But he's able to talk about it so calmly...
And talk so frankly with Yukari about stuff...
I thought because of what happened I've gotten closer to him...
But he seems further away now than he was before...

Shana:
Just ignore her!

Yuji:
That's when she started acting strangely.
Because she's been thinking about destroying me.
Naturally, as a Flame Haze, she sees me as nothing more than a Mystes...

Shana:
I want... Yuji to...

Wirhelmina:
Indeed, I believe you.

Tanaka:
Yo! You said there's something about these things that had you worried.
So we thought we'd come by today and check them out.

Sato:
Big fire, no problem.

Yuji:
Great. I'm sure it's just my imagination anyway.

Yoshida:
Sakai...

Tanaka:
Hey, look. There's a maid over there. And Hirai's with her.

Yuji:
Shana...

Wirhelmina:
I must admit that indeed the instincts of the Mystes are good.
It is too easy to overlook items that have already been used.
And so we will keep watch until they've all been reduced to ashes just in case.

Sato:
It looks it's fine.

Yuji:
Yeah.

Tiamat:
Caution.

Wirhelmina:
Looks bad.

Tanaka:
Hey!

Sato:
An Unrestricted System!

Shana:
But I didn't feel anything!

Alastor:
How was that possible?

Yuji:
Maybe lighting the fire was the switch to trigger the Unrestricted System.
Look, there! The same one!

Shana:
Wirhelmina, something's going to appear right above the System!

Wirhelmina:
Like what?

Shana:
Last time, it was an airship.

Yuji:
It's a Seal!

Sato:
What the hell's that!?

Wirhelmina:
Why, that's...

Alastor:
Incredible.

Shana:
What is it?

Alastor:
The Place of Stars.

Wirhelmina:
Indeed, the headquarters of the Bal Masque.

Alastor:
Judge of Paradoxes!

Wirhelmina:
Bel-Peol!

Bel-Peol:
It's been a while, Flame of Heaven and Specialist of Everything.
Even you two failed to see the truth behind the double layer we set up.
Oh my... Flame Hazes are always so eager to fight.

Yuji:
She's part of Bal Masque!

Alastor:
Bel-Peol! Surely you know what the major intervention like this does to the balance of the world?

Bel-Peol:
You consider this major?
That just goes to show how far you've fallen, Flame of Heaven.
The real intervention is about to begin right now.
So just sit back and watch the show, as this city becomes a fount of existence.

Alastor:
A fount of existence!? You mean...

Bel-Peol:
Oh, yes...

Alastor:
How could you...

Wirhelmina:
There's something odd here.
It's not like her to come out and brag about her plans.

Hecate:
Look, there it is!

Wirhelmina:
How careless! They are after the Midnight Lost Child.

Tiamat:
Destroy.

Shana:
Wirhelmina, don't do it!

Wirhelmina:
Sydonay!

Sydonay:
You're always for a sharp one.
Hold it right there, Mystes.
You're the one I came to see.

Wirhelmina:
I must destroy it before they get it!

Yuji:
Shana!

Sydonay:
That she just protected the Mystes. How ridiculous.

Yuji:
Shana! Shana!

Wirhelmina:
But why...?

Shana:
Yuji... I didn't know... what else to do? ...



Yuji's taken to the Palace of Stars.

With her friends counting on her, Shana has to make an important decision.
