  A heartbeat that lasts for eternity, lives consumed in soundless balls of fire.
No one can tell when the world is displaced and the flames of the Crimson World sweep over all.


Vine:
W-what is that? I... I found it! The Palace of Heaven's Road!

Wilhelmina:
We have a real emergency indeed.

Tenmokuikko:
Mighty warrior... I am here to fight you...

Orgon:
H-h-humph! Frozen with fear, I see.

Wilhelmina:
Indeed, we must return at once.

Tiamat:
Agreed.

Orgon:
H-humph, you don't actually think you'll escape, do you?
Hm? 
What!? 
Oof! T-this can't be happening!
Yeow!

Girl:
Shiro... Is this my fault? This happened... because I... tricked you?
I'm sorry! I just... I wanted to show you... I wanted to show you that I could do it.
That I could beat you if I put my mind to it. Shiro! I'm so sorry! Shiro!

Vine:
Well, kid, I think I've found the culprit.
Ha, Ha, Ha ... I don't know all the details, but whatever you did, thanks.

Girl:
Human...? No, he's... a Crimson Denizen!

Vine:
Yeah. So, what's with the sour face? Hey, now I've got a little question. What about you? What are you?

Girl:
I am...

Vine:
Yeah, I am what?

Girl:
I'm training to become a Flame... Flame Haze.

Vine:
Ha, Ha, ... So, you want to be a Flame Haze! Perfect! That's exactly what I wanted to hear! I'm always on the look out for people like you!
Preventing the reinstatement of a contract is a great accomplishment, especially that's the Flaming-Haired Blazing-Eyed one! 

Girl:
It's just like Alastor said. He's manipulating the power of existence.
He has the ability to draw it from human beings.
So is that how you eat people?

Vine:
Yeah. This is how I always do it.

Girl:
He always does it? He's the enemy!

Vine:
What's this? You're trembling.
Good bye. I hope you have better luck in your next life!

Girl:
Now I see. It's clear. This is right. I've made a right choice.
I've decided to become a Flame Haze! Got that? I will be a Flame Haze. I will.

Vine:
Not in this lifetime you won't...! ....

Wilhelmina:
Indeed I see I'm not too late.

Girl:
Wilhelmina!

Wilhelmina:
You can tell me all about it later. Indeed, it's time for changes for everyone.

Girl:
Please don't blame Shiro for this! It's all my fault. I did it!

Wilhelmina:
Indeed, I've no intention of blaming him for what has transpired.
Now that the Denizen has found it, we can no longer live in this place.
To stay and try to continue our lives as we knew it would be pointless.

Girl:
Don't say that! I don't wanna hear that! I wanna be a Flame Haze! I do! I do! It's all I want!
My training can't be over. Please, Wilhelmina!

Wilhelmina:
You misunderstand. It seems you have indeed missed the point here.

Girl:
I have?

Wilhelmina:
Your training's over because you're going to be just fine.
You no longer need to train, nor to live within the walls of this Palace.
Because indeed your life as a Flame Haze is about to begin.

Girl:
Really?


Shiro!

Wilhelmina:
Indeed, other enemies follow. You are to stay here and do the best you can to hold them back. You need to buy us some time.

Girl:
Wilhelmina!

Wilhelmina:
We have to be going.

Vine:
Not so fast! 
Bastard!

Girl:
Aren't you worried about Shiro?

Wilhelmina:
No.

Girl:
Umm... Wilhelmina. Are you... You know... Are you a Flame Haze?

Wilhelmina:
That is, indeed what I am. I'm a Flame Haze of Tiamat, the Tiara of Dreams and Illusions.
My name is Wilhelmina Carmel, the Specialist of Everything.

Tiamat:
Greetings.

Wilhelmina:
That's her. That was the voice of the Denizen of the Crimson Realm, Tiamat.
Indeed she's not what we'll call the sociable type.

Girl:
Why didn't you tell me about this?

Wilhelmina:
I did this to make sure that you would have no preconceptions.
I wanted you to envision what you wanted to be, and then indeed develop that vision in your own heart.
Though it seems I didn't have anything to worry about.

Girl:
Well, I guess it worked then because I really want to be a Flame Haze.
Are you at least a little proud of me?

Wilhelmina:
Indeed I can't think of a moment when I wasn't proud of you.

Girl:
I can feel it. You are proud of me, aren't you, Wilhelmina? And it's all thanks to you.

Wilhelmina:
That is correct, indeed.

Vine:
Oh no... This can't be happening... What's he doing here!?
Just my luck to have the nemesis of the entire Crimson World show up! It's Tenmokuikko!

Wilhelmina:
Indeed, our latest guest is Tenmokuikko.

Girl:
Who's he?

Wilhelmina:
The most feared Mystes ever. Indeed, those who survived the encounter call him a monster of all Torches.
He's nigh invincible and indeed over the years he has made his reputation slaughtering countless powerful Denizens.
It would be dangerous to approach him recklessly.

Tiamat:
Delay defense.

Wilhelmina:
Roger that.

Vine:
Dude! Stop coming! Stop coming closer! Stay back! Stay back!



Vine:
Everything was going so well for me. But then, this... Why!?
I won't stand the chance against him! Wait! Wait a minute!
What have happened to Orgon? This monster must have defeated him!
Now I see... He is the one who's been killing the members of the Bal Masque!
Lady Bel-Peol! Please protect me!

Girl:
How did he get here?

Wilhelmina:
I think there's only one way he was able to find us.
Indeed, the Palace must have been revealed when the Rainbow Sky Sword destroyed the outer shell.

Girl:
Was the Rainbow Sky Sword the Rainbow Shiro pulled out? Wait! Where's Shiro?

Wilhelmina:
He's doing just fine. He did everything he could under the circumstances.
But things have changed. So he's keeping still.

Girl:
He's not dead?

Wilhelmina:
His life is bound by a solemn oath, therefore it is indeed impossible for him to die before the vow is fulfilled.

Girl:
Why is Tenmokuikko taking such a long time to finish all that Denizens?

Wilhelmina:
I believe it is because he's sensed the presence of a much greater target, the Flame of Heaven.

Tiamat:
Agreed.

Girl:
He wants to fight Alastor because he's the strongest Denizen here.

Wilhelmina:
I will keep that other Denizen at bay, as well as anyone else who might follow for as long as I can.

Girl:
So I... can make a contract with... with Alastor.

Wilhelmina:
If both of you are in agreement, the contract will be enacted instantaneously.
After that, all you have to do is follow the Flame of Heaven's instructions. Then you will embark on your mission as a Flame Haze.

Right now, the main problem isn't your determination, but it's whether or not, I can hold them back long enough for you to actually reach that stage.

Girl:
Can you deal with that Denizen alone?

Wilhelmina:
I surmise from the amount of energy he emits, that the odds of victory are indeed in my favor.

Tiamat:
Agreed.

Girl:
Tell me about Tenmokuikko. Tell me everything you know.

Vine:
What should I do? If I make a wrong move, he'll split me in two!

Wilhelmina:
Tenmokuikko!

Vine:
The fool! That's suicide! What the...?
Somehow that little girl knows he never attacks humans.

Girl:
Tenmokuikko! What is that you want? If you want to have a duel with a real Flame Haze, then you must act as my escort!
If you agree, then I swear I will accept your challenge and fight you as the Flame-Haired Blazing-Eyed Hunter!

Tenmokuikko:
Flaming-Hair Blazing-Eyes...

Girl:
Yes.

Tenmokuikko:
You have the potential to become a mighty warrior. I will fight you.

Vine:
I won't let you!

Wilhelmina:
Indeed, I am to be your opponent.


So be it. The next time I see you...

Orgon:
I'll kill you... I shall slay everyone who dared to insult me! Everyone shall die!

Alastor:
It is here. The time has come.

Wilhelmina:
When you enter into the contract, I want you to show the Flame of Heaven the feelings you have hidden away in your heart.

Girl:
I understand. I have decided that today I will accept everything and anything that I see.
I will reveal my hidden feelings and hold nothing back. Because if I have to show them to anyone, it should be Alastor.

Wilhelmina:
Yes.

Girl:
Let's go.

Wilhelmina:
When you're the Flaming-Haired Blazing-Eyed Hunter, the glittering flames will look good on you indeed.

Girl:
Hurry up! Faster you move, the sooner you'll have your duel.

Wilhelmina:
Flame Hazes are indeed by nature a rather sinful lot.
Hesitation and mercy are unnecessary. Persona, God Vessel.

Tiamat:
Understood.

Wilhelmina:
No defects.

Tiamat:
Checked.

Orgon:
You... are the Specialist of Everything...

Wilhelmina:
Indeed, I have always wanted to face you and battle.

Tiamat:
Commence.

Alastor:
Let us begin.

Girl:
This will only take a moment.

Alastor:
Hurry (up) with the contract!

Girl:
Wilhelmina told me to tell you what I've been hiding from you.
You're keeping secrets from me, too.

Alastor:
My hunter is destined to carry a hidden treasure, the "Tenpa Josai."

Girl:
And a Flame Haze that uses it is destroyed by it.

Flame-Haired Blazing-Eyed Hunter:
Goodbye! May your flames last for eternity, and never dim. I love you, Alastor, Flame of Heaven.

Alastor:
If necessary, my contractor is to use this secret method to accomplish their mission.
You would have walked another path in life, yet we've bound you to this destiny. It's nothing but our love.

Girl:
I know. I love you, too. I love all of you. You never wanted to use it, did you? That method was a last resort.
When you talk of the previous Flaming-Haired Blazing-Eyed Hunter, you sounds so happy and sad at the same time.
Thank you so much for telling me about it. But it's fine. I've decided that this is right for me. This is my path.
I will carry out my mission even at the cost of my life. That is what Flame Hazes do. The feelings I have been hiding are from before.
I have always had these doubts about this great cause in which Flame Hazes do battle with Crimson Denizens to maintain the balance of the world.

Alastor:
I see.

Girl:
It may or fully not be true, but the only way I'm for sure is if I find out on my own. I'm sorry, Alastor. I know I'm being difficult.
I know you care, but no matter how much you love me, and no matter how much I love everyone else in return, if you're uncomfortable with this, then I just can't do it.
He's getting in the way! Kill him!

O magnificent Crimson Lord, Flame of Heaven, Alastor!
I respect your will. Reincarnated using my body as your vessel.
Together we shall carry out the mission of the Flame Hazes until the day we fall!

Alastor! This is you! Your flames are... so hot! You... you are the Flame of Heaven!

Alastor:
Choose your God Vessel.

Girl:
A pendant, so that you'll be like a clear and unclouded eye watching over us.

Alastor:
Hmm... I welcome your arrival, to this scene of carnage, to the gardens of battle. My Flame Haze...

Girl:
You are welcome in me, Alastor, the Flame of Heaven.
For I am now a Flame Haze! Flaming-Hair and Blazing-Eyes!


There [It] was a promise from a day long long ago.
Between those holding flame, and a girl who was about to receive it.
Then, the end of the beginning arrives.
