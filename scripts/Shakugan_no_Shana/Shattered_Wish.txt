  A heartbeat that lasts for eternity, lives consumed in soundless balls of fire.
No one can tell when the world is displaced and the flames of the Crimson World sweep over all.


Yoshida:
The way the world really is...

Khamsin:
I'll rent you that monocle.
Please confirm for yourself whether or not the person you know as Yuji Sakai is indeed a Torch.
I'm going to need your cooperation, and that would be difficult in your present state.

Behemoth:
Hmm... Young lady, it is crucial to have someone like you who was born and raised in the city, someone who knows it and holds it in your heart.

Yoshida:
If... Sakai is a Torch... then one day...
He's just fine... I'm sure he's not a Torch...
And at the festival tomorrow, I'm gonna tell him that I love him.

Shana:
There's a pretty good chance the Bal Masque is going to come to this city looking for you, Yuji.
This place is already imbalanced, so we could have a real problem on our hands.

Yuji:
I can't stay in the city for much longer, regardless of what the Bal Masque does.
I'm no longer human. And one of these days, I'm gonna have to say goodbye them all and everyone anyway.
But I wanna stay just a little longer, hang on a little while.

Shana:
I'm gonna wear a yukata tomorrow and surprise Yuji.
And then... we'll go to the festival together.
Just like the day we finally leave this city, we'll be together.

Margery:
What? You both wanna come with me when I decide to leave this place?

Marcosias:
These guys must be totally fluctuated with you! Ow!

Margery:
Do you two really understand what you're talking about here?

Sato:
Of course we do.

Margery:
I'm not so sure about that. ....
What you guys are trying to achieve... is right here.

Tanaka:
I get it. Once we get good enough with it, you're gonna take us with you, am I right?

Margery:
You'll understand when you give it a try.

Tanaka:
All right! ....

Sato:
Tanaka!

Tanaka:
You think maybe this is some kinda subtle hand that she doesn't want us to come along?

Marcosias:
This isn't like you.

Margery:
Really?

Marcosias:
Usually, you just punch them in the face! If someone expected. I wouldn't be surprised if I find it raining booze tomorrow! Ha ha ha ... Ow!

Students:
Hey, you wear a new yukata to the festival?

Oh, yeah. Especially since I just bought a new one.

Alastor:
I'm talking about leaving this city.

Yoshida:
I'm still afraid... I'm still too afraid...

Yuji:
Yoshida. Hey, if it's okay, I'll meet you on the bridge at five o'clock.

Yoshida:
Yeah, sure. That's just fine.

Behemoth:
Hmm... I wonder how that girl is doing. I can only hope this Yuji Sakai of hers is not a Torch.

Khamsin:
And I hope she calms down enough to be of use to us.
It's gonna take a lot of work to tune the city.

Behemoth:
Indeed. The distortion is unusually large.

Khamsin:
Well, we should mark this area as well.
Just a few more, and we should have enough for the tuning.
However, I'm sensing something strange here. And it's not the distortion.

Behemoth:
Hmm...

Professor:
Things are progressing rather nicely. In fact, I'd say they're just perfect. Do you concur, Domino?

Domino:
Absolutely! 6 hours 14 minutes and 32 seconds until preparations are complete!

Professor:
Oh, what the grand time we'll have...

Chigusa:
Just as I thought, this pattern really suits you.
Yu-chan is going to stop dead in his tracks when he sees how pretty you look.
But he seems to be running a little late.

Yuji:
I thought I was ready to leave this city.
But it's not that simple.
What!? It's later than I thought!

Sorry, Yoshida. Did you wait long?

Yoshida:
No. Not at all.

Yuji:
Shall we go?

Yoshida:
Okay.

Chigusa:
I wonder what's taking Yu-chan so long.
He trains with you every Saturday afternoon.
So he should have been home early then...

Shana:
I told him we train the evening today.

Chigusa:
Oh.

Shana:
It's okay. I didn't tell him we're going to the festival.

Chigusa:
I see... Then in that case, maybe he stopped off somewhere on his way home.

Shana:
Stopped off somewhere?

Chigusa:
What do you say that two of us go out and look for him, Shana-chan?
He could be hanging out with Ike and his friends at the festival.
We'll leave a note explaining where we are in case he comes home.

Shana:
But...

Chigusa:
I imagine Yu-chan will be even more surprised if we just happen to run into him. Right?

Shana:
Wow...

Chigusa:
Look over there, Shana-chan. They have candy apples.
Yu-chan always has when he comes to the festival. Wanna try one?

Shana:
Okay.

Chigusa:
Something wrong? Do you see him?

Shana:
No, it's someone else. But it's okay.

Tanaka:
Please, Big Sister. You're interrupting our training.
This isn't the time to come to a festival.

Margery:
Oh, shut up. When a woman says she wants to go out, it's a man's job to accompany her.

Marcosias:
Also any more training and you might have ended up turning each other into a plate of human sashimi! Ha ha ha ha.

Margery:
Eita, buy me something with alcohol.

Tanaka:
What!? You're gonna drink!?

Margery:
Is that gonna be a problem?

Tanaka:
No! Not at all!

Margery:
Good.

Girl:
Oga-chan, let's go.

Ogata:
Right.

Yuji:
Wow, look at all the booths. Hey, keep an eye on the candy apples.

Yoshida:
I do wanna find out if Sakai's all right.
But I'm... afraid... But I think not knowing, is even worse...

Khamsin:
Well, I suppose all we can do now is wait for that girl to cooperate with us.

Behemoth:
Hmm... But this odd feeling concerns me. It might be because of the distortion.

Khamsin:
There are no indications of any Denizens present.
And there's nothing we can do about it anyway.

Behemoth:
Hmm...

Professor:
You know, humans are so easy to take advantage of.
All those Flame Hazes and not even one of them has detected us!

Domino:
Professor, preparations are complete!

Professor:
Excellent!

Yoshida:
He's fine... I'm sure he's just fine... Then, I'll tell him that I love him.

Professor:
Start the experiment!

Domino:
Okey-dokey!



Shana:
But how...? I haven't sensed it until right this moment.

Chigusa:
Shana-chan, is something wrong?

Shana:
I forgot there's something I have to do.
Please go on without me. Please go on.

Tanaka:
Is it a Denizen?

Marcosias:
Seems that way. But how come we're only sensing the Unrestricted System?

Margery:
It must be off hiding somewhere... Anyway, the festivities are over for us.

Sato:
I guess that means we should head over the Crystal Altar.
We're supposed to find that Denizen for you, right?

Marcosias:
It's becoming second natured, you guys.

Margery:
You know what to do when you get there, right?

Tanaka, Sato:
You bet.

Marcosias:
Hey, you're not actually thinking about bringing them all along, are you?

Margery:
Don't be ridiculous. I'm just taking advantage of them while I can, like always.
We need the Crystal Altar for the search.

Marcosias:
In that case, (then) all right.

Margery:
We're dealing with an Unrestricted System here that's very sophisticated.

Alastor:
It was clearly fashioned by someone of great skill.

Shana:
Yuji must have seen it by now. Where is he?

Yuji:
A Denizen!? I have to find Shana!
Hey, Yoshida! Yoshida...? Are you...?

Yoshida:
He can't be... Not Sakai!

Yuji:
Yoshida! What's wrong? Ah. This is... a Treasure... Oh, no!

Shana:
Yuji! Kazumi Yoshida...? Why? Why would she be with Yuji?

Yoshida:
It can't be... It can't!

Yuji:
Hey, Yoshida! 
Shana?

Shana:
Why were she here, Yuji?

Yuji:
Listen, I think Yoshida found out that I'm a Torch!
I have to go after her! She was upset and crying! I can't leave her like this!

Shana:
Why can't you just ignore her?

Yuji:
Ignore her...? Shana...

Shana:
Just ignore her! Are you blind!? There's a Denizen on the moves here!

Yuji:
I know! But... I have to go and talk to her properly!

Shana:
No, you have to be with me, Yuji. Forget about talking to Kazumi Yoshida.

Yuji:
It's not that simple.

Shana:
Stop it! Leave her alone! She has nothing to do with us!

Yuji:
Nothing to do with...?

Shana:
You know it's true. Kazumi Yoshida has nothing to do with us! She doesn't matter to us!

Yuji:
Shana! 
I never expected you to say those things, Shana!
Well, she does matter to me.

Shana:
Yuji!

Yuji:
Yoshida!

Shana:
Yuji...

Little girl:
Excuse me, are you okay? Where does it hurt?

Alastor:
Shana!

Shana:
Yuji... Yuji! Yuji!

Khamsin:
Look at it.

Behemoth:
Hmm...

Khamsin:
Oh, so it's you, I see.

Alastor:
Mobilizer of Ceremonial Equipment, it was you two.

Behemoth:
Hmm... it's been a while, Flame of Heaven.

Khamsin:
Well then, I take it you have seen the system.

Margery:
Marcosias, I'm getting a bad feeling about this crazy system.

Marcosias:
Yeah, it's Dantalion, the Seeker.
This has to be the work of that warped-out professor.
But I haven't picked up his presence anywhere.

Margery:
Another reason why we need the Crystal Altar. Keisaku, Eita, hurry up!

Sato:
Where the hell did Tanaka get to? Is he lost?

Tanaka:
Hey, what are you doing, Oga-chan? Please, I'm in a hurry!

Ogata:
Forget it! Not until you tell me all about that woman you were hanging around with.

Tanaka:
I already told you! She's an acquaintance!

Ogata:
Is that the truth?

Tanaka:
Yes, and I really am in a hurry. Let me go.

Ogata:
You're just saying that you're lying to me!

Tanaka:
Wha... You know you're really starting to get on my nerves.
What gives you the right to ask me the stuff?

Ogata:
Because... I feel... I'll just...

Tanaka:
Whatever, look, I have to get going.

Ogata:
She makes me jealous!

Tanaka:
What?

Ogata:
She makes me really jealous.

Tanaka:
Why would you be jealous?

Ogata:
She makes me jealous because I'm in love with you, Eita Tanaka! You get it now!?

Yoshida:
Sakai is a Torch... He's dead!

Yuji:
Yoshida! Who would've given you something like this?

Alastor:
Gather yourself! A Denizen has begun his attack!

Shana:
Sorry.

Khamsin:
Let's get back to the matter at hand, shall we? This Unrestricted System is making things worse.
If it keeps up, the distortion will be too large to repair. And a whole city will be engulfed.

Alastor:
What is its purpose? Is there anything we can do?

Khamsin:
Yes. We need to begin the tuning. We've already laid down the necessary markings.
All we need now is the help of a person who holds the true image of the city in their mind.

Behemoth:
Hmm... Actually, we did find someone, but we've run into a bit of a problem with her.
A young woman named Kazumi Yoshida.

Khamsin:
Oh, I take it you know her.
Ah, you must be the cause of the strange feeling I picked up from her.
As soon as she shows up, we can begin the actual tuning process.

Shana:
As you wish, I'll go and bring her here.

Alastor:
Will you be okay?

Shana:
I'll be fine. I will fulfill my mission as a Flame Haze.

It hurts!

Professor:
Right about now is when the Flame Hazes start meddling with my plans.
Oh, Domino, you know what to do next?

Domino:
Yes! It's time to begin the second phase!

Margery:
Be sealed!

Tanaka:
Oga-chan... Ah!... I'm sorry... I didn't expect that.
I can't give you an answer right now.
But I'll come back later and take care of this.

Yuji:
Sato!? How can he move around inside the Seal?
This is bad. I gotta do something! Anything! Can I do this?

Yoshida:
Aiiieee! ...
Yukari...?

Sato:
Sakai!?

Yuji:
Sato! Quick, this way!

Sato:
Sakai... But how...?

Professor:
It took a while that things are started to get exciting!
You can't wait to see what really it takes place next! Not can you!

Domino:
You got that right, Professor!



The Professor goes undetected as the Whole Sacred Chapel nears completion over Misaki City.
Shana fights as a Flame Haze, but she can feel Yuji's slipping away from her.
