  A heartbeat that lasts for eternity, lives consumed in soundless balls of fire.
No one can tell when the world is displaced and the flames of the Crimson World sweep over all.


Yuji:
There are many times of encounters. Some of them can lead to confrontation, or even battle.

Tanaka:
Those three are Denizens!

Sato:
Should we really be let them go?

Marcosias:
We didn't let them go. They let us go.

Margery:
Shut up, Stupid Marco...

Yuji:
One other encounter's like consisted of simple conversation between a Lord from another realm and a housewife.

Chigusa:
Besides, girls can be quite precocious. They're more mature than they appear.

Alastor:
Madam.

Yuji:
And what about Shana and I? Where is that going?
I have the feeling I wouldn't know the answer to that any time soon.

Wow.

Shana:
I'll never do it with you.

Ike:
Don't look so worried. Hirai and Sakai are just good friends, they're not in love with each other.

Yoshida:
I can't help it. I am worried... I have feelings for him. And I think maybe Yukari cares for him, too.
But then... who does Sakai like? I've got to stop thinking about it.
It's a little early, but let's go for a walk, Ekaterina.

Yuji:
Shana! Do you think you can go a little slower? We just finished training. This is a bit much.

Shana:
Shut up and run!

Yuji:
Ha! I only came here because you said you had something to show me. Oh, well, it better be worth it.
Oh, that's... a view.

Shana:
I love the view looks at night.

Yoshida:
Don't run off like that.

Ike:
How could Sakai be so casual about this? I don't get it. Does he know how Yoshida feels about it?
I mean she's loyal, she's attentive, she's admirable. So what's not to like about her? She's just great.

G'morning.

Yoshida:
Oh, good morning, Ike. You're early today?

Ike:
You're okay?

Yoshida:
I-I woke up really early this morning. I didn't get much sleep.
I walked my dog down to the riverbank, and then I... and then I...

Sorath:
What a feast!

Sydonay:
You sure you want me to hold on to the Orgel?

Tiriel:
Yes. I'm uneasy that I let my brother take care of it.
We have to find the owner of the Nietono no Shana, and make them hand it over to us.

Sydonay:
She didn't do anything yesterday. But I don't think the Chanter of Elegies is going to leave us alone for much longer.
Even you two would have trouble taking on two Flame Hazes at the same time.

Tiriel:
I'm not worried. And I'm the one making a decision, so just follow instructions.
You know as well as I do that Flame Hazes don't like to team up.
If any other insignificances attack, then I'll finish them all as well. It's as simple as that.

Sydonay:
Hmm. I understand what you're saying, but taking her lightly could be fairly dangerous.

Tiriel:
Oh, don't worry. As long as we stay inside this Cradle Garden, we're invincible.
That's why it's important that you take care of the Orgel. That's not too hard to understand, is it?

Tanaka:
Please, Big Sister! Tell us what really happened! It's not true that the Denizens let us go, is it?
The truth is you couldn't fight them because you were worried about our safety, right?
It burns me up that you were humiliated like that because we were holding you back!
Please! Say something! Big Sister!

Ike:
Having lunch on the roof is kind of a nice change?

Yuji:
I guess.

Ike:
I wanna talk to you about something that happened early this morning.
I had trouble sleeping, so I went for a stroll down by the Mana River.
I saw you down by the riverbank.

Yuji:
Oh.

Yoshida:
Ike...

Ike:
You said nothing's going on. That doesn't make any sense.
You accept Yoshida's affections, but then you go and do that?

Yuji:
Well, that's...

Ike:
Do you think that's right?

Yuji:
Hm?

Ike:
I said do you think that's right! If you keep playing games like this, you're gonna end up hurting someone!

Yoshida:
Stop it! I never asked you to do this, Ike. I didn't ask for this.

Ike:
But Yoshida...

Yoshida:
I'm not like that... I'm not!

Ike:
Actually, Yoshida was the one who saw you two this morning, not me.

Yuji:
I see...

Ike:
She told me about it before class.
I don't know why I reacted that way, but when I saw you eating the lunch she'd made for you, I just couldn't help myself.
I guess I stuck my nose in where I shouldn't have. I didn't mean anything by it.

Yuji:
I guess you screwed up every now and then, too.

Ike:
Screwed up? I guess you're right. Sorry...

Yuji:
It's cool. I'm embarrassed to admit it but, there's an amount of truth what you said.
But maybe you should have just kept it between us.

Ike:
Yeah...

Yuji:
Hey, can I ask you a question?

Ike:
Sure.

Yuji:
Do you... have feelings... for Yoshida?


Yoshida:
I'm so stupid. I'm just such an idiot! Ike didn't do anything wrong. But I panicked. Just because he had the courage to say the things I couldn't.
I'm so afraid to say anything. I thought it would work out if I left things alone.
Just because they're always hanging around each other, it didn't mean anything. They look so natural together.
I thought if I tried to come between them, whatever connection I have with Sakai, however small it might be, would be broken. And I'll be left alone.

Shana:
Why did you run away?

Yoshida:
Run away?
You're not being fair, Yukari!

Shana:
Fair about what?

Yoshida:
You must have feelings for him, too. Admit it, you like him!

Shana:
Me...? Have feelings for Yuji?

Yoshida:
You're always so cold, and you act like you don't care!
But you're so much closer to him than I am! It's not fair!

Shana:
It doesn't concern you.

Yoshida:
You are running away, too! Running from the truth!

Shana:
I'm what? Why should I stand here and take this kind of talk from you!?

Yoshida:
I have the right to say it. 'Cause I love him, too.
Did you hear what I just said? I love Sakai!

Shana:
Yuji... Yuji's my... He's my... What is he?

Yoshida:
Maybe you're right, Yukari. Maybe I was running away.
But not anymore. I decided I'm not gonna rely on others and leave things unsaid.
I can do a lot of things and I'm gonna do the best I can in my way.
Yukari, have you ever told Sakai that you have feelings for him? Humph. I'm gonna make sure I tell him my feelings.

Shana:
You can't.

Yoshida:
And I'm gonna tell him myself.

Shana:
No! Don't!

Yoshida:
And I'm gonna tell him that I love him.

Shana:
No! You can't! You can never tell him that!

Yoshida:
I will! I'll tell him! Well, let Sakai choose. I'm not gonna lose. You haven't even told him how you feel.

Shana:
You can't do that! I also have feelings! I also have feelings for him!

Yuji:
I think this is a... It's a Seal!

Shana:
Who do you think you are? How do you stand in my way?
When I'm done, I'm gonna come back and tell you how I feel.
You don't stand the chance with him! Yuji and I have a lot going-on between us!
You are crazy if you think that I'm gonna lose to you! I will not lose to you!

Sorath:
Hey, Tiriel! I can sense it. The Nietono no Shana is over there!

Tiriel:
Very well then. Let us retrieve it together, without further delay, Dear Brother.

Margery:
Engulfed in Love... The siblings from yesterday... They're cooking up something big out there.

Marcosias:
What are you going to do, Margery Daw, My Beautiful Goblet? Let them let us escape again?

Margery:
Yeah. After all, they're not after me. There's no reason to go through the trouble of a confrontation.

Tanaka:
Why not!? Why don't you wanna go!? It's not like you to be this timid!
With everything we can, not to getting in your way! Please, Big Sister! Fight them!

Sato:
Never mind. If you're not gonna go, then I'll head over there.
I'd rather do that than be seen as someone who holds your back.

Margery:
Listen, you two.

Tanaka:
I'm going with him, Big Sister! I'll show you that when I have to, I can fight, too.

Margery:
Oh, all right! All right, already! We'll start by heading over the department store.
That present the doll freak left for us might come in handy.

Tanaka:
Let's do it!

Yuji:
Is this the Seal?

Shana:
Looks like it. But I don't understand why it's so big.

Yuji:
Could it be a trap or some sort?

Shana:
Mm-hm. I sense three Denizens. Two of them are coming this way.

Alastor:
And one stay yet.

Shana:
Three against one. Not the best odds.

Yuji:
Wait, Shana. Margery. How about if we ask her to help out.

Shana:
Remember when we saw her by the pool. The Chanter of Elegies won't be of any use to us now.

Alastor:
Our first priority is to deal with ones coming after us.

Shana:
Yuji, you're gonna have to go and hide somewhere.

Yuji:
Hey, wait a minute! I'm going with you!

Shana:
This battle could be dangerous.

Yuji:
I'm ready.

Shana:
If these Denizens attack you with something your Fire Repelling Ring can't handle, you'll be wiped out instantly.

Alastor:
There's nothing you can do in this battle. Therefore there's no reason for you to come with us.

Yuji:
Okay, then...

Shana:
However, there is one thing that puzzles me.

Alastor:
Maintaining the Seal with this size requires an enormous amount of the power of existence, more than is available here.
Do you see what I'm getting at?

Yuji:
I think so. You're saying there's some kind of device or something holding this Seal up.

Shana:
Yes. A Treasure, an Unrestricted Method, or even something we've never heard about.

Yuji:
Okay, then. I'll head out and look for it.

Alastor:
Just calm down. It's not going to be that easy to find.

Shana:
Don't forget. Our opponents have control of the entire city.
You could be attacked by a Rinne or even the Denizen without warning.

Yuji:
Denizens or Rinne... Right. I'll do whatever I can to help.

Shana:
Thanks.

Yuji:
Hey, Shana! If I end up helping you, how about you give me a little reward?

Shana:
A reward? Just shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Get outta here!

Yuji:
Right. See ya.

Alastor:
Let's go.

Sorath:
Look up, Tiriel. It's the Nietono no Shana. The Nietono no Shana is right there!

Tiriel:
Indeed it is, Dear Brother. Please wait just a little longer.
It's a pleasure to meet you. This is Engulfed in Self Love. And I'm Engulfed in Love for Others.
We're also known as Sorath and Tiriel. Forgive my asking but, who you are in contract with?

Shana:
I am the Flame Haze of Alastor, the Flame of Heaven!
I am the Flame-Haired Blazing-Eyed Hunter, Shana!

Tiriel:
A Flame of Heaven is an old name if I'm not very much mistaken. But none of that really matters right now.
We only made this little side trip to have a brief moment of fun with you.

Shana:
Side trip? Who are these two? Ah! It's creepy [the way to] hanging on to each other.

Tiriel:
The reason we're here is simple. I want you to give that sword you're holding to my brother, Sorath.

Shana:
You want me to what?

Tiriel:
Is there something wrong with your ears? Or maybe it's your brain? I said I want you to give that sword.

Shana:
I heard you!

Sorath:
I want the Nietono no Shana. Ha!

Tiriel:
So, tell me. How do you like the taste of my brother's Bloodsucker?
When you add power of existence to it, you can injure your opponent by merely touching the other person's sword.

Shana:
That is not good.

Alastor:
We can't attack recklessly.

Sorath:
I want the Nietono no Shana real bad! Wait, come back, Nietono no Shana!

Tanaka:
So, everyone's frozen because of an Unrestricted Method?

Marcosias:
Yeah. You got a hand to those perverted siblings. They threw this whole thing up and we didn't even notice.

Sato:
Ah, what's the situation now?

Margery:
Out of the three we ran into yesterday, two of them are fighting the little brat. The other one is somewhere outside the city.

Tanaka:
So when are you going?

Margery:
Why should I go? I thought I told you already it's not as if they're after me.

Sato:
Miss Margery.

Margery:
Now what?

Sato:
One of the Torches is moving.

Marcosias:
What?

Margery:
Are you sure?

Yuji:
Man, why did I say I wanted to help out. This is creepy. It'll be safe if I just stay here.
No, I can't do that. If I wanna help them, I have to go out. I hope nothing's out there.

Shana:
I'm okay.

Alastor:
We underestimated their abilities.

Sorath:
Give me the Nietono no Shana!

Shana:
You cannot get it! [can forget it!]

Tiriel:
Ah, what an awesome sight.

Yuji:
Okay... A Denizen!? A Rinne!?

Tiriel:
Now go, Brother. Take it from her hand.

Sorath:
The Nietono no Shana! It's mine! It's mine! At last, it's mine! At last, it's mine! Mine! Mine!

Shana:
Now!

Tiriel:
Sorath! No!

Shana:
You're next...!

Sorath:
That was awesome! So that's the Nietono no Shana's power! You got a flame sword!

Alastor:
That's impossible! He recovered too quickly!

Shana:
Now I get it, Alastor. This monster Seal is different from the others.
It's more like a factory designed to supply them with an uninterrupted power of existence!

Alastor:
Hmm... That makes sense. It would explain their great power and that recovering we just [witnessed].

Shana:
The question is where are these two hiding the real source of their power.

Tiriel:
It's unforgivable! To think someone like you actually hurt my brother!
And then the most horrendous insult of all, you even stepped on his beautiful face!
Oh, you poor dear... It must have been so painful.

Sorath:
It's awesome, Tiriel. Like I expected, the sword is incredible!

Tiriel:
It's nice to hear, but you have to use this sword for now. We'll collect the other one soon enough.

Sorath:
Right.

Shana:
I can sense it. If I'm right, the source of their energy's somewhere near.

Tiriel:
Come in! Get us! It's pointless! Where do you think you're going!?

Shana:
I'm close... The secret they were trying to hide from me... is there!

Tiriel:
Stop, Flame Haze!

Shana:
All I need is one second, one breath, enough strength to strike! You will burn!
No!


Sorath will do anything to require the Nietono no Shana.
And Tiriel will do anything to make sure her brother gets it.
What does Shana see when the Engulfed in Love siblings embrace in front of her?
