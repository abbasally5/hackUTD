Kazumi:
 Don't run off like that. Huh?

Shana:
 Isn't this a beautiful view, Yuji?

Yuji:
 Yeah, it's great. But, would you please stop eating your melon bread on top of my head?

Shana:
 Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

Yuji:
 And you're getting bread crumbs everywhere.

Shana:
 Why don't you just eat the bread crumbs.

Yuji:
 It's really difficult to clean them up.

Shana:
 Just eat the bread crumbs, Yuji...

Yuji:
 I'm the one who gets yelled at, you know.

Kazumi:
 You never let me down, would you?

Shana:
 Yuji, I just want to look at the view with you.

Kazumi:
 I'm definitely gonna kill her!


Voice:
Takeya~ Saodake~


Shana:
 But you don't know anything about Yuji.

Kazumi:
 I'll get to know him.

Shana:
 You can't.

Kazumi:
 Why not?

Shana:
 Because I said so.

Kazumi:
 The reason? Just because you said so is ...

Shana:
 xxx...

Wilhelmina:
 She is indeed detestable.

Tiamat:
Who is xxx.


Wilhelmina:
 Eloim Essaim. I seek and call upon the dark spirits.

Tiamat:
Who is Kenji Sawada.


Wilhelmina:
 Indeed, I am hungry as well.

Tiamat:
Suggest Yakiniku.


Wilhelmina:
 Huh? Indeed, I think I prefer ginger pork to Yakiniku.

Tiamat:
Hooray for pork then.


Wilhelmina:
 Roger.


Kazumi:
 Uh...

Yuji:
 Yoshida?

Kazumi:
 It's incredible.
 It's just so...


Yuji:
 Miss Yoshida.

Shana:
 You just called her Miss Yoshida.

Kazumi:
 Oh, Sakai...

Shana:
 Hey, what are you looking at?
 What are you staring?

Yuji:
 Where did they come from?

Shana:
 Kazumi Yoshida, you stop that.

Yuji:
 They're stupendous.
 Is this an invitation?

Shana:
 ... than I thought. Oh, I give up. You both idiots!

Kazumi:
 Ekaterina?

Shana:
 Run! You run!

Kazumi:
 Sakai?

Shana:
 Burn!

Yuji:
 Oh, Yoshida.
 Ekaterina is... ah...
 Ekaterina is on fire.

Shana:
 Go! Run!

Kazumi:
 Sakai?

Shana:
 Burn!

Yuji:
 Uh... Yoshida, your dog.
 Your dog looks a little different now.

Shana:
 Yeah! Go! Go!

Kazumi:
 Sakai?

Shana:
 Burn!

Yuji:
 Uh... Yoshida, you know.
 Do you hear, go on through a lot of dogs.

Marchosias:
What do you think you are doing?
I don't care if maids are popular these days.
I think you're taking this a little too far.


Tiamat:
Ugly.


Margery:
 What did you just say?

Tiamat:
Hideous.


Margery:
 Say that again!

Tiamat:
Ugly. Hideous. xxx. xxx. disgusting...


Margery:
 How dare you! Who are you calling an ugly!

Marchosias:
I guess I'm the perfect partner for you after all.
Hmm... Why me?

Voice:
Takeya~ Saodake~


Kazumi:
 Round number two starts today.

Shana:
 Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

Kazumi:
 Well, best of luck to you anyways, Shana tan.
 You're not that bad for someone so tiny.

Shana:
 I am not tiny! I'm not little! You ... [You made me think that] you're stupid.

Wilhelmina:
 I'm not a detestable woman.

Tiamat:
Who is xxx.


Wilhelmina:
 My body is like steel.
 My heart empty as the sky.
 The demon king has finished.

Tiamat:
Who is Sonny Chiba.


Wilhelmina:
 Oh, by the way, I'm hungry again.

Tiamat:
Ginger pork.


Wilhelmina:
 Roger. Hooray for pork.
 We did this.

Tiamat:
Que sera sera.


Mami Kawada:
Soshite~


Alastor:
 Hmm... Just when I thought she'd avoided the peril of that last adventure.
 Hmm... It seems a new danger looms on the horizon.
 Hmm... But wait, where am I?
 Hmm... The temperature is quite a bit cooler than usual.
 And xxx, now here the haunting sound of the wind and there.
 After emerging from a long tunnel that formulize it a pure white landscape like out of great literature.
 Shana tan Returns!
