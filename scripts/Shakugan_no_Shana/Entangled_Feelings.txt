  A heartbeat that lasts for eternity, lives consumed in soundless balls of fire.
No one can tell when the world is displaced and the flames of the Crimson World sweep over all.


Yuji:
Shana and I were spending a lot of time together. In fact, you could say things were almost normal.
There were times when I even forgot she was a Flame Haze, and was looking more like an ordinary girl to me every day.
But the training that I had begun after our battle with Friagne was still on going.
Those lessons brought me my wandering thoughts back to reality pretty quickly.
Ow!
Then, I remember that Shana is a strong, experienced Flame Haze.

Shana:
You're late.

Yuji:
Sorry.

Shana:
Let's begin. Same as yesterday. Sense the "kill", and avoid the attack.

Yuji:
You know, that looked good on her.

Shana:
Stop daydreaming!

Yuji:
I-I wasn't! You know, you don't have to keep hitting me so hard, Shana!

Shana:
Look, it's pointless unless I use some force.
If you don't like getting hit, you should learn to avoid it.

Yuji:
I've been working on keeping my eyes open. One thing at a time, okay?


Shana:
I can see that you're starting to feel the "kill", so you should be able to sense a simple attack.
It's like playing rock-paper-scissors when you already know what your opponent will do.
What's funny?

Yuji:
Rock-paper-scissors... You just learned to play that a little while ago. Now you talk like an expert.

Shana:
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Just stop talking nonsense during our training!

Yuji:
Hey! How about a warning!?

Shana:
Attacks always come without warning!

Yuji:
But...! But that's too fast!

Alastor:
Goodness, you're clumsy.

Shana:
It's because you're always talking nonsense, you end up in these situations.

Yuji:
I asked you to wait! Jeez, would it have killed you to hold back for a bit?

Shana:
An enemy will not wait for you.

Yuji:
I know that! But come on! This is a training session, remember?

Alastor:
Excuses are for the incompetent.

Yuji:
Oh, boy... my pants...

Shana:
If that was a Denizen, you'd be eaten by now.

Yuji:
Yeah. Whatever... That's enough for today... I gotta get ready for school.

Shana:
Yuji...

Chigusa:
Oh, where's Yu-chan? Are you done already?

Shana:
I guess the training wasn't going his way, so he decided to end it early.

Chigusa:
Looks like he got knocked around a bit.

Shana:
He's been in worse shape on other days. But it's never bothered him like this.

Chigusa:
Maybe he's realizing how awkward he looks compared to you.

Shana:
What do you mean "awkward"?

Chigusa:
You're a cute girl. You wear a dress. And you're smaller than he is.
From a boy's point of view, being beaten up by a girl can be pretty embarrassing.

Shana:
I can't change the fact that I'm stronger than he is.

Chigusa:
But boys have a tendency to show off in front of others, especially in front of girls they're trying to impress.

Shana:
Yuji's trying to impress me? I just want him to be...

Chigusa:
Have a nice day, you two!

Shana:
So, here's the plan. Today after school, I'm gonna set up a Seal, so we can practice some bigger moves.

Yuji:
It's your call, but shouldn't we be working on complicated moves that soon?

Shana:
It's part of your training. So I wouldn't worry about it.

Yuji:
Well... I guess you would know.

Chigusa:
Being beaten up by a girl can be pretty embarrassing.

Shana:
As your training progresses, you'll be less embarrassing.

Yuji:
Is that your way of encouraging me?

Shana:
I'm just telling you the way things stand.

Yuji:
Which means I look really lame right now.

Shana:
It doesn't matter how you look. Yuji, what's important is that you get stronger, so that we can fight together.
You have to get much stronger...

Oh, here. I've got one yen.

Sato:
You buying lunch today?

Tanaka:
Uh-huh. So howâ€™s Big Sister?

Sato:
[Lot of] the same.

Tanaka:
Too bad... I guess when she's feeling a bit better, she's gonna take off and leave the city. Maybe...
Don't get me wrong! I really want Big Sister to get better. Honestly! I swear it!

Sato:
Yeah, yeah, I know.

Tanaka:
Man, I'm starving.

Ike:
Ogata. You wanna come eat with us?

Ogata:
Ah... Sure.
Did you make these, Kazumi? They look great!

Ike:
I am amazed!

Yoshida:
I got the recipe from my friend, so I thought I'd give it a try.

Ogata:
I thank you very much!

Yoshida:
Please, or don't you like these?

Yuji:
Sure. I'll have one. Thank you.

Yoshida:
Will you like one?

Shana:
Sure. Thank you.

Ogata:
Mmm, delicious!

Ike:
Wow, this is way better than store-bought.

Yuji:
Yup. Tasty.

Yoshida:
Oh, you really think so?

Yuji:
You know, Yoshida, you're a good cook.

Yoshida:
Oh, no... I just really love baking.

Shana:
It's good. But... I'm not enjoying it...

Student:
Excuse me. Are there any library committee members?

Ogata:
Over here. That's the two of us.

Student:
Ah, do you have a moment?
They've changed the schedule, and are going to be re-stacking the books today.
Report to the library after school.

Ogata:
What? You mean today?

Student:
Every class has to send two people, so if you can't make it, try to find someone to go for you.

Yoshida:
You can't go?

Ogata:
No. My family and I are visiting my gran in a hospital. She's sick.

Yoshida:
Really?

Ike:
Huh? Why don't you take her place, Sakai? And you go with Yoshida.
I have prep school today, but you're not doing anything, right?

Yuji:
I'm free.

Ike:
Well, that's it, then.
Are you fine with that, Yoshida?

Yoshida:
But... I'd... be imposing.

Yuji:
We have to send two people anyway. I'll do it!

Yoshida:
Oh, thank you. I owe you one.

Shana:
No, he can't make it.

Yuji:
But, why not?

Shana:
Today after school, I'm gonna set up a Seal, so we can practice some bigger moves.

Ogata:
What? Do you have previous plans?

Yuji:
Oh, that's right. I just remembered that I asked Hirai to show me her notes later.
Sorry, but we'll have to do it some other time.

Ogata:
She seems upset...

Yuji:
I was the one who asked her. I'll go apologize, properly.
Shana, I'm sorry. But it has to do with the school committee.
We can do our training later on this evening.

Shana:
I think I made it clear we were going to do it after school.

Yuji:
I didn't have a choice!

Shana:
You could have refused.

Yuji:
Look, I already said I'd go. It's too late now!

Shana:
Getting you trained is more important.

Yuji:
Sure, but... School's important, too!

Shana:
This is more important! And we agreed first!

Yuji:
Hey, I already said I'm sorry!

Shana:
You were the one who asked to be trained, Yuji!

Yuji:
I know, but... it's just one day!

Shana:
You're not serious enough about this!

Yuji:
No, that's not true!

Shana:
I don't want you to go today.

Yuji:
And why not?

Shana:
I just don't!

Yuji:
Yeah well, that's not a good enough reason! I'm helping out the committee today.

Shana:
Listen, Yuji. You really have to train more!
Honestly you're just too weak. You're so damn clumsy.
You're worse than useless, you can't even help me right now!
And that's why...!

Yuji:
Yeah, I know that...

Shana:
Yuji...

Ogata:
How was Hirai?

Yuji:
Yeah. Everything's fine. She wasn't that upset.
We talked, and she just got a few things off from her mind.

Ogata:
That's good.

Ike:
Guess you'll be staying late tonight with Sakai, Yoshida.

Yoshida:
Yeah...


Chigusa:
Ah, Shana-chan. Are you alone? Where's Yuji?

Shana:
Huh? Oh, he's got some kind of committee meeting.

Chigusa:
Oh. Do you wanna wait inside? I made some delicious pudding.
So, you live alone, don't you? That must be hard.

Shana:
No. I'm used to it. This is really good. Chigusa's is much better.

Chigusa:
Good. Glad you like it. You know, Shana-chan, you should stay for dinner tonight.

Shana:
Huh?

Yuji:
Damn...

Yoshida:
What'll I do? We're gonna have to walk home together.
We'll have to talk... What if I run outta things to say...?

Yuji:
Hey, are you okay?

Yoshida:
Uh-huh.

Students:
Hey, I just heard about this. You know Hirai from Class Two? She's getting hundreds on all her tests.

I know. And she's top of the class in Phys Ed, too. I guess people like her do exist.

Yoshida:
Umm... I...

Yuji:
Yes?

Yoshida:
Well, I... Nothing.
I have to ask him about Yukari.
If I keep thinking about her like this, I'm gonna go crazy.
I really have to know, what do you think of Yukari?

Yuji:
What?

Yoshida:
Those girls from Class Three were talking about her. She's cool, isn't she?

Yuji:
Umm... yeah. She's something all right. She sure is. It's a little overwhelming.

Yoshida:
Idiot! Idiot! Show a little backbone!

Yuji:
I'm home.

Chigusa:
That's a long day for you. We already had supper, and Shana-chan even had time to take a bath.
What do you think? This dress was mine, but I convinced her to try it on for size.

Yuji:
Ah, yeah. Looks good on you.

Chigusa:
It's getting late. You should walk her home now, Yu-chan.

Yuji:
Mom sure would be shocked if she found that you're actually staying in my room at night, wouldn't she?
Shana?

Shana:
We'll begin today's training.

Yuji:
No way. Forget it. It's too late.

Shana:
Huh, Yuji!?

Yuji:
See ya.

Shana:
Why...?

Alastor:
It seems when you get right down to it, he doesn't quite have what it takes.

Shana:
If only a Denizen would show up... Even another Flame Haze.
If we had to fight, then I'm sure Yuji would focus.

Huh? A Seal... But what?

Rinne:
Power of existence... My sweet power of existence...

Marcosias:
What's this? Is that a Rinne?

Margery:
Feels like it.

Marcosias:
What a pathetic excuse for a Seal. Are you gonna go?

Margery:
I was thinking about it, I can't remember any rhymes.

Marcosias:
What!? Are you serious!? You're the Chanter of Elegies!

Margery:
It's the truth, and that's all there is to it.
I can't remember a single verse. I'm in rough shape.
There you go. We'll let the little brat handle it.

Shana:
Yuji's not coming! Yuji's not coming! Why not? I just want him to be...
What's that thing doing?

Rinne:
It's mine! It's mine!

Alastor:
It's obviously mad. It's likely a Rinne that has lost its master.

Shana:
It has no master? And that means it's gonna just disappear in few days.

Alastor:
Hmm... No matter how much existence a Rinne consumes, it cannot use the power itself.

Rinne:
Come on, Flame Haze! Tools for Destruction, you killed my master! But I'm still here. I will not disappear!

Shana:
You're wrong. Your time's almost up.

Rinne:
Oh no, I am going to exist!
It's mine! It's mine!

Shana:
What the!? He's all flab! His body's so spongy, it's hard to cut!

Rinne:
... No! Stop it! You're cutting away my existence all! Don't go! Don't go!

Chigusa:
Do you have plans for today?
You've been acting restless all morning. You keep looking at the window.

Yuji:
Ah, I'm meeting a friend. But it doesn't really matter if I don't go.

Chigusa:
Oh?

Yuji:
If I show up, I won't be any help anyway.

Chigusa:
Did your friend say that? Or is that what you told yourself?

Yuji:
Ow, ow!

Rinne:
Existence! Must get power of existence!

Shana:
Give it up! You're gonna vanish no matter how much you eat!

Rinne:
No! I won't! I refuse to go!

Shana:
Deranged!

Alastor:
Although it has a large body, its core must be quite tiny.
We're going to have to keep cutting until we destroy that center.

Rinne:
My existence! I must eat power... power of existence!

Shana:
I told you it's pointless!
Shut up!

Rinne:
Don't erase me! Don't cut away my...

Shana:
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

Yuji:
Excuse me.

Chigusa:
You know, Yu-chan. About your friend, perhaps they want you to come because they think you can help.
I think there're times when you can help a friend out just by being there for them.

Yuji:
Thanks, Mom.

Chigusa:
You're welcome.

I think there're times when you can help a friend out just by being there for them.

Yuji:
Shana can fight even if I'm not around. Because she's so strong...
Shana? Sha...!

Rinne:
I don't wanna disappear... Why? Why?

Shana:
It's 'cause you're a Rinne!

Rinne:
Don't do it! I don't wanna be destroyed! No! Stop it! Don't... Don't do it! Don't do it! I do exist!

Yuji:
Shana... Shana, are you okay?

Shana:
I'm all right. I'm not hurt. I'm used to this sort of thing. I'm just a little tired.

Yuji:
Shana, I... I'm sorry.

Shana:
Yuji, why...? It hurts, Yuji. It hurts to be alone...

Yuji:
Shana... I'm sorry. I left you alone. Sorry.

Shana:
You have to become stronger. A lot stronger!

Yuji:
I will. I'll do it. So that way... we can stay together.

Boys:
Better not getting any of that garbage on me, man!

Wow, awesome! This kid's wallet is packed!

I bet he's some rich guy's son.

Hey, guess you'd like to call for help, wouldn't ya?

Next batter, hitting fourth, the first base man!

Tiriel:
That's enough, you roaches!

Boys:
Huh? No way! Get a load of this!

We got ourselves a princess here!

Tiriel:
Dear Brother, you should have listened. You should've waited like I told you to.

Sorath:
Ah, I have been waiting. Look, I haven't eaten these guys yet.

Tiriel:
Indeed. You haven't, Brother.

Boys:
What the hell are you talking about, huh?

Tiriel:
I think it's all right now, Dear Brother.
You can help yourself to them whenever you like.
Oh, that was very well done.
You remember to leave just enough of them to form three little Torches.

Sorath:
Of course. Because that's what you told me to do, Sister Tiriel.

Tiriel:
I'm pleased, Dear Brother.

Sydonay:
Those two... Sorath and Tiriel, Engulfed in Self Love, Engulfed in Love for Others...


A Flame Haze is growing up as a normal girl.
Alastor and Chigusa decide to have a talk about her.
