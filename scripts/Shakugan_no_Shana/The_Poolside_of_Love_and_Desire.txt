  A heartbeat that lasts for eternity, lives consumed in soundless balls of fire.
No one can tell when the world is displaced and the flames of the Crimson World sweep over all.


Yuji:
During the intense battle with the Flame Haze known as the Chanter of Elegies, Shana rises to the occasion and discovers new powers within her.
She emerges victorious, and both friend and foe bid each other farewell.
After a struggle like that, it's only natural to take a break.
But at the time, I had no way of knowing that Shan's next battle was just around the corner.

Lamies:
Don't go after Silver. You'd be wasting your time.

Yuji:
Go easier.

Shana:
You're the one who asked for lessons.

Yuji:
Yeah, I know. But still...

Yoshida:
No, it's just a coincidence. Don't worry. I'm sure I'm wrong.

Yuji:
Man, it's really scorching. How can it be this hot so early in the morning?

Shana:
Well, it's summer time, Yuji. It's supposed to be hot.

Yuji:
Yeah, I know, but...

Shana:
I think you should put more of your heart into your training.
We've been training every morning, but you haven't improved one bit!

Yuji:
Hey, give me a break. Some people are naturally gifted, but I'm not.

Alastor:
Already working for an excuse.

Yuji:
Hm?

Shana:
He's saying we've just started, so don't try talking your way out of the lessons.
We'll have a better idea, whether you're gifted or not, once you've learned to move about a little more naturally.
You need to focus more.

Yuji:
Hey, wait up! Shana!

Students:
Yo, thanks dude.

Thanks a lot, Ike.

Yuji:
Hey, man. What are you doing?

Ike:
Hi. Check it, I scored a bunch of these free passes.
My dad's connectionâ€™s at work got them all these tickets to Misaki Water Land.
I thought I'd hand them out to the class.

Yuji:
Oh, right! Misaki Water Land! That's the place with those commercials "get wet", right?

Commercial:
Get your bikinis on, Misaki Water Land! Get wet.

Ike:
Oh, yeah. I figured these would go over pretty well.

Yuji:
They're gonna love it. Way to go, Ike!

Ike:
Here's yours, Hirai.

Students:
Would you get new bathing suit?

Yeah, let's go shopping!

Shana:
There's his stunned look again.

Yuji:
Hey, Shana. We both got free tickets, so you wanna go check this place out tomorrow or what? Huh? Shana?

Teacher:
What? What is it? You can't have a complaint. We haven't even started class yet.

Shana:
Your necktie sucks.

Teacher:
What? Hmm...?
It's in style!

Shana:
What is wrong with Yuji? His face gets all slack over a stupid picture like this.

Alastor:
A ticket to a place of swimming?

Shana:
I guess so.

Alastor:
For some reason, human beings like to play around in water.
It's only natural they would see it as a leisure activity.

Shana:
That's no excuse for letting his face get all loose. No wonder he can't focus on his training.

Alastor:
Hmm...

Shana:
I was wondering, Alastor.

Alastor:
What is it?

Shana:
Do you think this Water Land place feels as good as a bath does?

Alastor:
I have no idea...

Shana:
Yeah, I guess not...

Student:
Hey, let's eat on the roof.

Yuji:
Shana's been gone for the whole morning.

Student:
Hi, where'd you go, Hirai?

Shana:
I went out.

Yuji:
Where were you this morning?

Shana:
I went to a bakery.

Yuji:
A bakery?

Shana:
The best yet. You have to get just the right combination of crisp and sponge for the perfect melon bread. You know what I mean?

Yuji:
Well, sure, if you say so.

Yoshida:
It's just... I was... It's just... I-I was thinking we could all sit together. You know, I mean our lunches...

Ike:
This is nice for a change, isn't it?
Don't you find friends and good conversation make food taste better? Better than eating alone.

Yuji:
Mm-hm. For sure.

Yoshida:
I... Ah... I mean... that is, you see... well... I... it's just... Sakai!

Yuji:
Uh, what is it?

Yoshida:
Well, I was wondering... you... you always bring rice balls from the convenient store for your lunch.

Yuji:
Yeah. It's my mom.
She says a man who counts on his mother for three meals a day isn't gonna go very far in life, or something along those lines.

Yoshida:
She says that?

Yuji:
Yeah.

Ike:
Why don't you just say it? You were gonna invite him to Misaki Water Land, weren't you?

Yoshida:
But... But it's hard.

Ogata:
Guys! I just had a great idea.
Since Ike was nice enough to give us these tickets, why don't we all go to Water Land this Sunday as a group?

Yoshida:
Ogata... All of us means... everyone?!

Ogata:
Yeah! Well, of course I don't mean the whole class, but everyone here for sure.
And... what about those two over there?

Ike:
I don't mind it at all. What do you think, Sakai?

Yuji:
Er, sure. Sounds great.

Ogata:
How about you, Hirai? It wouldn't be the same if our class heroine didn't come along.

Shana:
You want... me?

Yuji:
Yeah. Why not? Let's go.

Shana:
Sure. I guess.

Ogata:
Then it's settled! We'll meet there at ten o'clock Sunday.
And you two guys better not be late. You've got a real reputation for never being on time.

Sato:
We're not going, sorry. We decide where we get them.

Tanaka:
Oga-chan. Sorry, we've got plans. Maybe next time.

Ogata:
Shoot.

Tanaka:
You know, I kind of feel bad for Oga-chan.

Sato:
It couldn't be helped.
Don't forget, we're busy because you're the one who insisted we take Margery somewhere healthy this weekend.

Tanaka:
I know. I don't really understand it, but ever since she came back, she's done nothing but stay inside and drink.
We need to help her. She's gonna make herself sick if she doesn't get out and have some fun.

Marcosias:
Welcome home you two. She's been an idiot again today, My Sleeping Princess of Overindulgence, Margery Daw.

Margery:
Hello. You boys are home early. That's a fact.

Ogata:
How does that one look?

Yoshida:
Good. It's not too showy. I can wear this.
Ogata!? Ogata... Are you serious!?

Ogata:
Look, you're going to the pool with boys. Don't wear something boring.
You're not getting your clothes back until you try it on.

Yoshida:
I can't!

Ogata:
I'm doing this as a friend. C'mon! Hurry up and put it on!

Yoshida:
Okay...

Ogata:
Well, are you ready?

Yoshida:
Almost...

Ogata:
Are you ready now?

Yoshida:
Yeah, I guess... but...

Ogata:
Then hurry up and show me! Wow...

Yoshida:
Ogata! Have mercy!

Ogata:
This one next. Or would you rather try this one on?

Yoshida:
I'd rather go on a regular one-piece, thanks!

Chigusa:
Here you are, Shana-chan. I got you a swimsuit.
I know you have a suit for P.E., but I thought you wanna wear something a little different.

Shana:
Oh, why is that?

Chigusa:
Because then you can wear something cute, not like the standard ones at school.
Why don't you try it on?

Shana:
Sure.

Chigusa:
It's best if you wait out here.

Alastor:
Didn't you learn anything from the last time?

Yuji:
It was a misunderstanding.


Yuji:
Man, it's gigantic!

Ike:
Having one of these close-by makes the summers bearable.

Ogata:
It doesn't look like Tanaka and Sato are coming. They're not even answering the phone.
But who cares if they decided they had something better to do. The five of us will have a blast!

Ike:
It'll be great.
What is it?

Yoshida:
Look at this poster.

Ike:
Couples Water Competition...

Ogata:
Let's see here. Mixed couple teams will compete against each other in the pool.
The winning team will receive an all-expenses paid dinner with all the fresh bread you can eat at an exclusive restaurant with a night view!

Shana:
All the fresh bread you can eat?

Yoshida:
Dinner for two at a fancy restaurant...

Yuji:
Cheers to your beautiful eyes.

Yoshida:
Oh, thank you.

Ogata:
Looks like fun! It doesn't start till this afternoon. Who's up for it?

Shana:
I'll do it.

Yoshida:
I wanna give it a try, too.

Ogata:
Then it's settled! We don't have enough boys, but we'll deal with that problem later!

Yuji:
Oh, that's her!

Ogata:
Sorry for the wait.

Ike:
Where are Yoshida and Hirai?

Ogata:
Relax! They're coming!
Let me present without further ado, the Yukari and Kazumi Swimsuit Fashion Show!
First, Miss Hirai, come on out!

Shana:
What's wrong?

Yuji, Ike:
Nothing's wrong.

Ogata:
And Miss Yoshida, come on out! Kazumi?

Yoshida:
Hey, Ogata... I really don't think I can do this...

Ogata:
Go! Get out there!

Yuji, Ike:
Oh!

Margery:
It's so hot... I'm dying...

Tanaka:
Big Sister, it's for your own good.
You're gonna get sick if you stay indoor all the time.

Margery:
I'll be dead if I stay out here much longer.

Tanaka:
You may be right. But still...

Margery:
Eita, what is that?

Sato:
Margery, do you really wanna go in there?

Margery:
Bet your ass I do. This looks like the perfect place to help beat the heat.

Tanaka:
Hey, ah, let's come back tomorrow. Today isn't the best day for visiting the park.

Yuji:
Something wrong?

Shana:
The Chanter of Elegies is here.

Yuji:
The Chanter of... That woman's here?

Shana:
I don't sense any anger in her. What's so funny?

Yuji:
You two are. These tough Flame Hazes are showing up in the pool just to relax and have fun.
It's kind of amusing in a way.
Shana, stop it!

Shana:
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

Ogata:
I'm going to the food stand.

Ike:
Okay.

Sato:
Now, look where we are.

Tanaka:
We didn't have a choice. Once she wants something, that's it.
But this is a risk. What if we run into Oga-chan and the others?

Sato:
Come on, it'll be okay. I mean, look at all the people here. Chances are we'll never even see them.

Ogata:
Wh-What are you guys doing here!?

Tanaka:
Oga-chan...

Ogata:
You better have an excuse!

Sato:
Umm... we can explain this...

Margery:
I only asked them to go and buy me one lousy drink.
What is taking those two so long?

Marcosias:
You know what I think? They finally had enough for the bottomless booze hound.

Ogata:
Hm? What the hell is going on? You turned down my invitation to come, and then you show up anyway!?
Did you two come here with someone else?

Yuji:
What's going on back there?

Margery:
Don't know. I'm not sure, but it sounds like a case of jealousy to me.

Sato:
You see, kinda....

Ogata:
Tell me!

Shana:
So you really did come here just to relax by the pool?

Margery:
Yeah. That's right. I don't feel like getting into a tussle with you. Find someone else to fight.
All the Chanter of Elegies wants right now to lie by the pool with a cooler drink.

Alastor:
Well, I see, her days as a Flame Haze are over.

Shana:
Humph, not that it matters to us what she wants to do.

Ogata:
Then you said you weren't coming yesterday because you wanted to surprise us?

Tanaka:
Yeah, that's it. We thought if we just said yes, everyone wouldn't be that appreciated of our presence, right, Sato?

Sato:
Yeah. Well, we thought we'd show up suddenly and make things interesting for you. Right, Tanaka?

Tanaka:
That's right.

Tanaka:
And you never bothered to tell me.

Tanaka:
Like I said I'm real sorry...

Ogata:
Then you won't mind helping us in a water fight!

Sato, Tanaka:
Water fight?

Ike:
Got that? The person at the other end will be your partner.
The odd man out will cheer them on, okay?

Tanaka:
What'll we do? Big Sister is still waiting for us.

Sato:
What other choice do we have? Better to play along than them finding out about her.

Ike:
Okay, I'm letting go.

Announcer:
It's the moment you've been waiting for! A tradition here at Misaki Water Land, the Couples Water Battle Competition!
It's pretty simple. The person with the most headbands at the end wins the contest. However, if you should lose your own headband...

Yuji:
Where's Ike? He said he was just going to the bathroom.

Ogata:
I thought he was gonna cheer all of us on.

Announcer:
The team with the most headbands at the end of regulation time will receive the prize package including dinner at the city's finest restaurant!

Yoshida:
Dinner with Sakai at a restaurant... Dinner with Sakai at a restaurant with the night view!

Shana:
Win, and get all the melon bread you can eat! Win, and get all the melon bread you can eat!

Ogata:
Understand, Tanaka? This all depends on you, keeping your legs moving.

Tanaka:
Yeah. I know what to do.

Yuji:
Yoshida. Let's do our best, 'kay?

Yoshida:
Yeah, okay.

Yuji:
Don't be so tense. Try relaxing a bit more.

Yoshida:
I'll try.

Announcer:
It's frantic! It's fun! It's the Couples Water Battle! You only have three minutes! And ready!

Tanaka:
There's no sense jumping on each other. Let's target other teams first.

Sato:
Okay.

Yuji:
Good idea.

Yoshida:
Oh, no!

Girl:
Come to mama!

Yoshida:
What's this...? Hey, look.

Ogata:
Kazumi's pretty good at this game. However...
You've gotta keep your wits about you in this kind of fight.

Tanaka:
They're a strong team. But they don't seem to be using their heads much.

Shana:
Aha. Who's next?

Ogata:
Hirai's pretty awesome...

Tanaka:
Sato's running his legs off.

Ogata:
Let's make sure we stay far away from that team.

Tanaka:
You betcha!

Announcer:
Folks! There isn't that much time left! And there aren't that many couples left with headbands!

Yuji:
Hey, Yoshida. We're lucky to have made it this far, let's just wait for the time to run out.
We won't win, but I'm sure we'll get something for surviving.

Yoshida:
Yeah, sure. I'm just happy I was able to spend this much time alone with him. That's good enough for me.

Yuji:
Ah, Yoshida, is something wrong?

Yoshida:
Huh?! No! Everything's just perfect.

Announcer:
Look! The Hirai team's on the move!

Shana:
Yuji!

Yuji:
Oh, crap! We'd better make a run for it.

Yoshida:
Okay.

Shana:
Stop! Yuji!

Tanaka:
What are those guys doing?

Ogata:
Yeah.

Shana:
Why are you running!?

Yuji:
Why are you chasing us!? You've already won! Leave our headband alone!

Shana:
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! This is still part of the training!

Yuji:
You're talking crazy!

Shana:
I am not talking crazy!

Yoshida:
They seem comfortable with each other... Must be nice...

Yuji:
Yoshida! Bend down! She's right there!

Shana:
Look, pick up the pace, will ya!?

Sato:
That's easy for you to say...

Shana:
Yuji! Stop!

Yuji:
I'm not stopping!

Yoshida:
Is she angry because Sakai and I are spending so much time together? But why would she care?

Shana:
Faster! Faster!

Sato:
I'm about done.

Shana:
Stand still, Yuji!

Yoshida:
She's on our tail! Don't stop! Don't stop!

Shana:
Gotcha! You're mine.

Announcer:
And time's up! Looks like we got a surprise winner, folks! The Okada team!

Ogata:
Mr. Okada was in the contest?

Tanaka:
You know, should that count?

Yoshida:
I wonder... if that's his wife.

Yuji:
Hey, why did you have to come after us?

Shana:
Your fault.

Yuji:
My fault!? Why is that!?

Shana:
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

Yuji:
You know, Shana, you're always saying...

Margery:
Young man... Have a sip? Oh, yeah. You're too young to drink... Ah, sucks to be young!

Ike:
Who is this woman anyway? It's pretty late. I wonder how everyone's doing.

Tanaka:
We're sorry. But we couldn't help it. We didn't mean to leave you alone.

Margery:
Don't worry about it. What was I using for a pillow? My neck hurts.

Ike:
I'd say that was a pretty fun day all along. Well, tomorrow's Monday, I'll see at school.

Yuji:
Yeah. Take it easy.

Yoshida:
See you tomorrow!

Yuji:
So, why did you come after me?

Shana:
Shut up.

Yuji:
Why won't you tell me?

Shana:
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!


It's hard to tell others how you feel.
Shana goes into a battle alone, her ears ringing with the screams of Rinne.
In the meantime, more Denizens appear in the city.
Next episode: Entangled Feelings.
