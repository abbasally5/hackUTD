  A heartbeat that lasts for eternity, lives consumed in soundless balls of fire.
No one can tell when the world is displaced and the flames of the Crimson World sweep over all.


Sydonay:
You're the one I came to see.

Wirhelmina:
I must destroy it before they get it!

Yuji:
Shana!

Sydonay:
That she just protected the Mystes. How ridiculous.

Yuji:
Shana! Shana!

Shana:
Yuji... I didn't know... what else to do.. ? ...

Alastor:
Still no movement from the Palace of Stars.
Do not worry. She should be waking up any moment now.
As far as I can see, the girl has been struggling with emotions we could not have taught her about at the Palace of Heaven's Road.
It's been like this ever since she met that Mystes.
Emotions that she never knew she had... Feelings that she has no control over...

Wirhelmina:
How could she feel for a Mystes?

Alastor:
That's a silly question, Specialist of Everything.
We did not teach her this, but both of us know what the mind is like.
It is clear the girl does not truly understand what is happening to her.
Therefore, she gets irritated...


Wirhelmina:
That's indeed understandable.
That being said, the mission of a Flame Haze must not be unduly influenced by such emotions.
Especially, if they're taking on the mantle of the Flaming Haired Blazing Eyed one.

Alastor:
The girl understands that. And thus, the confusion.

Sato:
Here you go.

Tanaka:
You're feeling all right?

Yoshida:
I... I'm sorry.

Tanaka:
Damn it all. What do you think those Denizens have plan for Sakai, anyway?

Sato:
I'm pretty sure they want that Midnight Lost Child thing inside him.

Tanaka:
So does that mean they're gonna have to kill him to get that doowacky?

Yoshida:
Oh no!

Sato:
Don't worry. We'll save him first.

Tanaka:
What... you mean us, too?

Sato:
Who else is gonna do it?
That other Flame Haze and even Hirai were trying to kill him, remember?

Yoshida:
So what's this?

Tanaka:
Big Sister left the weapon behind.
She held it in just one hand but, we can't even lift the thing off the ground.

Sato:
Oh crap...

Yoshida:
It's just too different...

Tanaka:
Different? What's different?

Yoshida:
We're different from Yukari and the others. Sakai's like them.
Right up to when Sakai was taken away, Yukari fought to save him.
All I... could do was watch.

Tanaka:
Yoshida! If only Big Sister was here...

Sato:
Talking about it won't do any good. We're the only ones here now.

Tanaka:
Sure, but... Do you really think we can rescue him?
I hate to say it... but maybe we're just overreacting 'cause Big Sister abandoned us like that.

Yoshida:
All of this... This is Yukari and Sakai's world.
I can get closer... But I can't be with him.
It's so painful... I can't stand this! I can't do anything to help him!
Oh Sakai...

Sydonay:
Are you okay with this, Hecate?

Hecate:
I do not mind, if the Midnight Lost Child will fulfill my desires.

Bel-Peol:
Are you still worrying for no reason, Thousand Changes?
Hecate is gonna help us meet our need for power of existence to the end of time.

Sydonay:
It worries me when you talk about meeting our needs.
It means you're going to do something to my pure Hecate, aren't you?

Bel-Peol:
Nothing will change. In fact, her purity is a necessary quality for the Whole Sacred Chapel.
Well then, the preparations for the Midnight Lost Child should be in place by now.

Yuji:
Where... am I? What am I doing here?

Wirhelmina:
You look like you're awake.

Shana:
Yuji!

Alastor:
Calm down. Nothing has changed since they took him to the Palace of Stars.
Bal Masque has a use for the Midnight Lost Child. But I don't know what they're planning exactly.
I'm worried about what the Judge of Paradoxes said to me.

Wirhelmina:
Bel-Peol's words?

Alastor:
Hmm... That this place would become a fount of existence.

Shana:
A fount of existence...

Alastor:
The Treasure's defining trait is that it makes possible the complete recovery of power of existence. Therefore...

Wirhelmina:
Are they indeed going to use the Mystes to carry out this plan?

Alastor:
Very likely... However, the Midnight Lost Child is only able to recover what was lost during the preceding day.
Given the limited size of the Mystes in question, that doesn't amount to very much at all.

Wirhelmina:
Then it doesn't make sense to go to all this trouble.

Alastor:
Hmm... All the more reason to think, this is only part of a greater scheme.

Wirhelmina:
Indeed, midnight is not far off.

Shana:
Yuji...

Yuji:
What... am I doing here? I can't remember...
There's something I've forgotten...

Bel-Peol:
Begin, Hecate.



Hecate:
Midnight Lost Child.

Bel-Peol:
Hecate, the Midnight Lost Child is what you desire.
It is going to fulfill you.
Merely touch your bodies together.

Sydonay:
Touch bodies, huh? I don't like this very much.
Why does my Hecate have to physically touch the Mystes?

Bel-Peol:
But that's the very essence of her power. No one else can do what she does.

Yuji:
Who are you?

Hecate:
Supreme Throne, Hecate.

Yuji:
Hecate...

Hecate:
Please open your body... reveal yourself.

Yuji:
I'm... expanding... What's... happening? It feels... good.

Bel-Peol:
Oh good.

Hecate:
I can feel it. Infinite power... fulfilling me...

Bel-Peol:
The Treasure is about to get big surprise.
After merging with the Mystes, Hecate will take in vast amounts.
Her body knows no limits.

Sydonay:
You talk about her like she's some kind of monster.
She's a pure existence, who can never be fulfilled.
So she won't never be tainted.

Bel-Peol:
Anyway, that is why the Midnight Lost Child is going to produce unlimited amount of power of existence.
In addition, the Seeker's construct will continuously drain the power as it is replenished by the Treasure, ensuring the body will always be empty.
The Midnight Lost Child would be in operation perpetually.
The power of existence that has been tapped would begin to flow from the Palace of Stars and the needs of the land would be satisfied.
Like a fountain that flows... unendingly.

Wirhelmina:
No!

Shana:
Is that... power of existence?

Wirhelmina:
This is indeed a grave matter.

Tiamat:
Midnight Lost Child.

Alastor:
Likely produced by a device created by the Seeker.

Wirhelmina:
This will indeed cause a great amount of power of existence together in this city.
The balance of the entire world is in jeopardy.

Alastor:
I didn't expect things to progress this quickly.
We don't even have enough time to gather other hunters to our side.

Wirhelmina:
Indeed the only ones who can stop them are the few of us who are here now.

Tiamat:
Into the enemy's layer.

Wirhelmina:
Dealing with the Mystes is key.
Destroying it will indeed be our best most realistic plan to disrupt the operation they've put into motion here.
Indeed, as Flame Hazes, we cannot afford failure at this time.
But before that, we have to heal your wounds.

Shana:
Yuji...

Yuji:
Then what else am I supposed to do?
Shana, I have no idea what's going through your head.
I know... I'm a Mystes. And you're only a Flame Haze. Right?
I bet you're going to destroy me, aren't you?

Shana:
I wouldn't! I definitely wouldn't! But I couldn't say anything...

Alastor:
What do you want to do with Yuji Sakai?

Shana:
I don't...

Alastor:
Or rather... what do you want him to do?

Wirhelmina:
Indeed, I believe you.

Alastor:
Shana.

Shana:
Is that...? It's Bloodsucker. What is it doing here?

Tanaka:
Big Sister, Margery, left it behind.

Sato:
You're gonna go fight those Denizens, right?
We brought it over here to give to you.
Please! Use it to rescue Sakai!

Tanaka:
We're begging you!
We wanted to save him ourselves, but it's impossible!

Sato:
And this is the only thing we can come up with to help him.

Tanaka:
Hirai, you've gotta save his life! Please!

Sato:
We're not asking the Flame Haze to do this.
We're asking Yukari Hirai to save him.

Tanaka:
Please, Hirai!

Sato:
I beg you! We're gonna go to the Crystal Altar.

Tanaka:
Yeah, maybe we will be able to help you out from there.

Alastor:
Asking Yukari Hirai... This is the first time human beings had ever made that request.

Yoshida:
It looks like Sato and Tanaka and I all had the same thoughts.

Shana:
I don't wanna hear it.

Yoshida:
Truth is I don't wanna say it.
If I was you, Yukari, I could go rescue him. I can't stand this.
In the situation like this, you and Sakai are just closer to each other.

Shana:
We're closer to each other?

Yoshida:
But that gives me faith in you. So I believe in you, Yukari.
Because I believe the feeling of love is the same for everyone.
I believe in you because I think you really love Sakai!

Shana:
Because I...

Wirhelmina:
I've been looking for you.
If you don't get some rest, then your injuries will indeed take longer to heal.
Destroying the Mystes is a matter of the greatest urgency. Let's be off.

Yoshida:
Yukari, I'll be waiting. Come back with Sakai. I'll be waiting.

Wirhelmina:
Right.

Yoshida:
Oh, please... I'm sure you'll do it because I know you love him.

Shana:
Yuji... I can feel you.

Bel-Peol:
This entire city will become one solid mass of existence.
Has there ever been anyone who has gained such power?
Nay... I, Judge of Paradoxes, will become the first to control it.

Sydonay:
Hecate...

Yuji:
What... am I doing? I can't remember...
I'm sure I've forgotten something...

Hecate:
These are... the memories of the Mystes.

Yuji:
My... memories...?

Hecate:
Yes. Your memories... are flowing into me.

Yuji:
Right... That's right. They're mine.

Alastor:
Shana, decide for yourself what path you wish to take.

Shana:
Yeah...

Yuji:
I know her... That's...

Shana:
Yuji...

Yuji:
Shana!

Wirhelmina:
Well then, are you indeed ready?

Shana:
Yeah.

Wirhelmina:
Once we storm in there, there will indeed be no turning back.

Shana:
I know.

Wirhelmina:
And our objective?

Shana:
The only thing I'm certain of is that I have to go in there.

Wirhelmina:
I understand.
If we go, I'm sure the answer will become clear.
Because you... are a Flame Haze.

Shana:
Yeah.

Tiamat:
Enter.

Yuji:
Shana. She protected me. Even though I'm nothing but a Mystes. Why?

Hecate:
I'm becoming fulfilled.
With the Mystes, with the person, thoughts deep and strong...
I've never contacted something like this before.

Yuji:
Shana!

Shana:
Yuji! I can feel you!

Sydonay:
They're coming.

Bel-Peol:
Oh yes. I'm ready for them. But, will they even make it this far?

Yoshida:
Sakai... Yukari...

Tanaka:
Hirai...

Sato:
Come on...

Margery:
Why are there so many Denizens from Bal Masque hanging around here?
Do you think the Palace of Stars kicked them out?

Marcosias:
They say that rats are the first to flee a sinking ship.

Margery:
Huh, that thing's basically unsinkable/unthinkable.
Especially with that hag, Bel-Peol in charge.
But, there is something strange going on...

Marcosias:
These guys may be able to answer a few questions.

Margery:
Huh, then let's start asking, shall we?
First, I'll [xxx]. That'll help them to start talking.



Shana
and Wirhelmina enter the Palace of Stars, where they fall into the trap Bal Masque set for them.
The final battle, from which there's no turning back, is about to begin.
