  A heartbeat that lasts for eternity, lives consumed in soundless balls of fire.
No one can tell when the world is displaced and the flames of the Crimson World sweep over all.


Mr. Kondo:
Right! The last 15 minutes will be free time!

Students:
Oh! Yeah! ... Cannonball!

Mr.Kondo:
Hey! Can not do the dangerous stunts!

Students:
All right!

Ogata:
You look a little lost so that your buddy's here. What happened? Did you guys fight?

Tanaka:
No, that isn't it.

Ogata:
Ah, so I guess Sato really is sick today.

Tanaka:
Yeah, he is. But hey, Oga-chan, are you worried because he didn't show up today?

Ogata:
Oh, idiot...

Yuji:
Do you... have feelings for Yoshida?

Ike:
Do I?

Yoshida:
I'm gonna make sure I tell him my feelings.

Shana:
No, Yuji is mine.

Yoshida:
I'm going to tell him... Tell him properly.

Ike:
I said do you think that's right.
If you keep playing games like this, you're gonna end up hurting someone!

Yoshida:
It's all right. I can say it. As long as I get the opportunity.

Shana:
I won't lose... I'll never lose to her!

Khamsin:
Hm...

Sydonay:
The Palace of the Stars is practically empty. What are you up to?

Bel-Peol:
We're planning on using the Palace as a vessel, for the Treasure of Treasures, the Midnight Lost Child, and for Hecate's sake.

Sydonay:
Are you okay with that, Hecate?

Hecate:
If Bel-Peol wishes, then so be it.

Sydonay:
Ah, she's withdrawn again.

Bel-Peol:
Mysterious yes. But she thinks answers will come to her when she does it.

Sydonay:
My Hecate is all about purity. I just love that about her.
This latest plan. It isn't going to harm her, is it?

Bel-Peol:
No. In fact, it should make her an existence for all eternity.
Even as we speak, someone perfect for the job is setting in our lot.
Although I still have some unanswered questions about him.

Yuji:
So why am I training alone? What's Shana doing anyway?

Alastor:
She did not see fit to tell me.

Yuji:
Yeah, but this is the first time this is ever happened, as far as I can remember.
Do you think something important has come up?

Alastor:
Stop talking unnecessarily! Pick up your pace.

Yuji:
Yeah, yeah.

Chigusa:
There, you're all set. But seriously you've never done any cooking before?

Shana:
None. Wilhelmina told me that kind of training wasn't needed.

Chigusa:
Miss Wilhelmina is the person used to live with Mr. Arasu Toru, right?
Preparing a box lunch might be difficult if you don't have any experience at all.
Does it have to be a box lunch?

Shana:
Mm.

Chigusa:
Did Yu-chan ask you to make him this?

Shana:
It's just... I didn't feel good. Watching Yuji... eat the box lunch Kazumi Yoshida made for him.

Chigusa:
Kazumi Yoshida?

Shana:
She can cook.

Chigusa:
Well, let's start with something simple like a basic omelet.

Shana:
Sure.

Alastor:
Don't stop. Keep running.

Yuji:
Just hang on a second. Let me catch my breath, okay?

Alastor:
You disappoint me. All right, just for a moment.

Yuji:
Yeah, yeah.

Alastor:
A single yes will do.

Yuji:
Right! The Misago Festival. It's tomorrow.

Alastor:
What are you referring to?

Yuji:
Ah, look, it's an annual festival. It's a pretty big one.
I used to go to it all the time with my mom and dad.
Candy apples... my favorite.

Alastor:
Hm?

Yuji:
A snack, they sell them in the night stalls. I know. I should come with Shana tomorrow.
But I guess she's not too interested in festivals...

Alastor:
Of course she isn't. Resume your training.

Yuji:
Yeah, yeah.

Alastor:
A single yes will do.

Yoshida:
Oh, it's okay. Don't be scared. It's just a decoration for the festival.
The Misago Festival... It's that time here already.
I know. I'll ask Sakai to the festival. And that's where I tell him how I feel.
Let's go home, Ekaterina. I've gotta get ready for school.

Chigusa:
I think it's my fault for not watching you make it. It is you first time after all.

Shana:
It's not your fault. It's because I haven't trained enough.

Chigusa:
Calling this training seems like a bit of an exaggeration.
The important thing about cooking is that you do it out of love.

Shana:
Out of love?

Yuji:
Jeez, what would I start with? It all looks good.

Chigusa:
Shana-chan. We'll take our time and learn the basics properly.
Hey, you know what? The Misago Festival is tomorrow. You should go to it with Yu-chan.

Shana:
Festival? One of those noisy celebrations?

Chigusa:
There are lot of fun. Listen, come here right after school. I'll get you a yukata.
But don't tell him you're wearing one. Yu-chan will be dazzled when he sees so pretty you're looking in your yukata.

Shana:
You think so?

Yuji:
I'm home. 
Sniff. Sniff.
That's weird. I smell something burned.

Chigusa:
Really?

Shana:
Yuji, did you finish your training?

Yuji:
I sure it is. So, why didn't you come out today, Shana?

Shana:
No reason.

Yuji:
Ah, you know what, go ahead, Shana. I have to go and buy something.
Yoshida's really nice. But I shouldn't be eating her box lunches.

Shopwoman:
Thank you, come again!

Yuji:
Yoshida...

Yoshida:
Just say it. If I don't find the courage to say it now, I'll never be able to... and I'll regret it forever...

Yuji:
I was just a...

Yoshida:
Sakai!

Yuji:
Yes?

Yoshida:
Tomorrow, it's the Misago Festival. Do you wanna go to it with me?

Yuji:
Yoshida...



Students:
So you're going to the festival tomorrow? Supposed to be pretty cool this year.
They even got a blimp and stuff.

Yeah , but it won't be much fun just us two. 
Hey, let's ask some girls to go.

Yoshida:
Hey, good morning, Ike.

Ike:
Hi.

Yoshida:
I wanna... apologize for the other day.
I know you only said those things because you wanted to help me.

Ike:
You know, I should learn to keep my mouth shut.

Yoshida:
I decided to do what I could to change things on my own.

Yuji:
In fact, Yoshida wanted to invite me to the Misago Festival tomorrow.

Ike:
So you're going?

Yuji:
Ah, yeah.

Ike:
I see.

Yuji:
But I do understand what you said to me before, Ike.

Ike:
I think I'd be angrier if you turned it down just because you thought I should have a chance with her.
The truth is I'm still not sure whether I have feelings for her. When I know for sure, then I'll fight for her.

Yuji:
Right.

Girl:
You're right! It'll be more fun as a group.

Ogata:
Oh, for sure. Tanaka! You want me to catch you in? It's the Misago Festival Tour!

Tanaka:
Ah, sorry, no. I've kinda got other plans.

Ogata:
That's okay. I was only joking. I didn't really mean it.

Shana:
Until now, festivals never meant anything to me.

Chigusa:
Yu-chan will be dazzled when he sees so pretty you're looking in your yukata.

Shana:
It sounds like this could be fun.

Marcosias:
Hi! How are you feeling, Boss?

Margery:
I'm gonna rest in here for a while.

Sato:
What happened? Were you kicked out of the bar again?
You don't have to sleep in there, you know.
Go ahead and use one of other rooms, there's nobody here.

Marcosias:
If we get too attached to this place, it'll make things more difficult when we leave.

Margery:
Besides, your maid keeps this place too clean for me.

Sato:
If there's one thing my parents insist on, it's making sure the house is clean.

Marcosias:
But thanks to them, we've got a place we're gonna always stay at.
You don't know how we appreciate that. Ha ha ha ...

Sato:
Yeah, I guess. That's a load off my mind.

Margery:
Huh? You're still a child. You just want someone to take care of you, right?
Ha ha ha ... What were you expecting?

Marcosias:
Leave him alone. You're giving him a fever!

Margery:
Oh, come on. Look at him, he's already getting better.
Well, I'm gonna go taking a nap. Ah! Get you later.

Yoshida:
I actually invited him. I should be able to tell him tomorrow.

Shopwoman:
Thanks for coming.

Khamsin:
So, tell me. Do you know about it?

Yoshida:
What?

Khamsin:
I picked up a strong sense indicating that.

Behemoth:
Hmm, perhaps it's coming from someone who's close to the girl, someone who's trying to hide him or herself.

Khamsin:
Yeah, I think you're right.

Yoshida:
What was that?

Khamsin:
Oh, I guess it's time for introductions.
I am Mobilizer of Ceremonial Equipment, Khamsin. And this is...

Behemoth:
I am Behemoth, the Steadfast Sharp Peak.

Khamsin:
We're here to ask you for your cooperation. We think you'll be perfect for the important job we have.
There's no danger. We're here to fix the distortion within your city.
No, please don't be frightened. Look through this, and you understand.
See how the world really is.

Yoshida:
This world...?

Khamsin:
Here. 
Look.

Margery:
Marcosias.

Marcosias:
Yeah, they're here all right. Although they don't seem to be doing anything. Just observing.

Margery:
You're right.

Tanaka:
You mean with Big Sister!?

Sato:
If Margery, Marco decide to leave the city, then I'm gonna join them.

Tanaka:
Then I'll go, too! We should start training for it.

Yoshida:
Torches... They replace dead people who were eaten by monsters...? In this city...
What about my family? What will I do if they're... Is my family okay?

Khamsin:
Please rest assured. Your family is quite unharmed.
It's one of the conditions to having you cooperate with us.

Yoshida:
They're safe...? My father, my mother and my little brother Ken?
Hang on... What about... what about Sakai?

Shana:
Tonight, we'll work on controlling power of existence.

Yuji:
Uh-huh. 
Hey, Shana. Since tomorrow's Saturday, our training's in the afternoon, right?

Shana:
Tomorrow evening's okay.

Yuji:
Ah, really?

Shana:
I said so, didn't I? Let's get started.

Yuji:
That'll work. I can train when I get back from the festival.

Shana:
Yuji, focus! I want you to try to control the amount of power of existence you send to me.
This time, gather and release it in a kind of explosion. But make sure to keep enough for your own existence.
Yuji! All you did was increase the amount you sent to me. You have to cause to lead the explosion.
You don't have a lot of power of existence to play around with. But release it all at once, and it can make a difference.

Yuji:
I'm having trouble judging how much to leave behind.
I'm not sure what the safe amount is for my own existence.

Alastor:
Come midnight, the Midnight Lost Child within you will fully recharge your power of existence.
So don't be afraid to use it up.

Yuji:
I know, but...

Margery:
Every single night, you're out here practicing.

Marcosias:
Sorry to bother you in such a romantic evening.

Yuji:
Good evening.

Shana:
Is this about that stranger I sensed?

Margery:
Yes. Quite a significant one.

Marcosias:
Seems to be a Flame Haze who's really starting to piss me off.

Yuji:
Huh? Is this true? You never told me about...

Shana:
I didn't say anything because I sensed the visitor wasn't here to fight.

Margery:
Well, it is possible we have a Flame Haze who just happens to be passing through, except for the fact we've got this crazy item here.
So we should be very cautious. You wouldn't believe how happy that bastard was when he found it.

Sydonay:
Are you carrying...? That's why... I understand.

Margery:
I don't know if you've heard the latest, but apparently Sydonay is once again a member of the Bal Masque.

Alastor:
Is this confirmed?

Yuji:
Bal... what?

Shana:
The Bal Masque, a Denizen group.

Alastor:
Its core's comprised of three powerful Denizens known as the Trinity.
Hecate, Bel-Peol and one who was away for some time, Sydonay.

Marcosias:
If they decide to make their presence known, it could be trouble for all of us.

Alastor:
It may be time to plan on what direction we wish to go from this point on.
Do you understand what I'm saying, Yuji Sakai?

Yuji:
Ah, direction?

Alastor:
I'm talking about leaving this city.

Shana:
There's a good chance the Bal Masque will come to this city. In an attempt to acquire you, Yuji.

Yuji:
You're right. Everyone's in danger if I stay here.

Khamsin:
Yes, I apologize for exposing you to the world's reality so suddenly.
However, if you're going to cooperate with us, I had to make sure you understood the truth and irregularities of this world.
Like you saw earlier, there are many Torches in this city.
It's badly warped. Restoring the order of things and repairing such warps is our job.

Behemoth:
Hum. In fact, he's known as a "Tuner".

Khamsin:
In order to tune the location, it'll require the cooperation of a human being who was born and raised...

Yoshida:
What about Sakai...? Oh, Sakai...!

Shana:
We won't leave yet. Reckless moves are dangerous.

Yuji:
Leave this city... together... with Shana...

Professor:
Hee-hee... Everything seems to be falling into the place as expected.

Sydonay:
Oh, that voice, it is him.

Wilhelmina:
The Bal Masque... I'm sensing strange movements of the Palace of Stars.

Tiamat:
The Midnight Lost Child.

Wilhelmina:
As soon as we're done here, we'll look into it.



The Professor is going to conduct an experiment at the Misago Festival.
In a confusion, the girls' hearts reflect their personal delusions.
Shana's face shows an emotion she's never known before...
