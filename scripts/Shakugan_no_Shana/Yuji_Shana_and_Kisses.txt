  A heartbeat that lasts for eternity, lives consumed in soundless balls of fire.
No one can tell when the world is displaced and the flames of the Crimson World sweep over all.


Shana:
All right, Yuji. Send your strength, little by a little.

Yuji:
Okay.

Shana:
Here I go.

Alastor:
Hmm... It looks like it's getting easier for you to form your wings.

Shana:
Seems that way.

Yuji:
Shana, it's almost time.

Shana:
Is it? Well, I guess that's enough for today.

Yuji:
Twelve o'clock... Midnight Lost Child...
I'm glad all my energy comes back. But I still feel strange.

Shana:
Better get used to it.

Yuji:
Yeah, I guess. You know what? I think I'm a little hungry.

Shana:
Huh?

Yuji:
Wanna come inside for a snack?

Shana:
What the heck is this?

Yuji:
I think it's a rerun of a drama.

Shana:
Drama? You mean it's not even real?

Yuji:
Yeah. Should I turn it off? Say the word.

Shana:
It doesn't really matter to me.

Actor:
Rie!

Yuji:
That must have hurt.

Shana:
So, why did she hit him anyway?

Yuji:
Well, I guess his kiss took her by surprise. Pretty natural reaction.

Shana:
Humph, just because of that.

Yuji:
Yes, because...

Shana:
You don't find it strange?

Sorath:
Tiriel... Everyone's looking at us... They're starting to scare me...

Tiriel:
Calm yourself, there's nothing to fear.

Sydonay:
It's your behavior as well as your outfits that are attracting all the attention.

Tiriel:
Why? There's nothing shameful about a pair of magnificent flowers in bloom, Sydonay.
Don't forget. It's my Cradle Garden that is protecting you. I don't appreciate your flippant comment.

Sorath:
Oh, o, oh, Tiriel, can I eat them up?

Tiriel:
Yes, of course you can do, Brother. But you have to wait until after I'm finished.

Sydonay:
So, what method is that?

Tiriel:
We're getting very close to what my brother's looking for. I'm getting something ready.
It would be a shame if we found it only to have someone else walk away with it, don't you think?

Sorath:
You're gonna trap it, so no one will be able to take it away... inside our Cradle!

Tiriel:
There we go. Help yourself to as many as you like, Dear Brother, except for this one.

Sorath:
Mm! It's time to eat!

Tiriel:
Tell me. Have you ever heard of something called an "orgel"?

Sydonay:
An orgel you say... that's some kind of music box.

Tiriel:
That's right. I believe that's the common name.
But I prefer the term "orgel,” because it just sounds so much more elegant.

Sydonay:
You're going to use that Treasure and the Unrestricted Method to create the enclosure.

Tiriel:
It has such a beautiful tone.

Yuji:
Man, dodge ball at our age?

Yoshida:
Are you all right, Sakai?

Yuji:
Uh, yeah, I'm just fine.

Tanaka:
Oh yeah!

Student:
Hey, are you okay?

Ogata:
Tanaka!

Ike:
It's coming down in buckets out there. But I'm glad the game was canceled.
The way things were going, someone might have gotten hurt. Really, hurt.

Tanaka:
Big Sister...

Ogata:
Big Sister? Who is that?

Ike:
He was really knocked for a loop.
Listen, Sakai. I wanna ask you about Hirai.

Yuji:
Okay. What do you wanna know?

Ike:
Well, you guys come to school together pretty often. Let's see, is there... anything between you two?

Yuji:
No. No, there's nothing going on.

Ike:
Are you sure about that at all?

Girls:
They say "just one kiss,” but I it's not something you wanna give away like it's not important.

I totally know you mean. If you let them kiss you, before you know it, they go too far.

What?! No! That's not what I meant! It's like, well, a kiss is precious.

Huh? Oh, that's you meant.

It's hard to know what to do.

It sure is!

Shana:
Huh?
A kiss... Yuji had a strange reaction when we talked about that yesterday.
Everything I've read here makes it sound straight forward. But still...

Yuji:
Ah, here you are. So, you doing some research?

Shana:
Yeah. Sorta...

Yuji:
And what?

Shana:
Stop! You know, nothing that important.

Ike:
Don't look so worried, Yoshida. It's not what you think it is.

Yoshida:
It isn’t?

Ike:
It's like what I was telling you before.
Hirai and Sakai are just good friends, they're not in love with each other.
So hang in there.

Yoshida:
Okay.

Tanaka:
Big Sister, we're home!

Sato:
So, how are you feeling today?

Margery:
Ah... would you two be quiet? It feels like my head is splitting wide open.

Marcosias:
Yo, Eita! What's with the war wound on your chin?

Tanaka:
This? Uh, I took a ball in the face today.

Margery:
Keisaku, Eita. I think I'm growing tired of booze.

TV:
You mean!.

What do you mean?

What? Why me!? What do you mean "why me"?

What do you mean by "what do you mean"?

Shana:
I’ve been wondering... What is the real meaning of a kiss?

Chigusa:
Oh, why do you wanna know something like that?

Shana:
Ah, just because...

Chigusa:
A simple question, but it's a difficult one to answer. You said you did some research?

Shana:
I looked through a bunch of library books. But I didn't find anything that I don't already know.
I'm aware of what's involved, and I've seen people kissing, but it's like...

Chigusa:
Like what?

Shana:
I get the feeling that the meaning I attached to a kiss and the meaning that everyone else says are two different things.
I thought maybe you could tell me what a kiss is really about.

Chigusa:
Have you read novels or magazines about it?

Shana:
Oh, yes, I have. But Alastor said those things were almost useless.
Because anything written down has a personal opinion in it and it won't be very analytical or logical.

Chigusa:
"Arasu Toru" is your guardian, right? He's the one who lives a long way away. He sounds very insightful.

Shana:
Oh, he is...

Chigusa:
However... It's not quite so simple.


Chigusa:
However, Shana-chan. Something like this, it's natural for you to have questions about it. I guess so.
There's no doubt that if you want accurate information and theories, books are the best things to start with.
But what you're looking for has very a little to do with cold facts and figures.
In other words, this is something with no right answer. It has to do with the heart and emotions.

Shana:
A heart and emotions?

Chigusa:
You do understand that physical contact between two people is usually a sign of affection, right?

Shana:
Yeah. That's what a kiss is. Kinda like when people shake hands or hug each other, everyone does it.

Chigusa:
Hmm... Well, that's true, but let's take Arasu Toru. You wouldn't mind giving him a little kiss, right?

Shana:
Mm-hm.

Chigusa:
Would you give Yu-chan a kiss?

Shana:
B-But he's...

Chigusa:
When you think about it like that, it's uncomfortable, isn't it?

Shana:
Y-Yeah.

Chigusa:
That's the essence of what I'm trying to say.
And remember that a harmless peck on the cheek is a completely different thing from two people kissing each other on their lips.

Shana:
Hm? A kiss on our lips!? From Yuji!? No, I don't ever wanna do that!

Chigusa:
That's quite all right.

Shana:
Chigusa...

Chigusa:
No one says you have to. In fact, it's probably not something you should be doing with Arasu Toru, either.
Shana-chan, this is how I feel about a kiss. You see, if it's on their lips, then it's like a personal oath.

Shana:
An oath?

Chigusa:
Yes. It means the two of you want to be closer, that you're willing to let the other person take care of you.

Shana:
So that's it.

That's enough for tonight.

Yuji:
I am a little tired. Shana, I've been wondering.

Shana:
About what?

Yuji:
My energy makes a complete recovery every night, because of the Midnight Lost Child Treasure.

Shana:
Yeah, so?

Yuji:
Well, does that mean I'm going to live forever?

Shana:
That's something you have to find out for yourself.
It'll be a while before you know for certain.

Yuji:
I see...

Shana:
What is it?

Yuji:
I was wondering if this means that now we're always going to be together.

Alastor:
Shana.

Shana:
What?

Alastor:
I have a favor to ask of you, of both of you.

Yuji:
So is this okay, Alastor?

Shana:
Chigusa, can I use your phone?

Chigusa:
Go ahead. But Shana-chan, it's almost time for school.

Shana:
Right. Hello?

Alastor:
Hmm... All right, let's begin.

Shana:
Chigusa.

Chigusa:
For me? Hello, you wanted to talk to me?

Alastor:
Ah, hello.

Chigusa:
Yes.

Alastor:
Madam, it is a great pleasure to finally be able to speak with you. My name is Alastor.

Chigusa:
Ah, so this is the famous Mr. Arasu Toru. Yukari's told me all about you. She speaks very highly of you.
I'm Yuji's mother, but you can call me Chigusa, everyone does.

Alastor:
I want to take this opportunity to thank you for looking out for her.

Chigusa:
Oh, no. I haven't done that much. Please don't think I'm being too forward.
But may I ask why you wanted to speak to me? I'm sure this has something to do with Yukari Hirai.

Alastor:
Indeed, it does. Umm... and please feel free to call her Shana.
That's the name I use when I'm addressing her.

Chigusa:
Ah, so it's a personal nickname that you gave her.

Alastor:
Hm, well, something like that. About the reason for my telephone call...

Chigusa:
Yes?

Alastor:
It has to do with what happened yesterday.

Yuji:
Yesterday?

Chigusa:
Could you hold on a moment, please? Yu-chan! Shana-chan! You're going to be late for school!

Yuji, Shana:
We're going now.

Chigusa:
Go. I'll see you later, okay? Hurry up! Get going! I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

Alastor:
I am not disputing your knowledge when it comes to relationships.
However, I must ask that you refrain from conversations of that nature.

Chigusa:
Oh, I see. Then she must've talked to you about it.

Alastor:
No, more like I teased it out her.

Chigusa:
Well, what really matters is that Shana was still willing to talk to you about something like that.
It shows how much she trusts you and respects your opinion.

Alastor:
Hmm...

Chigusa:
It's clear you care for her, and you've done a wonderful job raising her.
She's a lovely young girl with a good heart.

Alastor:
That's she is. And that's precisely why I must ask you to desist from any further discussions that can stimulate improper thoughts concerning your son, Yuji.

Chigusa:
Hm…, yes, I understand your concern.

Alastor:
You’re an astute woman, madam. I'm sure you can imagine exactly what I'm worried about here.

Chigusa:
Yes, but...

Alstor:
Hm?

Chigusa:
For Shana-chan's sake, may I have permission to talk to her about this subject sometime in the future?

Alastor:
Ah.., okay...

Chigusa:
With your guidance, she's become a proud, strong and good-hearted young woman.
But let's not kid ourselves. She's still very young and she's insecure about some things.

Alastor:
Hmm... Please continue.

Chigusa:
Well, forgive me, but I have to be frank. I don't think she understands feelings very well.
And she's extremely vulnerable when it comes to matters of the heart.
Imagine a young man, someone aggressive, or even my own son, Yuji, she's just so naïve. I don't think she could resist. Yesterday, she said some things that worried me.
That's why I had to talk with her.

Alastor:
Don't you think it's still too early for these kinds of talks?
I'd always plan to gradually introduce these things over a number of years in response to new and interesting experiences in her life.

Chigusa:
Problems don't arise when we'd like them to [now], do they?

Alastor:
Indeed, they do not.

Chigusa:
Therefore, there are some things that children are never too young to learn.
Especially that's something that they have to know. It's for her own sake.
Besides, girls can be quite precocious. They're more mature than they appear.

Alastor:
Madam.

Chigusa:
Yes?

Alastor:
Please allow me to retract my earlier remarks. They were ill-informed.

Chigusa:
Well, I hope you'll forgive me for having been so direct. But I wouldn't worry about Shana-chan.
With the proper care and guidance, she'll be ready for whatever happens.
She can find the right answers in her own way. And you trust her in that regard, don't you?

Alastor:
Of course, I do.

Tiriel:
Oh, Brother...

Sorath:
Huh? It's close. Really close.

Tiriel:
What is it, Sydonay? You seem to be looking for something as well. Could that be...?

Sydonay:
I'm always amazed that how Sorath can smell things that he wants.
This unpleasant sensation means there's a Flame Haze nearby.

Sorath:
Huh? What? Where's the Flame Haze? Where's it? Where's it? I want it real bad!

Sydonay:
And it's not alone.

Tiriel:
Huh?

Sydonay:
It's going to detect us any second now.

Tiriel:
It's nothing to worry about. We knew it was only a matter of time before we eventually ran across a Flame Haze.

Sydonay:
Fine, then, what do we do now?

Tiriel:
I wanted more time to prepare some welcoming traps, but I think we'll be fine.
So, should we get this underway, Dear Brother?
But first, I think it's only polite that we go and pay them a social call.
'Cause after all, it won't be hard to find them...

Yuji:
I wonder what happened yesterday.
Yeah, remember when Alastor was on the phone, he said something happened yesterday.

Shana:
I don't know.

Yuji:
Huh?
Uh, what is it, Shana?

Shana:
I promised that I'd be never ever going to do it with you.

Ike:
Hey, care for a little company?

Yoshida:
Here you go, Sakai. I made you a lunch if you want something different.

Yuji:
That's for me?

Yoshida:
Yeah. Because all you ever eat for lunch are rice balls. That's why...

Yuji:
Ah, sure. I appreciate it.
Thanks for lunch.
Oh, man. What would I start with? It all looks good.
I, uh...

Tanaka:
Yeah, you sure (are) buying (a) lot of stuff.

Sato:
That's an understatement...

Margery:
What are you talking about? I'm just getting started.

Marcosias:
This isn't the best time to run into such heavy visitors.

Sato:
Who are those guys?

Tanaka:
Big Sister?

Sydonay:
It's been a long time since I last saw you, Beautiful Slaughterer.

Margery:
What’re you doing here, you little sheep Casanova?

Tiriel:
Oh, you know her?

Sydonay:
Indeed. Let me introduce her to you, Tiriel.
The Flame Haze, Margery Daw, the Chanter of Elegies.
As far as killers go, I'd say she's probably the best.

Tiriel:
Well, the Claws and Fangs of Violation.

Sorath:
But I don't care who they are. All I know is that they don't have what I'm looking for.

Tiriel:
Oh, I thought maybe we've gotten lucky, but I guess this’s just a random encounter.

Sorath:
So let's get outta here.

Tiriel:
If you insist, Dear Brother.

Tanaka:
Those three are Denizens!

Sato:
Should we really be letting them go?

Marcosias:
We didn't let them go. They let us go.

Margery:
Shut up, Stupid Marco...

Yuji:
So, um…, what did you talk to my mother about?

Alastor:
Nothing that you need to be concerned with.

Yuji:
C'mon!

Alastor:
You need to focus on your training more. You don't want to embarrass your mother now, do you?

Yuji:
Uh, no.

Chigusa:
Yu-chan. Shana-chan. Come in, dinner's ready.

Shana:
Okay.

Yuji:
Yeah, okay, Mom. Whoa?!

Shana:
I'll never do it with you.

Yuji:
Huh?

Sorath:
Hmm... I wonder where it could be... Nietono no Shana...


The girl who has feelings for Yuji declares war--a challenge that Shana accepts.
That's when Tiriel makes her move, and Engulfed in Love for Others springs her trap.
