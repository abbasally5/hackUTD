  A heartbeat that lasts for eternity, lives consumed in soundless balls of fire.
No one can tell when the world is displaced and the flames of the Crimson World sweep over all.


Yuji:
The battle was over. In the aftermath, questions remained.
What had the Denizen known as the Professor really been trying to accomplish?
And then, there was another matter.

Yoshida:
Sakai... You're so warm... No, Sakai. You're human.

Yuji:
Even after she found out what I was... Yoshida was real for her true feelings for me.
And then, there was Shana.

Wirhelmina:
What seems to be bothering you?

Shana:
Wirhelmina...

Wirhelmina:
It doesn't really look like you've been living in this apartment.

Shana:
Yeah. You're right.

Tiamat:
Cleanup required.

Shana:
Umm... Wirhelmina, how long do you intend to stay here?

Tiamat:
Duration undetermined.

Wirhelmina:
Until I've done what I came to do indeed.

Alastor:
Which is...

Wirhelmina:
Indeed, there is a Mystes in the city. And it contains the Midnight Lost Child.

Yuji:
It's hard to believe... So much has happened.
And all of it just last night. Hey, Yoshida!

Yoshida:
Hi there, Sakai. How's it going?

Yuji:
About yesterday, I'm really sorry.
We've got you involved in a bunch of stuff.

Yoshida:
You don't have to apologize, Sakai. Actually, I'm happy about it.
Because of what happened, you and I got a little closer.
It helped... me tell you how I really feel.

Yuji:
Umm... well, that's... that's nice. Thank you, Yoshida.

Yoshida:
It's... it's all right. It's just that...

Yuji:
I'm glad Yoshida told me how she feels. I feel pretty good about it.
But the only thing keeping me alive right now, is the Midnight Lost Child.

Yoshida:
Sakai. Is there something wrong?

Yuji:
No. Nothing's wrong.

Wirhelmina:
So this is the house where the Mystes with the Midnight Lost Child currently resides?

Tiamat:
Concealed.

Shana:
Yeah. Ah, Wirhelmina. We should go back.
Because there's still some cleaning to do and...
Ah, besides I... wanna talk about some stuff.

Wirhelmina:
This morning and now this, uncharacteristic behavior for a Flame Haze, indeed.

Chigusa:
Ah, Shana-chan!

Wirhelmina:
Shana?

Chigusa:
So you're not spending time with Yu-chan today?
He said he was stepping out for a minute. And then he just ran off somewhere.

Shana:
He's not here...

Chigusa:
And who is... your friend here?

Shana:
Well, this is...

Chigusa:
My, my! So you're the Miss Carmel I've heard so much about her.
I should have introduced myself properly.

Wirhelmina:
It doesn't matter. Thank you for taking care of her.

Chigusa:
I'm glad we could meet. Shana-chan's told me so much about you.
I understand you are the one who looked after her when she was young.
Isn't that right, Shana-chan?

Shana:
Oh, yeah.

Wirhelmina:
Please, madam.

Chigusa:
Madam sounds so formal. What is it?

Wirhelmina:
You keep addressing her by that name, but I'd indeed like you to stop calling her that.

Shana:
Wirhelmina!

Chigusa:
I see, please excuse me then.
Mr. Arasu Toru told me that she preferred to be called that, so naturally, I assumed you also like to call her that, Miss Carmel.

Wirhelmina:
Things are indeed starting to become clear.
The Flaming-Haired Blazing-Eyed Hunter has become rusty because of this woman.

Chigusa:
So where are you staying, Miss Carmel? At Yukari's place?

Wirhelmina:
Yes, madam. I plan on taking up residence in your city for some time, indeed.
I hope you understand if while I'm here, naturally I will be taking care of her.
Indeed, I'm not letting this woman influence her any longer.

Chigusa:
Well, that's wonderful! I'd like to think we've been able to provide Yukari with support and comfort, so she won't feel so lonely on her own.
Nevertheless, nothing can take the place of family now, can it? That's the most important thing...

Wirhelmina:
Family...

Shana:
Family...

Wirhelmina:
Excuse me, I'm not related to her by blood.
I merely helped to raise her. Nothing more, indeed.

Chigusa:
Oh, you don't say. Yukari-chan, is that nothing to you?
Whether or not you're related by blood is a fairly minor detail, to a family that lives together.

Wirhelmina:
This woman is indeed detestable.

Tanaka:
Be careful.

Sato:
I know.

Tanaka:
35 centimeters! A new record! Okay, my turn.

Sato:
We are gonna lift this thing... no matter what.

Tanaka:
Yeah. Unless we accomplish this, we're not gonna be any help when it counts.

Marcosisas:
Huh! They're really going for it. Probably because of all the attention that Mystes boy's getting.

Yuji:
Is that... from him?

Yoshida:
Yes. But just after Khamsin gave it to me, he said something that gave me the creeps.

Khamsin:
That reminds me for helping with the tuning, I have an amulet for you.

Yoshida:
Can I really have this?

Khamsin:
A token of our appreciation. By the way, I must warn you two about something.
We're still not sure what the Professor was after.
But we hear there is a lot of significant movement out there concerning the Midnight Lost Child.

Yuji:
The one inside me?

Khamsin:
It would be wise to exercise caution.

Yuji:
Movement he said... right?

Yoshida:
Sakai... You and Yukari have been fighting this battle by yourselves for a while now.
I had no idea about this.

Yuji:
Well, you're not the only one.
The vast majority of people live their lives without knowing any of this.
And if possible, they're better off that way.

Yoshida:
Sakai...

Yuji:
I've never given it much thought before. But I really love this city.
It's the place where my mom, Yoshida and all my friends live.
There are the reasons I wanna protect it so desperately.
I never want my city or the people who live in it to get involved in the kind of mess we had yesterday.
Ah, what's the matter?

Yoshida:
I'm sorry but... For a second there, I had the feeling you're about to go very far away soon.

Yuji:
What is this?

Yoshida:
It's for the traditional Bonfire.

Yuji:
That's right. They have a big fire every year.
I thought that it was all of it had been transformed into Rinnes.

Yoshida:
Sakai? Is there something wrong there?

Yuji:
Ah, sorry. It's nothing. Let's go.
It's... probably nothing to worry about...
But I should check with Shana, just in case.
Find out if that thing's safe...



Wirhelmina:
I never imagined that you would've been staying in the same house where the Midnight Lost Child is.

Tiamat:
Unforeseen.

Wirhelmina:
And you were with her, Flame of the Heavens. What were you thinking?

Alastor:
Hmm...

Wirhelmina:
So what exactly do you mean when you say "hmm..."?

Tiamat:
Duty's neglected.

Alastor:
Ahem.

Shana:
I don't think there's any trouble with us staying here. Yuji's been...
What I mean to say is the Mystes has been helpful in our battles.

Alastor:
Although he's still inexperienced and lacks determination in times.

Shana:
Please tell me, Wirhelmina. What exactly are you planning on doing with the Mystes?

Wirhelmina:
I... heard the Thousand Changes was here.

Shana:
Yes, Sydonay...

Alastor:
You are worried about the Bal Masque?

Wirhelmina:
Yes, indeed. [For these day(s),] who are making threatening moves against the Midnight Lost Child.

Yuji:
I'm home. Mom, Shana's here, isn't she?
Hey, Shana, there's something I wanna talk to you about.
What ... !? ...

Chigusa:
Yu-chan, introduce yourself, please.
This is Wirhelmina Carmel, the person who raised Yukari-chan from when she was just a child.

Yuji:
Who... raised her?

Yoshida:
Ekaterina! Don't run in the people's yard!

Wirhelmina:
So this is indeed what it's all about.

Yuji:
Shana?

Chigusa:
Shana-chan!

Wirhelmina:
If you excuse me, madam, I'll handle things from this point on.

Chigusa:
But, .. sure.

Wirhelmina:
We must sever all sources of destruction.

Tanaka:
So, our personal best is 48 centimeters.

Sato:
A long way to go before we can swing it around, but it's definitely an improvement.
Let's get something to eat.

Tanaka:
Yeah... Big Sister, what would you like for dinner?
We're thinking we'd like something to boost our energy level.
That's strange. Is she sleeping again?

Sato:
Margery? Margery!

Tanaka:
Big Sister!

Sato:
Margery?

Tanaka:
Big Sister!

Sato:
Margery!

Tanaka:
Hello? Come in, Big Sister!
Would you at least say something, Big Sister!?

Sato:
Tanaka...

Marcosias:
Are you leaving that sword behind?

Margery:
Yeah. Besides, it never really suited me. It's too unstable...

Marcosias:
You are so right. And giving an unstable weapon to someone who's unstable as you is just... Ow!

Margery:
Shut up, Stupid Marco.

Marcosias:
And this may be a silly question, but ah, are you sure about this?
The Bal Masque is on the move, you know.

Margery:
That's why I need to be one step ahead of them.
And there are some things we have to take care of, too.

Marcosias:
Yeah, I guess so.

Margery:
We stayed here longer than we should have.

Marcosias:
Yeah, you're maybe right.

Margery:
Good luck to you, Misaki City.

Marcosias:
And good luck to our beloved followers as well.

Tanaka:
Does this... seem right to you?
How could they leave without say anything?
It's just not right.

Sato:
How could you...? Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

Wirhelmina:
So that was the Mystes with the Midnight Lost Child?
We must act upon this immediately.
Indeed we must go as soon as possible.

Shana:
Act upon this... What do you mean?

Wirhelmina:
Bal Masque has always desired the Midnight Lost Child. And now Thousand Changes has found it.
Therefore, as Flame Hazes, it is our duty to thwart them in their nefarious plan with the single most effective method possible, indeed.
In other words, we must destroy the Mystes and transfer the Midnight Lost Child to a different location.

Tiamat:
Random transfer.

Shana:
Wait! Wirhelmina! But that means...

Wirhelmina:
Indeed, as Flame Hazes, this is the only step we can take to resolve this.

Yuji:
I never realized how big Misaki City is.
That's my house, and this is where the school is, and this is Ike's house here.
This is the shopping district where I first met Shana.
And here's the department store where we fought Friagne. This is the museum where we beat Margery.
This is Misaki Bridge, where I faced that Denizen. And the riverbed where we were last night.
All over the city, in a short time...
I'm leaving all this... Leaving to help Shana fight Denizens.
Leaving so that Misaki City doesn't become involved in this struggle.
I'm... a Mystes. And that's the road I have to walk from now on. Isn't that right, Shana?

Wirhelmina:
On a stroll at this late hour?
You've indeed saved me the trouble of drawing you out.
Prepare yourself, Mystes. I must destroy you.
You won't suffer long.

Tiamat:
Single shot kill.

Wirhelmina:
Indeed, it's no use calling for help.
The Flame-Haired Blazing-Eyed Hunter fully supports my decision to destroy you.

Yuji:
Shana... Shana supports this!?

Shana:
I am a... Flame Haze... My mission is to preserve the balance of the world.
I'm a Flame Haze... Flaming-Haired Blazing-Eyed Hunter...

Wirhelmina:
This is the end, indeed.

Tiamat:
Farewell.



The duty of a Flame Haze... And the feelings of a girl...
Shana fights herself conflicted over Yuji, who are still set on leaving the city behind.
