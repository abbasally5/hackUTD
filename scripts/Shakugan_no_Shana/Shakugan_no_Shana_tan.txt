Yuji:
 A morning, no different from any other...
 Nothing out of the ordinary...
 Days like that were supposed to last forever.
 At the time, I couldn't even begin to imagine what was about to happen.
 That day, my world took a very strange path.

Shana:
 Huh? What the heck are you looking at?

Yuji:
 Shana, who are you talking to?
 Come on. We have to go to school.

Shana:
 Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!



Yuji:
 Seriously enough, she's still as strong as ever.


Yuji:
 Cut it out. For crying out loud. Stop eating melon bread when you're sitting on my head.

Shana:
 Fine. I'll start eating dumplings with soy sauce then.

Yuji:
 That would make my hair all sticky so don't even think about it.

Shana:
 You know, you complain too much.

Yuji:
 What? I'm not allowed to complain?

Shana:
 Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
 Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

Kazumi:
 Hmm... It's a coincidence. It's just a coincidence that she's sitting on his head.


Kazumi:
 Hmm... I hope you like it.

Yuji:
 For me? Thanks, I'm starving. Looks delicious.
 What the...?


Yuji:
 Please, don't sharpen the Nietono no Shana when you're on top of my head.

Shana:
 I've got it. I'm gonna run our nightly training sessions from up here.
 My wings of fire will burn everything!

Yuji:
 If you did that, my hair would burn up. I'd be bald.

Shana:
 Huh? Hmm...
 Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Get used to it!
 You're gonna be bald! bald! bald! bald! bald! bald! bald! bald! bald!

Kazumi:
 It's a coincidence. It's just a coincidence that she's sitting on his head.
 I'm gonna kill her!
 Uh! How could I have said that. I'm such an idiot. An idiot.


Alastor:
 It looks like the future holds danger for her. But where exactly am I?
 It is a landscape I am unfamiliar with.
 Night time already?
 I must hurry, for who knows what trouble may befall Shana.
 Hmmm... What to do... Oh, now it's morning?
 Hmm. I must hurry. I should hurry.
 I would hurry if I could hurry. Suddenly it's a grammar lesson. Oh well...
