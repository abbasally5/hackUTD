Takumi:
I'm Takumi Nishijo.
Apparently I know the girl I saw at the murder scene.
Her name is Rimi.
And we go to school together at Suimei Academy.
According to her, we've been good friends for a while now.
The only thing is I don't have any memories of her at all.
Meanwhile I started to fall for this girl, Yua Kusunoki, an upperclassman at the school.
Turns out Yua was investigating me because she believed I was the New Gen murderer.
That's not all.
She said I was sending messages to myself, called it my one-man show.
This girl, she thinks that I'm the General.

Takumi:
The day before my field trip, my parents told me, "I'm so sorry, Takumi, but you can't go."
I had been looking forward to that trip for a week.
I was so angry I couldn't even think straight.
"I hope nobody is able to go. I hope nobody is able to go, " I thought to myself.

Takumi's mother:
Oh, Takumi, something horrible has happened.

Takumi:
A local news channel reported on the incident.
The images on the TV were identical to what I had seen in my mind.
I began to believe that my wish'd come true.
My thoughts had changed reality.

Takumi's mother:
I can't believe this.
Thank goodness. You stayed home.
I don't know what I do if I lost you.
Oh, oh, Taku, we are so blessed.

Takumi:
Blessed, huh?
I wasn't so sure.

Takumi's mother:
Taku?

Takumi:
I started to feel uncomfortable.
I stopped talking to people and began to isolate myself.
Eventually my mom got really worried because of my unusual behavior.
So she took me to the hospital for diagnosis.

Nothing has changed.

Dr. Takashina:
Takumi, look. This hospital doesn't just treat sick people.
We also treat mental disorders.

Takumi:
If I let that doc diagnose me...

Announcement:
Mr. Nishijo. Takumi Nishijo.
Please come to the diagnosis room.

Dr. Takashina:
Hello there. What's your name?

Takumi:
It's Takumi, remember?
Nishijo.

Dr. Takashina:
Right, call me doc.
Nice to meet you.

Takumi:
Dr. Takashina doesn't remember me?

Dr. Takashina:
It says you're trying to determine if you have a sleepwalking disorder, did something happen?

Takumi:
Um, well I... I don't know.
Could it be possible to walk around without realizing?
Maybe the type something extensive on your computer and not have any recollection of doing it?
Does that happen?

Dr. Takashina:
Perhaps.

Takumi:
You see, someone I know told me I'd done.
Now I'm really confused.

Dr. Takashina:
Mr. Nishijo, do you think it's possible this person might be trying to pull a prank on you?

Takumi:
Oh, I don't know.

Dr. Takashina:
Did this person actually see you walking around while you were unconscious, doing all these unusual things?

Takumi:
Mm-mm.

Dr. Takashina:
Okay, so you don't really know if it's true or not.

Takumi:
What worries me is she's sort of like some kind of detective.
And to convince me, she showed me a lot of evidence.

Dr. Takashina:
I see.
Before these alleged incidents occurred, had you shown symptoms of sleepwalking?

Takumi:
No.

Dr. Takashina:
So prior to this person telling you, you had no idea that you might have this problem, correct?

Takumi:
Mmhm.
But I- I just...I-I haven't been sleeping well.

Dr. Takashina:
Are you afraid?
There's really no reason for you to be concerned.

Takumi:
No, that's not...
You see, I...
This isn't right.
This isn't what I wanted to talk about at all.
I haven't been sleeping.
I haven't been sleeping but...
I've been doing things that I don't remember doing.

Dr. Takashina:
There are several different ways for us to determine whether or not you have this disorder.
My recommendation is that you spend the night at the hospital and allow us to monitor your behavior.
It is possible your symptoms won't appear if not at your familiar environment.
But I suppose there's only way to find out.
What do you think?
Would you like to stay overnight?

Hazuki:
Er, Mr. Nishijo? Mr. Nishijo!

I'll wake you up in about three hours, okay?
Don't you worry about a thing.
You are in good hands here.
I'll take excellent care of you.
Just relax, sleep tight.

Seira:
Takky. Wake up, sleepy head.

Takumi:
Seira, baby, wow!
You really wearing a nurse outfit!

Seira:
Hey, you be quiet.
We don't want a real nurse interrupting us, am I right?
Takky, listen to me.
You do not sleepwalk.
And I would know because I watch you sleep every night.
So don't worry about a thing.

Takumi:
Oh Seira.

Seira:
Why are you bothering with the stupid 3D girls, huh?
I thought I was the only woman for you.

Takumi:
No Seira, you are the one.
I only have eyes for you, babe.
I want you to know my only true love.

Hazuki:
Rise and shine.
So tell me how you are feeling, Mr. Nishijo?
You slept like a baby for over three hours.

Takumi:
Oh Seira, babe.

Hazuki:
You showed no signs of sleepwalking condition.
Of course as the doctor mentioned, it's entirely possible that symptoms just didn't appear this time.
So we can't say whether or not you have the disorder just yet.

Takumi:
Excuse me, could I possibly speak with the doctor?

Hazuki:
There's no need.
Just keep an eye on it for the next week or so.
If anything happens, come back and see us.

Female student A:
Then the shadow of a large man slowly crept up on a beautiful unsuspecting little girl, and the next thing you know, his fangs gleamed in the moonlight just like this.

Rimi:
No! I'm scared!
Please don't talk about that!

Female student A:
Oh, c'mon, that story wouldn't scare a baby.
What's the big deal?

Rimi:
Please just stop it. I can't take it anymore.

Female student B:
What a wimp! She can't handle scary stories, can she?

Female student C:
Yeah, she is just sensitive.

Daisuke:
Listen up, ladies! Mr. Wannabe classic teacher needs some help.
So what's the deal? Who's on duty today?

Rimi:
Oh? Me.

Oh, thank you.

Rimi:
Wow, what a myth maniac.
I don't understand people who read those kinds of books all the time.
I wonder what goes through their heads.
Ugh, thanks again.

Ayase:
The Devil King, Gladiale will bring destruction and chaos.
The time is near.
He is coming.

Ria:
Don't you get it? You own both profiles.

Hazuki:
You showed no symptoms of the sleepwalking disorder.

Takumi:
After everything, I still have no idea whether Yua's theory is true.
I can't believe I could've done those things while I was sleeping, and then have no memory of doing them.
That just doesn't make any sense.
She's gotta be making it up.
That picture must be a phony.

Seira:
Then, all you have to do now is find proof that it was a Photoshopped image, right, Takky?
What do you say?
Let's analyze the evidence.

Takumi:
I don't know, that picture's hard to look at.

Seira:
Oh c'mon. It'll be totally worth it.
If you can disprove that crazy woman's theory, then you don't have to be afraid anymore, right?
Then you'll be normal again.

Takumi:
You're right, who does she think she is?
I won't let her blame this mess on me.

Seira:
You, hang in there, Takky.

Takumi:
Right.

Takumi:
Look! It's a person.

Seira:
Who is it?

Takumi:
Let's see...

Seira:
Takky, what's wrong?

Takumi:
What is this!? That can't be!

Seira:
Takky, that's you!

Takumi:
There's no way this is real!
It's not!
I'd never even stepped foot in that place before September 29th.
So how could that be me in the photograph?

Seira:
The General sent this image to you on the 28th of September, one day before the murder occurred, right?
But the staking incident happened on the 29th of September.
And that straight-up means...

Takumi:
That means at the time when it was sent, this was a picture of something that hadn't happened, of something to come.
So this photograph predicted the future.

Yua:
Are you a clairvoyant?
Can you predict the future?

Takumi:
No I can't!

Seira:
The file was created on the 28th!

Takumi:
Those eyes... Whose are they?
Ever since I was a young boy, I've always felt like someone is watching me, every moment.
It never went away.
It got to the point where I even thought that God might be watching me.
I honestly believed that.

Yua:
“DID. Dissociative Identity Disorder is when a single person has multiple personalities.”
You're in pain, Takumi.
But... But I... I just...

Takumi:
Clairvoyance, clairvoyance, clairvoyance

Yua:
The future...

Takumi:
Clairvoyance.
Dammit. There's no conclusive scientific evidence.

Seira:
Well, if that's case, get online and research supernatural stuff.
See what you'll find.

Takumi:
Of course, baby, you are so smart.

Fortune telling... "Phantasm"?,... "FES"!?

"Phantasm is a four-person Gothic punk group that plays sold-out concerts all over the city of Shibuya.
They have become quite popular on the independent rock scene and received much attention just this year. The success is due in large part to a female vocalist called FES."

Seira:
What the heck?
So this “FES” person is the lead singer.
What does that have to do with anything?

Takumi:
I don't know.
How could that relate to seeing the future?
"The New Gen Prediction"?
Is this it?

"Crucifixion Mass"?

"And now we see the Gladiale here
Making right and wrong turn into crimson
And the fallen sheep have gone astray
But he's come to show the way
The needles that appear before your eyes
They're piercing through the skin
and shapes like crosses
cleansing all so radiantly
It's a crucifixion"

"These are the lyrics to what is probably Phantasm's most popular song.
It's written by FES."

Hold on.
What if FES and the demon girl are the same person?
That could explain how FES would be able to predict the event months before it happened.
Because she knew exactly what she was going to do.

Seira:
Isn't there a picture of this FES?

Takumi:
Let me see.
It doesn't surprise me at all seeing as how she is a criminal, I guess she doesn't let her pictures get out on the net.

Seira:
Criminals are always so careful.
How annoying.

Takumi:
Let's see if they have a show lined up.
It's tomorrow.

Seira:
Takky, can you handle a place like this by yourself?

Takumi:
Why not?

Seira:
Well, rock concerts are dark, cramped, and noisy, not to mention the smell.
And plus....

Takumi:
Plus what?

Seira:
Everyone there will be in 3D.

Daisuke:
Taku! Here's the CD, buddy!
I bought one for myself, too.
I'm sorry I had to borrow some cache.
Man, Phantasm is totally awesome.
I'm having a blast!
Just hearing them live today, I'm already a fan.

Takumi:
But about the singer....

Daisuke:
Oh yeah, this chick is totally hot, dude.
Who knew you had such a good taste, man.

Takumi:
Wait, I thought FES was the demon girl.
B-But what was she like?

Daisuke:
You know, If you are so interested in FES, you don't just have to take my word for it.
C'mon in and see for yourself.

Takumi:
N-No, don't.

Daisuke:
Forget about Rimi for just one night.

Takumi:
But I... I got...

Daisuke:
Forget about my girlfriend too.

Ayase:(Singing)
...leaving the door way for you.
There's no one else who can compare
Now you are losing all control
All the way

Takumi:
That's her, FES.

Daisuke:
Yeah!

Ayase:
My friends, I feel better today than I have lately.
My voice sounds crisp, the world seems calm, clear.
Maybe it's because the gate to Cocytus is closed now.
The equilibrium of this world was maintained for thousands of years.
After the Great Will came to be.
But now, my friends, that harmony is being threatened.
It is become unstable.
And that is why I sing.
I will take your chaos and purify it.

Takumi:
Is that a microphone stand?
It looks exactly like a sword?

Ayase:
And now, "The Crucifixion"

Ayase: (singing)
The lights of the street're dying out
I hold a candlestick
The long-awaited time has come.
Crucifixion's here to save us
The blood begins to pour
We feel the signal of cleansing pain

Takumi:
This is the famous song.

Ayase: (singing)
The lights go out and see then one-by-one they fade away
Can you feel the blessing on you now
Just right in front [through] you feel [it flow]
The child of the god is present here.
Here he's here so beware, nears and nears

And now we see the Gladiale here
Making right and wrong turn into crimson
And the fallen sheep have gone astray
But he has come to show the way
The needles that appear before your eyes
They're piercing through the skin
shapes like crosses
cleansing all so radiantly
You're buying us 　　　buy: （神学）神が人間の罪を贖う。贖罪する。
It's a crucifixion

Takumi:
She's looking at me.

Huh?

Daisuke:
Hey, what's wrong?

Ayase:
Those eyes... Whose are they?

Daisuke:
Hey!

Takumi:
She said it. I heard her.
How'd she know that phrase?
Maybe she works for the demon girl?
I don't know.
I will never come back here.

Kozue's mother:
Hey, Kozue. Have you finished packing?
It's almost time to go.
I guess it's time for us to say goodbye to this house.
This is the first time you've been back to Tokyo, isn't it?
Don't worry, you'll make some new friends.

Nanami:
Hey, look! Are you paying attention?
I think I found the winner was this one.
The color is pretty cute, don't you think?

Takumi:
Get whatever you want.

Nanami:
Yeah, but on second thought, it might not be a good [feeling/fiitting].
Could be a little too girly for you.

Takumi:
I can't believe someone would walk around with a huge toy sword in the middle of Shibuya like that.
I thought I was a nerd.

Nanami:
You jerk!
Why do you run away from me?
Look! I'm sorry I'm taking a long time to decide in everything, but this is kind of important!
It's just downright mean to abandon your poor little sister without so much as a word.

Takumi:
N-No. I just...

Nanami:
Stupid brother, how could you be so incredibly mean to me when I love you this much!?
Mmm... I hope you get gastritis!

Takumi:
Ah, where'd that come from?

Nanami:
Fine! You're getting the same model as me!
I don't care what you say.
We're going to sign the contract today, got it?
And you're not going anywhere until you do!

Takumi:
Fine, just relax.

Takumi:
H-Hey.
Man, this is more embarrassing than walking around with a toy sword.
Hey...

Nanami:
I know if you take that phone home, you're just going to ignore it.
So being the good sister that I am, I'm going to make sure you know exactly how to use it.
Ah, look what I got you!
Ta-dah! Remember this?
It's Happy, your favorite frog.

Takumi:
Huh?

Nanami:
You see, every other Friday they'll release a new and improved version of Mr. Happy.
You have to stand in line for a long time to get one.

Takumi:
People line up for that?

Nanami:
Well, because I'm so nice, I bought an extra one for your cellphone.

Takumi:
No thanks.

Nanami:
But I already put it on here.
It's weird. We haven't hung out in a long time, huh?
I don't think I can remember the last time the two of us went shopping together.
Can you, Taku?
After all, you are always at home like a hermit, playing your video games and watching anime.
I think outing like this is sort of nice, don't you? Now and then.
Though it would be boring, if we had to do it everyday.

Takumi:
You know, those things will make you fat.

Nanami:
You want half of this?

Takumi:
Have at it.

Nanami:
If I were you I would try to keep in mind that saying things like that to females so makes them hate you.

Takumi:
That was a colossal waste of time.
I'm gonna get home and play my video game.

It's Grim.
What isn't normal?
The fourth incident has occurred?
The skin turned green?
All the blood was sucked out.
How does he know so much about it?

Net auction?

The photo of the fourth New Gen incident, they were put up for auction just like any other normal things.
Hold on, that means a person who provided these is the New Gen criminal.
The name of the killer is... "Vam-pyre ."
Who's the Vam-pyre?
Those Eyes... Whose are they?
What are those words doing there?
What in the hell are those words doing there?

Those eyes... Whose are they?
