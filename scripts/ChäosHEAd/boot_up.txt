Takumi:
A piercing gaze falls from the sky like rays of light.
Don't look... Not at me.

Rimi:
I'm so sorry.

Takumi:
An angel...
It's me and her.
We are the only two people who exist in this world.
If we were to look into each other's eyes forever, what would I see?
Would my world be confined to what was reflected in hers.
And what would she see?
Would her world be confined to what was reflected in mine.
I am everything to her.
She is everything to me... forever.

Seira:
Takky! C'mon! Wake up! Takky!

Takumi:
Seira, baby!
Hey! This is exactly the way she woke people up in the second episode of Blood Tune!
I'm in heaven.

Seira:
Hurry up, or you'll be late to school!
Get a move on, Mister!
Uh?! Hey!

Takumi:
Aw, it won't hurt anything if I miss the first class today.

Seira:
Oh boy. You might be the laziest person I have ever met.
Making a chart outlining the maximum number of days you can miss and still receive the minimum number of credits required?
You should be ashamed of yourself, Takky!

Takumi:
Those eyes... Whose are they?

Female student A:
No way!

Female student B:
Yes! Yes we did next....

Takumi:
Tsk! Whatever, they probably think I'm disgusting. Tsk.
But I don't care. 3D girls are the ones who are gross.

Daisuke:
Yo! Well, well. Look who decided to come to school today.

Takumi:
Hey! Daisuke. What's up, man?

Daisuke:
As usual, you look down in the dumps?
Stay up too late playing video games?
Not to brag, but yesterday I bagged my third girl in this class.
A few more to go and my collection of the hottest chicks in school will be complete.

Takumi:
Yeah, right.

Daisuke:
Yeah. I wouldn't expect the shut like you to understand.
Hey! I don't suppose you've heard anything about the New Gen crimes, have you?

Takumi:
No. What's the New Gen?

Daisuke:
It's what they're calling all the weird stuff that's been happening lately.
Get a load of this.
In a report the eyewitness said that the criminal is a girl and a bona fide hottie.
Man, if she is as hot as they say, she can perpetrate a crime on me.
I'm in love.

Takumi:
Cool...

Daisuke:
Yeah, yeah. I know it's super cool.
Hey! You wanna come to the scene of the murder with me today?
Maybe we would get lucky in bumping into that sexy killer.
You know what they say, "People always return to the scene of the crime."

Takumi:
No thanks.

Daisuke:
Good talk.

Takumi:
Yes! I did it!

Seira:
Wow, Takky! You are the best!

Takumi:
I just don't deny it is that.
I'm unbeatable in this world.
That's why they call me the Knight Heart, and the best there is! Hee-hee.

Hm? It's from Grim.
Our levels are getting too easy.
How about a challenge?
Reality? Huh? Lame.
You know I don't care about the three-dimensional world.
The New Gen? What's that?
You're slipping, Knight Heart.
Stick around and maybe you'll learn something.
See ya.

Seira:
Look Takky. There's a link there.

Takuya:
There's now a common name for the two incidents that have happened during recent months here in Shibuya.
First named the “ Wrath of the New Generation.” It's now called the “New Gen.”
The first case is about a group of five high school students who committed suicide by jumping off a tall building.
People called this the 'Group Dive.'
The second case involved a male corpse later found to have a fetus stuffed inside it.
This called the 'Pregnant Man.'

Seira:
My goodness. What is this?

Nanami:
Taku!
What gives? Open Up!

Takumi:
It's Nanami.

Nanami:
C'mon! Let me in!
Stupid brother!
You'll get it, if you don't open this door.
C'mon! Let me in!

Nanami:
So you're still alive!

Nanami:
It stinks here. Why is your bedroom always such a disgusting mess?
Didn't I tell you to clean up?
Don't you ever listen?
Well. Since you don't have a girlfriend who is willing to do it for you, and since I'm such an amazing sibling, I decided I'm going to help you.

Takumi:
No thanks.

Nanami:
What do you mean?!

Takumi:
Look, this is my room.
I don't want you in here messing everything up.

Nanami:
You jerk! How can you be so mean to your little sister who came all this way to just make sure you are okay.
It's not fair. Why was I cursed such a hateful big brother who causes me nothing but trouble.

Takumi:
I don't know.

Nanami:
I am dying of thirst.
Let me take a sip.

Takumi:
Er, you gotta at least use a cup, you know.

Nanami:
I am using one.

Takumi:
Aw, okay then.

Nanami:
Hm?

Takumi:
Hey, will you please leave.
Arent't you done annoying me yet?

Nanami:
No, actually I'm not.
I'm going to help you purchase a new cell phone.
It's Dad's idea.
That way, we can always be in touch.
You should get the same model as me.
I can even get us matching charms. How cool is that?

Takumi:
Gross. The person who designed that should be shot.

Nanami:
You don't know Happy the Frog?!
He's so hot right now!

Highschool girl fashion trend. There is no way he'll ever understand that.

Whatever! Let's go get your phone!
And just so you know we're not getting the same model so we can match.
We're doing it because Daddy says we can get a family discount.

Takumi:
No, I don't want it.

Nanami:
Why not? Dad's paying for it.
It's not you have to do anything.

Takumi:
I don't need one.

Nanami:
Sometimes I just can't stand you!
Good bye!

Takumi:
Jeez.

Nanami:
You could at least walk me to the bus station!

Takumi:
Don't feel like it.

Nanami:
This neighborhood has been dangerous lately, you know.

Takumi:
You don't say...

Nanami:
No way... You don't even care what happens to your own sister?
Jackass! Jackass! I hope that serial killer chops you up into little pieces!

Takumi:
Finally some peace and quiet.
Those eyes... Whose are they?

The General?
An image link?
Nah, where did he come from out of the blue?
A virus? There's no way I'm gonna fall for that.
Better luck next time.
What's with this guy?
I won't click your link. Not a virus?
Huh? Is that so?
Don't be so cryptic then?
Where are you from?
Shibuya? Me too. Strange happenings lately, huh?
There's more to come.
A formula?
Wait! What is this?
Who is this General person?
Some sort of doomsday nutcase?
What's the deal with this link?
You're saying that if I click on it, things will get interesting?
Give it a try.
Oh, no. What is this?

Nanami:
Nanami Smash!
Sorry.

Yua:
Huh?

Nanami:
Excuse me!

Yua:
Huh?

Nanami:
Hey, throw it over here!

Yua:
Sure! Here it comes!
Oh... Ah, one more time!
Here it comes!

Nanami:
Jeez! That girl was terrible.
I've never seen anyone that bad.
She must be rich and spoiled.

Takumi:
Thanks to the General guy, I can't relax at home.
I'll just hang out here for a little bit in the usual spot.

Good times.
Huh? That's the same one Nanami has.
Why would you want three?
Researching New Gen? Hmm...
And just when everything was starting to look up.

What's that? I am in Shibuya, right? At least I think.
What's this?
That's the image from the General's link...

Rimi:
Hello. I've been waiting for you, Taku.

Rimi:
Hello. I've been waiting for you, Taku.

Takumi:
What!? How does that girl know my name?

What the hell was that? What is happening to me?

[If] she saw my face. She looked at me and called me by my name.
What should I do?

Seira:
Hey! It's okay, Takky.
I'm sure it was just one of your delusions.

Takumi:
B-But that stake.

Seira:
I don't see anything.

Takumi:
Ha, you're kidding.

Seira:
Now, no more negative delusions, Mister. Think positive, okay?
Don't I love you most when you are happy?

Takumi:
You're right, Seira. It must have been a delusion.
What was I thinking. Happy thoughts from now on.

Ayase: (Singing)
Now I can see the shape of a cross here
Dark gray needles form image for me
Washing [your soul is what you need]
Cleansing your sin
Our prays are with you
Holy one

Ayase:
Those eyes... Whose are they?

Takumi:
Who is that? Someone's watching me?
Dammit! Why is she following me?
Maybe it's the demon girl from yesterday.
Has she come here to kill me?

Yua:
Hey! Hope you're having a good morning.

Takumi:
Did I do something to make her hold a grudge against me?
No. That's impossible. No one pays attention to me.
I might've [been all/all been] invisible.
I don't know. Maybe I was overreacting with the whole being followed thing.

I was right! She's been stalking me since this morning.
She must be working with that devil girl!

Stop it! No!
Was that a delusion?
Either way, I'd better get out of here.
That was so not awesome.

Yua:
Excuse me but are you gonna be okay?
Do you need me to take you to the hospital or something?

Takumi:
Who are you?
Why are you following me?
Please, tell me what you want from me.

Yua:
Are you... Well, you see, I wanted to...
Well, my name is Yua Kusunoki. And I just...
Well, the truth is... after I saw you this morning, I couldn't get you out of my mind.

Takumi:
I see. She is trying to seduce me.
I won't fall for it.
Er, listen! You're bothering me.
So please stop following me around.

Yua:
I'm so sorry.

Takumi:
Wait! Is she being sincere?
Jus- Just please leave me alone.

Yua:
You sure you don't need a doctor?

Takumi:
Look! I'm fine!

Yua:
At least let me walk you home.
After all it's my fault you got hurt in the first place.
Let me help it.
It's no biggie.
Um, what part of town do you live in?

Takumi:
Um, Shinsen...

Yua:
Shinsen?

Takumi:
Oh crap. Why did I just tell her that?
What am I expecting out of this?

Nanami:
I swear my brother's so mean to me sometimes!
And what pisses me off even more is his obsession with those stupid little dolls.

Nanami's friend A:
So your brother is one of those guys, huh? Only interested in Anime chicks?

Nanami's friend B:
Uh, boys like that are totally weird.

Nanami:
The weirdest!

Nanami's friend A:
But you know what?
More women than you'd expect actually go for those types of guys.
I have a friend like that and she thinks “So I can change them. I'm gonna save them all from themselves.”

Nanami's friend B:
Hey! Maybe Takumi can find the girl to rescue him from his otaku ways.

Nanami:
What? My brother?

Nanami's friend B:
Sure! Why not?

Takumi:
I... I think I can take it from here, thanks.

Yua:
Wow, this is it? This is such a cool place to live.
I can get used to this. It's awesome.
It's got a real outlaw vibe to it.
Living life on the the edge, I know that.

Takumi:
I won't be fooled. I'll never let a 3D girl get the best of me!

Yua:
Feeling any better?

Takumi:
Yeah, I guess. She's so gentle and considerate.
No! I won't be tricked. I will not be fooled.

Yua:
Oh! That's Seira from Blood Tune. I love her.

Takumi:
Wait! Do you know Blood Tune?

Yua:
Yeah! I watch it every week.
It's my favorite TV show by far.

Takumi:
Aw. Wow...

Yua:
So you are a fan of Seira, too?
I thinks she is awesome, definitely the coolest heroine out there.

Takumi:
Are, Are you really an Anime nurd?
Oh, nothing...

Yua:
Hey! Do you mind if I take a look at these?
Um, I'm really sorry if I'm being too pushy here.
I guess I should probably go home now.

Takumi:
No. Go ahead and look.

Yua:
Are... Are you sure?
Oh! Thank you so much.

Takumi:
That's the very first version of the Seira action figure.
They've released a bunch of different editions since the game came out.
That one's definitely my favorite.

Yua:
Wow.

Takumi:
Did you see that shelf right there?

Yua:
Cool! You have so many!
That's awesome!

Takumi:
Actually, I have every Seira figurine ever made.
I've been waiting for them to release the newest version.
But it's probably gonna be pretty expensive.

Yua:
You mean the awakened version form the big scene of episode 12?

Takumi:
Wow, I'm really impressed.
You sound like a super fan.

Yua:
Yeah. I guess I am.
I can't stop watching that episode. It gets better every time.

Takumi:
I think the reason it's so awesome is 'cause the acting and animation director is the same.
He is easily one of the best directors in the business.
So the high quality is to be expected.

Yua:
Wow! You really do know a lot about this kind of stuff, don't you?

Takumi:
You should pay attention to the writers and directors who work on the shows.

Yua:
Oh, I will now. Thanks for teaching me something new.
Hey... I don't mean to be too forward.
But would you tell me your name?

Takumi:
Yeah. I'm Takumi Nishijo.

Yua:
It's nice to meet you, Takumi.
What year are you?

Takumi:
Aw, S- Second.

Yua:
Hey! I'm in third year.
I guess that means I'm older than you are, huh.

Takumi:
Oh no. I'm falling for it.
I think she's getting to me.
Is Yua like the serene gentle older girl?

Yua:
So Takumi. I have a small favor to ask of you.

Takumi:
A favor?

Yua:
I want you. I've wanted you for a long time.
I've always had my eye on you, Takumi.
What's the matter?
Don't you wanna get to know me better?

Takumi:
Why is she wearing Seira's bikini?

Yua:
Ow... I-I'm sorry. I'm such a klutz.
I hope I didn't break any of your CDs.
I'll clean it up right away.

Takumi:
Uh, that's okay.

Yua:
Oh no. It's nothing.
Don't pay attention to me.

Takumi:
Please... try not to touch the figurines, okay?

Yua:
Ah, okay.... But that wasn't it.
I don't mean to alarm you, but it's a fanficiton mag.
There's some pretty racy stuff in here.
I'm sorry. I wasn't expecting to see something like that.

Takumi:
Don't look through my things.

Yua:
I'm sorry!
So like I was saying before, I have a favor to ask.
I really wanna go to an anime store.
Would you please come with me?

Takumi:
Huh?

Yua:
As much as I love it, I've never been before.
But I've always wanted to see what one was like.
A-Ah, this is kind of a bold move on my part since I barely know you.
I'm sorry.

Takumi:
This has got to be a trap.
Things like this don't happen.
This is like some far-fetched plot out of an erotic fantasy game.

Yua:
Well, let's forget about it.
I don't wanna put you on [a/the] spot or anything.
It was good enough just to be able to have a nice, long chat with you.

Takumi:
This is an act.
I have to reject her.
I've gotta tell her like a man.
You've gotta be kidding.
She's crying.
Now I'm just lost.
What the hell is she up to?

Yua:
Please there is no need to force it.
Anyway, it's not really fair for me to drag you along for my own selfish reasons.

Takumi:
I'll... go.

Yua:
Wait! Are you serious?

Takumi:
Mmhm.

Yua:
Oh, this is wonderful.
Thank you.

Takumi:
That look on your face won't fool me.

Yua:
I'm so sorry if I overstayed my welcome tonight.
You really should go see a doctor if you are not feeling better tomorrow.
Bye bye.

Takumi:
Don't worry, Seira.
You are always be my number one girl.
I'll be waiting for your awakened version to come out.

News caster:
And in another news, another dead body was discovered in an alley in Shibuya late yesterday evening.
A man was left to die after being pined to a wall with metal stakes.
This is the latest in a series of brutal murders, commonly know as the New Gen crimes.
The Police Department is launching a full-scale investigation in order to put a stop to this horrific chain of events.

Rimi:
Good morning.

Female students:
Morning.

Takumi:
No. There's no way.
It's really her!

Rimi:
Hm? Hey there, Taku.

Those eyes... Whose are they?
