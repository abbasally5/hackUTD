Takumi:
Hi! My name is Takumi Nishijo.
I'm a second year.
I'm 17 years old.
Basically, I'm what you might call an Otaku.
Right now, in Shibuya where I live, a mysterious string of events known as the New Gen has been terrorizing our city.
I never had any interest in the 3D world until recently.
Ever since a guy called the General showed me that image predicting a New Gen crime, I haven't been able to get it out of my mind.
Especially now.
Because I saw it happen with my own eyes.
It was exactly like it was in the picture.
Also a girl I go to high school with might be the murderer.
What's worse... she's sitting right next to me in class.

Takumi:
Oh, oh now!
The demon girl!
AAUUGGHH!

Rimi:
(Giggle) What's the matter with you?

Takumi:
No. What are you doing here?
What do you want from me?
Aw, help me! Don't murder me! Please!
I'm begging you!

Rimi:
Ten-hut!
Stand up and get it together!
You are babbling like a crazy person, you weirdo!

Hey, what's wrong?
C'mon!

Takumi:
No way!
I saw it!
I saw you- you murdered that person.

Rimi:
Thanks a lot.
I don't know why you're being so mean to me?
What did I do?

Takumi:
Wait! You're going to kill me, too, aren't you?

Rimi:
I certainty never thought I would be accused of murdering somebody.
I don't like it.

Takumi:
Spare me! Don't kill me!

Rimi:
Now stop!
I am utterly offended, Taku!

Rimi:
Taku...

Takumi:
Hey! How do you know my name?
Do you... know me?

Rimi:
Are you... kidding?
How long have we been friends?

Takumi:
We are friends?!

Rimi:
What are you up to?
Is this some kind of a joke?
I know I'm not the smartest girl in class and my grades aren't spectacular but it hurts my feelings when you make fun of me.
You should be ashamed.

Takumi:
Hey! Who are you, devil girl?!

Rimi:
I see. So you don't even recognize your own classmates any more, is that it?
You jerk!
I guess there's not much hope for you.
After all you barely show up for school, so...
You don't know it. You actually forgot my name.
You didn't, did you? You know it, right?
You ought to know it, Taku.

Takumi:
It's... Rimi.

Rimi:
That'll be right!
Rimi, Rimi Sakihata!
I'm really glad you remember me!
Wow! What a relief!

Takumi:
I don't understand.
How do I know what this girl's name is?
How?

Daisuke:
Guys! What's up?

Rimi:
Hey! Good morning, Daisuke.

Daisuke:
As usual, you are like a couple of peas in a pod.
You should just date and get it over with.

Rimi:
You're not gonna believe this!
Taku was so mean to me just now!

Takumi:
Oh man. That's weird. Daisuke acted like me and the demon girl being together is a normal thing!
That doesn't make any sense.

Daisuke:
Jeez, dude!
You miss a couple of days of school and you forget about your closest friends.
I would be one thing, but you two have been in the same class since your first year of school.

Takumi:
What?
We've known each other that long?

Daisuke:
Hello? We just hung out together a few days ago.
See?

Takumi:
No! No way!

Daisuke:
You know, someone as nerd as you should be thankful.
You are lucky you have friends at all, Mr. computer geek.

Rimi:
Hey now! That was a low blow!

Daisuke:
Yeah, but it's true.

Takumi:
That Girl. I swear I've never seen her before in my life, at least I think.
Just stop talking to yourself.

Seira:
You're having more than scary delusions, aren't you, Takky?

Takumi:
Seira, you don't understand.
The demon girl is real.
She isn't a delusion.

Seira:
Oh yes, she is!
Just trust me, okay?

Takumi:
Yeah, but...

Seira:
You're such a worry wart, Takky.
Just relax, she'll be gone before you know it.
Why don't you forget about it and play your game.

Takumi:
Yeah, you're right.
I just need to forget about this stupid 3D world.

Seira:
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

Takumi:
You know, it's true.
I'm like a god in this game.
No one even comes close to me.

Seira:
That's the spirit!

Rimi:
Taku...

Takumi:
Huh!?

Rimi:
Don't even think about running away.
I'll find you wherever you go.
It is time.
Don't be scared.
Let it happen.

Takumi:
Guess that was another delusion.
What a relief.

Rimi:
Taku! It's really not safe to leave your door unlocked, especially with all the weird things happening lately.

Takumi:
Is this a delusion, too?

Rimi:
Ever time I come over here, your Seira collection has grown.

Takumi:
Ou! No reality.

Rimi:
Oh, looky here!
Hey! That's the pre-awakened figurine, isn't it?
That post-awakened version has gotta be coming out any day now, don't you think?

Takumi:
H-How do you know that?

Rimi:
Well, duh.
You told me a couple of days ago, silly.

Takumi:
That's not possible.
Hey, hold on.
What're you doing here?

Rimi:
Well. You didn't seem like yourself at school today, so I came over to check on you.
You really don't look good.
I know, I'll cook you a nutritious meal.
That'll perk you up.

Takumi:
Please go home.

Rimi:
What!?

Takumi:
Just leave me alone!

Ban's superior:
Inspector, let's hear your report.
Inspector! Inspector Ban, are you paying attention?

Mamoru:
Hey, boss! You're up now.
They're calling you!

Ban:
Yeah. Sorry about that.
My partner, he'll do the report.

Mamoru:
But... I'm not prepared.

Ban:
Improvise.

Mamoru:
I apologize.
I wasn't aware I was doing this presentation.
Moving on then.
We have a footage of a suspicious man near the incident.
Here it is now.
This was recorded by private security cameras located at approximately 50 meters from the scene of the crime.
As I'm sure most of you gentlemen are aware, according to the statements given by nearby residents, several different witnesses heard distinct hammering sounds in a distance between 9 o'clock and 9:30 pm.
At 9:34, our mysterious man runs by.
In other words, he's fleeing the scene, right after the murder occurred.
Based on the crime lab's analysis, we're pretty sure he is a young man; probably somewhere between 15 and 20 years old.
And there's more...
We were able to match his clothes to Suimei Academy, a private school located nearby.
I'd like you gentlemen to pay special attention to what's in his right hand.

Ban:
And what exactly is this young man holding in his right hand?
A metal stake – a stake that just so happens to be the only weapon used in this particular murder.

Ban's superior:
Meaning this kid is most likely our perp, correct?
We even have him running from the scene of the crime.

Ban:
Yeah, it looks that way to me.

Mamoru:
Figures stealing the best part for yourself, huh?

Ban:
Yup! He's finally given himself away.
The best thing we can do is catch the son of a bitch and get him to sign a confession.

Takumi:
Don't think about it. Don't think about it.
The demon girl isn't real.
Seira my lover, please lend me your strength.

(Someone is knocking on the door)

No way! The demon girl?!

Yua:
Takumi, you there?
I'm sorry to bother you.
Can I come in?

Takumi:
Hey! That voice is... Yua?

Yua:
We have our appointment.
You did remember, right?

Takumi:
Huh?

Yua:
You said you'd take me to the anime store to help me reserve a Seira action figure?

Takumi:
Oh yeah. I totally forgot about it because of the demon girl.

Yua:
Hey! I hope it's okay I dropped by your place and picked you up.

Takumi:
Uh... It's no big deal.

Yua:
Well, Sorry for asking you to do something like this when we barely know each other.

Takumi:
It's fine.

This is awful.
[xxxx xxxx] be sick.
I'll hurry up and get this over with and get back to base.

Nanami:
Taku?

Takumi:
Huh? Hey!

Nanami:
Hey! Who is this pretty girl?
Is she your girl friend?

Takumi:
No, of course, she is not my girl friend.
I'm just taking her to the anime store so she can reserve an action figure.

Nanami:
Oh, so she is into dolls, too.
That makes sense.
There's no way he could get a girl like her.

Yua:
Hey there.
My name is Yua Kusunoki.
I'm a friend of Takumi's.

Nanami:
Hi! I'm his sister, Nanami.

Yua:
I'm so sorry for dragging your brother along with me.
I needed help.

Nanami:
Oh, it's no problem.
He's a disgusting slob.
But by all means, please take care of him.

Takumi:
Aw.

Nanami:
Now you listen up!
This girl is way out of your league.
I think you're lucky she'll even be seen in public with somebody like you.
So don't screw it up, okay!

Yua:
Oh gosh! I'm starting to get a little bit nervous.
Promise me you won't go home by yourself and leave me here all alone.

Takumi:
I won't.

Yua:
I'm sorry, not only did you take me to the store but that I made you carry all my stuff, too.

Takumi:
Oh no. It's nothing.

Yua:
Oh, I almost forgot to ask you.
Do you have a cellphone by chance?

Takumi:
Mm-mm.

Yua:
Well, I guess we can't keep in touch then.

Takumi:
Er, in touch?

Yua:
But wait!
You have a computer back at your place, don't you?
Maybe we should exchange email addresses.

Takumi:
Well... What for?

Yua:
Er... Well, when the action figure is ready, I'm going to come back here and pick it up, right?
I really don't think I have the courage to go back to that place by myself.
To tell you the truth, I'd like to get to know you better.
If that's okay with you, I mean.



Seira:
You've got mail, you silly boy!

Takumi:
Yua?
Man, she's fast.

Yua:
Good evening. This is Yua.
I couldn't resist so I emailed you.
I'm sorry for making you come along with me today.
I really did have an amazing time.
Maybe it's because I've never been to a store like that before.
Or maybe it's because I got to spend the day with you, Taku.
Hey, what time do you think you'll be going to school tomorrow morning?
Er, you're probably wondering why I wanna know that, huh?
It's no big deal. I just wanted to say “Hi” to you.
At the very least, I hope we are lucky enough to bump into each other at some point.
Well, good night. Have sweet dreams.
I'll write again soon.

Seira:
Are you going to reply?

Takumi:
Huh? Yeah, right.
I'm not writing her back.
2D girls are the only ones for me!
I'll just delete this.

Seira:
You bad boy!

Takumi:
Stop. That tickles.

Rimi:
Hey! Who are you looking for?

Yua:
Huh?

Rimi:
I can help you out.

Yua:
Thank you very much.
I'm trying to find Takumi.

Rimi:
Taku? Well, he's absent today.

Yua:
Oh, I see.

Rimi:
So you are a friend of Taku's?

Yua:
Yes.

Rimi:
I'm surprised.
He never mentioned he had such a beautiful friend before.

Yua:
We just met actually.
We don't know each other that well.
Yesterday Takumi and I went to the anime store.
He helped me pick out some things.

Rimi:
Wow, so you two went out?

Male student:
Hahaha

Female student:
Get back here!

Male student:
Hahaha! Keep away from me!

Rimi:
So... what else did you do?

Yua:
Huh? Well, nothing really, just shopping.

Rimi:
Oh, I see.
Then everything's fine.
I'm sorry for asking such weird questions.

Yua:
No. It's fine.

Takumi:
I don't care what anyone else says, the demon girl is a delusion.
Seira, she is the only one I can believe.

Yua:
Takumi! Wait up!

Takumi:
Huh?

Yua:
I saw you from behind.
At least I thought it might be useful, so I started calling your name.
I ran as fast as I could to catch you.
I sure hope you're having an excellent morning.

Takumi:
She won't give up, will she.
What is she expecting from me?

Yua:
Oh, I love you.
Hold me.

Takumi:
Oh boy... Oh boy... Oh boy... Oh boy...

Yua:
Oh boy...? What're you saying?

Hey! Did you get that email I sent you?
Did you have a chance to read it yet?

Takumi:
Yeah.

Yua:
That's great.
You didn't reply, so I was kinda worried you hadn't got mail yet.

Yua:
Um... So I went to your classroom yesterday to say good morning.
They said you were absent.
I thought maybe you caught a bad cold or something like that.
I was worried about you.

Takumi:
I hardly ever go to school.
People think I'm a hermit.

Yua:
Well. That's too bad.
But hey! I'm glad I ran into you today.

Just don't let those kids at school get to you.
I don't care what they say, Takumi.
You're not a hermit.
I... I'm sorry.
I should probably keep my mouth shut.

Takumi:
No, please...
I'm used to it.

Yua:
Well, I think you're amazing.
Because despite all of the people who make fun of you, occasionally you still try and go to school.

Takumi:
But I... I'm not anything.
Just a nerd.

Yua:
So you like anime and computer games.
That doesn't mean you are a nerd.
I like you just the way you are.

Takumi:
What!? What's her deal?
Why is she saying this?
Why is this girl being so nice to me?

More importantly, why does she make me feel so good?

Yua:
Oh no! The tardy bell!
I'd better go, Takumi.
If I don't hurry, I'll be late. Bye-bye.

Yua:
Um, do you have time after class?
Are you busy?
Well, I wanted to ask you... I mean if you don't have plans, do you wanna meet up after school?
I thought you and I could walk home together or something fun like that.
I'll wait for you in the courtyard after school, okay?
See you later.

Takumi:
It's definitely not a delusion. Oh boy...

Takumi:
You're kidding me. Wow!
Yua. She really came. She waited here just for me.
I know she won't betray me.
A person like her, she might even be able to save me.

Yua:
Hey! You scared me.
You really came.
I was so worried you wouldn't show up.
What do you think? You wanna walk home together?

Takumi:
Er, yeah.

There's nothing special about this place.
It's beautiful and peaceful.
So why do I suddenly feel like crying?

Yua:
Hey! Is everything all right?

Takumi:
Aw, yeah.

Those little frogs... I remember seeing those somewhere.
The Internet Cafe...
Wait a sec, was she the one next door?

Yua:
Do you like those?
Happy the Frog.
They are super popular right now.
You can take one if you like.
I have plenty.
That's weird, it won't come off.
Aw...

Takumi:
New Gen research.
Printouts...
Why?

Hey! What's that?
Say something.
Why won't you answer?
I can't believe that I trusted her.
I started to believe that she was on my side.
She was really a friend to me.
In the end, there's no way someone like you or whatever like someone like me.
She only got close to me because she wants something.
This is bad. This is really bad!

Yua:
Don't move.
You stay right here.
I'm sorry I had to trick you, but you're no better.
You're hiding something too, aren't you?
Tell me the truth!

Takumi:
She had this whole thing planned out... from the beginning.
Everything she told me, every nice thing she said, it was all lies!
Shit! Shit!
I can't believe I fell for it.
How could I have been so gullible?

Yua:
Originally, I have planned to do some more investigating.
But you found me out, so that's that.
There's something I need to talk to you about.
And you're going to listen to me.
You're going to tell me what I want to know.
Do you understand, Takumi?
I will ask, and you will answer.
Because if you don't...

Takumi:
Huh!

Yua:
You recognize this, don't you!
You've seen it!
Of course you have, and don't try to tell me otherwise because I know the truth!
It would be odd if you didn't!
You know it, don't you? Don't you, Takumi!

After all, I found it in your room! On your floor! Under your bed!
Tossed on the ground.
It was you! You left it there!
Did you throw it away, hoping no one would find it!
But someone did!

This weapon is exactly the same as the one used in the third New Gen case, isn't it?
It's the same.
Tell me the truth.
Tell me it's the same one, say it!
The same one used to pin that poor man to the wall!

Takumi:
Oh no! This girl really believes I'm the New Gen murderer.
She thinks she is a cop.
The teenage detective on the case, huh?
You're wrong.

Yua:
I'm sorry.
I don't mean you any harm.
All I wanted was to confront you and find out if you knew anything relevant.
I'm really sorry.
I didn't plan on being so direct.
Also, there's one more thing I need to confirm.
Are you a clairvoyant?
Can you predict the future?

Takumi:
Huh?!

Yua:
I'm assuming you have that power.
Otherwise there's no explanation for the image on your computer.

Takumi:
Bu- But that's...

Yua:
Why would you have a picture of the New Gen's third case stored on the hard drive of your computer.
And how did you get that picture one day before the actual event occurred?

Takumi:
I... I don't know.
Some guy called the General sent me a link when we were chatting online, and I clicked on it.
Wait a second.
It's you. You were the General!
Are you trying to set me up or something?
Please, don't do this.

Yua:
I found this image stored on the hard drive in the computer in room 37 at the Internet Cafe.

Takumi:
Wait! Room 37?
That's the room I always go to.

Yua:
Just look.
This is a record of all your chats.
I noticed something strange in there.
The timestamps of Knight Heart and the General's chats don't line up at all.

Takumi:
Huh.

Yua:
That's the list of your entries as Knight Heart.
The timestamp says you posted on September 9th at 3:00 am.
Then two day passed, and you went to the Internet Cafe, at 7:00 o'clock, at the same time the General posted it.

Takumi:
What? What are you saying?

Yua:
You are putting on a one-man show.

Takumi:
But I... I don't...

Yua:
Don't you get it?
You own both profiles.

Takumi:
Stop it!
Let me be!

Yua:
It's you, Takumi.
You are the General.

Takumi:
It's not real.
This isn't happening.
I wasn't meant to be born into a world like this.
I've never belonged here.

Those eyes... Whose are they?
