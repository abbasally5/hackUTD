  Utao:
We're together now.



Kyosuke:
"A break-in, followed by a struggle, a crack in the gas line, and then an explosion..."
"Fortunately, damage was minimal, and there were no deaths. The building itself sustained only minor damage. The burglar escaped."
I don't think a robber entering through an eight-story window is very credible, do you?

Man:
No, I don't. But there were signs that someone did do that.
And the next door neighbor heard a really loud noise.

Kyosuke:
He's at N University?

Man:
He what? But wait a minute.
Isn't your daughter at NU as well?
What is she doing in school?

Kyosuke:
Urgh...

Man:
What's the matter?

Kyosuke:
Don't even ask.
I don't even want to think about it.



Guy:
Huh? Barricade ourselves inside?
What are you saying, Chief?

Kuuko:
I heard the school will enter by force tomorrow.
You and I are going to fight to the last!

Guy:
Chief, please reconsider this...
We're the ones using the building without permission.
Don't you realize we're in the wrong here?

Kuuko:
What are you talking about?
How long do you think it's taken me to set up all this equipment here?
I can't just hand it over after I've done all this work, you jackass!

Guy:
But what are you researching, anyway?
Plasma? Auras? It's all crazy stuff.

Kuuko:
Yes, that's exactly it!
The world contains tons and tons of crazy mysteries.
Our job is to scientifically explain each of them, and use them to destroy the so-called science that dominates the rest of the world!
That is the True-Science Club's investigative mission!
I say, bring on the crazy!



Kyohei:
Okay, good work. Once more.

Hibino:
I'm so glad that we have a place like this.

Kyohei:
Yeah, it's not really safe to train with other people around.

Hibino:
Utao-chan, you're really good!

Kyohei:
I'm sorry. Could you not talk to her too much?

Hibino:
Oh, I'm sorry.

Kyohei:
You, idiot! Don't lose your focus over a single compliment!
Concentrate! Concentrate!

Hibino:
I thought a god would be a little more impressive, huh?

Kyohei:
Yeah, you think so.
We don't really know much about them.
In the village, the means to control them is passed down.

Hibino:
To control them?

Kyohei:
Certain people are chosen for the special position of a Seki.
They put their soul into the kakashi and control them.
For years, we've used them to help with logging and building, or to repel enemies.

Hibino:
Then, that person who you said ran away...

Kyohei:
Yeah.
He's had the talent since he was little, but there were problems with his personality.

Hibino:
So, is he still... um...

Kyohei:
He should be imprisoned for the rest of his life.
That's pretty much the best thing for him.
Huh?

Hibino:
Hey, would either of you two like some lunch?
Without more time, this was all I could make.
I'm sorry. But here you go!

Kyohei:
Wow! Thanks! It looks really great!
It's delicious!
You shouldn't have gone to all this trouble.

Hibino:
Oh, there are plenty of them, so eat up!

Kyohei:
Haa... Is this a dream?
I'm eating a handmade lunch.
Hibino-san made for me.
If only we were alone...
No, Utao is the only reason I'm here.

Hibino:
Utao-chan!
Ah! You were that hungry?

You were that hungry?
You ate breakfast, didn't you?

Utao:
Controlling a kakashi takes a ton of energy and concentration.

Hibino:
Oh...
Hey, were you also a Seki, Kuga-kun?

Kyohei:
Ah, yeah...
I used to control Kukuri.
You see, I got fired because I didn't have enough talent, so Utao took my place.
I think it was for the best.
She's better at putting her heart into the kakashi.
When someone like me does it.

Hibino:
Hmm...
But I am a bit surprised.
My first impression of you was that you were a little wimpy.
But when Utao-chan's around, you really do act like an older brother to her.

Kyohei:
W-Was that a compliment?
I'm having a hard time feeling good about it.



Kuuko:
What? Quit the club?
You're my last slave... I-I mean, a member of... member A... yeah...
Let's eat!

Guy:
You don't even know my name...

Kuuko:
It's not important. I mean who cares.

Guy:
I'm just a lackey! A slave!
Every day, I have to run your personal errands.
Then there's the crazy stuff I have to do for the club funds, and now we're fighting the school?!

Kuuko:
Yeah, yeah.

Guy:
It took me two years to get into this school.
After all that, I won't get expelled because of you!

Kuuko:
Don't point at people.

Guy:
I'm quitting!

Kuuko:
What?

Guy:
No matter what you say, I'm quitting today!

Kuuko:
Oh, hold on! Rethink it.
I'll let you have some fun.
It's a lot of fun, if you know what I mean.

Guy:
Don't!
You're not seducing me!

Kuuko:
Wait! Hey, leave the car!

Hey, I said "leave the car!"

Guy:
I'm not leaving it. It's my car!

Kuuko:
Shut up! Give me the car!

Guy:
Get off of me!



Utao, Kyohei, Hibino:
Ah!

Utao:
It wasn't me!

Hibino:
That was the club area...

Utao:
Kyohei!

Kyohei:
Yeah, okay, be careful.
Don't let anyone see you.



Kuuko:
Uh... What?
Hey, slave! Wake up!
Oh, this is bad...
Hey, idiot! Wake up! Useless, little...
What?

Hibino:
Kuga-kun?!

Kyohei:
Dummy! Just remove the door!
Calm down. It's okay.
Ah!

Utao:
I've got to do it right...
Kyohei's watching... Don't screw up!

Kyohei:
Hey!

Utao:
Kyohei...
So, do you not... do you not like the kakashi?
I shouldn't have come, should I?

Kyohei:
Look. This isn't the time, okay?
That's not true. I was really really happy to see you again.

Kuuko:
What?

Kyohei:
You did very well.

Hibino:
I see... So it's a god.

Kyohei:
You idiot, don't stop concentrating!



Kuuko:
Achoo!
What was that?



Kyohei:
(Yawn)

Hibino:
Ah!

Kyohei:
Hm? Uh...



Kyohei:
H-Hibino-san... H-Hibino-san, wait!
I-I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm sorry!
I was wrong! I just... I-I wasn't thinking.
I didn't mean anything by it!

Hibino:
It's all right, already.
We need to lay down some ground rules since we're, you know, living together.

Kyohei:
Ah! Yes, we are living together, right?

Hibino:
Anyway, is it okay for Utao-chan to stay home all the time like this?

Kyohei:
Yeah, don't worry about it.

Hibino:
Correspondence course?

Kyohei:
Yes. Only Seki are allowed to do it.
And only through our village.

Utao:
That's all for today.

Hibino:
But is that really enough?

Kyohei:
She's actually good at studying and doing homework.

Hibino:
Hmm...

Kuuko:
Hey, you two seem to be getting along.

Hibino:
Oh, hey, Kuuko.

Kuuko:
May I sit down?

Kyohei:
Ah, Hibino-san?

Hibino:
What's wrong?

Kyohei:
That's the person we saved with Kukuri!

Hibino:
What? Are you telling me it was Kuuko?

Kuuko:
Hey, you really are getting along.
I guess the rumor about you two is finally coming true.

Hibino:
Rumor?

Kuuko:
That after all those rejections, someone finally got Hibino to date them.

Kyohei, Hibino:
What?!

Hibino:
It's not true at all, Kuuko!
Kuga-kun and I totally aren't... um...

Kyohei:
Immediate denial?

Hibino:
He has some problems at home, so I...

Kuuko:
Judging by the strength of her denial, she must have some feelings for him.

Kyohei:
She didn't have to be so firm about it.

Kuuko:
And I guess the guy's just an idiot.

Oh, so you're from the same village?

Hibino:
That's right.
Anyway, you must have had a hard time, um...
I heard your clubhouse caught fire.

Kuuko:
Oh, how did you know?
I didn't think anyone's really mentioned it before now, to be honest.
But yeah, that was a real screw-up in my history.

Hibino:
Are you okay? Or...

Kuuko:
They really yelled at me on that one.
But you know something ,
There are lot s of ways to deal with that stuff more ways to xxx.

Hibino:
My goodness. You haven't changed.

Kuuko:
Anyway, I saw it!

Hibino:
What? You saw what?

Kuuko:
A big scarecrow monster!



Utao:
My shoulders hurt.

Kyohei:
Do something about that clumsiness of yours!

Utao:
Okay. Concentrate...

Shingo:
Huh?
What was that sound I heard just now?
Are you all right?

Utao:
I-It's nothing! I just tripped, that's all. Uh, really...

Shingo:
But the whole house shook.

Utao:
But I...
D-Did you need something?

Shingo:
Oh, yeah.
Would you mind helping me in the store for a bit?

Utao:
Sure, I'll be right there, okay?

Shingo:
Thank you.

Utao:
(sigh)



Kuuko:
The slave who was with me said he didn't see the scarecrow monster.
He was passed out the entire time.

Kyohei:
I'm sorry but, weren't you unconscious as well?
Could you just have dreamed it at all?

Kuuko:
I thought of that, too.
But if someone did come and save me, why not call in to report the fire?
It just doesn't make any logical sense to me.

Kyohei:
Um... I guess so.

Kuuko:
Ah!

Kyohei, Hibino:
Hm?

Kyosuke:
Hmm?

Kuuko:
Kyosuke!

Kyosuke:
Oh, it's you.

Kyohei:
They're on a first name basis.

Hibino:
An old boyfriend, maybe? It's possible.

Kyosuke:
How many times have I told you before, call me "Father."

Kyohei:
So they're father and daughter, huh?

Kyohei, Hibino:
Father and daughter!

Kuuko:
Father, my ass. Stupid Kyosuke.
What are you doing at school?

Kyosuke:
I'm sure you can guess.

Kuuko:
Yeah.... The explosion, huh?

Kyosuke:
D-Don't "yeah" me, young lady!
It's a huge pain in the ass when you do!
Why does a detective's daughter have to be such a delinquent?
Consider your father's position for once!

Kuuko:
Father, huh?
Let's go. We're wasting time here.

Kyosuke:
Hey, you're...

Kyohei:
D-Did you need something?



Hibino:
He offered to take us back by car.
Shouldn't we have taken him up on it?

Kyohei:
He's a detective.
I don't want him figuring out anything about us because it could be dangerous.
From now on, you and I have to be much more careful.

Hibino:
Aren't you worrying too much?
It's mean, but I don't think you're being careful.
You're being...

Kyohei:
Cowardly?
When you're dealing with something like kakashi, that's for the best.

Hibino:
Kuga-kun, do you really wanna be a Seki again?
Is that what you want?
When you were giving Utao-chan lessons, it felt like you wanted to control the kakashi yourself.

Kyohei:
(sigh)
I really don't want anything to do with them.
Not with the kakashi... Or with the village.

Hibino:
Or Utao-chan?

Kyohei:
Hmm...
I just... I just hope she doesn't get hurt is all.
The power of the kakashi brings disaster, regardless of what you want.

Hibino:
Did something like that ever happen to you, Kuga-kun?

Kyohei:
An uncontrollable power should no be used.
It brings misery both to the person who uses it, and to those it is used upon.
I don't want that to happen to Utao.



Hibino:
We're back!

Utao:
Welcome home, guys.

Kyohei:
What's with that outfit?

Utao:
I was helping in Hibino's place.

Shingo:
She helped out when we were busy at lunch time.
And she was surprisingly popular, so I had to keep her doing it.

Kyohei:
Did you get any orders wrong?
How many plates did you break?

Utao:
I didn't get any wrong, and I didn't break any plates!

Shingo:
Only a couple, that is.

Kyohei:
How about it?
Why don't we put you in a real maid uniform, instead of that thing?
You'll be popular.

Utao:
No!

Hibino:
Yes, that's true. She'd look beautiful.
Hey, why not come shopping with me tomorrow?

Utao:
No! Never! Never!



Hibino:
Hey, Dad.

Shingo:
Mm-hm?

Hibino:
Do you know what happened to Kuga-kun in the past?

Shingo:
No, not really.
Since I came here, I've almost had no contact with the village.
If something comes up, they contact me. But I don't know what goes on there.

Hibino:
Hmm...

Shingo:
Did something happen?

Hibino:
No, not really.

He had a mysterious look to his eyes...

Aw, jeez!

Shingo:
What's the matter?



Kyohei:
Utao?
Not here?
Hey, how many years has it been?
Do you even remember anymore?
Well, you think Utao will be a good Seki?
Hm?

Utao:
You can't really see the stars here.
That's true... If Kyohei's here, then that's enough for me.

Kyohei:
Aki! Aki!

Cowardly or not... Pathetic or not...
I don't wanna see a lot of people die.
