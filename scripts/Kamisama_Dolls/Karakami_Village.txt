  Hitomi:
At this age, they really do grow up fast, when you aren't looking...

Utao:
It really is quiet here.
It's different than the city.
As if time were stopped.

Mom...

Hitomi:
Hm?

Utao:
I'm back.



Yasuyuki:
You look well.

Kyohei:
I am.
But about that kid...

Yasuyuki:
Hmm...
I wish I could, but I can't give you any answers.
Actually, I don't know myself.
I wasn't there when Hitomi gave birth to Utao.
And Hitomi lost her memory of it, due to the shock from the difficult birth.
If you really want to know, ask my father and the others present.

Kyohei:
Are you telling me you don't wanna know about the truth?!

Yasuyuki:
Hmm...
To know the truth, it will only be something quite terrible.
It's my brother and father's problem. It's not mine.

Kyohei:
We're talking about your own child here!
Are you gonna run from this?

Yasuyuki:
You ran away leaving everything up to Utao.
Who are you to talk?



Kyohei:
Damn it, damn it, damn it to hell!
Damn that old man!
And he calls himself a parent?!

Hitomi:
Stop right there! What's wrong with you, Kyohei?
How dare you speak of your father that way?
Hold your tongue.

Kyohei:
Uh, okay.

Hitomi:
You haven't changed...
Oh, right. I have a message from Somaki-san.
She wanted you to see her, as soon as you arrived.

Utao:
Ah!

Kyohei:
Fine. Okay.



Moyako:
You morons!
Treating our precious Kakashi like that!
Is that any way to treat a god?
So says my grandfather.
Well, what do you have to say to him?
Huh? What was that?
Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm...
A fight between kakashi?! Are you kidding?
There are limits!
Kids these days! This new generation is just terrible.
Well, so Grandpa says.

Kyohei:
Hey, you just hold on a minute.
Huga attacked us in the first place...
And then...

Moyako:
Mm-hm...
You're a grown-up now. Don't make excuses! It's pathetic...
Don't you have any balls, young man? Young man balls?
Hm? Why are you blushing?

Kyohei:
Moyako, you're an adult now, too.
So you might need to edit his remarks a little bit.

Hibino:
I think I see why Utao-chan wanted to avoid her.

Kyohei:
Well, to be honest with you, it's not Moyako she doesn't like.

Yurako:
Sister! I heard Utao-sama's back! Yay!
Utao-sama! You're finally back!
I was so lonely...
What's wrong?
You're unusually resistant today. What's the matter?
Going through a rebellious phase now, are you?
So what? If you're back, did you catch Aki, huh? Did ya?
Oh, no?
Well, I don't care.
Hey, do you wanna stay over tonight? Huh?

Hibino:
Hey, you! Enough!
She doesn't like that, okay? Just leave her alone!

Yurako:
What's your problem? And who are you, anyway?

Hibino:
That doesn't matter. Just stop it, would you?

Yurako:
Shut up!
I won't let you come between Utao-sama and me!

Hibino:
Just let go of her hand!

Yurako:
I won't!
Kyohei, who is this, anyway?!

Kyohei:
Well, she's just a girl I'm staying with.

Moyako:
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Stop screwing around! Get Kukuri and come to the workshop!
What are you doing standing there? Come on!



Kyohei:
Oh, all right.
I haven't introduced you yet.
This is Somaki Moyako and her sister, Yurako-chan.
And that's the head of the Utsuwashi.
So, Moyako, how long do you think it'll take to repair?

Moyako:
Let me see... Including the breaking-in, my best-guess estimate is about two to three days.
Hmm... The blade's still okay.
That's good. Real good.

Kyohei:
Right.

Hibino:
Kuga-kun, what is that?

Kyohei:
Hm?

Moyako:
Huh?

Kyohei:
Takemikazuchi!

Moyako:
I guess, since they were Hyuga, you really let loose.
[xxx] hate to do battle with you guys.
It's in bad shape all around, so it will take time...
Wish I could give a better diagnosis.

Yurako:
xxx give me a hug.

Utao:
I'm sorry.

Moyako:
Huh?

Yurako:
It's not Utao-sama's fault.
It's Hyuga's fault!

Moyako:
Silence.
It's our policy to not side with anyone.
All we do is simply take care of the kakashi.

Kyohei:
Hey, did you meet this one's Seki?

Moyako:
No. Koushiro brought it in.

Kyohei:
I see.

Moyako:
It is strange...
Takemikazuchi hasn't had a Seki for a long time.
Kyohei, do you know something?

Kyohei:
No...

Moyako:
Hmm...
For them to not tell us, the Utsuwashi, anything...
What are they thinking?
What is it?

Kyohei:
Nothing.
I was just thinking that you're really acting like the next family head.
When you were in high school, you didn't know what you were going to do.

Moyako:
Of course I am.
My grandfather is exactly the same way.
And Yurako's just recently entered high school.

Kyohei:
I see...

Hibino:
They really are wooden mechanical contraptions.
But how?

Moyako:
And it's all thanks to the Kamu no Chi.

Hibino:
Kamu no Chi?

Moyako:
Yes. The Kamu no Chi, the gods' blood.
It's a combination of special resins.
You place carefully selected wood in a tub of it, over several days, to completely soak in.
Then you dry it in the shade for several more days, to allow the liquid to evaporate.
The Kamu no Chi is able to respond to a person's mind.
By allowing it to permeate the wood, it becomes the kakashi's blood and nerves.
The Seki uses the Kamu no Chi's power as a medium, that allows them to control their kakashi.

Yurako:
You're kinda different from before.

Moyako:
The trees we use grow on the mountain behind our house.
Wanna see?

Hibino:
Is that all right?

Moyako:
It's fine.

Kyohei:
No, really?
It's okay. I think I'll pass.

Hibino:
Really? Why?

Moyako:
I swear you're still such a wimp...

Kyohei:
Huh...

Moyako:
Kyohei. Did you see Aki?

Kyohei:
Yeah... I did. He hasn't changed, not even a little bit.

Moyako:
I see...



Hibino:
Wow! There are so many trees!
It's like all the branches are taking each other's hands.

Moyako:
They are.
From what we've been able to determine, that's how they speak with one another.
In modern terms, I guess this forest is like its own internet.
And those lucky ones whose psychic waves connect most easily with these trees are chosen as Seki.
And once we're in here, we're part of the network.
It's like everything on earth has its own special relationship.
Right now, we're connected with this forest.

Hibino:
Is that really possible?

Moyako:
Sure it is. I'll prove it to you.
Once you know the trick, you can actually tell what other people here are thinking about.

Hibino:
Huh?

Moyako:
Kyohei didn't want to come here, did he?

Hibino:
Ah!

Moyako:
I see...
You didn't seem too put off by it.

Hibino:
No! Stop it! Stop it!

Moyako:
I don't think plugging your ears will help.
Okay, sorry.
You don't seem like a bad person after all.
Well, let's go back!

Hm? Ah!
What?! What's wrong?!
Did I upset you?
I'm sorry.

Hibino:
No...
=====14:09
That's not it.

Moyako:
Really, I-I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

Hibino:
That scene... It was so pretty.
And it's so... so sad...



Kiyokata:
You have failed, Utao.

Utao:
I'm sorry, Grandpa... Master.

Kiyokata:
Enough.
More importantly, you wish to ask me something, right?

Utao:
Yes.

Kiyokata:
Mmm...
I'm told his name is Kirio... Your brother.

Utao:
Brother?

Kiyokata:
I was going to tell you when you were older.
He was taken by the Hyuga clan at birth, and raised in secret.
There are a number of reasons for it...
Reasons you aren't aware of.
It is but an old story now.
However, he is, without doubt, your younger twin brother.
Another you... as it were.
Now that you know, you are excused.

Utao:
Yes.
Um, may I tell this... tell this to my brother?

Kiyokata:
You're an adult now.
Do as you like if you're willing to take responsibility.

Utao:
Right! Ugrh...

Kiyokata:
Are you okay?

Utao:
Uh-huh, yeah.
Goodbye!

Kiyokata:
Mmm.



Koushiro:
Okay, we're back.

Kii-chan:
Welcome home.
Oh, my... You have a cute little guest!
Welcome!

Koushiro:
xxx my wife, Kii-chan.
This is Kirio.
Sorry, but we'll be taking care of him for a while.

Kii-chan:
That's fine, but...
He's not some secret child of yours, is he?

Koushiro:
Don't be stupid.
Kirio, go take a bath. We'll eat soon.
Hm? I see.
That's why you wanted to be so private about taking a bath in Tokyo.
I'll make some good food. Get in.

Kirio:
I'm mad, Utao.
I get so mad when I see your stupid face.
We're supposed to be the same.
Why is it only you...?

Koushiro:
Eat up! What are you waiting for? You're my partner now.
Eat up and get your energy, so you can save my bacon when I need you.



Utao:
Kirio's his name... I can't believe...
I'm a big sister.



Hibino:
Two days later, Utao-chan's Kukuri was repaired, and our time in Karakami Village was coming to an end.

Moyako:
Hey! You haven't flown it in a while, so your timing is just a little bit off!
You don't need to rush. Take your time!
Just follow the steps to break it in.
Okay! Start with level flight, then ascend. Now descend.
Accelerate. Decelerate.
Circle right. Circle left.

Kyohei:
Wow, it looks it's stabilized at last.

Hibino:
Here you go, sir.

Moyako:
Um, this isn't a picnic for your information.

All right! That's it for flight tests.
Let's work on the right arm!
11! 12! 13! 14!
What are you doing? Stronger!
You're not transferring any power to Kukuri!
All right. What is up with your posture?
You need to open your legs and push!
Clench your butt, and transfer your energy to your crotch!
Geez, doesn't she understand anything?
Here. It's right here. Tense your muscles right here.

Kyohei:
Moyako... You're taking it too far, idiot!

Moyako:
How to act like a big sister? To a bratty younger sibling?

Utao:
Yeah.

Kyohei:
I wonder what they're discussing.

Moyako:
Let me see...
The fastest way would be to punch them.
Maybe a leg split?

Hibino:
Oh, come to think of it, where is Yurako-chan?

Moyako:
Things get harder when she's here, so I left her behind.

Yurako:
Utao-sama...

Utao:
Punch to the xxx
He'd punch me instead.
Isn't there a more peaceful way?

Moyako:
Peaceful way? Peaceful way, huh?
Hmm...

Utao:
How about you, Hibino?

Hibino:
Well, I'm an only child, so...
But you could try smiling at him when things are safe, right?
Like you're about to give him a big hug.
Showing him you're an older sister who can handle herself.

Moyako:
What? Won't that just make him more bratty?
You need to crush them totally, so they don't get any ideas later!
Never show them an ounce of mercy, you got it?
But why are you asking about this now?

Utao:
Oh, I don't know... No-No reason...



Hibino:
So I guess that was all their repairs, huh?

Kyohei:
Yeah. Now we can finally go back.

Hibino:
I wouldn't mind staying a little longer, actually.

Kyohei:
Um...

Utao:
Hey, let's fly home, okay?

Kyohei:
Uh, sure... But I guess...
But Hibino-san...

Hibino:
Hm?
Slower! Slower please!
Don't! Slower down please!
We're going too fast! And too high.
Can you fly lower? Just a little lower? Come on!

Kyohei:
Then there's no real point in flying.

Utao:
It feels good, doesn't it?

Hibino:
Good?
Uh, yeah, yes it does.
Once you got used to it...

Kyohei:
Don't look down.

Hibino:
You guys are a little weird after all.
I hate this!

Utao:
But it's so much fine...

Hibino:
Aah!

Kyohei:
Hibino-san!
I'm sorry...

Hibino:
Where's Utao-chan?

Utao:
Further down!

Hibino:
Utao-chan! Utao-chan!
xxx Don't. Just grab on!
Don't pull...
This stunt pulling on...
This stunt pulling on my clothes!

Kyohei:
Hibino-san, don't struggle...

Hibino:
xxx
What do you want to do?!

Kyohei:
What do I have left to do?
But there's nothing else for me to grab...

Hibino:
It's no good... I'm gonna fall!

Kyohei:
Utao, lower Kukuri to the ground now!

Utao:
R-Right!

Kyohei:
Idiot! Wrong direction! The ground is toward Kukuri's head!
Quickly! Hibino-san's at her limit! Hurry!

Utao:
Right!

Kyohei:
That was horrible...
We are sorry. Both brother and sister are very sorry for what they did!
Very sorry!

Hibino:
After all this time, you know..., I guess..., I'm kinda used to it.



Kyohei:
Hmm?
You're going out now, Hibino-san?

Hibino:
Yeah, if we're leaving tomorrow...

Kyohei:
Uh, I'll go with you.

Hibino:
Mm-hm.

Woman:
I've never seen them before.

Man:
That's Kyohei-san, of the Kuga-sama household.

Woman:
Oh, didn't he leave?

Man:
I don't know.

Kyohei:
Your father never told you about any of this?

Hibino:
No, whenever I asked, he always changed the subject.
Eventually, I stopped caring.
But... I'm glad I was able to come.

Kyohei:
It's really raining.

Hibino:
Yeah.

Kyohei:
Did you get wet? Are you okay?
Ah!

Hibino:
Eek!

Kyohei:
I-I'm sorry!

Hibino:
What do we do now?

Kyohei:
Looks like it'll clear up quickly. Let's just wait.
Here you go. Put it on. I don't think it's that wet, really.

Hibino:
Thanks a lot.

Hey, uh, Kuga-kun.
What happened with Aki-san, I mean?

Kyohei:
Well...

Hibino:
I think I'm involved enough that I can ask about such a dangerous man.
Who was that sensei he mentioned?
What was that sensei's relationship to you and Aki-san?

Kyohei:
It's been a long time since then.
But... none of the things making up this village have changed at all.
It was six years ago.
It was six long years ago.
