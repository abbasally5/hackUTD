  Kyohei:
Takemikazuchi?

Hibino:
Ah, Utao-chan!

Kyohei:
No, it's not!
Who the hell is that?

Utao:
Kyohei!

Hibino:
Utao-chan?!

Kyohei:
Who the hell are you?

Kirio:
That's not very nice of you to say.
My dear big brother.

Kyohei:
W-What?
What did you just say?

Utao:
And get away from my brother!
And you two stop being so close!

Kyohei:
No, I...
O-Okay, okay. But who is he?

Utao:
I don't know either.



Koushiro:
Wow.
Those kids are really going at it...
That's some real damage they're doing.
Damn it.
Stupid kids, this isn't some playground.
Can't you think of the guy who has to pick up after you?

Kyosuke:
Urgh!

Man:
What the heck is that thing?!

Kyosuke:
What the hell is that?!

Kyohei:
What are you doing? Hide it!
Don't bring it out, on a big road like this!

Kyosuke:
Hey, that's... that's the witness to that massacre.
Why is he here?

Utao:
Kukuri!

Kyohei:
You idiot! Just calm down!

Kirio:
You really think you can get away?

Hibino:
Is he related to Utao-chan?

Kyohei:
I can't tell. I couldn't say right now.

Utao:
Kyohei...

Kyohei:
Even Kukuri can't keep taking hits from that lightning like that.

Utao:
Oh, right! I've got a weapon, too!

Kyohei:
You, dummy! The knife's on the right!

Utao:
Um...

Hibino:
Your chopstick hand.

Utao:
Here!

Kyohei:
But even so, our only weapon is a knife.
He's got that lightening he can use from range, and that big arm for up close.

Utao:
I have a range attack, too.
That eye blast...

Kyohei:
That would take too long for you to use right now.
He won't wait for it.
That's why we're trying to sneak up on him.
Can you see him, Utao?

Utao:
Just shut up!
Concentrate... Concentrate...

Kyohei:
But...
Is he really Utao's twin?
If he's the Seki of Takemikazuchi's, then he is with the Hyuga?

Utao:
Now!

Kirio:
Heh!

Utao:
Ah!

Woman:
Eek!

Man:
I saw some light!

Utao:
Kukuri!

Kyohei:
We don't want people to think we have anything to do with this!

Man:
I heard there was an explosion!

Man:
Are they shooting a TV show?

Hibino:
Kuga-kun?

Kyohei:
Let's keep hiding among these people.
If we can make Kukuri disappear...

Utao:
Kukuri...
[Hide Kukuri that?!]

Kyohei:
Ah, you idiot!

Kirio:
You've gotten pretty good at dodging.
She's...
I was only planning to check her out today.

Kyohei:
Damn it!
Utao, hide Kukuri in the forest!
Quickly! Come on!

Utao:
Kukuri!

Kyohei:
Utao!
It's fine to try something crazy, but do a better job, okay?!
Rushing will just get Kukuri destroyed!

Utao:
I... Kukuri destroyed...
Kukuri... Kukuri... But...

Hibino:
What's wrong with you, Kuga-kun?
Don't just yell at her!
Utao-chan's frightened. Can't you see that?!
[Poor] Utao-chan...

Utao:
Kukuri...
I... I... I'm going to destroy Kukuri.
I...

Hibino:
Calm down, okay?
Kukuri's gonna be fine. It'll be all right.

Kyohei:
Huh. Stop crying, okay?
Remember, you're Kukuri's Seki.
You're the one who decides whether it lives or dies.
Calm down. It's all right. We'll hide Kukuri and run away.

Kirio:
Oh, I don't think so.

Kyohei:
What do you think you're doing, little brat?!

Kirio:
Why are you blaming me?
Utao was the one who started it.

Kyohei:
Huh? Did you start it?
Even so, if you're that good, you could have held back a little bit, you know!

Kirio:
I don't think it's my fault.
Your little toy was getting broken so easily.
Utao... You're not cut out to be a Seki, are you?

Kyohei:
No one's asking you.
In any case, we lost. Aren't you satisfied?

Kirio:
No, not by a long shot. I only meant to tease her today.
But I changed my mind.

Kyohei:
Utao! Hide Kukuri now!

Kirio:
Too late.

Kyohei:
No! Don't!

Hibino, Kyohei:
Urgh!

Kirio:
Ha ha ha ha...
What is it? It's absorbing it?
No way! I don't...


Man1:
xxx

Man2:
Let's go see!

Kyosuke:
What the hell's going on?

Kyohei:
What happened? We win?

Hibino:
Amazing, Utao-chan!

Utao:
Did I... Did I do that?

Kirio:
Take... Takemikazuchi... Are you...

Kyohei:
Now, now will you tell us?
So are you really, really Utao's... I mean, My...

Koushiro:
Heads up, kids!

Kyohei:
Koushiro!
What are you doing here?

Koushiro:
Look at you... You're pathetic.
Do I have to remind you that we're here to catch Aki?
You started out playing with her.
And then you got angry and then you lost control what you were doing like you were some novice.
You're just like them. You always lose your head.

Kyohei:
Koushiro... Is that kid really my...?



Hibino:
And when you pull it... Huh, I see.
So inside, it's like an old automaton.
The technology must have been really advanced, for the time.
But the outside's only wood, isn't it?
But it was really flexible, right?
And how does it hear you or fly?
I still don't understand how it can hear you or fly, you know?

Utao:
I don't know.

Hibino:
It's okay. It's okay. It'll be fixed.
That's why Kuga-kun is on the phone right now, okay?

Kyohei:
Don't you understand? What's done is done.
And besides, none of this was just Utao's fault.
And just who the hell is that Hyuga kid, anyway?
You don't know? You seriously expect me to believe that?! Damn it!
Damn it...

Hibino:
Go back home, but...? To the country?

Kyohei:
Yeah. Just for a while though.
The village is the only place that can repair a kakashi.

Hibino:
I see...

Utao:
What about you?

Kyohei:
Don't worry. I'll go, too.



Shingo:
So, I see.
Well, I guess he doesn't have a choice.

Hibino:
He says someone specializes in repairing kakashi?

Shingo:
Oh, Utsuwashi?
But what about school and studies?

Hibino:
It's almost summer break, anyway.
He'll still have to miss some classes, I guess. But...

Shingo:
Well, either way then...
It might be for the best so she can move her kakashi right now.

Hibino:
Huh?

UFO Expert:
Anyone can take a video these days.

Shingo:
We'll just have to play as nothing else could xxx.

UFO Expert:
See? It's visible right here.

Shingo:
If they find out what's really happening, this will be bad for everyone.

Hibino:
Well, anyway...

Shingo:
Mm-hm.

Hibino:
Um, Dad, I... I wanted to ask you...



Utao:
Kyohei, are you mad at me? ...That I broke poor Kukuri?
That we have to go back home now?

Kyohei:
I'm not mad. Not at you, anyway.

Utao:
That boy...

Kyohei:
Huh?

Utao:
That boy... Is he really our...?

Kyohei:
I don't know.
You see, Mom gave birth to you at the main family quarters.
I wasn't there when it happened. Sorry.

Utao:
I'm scared, Kyohei.

Kyohei:
You're a totally different person from the haughty little girl girl who arrived in Tokyo.
And I was thinking you'd actually grown up some...
You must've worked really hard to put on that act.
But in only lasted a night or so.
I'm not gonna fall for your tricks this time.



Kyohei:
Koushiro... Is that kid really my...?

Koushiro:
I'm sorry. I don't have permission to tell you that information.
Come on. Let's go.

Kirio:
Y-Yeah.

Kyohei:
Oh, what the...!
I'm a moron...
I fell for that stupid taunt.
Hibino-san was really freaked out.
Aki... what should we do?

Utao:
I'm sorry.

Kyohei:
Hm? Hibino-san!
Wh-What is it?

Hibino:
Um... Would you let me go to the village with you?



Um, Hibino-san, you can go a little faster.
There's no curves around here.

Hibino:
I've never driven on a mountain road like this before...
I don't know it... I didn't know it would be this deep in the mountains.

Kyohei:
I'm sorry. It's really out in the country.

Kyohei:
No, no, that's not what I meant.

Utao:
In front! In front!

Hibino:
I'm sorry.
Just... Just be quiet.
Let me concentrate on my driving.

Kyohei:
We might be in trouble if an oncoming car shows up.

I-I'm sorry. We'll pull over right away.

Guy:
Huh? Is that you, Kyohei?

Kyohei:
Huh?

Guy:
What are you doing here?
Utao-sama? So you brought her back, eh? Thanks a lot there, man.

Kyohei:
What are you doing?

Guy:
You left the village. It isn't your concern anymore.

Hibino:
A friend of yours?

Kyohei:
Just a classmate from high school.

Hibino:
Utao-chan, you're "Utao-sama" here?
What should I do? Should I call you that while we're in the village or...?

Utao:
No, you can just act normal.

Hibino:
Were you "Kyohei-sama" back then?

Kyohei:
All that stopped the minute I quit being a Seki.

Utao:
I hate being called that.

Hibino:
Seems like it was really rough for you two here, huh.

It's almost like a gate.

Kyohei:
It's the only entrance to the village.
It's really isolated, isn't it?

Hibino:
It's so pretty.
You know, you can almost believe that gods would actually choose to live in a place like this.

Kyohei:
Gods live here, huh?

We're here. This is our village.
Karakami Village.



Sahei:
You're back?
Kirio...
I'm disappointed in you.
You damaged Takemikazuchi, in a pointless battle against the Kuga.
If you can't do what you're asked to, maybe I should lock you up in the storeroom again.
What do you like that?

Kirio:
Give me one more chance.
I'll catch Aki!
So [help, he help...] I will...

Sahei:
You dare address me? Know your place!

Kirio:
Please... Please... Just don't send me back there.

Sahei:
Shut up!

Koushiro:
All right. That's enough.

Sahei:
I'm disciplining him.
I need to teach this naughty child a lesson before his behavior goes too far.

Koushiro
If so, then one hit, bare-handed, should do it.
I don't like watching people go too far.
I'll take him off your hands.
He's gonna be my partner.
The mission to capture Aki is still on, isn't that right?
Then he's still my partner in this gig.

Sahei:
Mmm...

Koushiro:
And...
Something's been bothering me for quite some time now.
You wouldn't have been behind Aki's release now, would you?

Sahei:
Hmph, how stupid.

Koushiro:
Hmph. I see then.
Just I had to ask. I was just wondering.

Sahei:
I raised that child... raised him in secret for twelve years.
Perhaps it's time to part.

Ayame:
Isn't it a bit soon to decide that?

Kirio-sama was fighting his first battle.
He hasn't been a Seki long.
Look how little his sister, Utao-sama, has progressed.
You should be prepared for it to take some time.

Sahei:
Lately, I have become doubtful...
About the event that caused everyone to think those two children were so important.

Ayame:
You mean their being able to communicate with the kakashi from within the womb, while Hitomi-san was pregnant?

Sahei:
This was taken as a sign that they were to be Seki above all other Seki.
I believe that, perhaps, we were hasty in that conclusion.
But either way, we must find a Seki powerful enough to control Amaterasu.
For if we can not control Amaterasu, there surely is no hope left.
