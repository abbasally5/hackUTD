  Man1:
(Yawn)
Honestly, I thought that would be a hell of a lot harder...

Man2:
I guess the legendary murderer was weakened by his extended-stay and solitary confinement.

Man1:
We had this ready, just in case. But we didn't even need it.

Man2:
Be sure to hide that when we get to the tool booth.

Man1:
Yeah, yeah. I know.
Anyway, do you think that it's possible that the shrine left that girl there
because of the discord?
You know, the stuff between both the Kuga and Hyuga families?

Man2:
Don't even talk about that.
We're at the bottom of the totem pole.
We shouldn't get involved in anything... Ugrh!

Man1:
Damn it.
Argh!

Aki:
The Kuga... The Hyuga...
The shrine, the village... None of it matters, right?
Kyohei...
No, it doesn't...



Shingo:
Utao-chan, you don't really need to work that hard.
Take it easy.

Utao:
Okay.

Shingo:
I'm glad she's helping, but this is going to be a long day...

Hibino:
I'm back!

Suou:
Hi, there! Nice to see you!

Hibino:
Wh-What's the matter, Utao-chan?

Suou:
Yo!
You... Are you one of Hibino's relatives?

Utao:
Who's this?

Hibino:
A school friend of mine, Suou-chan.

Suou:
Nice to meet you! So cute! So little!
You're trying really hard, aren't you?

Utao:
Wh-What's wrong with her?

Hibino:
Don't worry about it. That's just how she is.

Utao:
I'm worried!

Suou:
Come on, it's fine. Right, Uta-bo?

Utao:
I'm helping out! Don't bother me!



Utao:
All right. Here you are.
And here you are.
Here.

Suou:
I'm the only one you're being mean to, right?

Utao:
That isn't true.

Hibino:
Utao-chan!
I'll take care of the rest, okay? You can go home.

Utao:
Okay!

Suou:
Wait, wait, wait! Where are you going?
You don't need to be in such a hurry now, do you?

Utao:
I have to go. I have to study.

I want to beat Mach Dogfight with Kukuri...

Suou:
You can study later!
I've come all this way just to see you.

Utao:
I'm not something for you to stare at.

Suou:
Oh, come on! Hang out a little bit!
I'll let you eat all the cake you want!
Doesn't that sound nice?

Hibino:
Here you go!
Special gateaux chocolate.

Utao:
Wow...

Suou:
Eat up! Eat up!

Utao:
Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.
So good...

Suou:
She looks so happy.
It's nice being a kid, isn't?

Utao:
But, why?

Suou:
If I let down my guard, I start fattening up right here.
Next thing you know, you're beyond saving. At least, sometimes.
You will know sooner than you think.

Hibino:
Now that you mention it... Utao-chan, maybe you have gained some weight.

Shingo:
These are cakes for our new pastry menu.
Would you mind sampling them and telling me what you think?

Utao:
Mm mm mm mm.
Argh!

Shingo:
Utao-chan, what would you like for lunch?

Utao:
Cake!

Shingo:
Hmm...

Utao:
Argh!

Suou:
Aah, I think Uta-bo knows what we're talking about.

Hibino:
She's still growing, so it's okay, right?

Suou:
I don't know.
If you eat whatever you want, thinking kids can't get fat, it's a one-way ticket to fatso land.
Well, want another plate? You don't need to worry about it, right?

Utao:
Thank you for the meal!

Suou:
Aha ha ha.

Hibino:
Oh, Suou-chan...

Shingo:
Utao-chan, I don't suppose you'd like to sample some cake for me?

Hibino:
Daddy, stop it!

Kyohei:
I'm back!
Hey, Utao, I bought that cake you wanted.
What?! What's going on? Come on!

Suou:
You never know what will happen.
I must admit I never expected to find you freeloading at Hibino's place.

Kyohei:
Um... Well, if you don't need anything, I'll be on my way...

Suou:
You're no fun at all! Sit down!

Kyohei:
What's wrong with you?
What I'm trying to say is this.
I'm sure the accident was hard, but it all worked out in the end, right?

Kyohei:
I see. It all worked out, huh?

Suou:
You couldn't have asked for a better chance to get closer, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

Kyohei:
Hmm... What?

Utao:
Hmm...

Kyohei:
What's wrong?
Ugh! Hey!

Suou:
Hey, Kuga-kun.
All the guys in the seminar hate you now, I mean, really hate you.

Kyohei:
Give me a beak.

Suou:
But you have a cute sister with you all the time.
So there is that.
So I guess you can't do much of anything.
Right ever right?

Hibino:
Oh, you three seem to be having a lot of fun.

Utao:
Uh-uh.



Hibino:
Oh, right. Utao-chan!
Tomorrow, I don't have class, so do you wanna come along with me?

Utao:
Really? Can I?

Hibino:
I don't believe Kuga-kun hasn't taken you anywhere, has he?

Utao:
But I need to train...

Hibino:
Hmm... Then just bring Kukuri, okay?
It's fine. Right, Daddy?

Shingo:
What?
No, but... Without Utao-chan, the cafe's sales will...

Hibino:
It'll be fine.

Utao:
I'll go!



Hibino:
We need a wide-open space for Kukuri's training...
Somewhere no one will see it. Let's see, um...
Oh, I know.
Come to think of it, I don't know what's inside Kukuri.
Will... will it be okay in the ocean like that?
Are you saying you hadn't considered it?

Utao:
Well, normal water is usually just fine, but...

Hibino:
Well, then it should be okay, right?

Utao:
There's lots of stuff down there.

Hibino:
So you can see through Kukuri's eyes, huh?

Utao:
Yes. But it's blurry and the water is so murky, I can't see there well.

Hibino:
Hey, Utao-chan.
You're not practicing if you're just moving around.
Why don't you dig something up?

Utao:
That's it. I got it!

Hibino:
Aaaah!

Woman:
What was that?!

Boy:
Wow! Did you see that, Mom?

Man:
An explosion?!

Hibino:
That scared me to death...

Utao:
I wonder if Kyohei can come yet.

Hibino:
He said he'd call after he finished at his part-time job.
Maybe I'll message him, okay?

Utao:
I want a cell phone, too.

Hibino:
You mean he won't buy you one?

Utao:
No.

Hibino:
Well, I don't think you need one for safety. You have Kukuri, right?
But do you even have anyone to message?

Utao:
Yeah, Kyohei!

Hibino:
You see him every day.



Kyohei:
Oh, man. I'm late!
Huh?
Ah!
It's from Hibino-san!
Hm?

Aki:
Hey...



Aki:
Thanks a lot.
Oh, yeah, I should mention this.
When I was standing in that line, someone looked really unhappy when they saw me.

Kyohei:
Of course they did.
You really stink.

Aki:
So I got pissed.
And then two or three of those happy-looking kids got it in the neck.
Eighty-six in both. Ha.

Kyohei:
Go back to the village.

Aki:
After all these years, that's all you have to say to your old friend?
You never came to see me anyway.

Kyohei:
I'm sorry.

Aki:
Don't do that.

Kyohei:
I said...

Aki:
Don't do that!

Kyohei:
Look here.
Don't cause any more problems...
Would you please just go back home?

Aki:
I don't like that.
The way you bow your head like that... it makes you so subservient.
It almost hurts my feelings.
Oh, I know.
That girl with you in the karaoke box... your girlfriend?
Say, what if she just stops breathing?
That's right! Be mad!
Don't pretend you're such a loser.
Don't pretend it never happened!
Because it did happen and you know it did.
This is who you really are. Don't forget it!
Ever since then, you and I have had the same path!

You're not going to answer it?

Kyohei:
Yes?
Hey, Hibino-san. I-I'm sorry I'm running so late.
Yes.
Yeah... that's right.
I understand.

Aki:
So noble all the time, must be trying.

Kyohei:
Go home!

Aki:
Argh!

Koushiro:
Jeez... Aki's such a pain.
Right, Kyohei?

Kyohei:
Koushiro.

Koushiro:
But there's no need to worry about it.
Hyuga's gonna take away that little pain for you once and for all.
Hm? What's this?
That crazy son of a bitch...
He's good at running if nothing else.

Kyohei:
Oh, wait, Koushiro! Wait!
Close your eyes.
Cover your ears.
Don't say a word.
If you plan to return to being a normal person.



Hibino:
He said to go home since he thinks he can't make it.

Utao:
Huh? We can't even meet up with him?

Hibino:
It looks that way. Oh, well...
You wanna get dinner somewhere?
Somewhere he'll be jealous of later on?

Utao:
It's cake!



Man:
Uh? Arh!

Hibino:
Utao-chan!



Hibino:
I guess everything's all right now.
That's your second time rescuing someone.
This time, you saved me, so...
Thank you.
Your god's pretty impressive.

Kirio:
You really have improved.
I'm impressed, Utao.

Hibino:
What's the matter, Utao-chan?
Utao-chan?



Aki:
I didn't expect to see Koushiro... He's a pain to fight against.
They're all really pissing me off. Especially you, Kyohei.
Back then, we opened the gate to hell, and lost all kinds of things that we could never recover in exchange.
And you're going to pretend it never happened. To live a happy life...
You don't deserve it.

Kyohei:
It's just the opposite, Aki.
It's because we sacrificed those things we could never recover.
Right?

Koushiro:
There you are.

Aki:
Koushiro...



Man:
And there we are. Thank you.
I'll deposit your reward in the usual account.
I think the next job will be some time next week.
Is that okay with you?
Oh, I heard something the other day.

Kuuko:
Hm?

Man:
Your father's a detective, huh?

Kuuko:
Yeah, so what?

Man:
Oh, nothing.
But if the daughter of someone paid to uphold the law got involved in an illegal part-time job, what do you suppose the father would think?

Kuuko:
Oh, that's too bad.
My stupid father isn't the type who'd care about that stuff.
He'd rather be just sitting behind the desk somewhere.

Man:
What does that mean?

Kuuko:
Trying to get a pipeline to the police as a backup plan won't work for me here.
Mind your own business.

Man:
I didn't mean that...

Kuuko:
Jeez!
You're too goddamn obvious, fatso!
Huh?
What's that?!

Aki:
Move this!

Kuuko:
Eek!
What is this? It stinks!
It looks different, but it's the same thing...
I know it.
I just know it.

Kirio:
You okay?

Koushiro:
Is this what all you're doing, saving?
I don't need you, kid.

Kirio:
Without my help, you would have lost.

Koushiro:
Like hell, he will beat me.
So where is he?

Kirio:
Lying on the ground, somewhere over there.
Huh? Looks like he ran.

Koushiro:
You're so naive.
You need to grow up, kid.
Learn to finish what you start.

Kuuko:
That's a big great!
