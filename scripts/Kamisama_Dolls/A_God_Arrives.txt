  Kyohei:
Run!

Mahiru:
Eeeek!



Guy:
We now begin the seventh party for the N University Sociology Department!
Oh-hoo!

Woman:
Welcome. For one?

Kyohei:
No, no, um...
Well, I think they're already here. I'll go look.
Sorry.
Ah! Sorry!
Hmm...
Hey, sorry I'm late!

Guy:
It's Kuga! You're late!

Man:
Are you here for the party?

Kyohei:
Yeah...
Sorry, everybody.

Guy1:
Who's that guy?

Guy2:
Today's sacrifice. You know, um...

Girl:
Kuga-kun? He looks pretty serious.

Guy1:
What do you mean?
We're making him do it, even if it's hopeless, right?
Poor kid!

Kyohei:
Hmm... Ah!

Suou:
Can you leave out xxx places?

Hibino:
Are you okay?

Suou:
Huh?

Guy:
Kuga!

Kyohei:
Huh?

Guy:
What are you staring at, man?
Looking at Hibino?

Kyohei:
No, I was...

Guy:
Hey, I heard that Hibino's dad comes from the same village as you.

Kyohei:
Y-Yeah. It's a tiny village.
So everybody helps each other out.
When I came to Tokyo, they helped me to find a room and stuff.
Really nice people.

Guy:
Yeah.
Was it just a coincidence you ended up at the same school?

Kyohei:
Yeah.

Guy:
Hibino's pretty hot!

Guy2:
But her defense is impregnable.

Guy3:
The whole department's been defeated.

Guy:
Man, and so tonight's attacker is you, Bro!

Kyohei:
What? What do you mean by attacker?!

Guy:
At these parties, it's a department rule that you ask someone out.

Guy3;
And you're the only one who hasn't yet.

Guy:
Look, man, she's standing up!
Come on, man!
Go for it. You can do it!

Guy2:
This is a chance, dude.
xxx your loose.

Hibino:
Oh, you too, Kuga-kun?

Kyohei:
Oh, no, I'm... well... you see...
I wanted... to talk to you, really...
Um... that's... I mean...

Hibino:
But, to talk to me? What is it?

Kyohei:
Ah-ha.. that is... oh, come on...
You see, that's...

Suou:
Okay, what are you two doing over here?

Hibino:
You've drunk way too much, Suou-chan.

Suou:
You, shut up, tramp!
I'll decide how much I drink!
It's not your business!

Hibino:
Oh, not yet, Suou-chan! In the toilet!

Kyohei:
No way! Hold on! Hurry!



Kyohei:
Linda, Linda!
Linda, Linda, Linda!
Linda, Linda...

Suou:
Yay, yeah, yeah!

Guy:
So that's the kind of guy he really is?

Guy2:
He got turned down, huh?

Hibino:
But... Suou-chan, didn't you just throw up?
Are you all right?

Kyohei:
Okay, everybody, let's go!

Suou:
You're doing great, Kuga Kyohei!

Kyohei:
I was serious. I guess whatever happens happens.



Yasuyuki:
Going to a university in Tokyo?

Hitomi:
Kyohei, you...

Yasuyuki:
I think it might be for the best.
Now that you've relinquished your rights as a Seki, there's no reason for you to stay here.

Hitomi:
Uh... Darling?

Yasuyuki:
Go and see a bit of the outside world.

Kyohei:
No, Father.
I want to leave this village, where nothing ever changes.

Utao:
Brother!
You're leaving...



Kyohei:
Argh! Hi-Hibino-san?!

Hibino:
You awake?

Kyohei:
Uh... I...

Hibino:
You drank too much and passed out.

Kyohei:
Oh...

Hibino:
I couldn't just leave you here.
They said they wanted you to meet up with them, when you woke up.

Kyohei:
Oh, right...

Hibino:
This makes twice, doesn't it?

Kyohei:
Huh?

Hibino:
When you arrived in Tokyo last year, we had that welcome party at your house, right?

Kyohei:
Oh...

Hibino:
My dad kept you drinking, and you passed out, remember?

Kyohei:
I'm sorry.

Hibino:
Don't worry about it.
Forcing a lightweight like you or anyone else to drink is just wrong.
Anyway, let's go, okay?

Kyohei:
O-Okay.

Hibino:
They said they're at Tsubohachi.

Man1:
I heard they found a body.

Man2:
A murder.
Blood everywhere!

Man3:
All right, everybody, xxx

Man4:
Hey, this area is restricted!

Police man:
Tomorrow, we'll have you come down to the station, to give a statement.
You can go home for today.

Kyohei:
Thank you.
Um...
I'll walk you... to the station, I mean.

Hibino:
Oh, thank you.

Aki:
Hmm....

Hibino:
Thank you for walking with me.

Kyohei:
No problem.
I still can't believe what happened...
Are you okay?

Hibino:
Yeah...
I didn't think you had that kind of nerve, honestly.

Kyohei:
Huh?

Hibino:
You were so calm when you saw it.
Because that wasn't the first time?

Kyohei:
Um... well... I...
Because that wasn't the first time.
Um, sorry to keep you. You should go.

Hibino:
It's fine. I'll see you tomorrow.

Kyohei:
Okay. See you tomorrow.
Um... Hibino-san!

Hibino:
Hmm?

Kyohei:
Uh... Nothing... Just be careful, okay?

Hibino:
Sure. You, too, okay?



Kyohei:
She was so shocked, of course.
But she smiled anyway.
She's much calmer than I am.
Come to think of it, that... that mark...
No way... Were they from my village?
Why? What would they be doing there?
Ah!
What?! Oh, no...
Something's wrong.
What's going on?!
Kukuri, which means... Ah!
Kukuri... which means...
Hmm...

You still haven't figured out how to control it, have you?

Utao:
It's been a long time, hasn't it, Brother?



Utao:
Well, Brother, it's been a while.

Kyohei:
What are you doing here, Utao.
Hmm...

Utao:
Haa... Hm...

Kyohei:
You're really dressed up.
Isn't that a bit much?
Well, it's better than the fake Miko outfit you have to wear at the shrine.
Here you go. Have some cocoa.
You like cocoa, right?

Utao:
Ugh!

Kyohei:
Hmm...
Were you trying to take the cup for me?
Or were you trying to break it on purpose?
Oh, jeez...
So, what's wrong?
Why are you and the kakashi here?
I'm not involved in the village's rules anymore.
And this is supposed to be the village's most closely kept secret.
No one else should see it, right?
What's happened?

Utao:
Aki... escaped.

Kyohei:
Aki?
Then, that's what I saw in the karaoke box...

Utao:
Yeah...

Kyohei:
Why?! They kept him in a cell!

Utao:
Yeah, they did.
He changed last year, after someone in charge of him screwed up.
And told him you'd left.

Kyohei:
Then he escaped because of me?

Aki:
"Because of me?"

Kyohei:
Ah!

Aki:
Isn't it a bit late for that?

Kyohei:
Argh!

Utao:
Kyohei!

Aki:
They're underestimating me.
They sent a little kid to catch me.

Kyohei:
Aki...

Aki:
Yo, Kyohei.
How have you been?
You're an ass, you know that?
So insensitive leaving the village without me.

Utao:
Let Kyohei go!

Aki:
I'm talking to Kyohei. So get lost.
Go sit at the kids' table.

Utao:
Eeek!

Aki:
What the hell do you think you're doing?

Utao:
[You xxx you beg]!

Kyohei:
Stop it, Utao!

Aki:
Guess that's what you get when you just let anyone substitute for a real Seki.
You should know better.

Kyohei:
All right. That's enough, Aki.
This isn't the village.
You can't just start breaking things with your kakashi.

Aki:
You've gotten a little soft around the edges.

Woman:
Kuga-san! What was that noise?! Do you know what time it is?
Hey, Kuga-san! You're in there, right?

Kyohei:
Uh, no! Don't do anything else!

I'm sorry. Yes, um... I'm sorry.

Aki:
Look at you. You've turned into a really boring person.
You used to be much more...

Utao:
Don't be mean to Kyohei

Aki:
Hmm... You want something?

Kyohei:
Just stop it, will you? What are you doing?!

Aki:
Be quiet! I'm getting sick of that single trick of yours.

Utao:
Arh!

Aki:
She's a hard girl to look after, Kyohei.

Kyohei:
Are you okay?

Utao:
D-Don't touch me there!

Kyohei:
Leave her alone! She's just a little kid!

Aki:
No, she's not.
This girl's a Seki, one who shares her heart with a kakashi.
Oh, my god, you're pathetic. You need more training.

Utao:
Argh!

Kyohei:
Utao!

Aki:
Where do you think you're going?

Kyohei:
Aki...! Do you understand what you've done?

Aki:
Whatever I've done?
A powerless Seki attacked me, I had to retaliate.
That's what she gets.

Kyohei:
Why, you...

Aki:
You're angry? Then, why don't you fight me?

Kyohei:
You're insane! You know that, Aki?

Aki:
Hmph, I'm not what's insane, you moron. It's the village.

Kyohei:
Shut up! You... You!

Utao:
Move, Kyohei!

Kyohei:
Uh, Utao!

Utao:
I'll show you!

Kyohei:
Idiot! Don't!



Kyohei:
Huh? Hibino-san?

At Hibino-san... Hibino-san's house?
We couldn't possibly...

Shingo:
Don't worry about it. We have a spare rooms.

Hibino:
We can't abandon you when you're in trouble, can we?

Kyohei:
Y-Yeah... Uh...
No, I mean I'll find a new place for us to live. Don't worry.

Shingo:
But you're not exactly alone, are you?
And I... I got word from the shrine the other day, that I should be looking out for you.
D-Did you say the shrine?

Hibino:
The shrine?



Man1:
We'll take him back.

Man2:
Thanks.
Listen to me, kids. You're gonna need to come with us.

Kyohei:
Hey!

Man2:
The shrine's given their permission.

Man1:
I think it might be best to keep her here for a while.
Well, I guess it's a kind of training, you can say.

Kyohei:
Are you kidding?!
You can't just show up here and start bossing me around!

Man1:
You know that the shrine's orders are absolute.
Go back to your apartment.
People will get suspicious if you're not there.



Kyohei:
So even after I've gone to the city, I'm still their slave.

Aki:
I'm not what's insane. It's the village.

Kyohei:
Aki...



Hibino:
Hey, Dad.
I still don't understand.
You've never told me about the... nothing about the shrine or the village before that I recall.
I can't really take in all of this. It's too much, you know?

Kyohei:
Well, y-you see...

Hibino:
And you said something about the shrine's order regarding Kuga-kun?

Shingo:
All right, I guess.
I wanted to protect you from all of this.
Karakami Village has a treasure they've kept, since far into the distant past.
And Miss... It's here, isn't it? Would you summon it for me?

Utao:
Mm-hm.

Kyohei:
Mm.

Hibino:
W-Wait! Put me down!

Shingo:
H-Hey!

Hibino:
Hey, put me down, right now!

Kyohei:
Hibino-san!

Shingo:
Hibino!

Kyohei:
You, idiot! What are you doing it to Hibino-san?

Hibino:
What is this thing?

Utao:
It's a god.

Hibino:
A-A god? What?



Hibino:
I'm sorry.
I don't have any of my old clothes from when I was little, so...
But it kind of looks like a dress on you.
It's cute!
Anyway, I still can't believe it that you can control something like that.
It's crazy.
That aside, if you're going to stay here, no more tricks like that, okay?
I was really pretty scared!

Utao:
That was a mistake.

Hibino:
Huh?

Utao:
I didn't mean to summon it right there
I kinda pit it.

Hibino:
Oh, okay!
Aw, you...
You know, it's kind of imposing and it takes up a lot of room.

Utao:
Kukuri...

Hibino:
Hmm?

Utao:
Kukuri, this is Hibino.
Hibino, Kukuri.

Hibino:
I see... Kukuri, huh?

Kyohei:
Did Utao get to sleep?

Hibino:
Mm-hm.

Kyohei:
I'm really sorry about all this chaos.

Hibino:
It's fine.
I'm an only child, so it's kind of like having a sister. It's fun.

Kyohei:
I'm glad. That's really good to hear.
Um, well, G-Good night.

Hibino:
Kuga-kun.

Kyohei:
Yeah?

Hibino:
Welcome to your room.

Kyohei:
Uh, thank you.
I really appreciate it.
