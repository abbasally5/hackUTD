  Koushiro:
So there you are.

Aki:
Koushiro...

Koushiro:
Look, Aki. Let me give you some advice.
Come with me.
If the Kuga catch you, you'll spend the rest of your life behind bars.
The Hyuga leader says they'd welcome you.
I can't see any reason for you to refuse.

Aki:
I don't care about Hyuga.

Koushiro:
Huh?

Aki:
How many hundreds of years have you all sat in that tiny village, vying over power?
You have the power of the gods.
Don't you think it's stupid?

Koushiro:
Hmpf. You know, by itself, a kakashi has about as much power as a single tank.
It's not like you can take over the world with just one kakashi.
But you believe it has the power of a god?
You shouldn't take the crap our idiot ancestors told us that seriously...

Aki:
The never missing Uwazutsu.
But never missing means you can predict where it will land.
Once you get the timing down, the thing is actually quite easy to dodge.

Koushiro:
I wonder when you do it, bring Kuramitsuha.



Koushiro:
Really? Easy, huh?
So what now?
Should I simply aim at another point? Is that it?

I never thought moving around the city would be so hard.
It isn't so different from the mountain behind our village.

Aki:
Koushiro's kakashi can instantaneously appear and attack.

Koushiro:
That won't work. Nowhere for you to hide.

I missed again?
I'm not used to this environment.

Aki:
He shouldn't be able to see me. So how's he doing this?
Ah, it stinks!
This is the first time he messed up.
(sniff)
Smell? What?

Koushiro:
He must have fallen somewhere really smelly. Whatever...
Uwazutsu's scent marking won't disappear that easily.

Aki:
Though I have no proof... what should I do?

Kuuko:
Aw, what is this? It stinks!

Koushiro:
Did I get him?

Aki:
Someone interfered? But who?

Kuuko:
It looks different, but it's the same thing...
I know it. I just know it.

Kirio:
You okay?

Koushiro:
Is this what all you're doing, saving?
I don't need you, kid.

Kirio:
Without my help, you would have lost.

Koushiro:
Like hell, he will beat me.
So where is he?

Kirio:
Lying on the ground, somewhere over there.
Huh? Looks like he ran.

Koushiro:
You're so naive.
You need to grow up, kid.
Learn to finish what you start.



Hibino:
We should have expected this, I guess...
The mud mixed with the salt water, it smells terrible.
Utao-chan, use this for the hard-to-reach spots.

Utao:
Okay!

Hibino:
All right.

Utao:
That presence... That was a Seki.
But I've never felt anything like it in the village.
And that feeling...

Hibino:
Um... Utao-chan?

Utao:
Hmm?
I-I'm sorry!

Hibino:
Put it down, okay?!
Hurry!

Utao:
Sorry!
U-Um, I'm really sorry about it...

Hibino:
Oh, it's fine.
We're gonna take one anyway... Time for a bath!



Kyohei:
I'm back.
Hm? Both here, huh?
Utao, you in the bath?

Utao:
Kyohei!

Hibino:
Utao-chan, d-did you say something?

Utao:
You're back?

Kyohei:
Yeah. See you in a bit.

Utao:
Hey, Kyohei!

Kyohei:
Huh? Yeah?

Utao:
I think I encountered a Seki today...

Kyohei:
Koushiro?

Utao:
No.
Why did you bring up Koushiro?

Kyohei:
He's after Aki. Aki ran away again.

Utao:
A-Aki did?

Kyohei:
Utao?

Kyohei:
What's wrong?

Hibino:
Eeeek!



Kyohei:
Haa...
That Seki you saw...

Utao:
Huh?

Kyohei:
If it wasn't Koushiro, that means the Hyuga sent multiple Seki.
Or... that means that...

Utao:
Hm? Or?

Kyohei:
Someone from the Kuga?
Anyway, do me a favor and keep an eye on Hibino-san for me, will ya?

Utao:
Huh?

Kyohei:
Aki saw her with us. And then he threatened me.
And I think he meant it.

Utao:
Don't you think that you shouldn't be watching her yourself?

Kyohei:
I'd live to, but... but given what happened,
I confess that I'd rather not be around her until this settles down.

Utao:
Wait a minute. Didn't you see me naked as well?

Kyohei:
Huh? Are you an idiot?
You're my relative, and you're a kid. That's just creepy.

Utao:
I'm sorry about everything today.
A lot of stuff was bothering me, and I wanted to talk to Kyohei right away.
So... So I just...

Hibino:
Don't worry about it.
It isn't really your fault at all, Utao-chan.
It feels like an assault is only a matter of time away, and it scares me.

Utao:
An assault?

Hibino:
Utao-chan...
This is ridiculously cliche but this is salt.

Utao:
Ugh!



Hibino:
Kuuko! Are you heading home?

Kuuko:
Huh?

Hibino:
Hey, Kuga-kun.

Kyohei:
Hm? Hibino-san!

Hibino:
Have you got a second?

Kyohei:
Uh... Y-Yes.
Thank you.

Woman:
Sure, just leave it there.

Guy1:
Hey, are they really dating?
I mean, come on, bro.

Guy2:
I never expected it would actually work out for him.

Guy1:
But why, dude? He's so boring.

Kyohei:
Um... I'm really sorry about yesterday.

Hibino:
Hey.

Kyohei:
Yes? What?

Hibino:
I just ran into Kuuko.

Kyohei:
Oh, you mean Karahari-san?

Hibino:
And she was saying some weird stuff...
That she'd found someone connected to that scarecrow monster.

Kyohei:
Uh...



Kuuko:
All right. I'm back.
I wanted to interrogate you as soon as possible.
But the deadline for the apologies I had to write, to keep from getting expelled, was today.
Now... Let's get started.



Kyohei:
Someone in this city, with some connection to the kakashi...
There are lots of people like me, who came from the village and know about them.

Hibino:
But if she explicitly said "scarecrow monster", I mean.

Kyohei:
Yeah, I know.
But I think it's a safe bet she meant a Seki.
I hope she hasn't gotten herself into any trouble.

Hibino:
That's why I wanted to go and see.

Kyohei:
In any case, we should be prepared for anything.

Hibino:
Huh?

Kyohei:
I'm gonna call Utao.



Aki:
You're a real pervert.
You kidnapped me and then stripped me.

Kuuko:
What?
I couldn't leave stuff that smelly in my room.

Aki:
This place isn't that different from a dump.

Kuuko:
Shut up!
Let's get to the point, shall we?
Those scarecrow monsters with you guys...
Tell me about them. What are they?
Aliens? Some nation's secret weapon? [xxx]?
I have to know!

Aki:
Scarecrows? Secret weapon?

Kuuko:
You're going to play dumb?
Fine.
I'll make you tell me, no matter what.
You'll soon be crying, begging me to listen to you, and begging me not to kill you.

Aki:
That's an air gun... Ugh!

Kuuko:
But don't worry.
I modified it... to increase the power.
Talk! Talk!

Aki:
What are... What are you after?

Kuuko:
I'm sick of this world.
I tried to get into the paranormal, but that didn't work.
They're all boring fakes, once you really start investigating.
But then I saw it. What was it?
I've never heard of anything like it.
For the first time in ages, I was excited!
It was amazing to see something like that in real life!
And then I met you.
Now tell me. What are they?
Why does something like that exist?
Answer me. Now! Tell me!

Aki:
Jeez.
You're a chatty little bitch, aren't you.



Utao:
Hmm? Seventh, seventh, seventh, seventh...
Hmm...

Kyohei:
She's late.

Utao:
Kyohei! Hibino! Here I am!

Kyohei:
You idiot!
What are you doing? I told you to take the bus!

Utao:
I didn't know how to.

Kyohei:
Just hide that, already.



Aki:
Well, I've shown you, just like you asked.
What do you think?

Kuuko:
What? What the hell is this?

Aki:
Don't know.
But whatever else it may be, it's power.
And it's my power.
Or and I wield it how I like.
That's all I ever needed to know.

Kuuko:
Want to give me some of that power?

Aki:
It isn't like bread that can be cut in two slices.
Give it up.

Kuuko:
I see.
Fine, then. I'll figure out something.



Kyohei:
What's wrong with you? You had a map, right?

Utao:
But...

Kyohei:
Huh?

Hibino:
Kuuko!
What's the matter?

Kuuko:
Hibino!

Aki:
That hurt, damn it.
Hm?

Kyohei:
Ah!

Utao:
Aki!

Kyohei:
Aki...

Aki:
Well, fancy running into you here, Kyohei.
Nice to meet you, miss.
My name is Aki, an old friend of Kyohei here.

Hibino:
This guy's the murderer.

Aki:
Oh, I get it.
Now I understand why you're so obsessed.
She looks a lot like Sensei.
You remember Sensei.

Kyohei:
[Cover up!]

You're still laughing?

Aki:
Oh, Miss!
You see that?
This is his true nature.
He's exactly like me. Exactly...

Kyohei:
Shut up! Shut up!

Aki:
Stop pretending, already.
Later, dude.

Man:
Hey, what's going on out there?
xxx What's all that noise?

Kyohei:
Come on! let's go, Utao!

Kuuko:
You follow them, too!

Man:
Hey, wait a second!
Didn't someone just fall?
Hey, they fell, right?
Should I call someone?
An ambulance? The police?

Hibino:
But, Kuuko, you can't do that...!

Kuuko:
Forget about me.
Don't let him get away.
He's my lead!

Hibino:
Okay!

Kuuko:
Man, I screwed up.

Man:
Hey, don't you need to call someone?

Kuuko:
I should have upped the taser's voltage...
Shut up!
Don't touch me, you perverted NEET.



Kyohei:
Where did he go, Aki?!



Kuuko:
Okay... This might work, after all.
Seems they know him.
If I have to, I can use Hibino.
Uh, I forgot my bra. Whatever...
Ah!

Aki:
It's hard to imagine that someone who ran away would return to it.
Which means that this should be a good hideout.

Kuuko:
Dammit.
I don't know if I'm really lucky or just in trouble.



Kyohei:
Where did he go?
Where is he? Where did he go?!
Aki! Aki!

Aki:
She looks a lot like Sensei.
You remember Sensei.

Chihaya:
Kyohei-kun?
Make sure to stay friends with Aki-kun forever.
Forever and ever.

Forever and ever.

Kyohei:
I can't... I can't, Sensei.

Hibino:
Kuga-kun?
Where are you?

Kyohei:
Oh, damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Where are you?
I screw that bastard!
I'll never forgive him! Never! Not ever!
He... He...
How dare he do that to me...?
Argh! Huh?

Hibino:
You... You'll break your hand.

Kyohei:
Hibino... I... I...

Hibino:
I understand. I understand, okay?

Utao:
Where did he go?
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! So sorry!

Kirio:
That was dangerous, Utao.
You have to be careful.
Hey there, Utao.

Utao:
The same face as mine...
It can't...

Kirio:
I gotta admit that I'm happy I could surprise you.
But I guess it means you didn't hear, after all.
They did a good job of hiding me.
All of them did well.

Utao:
All of them?

Kirio:
All of the Kuga.

Utao:
Who are you?

Kirio:
I'm you, silly. And you're me.
We're each one half, sharing the same blood.
A pair, just like a kakashi and a Seki. I'm your Seki.
What are you doing? You want to fight, in the middle of a city?
Isn't that forbidden? Letting people see it...
Am I right?

Utao:
Shut up!

Kirio:
That was stupid, Utao.
You didn't know what your opponent has, but you rushed in, anyway.
What are you doing, anyway?
Relax. Relax.
Take a deep breath, like this...
I see.
So much is happening, your mind just went blank.
That's really cute, Utao.
I find a kind of charming.
That means that you're worth making fun of.



Hibino:
That should do it...

Kyohei:
I'm sorry to take your handkerchief.

Hibino:
That was scary.

Kyohei:
Huh?

Hibino:
Seeing someone get so angry all of a sudden.
Can you explain...

Kyohei:
I'm sorry, I can't!
I'm sorry...

Hibino:
I see.
Where's Utao-chan? I thought she was with you.
Shouldn't we go look for her?

Kyohei, Hibino:
Argh!

Kyohei:
Kukuri?
This sound...
Takamikazuchi?

Hibino:
Ah, Utao-chan!

Kyohei:
No, it's not!
Who the hell is that?

Utao:
Kyohei!

Hibino:
Utao-chan!

Kyohei:
Who the hell are you?

Kirio:
That's not very nice of you to say.
My dear big brother.

Kyohei:
What?
