Tadasi :
Inspector Tail Messa.
Please wait.
Thank you very much.

Messa :
It's nothing.

Tadasi :
Would you care to join me?




Episode 08 : A Message From Earth



Kazuto :
It's Kazuto.
Hello.
Are you there, Narue?
Huh?

Narue :
I'm sorry, Kazu!

Kazuto :
Uh, well…
I'm kind of early.
So I…

Narue :
No, you're right on time as usual.
But we'll be over at Sis' house today.

Kazuto :
Really?

Narue :
Yeah, they have things like microwaves and dish washers.
Stuff we don't have.

Kazuto :
Oh!

Hello everybody.

Bathyscaphe :
Welcome, Master Kazuto.

Narue :
I'm borrowing your kitchen.

Kanaka :
Hey, old man.
You always come empty-handed when you visit people?

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka, do not be rude to our guest.

Kanaka :
Okay.

Narue :
Thanks for waiting everyone.
I present you my famous carrot cake supreme!

Kazuto :
Amazing!
So, you know how to bake cakes, too?

Narue :
Actually, this is my first.

Kanaka :
I'll go get Daddy.

Narue :
Umm, big sister?

Kanaka :
Huh?

Narue :
Dad's gone out.

Kanaka :
On his day off?
That's strange.

Narue :
Yeah.

Kazuto :
Hmm

Kanaka :
Hmm?

Kazuto :
Thanks for the food!
That's great!

Narue :
I'm so glad.
Pretty good, if I do say so myself.

Kanaka :
It doesn't look like much, but I guess it tastes alright.

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka, if you really like it, you should just say so.

Kanaka :
Okay.

Bathyscaphe :
I have just received a space mail for Miss Narue.

Kazuto :
Huh?

Narue :
Who's it from?

Bathyscaphe :
From the head of Inspector's Department.

Narue :
What!?

Bathyscaphe :
What would you like me to do with it?

Narue :
Will you open it, please?

Bathyscaphe :
Are you sure?

Narue :
Yes, please.

Messa (in Letter) :
A message for Narue Nanase.

Narue :
Inspector!

Kazuto :
Who's that?

Kanaka :
Snort!

Messa (in Letter) :
It may seem sudden, but take a look at this.
Narue, half of your blood is Galaxian.
We have an obligation to educate you correctly.
This is a pamphlet for the new galaxy federation school.
I know you probably not consider a school in space, since you are so fond of Earth.
Please just check it-

Narue :
That's enough!
Turn it off!

I'm sorry, Kazu.
They're just so annoying.
You know?
I've had up to here with them.
They really seem to enjoy constantly reminding me that I'm an alien!

Kazuto :
Narue…

Kanaka :
Narue, do you really dislike being a Galaxian?

Narue :
Well, not exactly!
It's just no one cares that I also have my mother's blood in my veins, too.

Kanaka :
Hey, so what kind of person was your mother anyway?

Narue :
You know?
Kazu asked me that before.
She was a really normal person.
She wrote poems.
She liked to grow flowers.
She really loved watching clouds.

Kanaka :
I bet daddy was a real sucker for a girl like that.

Narue :
Big sister!

Kanaka :
My mother slapped that divorce on him so fast that made him head spin, so he must have been lonely.

Narue :
What!?
She divorced him?
You mean your mom dumped our daddy?

Kanaka :
That's what I hear.

Narue :
I didn't know that.

Kazuto :
Um, Narue.
This sounds private.
Maybe I should go?

Kanaka :
How come?

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka, Master Kazuto is being polite, since this is a family matter.

Kanaka :
Is that so?

Kazuto :
Well, I was wondering if it was okay for me to hear this.

Kanaka :
You're like family, old man.
Don't worry about it.

Kazuto :
F-F-Family!?

Narue :
Big Sister!

Kanaka :
Narue, so how did your mother meet Daddy?

Narue :
I think that she rescued Dad from drowning in a river.

Kanaka :
Drowning!?
What happened?

Narue :
15 years ago, Dad quit his government job.
The Earth had just been discovered at the time, and he was assigned as an investigator.

- In the Past -

A Truck Driver :
So where are you from, young man?

Tadasi :
Oh, I came here from space.

A Truck Driver :
Must've been one hell of a trip.
So, what are you doing out here in the country?

Tadasi :
Just investigating some things.

A Truck Driver :
Well that's very responsible of you.
By the way, what's that do that on your hip?

Tadasi :
Oh, this thing?
It's a very important tool.
I guess you could say it protects me.

A Truck Driver :
Oh, I see.
Well, it sure makes you look important!

Narue :
So Dad continued to investigate various parts of the Earth.

Kanaka :
So then what happened?

Messa :
I am Inspector Tail Messa.
I know this is unexpected, but your mission is complete.
Return immediately.

Tadasi :
What?
But I haven't finished collecting information yet!
So, why do I have to go?

Messa :
At a recent meeting of the Galaxy Federation, we decided to take a nonaggressive and noninterventional stance towards Earth.
Because of this, this mission has been canceled.

Tadasi :
They can't…
Please let me continue my investigation!
There's so much left to learn.
This planet's culture is identical to our own!
We may be able to discover a way to stop the wars!

Messa :
The Galaxy Federation is not a monolithic union.
It was a decision that took into account the opinions of all countries.
At any rate, we thank you for your efforts.

Tadasi :
A gun!
Damn…
He's gonna kill me just because I questioned his orders!?

Messa :
Nanase!

The investigator has fallen into a river.
Send a recovery team, now!
I was too careless…

Tadasi :
Help me!

Kanaka :
He fell into the river because he was afraid the inspector gonna shoot him!?
That's so lame!

Narue :
But that's how he met my mother.

Narumi (Nareu's mother):
Hey, can you hear me?
Are you okay?
So cowboy, where in the world did you drift from?

Tadasi :
Planet Nihon.

Narumi :
What?
Planet?



Eye Catch: The world of Narue (成恵の世界) 08



Kanaka :
So, Dad fall in love with her for rescuing him?
Is that it?

Nareu :
Even Dad isn't that simple minded, big sister.

Tadasi :
Where am I?
My seal case is gone!
Is anybody home?
Hello.
Hello?
Anyone?
So this is an Earthling's room.

Narumi :
That's off limits.
I’d like to keep that private.
Thank you very much.

Tadasi :
Uh

Narumi :
The front door is at the end of the hall.

Tadasi :
Oh, right.

Narumi's mother :
Hello, there.

Tadasi :
Huh?

Narumi's mother :
Are you one of Narumi’s poetry friends?

Tadasi :
No, I'm, uh…

Narumi's mother :
She's not married and she still acts like a student.

Narumi :
Why not come join me?

Tadasi :
So you're the one that helped me I guess?

Narumi :
I was.
You were unconscious on the river bank.

Tadasi :
Oh, t-thank you.

Narumi :
Don't mention it.

Tadasi :
Uh.

Narumi :
But first listen to this.
I work over at an electronics component factory near here, and my boss is so annoying!
He complains about everything!
Pick pick pick pick...
And he complains over and over and over and over and over.
The same darn thing every day!
It's just like a broken record, you know!?
So I told him, "you have the aesthetic eye of a mushroom."
I dont' know why but mushroom has popped into my head.
And then…

Tadasi :
Uh.

Narumi :
But there's more.
Listen to what happened yesterday.
So I got to the office on time as usual but for some reason, my boss...
Oh, I just hate my jobs sometimes but that's normal, I guess.

But what can you do?

Tadasi :
Uh.

Narumi :
Thank a lot.
You're a great listener.

Rei :
So Ran, how did it go?

Ran :
No good. I can't find him at all.
How about your search pod, Rei?

Rei :
The entire mountain is full of life signs.
I can't pinpoint him.
This planet has too many living things.

Ran :
Let's try further upstream.

Rei :
Sounds like a plan.

Narumi's mother :
No need to be shy.
Dig in.

Tadasi :
Uh.

Narumi's mother :
Go ahead.

Tadasi :
Oh, okay.

Narumi :
Before, you said you were looking for something, but do you have any idea where you're going?

Tadasi :
Well, I'm not actually from this planet.
So it's not a matter of where, necessarily.
But allowing me to stay here with you may cause you some problems.
You don't believe me, right?
But I really am an alien, [though/you know].

Narumi :
How nice.
I'm actually a poet.

Eat up, ailen.

Narumi's mother :
Go on.

Narumi :
So what are you looking for on Earth, Tadasi?

Tadasi :
Looking for your secret.

Narumi :
Secret?

Tadasi :
I want to know how a planet that has enough different cultures for 180 planets can still function peacefully.
Back on our worlds, conflicts are abundant, we're always at war.
We generally use robots and other mechanical life forms to do most of the fighting for us, so the casualties are relatively lower, but there is still constant tension.

Narumi :
You shouldn't blame everything on your home world.

Tadasi :
Uh.

Narumi :
I'm sorry, it's not really my place.

Tadasi :
It's ok.

Kanaka :
Wow, dad's pretty brave!
So that's what he said to stay there.

Narue :
He had honest intentions!
He even helped her out in the fields every day.

Kanaka :
Oh, so that's why Dad's hands are so rough.

Narue :
Huh?
They weren't like that before?

Kanaka :
Yeah, he's like a different person now.
Dad's hands used to be so smooth, and it felt so comforting when he held me.

Narue :
Really?

Kanaka :
So, did they end up getting married like that?

Narue :
Actually…

Messa :
Pardon me.
I believe there is a Tadasi Nanase in your care here?
This is an order, Nanase.
You'll return immediately.

Tadasi :
I understand.

Narumi :
But why!?

Tadasi :
It's okay.
I don't want to cause you any more trouble.

Narumi :
No one ever said you were trouble!

And you.
You bark out orders like you own the place, but you're an alien too, right?
Then we get to decide whether or not he gets to stay.
Not you.

Fine.
You decide.
Do what you want, Tadasi.

Tadasi :
Narumi…

Narumi's mother :
Tadasi, doesn't she mean anything to you?

Narumi :
Get in here!

Tadasi :
Narumi!

Messa :
Incredible.

Rei :
We'll go after them.

Ran :
I'll follow them.
Rei, you try and head them off.

Rei :
You got it.

Tadasi :
Narumi!

Narumi :
Quiet!
You put on the seat belt.

Rei :
Ran, is there any way you can just hit the vehicle?

Ran :
I can't.
I'd damage the wildlife.
Not to mention those two in the car.

Rei :
What should we do?

Messa :
Rei Otonashi.
Ran Tendo.
Return at once.

Ran :
Inspector!

Messa :
It will be impossible to do this without disobeying the three directives.
Return at once.

Rei :
Is this okay to leave him?

Messa :
Perhaps this is not a problem that we can involve ourselves in, Rei.

Ran :
But sir, we have our orders.

Messa :
They're old enough to make their own decisions.
Let us see what they do for a while.

Narumi :
That went perfectly!
Listen Tadasi, I think you should stay.

Tadasi :
Why did you do something so reckless?

Narumi :
You know?
You actually listen to me,
I couldn't bear to lose that!

Narue :
And that's when they started to live together.

Kazuto :
That's amazing!
It's just like in the movies!

Kanaka :
Narue, your mom sounds cool.


Bathyscaphe :
Master Tadashi and Miss Narumi are very similar to Master Kazuto and Miss Narue.

Kazuto :
R-Really…?
So then, what about the federation?

Narue :
The Inspection Department gave them a family register and a seal case after a while.

Kanaka :
I see, so the Head Inspector has a nice side to him, too.

Narue :
Yeah, I guess.

Kanaka :
How about it?
You wanna transfer into that new galaxy school?

Narue :
That's completely different subject!

Messa :
How long has it been since your wife passed away?

Tadasi :
Six years.

Messa :
Then isn't it about time?

Tadasi :
Yes, I suppose.
But when I think about my daughter…

Messa :
15 years ago, I disobeyed my superiors, and looked the other way when you wanted to stay.
But even after 15 years, the Galaxy Federation's ruling has not changed at all.
In fact, the situation is even worse now.

Tadasi :
You mean the Avalonians who know of our presence are now taking even more extreme actions?
I regret causing all people such trouble.
I'm sorry.
But then, I may have found out Earth's secret after all.

Messa :
What did you say?

Tadasi :
I am experiencing the answer, to be more precise, Inspector.

Messa :
How do you mean?

Tadasi :
This planet is just full of good people.

Narue :
Today is the day my mother died.
Dad wasn't here because he was visiting her grave.

Kazuto :
Why didn't you go, Narue?

Narue :
Well, I kind of felt bad for Sis.
But I think I was worried over nothing.

Kazuto :
You're family… after all.

Narue :
Um-Hm.



Next Episode :

Narue :
What?
Is it true, big sister?
We can go to the beach for free?
I'll go!
Of course I will!
Alright, let's catch a lot of clams!
I can't wait to have a big clam dinner!
I have to invite Kazu.
