Ran :
Inspector, we have destroyed the Avalon attack ship attempting to enter Earth's orbit.

Rei :
Upon interrogation, the ship's crew identified themselves as the "Earth for Humanity" Federation.

Messa :
Very nice work, Ran Tendo, Rei Otonashi.
You're dismissed.
Get some rest.

Rei :
Um, Inspector Tail Messa?

Messa :
What is it, Rei Otonashi?

Rei :
I have noticed a definite increase in terrorist activity these past few months, sir!

Ran :
It's nothing to worry about.
We've just been working a lot more, Rei.

Rei :
Ran…

The terrorists are demanding that we remove the Nanase family from Earth.
That Nanase Family, they’ve got to go or the invasions will continue!

Messa :
We can not remove them by force.

Rei :
But, sir…

Messa :
There is a countermeasure in the work.

Ran & Rei:
Countermeasure?

Messa :
We shall see what happens.




Episode 06 : The Impact of Love



Rin :
Big brother, it's morning.
Time to get up, ok?

Kazuto :
Yeah?
Owww.
Who are you!?

Rin :
Rise and shine!
Breakfast is waiting downstairs.

Kazuto :
Huh?

Rin :
Gotta get ready for school!
Everyone else is already up, big brother!

Kazuto :
Big brother…?
Morning…

Kazuto's father :
Good morning.

Kazuto' sister :
Well that's a pretty lame [for all] considering you were the last one up.

Kazuto' mother :
Better hurry.

Rin :
Here, breakfast is served.
Eat up.

Kazuto :
Ah, yeah, thanks.
Thank you for the food.

Rin :
Daddy, would you care for another cup of coffee?

Kazuto's father :
No thanks, ok.
Dad's really gotta get going.

Kazuto' sister :
Oh, Rin, I'll take one of those, thanks!

Rin :
Sure!

Kazuto :
Her name is Rin?

Kazuto' mother :
Do you think you're going to be late tonight, honey?

Kazuto's father :
No, I should be back by the normal time.
See you later.

Kazuto' mother :
Take care, dear.

hurry up, you're going to be late!

Kazuto' sister :
Oh my god, you're right!

Kazuto' mother :
Don't forget your lunch.

Kazuto :
huh?

Rin :
Come on, big brother!
Let's get moving!

Kazuto :
Oh, see you later!

Um, who are you, anyway?

Rin :
Isn't it great to be early, big brother?
Hope you don't mind that I woke you up.

Kazuto :
I, well… uh…

Rin :
What's wrong?
Come on.
Let's hurry.
Ok, big brother?

Kazuto :
Sure…

Nareu :
Don't forget that the recyclable garbage goes out today too, sis!

Kanaka :
Yeah, I know!

Nareu :
Sheesh, she never remembers this stuff.

Huh?
Kazu!

Kazuto :
N-Narue!
Narue!

Tadasi :
Good morning, Kazuto.

Kazuto :
G-good morning, sir!

Tadasi :
Oh, aren't you going with Narue this morning?

Kazuto :
Well, I… uh…

Kanaka :
What's up, old man?
Good morning!

Kazuto :
Ah, hi.
Sorry, I gotta go!

Narue!

Kanaka :
Did I miss something?
Huh?
Who are you?

Oh, You're the old man's little sister.
Good morning.

Rin :
Good morning to you, Kanaka.

Kanaka :
What's up with the old man?

Rin :
I think he is angry with Nareu.
They had a fight or something.

A fight?
They sure don't waste any time, do they?

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka!

Rin :
I gotta go!

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka, you're late.

Kanaka :
Oops, See you later!

Yagi :
Good morning.
Huh?
Nanase?

Nareu :
Hi, Yagi…

Yagi :
What's the matter?

Nareu :
Well, I…

Kyoko :
Hi, there.
So when did you and the little alien become such pals, Professor Sci-Fi?

Yagi :
Shut up!

Kyoko :
Scary!

Yuki :
Kyoko!

Kyoko :
huh?

Yuki :
You gotta see this?

Kyoko :
Oh, my…
Ah!

Rin :
Kazu, wait for me!

Kyoko :
Isn't that Nanase's boyfriend?

Aya :
Yeah!
Walking with another girl?

Rin :
What's the matter?
Are you so mad at me?
Oh, you get mad so easily.
You're too cute, big brother.

Kazuto :
Let go of me.
And who the heck are you?
I told you, I don't have a little sister.

Rin :
Big brother, that's so mean.

Kazuto :
Huh?
I'm sorry…

Rin :
Well, let's go then!

Aya :
My my, well, aren't they friendly getting all close like that?

Kyoko :
I guess an alien really does need another eight-legged alien freak to date!

Aya :
And humans should only date other humans!

Yagi :
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

Kyoko :
Please, we're just trying to tell the truth.

Aya & Yuki :
Right?

Kyoko :
An eight-legged alien!

Yuki :
(How) gross!

Yagi :
Nanase!

Nanase.

Narue :
Yagi…

Yagi :
What's wrong with you?
You're not acting like yourself.

Narue :
I don't know… I just feel all hazy, and it's kind of hard to breathe…

Class is gonna start.
We'd better go.

Yagi :
It's okay to skip sometimes.
Ever since I was little…
I remember since I was a little kid, I've always been all alone.
When I came home, no one was there.
So I buried myself in my books.
Most of the books we had were about space, so before I knew it, I'd become totally obsessed with space.
When it got dark, I would always look up at the stars.
To me, space is my sanctuary that relaxes my mind.
That's why I got so mad when you said you were an alien.
I felt as if you were intruding on my private feelings.
But, whether you're an alien or not, I know, my space will always be up there waiting for me.

Narue :
But, why are you telling me all this?

Yagi :
I was just realizing that aliens can get jealous too.

Narue :
Jealous?

Yagi :
Misunderstandings, wrong impressions, and mistakes…
Sometimes, it's all it takes for someone to get jealous, Narue.

Narue :
So, what I'm actually feeling is jealousy?

Yagi :
If there's something really bothering you, I think the best thing to do is to just ask him directly.



Eye Catch: The world of Narue (成恵の世界) 06




Male student 1 :
Wow, so your name is Rin?
You're so cute!

Male student 2 :
Hey, hey, can we be friends?

Male student 3 :
I'm free this Sunday.
Let's go out on a date!

Male student 4 :
Pretty big words from someone with a face like that!

Male student 2 :
Hey Rin, what are your hobbies?

Rin :
I'm new, so I really don't know anything about the school, so please teach me, everyone.

Male student 1 :
Okay!
We'll do anything for you, Rin!

All the male students :
We love you, Rin.
You're our idol.

Yuki :
It's that girl again.

Aya :
She's the clinging one from this morning!

Kyoko :
She shouldn't be all high and mighty just because she thinks she is cute!

Maruo :
Oh!
Rin, my darling!
Would you like any juice or candy?

Aya :
Watch where you're going!

Maruo :
Rin!

Kazuto!
Even if she is your little sister, I'd say, you're a bit sitting too close to OUR Rin!
Slide over, bum.

Kazuto :
Geeze, what did I do to him?

Maruo :
Rin, dearest, here you are.
Let's share us some freaky.

Kyoko :
Hey, bums.
What the hell do you think you guys are doing?

Maruo :
Doing!?
What's the matter?
Do you have some sort of problem with OUR Rin?

Yuki :
So, just because she's kinda cute, you guys are going completely mental!

Aya :
Totally!
You're the worst like idiots.

Students :
What do you mean, idiots?
I'll defend her.
Don't touch her!

Rin :
Boys, everyone!
Please stop fighting!

Maruo :
What are you talk…

Narue :
Who is that girl?

Rin :
Let's go home, big brother.

Narue :
Kazu…

Kanaka :
Narue, hang on!

Narue :
Big sister.

Kanaka :
Narue, you need to listen to me.

Narue :
Let go!
Kanaka, let go of me!
Kazu!

Kanaka :
Not again.

Kazuto :
You know, I could've sworn I just heard Narue's voice.

Stop.

Rin :
What is it, big brother?

Kazuto :
Listen Rin.
You're not really my little sister, isn't that right?

Rin :
I'm sorry.
I guess you must’ve figured it out.

Kazuto :
But then, who?

Rin :
The truth is, I came here from space.

Kazuto :
You’re from space?

Rin :
Yes.
I've watched the Earth for a long time from a starship.
I watched you too, Kazuto.
I know that you're nice and kind to everyone.
I know you weren't shocked when you found out that Narue was an alien.
To be honest, I'm envious of Narue.

Kazuto :
I'm not very nice.
I'm just weak-willed.
I'm nothing special really.
It's wonderful that Narue goes out with me, but I'm always worried whether or not I'm the right guy for her.

Rin :
This is just my opinion…
But people who feel as if they aren't special have more to contribute.
Feelings or frustration or doubt and will to overcome those feelings make you stronger than you could possibly realize.

Kazuto :
You think so?

Narue :
Why did you stop me, Kanaka!?

Bathyscaphe :
Welcome home, girls.

Kanaka :
Bathyscaphe, explain it all to Narue, please.

Narue :
What's going on?

Bathyscaphe :
Since early this morning, I have been detecting several mind control pulses in the immediate area.
When I looked for the origin, I found that it was coming from the girl with Master Kazuto.
She is unmistakably like me.
She is definitely an android.

Narue :
Android?

Bathyscaphe :
We are artificial intelligent mechanical life forms.
Aside from spaceships like myself, there are also androids that do not have a ship body.
They are created only for battle purposes.
She is probably one of the latter.

Narue :
But why would an android go after Kazu!?

Bathyscaphe :
It is still unclear why she would use such a pulse on Master Kazuto.
That is why I thought it important to let you know…

Narue :
Ah, it's that girl.

Rin :
Narue Nanase, please come to the Sakura City Park immediately, or else I will take Kazuto away forever.

Narue :
Forever?
What exactly are you going to do to Kazu!?

Kazu…

Kanaka :
Narue!

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka.

Narue :
Kazu?

Kazuto :
Narue, thank god!

Narue :
All right!
You big faker.
Get away from Kazu, now!

Rin :
You just be quiet and watch.

Kazuto, will you please kiss me?
I want you to kiss me, Kazu.

Kazuto :
Wha-What are you talking about?

Narue :
Leave him be!

Rin :
Now, just be quiet and watch.

Now, please kiss me, Kazu.

Kazuto :
Na-ru-e…

Narue :
Ka-zu…

Rin :
Please just kiss me…

Kazuto :
l-I can't…

Rin :
Now.

Kazuto :
I WON'T!

Rin :
Kazuto, kiss me.
Kiss me.
Kiss me.
Kiss me.
Kiss me.
Kiss me.

Kazuto :
STOP IT!

Rin :
Kiss me.
Kiss me.
Kiss me.
Kiss me.
Kiss me.
Kiss me.
Kiss me.
Kiss me.

Messa (in Rin's recollection) :
If we make the Nanase family return to Planet Nihon, then the terrorists will lose their cause.
If we can make Narue Nanase desire to leave Earth, then our goal can be accomplished.
Kazuto Iizuka is the key to victory.
I'm sure you know already, but we cannot force them to leave.
We also cannot harm them physically either.
Also, Rin Asakura.
There are three rules that you must remember.

Rin (in Rin's recollection) :
Sir.
But inspector, why am I to act as his younger sister?

Messa (in Rin's recollection) :
Because, love has an impact.

Rin (in Rin's recollection) :
Love has an impact?

Messa (in Rin's recollection) :
If you understand, get to work.

Rin (in Rin's recollection) :
Sir.

Kazuto :
What's wrong?

Narue :
Kazu!

Rin (in mind) :
Rule One: Protect yourself.
Rule Two: Obey orders.
Rule Three: Preserve life.

A truck driver :
What the…

Rin :
Drive.

A truck driver :
R-right…

Narue :
K-Kazu!
Are you okay?

Kazuto :
Owww.
Yeah, I'm okay.

Narue :
Who sent you here?

Rin :
I am an android sent by the Inspector's Office to trying to take Kazuto away from you.

Narue :
The Inspector's Office!?
Why would they do that?

Rin :
I'm sorry.
As an android, I can only obey my programming.

Kazuto, the feelings you felt from me were not real.
Through my control, by analyzing a subject psychological profile, I can act the part of ultimate dream girl.

Kazuto :
So, you tricked me?

Rin :
Yes, but while I was able to control so many others with a simple pulse, I can never fully control you.
Kazuto, you're a very special person more than you know.

Ran :
Rin!
You were pretty reckless back there.

Rei :
Yeah.
And, you're all scratched up!

Rin :
I guess I blew the mission.
Sorry.

Rei :
Let's get you home.

Rin :
Kazuto, never doubt your feelings for Nareu.

Kazuto :
Sure.

Narue, I'm sorry.

Narue :
Why are you apologizing, Kazu?
She was sent here by the Head Inspector office to bring me back.
That's all.
So, it's not your fault.

Kazuto :
But, I just…

Narue :
Oh I see!
You must have really fallen in love with that girl, huh!

Kazuto :
No, that's…

Narue :
Oh you're in for it now!
Ok, close your eyes and clench your teeth!

Kazuto :
Okay…

Huh?
What was that just now?

Narue :
Let's go home, Kazu.

Kazuto :
W-wait up, Narue!



Next Episode :

Narue :
It's so hot.
When it's this hot now, what are we gonna do if we really get into summer?

What, sis?
You wanna go to the pool?

Well okay, let's go to the public pool.
It's cheaper.

Next on The World of Narue:
The Pool : Clear Danger

It's a direct hit to your heart.
