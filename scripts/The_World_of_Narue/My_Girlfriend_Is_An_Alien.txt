Girl:
Mystery meat again!
Do you want my milk?

Boy:
I've got bread!



Boy:
Hey, how'd you do on...

Narue:
Wow, these are expensive.
Can you give it to me for half?

Grocer:
You want it for half?
No way!

Narue:
Please, sir.

Grocer:
Huh?



Kazuto:
Huh?
I guess no one took you in, huh little guy?

Narue:
Don't!

Kazuto:
Huh?
(Shrieks.)
...Huh?

Narue:
It... didn't bite you, did it?

Kazuto:
(falteringly) No…

Narue:
That was a dangerous space creature.

Kazuto:
Space creature?

Narue:
Thank God.
I'm glad it didn't hurt you.

Kazuto:
The girl was definitely wearing our school uniform.
It was a rainy day, after school, in front of those old beat-up apartments.
It was the day I met a strange girl for the first time.




Episode 01 : My Girlfriend is an Alien



Maruo:
A strange girl?
A poet!
Kazuto, you are truly a poet!
Even the flowers blush at this 14-year-old enigma, while other kids of this age connect everything they see to love.
The man who takes so little interest in girls is a rare find indeed!
Kazuto walks the otaku's path, but ladies of the world beware!
Finally he has taken an interest in girls!
The sleeper has awakened!
This is a shocking development indeed.

Sooo, you in love with her?

Kazuto:
Shut up, dude!
I just wanted to thank her for helping me with that dog thing, that's all.

Maruo:
(sarcastically) Yeah, sure. Thank her--right.
When their eyes met at last, the flower of love blossomed in their hearts...
(Sighs mockingly and then laughs.)
So, what was the name of this wonderful girl?

Kazuto:
Nanase.
Nanase was the name that was on the bat.

Maruo:
Let's see then... Nanase, Nanase... uh... eureka!
Narue Nanase.
Looks like she's in the same grade as us!
And she's right next door!

Kazuto:
H-Hey, you're right!

Kazuto and Maruo:
Galaxy Federation?

Maruo:
Huh?

Kazuto:
What's that?

Maruo:
She's an invader from outer space!!
It's a bit far-fetched, but perhaps she's masquerading as one of us and secretly planning to enslave humanity, starting with you!
I'll bet you get probed!

Kazuto:
Maybe she's a space pilot!
That's so cool.
Maybe her dad flies around all over space!

Maruo:
Either way, we have to find out.
Just leave everything up to me.

Right... left... right...
Hmm...

Yagi:
Maruo? Oh, it's just you.
What do you want?

Maruo :
Yagi
Don't scare me like that.
Good timing.
Which one is Narue Nanase?

Yagi:
Why, have you been fooled by that wannabe alien, too!?

Maruo :
Huh?

Yagi :
Ugh! Oh, I swear to God.
I'm going to expose her for the fake that she is!
Move it!!

Today...
Today, I'll tell you.
Today is the day.
I'm going to get to the bottom of this!

Maruo:
H-hey, Yagi!

Yuki :
Oh, Kyoko!
That bra is so cute!

Kyoko :
Isn't it though?

Aya :
Do tell, you got a date tonight?

Kyoko :
Oh, who knows?

Aya :
Oh, come on, you can tell us...
Who is he?

Yagi:
Listen, Nanase…
You little…

Kyoko:
Well, well!
Looks like the little sci-fi geek's got a thing for the creepy alien girl!

Aya:
Maybe brainiac here’s got a giant head full of moon rock!

Yuki:
No wonder she's such a weirdo!
I hope it's not catching!

Aya:
She's not even worth it!

Kyoko:
Totally!
You know what they say: Freaks of a feather!

The poor little alien can't even understand our language!

Aya:
Aww… too bad!

Maruo :
Hey, Kazuto. Are you seriously trying to hook up with that girl?

Kazuto :
Yeah.

Maruo :
You know, any girl who can swing a bat like that can't be normal.
Maybe you'll get knocked out too!
Bam!

Kazuto :
I told you, she just did that to protect me from that dog thing.

Maruo :
Very well then.
If you are indeed serious... I'll help!

She's normal.
No matter how you look at her, she's human.
She doesn't appear to have a tail, or horns.
She's just a totally normal human being.

Kazuto :
Fine, whatever--just give me the bat back.

Maruo :
Hey, Kazuto.
Are you sure you wanna go through with this?

Kazuto :
What do you mean?

Maruo :
Since your master plan consists solely of giving her the bat and confessing your love…
Even I, Masaki Maruo, known the world over as Dr. Hunkenstein, the Guru of Love, am at a total loss for words!

Kazuto:
Just shut up and give me the bat.

Maruo:
Very well, the doctor has spoken.
Good luck.
Onwards soldier, I'll expect a full report later.
Go-go, Love Hunter!

Kazuto:
Nanase! Wait up, Nanase!
What the…
Hey, Nanase!

Narue :
Yes, that's me.



Eyecatch: The World of Narue (成恵の世界) 01



Kazuto :
I… uh…

Narue :
What is it?

Kazuto :
T-thank you for yesterday…
Here…
Ummm… I'd like to go for tea.
You know to say thank you.

Narue :
So you are going to give me back my bat, but only if I buy you some tea?

Kazuto :
No, that's not it at all!
It's just... I didn't even get to thank you yesterday when you saved me from that thing.
So I wanted to thank you and go get some tea together if that's all right with you.

Narue :
Uh, with me…?

Kazuto :
Yeah.

Narue :
Some tea…

Kazuto :
Yeah.

Narue :
What's your name?

Kazuto :
Iizuka.
Kazuto Iizuka!

Narue :
Iizuka, even if we go, I'll just be boring.

Kazuto :
T-that's not true.

Narue :
Even if we're poor?

Kazuto :
Yes!

Narue :
Even if I'm gloomy?

Kazuto :
Yes!

Narue :
Even if I like to read women's magazines at the newsstands?

Kazuto :
Ah!
Sure.

Narue :
Even if I'm an alien?

Kazuto :
Uh-mm!
Wait… What!?

Narue :
Then, let's go!
It's too expensive to go out, so let's just go to my place!

Kazuto :
O-okay! I mean… N-Nanase!

Narue :
This is the place where I live.
Sorry I know it's pretty run down.

Kazuto :
No, it's just… This is from… yesterday…
Oh, what the hell was that thing?

Narue :
The stairs are slippery, so be careful.

<Sign> : The Galaxy Federation / Tadashi and Narue Nanase

Kazuto :
The Galaxy Federation
Well, your name plate sure has some character.

What's the matter?
Wha-what?

Narue :
Father!
How many times do I have to tell you?
Don't waste the milk!
Put the rest in a cup and put it in the fridge, OK?

Tadashi :
N-Narue…

Narue :
Oh, father.

Kazuto :
B-b-b-burglar!?

Narue :
A space ninja.

Kazuto :
What!? A s-space ninja!?

Narue :
From the Swan, N System, E uh.

Tadashi :
The Swan, N System… … Avalon alien.

Narue :
The Swan, N System, name abbreviated, Avalon alien!

The Burglar :
I congratulate you for seeing through my trap, yesterday, little Nanase!

Kazuto :
T-this time, I have to protect her!
What do I do?
If I accidentally set the guy off?
But if I don't help Nanase here, then I'll always be a coward!
GAHHHHHH!!

Narue :
Hold it!

The Burglar :
You scared the hell out of me!
You little punk!

Kazuto :
W-why did you stop me, Nanase?

Narue :
'Cause you didn't take off your shoes when you came in.

Kazuto :
Oh, yeah, sorry.

Narue :
Leave this guy to me.

The Burglar :
You wanna go, little Nanase?
Maybe, I'll start by wasting your old man!

YOU DIE! OLD MAN!

Narue :
Father, you know how dangerous it is.
Be careful!

Tadashi :
Sorry about that.
I let my guard down for a second, and look what happened.
Thanks for the help. My heroic savior.
Narue, who is that?

Kazuto :
I-I'm, uh…

Narue :
We have a proper introduction later.
But first, take care of that space ninja, please?

Tadashi :
Oh, Yeah.
Alright, I'll call the Head Inspector.
I'll be right back.

Kazuto :
Y-you're amazing, Nanase.

Narue :
Kazuto, you said before that you didn't mind that I was an alien, right?

Kazuto :
Mm.
Ah, and you like those women's magazines, isn't that right?
Do you think, maybe, I should read them, too?

Narue :
Iizuka, I'm gonna show you something neat!

Kazuto :
Uh?

Narue :
Iizuka, welcome to the world I come from!

Kazuto :
N-Nanase, w-what…

Narue :
Call me by my first name, okay, Kazu?

Kazuto :
Oh, I… ummm…
Narue!

Narue :
Yes, Kazu.

Kazuto :
When I looked up, I saw a small blue Earth, and countless spaceships.
It was an amazing sight.
But I was in awe of something else.
She was a little strange, and she was an alien but I finally had a girlfriend.



Next Episode :

Narue :
Kazu invited me to a movie!

Could this be a date?
What should I do!?

But Yagi decides to crash our date, challenging me to prove I'm an alien!

Next time on The World of Narue,
"The First Date!"

It's a direct hit to your heart!
