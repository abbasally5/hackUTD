Narue :
Oh! Kazu!

Kazuto :
Narue!

Narue :
It sure is hot out.

Kazuto :
Sorry, did you wait long?

Narue :
No, it's okay.
Let's go.

Kazuto :
Yeah.

Narue :
Big sister, sorry to make you wait!
Kazu is here, let's go!




Episode 09 : A Starship in Love



Kanaka :
It's not too crowded at all.

Bathyscaphe :
I picked a nice hideaway.
In the mountains there's a hot spring resort as well.

Kanaka :
Way to go, Bathyscaphe!

Kazuto :
By the way Narue, what are you doing with that?

Narue :
Hunting for shells, of course.
When we get home, I'll cook us some clams, ok?

Kazuto :
I don't think you'll find any clams in a public swimming spot.

Narue :
But this is the ocean!
They have to have clams.
We'll find little neck, and cherry stones...

Kazuto :
You're missing the point.

Narue :
Come on everybody, let's go catch our dinner!

Kanaka :
Oh, forget that!
Go to the grocery store and spend a buck for a change.
Old man, I'm leaving Narue to you.
We'll go do something else.
Come on, Bathyscaphe.

Bathyscaphe :
Oh!
Miss Kanaka!

Kazuto :
But we all came here together.

Narue :
Sorry about that, Kazu.

Bathyscaphe :
Wasn't that a bit rude of you?

Kanaka :
I wanna leave them alone.

Bathyscaphe :
Hm?

Kanaka :
If we're there, well’ll just get in the way.

Bathyscaphe :
I suppose.

Kanaka :
The old man is really great.
He and Narue are perfect for each other.
He really cares about Naure, I don’t think I’ve ever met someone as kind and gentle as he is.

Kazuto (Kanaka's recollect) :
You want to come to the ocean?

Kanaka (Kanaka's recollect) :
Nope, I think I'll pass.

Kazuto (Kanaka's recollect) :
It'll be more fun together!

Kanaka :
I hope they'll be happy together.
And I hope that he'll protect Narue, forever…

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka…

Kanaka :
True Love Forever…
Do you think that's childish?

Bathyscaphe :
Not at all.
I think that's very grown up.

Kanaka :
So, to help them get closer, we'll go do something else!

Bathyscaphe, let's get something to eat!
My treat!

Haruna :
Welcome to the…!

D-Dimensional Escort Ship, B-Bathyscaphe!

Kanaka :
Huh!?
How’d she know?

Bathyscaphe (with telepathy) :
What are you doing here?

Haruna (with telepathy) :
I-I'm managing a sea side cafe.

Bathyscaphe (with telepathy) :
I see.
Good luck with that.

Haruna (with telepathy) :
T-Thank you very much.

Kanaka :
Come on, Bathyscaphe!
What were you talking about with that woman?

Bathyscaphe :
Nothing important.

Kanaka :
But she knows who you are!
Who is she?

Bathyscaphe :
High Speed Escort Ship, Haruna.
She's a starship.

Kanaka :
Huh!?
What is she doing all the way down here?

Bathyscaphe :
Well, I'm here too, so it's not really my place to say.

Kanaka :
Yeah, I suppose.

Haruna :
I'll never return to the army!
If you try to force me to leave my life here…
I'm gonna kill myself!

Kanaka :
You can't kill yourself with that!!

Haruna :
I'm sorry I panicked back there.

Kanaka :
Get a grip!
You call yourself a starship?

Haruna :
I'm sorry.

Kanaka :
I guess it takes all kinds.

Bathyscaphe :
We androids may be mechanical, but we all have our own personalities.

Kanaka :
huh!

Haruna :
I promise I won't cause any trouble.
I beg you, will you please let me go?

Kanaka :
Let you go?
Way did you do something naughty?

Haruna :
Don't pretend you don't know!!
You two came from space to capture me didn't you!?
It's true, isn't it!?

Kanaka :
Oh, listen lady.
We just came here to go swimming, ok?

Haruna :
Huh?
Really?

Bathyscaphe :
I am now retired and working independently of the army.
You can check that fact if you have doubts.

Haruna :
I'm on the run now, so I don't have access to the network anymore.

Kanaka :
Actually, Bathyscaphe has been my caretaker for a while now.
She's not military.
So, case closed.
We getta run.
Good luck with your job!

Haruna :
Goodbye!
Thank you.

Kanaka :
What do you think?

Bathyscaphe :
She doesn't trust us at all.
Her suspicion is maintaining her fears.

Narue :
Still no luck, no clams here.

Kazuto :
Hey, a crab!

Narue :
A crab!?
Too small, Kazu.

Kazuto :
Huh.

Hey, you Narue, wanna rent a boat?

Narue :
It's too much.

Kazuto :
Yeah, but Bathyscaphe brought us here for free after all, so we could use the money that we’re saving.

Narue :
Oh.
Hey
Yeah, maybe if we go towards the rocks we can catch eels and abalone and other yummy treats, Kzau!

Kazuto :
I guess.

Narue :
Well then, let's go get 'em!

Kanaka :
We leave them alone few minutes, and this is what happens.

Bathyscaphe :
The crowd was starting to feel sorry for Master Kazuto.

Kanaka :
Check, where's she?

Bathyscaphe :
She's apparently following us.

Kanaka :
That figures…

Bathyscaphe :
What should we do?

Kanaka :
You think she might be calmer over the restaurant?

Bathyscaphe :
Good idea.

Haruna :
Are they telling the boss my true identity!?
T-That's just low!

Akio :
Oh, welcome back, Haruna.
Hey, look who stop by, your old college mentor.

Bathyscaphe :
It's been a while, Haruna.

Akio :
They came all this way, so why don't you take a break and go relax?

Haruna :
Um, well, I don't…

Kanaka :
Come on, lady!
Let's play!
Let's play!

Here!

Haruna :
Why are you people doing all of this?

Kanaka :
The best way to clear up suspicion is to become friends, right?
I'm Kanaka Nanase!

Haruna :
I'm the High Speed Escort Ship, Haruna!

Bathyscaphe :
Kanaka!

Haruna :
Oh, I'm so sorry!

Kanaka :
I'm okay.

Haruna :
Are you alright…?

Kanaka :
Gotcha!

Haruna :
Oh! Don't do that!

Kanaka :
Here it comes again!
Wow, you're good!

Narue :
Kazu, there's so many fish!
It's so awesome!

Kazuto :
Awesome.
Definitely awesome.

Ah, Narue!
What are you doing?

Narue :
It's so beautiful down there!
There's bound to be some eel or abalone around!
I don't want to lose this in the ocean, so hold this for me, please Kazu?

Kazuto :
Uh, but Narue.

Narue :
Kazu, you wait here.
I'll go catch a whole bunch of fish!

Kazuto :
Huh, Narue…



Eye Catch: The world of Narue (成恵の世界) 09





Haruna :
I just…
I just didn't like being a military ship, and I ran away like a coward.

Bathyscaphe :
Even though war isn’t lull, we aren't hurting for more ships.
I'm sure you could’ve gotten leave if you asked permission.

Haruna :
I guess, but I didn't wanna take the chance that they say no.
So when I knew I couldn’t take it anymore, I ran.
The Earth is so wonderful.
Especially this town.
The ocean, the people, it's a dream come true!
Also, I fell in love.

When I fled to earth, I landed on a deserted beach at night.
When I hid my ship's form, I didn't know what to do.
So I just sat on the beach and stared at the night sea.

Akio :
Good evening.
Care for some?

Haruna :
Thank you very much.

Akio didn't question me at all.
He just sat watching the sea with me.

Kanaka :
Wow, it's cool.

Haruna :
Yes.

He is next in line to inherit a hot spring resort near here.
He only does the beachside restaurant over the summer.
He said the key to customer service is to treat everyone as individuals.
I had nowhere to go, and he gave me a job, and a place to live.
But, if the Boss ever finds out that I'm really an android, this life is over for me.

Kanaka :
It'll be okay.

Haruna :
Huh?

Kanaka :
You're not a toaster or a washing machine, Haruna.
An android is more than just a machine.
You can do almost anything a human can and [that’ sum]!

Right, Bathyscaphe?

Bathyscaphe :
Correct!

Kanaka :
So don't you worry about a thing.
You can be together forever.

Haruna :
Together forever?

Kanaka :
That's right.
Forever.

Haruna :
Thanks, Kanaka.

Bathyscaphe :
Shouldn't you be going back to your job at the restaurant now?

Haruna :
Oh my!
You're so right!

Kanaka :
Say hello to your wonderful boss for us!

Haruna :
Okay!

Kanaka :
See ya!

Haruna :
Thank you very much!

Kazuto :
Are you okay?

Narue :
Yeah, there's just so many down there, I guess got caught up.
I'm sorry, Kazu.

Kazuto :
Narue, I'm fine with it, but the boat on the other hand might not be so forgiving.

Narue :
We'll have a feast tonight!

Haruna :
Hi, I'm back!

Akio :
Welcome back.
Did you have fun?

Haruna :
Yes, I did!
I got lectured by a little girl.
She was a pretty smart kid.

Akio :
That's so like you, Haruna.

An Old man :
Shimada, it's awful!
It's a tsunami!
There was an earthquake off shore.
We gotta get of here or be swallowed by tidal waves!

Kanaka :
What?

Bathyscaphe :
What could that be?

Kazuto :
A siren?

Narue :
I wonder if something happened?

An Old man :
What's that!?
You can't release a warning!?
A system’s down!?

Akio :
Oh no!

An Old man :
The people won't know what's going on with just a siren!
How would they get the safety in time?
This is bad.

Akio :
I'll take care of it.
I'll head down to the beach and warn them all personally.

An Old man :
I'll go too.
I'll go get the megaphone.

Haruna :
Akio…

Kanaka(In Haruna's recollection) :
So don't you worry about a thing.
You can be together forever.

Haruna :
You really gave me hope.
I'm sorry to let it go to waste, Kanaka.

Akio :
Haruna, you'd better go and get the safety!

Haruna :
Boss, I'll go stop this.

Akio :
You can't.
You have to get to a safe place.

Haruna :
This is goodbye.

Akio :
Haruna.
Haruna!

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka, look!

Kanaka :
What… is that!?

Narue…?

Narue :
Kazu, isn't that…

Kazuto :
Looks like a tsunami.

Kazuto & Narue :
A tsunami!?

Narue :
Kazu, the connector!!
Kazu, come back!

Kanaka :
Narue!

Bathyscaphe :
I'll go get them!

Kanaka :
It's horrible.
We will… he's going to die.
No… NO!

Haruna

Haruna :
Tsunami output power calculations completed!
Release Inertial Canceller limit!
Surf Vector Drive, engaging!!

Kanaka :
She destroyed… the tsunami?

Man :
It's amazing.

Kanaka :
Haruna.

Narue :
Kazu!

Kazuto :
I feel pretty stupid.
Narue, I'm… I'm sorry I couldn't get this to you.

Bathyscaphe :
Even though master Kazuto may have lost consciousness underwater, he never once let go of your forward connector, Miss Narue.

Narue :
Oh, Kazu.
Thank you.

Akio :
Haruna!
It's you, isn't it?
Look at me!
Answer me!

Haruna :
Akio, you saw it, didn't you?
Now you know, I'm not a human.
So I…

Akio :
So what!
Are you still the woman I love!
I want… I wanna be with you!
I wanna be with you, forever!

Haruna :
Akio!

Akio :
Haruna!

Haruna :
Akio!

Kanaka :
Forever…

A Caster :
According to the National Weather Agency, a massive tsunami was supposed to have touched down in this area, but no one seems to be hurt.
We interviewed some of the locals.

An Old Man :
Tsunami?
What are you talking about?
I think you’ve been dreaming, sonny.
Were you dreaming?

A Woman :
What?
We've been here since yesterday and there's no tsunami.
Sorry to disappoint you, pal.

A Caster :
Well, there you have it.
On a later note, in Tokyo this morning, 20 people were crushed and killed under the wheels of a run-away truck. That's gotta hurt!

Kazuto :
What does this mean?

Narue :
Oh.

Kanaka :
Bathyscaphe, did you do something?

Bathyscaphe :
I do not have the ability to adjust the human memory.

Rin :
That would be me!

Kazuto :
Rin!

Rin :
It's been much too long, everyone!

Kanaka :
Yeah, yeah.
First explain, what's going on?

Rin :
Okay.
Oh maybe, I'll have just one.
I was looking for Haruna for the military, when the incident occurred that afternoon, so I had to adjust the witnesses' memories.
Man! It is really tough adjusting that many memories.

Kanaka :
Whatever, Is Haruna going back to the army?

Rin :
Not now, as long as they know where she is and that she is safe, the army can relax and wait for Haruna to return on her own.

Kanaka :
Oh, that's great!

Bathyscaphe :
Isn't that wonderful?

Kazuto :
Isn't that great, Narue?

Narue :
No, it's not great.

Kazuto :
Huh?

Narue :
Because, we lost all the clams and shell fishes I spent all day catching, Kazu!
What a waste!

Kazuto :
Narue…

Narue :
W-What?
Why are you laughing at me?!
Hey, you're all laughing too much!
Cut it out!!
Miss Kanaka…
Forever… Do you

think that's childish?


Next Episode :

Narue :
Wow, why's that girl dressed like that!?
Hey, isn't that No.4(Yon Gou)?
Kazu, are you listening!?
Kazu, you jerk!
Fine, I can do that too!
