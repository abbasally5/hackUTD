Tadashi :
I'm home, girls.

Kanaka :
I have to ask you.
What the hell is wrong with your educational system in this dumb country?!

Tadashi :
Umm… maybe I'm… in the way?

Maruo :
Can you give me the answer to this problem?

Yagi :
What are you saying?
Do it yourself!

Maruo :
Come on.
Don't be so cold!

Yagi :
If I say no, I mean no.

Maruo :
Sure you say that, but…

Yagi :
Will you shut up and get to work!?

Narue :
We're not getting anywhere!

Yagi :
If you're going to complain, I'm not going to help you!

Narue :
I'm working on it!
Don't leave me, Yagi!

Tadashi :
Oh, what's going on?

Bathyscaphe :
Their mid-term examination is approaching, so naturally everyone is cramming.



Episode 11 : A Private Little Wedding



Yagi :
Wait Maruo!
That page isn't covered on the test!

Maruo :
Are you sure?

Kazuto :
W-Where was it up to?

Yagi :
Weren't you listening to the announcements?

Maruo :
Oh great and powerful Goddess Yagi!
Please impart your wisdom on this lonely soul!

Yagi :
Look, from here to here!
So what aren't you confident in?

Kazuto :
I'm not too confident in my spelling…

Yagi :
Nanase! Do you have a dictionary?

Narue :
Yup!
Ummm…

Kazuto :
Oh, it's okay.
I'll find it.
On the bookshelf, right?

Yagi :
Alright, so everything here will be covered, so pound it in!

Maruo :
What?!
That's almost everything!

Yagi :
Stop complaining!

Maruo :
Yes, ma'am.

Kanaka :
Hajime, don't you have to study too?

Yagi :
If you study regularly, you don't have to cram at the last minute!

Kazuto (In mind) :
My Future Dream?

Kanaka :
Wow, you're really amazing, Hajime.

Yagi :
Yeah!

Narue :
I see, so you don't actually have to cram?

Yagi :
But you aliens have to hurry up to study!!

Iizuka!
Did you find the dictionary?

Kazuto :
Oh! Yeah.
I found it.

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka, may I come in?

Kanaka :
What is it, Bathyscaphe?

Bathyscaphe :
It's a letter from Haruna.

Kanaka :
Haruna…?

Narue, it's a letter from Haruna!

Narue :
Wow, from Haruna?

Haruna (In letter) :
Kanaka, everyone, I hope you are well after the incident.
Thank you for your support during that time.
After the shore season was over, I went to go help at the boss' home, I mean, Akio's home
It's a hot springs inn near the Seaside Cafe.
Please come by with your friends.
I'd like to personally invite you.

Narue :
Hey, sis?
Are you really, really, REALLY sure it's free?

Kanaka :
Oh geez.
How many times do I have to tell you?
We were invited!
We even made sure on the phone, remember?

Narue :
I know, but…

Yagi :
Are you really sure it's okay?
I mean, for us to go along too?
Yeah, It's okay!
It's a gift for helping us study for our tests.

Maruo :
No sweat, you’re quite welcome!

Yagi :
I'm sorry, did you do something?

Kazuto :
By the way, did you warn Haruna ahead of time?

Narue :
About what?

Kazuto :
That Yagi is a UFO and alien freak?

Maruo :
Look, there's a UFO!

Yagi :
Where?
Where's the UFO?
Where Maruo?
Where?
Where is it?
I'll kill you!

Narue :
It'll be fine…

Kanaka :
Haruna isn't stupid enough to give away her identity.

Haruna :
Kanaka!
Kanaka!
Welcome to the Shimada Hot Springs Inn!

Everyone :
Huh?!

Kanaka :
She is that stupid…

Yagi :
Aaaaahhhh!!!!

Old Woman :
Have one.

Maruo :
Huh?
What's the matter?

Yagi :
Can't you see that thing up there?!

Maruo :
What, the cloud?

Yagi :
B-But I saw…

Kanaka :
Haruna, it's a secret!
A secret!

Yagi :
I definitely saw it!
I saw it clearly!
I swear I saw it!!

Haruna :
I just wanted to give you a warm welcome.

Kanaka :
Well, at least someone’s happy.

Haruna :
Well, let's get going.
It's just a quick walk from here.

Kanaka :
Causing lots of [commotions xxxxx/commercial unusual].

Bathyscaphe :
Looks that way.

Akio's Mother :
Welcome!
Thank you for coming to our inn.

Akio :
This is the manager, as well as my mother.

Akio's Mother :
Nice to meet you.
I heard that you really helped out my son down at the Seaside Cafe.
Please, relax and make yourselves at home.

Kazuto :
Thank you for having us, ma'am.

Yagi :
The UFO! Is there a UFO pod around here!?
Well, is there?

Akio's Mother :
Oh my, how energetic.

Haruna :
This is your room.

Maruo :
Wow!

Narue :
The view is incredible!

Yagi :
Mm-hm.

Haruna :
Would you like to eat, or would rather bathe in the hot spring first?

Maruo :
Probably the hot spring.

Kazuto :
Yeah, for me too!

Kanaka :
A bath!

Narue :
I'd like to eat something good!

Yagi :
I wanna photograph UFOs!

Kazuto :
The majority has it.

Narue :
Hey!
But a bath won't fill your stomach!
Quit pushing!

Kazuto :
Er, I've never been in an outside bath before!

Maruo :
Ah, it’s sure heaven, isn't it?
It's very elegant very elegant indeed, my good man.

Kazuto :
Maruo?

Maruo :
Wonder if we can peek somewhere.

Kazuto :
At what?

Maruo :
At the girl's side.

Kazuto :
What!?
B-But I…

Yagi :
Hey!
You dork.

Narue :
Hi there, Kazu!

Yagi :
I bet you were thinking of doing something stupid… again.

Kazuto :
W-Wha…?
The girls can look as much as they want here!?

Maruo :
That's cheating!
The men are supposed to peek!
Come down here this instant and expose yourselves!

Narue & Yagi :
No way!

Maruo :
Damn it!
Just you wait, girls!
I swear, I'll do it!

Narue :
Oh!

Yagi :
Jerk!

Maruo :
H-Hurts… Wha-
What are you- D-Don't!
What are you- D-Don't!
Don't!

Kanaka :
God, he's dumb.

Haruna :
I'll leave your yukata over here.

Akio's Mother :
Haruna, will you go greet the customers, please?

Haruna :
I'm on my way.

Kanaka :
Haruna, she's really doing really well here.

Narue :
Hey, Haruna is going to become the next manager here eventually, right?

Kanaka :
Huh?
Really?

Narue :
Well, she's going to marry Akio, right?
I wonder what the wedding dress will look like.

Bathyscaphe :
We can only hope things are that simple.

Narue :
You mean, they can't?

Bathyscaphe :
I think there are a lot of… issues between them.
Akio is an Earthling, but Haruna…

Narue :
She's not human.

Bathyscaphe :
Uh!

Haruna :
Everyone, please eat up.

Maruo :
Score!

Kazuto :
Thanks for the food!

Kanaka :
Wow!
This is so good!

Maruo :
I've never had such gorgeous cooking before!

Kazuto :
Narue, aren't you going to eat?

Narue :
Huh?
O-Oh, I'm eating.
Everything looks so expensive, I kind of froze up!
Sorry about that!
Delicious!

Kazuto :
Oh?
Which one?

Narue :
This one.
Have some.
Here.
Say "Ah!"

Kazuto :
Ah!
I-I'll eat it myself, thanks.

Narue :
O-Oh, sorry.
Just have it.

Maruo :
Like newlyweds, so sweet!

Kazuto :
What was that?
Cut it out!
[Can you stop] picking on us ever?

Haruna :
Anyone for some seconds?

Kanaka & Yagi :
Seconds please!

Akio's Mother :
How are you enjoying our cooking?

Kazoto & Narue & Maruo & Yagi :
It's totally delicious!

Akio :
I'm glad to hear it.

Akio's Mother :
I'll bring up some drink refills.

Maruo :
Oh, thank you.

Narue :
It's really good.

Yagi :
By the way, when are you two guys going to be getting married?
U-Ummm,
Did I say something inappropriate?

Maruo :
Jack ass!
They're still young!
They should stay swinging singles.
Marrying young.
How old fashioned can you get?

Yagi :
Pardon me for being old fashioned!

Akio :
There are some complications…
We can't have an official wedding.



Eye Catch: The world of Narue (成恵の世界) 11



Akio :
My mother is completely for it, you know.

Haruna :
I know, but the fact that I'm a machine.

Akio :
I told you, I don't care about that.

Haruna :
But I'm perfectly happy with the way things are now, being marry is nice but...

Akio :
Haruna…

Haruna :
I really should go help wash dishes.

Yagi :
I wonder if I said something wrong.
But why's that?
They're perfect together.
If this were sci-fi show, then there's always problems when two people are from different PLANETS, but…

Kazuto (In mind) :
She almost hit the mark.

Narue :
I wonder if maybe it's… just not meant to be…

Kazuto :
T-That's not true, Narue.
Everything's going to be all right.
Don't worry.

Narue :
Kazu?

Yagi :
Why are you getting so worked up about this?

Kazuto :
Huh…
Oh, it's j-just my opinion…

Yagi :
You're right.
They shouldn't have to give up being together because of some stupid complication.
If they are really in love, they should just work the problem out together.

Marue :
And, what is their problem?

Yagi :
I don't know.

Marue :
Ah, of course!

Narue :
Hey!
I have a great idea!
How about if we hold a wedding for them?
Is that… a no?

Maruo :
Now, that sounds like fun…

Yagi :
It's the least that we can do for them.
They really deserve happiness.

Kazuto :
Yeah!
A wedding will be perfected!

Narue :
Let's do it!

Yagi :
Definitely getting worked up.

Maruo :
Definitely.

Narue :
Hey, look at this.
How about using the sheets as a veil?
Maybe we can make a dress…

Yagi :
That's impossible.
They're sheets.
Sheets!
What are you thinking?

Maruo :
True, but it would be nice to have a dress.

Bathyscaphe :
Allow me to come up with something.

Narue :
Really!?

Yagi :
How would you do that?

Bathyscaphe :
Don't worry.
Just leave it to me.

Narue :
Oh, thank you!

Bathyscaphe :
Hm.

Narue :
How should we decorate the room?

Yagi :
With paper!
We make flowers out of tissue paper.

Maruo :
Like the ones at the athletic festival?

Kazuto :
Great idea!
It could really work.

Narue :
Time to Commence Operation: Make-Haruna-A-Bride!

Kazoto & Narue & Maruo & Yagi :
Yeah!

Kazuto :
What else does a bride need?

Narue :
Flowers!
A big bouquet.

Kazuto :
Okay, let's look for some.

Narue :
Yeah!

Maruo :
Well, well, those two are rather excited…

Yagi :
Maruo, you're going to be the priest.

Maruo :
What!?
I wouldn't even know what to say!

Yagi :
Problem.
Now, how does the vows go?

Kanaka, do you know?
Kanaka?

Kanaka :
Well I…
Well I…
I don't think they should have to get married…

Yagi :
Huh?

Kazuto :
I knew finding flowers was going to be hard.

Narue :
Kazu, over here…

Kazuto :
Wow, a greenhouse!

Narue :
But I don't see any flowers.
Is there a florist back in town?

Kazuto :
Even if there is, at this hour…

Narue :
That's true…

Oh, maybe in the mountains!

Kazuto :
Mountains?
But it could be dangerous.
It's pretty dark out too.

Narue :
Kazu, oh, please!

Kazuto :
Let's go!

Narue :
Yeah!

Kazuto :
Hold on a sec.

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka, aren't you going to help?

Kanaka :
Haruna is happy with the things way they are.
I don't think them getting married is any sort of guarantee for happiness.

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka…

Kanaka :
My mom and my dad are, you know?
They weren't happy when they married.

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka!
Of course, they were happy!
You're here as living proof of that!
Their love is what brought you into this world.

Kanaka (In mind):
Bathyscaphe…

Narue :
Kazu!

I really wish we had some ribbons to tie this up with.

Kazuto :
I guess they probably get mad if we cut up the sheets for ribbons, huh?

Narue :
We'll get yelled at if we do that without permission.

Akio's Mother :
What are you doing there, you two?

Kazuto :
M-Miss Manager!

Narue :
Umm, we were just looking for a little ribbon for these flowers.

Akio's Mother :
Of course, the inn would be glad to supply them for you if you need.
However…
Will you tell me what you are all up to?
Your friends have started something as well.
What is this about?

Maruo :
Easy there, pal?
Move and you're soaked.

Akio :
What the...
What are you guys doing!?

Maruo :
Nothing to worry about it.
Right this way.

Akio :
Haruna, is that you…?

Haruna :
Yes, it's me.

Akio :
What is all this…?

Akio's Mother :
Well, you see.
Everyone set this up for you and Haruna.

Akio :
Mother…

Akio's Mother :
I heard the whole story from Narue…
And even if you come from different worlds, the most important thing you should know is that she loves you very much more than anything.

Akio :
Mother…

Haruna :
Miss Manager…
Thank you so much.

Kanaka :
Come on, it's too early to start crying, Haruna.

Haruna :
I guess.

Yagi :
The hall is prepped and ready to go.

Everyone :
Okay!

Maruo :
We are gathered here, in sickness and in health, in hard times…
Uh… line?
Let's skip that part!
(You love her, she loves you, yadda, yadda, yadda!)

Yagi :
Uh, maybe I should’ve gone with the guy at the bus station.

Maruo :
Do you swear?

Akio :
I do.

Haruna :
I do.

Maruo :
Ahem, you may now kiss the bride.

Akio :
Haruna.

Haruna :
Yes, Boss.

Akio :
Y-You… shouldn't call me 'boss' at a time like this…

Haruna :
Oh, right!
Ummm…
I love you, Akio.

Kanaka :
Congratulations!

Maruo :
Congratulations!

Narue :
My Future Dream…
Sixth Grade Group 2, Narue Nanase.
I want to be a bride like my mother.
Everyone says that's boring.
But I don't think that's true.
My mother sacrificed her life to protect me in a car accident.
My mother gave me a future.
That's why I…
That's why…
I want to be a bride like my mother.



Next Episode :

Narue :
Today's the day of the festival.
We're all going to the shrine.

But I'm going ahead to meet with Kazu.

Huh?
What!?
T-this is a…
Time Stasis Field!

Next time on The World of Narue:
The Night of the Festival

Kazu, stay with me always!
