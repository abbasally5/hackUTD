Kanaka :
Man, it's hot!
It's so humid out!
What’s up with crazy weather in this damn planet?!

Narue :
Big sister, if you think this is bad, you'll never last the whole season.

Kazuto :
Yeah. Summer's only just begun, Kanaka.

Kanaka :
You mean it's gonna get even hotter than this?

Narue :
Stop focusing on the heat!
It's only get to make you feel hotter, you know.

Kanaka :
Okay, I’ve had it!
Narue, old man, we are all going to the pool!

Kazuto :
Huh!?
To the pool!?

Kanaka :
On this planet, when you're hot, you can relax under a parasol in a deck chair, and have a nice tropical drink, right?
I've seen it on the TV.

Narue :
You're talking about a resort pool!
We don't have that kind of money, big sister.
We can only afford public pool.

Kazuto :
I-I think the public pool might be a little crowded.

Kanaka :
That's right!
So we should splurge, come on!

Narue :
We can't afford that luxury.

Kanaka :
HI, I am home.

Bathyscaphe :
Welcome home, Miss Kanaka.
A package has arrived for you.

Kanaka :
Huh?
T-This is…!



Episode 07 : The Pool : Clear Danger



Maruo :
You sure you're gonna be all right, Kazuto?
I mean with you a little problem at all.

Narue :
Sorry, we're late.

Maruo :
I'll bet you're glad you came now!

Narue :
What?
What's wrong?

Kazuto :
Nothing.
Nothing at all.

Narue :
Okay.

Yagi :
Ah!
Come on guys.
Why do I have to be here too?

Maruo :
Well, why not?
It's pretty hot out.

Kazuto :
Hey, uh, where's Kanaka?

Narue :
She told us to go on ahead.
Let's go.

Kazuto :
O-Okay.

P-Pretty crowded today.

Maruo :
Forget about swimming in there.

Yagi :
Waa, this's gotta be some sort of public health code violation.

Kanaka :
Don't you worry about it kid.

Narue :
Huh?

Kanaka :
I'll show you my own little private swimming hall.

Maruo :
Your swimming hall?

Kazuto & Narue & Maruo & Yagi :
Huh?

Maruo :
How far are we going?

Narue :
Is there really some kind of pool all the way over here?

Kanaka :
Just put your trust in me.

And here we go!

Maruo :
It's a closet.

Kanaka :
Don't worry!
Just trust me!

Narue :
Uh, I don't think there could actually be a pool in there.

Kanaka :
Okay, everybody in!

Narue :
Amazing!

Maruo :
Mi, those look delicious!

Narue :
He's so cute!

Kazuto :
Are we really the only ones in here?

Kanaka :
I told you it was private!

Yagi :
Where the heck are we?
And what are all those weird lights?

Maruo :
Ah, hey Yagi!
Shut up.

Yagi :
Ah, but…

Maruo :
Last for it's lock bay!
Oh, that's it.
This is the life.

Yagi :
Oh, naught!

Kanaka :
So Hajime, are you and the bald guy with kind of…?

Yagi :
Oh, n-no!
He's just a ….
I mean...

Kazuto :
You guys live next door to each other, right?

Narue :
So you’ve been friends forever!

Yagi :
W-Well, I wouldn't say friends,
We can't seem to get rid of each other.

Narue :
Hey, Kazu. Let's go swimming together!

Kazuto :
N-No thanks.
I'll stay here.

Narue :
Come on!
This is gonna be fun!
Let's go!

Kazuto :
But…!

Narue :
I race you to the other end!

Kazuto :
Well, I… uh…

Narue :
Kazu!
Hurry up!
The water's great!

Oh, my god!
Kazu's dead!

Kanaka :
Old man…

Narue :
Are you gonna be okay, Kazu?

Kazuto :
Yeah, thanks Narue.
I'm really sorry about that.
Narue, I don't know how to swim.

Kanaka :
You wuss!

Narue :
Hey, big sister!

Kazuto :
Yeah, well.
Unfortunately, she's kind of right.

Narue :
But…

Kazuto :
It's okay.

Kanaka :
I got it!
Old man, I have the perfect thing for you!

Kazuto :
The perfect thing?

Kanaka :
Come with me.

Kazuto :
So Kanaka, what's this thing?

Kanaka :
Wonder Protect formula X!
With this, the water will slide right off of you
You swim like a fish.

Kazuto :
That's all there is to it?

Kanaka :
Yeap!
It's impossible to sink with this stuff on.
So starting today, you'll be swimming like a pro.

Kazuto :
I really won't sink!?
Give me a break.

Kanaka :
Just trust me, okay?.
Here.

Narue :
Kazu, what is up with that look?

Maruo :
Look at [shirr], astro boy.

Kanaka :
Quit laughing!
The old man's trying to swim here!

Maruo :
Okay.

Kazuto :
Ah, Kanaka?
Uh Kanaka, are you sure that this is kind of…

Kanaka :
Oh, stop whining and get in!

Maruo :
I can't look.

Yagi :
No way!

Narue :
Kazu, that's incredible!

Kazuto :
It's like a dream!

Kanaka :
Good, good.

Kazuto :
It's like my body is moving on its own!
This is…
This is great!

Narue :
Kazu, you're doing great!

Maruo :
Hey, let me try it next!

Kazuto :
Ow, someone stop me!!

Narue :
Kazu!

Yagi :
Iizuka.

Narue :
Kazu!

Maruo :
You okay!?

Narue :
Kazu, snap out of it!

Kanaka :
Maybe I put a little too much on.
Hey Baldy, you wanna go next?

Maruo :
I'm good.
But thanks to the offer, really.

Narue :
Darn it, enough big sister!

Kanaka :
Oh, right.
So, where can the old man have fun without going swimming?
I know!

Gather around everyone!

Narue :
What is it this time, Sis?

Kanaka :
There's an even better pool right through here.
Let's go.

Yagi :
Wha-Wha-Wha…
What was that!?
Did you see that!?
Did you!?
Huh!?
You saw it, right!?
Right!?

Maruo :
xxx
Look around.

Narue :
Kazu, hurry up!

Kazuto :
Okay!

Yagi :
Something's not right.

Maruo :
Uh, like what?

Yagi :
Like everything!
There's no way that could be the public pool any more!

Maruo :
Hang on there.
Where are you going?

Yagi :
Exploring!
Isn't it obvious?
You know, I always investigate weird things.

Maruo :
I suppose you only bio systems.

Narue :
Hey Kazu, let's make a huge sand castle.

Kazuto :
Yeah!

Kanaka :
Good, good.

Yagi :
Definitely strange.
How could that pool be this big?

Mauro :
Who cares?
Just kick back enjoy the life like me.

Yagi :
Who cares?
I do!
And how do you explain THAT?
AND THAT?
AND THAT?
AND THAT?

Mauro :
Well, they are kind of cute if you're into that.

Yagi :
Do you even understand the scientific ramifications!?
This swimming pool could be a worm hole through space time and self!

Mauro :
W-What the hell's that?
Okay, I think I've had it about enough.
Something's coming closer.

Yagi :
What is it?

Mauro :
Yagi…
T-That's a…

Yagi :
Giant woolly Mammoth!!



Eye Catch: The world of Narue (成恵の世界) 07



Mauro :
W-Whoa.
xxx

Yagi :
Come on.
Quit gawking!
We gotta run!

Mauro :
Wha, I did be chased by xxx.

Kanaka :
Now let's go surprise the old man and Narue.

Kazuto :
That's a job well done!

Narue :
It's our own little castle!

Kazuto :
Yeah!

Maruo :
Kazuto!
Nanase!

Narue :
So what do you think we should build now?

Kazuto :
I don't know.
Oh man…

Narue :
That's cruel.
That was first sand castle Kazu and I have built.

Wow, what a big elephant!

Kazuto :
T-That's a mammoth!
Run!

Kanaka :
Go get 'em!

Yagi :
Maruo!
Over there!

Maruo :
Dive for it!!

Kanaka :
Owww.
Oh, no way.
What the heck is going on?

Maruo :
Yeah, but now look!
[Like I said.] Something is definitely strange!

Yagi :
Yeah, well, it's getting stranger!
What the hell is this?
How did jungle and ruins end up in the middle of a public pool!?

Maruo :
So what?
At least you got some energy left to shout.

Yagi :
Shut up!

Kazuto :
Ah, I guess it's fair to say we're lost.
Narue, are you okay?

Narue :
Yeah… I'm fine.
At least, I'm with you, Kazu.

Kazuto :
Really?
N-Narue?
N-Narue.

Narue :
What is it?

Kazuto :
Let's go, Narue.
The rain's letting up.
And, I'm sure Maruo and Yagi must be worried about us.

Narue :
Yeah. I bet you're right.

Maruo :
Hey, Kazuto!
Nanase!
Where are you!
You want to help me look here, Yagi?

Yagi :
It's hopeless.

Maruo :
Huh?

Yagi :
Give it up.
We'll never see either of them again, you know?
We're going to die here.

Maruo :
I highly doubt that.

Yagi :
We're going to die lost and lonely [freaks] in this weird freaky world.

Maruo :
Speak for yourself.

Yagi :
I can't take this!
What the hell is this place!?
Am I dreaming?
Or just real?
Am I crazy?
Am I just seeing things?
Nothing makes sense anymore!

Maruo :
Hm.

Yagi :
Maruo…?
M-Maruo?
Oh, it was nothing.
That was scary.

Maruo :
For the love of god healthy Yagi.
You can’t escape from [my xxxx] cicada [love].
How about Yagi, how about a kiss?

Yagi :
To hell with that!!

Maruo :
I will take that as no!

Yagi :
Do you really think this is the time for that?
Let's move.

Maruo :
Yup.
You lead, I'll follow slugger.

Narue :
Go.
Would you be please careful, Kazu.

Kazuto :
Mm-Hm.

Narue :
There they are!

Kazuto :
Narue!
Narue!!

Bathyscaphe :
Uh?

Yagi :
Uh?
Maruo, look over there!

Maruo :
Uhh?

Yagi :
Iizuka!

Maruo :
Hold on, buddy!
I'm coming for it now!
Oh, mommy!!
Daddy!!

Yagi :
Maruo!

Kazuto :
N-Narue!
Narue!

Narue :
Kazu!
Kazu!
Kazu…

Kazuto :
Narue.
A-are you okay?

Narue :
I can't believe you came to rescue me?
But you can't even swim Kazu.

Kazuto :
W-Well yeah, I was pretty scared.

Narue :
Thank you, Kazu.

Kazuto :
N-Narue, behind you!
Narue, teleport!
Teleport!

Narue :
I can't!
How come… Kazu!

Yagi :
Nanase!
T-That can't be.
Nanase…
Iizuka…

Kanaka :
Oh there you are!
Hajime!
Boy, I wasn't sure what to do for a while.
What's wrong?

Yagi :
Kanaka… Nanase and Iizuka…
They…

T-That's…
Uh-oh.

Yagi :
Huh?

Bathyscaphe :
Kanaka Nanase!!
Hajime!

Kazuto :
Where are we?

Maruo :
Someone tell me, what the hell's going on?

Bathyscaphe :
I'm sorry that this has caused so much trouble.
I've already thoroughly scolded Miss Kanaka.

Kazuto :
That's the galaxy federation's latest game console?

Narue :
So everything we experienced back there was inside some kind of virtual reality world?

Bathyscaphe :
That is correct.

Narue :
I get it.

Kanaka :
That's why I couldn't teleport out.

Bathyscaphe :
I'm confiscating this.

Kanaka :
Oh, come on!
But, I won that thing as a prize, it's mine!

Bathyscaphe :
You put your friends in danger, and you don't feel [the least you’d be] responsible, Miss Kanaka?

Kanaka :
It's not my fault, Bathyscaphe!
The controller was acting all screwy!
I couldn't help that.

Bathyscaphe :
That's called being irresponsible!

Kanaka :
I promise I'll be more careful!

Maruo :
Hey, you're finally up!

Yagi :
Where's the foggy [historic] world?
The weird animals?
The dinosaurs!?

Maruo :
I don't know.
But it sure was fun while it lasted.

Kanaka :
At least let me play an hour a day!

Bathyscaphe :
I said no.

Kanaka :
Bathyscaphe, you're being mean!

Bathyscaphe :
No means no, Miss Kanaka.

Kanaka :
Come on, give it back!

Bathyscaphe :
You're being childish, Miss Kanaka!

Kanaka :
Bathyscaphe, you jerk!

Bathyscaphe :
I don't care what you call me, I still said no.

Kanaka :
I'll let you borrow it, Bathyscaphe!
So come on!

Bathyscaphe :
I don't think so.



Next Episode :

Narue :
Another invitation to some new galaxy federation school came from the Inspector's Department.

I hate that.

Every time I say no, it reminds me that I'm an alien.
I just wanna stay with Kazu.
