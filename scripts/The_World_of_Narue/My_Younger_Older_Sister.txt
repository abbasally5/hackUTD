Narue :
Good morning, sleepy head!
Kazu!
Kazu!
Listen!
I have a huge surprise.
I found that I have an older sister, too!

Kazuto :
An older sister?

Narue :
Yup!
And guess what she's supposed to come to earth today!
I wanted you to be the first to know!

Kazuto :
I-I see…
Y-you must be really happy.

Narue :
Yup! Well, I'll see you later then!



Episode 04 : My Younger Older Sister



Kazuto :
Narue, how old is your sister?

Narue :
Well, she was 12 when my Dad came to Earth, so I guess she must be 26 by now.

Kazuto :
26, huh?
That's old, even older than my sister.

Narue :
I can not wait!
What's the first thing we should talk about?
Hey, Kazu…
Ah, if you don't mind my asking, what do you and your sister talk about?

Kazuto :
Me?
Oh, well, with my sister…

Kanaka :
Out of the way!

Kazuto :
Huh?

Kanaka :
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Move it!

Kazuto :
Owww.

Narue :
Oh!

Kazuto:
That hurts.

Narue :
What a pushy little girl.
Are you gonna be okay, Kazu?

Kazuto:
I'll be fine.
Thanks, Narue.

Kanaka :
Narue?

Tadasi :
Oh!
Just a minute.

Kanaka :
Daddy!
Huh?
Daddy?

Tadasi :
Kanaka.

Narue :
Hi, I'm home!

Kanaka :
Daddy, who is this woman!?
You didn't…
You didn't remarry, did you!?

Narue :
I'm sorry, who are you?

Kanaka :
I-I'll never ever accept such a young woman as my new mom!

Narue :
Wha… What!?

Tadasi :
K-Kanaka! It's a m-misunder… standing…
Kanaka!

Kanaka :
Bathyscaphe…

Bathyscaphe :
Yes, Miss Kanaka?

Kanaka :
Daddy… got remarried.

Bathyscaphe :
So, I see.

Kanaka :
Bathyscaphe, please gather all the information you can on that girl, right away.

Bathyscaphe :
Affirmative.
I believe the local starships have been monitoring the Nanase family very closely.
I will attempt to question them.

Hatakaze :
It's been a long time, Bathyscaphe.

Bathyscaphe :
Yes it has, Hatakaze.
I'm looking for some answers.

Hatakaze :
Master Tadashi remarried an earth woman.
One Narumi Mutsuki.
However, she has already passed away in an accident.

Kanaka :
What!?
But, then who was the girl I saw with Daddy?

Hatakaze :
That was Miss Narue.
She is your younger sister, Miss Kanaka.

Kanaka :
Younger sister?
So she wasn't his new young wife.

Bathyscaphe :
Hatakaze, please transfer all information on the Nanase family to this location.

Hatakaze :
Roger.
Goodbye.

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka, we have a video of Miss Narue from approximately 30 minutes ago.
Would you like to see it?

Kanaka :
Oh, Ok.

Kanaka (in the video):
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Move it!

Kanaka :
This is from earlier!

Kazuto (in the video):
Owww.
That hurts.

Narue (in the video):
What a pushy little girl.

Kanaka :
Pushy?

Narue (in the video):
Are you gonna be okay, Kazu?

Kazuto:
I'll be fine.
Thanks, Narue.

Kanaka :
Bathyscaphe, who's the old man?

Bathyscaphe :
According to data, he's Kazuto Iizuka.
He is currently dating Miss Narue.

Kanaka :
Can you tell me what he's doing right now?

Bathyscaphe :
One moment please.

Kazuto (in the video):
Come on!
Come on! Come on!
All right! I got a magical girl No 4!

Kanaka :
Bathyscaphe, force-teleport the old man here.

Bathyscaphe :
Affirmative.

Kanaka :
Hey, old man, question for ya.

Kazuto :
Don't scare me like that!
Besides, that's only a toy.
More importantly, where am I?

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka, it is not recommended to point a firearm at a human.

Kanaka :
Oh, Ok.

Kazuto :
You mean it's real!?

Kanaka :
I have a serious question to ask!
What is Narue Nanase like?
I need to know.

Kazuto :
Who are you?
And where the heck are we?

Kanaka :
You sure do talk a lot.
I am Kanaka Nanase.
And, this is the bridge of the Dimensional Escort Ship, Bathyscaphe.
Now, answer my question!

Kazuto :
An escort ship?

Kanaka :
Will you just answer me!?

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka.

Kanaka :
But this old man's not answering.

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka!

Kanaka :
Fine.

Kazuto :
Are you Narue's little cousin or something like that?

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka is Miss Narue's older sister.

Kazuto :
What!?
You are?
But you look like you go to elementary school…

Kanaka :
I'm 12 years old, moron!

Kazuto :
But that still makes you younger than Narue, doesn't it?

Kanaka :
Bathyscaphe, what does it mean?

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Narue is currently 14 years old.

Kanaka :
B- But, how?
How can my younger sister Narue possibly be older than I am?

Bathyscaphe :
That is due to the Urashima Effect.

Kazuto :
Urashima Effect?

Tadasi :
That letter is from your sister Kanaka.
But, look at the date.

Narue :
This letter was postmarked more 15 years ago!
How is that?

Tadasi :
That's the Urashima Effect. (* Time dilation)

Narue :
The Urashima Effect?
What is that?

Tadasi :
Some years ago, I used a stargate that connects two planets together, in order to get to Earth.
But Kanaka smuggled herself onto a high speed freight ship, and traveled by these conventional means to come and find me.

Narue :
Um, I- I still don't get it.
And why is my older sister younger than I am?

Tadasi :
The closer an object comes to the speed of light, the slower that time moves inside that very object.
But a stargate connects you directly to hyperspace.
By using a stargate, you can travel through space instantly no matter what the distance.
But, Kanaka traveled to Earth on a high speed ship.
Inside the high speed freighter, time slows down.
Which means… while only a few weeks passed inside that ship for her, an entire 15 years passed here on Earth.
That's it, the Urashima Effect.

Narue :
I don't really get it, but…

Hello, Nanase residence.

Kanaka :
It's Kanaka.

Narue :
Big sister!

Kanaka :
You're not my sister!
I won't accept it.
I have your precious boyfriend here with me.

Narue :
What!?
You have Kazu!?



Eye Catch: The world of Narue (成恵の世界) 04




Kanaka :
Yup.
I got the old man right here.
I will exchange him for daddy!

Narue :
For Kazu?
I understand.

Tadasi :
The Bathyscaphe.

Kazuto :
Awesome, this is amazing!

Kanaka :
Bathyscaphe, reconstruct and land the ship.

Bathyscaphe :
Affirmative.

Kanaka :
I had it transform into this because I know how much you like antiques, daddy!
Isn't it great?

Narue :
Wow!
So cool!

Kanaka :
I didn't make it for you!

Tadasi :
Kanaka.

Kanaka :
Daddy.

Tadasi :
Kanaka, I'm just happy to have you safe, my darling.

Narue :
I'll be alright, daddy.
Big sister, please give me back Kazu.

Kanaka :
Kazu?
If you sure want him?
Ok, I'll exchange him for daddy then.

Narue :
Big sister.

Kazuto :
They're family.
Then why…?

Bathyscaphe :
Master Kazuto, perhaps you will be able to untangle the strings of time for them.

Kanaka :
Bathyscaphe, we don't need the old man anymore.

Kazuto :
She's getting on my nerves.

Bathyscaphe :
My appology is for causing so much trouble.

The exit is this way.
Go on.

Narue :
Kazu?
Sorry!

Kazuto :
Boy, your sister's a real handful.

Narue :
I'm really, really sorry!

Kazuto :
It's ok.
I'm fine.

So Narue, why don't you tell me a little something about your mom?

Narue :
Huh?
My mom?
She was a normal person.
She liked flowers and cloud shapes.
She liked poems, everything.

Kazuto :
I see.

Narue :
Mom used to have this habit of always picking me upon hugging me.
It was a little embarrassing when she did it around people.

Kazuto :
Well, that's because you were very important to her, Narue.
I think there are a lot of things you just can't express in words.

Narue :
I'm going!

Kazuto :
Huh?
Narue.

Narue :
I'm going to go visit my sister.

Tadasi :
Oh, I am so full.

Kanaka :
Hold me, daddy.

Tadasi :
Cut that out.
You're a big girl now.

Kanaka :
I'm not that big.
I'm still a kid!

Hey, daddy?
Were you really sad that you couldn't see me?

Tadasi :
Yes, those were 15 long years.
But I did have Narue.

Kanaka :
Your hands are so rough.

Tadasi :
What is it?

Kanaka :
You're not my daddy.
You're not the daddy I know!

Tadasi :
Kanaka!

Narue :
Big sister?
What happened?

Kanaka :
Let go!

Narue :
Big sister!

Kanaka :
I just don't know anybody anymore!
None of you could ever understand what I'm going through!

Narue :
That's not true at all!
We're here for you, Kanaka!

Kanaka :
Shut up!
Let me go!

Narue :
Big sister!

Kanaka :
Don't touch me!

Kazuto :
Narue!

Narue, are you ok?
Narue, wake up, wake up!
Narue!
Narue!

Bathyscaphe :
That defense gun saps energy rapidly from a body.
The shot results in your body trying to regain strength, and causes fevers.
There is no risk to her life, and the fever is a step towards recovery but we can't use any medicine to revive her.

Kazuto :
Listen Kanaka, Narue really was looking forward to meeting her sister, you know.

Kanaka :
You're lying!
None of you cares about me!
Nobody cares about me!
When I got on that freighter, mommy and daddy didn't come for me.
The only one that came for me was Bathyscaphe.

Kazuto (in mind, saying Narue) :
I found that I have an older sister, too!
Hey Kazu, Ah, if you don't mind my asking what do you and your sister talk about?

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka, I have an important message for you.

Kanaka :
A message?

Bathyscaphe :
Perhaps it is appropriate to view now.

Kanaka's Mom (in 3d hologram) :
Kanaka, how are you, darling?
I’m likely still inside the ship.
I think I'll regret this, just as I'm sure you do, Kanaka.
I am losing time to the Urashima Effect.
When I returned from my trip, you were already grown up.
I felt like you were moving further and further away from me.
It's selfish of me, when I know it's my fault for not quitting my job.
If I don't love, how can I expect someone to love me back?
I am truly truly sorry.

Kanaka :
Old man, did Narue really want to meet me?

Kazuto :
Uh-hm

Kanaka :
Really?

Kazuto :
Hm.

Narue :
Big sister?

Kazuto :
Narue!
Thank God, you ok?

Narue :
Big sister, did you stay with me all night?

Kanaka :
It was all my fault.
I'm sorry, Narue.

Narue :
Oh, big sister!
I've always wanted to hug someone like this!

Kanaka :
T-There's always daddy.

Narue :
At this age, it just doesn't feel right with daddy.

Kanaka :
Y-Yeah, I guess so.
It's better to hug your boyfriend, anyway?

Narue :
Big sister!


Bathyscaphe :
The strings of time have been untangled.



Next Episode :

Narue :
Starting today, my sister Kanaka is going to the same school as me!
Hope she'll be okay.

Huh?
Why are you at Yagi's house, big sister?
Next time on The World of Narue,

"Kanaka Goes to School."

It's a direct hit to your heart.
