Rin :
And it's really a lot of fun!

Ran :
Wow, I want to go too!

Tadashi :
Ran Tendo, Rei Otonashi.

Ran & Rei :
Y-Yes sir.

Tadashi :
Some Terror Capsules attached themselves to a delivery ship, and passed through the star gate.
There are too many of them for the army to handle.
Back them up.

Ran & Rei :
Affirmative!

Rin :
Oh-oh, Not me?

Tadashi :
Rin Asakura, you stay behind for now.

Rin :
I understand…

Ran :
Just leave the fighting to us, Rin!

Rei :
We'll be back in no time at all.

Operation :
From Defensive Line Command.
Abe, Vega.
Confirmed release of Terror Capsules.
Total number: unknown.
Contents: (a) Berserker Seeds confirmed.
They’ve been regenerat[ed/ing] within 60 seconds.
Attack on sight.

Rei :
Get 'em!

Ran :
60 seconds, my butt!

Rei :
Whoa, they're regenerating!

Ran :
Pretty fast!

Rei :
Yeah!



Episode 12 : The Night of the Festival



Kanaka :
Bathyscaphe, that's too tight!

Bathyscaphe :
If you don't tie it snug, it will come loose later.

Tadashi :
Hm?
What, Narue, are you leaving already?

Narue :
Yeah.
I'm going on ahead.

Kanaka :
You're meeting with the Old Man, right?

I'll go with you, Daddy!

Narue :
See you later!

Kanaka :
Narue!
The Old Man is absolutely going to melt when he sees you in that kimono.

Narue :
Come on, sis.
Will you quit teasing us?!

Bathyscaphe :
Have a good time.

Kazuto :
Narue!
Hey, I'm over here!

Narue :
Kazu, sorry I am late…
Hm, what's wrong…?

Kazuto :
Oh… uh… I…
You look really good in kimono.

Narue :
Oh, this…
This used to be my mother's.

Kazuto :
Your mother's…
No wonder it looks so good on you.

Narue :
Really?
Oh, Kazu!
Thanks.
My mother, she loved festivals a lot, too…

Kazuto :
Let's go.

Narue :
Hm.

Kazuto :
Hey, let's have some takoyaki.

Narue :
What?
They're 500 yen!
It's a waste!
I'll cook you some takoyaki at home later.

Kazuto :
Huh… o-okay.

Maruo :
Yo, Kazuto.

Kazuto :
Maruo.

Narue :
And Yagi too.

Yagi :
You two are cozy as usual.

Narue :
I could say the same for you two.

Maruo :
Well I wanted to stay home and watch Nighter.

Yagi :
So who else was I going to get to come with me then?

Maruo :
Yagi, are you in love with me?

Yagi :
Is the blood rushing to your brain?

Maruo :
What are you talking about, woman?
Just a cotton-pickin' minute!
I gave up Nighter to be here!

Kazuto :
Come on, guys.
It's a festival, so let's not fight.
Just for tonight.

Narue :
Let's go walk around together.

Maruo :
We'll see you guys later.
We'd only get in your way, love birds.

Kazuto :
Maruo…

Maruo :
I assume you're watching the fireworks from the usual place tonight, right?
Meet you there later.
Have fun, kiddies!

Narue :
The usual place?

Kazuto :
O-Oh, actually, at the top of those stone steps there's a small shrine…
an-, and when you climb the hill behind it, you can see the fireworks really well.
Too pain to climb, so no one ever goes up there.

Narue :
I see.

Kanaka :
Daddy!
Hurry up!
Let's go!

Tadashi :
Kanaka, it's dangerous.

Kanaka :
No one’s gonna try to kill you
Not when I'm with you!

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka seems to want to be pampered tonight.

Kanaka :
Oh come on!
It's a festival after all. Right?

Tadashi :
That's true.
I guess.

Kanaka :
Daddy, I want to have a chocolate banana.

Tadashi :
Alright, alright.

Kanaka :
And I want a balloon and a candy apple too!

Tadashi :
Alright.

Kanaka :
What else…

Alien Terrorist 1 :
Kill them?

Space Ninja :
No, it's too risky when the starship’s with them.

Alien Terrorist 2 :
Now what?

Space Ninja :
We'll start off with the girl who left before.

Alien Terrorist 2 :
Gotcha, boss!

Kazuto :
What a haul.

Narue :
I don't get any.

Kazuto :
Your problem is you got way too excited, Narue.
It's important that you remain calm when you do it.

Narue :
I don't really get these games.
Man, I suck at this.

Kazuto :
Sorry, I didn't mean it like that.
Here, take one of mine.

Narue :
It's okay.

Kazuto :
Huh?
Are you sure?

Narue :
Of course, I'm just happy being here at the festival with you tonight, Kazu.

Kazuto :
Thanks, Narue.
Hey, since we're here, let's pay our respects.

Space Ninja :
Little Nanase,
I've come to pay you back.

Narue :
Space ninja!

Kazuto :
Narue!
Let's go!

Alien Terrorist 2 :
Let's go!

Alien Terrorist 1 :
Yeah.

Narue :
Kazu…
A Time Stasis Shield…

Alien Terrorist 1 :
Too easy, earthling!

Alien Terrorist 2 :
Let's kill them quickly.

Space Ninja :
Wait!
It'd be a pity to just finish them off.
Let's play with them, first.

Kazuto :
Oh, What?

Narue :
Kazu.

Kazuto :
How was going…
W-Whoa!
Everyone's frozen!
What is this!?

Space Ninja :
And Now, you're both together, so we can kill you slowly.

Alien Terrorist 2 :
Good idea.

Alien Terrorist 1 :
I like your thinking.

Space Ninja :
Here we go!!

Kazuto :
Narue, teleport now!

Space Ninja :
Nice try kid.

Narue :
Ah!
How come!?

Alien Terrorist 1 :
This shield is blocking transmissions coming from your ship.
You're not going anywhere.
Sorry about that.

Rin :
Narue, Kazuto, run while you can!

Kazuto :
Rin… Thank God!

Narue, this way!

Alien Terrorist 2 :
Damn cyborg girl!

Alien Terrorist 1 :
Get out of my way!

Alien Terrorist 2 :
You won't get away.

Space Ninja :
Patience, my friend. They won't get very far.
Let's enjoy the hunt.

Alien Terrorist 1 :
But the Inspector is involved now.
There isn't much time left.

Space Ninja :
No, I have that covered.

Kanaka :
Huh, what's going on here?

Bathyscaphe :
This is a Time Stasis Shield.

Kanaka :
But we're still able to move.

Bathyscaphe :
It's intentionally set so that we are unaffected.

Kanaka :
The Inspector?

Tadashi :
No, the Inspector wouldn't do something so rash.

Kanaka :
Then who did this?

Bathyscaphe :
There's a strong possibility that it is a terrorist.

Kanaka :
What?
Then Narue is…



Eye Catch: The world of Narue (成恵の世界) 12



Rin :
Are you okay?

Kazuto :
Yeah, somehow…

Narue :
And the ninjas?

Rin :
They're probably looking for us, right now.

Kazuto :
What the heck is going on?

Rin :
Several hours ago, a starship forced its way through a star gate.
There was a strong chance that it was a terrorist group that was targeting all of you, so I came down to warn you, but…

Kazuto :
I guess you didn't quite make it.

Rin :
I'm sorry.
Unfortunately, right before I came, a massive onslaught of Terror Capsules were sent in, and responding to it delayed me…

Kazuto :
He's the one who attacked us at your dad place, right?

Narue :
Yeah.

Rin :
I believe he escaped'en route to the federation mother ship.
I'm very sorry for everything!

Narue :
We know, It's not your fault, Rin.
Don't worry about it.

Rin :
But…

Narue :
Really, thanks a lot.

Rin :
Huh?

Narue :

You came to help us before.
And we hadn't thanked to you.

Rin :
Narue…
I'm very glad to have been of help!
Oh, and these are for you. They transform into anything you can imagine.
A very versatile weapon.

Kazuto :
Huh?
This is really a weapon?

Rin :
Yes.
At any rate, let's get outside the shield.
We can get there by going up.

Narue :
Are you okay, Kazu…?

Yagi.

Kazuto :
Maruo!

Rin :
Kazuto, hurry!

Alien Terrorist 2 :
You're not getting away!
What's this!?

Kazuto :
Take this!

Alien Terrorist 2 :
Stay out of this, punk!

Narue :
Watch out, Kazu!

Kazuto :
Way to go, Narue!

Narue :
Thanks.
That was for you, Kazu.

Alien Terrorist 1 :
Don't celebrate yet.

Narue :
Rin!
Are you ok?

Alien Terrorist 1 :
Don't.

Space Ninja :
Think you could shoot me, cyborg girl?
Of course not.
Too bad for you we are life forms, and according to those Three Little Rules that you are governed by, you are prohibited form hurting us.
Isn't that right?

Alien Terrorist 1 :
Well, no kidding.
Great!

Rin :
Narue, please get out of here!

Narue :
But, Rin!

Alien Terrorist 2 :
Now you're going to pay.

What?

Kazuto :
I-I'm a warrior who fights for love and peace…
And this is a direct hit to your chest!

Alien Terrorist 2 :
Huh!
Just a toy.

Kanaka :
Narue!
Old Man!

Tadashi :
Narue!
Where are you!

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Narue!
Master Kazuto!

Kanaka :
What is it, Bathyscaphe?

Bathyscaphe :
That is what’s creating this time stasis shield.
There's also an amplifying device higher up.

Kanaka :
So that's it…
Okay.
What gives?!

Bathyscaphe :
The transmissions to the mother ship have also been blocked.
Meaning we can't teleport.

Kanaka :
Bathyscaphe, destroy the gate,

Bathyscaphe :
Affirmative.

Tadashi :
Hey, don't do anything crazy…

Kazuto & Narue :
Let her go!

Alien Terrorist 2 :
Watch carefully, because we'll be lighting you up next!

Space Ninja :
I'll say this for you Inspector robot, you're made well, huh.

Alien Terrorist 1 :
It looks like our next prey has just arrived.

Space Ninja :
Really?

Alien Terrorist 1 :
I'll go keep them company.

Nice work, Starship.
You're good.

Tadashi :
An Avalonian!

Bathyscaphe :
Please, take Miss Kanaka and get to safe.

Kanaka :
Papa, move faster!

Alien Terrorist 1 :
This is the end.

Bathyscaphe :
Watch out!

Kanaka :
Bathyscaphe, hurry up and waste this guy!

Bathyscaphe :
No matter what the conditions,
we android are not allowed to kill even scum like this.

Kanaka :
Oh no…

Alien Terrorist 1 :
A starship can destroy a whole planet with one shot, and you can't even touch me!

Kanaka :
Bathyscaphe!

Alien Terrorist 1 :
Wha-what the hell is this!?

Bathyscaphe :
I'm sorry to frighten to Miss Kanaka.
But extreme measures were necessary.
There are plenty of ways to capture you without hurting you.
Never underestimate a Federation Android.

Alien Terrorist 1 :
Damn you!
Let me out!

Narue :
Rin!

Space Ninja :
Now, play time is over.
Prepare yourself, Little Nanase!

Kazuto :
Let her go!
Stop it!

Narue :
Kazu, help me!

Space Ninja :
This time, you die!!

Kazuto :
Narue!

Alien Terrorist 2 :
What!?

Kazuto :
Narue.

Rin :
Rei!
Ran!
Thank goodness!

Rei :
Hey, sorry we're so late, guys.

Ran :
You okay, Rin?

Space Ninja and his company:
Damn…

Rin :
Thank you.

Rei :
Glad we made it in time.
Can you stand, Rin?

Ran!?
What's wrong?

Ran :
Kill Narue.

Rei :
Look out!

Rin :
Rei!
Rei!
What's wrong with Ran!

Alien Terrorist 2 :
It won't do you any good.
She's under the effect of the Berserker Virus.
The one we brought.

Space Ninja :
Right now, she won't hesitate to kill you all.

Rin :
Ran, please stop.

Ran :
Must kill Narue!
Must kill Narue!

Narue :
Kazu, no.

Ran :
Must kill Narue!
Must kill Narue!!

Rin :
Ran!
Ran!
Ran, I'm sorry!
Ran, wake up!

Space Ninja :
Don't think this is over!

Messa :
Are you alright?

Kazuto :
Y-Yes…

Messa :
I haven't introduced myself, Kazuto Iizuka.
I am Head Inspector from Planet Nihon.
Inspector Tail Messa.

Kazuto :
Uh, hi.

Messa :
Would you like to know who we are and would you like to know more about where we came from?

Kazuto :
Really that's okay.
Even if I knew, what different can I possible make it?

Narue :
Kazu…

Messa :
That's not true!
You more than have sufficient skills, knowledge, and the power to protect your world!
Your individual ability for compassion…
No… I'm sorry.
I lost myself.

Kazuto :
Why can't all of you people just leave Narue and family alone?

Messa :
We have been doing our best.

Kazuto :
Yeah, well.
It makes Narue… worry…

Messa :
That sympathy is one of the great qualities of Earthlings…
Let me ask you one last question, Iizuka.
It may a bit unfair to ask you this after your recent ordeal…
But do you truly want to continue to be by Narue Nanase's side no matter the risks?

Kazuto :
Yes.

Narue :
Kazu…

Messa :
Thank you, that's what I needed to confirm.
We will continue to do our best.

Kazuto :
Tail Messa.

Messa :
What is it, Kazuto Iizuka?

Kazuto :
Are Rin and the others going to be alright?

Messa :
Yes.
Thank you.

Yagi :
Wait up!
I'm exhausted!

Maruo :
That's how we keep this spot…. so private!

Hey, Kazuto!

Kazuto :
Hey, Maruo!

Maruo :
Oh, you're here already.
Man, heck of a climb…
I’m bushed!

Yagi :
Hey, what the heck happened to you two?

Kazuto :
Just a little mishap.

Maruo :
I wouldn’t call that a little!
You guys are filthy.

Kazuto :
I-It's nothing… right, Narue?

Narue :
Hm

Kazuto :
Hey, the fireworks are starting.

Maruo :
Whoa, cool!

Narue :
It's beautiful…

Kazuto :
It really is.

Narue :
God, Kazu is such a wonderful person.
Even after all we've been through, he still smiles at me.
(But) I know that dangers are still out there.
So please, protect the people I love, and everything around them.
