Narue (In mind) :
It's been a while since Kazu and I went out alone.

Kazuto :
Narue!

Narue :
Kazu!

Kazuto :
Good morning.

Narue :
Morning!
So, where do you want to go today?

Kazuto :
Actually, there's some place I’d like to go, that's ok?



Episode 10 : The Great Cosplay Plan!



Narue :
What is this place?

Kazuto :
Sorry, wait here one sec, ok?

A clerk :
Here's your purchase and your ticket.
Thank you for shopping at new wall manga.

Narue :
Huh?
What, Kazu?
Aren't you done?

Kazuto :
Sorry, Narue.
Just a little more.

A Staff :
Welcome!
Thank you for coming!
Welcome!

Oh, I'm sorry, miss.
I'm afraid if you don't have a ticket, you can't come in.

Narue :
Kazu?

Kazuto :
Sorry, Narue!

Narue :
Ok, Kazu…

Morino :
Hello, everyone!
Now, I xxx you.
What you've been waiting for!
Here's Kiriri!

Narue :
What is this…!?

Kiriri :
Everybody!
Is everybody feeling good?

Audience :
Year, We're feeling great!!

Kiriri :
Thanks for coming tonight. [xxxx] it’s a party!

Narue :
Oh, that Kazu…
Hey!

Kazuto :
Ow Ow

Narue :
What is this!?
Who that heck is that girl!?

Kazuto :
It's kind of hard to explain…
It’s Kiriri Kaibashiri, and she's a popular middle school voice actor.
She's the voice for Yongou, you know, Magical Girl No.4, in the new series, too.

Narue :
So that girl is No. 4?

Kazuto :
On her voice, yeah.
But that magical girl No.4 costume sure is cute…

Narue :
What's with you in magical girl?
Always No.4 this and No.4 that!
Why not just go out with her!?

Kazuto :
What's the matter?
Why are you getting so upset?

Narue :
Because this is our first solo date in a while…

Kazuto :
So this will be over really quick, I promise.

Kiriri :
Oh no!
Why are you fighting?
Oh, I know, It's all my fault isn't it?
Ah, Oh, there I go again. I’m such a naughty little girl.
I've broken up yet another happy couple!

Kazuto & Narue :
Huh?

Kiriri :
Please forgive me, jealous girlfriend!
I just can help it.
Boys are like pinballs that are attracted to roses instead of weeds!
Now, now, Widow Miss Weed, you should hurry on home…!

Kazuto :
N-Narue…

Uh… T-That costume looks really good on you.

Kiriri :
You really think so?

Narue :
Kazu, why are you taking her side!?

Kazuto :
I was just, I mean…

Narue :
So what if she does No.4's voice!?
It's not like she's actually a magical girl.
She's just wearing a costume!

Oh, Kazu, you jerk!!

Kazuto :
Narue!

Kiriri :
Let her go.
Wouldn't you rather come over here shake my hand?

Kazuto :
Er, I guess.
I'm really sorry about this.
Thanks.

Kazuto :
Hey, Narue… Narue!

Morino :
Excuse me!
Could you do me a favor?

A Bookshop Clerk :
Thank you for coming!

Yagi :
Huh?
Nanase?
What's wrong?

Narue :
Yagi, I just Lo…

Yagi :
Lo?

Narue :
I think I just lost Kazu to a magical girl!

Yagi :
Magical?
Hm.
So you really got jealous of a girl dressed as an anime character?

Narue :
But…

Yagi :
I think you’re worried over nothing.
I can't imagine Iizuka falling for anyone but you, Narue.

Narue :
Really, I guess.
But… you can never tell…
Kazu even said she looked really cute in her No.4 custom.
Yagi, I might really lose him.

Yagi :
You're hopeless, do you know that?
So if you're that afraid,
why don't you give it a try too?

Narue :
Try what?

Yagi :
It's called "Cosplay".

Manaka (in Anime) :
I'll never forgive you…
I swear it…
You pay for this!
Armor!!
I'm a Magical Girl who fights for love and peace!
They call me Magical Girl No.4.
It's a direct hit to your heart!

Yagi :
You up for this?

Narue :
Mm-hm!
Amazing!
You bought all of this?

Yagi :
Doing your research is a basic rule, Narue!
Once you know the color and shape, it's just like making any other clothes

Narue :
Yagi, thank you.

Kazuto :
Huh?
She's not here?
She wasn't in the apartment either, so I thought she'd be over here…

Kanaka :
Hey, weren't you guys going on a date?
Narue left in such a great mood.
Oooh, wait.
Did you two have a fight?

Yagi :
Let's see.
Looks like we bought everything we’re gonna need…

Narue :
Do you think they'll let us use the school machines?

Yagi :
No prob.
You can use ours.
My mom's away on business again.

Narue :
Really?

Yagi :
Yeah.

Kiriri :
Oh look!
If it isn’t the weedy girlfriend we met a while ago?

Yagi :
Nanase, is this the infamous middle school voice actor?

Narue :
Um-hm.

Kiriri :
What you got there?
That looks like the colors of No.4 costume.
I guess that means you'll be entering the "Magical Girl No.4 Cosplay Contest…" that's happening this Saturday.

Narue :
Cosplay contest?

Kiriri :
Yup.
Of course, you really waste your time trying to incept in a shabby homemade costume!

A Girl :
I'll be wearing a 150,000 yen professionally designed costume.

Narue :
How much?

Yagi :
Being expensive doesn't mean it's good!
Nanase, let's go!

Kiriri :
Bye bye there ladies!
Oh, and about your weirdo boyfriend, Kazuto…
I asked him if he wanted to be a special judge for this contest, and he was so happy to accept!
Now, what would make him want to do that?
I guess boys just prefer me to a jealous, plain, dull girl like you after all, being popular such a curse!

Yagi :
Oh, she may be jealous and dull.
But it’s better than being a pushy, no-talent, self-important voice actor!

Kiriri :
W-What!?

A Girl :
Easy, Miss Kiriri!

Kiriri :
Fine, make your home-made crappy costume then you can embarrass yourself in front of your boyfriend!

Yagi :
God, those two made me so mad!

Narue :
What would we do?
She said 150,000 yen, Yagi.

Yagi :
This isn't like you, Nanase.
Don't give up!

Narue :
But it's already Thursday…
We'll never make it in time.

Yagi :
Nanase!
You're going to make the best costume, and win this damn thing!
And let’s [get/not] that stupid girl off of her high horse!

Narue :
Ah, thank you so much, Yagi!
I'll do my best!

Yagi :
We'll do OUR best!

Now, don’t forget, you need to finish that costume by tomorrow, okay?

Narue :
Yeah, I know.

Yagi :
Be careful on the roads, Narue.

Narue :
Thanks!
See you!

Yagi :
There!

Kazuto :
Narue didn't come by again, today…

A Girl Student :
Nanase already left.

Kazuto :
Huh?
Already?

A Girl Student :
Yeah, she seemed to be in a big hurry.

Narue :
See you later!
Dinner's in the pot, so you can just reheat it, ok?

Tadashi :
Be careful now.

Narue :
Okay!

Tadashi :
Nanase residence.
Oh, Kazuto.
No, Narue just left.

Oh?
She wasn't leaving to meet you?
I'm sorry I…

Kazuto :
No, no.
It's okay.
It wasn't all that important.
Thank you.

Narue, she must be really mad at me…

Yagi :
Pretty damn good, huh?

Narue :
Yeah, mine too!
This took me past midnight!

Yagi :
I was up to 4:16 in the morning.

Narue :
Oh, that's late!
Kazu’s really gonna like this custom, right?

Yagi :
Of course, he will!
We’ll put those girls to shame!
It's one last drive to tomorrow's contest, so let's finish up!

Narue :
Roger, Captain Yagi!

Yagi :
Alright, let's do it!

Narue & Yagi :
Here we go!!

Maruo :
Huh?
What the heck?
Awfully lively for Yagi's place.

Narue :
I whipped up something simple for dinner, Yagi.

Yagi :
Good work, pal.

Are you sure this is okay?
Won't your family worry?

Narue :
No, dad knows I'm here, so it's ok.
But I'm nervous that I've never slept over at a friend's house before.

Yagi :
I know what you mean.
I've never had a friend spend the night here, either.
Delicious!
You're a great cook, Narue!

Narue :
Oh no, I'm average.

It's a lot of fun to make something like this, isn't it?

Yagi :
Yeah. It reminds me of the culture festival at school.
By the way, have you told Iizuka that you're entering the contest?

Narue :
I haven't.
I thought I'd keep it a secret and surprise him.

Yagi :
I can't believe he'd choose some bimbo in an anime costume over a girl who can cook and is constantly thinking about him!
I told you' worrying over nothing!

Narue :
He can't help it like [that] she’s Magical Girl No.4.
That's why I…

Yagi :
Oh, isn’t that sweet?…
Alright, I'm fired up!
Time to finally finish this thing!

Narue :
Uh, Yagi




Eye Catch: The world of Narue (成恵の世界) 10




Narue :
It's finally complete!

Yagi :
Why don't you try it on.

Narue :
I'm a Magical Girl who fights for love and peace!
They call me Magical Girl No.4.
It's a direct hit to your heart!

Yagi :
That's great!
Perfect!
Huh? Wait, something's not the same as the video…
Oh, it's this!

Narue :
What?

Yagi :
This head piece and the shoulder parts!

Narue :
We're missing this big cannon, too!

Narue & Yagi :
What’ll we do?

Yagi :
9 O'clock!

Narue & Yagi :
We have no time!

Kazuto :
I called her a bunch of times at the apartment, but she won't pick up.
Is she avoiding me or something?

Maruo :
You were shaking hands with some other girl during your date.
Of course, she's mad.

Kazuto :
It's not like that with Kiriri.

Maruo :
Look, whether she's a [xxxx] idol, or an anime character.
Women dislike other women who steal the attention and affections of the men they love.
Plus, they constantly need to be reassured that they're the most important thing in your life, you numb-skull!

Maruo's Sister :
Hey! Geek-boy! It's the Nighter season finale!

Maruo :
I'll be right there, big sis.

I'll see ya.

Man, that Kazuto.
He knows it's Nighter time.
Ah, yeah, hello…

Yagi :
Maruo!
Help us!

Maruo :
What’s? What's wrong!?

Yagi :
Please!
Get over here.

Maruo :
Gotcha!

Yagi!
You all right?!

Narue :
Oh, come on in.

Maruo :
Uuuuhhhh....!

Yagi :
Oh hey, don't leave!

Maruo :
So, you need help building the cannon and the armor, right?

Narue & Yagi :
Please help us.

Maruo :
Alright then, I'll go to my house and get some supplies.
I'm your man.

Narue :
That's great!

Yagi :
We'll be able to make it!

Maruo :
Have you two always been this friendly?

Yagi :
Well, we're all friends!

Narue :
Right?

Maruo(In mind) :
That Kazuto…
You’ve got nothing to worry about that, pal.

Kazuto :
Narue…

Narue :
This Styrofoam box smells like stinky!

Maruo :
I washed it.
It's fine.

Don't spray the lacquer on the foam!
It'll melt!

Narue :
Maruo, why'd you turn the air conditioning off?

Maruo :
I-I had to open the window or the fumes from the lacquer could get dangerous.

Yagi :
Glue in here?

Maruo(In mind) :
These girls seem to forgot I'm still a guy!
A guy with needs

Maruo :
It's cramped in here, so I'll go work next door.

Yagi :
Maruo!

Maruo :
Thank you!

Yagi :
Now remember, no sleeping.

Maruo :
Yeah, yeah…

Narue :
Yagi!

Yagi :
I-I'm okay…

Narue :
Why don't you rest?

Yagi :
No, don't worry about me, Narue.
Just keep working on your project.

Narue :
But…

Yagi :
Nanase, did you know that when you get really tired, a special gland in your brain releases adrenaline, giving you amazing power?
So let's not give up.
No matter what, we’ve got to keep going!

Narue :
Okay!

S-So close now… But…
My body… It just won't move…

No, I can't…
If I give up, no, I'll lose Kazu…
I'll lose him forever.
Oh, stop it!!
Stop it!

Maruo :
Oh!
I… I feel power welling up inside me!

Yagi :
So this is… adrenaline…

Maruo :
My hands move again!

Yagi :
My eyes are focused!

Narue :
We found the source of our true power!

Yagi :
Now, hurry and get to the contest, Nanase!

Maruo :
You're invincible right now!

Narue :
Thank you, guys.

Yagi :
Go get Iizuka back!

Narue :
Right!

Yagi :
Kick that butt, Nanase!!

Maruo :
Go get 'em girl!!

Yagi & Maruo :
Uhhh...!

Woman MC :
Ok, No, 8.
Where did you get this costume?

Girl 1 :
Umm, I bought this at a store yesterday.
It cost me 70,000 yen!

Morino :
Well, mine cost 150,000 yen and it's the same place that made Kiriri's custom!

Girl 1 :
What?

Judge 1 :
It's too bad.
Recent cosplay competitions have become more about spending money and less about creativity.

Judge 2 :
[Gable], Who cares?
At least they're made well.

Judge 1 :
Battling sleep to sew, accidentally stitching her hand to the fabric with the machine.
She sees the blood, but keeps going.
I just don't see that passion anymore!
It's a terrible shame.

Judge 2 :
Right.

MC :
So, what's your life-long dream?

Morino :
Well, I'd like to become a voice actor like Kiriri.

Kiriri (In mind) :
So far, so good.

Kazuto (In mind) :
Always No. 4 this and No. 4 that!
Why not go out with her, Kazu?

Look, I told you, women dislike other women who steal the attention on the affections of the men that they love.
And, you’re still a love skull.

Kazu, you jerk…

Kazuto :
Narue!

A man:
Hey you!
Down in front!

Kazuto :
Oh, I'm sorry…

MC :
Well then, judges, all the contestants are here.
Please lock in your final scores.

Kiriri (In mind) :
Morino is sure to win!

Narue :
Wait!!
No. 18!
Narue Nanase!

Kazuto :
What?
Narue!?!

Judge 1 :
Just!

Narue :
Sorry to keep you waiting!
I'm a Magical Girl who fights for love and peace!
It's a direct hit... to your heart!

Judge 1 :
This is it!!
[Lovely] good show!

Narue :
Direct hit!
Direct hit!
It's a direct hit!!

Judge 1 :
The Winner!
We [announce there’s] just winner!!

Morino :
Oh no…

Kiriri :
I guess… I lose…
Bitch!

Narue :
It's a direct hit to your heart!

Kazuto :
Ah!
N-Narue!?

Narue :
Oh good, you're awake at last.

Kazuto :
Um, Yeah!
What's with that get up?

Narue :
I made it.
Don't you like it, Kazu?

Kazuto :
No, that's not what I mean.

Narue :
Oh, good.

Kazuto :
Um, did you… do this for me?

Narue :
Yeah, because you like this stuff, right, Kazu?
So I'll wear it often from now on.

Kazuto :
You don't have to wear that, Narue.

Narue :
Huh? Why not?

Kazuto :
Because you don't have to do that impress me.
I like the real Narue the best.

Narue :
Kazu…
Kazu!

Kazuto :
Narue, I…

MC :
The final votes will now be announced.
All contestants please come to the stage.
I repeat, all contestants please come to the stage.

Kazuto :
N-Narue, you're being called.

MC :
I repeat, all contestants please come to the stage.

Kazuto :
You should go.

Narue :
No, it doesn't matter.

Judge 1 :
Contestant No. 18!
Contestant No. 18!
Where did you go!?
Why have you forsaken me?!

Kanaka :
What a waste.
You won and then you didn't even show to collect a prize?

Narue :
It's ok.
Right, Kazu?

Kazuto :
Yeah.

Maruo :
Aren't you two lovey dovey!

Yagi :
Nanase!

Maruo :
Aah!

Narue :
Yagi?

Kazuto :
That outfit…

Yagi :
Magical No. 4 has to be with the Shaman!
Nanase, go put yours on!

Narue :
N-No, that's okay.

Kanaka :
Hajime's gone crazy.

Maruo :
Grrrr....What the hell are you wearing?!
How dare you come here dressed like that?!

Yagi :
Shut up.
Yeah!

Maruo :
Take it off!
Get changed!
Snap out of it, woman!!

Yagi :
Don't! Get off, jerk! (You wouldn't understand any of this, you moron!)

(Maruo :
I can't believe you come in here dressed like the rear end of a horse, and thinking everyone will think it's great!
Are you crazy?!)

(Yagi :
I'm not crazy! I just have great taste!)

(Maruo :
That filth in your mouth will just keep you going!)

(Yagi :
Grrrr! Shut up!!)

Kazuto :
Hey, Narue.

Narue :
What is it?

Kazuto :
I know I said it differently the other day, but it's ok.
I really would love to see you in your Yongou again.
You looked really cute.

Narue :
Oh, stop it!
Kazu!
You're joking, right?
Kazu, get up!
Come on!
Kazu!
Kazu, get up!
Kazu?
