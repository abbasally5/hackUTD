Girl 1 :
You're going today too, right?

Girl 2 :
Yeah!

Kazuto :
Going to class?

Narue :
Yeah.
I'm headed to the locker room for gym.

Kazuto :
Girl's locker room…

Narue :
Excuse me.
Are you thinking perverted thoughts, Kazu?
Those kind of thoughts aren't allowed, even if you are my boyfriend.

Kazuto :
No no not me, not at all ..
I was, I was nothing like that.



Episode 05 : Kanaka Goes to School



Yagi (in mind) :
She only has one spine, and no tendrils growing from her shoulders.
She looks as normal as anyone else.
Well, if you keep claiming you're an alien,

Yagi :
then you should be able to dodge this!
You're mine!

Narue :
Owww.
Oh, my nose!

Yagi :
Well, well, look at that!
You're just a normal human, after all!

P.E. Teacher :
What's going on here!?
Hazime?!

Kanaka :
What's up with you?

Narue :
Nothing.

Kanaka :
Thanks for the grub!

Narue :
Kanaka, why do I always have to come all the way over here just to cook your dinner?
You should just move in with us!

Kanaka :
But your place is so small.
And it's kind of [nuts].
Ah, delicious!
You're really such a good cook, Narue!

Narue :
Really?

Kanaka :
So, why don't you and daddy move over here?

Narue :
We would If only dad would say yes.
But you know him.
He says he's comfortable over there.

Kanaka :
That figures.

Bathyscaphe :
Hello girls, I'm back.

Narue :
Really?
You're really coming to my school, big sister?

Kanaka :
What the heck is this!?
Why am I in a lower grade than Narue!?

Bathyscaphe :
Would you have preferred elementary school miss Kanaka?

Kanaka :
Ah, well then middle school it is.

Bathyscaphe :
Please remember to use discretion and not to divulge our secrets.

Kanaka :
Right, right.
You don't want us to cause any trouble.
Yeah, I get it.

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka, will you please hurry up and take your bath!

Kanaka :
Yeah, right.

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka.

Kanaka :
What's the matter?

Bathyscaphe :
It seems that someone is currently pointing a camera at us.

Kanaka :
Maybe it's a stalker!
This could be fun!
I'm going to investigate!

Bathyscaphe :
Wait, miss Kanaka!

Yagi :
Oh, man, it's so cold.
I should have b-brought a jacket or something.

Kanaka :
Hey there, stalker!
Hey wait, you're a girl.

Yagi :
Who are you!?
You shouldn't sneak up on people like that!

Kanaka :
So, girls are into peeping these days too, huh?

Yagi :
I'm waiting for a UFO.

Kanaka :
A UFO?

Yagi :
You're thinking I'm just another looney, aren't you?

Kanaka :
Not really.

Yagi :
There were reports about a recent UFO sighting here.
So, I'm here to get picture of it.
How about you?
Are you from around here?
Have you seen or heard anything about it?
The report say it would shape kind like a cigar.

Kanaka (monologue) :
Uh, she's talking about the Bathyscaphe.

Kanaka :
N-Nope, can't say that I have.

Yagi :
I see.

Kanaka :
But even if your sources are right, it may not even show up tonight.
Why don't you go home and get some sleep?

Yagi :
Yeah, I know, but I'll stay here for days if I have to, I need that picture!

Kanaka :
For days?

Yagi :
ahchi (Sneeze)!

Kanaka :
Why don't you call it quits for now?
You're going to catch a cold out here.
Plus, if you stay out too late, your parents are going to scold you won't they?
You don't wanna get in the trouble?

Yagi :
Nothing to worry about there.
No one's home but me.

Kanaka :
Hey, Bathyscaphe, fly around a little?
I want to let this girl have her pictures.

Bathyscaphe :
No, miss Kanaka.
I told you that before.

Kanaka :
Just this once.
Please?

Bathyscaphe :
I said no.

Kanaka :
But if we leave her here, she's going to catch a cold.
Oh, I know!

If you won't fly, then just project some random image in the sky with lots of lights, Ok?

Bathyscaphe :
Well, I suppose I could.

Kanaka :
Whoa!
Isn't that it!?
Look at glowing!
Hurry up!
Take the picture!

Yagi :
I got it!
Hey, did you see?

Maruo :
What the heck's that?

Yagi :
W-what, can't you tell?
It's a picture of a UFO.
I finally successfully took a photo of it last night.
What now?

Maruo :
It's a flounder.
A flat one, at that.

Yagi :
Are you saying I'm a liar?
I saw it with my own two eyes, you know!
There was even a girl there who saw it with me.

Maruo :
Yes, yes, I'm sure you did.
You know, that reminds me of something Kazuto said…

Kazuto :
So you're starting Jr. High today, Kanaka?
I thought for sure you'd be in elementary School.

Kanaka :
Elementary, what?

Kazuto :
It's nothing.

Narue :
Big sister, will you really be okay on your own?
It's your first time here, I'm just a little worried.

Kanaka :
Don't sweat it there kid.
I'm still kind of older than you.
So quit treating me like a child.

Maruo :
Hey, Kazuto!

Narue :
I gotta go, Kazu.
I'll see you after class, ok?

Kazuto :
Narue, wait!

Maruo :
Great timing came in.

Kazuto :
Huh?

Maruo :
Am I crazy you, did you once tell me that you saw a fleet of spaceships?

Kazuto :
Uh-hm.

Yagi :
What!?
Really!?
Then, will you take a look at this picture?
I don't know if it's the same one that you saw.

Maruo :
I told her it wasn't.
Looks like a fish to me.

Yagi :
But you've never seen one, have you!?
So, get lost jerk!

Maruo :
Whatever.

Kazuto :
This is different from the ones that I saw.

Yagi :
I see.
Well, maybe it's a ship from a different planet.
Thanks.
You were a big help, Kazuto.

Kazuto :
I've got a question.
Yagi, do you not get along with Narue or something?

Yagi :
Well, not exactly, I just can't stand the way Nanase uses the whole I am an alien thing as a way to gain popularity with everybody.

Kazuto :
But Narue isn't the kind of girl who…

Yagi :
Ok, first, where and when did you see these spaceships?
Tell me!
I gotta know.
How many were there?
And their color?
How fast were they?

Hey, wait!
How were you able to see them!?
At least tell me their shape!
Was it a saucer or was it a cigar?

Kazuto :
Forget that!
We have to hurry!

Yagi :
Forget…?
Are you crazy?
Which is more important?
UFO's or being late for some stupid class!?

Kazuto :
hey you okay?

Kyoko :
Look!
Isn't that Nanase's boyfriend with Professor Sci-Fi?

Yuki :
IT IS!
There, this is good.

Aya :
This is an absolute gossip gold mine!

Kanaka :
My name is Kanaka Nanase.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

Kanaka's classmember 1 :
Nanase, you've such nice hair.
I'm so jealous.

Kanaka's classmember 2 :
You're just cute as a button.

Kanaka :
You're so sweet!
Thanks very much.

Kanaka's classmember 3 :
So, what are you into?

Kanaka's classmember 1 :
Where did you move here from?

Kanaka :
Well, I…

Kanaka (in mind):
Please use discretion and do not divulge our secrets.

Kanaka :
I came on the ship from a foreign country.

Kanaka's classmember 4 :
On a ship!?

Kanaka's classmember 5 :
Wow, you must be rich!

Kanaka (in mind):
Um, maybe that wasn't best thing to say.

Kanaka's classmember 4 :
Where are you going for tutoring?

Kanaka's classmember 5 :
What kind of bands do you like?

Kanaka's classmember 6 :
What kind of games do you like?

Kanaka :
Oh, sorry, I don't really know.

Kanaka's classmember 7 :
Hey, look up, note for you

Kanaka :
W-What the hell is this!?

Math Teacher :
What's wrong?

Kanaka :
Uh, nothing.

Narue :
Hey, Sis!

Kanaka :
What's up?

Narue :
Nothing.
I was just seeing how you were doing so far.

Kanaka :
Don't worry about it.
I'm doing just fine!
I'm having a lot of fun!

Narue :
Really?
I'm glad to hear it.
If you have any questions or if you're in trouble, let me know, ok?

Kanaka :
Mm.

Narue :
See you later.

Yagi :
What the hell is this?
What's the meaning of this?

Kyoko :
What, are you saying we're liars?
We saw you and Nanase's boyfriend coming into the school this morning looking mighty cosy.

Yuki :
He was even helping you up, ever so gently, I might add.

Aya :
I know, you were just bullying Nanase, so you can get to her boyfriend!

Yagi :
No, you've got it all wrong!
I just wanted to ask him some things about UFO's!
Taht's all.

N-Nanase, you don't believe these rumors, right?

Aya :
What's with that cheek?

Kyoko :
That damn Nanase.



Eye Catch: The world of Narue (成恵の世界) 05



Yagi :
Hey, are you…
We met last night!

Kanaka :
That's right.
You are the stalker!

Yagi :
Please don't say that out loud, ok?
Anyway, check out the picture I took last night!
Not bad, if I do say so myself.
What is it?

Kanaka :
N-Nothing.
Um, this picture is really well taken!

Yagi :
Isn't it so?

Kanaka (in mind) :
Bathyscaphe, couldn't you have chosen something better?

Yagi :
Kanaka, right?
Aren't you gonna go play with your friends?

Kanaka :
No, I'm new to your planet… uh, country, and I don't really know any of your games or bands or anything.
So I can't seem to relate to any of my classmates.

Yagi :
So what does that matter?

Kanaka :
Oh, so they send me mean letters, scribble nasty things on my desk…
I step on thumbtacks, my slippers are stolen, they break my pencil case, ignore me, won't eat lunch with me…
They look at me like I'm some kind of freak!
I have to ask you!
What the HELL is wrong with the educational system in this damn country!?
I just want to beat them all to a pulp!

Yagi :
Oh, Kanaka…
Hey listen, if you're not doing anything later, do you want to come over my house today?
My games are kind of old, but they're still pretty fun.
And if you really wanna learn, I can teach you almost anything you want to know about this country.

Kanaka :
Is that so, Senpai?
(*Senpai(先輩) = upperclassman)

Yagi :
Oh, quit the senpai thing.
My name is Hajime Yagi.

Kanaka :
Well, you can count me in, Hajime!

Yagi :
Then, let's get going, Kanaka!

Narue :
Oh, what the heck, I'll splurge today.
We have to celebrate Kanaka's first day.

Yagi :
Umm, would you like something to drink?
We really don't have much here since I rarely have any friends over anything.

Kanaka :
Anything is fine.

Yagi :
I'll bring something right up.

See?

Kanaka :
Wow!

Cleared it!

Yagi :
So, what do you think?
Fun, right?

Kanaka :
Well, Kinda low tech actually, and lacks realism, but not bad, I guess.

Yagi :
That's a harsh assessment.

Kanaka :
Hey, but at least I can use this in conversation.

Yagi :
Glad to hear it.

Kanaka :
Uh, yesterday when you said that no one else ever was at home, were you serious?

Yagi :
My parents are divorced, and I'm living with my mom.
But my mom's always working and she's almost never home.

Kanaka :
Oh, I was all alone with my caregiver, Bathyscaphe, for a long time too.
Although recently I got a baby sister.

Yagi :
Bathyscaphe? That's the same name as a famous submarine, you know.

Kanaka :
Is it really?

Yagi :
Yeah.
A deep seek explorer named Piccard.
He set the world's depth record piloting it.

Kanaka :
Wow, Hajime!
You're really smart!
I'm impressed.

Yagi :
This is all that I'm good at, which probably why I don't have too many friends.

Kanaka :
So, you’re really saying you don't have any friends?

Yagi :
Yeah, it's pretty much true, I'm always into my books.
I'm not much fun to hang out with, I guess.

Kanaka :
Hey, that's not true at all!
You're intelligent and interesting.
You're the nicest person I’ve met since I moved here.

Yagi :
You're the first person to ever say that to me.

Narue :
Big sister sure is late.
I hope she didn't get lost on the way home.
But if so, she should be able to teleport here right?
I wonder what's wrong.

Bathyscaphe :
There's no need to worry, Miss Narue.

Narue :
Do you know where she is?

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka was invited to a friend's house after school today.
I think her name is Miss Hajime Yagi.

Narue :
Yagi!?

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Narue?

Kanaka :
Well, Hajime, thanks for everything!

Yagi :
You're very welcome.

Kanaka :
Can I come over again some time?

Yagi :
Of course, whenever you like!

Kanaka :
Narue, what are you doing here?
Did Bathyscaphe send you here to pick me up?
What's…

Yagi :
Listen Nanase, the thing with me and Iizuka isn't true.

Kanaka :
Do you know her?

Narue :
So now you're gonna sink your claws in my big sister?

Yagi :
Big sister?

Narue :
Listen Yagi, I don't care what you do to me, but leave my sister out of your twisted hobbies!

Yagi :
But I… , but I never meant to…

Kanaka :
Hang on, Narue, what's going on?
Hey, stop it, Narue!

Yagi :
So she was related to Nanase.

Bathyscaphe :
Welcome home girls.

Kanaka :
Narue!
What the hell are you trying to pull!?

Narue :
Kanaka, she's only trying to find out whether I'm really an alien, you know?
I can't believe she's trying to sink her teeth into…

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Kanaka!

Kanaka :
Are you stupid!?
Hajime didn't even know we were related!
She was my only real friend!
She was nice to me.
She listened when everyone else was giving me nothing but grief!
You don't know a thing about Hajime!
You jerk!
Narue, you jerk!

Narue :
If she was having trouble, she could have at least said something.

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Narue.
What Miss Kanaka said is absolutely true.

Narue :
It's a lie.
She's just using her.
I know it.

Bathyscaphe :
Miss Narue, have you ever stopped to take a close look at Miss Yagi?
What you see frequently is not always her true nature.
She hides the truth well.

Narue :
What are you talking about?

Bathyscaphe :
She acts strong, but in reality, she is actually very Ionely.
Don't you think she is much like you and Miss Kanaka?

Miss Kanaka?

Kanaka :
What?

Bathyscaphe :
Please try to think of Miss Narue's feelings as well.
She has been very, very worried about you, you know.

Kanaka :
Yeah, I know, but I can't say, "I'm being picked on, what should I do?" to my little sister!
I'm supposed to be the big sister.

Narue (in recall) :
She was my only real friend!
She was nice to me.
She listened when everyone else was giving me nothing but grief!
You don't know a thing about Hajime!
You jerk!
Narue, you jerk!

Kazuto :
Hey, how come we're taking the wrong way?

Kanaka :
Less talking, more walking.

Yagi :
Well, thank goodness, I look even uglier than normal today.
No, I'm not giving in!

Kanaka :
Hi, good morning, Hajime!

Yagi :
Oh, Kanaka!

Kanaka :
Go on.

Let's go, old man.

Kazuto :
What about the two of them?

Kanaka :
Oh, never mind them.

Narue :
I…

Yagi :
I…

Narue & Yagi :
I just…

Narue :
I-I'm really sorry about yesterday.

Yagi :
Oh, it's okay.

By the way, how come you call Kanaka "Big sister", even though she's younger than you are?

Narue :
Well… I, uh…

Yagi :
Something's fishy there.

Kanaka :
Hajime! Don't nose into other people's family matters!

Yagi :
I don't think so.
Something is definitely fishy.

Kanaka :
Let it go, Hajime!

Kanaka :
But it bothers me.

Kanaka :
Drop it!



Next Episode :

Narue :
What!?
Kazu's walking with a girl and holding her hand!

Why?
Why!?
Who is she!?

My chest hurts.
What's wrong with me?
