Kazuto :
My name is Kazuto Iizuka.
An average 14-year-old, middle schooler.
Her name is Narue Nanase, and she recently became my girlfriend.
She goes to the same middle school as me in Sakuranomachi.
But she's not your average girl.
She's super strong, and she saved me from dangerous creatures, and she used teleportation to beat the criminal!
She even showed me a huge fleet of starships!
That's right.
My girlfriend, Narue, is an alien!



Episode 03 : A Secret Base for Two



Narue :
Yeah, this isn't just a headband.
It's really a forward connector.

Kazuto :
Forward connector…
I always thought you had some kind of ESP and that's how you were teleporting.

Narue :
That's not it.
I'm connected to a starship orbiting the Earth.

Kazuto :
Up in orbit?
Narue, do you have to fight the mutant space invaders?

Narue :
Mutant invaders?
Uh-uh.

Kazuto :
Then how about that alien?

Narue :
Oh, that was terrorist.
They don't really care for galactic federation being on Earth.

Kazuto :
How come?

Narue :
I honestly don't know.

Kazuto :
Oh, Ok.
That must be a real pain in the butt.

Narue :
Yeah, I guess, but at least I have this.

Kazuto :
True.

Narue :
Yeah, there's somewhere I wanna go, I can go anytime!

Kazuto :
Hm

Narue :
Kazu.

Kazuto :
What is it?

Narue :
There's somewhere I really wanna go, right now!

Kazuto :
Huh?
Where?

Narue :
To your house!

Kazuto :
Whaaaaat?!

Narue :
So, this is where you live?
It's nice!

Kazuto :
Yeah, I guess.

I'm home!

C-come on in.

Kazuto' mother :
Welcome home.
You're early.
Oh my, who is this?

Kazuto :
This is Narue Nana… Naru…

Narue :
How are you?
I'm Narue Nanase.

Kazuto' mother :
What?
WHAT!?
Oh, welcome!
Welcome to our home!
This is the first time Kazuto has ever brought home a girl!
Your name is Narue Nanase?
Oh, please, come on in.

Kazuto!
I certainly hope you cleaned your room.

Oh, I should get some tea ready!

Kazuto :
Mom!
That's enough!
Cut it out!

These stairs are kind of tricky, so be careful.

Kazuto's sister :
Huh?
Kazuto is home already?

Narue :
Wow, it's so nice!
Are you really rich?

Kazuto's sister :
That sounds like a girl!

Kazuto :
Oh, it's not like that at all.
So, this is my room.
Come on in.

Narue :
Thanks Kzau!
Wow, so this is your room!

Kazuto :
Yeah, sorry it's so messy though.

Kazuto's sister :
W-w-wha…
MOM, what the hell is going on!?

Kazuto' mother :
Stop yelling!

Kazuto :
Jeez, I can't believe them…

Narue :
What's this?
Naked identical samples?

Kazuto :
No, I-it's nothing really!
It's got my comic book collection!
And clean it up!

Narue :
Uh!

Kazuto :
What would you wanna do now?

Narue :
Wow! You have a computer!

Kazuto :
Yeah, it was my dad's.

Narue :
Oh, can I touch it?

Kazuto :
Sure, go ahead.

Narue :
Umm.
Um, Hello there.
Computer, will you please respond?

Kazuto :
Uh… Narue?

Narue :
Yes?
It's buzzing!
Is it gonna be okay?

Kazuto :
Yeah, Just wait a bit.
It's an older model, so sometimes takes a little longer to get moving.

Narue :
It moves!?

Kazuto :
Don't worry.
It's only the OS.

Narue :
Um, OS?

Kazuto :
H-how should I explain this…
Are you afraid of machines, Narue?

Narue :
Yeah… I can't even touch the school computers.
They look so fragile!

Kazuto :
Don't worry.
They won't break from just touching them.
It should be soon now.

Narue :
Okay…

Kazuto' Mother :
Having fun, kids?
Here we go, tea is served!
We didn't have any tea so I hope you like coffee!
Now, what are you two doing?
Kazuto, have her sit down.
My apologies, Narue dear.
The house is a mess.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I must be making such a pest of myself!
Enjoy yourselves!

Kazuto :
S-sorry about that!
Here, have a seat.

Narue :
Mm.
I-I er.

Kazuto' Mother :
I'm sorry, I forgot the spoons.
You can't drink coffee without the spoons.
I'm so careless sometimes.

Kazuto :
Jeez… What is up with her?
Oh, it's working.

Narue :
What's wrong?

Kazuto :
It's just a default w-wallpaper…
Now, you think it all.
I was checking m-my settings…
I-It's an accident!
I swear.
I just…

Narue :
Who's that Kazu?

Kazuto :
AH!!
W-wait one second.
I’ll,..I'll delete it!!
Damn this Windows 99!

Kazuto's sister :
So?
So?
How is it going?
Kazuto is totally freaking out up there!

Kazuto's mother :
Not too well I'm afraid.
Don't you have a cold?
Go upstairs and rest!

Kazuto's sister :
W-what are you saying?
My little brother brought a girl home!
It may never happen again!
There's no way I'm gonna sleep through this one!

Kazuto's mother :
That's true enough, I suppose.

Kazuto's sister :
So, what's he doing?

Kazuto's mother :
Oh, You know, that boy is just like your father…

Kazuto's sister :
Oh, god!
It's hopeless, isn't it?

Kazuto :
Ah, here have some coffee.

Narue :
Thank you Kazu.
I think I will.
You know?

Kazuto :
Hm?

Narue :
This is my first time being in someone's house.

Kazuto :
Huh?

Narue :
Because I'm an alien.

Kazuto :
B-but, that doesn't matter to me!

Narue :
I know you feel that way now, Kazu. 
But there was that incident with the terrorist and they could be more of them you know?

Kazuto :
Yeah, But you defeated that guy so easily, Narue.

Narue :
That's because he only had a small weapon.
Threats from larger weapons are usually handled by the Head Inspector.

Kazuto :
I heard you mentioned that person before.
What exactly is the Head Inspector?

Narue :
Uh!

Kazuto :
Uh, Narue?

Narue :
Hey!
It's a whale!

Kazuto :
Oh, Yeah.
That is the screensaver.
I have it on slide show.

Narue :
Screensaver?

Kazuto :
Yeah. It's so the images don't burn onto the screen.
Do you like whales, Narue?

Narue :
Uh-hm!
They're so cool!

Kazuto :
I can print it out for you.
Would you like that?

Narue :
Really!?
Oh, thank you!

Kazuto :
Here, it's all done.

Narue :
Thank you.
Wow…
I'm so happy!
I'll treasure it!

Kazuto :
It's okay.
It's really not that big of a deal.

Narue :
Mm-hm, it's really great.
Besides, my mom always used to say…
What you get isn't as important as who is giving it to you.

Kazuto :
Who is giving it to you?

Narue :
Mm-hm!
So I'll treasure this.

Kazuto's sister :
Hello there!

Kazuto :
Yeah, Sis!!

Kazuto's sister :
Let's have some cookies.

Kazuto :
You can't just come barging in here!

Kazuto's sister :
Sorry to come in dressed like this.
I took a day off work so I was feeling a little under the weather.

Kazuto :
You're resting for a hangover!!

Kazuto's sister :
Hey, what are you doing?

Kazuto :
Now, will you just get out of here!

Kazuto's sister :
Have a good time!

Kazuto :
S-sorry, it's not very relaxing.

Narue :
It's fun when it's rowdy.

Kazuto :
Yeah, I guess…

Narue :
Mm-hm, It's just dad and me at home.
I really envy you and your family.

Kazuto :
They're not so bad.
They're just can’t help but be nosy…



Eye Catch: The world of Narue (成恵の世界) 03



Kazuto (in mind) :
What do I do, now?
We ran out of things to talk about.
What should I do?
Oh, I know!

Kazuto :
Hey, Narue.

Narue :
Huh?

Kazuto :
Do you wanna watch an anime?

Narue :
Anime?

Kazuto :
This is one of my absolute favorites.
Magical Girl No 4.

Narue :
Magical Girl No 4?

Kazuto :
You never heard of it?
She rocks!
Their bodies, er, their battles are pretty intense.
Do you wanna see some?

Narue :
Uh-hm!

Narration (in Anime) :
This is a request from No 4.
When watching anime, make the room bright, and don't sit too close!

Narue :
That's amazing!
You can watch it right here on your computer!

Manaka (in Anime) :
Kei!
Kei!
Kei!!
Kei-chan!
Kei!
Kei!
Kei!

Kei (in Anime) :
Ma-na-ka, it's you.

Manaka (in Anime) :
Thank goodness, Kei!
Why are you here alone!

Kei (in Anime) :
Manaka, I'm sorry.

Manaka (in Anime) :
Kei-chan! No!

Enemy witch (in Anime) :
How fragile!
I guess this is the best you could do!

Manaka (in Anime) :
I'll never forgive you.
I swear it! 
You pay for this!
Armor!!
I'm a Magic Girl who fights for love and peace!
They call me Magical Girl No 4.
It's a direct hit to your heart!

Kazuto :
Oh, way here we'll just get pass the opening…

Narration (in Anime) :
30th Battle. The Magic of Fear, Part 2.

Kazuto :
This story is really popular, even among the typical picky anime fans who only watch subtitle versions.
It's obvious when you consider the armor scene isn't a bank but a brand new animation.

Narue :
What’s a bank?

Enemy witch (in Anime) :
If you fire too many shots, your soul will be devoured by magic.

Kazuto :
Well, normally you see, for this transformation scene here, they recycled the same animation over and over again.
Week after week after week.
That was called the "bank."

Narue :
I see…

Enemy witch (in Anime) :
Despite the fact that you are not a Knight.
You fought well until now.

Kazuto :
Ah, look here!
This scene is really good.
Right there. The flames are really beautiful.

Manaka (in Anime) :
Maximum Bullet!!

Kei (in Anime) :
Manaka!

Manaka (in Anime) :
Kei!

Enemy witch (in Anime) :
Why won't you just die!?

Kazuto :
The last part is really good too.

Kei (in Anime) :
We actually made it.

Manaka (in Anime) :
Of course, we did!
A Magical Girl of Love and Peace can't be killed that easily!
You should know that!

Kei (in Anime) :
You know, I was gonna mention this to you earlier…

Manaka (in Anime) :
Huh? What is it, Kei?

Kei (in Anime) :
When you transform, your personality really changes too.

Manaka (in Anime) :
That's not your business!

Kei (in Anime) :
Are you sure?

Kazuto :
I love this more every time I see it.

Narue :
You've watched this how many times, now?

Kazuto :
Huh…? Oh… Lots...

Narue :
You must really like it.

Kazuto :
Wow, it's late afternoon already.

Narue :
Time sure does fly.

Kazuto :
Let's turn on the lights.

Kazuto's mother :
More coffee anymore…
What are you doing!?
Your room is so dark.
Turn on the lights!
I'm so sorry, Narue dear.
He's not a very sensitive boy.
I'll get more coffee for you two, Ok?

Were you watching cartoons again!?
Miss Nanase is here and you're watching cartoons!?
How fool!

I'm sorry he's like that.
Please don't hate him for this.
Please.

Can't you at least stop watching anime while your friends are over?

Kazuto's sister :
Dumbass.

Kazuto :
Yeah, all right, whatever, just get out of my room!

S-sorry…

Narue :
Hey, Kazu?

Kazuto :
Huh?

Narue :
This time I'll show you my secret spot!

Kazuto :
Where are we?

Narue :
My most important spot.

Kazuto :
Important?
H-hey!
Wait up, Narue!
Wait up, Narue!
Oww…

Narue :
Um, are you okay?

Kazuto :
I'm okay… Yeah...
It's incredible!
Narue, do you like constellations?

Narue :
Uh-hm, I love Earth because it's where I was born.

Kazuto :
Huh?

Narue :
I don't really care about the far away stars at night.
I only think of the Moon as a big floating hunk of rock.
Somewhere out in the starry sky is my father's homeland, but

I was born here. So, it's my home.
That's why, no matter how pretty it is, I just close my eyes and lie still.

Kazuto :
But, how come?
If you aren't going to look at stars, why come out here?

Narue :
When I lie under the night sky, and I don't see the moon or the stars…
I feel like all that's left is just me and the Earth.
It's like, it's like space doesn't even matter at all anymore.
I've always come here alone.

Kazuto :
Ok, then I'll try it too.

Narue :
Are you cold?

Kazuto :
No, I'm okay. Your hand is nice and warm, Narue.

Narue :
Yours too, Kazu.

Kazu, if you really fall asleep here, you'll catch cold.
Kazu?
What the?
This is a Time Stasis Shield!
B-but why is this?

Your hard work is appreciated, inspector.

Tail Messa :

No need to be so formal, Narue Nanase

Narue :
Disregarding our poor personal finances sir, we have reported nothing and learned nothing new.

Tail Messa :
It seems to me.
You gave him more information than necessary.
The Galaxy Federation does not allow Galaxy citizens to inhabit the Planet Earth.
I know I have said this before, but we would very much like you and Tadashi Nanase to leave at some point in the future, and return to the Planet Nihon.

Narue :
But I… I was born here on Earth.

Tail Messa :
Please, never forget that the planet Earth is a very special place indeed.

Kazuto :
What the?
But I…
That's strange.

Kazuto (in mind) :
What you get isn't as important as who is giving it to you.
Narue…



Next Episode :

Narue :
Kazu's sister sure is a lot of fun.
I wish I had someone like that.
What!?
I have a sister too!?
Dad, why didn't you tell me?
Next time on The World of Narue,

"My Younger Older Sister"

It's a direct hit to your heart.
