Kazuto :
And, and, when I got up my courage, I asked Narue if she'd go out with me, and she said yes!

Maruo :
Uh-oh.

Kazuto :
And you know what?
Narue is really strong and a great fighter.
She can defeat the bad guys with one shot!

Maruo :
Hmm… And?

Kazuto :
And sometimes I just can't figure out what she's thinking, but that's okay.
Plus she's an alien.

Maruo :
Hmm?

Kazuto :
So I was thinking I'd ask her to a movie this weekend.
Maruo, what's wrong?

Maruo :
Were you serious?

Kazuto :
Mm!
I worked hard to get tickets.
Check it out, Sabara!

Maruo :
That's not what I mean.

Kazuto :
Huh?
Well, I did have to get an advance on my allowance.

Maruo :
NO, dude!
I mean the alien thing.

Kazuto :
Mm-hm, I got to see a whole fleet of amazing spaceships.
Narue's dad is part of the Earth Observation Team for the Galaxy Federation!
Hey, you shouldn't judge people by their lifestyle or their race.

Maruo :
You are completely missing the point.

Kazuto :
I hope Narue will go with me.
Hey, Maruo, it'll be okay, right?

Narue :
Kazu!

Kazuto :
Hey, good morning, Narue!

Narue :
Hi!
Good Morning, Kazu!




Episode 02 : The First Date!



Yuki :
So how about the guy with the skateboard?
Are you dating him too?

Kyoko :
Oh, come now!
Don't say that!
I'm just playing the field!
That's all.
Oh, guess what? He keeps telling me I'm the one!

Yuki :
Oh, I'm so jealous!

Aya :
Kyoko, you're too much.

Kyoko :
Hey, Nanase.
So, tell me.
Do you have a boyfriend?

Aya :
She's just an alien without any friends!
How's she’s gonna get a boyfriend?

Kyoko :
Oh, maybe I'm mistaken, then…
But weren't you walking with your boyfriend the other day?

Narue :
Huh?

Kyoko :
And add eight legged alien freak?

Aya :
A perfect pair!

A Class man :
Nanase!
Here's visitor for you.

Kazuto :
Hi, Narue!

Narue :
Kazu!
Hey, what's up?

Kazuto :
Am, would you mind coming with me?

Narue :
What is it?

Kyoko :
Ha, Nanase you freak.
Professor Sci-fi!

Yagi :
What!?

Kyoko :
Your favorite alien went off somewhere with a boy!
What do you think of that?

Yuki :
Aliens sure are popular!

Aya :
Too bad for you!

Yagi :
Oh, shut up!! Nanase is such a faker!
You're all being fooled by her!
What part of her even remotely looks alien!?


Narue :
What is it, Kazu?

Kazuto :
Yeah! W-well, I…
N-Narue?

Narue :
Yes!

Kazuto :
I got some tickets to a movie.
Would you like to go with me tomorrow?
It's a really cool sci-fi movie called Sabara.
Man!
I just can't wait to see it.
Oh, m-maybe you're not interested in this kind of thing.
S-sorry.

Narue :
No, I'd love to go!

Kazuto :
Really!?


Kazuto :
Maruo!

Maruo :
Hey, how’d it go, stud?

Kazuto :
I did it, Maruo!
I did it!
She said yes!

Maruo :
Very good, grasshopper.
Now comes the important part.
Do not take this advice lightly.
Far too many people have screwed up their first date and get dumped.

Kazuto :
Huh?
For real?

Maruo :
Don't be naive!!
Peacocks with bad feathers, hummingbirds who can't build a nest, roosters who can't catch worms, woodpeckers who don’t peck wood!
Hear me Kazuto, they all died bachelors, everyone!!

Kazuto :
Yeah, but I'm not a bird!

Maruo :
Human or bird, it doesn't matter.
In any species the female always chooses the most impressive male!
It's genetic!
Kazuto, that means you too, my good man!
That is, if you call yourself a man.

Kazuto :
I-I don't know what to do on a date!
This one's my first.
What if I screw up, my god, she’ll hate me!

Maruo :
Tut, Tut, Tut.
Let the love guru give you some pointers.

Kazuto :
Oh, really!?

Maruo :
Lesson number One!
Always be punctual!
You should always show up before her.
Now, write it down!

Kazuto :
Y-yes, sir!

Maruo :
Okay.
It's time for Lesson Two!
Don't put too much crap in your hair.
Shampoo your hair, and for God’s sake, use conditioner.
Of course, make sure to wash every other part of you as well, with soap!

Every Classmate :
With soap!

Maruo :
No matter how good the mood, if you have protruding nose hair, it's over [rover].
Check yourself thoroughly and if you see anything sticking out, yank it.
Pay for everything on the date!
Do not let her pay for a thing!
Losers go dutch.

Every Classmate :
Losers

Maruo :
Lesson Three!
No video games!
If you play them you may potentially isolate the girl!
At the movies, buy popcorn.

Yagi's mother :
Hello, Hajime?
It's mom.
I had to go on a sudden business trip.
I'm actually calling from the bullet train.
I should be back tomorrow.
See you!

Kazuto :
Silky soft hair, remember to use soap.
Silky soft hair, remember to use soap.
Silky soft hair, remember to use soap.
OUCH!!!

Yagi :
Ah, a sky full of twinkling star sure is soothing.

Maruo…

Maruo :
Yo.

Yagi :
Keep it down!
Here I am pouring my heart out to the cosmos, and you're there spoiling my mood with that noisy thing!
Go play somewhere else.

Maruo :
Relax!
Don't say that.
Actually, I was just serenading the heavens to wish Kazuto good luck on his first date tomorrow!
Hey, Yagi?
Why don't you join me in a duet?
Maybe if we are good, a UFO might come down and whisk us away.

Yagi :
Shut up! Why the hell is everyone making fun of me!?
God!

Marou :
What she mean, everyone?

Kazuto :
Be punctual, pay for the date, no games, popcorn at the movies.
And at the end, say,
"Thanks. I had a great time today!"

Narue (a Kazuto's Imagine) :
Thank you so much, Kazu.
I had a lot of fun today.

Kazuto :
I can't wait!
Let's see. Be punctual, pay for the date, no games…



Eye Catch: The world of Narue (成恵の世界) 02



Kazuto :
Oh god, I’d better hurry!
I overslept!
Good, looks like she's not here yet.
Well I, guess I successfully cleared phase one.
So it's on to the phase two…

Narue :
Hi, Kazu!

Kazuto :
N-Narue! You were here already!?

Narue :
Mm-hm.

Kazuto :
I was going to come earlier…
Narue, she's not in uniform.
She looks great!

Narue :
What, Kazu?
Come on, let's go!

Kazuto :
Year!

Narue :
Oh.

Kazuto :
Is, um, everything okay, Narue?

Narue :
I have always wanted to come here!

Kazuto :
What?
B-but, Narue!

Maruo (In Kazuto's imagine) :
No video games!
If you play them you may potentially isolate the girl!

Kazuto :
W-what now.

Narue :
Kazu, let's play.
Okay, n-now, I just have to remember I can't get too caught up in the game, and start ignoring her or she'll dump me!

Staff of NcDonald's :
Here you are, and thank you very much for coming to NcDonald’s.

Kazuto :
Oh, let me get it.

Narue :
Oh, no, Kazu.
We're going Dutch.
Don't you agree Kazu?
Boys and girls should always keep separate wallets.
That way it won't become a problem later on.

Kazuto :
I see, I didn't know.

Narue :
It's a basic rule in a relationship.

Kazuto (in mind) :
I'll nail this next step, for sure!

Maruo :
Mm, smart boy, following my advice to the letter I see.

Yagi :
Maruo, What are you doing here?
What's with the getup?
What do you with the government?
Aren't you warm in that?

Maruo :
I, w-well, see.
Today, I'm a shadowy agent deep undercover to make sure that his best friend's date goes well.
The rest is classified.

Yagi :
I see.
Loser.

Maruo :
Hey, don't say that…
It's Kazuto's very first date!
And it's apparently with a real alien!

Or so we have us believe…

Yagi :
Where?!
Where is she?
Where is that alien!?
It couldn't be…

That big faker!

Oh, I see now.
I get it.
So that was your ploy I call?

H-hey!

Narue :
Let's go.

Kazuto :
hm.

Yagi :
Narue Nanase!

Kazuto :
Who's she?

Narue :
Hajime Yagi.
She's in our class.

Yagi :
I get it now, you rotten phony alien!
You call yourself an alien to make yourself the "non-conformist girl…"
so you can gain popularity with the boys!
Listen up, buster.
You're being fooled by her little song and dance act!

Kazuto :
Huh?

Yagi :
I mean, look at you!
No matter what you tell people you're obviously human!
According to eyewitnesses in West Virginia, aliens are at least 3 meters tall!
It's even been documented in Ultimate UFO DVD collection that the aliens, who visited England, have giant wings on their backs, and shoot lasers from their antennae!
How could you possibly expect anyone to believe you are an alien!
You're… clueless loser!

Maruo :
Oh man…

Narue :
Oh, Kazu, the movie is going to start soon, isn't it?
We better get going, OK?

Yagi :
See!
She can't say anything in her defense!
You charlatan!

Maruo :
Sorry for the disturbance, folks!

Kazuto :
Hey there, Narue.
You allright?

Narue :
I'm allright.
That was a bit awkward.

Kazuto :
That person… Yagi, was it?
Is she like that at school?

Narue :
Yeah, it's pretty strange, as soon as she sees me, she tells me to prove I'm a real alien.
I just don't understand her.

Kazuto :
Oh, I see…

Narue :
Let's not talk about her anymore, OK?
The movie is going to start soon.
Why don't we go inside and grab a seat.

Kazuto :
Yeah.
Uh-oh.

Narue :
What's the matter, Kazu?

Kazuto :
Um, It's so strange.
I'm so sure I put the ticket here in my pocket…

Narue :
You don't have the tickets?

Kazuto :
Y-yeah… I wonder what happened.

Narue :
Well, we ran here, so you might have dropped them on the way.

Kazuto :
That's true!
I'll take a look.
Wait here…

Narue :
Kazu!

Kazuto :
Ah, there's no way that it'll be here.
It's our first date!
I'm such an idiot!
So stupid!

Maruo (In Kazuto's recollection) :
If she says, "Thank you.
I had a great time," then your date was a success.

Kazuto :
Ah… this really sucks.

Narue :
There'll be quicker with both of us looking., Kazu.

Kazuto :
Thanks, Narue…

Oh, that's strange…
I think it was when we were running around somewhere…

Narue :
Yeah, maybe.

Kazuto :
I'm a klutz.
I'm sorry

Narue :
No, it's probably my fault for making you run so fast.

Narue (In Kazuto's recollection) :
Why can't I win?

Kazuto :
Maybe at the arcade…
That's it!
The arcade!

Narue :
Wait!

Kazuto :
What is it, Narue?

Narue :
Kazu, over here!

Kazuto :
W-what is the problem?

Narue :
It's faster this way. With this.

Kazuto :
That's true…

Oh!
E-excuse me.
Did anyone turn in some movie tickets, they are in a brown envelope?

A clerk :
Uh, yeah, these then?

Kazuto :
Ah!
That's it!
Thank you so much.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
ha ha ha
Thank you!

Narue!
They had tickets!

Narue :
Then we should go.
We can make it if we hurry.

We made it.

Kazuto :
Uh-oh.
And, it's all thanks to you.
Oh, did you want any milk soda or popcorn or anything?

Narue :
No, I'm good.
I'm just a little tired from all that running around we’ve been doing today.

Kazuto :
Yeah, sorry…

Actor1 in Sabara movie :
Look!
It's Saba!
A whole bunch of Saba!

Actress in Sabara movie :
Sabara (is) coming…

Actor2 in Sabara movie :
Sabara?

Actor1 in Sabara movie :
Quick!
Someone call the governor!

Actor2 in Sabara movie (imitating Schwartzenegger) :
Ja, I'm already here!
Sabara, it’s time to get your ass [devoured].
Hasta la vista, baby!

Actress in Sabara movie :
Oh, governor.
[xxxxxxx]!

Actor2 in Sabara movie :
[xxxxxxx]!
I’m very hungry!

Actress in Sabara movie :
[xxxxx], govener.
[xxxxx]

Actor2 in Sabara movie :
I'll be back, see you at [xxxxx]!
Now, get to the chopper!


Kazuto (In mind) :
Oh man, I didn't get much sleep last night.
No, no, I can't go to sleep during the movie, Narue will hate me…

W-what am I supposed to do now?
Oh, what will I do now?

Maruo :
Hm, the movie should be over pretty soon…

Whoa!
What the hell how are you doing here?

Yagi :
Isn't it obvious?
I'm trying to expose that phony alien for the fraud she is!

Maruo :
What are you getting so angry about?

Yagi :
You just don't get it, do you.
I absolutely will not forgive Nanase for pretending to be an alien just so she could become Miss Popular!
I take it as a personal insult.


Sorry, I fell asleep.
I didn't get much sleep last night…

Kazuto :
It's okay. You don't have to worry about that.

Yagi :
Nanase!

Maruo :
S-stop it!

Kazuto :
Huh?

Narue :
What?

Kazuto :
Did you just hear Yagi's voice?
Uh, Yagi!
I wonder why she's so intent on discovering who you are.

Narue :
It's okay, she doesn't seem to want to believe me anyway.
Besides…

Kazuto :
Besides?

Narue :
As long as you believe me, Kazu, the rest just doesn't matter.
Well, shall we go?

Kazuto :
Yeah.

Mauro :
Yagi…

Narue (In Yagi's recollection):
As long as you believe me, Kazu, the rest just doesn't matter.

Yagi's Mom (On the answering telephone) :
Hi, it's Mom.
My trip is going to last another two or three days.
I'm sorry honey.
I'll be sure to come with a souvenir.
Bye.

Yagi :
It's okay.
I'll be fine by myself.

Maruo?
What's wrong with you?
You want me to call the cops for breaking and entering?

Mauro :
Why don't you?
But first…
Aren't you gonna look?

Hey, Yagi.
Remember playing on this balcony when we were kids?

Yagi :
Oh, it's not like I chose to be a childhood friend, you know Maruo.
We just happened to grow up next door to each other, simply coincidence.
That's all it was.

Here we go
Just you wait.
I'll discover real aliens one day and become friends with them.
Then I'll show that Nanase the real thing!

Mauro :
Yeah!
Hey, good luck!

Narue :
Thank you so much for walking me home, Kazu.

Kazuto :
It's pretty late.
Sorry.
I-I forgot.
You don't need me around to take you home.
You can teleport back home in an instant with that head band of yours.

Narue :
Not at all, Kazu.
I'd rather walk home with you anytime, really.

Kazuto :
R-really?

Narue :
Hm

Kazuto :
N-Narue…



Next Episode :

Narue :
Wow, I finally get to see Kazu's room!
I'm so nervous!

What?
We're gonna watch anime?
What's this?
Magical Girl Number 4…

Next time on The World of Narue,
"A Secret Base For Two."

It's a direct hit to your heart.
