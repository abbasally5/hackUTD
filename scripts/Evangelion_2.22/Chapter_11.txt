 Kensuke:
 Awesome! This is so damn cool!
It's amazing that place like this even exists, I mean, to preserve the remaining of marine life 
and all the research they're doing to restore the ocean to its original state?!
 And actually letting us tour this top-secret facility?
This is the coolest thing any friends have ever done for me!

Toji:
 Thanks for the invitation, man.

Shinji:
Mr. Kaji is the one you should be thanking.


All right, kids. Gets a little complicated in here.


Aw, aw, aw, aw, aw!


I don't think I can take any more of this...




Shinji:
It's incredible!

Kensuke:
Oh my God! They're superb. I never seen anything like this!

Shinji:
So this is what the ocean looked like before the Second Impact.

Pen Pen:
Quack!

Toji:
A-ha-ha! This is crazy!

Kensuke:
Yes, this is awesome yet!

Toji:
Ooh, check out that one with a shell on its back!

Kensuke:
I think those are called “turtles.”

Toji:
“Turtles”?

Asuka:
They're acting like little children. What idiots.

Asuka:
Huh...? Humph.


I'm glad you got to come with us, Rei. So, how are you feeling?

Rei:
Better. I finished the treatments, so I'm fine now.

Shinji:
Heh, It's cramped in there. They should turn it loose in one of the bigger tanks.

Rei:
They can't. They wouldn't make it outside, they can only survive in here now.

Rei:
They're like me, that way.

Thanks for the meal!
