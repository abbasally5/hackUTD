Rei:
The Evas only mirror what's in our hearts.

Asuka:
What did you say?

Rei:
You don't have to depend on Eva. There's plenty of happiness for you in the world outside.

Asuka:
How would you know anything about it? Don't patronize me. I actually worked to be a pilot. I was selected purely because of my skills. I didn't get in
through nepotism like you did.

Rei:
I can't help that I'm tied to it. The only human connections I have are through the Eva.

Asuka:
Shut up! You are only the commander's favor because you are a sucker. His obedient little doll that does every single thing he says.

Rei:
I am not a doll.

Asuka:
Yes, you are! How could you be so damn oblivious!

Humph, you got some nerve for a doll.
I've gotta question for you. What do you really think of the idiot?

Rei:
Idiot?

Asuka:
Yeah, THE Idiot, stupid Shinji.

Rei:
What do I think?

Asuka:
As hear it.

Rei:
I am.. I'm not sure.

Asuka:
You Japanese are so reserved. Just say how you feel, damn it!


Rei:
I don't know. Although being with him makes me feel warm inside. And I.. I want him to.. to feel the same way. I want him to get along with his
father... ... and feel warm inside. That's all.

Asuka:
Is that so...

She is just as ultra-stupid idiot as he is. She doesn't even realize that she likes him!
