If I were you, I would be more concerned with that scrap-gathered prototype of an Eva.

Mari:
I'm just happy to pilot something...finally!

Kaji:
You earned it, problem child. Well, good luck.

Mari:
This is so damn exciting! Oh, man! Listen to that hum!

Operator:

Mari:
Now, then! Evangelion Provisional Unit 05, activate!

Commander-in-Chief:
The Limbo Area must be sealed and defended at all costs.
We can't let this thing escape from Acheron!
How could it possibly have breached the containment system as secure as Cocytus!

Kaji:
Not only was it possible but was it inevitable.
The fact is, mankind is simply not capable of containing the Angels on its own.
We stripped this thing down to the very bone [mass study / while we're studying].
And all that really seemed to do was make it angry enough to break [through / free of] your containment system and go rampaging through your labs.
So then, good luck!
