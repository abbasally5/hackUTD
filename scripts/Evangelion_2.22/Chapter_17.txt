Asuka:
I'm almost there.

Rei:
Unit-02, get the core.

Asuka:
I know that, damn it. I don't stand you giving me orders.
Did I miss? That damn thing's scurrying around. Thirty seconds left.

Shinji:
Asuka, hurry.

Asuka:
I'm trying, damn it.
Where'd you come from?


Rei:
Hurry.

Asuka:
Will you both shut up?! Damn you! NOW DIE!!

Misato:
Phew, you did it. Thank you.

Aoba:
The system's back up. Incoming call from Commander Ikari.

Misato:
Patch him through.

My apologies, Commander. Because of decisions I made we sustained heavy damage, not only to the Evas but to the pilots as well. The responsibility is mine and mine alone, Commander.

Fuyutsuki:
It's okay. In light of the danger this target imposed, this level of damage could be considered fortunate.

Gendo:
I agree. You did well, Colonel Katsuragi.

Misato:
Thank you, sir.

Gendo:
Patch me through to Unit-01's pilot.
I heard what happened. You did very well, Shinji.

Shinji:
O, er, thank you, sir...

Gendo:
I'll leave the recovery effort to you, Colonel Katsuragi.

Misato:
Yes sir. Expedite the recovery of Evas.

Maya:
Emergency transport priority goes to Unit-01.

Asuka:
I couldn't do any thing. I was helpless on my own.

I've never not been alone.
