Shinji:
I want Rei. Give her back!

Maya:
It's getting backup? It's passed its operational limit.

Misato::
Has it gone berserk?

Ritsuko::
I don't know. I don't even know how this is possible.

Misato::
It has that kind of power?

Ritsuko::
It's transcending the boundaries of humanity.

Maya::
Plug depth has already passed 180. His life's in danger!

Ritsuko::
Shinji, please stop! You won't be able to come back.

Shinji:
I don't care what happens to me. I don't even care what happens to the world. But I'm bringing Rei back. I promise Iâ€™ll save you, Rei. Even if it's the last thing I do!

Misato::
You can do it, Shinji!

Ritsuko::
Misato?!

Misato::
Do it for yourself. Do it because this is what you want!

Shinji::
Where are you, Rei?! I'm here.

Rei:
It's no use. No, I can only survive in here now.

Shinji::
That's not true.

Rei:
It's all right. Even if I disappear, there are replacements.

Rei's sisters:
There are replacements.

Shinji::
You're wrong. You are only Rey there is! And I'm saving you right now!
