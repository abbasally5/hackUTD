It's time to face the day, time to make it snappy.
But you know first you gotta make it outta bed.
Hello Mr. Sunshine, today you're gonna be mine. 
Make him pinky swear there's only sunny skies ahead.
Take on the day with a one-two punch!

Mari:
And there it is! Deploy field!

Operator C:
Target inbound. Eva Unit-05 at risk of hostile engagement.

Mari:
Oh, yeah!

Mari:
God damn! Man, this thing is stiff!

Mari:
All right, gonna have to do this the hard way!

Operator F:
The upper outer wall has been compromised. The target is headed for the final seal.

Operator F:
The target has breached Limbo Area. Ascending into Acheron.

Commander-in-Chief:
What in the hell is Unit-05 doing?

Mari:
No. you don't! Get back here!

Mari:
Oh, shit! 
Yes, that would really hurt if it wasn't so much...fun!

Mari:
Time's almost up.
Mari:
Better make this snappy. The arm which properly syncs to this damn thing's starting to fall apart on me.

Mari:
Fine! Here, you want it that badly, I'll just give you the arm!

Mari:
That's enough! Just...fucking...die!

Pilot A:
Target obliterated. Unit-05 has been vaporized.

Pilot B:
The pilot appears to have ejected.

Kaji:
So, Unit-05's self-destruct program triggered without so much as a hitch. It's all going to plan.
Still, it's a shame we have to use these kids to do the grown-ups' dirty work.

Mari:
Ow, that hurt... Syncing with an Eva is even more brutal than they warned me.

Mari:
Well, I'm alive, so it's all good.
Still, I do feel kind of bad about using these adults to get what I want.

Mari:
Bon voyage, Eva Unit-05. You served us all well.
