Asuka:
Just turn back around.
Will you let me just lie here for a while?

Shinji:
Hey,um.., Asuka...

Asuka:
You know, you really should refer to me as Captain.
I guess you can call me Asuka though, but only if I could call you "stupid Shinji".

Shinji:
Well, Asuka, why do you pilot the Eva?

Asuka:
Stupid question. I clearly picked a right name for you.
I pilot the Eva because I want to. Why you do it?

Shinji:
I'm not really sure why.

Asuka:
Don't be an idiot.
You just don't want to admit to the reason to yourself.

Shinji:
I think I do it for my father's approval.
Today, he actually praised me. I always hated being praised, but I didn't today. And.., and I wonder if he's proud of me now. Maybe it's just like Misato was saying.

Asuka:
Stupid Shinji. You really ARE an idiot.
