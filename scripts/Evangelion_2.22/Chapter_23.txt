-- All our auxiliary systems, count down stand by.

Misato:
Vaporized? Eva Unit-04 and branch 2 were wiped off the map?

Aoba:
This is the analysis of ground zero at T-plus 10.

Misato:
It's terrible.

Hyuga:
Sattelite date feed verifies that AT filed collapsed. We are still not sure why.

Misato:
So Unit-04 was the center. And our Evas? Tell me their [statrepo].

Maya:
Well, Unit-04...

Ritsuko:
We can't talk about it. It was being used as the test subject for a new internal engine. But that's all we know. It's not much.

Maya:
North America has been pretty tight-lipped. They even wouldn't disclose their intel to to Dr. Akagi.

Misato:
Well then, who would know?

Fuyutsuki:
So Unit-04. It was an experimental unit meant to usher in the next generation of Evas. Anything could've gone wrong with it. Altough...

Kaji:
Was it really an accident?

Toji:
Hey! Excuse me. Give me three please.

Shinji:
What's with the generosity? It's not really like you.

Toji:
Oh, yeah? Maybe you just don't hang out with us enough to see my generous side.
Have you ever think of that?

Kensuke:
No, this is definitely your first .
Why don't you just tell him your sister is feeling better?

Toji:
Shuddup! No one is talking to you, moron!

Kensuke:
So, Shinji. I heard they're shipping Unit-03 to Japan.

Shinji:
They are? That's the first I heard of it.

Kensuke:
Well... These are just rumors. But I heard US insisted we take it. But I guess you pilots don't really need to know this stuff. Hey, who do you think its pilot is?

Shinji:
How do I know? They keep me in the dark.

Kensuke:
It mus be so cool to be a pilot. You think they would ever pick me?

Shinji:
Why you asking me?! Talk to Misato.

Kensuke:
Oh, I [xxx] just think of it.

Toji:
Tsk... Things that last.


Seele:
So two units have been lost in a matter of a month.

Seele:
Yes. First Unit-05. Now Unit-04.

Gendo:
In terms of progress, their loss is a hindrance to our plans but still...

Seele:
A setback, perhaps. But it does pose any real problem.

Seele:
The American government has insisted that you accept their offering of Unit-03. And your government has already agreed to take it.

Seele:
It's sate of the art and should supply as your primary unit.

Gendo:
The elimination of Angels requires a more reliable approach. An untested unit can't be trusted. But if would you simply approve the additional budget to repair Unit-00...

Seele:
Prototype’s function’s grown obsolete.

Seele:
You no longer need it.

Seele:
There are other matters that are far more deserving our concern.

Seele:
Our only desire is the true Evangelion. Its awakening will coincide with the resurrection of Lilith and usher in the time of the covenant. It's crucial that necessary rites be performed by then. For the sake of the Human Instrumentality project.

Gendo:
I'm aware of this. I assure you that all will go according to Seele's plan.

Gendo:
The true Evangelion. They see all of our current Evas including Unit-01 as simple place-holders to proceed to its completion.

Fuyutsuki:
So that's the purpose of Mark 06? They're taking one step further. They've decided to create a real God instead false ones.

Gendo:
Yes. We must hasten the awakening of Unit-01.


Asuka:
What the hell! You cannot put Unit-02 into containment!

Ritsuko:
You know the stipulation of the Vatican Treaty. With the arrival of Unit-03, we have no choice.

Asuka:
Then store Unit-00. It's not even functioning.

Maya:
We would if we could. But Euro still technically owns Unit-02. We have to keep our Evas operational.

Ristuko:
It's in a political gray area right now. Euro hasn't even said they want you to continue pilotting it.

Asuka:
It's mine. No one else can pilot it.

Ritsuko:
It's a combat weapon, Asuka. We have a backup plan for everything. And that includes the pilot.

Asuka:
This is wrong. The cockpit of the Eva is the only place I feel I belong.
