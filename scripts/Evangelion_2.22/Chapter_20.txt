Rei:
Commandar Ikari.

Gendo:
Yes, Rei.

Rei:
Do you find meals enjoyable?

Gendo:
Yes.

Rei:
And do you find pleasure in eating with others?

Gendo:
Yes.

Rei:
And the act of cooking,...that's enjoyable, isn't it?

Gendo:
Yes.

Rei:
Commander Ikari, would it be nice to sit down for a meal with your son and others sometime?

Gendo:
No, I don't have time.

Yui:
Gendo, take care of Shinji.

Gendo:
All right then, count me in.


– No sign of psychological contamination.
– LCL osmotic pressure clears mandate Categorization B.

Asuka:
This sucks! Talk about boring. I'd rather be fighting an Angel right now. I hate this checks.

Misato:
Well, this is a part of the job. And we wanna build a peaceful world without the threat of Angels' attacks, hoping for one is kinda productive. Yep-weee.

Ritsuko:
Endless tedium. Can you even begin to imagine that? Just one quiet boring day after another. I don't know. Sounds pretty nice to me.

Maya:
Chekcs complete. All signals are loud and clear.


Ritsuko:
Good work, you three. We've done now. All can come on out.

-- Commencing LCL purge in three minutes.


Hyuga:
I hope I'm not out of flying here. But repairing this damages could put operation to the standstill. Couldn't we just ignore the Vatican Treaty?

Misato:
(sigh) I wish we could. They didn't seem to take repairs into account when they prohibited each country from owning more than three Evas.

Maya:
As of right now, all of our repair work is focused on Unit-01. We are pretty much tapping out of spare parts surplus, so we don't even know when we'll be able to repair Unit-00.

Ritsuko:
The ego of every country is wrapped up in that treaty. Be impossible to get revised. And make matters worse for us, Russia and Euro are alleging that Asia has something to do with the loss of Unit-05. It gets ugly when politics are involved.

Maya:
We have to wade through a sea of red tape before we can protect the world.

Mari:
Move! Move! Get out of way, ya!
Damn it, where are my glasses?

Shinji:
Er..

Mari:
Oh, sorry about that. Are you okay?
Yeah, this is Mari. Yeah, the wind picked up and took me off target. It looks like I landed on a school of some sort. What? Well, you are the one who told me to enter Japan covertly. That's not my problem. That's for you and your Euro people to work out. Just make sure you're there for my extraction, okay? Thanks.

You smell good like LCL. One of my favorite smells in the world. You smell as I said I like it. But let's pretend I wasn't here. That's cool with you, Nervling?


Shinji:
What? That's weird.

Kaji:
Hey, lonely? [If I could] take you out on a date?

Shinji:
You realize I'm a guy?

Kaji:
Do I look like I care? Gender has got nothing to do with love.

Just [xxxx] up again. Thirsty?
