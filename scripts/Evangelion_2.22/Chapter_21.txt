Shinji:
This smells fresh... like life.

Kaji:
Don't tell me you are already worn out.
I paid for more labor than that.

Shinji:
You didn't pay me? You mean that can of coffee?
(Sigh) So that's what you were up to.
Somehow I didn't really expect you to be a devious type.

Kaji:
Why the heck not? You know any adults who aren't devious?

Shiji:
These plants here!? Are they water melons?

Kaji:
Yup. Cute, huh?
A kind of my hobby.
I love growing things.
That gives you a great perspective on the world,
gives you the chance to sort things out,
reminds you what it is to enjoy life.

Shinji:
So it helps you to forget the pain.

Kaji:
Aren't a big fan of the pain, huh?

Shinji:
Well, I don't like it.

Kanji:
Is there anything that you do like?

Hey, that's all right.
Listen! Way I see it is that people live through true pain and understand the value of kindness.
If anything, it makes them stronger.
But tell me this: Do you like Misato?

Shinji:
Do I like her?
Uh, well, I don't... not like her.

Kanji:
Do me a favor. Protect her.
She needs it and I can't do it.
You are the only one who can. Please.
