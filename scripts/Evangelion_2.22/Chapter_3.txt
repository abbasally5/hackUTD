 How long has it been since we last came here together? Three years?

Shinji:
Yeah. That last time for me was when I ran away.

Shinji:
 It's still doesn't seem real to me that mom is buried here. I can't picture her face anymore.

Gendo:
People let their memories fade in order to move on.
 Although, there are somethings we must never forget.
Your mother taught me how to be grateful for these memories.
 And I come here to remind myself how much they matter.

Shinji:
Do you have a picture of her?

Gendo:
They were all destroyed. Even this grave is empty. Nothing remains.

Shinji:
 So you've got rid of everything. My teacher said you would.

Gendo:
 Everything I need is in my heart and mind. That will have to do for now.


It's time. I'm needed elsewhere.

 Shinji:
 Dad, wait!


I...um..well, thank you for meeting me here.
 I'm glad we got to talk.

Gendo:
Are you?


You see, Shinji?
I know you awfully doubted about it, but it was a lot easier than you thought it'd be, right?

Misato:
And it was important that the two of you do this together.
I mean, it was a visit to your mom's grave.

Shinji:
I only went because you dragged me out here.

Misato:
I didn't force you. You know that deep down you wanted to come.
Be honest with yourself.

Shinji:
If I did that, I'd only end up more miserable.

Misato:
How can you still be so hard on yourself when you just saved humanity?
You've got to believe in yourself.

Misato:
I'm sure your dad does, especially after everything you've done.

 (Beep! Beep!)

 Misato: 
This is Katsuragi.
