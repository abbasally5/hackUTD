Rei:
Good Morning.

Shinji:
Ah, Rei? You're back.

Kensuke:
Good Morning?

Toji:
That's, er, not like her.

Shinji:
Rei, are you all right?

Rei:
Yes, I'm feeling fine.

Shinji:
What's wrong with your hand.

Rei:
Oh, this? Dr. Akagi put these on for me. 

Shinji:
Well, what happened?

Rei:
Nothing. It's a secret. But I'll tell you later.

---
Misato:
Rei seems different lately.

Ritsuko:
I've noticed. The idea of her doing something for someone else is a little startling.
I wonder what brought this on.

Misato:
Well, it could be love.

Rituko:
Rei in love? You joking, right?

---
Asuka:
No, hunch it like stupid Shinji is popping again this stew's spicy.


Misato:
Hey, I'm back.

Asuka:
Oh, Misato. You're home early?


Misato:
Yeah, but I'm goring straight back to work. I just dropped in to take a bath.
Wow! So, what's all this about? If I had to guess, I think you would be cooking for Shinji.

Asuka:
What? No, I'm not! It's just for, um, ... my friend Hikari.

Misato:
First Rei and now you, too? You both so romantic.

Asuka:
Excuse me? Don't lump me in with the wonder girl.

Rei:
You're right. After all, she's taking things to a whole different level.

Asuka:
What? How so?

Misato:
(sigh)Well, I get a feeling that she is trying to force a bond between Shinji and Commander Ikari.
Here.She's invented everyone to a dinner party. And she is going to serve a home-cooked meal.
It's a pretty direct plan of attack.
Bringing these two together is gonna be just about as easy as moving mountains.

Asuka:
Situation got all this but for stupid Shinji?

Misato:
It's supposed to be a surprise. So don't tell him anything, OK?

Asuka:
[All] like I even care enough! So stupid me.
