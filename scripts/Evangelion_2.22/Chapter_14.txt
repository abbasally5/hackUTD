Hyuga:
Target sighted by Mauna Kea observatory.
Stauts: Entering the Earth's orbit.

Aoba:
I've got a visual coming in from Surveillance Satellite 3.
Projecting on the main view screen.

Misato:
It has an AT field strong enough to bend light. That's unbelievable.
Well, what's the point of impact?
Let me guess, it's heading here.

Maya:
[The / Co-] Magi are calculating. Probability of a direct hit on Nerv is over 99%.

Misato:
Tsk!

Nerv officer:
The Aerial N2 bombs aren't having any effect.

Misato:
Then we can't adjust its trajectory. 

Maya:
It's focused its AT filed into a single concentrated point.
Once more, it's accumulating energy as it descends.

Misato:
So from the look of it, the Angel itself is acting as a bomb.

Maya:
If it scores a direct hit, the results would be catastrophic.
Based on our projections, the blast diameter is 420,000.

Hyuga:
Tokyo-3 will be vaporized, along with the Geofront.
Central Dogma will be completely exposed.

Misato:
Where is the Commander?

Aoba:
The Angel's field has disrupted all our COMSAT signals.
At present, we are unable to reach him.

Misato:
Which means we're just gonna have to make the call ourselves.

Misato:
Notify the government as well as all the ministries, 
Under Nerv's authority, we are issuing Special Declaration D-17.
Evacuate all residents within a 120km radius. 

Aoba:
That's easy enough. They are one step ahead of us.
The government officials are already running.

Announcement:
Evacuation of all civilians has been completed.
Evacuation of non-combatants and Class D Workers has been completed
in accordance with Directive C.

Maya:
Matsushiro base has agreed to back up the Magi.

Ritsuko:
So, what's the plan?

Aoba:
Aerial combat's out of the question since the Evas can't fly.

Staff officer A:
And there's too much spacial distortion to successfully attempt sniping.

Hyuga:
So, what other options do we even have against a monster like this?




Ritsuko:
You can't be serious. 

Misato:
Well, I am.

Ritsuko:
This is too desperate to even call a plan.
The Magi calculated a failure probability of 99%.
Even if it succeeds, we'll lose three Evas.
As head of the Technology Division, I find that unacceptable.

Misato:
A one percent chance is better than zero.

Ritsuko:
Be realistic here. It would take a miracle.
We should focus our efforts on protecting Lilith and Unit-01.

Misato:
I am being realistic. We're gonna create our own miracle.

Ritsuko:
Colonel Katsuragi!

Misato:
I am the ranking officer here. It's my decision.
More than that, It's my job to stop the Angels at all costs.

Ritsuko:
Your job? You mean your grudge. 
You're risking everything for your vendetta.


Asuka:
What?! You want us to catch it?
