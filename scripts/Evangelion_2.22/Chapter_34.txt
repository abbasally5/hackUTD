Mari::
Bear with it, Unit-02, you can do this! This isn't easy for me either.

Hyuga:
It's physically changing.

Maya:
The restrictors have been disengaged! The readings are off the chart. We can read the plug interior. Although...

Ritsuko:

Maya:
We can't let her. It's too dangerous!

Mari::
I don't get it. What good is it doing you to sit around feeling all twisted up and sorry for yourself?
