 Misato:
 A field trip? With Kaji?

Shinji:
Uh-huh. And he said I can bring anyone I want.

Misato:
 Gah! Of course he did! I'll sit this one out, thanks.

Asuka:
Cool, then I'll just hang out with you!

 Misato: 
No, ma'am. You're supposed to be harmonizing. So you're sticking with Shinji.

Asuka: 
Is that another order...?

Here we are. Not even a hundred feet over Tabgha Moonbase,
and yet they still won't allow us to land. Seele can be nasty when they want to.

Gendo:
They are clearly using a new method of construction for the Mark 06.
Just confirming that is enough.

Fuyutuki:
I didn't realize there were any more plans for construction after Unit-05.

Gendo:
For all we know, there could be further undisclosed Apocrypha.
Seele is intent to follow the scripture of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

Fuyutuki:
But Seele can't be oblivious to our plans.
They must be aware of Nerv's goal by now.

Gendo:
They most likely are. But we can't allow that to alter the course of our path.
Even if that ultimately means acting against the Word of God.


A person? Surely not...

Kaworu:
 Nice to meet you, Father.
