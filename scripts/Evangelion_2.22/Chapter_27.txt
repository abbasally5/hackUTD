Asuka:
I just suddenly felt like talking to you for some reason.

Misato:
Sure. And like I said I appreciate you doing this. Thanks again.

Asuka:
No need for thanks. It's the duty of the elite to protect the ignorant masses. I'm not really big on dinner parties anyway. And it's exhausting to act like you're having fun when you're not. Who wants to sit around watching everyone else have fun. The only thing I care about is being a pilot. And I actually like being alone. I don't really have much use for phony friends. I mean, no one's ever seen me for the real me. And my performance score is more important. I'd better submit my status at Nerv. I was kinda starting to think that I didn't mind being around other people so much. It's got be just so not me.

Misato:
I don't think that's true. You have a kind heart, Asuka.

Asuka:
I've never talked to anyone like this before. I actually feel better now. It feels kinda nice to talk to someone. I had no idea.

Misato:
Well, believe it or not, the world is full of all sorts of great things you don't know about yet. Try to enjoy it.

Asuka:
You're right. And I will. Thank you.
One last thing. It's cool that it's red now. But how about pervert designed suit? It's a bit revealing.
