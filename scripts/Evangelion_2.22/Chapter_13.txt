Have you ever asked Misato why she decided to join Nerv?
She doesn't really talk about him. But her father, he devoted his life to his research. 
And she spend a long time hating him for that.
She despised the very thought of him. 


Sounds like you and your dad don't get along. Guess we have that in common.


She's the same as me...


Although, in the end, her father saved her life.
Surviving something like that, you go through a lot. 
Accepting the loss of those who died, what they died for.
It's a heavy burden with the sole survivor.


Just know, we all have our pain.
