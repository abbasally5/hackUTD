Misato:
Ah, yeah! There's nothing better than an ice cold beer after a nice hot bath!

Asuka:
Eeeeek!
There's...something! A creature in there!

Shinji:
It's just a penguin. His name is Pen Pen...

Asuka:
Huh?

(Bonk!)

Asuka:
You degenerate pervert! How dare you spy on me!


Misato:
It certainly seems like they're starting to get more comfortable with each other.
Huh, Pen Pen?

Pen Pen:
Quack!

Asuka:
“You know we are better than they are!
They aren't special the way we are!
Nothing's changed. It's just like before.”

Asuka:
You're still better off on your own, Asuka.

Shinji:
So you're not gonna answer.
Aren't dad?
