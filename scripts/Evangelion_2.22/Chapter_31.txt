Maya:
My God. It's stronger than we expected.

-- Dummy system, functioning normally.
-- Control limiters being released.

Shinji:
What's going on, Dad? What's this? What are you doing?!
Damn it! Please stop, stop, stop, stop..... What's that sound? Stop it! [Stop iiiiiiiiit!]

Misato:
I'm alive.
Kaji?

Kaji:
You lucky. Darn lucky.

Misato:
Is Ritsuko?

Kaji:
Don't worry. She is just little bruised.

Misato:
Good. Asuka! What happened to her.

Kaji:
She... Unit-03 was destroyed... as an Angel.


Maya:
We cut Unit-01 synchronization circuits.

Fuyutsuki:
What about ejection signal?

Maya:
It's been overridden from within the plug.

Aoba:
He locked himself inside of it.

Hyuga:
Listen to reason, Shinji. Just stop it and think about what you're doing, please!

Shinji:
I know exactly what I'm doing. And you're only making me angrier. Unit-01 has 285 seconds left. That's enough time to destroy half of head quarters if
I want.

Aoba:
In his sate of mind, he might just do it.

Maya:
Shinji! Please! Just listen to us! Commander Ikari had to do it. You would have died if he didn't make that call!

Shinji:
That doesn't change anything.

Hyuga:
But it's still the truth, damn it!

Shinji:
I would rather die than be part of what you've done.
Dad tried... That bustard tried to kill Asuka. And used my hand to that.
Tell me why? Why?! Why did you do that!
You don't even understand that, do you, dad? I was so stupid to trust you. Maybe you should lose something you care about. Then, you'll understand!

Gendo:
Raise the LCL compression density to the limit.

Maya:
What?

Gendo:
We don't have time to deal with the child's tantrum.

Shinji:
I got the control of the circuit!

Damn you... Damn you... Damn you...


Rei:
I've noticed. You're always listing to that, aren't you?

Shinji:
Yeah. This used be my dad's old cassette player.

Shinji (child):
Just like his old glasses you got, Rei.

Shinji:
He didn't need it anymore. So he got rid of it.

Shinji (child):
Just like me.

Shinji:
I found it in my old teacher's place and took it. I close up my ears to close off my heart.
So I can drown out noise of this cruel world.

Rei:
This cruel world?

Shinji:
That's right. The world where the father I hate lives. The world of Angels and Evas.
Where I'm forced to do terrible things. For my father can replace me with the dummy and my friends get hurt.
I know that good things happen, too. But none of them ever seem to last. It all gets destroyed in the end.
It's a cruel world. And I'm turning my back on it.

I thought if I became a pilot, my dad would protect me from all this. I was stupid enough to believe that.

Rei:
Did you ever really try to understand your father?

Shinji:
Of course, I did.

Rei:
Are you sure about that?

Shinji:
Look! I tried, damn it! He is the one that's wrong. He's the one who abandoned me!

Shinji (child):
That's maybe true but you're just running away from things you don't like.

Shinji:
So what if I am. Why is that so wrong!? I don't want this thing.

This place again. I'm sick of this.

-- Verify all instructions on recovering fragments of Unit-03 with the Technology Division. I'm afraid anything about section nine is [xxxx] survive. Yes. Prioritize the internal organs.

Ritsuko:
Her cellular tissues are free of infection. There's still a chance of psychological contamination. We have no choice but to quarantine her.

Maya:
Do you think if they would go so far as to dispose of her?

Ritsuko:
She is a valuable specimen. They would never.


-- Pilot Shinji Ikari. Commander Ikari wants to see you.

Gendo:
Insubordination. Hijacking an Eva. Making treasonous threats. These are all serious offenses. Do you have anything to say for yourself?

Shinji:
Yes. I'll never wanna pilot an Eva again.

Gendo:
I see. Then you should leave.
Once again, you're running away. You have to sacrifice everything for your dreams. And that's something you have to do on your own. Nobody else is going to do it for you. It's time for you to grow up, Shinji.

Shinji:
You say that. But I don't even know what that's supposed to mean.

Gendo:
It's Ikari. Remove the Third Child from our records. Instate the Dummy System as the primary operator of Unit-01. There's no need for a backup.

Maya:
I guess Rei didn't try to stop Shinji from leaving after all.

Hyuga:
She opened up so much lately, I was hoping she would. Those kids are damn near indecipherable.

Aoba:
Yeah, now we are back down to one pilot.

Maya:
Back to square one. Again.


Misato:
I'm sure you already know this. But Nerv won't just forget about you. They're gonna keep you under surveillance. And your actions will be heavily restricted.

You forgot this. Kensuke and Toji have left you a lot of messages They're worried about you.

Shinji:
I really don't want it. I meant to leave it.

Misato:
You know you haven't even asked about Rei or Asuka. The truth is I don't think I really care too much about humanity or the world either.

I know that kind of strange given my current position. But I wound up here as a way to grow closer to my late father. That's why I joined Nerv. Just like you agreed to pilot the Eva because you wanted your father to need you. And because of that, I tried to live vicariously through you. And it was wrong of me to put that kind of burden on you.And I know how disillusioned you've become about piloting the Eva. But.. I wanted you to know... I...

That day, Rei had invited your father, she wanted to help two of you grow closer. She wanted you to laugh together.

Shinji:
I don't think that I'll ever laugh again.


--Next stop. Kamigora. Kamigora. Please exit to your left.
--Attention. The Japanese government has declared a state of emergency. In accordance with emergency regulations, this train will stop at the nearest
evacuation point. After disembarking, please proceed directly to the designated evacuation platform.

Shinji:
An Angel.

Mari:
Damn it. It's freaking cold!
Almost done.
Now that's a comfortable fit. It's about the time they got me measurement right.

Kaworu:
The time is at hand.
