Shinji:
Damn it! Wait!? The entry plug!? So she is still on board!

-- Armor corroding near cervical vertebrae!

Maya:
Surface layers contaminated. And it's spreading!

Fuyutsuki:
It's attacking invasively! This could be tricky.

-- Unit-01 AT field unstable.

Maya:
Life support malfunctioning. Pilot is in severe danger!

Fuyutsuki:
Darn! Minimize the neural connections to 28 percent!

Gendo:
Not yet.

Fuyutsuki:
We have to. Pilot will die at this rate.

Gendo:
Shinji, why arenâ€™t you fighting?

Shinji:
Because... Asuka still in there. Dad! I can't...

Gendo:
Listen. That is an Angel. And that's all that matters.

Shinji:
No, I can't do it! You can't make me murder Asuka!

Gendo:
Then you're going to die.

Shinji:
Fine! I'd rather die than kill her!

Gendo:
No matter. Sever the pilot's synchronization with Unit-01 now!

Fuyutsuki:
Commander!

Maya:
Cut it entirely?

Gendo:
Correct! Switch all control to the Dummy System.

Maya:
But sir. We would need Dr. Akagi's instructions,... and the system. It's not ready.

Gendo:
It will be of more use than the current pilot. Now do it!

Maya:
Yes, sir.

Shinji:
What is this? What's going on?
What the hell are you doing, Dad!?

Maya:
System switchover successfully completed.

-- AT field stable, recovered to Level B.
-- Connection central nerve converge. No abnormality detected.

Gendo:
Very good. Release the system. Commence attack.
