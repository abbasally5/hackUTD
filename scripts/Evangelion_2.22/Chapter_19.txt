School girl A:
Did you watch it?
School girl B:
I did it, I did it.

Toji:
Thank you god for inventing lunch!
It's the only good thing about schooldays.

Asuka:
What? Why didn't you make lunch for us?!

Shinji:
Because I didnâ€™t have time to. I was doing my homework all morning.

Asuka:
Well, that's just great! You've got your stupid homework done and I'll get starved for that!! Are you IDIOT?!

Shinji:
I already promised to make it tomorrow!

Toji:
Look at this. The newlyweds are fighting.


Shinji:
Shut up!

Asuka:
Shudda out!

Misato:
Aaaasukaaa, could I pleeease borrow your face wash?

Asuka:
Go buy your own, Misato! It's not that expensive!!

Misato:
You, cheapskate!

---
Toji:
Thank you God for inventing lunch. Wohoho, ahaha, time to dig in!

Asuka:
Hmmm, not bad, if it's [sort of] makeup for yesterday.

Hikari:
Hey, Asuka.
Could I maybe join you? You mind?

Asyka:
I guess, but I don't have enough to share.

Shinji:
Here, Rei. It's for you.
You never have lunch, so I thought...

Rei:
Um,... yes, thank you.

Hikari:
I'm so glad I worked up the nerve to talk to you.

Asuka:
Hikari, light, is that your name?
Well, you can eat the rest.

---
Misato:
Oh, man, I'm stuffed. Thank you for this meal.

Kaji:
Kind of late lunch, huh?

Misato:
Yah, I was busy.

Kaji:
So I heard you leave the cooking up to Shinji. That's good!
I'm glad you're not just eating instant ramen.

Misato:
Yeah, I guess.
Unlike you, some people actually have work to do, and don't have time to waste on cooking.

Kaji:
Serious as ever about your work.
That's great! I mean it's strength,.. most of the time, at least.

I heard about that little spat you had at Ritsu other day.
It wouldn't hurt if you try to relax a little.

Misato:
That'd be nice.
But I've got too much on my plate to relax.
Sad but true.

Kaji:
She's never gonna find a guy with that kind of attention in your life.

Misato:
Why the hell do you care?

---
Rei:

I thanked him. I expressed gratitude.
I've never done that before.
I've never thanked anyone. Not even him...

---
Hikari:
All rise! Bow! Be seated!

Old teacher:
[Looks] Miss Ayanami is absent again. Oh, well...

Shinji:
I wonder why? She seemed fine yesterday.


Rei:
They're like me that way.
--
Shinji:
They can only survive in there...

Gendo:
Rei, it's time for a meal.

Rei:
Yes.
