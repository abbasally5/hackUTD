Shinji:
What about my stuff? Wait, what in the heck are you even doing here? 

Asuka:
God, you're an idiot. 

Shinji:
Um...

Asuka:
It's rather obvious that you've been replaced. 
Yeah, I guess Misato wants a more skilled pilot as her roommate.

Shinji:
You're joking!

Asuka:
That's what I said when I saw how small these Japanese rooms are!
I mean, I couldn't even fit half of my stuff in here!

Asuka:
And is privacy like some completely foreign idea to the Japanese?
Seriously! How do you people live in rooms without locks when anyone can walk in on you!

Shinji and Asuka:
Argh!

Misato:
We don't see the need for them. We believe in consideration.

Shinji:
M, Misato!

Asuka:
God, you're irritating! Now get your junk out of here so I can unpack.

Misato:
No, no. No one's kicking Shinji out.

Asuka:
Errgh?!

Misato:
Look, if the two of you are going to work together, then you need to learn how to communicate.
You two are fellow pilots now. So, you're going to live here together.
And learn to act like it. 

Asuka:
Humph!

Misato:
That's an order, by the way.

Misato:
Okay, all together now! 

All:
Thank you for the meal!
