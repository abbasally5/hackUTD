Ritsuko:
Is it devouring the Eva!? Impossible!

Maya:
This is strange. The Angel's ID pattern is becoming identical to Unit-00.

Misato:
Then we are done for. The Central Dogma's self-destruct system, it won't trigger. That thing can walk up to Lilith.

Mari:
It's physically merging with Unit-00!? It absorbed the pilot and everything. You're gonna get killed if you stick around. You need to get out of here.

Aw, well. There he goes, I guess...

-- [Above ground HQ] facilities annihilated.

Hyuga:
It's breached the final layer of armor!

Misato:
No! Damn it! The main shaft is completely exposed!

Ritsuko:
Is Unit-01 functioning?

-- Unable to anchor plug in place.
-- Dummy system rejecting connection signal.

Gendo:
Keep trying. Reset and begin it again from 308. Why now? Why are you rejecting me now, Yui?

Shinji:
Let me pilot it! Please, please, you have to let me pilot Unit-01.

Gendo:
What are you doing here?

Shinji:
Father!

It's me! The pilot of Evangelion Unit-01, Shinji Ikari!
