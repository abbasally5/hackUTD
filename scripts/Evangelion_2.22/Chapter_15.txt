Misato:
Exactly! As the angel descends, you maxout your AT fields and catch it directly.
The target has scrambled its coordinate, so we can't accurately calculate its exact point of impact.
In order to narrow the field of possibility, all three Evas will be simultaneously deployed at different locations.

Asuka:
Listen! I can destroy this thing on my own!

Misato:
No way, it's impossible. The projected target area's too vast for one Eva to cover.

Rei:
How do you know where to place us?

Misato:
Woman's intuition.

Asuka:
Oh! That's reliable!

Shinji:
What's the chance of success?

Misato:
It's probably best if you don't know that.

Asuka:
Ha! And yet you insist I [deadly] need these deadweights, I'm proving that I can take that Angel on my own.

Misato:
The success of this mission is going to require more than your solo-combat skills.

Asuka:
So that's how little you think of me then?

Misato:
That's not it. I need all three of you to make this miracle happen. It's an only shot.
