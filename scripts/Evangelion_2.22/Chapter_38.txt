Maya:
Oh no! Physical restrictors are deteriorated.
I can't analyze it!

Ritsuko:
Eva has broken free of our confines. It's reclaiming its natural shape.
Casting aside humanity, transcending its physical form to become a divine being.
Weaving together the Heavens and Earth, becoming one with all of creation,
Expanding and transforming itself into pure energy.
All at the behest of a single human being, just to grant his desire.

Shinji:
I'm here, Rei!!

Rei, c'mon!

Take my hand! Reach out! Rei!!

Rei:
Huh?!

Kaji:
You forced Unit-01 to become a catalyst before they have their pieces in place. Well, Commander. Seele won't take this lying down.

Fuyutuski:
We were right! Their unity was enough to awaken Unit-01.

Gendo:
Indeed. It won't be long before our plan is complete. We almost finished.

Shinji:
Thank you, Rei... for trying to bring me and my dad together.

Rei:
I'm sorry I couldn't. I wanted you to be happy.

Shinji:
It doesn't matter. This is all I need.

Mari:
I get it now. Things just worked out for him, huh? I wonder if that's the reason he smells so good. (Ahchoo)


Ritsuko:
The naissance of subdivine life form, and the toll of its creation is the demise of all life that came before it.

Misato:
Wings... I've seen them before.

Ritsuko:
Yes, it's just like fifteen years ago. The Third Impact is beginning. This is the end of the world.
