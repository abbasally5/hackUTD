Misato:
There's no turning back now. All right, Evas. Get positioned.
We can't rely on the secondary data. So from here on, all actions will be left to your judgment. Everything we got is riding on the three of you.

Aoba:
Target approaching at 20,000 feet.

Misato:
All right. Release the locks.
Now go.

Aoba:
Target's AT field is morphing! It's changing course! Impact point adjusted by 205. Target's accelerating.

Asuka:
It's moving faster than they predicted. There's now way I'm gonna make it in time!

Shinji:
Look! Just leave it to me, Misato!

Misato:
Raise up the blast shields! 605 to 75!

Hyuga:
Right!

Misato:
Next! Steps 1075 to 1078! [Zero] time!

Aoba:
