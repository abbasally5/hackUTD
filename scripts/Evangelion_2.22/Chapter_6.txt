Asuka:
Unit-00 and Unit-01 are basically nothing but beta-testing prototypes.
They are antiquated machinery.

Asuka:
But Unit-02 is the final product. It's the world's very first true Evangelion. 
Perfect in every way.

Misato:
And there she is. The pride of the Euro Air Force, Captain Asuka Langley Shikinami.
She's the 2nd Child and the designated pilot of Unit-02.

Asuka:
It's been a while, Misato.

Asuka:
So that's the Unit-00 pilot, huh? The teacher's pet herself.
And... one of you must be the daddy's boy who lucked his way into the Unit-01 cockpit?

Shinji:
Uh, um...

Asuka:
What are you stupid?! Were you too busy to help me out? Not [that / like] I needed it!

(Bonk!)

Asuka:


Asuka:
Aren't you ashamed that nowhere to be found during the Angel attack?
Were you hiding behind your daddy?

Misato:
Hmm...

Toji:
Who the hell does that chick think she is?! Talk about bitchy!

Kensuke:
Yeah, But still, you've got to admit. It's pretty awesome that she is already a Captain at our age.
That's like a ten-year-old going to med school.

Kaji:
Excuse me.

Kaji:
You know, this is the right gate to get to the Geo-front's hub terminal?

Shinji:
Yeah, this is it. You've got [a/to] transfer at the fourth stop, though.

Kaji:
I've only been gone two years and I don't recognize a single thing.

Kaji:
Thanks for setting me straight, kid.

Kaji:
Say though, is Miss Coronal Katsuragi around here?

Shinji:
Huh?

Kaji:
I'm an old friend of hers.
I bet we could swap stories about her snore keeping us up at night... right, Shinji?

Kensuke:
He'd seen her sleep?

Toji:
Who the hell is that guy?

------ 

Kaji:
Man, was that job ever pain in the ass.
Regardless, both Eva Unit-05 and the 3rd Angel were disposed of as planned.
And the cause was officially labeled an accident.
The Marduk Plan at Bethany Base is all but suspended at this point.

Kaji:
Now then, as for my latest report on Seele...

Gendo:
We've already looked over it. The details on the construction of Mark 06 were rather helpful.

Kaji:
Glad to hear it.
Wanna look at the item you asked for? I'd imagine you must be pretty eager to see it. 

Kaji:
The metaphysical twining...between God and soul.

Gendo:
And it will open the door to Human Instrumentality.
The lost Key of Nebuchadnezzar.

Kaji:
Then if that's all, I've got some other things I need to attend to.

Fuyutuki:
Chief Inspection Officer, Ryoji Kaji. Are you certain that he can be trusted?

Kaji: 
You lost a little weight, hey, Ritsy?

Rituko:
Nice try. But I've gained more than I'd like to admit.

Kaji:
Maybe you're just wearing too many clothes.

Rituko:
I'd show you, but this room is being monitored.

Kaji:


Rituko:
Thoroughly prepared as always, huh?

Kaji:
Hey, when I play, I play to win.

Rituko:
But you've lost...
