-- Plug depth over 100. Contamination levels are in the red zone.

Misato:
What's happening?!

-- Pilot is descending below the safe depth!

Ritsuko:
Pull back! If this keep progressing, she'll no longer be a human!

Misato:
Abort the test! Shut it down!

Ritsuko:
An Angel?

Misato:
No!

Shinji:
What?
An explosion in Matsushiro!?

Fuyutsuki:
What's the damage?

Aoba:
Unit-03 holding cage appears to be the epicenter. Destruction of above ground facilities confirmed.

Fuyutsuki:
Immediately dispatch all rescue units. I want this resolved before the SSDS steps in.

Aoba:
Yes, sir.

Hyuga:
We've got a new alert, sir. An unidentified object sighted. The pattern is orange. We can't tell if it's an Angel.

Gendo:
Battle Stations, Condition One.

Fuyutsuki:
Sir?

Gendo:
Issue a base-wide Condition One alert. Place Unit-00 on standby. Ready Unit-01 as soon as it has been fitted with the dummy plug.

Shinji:
Um, are Asuka and Misato okay?

Hyuga:
We're making every effort we can to rescue them. Try not to worry.

Shinji:
But... Without Misato, or any backup then, there's just no way I can do this on my own.

Hyuga:
We're still fully-staffed down here. And Commander Ikari is directing this operation personally.

Shinji:
My dad is?

Aoba:
We have footage from outside Tomi. I'm patching it through now.

Fuyutsuki:
Just as we feared.

Gendo:
Transmit the shutdown signal and force eject the second child's entry plug.

Maya:
It's no good. It's rejecting the shutdown signal and the plug-ejection code.

Aoba:
We confirmed there is core-like substance around the entry plug.

Hyuga:
Pattern analysis complete. It's blue.

Gendo:
As of this moment, we're officially discarding Evangelion Unit-03. Target will now be identified as the 9th Angel.

-- Target approaching. Prepare to intercept ground-to-ground.
-- Blockade Units, open fire!
