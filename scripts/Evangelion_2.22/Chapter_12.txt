Asuka:
This is good! I'm surprised.

Kaji:


Kensuke:
It's kind of astounding that 90% artificial meat can taste this good when you grilled it, right?

Toji:
Yeah, Shinji, where've you hidden a talent you got there?

Shinji:
Well, you know. With the way Misato cooks, I had no choice but to learn.

Kaji:
But I'd tell you. Ladies love a man knows the way around kitchens.

Kensuke:
You hear that?

Toji:
Say what? You won't find me doing in. It's no job for a man.

Asuka:
More like a caveman, idiot.

Toji:
What'd you call me? There's nothing wrong with having principles.

Asuka:
Unless that's a stupid principle.

Toji:
What's problem?

Shinji:
Come on, guys. Just forget about it. Eat up.

Penpen:
Quack, quack, quack, quack.

Shinji:
I'm sorry, Rei. Did you not like the food?

Rei:
Well I..., I just don't eat meat.

Asuka:
Why does the Japanese always apologize when they've done nothing wrong? And drop the righteousness.
It's perfectly natural to eat other living things!
But it'll just be a waste of precious life if you don't eat that.
What? You wanna fight?

Toji:
Comin' through, pardon me. I will take care of this situation. 

Pen Pen:
Quaaaack!!

Toji:
Hey, back off! Greedy little bustard!
Forget it! I said no!

Asuka:
What a moron!

Toji:
Get away from me!

Shinji:
Well, so miso soup then? Here, try it.

Rei:
It's delicious.




Fuyutuki:
It's hard to accept that that's our mother Earth. It breaks my heart to even look at it.


It's even worse. Knowing there are other human beings who wanted this outcome.
To see the extinction of our own species in order to cleanse the Earth from the original sin.

Fuyutuki:
I prefer the living chaos of man instead of this barren wasteland of death.

Gendo:
Chaos is merely a human construct. The world only knows its own natural law of harmony and order.

Fuyutsuki:
So you are saying it's the human heart that throws the world into confusion.




Shinji:
It's kind of hard to wrap my mind around the fact that the ocean was blue before I was born.

Kaji:
I'm so amazed we were able to restore the environment enough for a kid like you to even be born.


I don't know about this breeze though.
(sniff)
Don't you think it smells a little too weird and fishy?

Kaji:
That's just a smell of putrefaction. It's evidence that there's life here, unlike the bloody emptiness out there.
This is what the ocean's supposed to smell like. This world is meant to be brimming with a vast and beautiful diversity of life. 
It once was. I want you guys to know that.

Shinji:
It really does make me happy. I just wished Misato would've come with us.

Kaji:
She could never come here.
Too many memories.

Shinji:
Memories of what?

Kaji:
Of living through the Second Impact.
