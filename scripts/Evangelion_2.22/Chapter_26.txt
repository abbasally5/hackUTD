Misato:
So this new dummy system they're instating. I don't trust that thing at all.

Kaji:
It's a top secret development from Golgotha base. It's a mystery to all of us.

Misato:
And we're gonna let it pilot our giant mechanized weapons for us? It's insane!

Kaji:
So you saying you're more comfortable with human pilot? Is that it? I know you trust Shinji you know all but. Is that the only reason you feel that way?

Misato:
Forget it! What about this organization called “Seele” or whatever? What you know about it?

Kaji:
I'd advice against sticking nose into that one.

Misato:
It's not an option. “Human Instrumentality” What is Nerv really up to behind the scenes.

Kaji:
Honestly..., I'd like to know that one myself.
This is the first meal we had in years, all we do is talk about work.

Misato:
Things changed since we were students. [xxx] we're aware of so much more, so many more of burdens.

Kaji:
I guess we don't the luxuries of just thinking of ourselves any more.

Misato:
Shinji and others. Now those kids have the greatest burdens on them all.

Kaji:
Yeah. I shouldn't have to deal with the [ship] we put them through. But we don't have any other choice.

Misato:
Yes. Yeah, right. I know. I'll have my decision for you by midnight.

Kaji:
Is that Ritsu?

Misato:
Yup. She's harassing me about Unit-03 test pilot.

Kaji:
It is your responsibility to choose.

Misato:
Yeah, I know it is. It's just that... Out of all days Unit-03 could arrive, they had picked the worst one possible.

Asuka:
So that's when they're running Unit-03 activation test. The same day as the suck-up's dinner party.

Ritsuko:
Really? You settled on Asuka. Right. I'm heading to Matsushiro on the last flight out. I'll leave the rest in your hands, Maya.

Maya:
Yes, ma'am! Have a good flight.

Rei:
Um, Dr. Akagi?

Ritsuko:
Huh?

Rei:
I have a message for the Second Child. Could I call her?

Cellphone's voice:
You have one unheard message. First unheard message.

Ritsuko:
Here you go. You can talk now.

Rei:
Thank you.

Asuka:
Huh! God! She is an idiot! I'm doing this to pilot the Eva, not for her.
If I decide that I like Unit-03, have them repaint it red, okay?

Female student:
Morning, Kensuke.

Kensuke:
Morning. Morning Shinji.

Shinji:
Oh hey. Where's Toji?

Kensuke:
Aw, he's at the hospital. From what I heard his sister's getting out today.

Shinji:
Oh, right. That's great.

Kensuke:
He told me to tell you this; Forget about the whole thing. And his sister says “Thanks” too. So no more guilt. You know, things are starting to look up.

Shinji:
Hm.

Kensuke:
So then, it's your big night. Your special evening with Rei, mm-hum-hum . You lucky bastard, you! I can't...

Misato:
Roger. Let's resume the countdown.

Misato:
It looks like we've got everything in order for Ritsuko.

A secure line... from Asuka?!
