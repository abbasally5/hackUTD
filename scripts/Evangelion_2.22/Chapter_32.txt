Fuyutsuki:
Target's status?

Aoba:
It's advancing towards the Geofront. It's just breached Odawara defense line.

Misato:
If I could feel the shockwave way down here, then we're in trouble.

-- Direct hit on District 4. Damages unknown.

Aoba:
Surface systems have been destroyed.

Hyuga:
That 24 layers of plate armor vaporized...

Fuyutsuki:
The 10th Angel's cutting the path of carnage to our very heart. It's more powerful than we could've imagined.

Misato:
Status Red! We need every weapon at our disposal firing at this target. Whatever it takes, hold it back! They're launching Unit-02?! Who's piloting it?!

Hyuga:
Unknown! Operation did not order its launch!

-- Target still active.

Aoba:
I don't care. Evacuate all residents!

Hyuga:
Authorizing third wave of the N2 missiles! You may launch when ready!

Misato:
We don't have time to send the Eva to the surface. Request approval from Euro. Deploy Unit-02 to the Geofront. How's Unit-00?

Maya:
Now repairing the left arm. It's just about ready.

Misato:
We need it backing up Unit-02 right away. One Eva is not enough.

Hyuga:
Roger.

Misato:
What about Unit-01?

Ritsuko:
We're activating the Dummy System right now.

Misato:
Well, it's taking too long.

-- Isn't that where city is?
-- We're gonna be okay. We're almost to the Geofront shelter. It's the safest place on the planet.

Aoba:
Surface breached! Target entering the Geofront! Quickly approaching Unit-02!

Misato:
Patch me through to Unit-02!

Maya:
Two-way comm-link has been cut off! We're not getting through!

Misato:
Is that so? They wanna do this alone man, huh?
