  Sakura:
Who...

Sakura:
...is calling out to me?

Sakura:
Oh, it's just the alarm.

Fujitaka:
Sakura, your breakfast is ready!

Sakura:
Okay!

Sakura:
I'm Sakura Kinomoto.

Sakura:
I'm a fourth grader at Tomoeda Elementary.

Sakura:
My favorite subjects are P.E. and music.

Sakura:
My least favorite subject is arithmetic.

Sakura:
You could say that cheerfulness is one good thing about me.

Sakura:
And my family...

Sakura:
Morning!

Toya:
Why were you thrashing about in your room?

Sakura:
I wasn't thrashing about!

Toya:
For that, you sure were making lots of noise.

Sakura:
I was just walking like I usually do!

Toya:
When you walk, it sounds like some huge monster is strolling about.

Sakura:
I'm not a monster!

Sakura:
This meanie is my big brother, Toya.

Sakura:
He's in the eleventh grade.

Sakura:
He goes to Seijou High School, right next to my elementary school.

Sakura:
He always makes fun of me!

Sakura:
Just because he's a little tall!

Sakura:
It's frustrating!

Sakura:
Someday I'm gonna become as huge as a telephone pole and...

Sakura:
I'm going to stomp on him!

Fujitaka:
You two get along so well this early in the morning.

Sakura:
This is my father, Fujitaka.

Sakura:
He's a college archaeology professor. He's kind, and he cooks and sews well.

Sakura:
I love him!

Fujitaka:
Here you go.

Sakura:
Wow, it looks delicious!

Sakura:
I'll have some now!

Sakura:
This is my family.

Sakura:
My mother?

Sakura:
My mother passed away when I was three years old.

Sakura:
But I'm not lonely.

Sakura:
I have my dad...

Sakura:
...and my brother, although he's mean.

Fujitaka:
Is it good?

Sakura:
Yeah!

Toya:
Thanks, that was good.

Sakura:
You're going already?

Toya:
Morning practice for the soccer team.

Fujitaka:
Have a nice day.

Toya:
See you later.

Sakura:
W-Wait a sec...

Sakura:
Thanks, that was good.

Fujitaka:
Did you really have enough?

Fujitaka:
Here's your lunch.

Sakura:
Where's Big Brother?

Fujitaka:
He went on ahead.

Fujitaka:
Do you have practice today?

Sakura:
Yeah! I'm going now!

Fujitaka:
See you later.

Sakura:
How far ahead is he?

Sakura:
There he is!

Sakura:
W-Wait a sec!

Toya:
You could've taken a little more time at home, right?

Sakura:
But...

Sakura:
But my big brother always goes to school with HIM!

Toya:
Yuki...

Yukito:
Morning!

Sakura:
Wow...!

Toya:
Yo!

Yukito:
Morning, Toya.

Yukito:
Good morning, Sakura. You got up early today.

Sakura:
Y-Yeah!

Toya:
Well, she DID eat breakfast in 5 minutes...

Yukito:
You're cheerful as always, Sakura.

Sakura:
This is Yukito Tsukishiro.

Sakura:
He's in eleventh grade, and in the same classes as my big brother.

Sakura:
He's such a kind, wonderful person, that I can't believe he's friends...

Sakura:
...with my brute brother!

Yukito:
Bye, Sakura.

Sakura:
I'm here already...

Yukito:
See you later.

Sakura:
Yukito...

Tomoyo:
Slick move.

Sakura:
Tomoyo!

Tomoyo:
That was a slick move of his...

Tomoyo:
...to hand you a gift just as he is leaving.

Sakura:
M-Morning, Tomoyo.

Tomoyo:
Good morning, Sakura.

Sakura:
This is Tomoyo Daidouji.

Sakura:
She's my best friend.

Sakura:
She's smart, pretty, and the daughter of the president of a big company.

Tomoyo:
You were so cute back there, Sakura.

Tomoyo:
How you held that candy with a dreamy look...

Sakura:
Um, Tomoyo...?

Tomoyo:
I wish I could have recorded that moment on videotape or in a photograph!

Sakura:
Are you listening?

Sakura:
Tomoyo has a hobby of taking photos and recording videos.

Sakura:
She takes a lot of shots of me, but...

Tomoyo:
Oh, yes. I bought a new camcorder.

Tomoyo:
Please let me film you again.

Sakura:
S-Sure, but wouldn't it be better to film something more interesting than me?

Tomoyo:
There isn't anything more interesting, or cuter, than you, Sakura!

Tomoyo:
I will start bringing the camcorder tomorrow, then.

Sakura:
I still think Tomoyo is a little strange...

Teacher:
And then, you will see a boy's face...

Teacher:
...with his mouth open in the shape of an O.

Teacher:
He must have been surprised.

Teacher:
Will he think it's a magical tangerine?

Sakura:
I wonder if that was me...

Tomoyo:
That is a cute picture. What is it?

Sakura:
Well, today...

Teacher:
Now, Miss Kinomoto.

Sakura:
Yes?

Teacher:
Can you read the next passage?

Sakura:
I'll tell you later.

Tomoyo:
Read from line 12.

Teacher:
Will he think it's a magical tangerine?

Teacher:
Of course, it was actually a butterfly in disguise...

Students::
Amazing!

Naoko:
You're amazing, Sakura!

Chiharu:
That's so cool!

Club Teacher:
Thank you, Miss Kinomoto.

Club Teacher:
Next, we will practice the toss.

Club Teacher:
Everyone, get your batons ready.

Students:
Okay!

Sakura:
I can't get that dream out of my head...

Sakura:
I'll talk about it with Tomoyo later.

Chiharu:
Sakura is very athletic, and she's great with the baton...

Naoko:
Yeah.

Chiharu:
...but she gets like THAT every so often.

Naoko:
Yeah.

Sakura:
I'm home.

Sakura:
"...I will be coming home at 9..."

Sakura:
Oh, Dad is going to be late...

Sakura:
Is someone there?

Sakura:
Why now?  N-Neither Big Brother nor Dad are around...!

Sakura:
It's from Dad's study!

Sakura:
What should I do if it's a burglar?

Sakura:
I'll just peek from the door.

Sakura:
If there's anyone there, I'll call the police!

Sakura:
Nobody is here?

Sakura:
It's that book...

Sakura:
A card?

Sakura:
Win...

Sakura:
...lesse...

Sakura:
Win...

Sakura:
WINDY?

Sakura:
What is this!?

Kero:
Hey-hey-hoo!

Kero:
Well, I'm surprised that you were able to wake me up!

Sakura:
An Osaka accent...?

Kero:
Well, this book was in Osaka for so long, I've caught the accent...

Sakura:
Where's the batteries? The switch?

Kero:
Hey, whatcha doin'?

Sakura:
Where is this voice coming from!

Kero:
I'm no toy!

Kero:
I'm Kerberos, the Beast of the Seal who guards this book!

Sakura:
Seal...? Kerberos...?

Kero:
Yeah.

Kero:
Looking out for the cards in this book so they don't do anything bad is my...

Kero:
The cards are gone!

Kero:
Why, why!?

Kero:
Where did they go!?

Sakura:
This?

Kero:
This! This! Yeah, this!

Kero:
And, the other cards?

Sakura:
I read, WINDY...

Kero:
Yeah?

Sakura:
And there was a sudden gust of wind...

Kero:
Yeah, yeah?

Sakura:
...and they all flew away.

Kero:
I see...

Kero:
WHAT!?

Sakura:
Thanks, that was good.

Toya:
Where are you taking that?

Sakura:
I'm gonna eat it in my room as I study.

Sakura:
Any luck?

Kero:
No good.

Kero:
I can't tell where the cards are at all.

Sakura:
Here.

Kero:
This looks delicious!

Kero:
There were Clow Cards in this book.

Sakura:
Clow Cards?

Kero:
Clow Cards...

Kero:
When the Seal on them is broken, a catastrophe will befall this world...

Kero:
Those cards were special cards made by an amazing sorcerer named Clow Reed.

Kero:
Each card is alive, and possesses incredible powers...

Kero:
But they all like acting on their own, and normal forces are no match for them.

Kero:
So, Clow himself created this book, and placed me...

Kero:
...the Beast of the Seal, on the book's front cover.

Kero:
In any case, we have to get the cards back...

Kero:
So you're coming with me.

Sakura:
Why me?

Kero:
You're the one that scattered the cards with the WINDY spell.

Sakura:
B-But wasn't it your job to keep those cards properly sealed away?

Kero:
Well, I accidentally fell asleep...

Sakura:
For how long?

Kero:
About 30 years.

Sakura:
And you call yourself the Beast of the Seal?

Kero:
Stuff happens! All right!

Sakura:
So those noises were just snores...

Kero:
In any case, the fact that you could open this book...

Kero:
...means that you at least have some magical powers.

Kero:
What's your name?

Sakura:
Sakura.

Kero:
All right, Sakura. Stand right over there.

Kero:
Key of the Seal.

Kero:
There is someone wishing for a contract with you.

Kero:
A girl. Her name is Sakura.

Kero:
Oh Key, grant her the power!

Kero:
RELEASE!

Kero:
Sakura, grab the staff!

Kero:
All right! It's the birth of a Cardcaptor!

Sakura:
I'm absolutely, positively sure that I can't do it!

Kero:
Wow, this is so fluffy.

Sakura:
I know I can't become a Cardcaptor.

Kero:
Cardcaptor. The one who captures Clow Cards.

Kero:
Doesn't that sound cool?

Sakura:
I'm just a normal grade-school girl!

Sakura:
Even though you said something about a catastrophe on this world--

Kero:
Who was it that scattered the cards using this?

Sakura:
And who was it that was sleeping instead of guarding the cards?

Sakura:
That's a strong wind...

Kero:
Sakura!

Sakura:
What's that?

Kero:
A Clow Card!

Kero:
That's probably the FLY card.

Kero:
This is no time to be impressed! Hurry up!

Sakura:
For what?

Kero:
The first job for Cardcaptor Sakura!

Sakura:
Why in my pajamas?

Kero:
What's the world's only Cardcaptor saying?

Sakura:
I can't catch something that huge!

Kero:
Why are you acting so wimpy?

Kero:
Sakura! Your magic!

Kero:
The key! Do just as I told you earlier!

Sakura:
The Key which hides powers of the Dark!

Sakura:
Show your true powers before me!

Sakura:
I, Sakura, command you under our contract!

Sakura:
RELEASE!

Kero:
All right, Sakura.

Kero:
The FLY card is attributed to wind.

Kero:
You should be able to capture it with the WINDY card you have now.

Sakura:
Are you sure?

Kero:
In any case, we have to get closer.

Sakura:
What should I do? It's flying straight at me!

Kero:
Sakura, the WINDY card!

Sakura:
Y-Yeah.

Kero:
Drats, it's coming again!

Kero:
Use the WINDY card! Hurry!

Sakura:
But how I am now...

Sakura:
I can't!

Kero:
The point of being the Cardcaptor is to figure out stuff like this!

Sakura:
Something...

Sakura:
I might be able to do something!

Kero:
Whatcha gonna do!?

Kero:
Sakura!

Kero:
Sakura!!

Sakura:
Wind, become a binding chain...

Sakura:
WINDY!

Sakura:
Return to the guise that you were meant to be in!

Sakura:
CLOW CARD!

Kero:
Nice going, Sakura!

Sakura:
I thought I was gonna die!

Kero:
Nothing less from the Cardcaptor that I scouted!

Sakura:
As I've been saying, I never said I would!

Kero:
You'll be a better adult if you have all sorts of experiences in your life!

Kero:
Well, you did capture this card.

Kero:
Why don't you try it out now?

Sakura:
What can this do?

Kero:
Well, try it.

Sakura:
FLY!

Kero:
How is it? Doesn't it feel good?

Sakura:
Yeah!

Kero:
I'll enjoy working with you, Cardcaptor Sakura!

Sakura:
Yeah...

Sakura:
I've been saying, I didn't say I'll do it!

Leave it to Kero!

Kero:
Hey-hey-hoo!

Kero:
This is "Leave it to Kero," and I'm your host, Kerberos.

Kero:
This segment is to explain the various things...

Kero:
...that appear in Cardcaptor Sakura, for all the Sakura fans.

Kero:
So... Today, we have the uniform for Tomoeda Elementary School.

Kero:
There are two types of this uniform: short-sleeved and long-sleeved.

Kero:
This time, I'll introduce the long-sleeved version.

Kero:
A chic design based on dark blue, giving out an elegant feeling.

Kero:
And the school emblem on the left arm is a key point.

Kero:
Add the cute hat, and the good gets better.

Kero:
Now, KERO'S CHECK!

Kero:
Today's check point is the skirt.

Kero:
The white pleated skirt suits Sakura well, doesn't it?

Kero:
Oh yeah, and this is the boys, uniform.

Kero:
Anyway, that's it for this time, but don't you understand it well now?

Kero:
I'll continue to aggressively check the details. Y'all should look forward to it.

Kero:
See ya!


 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:2:&lt;h2&gt; 

Sakura:
I somehow was able to seal away the FLY card...

Sakura:
...but I just can't do the job as a Cardcaptor!

Sakura:
If my friends find out, it will be a big mess!

Sakura:
And what is the video that Tomoyo wants to show me?

Sakura:
Cardcaptor Sakura: "Sakura's Wonderful Friend"

Sakura:
Join me next episode -- RELEASE!
