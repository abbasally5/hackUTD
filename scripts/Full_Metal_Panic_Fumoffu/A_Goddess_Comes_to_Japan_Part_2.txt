Soldier:
Hey, get up!

Sousuke:
We're under fire! We need backup! Radio!
Radio!

Testarossa:
I'm looking forward to our time together.

Kyoko:
Such boldness!

Kaname:
Make out to your heart's desire.

Madukas:
Now, Sergeant Sagara, if you should happen to commit some sort of shameless act against the Captain, I will tear you limb from limb!

Sousuke:
Just a dream.

Testarossa:
No, Mr. Sagara, we shouldn't. Please.

Kaname:
Okay, what's all the racket in here?

Sousuke:
Kaname!

Kaname:
When... When the heck did she...?

Sousuke:
I-It's not what it looks like! I didn't do any...

Kaname:
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
Hey, Tessa! I thought you promised that you'd stay out of this room.
You broke the rules we agreed on!

Testarossa:
No, thanks. I couldn't eat another bite!

Kaname:
Look, I'm not falling for it! Now, wake up, will ya!?

Sousuke:
Kaname, don't be so rough with...

Kaname:
Shut up! It's your fault too! You left yourself open!

Testarossa:
Now I don't mind. Just go ahead and fire.

Sousuke:
Fire what?



Mao:
It's your last weekend here.
Let's see, what should we do.

Testarossa:
Oh, I've already made plans!
I'm spending two days and one night at a hotspring in Okutama.
Miss Kaname and her friends are invited too.

Sousuke and Mao:
A hot spring?

Testarossa:
Yes! No trip to Japan is complete without a hot spring visit.
He strongly recommended it.

Mao:
"He recommended it"? You don't mean...

Kurz:
Hi! Good morning to everybody!

Everyone:
Good morning to you too.

Kurz:
I'm Kurz Weber and I'm gonna be your coordinator.
I'm a student of Tessa's dad [at the] college.
Let's be good friends, just call me Kurz-baby.

Kazama:
Excuse me, Kurz-baby?

Kurz:
I didn't say that boys could ca...

Mao:
[***] sorry about that!
Let me introduce myself. I'm Melissa Mao, a research student at the college.
It looks like I've already met some of you.
If you have any problems, just ask me, okay?

Kurz:
This is one heck of a party.

Ono-D:
Three whole hours cramped in a car with three other guys.
It's torture, I tell you!

Kurz:
Oh, you don't have to tell me. I know all too well.
Who asked Mao to take charge, anyway?
Hey, Sousuke! You look awfully relaxed back there.

Sousuke:
Mno frovlem. I feew reraxk...

Kurz:
Okay, all I hear is a mouthful of jerky.

Sousuke:
Not a problem.
I appreciate the lack of female disruption.

Kurz:
Yeah, in any case, as you know, gentlemen, we'll be staying at the hot spring's lodge tonight.

Kazama and Ono-D:
Yeah.

Kurz:
A bunch of young guys and girls on a trip to the hot spring.
You know what that means?

Ono-D:
You don't... You don't mean that?

Kurz:
That's right. I mean that.
A trip to a hot spring isn't complete without that!

Ono-D:
Oh, I get it!
So not doing that would be rude to the girls!

Kurz:
Exactly, Ono-D!
I think we'll get along just fine.

Ono-D:
Yes, I think we will.

Sousuke:
What peafeful feenery.

Kurz:
Ah, again with the jerky!

Kyoko:
Wow, it's gorgeous, huh?

Mizuki:
Yeah, it's a fantastic view.

Mao:
Well, it looks like we have a fair amount of time before dinner.
Hey, Kaname, you feel up to going to the open-air bath?

Kaname:
Umm, I guess so, but...

Mao:
Are you worried about something?

Kaname:
Well, Kurz is here and all, so I was wondering if they might be plotting something sketchy.

Mao:
Oh, you don't need to worry about that!

Testarossa:
It'll be okay. Even Mr. Weber wouldn't be that lewd.

Kurz:
Actually, I would be that lewd, Miss Tessa.
Our prey is on the move. Heading for the open air bath.

Ono-D:
All right, we should get moving too.

Kazama:
Um, Kurz, are you sure about all this?

Kurz:
Don't worry. Let's get going, okay?

Sousuke:
Kurz.
Going to the bath?

Kurz:
Oh, you wanna in?
Then get ready for a little taste of heaven!

Sousuke:
That's not what I meant.
Enjoy your bath like normal. Nice and normal.

Kurz:
Hey, what does that mean?

Ono-D:
Kurz, let's go!

Kurz:
I'm coming.

Sousuke:
What peaceful scenery.

Kaname:
Wow! What a pretty view out here!

Kyoko:
You see? Didn't I tell you, Kaname?

Kaname:
Hey, look over there! A river!

Kyoko:
Oh wow!

Mizuki:
Better not lean over too much or you're gonna fall.

Kaname:
We're fine!

Mikihara:
This certainly is rather nice hot spring and the water temperature is perfect too.

Mao:
I can just relax here in the open air. Here's to sweet freedom.
By the way, do you know what benefits this spring is supposed to have?

Mikihara:
I think it helps headaches and stiff shoulders.

Mao:
Hun? Nothing for pretty skin?

Mizuki:
But you shouldn't have to worry about that. You have pretty skin already.

Mao:
Really? But my skin gets some rough treatment in my line of work.
Oh, that's right! Hey, Tessa! Stop being so shy and get out here, will you?

Testarossa:
I am sorry.
I guess the thought of stepping out into the open air bath just makes me a little nervous.
You're sure it's all right?

Mao:
Look! Don't worry. It's fine! Come over here and I'll wash your back for you.

Testarossa:
Oh, thank you.
OW! OW ow ow...

Mao:
You really are one hard-core klutz, aren't you?

Kaname:
Tessa, you all right over there?

Testarossa:
Yes. But my butt hurts a little bit, though.

Mao:
Where? Let me see.

Testarossa:
Oh! Melissa! Stop!
Please don't stare at me like that!

Mao:
It looks like it just scraped a bit.
But you have really nice skin.

Testarossa:
That's off limits!

Mao:
Oh, come on, let me see there too.

Testarossa:
There too?

Mao:
What if I do this? Does it hurt?

Testarossa:
No, that's fine.

Ono-D:
Kazama!
Hey, come on, man! Snap out of it!

Kazama:
Oh, man. She's the best ever.

Ono-D:
What are you blabbering?
Hey, Kurz, Kazama collapsed over here!

Kurz:
That proves he's nothing but a kid.
We're just getting started here!

Ono-D:
Uh, your nose...
Yeah, anyway, what now?
We can't see over unless we get on each other's shoulders.

Kurz:
That's where these come in!

Kazama:
An electric drill and a fiber-optic scope? Oh, I see.

Ono-D:
You carry around the same kinda stuff as Sousuke.

Kurz:
Don't worry. Well, here we go.

Kyoko:
Hey, Mao, Tessa says you know a bunch of foreign languages.
How did you learn those?

Mao:
Men.
M-E-N.

Kyoko:
Men?

Mao:
Well, the secret to improving is to learn while you're in bed.

Kyoko:
No way!

Ono-D:
Isn't it done yet?

Kurz:
Wait a sec. Something's not right.
There's a metal plate behind the wall!

Ono-D:
What?

Kazama:
Maybe to keep guys from peeking?

Kurz:
This metal... It's what the military uses for armor.
Fine. If that's how it is...

Ono-D:
Can you reach yet?

Kurz:
Almost.

Ono-D:
How about now?

Kurz:
Almost...

Ono-D:
I don't like having that on the back of my head!

Kurz:
Almost there.

Girls:
Huh?

Kurz:
Okay, why is there a security gun?
What kind of inn is this?

Ono-D:
What's he talking about?

Kazama:
I guess it must be the latest security system or something.

Kurz:
What if I try to go around this side?
Damn, there's no opening!



Kyoko and Mao:
Wow!

Mao:
This is like a feast!

Kyoko:
Yeah! You're right!

Mizuki:
It was worth coming all this way and the bath was so relaxing.

Mikihara:
Yes, it was nice.

Mizuki:
Wanna go back in later?

Kyoko:
Oh, I'll go too!

Mizuki:
Sounds like a plan. I agree.

Kazama:
Looks like we still have a chance.

Kurz:
We do. But normal methods won't break through that security system.

Ono-D:
So, we'll have to come up with a good plan.

Kurz:
I agree, rookie.
But first, let's eat while we can.

Kurz:
We'll have to attack from a distance.
We can get them with night-vision scopes from the summit facing the inn.
The best observation points are here and here.

Ono-D:
How about here? It's faster going in a straight line, right?

Kurz:
No good. That's in the west, and the topography makes it sunny there, so the vegetation will be thick.
There's no way we'll be able to capture our target.

Ono-D:
Oh, I see. You're pretty smart, you know that?

Kurz:
I'm a sniper! Knowing how to read a map is a specialty for me.

Kazama:
A sniper?!

Kurz:
All right, prepare to move out!

Sousuke:
Kurz.
Going to the bath again?

Kurz:
That's right. Something wrong with that?

Sousuke:
There's nothing wrong. It's just that...

Kurz:
It's just what?

Sousuke:
Enjoy your bath like normal.
Nice and normal.

Ono-D:
Kurz, let's go!

Kurz:
I'm coming.

Testarossa:
Umm. This one!

Mao:
Oh, yeah!

Testarossa:
The Joker again?

Kaname:
I guess he must really like you.

Testarossa:
Funny. I think the Joker fits you better!

Kaname:
What did you say?

Mao:
Hey, now...

Kyoko:
Hey, don't you think Ono-D and the guys were acting kind of down earlier?

Mizuki:
Oh, you were thinking that too?

Kyoko:
I wonder why?

Mizuki:
I don't know.
Let's go, Ren.

Mikihara:
Be right there.

Kyoko:
Shinji didn't look too good.

Mizuki:
Think he got the chills?

Ono-D:
You have the chills?

Kurz:
Be careful what you step.

Kazama:
Hey, Kurz, at least let me use a flashlight, come on!

Kurz:
Not a chance. We'll be spotted by the enemy.

Ono-D:
But we gotta hurry. They'll be out of the bath by the time we get there.

Kurz:
Ono-D, Kazama, it's a trap!
What's wrong, Kazama?

Kazama:
I think I stepped on a land mine!

Kurz:
You think what?!

Ono-D:
Land mine?! You mean that kind of land mine?
Wait a second! What the hell kind of inn is booby-trapped with land mines?!
No way! This has Sousuke written all over it!

Kurz:
Yeah. That bastard. Did he come here yesterday?
He must have won over the inn-keeper and then set his traps.
And Mao...

Kazama:
Pl-Please help me!

Kurz:
Don't worry! We won't abandon you!
There it is.
All right, Kazama. Shift your weight slowly now.
Got it? Very slowly.
Just a little more.

Girls:
Huh?

Sousuke:
What fools they are.

Kazama:
That's it! I can't take it any more!
Even with infinite lives, I couldn't!

Ono-D:
Yeah, that's right. I mean, why are we still alive, anyway?

Kurz:
Kazama.
I won't force you to do anything.
But are you sure you wanna run away now?
See, even I'm afraid of dying and sometimes I wanna run away.
But I believe there are some things in this world that you just can't give up, even if you have to risk your life.
Something that makes you feel, "As long as I can get through this, I can live my whole life with pride."
Having something you can get that passionate about is important, don't you think?
That's why I'm not going to give up.
That's why I'm going to fight.

Kazama:
My hero...

Kurz:
It's not like me to say stuff like that.
But, well anyway, I'm going to go on alone.
Maybe you two [shouldn't].
Wait, you mean, you guys...
Time is running out. This is our last chance.
I'm only going to tell you this once. So listen good.
There's only one way to attack the situation.
We have to climb this slope and get our eyes on the target directly.

Kazama:
But they have that security system.

Ono-D:
Yeah!

Kurz:
Right.
That's why you two are going to climb the slope first as decoys.

Ono-D:
Hey, no fair!

Kurz:
There's nothing to worry about.
There's about a two-second delay between the time those guns identify their target and the time they fire.
And in those two seconds, I'll find where they are, and finish them off with this!

Kazama:
A VSS Vintorez!
But something like that is almost impossible!

Kurz:
I can do it. Trust me.

Kurz:
Now!
Where are you? Come on out!
Gotcha!
Don't stop! Keep going!
Crap!
Damn, another land mine?
Kazama, get down! Now!
Hey, are you all right, Ono-D?
Son of a...!

Kazama:
Kurz!
Kurz, are you all right?

Kurz:
I messed up.

Kazama:
Come on, you can't wimp out now! Your butt just got burned, that's all!

Kurz:
It's all right. I know the limits of my body better than you can imagine, so...

Kazama:
Kurz?!

Kurz:
What are you hanging around here for?
Hurry or you'll miss the target!

Kazama:
But.... but...

Kurz:
Go, Kazama! Don't let our deaths be for nothing!
If you don't move it, I'll lose any respect I have for you! Now go!
Go and burn the image of those girls into your mind!
Pass it on to the next generation!
Tell them the tale of the victory we earned here!
Go on! Go! Don't just stand there! Run! Now!
What are you doing? Hurry! And you call yourself a man? Kazama!
Yes. That's it. Now run, Kazama. Go run up that slope...

Kazama:
I can see it! I can see it!
Kurz, I can see the enemy!
I got it! The target! It's right in front of me!

Sousuke:
The men's and women's baths switch places at 10:00.

Kagurazaka:
It seems like only yesterday that Miss Testarossa came here as an exchange student.
But it's time for her to go now.
Well, I know it was only for a short time, but did you have fun while you were here?

Testarossa:
Yes.

Kyoko:
Um, excuse me.
All of us have prepared something for you today.

Kagurazaka:
What is it, Kyoko?

Kyoko:
This is for you!
Best of luck back home too!

Testarossa:
Thank so much. I'll do my best. Really, thank you.
Everybody, I'll never forget this!
Thank you, everyone. I really, really mean it.

Testarossa:
Good work. I'll be taking command now.

Madukas:
Aye aye, Captain!
The captain will now resume command!

Testarossa:
Start the engine.

Madukas:
Start the engine!

Sailor:
Starting engine!
Run a performance check on all links.

Madukas:
Captain.

Testarossa:
What is it?

Sailor:
This is Damage Control. Preset the JDA.

Madukas:
How was your R&R?

Testarossa:
It was nice. Very nice.

Sailor:
Airlock check complete.

Testarossa:
I will endeavor to do everything I can to protect them, no matter what.

Sailor:
Commencing final check.
A Group: Check.

Madukas:
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

Sailor:
B Group: Check.
C Group: Check.
Awaiting XO approval.

Madukas:
All checks complete, ma'am.

Testarossa:
Very well. Ahead at one-third top speed!

Madukas:
Aye, ma'am. All ahead at one-third top speed!

Sailor:
Ahead at one-third speed!

Testarossa:
I will protect them, no matter what.

Sousuke:
And that's everything.

Kaname:
Well, she's gone, huh?

Sousuke:
Yeah.

Kaname:
You feel relaxed?

Sousuke:
I guess so.

Kaname:
But, you're actually gonna miss her a little, aren't you?

Sousuke:
No, not really.

Kaname:
Me too.
I think I'm gonna miss her a little bit too.


（次回予告）

Kaname:
Duty and humanity. A world of manly chivalry.

Kurz:
Hey, missy, you better watch your tongue.

Kaname:
Patience, patience and more patience!

Kurz:
What!? Give up without a struggle!

Kaname:
A light snow that soaks the heart!

Kurz:
You gonna let me handle this or what?

Kaname:
Shut up!

Sousuke:
Next Time, "A Fancy Without Honor or Humanity."
We dedicate this story to the late director Kinji Fukasaku.

Kaname:
Stop it! I don't think he'd appreciate that!
