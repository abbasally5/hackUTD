(起立！礼！)
Teacher:
In other words, in recent years the division of groups in the *genre, the *headhunting of their affiliated athletes, and the limitless rise and fall of minor groups in fact *epitomize this country's society.
During the Shouwa Era, it was two large groups *monopolized the trade and the business world.
However, as this system *crumbled, an era of *liberalized deregulation was initiated.
On the plus side, this brought about the birth and development of many new styles and ideas.
On the minus side, however, it produced a *proliferation of groups based on *simplistic ideas and a decline of business morals.
Does anyone...have questions...?
If no one has any, then that is all.

Chidori:
Rise!
 Bow!

(コッペパンを要求する！)
Chidori:
 Here I come!
 Damn it!
 Ha?!
 I'm in a pinch!
 I won't give in!
 Almost there!
 Ma'am!
 Give me a croquette sandwich and a custard pastry!

Ma'am:
Yes, that's two hundred ninety yen.

Kyoko:
You're so quick, Kaname.

Chidori:
 Well, I'm not getting stuck with leftover plain rolls.
 Hey, Sousuke!
 Are you here to get bread too?

Sousuke:
I'm completely out of jerky and vegetables.
Though... gazing from that crowd.

Chidori:
What do you mean?
It's not like you to give up.
But if you don't move, they're all gonna sell out!

Sousuke:
Well, that's no good.

Chidori:
And order in a loud commanding voice.
Put some spirit into it!

Sousuke:
Understood.
Spirit.

I demand a plain roll!

Chidori:
Why plain?!

Sousuke:
So, please cooperate and bring out the plain rolls.
Or else I'll shoot.

*[語　　句]

(これは深刻な食糧問題だ。)
Mikihara:
They say they're gonna need two weeks.

Chidori:
Two whole weeks...
Are you sure?

Mikihara:
They say their injuries are not very serious, but...

Hayashimizu:
But the bakers that sustained these injuries intend to postpone their on-site sales in the meantime.
Most likely as means of indirect protest.
We have a serious food crisis on our hands.
The one hundred twenty students who depend on baked goods sold on-site will starve.
The results are all too clear.
Riots and pillaging, moral decay.
Order within the school will surely plummet.
Therefore, after a consultation with the principal, it was decided that the student council will procure food and sell it for now.
So, we must appoint a manager to oversee this project.

*[語　　句]

(激昂の体育教師小暮)
Kogure:
 Principal! I can't accept this! No way!
 I don't call this idea of leaving everything up to the students respecting their autonomy!
 It's nothing more than unchecked anarchy!
Principal:
 And what would be the harm in it, Mr. Kogure?
 All the students are doing is selling lunches.
Kogure:
 Do I have to remind you that the students are the ones who caused this mess!
 Yet, despite this, you're intend on letting them, the instigators, sell food and drinks?!
Principal:
 It's merely like an extension of the school festival.
 So it's nothing to get all pain out of shape over now, is it?
Kogure:
 But...!
Kaname:
 Oh man, why do WE have to do this?
Sousuke:
 It's simple. Because in light of the circumstances behind this incident, it is undeniably our duty.
Kaname:
 I guess that's tru...
 Wait a sec! This is all your fault, Sousuke!
Kogure:
 Grrr... What a waste! Huh?
Kaname:
 Ugh!
Kogure:
 Well, well, if it isn't Sagara. You're looking quite well today.
 You don't look anything at all like someone who's just sent somebody to the hospital.
Sousuke:
 I'm flattered to hear that, sir.
Kogure:
 Well, don't be! Ok, listen up, Sagara!
 I can't stand letting blooding-noodle students like you and Hayashimizu have their own way!
 I can't go against the Principal, but mark my words. I'll put my own special brain to pressure on you and your little cohort, you got that?!
Sousuke:
 Roger, understood.
Kogure:
 Grrr... Oh, a wise guy, eh? Well, just you wait!
Sousuke:
 Yes sir! I'll be waiting, sir!
Kaname:
 I wonder if he hasn't been getting enough vitamins or something? Though he is the health teacher.
Sousuke:
 Uh-uh. What you witnessed was simply Mr. Kogure carrying out his duty as a drill instructor.
Kogure:
 You worthless piece of trash! I'll shove a...
Sousuke:
 That burst of rage is what is expected from a pro.
Kaname:
 A-HA-HA-HA... Or could it maybe be that you're just too dense to tell when someone has it in for you?

*[語　　句]

(パンの配給初日)
Kaname:
 That's it. All we have to do now is sell them at lunch.
 What's wrong, Sousuke?
Sousuke:
 We have no plain rolls.
Kaname:
 Those are always left over. It'd only be a waste.
Sousuke:
 Are we the only one selling them?
Kaname:
 Of course not.
 I've asked Kyoko and the others to help out.
 Collecting the change, getting the aprons ready, getting permission to rent the desks we'll be using as tables,
 nothing's been left out.
Sousuke:
 A brilliant execution.
Kaname:
 We just have to wait for lunch now.
Kogure:
 Mwa-ha-ha-ha, I'm gonna teach 'em a lesson.
 A lesson in tough love! Mwa-ha-ha-ha...
 If this just happen to fall... fall inside the bread...
Kaname:
 Okay, now for the hard part.
 We're gonna have more than a hundred people clawing their way over here.
 I'm counting on you big time.
Mizuki:
 Okay, but don't forget to save some custard pastries for me.
Mikihara:
 All right, we'd better get going, everyone.
Kyoko:
 Let's get the show on the road!
Sousuke:
 Don't touch!
 I thought someone might steal the bread, so I set a trap inside the case.
 It renders prey totally unconscious with high voltage and not only will it knock you out,
 when you finally wake up, you'll have headaches, nausea, palpitations, shortness of breath, and fatigue.
Kaname:
 I can't believe you...
Nursing Teacher:
 Hang in there, Mr. Kogure!
 The paramedics are coming. You'll be at the hospital in no time.
Kogure:
 Ugh... Why you...
Mikihara:
 I wonder what happened to Mr. Kogure.
Kaname:
 He's not getting enough electrolytes, I'd say.
Sousuke:
 Well, it is a demanding job when you have to shout a lot.
 He must be overworked. That's too bad.
Kaname:
 That's it, Sousuke! No more traps starting tomorrow, got it?!
Sousuke:
 I assume you mean the electrified traps, correct?
Kaname:
 Ah...?!
Sousuke:
 Am...

*[語　　句]

(パンの配給２日目)
Students:
 Kabaddi, kabaddi...
Kogure:
 Sagara, you little... Setting a trap like that!
 All I tried to do was mix a few locust legs in with the bread! Mwa-ha-ha-ha...
 No high-voltage curre... is gonna stop me... get ready.
Kyoko:
 Say "cheese!"
Kaname:
 Okay, I'm ready to rake in some dough!
Mizuki:
 You look like you're having fun or something.
Kaname:
 I guess I'm just good at this.
 Huh? Did the sheet just blow off in the wind?
Mikihara:
 It seems that nothing was stolen out of the crates.
Sousuke:
 Hm...
Kaname:
 What's that?
Sousuke:
 I rigged it so tear gas would shoot out when the waterproof sheeting was removed.
 Eyes, nose, and throat feel intense pain on contact.
 Other symptoms include labored breathing, headache, and nausea...
Nursing Teacher:
 Hang in there, Mr. Kogure!
 The paramedics are coming. You'll be at the hospital in no time.
Mikihara:
 I wonder what happened to Mr. Kogure this time?
Kaname:
 Out of season pollen allergies maybe?
Sousuke:
 A nasal inflammation due to allergy.
 And to think he is still reporting for work in spite of such an illness
Kaname:
 Sousuke! Starting tomorrow, no more tear gas!
 No more traps are allowed at all!
Sousuke:
 Oh, what about anti-theft...
Kaname:
 Garh!

*[語　　句]

(パンの配給３日目)
Students:
 Let's go!
Kogure:
 First electricity, then gas! What a nasty, Son of a...!
 All I tried to do was mix in a laxative! This is perfect!
 HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA! Sagara, bring it on!
 What the... Mwa-ha-ha-ha, this'll be the last of you, Sagara! Take this!
 Little punk! How do you like them apples? Bet it hurts, don't it?
 Take that! And that! You like that? You like it?
 Ugh...

*[語　　句]

(パンの配給最終日)
Kaname:
 Whew! We're finally done and I'm glad we've finished with no problems.
Mikihara:
 And starting tomorrow the old bakery is coming back to serve the students again.
Mizuki:
 I guess it was kind of fun after all, huh?
Kyoko:
 Hey guys! I'm taking a picture!
Kaname:
 But, you know, for somebody who complained so much about it
 Mr. Kogure didn't show up at the bread counter at all.
Mizuki:
 Actually, I don't think he's been at school lately.
Kaname:
 He hasn't?
Kyoko:
 Oh, Mr. Kogure? He is, he is taking a leave of absence.
Mikihara:
 Oh...
Mizuki:
 Seriously?
Kaname:
 Maybe he WAS sick after all.
Sousuke:
 That's too bad. He was a fine teacher...

(吹き替えが頑張りすぎの古典)
Man'yoshu:
 [古英語で、『我が背子を、大和へ遣ると、さ夜更けて』と言っている？]
 [古英語で、『暁露に、我れ立ち濡れし』と言っている？]
Sousuke:
 [古英語：我が背子を]
 My brother who was left behind?
 [古英語：遣る] sounds like carry, then the author is carrying his injured brother on his back?
 How does [古英語：大和へ] fit in?
 Yamato was a super dreadnought in the War in the Pacific...
 So the line is depicting someone transporting the injured to the battleship while it was [offering] or firing.
 And the [古英語：暁] must referred to enemy aircraft...
 But, why a battle ship?
 Was there no field hospital close by?
 Moreover the era of the Man'yoshu shouldn't have anything to do with the Second World War.
 It just doesn't make sense.
Shinji:
 Classic aren't your strong suit, huh.
Sousuke:
 I can't help it.
 No one was available in Afghanistan or even Cambodia who could read the Man'yoshu or the Tosa Diary.
Kyoko:
 But that homework is due by fifth period tomorrow.
 If it's late, you'll have to take a remedial lecture next break.
Kaname:
 Ha... The things I have to do... I'll lend you my notes.
 Mr. Fujisaki is very strict, and he'll notice if you copied.
 So just use this as a reference.
Sousuke:
 I had planned to do it on my own though...
Kaname:
 Just take it!
 Don't look a gift horse in the mouth, okay?
Sousuke:
 Okay, I'll borrow it. Thank you.
Kaname:
 All right, good luck!
 Make sure you bring it back tomorrow!
Shinji:
 She's in a real good mood.
Kyoko:
 Did her constipation clear.

*[語　　句]

(ブーフーフーがポイント)
Kaname's note:
 My dear brother is going back to Yamato.
 While I watched him leave, I stood there a long time, bedewed by the dawn.
 Poor old me. Boo hoo hoo.
Sousuke:
 So that's it. "Boo hoo hoo." huh? "Boo hoo hoo."...
 Mission... Accomplished...
Kaname:
 AGHHHHH!!
Sousuke:
 A burglar?!

*[語　　句]

(お約束フラグ回収)
Kyoko:
 She mistook you for a molester?
Shinji:
 So, the lady in that apartment ended up spraying bug spray on you?
 Instead of the cockroach?
Sousuke:
 Yes, it worked better than a round of tear gas.
Kyoko:
 That's what you get for bursting in on her like that!
Kaname:
 Sousuke! Your homework?
Sousuke:
 Completed. Thanks to you.
Kaname's note:
 Good. Now let me have my notes back.
Sousuke:
 Wait a sec. Ah...! Chidori...
Kaname:
 What?
Sousuke:
 I find this hard to say but...
Kaname:
 What's up?
Sousuke:
 This problem must be dealt with in a calm manner.
Kaname:
 Huh?
Sousuke:
 We can't let ourselves come to panic no matter what might happen.
Kaname:
 What do you mean?
Sousuke:
 I forgot to bring your notebook.
 Miss. Chidori, I...
Kaname:
 AGhhh! What are ya gonna do, huh?! What are ya gonna do?!
 I'm gonna have to take a remedial lecture now!
 If I don't work this break, I won't have any spending money next month!
 HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FIX THIS?! AGHHHH...!
Shinji:
 What move was that?
Kyoko:
 That's Japanese Ocean Cyclone Suplex Hold.
 I can't believe there's someone here [who] can pull off such an obscure move!
Shinji:
 That totally came out of nowhere.
Sousuke:
 We have to act quickly.
 I'll go to the teacher's room and inform Mr. Fujisaki and I'm sure he'll understand when I...
Kaname:
 Start running now! Go!
Sousuke:
 Roger!
 I've returned.
Kaname:
 And?
Sousuke:
 It's no good.
Kaname:
 Stop patronizing me!
Sousuke:
 To be precise, Mr. Fujisaki was not present in the teacher's room, according to the other faculty members...
Kaname:
 In that case, we'll just go get my notes.
Sousuke:
 From my place?
Kaname:
 Where do you think? Come on!
Kyoko:
 Wait, Kaname?!
 Hey Shinji, is it okay for them to be taking off at this hour?
Shinji:
 Fifth period's one-thirty.
 That's only fifty-two minutes from now...
 I wonder if they'll make it?

Kaname:
 WOW...!
Hayashimizu:
 What figure?
Kaname:
 Hey, taxi!
Sousuke:
 Ugh...!
Taxi driver:
 Agh.
Sousuke:
 You... trying to kill me?
Kaname:
 Shut up and get in!
 Tigers Mansion in Tamagawa! Next to the tennis club!
 Go! Go! GO!
Sousuke:
 Miss Chidori, I...
Kaname:
 I don't want to hear any excuses.
 I guess it just goes to show how responsible you are.
Sousuke:
 I feel sorry for what I did.
Kaname:
 If saying sorry solved everything, we wouldn't have a war and we wouldn't need soldiers, would we, Sergeant Sagara, the specialist?
 Ah... Forty-five minutes left...
 We'll ride back too, so get him to wait!
Sousuke:
 Roger!
Kaname:
 Agh!... Huff, Huff...
Sousuke:
 Notebook secured.
Kaname:
 Right, let's go back!
 Ah... You did tell him to wait, right?
Sousuke:
 Yes, and I made it very clear.
 I waved my gun and said, "If you leave then I'll..."

(２輪車vs４輪車)
Kaname:
 H-Hang on! This is against the law!
Sousuke:
 Yes, but I'll fix it and bring it back.
 I'm off!
Kaname:
 W-Wait!
 Awesome... Oh-oh.
 The Main streets are no good! Let's take a short cut!
Sousuke:
 Roger!
 A hill? I'm heading up!
Kaname:
 Attaboy! Let's go!
 Should I get off?
Sousuke:
 That's not necessary...
Kaname:
 I can't have you dropping dead from exhaustion.
Sousuke:
 If I should fall... you go on alone.
Kaname:
 Well, that's a given!
 It was your mistake after all! I'd leave you here in a heartbeat if I had to!
 Hey! You made it!
Sousuke:
 We've still got a long way...
Wakana:
 Hey, you, riding double on that bike!
Kaname:
 Uh-oh!
 WHa?! Sousuke?! What the?!
Sousuke:
 We can't get caught riding double on a stolen bike after all we've been through.
Wakana:
 Oh, Yeah!
Kaname:
 Here she comes!
Sousuke:
 Hold on tight, Miss. Chidori.
Wakana:
 I see! What a play!
Kaname:
 Wow, she's persistent, huh!
Police woman:
 Wakana, please just calm down, okay?!
Wakana:
 WA-HA-HA! Just you wait!
Sousuke:
 Get ready!
Kaname:
 Huh?
Sousuke:
 I'm gonna jump!
Kaname:
 What are you talking about?!
 Huh?! HAAAA...!
Sousuke:
 Now!
Wakana:
 Huh! No way!

(危険ですので駆け込み乗車はおやめください)
Kaname:
 Ha, ha... Nobody said you had to go this far, moron!
Sousuke:
 I trusted you're capable of such maneuvers. Let's go.
Kaname:
 It's one-eleven.
 If we can get on the train, I think we can still make it!
Sousuke:
 The rapid service train will depart from this platform in thirty seconds.
Kaname:
 That's it!
 Sousuke, make a run for it!
Sousuke:
 Roger!
Kaname:
 C'MON, MAKE IT! Ugh!
 Oh, plenty of time! It's only one-sixteen now. Haa...
Sousuke:
 And luckily the school is a short walk from the station.
 So it looks like we were able to pull it off.
 We did cut it pretty close though.
Kaname:
 We were pretty over the top, huh?
Sousuke:
 Your ability to take action sometimes catches me off guard.
Kaname:
 Yeah, but we were really in sync there, toward the end and stuff.
Sousuke:
 I agree. We did make quite a good combo.
Announcement:
 Thank you for choosing to ride with us today.
 This is the express train with service to Shinjuku.
 Next stop is Meidaimae, Meidaimae...
Kaname:
 Ugh! This is the express?
 This train doesn't stop at Sengawa...
Sousuke:
 It seems I mistook the weekend schedule for the weekday schedule.
 That's quite out of character for me...
Kaname:
 Die! Sousuke, die! Right here! Right now! Just die!
 If you have any pity, put yourself out of my [misery]! Die! Die! Die!

(お大事に)
Kaname:
 It's over... It's all over...
Sousuke:
 There's something wrong with me today...
 Never in my life have I made such a blunderous series of fatal mistakes like this.
 Well, anyway, I'm sorry Miss. Chidori...
Kaname:
 Am... Hey ya, Sousuke? Ugh! Why didn't you tell me? Running around with a fever, are you out of your mind?!
Sousuke:
 I won't die from something of this level.
Kaname:
 Yes, you will.
 Why did you push yourself so hard? Why? Ah...
 If you had told me you weren't feeling well in the first place,
 I wouldn't have gotten so mad.
Sousuke:
 You'll forgive me?
Kaname:
 It's fine. We'll take the lecture together.
Nursing teacher:
 Thirty-nine point two degrees Celsius. You're lucky.
 There's only one open bed left.
Kaname:
 Mr. Fujisaki?!
Fujisaki:
 Oh, Chidori, it's you...
 Is everyone in Class Four doing the self-study right now?
Kaname:
 What?! Self-study?!
Fujisaki:
 As class representative, you are to collect the homework before the end of the day, all right?
Sousuke:
 So Mr. Fujisaki wasn't mobilized.
Kaname:
 Wha?!
Sousuke:
 When I went to the teacher's room, I heard Mr. Fujisaki had collapsed with a cold, Ah...
 I doubt something as minor as a cold would neutralize him,
 but this cold is really getting to me
Kaname:
 HA-HA-hahaha, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THAT BEFORE?

*[語　　句]

(次回予告)
Kaname:
 Blue skies and a shining sun. Next time we're at the beach.
 Am... Sousuke, why are you polishing your gun?
Sousuke:
 I'm preparing for battle.
Kaname:
 What could you possibly fight on this peaceful beach?
Sousuke:
 Since you're an amateur, you'd probably think that, but look!
 There's a mysterious character observing you.
Kaname:
 Wow, a cute boy!
 Next time, I'm looking forward to "Summer Illusion of Steel"
Sousuke:
 The summer beach is a battle ground.
