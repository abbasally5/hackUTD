(ぶどうぐみ ちどりかなぬ)
Miss Kagurazaka:
 Yes! Good morning, class!
Students:
 Good morning, Miss Kagurazaka...
Miss Kagurazaka:
 Today we're holding a sketching event.
 As this is an activity outside school grounds, I ask that all of you act in an appropriate manner.
Students:
 Yes, ma'am.
Miss Kagurazaka:
 Especially, Sagara! Is that understood?
Sousuke:
 Yes! I will put my skills to good use and defend the safety of our cherished school.
 It's a privilege, ma'am!
Miss Kagurazaka:
 I mean, do you understand the word "appropriate"?
Sousuke:
 Yes! I'll be sure to use the appropriate weapons.
Miss Kagurazaka:
 NO!!
Kyoko:
 Aw...
Kaname:
 Oh...
Miss Kagurazaka:
 Um... ahem.
 And now, we'll hear a few words from Mr. Mizuhoshi, the art teacher.
Mr. Mizuhoshi:
 Our theme is "Humans and Nature."
 It's been quite some time since the cry went out over environmental issues,
 so capturing the relationship between humans and nature with your youthful sensibilities and
 within the boundaries of a frame is an activity fraught with all kinds of meaning!
 If we assume that the word "frame" could hold negative value in view of our reckless courage,
 and daring to refer to superficial philosophical problems and cognitive theory,
 this would truly be "a ladder meant to be thrown away."
 The limitations of the so-called structuralistic approach have been highlighted for some time now.
 At the Alpbach Symposium, Koestler admirably...
Miss Kagurazaka:
 Um... excuse me, Mr. Mizuhoshi?
Mr. Mizuhoshi:
 Aw... Yes, what? Miss Kagurazaka?
Miss Kagurazaka:
 Aha... since we don't have time, please summarize.
Mr. Mizuhoshi:
 All right, I forgot.
Students:
 Ah...
Mr. Mizuhoshi:
 Put simply, our theme is "Humans and Nature."
 It's been quite some time since the cry went out over environmental issues,
 so capturing the relationship between humans and na...
Students:
 Ugh...

(モデルという人身御供)
Kaname:
 In short, we just draw a person and the scenery together.
 And we have to choose a model from one of us here.
Female student:
 That's it? what was the lecture for?
Male student:
 What can you say? He is an idiot.
Kaname:
 So, do we have any candidates for the model?
Students:
 No, not me.
 You have to stand the whole time, it's boring. Yes, very.
Kyoko:
 Well, how about Sousuke then?
 He looks like he'd be good at standing still.
Sousuke:
 Since you consider me good enough then I'll volunteer.
Students:
 Wow.
Kaname:
 Okay, let's decide on a pose.

*[語　　句]

(混ぜるな危険)
Mr. Mizuhoshi:
 Huh? And now for Class Four...
Kaname:
 Look you, guys!
 Making him stand on his head all day would be unreasonable!
Shinji:
 No more unreasonable than doing a reverse bridge like you said...
Male student:
 He can do it if he tries.
Kyoko:
 No he can't.
Shinji:
 It'd be cool if he aimed his gun.
Mr. Mizuhoshi:
 You're Class Four, aren't you?
 Have you selected a model?
Kaname:
 Only you military otaku

Female student:
 How about a batting stance like Sammy Sosa?
Sousuke:
 Yes, it's me.
Male student:
 Talking baseball, I like Sadaharu Oh.
Mr. Mizuhoshi:
 Your name?
Sousuke:
 Sousuke Sagara.
Kyoko:
 But Sousuke's left handed.
Mr. Mizuhoshi:
 Then Class Four is Sagara.
Male student:
 He can bat right.
Sousuke:
 Sir, this is my first time serving in this capacity.
 In order to carry out my mission, I wish to receive your instruction on what a model must do.
Mr. Mizuhoshi:
 Huh, that is a great question!
 Questioning the very essence of such a thing is not something your average student could do.
Sousuke:
 I'm honored, sir.
Mr. Mizuhoshi:
 Oh... ahem. The role of the model is very important!
Sousuke:
 And by that you mean...?
Mr. Mizuhoshi:
 You... ought to become one with nature!
 Blending with the plants, you cause the accepted ideas to break down.
 You mask them and ensnare them.
 To express this process plainly, by switching from an Aristotelian perspective to a "blind force of nature"
 which is depicted by analysis of basic phenomena and deterministic law,
 I believe we can explain this by the system problem in which the correlativity of the hierarchical order
 can be explained as a "tree" in topology.
 In other words, dendritization and reticulization are complementarity principles in the structure of nature.
 This is paradoxical symmetry. [What you will deal with is truly this chimerical venture, and the deepest layer of matter...]
Sousuke:
 I will do my best to apply this.
Male student:
 No, he bats right!
Kaname:
 I said NO!
 O-Okay, we'll just go ahead and have the model sit underneath that tree.
Kyoko:
 That's so boring...
Kaname:
 Huh... Sousuke, come sit down by... Aw...
 Huh? Where is he? Am... Does anyone know?
Shinji:
 Now that you mention it...
Ono-D:
 He's probably off to the bathroom.
Sousuke:
 Sagara here.
Kaname:
 Sousuke, you come back here right now!
Sousuke:
 I cannot do that.
Kaname:
 What?
Sousuke:
 I'm a model. For the sake of art, I must blend in with nature.
 become one with it and mask or something.
Kaname:
 I don't know what you're talking about, but unless you're here, we can't draw.
Sousuke:
 I'm the paradoxical symmetry... or the anti-tank missile...
 or the electric jamming pod or... I'm not sure but I think it's something like that.
Kaname:
 You are the model! That's it! You hear me?!
Sousuke:
 Anyway draw your pictures. I'll be watching you secretly from here.
Kaname:
 Wait... a sec... Man...
Kyoko:
 Well...
Kaname:
 Once again he got the wrong idea.
 We'll pick another model.

*[語　　句]

(水星先生、もう早回し勘弁してください)
Mr. Mizuhoshi:
 No way! No way! No way!
 You shall not change your model!
Kaname:
 But our model's gone missing! We can't find him!
Mr. Mizuhoshi:
 That excuse is not acceptable!
 To remove that model who openly accepted my enthusiasm...
 What exactly are you up to?! It's always the same...
 By uncritically class simulation and curtailing the transparent sublimation of things as they are,
 The masses fail to see the reality on the verge of despair.
Kaname:
 Huh...

*[語　　句]

(サバイバル鬼ごっこ)
Students:
 What?!
Shinji:
 You're saying he won't take anyone other than Sousuke?
Kaname:
 We have no choice.
 So let's all go start looking for him.
Sousuke:
 So you came after all...
 to interfere with my modelling...
 Your information and movements are uncoordinated. A march of raw recruits...
 Just give it your best shot...
Male student:
 Wow!
Male student:
 What's the...
Male student:
 There's a hole!
 Ugh... Is... is this glue?
Male student:
 Did Sagara do that? ...Ugh!
Male student:
 T-This path's not safe... U-Ugh!
 Someone help us!
Male student:
 We can't move!
Male student:
 Who in the right mind would do this?
Kaname:
 Huh?! What's that?! I can't hear you!
Male student:
 I said Sagara's been laying traps for us all over the place.
Kaname:
 Fine. Then just get back here.
 Damn that idiot. He seriously IS trying to lose us.
Kyoko:
 Kaname, Shinji's Bravo Team's been wiped out too!
Kaname:
 Grr... Sousuke, you...!
Ono-D:
 Miss Chidori, we found Sagara!
Kaname:
 Way to go, Ono-D! Now grab him!
Ono-D:
 Leave it to us! Four against one can... AAUGHhh...
Kaname:
 Huh? A-Ah...
 Ono-D, you alive?! Answer me!
Ono-D:
A land mine. He got us...
Kaname:
 Ah...
Ono-D:
 Say, Kaname?
 Remember a while back I told you I liked you, and you turned me down?
 Well, I still feel the same way right now. Ah... cough cough...
Kaname:
 No! Don't die!
Ono-D:
 If... if I make it out of this alive,
 would you reconsider?
Kaname:
 No, not on your life.
Ono-D:
 You're so mean! Arrr...!
Kaname:
 Sousuke! You I will never forgive!

*[語　　句]

(山狩りじゃー！)
Kaname:
 If it takes any longer for us to catch Sousuke, it'll definitely be the end of us. But, We WILL capture Sousuke!
 For the sake of our lost comrades. For the sake of our own human dignity.
 And above all... for the sake of everybody's grades!
Students:
 Yeah!
Kaname:
 We're now engaged in a tough battle.
 If you see a man, kill the man! If you see a god, kill the god!
 No questions asked! No mercy shown! Never mind the casualties, just move forward!
 NOW, FOLLOW ME!
Students:
 YEAH!
Female Student:
 Ahhh!
Kaname:
 Don't let it faze you! Go!
Male Student:
 Ugh!
Kaname:
 C'mon, keep charging!
Female Students:
 Ahhh!
Kaname:
 That was nothing!
Male Students:
 Ugh! Agh!
Kaname:
 I won't lose to you!
 (pant-pant) Almost there... Agh!
Sousuke:
 So it's over. Art is such a cruel thing... Huh?!
Kaname:
 Sousuke!
 You know, you've given us a lot of trouble today...
Sousuke:
 No, wait!
Male Student:
 So, we've finally found you...
Female Student:
 Ready to say your prayer, Sousuke?
Sousuke:
 Um...
Mizukoshi's mother:
 WAIT! COME BACK HERE!

*[語　　句]

(すごいよ宗助さん)
Mizuhoshi's mother:
 Here you are.
Miss Kagurazaka:
 Thank you very much. It's so peaceful here.
 I have to say I'm honestly quite surprised your house is located this close to the venue, Mr. Mizuhoshi.
Mr. Mizuhoshi:
 Yes. I've always found in the atmosphere of this garden an active silence and a flickering image of...
Kaname:
 HEY! WAIT!
Mr. Mizuhoshi and others:
 Huh?
Miss Kagurazaka:
 Wow! S-Sagara?! Miss Chidori?!
Mr. Mizuhoshi:
 Now, you wait just one minute, guys... Ugh!
Kaname:
 Sousuke!
Mr. Mizuhoshi:
 Ugh! Agh!
Mizuhoshi's mother:
 Aw... U-Agh...!
Sousuke:
 Don't move!
 If you value this woman's life then you'll do as... Ugh!
Students:
 Ahhh...! Tie him up!
Sousuke:
 Ugh!
Kaname:
 Well, well, we've finally caught up with you, Sousuke!
Sousuke:
 K-Kill me...
Kaname:
 Huh,ha,ha,ha! Oh, we still have a use for you.
 We'll kill you after that!
Miss Kagurazaka:
 Say, Um, Miss Chidori?
Kaname:
 Now take him away! And get your sketch pads!
Male students:
 Um! Agh...
Miss Kagurazaka:
 Huh? Now wait a minute?

*[語　　句]

(馬鹿の末路)
Principal:
 Brilliant works of art!
 The sensitivities of adolescence! Their youthful vitality! Each one has such fresh brushwork!

Mr. Mizuhoshi:
 Thank you, Principal.
Principal:
 Like these, Class... Four Eleventh Grade... Aw...
 They're so... Aw... They're... What ARE they?
Mr. Mizuhoshi:
 Uh. The students here... appear to have taken a very avant-garde approach.
 You can see the influences of T. Oursler.
 One could say that [you'll all be] emptiness a human feels when one's stripped of power.
 Upon further examination.

(恭子、もう疲れたよ。。。)
Kaname:
 For crying out loud, is that war-nut ever going to adjust, SERIOUSLY?
Kyoko:
Well, it's not like he means any harm.
Kaname:
 That doesn't make it okay
 for him to let a hand grenade off in class!
Kyoko:
 But Kaname, when you're with Sousuke, it always looks like you're having fun.
Kaname:
 I don't know how you see that, lately now, I've just been tired.
Kyoko:
 Huh?
Kaname:
 See, he just doesn't get the strain I'm under.
 I think it's best to put some distance between us.
Kyoko:
 Aw...
Kaname:
 Oh...!
Fuwa:
 Kaname?
Kaname:
 Senior... Fuwa?

(おや？千鳥のようすが。。。)
Ono-D:
That's a lot of stuff you got. Hey, Sagara, what's this?
Sousuke:
 It's a smoke grenade.
Ono-D:
 Oh, huh? Ugh, cough! cough!
 Why didn't you tell me the thing was loaded?
Sousuke:
 I figured you knew better.
Ono-D:
 Kaname. Hey, listen to this!
 Sagara brought another weird thing to... Kaname?
Kaname:
 Well, all things in moderation.
Sousuke & Ono-D:
 Huh?
Engligh teacher:
 All right, class, today we will learn about the subjunctive.
 Open your books to page twenty-four.
 Please take a look at the first example sentence.
Kaname:
 Hah...
Engligh teacher:
 "If I could fly, I would fly to you."
 The subjunctive mood is used to indicate that the speaker is making hypothetical assertion...
Kaname:
 Heh... Hah...
Sousuke:
 Miss Chidori.
Kaname:
 Ugh... What?! A-HA-HA-HA-HA...
Sousuke:
 Something is wrong.
Kyoko:
 Aw... Like what?
Sousuke:
 Chidori... Is a student of faculty member threatening her or something?
 Or do you think it might be drug abuse?
Kyoko:
 Hard to say...
Kaname:
 Good job guys.
 I've got plans today so I'm gonna be leaving early. Bye.
Kyoko:
 O...kay.
Sousuke:
 Chidori.
Kaname:
 Yeah, what?
Sousuke:
 Well... Is there anything that's been bothering you lately?
 If you're in some sort of trouble, I could be of assistance.
Kaname:
 It's nothing. I'm all right, really. So don't worry. See ya!
Sousuke:
 This is bugging me. I am worried.
Kyoko:
 Say, Sousuke, Would you be free Sunday?
Sousuke:
 I could leave that day open...
Kyoko:
 So, do you wanna go somewhere?

*[語　　句]

(不毛不毛ランド)
Fuwa:
 It's been three years, brings back memories...
Kaname:
 You sure it's Okay? 'Cause you've got entrance exams.
Fuwa:
 Hey, I need to relax too. Besides... I couldn't pass up a date with you.
Kaname:
 Oh...
Fuwa:
 Anyway let's just have fun today.
Kaname:
 O-Okay!
Kyoko:
 And that's the situation.
Sousuke:
 Hm.
Kyoko:
 That guy used to be Kaname's senior in middle school. They were close friends.
Sousuke:
 He must be an older at another school.
 If we assume he's gotten close to Chidori in order to steal our school's secrets, that would explain things.
Kyoko:
 Hey, don't be ridiculous!
Sousuke:
 I guess we'll have to put the screws to him.
Kyoko:
 No, Sousuke, we can't.
 If you [were indeed] something like that, Kaname would hate you for sure.
 Watch them first, and then think it over! Okay?
Sousuke:
 If you feel that strongly, I'll leave him for now...
People on the roller coaster:
 Woow!

(ジャパニーズ トラディショナル ヤ・ク・ザ)
Kyoko:
 Now what?
Sousuke:
 Well, so far he doesn't seem to be a spy or a threat of any kind.
 The two of them are... I believe... having a good time.
Kyoko:
 Are you okay?
Sousuke:
 Yes, now I understand the relieved. I feel very situation.
Kyoko:
 Your words are all mixed-up.
Sousuke:
 No problem. Our recon here is over.
 Secure an escape route and thoroughly cover your tracks. Leave your explosives and rations here.
 Our rendezvous is Point Alpha. Tokiwa, reconfirm the chopper's ETA.
Kyoko:
 You know, you look rather flustered, Sousuke.
Sousuke:
 Ah... Anyway we're going home.
Kyoko:
 What.
Sousuke:
 Huh?!
Kyoko:
 Huh?!
Mobster:
 Hey you! It's a middle of the day you two love birds! Good students should be at home hitting their books!
Kaname:
 I don't need an advice from a person who starts drinking at noon. Would you leave us alone?
Fuwa:
 Kaname...
Mobsters:
 What did you say, brat?
 Hic.
Kyoko:
 Professional yakuza! Not good!
Sousuke:
 No problem. I'm a professional soldier.
 It really doesn't make any difference who she's become friends with.
 I WILL protect her.
Kyoko:
 Sousuke, I'm so impressed!
 Oh, but if you jump out like that, they'll find out we followed them here.
Bonta-Kun:

 Huh?
Bonta-Kun:
 Fu... Fumo!
Kaname:
 Uh, hey, Bonta-kun?
Security guards:
 What happened?
Former Bonta-Kun:
 That's him! He is the one who took my costume by force!
Bonta-Kun:
 Fu... Fumoffu!
Security guards:
 This way. Follow him!
 Hey, you, wait!
Fuwa:
 What the heck was that anyway?
 I mean there's no way it could be an attraction...
Kaname:
 A ha ha...
Fuwa:
 But, you know, your outbursts were also pretty out there...
Kaname:
 Oh... yeah, I'm sorry.
 I guess I put you in a dangerous position there, didn't I?
Fuwa:
 It's fine.
 I... I even like that about you actually.
Kaname:
 Huh?
Fuwa:
 Ah... Kaname, look.
 Will you go out with me? See, to be honest, I... I really like you.
 So... Kaname...
Kaname:
 Senior... huh... Ah...
 That idiot...
 I'm sorry.
Fuwa:
 I see...
 So there's someone else that you like?
Kaname:
 Huh?
Fuwa:
 It's just that sometimes you'd get this look on your face as if you were thinking about somebody.
Kaname:
 Oh, well, well I, uh...
Fuwa:
 Well, knowing your tastes, he's gotta be an extremely mature, reliable person, huh?
Kaname:
 Uh, No, he is not. He isn't like that at all!
Fuwa:
 Huh?
Kaname:
 Oh! I, uh... I mean...
Bonta-Kun:
 Fumo, Fumo, Fumo, Fumo... Fumo?
Kaname:
 Go hide in there. Quickly!
Security guards:
 C'mon!
Kaname:
 Ah...!
Security guards:
 Young lady! Did you happen to see a Bonta-kun carrying a gun?
Kaname:
 Aw... He went that way!
Security guards:
 Okay, let's go!
Kaname:
 You can rest easy, Bonta-kun.
Bonta-Kun:
 Fumoffu.
Kaname:
 Thank you for your help.
 Now, I know you've already helped me but could you spare a minute to hear my story?
Bonta-Kun:
 Fumo?
Kaname:
 Today... I went on a date with a guy I used to kinda like.
Bonta-Kun:
 Fumo...
Kaname:
 He was my senior when my days back in middle school. And he really was a good guy.
 Then, just the other day, I ran into him taking a train home from school.
 A minute ago, he asked me to go out with him, but I said no.
 You know, why I told him... No?
Bonta-Kun:
 Fumo?
Kaname:
 I don't really know either. Huh.
 Although, while all this was bugging me, there was someone worried about me.
 Even though he usually doesn't have a clue, for once he asked me,
 "Is there anything that's bothering you?"

Bonta-Kun:
 Huh?
Kaname:
 That... made me happy... Hu...
 Well, that's it! Tomorrow I'll be right back to my usual self, so just rest easy, Bonta-kun!
 See ya!
Security guards:
 There he is! This way!
Bonta-Kun:
 Huh? Fumo!
Security guards:
 You give us back that costume, right now!
 Come back here!
Bonta-Kun:
 Fumoffu. Fumoffu!

 At last, some fierce fighting. An unknown enemy suddenly appears.
 Undertaking a special mission from the Student Council, I'm attacked by a violent storm.
 At the end of this desperate struggle do we find tears, love or broken dreams.
Kaname:
 I couldn't care less. Just clean up after yourselves.
 The student body president will chew me out too if you don't.
