Yakuza1:
Bro!

Yakuza2:
Our late father always used to tell us, a real man has to fight just once in his life, and even then, only if he has ready to die.
Those filthy Misawa cowards, I won't let them do what the hell they want.

Kaname:
Man, why are all yakuza movies the same?

Yakuza1:
Bro.

Kaname:
All they do is grab their swords and charge.
You'd think they'd come up with something better, like blowing the enemy away all at once, or just shooting the boss.

Ren:
Don't you think that's kinda violent?
That sounds like something Sagara would say.
Besides, yakuza swords aren't that bad.
They say if you learn to use it well, it makes you more of a man.
You shouldn't just rely on your piece.

Kaname:
"Your piece"? You mean gun?

Ren:
Yes.

Kaname:
Are you a yakuza movie fan or something?

Ren:
No, not particularly.

Yakuza1:
Bro!

Yakuza2:
Hachi! Hachi!
Come on, Hachi! Hang in there!

Kaname:
Hey, what's wrong?

Sousuke:
Nothing. I just lost out on my private investments.

Kaname:
Investments? You play the stock market?

Sousuke:
No. I worked with Belgian military suppliers to develop new equipment for military and police use.
They were breakthrough products, incorporating the latest in high technology.
But there weren't many buyers.
The FBI and the Miami Police bought some, but now I'm going to have to be responsible for what's left.

Kaname:
Well, I don't understand what happened, but life has its ups and downs, so cheer up, okay?
I'll take you to Ohio for some Triolent-yaki on the way home.

Kaname:
Here. Yogurt flavored.

Sousuke:
This is good.

Kaname:
I tell you, he's just like a dog.

Ren:
You're right.

Sousuke:
What are you talking about?

Yakuzas:
Fine, stinkin' son of a bitch!
Dammit.
Come on! Get out here and fight us, huh?!
You keep screwing around with me I'll frickin' kill you!
You're dead man, boldy!

Kaname:
Oh, hey, look, there's fighting. That's unusual.
As a pro, what's your take on it, Mr. Sergeant?

Sousuke:
That's pitiful.
Their movements are way too linear.
I'd rather see rookie soldiers dance.

Kaname:
I see.
Oh, my! A bold move from a yakuza! It's the Axe Bomber!
Ow, that's gotta hurt!
So, which side do you think is gonna win?

Sousuke:
Both lack firepower and skill so the side that has the most men will win.

Kaname:
Watching stuff like this scares you, huh, Ren?

Ren:
Yeah. But what can we do?

Kaname:
Ah, let them be and they won't hurt you.

Ren:
I don't think that's a good idea.

Kaname:
Huh?

Yakuza:
How pathetic.
Let this be a lesson. Don't stick your nose up at us again.
So, are we clear?
Damn, every one of those punks in the Mikihara gang is nothin' but a bunch of pansies.

Kaname:
Mikihara? Ren Mikihara of the Mikihara gang?!

Ren:
Mr. Shibata!

Shibata:
Miss Ren?
This is so embarrassing.

Ren:
Did you get hurt?

Shibata:
No, Miss. Nothing beyond what you can see. Anyway, thanks. But I'll be fine.

Ren:
Who were the men who did this?

Shibata:
Bunch of punks from the Ryujinkai.
They've been muscling in on our turf more and more lately.
They think they can get away with it because the boss is sick.

Ren:
Don't cry, Mr. Shibata.
You lost to some goons who think they're pro wrestlers, that's all.

Kaname:
Um, excuse me. Hey, Ren. Who are they?

Ren:
They work for my father. You see, my family owns and manages a small private company.

Kaname:
You mean, it manages a yakuza gang?!

Takigawa:
Hey, it's that girl! The one who set that fricking Bonta-kun on us that day we went to the park!

Kaname:
Yeah! So what about it?! Wanna fight? I'll summon Bonta-kun again!
He'll fumoffu your ass 'til you cry!

Shibata:
Summon him? You can actually do that?

Kaname:
Yeah, of course! If I blow my whistle three times, he'll rush in!

Takigawa:
You got to be kidding me!
Ambassador Magma does it that way!

Shibata:
Miss Ren!

Takigawa:
Bro? What the...?!

Shibata:
I did not know she was your friend from school!
I am sorry for committing such a horrible act! Please forgive me!
And...

Kaname:
And?

Shibata:
If you don't mind, I have a favor to ask.

Kaname:
A favor?

Ren:
Greetings, father. It's time to take your medicine now.

Kanji:
Thank you.
Sorry about all the trouble.

Ren:
Oh, no! Father!

Kanji:
It's all right. Don't you worry about me.

Ren:
No, I meant the futon. I don't want it to get stained.

Shibata:
Excuse me!

Kanji:
Another drunken brawl? Give it up already.
You know, you're setting a real bad example for all the younger guys.

Shibata:
Yes, sir! I'm very sorry!

Kanji:
A real man needs to fight just once in his life. Once.
But you! You're doin' it every frickin' week, Shibata!
Acting like your life's not worth crap.
And your little boy is five years old. You should be ashamed of yourself.

Shibata:
Yeah, but, boss, it was a different situation with these guys.

Kanji:
And how it that?

Shibata:
They were from the Ryujinkai.
Boss, I don't know how to say this, but to be straight with you, we can't guard our turf by ourselves.
We're just too outnumbered.
That's what I wanted to talk about.
I was thinking, why don't we go hire a bodyguard?
In fact, I ran into somebody today with just the skills we needed!

Kanji:
Is he strong?

Shibata:
Well, yeah! He was saying something about having been a soldier overseas for a long time, and uh, things like that!
Instructor!
Boss, allow me to introduce you.
The bodyguard, Bonta-kun, and his interpreter Miss Chidori.

Bonta-kun:
Fumoffumoffu.

Kaname:
Greetings, sir.

Bonta-kun:
Fumofumo. Fumoo. Fumoffu.

Kaname:
Umm, Bonta-kun says, "it is an honor to meet you."
"Boss, if it's a combat instructor you want, leave it to me."

Bonta-kun:
Fumofumo, mofufu. Fumo, fumoffu. Fumo!

Kaname:
Umm, "Just sit back and watch me turn your underlings into fine soldiers."
"There's nothing to worry about. I am a professional."

Kanji:
Hey Shibata.

Shibata:
Sir?

Kanji:
Look, you. I don't know if you're trying to torture me because I'm sick, but don't you think you went a little too far? Shibata, don't you?!
I'm the bastard everyone around here calls "Kanji the Killer!"
I'm not some softy who'll stand being made a fool out of by some kid!

Bonta-kun:
Fumo!
Fumo mo mo mo mo mo mo! Fu mo!

Shibata:
Hey, Boss!

Ren:
Father!

Bonta-kun:
Fumoffu, fumomomomo, fumo fumo fumoffu, fumofumo.

Kaname:
"You shouldn't judge people by their appearances."
"Doing that on the battlefield could get you killed."

Kanji:
Damn, frickin' you stuffed animal!
But I gotta admit, you're strong.

Ren:
Father!

Shibata:
Oh, no! Boss!


Shibata:
What are you doing?

Bonta-kun:
Fumo! Fumofumofumo fumoffu fumoffu.

Kaname:
"This gun is called a T-54."
"It's the enemy's main weapon so familiarize yourself with its force and what it sounds like!"

Bonta-kun:
Fumoffu, fumofumo, fuumofumoffumo.

Kaname:
Umm, "You're all a bunch of worthless scum! Absolutely helpless babies."
"But with the proper training and under my command you'll be capable of performing any kind of mission."
"So quit dragging your feet, you..."
Hey, don't look at me, I'm just...

Shibata:
Oh, yeah. You're right. Bonta-kun's got a point.
You pansies! What's with the faces?
Now listen up, ladies! I found this instructor and brought him here personally. And if any of yous have a problem with that then I'll take you on myself!

Kaname:
Now, now, calm down.

Bonta-kun:
Fumoooo!

Kaname:
"Attention!"

Bonta-kun:
Fumofumofumoffu!

Kaname:
"We train now! One lap around the town!"

Yakuza:
Yes, sir...

Bonta-kun:
Fumoooo!

Kaname:
"Move it!" or something.

Kanji:
So, after seven generations, the end of the Mikihara gang is come.

Ren:
Oh, father, why don't I bring you some tea?

Bonta-kun and yakuza:

Bonta-kun:
Fumoffu. Fumoruru.

Kaname:
"Don't waste any movement taking down an enemy and when you attack, don't yell."

Shibata:
Sir! Understood. All right. You guys, give it a try!

Yakuza:
Sir!
Take this!
Bring it on!

Bonta-kun:
Fumofu fumooo?!

Kaname:
"I said no yelling!"

Bonta-kun:
Fumo. Fumofumo!

Kaname:
"Now you try."

Yakuza:
Yes, sir.
Give up, bastards!

Bonta-kun:
Fumooo! Fumofu mofumofumoffumo!

Kaname:
"You'll be nothing but a sitting duck out there!"

Shibata:
Beat them to a bloody pulp!

Bonta-kun:
Fumomomomomomoffu! Fumo, fumo, fumoffu!

Kaname:
"Quit messing around and use your head for once, will you?!"

Shibata:
But sir, it doesn't matter what I do, my body just gonna moves without me even thinking about it.

Bonta-kun:
Fumomomo! Fumo! Fumo!

Kaname:
"Don't give me that! You're acting like street punks!"

Shibata:
Yeah, but we are street punks.

Ryujinkai:
Damn Mikihara bastards.
I was wondering what they were up to, but they're just out here playing with a stuffed animal.
Looks like even "Kanji the Killer" has fallen.
I think it's high time for us to teach that son of a bitch a lesson for ignoring all the warnings we sent to him and his people.
You're right. I gotta an idea about how we can do that.
Oh, yeah?
See, I found out boss Mikihara has a teenage daughter.
Really?
We can have some fun with her if you know just what I'm talking about, hey, bro.
You pervert.

Kaname:
They're nothing like that rugby club, you know!
They're all just so hot-blooded.

Sousuke:
I thought if there was some way that we could increase the Mikihara gang's fighting power, it would be a deterrent, and thus we could avoid a fight.

Kaname:
You mean, if both sides are strong, then neither one is able to interfere with the other?

Sousuke:
Right.
There's really no need to be stronger than the enemy.
The only thing you need to do to make them give up is force them to acknowledge that you could give them a good fight.
It's a frequently used survival tactic.

Kaname:
The problem now is that they're too confident about themselves.

Shibata:
Sir, we've gotten a lot stronger since you came here, haven't we?

Takizawa:
Yeah! We'll really be able to round up all those stupid Ryujinkai punks now.

Bonta-kun:
Fumoffu! Fumofumofumoffu.

Kaname:
"Don't get cocky! You're still a bunch of cute little baby chicks!"

Shibata:
Uh, cute maybe but, baby chicks, I...

Bonta-kun:
Fumoffu! Fumoffu, fumo fumo fumoffu fumoffu!

Kaname:
"Quiet! You are to avoid engaging the enemy till I give approval. And that's an order!"

Shibata:
Sir...

Ren:
Miss Chidori.

Kaname:
Oh, hi Ren.
All right, then, Sousuke, see you later.

Ren:
Later? You guys have plans?

Kaname:
Don't worry about it.

Voice:
Vetronics activated.
Actuators connected.
Final activation check. Check complete.

Sousuke:
Close hatch and adjust to Mode 4.
Set Bilateral Angle at 3.5.

Voice:
Roger. Mode 4, BMSA 3.5. Complete.

Sousuke:
Voice changer, disengage.

Voice:
Roger. Voice changer, disengaged.

Sousuke:
Why does this keep happening?
Voice changer, engage now!

Voice:
Roger. Voice changer, engaged.

Bonta-kun:
Fumoffu!

Children:
Hey! It's Bonta-kun!

Shibata:
Sir!

Bonta-kun:
Fumo?!

Takigawa:
I'm so sorry. I went to pick up Ren and Kaname, and on the way back we got attacked.
Sir! Please, please save them!

Sousuke:
What should I do?
The Ryujinkai only have 40 people.
So I could take them out if I used some powerful firearms, but there would be a lot of casualties.
If only I had allies.

Shibata:
Come on! You know you count on us to go with you, sir!

Yakuza:
Yeah! Let us at 'em!

Bonta-kun:
Fumo.

Sousuke:
But these guys are weak.
If I brought them along, they'd just die like dogs.
If only I had equipment for this kind of...

Bonta-kun:
Fumoffu!

Kaname:
Why in the world am I always having to be kidnapped by bad guys like this?

Ren:
Oh, my. Miss Chidori, have these things happen to you a lot before?

Kaname:
Thanks to a particular idiot.

Ryujinkai Boss:
Well, now. You are two very pretty ladies.

Ren:
Excuse me, who are you?

Ryujinkai Boss:
Me? I'm the Ryujinkai Boss.
As for you two girls, you're gonna help us by being the goods that'll get the Mikihara gang off this turf once and for all.

Kaname:
We are the goods? What are you talking about?

Ryujinkai Boss:
First, we gotta let your buddies know that we mean business, you see?

Ryujinkai:
What in the hell?!
Those bastards! Which gang are they? Find them! Go!

Bonta-kun:
Fumoffuru!
Fumoffuru!

Ryujinkai:
What the hell is that?

Bonta-kun:
Fumoffu!
Fumoffu!
Fumo?
Fumoffu!
Fumo!
Fumoffu! Fumo! Fumo!
Fumoffu!

Sousuke:
This equipment really is useful. I wonder why the sales won't be better.

Ryujinkai:
This can't be happening!

Ryujinkai Boss:
Moron! What are you doing?

Ryujinkai:
Oh, Boss! it's Bonta-kun. Bonta-kun's attacking!

Bonta-kun:
Fumoffu!
Fumoffu! Mofuu!

Ryujinkai Boss:
Stay back! Impossible. Bonta-kun?
My whole gang was beaten by Bonta-Kun?!

Bonta-kun:
Fuumo, fumo fumo. Mofu!

Kaname:
Umm, he's telling you to surrender.

Ryujinkai Boss:
You're kidding me! You're telling me I'm gonna die if I don't surrender to a frickin' stuffed teddy?
Stay back! I'm telling you, you better stay the hell back!

Bonta-kun:
Fumoffu!

Ryujinkai Boss:
I don't believe it.

Bonta-kun:
Fumofumofumofumo. Mofumofumoru! Fumo!

Ryujinkai Boss:
I don't get a single word you're sayin'.

Policeman:
Hello. Sengawa Police. What?! What happened to the Ryujinkai?!
What do you mean they're done for?! Bonta-kun did what?!

Wakana:
It's him! That yellow bastard's back again!

Kaname:
I can't imagine more embarrassing way to be rescued.

Ren:
You think so? I think our rescuers are rather cute.

Kaname:
I didn't wanna bloody end like the movies but I'm not sure how I feel about being rescued by bonta-kun, either.

Newswoman:
Here is the latest news. In Miami, Florida, a large scale drug smuggling operation was exposed at a shopping mall yesterday.
For this particular bust the investigation team utilized new equipment that was purchased by a special budget.

Reporter:
Great job, officer. Did you feel at risk at all here?

Miami Bonta-kun:
Fumoffu!


（次回予告）

Sousuke:
Flirting? Hah. No big deal.
With my techniques, I can get any woman I want in an instant.

Kaname:
Do you really understand what "flirting" means?

Sousuke:
Of course. I can make any girl my prisoner.

Kaname:
All right, if you think you can do it, then show me.

Sousuke:
No problem. No problem at all.

Kaname:
Next time: "Uncontrollable Bluebird."
I'm looking forward to this! Really looking forward to it!

Sousuke:
What? We can't use any weapons or traps?!
