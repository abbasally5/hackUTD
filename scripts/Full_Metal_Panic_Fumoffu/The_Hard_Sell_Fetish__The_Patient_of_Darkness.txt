Kaname:
A student council announcement? What's this?
Starting with last weekend, there have been many attempted assault within the school district.
Of those, seven involved a 'sex offender' likely a single perpetrator.
Some reports mention a 'pony' but it's unclear what that may mean.
What to do when you meet a 'sex offender.'
(a) Engage and annihilate the enemy.
(b) If (a) proves difficult, obtain what intelligence you can and withdraw.
Air or artillery cover will not be provided.
Look Sousuke.
You aren't gonna get your point across with such an unfriendly writing style.

Kyoko:
A pervert? Scary.

Sousuke:
Well, it appears she understands it.

Kaname:
At any rate, starting next time try using simpler language like normal people use.

Sousuke:
Understood.

Kyoko:
Huh?

Pony:
Pony.

Kyoko:
Wha...?

Pony:
Pony, pony. Pony. Pony.

Kyoko:
Oh no! Go away!
Somebody! Help me!

Pony:
Pony!



Kaname:
Oh, hey, Sousuke!
Good morning.
Huh? What's going on?

Sousuke:
Kaname. Actually, I've got some bad news for you.
The sex offender...

Kaname:
What did you this time?

Sousuke:
Last night he assaulted Kyoko.

Kaname:
N-No way! Not Kyoko. Well, what happened to her? Is she all right?

Sousuke:
I'm sorry. I'm not quite sure how to explain it.

Kaname:
It can't be...

Sousuke:
It seems she met a pervert in a strange costume on her way home.
He seized her before she could make a counter attack.
And forced her down on the spot despite her struggling.
After combing her hair meticulously with a brush...

Kaname:
Oh, no...

Sousuke:
He gave her a ponytail.

Kaname:
That's just so... He, what?

Kyoko:
Oh, it's Kaname. Good morning!

Kaname:
What is this?

Sousuke:
The pervert's signature.

Kyoko:
A ponytail. My hair was pulled back with wire and glue. I washed it like five times but I can't get it out.

Kaname:
That's all?

Kyoko:
That's it. Although, it was scary.

Sousuke:
It's odd, huh? It defies description.
You know that smarts.

Kaname:
Shut up! You've really had me worried there, I swear, Sousuke.
It's too bad about Kyoko.

Sousuke:
Yes. Since one of our school's students was a victim we should capture the perpetrator, torture him severely and extract from him his true intentions.

Kaname:
Don't be creepy. At times like these we should let them handle it.

Kaname:
Excuse me?

Police:
Yes?

Kaname:
I'd like to report an attack by a sex offender.

Wakana:
Sex offender? I'm afraid we can't talk here. Come with me!

Kaname:
Huh? Hey, wait a minute.

Wakana:
Come on!

Kaname:
Miss Yoko Wakana?

Wakana:
Yeah. I'm really in a traffic division but I ditched that to investigate the sicko.
I've even cut down on sleep! And look at this!
There's been eight reports of similar attacks appearing alternately in the North and South.
If it follows the pattern he'll show up around here.
So, tonight I'd like you to go out there and act as a decoy.

Kaname:
What? Why should I have to do that?

Wakana:
Wouldn't you like to settle the score for your friend?
Plus, a little while ago, I made a big mistake and as a consequence I got reassigned to desk work.
But you know, a big arrest could put me back on active duty. So...

Kaname:
A big mistake like what?

Wakana:
Well, it's pretty embarrassing. I was in my patrol car chasing two students riding double on a bike but they were tough.
And not only did I not catch them I slammed right into the guardrail at full speed.
I wasn't hurt at all but the patrol car was totaled.

Kaname:
How terrible. I'm sorry to hear that.

Wakana:
Of the two, I remember the guy's face very well.
And when I found him he'll get all kinds of corporal punishment, officer Wakana style.

Kaname:
No! Don't!

Wakana:
Why shouldn't I put the hard on him?

Kaname:
Oh, no. That isn't...
Now, look. Would you just knock it off?

Wakana:
Ah, what's wrong?

Kaname:
Nothing. Sometimes I can hear radio waves. Strange whispers, it's a chronic ailment.

Wakana:
Well, that's all for now, civilian. I'm counting on you tonight.

Kaname:
Ah, wait a sec.

Wakana:
If you don't show up I'll arrest you too.

Kaname:
So does this mean I gotta pay?

Sousuke:
Chidori, are you really accepting this decoy assignment?

Kaname:
I wanna settle the score for Kyoko. And besides, it really is our fault for making that lady as agitated as she is.

Sousuke:
All right. Then as a precaution I'll cover you. If she should threaten you I'll subdue her.

Kaname:
No, you can't.

Sousuke:
Your face is the one she remembers.

Sousuke:
In that case, I'll use my new equipment.
I've made several improvements to some gear I acquired recently.
It's a type of reinforced suit with a sensor array, a digital communication device and bullet-proofing that can stop even rifle bullets.
If all goes well, it could radically change the face of modern warfare.
Okay, they're moving out.

Bonta-kun:
Fu... moffu!
Fumo? Fumomo!

Wakana:
I heard you were a guy in a horse costume.
I never figured you'd be Bonta-kun.

Sousuke:
Wait!

Bonta-kun:
Fumomo!

Wakana:
Eat this!

Bonta-kun:
Fumomomomo!

Sousuke:
Stop!

Bonta-kun:
Fumoffu. Fumo. Fumo.

Wakana:
You can still move!? I'll change that!
So you're gonna put up a fight, you pervert!

Sousuke:
There's no clear shot.

Wakana:
Here's the saving my career by turning you into a speck of dust!
There's no escape! Now who's the predator!

Sousuke:
There's still some practicality issues.

Kaname:
I wonder if he'll really show up.

Pony:
Pony.

Kaname:
Someone! There's a pervert! And a really weird one too.
Please help me! Noooo!

Wakana:
This is fun! This is really fun, Bonta-kun.
Let's you and me have some more fun! You won't beat me!
Take this!
Man, you're irritating! Drop already!
Begging won't help, you furball!
You're strong for rats!
I win!

Kaname:
Someone! Help me!

Wakana:
That's the perp!?
So then, who the heck is this?

Kaname:
Oh, this is my friend. Right, Bonta-kun?

Wakana:
Yeah? Well, you have a really strong friend there.

Kaname:
Man, I can't believe she's actually buying it.

Kaname:
So you guys are boding over weird noises?

Wakana:
In any case, it was my active role that led to the suspect's arrest.

Kaname:
But all you did was go on a rampage.

Wakana:
Okay, now was when you get to tell us exactly why you did this.

Pony:
I didn't mean to be so hard sell but ponytails totally rock.
The bare neck of short hair, the gentle feminity of long hair, the ponytail perfectly combines these two contradictory elements.
In spite of this, lately I just haven't seen girls with ponytails around anymore.
It makes me so sad to think about it.

Wakana:
That's why you turned to this bizarre crime?

Pony:
Yes. But officer, I'm happy. I lived in a way that was true to myself.

Wakana:
Well, you'll be put away for a long time. So you take care of yourself in prison.

Pony:
I will. Sorry for all the trouble.

Kaname:
This is wrong. There is something very very wrong here.

 Kaname:
The old man trembled. It can't be... It simply can't be!
With that thought he opened and closed the lid of the shumai box again and again.
And so, one by one the shumai disappeared.
In the end, all twelve of them vanished.
When he lifted the lid for the last time he realized the shumai that had disappeared were all stuck to the bottom.
It's too early to be scared.
There's still more to the story.
One day, the old man died.
And this is what happened at his funeral.
Before they carried the coffin out of the house they had a viewing of the body.
"It's the last time we'll see him," they said.
So the mortician opened the lid of the coffin in front of everyone.
Now the coffin was open but the old man was stuck to the bottom of the lid!
Well, how was that story, Sousuke?

Sousuke:
I don't know.

Kaname:
So, come on, Sousuke, nothing?

Mizuki:
Look, it's pointless. I'm telling you he has no imagination.

Kyoko:
Maybe Sousuke'd get a little scared if you showed him some real examples of ghosts and goblins.

Kaname:
Speaking of which, there's a hospital that went under nearby.
There was a big fire ten years ago.

Mizuki:
A hospital that went under... Hey, that sounds like fun.

Kyoko:
Kaname, you don't mean...

Kaname:
That's right. How about we go take Sousuke to that hospital right now?

Kyoko:
You'd better not do it, Kaname. I've heard all kinds of scary rumors about that hospital.

Kaname:
Even better. If it'll scare the crap out of Sousuke...

Mizuki:
Kyoko's a scaredy-cat, huh?

Kaname:
She run into a sex offender the other day. Let's give the girl a break.

Mizuki:
Yeah.
Ah, so this is the hospital?

Kaname:
Now, this is what I'm talking about.

Sousuke:
Looks like the aftermath of a bombing.

Kaname:
What's wrong, Mizuki?

Mizuki:
T-There! Over by the window!
There was a strange old lady watching us just now.

Kaname:
I'm not buying it.

Mizuki:
She was there! Just now she was smiling and looking at us!

Kaname:
Very funny. You're a natural born actor. Really.

Mizuki:
You-You idiot! What are you saying? This place is way too dangerous.
I'm going home!

Kaname:
Honestly, between her and Kyoko...

Sousuke:
It's rather illogical. I just don't understand why Mizuki would be that frightened.

Kaname:
I know. Things like that before we go in takes all the fun out of it.

Sousuke:
The old lady was just standing there.

Kaname:
What was that?

Sousuke:
I said the old lady at the window was just standing there.

Kaname:
What? So, you saw her too?

Sousuke:
There's no way she'd spot it without me noticing.
Now if the old lady were equipped with a gun or a rocket rauncher I could see her being scared but...
What's wrong, Kaname? Are you feeling sick?

Kaname:
Aren't you... aren't you, like, scared at all?

Sousuke:
Scared of what?

Kaname:
Of what!? Don't you think it's weird for an old lady to be out here at this hour?

Sousuke:
Perhaps the old lady is from the neighborhood and got lost.
Don't worry. If we find her we'll take her to the police.

Kaname:
I-I guess that sounds like a reasonable explanation.

Sousuke:
So, aren't you going in?

Kaname:
Huh?

Sousuke:
I don't see why but if you're scared you can go home.

Kaname:
I-I'm perfectly fine, okay? All right, I'm going in!

Sousuke:
Why are you so mad?

Kaname:
I am not mad!

Sousuke:
What's wrong?

Kaname:
Ah, um, why don't you go in first?




Kaname:
How about now? Aren't you scared?

Sousuke:
Scared of what?

Kaname:
I guess atmosphere alone isn't enough.

Sousuke:
Well, that's odd.

Kaname:
That's it? You just think it's odd?
Come on! Don't you like feel anything else?
A-A child was...

Sousuke:
Yes. That's why I said it was odd.

Kaname:
That's scary. It's scary, right?

Sousuke:
Despite what you say, it's only a child.
He couldn't defeat someone who's familiar with all sorts of weaponry like I am.

Kaname:
Oh, come on! You're so abnormal to act that way in response to something like that!
Could anyone be more obtuse than you!?

Sousuke:
I'm not entirely sure but what you're saying sounds quite rude.
What are you going to do?
I'm concerned about the old lady on the fourth floor but if you're getting cold feet I don't mind if you go home now.

Kaname:
What are you trying to say!? I do not have cold feet!

Sousuke:
Then let's go.

Kaname:
Don't you feel nervous coming to a place like this at all?

Sousuke:
Not at all. Because as long as you stay on the lookout you should be able to spot any land mines or booby-traps.

Kaname:
Ah, that's not quite what I meant.

Sousuke:
Please stand back.

Kaname:
Why did you do that?

Sousuke:
There's a booby-trap that triggers an explosion when you pick up the phone.
One of my comrades fell victim to such a trap in the ruins of Lebanon.
Hello? This hospital's been closed for many years so if this is an emergency please call 119 to obtain ambulance and medical assistance.
I don't think that they're listening. Humph.

Kaname:
Ah, is someone there?

Voice:
I can't breath! It's so hot! Help me! The pain! The pain! The pain!

Kaname:
Wha-What the heck!?

Sousuke:
Somebody needs help. They probably called not knowing this place went under.

Kaname:
No! That's not the problem! Don't you think this is all too weird!?
It's like one unnatural thing after another!

Sousuke:
Wouldn't it be better if you went home afterall?
You're probably tired right now.

Kaname:
Somehow the look in your eyes pisses me off.

Sousuke:
I'm just concerned for you.

Kaname:
Well, you don't have to be!
Why do you keep saying I'm the one who's scared anyway, huh!?
I'm not, you know!
What about that!?

Sousuke:
I'm just glad it's not a bomb.

Kaname:
Forget it! Next!
And this?

Sousuke:
It's only voices.

Kaname:
Scratch that! Next!

Girl:
Go back home or drop dead. Go home, drop dead.

Kaname:
And this? What do you think about this, huh?

Sousuke:
Despite what you think, with only a hammer she couldn't do...

Kaname:
It's not her weapon! She soaped in blood! That's scary, isn't it!?
And you! Can't you do anything cooler like spit poison gas or do some kind of mysterious dance?
And wipe that smile off your face!

Sousuke:
Kaname, get back here!

Kaname:
Be quiet!

Kaname:
Huh? Where am I?
Oh, that's right. I fell to the floor or something, didn't I?
That's a lot of blood. Am I gonna die?

Sousuke:
Kaname! Get up! Answer me! No, hold on! Don't move. Don't talk. Stay there.
I'll come to you. Just wait.

Kaname:
Sousuke, why are you so jittery?

Sousuke:
Are you hurt, Kaname?
Kaname, are you all right?

Kaname:
I don't really know.

Sousuke:
What's this?

Kaname:
Paint can? What's going on?

Takami:
Excuse me, are you all right?

Yoshiki:
Hey, that's Mr. Sagara!

Sousuke:
Yoshiki?

Gen:
Are you injured?

Kaname:
In other words, you guys are putting on an act like that to help out Mr. Gen who lives here?

Yoshiki:
Yeah, what happened was a lot of couples and delinquents kept coming here and picking on him.

Takami:
We thought maybe if people heard the place was haunted they would stop wanting to come bother him.

Gen:
It seems to have worked pretty well. The number of people coming has dropped off.
Thank goodness for that.

Kaname:
That explains a lot. I mean Mizuki got scared and ran off after seeing that old lady in the window.

Yoshiki:
An old lady!?

Kaname:
The old lady you plopped up next to this one window.
What was it? A mannequin?

Takami:
What are you talking about?

Kaname:
Huh?

Gen:
Oh, that lady. It's probably someone who died in the fire ten years ago.
She's been showing up on and off for a while now.

Gen's mother:
So, they've finally gone home.

Gen:
Mom, I have a feeling those kids won't be coming near here ever again.
This place was dad's pride and joy when he was a hospital director.
And now that he's gone, he'd want us to live a peaceful life here.

Gen's mother:
You said it, son.

Sousuke:
Are you awake?

Kaname:
Yeah, I'm fine. I'll walk now.
Hey, Sousuke.

Sousuke:
Yes.

Kaname:
Were you scared?

Sousuke:
I'm scared of what?

Kaname:
When I fell and it looked like I was all covered in blood.

Sousuke:
Yes.

Kaname:
Huh?

Sousuke:
Oh, nothing.

Kaname:
What's that? I had trouble hearing what you said!

Sousuke:
Don't worry. Forget it.

Kaname:
Nope. So what was you said just now? What was it, huh?

Sousuke:
N-Nothing! Kaname, I am saying...

Kaname:
Tell me!
If you don't tell me what you said I'll give you something to really be afraid of. So let's hear it!

Sousuke:
Keep steady!


(次回予告)

Kaname:
Cleaning a rugby ball? What's up with that, Sousuke?

Sousuke:
It looks like next time we're doing a rousing, touching, sports story.

Kaname:
Can you make these crybabies into tough guys?

Kaname:
Leave it to me. Mao has supplied me with a recruit training manual.
In one week I'll transform them into heartless war machines.

Kaname:
Tune in next time for "The War Cry of Excessiveness."
Gung Ho! Gung Ho! Gung Ho!

Sousuke:
By the way, why are you wearing naval attire?
