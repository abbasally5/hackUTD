Goda:
No, it can't be!
What... What are you saying we did wrong?
Whatever our club's done it's done in earnest.
You could take my word. It's the truth!

Principal:
I am fully aware of that.

Goda:
Then I don't see why you're eliminating our club.
All that we've done, like sprucing up the clubhouse, maintaining the playing field, taking care of all those cute bunnies...

Principal:
Yes, I know.

Goda:
Playing with all the kids from the local neighborhood, visiting the lonely elderly people...

Principal:
Yes. It's outstanding.

Goda:
And we've done other volunteer work.
So why I ask you.

Principal:
If you really do not understand, then let me clue you in.
Here is the reason.
Your club is not a club dedicated to volunteer work.
You're supposed to be playing rugby!

Student:
Coach! We were so wrong!
You always had best interests in us!
But we didn't listen, so... forgive us...

Teacher:
It's all right.
As long as each one of you boys understands that, I'll be satisfied.

Students:
Coach!

Teacher:
Why are you crying?
Come on team, let's race toward the setting sun!

Student:
Yes, sir!

Kaname:
Wow, what a great story!
The tale of a band of hopeless losers.
And their amazing rise to victory.

Sousuke:
Is it that fun to watch a group of incompetents win?

Kaname:
Yes, it is.
Seeing weaklings, who despite all their faults, show signs of promise and try their best makes you wanna cheer them on. It's only natural.

Mikihara:
Forgive us for being so late.

Hayashimizu:
Sorry we had to negotiate with the principal.
The business we called you in for is none other than this.
It is the matter of our rugby club.

Kaname:
Umm, let me get this straight.
Our school has a rugby club?

Hayashimizu:
Yes, it does.
Miss Mikihara.

Mikihara:
Yes.
Jindai High School's Rugby Club has a tradition of close to fifty years.
Twenty years ago they almost made it to the nationals at the Hanazono Rugby Stadium, but for over ten years now, they haven't won a single interschool match.
Due to their poor performance and their lack of enthusiasm for the game, at last week's staff meeting the principal made the decision to disband the rugby club.

Hayashimizu:
However, this clearly interferes with the autonomy of the Student Council.
So, I conferred with the principal, and we settled on one condition.

Kaname:
What is it?

Hayashimizu:
Next week, the rugby club will hold practice match against powerhouse Garasuyama High.
And if they win, the principal will reconsider.
If they lose, they must disband.

Kaname:
What are their chances?

Hayashimizu:
No.

Mikihara:
Up until now Jindai High has played forty-nine matches with Garasuyama high and has lost to total of forty-nine times.
Presently, the rugby club has fourteen members.
They still need one more to play the game.

Kaname:
So they have no chance at all, then.

Hayashimizu:
A chance is not something you're given.
It's something you must seize.
After that, it's up to them.

Kaname:
Well, you're probably right, but...

Hayashimizu:
Still, I think I'll give them some provisional support.
I've decided to send them an extra player and a team manager from the Student Council.

Kaname:
Huh?

Hayashimizu:
You heard what I said.
An extra player and a team manager.

Kaname:
But why do I have to?

Hayashimizu:
Starting tomorrow, I have to chair the Tama District High School Self-Governance conference.
In short, five consecutive days of sheer boredom.
If you care to take my place, I will happily surrender it to you.

Kaname:
Rugby is fine, all right.

Hayashimizu:
Miss Mikihara, do you have the items?

Mikihara:
Yes, I have them right here.

Kaname:
A kettle?

Hayashimizu:
Essential for female team managers.
In addition, there is one another thing.
While I think you have attractive legs...

Kaname:
Wh-What about them?

Hayashimizu:
Your skirt is much too short.
Miss Mikihara, if you would, please?

Mikihara:
Yes, next item.

Kaname:
What's that?

Hayashimizu:
All female team managers wear sailor suits and at its absolute shortest, the length of the skirt is fixed at just above the knee.

Kaname:
That's an awfully biased view, you know.

Hayashimizu:
It's nothing of the sort.
It's dedication and aesthetics.

Sousuke:
Kaname, are you familiar with the sport called rugby?

Kaname:
Not really.
About the only thing I know is that it's pretty much a bunch of sweaty, mud-caked guys engaging in a fierce struggle.

Sousuke:
So it's a combat sport.

Kaname:
Well, it seems that they at least use a ball.
Oh, I hate this!

Sousuke:
What's your objection?

Kaname:
How should I put this?
I bet it's gonna reek in there!
I mean, you cram a bunch of big, burly guys inside a messy room, it's like, I feel I'm gonna get pregnant just by coming in contact with them.

Sousuke:
Really?

Kaname:
Yes, really.

Goda:
Ah, coming!
You must be Miss Chidori and Mr. Sagara.
How do you do?
Senior Hayashimizu's been kind enough to fill me in.
I'm Yu Goda, captain of our little team.
Let's all work hard together for the big game next week.
But enough standing around chit-chatting, come in. it's a little messy, but...

Kaname:
Um... This is the rugby club, right?

Goda:
Oh, but of course.

Kaname:
But this is... so...

Goda:
Now don't be shy. Please take a seat.

Rugby player:
Right now one of the guys is out buying some cake at the bakery in front of the train station.

Rugby player:
And their gateau Chocolat, oh it's simply fabulous.

Rugby player:
I know, I can't wait!

Sousuke:
I'm a bit surprised.
I guess this rugby must be a peaceful sport, then.

Kaname:
Something's not right...

Sousuke:
Chidori, get down, now!

Rugby player:
Oh, watch out!
Are you all right?
Careful! It'd be just awful if you got hurt.

Kaname:
What's wrong, Goda?

Goda:
I just got scared, that's all.
This little guy just popped up out of nowhere...

Kaname:
A spider?

Goda:
What should we do, Miss Chidori?
It'd be scary to leave it in the room, but it'd be a real shame to kill it.

Kaname:
Hey, you gonna practice or what!?

Goda:
We're making sure nothing dangerous has fallen on the ground.

Rugby player:
Oh dear! What a big rock!
Look!
Oh, wow!

Goda:
Good job finding that.
It would've been just dreadful if someone fell on such a rock.

Rugby player:
You said it!
Are you ready? Alley oop!
Hey, not so fast!
Do it more slowly. Like this.
You mean like this?
Oh, good. That's good. Very good.
Okay, one more. Alley oop!
Hey, that's great! Nice pass, man! Such xxx!

Kaname:
What are they doing?

Goda:
Passing practice, of course.
Isn't it obvious?

Kaname:
Huh? What did you say?
You're not gonna practice tackling?
Well, why the heck not?

Goda:
Because it's dangerous.
I mean, jumping on somebody while they're running and trying to bring them down?

Rugby player:
Yeah, it's just so...
We might scrape ourselves.

Kaname:
If you keep this up, you guys are never gonna get any tougher!

Goda:
Sure, that's easy for you to say, but this is how we've always done practices and stuff.

Kaname:
Yeah, and that's why you're always losing!
Come on, shape up already!
You guys are men, aren't you?

Goda:
Miss Chidori, that remark is just inappropriate.

Rugby player:
Today's society should have sexual equality!
The attitude that dictates men and women should behave in a certain way is a breeding ground for discrimination!
Yeah!

Kaname:
Ooh, these idiots!
Do you have any brains in those heads at all!?
You have exactly one week until the practice match!
If you lose to Garasuyama, your club is no more!
You want that!?

Goda:
No! Of course we don't want that.
But, we don't wanna hurt the other rugby players either.

Kaname:
Look, you don't have to hurt anybody, all you have to do is win the match.
The fate of your club is on the line, so just pull yourselves together, will ya?

Goda:
Yes. Miss Chidori, you're right. I think I can understand where you're coming from.
All right, everyone!
Let's get a scrummage match going!

Rugby player:
Yeah!

Kaname:
Umm, just what are you doing?

Goda:
We have to pray for the safety and success of our scrummage practice.
Otherwise we get so insecure out there.

Kaname:
All right!

Kaname:
Yeah, that's right. Your club's as good as dead.

Goda:
But you know that everybody here's been giving it their all?

Kaname:
I'm sorry but if you're telling me that this is your all, you make even the life of a koala look hectic.

Goda:
They may not look it, but koalas have real bad tempers.

Kaname:
I couldn't care less about that.

Goda:
Ga-Garasuyama High's Rugby Club!

Garasuyama High's student:
I hate to say this, Missy, but you're just wasting your breath trying to lecture to these douchebags.
If they didn't have the loser spirit permanently engrained in them they'd have nothing.

Kaname:
Yeah, seriously, tell me about it.

Garasuyama High's student:
xxx being forced to practice against them all the time made us start to suck. You get me?

Kaname:
All too well.

Garasuyama High's student:
Thankfully, that all be ending next week.
I heard the news. One more loss and your club is gone.
As a special favor we'll put a nice cap on their career and whip them one last time.

Kaname:
Well, gee thanks.

Garasuyama High's student:
Just goes to show you trash'll always be trash.
I like you, Missy.
After this, why don't you come and hang out with us or something?

Kaname:
Don't think so.

Garasuyama High's student:
Come on, don't say that.
We'll show you a good time.

Kaname:
Sorry, but I'm not interested in hanging out with gorillas.

Garasuyama High's student:
Gorilla?
What? You mean me?

Kaname:
I hear they're on the verge of extinction because of this civil war in Rwanda.
And to think you can find them living right here... what a surprise!

Garasuyama High's student:
Why you...!

Garasuyama High's student:
C-Captain!

Sousuke:
Please go somewhere else. We're having a meeting now.

Garasuyama High's student:
You want a piece of me!?

Kaname:
No weapons!

Garasuyama High's student:
Say your prayers!
All right, come here, you pipsqueak!

Kaname:
Hey, you guys, cut it out!
Knock it off!
I'm telling you to knock it off!

Garasuyama High's student:
No one messes with us! See?

Rugby player:
I... I'm against violence...

Garasuyama High's student:
We're looking forward to the big game so don't run off!
Now let's go!
Yeah!

Sousuke:
Are you injured in any way, Kaname?

Kaname:
Nope. Not a scratch.
But those guys have some real nasty tempers.
Everyone, you all right?

Goda:
What a bunch of hooligans...
What did we do to them to deserve such cruelty?
After we had so desperately advocated peace and yet... yet they still gave us a licking...

Kaname:
Geez, at least say, "Those guys beat us up."

Goda:
Miss Chidori, now for the first time I think I truly understand the feeling of frustration...
It can't end this way.
I just want to, no, we just want to win!

Rugby player:
That's right. I'm fed up too!
I wanna win!

Kaname:
Now I'm glad you guys are fired up about it.
But you're still acting like pansies.

Sousuke:
You wanna win that bad?

Goda:
Of course. We're human beings too, you know.

Sousuke:
So you're serious about winning?

Goda:
We are, but at this rate, at this rate...

Sousuke:
Good. Then in that case, I will train you.



Kyoko:
Kaname, is this really the right way to go?

Kaname:
I'm pretty sure it's around here but...

Mikihara:
Are they really training this deep into the mountains?

Kyoko:
What's the point of coming all the way out here?

Kaname:
Tell me about it.
I don't know what they're thinking ditching school for three days...

Sousuke:
You worthless scum! Quit dragging your feet!
Honestly, take a look at yourselves!
You guys are nothing but maggots! You're ticks!
You're the lowest form of life in the universe!
Listen up, you dung beetles!
I take extreme pleasure in watching your faces as you suffer!
Don't you think it's disgraceful panting like old people [censored]?
If you've got the [censored], I dare you to [censored] off right here, right now!
You [censored] and [censored]-ridden ladies!

Kyoko:
Sousuke sure is crude.

Kaname:
My question is does he even know what he's saying?

Rugby player:
I can't go on...

Sousuke:
You again.
Well, I guess that's as far as your determination goes.
So you can't run any more, huh?
In that case, why don't you run back home and go to bed clutching the portrait of Miki Matsuura whoever you love so much.
Now mind you, we're talking about an idol sissies like you fall for.
No doubt she's probably a hopeless tramp.

Rugby player:
Don't-Don't you talk smack about my Miki!

Sousuke:
I'll talk as much smack about her as I want.
Miki Matsuura is a tramp!
If you're gonna tell me otherwise, then show me your guts.
Do ten more laps with the log!

Rugby player:
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!
["Super week day you feel strange!"]

Mikihara:
Well, that got him going again.

Kyoko:
I guess that guy really loves Miki Matsuura, huh.

Sousuke:
None of you had any trouble getting here?

Kaname:
But you've been saying some real crude things to your teammates.

Sousuke:
Oh, it's from this.

Kaname:
"Mao's Pocket Book: How to Abuse a Training Recruit?"
Right, just leave it to her.

Kyoko:
But does it have any effect on them?

Sousuke:
Not to worry.
They will build confidence and drive.
Their weakness runs deeper than a mere lack of skill.

Kaname:
I suppose you're right, but...

Mikihara:
Pardon me for interrupting, but is anyone hungry right now?

Kyoko:
Bet they are.

Mikihara:
We prepared some rice balls for you and all of your teammates.

Kyoko:
We made tons of them.
Bonito, salmon and pickled plum too!

Sousuke:
Hmm...

Kyoko:
What's the matter? Did you already eat lunch?

Sousuke:
No. I'm just wondering whether it would be right to give them any food now.

Kaname:
Look, we woke up early just to make them, so you better not tell us you don't need them.

Sousuke:
Good point.
You be grateful! Your team manager has brought you some food!
It's been thirty-two hours since your last meal.
Those who finish can eat!

Kaname and girls:
Thirty-two hours?!

Sousuke:
Right now, you guys are less than human, you got that?
You're nameless slaves!
Once you've survived my training, then and only then will you become a weapon!
Until that time you lowly maggots are nothing but a bunch of [censored] suckers!
I despise and look down upon you!
Let's make one thing clear!
My job is to find the limp [censored] among you and weed them out!
I won't have any stinking [censored] on our team keeping us from victory!
There will be no laughing or crying!
You're not human beings!
You're killing machines!
If you couldn't kill, your lives will be worthless!
You [censored] would be better off in the corner [censored] your meat!
You wanna lose on purpose just to stand out?
Pretend it hurts to gain some sympathy?
You pathetic loser scum!
The best part of you ran down the crack of your mama's [censored] and ended up as a [censored] stain on the mattress!
Quit dragging your feet, you [censored]!
One wimp and I will unscrew your head and [censored] down your neck!
That ball is your only girlfriend!
You don't need a Mary Jane [censored] with a large backside!
Think of your ball as a wet [censored] and [censored] as hard as you can!

Rugby player:
You're so pretty, Jennifer.
You've got some nice curves, Natalie.
I'm gonna make you sparkle. Does that make you happy, Alice?
I could die for you, Brittany.

Kyoko:
Um, they're talking to their balls.

Kaname:
You know, I've got a really bad feeling about this.

Mikihara:
It seems the Jindai team's going to be late.

Garasuyama High's student:
Are you sure they didn't run out on us?

Kaname:
I don't really think so, but...

Kyoko:
Oh! They're here!

Kaname:
Sousuke!

Sousuke:
Sorry we kept you.

Kaname:
Uh... hey, uh, Goda are you all right?

Goda:
Ma'am! I am perfectly all right! Ma'am!

Kaname:
Ma'am?

Garasuyama High's student:
How nice of you to come and not run away.
You ready for a world of hurt?
Today is the end of your club.
So all of you should be freed up for a nice long hospital stay.
What's wrong?
Wussing out before we even start?
All right, you bunch of rejects, listen up!
We're gonna give you a thorough ass-kicking, so make sure you say your prayers!

Kyoko:
This just keeps getting weirder.

Sousuke:
Listen up! As of this moment, you people are no longer lowly maggots!
You are rugger men! Do you understand!?

Rugby player:
Sir, yes, sir!

Sousuke:
Now you are about to confront the greatest ordeal!
The critical moment where you either win it all or fall to hell!
So, are you having fun!?

Rugby player:
Sir, yes, sir!

Sousuke:
Now prepare for combat!
Now tell me! What's our specialty, ladies?!

Rugby player:
Kill! Kill! Kill!

Sousuke:
And what is our goal in this game?!

Rugby player:
Kill! Kill! Kill!

Sousuke:
Do we love our high school?! Do we love our high school rugby club?!

Rugby player:
Gung ho! Gung ho! Gung ho!

Sousuke:
All right, let's go!

Mikihara:
That's an amazing war cry!

Hayashimizu:
Looks like they're showing some promise.

Kyoko:
This is some kind of weird brainwashing, isn't it?

Kaname:
I wonder if Sousuke actually understands the rules.

Garasuyama High's student:
Rot in hell, Jindai!

Goda:
Sergeant, sir! Punt!

Sousuke:
I'm not sure I follow.

Goda:
It's a kick, sir! A kick!

Sousuke:
Roger that!
All right. Which one of you is next? Step forward.

Umpire:
Penalty!

Garasuyama High's student:
Captain!
Captain!

Rugby player:
The Sergeant showed them a thing or two, didn't he!
All right, ladies, let's go!

Hayashimizu:
You know, in China there is a certain age old saying, "Sha yi jing bai," which means "Execute one enemy in order to warn a hundred."
It appears that Sagara's actions, though unintentional, had a similar effect.

Kaname and Kyoko:
Oh...

Rugby player:
Die!
Big pink skin punks!
Damn it! Still alive.

Kyoko:
I'm scared now...

Kaname:
Whatever this game is, it's not rugby.
And so the fight to retain the Jindai High School Rugby Club drew to an end.
Garasuyama High, a long-time Hanazono attendee, was unable to recover from the shock of this defeat.
From then on, they had a long streak of poor performances.
Afterwards, the legend of this match was passed down as "The Nightmare of Futakotamagawa."
In the realm of high school rugby, Jindai High became synonymous with the word "fear."
But I wonder if things are gonna be better off this way.
A week ago they were saying they didn't wanna hurt anyone.

Sousuke:
Pointless fighting will always be in vain.
Through their actions they taught me this sovereign lesson.

Kaname:
Don't you dare go trying to wrap this up nicely!

Rugby player:
Had enough, you sons of bitches?
Stand up!
We'll whoop your asses again!
Show us what you're made of, you little [censored]!
You dirty [censored] are even nastier than a [censored] underwear.
You want revenge? Well, then, get down and suck our raging [censored]!


（次回予告）

Kaname:
The girl you've all been waiting for finally makes her appearance!
The beautiful Captain Tessa from Sousuke's secret organization is coming to school.
And that would be what they call service for the fans.
Yeah, Sousuke, I hear they've been panting for it.

Sousuke:
That's not what I meant. The stress is killing me.

Kaname:
And with that in mind, tune in next time for "A Goddess Comes to Japan, Part 1: The Suffering."
