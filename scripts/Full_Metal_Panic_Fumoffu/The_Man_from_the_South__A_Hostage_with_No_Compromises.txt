Principal:
 Yes...what is it, vice-principal?
Vice-Principal:
 Please take a look at this!
Principal:
 Hm?
 An estimate for school repair?
 So, four hundred and thirty five thousand yen total for last month?
Vice-Principal:
 Last week!
 And it's all the work of that Sousuke Sagara!

Principal:
 Vice-principal, you are aware of his circumstances, aren't you?
 He's traveled from one foreign hot spot to another since early childhood.
 We can not expect him to adjust to embrace a life of peace in Japanese society.
Vice-Principal:

Principal:
 That is why we, as instructors, must accept our duty to guide young Sagara.
Vice-Principal:
 So, you're overlooking this?
Principal:
 Yes, I am.

Testarossa:
 We can not have any trouble.

Sousuke:
 Don't worry.
 I remove any enemy that gets close to Chidori.
 Even if they're on school grounds.
Testarossa:
 That's...not quite what I meant...!
Sousuke:

 But it's time for school.
 Have a nice day.
 This is Sergeant Sousuke Sagara, ending transmission.

 Kyoko:
 You look sleepy, Kaname?
 Were you up late?
Kaname(Chidori):
 Yeah.
 The Stallone movie that was on last night was so good.
Kyoko:
 Did you watch the whole thing?
Kaname:

Kyoko:
 What's happening!?
 ...Kaname!?
Sousuke:
 All right.
Kaname:
 It's not all right!
 Exactly, why are you blowing things up already?!
 Explain yourself, Sousuke!
Sousuke:
 You see, Miss Chidori.


Kaname:
 Rigged a bomb...?
Sousuke:

Kaname:
 Of course, yeah, I see.
 What kind of weirdo in this peaceful country would rig a bomb in someone's shoe locker?!
Sousuke:
 You're so naive.

 I can not be careless.
Kaname:
 That's no reason to do something like this!
Sousuke:
 Miss Chidori, the most appropriate way to dispose of suspicious materials is detonation...
Kaname:
 No, it's not!
 Each and every day, you just constantly...!

 Mikihara:
 Thirteen wounded, three shoe lockers, forty pairs of slippers, and twenty-nine pairs of shoes destroyed are the total damages...
Hayashimizu:
 Many thanks, Miss Mikihara.
 Now then, would someone please care to make an explanation?
Sousuke:

Hayashimizu:
 I'm listening.
Sousuke:
 Sir!
 Today 08:15, I'd just arrived at school when I noticed something wrong with my shoe locker.
Hayashimizu:
 A suspicious article?
Sousuke:

 Because of the potential threat, I implemented the most reliable means of disposing of it.
Hayashimizu:
 And what means was that?
Sousuke:

Hayashimizu:
 Explosion, you say?
Sousuke:
 Yes.
Hayashimizu:

Sousuke:
 What's wrong, Miss Chidori?
Hayashimizu:
 You certainly are quite the noisy one.
Kaname:
 Upper-class man, Hayashimizu, don't you think it's abnormal?!
 Where on earth would a high school student go and blow up a school shoe locker?!
Hayashimizu:
 Here, apparently.
Kaname:
 Oh, come on...!
Hayashimizu:
 It seems you fail to grasp the severity of this situation.
 Imagine this for instance.
 Let's assume that a package from a stranger has arrived at your house.


 It's that kind of package.
 So, would you still open that package and take a look inside?
Kaname:
 No, I wouldn't.
 I'd toss it.
Hayashimizu:
 You would, wouldn't you?
 And if it were a shoe locker, you'd have no choice but to blow it up.
Kaname:
 Oh, really...
 Is that how it goes?
Hayashimizu:
 Yes, it is.
 And I will explain this to the teaching staff.
 That is all.

(手紙の解読)
Kaname:
 Can you make out anything?
Sousuke:
 Uh.
 Judging from the contents, this is a letter from a hostile third party.
Kaname:
 Are you serious?
Sousuke:
 Well, if you piece it together...
Girl:
 Sousuke Sagara.
 I've always watched you from afar.
 You coward.
 I'll make your heart stop beating, and then you'll rest in peace.
 Wait behind the gymnasium after school.
 I'll kill you.
Sousuke:
 I'm almost certain that's what the letter says.
Kaname:
 Nice, and how did you come up with that?!
 First off, it's a girl's handwriting!
Sousuke:
 A faint to foil handwriting analysis.
 This guy may be a pro.
Kaname:
 That's one creepy pro.
 Anyway, I really think it's a love letter.
Sousuke:
 And what is that?
Kaname:
 Huh? It's a ... Um, it's a...
 There must be some girl after who likes you or something...
 Um... So does that make you happy?
Sousuke:
 I don't follow, but it's not a problem.
Kaname:
 Where are you going?
Sousuke:
 Preemptive strike.
Kaname:
 Wait, class is about to start!
 Hey, Sousuke?! Um... Ha...

(隠れて様子を伺うかなめと恭子)


Kaname:
 Looks like no one's here yet.
Kyoko:
 Tell me, Kaname.
 Why are you here checking up on Sousuke anyway?
Kaname:


 ...What's that supposed to mean, Kyoko?!
 Why are you following me?!

 Kyoko:
 Because it looked like it might be fun!
Kaname:

 ...There she is...!
Kyoko:
 That's Miss Ena Saeki from class one.

Kaname:
 Oh...really...!
 She does have a face that any man would fall for...

 No, I hear she's good at school too!
 I think on the end of the year tests, she was ranked fifth!

 So you let go of her!

 Don't get mad.
 We were just joking around, babe. That's all.

 Yes.
Kaname:
 For Miss Saeki?
Sousuke:
 Correct.
Kaname:
 You mean...you were hiding there under all that grass the whole time between lunch and now...?!

Sousuke:
 Affirmative.
 My camouflage was perfect.
 Had a girl made one suspicious move, I would have knocked her out.
Kaname:
 You could've saved us earlier?!
Sousuke:


 Kaname:
 You are stupid!
 In fact you are4imbecile!
Miss Saeki:

Sousuke:
 Yes, I am Sousuke Sagara.
Miss Saeki:
 But...why all this...this...
 But Sousuke, my love letter, you did read it, didn't you?
Sousuke:
 Oh that?
 I detonated it.
Miss Saeki:
 Y...You detonated my letter...
Sousuke:
 It appears you aren't an enemy, but just...what was your purpose here?
Miss Saeki:
 What...was my purpose...?

 Oh, man!
 Now we can't go back to that arcade!
Kyoko:
 I have to say that was incredibly uncool.
Sousuke:
 Why?
Kaname:
 Who in the hell would shoot a real gun into a video game screen?!
Sousuke:
 I ran out of ammo.
Kyoko:
 I told you, to reload all you have to do is point the gun outside the screen and pull the trigger!
Sousuke:
 That's not safe.
 What if the gun should go off?

 So, you use a real one?!

 Miss Akutsu, the guy's got a gun!
 Come on, there ain't no way we can win against him!
Akutsu:
 Yeah right.
 It's probably nothing but a toy.

Bad Boys:
Huh?! What are you talking about, huh?! It's a REAL gun!
 It's Austrian made, the Steyr S.P.P., nine millimeter caliber,
 hosts thirty rounds, fires nine hundred rounds per minute!
 It's a machine pistol developed for security.
 Its reinforced polymer frame is extremely light.
 Plus, it has superior control in full-auto mode so you could... wow!

 You wanted to see me, Your Excellency?
Hayashimizu:
 What happened to Miss Chidori?
Sousuke:
 She's been absent since this morning, sir.
Hayashimizu:
 Oh, is that so?

 which I wanted to discuss. Huh?

Hayashimizu:
 Now, now, wait a minute.
 Sagara, it sounds as if our visitor harbors some hostility toward you.
 He is holding a substantial grudge for what you did to his friends yesterday
 and says he wants to exact his revenge upon you.
Sousuke:
 I see. Then please convey this to him, if you would.
 My military might exceeds yours by an overwhelming margin.
 So attempts of revenge would be a mere waste of efforts.
Hayashimizu:
 Hm. Now listen, you punk.
 There's no way you'd beat me. So step off.
 'Cause you ain't even got one chance in a billion, you loser-biatch.
Sousuke:
 You language skills are outstanding, Your Excellency!
Hayashimizu:
 Oh, it's nothing.
 Only what I've gleaned from books.
 I'm not certain he'll understand my translation though.

 Grrrr... What did you say?!

 Wait, man. All I got is a message for you.

 You don't come, who knows what will happen to her.
 Come to the abandoned factory in Sengawa at five. Alone.
Sousuke:
 So you're holding Miss Chidori hostage?
Punk:
 Heh! So there you go. What d'you think?
 Dunn't matter how many guns you [pack in] 'cause you... you can't...
 Ugh, what's that for?
Hayashimizu:
 You made a foolish mistake.

 Yes, your younger brother.
 I kidnapped him from the schoolyard and hung him up there when you weren't looking.
 It seems he is the only person you open up to.

 I have my sources.
 I believe he should be waking up fairly soon.

 Don't worry.

 However.

 Will you kill her? Very well.

 Chidori, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you must share the same fate as the boy.
 No deal with terrorists, that's the international standard.
Kaname:
 What are you talking about?!
Sousuke:
 Don't worry. I'll write your next of kin.
Kaname:
 You'll do what?!
Sousuke:

 You can save both of them, or you can kill both of them.
Akutsu:
 If I give in, it'll set a bad example for the boys...
 But if I don't, Yoshiki... Yoshiki will...

 Everyone has something important to him.
 For instance like you. Yes, you. Your name is Seiji Takayama.
 An eleventh grader at Garasuyama High.
 You adore your little sister who is in middle school.
 The sister who takes Benten Street home everyday at six PM.
 That's a fairly deserted street.
 I'd be worried that someone BAD might go after her...
Takayama:
 AHHhhh!
Sousuke:
 And then there's you. Yuuta Date.
Date:
 AHHhhh!
Sousuke:
 You own a love bird.
Date:
 Huh...!
Sousuke:
 You begged your parents to buy you one when you were eleven.
 They say lovebirds die easily.
 Simply spraying insecticide into the room through a window crack will send him into a fatal writhing convulsions of pain...
Date:
 Stop it! Please, no more!
Sousuke:
 There's no need for you to be frightened, Mr. Date.
 I was only talking about your parakeet.
 You are Koichi Igarashi.
Igarashi:

 You have a bike that you worked hard to buy.
 And let's see... You are Keiji Endo.

 Ah... Thanks... But...
Sousuke:
 Yes, I know what you're about to say.
 "You should have killed them all the minute you saw them..."
Kaname:
 That's not it!
 I can't believe you did that to an innocent child!
Sousuke:
 All right that.
Kaname & Akutsu:
 Huh?!
Yoshiki:
 That was good, right?
Sousuke:
 It was. You performed it very well.
Yoshiki:
 A-HA-HA, but it was pretty scary.
 Hey, don't forget your promise, OK?
Sousuke:

Akutsu:
 Grrr... You mean you tricked me?!
Yoshiki:
 A-HA-HA-HA.
Sousuke:
 His Excellency offered me his full support.
 He told me not to hold back and match the enemy's methods, stripe or strife.
 After all, peaceful solutions are the best ones, right?
Kaname:
 That was peaceful?
 What do you want to eat?

 Curry rice sounds good.

 Then he pulled a gun on teacher, "It's an emergency."
