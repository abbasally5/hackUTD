Voice:
Hello. You have reached Brilliant Safetech.
We're sorry, but no one is currently here to take your call.
Please leave your message after the beep.
And may the fortunes of war smile upon you.

Sousuke:
BÃ©art. It's Sagara.
The package arrived, but you sent me the wrong item.
I ordered a special gun sight.
The only thing I got was a strange bottle.
I glanced over the manual, and it looks extremely dangerous.
How could you even think of shipping something like that through air mail?
Are you insane?
Call me as soon as you can.

Kaname:
Who did you call?

Sousuke:
An old friend of mine, weapons dealer.
He can get you almost anything, for the right price.
Well, I ordered a special part for my gun, but it seems there was some kind of mixup.

Kaname:
Looks like one solid water bottle.

Sousuke:
Of course. It's designed not to break easily.

Kagurazaka:
Sousuke Sousuke from class 2-4!
I have something to ask you about the club room that's under construction!
Come to the faculty room now!

Kyoko:
So, what did you do this time, Sousuke?

Sousuke:
Ah, nothing really comes to mind.

Kaname:
You sure?

Sousuke:
Well yesterday, I saw some "Do Not Enter" tape around the construction area.
So out of the kindness of my heart, I set up a high-voltage trap.
That's all. You don't think she's mad about that...

Kaname:
Of course she's mad.

Sousuke:
Ow Ow Ow OW OW.

Kaname:
Some construction worker probably fell into your stupid trap.
Come on.

Sousuke:
Nobody should touch that bottle.

Kyoko:
Well, in any case she's a good baby-sitter.

Kazama:
Sure is rough, though.

Ono-D:
Yes! I got one!

Mizuki:
Got what, Ono-D?

Ono-D:
This is a "Flaming Hot God of Curry Bread!"
It's always been sold out.

Kyoko:
That's the new kind, right?

Mizuki:
I heard it's really spicy.

Ono-D:
I thought I'd try it out.
Well, here I go!
That's hot!!

Mizuki:
Gee. What a surprise.

Ono-D:
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!
Water!

Ren:
I'm sorry, that's empty.

Ono-D:
Water!

Mizuki:
Empty.

Ono-D:
Water!

Kazama:
Ono-D! No! That's Sousuke's bottle!

Kyoko:
Here, have this.

Ono-D:
Thank you, Kyoko. That was too hot!
Man, what was that baker thinking?!

Mizuki:
But, the name said it was hot, right?
Of course it's gonna be spicy!

Kazama:
Uh, um, guys? I think you should take a look at this.

Kyoko:
You're such a scatterbrain.

Kazama:
You know, I think this is really, really dangerous.

Mizuki:
Well, try it again tomorrow.

Ono-D:
No way! Forget it! I've had enough super-hot stuff for the year!

Kazama:
No! Wait! I know this stuff is really dangerous!

Mizuki:
Yeah, that's probably right.

Kazama:
Hey, hey, you guys? Are you listening? Hello? This is really important!



Kagurazaka:
Honestly. You will apologize to that worker later on! You hear me?

Sousuke:
Understood.

Mizuki:
Huh? Lunch break's over?

Ren:
That was fast.

Mizuki:
Bye, Kyoko!

Kyoko:
Okay, later!

Sousuke:
Hold it!
Someone, please tell me what happened to the contents of this bottle?!
Give me a straight answer!
I promise I won't get angry or make you pay me back for it.
Just tell me who's responsible!

Ono-D:
Sorry, Sagara. I thought it was a water bottle.

Sousuke:
And the contents?

Ren:
I cleaned it up and threw it in the trash.

Kagurazaka:
Sagara, class is already starting...

Sousuke:
Listen, everyone!
From now on you're forbidden to leave this classroom!
That means you too! So, don't move!

Mizuki:
Huh? What do you mean?

Ren:
We need to get back to our class, Sagara.

Sousuke:
Doesn't matter!
Whatever the circumstances, whoever enters this room from this point...

Tsubaki:
Sagara!
I sent a letter challenging you to a fight on the roof today during lunch!
Where were guhgwah gwhu?!

Sousuke:
This is an emergency.

Mizuki:
What's that? Now we can't get out!

Kagurazaka:
That's quite enough, Sagara! Just what are you... doing?

Kaname:
What's with that outfit?

Sousuke:
It's an NBC Protective Suit.

Kaname:
NB what?

Sousuke:
Wait, first thing's first.

Kagurazaka:
Now what are you doing? S-Sagara?

Sousuke:
I will (now) explain.
Ladies and gentlemen!
I must ask that 5th period be suspended immediately.

Kagurazaka:
What did you say?

Sousuke:
A serious disaster has occurred here.
This bottle contained a bacteriological weapon.
And releasing it from its special capsule has created a biohazard.

Kagurazaka:
Biohazard?

Sousuke:
Affirmative.
An extremely dangerous bacteria created with the latest biotech has spilled out.
It's insatiable, ferocious, airborne and once it infects someone, it will not stop until it devours its entire prey.
That's what the manual said.

Kagurazaka:
So is it right here, in this room?

Sousuke:
Yes.

Kagurazaka:
Are we infected? Am I? And what about my students?

Sousuke:
I'm afraid so.
Calm down! She just fainted!

Kaname:
But how can we calm down?!

Tsubaki:
Infected? What do you mean?

Sousuke:
Don't panic!
Running around and shouting won't help anything!

Mizuki:
Don't be so selfish! Once you're infected, you die, right?
But you've got the fancy suit, it's easy for you to say don't panic!

Sousuke:
But I'm the only one here who knows anything about bacteriological weapons.
To come up with an effective strategy...

Mizuki:
I get it.
You're just trying to save yourself, Sagara!

Student:
You've got some nerve! What the hell's wrong with you?
What do you think you're doing to us, huh?

Sousuke:
Fine.
Now do you all understand?
I'm not giving you instructions simply to save my own life here.
As an expert in war, I'm only trying to prevent the situation from getting worse.
Everyone, please forget your hatred.
And don't hold any grudges. That way, we can think about our next step.
This tragedy isn't anyone's fault.

Kaname:
Sousuke...

Sousuke:
You all understand that, right?

Kaname:
Honestly! Guns and bombs, fine.
But, biological weapons?

Tsubaki:
What kind of dangerous stuff are you packing, you bastard?

Kyoko:
Hey, guns and bombs are dangerous too, you know.

Mizuki:
What was in there?
Just knowing it's a biological weapon won't help us.

Kaname:
Does anybody feel sick?
Maybe we ought to go to the school's nurse.

Kazama:
I don't think that's a good idea.

Kaname:
Why is that?

Kazama:
Sousuke gave us strict instructions not to leave the class room because he didn't want the infection to spread any further.
He said it was transmitted through the air.
If we were to leave the room, the entire school would turn into one big infectious hot spot!

Ono-D:
But Shinji, nobody here feels sick!

Kazama:
One of the features of these weapons is that after someone's infected it takes some time before the symptoms to appear.
But they're very deadly nonetheless.
Sometimes they're even referred to as "the poor man's nuclear bomb."
I've heard that some country in the Middle East is studying the Ebola virus for military use.
That could even be what this is.

Kaname:
Ebola?
You mean the one where you bleed all over your body and die?

Kazama:
Right. Known as the "flesh eating virus."
If that's what this is, then none of us will get out of here alive!

Tsubaki:
What? No way!

Student:
I don't wanna die!
Mommy!

Kaname:
Hold it guys! Stop it! Calm down!
We can't leave the room! Didn't you hear?
Dammit! I told you people! Calm down now!
One more time! Stop acting like this!
You'll just create more victims!

Student:
But, what about us?

Kaname:
Look, everyone. Think about how history is gonna judge this tragedy!
If we lose ourselves in a panic and spread the infection throughout the entire school, rest assured, people will despise us for all eternity!
Is that what you want?
Hey, I'm scared too, you know.
Before I have to die, I would've liked to at least go to Ohio and eat all the Trident-yaki I could.
Or go to the soba shop by the station one last time and gorge myself on super-deluxe soba piled high with all the toppings I could want.
Then I could die without regrets.
That is how I feel.

Kazama:
It doesn't cost much to please you.

Kaname:
However! We can't let it get to us!
Even with death staring us in the face, we must confront it with reason!
We should bravely offer our lives on the sacrificial altar of fate and pray for our countrymen's safety.
Isn't the brilliance of such a noble spirit what humanity is all about?

Student:
It's just like you said, Chidori.
She's right. Let's stop behaving so shamefully.
It won't be easy, but we should just face our destiny.

Kaname:
Thank you, everyone. I am truly proud of each one of you!
I'm sorry for being so harsh with you!

Student:
What are you talking about, Kaname? We're the ones who were wrong!
It'll be okay. We're all friends here, aren't we?
We won't be dying alone. So there's no reason to be afraid.
Thank you.

Sousuke:
What are you people crying for?

Kaname:
Quiet, you. We're all busy reflecting on the human conscience right now.
You just stay over there and die.

Ren:
That's right, Sagara. You mustn't bother them now.

Sousuke:
Not an option. I haven't informed them of the vaccine yet.

Kaname:
Vaccine?

Sousuke:
The vaccine for the weapon. It was included for emergencies.
See, it's right here. But there's only one dose.
What's the matter?

Kaname:
Oh, Sousuke. Oh, Sousuke.
You're a genius at making things more complicated, you know that?
We'll draw for it! No hard feelings!


Student:
We're all gonna die... All of us...
Hi, mom, it's me. Yeah, well, I, just wanted to say goodbye...

Kaname:
Kyoko...

Kyoko:
It's hard but it's okay. I had fun going to school with you.

Kaname:
It's so cruel. How could this happen? How could this have happened?
Who's next? Mizuki?

Mizuki:
Yeah. Me.
No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

Kaname:
Mizuki.

Mizuki:
I don't wanna die before I meet some wonderful guy!
There must be some mistake! I demand a re-draw! You know what? I'll bet...

Tsubaki:
Stop embarrassing yourself!
Now, look. It's not like I don't understand how you feel.
But you're making a total ass of yourself, and that puts a stain on the life you've lived so far!
Why can't you see that?!
If this is to be your destiny, accept it, and decide how to use the rest of your life.

Kaname:
That was beautiful, Issei.
It's your turn now.

Tsubaki:
I have no regrets in my heart.
So even if I did draw the winner...
You take this, Chidori.

Kaname:
Issei. No, I couldn't.

Tsubaki:
You will live along with my love!

Kaname:
Too bad. Okay. Next!

Mizuki:
Hey, your name is Issei, right?
I just got so choked up when you yelled at me!

Tsubaki:
Now, look, woman!

Mizuki:
You seem like a nice guy, and we're gonna die anyway, so why not, you know, be with me till then? Huh? Huh?

Tsubaki:
Hey, stop it! Stop hugging me!

Kaname:
All right. So, how about you, Ren?

Ren:
Oh, whatever. I don't mind drawing last.

Kaname:
Hey, Sousuke? You need to draw a paper too.

Sousuke:
Yes. Then I guess I'll draw.
Oh, it's the winner.

Kaname:
Winner?

Sousuke:
Yeah, I guess I win.
Well, that's the way it is. Sorry.

Tsubaki:
Of all the people. Why you?

Student:
No way. There is no way that I'm just going to accept something like this.
Normally I can handle pretty tough situations, but this is too much.
This universe is so absurd, I'm going to die from insanity before the bacteria kills me.

Sousuke:
I understand. But I promise you I will never forget this tragedy.
I will send the data directly to the weapon's maker.
And warn them strongly to prevent such occurrences from happening in the future.
That's why...

Student:
Why? Why, what?!

Sousuke:
You should all accept your fate calmly.

Student:
We're gonna kill you!

Sousuke:
Wait! Everybody calm down!
Violence won't solve anything!
Let's talk this over!

Student:
That's what you say, but you're still fighting back!

Kaname:
Everyone, stop! Stop this ugly fighting!
We can just re-do the drawing!
Please! Don't get me any more grief...
Oh, who cares!

Tsubaki:
Sagara, die!

Fujisaki:
Quiet down!
What is going on in here?
This isn't some disorderly elementary school!
Why can't you take your education more seriously?! Huh?

Student:
Oh no, he opened it. Even though it spreads through the air.
Yes. How dare he.
Oh, you've done it now, Fujisaki!

Fujisaki:
Done what?!

Student:
Who cares how far that stupid thing spreads down?!

Kazama:
I need to get rid of my naughty pictures before I die.

Ono-D:
Man, I gotta go to the bathroom.

Kyoko:
Yeah, so do I.

Kaname:
What'll we do now?! Everyone left! The bacteria, Sousuke! The bacteria!

Sousuke:
I know.

Kaname:
Just what kind of life did I have, for it comes to an end in this way?
But then again, when I'm dying I won't have to deal with the clean up after all the messes you caused ever again.
If I look at it that way [with that/then] maybe I can be happy!

Tsubaki:
Well, I'm not happy!
There still happens to be one certain matter I have to settle once and for all before I die.
Confessing to the woman I love or telling my family goodbye is my least concern!
The only thing I have to do right now is...
Knock it off, woman!

Mizuki:
Lighten up! I've decided to live for love till the end!

Tsubaki:
Anyway! What I want to say is I can't go off and die until I settle my score with you!

Sousuke:
Really?

Tsubaki:
That's right so say your prayers!
Oh life, burst into flames!
Show what you mean your final fiery glimmer!
Now! I put all my strength into this!
Daidomyaku-style Final Technique! Rin!

Sousuke:
I won.

Kaname:
Wow. I have no strength left to yell at you for that.
Ren, where are you going?

Ren:
You see, I understand how grave the situation is now.
Whenever time I have left, I prefer to spend it with the one I love.
But it's just not to be...
So now that things have come to this, I think I will enjoy a final cup of tea alone.

Kaname:
I'm sorry.

Ren:
Everyone, thank you for everything. Well then, take care.

Kaname:
Uh-huh, see ya.

Sousuke:
Kaname. Come with me, immediately.

Kaname:
Wh-, wait.

Sousuke:
There's no time.

Kaname:
Sousuke, where are we going?

Sousuke:
I said there's no time. Don't worry. Just come.

Kaname:
The Nurse's Office. But why...?
Hey, wait, what are you doing, Sousuke?

Sousuke:
All right. Get undressed.

Kaname:
Huh?

Sousuke:
Strip down.

Kaname:
What are you saying? You don't... mean that.
What? Because we're going to die?
But, it's all so sudden. I'm not even prepared.
And to do it in a creepy place like this?
I can't. I just can't!

Sousuke:
It's all right. You don't have to say anything.

Ren:
Now, I can die and not have any regrets.

Hayashimizu:
Mikihara, what's going on?

Ren:
But, senior. Why are... why are you here?

Hayashimizu:
I finished my work in study hall, so I came to tidy up some business I had here.

Ren:
You mustn't be here. Please you must leave me. If you don't, then I...

Hayashimizu:
I can't leave you. Steady yourself.

Ren:
Oh, senior...

Kyoko:
I feel so hot. I wonder if this is the end.

Ono-D:
Oh, hey there, Kyoko.

Kyoko:
Ono-D! Hang in there.

Ono-D:
Hang in there... That's a pretty tall order right now.
My head's starting to get all crowded and fuzzy, and I can't move a single muscle in my body.

Kyoko:
Oh, no.

Ono-D:
But you know what, Kyoko? I finally realized how beautiful the world is.

Kyoko:
Ono-D... Ono-D?!

Ono-D:
I guess it's finally come to the end.
Looks like I'll be the first to go.

Kyoko:
No! Don't you die on me!

Ono-D:
You know, Kyoko, this is the first time I've seen you cry.

Kyoko:
No, please! Just hang on!

Ono-D:
This is the end... There's something I want to say.
I just... want to tell you... to tell you that... to tell you th...

Kyoko:
You wanted to tell me what now?

Ono-D:
On, nothing. I feel really good.
It's weird, my shoulders and hips feel fine now.

Kyoko:
What's going on?

Ono-D:
I don't know. Huh! Kyoko!

Kyoko:
No!

BÃ©art:
Listen, Sagara, that's not a deadly virus!

Sousuke:
Explain.

BÃ©art:
You know worthy attention on bacteria that can break down petroleum products?
Well, our researcher was trying to put them to military use but he ended up creating an odd strain.

Sousuke:
And the result is this weapon?

BÃ©art:
That's right! It's called the "Full Monty Bacteria."
Around 36 degrees Celsius, in other words, at human body temperature, it multiplies at an incredible rate, and becomes active!
When it does, it completely devours certain petroleum products, specifically polyester and nylon.
That's what makes it such a ferocious bacteria!

Sousuke:
Are there counter-measures?

BÃ©art:
No. None. Just a vaccine.
It dies after about two hours, but until then wear nothing but natural fibers.

Hayashimizu:
Here. Put this on. It's made of wool.

BÃ©art:
Everyone around you will become a victim.

Ren:
Oh, senior.

BÃ©art:
Badly as a side effect, it relieves stiff shoulders and hips.

Sousuke:
We'll have to settle this later.

Kaname:
Well? What's the word? What's going on here?

Sousuke:
At the very least, it means this wasn't the strain of deadly bacteria.

Kaname:
You don't say.

Sousuke:
But, whatever the case may be...
I doubt that I'll live for much longer...

Student:
I heard Sagara's behind this whole thing!
It's Sagara's fault?
Let's get him!
That lousy son of a...!
Looks like he got away!
Find him!
Get out here, you bastard!

Sousuke:
Hey, Luci, good job. That was fun, huh?

Kaname:
Um, yeah, but you're not done yet. You still have another line, Chris Patton.

Sousuke:
Oh, wait. There's still more?

Kaname:
Hello? Turn the page, goof-off.

Sousuke:
This is uruz 7! HQ, I'm surrounded by ferocious locals.
Need immediate evacuation! Repeat! Immediate evacuation!

Student:
There he is!
Rip him to shreds!
