  Move! I'm gonna frickin' kill you, son of a bitch!

People are eating people.
This isn't even funny.

Can't be... This can't be happening.
Can it, Mommy?
It's not, right?!

Takagi, where do you think you're running to?

And what exactly was your brilliant plan?

I was going to talk to the teachers in the faculty room, and then go to...

That's so pointless!
What do you think a bunch of stupid teachers can do about it?

But, Takagi...
This is just... It's kinda...
Because of this I... I should...

I've got a question for you.

What is it?

Do you want to die or do you wanna live?

Well, that's... um...

They had the same idea as you.
Let's see how it works for them.

Sir!

Sir!

You wanna live, right? Then stick with me!

Uh-huh!

Let's go, chubby!


<Opening>


ACT2
Escape from the DEAD


Come on, do it for me.
I want to stay myself until the end.

He's not turning!
He's not turning into one of Them!
Don't do it!

What's the matter?

I was thinking what the hell is really going on.

That's a straightforward answer.

What's the point of lying about it?

I think I should let my dad know that I'm all right.
Let me use your cell.

I understand that he's a police officer,
but we can't even connect to 110.

I know this secret number that he told me not to call unless it's emergency.
It got through!
Dad?!

Hello?
Takashi? Is that you?

Dad, listen! Daddy, we're at school and there's been...

Hello, Takashi?
You must have got this number from Rei.
Is Rei okay?!
Is she with you?
Are you both all right?

Daddy, what's the matter?! Can you hear me?!

Listen carefully.
The entire city is (in panic mode right now.)

Daddy!

You need to get out of there!
You understand?!
The city is already in panic mode!
You need to evac--

No service?!
But I just called him!
I don't understand...

Rei!

Takashi...
My dad...
He didn't know that it was me at all.
He didn't even know me!


Takagi, I..I know it's against school rules,
but don't you have your cell phone on you?

I'm a straight-A student!
Besides, even if I had one, who would I call?

Well, the police, maybe?

God, you're so stupid.
Look how serious this is.
There's no way people haven't called them already,
but yet we haven't heard a single siren.
So, now you know.

So this is... happening all over?

Gee, ya think?
I'm sure the police have been dealing with this already,
but look at how things are.

I wonder if we should call the Self-Defense Force or something?

I wouldn't expect much from them.

I know that they can't conduct any defense or public security operations
without the government's order, but...

That's not what I meant!

Well, what did you mean exactly?

They're just like the police.
What do you think will happen if people are eating people in all the cities out there?
Listen:
There are 130 million people.
How many of them do you think work for the Self-Defense Force?
And what if the same thing has been happening inside the Self-Defense Force?
Come on! We need to go!

Okay!

Jesus, the only reason I have to stay with this dumbass is because Komuro isn't here.
I'm such a nice person.


O...Okada...
Okada?
Damn it!
Forgive me! Forgive me!
Forgive me!
Forgive me! Forgive me! Forgive me!

What should I do?

Forgive me! Forgive me! Forgive me!

I can't get hold of the police or the fire department.
I can treat them, but once they're bitten, they're bound to die.
And once they die, they'll resurrect.
This is exactly like that George Romero movie I once saw.

I don't think it's time to be impressed!
Let's get out of here, Miss Shizuka!

Hold on a second.
Let me take all the stuff I can carry.

Just do it quickly.
Miss Shizuka!
M..Miss Shizuka, get out of here, quick!

Hey, I'm sorry. What was your name again, please?

What?

O..Oh goodness...
Huh?

I'm the captain of the kendo club, Saeko Busujima, a sophomore.
What's your name, kid?

Ishi..Ishii Kazu...

Ishii, you did a great job protecting Dr. Marikawa.
I commend your courage.
You do know what happens to you once you get bitten.
Do you want your parents or friends to see you like that?
If the answer is no,
I will end your life as painlessly as I can.
But I've never killed anyone before.

P..Please do that.

W..Wait, what are gonna do?

You're the school doctor, I got it. But stay out of it.
This young man is going to die with honor.
And I'm going to make sure that he does.


Okay, we're here, but what do we do now?
Although, I do see some things that would come in handy.

Just shut up, you chubby-geek.
Lock the door so they won't come in.

I..I locked it.
Are you going to use them as weapons?

You're one of those basement shut-ins,
one of those military nerds or gun geeks, aren't you?
Come on, at least you've seen those things before.
I mean, it was in that Mel Gibson movie.

A nail gun...
And it's gas.

Hell yeah!
We won't be able to carry it around
if it was one of those compressor types, right?
God, you're fat and stupid.

So, you like movies?

Don't be ridiculous!
I'm a genius, so I know everything.

We got an extra tank, and the nails...
We're all set.

Why are you being so calm, cool and collected?
They're coming!
They're in the hallway!

Weighs around four kilograms.
It's as heavy as some old assault rifle.
But I can't stabilize my aim this way.
I need to attach a sight to it.

Hey, you, are you listening to me?!
Hi..Hirano?
Hirano!

Gotcha!

Hirano?


Are you ready?

Yeah!

Now turn it!

Shit!


You see the drill and the nails over there?
Will you put them in a bag or something?

Excuse me?
You're nobody to me. What makes you think you can order me around?

Pretty please with sugar on top?

All right...


Takashi!

I..I'm okay.
I didn't like most of you fucks then,
and I sure as hell don't like you now!
TAKE THIS!


Hey, what are you doing?
You hold this too.

Um, okay...
Hey, Takagi, can I..can I ask you something?

What?

Well, why are you with me?

Why? Because I'm such a nice person.

Yeah, I can see that. Oh, well.

Hey, you're on the ball all of a sudden.
Something clicking you or what?

I think I found my calling!

Behind you!


HIGH SCHOOL OF THE DEAD


The fire hose. Not too shabby.

I figured the water pressure would be strong enough.
Don't you remember?
During the fire drill when we were in junior high, Hisashi and you got...

Yeah... I remember.

I think it should be okay now.

How I admire your optimism.
You sure about this?
Let's go!


Where do we run to?

To my house.
Go there and get supplies we need and meet up with other people who haven't turned yet.
Work together and get someplace safe.
Sounds like a plan to me.

Y..Yeah, you're right!
Now that I know my dad's okay...
Oh, we should probably call your house and make sure they're all right too.

Waste of time; nobody's home.
My dad won't be back in town till next week,
and my mom's a school teacher so she won't be home until after 5.
Besides, they get on my nerves.

Well, they're parents. That kinda comes with the job.


I didn't really mean that.
The truth is I was a little scared.
Look at this place.
And my mom...
She's someplace just like this.


Wh..What are you doing?

Just be quiet.
Do you see that?
They don't even react when something hits their bodies.
The big dumbasses. Their senses are dead.
They only respond to the sound.
Most likely they can't see either.
Otherwise, they wouldn't bump into the locker.

Wh..What about heat?

I'm sure we'll get plenty of opportunities to find out.
Let's go.

So, we're..we're going outside?

You think we're hanging around here?

I kinda... I hate walking.

And that's why you're so fat!
You need to put down the Walmart Cheetos and exercise!

What?


Faculty room?
Jesus. What a pain in the ass.

But all the car keys are in that room. That's where they keep them.
Why don't you just kill them?
You've done so well this far, why stop now?

One or two at a time, believe me, no problem.
And I wouldn't think twice about doing it.
But they come at you in packs.
And don't be fooled, they're a lot stronger than they look.
Once they grab you, it's hard to get loose.

Wow, I'm impressed.
Oh! I hate these stupid floor mats. Jeez!

What you're wearing isn't exactly made for running.

Wha...?!
Are you crazy?! This is Christian Dior!

Your clothes or your life?
Which one is more important?

Both are!
What was that?

It came from the faculty room.


If you keep shooting them, how will we learn about 'em?

You know, you could help me fight them too!

You stupid fat idiot, that's what I have you for!

The magazine is almost empty!

YOU THINK THAT'S MY PROBLEM!?
HURRY UP AND JUST RELOAD IT!

But they're... they're right behind you. See?

Hi..Hirano!

Oh no, I'm out!

Get away... Get away!

Takagi!

Get back! Stay back!
GET AWAY!
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!
SOMEONE, PLEASE!

I'll take the right side.

Rei!

I'll hold the left.

Oh?

Taka...

Takagi, are you okay?

Miyamoto...

You already know the school doctor, Marikawa, right?
And I'm Saeko Busujima from Class 3-A.

I'm Takashi Komuro from Class 2-B.

Miss Busujima, I remember you won the national championship last year.
I'm Rei Miyamoto, I'm in the spear martial arts club.

Oh, I'm..I'm Kota Hirano from Class B, just FYI.

Nice to meet you.

Why are you guys being all warm and fuzzy?

What?

Why are you being so polite to her, Miyamoto?
You flunked last year, you're the same age.
She's not your elder!

What are you talking about, Takagi?

DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE I'M STUPID!
I'M SMARTER THAN ALL OF YOU COMBINED!
YOU SHOULD BE LUCKY I'M EVEN IN THE SAME SCHOOL AS YOU!
I'm a... I'm a...

It's okay, that's enough.

Look at me... All these blood stains...
Now Mom will have to take it to the cleaners...


ACT2
Escape from the DEAD


<Closing>


What do you think?

Yeah.

I think that's enough for right now.
Let's take a quick break.

Hey, just wondering. Are you okay?

Huh?

You wear glasses?

Shut up!
My contact lenses keep on moving around!

She wears glasses...


Here you go.

Oh, thanks.
Dr. Marikawa, where's the car key?

Oh, it's in my purse somewhere...

Are you sure your car is big enough to fit all of us?

Well, now that I think about it...

What about the microbus we use for the clubs' away games?
Looks like the keys are on the wall hook.

Hey guys, I see the bus.

That's fine, but where are we going?

We're going to make sure that our families are okay.
We'll start with the family who lives closest from here.
If you're worried about your family, we'll bring them with us.
After that, we'll look for a safe place and...

What's wrong?

What is this?

What's wrong, Rei?

The government has begun to consider the emergency measures
against the outbreaks that have been occurring in locations around the city.
However, all the political (parties have been expressing their uncertainty about the Self-...)

Outbreaks? What do they mean "outbreaks"?

It's been feared that more than 10,000 have been victimized in the Saitama area so far.
The governor has already called for the...
already declared a state of emergency...
and requested the emergency disaster relief.
It's a gunshot!
It looks like the police are finally using firearms!
From what I can see there...
No! No!
