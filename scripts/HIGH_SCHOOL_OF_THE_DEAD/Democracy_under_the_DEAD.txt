  The government has begun to discuss the emergency measures.
However, the mobilization of the Self-Defense Forces has been the subject of...

...than 10,000 have been victimized in the Saitama area so far.
The governor has already called...
already declared a state of emergency...
and requested the emergency disaster relief.
It's a gunshot!
It looks like the police are finally using firearms!
From what I can see there...
No!

Uh... There appears to be a problem with our remote.
F..From now on, we'll bring you the story from inside the studio.
The condition outside seems extremely chaotic,
so stay home unless it's absolutely necessary to go outside.
We'll bring you more stories
as soon as it's safe to cover the current situation from the site.

Is that all?
Why didn't they tell anything else?

They're afraid of causing a panic.

A panic?

Yeah, you idiot!
First panic then chaos.
And chaos causes a disruption of order.
And then, when order is disrupted,
well, you should just hand it all over to the walking dead corpses!

This unusual and unprecedented biological phenomenon that's spread throughout North America
has yet to be put under control.
Government authorities have evacuated the White House,
and will relocate to a command center on board the aircraft carrier George Washington.
There are reports that the transfer of power
is in preparation for the use of tactical warheads to combat the infestation.
We have currently lost contact with Moscow.
Beijing has been set ablaze.
London has maintained order.
While in Paris and Rome, there are reports of looting.
The government officials have declared a state of martial law.
Currently...

Democracy under the DEAD


So they're everywhere.
That's crazy...

Everything was normal when I checked the internet this morning.

I can't believe this.
This happened all over the world in the matter of a few hours.
But they'll stop it, right?
I mean, they have to stop it from spreading.
I mean, everything is going to back to normal soon.

That's not going to happen.

Why do you have to be so blunt about it?

This is a pandemic.
There's nothing we can do!

A pandemic...

It's the outbreak of an infectious disease.
The entire world is experiencing the same outbreak.

So what? It's some kind of epidemic?

This is exactly like the Spanish flu in 1918.
More than 600 million people got infected
and 50 million people died from it.
Remember how much a panic Swine Flu caused? Well, square that.

Not to be disagreeable, but I think this is more like the Black Death from the 14th century.

One third of the European population died. You're smarter than you look.

So how the outbreak finally ended?

Well, there are many theories.
It usually stops when too many humans die.
There wouldn't be enough people to spread the disease.

But now...
All the dead people still move and start attacking you.

Are you saying that there's no reason for this outbreak to stop?

The weather is going to be hot.
They might not be able to move if their flesh decomposes and they become skeletons.

How long does it take for that to happen?

In summer, some parts of the body can become skeletal in about twenty days.
But it takes considerably longer during winter.
A couple months! That's not too terribly long.

You're kidding.

She's not smarter than she looks.

So what are you saying?

Medical logic doesn't apply to those dead corpses that move around and attack humans.
Worst case scenario, they might never decompose...

First thing we find out is if our families are okay.
Then we need to find someplace safe to hole up for a while.
But no matter where we go, we're going to need a plan.
Teams! We need to team up!
Let's try to pick up survivors whenever we can.

Let's do it.

What's the best way out of here?

Sorry to break it to you stupid, but we're gonna just have to go out the front.

Let's go!

Let me make something clear.
There's no need for you to engage in a fight unless it's necessary.
Do whatever you can to avoid a fight, you got it?

Remember: They're sensitive to sounds, so keep it quiet.
And they're strong enough to rip through regular doors.
And once they've got a hold on you, they're gonna tear you to shreds.
So be careful.

Takuzo...

Oh, shit...
Stay back!

Uh... Thank you...

Keep it down.
Has anyone (been) bitten yet?

What? No, no one.

It looks okay.
We'll be all right.

We're getting outta here.
Do any of you want to come with us?

Sure!

Man, there are a bunch of Them.

From what I can tell, the only thing they react to are sounds.
They can't see us, so it's pointless to hide from Them.

Why don't you go down there and prove that theory?

But even if we keep going through inside the school,
once we get attacked we're going to be stuck.

We have to go through the gate! We don't have any choice!

Someone needs to go and confirm Takagi's theory. Don't suppose you want to volunteer.

I'll go. I'll do it.

No, you stay! I'll go!

I think I should go ahead first.

I think you should just stand by, just in case.

Takashi, why?

I don't know.

You don't know?

Seriously, I don't know.

Taka...!

Don't. I understand, but you can't interfere with him.
This was his decision.

So, they really can't see me?
If that's the case...

RUN!

WHY DID YOU OPEN YOUR BIG MOUTH?!
WE COULD'VE MADE IT HERE JUST BY TAKING CARE OF THE ONES THAT ARE CLOSE BY
IF YOU HADN'T SAID ANYTHING!

But the noise would've echoed anyway!
Just start swinging!

There are too many!

Forget talking.
Just RUN!
RUN!


H.O.T.D.
HIGH SCHOOL OF THE DEAD


Takuzo!

Naomi, run!

Takuzo!

Just forget him!
Once you get bitten, it's pointless!
Wait a minute!
You heard me, didn't you? He's not gonna make it!
Why are you going back to him?!

I understand...
If the entire world turned into this,
I'd rather die with the person that I love.

Oh shut up, Dr. Bleeding Heart!

Look out!

What?

Don't you worry, Takagi.

You rude little otaku!
How dare you interrupt me while I'm talking!
Why would you do that?!

I don't know. 'Cause I really like your voice.

Huh?

Nice to see that you two are getting along.

Miss Shizuka, the key!

Target, confirmed.
Got a clear shot.
All good. Ready. Aim.

Hurry up and shoot the damn thing!

Let's go, everyone is inside!

You go, ladies first!

It's different from my little bug!
Let's see, gas, brake, and there's the clutch...

Help!

Hey, wait!

Hello!

Please! Please don't go! Help-

Who's that?

That's Mr. Shido of Class 3-A.

Shido...

We can go now!

Wait just a little bit longer!

They're in front of us!
Any more and we won't be able to drive through here!

Run Them down!

If Dr. Boobs tries to drive over that many, we'll flip the bus.

We don't have to save him!

Jesus! What do you mean, "we don't have to save him"?

We don't have to help him!
We should just leave him here to die!

Hurry, everyone!
You're going to be all right!

Okay, Mr. Shido!

But I'm not even sure if we can make it there at this rate.

I sprained my ankle! Help me up!

Poor boy... How tragic.
Well, I guess that's it for you then.
The world we've known is over.
The powerless have no place in the new one.

Okay, go!

Hang on!

To the gate!

I know!
They're not humans anymore...
They're not people anymore...
THEY'RE NOT ALIVE ANYMORE!


Can't believe we did it.

Yeah.

Thank God, we did!
I take it that you have been appointed leader?

There's no such thing.
We just work together in order to live, that's all.

That's not good...
In order to survive, we definitely need a leader,
a leader who bears everything.
With valor. With confidence.

You'll regret this.
I guarantee that you'll regret that you helped him!

The city!


Shit... Like I said!
It's only dangerous if we keep going!
First of all, why do we have to go with Komuro and the others?
You guys are the ones who decided to go back to the city.
Maybe we should have just looked for a safe place inside the school.
If you ask me, we were better off where we were!

He's right! I kind of agree with Tsunoda!
We should barricade ourselves some--

Okay, you all, that's enough!
I can't focus on the driving with all this yelling!

Yeah, whatever...

How about you tell me what YOU want to do?

I just can't this guy!
I hate him!

Jee...

Why?
What the hell did I ever do to you?
I don't even know you.

You know!

Asshole.

Bravo!
Simply outstanding teamwork.
I'm impressed. I commend both of you.
At any rate, a conflict like that only proves my point.
We need a leader.
We do.
Surely neither of you want such a difficult responsibility on your shoulders.

So, you're gonna run for the position then?

I'm a teacher, Miss Takagi.
And while mature, all of you are barely in your teens.
That alone makes it very clear who's more qualified to assume such a role.
I have experience!
Why, just moments ago I saved all of these brave students!
What do you say, guys?
There, it's been decided.
The majority seems to have made the choice quite clear, yes?

Rei!

No way! I won't do it!
I'm not staying here with him!

Get back in the bus.

Well, there's nothing I can do
if you don't want to act in accordance with all of us.

What "us"? What are you talking about?!

Komuro!

Wait! Get back on the bus.
When we get to the city, we'll get off.
I don't want you to leave.

That's why I told you that you'd regret this!

No, we'll both regret this!

Okay, you need to punch it!

What?

So much for getting back on the bus.

Komuro, are you all right?

At the police station!
Meet up at the eastern police station!

What time?

7 o'clock!
If not today, then tomorrow at the same time!

Looks like we're not taking this freeway anymore.

Okay! I'll turn around and find another way.

Okay, we gotta go!
Dammit!
You... dick!

Takashi...
Let's go.


ACT3
Democracy under the DEAD


<Closing>


Are we going to walk to the city?

If there's no other way.
Oh, wait...
He was wearing a helmet.

Do you even have a license?

Getting a ticket is the least of our problems.
What are you waiting for? Get on.
All that time I had no idea
that this world... was already over.
