  I stayed up late on the night before the day everything came to an end.


Hurry!

Hisashi, are you okay?

Are you nuts?!

Say what?!
GET AWAY!

Re...

Rei!

Hisashi!

Did you see that?
We need to smash their heads to kill them.

Rei! Hisashi!
Hurry, this way!

Okay!

Damn it...
What the fuck...
WHAT THE FUCK'S GOING ON?!


<Opening>


ACT1
Spring of the DEAD


You know, we're going to get married one day!

Really? Do you really mean it?

Yeah! Pinky promise! Cross my heart!

And hope to die!

Why do you have to repeat the grade?
You're a straight-A student.

You wouldn't understand, Takashi.

We're in the same class again? Cool.


Pinky promise...
Cross my heart, and hope to die. Yeah, right...

That's so stupid.

What do you want?

Every time you have to face something you don't like, you always come to this stupid staircase.
It's like your own pity corner.
Look at you! Good God! The first semester has just started.
How are you ever going to make it through the year?

I could say the same thing to you.
Fifth period isn't even over yet.

It's okay because I'm genius, unlike you,
who got into this school by dumb luck.

Takagi, why do you always dis me like that?

Because I don't like stupid people.

What?

Especially those ones who can't admit that they're stupid.
I mean, you're pretty stupid, but at least you know you are.
So, if I tell you that you're stupid, maybe by some miracle you'll be less stupid, stupid.
Huh?
Grow up! Moping because your little friend dumped you?
Stupid.


Listen, it's just that...
There was a time that I really felt that way,
but you didn't seem to notice, so...

So what?
Who's that? Trespasser?

You there, what do you think you're doing?
This is a private school.

It's okay, Miss Hayashi.
Let me handle it.

Hey now, Mr. Tejima!
Excessive violence is...

Oh my gosh, he's dead.

No way...
That's impossible. He was just...
Mr. Tejima, are you all right?
Oh Mr. Tejima, thank God...
You had me worried there for...


Komuro! You couldn't be happy with just skipping my class?

Come with me, we're going to get out of here.

Wh..What are you talking about?

Dude, what are you doing?

People just got killed by the front gate.
No bullshit.

Are you serious?

Yeah, I'm making shit like that up.

Jesus, what's going on?!
I can never understand what's...
What the...

Listen. Listen to me!

Just tell me what's going on!

There was someone at the school gate.
P.E. teachers went to check it out and something happened.
And now those P.E. teachers are killing each other!

That's insane...

What? You forgot something?

If what you told me is true, we'll need some weapons, right?
Here, Rei.

What about you?

I've got a black belt in karate.
Come on, we gotta get out of the school.

Let's call the police.
We'll talk to my father.

School rules are there to be broken, right?

No way...

What is it?

You may stay on the line or call back again later.
Currently, 110 is experiencing an extremely high call volume.

110 is busy, that's impossible.

This announcement is for all the students.
An emergency situation is taking place inside the school right now!
All students must follow your teacher's instructions and evacuate.
I repeat.

So, they finally realized it.
It's happening.

Get away from me! Get back!

Hirano!

Hey, Takagi.

Shhh! Gotta go!

Help! Help! Heeeeaaaaagh!

Huh?!

This way!

Where are you going?
We gotta get out of here!

The building with classrooms is too crowded.
We need to go through the management building!

Hisashi is right, shut up and do what he says!

All right, fine!

That's Mr. Wakisaka. What's the matter with him?


HIGH SCHOOL OF THE DEAD


Get away from me!

Rei, stab him!

Don't hold back; give it all you've got!

Don't fuck with me!
I'm VP of the martial arts club!

Yes!

This is insane!
I stabbed him in his heart! Why is he still moving?!

Rei, pull it out now!

Hisashi, get away from him!

Don't worry, I can take him.
What the fuck?!

Hey, you, get the hell away from him!

Hisashi!

Jesus Christ! Why won't he just die already?!

Oh no, I knew it...
He IS dead.
He's dead, but still moving!

What?
Hisashi!
Takashi, help him!
Don't you stand there!
Do something!
DO SOMETHING, WILL YOU?!

Hisashi, are you okay?

So of a bitch just bit me.
No big deal.

Stop it! Stop it!

We can handle one of them, but there's no way...

The rooftop.

The rooftop?

We should barricade ourselves until help arrives.
And we can see what's going down.

Holy shit, it's happening everywhere!

But everything was normal...
Everything was fine a minute ago!

Black Hawk?
American military?
That's not it; that's Self-Defense Force!
Where did they come from?
There's no base around here.

Over here!

Don't bother. I wouldn't even waste your strength.
That's the Self-Defense Force.
They must have some kind of special mission.
They're not here to rescue us.
They're not even doing anything about that.
That's what's going on outside where you can still run away from it.

No, stop it!

Imagine what's going on inside the school.

We should be okay if we run together, Misuzu.

Of course we will! Because you and I are BFF, Toshimi!

Let go of me!
Dammit, bitch, I said, let go!

They're here too!
There's no way this is really happening.
Dream, that's right!
This is a bad dream!
I need to wake up, go back to school.
I'm supposed to chew all of those new club members out today.

This is like a disease caused by Them.

Them?

The dead are attacking people left and right,
but this is no movie or video game.
That's why it's "Them".
They bite people.
And then they come back to life as one of Them.
And it looks like smashing their heads in is the only way to get rid of Them.

There are too many of Them.

Let's get up there and block the stairs.

Let's go!

Rei!

GET AWAY!

Why? Why is this happening?

There has to be a reason.
Maybe if we can figure out what's causing it, we can stop it.
Or at least, protect ourselves.
We need to look around. Find matches or a lighter around here somewhere.
If we don't make a fire now,
we're gonna be fucked when it gets dark.

Hisashi, what's wrong with you?
Takashi, Hisashi is...

Why? Why?
He got bit just a little, so why's he look so horrible?

So it IS just like the movies.
They bite you, that's it.

That can't be true!
What you see in the movies will never happen!

But it did happen to everyone else.
Takashi, will you help me?

Help you with what?

Help me over the rail...
Straight to the ground from here...
The impact from the fall should smash my head.

What are you saying?!

I don't want to be one of Them!

Hisashi!

Come on, Takashi, do it for me.
I want to stay myself until the end.

Hisashi, let me help you!
No! No, Hisashi!
YOU CAN'T DIE!

Get away from him, Rei.

No!
You can't do that!
He's not turning!
He's not turning into one of Them!
He's going to be fine!

Get away from him.

Hisashi?
Look, Takashi, he's getting up, he's getting better...
Hisashi?
What's the matter?
Hisashi!
No way...
This can't be true...
No way!

I know you can't believe it.
I can believe it.

Takashi...

But it's happening.

Don't do it.

IT'S HAPPENING!

NO!


ACT1
Spring of the DEAD


<Closing>


Why?
Why?

He would have bitten you if I didn't do that.

I didn't ask you to save me!
And how would you know that, anyway?
What are you, some expert?
And I would've been willing to get bitten.
Better to die that way than surviving by doing something like this!

I don't think Hisashi would've wanted that for you.

How do you know that, Takashi?
Oh, I know...
I know!
You must have hated Hisashi, am I right?
Because he was dating me!
Hey, where do you think you're going?

You obviously don't want me around anymore.
I'll go downstairs and smash Them.

Wh..What are you talking about?
You can't take on that many of Them by yourself!
Hey, wait... Takashi?
No! Stop it!
I'm sorry! I didn't mean it! I really didn't mean it!
So please, please stay with me.
Don't leave me!

On the day everything came to an end...
I killed my best friend.
Then I held the girl that I loved, for the first time in my life.
