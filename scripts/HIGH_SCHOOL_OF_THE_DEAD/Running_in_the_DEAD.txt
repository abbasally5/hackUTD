  ACT4
Running in the DEAD


I stayed up late on the night before the day everything came to an end.


<Opening>


That's so stupid.

What do you want?

Every time you have to face something you don't like, you come to this stupid staircase.
It's like your own pity corner.

That's right...
Everything was normal up until then.
I was in the sun,
enjoying the luxury of feeling sorry for myself.
If there was a ranking of the most pathetic high schoolers in the world, I'd rank fourth.
But at that time everything was already
coming to an end.
And none of us ever saw it coming.

Hey now, Mr. Tejima!
Excessive violence is...

Now that I think about it,
I should've just forced my way out to the outside, no matter what.
But we didn't have time to think, so we went to the roof.
Seemed like a good idea at the time.

Re...

Rei!

Why? Why is this happening?

There has to be a reason.
Maybe if we can figure out what's causing it, we can stop it.
Or at least, protect ourselves.

Whatever Hisashi says is always right.
I wanted to believe that too.
But I already knew intuitively
that the world we'd been familiar with was already broken.
So, I...

Gotcha!

TAKE THIS!

That's right...
At that moment,
pretending that things were normal sounded way too dangerous.
Everything was different.
Walking down the school hallway, the weapons in our hands...
It wasn't just the school hallway anymore.
I used to think high school was Hell,
and now it was.


I wonder if anyone will come to rescue us?

They're not coming.

Wh..Why not?
How can you be so sure?

Just like the helicopters we saw on the rooftop of the school,
they can't afford to be rescuing us,
and maybe they'll never be able to.

Never?
Then, what are we supposed to do with no kind of help?!

We'll do whatever we can.
That's about it.

God, you're so predictable.
The glass isn't half empty with you, there is no glass.
You've been this way since kindergarten.

I only told you the truth!

Yeah, well, you don't have to be such a bummer about doing it, you know!
Let's go.

You're right...


But no matter where we go, we're going to need a plan.
Teams! We need to team up!

Let's go.

Making moves then
meant we were getting ready to face the real crisis.
We ran through the school filled with yelling voices, screams, life and death all mixed together.
And then we were outside.
And it was more of the same. Just more of it.

They're not people anymore...
They're not humans anymore...
THEY'RE NOT ALIVE ANYMORE!


It's dangerous to go outside!
Do not go outside your car, no matter what!
I repeat:
Do not go outside your vehicle, no matter what!

If we move any slower, we'll be going in reverse.
At this rate, I'm not sure if we can cross the bridge before dawn.

SHUT UP! BE QUIET!
YOU'RE SO DISGUSTING!

I can't help it.
I've been so hungry...
Ever since I started PX90...

It's okay.
It's safe in here.
It's okay.

Mr. Shido...

You have nothing to worry about, my darlings.
There, there. It's all right.

There, it's been decided.
The majority seems to have made the choice quite clear, yes?

Rei!

No way! Uh-uh, I am not staying with HIM!

Wait! Get back on the bus.
I don't want you to leave.

That's why I told you you'd regret this!

No, we'll both regret this!
Okay, you need to punch it!

Basically, I wasn't aware that the world I knew...
it was just a memory now.

Komuro, are you all right?

The police station!
Meet at the eastern police station!

What time?

7 o'clock!
If not today, then tomorrow at the same time!


H.O.T.D.
HIGH SCHOOL OF THE DEAD


There's no one here...

Did they get away, or did they die?

But if they died they'd become Them!

Maybe they went to find others. The ones that are still alive.

Takashi, look at that!

No license, no helmet, stolen bike.
I'm just asking to be arrested, aren't I?

Oh what, after fighting that many of Them,
don't tell me you're still afraid of the police.

You've got a point!
You've got to be kidding me...
Rei!
Wait, there's leaking gas from that car.
Don't do it.

There could be something in there that we could use!
What's wrong with you?
This is Armageddon, man up!
Do you know how to use it?

I've watched enough TV. How hard could it be?
And what do they say?
"Don't aim it unless you plan to shoot."

What's the matter?

It's just a lot heavier than I thought it'd be...

Of course it is; it's the real thing.

It can only shoot five times?

Takashi, here.
The grip on the other gun was broke,
but I think the bullets are still good.
They're bloody, but still usable.

I'm impressed.

My dad collects guns, so I've been around them my whole life.
Besides, do you think I'd freak out over a little blood NOW?
Should we get rid of these?

No, let's keep them unless we can get some target practice.

Good point.
And don't you feel better now with something that has a little more oomph.

I wonder if they still got gas?

They say any gas station
has a tank that's big enough to hold enough gasoline to fill up a thousand cars,
so they should have some.

What's the matter?

This gas station is self-service.
We can't get gas unless you put money or a card in there!

Then, put it in there!

With the money I have, the only thing we're gonna get out of this pump is fumes.

You're the worst...

I'm sorry, okay?!
I guess Hisashi would have the cash!

Where did THAT come from?!
When did I ever compare you to Hisashi?

You said I'm the worst, didn't you?!
That means someone is the best, right?
You must have meant Hisashi!

I didn't then... but I do now.
What do you want?

Money! I need to borrow some!

I kinda... I kinda left my wallet in the bag.

Oh, Jesus...
And you're riding my ass?
Just wait here.
Scream if something happens.
Hello, is there anybody here?
Not working.
Oh well, I've always wanted to do this anyway.

What is he...?
He's having a field day, huh...
Come on Rei, stop giving the guy such a hard time.

Oh, no!

Hey, quit squirmin'!

Rei, what's wrong?

Hey, you got a fuckin' hot piece of ass here, you know that?

You let her go!

Why would I do that?
You think I'd go for one of those stinky ass zombie bitches?
Think again, motherfucker.

Jesus man, are you crazy? That it?

Crazy?
Hell yeah, I am!
My family became Them right in front of my own eyes!
I had to...
I had to smash everyone's head!
My father! My mother!
My grandma and brother!
Even my little sister too!
How can I be normal?
You think I wouldn't be fucked up after that?

Takashi!

Rei!

I sure like the way you scream. And the way you feel.
Quite a handful there.
You're fuckin' her, aren't you?
I bet you're stickin' it to this hot little bitch day and night.
Wait a minute.
Holy shit, you haven't! You haven't got on this yet?
What a fuckin' pussy, man!

Takashi!

Hey, drop that bat.
If you don't, I'll kill this slut.
And the bike! Gimme your fuckin' bike, man!

There's no gas in it.

I heard you in the store!
Put the cash you got in the slot, and pump the motherfuckin' gas!

Please touch the antistatic sheet before you start pumping the gas.

Hey, will you let us go now?
You can have the bike. We need to see if our families are all right.

Shut the fuck up!
I don't give a shit about your parents!
They're gonna end up like my family did, you fuckin' retard.

It's done.

Away from the bike, and start walkin'!

C'mon, man--

Don't take one more fuckin' step!

Dude, I'm begging--

SHUT UP, OR I'LL FUCKIN' KILL YOU, MOTHERFUCKER!

I've never shot a gun before,
but somehow I don't think I'd miss at this range.

The gas... the gasoline will blow us all up...

It's better than someone stealing my girl.

ASSHOLE!
BLEEDIN', I'M BLEEDIN'!

Be glad I don't shoot you... you asshole!

Stop it, Rei.

But he...!

We don't have time to be screwing around with this guy.
Besides, company's coming.

Hey! Where are you goin'?
You can't leave me here!
WHAT KIND OF FUCKERS ARE YOU?! NO!
COME BACK! COME BACK!


ACT4
Running in the DEAD


<Closing>


What's the matter, Takashi?
Why are you so quiet?

I was just thinking... Stuff like that is going to happen over and over again from now on.

You think so?
I mean, I guess so.

Don't worry about it.
It's over now.
There's no way it's just nothing.
It's been only one day since the beginning of the end,
but I've already killed a person.
There's no way it's just nothing.
