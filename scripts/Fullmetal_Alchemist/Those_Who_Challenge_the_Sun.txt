  Ed:
That oughta do it.
You ready?

Al:
Mm-hmm.

Ed: 
Don't be scared, Al. 
Everything's perfect.
Let' go for it.

Al: 
Uh-huh.

Ed:
Alchemy.
The science of understanding the structure of matter, breaking it down, then reconstructing it into something else. 
It can even make gold from lead.
But Alchemy is a science.
So it must follow the natural laws.
To create, something of equal value must be lost.
This is the principle of Equivalent Exchange.
But on that night, I learned that the values of some things can't be measured on a simple scale.

Winry:
That was Edward.

Pinako: 
Wait, Winry! 
Look!

Ed:
My brother and I knew the laws of science, of Equivalent Exchange.
The gain required sacrifice, that something had to be taken from us.
But we thought there was nothing more we could lose. 
We were wrong.

Ed: 
Al... 
Alphonse, say something. 
Al, no! 
Stay with me!
Damn it! 
This wasn't suppose to... 
Argh!
No! 
What have I done?!
Mom... 
Is that you?


Ed: 
I hate deserts. 
It's nothing but sand.
If there was some grass, I could turn it into bread. 
I'm starving.
Hey, Al, where'd ya go? 
Al? 
Hey!

Al: 
Down here.

Ed: 
Ahhh!

Al: 
I sunk again.

Ed: 
Reason number 2, I hate the desert.
I don't understand why you keep falling in!

Al: 
I get full!

Ed: 
Full of what?!
Get back here!

Al: 
What are you gonna do?

Ed: 
Nothing!

Al: 
Then, why are you chasing me?

Ed: 
Stop and you'll find out!

Al: 
I promise. 
I won't get buried again.

Ed: 
Not unless it's by me!

Al: 
Ed!

Ed: 
Arghhh!

Al: 
Are you okay, Brother?

Ed: 
It's your fault for not stopping when I said.

Al: 
You wouldn't stop either if someone were chasing you.

Ed: 
Shut-up. 
Too tried to fight.
Water. 
I can almost hear it.
Wait a second.
I can hear it!

Ed: 
Al, Look!

Al: 
Ed, wait!

Ed: 
Water, water, water, water, water, water, wa...

Ed: 
Guess this explains the nasty stench in the air.

Al: 
What's wrong?
Hm?
Is it blood?

Ed: 
No. 
More like blood-red wine.

Man:
Hey, get away from there! 
You know that's off limits to kids!
Hahahaha. 
You're out-of-towners.
That explains it.
You'll have to forgive me. 
I thought you were trying to sneak a little nip.

Ed: 
A fountain stocked with free wine. 
That's pretty ritzy. 
This town must be loaded.

Man:
Yeah, we do all right here.
Oh, I almost forgot. 
Time for a little soul food.

Radio: 
Children of God who live upon this land.
Pray in faith that ye may be saved. 
As sun lights the day, so does the Sun God Leto illuminate thy path, and drown out the shadows of suffering...

Ed: 
Well, that's freakish.

Al: 
Some kind of religious broadcast.

Man:
Your buddy's in a suit of armor and you are wearing gloves in the desert and you call us freaks?

Radio:
May this town be blessed and may we continue to experience growth and prosperity.

Man:
What's your deal anyway? 
You street performers?

Ed: 
I don't think so, pops. 
Do I look like a clown to you?

Man:
Well, you must have some reason, to journey out this far.

Ed: 
We're just trying to track something down.
That's all. 
Now who is this guy on your airwaves?

Man: 
Why? 
That's Sir Cornello.

Ed: 
Huh, doesn't ring a bell.

Man:
You're kidding me! 
You've never heard of the great prophet Cornello?!

Ed: 
What's so great about him?

Man:
He can perform miracles for one thing. 
I've never seen anything like it.

Man:
This town was a God-forsaken dust bowl before Cornello got here and transformed it into a desert paradise.

Man:
Cornello can even forgive sins.

Man:
Yeah, we're on the Sun Gods good side because of him. 
He gives us blessings.

Ed: 
Oh, I just remembered. 
We have to be somewhere. 
You ready to split?

Al: 
Yeah, okay.

Man:
Aah!

Al: 
Oops!

Man:
Now you've done it, buddy. 
What do you expect wearing a stupid tin suit?

Ed: 
Don't bust a lung, grandpa. 
We can fix it.

Man:
It's in a thousand pieces!

Al: 
I'm sorry. 
Let me try.

Ed:
Sure.

Man:
The drawing. 
What's it for?

Ed: 
You'll see in just a second. 
It's called a transmutation Circle.

Al: 
Okay. 
Here it goes.

Radio: 
If you are lost, follow me and you will be found. 
If you are scared, take refuge...

Man:
It's really a land of prophets! 
Your buddy can work miracles like Cornello.

Ed: 
It's nothing like that.

Al: 
It's science. 
We're alchemists.

Ed: 
We're the Elric brothers. 
Not to brag or anything, but we're pretty well known.

Man:
Elrics?
Not familiar.

Man:
We don't have any alchemists in these parts.

Man:
I fix things for a living though. 
Let me know if you need a job.

Lust:
He doesn't need any work. 
That's Edward Elric, the Fullmetal Alchemist. 
He's being celebrity around East City. 
They say he's a real child prodigy.

Man:
Wow, a real, live famous person.

Man:
I see, you got the name Fullmetal because you wear that armor.

Man:
Hey, would you come to my daughter's birthday party?

Al: 
Uh, I'm not the Fullmetal Alchemist. 
He is.

Man:
You mean that little shorty there?

Ed:
Shorty?! 
Could a shorty do this?! 
What else you wanna call me? 
A half-pint bean-sprout midget? 
I'm still growing, you back-water desert idiots!

Rose:
I see there's plenty of excitement around here today.

Man:
Ah, Rose.

Rose: 
Don't mind me. 
I'd hate to spoil all the fun.

Al: 
That's okay. 
My name's Alphonse Elric.
Nice to meet you.

Ed: 
And I'm Edward, Al's older brother. 
Also known as the Fullmetal Alchemist.

Rose: 
Older brother? 
But shouldn't it be the other way around?

Al: 
Easy, Edward.

Man:
Hey Rose, have you finished your shopping for today's offering?

Rose: 
Yeah.

Man:
Well then, maybe you could take them to the temple with you. 
They say they're looking for something. 
I bet Father Cornello could help out. 
You know, have them ask for Gods grace.

Al: 
Uh, that's okay. 
We don't really...

Rose: 
It's alright if you don't have an offering today. 
And besides, he has rooms for travelers. 
You could stay there tonight.

Al: 
Thanks, but, uh...

Ed: 
As a matter of fact, we'd love to take you up on that, wouldn't we, Al?

Al: 
We would? 
You mean you want to?

Ed: 
Mm-hmm.

Man:
It sure is nice to see a smile on Rose's face.

Man:
Yeah. 
She's beginning to act like her old self again. 
Her heart must be healing at last.

Ed: 
Hey Al, remember that women at the shop? 
She knew me. 
Have we met before?

Al:
No, I don't think so.

Rose:
You shouldn't worry.

Ed:
Hmm?

Rose:
I'm sure Cornello will help you find what you're looking for.
And besides, if you show him you're faithful, I bet he could make you taller.

Ed:
What's wrong with you people! 
I'm not short!
You come from a desert tribe of giants or something?!

Al:
Edward, please!

Ed:
You want some of this, too?

Cornello:
Serve true faith that all thy prayers may be answered.
As a man opens blinds to let the light flood in, so open thy heart, that the Sun God may shine on you.

Cray:
Choice words as always, Your Holiness.

Man:
Yes, Father. 
We'd be lost without you.

Rose:
Father Cornello?

Cornello:
Ahh, Rose.

Rose:
Pardon me, Cray.
May I put some travelers in the Pilgrims' Quarters?

Cornello:
You really delight in helping others solve their troubles, don't you?

Rose:
Well, that's what you teach us Father Cornello, so that's what I do... Or try to.

Cornello:
And God sees those good deeds, and writes them all down in stone.
But you must be patient, Rose.
We need a little more time to grant the miracle you seek.

Rose:
Yes.

Al: 
I spoke to Rose.
That grave belongs to her boyfriend.
He was all she had. 
Her parents died when she was a little girl.
She's convinced that Cornello can bring him back to life.

Ed:
And he's leading her on and letting her think he can do it.

Al:
Well, maybe he can.
What if Cornello really is a Holy Man? 
Those scriptures.
Maybe there is something else out there.
Something we can't explain.

Ed:
Don't count on it.

Ed: 
What do you think?

Al:
Looks pretty obvious. 
He's using alchemy.

Ed:
Yeah, but still, something's wrong. 
It's not equal...

Rose:
Hey guys. 
How are you liking your first miracle gathering?
He's amazing, isn't he?

Ed:
Well he's an amazing actor. 
I'll give him that.
But those aren't miracles. 
He's swindling you.

Al:
Now, Ed, we don't know that.
We just know he's using alchemy, and he's ignoring the laws.

Rose:
What laws?

Ed:
This isn't witchcraft, it's a science, and you don't make things out of thin air.
In chemistry, a reaction has to be balanced.
So does alchemy.

Al :
It's an equation, Rose.
Your output has to be of equal mass to the materials you started with.
The base elements have to be similar, too.
Like the radio I fixed.
I couldn't make it bigger, or a tree or something.

Ed:
It's our founding principle.
To obtain, something of equal value must be lost.
But that holy bastard's totally disregarding the law.

Rose:
Because he's working miracles!
What do you say now, Ed?
I'll bet you can't do that with alchemy!
It's a true miracle... It has to be.

Cray: 
Edward Elric?

Cornello:
Yes, Cray. Word has it that he was certified as a State Alchemist when he was only twelve years old.
They call him the Full Metal Alchemist.

Cray: 
You sure it's him, Father?

Cornello:
I'm afraid so.
The military they represent must have witnessed our paradise and wish to intervene.
They are greedy, evil souls.
We must save my children from them. 
Understand?

Cray: 
I will carry out the will of God.

Cornello:
Your heavenly reward will be great, my dear Cray.

Lust:
The boy's presence troubles me. 
I don't like it.

Cornello:
Don't you worry.
Even if Cray should fail, there is one other way.

Ed:
So, if you pray and polish the altar enough times, someone who's dead will be brought back to life?

Rose:
Something like that.

Ed:
Water, 35 liters. Carbon, 20 kilograms. Ammonia, 4 liters. Lime, 1.5 kilograms. Phosphorous, 800 grams. Salt, 250 grams. Saltpeter, 100 grams. Sulfur, 80 grams. Fluorine, 7.5. Iron, 5. Silicon, 3 grams. And trace amounts of fifteen other elements.

Rose:
What's that?

Ed:
It's all the ingredients of the average adult human body, down to the last specks of protein in your eyelashes.
And even though science has given us the entire physical breakdown, there has never been a successful attempt at bringing a human to life.
There's still something missing, something scientists haven't been able to find in centuries of research.
So what makes you think that hack-job priest with his parlor tricks is going to be able to?
And in case you're wondering, all those ingredients can be bought on a child's allowance.
Humans can be built on the cheap.
There's no magic to it.

Rose:
Well if there's no magic, then you bring someone back to life!

Ed:
Just a matter of time, Rose.
Science will find a way.
Science is the answer to everything.
If I were you, I'd drop the scriptures and pick up an alchemy book.
We're the closest thing to gods there are.

Rose:
You're not a god. 
You're nothing close to it.

Ed:
And neither is the sun.
It's just a mass of Hydrogen.
Get close to it like Cornello claims, and all you'll do is burn up.

Al: 
Great, Ed. Push your total cynicism on someone else.

Cray:
Don't worry, Elric. 
Your brother will join you soon.

Rose:
Cray! What are you doing?

Cray:
These two are enemies of God.
This is His will, Rose. 
Not mine!

Al: 
I don't think so, mister.
I got it! I got it!

Ed:
Strike!

Rose:
He doesn't have a head!

Ed:
Yeah! That's Al!

Al: 
Please, don't be scared, Rose.
This is how I am.

Rose:
But you're not there!

Al: 
It's true.
I don't have a body.
But I'm here.
This is my punishment for setting foot on Holy Ground, where mortals are forbidden.
We made a mistake, Rose, and we're paying for it.

Ed:
Rose, wait!

Rose:
Cray was right! 
They are evil!
What have I done?
They made me doubt you, Cornello! 
Forgive me! 
Please!

Ed:
I can't see a church social down here, can you?
There she is.

Cornello: 
You've wrestled with the darkness and prevailed, Rose.
Thank you for bringing them here.
State Alchemists, brutal enforcers.
I had a feeling one of you would show up someday.

Ed:
Well, let's not chalk that up to pious premonitions, okay?
You knew we'd come for the stone.

Cornello: 
Do you mean this, young man?

Ed:
I knew it.
Alchemy without a transmutation circle, completely ignoring the principle of equivalent exchange. 
It could only mean one thing.

Cornello: 
Yes, the mythical gem.
The legendary amplifier.
The Philosopher's Stone!

Ed:
That's it, Al. 
It's ours.
Cough it up, Cornello. 
That stone belongs to me now.
And if you hand it over peacefully, I won't tell the people here what you've been doing.

Cornello: 
What's that? 
Restoring their town to peace and prosperity?
Do you know what would happen if my miraculous wonders suddenly stopped?
Nobody wants that.
Do they, Rose?

Ed:
Don't listen to him, Rose! 
He's just a con-man!

Cornello: 
Nonsense! 
Would a con-man restore life to a dying town?
When I arrived this town was full of strife and I brought peace.
They came to me with parched throats and I created water.
I built buildings for them and even gave them money.
They believed that heaven had forsaken them, but I gave them hope and became their prophet!
Why does the military want to destroy all this?

Ed: 
I don't care what the military wants.
I'm here for me!

Cornello: 
What?

Ed: 
I need that stone. 
We need it to make something right again!

Rose: 
So that's it!
This is all about you and what you want!
What about us? 
You don't care!

Al:
Rose, we're only trying to...

Ed:
It's no use!

Cornello: 
Enough. 
There is no point in arguing.
If you want the philosopher's stone, you'll have to take it from me.

Ed:
Al!

Al:
Ed!

Ed:
Hold on!

Cornello: 
Armor is a disadvantage in soft sand!
You can't draw transmutation circles in it, either.
Let me introduce you to one of my creations.
You of all people will be able to appreciate this.
A chimera.

Ed:
You combined animals.
The most depraved kind of alchemy there is.

Cornello: 
Maybe so! 
But, most effective!

Ed:
All right, big fella. 
You want to play? 
Let's go for it.

Cornello: 
How did you do that without a transmutation circle?
Bring me his head, my pet!
Now snap it!

Ed:
Wrong leg, pal!
And here's the right arm!
What's the matter, you poor bastard?
Can't get a good taste?

Lust:
Mouth-watering. 
Eh, Gluttony?

Cornello: 
That's impossible.
Those claws on your leg. 
The teeth on your arm.
No one could survive that. 
Unless...
Your limbs. 
They're fake!

Ed:
Brilliant deduction.

Rose:
Oh, God!

Ed:
Don't look away, Rose.
You need to see what happens when you try to bring a human to life.
When you cross into God's territory, or whatever the hell it is. 
Is this what you want? 
Look!

Rose:
His arm, his leg. 
They're machines.

Cornello: 
I see. 
Now I understand you, Elric! 
You crossed the line!
You did what is strictly forbidden!
You tried to create human life and your bodies were taken to the other side!

Ed:
Told you, Rose. 
Get too close to the Sun, and you burn.

Cornello: 
Apparently so. 
But you were crazy enough to find out for yourself! 
You are the Full Metal!
The Full Metal Alchemist!


Ed:
Full metal alchemist.

Al: 
Episode two, body of the sanctioned.
A counterfeit philosopher's stone brings false promises and false relief.
But the tears it brings are real.
