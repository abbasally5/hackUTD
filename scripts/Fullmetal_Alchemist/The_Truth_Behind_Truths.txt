  Al:
A simple rock, red as blood, which promised to turn pain into delight, war into victory, and death into life. It was a thinking person's dream, reason conquering all. And it was in deference to this that it was called the Philosopher's Stone.

Ed:
How can this be possible?

Al:
I don’t know.

Ed:
After all this time years of searching, sacrificing, and this is the answer we get? The secret ingredient to make a Philosopher’s Stone, the only way to make it work, live humans and in mass numbers…

Al:
Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return.
To obtain, something of equal value must be lost.
That is alchemy's first law of Equivalent Exchange.
In those days, we really believed that to be the world's one, and only truth.


Ross:
Major, please! will you wait a minute?
Major Armstrong!
It's just, the boys seem exhausted, sir.
They've had a long day.
Maybe we shouldn't disturb them right now.

Armstrong:
Tired, you say? Then I'll have to take them to the dinner xxx.
Nothing like food in a stomach energize mind.

Ross:
No, ah sir, actually, I think they've already gone to sleep for tonight.
Why don't I just tell them you came by and wake up in the morning?

Armstrong:
Very well, lieutenant.
I guess we xxx those boys to get a rest.

Ed:
God must really hate people who go against him.
I was eleven years old then, and he still has me marked.
Every time I've thought I was in reach, he's pulled it away, so I'd fall on my face.
And then, when I've finally got my fist around it, he raises his big obnoxious foot and kicks me in the teeth.
Just face it, Al... It's gonna be this way our whole lives.

Al:
Don't say that.

Ed:
I really thought it was gonna work out, brother.
We would find the Philosopher's Stone, and it would all be okay.

Al:
It still will be. We'll find the Stone, brother.
We will.
And we'll get our bodies back to normal.
And be happy.
People say you're a dog of the military, that you sold your soul to get this far.
But that isn't true, and it didn't stop us.
And this won't either. 
We've worked too hard.

Al:
Brother?
Let's look at it again. 
From the beginning.

Ed:
I've looked at it enough.

Al:
But there's a chance we misread something.
Maybe we got it wrong.

Ed:
I said I've had enough.

Al:
But what if our code's wrong?
Maybe that's not what it says.
Or maybe we missed some key paragraph, like a loophole or something.
We should read the whole thing again.

Ed:
I said enough!

Al:
Brother...

Ross:
Is something wrong, sir?

Ed:
It's just a broken cap.
Go back in the hall.
Sorry, Al.

Al:
Yeah.

Ross:
So, Ed, that's really the end of it?
You won't regret it, then?
Giving up before you're finished?
That's interesting.
I didn't realize what you were searching for was so incidental you'd abandon it this easily.

Ed:
Stop going on like you know what you're talking about.
You don't know anything.

Ross:
Wrong, Ed.
I know that what you boys have been searching for is the Philosopher's Stone.
And I know it's created by sacrificing human lives.
I know it was uncalled-for, but I was listening through the door.

Ed:
Well, if you eavesdropped, then you must know...
It's pointless to chase after it now.
So leave us alone.

Ross:
You really are a child, aren't you?
You're frightened of it.
That all the answers will disappear.
You're terrified you might have to admit that everything you've done... Was wasted effort.
Am I wrong?
It's okay to feel lost. And not have reasons.
Verifying whether Marcoh's research is the truth or not is worth something in itself, if you ask me.
After all, what you're looking for is a lot bigger than you or Al.
Why don't you try searching a little longer, Ed?
But without worries about the final result.

Ed:
You're right. It's like a book.
Just because you're mad and stop reading...
Doesn't change the way it ends.

Al:
That's right!

Ed:
We've had roadblocks, and we've conquered them all!
I'll be damned if we stop half-way.
We'll take this all the way to the finish!
Let's do this, Al!

Al
Right!

Ed:
Doctor marcoh's research is sound in theory, but even with the inclusion of humans in the forging process, it still never made a perfect Philosopher's Stone.

Al:
So there still might be other methods.
Right. But let's check his method first.
I want to see the truth of it with my own eyes.
Wait a second.
Truth...
Bottom of the page... Like an after thought.
The genuine truth behind truths... Of course!
He was saying there's still something more!
According to his data, it takes huge refining equipment to create a Stone.
You'd need a massive facility. Like a whole complex.

Bloch:
Well, there are currently four alchemic laboratories running under the military's watch. They're all pretty big.
I know Doctor Marcoh was assigned here, at the third lab.

Ed:
No, I already went to all four labs in the city, and there wasn't anything remarkable going on.
Just a lot of fast-talking bureaucrats.

Al:
Hey, what about this?

Bloch:
Oh right. 
There used to be a fifth lab, but they closed it down years ago.
It's just an abandoned building now.
Apparently there were structural problems, so they made it off-limits.

Ed:
That's it.
Look. There's a prison right next door.

Ross:
So they had a spacious lot of federal land.
What are you getting at?

Ed:
If people are the key ingredient in a Philosopher's Stone, doesn't it make sense to put the lab in a place where you have a convenient, state-controlled supply?

Bloch:
You don't mean they used the convicts!

Ed:
Why not?
You couldn't have a cleaner plan.
Take condemned prisoners, say they're executed, then use them for experiments.
Who was running this laboratory?

Ross:
Lab Five. That was Brigadier General Grand.

Bloch:
And he was killed by Scar, as you're obviously aware.

Al:
What do you think?

Ed:
There's no choice.
What do you say we go check it out ourselves, Al?

Al:
Sure.

Ross:
Now just hold on a minute!
From here out this is grown-up's work.
Besides, as long as Scar is loose, you're a walking target.
You can't afford to stroll around Central.

Ed:
Yeah? So what?
Let Bloch and me be your eyes on the ground.
We'll go to Lab Five, and see if anything's out of the ordinary.
If we see anything, we'll give you a full report.
It's our duty.

Al: 
She has a point.

Ed:
All right. I clearly can't argue with you.
You guys can take care of it.

Ross:
Sir. It's the right choice.


Sheska:
Okay, Lieutenant Colonel.
I'm done writing down the court record for case 3263.
Can I please go home now?

Hughes:
Great, glad you're done.
Yeah, you mind holding for a minute?
All right, Sheska, let's keep that ball rolling.
Case number 9572, please.
They're gonna be using that in court tomorrow, so let's make that a rush job.

Sheska:
Yes sir.

Hughes:
What's wrong? You need an energy boost?

Sheska:
No! That's not necessary!

Hughes:
Look!
This is the special little swimsuit edition, with mommy's hat on!
Isn't she the most adorable angel you've seen in all existence?
One look at her happy face, and all fatigue just flies away!
Doesn't it?

Sheska:
Yes...

Hughes: 
That's what I say.
She's a natural-born healer!

Man on phone: 
Hello, lieutenant Colonel? lieutenant Colonel?
What's going on there? Can you hear me?

Hughes:
So, have you found Scar's body? Not yet?
Okay. Well don't forget about the security for the library.
Send them tonight.
Hmm? Oh, yeah. She's a real miracle-worker.
I definitely owe Ed one for introducing me to her.

Al: 
Are those tripwire alarms?

Ed: 
Yeah.
For an abandoned facility, the security sure is tight.

Al: 
It keeps getting more suspicious.

Ed: 
Come on. let's try the back.
Al, boost.

Al: 
Up you go.

Ed:
I hate to say it, but you can't fight convenience.
It's times like these I'm glad not to have an arm and leg made of flesh and blood.

Al: 
Same here.
Another barricade.

Ed:
Yeah. We'll have to find a more creative way in.

Al:
Hey. Up there.

Ed: 
Looks like it goes all the way in.
All right, Al, you wait here.

Al:
Will you be okay by yourself?

Ed:
Okay or not, it's our only choice here.
We're not gonna get your big metal body through this vent.
Sit tight. I'll be back in a bit.

Al: 
You know it's not my fault I'm big.

Ross:
Lieutenant Maria Ross.
I need to speak with Major Armstrong, please.

Armstrong: 
What is it, lieutenant?

Ross:
Sorry, sir, but there's something I need to tell you about.

Man:
Hey!
Contact Command. Tell them we need reinforcements, ASAP!

Man:
Yes sir!

Scar:
You are not my concern, foot soldier.
The Full Metal. Where is he?

Ross:
You two stay here. The rest of you, move to the other stairs. He's going to Ed's room.

Scar:
So, Full Metal, now you understand the truth as well.

Ross:
Scar! Freeze!
Damn.

Bloch:
Lieutenant, look!

Ross:
What about Ed and Al? Where are they?

Bloch:
Here's a good clue.

Ross:
Damn those two...

Envy:
The town of liore has been handled tidily.
Just a harmless spot in the sand now.
There's no one left who knew anything useful.

Lust:
Beautiful work, Envy.
We're glad to have you back in our midst.
Things are going well here, too.
But what about this runt, Full Metal?
I've heard that he's gotten wind of the lab.
Don't you think we should take care of him?
Before he tells the military our secret?

Gluttony:
I'll kill them! Let me! Let me, please!

Lust:
Be patient. I've watched them for a long time, and I still think they could grant our wish.
We can always kill them after that, can't we?

Envy:
I don't care what you do with them, Lust, as long as they don't mess up our precious plans.
Although, I do think it's unlikely they'll get past those funhouse guards.
No one ever does.

Lust:
I gave them direct orders not to lay a hand on the boys, but that ensures nothing. They are idiots after all.

Envy:
If it starts looking like too much trouble, we'll have to kill them all.

Lust:
I know that.

Ed:
Damn it. this is smaller than I thought.
See, if I was normal-sized, I wouldn't have fit, and we would've had to call this off.
It really is a good thing I'm so small.
No, it's not!
Lights are still on...
How do they explain that when they say they don't use this place anymore?
Just running up the bill for fun?
What the hell was that?
For them to go to all this trouble.
They must have something here they really don't want to be seen.
I'm getting excited. I just love being right.

66:
At last!

48:
Where are you going?
We're under orders not to lay a hand on them.

66:
Orders? I don't care about orders!
This one's all for me!
I'm going to drain out their marrow.

48:
Wait. There are two in our quarry.
And two of us.
You can't monopolize the pleasure.

Ed:
You know for a lifeless ball of rock, it sure is persistent!
Oh no!
See. And all this time I've thought being normal sized would be a good thing.
Damn it! Enough is enough!
Finally a nice, basic door.

48:
Nice of you to come.
Graciously do I welcome you here.

Ed:
You don't look too welcoming with that sword.

48:
I have been entrusted with guarding these grounds.
For now, you may call me Number 48.

Ed:
Catchy.
It's been silent for too long.
I'm pleased to face someone capable again.
But your luck has run out, running into me.
Do not think ill of me, child.

Ed:
And you don't think ill of me.
For being the child who defeated you.
How about a little blade-on-blade?


Al:
He sure taking a while. 
What could he be doing?

66:
Nice. You move well, for a big thing. Good.

Al:
Who are you?

66:
Ooooh. So demanding. I guess I should answer.
I'm Number 66.
Though, that's just what they call me at work.

Al:
Number 66?

66:
Yes. I have a proper name, too, but if I told you, you'd be so shocked you'd wet yourself.
I'll tell you when I'm peeling your skin.

Ed: 
As guardian, you must know this place pretty well.
I've got a question for you.

48:
Defeat me. then we'll talk.
Now, let's see how good you are.

Ed:
Quick.

48:
Auto-mail up to the shoulder. Perfect.
My sword can even cut through steel.

Ed:
I hope you're kidding, pal.
If I break this arm again, there's a girl who's gonna wring my neck.

Winry:
That's Ed's...
Whoopsie.

Ed:
Those reflexes.

48:
Why you!
Curious, child?

Ed:
An anchoring seal. Body-less armor.
He's just like Al.


Ed:
Full metal alchemist.

Al:
Episode 20, soul of the guardian.
We've cried some, laughed a lot, even seen Hell together.
How could all of my memories be fake?
