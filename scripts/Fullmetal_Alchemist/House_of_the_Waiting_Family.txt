  Armstrong:
It's beautiful here and so peaceful. 

Yeah, it's rural, a nice way of saying there's nothing going on.

Al: 
Four years, brother.

Ed:s
Has it really been that long?

Armstrong: 
You mean you haven't come home once since you left?

Ed:
You can't really come home to a place where there's no family waiting for you. You know our general situation, don't you Major?

Armstrong: 
Yes. I do.

Pinako:
Well, this sure is a surprise. Winry, better get out here! Honored guests!

Al: 
Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. That is alchemy's first law of Equivalent Exchange. In those days, we really believed that to be the world's one, and only truth.


Ed: 
Hello to you too, Den.
Old lady Pinako, It's been a long time. I need some more of your handiwork.

Pinako: 
Apparently so, you really have done a number this time, huh? I don't know why you have so much trouble keeping your arms.

Ed: 
Yeah well, I had a lot of things to swing at.

Pinako: 
Yet it seems like you've gotten smaller.

Ed: 
Who are you calling small, you miniature-sized hag?

Pinako: 
You're shorter than your temper!

Ed: 
You're so short you're two-dimensional!

Pinako: 
Micro-moron!

Ed: 
Grandma flea! 

Armstrong: 
Edward Elric! How dare you speak to your elder with such blatant disrespect! Let me remedy this fight with my genteel decorum.

Pinako: 
Who the heck is this guy? He really doesn't get the joke, does he? 

Armstrong: 
Alex Louis Armstrong, humbly at your service.

Pinako: 
Flattered. I'm Pinako Rockbell.

Al: 
Brother!

Ed: 
Great! I buy you a wrench, and you try to kill me with it!

Winry:
Well, apparently you're trying to kill yourself! What have you been up to?
Gone? I'm serious, Ed, I want answers! How did you wreck the best auto-mail I've ever made? I put my heart and soul into that!

Ed: 
Is it really my fault, though? It fell apart so easily.

Winry: 
Al's armor is all busted up, too, and steel doesn't shatter on its own! You've been getting into some real trouble.

Al: 
No. I mean... Ask Ed.

Pinako: 
Guess I was wrong, pipsqueak. You actually have gotten taller. At least by an inch.

Ed:
Then don't say pipsqueak!

Pinako:
You're off balance. We'll need to make some height adjustments to your leg while you're here. And, of course the new arm will have to be built from scratch...

Ed: 
Listen, I know I'm asking a lot, but can you finish it all in a week? We don't have much time.

Pinako:
Don't insult me, Ed. We'll have it done in three days.

Ed:
You're the best there is, Grams.

Winry:
But you just got in town. What do you have to do that's so urgent?

Al 
We-We just want to get to central as soon as possible. We're looking for something, that's all.

Winry: 
It wouldn't be something dangerous, would it?

Al: 
No!

Ed: 
It's nothing like that at all! Just some research!

Winry: 
Right. You're nothing but trouble.

Al:
We drive her crazy sometimes, but she's always there for us, right?

Ed:
Yeah... She is.

Ed:
Ah, yeah. I know it's a spare, but there's just something about the way the old lady makes 'em.

Al: 
It's weird being back. Kinda nice. Nothing's really changed here, has it?

Ed: 
Not at all.

Pinako: 
Mr. Armstrong, was it? I was hoping you could tell me something... About the daily life of those boys. Living as far out in the country as we do, it's seldom we get to hear any news from the cities. And those boys haven't mailed me so much as postcard since they've been gone. I worry about them, that's all.

Armstrong:
I can only offer you this. The Elric Brothers, especially Edward, have garnered quite a reputation around Central, and in the East. As the unfortunate result, they do get pulled into a wide range of troubles, from time to time. But it's all right. You take my word for it. Those boys are strong.

Pinako: 
Strong. Really?

Al:
Please help him.

Winry: 
Just bear with us, Ed.

Ed:
This pain's nothing.

Ed: 
I still feel like we're wasting too much time here. We've got to get back to Central and find Marcoh's work.

Al:
And we will. But don't you think you should relax while you can? Things probably aren't going to be easy when we get there.

Ed:
I know I should. But I can't stand lying around doing nothing! I get all fidgety!

Al:
Brother. I've been thinking. Maybe you should visit Mom.

Ed:
You mean go to her grave.

Al:
They said the auto-mail would be ready in three days, and you've got nothing else to do until then. Go see her. I'll wait here.

Ed:
You're right. I'll be back in a while, I guess.

Armstrong:
I saw that your firewood was a little low, Misses Rockbell.

Pinako:
Thank you, that's nice! But you know, you're free to relax, too, while you're staying with us.

Armstrong:
I appreciate that, ma'am, but no. Daily training is essential for a soldier.
And do you know where Edward is? I haven't seen him for a while, and that makes me nervous.

Pinako:
He said he was going to visit his mother's grave, I believe.

Armstrong:
I told him it was dangerous to venture out on his own. He needs to stop taking these risks.

Pinako:
Don't worry, he's not alone. He's got the best escort in Risembool with him.

Man:
Edward Elric? Is that actually you?

Ed:
Yeah... It's been a while, huh?

Man:
I'll say... Four or five years, right? Yet you're just as puny as ever.

Ed:
Hey, don't call me puny!

Man:
Ah, don't mind him. So, are you still one of those State whatever-they're-called ?

Ed:
I sure am.

Man:
Well you be careful, that must be a dangerous job, you being puny and all.

Ed:
Would you stop calling me puny!

Winry:
Hey, you okay? You're just staring into space.

Al:
Winry... That girl over there. Who is she?

Winry: 
Ah, that's Mary, you know her. Come on, you remember, we played together all the time as kids. Hide-and-go-seek and tag... Exploring the river and stuff.

Al:
Oh...

Winry:
Something wrong, Al?

Al:
No. I just couldn't remember who she was, that's all. My mind was blank.

Winry:
That's no big deal. It's been years, and she's changed a lot. You just didn't recognize her.

Al:
Yeah. Maybe.

Al:
How are we gonna live without her?

Ed:
We're not, Al... We're going to bring her back.

Ed:
Ready to go home, Den?

Winry: 
Is that the watch they give you?

Ed:
Yeah. It's got amplifiers that boost your transmutat...

Winry:
Can I see? The loving workmanship, the detail! Now this is the work of a craftsman! How's it run? Do you wind it? Or is it self-wound? Or could it possibly be a new technique?

Ed:
I don't know. And as long as it's functioning, I don't care.

Winry:
Can I see how it works, Ed? Please?

Ed:
Are you crazy? I know how you get when you have your hands on mechanics. You'll take it apart to the last screw.

Winry:
So, what if I do? I'll put it back together and it'll work just fine. You know I'm greatest mechanic on the planet, Ed... Right?

Ed:
Get somebody else's. 

Armstrong:
I think I'll go chop about a year's worth of firewood. Yes.

Winry:
Wow... You guys are stingy, aren't you?

Ed:
Al, I talked to Pinako. She said my arm is gonna be ready tomorrow. And I'll fix you, first thing I do. Things are finally looking up!

Al:
That's good. Brother? Did I ever have friends?

Ed:
What? That's an out-of-the-blue question.

Al:
I don't remember any of them. I try to, but it's hazy. They don't have faces.

Ed:
You know how memories work. You've had a lot of new experiences, and they just pile up! It's natural for old memories to fade a little.

Al:
There's something wrong with me.

Ed:
So, listen, Al. There's this thing, see... Something I've been meaning to tell you for a long time now. But I've been kinda' scared, I guess, of what your reaction would be.

Al:
What?

Ed:
Damn it. It's just...

Al:
Tell me.

Ed:
No, it's nothing. Forget it.

Al:
Brother, tell me!

Armstrong:
Gentlemen, look up at the sky! This night gives us a bounty of gifts, like a blanket of shimmering, brilliant jewels. It's a majesty that cannot be witnessed in the city, in its haze of electric light. This is an amazing place you're from, this quiet little village of Risembool. In exchange for its barrenness, it has much the city does not. You can lose yourself in the sky.

Ed:
Years ago... We used to look up at the stars almost every night, didn't we, Al?

Al:
Yeah. And dream.

Winry:
And now the moment youâ€™ve been waiting for, docking time!

Ed:
Yeah right, connecting to each of my nerves. I can't get enough.

Winry:
Don't complain, you baby. You wanna hurry and get back to Central, don't you?

Ed:
You've got that part right. This is just more motivation. I can't wait till I get my body back to pure-grade flesh and bone.

Pinako:
Well, that's going to be a real disappointment for us. We make a killing off you.

Winry:
Seriously, Ed, why go to all this trouble just for human limbs? You've got the smell of oil, the creak of synthetic muscles, the hum of spinning bearings. Who needs natural when you've got auto-mail?

Ed:
Loser machine junkie.

Winry:
Alchemy freak!

Pinako:
Okay, we're ready. One...

Winry:
Two...

Pinako and Winry:
Three!

Pinako:
You two, get up! We're going to lay him down right there. We could use some help.

Armstrong:
I had no idea attaching auto-mail was so painful. 

Pinako:
I've seen it make the most hardened war heroes scream like children. It's no small matter.

Winry:
Well? What do you think about the changed designs, Ed? I tried to make the steel eighty percent lighter than the last go-around. After all, we can't have it weighing you down so much you never grow any taller.

Ed:
That's got to be illegal.

Ed:
Making fun of somebody's height when they're in pain like this.

Winry:
Look at you. You've already got enough energy to argue. You'll be fine. Seriously, now. The lighter weight should make you faster. But that means it's easier to break, too, so don't be reckless. You can replace auto-mail, but you've only got one life.

Ed:
Right.

Winry:
That's the first all-nighter I've pulled in a while. I'm beat.

Ed:
Really, Winry. thanks.

Winry:
Don't thank me for the rush. I'm charging you a fortune.

Ed:
How do I look? 

Al:
How do you feel? That's the question.

Ed:
Great! A hundred percent.

Al:
I'm glad to hear it.

Ed:
Yeah, I bet you are. It means now we can take care of you.

Ed:
So, you're sure this is everything?

Al:
Mm-hmm. The major and the rest were very careful to pick up every piece of me.

Armstrong:
Will he be able to move once he's fixed?

Ed:
Yeah, well, you definitely have to know what you're doing. See that seal in there? That's the anchoring point. It's the intermediary between Al's soul and the armor.

Al:
It really was a close call, wasn't it? If that gash had been a little closer in.

Ed:
Right, so no matter what else happens, we've got to guard that better. Without that critical area, Al, there'd be nothing to tie you down.

Armstrong:
It looks like it was drawn with blood.

Ed:
Yeah. That's my blood. I was kind of in a hurry.

Armstrong:
Awe-inspiring! Such a bond! Such a display of brotherly love! 

Ed:
Back up, Major Spaz. You're really getting in the way of the work here.
Here goes.

Al:
I feel great! Thanks, brother.

Ed:
Ah, don't mention it. Should we do our usual routine now?

Armstrong:
What does that mean?

Ed:
Nothing. Just a little skirmish between brothers. Our teacher told us a long time ago you have to train the body to train the mind. So we spar once in a while to test our skills. But I gotta say, in all these years, I've never beaten this tin can once.

Armstrong:
Is that so? Then allow me to help you in your goal, Edward!

Ed and Al:
We're okay. - But thanks. - Thank you.

Ed:
I hope you're ready for this, Al.

Winry:
Hey now, boys, don't get carried away and break yourselves again!
Good grief... Talk about your one-track minds. They're still a couple of children.

Armstrong:
Next up, me!

Winry:
It'd be a crime against discovery not to find out how this thing ticks! The polished form, the curious workmanship. It's clearly the work of a master. Custom jobs are so great! I bet it's even better inside! I want to take it apart! Oh, please, I want to put back together again!
Edward? Whoops.

Al:
You better watch it!

Armstrong:
You're strong, but your attitude's soft. You'll never win like this!

Al:
Brother?

Ed:
Damn...

Winry:
Forget what?

Armstrong:
What's the matter, Elrics? Is that all that you've got?

Ed and Al:
All right! 

Ed:
Yeah! 

Al:
I can't believe it!

Ed:
We did it! We got him! 

Al:
We really got him!

Ed:
Good job, brother!

Al:
Yeah!

Ed:
Winry? Is there something wrong?

Winry:
I'm sorry, Ed. I'm sorry.

Ed:
You've got some nerve!

Winry:
I know. I didn't mean to see.

Ed:
Ah, hell. No one's seen that dumb thing, not even Al.

Winry:
I'm sorry.

Ed:
I'm one tough survivor, aren't I? Having to carry around my guilty motivation in my pocket, like some sniveling little kid with a magic charm.

Winry:
Edward...

Ed:
We've got no home, no family. The only thing that makes sense is moving forward. But I'm still wasting all this time here looking back.

Winry:
What's wasted? How can you say that? What about grandma, and me? We're a home that's always been here! Why do you want to keep shutting everything out?

Ed:
Don't be dramatic... What the hell are you getting teary about, anyway?

Winry:
Because you won't. Neither of you will, after all this time. So I'm crying for you both.
Where could they have gone? Didn't you tell them that we were having dinner?

Pinako:
You needn't worry about them, Winry, I'm sure they'll be along shortly. We just have to wait for them to return, like we always have.

Al:
This is where the front door was, and the living room. The fireplace was here. We'd start it when it got cold. You'd always find an excuse, so you wouldn't have to chop wood yourself.
Whenever we stayed out too late, Mom would flash a lamp from the second story window. It was bright, and it cut through the darkness, all across the hills. And no matter where we were, we could see it, and we'd come running home.

Ed:
Yeah. I forgot about that.

Armstrong:
You boys are fools, you do have a home, with a caring family waiting for you.

Al:
Brother, look.

Pinako:
Now you boys don't be strangers. You come by and have dinner with us sometime soon, you hear?

Ed:
We will. Home sweet home, right?

Al:
Thank you, granny.

Armstrong:
Yes, your hospitality has been immeasurable.

Winry:
So you'll come home soon?

Ed:
Yeah.

Winry:
Granny? I read the inside of Ed's watch. He engraved something on it. Don't forget. And the date they burned their house and left. But what, exactly, do you think he wanted to remember?


Ed:
Full metal alchemist. 

Al:
Episode 18, Marcoh's notes. 
The first branch of the Library in Central. From a pile of burned ashes, a stunning truth will emerge.
