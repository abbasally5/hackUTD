  Al:
Let's see.
These smell good, right?

Mustang:
This is Mustang.

Ed:
Yes, hello, uh-- Lieutenant Colonel Mustang?
This is Edward Elric reporting at the station, sir.

Mustang:
Easy, kid.
Don't be uptight.
You know it sounds like you've been rehearsing this or something.

Ed:
Sorry!
Sir, I mean Roy, I mean, we're boarding the nine-twenty train for Central.

Mustang:
Roger that.
Hey, wait a minute.
There's one leaving before that, isn't there?

Man:
Close the doors!
Clear the platform!
Now departing!

Ed:
Yeah, but, we had a little detour, and we got here late.
I think it's already leaving.

Mustang:
Get on it.

Ed:
But why does it matter?

Mustang:
Take it or go home!

Ed:
Hey Al!
Boarding time!

Al:
Now?

Ed:
Change of plans!
Come on!

Mustang:
Let's test their luck.

Al:
Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return.
To obtain, something of equal value must be lost.
That is alchemy's first Law of Equivalent Exchange.
In those days, we really believed that to be the world's one, and only truth.

Ed:
I can't get a solid read on this Mustang character yet.
What kind of guy do you think he is?

Al:
Brother, am I scary?

Ed:
Please, you're kindness in a can.

Marin:
Look, mom, he's strange!

Al:
Strange?

Marin's mother:
That's not nice, Marin.
You shouldn't say things like that.

Marin:
But look at him!
He must like armor a lot, to wear it everywhere, even on a train!
Do you think he gets hot?

Ed:
Nothing to see hear, folks!
Nope, nothing out of the ordinary.
Geez, Al.
No one told me we had tickets for the Normalcy Express.
There Al, you see?
She's not scared.
She likes you.
Right?
Cooler than skin, right?

Marin's mother:
All right, Marin.
You've bothered them enough.

Hakuro:
Guess they've had their fill of adventure for now.

Man:
General, it's great you could make this trip, and bring your family along without incident.

Hakuro:
Yes, the bureaucrats say the East is unstable, gives them an excuse not to travel.

Falman:
The higher-ups sure do take it easy.
Makes you think we're on a pleasure line.
Speaking of, where's Hughes?
I don't like him out of sight.

Man:
Sir.
He's at the switchboard, talking to Lieutenant Colonel Mustang about possible gaps.

Falman:
Better be vital.

Man:
Sir?

Falman:
I don't like him tying up the lines.

Hughes:
I'm telling you, Roy, it's a trip.
Ever since she got pregnant, she's turned hotter than a love goddess.
It's the miracle of hormones.
It's like this angel flew down from heaven and kissed her on the...
Lousy phones!
Cutting off my conversations!
I can't do anything here!

Falman:
You're the one we can't do anything with.
Now how do they expect me to run a tight security with a family of four, and a love bird.

Hughes:
Roy?
Yeah, these piece-a-junk phones.
So how am I gonna handle it if she has the baby tomorrow?
I mean, emotionally.

Mustang:
Hughes.
You've told me about this fifty times already.
If you're really having problems containing yourself, take it up with your wife.

Hughes:
I already have, Roy.
I talked to her this morning.

Mustang:
Then stop bothering me!

Hawkeye:
I'm sorry to interrupt you, Major.
But let me offer a bit of feminine advice.
Babies aren't born after just five months!

Hughes:
Uh... Sorry, I lost you.
Geez, she actually believes we're talking seriously here?

Falman:
Major breach...

Mustang:
Okay.
That will do it, Hughes.
I've just gotten confirmation from Intel.
We're not being tapped.
How's the train look?
Are there any suspicious O's or P's?

Hughes:
Nope.
No persons, no objects, in view, anyway.
But I've got a bad feeling about this.
There's been more people boarding and unboarding than...
Yeah, go ahead.

Falman:
There's somebody here!

Hughes:
Tell me.

Falman:
A man on the train.
He looks like he's ready for a full assault.

Hughes:
You found weapons?

Falman:
No!
He's in a huge suit of armor!

Hughes:
Armor?

Mustang:
That guy's okay.
And there should be another kid with him, sort of a pipsqueak.

Hughes:
Pip--

Falman:
--squeak?
He's right, there is someone with him!
And he is small.

Ed:
Who are you calling a runt so tiny he can only be seen with a magnifying glass?
You jerk!

Falman:
Relax, kid.
The colonel said it, I was just repeating...

Terrorist 1:
No heroes today.
Everybody shut up and get your hands over your heads.
Or say hello to a bullet.

Hakuro:
Who are you?

Bald:
Good morning.
General Hakuro.

Mustang:
Hughes.
What is it?
Has something happened?
Hughes.
Talk to me.

Terrorist 5:
Go tell Bald.
We've got the switchboard.
It looks intact.
They didn't have anybody manning it.

Hawkeye:
You think it's them, sir?

Man:
We've got a call to Headquarters from General Hakuro.
He says it's an emergency.

Mustang:
Patch it through.

Hakuro:
It's me.
Lieutenant Colonel Mustang.
You there?

Bald:
Speaking for the Eastern Liberation Front, Blue Squad, the name is Bald.
We've got the train and your general.

Mustang:
What do you want?

Bald:
Don't play stupid.
We lost contact with one of our allies this morning.
Someone who was supposed to deliver a manifesto to you.

Mustang:
I don't know what you mean.

Bald:
Okay, fine.
I'll give you the short version.
You have our leader in Prison Eight.
Bring him to Central Station.
We'll have ourselves a trade.

Mustang:
Very well then.
We have a deal.
But I don't want any fatalities.
If one man...

Hawkeye:
You're sure about this?
They have the manifesto.
They're serious.
But you know the General's policy on negotiating with terrorists.
He'll hold-

Mustang:
Easy, Hawkeye.
No one's really negotiating with anyone today.
I've already made arrangements.

Bald:
Something ain't sittin' right.
What is that Mustang up to now?
If he tries anything, don't think it'll just be you!
I'll kill every damn passenger on this train!


Al:
Brother.

Ed:
Don't worry.

Terrorist 1:
Helmet, take it off.

Ed:
Look!

Terrorist 2:
Bad idea.

Man:
You dumb kid.
What are we supposed to do now?
Don't you think they'll notice when two of their men have gone missing?
And what's gonna happen to us then?
They'll want retribution.
We would have been safe if we'd just cooperated until we got to Central.

Man:
That's right.

Woman:
What were you thinking?

Al:
What do we do next?

Ef:
Didn't plan that far.
Are you guys okay?

Marin's mother:
Yeah.

Ed:
Sorry about that.
Your big brothers here will take care of this somehow, okay?
We better get started, Al.

Al:
Right.

Falman:
Wait.
Over here.
How embarrassing.
Who are you guys, free-lancers?

Ed:
Just two old-fashioned alchemists.

Falman:
You don't say?
Well I'm Falman, State Warrant Officer.

Ed:
A soldier, huh?
You don't look like one.

Falman:
Yes, well, there's a reason for that.
We've got a special passenger onboard.
You know, the front car kind.

Ed:
So, that's why these thugs are here, isn't it?
And they decided to drag us down with 'em.
Al, I'm going up top, to throw a surprise party.
You go with him from below.

Al:
Yeah, okay.

Man:
Yeah.
Go ahead.

Terrorist over speaker:
Get over here, quick!
That damn kid!

Terrorist 7:
Hey, there's something funny goin' on next door.

Al:
Wait.
You shouldn't do that.
I tried to warn you about the ricochet.
You'll only hurt yourself.

Terrorist 7:
What happened?

Al:
No, wait!

Terrorist 5:
Problem, Bald.
We've lost all contact with the rear cars.

Terrorist 6:
What's going on here?

Bald:
Damn Mustang's reneging on our deal, that's what.

Hakuro:
Did you really think this could work?
You're a rag-tag extremist group with an outdated cause.
You can't outgun the State Military.
Why don't you surrender while you can?

Bald:
I'm the one who's giving the orders around here, General.
Don't forget.
I want a fresh sweep of every inch of this train, understand?
And check the outsides too, top to bottom.

Hughes:
You know there's a real art to train-walking.
I'm shocked you made it this far.

Ed:
Thanks, I guess.

Hughes:
I'm Major Hughes.
And you're Edward Elric, is that right?

Ed:
Uh, yeah, that's right.

Hughes:
Mustang told me about you two.
I'm an old friend of his.

Ed:
The Lieutenant Colonel?

Hughes:
Yep.
He's always bragging about that silly promotion, too.
Come on Ed.
We better work as a team.

Terrorist 10:
Hey, what's the matter?

Terrorist 9:
Where'd you come from?

Terrorist 6:
Well looky there.
A sitting duck.

Hughes:
Hey!
You okay?

Terrorist 6:
What the--?

Hughes:
Ah man, that was smooth!

Engineer 1:
Hey, you!
Don't mess with that tender!
It's the life of this train!

Ed:
Right!
Sorry!
Box of tender...

Terrorist 6:
You can't go out there, Bald!
There's something crazy up top!

Terrorist 5:
We've lost contact with all the other cars now!
They said something about a guy in armor, then the line went dead!
What's going on?

Bald:
Control yourself!

Ed:
Attention, gun-toting extremists.
You hear me all right?
Or did you blow your ears out playing target practice?

Terrorist 6:
What the hell is that?

Ed:
Let the hostages go!
You've got no right to drag these travelers into your personal politics!

Bald:
You're one of Mustang's secret agents, aren't you!
Interfere, and I'll kill these hostages one by one.

Ed:
You're just itching to draw blood, aren't you?
All right.

Terrorist 11:
Looks like a pipe?

Ed:
Okay, passengers, please hold on to your seats, and get ready for some turbulence.
Here goes.

Al:
Welcome to the brig.

Hughes:
Just look on the bright side, Bald.
You probably needed a shower.

Bald:
What's the matter?
Don't like my company?
Before I finish off the General, I'll take care of you.

Ed:
Me first!
Two Auto-mailers.
Go figure.

Bald:
You're just a brat.
Don't tell me the army's feeding kids into its chophouse now.
You're gonna pay for that brat comment.
And no one's feeding me into anything.
I'm on my own.

Bald:
A little piece of advice, kid.
I used to be in this military, too.
It was fine as long as I was pissing on cue, but then I wanted this upgraded arm.
They didn't like that, felt I'd be stronger than my superiors.
You see, the queen bees don't like it when the little workers have a sting they can't control.
Shortly after the procedure, they discharged me.
Since then, I've gotten a taste for destroying them, and the nation they command!
You understand, kid.
You've got an arm just like mine.
You've wanted to be stronger, too.
And the military, they'll just get rid of you as soon as you're not convenient.

Ed:
No, I don't understand.
And don't you ever lump in my reasons for this arm with yours!

Hughes:
Well good grief.
That was something different.

Mustang:
Don't take any lives.
That's all I asked you, Bald.
And, as it turns out, it seems you did just as you were told.

Bald:
So, I take it you're Mustang.

Ed:
That flame!
That's awesome!

Mustang:
I controlled myself.
The damage to your skin isn't nearly as bad as it feels.
You can call me Roy Mustang.
Or just Lieutenant Colonel.
Hell, you can call me the Flame Alchemist.
Whatever you do, remember the pain.

Ed:
So he's Mustang.

Al:
Brother!

Ed:
Hey!
You knew.
That's why you made us take this train.
You put us at risk on purpose!

Mustang:
Come on, Ed, you think I've got the whole world on strings?
Anyway, you should focus on the good news here.
The General heard about your exploits saving the train, and agreed to make a special exception.
He'll let you take the State Alchemy Exam.
You're going to be the talk of the military, kid.

Ed:
Exception?
But you always said we could take it! That's the reason we came!

Mustang:
Be realistic, Ed.
The state's never let a kid take a military exam before.
But, I guess luck's on your side.
Good thing you took that earlier train, don't you think?
Whether or not you take the test is still up to you.
I'm not trying to run your life.

Ed:
Of course I'll take it!
And pass!
I would've done it anyway!

Al:
Those people had us dancing right in the palms of their hands, didn't they?
I guess it doesn't matter what we do.
We'll never be the ones in control.

Marin:
There they are!
Over here!
Over here!

Al:
Hey, Marin!

Marin:
Thank you, big brothers!
I'll remember you!
Thank you!


Ed:
Fullmetal Alchemist.

Al:
Episode Six.
The Alchemy Exam.
No one but me thinks brother can pass the military's rigorous tests.
But on that winter morning, a great flower will bloom.
