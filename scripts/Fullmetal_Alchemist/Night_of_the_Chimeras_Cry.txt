  Mustang:
You should take this with you.

Ed:
You know I was picturing a more poignant ceremony. 
Trumpets, or something. 

Mustang:
Sure, Edward. 
Congrats. 
You're a dog of the military now. 
Lieutenant Havoc, take him home. 

Havoc:
Yes, sir. 

Tucker:
Nina. 

Al:
Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. 
To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. 
That is Alchemy's first Law of Equivalent Exchange. 
In those days, we really believed that to be the world's one, and only truth.


Havoc:
Come on, Chief, you look like the sky's falling down. 
Don't let the Lieutenant Colonel get to you, his mind is on a case now. 

Ed:
What case? 

Havoc:
There's a serial killer around, only targets women. 

Ed:
Sounds like police business. 
Why does he care? 

Havoc:
It's the military's backyard. 
It's dishonorable. 
Mustang cares about that stuff. 

Ed:
Or wants a promotion. 

Havoc:
It's true, kid. 
Mustang's no political novice. 
He'll do whatever he has to to move up the chain around here. 
But if that's all he was about, we wouldn't follow him. 

Ed:
Tell me then, what else is he about? 

Havoc:
You'll learn soon enough. 

Ed:
Check it out! 

Al:
Whoa. 
Is that the real thing? 

Ed:
Hey! 
Give that back, you stupid mutt! 
Does that have a big tag on it that says Alexander? 
Does it smell like rawhide? 

Al:
Guess he's still Ed. 

Ed:
Look, I promise I'll make you something. 
Maybe a twenty-pound bone. 
Whatever. 
Just give it back, Alexander. 
Nice and easy. 

Havoc:
Your tenant's becoming a star. 
Who would've thought that a twelve year-old boy could actually pass the exam, right? 

Tucker:
He is a prodigy. 
Hopefully that's a blessing. 

Ed:
Alexander! 

Tucker:
So, to honor Edward's ground-breaking achievement, we're going to have a feast. 
What do you say? 

Nina:
Hooray! 

Ed:
Are you serious? 

Tucker:
Mm-hm. 
Would you like to join us, Lieutenant? 

Havoc:
Sorry. 
Full schedule. 

Tucker:
Is that so? 

Havoc:
Oh, Mister Tucker, the Lieutenant Colonel asked me to pass a message along. 
Your assessment day's coming up. 
He says he's looking forward to it. 

Tucker:
Yes. 
I'm sure that he is. 

Ed:
This assessment deal, is that something the state does? 
If I don't submit meaningful findings from my research each year, they'll revoke my certification as a state alchemist. 

Al:
Wow. 
That's a lot of pressure. 
Last year, I didn't exactly get a positive assessment. 
So this year, it's do or die. 

Nina:
Let 'em have it, Daddy! 

Al:
I know. 
Why don't you make another talking Chimera? 

Ed:
Yeah, and we'll be around to see it this time! 

Tucker:
Well, that is what everyone asks for. 
I promise. 
I'll let you all see the result. 

Nina:
Ooh, a letter.
Who are you writing to? 

Ed:
A person.
It doesn't matter. 

Al:
Ooooh. 
It's to Winry, isn't it? 

Ed:
Hey! 
It's just a simple report! 
''Just passed the Alchemy Exam!''
''How's the weather?'' 
That whole thing, okay! 

Nina:
Winry's a pretty name. 
Is she your girlfriend? 

Al:
As a matter of fact... 

Ed:
She's not!
She's not!
She's not! 
We're friends!! 

Nina:
I know. 
I'm gonna write a letter to my mom, too. 

Al:
So your mom lives far away, doesn't she Nina? 

That's right. 
She told my dad he was a good for nothing alchemist who couldn't do anything right, and she went to live with her parents. 
Hopefully, she'll send a reply this time. 

Al:
Here. 

Tucker:
My wife.. she just couldn't stand being poor, and she left us. 
As luck would have it, I joined the State Alchemists practically the next day. 
The state's been good to me these years. 
They've given me this mansion, this entire lifestyle. 
If I don't pass the assessment, we'll go back to the way things were. 
I sometimes doubt we could. 

Nina:
Daddy, you can pass it, just like Ed. 

Ed:
You're barking, I get it. 
You want to go for a walk, right? 

Ed:

Listen to me. 
I don't want this simple stuff. 
I need info on a talking Chimera that Shou Tucker made two years ago. 

Woman:
Hey, Sciezka. Know anything about this? 

Sciezka: 
The Tucker reports are restricted, sir. 
You don't have access. 

Ed:
Well would you check on it, please? 
I'm not some normal kid. 

Sciezka: 
That watch is what got you in here. 
But you need clearance from the Brigadier General to read those files. 

Ed:
Brigadier General, huh? 

Woman:
Surely you've heard of him. 
The Iron Blood Alchemist? 
He's the authority on adapting alchemy for military tactics. 
If his name is attached, it must be some military secret. 

Ed:
This is getting interesting. 

Man:
I'm telling you, you can't go in. 
This branch is for Military use only. 
Stop! 
If you want access, you got to get a pass. 

Scar:
I was told this was the only place to find out. 

Man:
Stop! 

Scar:
What now? 

Ed:
Sorry. 
Pass the test like everyone else. 

Man:
Hey! 
Come back! 

Scar:
My brother? 
What is this? 
Why did you mark me so? 
This vile sign. 
What do you want me to do? 

Hughes:
Look, Elicia! 
Your big brother Ed is here! 

Gracia:
Honey, he's trying to tell you something. 
You're not listening. 
Hello! 
Take your time. 
You know I don't mind holding her. 

Hughes:
Back to work. 
You were asking about Tucker's Chimera, right? 

Ed:
Yeah. 
You being in the Investigations department, I thought you could tell me something. 

Hughes:
You do live with the guy. 
Why don't you ask him? 

Ed:
You know. 
He's so busy, with the coming assessment and all. 

Hughes:
I don't know too much about him myself. 
I know that Chimera he fashioned got him into the alchemy program. 
First one ever that could speak the human language. 

Ed:
You're sure it was real? 

Hughes:
Definitely. 
But it only spoke once. 
It said, ''I want to die.'' 
Apparently, it wouldn't eat after that, and died. 

Ed:
It was in pain. 
But, why would he make such a miserable thing? 

Hughes:
Who knows? 
But someone in the military thought it had some sort of relevance. 
How do you think he got that mansion? 

Ed:
And what happened to Tucker's wife? 

Hughes:
What do you mean? 
She died before he arrived here in Central. 
Is that wrong? 
Yeah. 
Go ahead. 
Serial kill... you sure? 
Ah, hell!

Boy:
Mom. 

Mustang:
That makes five. 
Hasn't Investigations found anything yet? 

Hughes:
Don't blame us. 

Boy:
Mom? 
Mom? 
No! 

Hughes:
Ed? 
Pick him up. 

Man:
Sir! 

Tucker:
Sounds like you saw something pretty awful, huh? 

Ed:
It's no big deal. 

Tucker:
You were crying out for your mother the whole time you were asleep. 
And you kept saying you were sorry. 
I've had my suspicions about you two ever since I saw your bodies. 
Now I'm sure. 
What you boys did, it's strictly forbidden. 
But I can understand. 
Science is a powerful thing, capable of so much. 
When you can, it's difficult not to try. 

Al:
Who are you?
What do you want? 

Grand:
I don't know what Roy Mustang's been filling your head with, but the research of Shou Tucker falls under the jurisdiction of me, Basque Grand! 

Ed:
The Brigadier General. 
So that's you. 

Grand:
The Sewing-Life Alchemist is one of my top priorities, and I know you've been snooping around. 
I can no longer permit you two to take shelter at his estate. 

Nina:
Where are you going, big brothers? 
Are you coming back? 

Al:
Don't worry, we'll come play with you again real soon. 

Nina:
Really? 

Al:
Mm-hm.

Ed:
Yeah. 

Nina:
Don't forget! 

Grand:
Don't they just eat at you? 
I hear when that kid showed off his transmutation abilities without the use of a circle, the King actually opened up his mouth and complimented him. 
Now that upstart Mustang's getting points for discovering him, my points, Tucker. 

Tucker:
I'm sorry if they caused trouble for you, sir. 

Grand:
I smoothed things over for you last year when you turned in a pile of trash and called it research. 
Fail it again, and I'll get the heat for endorsing you. 

Tucker:
But general... 

Grand:
What, Tucker? 
Would you rather the alternative approach? 
You want to pass the title of Sewing-Life Alchemist to that boy, and go back to your old life? 
Drifting the streets of some backward town with ideas and an empty stomach? 
Your assessment's in two days. It's time to show or roll over. 

Nina:
Daddy? 
Are you hurting somewhere? 

Tucker:
I'm at the end of the line here, Nina. 

Nina:
Daddy. 

Al:
You really think this is a good idea? 
What if you lose your certification for this? 

Ed:
If that's what it takes to prove me wrong tonight, so be it. 

Tucker:
Over here. 
Come on in, boys. 
I told you I'd let you see. 
It's a perfect version. 
A chimera that knows the human tongue. 
Listen, dear. 
That's your friend Edward. 
Look. 

Chimera:
Edward. 
Friend? 

Tucker:
Yes, exactly! 
That's very good. 

Chimera:
That's ve-ry go-ood. 

Al:
Unbelievable. 
It really can talk! 

Tucker:
I'll have no problem getting the funding now. 
I can't believe I didn't see it. 
The other one was too old to adapt. 

Chimera:
Edward. 
My friend. 

Ed:
Yeah, that's right. 

Chimera:
Edward? 
Why does it hurt here? 

Al:
Brother? 

Ed:
So, Tucker. 

Tucker:
Something wrong? 

Ed:
When was the first time you made one of these human-speaking chimeras? 

Tucker:
I thought I told you. 
It's been two years now. 

Ed:
And when exactly did your wife leave you? 

Tucker:
Two years ago, why? 

Ed:
And those letters that Nina wrote, did any of them ever reach her? 

Tucker:
What are you getting at? 

Ed:
Tell me this. 
Where have Alexander and Nina gone to? 

Tucker:
I hate prodigies like you, Ed. 
Too damn perceptive. 

Al:
Brother! 

Ed:
This guy used his own wife, Al! 

Al:
And... and this time? 

Ed:
His daughter. 
And his dog. 
He transmuted them into that thing! 
An easy process when you use people, right? 

Tucker:
Why are you getting so upset, Edward? 
It's the nature of scientific progress. 
Animal testing, experimentation, trial and error, all advancements have a price. 

Ed:
Shut up! 
I'm not gonna let you rationalize this, you monster! 
That was your own family, damn it! 
You've been toying with people's lives! 

Tucker:
Toying with lives? 
What? 
Like your arm and leg there? 
Or your brother's body, or trying to bring your mother back? 
That's toying, isn't it? 
You don't really think you're any different from me, do you Ed? 

Al:
Why, Mister Tucker? 
The whole point was to pass the assessment and continue your way of life. 
But now your family's gone. 
What life is left? 

Tucker:
That's the funny thing. 
I didn't have a reason. 
I fully understood. 
No matter what I did, my life would be ruined. 
I could either do it with the science or without. 
And so I chose science, to see if I could. 

Ed:
What kind of man... 

Tucker:
When you have the power to do something, it's hard not to try. 
Isn't that what we agreed on, Ed? 
Aren't we so much alike? 

Ed:
No! 

Tucker:
Sure, part of me did it for respect, and this house, just as you partly did it for your mother. 
But there's more. 
You're desperate to put your mind to use, Ed. 
To see what you're capable of, to put the world under your fingers. 
That's the essence of alchemy. 
You did it for knowledge. 
Control. 
Above all, you did it just to prove you can. 

Ed:
You're wrong! 
Alchemy isn't meant to be... 
I'm not like... 
You! 
I'm not! 
I'm not! 
I'm not! 

Al:
Brother! 
You'll kill him! 

Nina:
No, big brother. 

Ed:
Nina, I want you to bear with me, okay? 
This may hurt. 

Al:
What are you doing? 
You're not planning to split them, are you? 
You don't know how. 

Tucker:
The chimera is a perfect transmutation, fused to the core. 
There's no way to separate them now. 
Careful. 
You'll just do to them what you did to your mother. 

Nina:
You promised you'd come play with me. 

Al:
I know. 

Grand:
Assaulting army personnel? 
What the hell's going on? 

Ed:
Spare me, sir. 
He used his own daughter. 

Grand:
Mister Tucker will face a court martial, and we'll take the chimera with us. 
Naturally, you're to tell no one what you saw tonight. 

Ed:
What? 
You just want to cover it up! 
You knew about this! 
You want to make some half-beast arm... 

Grand:
Let's go. 

Men:
Yes sir! 

Ed:
Damn it. 
I'm not gonna let 'em turn her into a test subject! 
Nina! 

Al:
Brother! 

Scar:
Your make-up. 
Yes, you're made of one part human and one part beast. 
But I don't understand. 
Brother, how do I know that? 
You poor thing. 
You're a sin against nature, and your body's in so much pain. 
Oh merciful God, who shapes us all. 
Please return these scarred souls to your unending womb. 

Al:
You see her? 

Scar:
God, I understand now, the reason my brother gave me this cursed arm. 
So that I could find the alchemists, who have fallen from your path, and with their own demon arts, destroy them. 

Al:
It's like an alchemist deconstructed her. 
But who? 
I guess it doesn't matter. 
Even if we did find them, it wouldn't bring her back. 

Ed:
Sorry. 
Nina... 
I'm... 

Al:
Brother, don't.


Ed:
Fullmetal Alchemist. 

Al:
Episode Eight. 
The Philosopher's Stone. 
Brother is tormented. 
We're only a couple of children. 
There's nothing we can do about the killings. 
At least, that's what we thought.
