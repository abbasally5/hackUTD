  Al:
Do you really think we're gonna find the Philosopher's Stone in a rundown town like this? Looking around, it's hard to believe they ever produced much gold at all. 

Ed:
Which is why they're all the more likely to be developing a Philosopher's Stone. 

Al:
What do you mean? 

Ed:
Now that their mines are no longer producing gold, they've got plenty of reason to want to transmute it. And they could only do that with a Philosopher's Stone. What with this being a former gold mining town, it wouldn't look too suspicious. 

Al:
Is money all that grown-ups think about? 

Elisa's father:
Elisa! 
Hey, get over here! Give me a hand! 

Man:
It's no use! It won't budge! 

Elisa:
Daddy! 

Elisa's father:
It's all right. We'll get you out of this, I promise. 

Ed:
What's wrong? 

Elisa's father:
My daughter, she's trapped! 

Ed:
Hold still for just a minute. 

Al:
Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. That is alchemy's first Law of Equivalent Exchange. In those days, we really believed that to be the world's one, and only truth. 


Elisa's father:
I mean it! We sure were lucky to have a real alchemist like you show up when you did. I can't begin to thank you enough. 

Elisa:
And don't forget about his metal father. 

Ed:
No, you've got it wrong. Al's not my father. He's actually my younger brother. 

Elisa:
Younger brother? But, he's so much bigger than you are. 

Al:
Anyway, we're both just glad that you're okay, Elisa. 

Belsio:
Elisa! Elisa, are you all right? 

Elisa:
Uncle Belsio! Daddy? 

Elisa's father:
Get out! You've got some nerve showing your face in my house now, after almost getting my poor daughter killed. Listen to me, Elisa. No matter what he says, you are not to help him with his work, ever again. 

Elisa:
No, Daddy. None of that was Uncle Belsio's idea. I was the one who begged him to let me help out. 

Elisa's father:
I'm sorry, sweetie. Here, drink this. 

Belsio:
I am sorry. 

Elisa's father:
Uncle Belsio told me your lemon pies were always the best, Daddy. And that it was a shame all the lemon farms were shut down. I thought maybe, if I helped him, I could taste your pie. 

Man:
Don't worry, once the Philosopher's Stone is finished, we'll all be rich. And then we can afford to buy all the fruit we want from some other town. 

Ed:
Philosopher's Stone? 

Elisa's father:
Yes! That's it! The two of you must have come to Xenotime to assist Mr. Mugear with his research and finish the Philosopher's Stone. 

Man:
Please, do everything in your power. Make it as fast as you can. 

Man:
We want Xenotime to once again be the town of gold. 

Man:
We must reclaim what's rightfully ours. 

Man:
That's right. We're counting on you, alchemists. 

Man:
Our children must not suffer any longer. 

Ed:
Wow, that really puts a lot of pressure on us. I guess we'll just have to visit Mugear now, and see what we can do. 

Elisa's father:
Before you go, could you tell us the names of our saviors? 

Ed:
Certainly. I'm Edward Elric, the Fullmetal Alchemist! 

Al:
And I'm his brother, Alphonse. Alphonse Elric. 

Man:
The uh, Elric brothers? State Alchemist, hero-of-the-people Elric? 

Ed:
Yup! 
What was that about? 

Elisa's father:
Shut up! The real Elric brothers are already working to save our town up there with Mugear! Come back when you're ready to tell us who you really are! 

Ed:
Now why would somebody go around using our names? 

Al:
Brother? Are you really going to sneak in there? 

Ed:
Of course we are! To confront these impostors and get them to tell us all about the Philosopher's Stone! 

Fletcher:
Brother? Was that... 

Russell:
A transmutation. 

Ed:
Look at this. All these books are about the Philosopher's Stone. 

Al:
Then this must be where they're making it, right? 

Ed:
No doubt about it. 

Russell:
In case the guards weren't a clue, this place is off-limits. 

Al:
By any chance, are you guys the ones... 

Ed:
Stealing our names? 

Russell:
I take it that means that you're the real Ed, in the suit, huh? 

Al:
Me? 

Ed:
No, you dolt! I'm Ed, not him! Why does everyone always think that! 

Fletcher:
Huh? So you're the older brother? 

Ed:
Damn right! 

Russell:
Try to tone it down a notch. Or the gunmen will realize you're here. How bizarre. The real younger brother wears a suit of armor to protect himself. It's hard to believe you're only fourteen. 

Al:
How do you know so much about us? 

Ed:
You wanna start something with me? 

Russell:
No, I don't want to fight with you, Ed. So why don't you turn around and go home and leave us to take care of things around here? 

Ed:
That's not the way you beg someone to do something. On your knees! I said get down on the ground! 

Russell:
What, so we can see eye to eye? Surely you must be used to people looking down on you. 
An automail arm, huh? I guess the real Ed's seen some action, too. 

Ed:
And I'm glad to see you have some skills. I'd hate for you to be damaging my name. 

Russell:
You know, I've always wanted to find out what a bona fide State Alchemist is capable of. 

Ed:
And I think you're gonna be sorry you asked! 

Russell:
Not bad. You don't need a circle, huh? 

Al:
The fake you doesn't need a circle either! 

Ed:
How did you... You have a Philosopher's Stone? 

Man:
What was all that commotion? 

Man:
It came from in here! 

Ed:
Damn it. I feel sore all over. 

Al:
The fake you was pretty powerful, huh? 

Ed:
He had something giving him a boost. 

Al:
Does that mean they've finished making a Philosopher's Stone? 

Ed:
I don't know but we're gonna find out. 

Al:
You know, I wonder what those brothers' real names are. Or if they're even really brothers at all. And I wonder if the older brother is actually much older than you are, or-- 

Ed:
Size doesn't mean anything. 

Fletcher:
Brother, I think we should just give this ruse up already. What if the real Elric brothers turn us in? Then what? 

Russell:
Don't worry. Nobody around here is going to believe anything they say. So just concentrate on completing the Stone, so we can split town. 

Fletcher:
I just hope it works out that way. 

Russell:
Well I'm not gonna let Mugear take credit for the research Dad devoted his entire life to. 

Fletcher:
But, what if... 

Russell:
Don't worry. If it comes down to that, I'll make sure you get away safely. No matter what. 

Fletcher:
You don't get it, brother. I'm not worried about myself. There's a lot more going on here than that. 

Lust:
Are you sure you should be standing so close to it? 

Mugear:
I didn't expect to see you here. 

Lust:
And I didn't expect you to let those kids in. 

Mugear:
But there's no need to worry. My guards scared off the Elric brothers. I think we've seen the last of them. 

Lust:
Don't bet on it. Those boys can be frustratingly resourceful when they want, a desirable trait. Of course, we always knew it was only a matter of time before the military took interest in your research. You've had your shot, but maybe it's time you called it quits, Mugear. 

Mugear:
A little more time. Please. That's all I need. Just give me a little more time! I promise you, I'll complete the Philosopher's Stone. 

Lust:
Make it fast. You know how I hate being dissatisfied. 


Al:
It's starting to swell up pretty good. 

Ed:
Ah! Your cold metal feels just like an icepack. 

Al:
Glad I could be of some comfort to you, brother, even in this armor. 

Ed:
Hey, you were the guy with the lemons before, right? 

Belsio:
If you need a place to board up, you can come with me. 

Al:
Thank you so much for taking us in. 

Belsio:
Couldn't very well let you kids sleep outside, could I? 

Ed:
Aren't you gonna ask us what our names are? 

Belsio:
You're the Elric brothers. That's what you say. 

Al:
Uh... Then you believe us? 

Belsio:
Honestly, not in the least, but I figure you kids must have your own reasons for saying that you are. Makes no difference to me to each their own. 

Ed:
So you're not into the Philosopher's Stone, like your neighbors are? 

Belsio:
Everyone else is unable, or unwilling, to forget the wealth the gold once brought them. So Mugear has got them wrapped around his finger. 

Elisa:
Good morning, Uncle Belsio! 

Belsio:
If your father finds out you're here, he won't be happy. 

Elisa:
Not to worry! Daddy's too wrapped up in talk about the gold mine to even notice! 

Al:
Good morning. 

Elisa:
Hey, it's the make-believe Elric brothers. That must hurt! Did somebody hit you because you were telling lies again? 

Ed:
I'm telling you, we're not the impostors here, kid. But I did get clocked by one of them. 

Elisa:
Wait, you don't mean that you're the ones who snuck into Mugear's mansion last night do you, pretend brothers? 

Ed:
Of course, we did! We can't just let those phonies run off with our names! Besides, it's a major crime to use a Philosopher's Stone to make gold. They're going down. 

Al:
Brother. 

Ed:
I'm gonna see what I can find out in town. 

Al:
Brother! 

Belsio:
Hey, big guy! 

Al:
Yes? 

Belsio:
How would you like to run down to the pharmacy for me today? 

Al:
What do you need? 

Belsio:
Elisa needs her medicine and your brother. He could probably use a cold compress. 

Woman:
My word. Don't look now but one of those charlatans just walked in. 

Woman:
The gall of him showing his deceitful face in here. 

Woman:
And you just know they were the ones who broke into Mugear's mansion last night and tried to rob him! 

Woman:
Hey, you! What're you doin' here? 

Al:
I-I just need to get some medicine. 

Woman:
Well, we don't have nothing here to keep you from telling lies, so go on and get out! 

Al:
Great. Now how am I gonna get that medicine for Elisa? 

Fletcher:
Uh, excuse me. 

Al:
You. 

Fletcher:
I can buy that medicine for you, if you let me. To make up for me borrowing your identity. 
Here. 

Al:
Thank you, very much. I guess both of us have older brothers who let their tempers get the better of them. 

Fletcher:
Aren't you mad at us? 

Al:
I figure you have your own reasons. 

Fletcher:
I'm sorry. For us to work with Mugear, we had to have some credibility. The only way my brother could pass for a State Alchemist, as a teenager, was to claim he was the famous Edward Elric. 

Al:
You want a Philosopher's Stone that badly? 

Fletcher:
My father, he devoted his entire life to working on the stone. 

Al:
So your father was an alchemist, too? 

Fletcher:
Mm-hmm. But then one day, he was suddenly gone. So now, out of love for Dad, my brother insists on completing his research. 

Al:
That's the opposite of my family. Our father was also an alchemist, but my brother hates him for it. He was obsessed with the science, and our mother suffered because of it, especially when he left her, and us. On our journeys, my brother and I have met a lot more people who've suffered because of alchemy, too. Listen, if your brother's doing something you know is wrong, please, just be brave and stop him. It's tough, I know, but if someone else has to intervene, it'll only hurt your brother more. 
Hey, have you noticed how there are an awful lot of people with bad coughs in this town? 

Fletcher:
Uh, no. 

Al:
Well, isn't this stuff cough medicine? 

Fletcher:
Actually... 
Brother! Sorry. I have to go now! 

Al:
Wait! Tell me your real name. 

Fletcher:
It's Fletcher! 

Al:
Brother? Why are you running? 

Ed:
That impostor is around here somewhere! Have you seen 'em? 

Al:
Uh... Um, no. 

Ed:
That unethical jerk! Did you know he's been fixing people's tools and transmuting wheels all over town? 

Al:
That's better than him using your name to do bad stuff. 

Ed:
That isn't the point! It's the way he works! He's got no regard for the Law of Equivalent Exchange! Al, we're gonna sneak into the mansion again tonight. 

Al:
What? Just one day later? 

Ed:
Right. They won't expect us. 

Fletcher:
Brother. There's something I need to talk to you about. 

Ed:
Tonight we're trying Operation Mole Hole! 

Al:
Mole Hole? 

Ed:
By my calculations, we should be under the center of the mansion now. 

Al:
Are you sure? 

Ed:
No, but we gotta come out somewhere. We're in! 

Al:
What is this? 

Ed:
So that's their plan. I think this is the chemical used to produce the red stone. 

Al:
What red stone? 

Ed:
I remember reading something about it at the library in Central. It's a theoretical solid, pumped full of alchemic catalysts. You put this refined red water under a few megatons of pressure, till it turns to stone. 

Al:
A Philosopher's Stone? 

Ed:
No. More like a cheap imitation. I think there was some alchemist named Nash or something who was researching the red stone, but in the end, it never panned out. 

Al:
Brother? 

Ed:
I'm having some trouble breathing. 

Al:
Brother! Brother! 

Fletcher:
This way! 

Al:
Uh... Who's there? 

Fletcher:
It's me! Come on! Hurry! 

Al:
Fletcher. 
Brother, are you all right? 

Ed:
Where... where am I, Al? And what the hell is he doing here? 

Fletcher:
I... I'm sorry! 

Ed:
Huh? Well what are you sorry about? What'd you do? 

Al:
No, Fletcher, it's what you didn't do, isn't it? If you know something, tell us. I get the feeling you don't like what's going on here. 

Fletcher:
That red water you saw, it's a toxic substance that's been polluting the whole town. But it's... it's the vital ingredient for creating a red stone. 

Al:
Is that why the people in Xenotime have been coughing so badly? 

Fletcher:
I'm so sorry! 

Ed:
Okay, this is ridiculous. First thing's first, let's demolish this lab. 

Russell:
I can't let you do that. After all the work we put into it, we've finally created a red stone. My father gave everything he had in pursuit of this breakthrough, Mister Elric. If you think I'm gonna give up now, you're quite mistaken. 

Ed:
So, you care that much about a lame piece of costume jewelry? 
Yeah, a fake sword from a fake stone, huh? I think I can top that! 
Mine is the genuine article. 

Russell:
What the-- 
Red water straight from the tap. If you're doused with it, you're a goner. You'll lose a lot more than your consciousness. 

Ed:
Fine, let it rain. 

Al:
Ed, this is crazy! 

Russell:
Your brother's right! Just go and you can live. 

Ed:
Never! I'm not giving up to some naive kid who's desperate to be just like Daddy! 

Al:
Fletcher! Fletcher, hang in there! 

Fletcher:
Brother, the reason Dad wanted to create a red stone was to bring happiness to people and to make their lives better! But what we've been doing here, it's actually been making people suffer, hasn't it? Don't you see, the cost of forging that stone? It doesn't matter who gets credit anymore! Because this isn't... Because Dad would be ashamed if he could see what we've done!

There's more to being me than just using my name. Can you handle the consequences?
