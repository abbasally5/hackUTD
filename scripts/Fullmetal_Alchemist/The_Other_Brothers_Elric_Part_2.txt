  Man:
Mister Edward! Is everything all right in there? 

Russell:
Yeah, I'm fine. I told them not to bother me in here. 

Ed:
Maybe they don't really trust you. Though I can't see why, except for, you know, you lying about who you are. 

Russell:
What the--
Fletcher? 

Fletcher:
Run for it! Hurry! 

Al:
Brother. 

Fletcher:
If they catch you we're all in trouble, so please get out of here quickly! I promise I'll explain everything later! 

Ed:
All right. Let's go! 

Fletcher:
You can blame me, brother. 

Al:
Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. That is alchemy's first Law of Equivalent Exchange. In those days, we really believed that to be the world's one, and only truth.


Russell:
You promised you would never experiment with alchemy, Fletcher. You know that Dad didn't like you doing it. 

Mugear:
My lab! What have they done to my lab? 

Russell:
Mister Mugear. 

Mugear:
Oh, I'm glad to see you're all right. The stone? Has it been damaged? 

Russell:
No need to worry. It's intact. 

Mugear:
It's a decent size. I commend you for getting this far. But I'm afraid that our time-table's been pushed up. I need you to move directly into our contingency plan. 

Russell:
But sir, we've made real progress. We don't need to resort to that. 

Mugear:
Are you questioning the only person who's given you a chance? 

Russell:
No, no. 

Mugear:
There was once another alchemist who couldn't do what I asked him. He left here with his tail between his legs, and he was never heard from again. 

Russell:
What is that? 

Mugear:
With this machine, even a non-alchemist, such as myself has options. 

Russell:
Why are you doing this? 

Mugear:
Because I can. You honestly think I'm a fool, don't you, that I don't realize the true Edward Elric has an automail arm? Or that you're the sons of Nash Tringham? 

Belsio:
A lot of excitement up at the mansion tonight, huh boys? 

Ed:
You don't say. 

Belsio:
The second night in a row. There's not much hope for you, is there? 

Al:
Is Elisa still here? 

Belsio:
Her father's going to be furious, but she wanted to stay here, and like you two, she won't listen to reason. I had no choice, though, with her coughing like that, so I put her to bed. 
Red water? 

Ed:
They want to crystallize it into a red stone, an alchemic amplifier. Stupid. Compared to the Philosopher's Stone, it's a cheap imitation. They're wasting their time. 

Al:
He said his father put his whole life into that research. 

Ed:
Yeah, yeah, probably another lie. 

Belsio:
Unless, maybe they're the sons of Nash Tringham. 

Ed:
Nash Tringham? You mean that theorist I read about, the guy who came up with the idea? 

Belsio:
He grew up in Xenotime, just like me. He only moved to Central to put his research together on the red water. He was gone for years. And then one night, he just showed up again, out of the blue. It was raining. 

Belsio:
Nash Tringham. You really are back. Guess I lost that bet. How are you? 
The town's worse off now than when you left. I keep saying we need to give up on gold, but that's a pill no one wants to swallow. So, how's research on the red water going, brains? Any luck yet? 

Nash:
Abandoned. I'll never mess with it again. And I'm not going back to Central. Ever. 

Belsio:
But Nash, what about your family? 

Nash:
I've been a failure, both as a good husband and a father. 

Belsio:
No, Nash. 
He'd left behind everything that mattered to him. But he wouldn't tell me a word about what had happened in Central. He was a wet, wounded animal, ready to be pounced on. And the town's biggest land baron, Mugear, had made his fortune smelling blood. 

Nash:
Beg me all you want, the answer's the same. 

Mugear:
You're going to turn your back on this town, too? The mines have dried up and people are suffering. But your red water could make us produce again. Once we have the gold, the town will bounce back, twice as strong! We need you, Nash. You could be our hero. You can still make something out of your life. 

Belsio:
Ultimately, he gave in, secluding himself in Mugear's mine to resume research. And as the land baron promised, the town was once again lit by gold. Furnaces were aflame, vendors filled the streets with their wares. Life returned to the people. But at the same time, a mysterious plague began to spread. We had all the money we wanted, but we couldn't buy a cure. Many, many babies succumbed to the disease soon after birth. 

Ed:
Elisa was born then? 

Belsio:
When she was a baby, an alchemic doctor named Marcoh passed through town and took a look at her. 

Marcoh:
Somehow she's come into contact with red water. I'll do whatever I can. 

Ed:
It glowed? 

Belsio:
Yes. 

Al:
The doctor's tool, could it have been the real thing? 

Belsio:
Whatever it was, we have that treatment to thank for Elisa's survival. I hounded Nash all about the red water. 

Belsio:
Answer me, Nash! Before this whole town becomes a graveyard. What the hell have you done here? 

Nash:
It's all my fault. I've brought it out, again. Sorry, Belsio. I'm going to stop it. Once, and for all. 

Belsio:
But Nash... 

Belsio:
That was the last time anyone ever saw him. Soon after, the gold dried up and the town was once again on the decline. If those are indeed Nash's boys, they must have come here in search of their father. Or his work. 

Al:
Brother. 

Ed:
What is it? 

Al:
Is it wrong? They wanted something to bring them closer to their dad. 

Ed:
Oh please, Al! They're just using their father to justify their own selfish causes. 

Al:
Maybe. But is it really all that different from what we're doing? All I'm saying is, I know how they must feel. 

Mugear:
You're useless! You just had to put the contingency Phase 2 into effect! 

Fletcher:
Brother? What is Phase 2? 

Mugear:
Simple, really. You introduce the red water into the drinking supply of pregnant women. It permeates their placenta, a factory of biological condensing. 

Fletcher:
No! 

Russell:
You shut up! 

Mugear:
When the process is done, you extract it and transmute it into a stone. It's fool-proof! Let mother nature do the work. It's a shame. You have obviously inherited your father's cowardice. 

Russell:
Wait! Just tell me one thing Mugear. Did my father ever use that method on someone? 

Mugear:
No. At the last minute he had a crisis of morality and backed out. If only he'd gone through with it, he would have saved his wretched life. 

Russell:
You liar! You said that he left here alive. Wait! Mugear, get back here! 

Mugear:
I've taken care of everything. Now all we have to do is convince the real Elric brothers to put our plan into motion. 

Lust:
You make it sound so easy, but those boys are more complex than you think. 

Mugear:
I can handle a couple of children! Please, just put a little trust in me. We're close to the milk and honey. I can feel it. 

Lust:
It's your gamble. Go ahead. One way or the other, things will work out. 

Mugear:
I'm so sorry those impostors stole your identities. I was completely fooled by them. We all were, I'm ashamed to say. The last thing I want to do is add insult to injury. I'm sure you have work to do, but since you two really are such accomplished alchemists, there is a matter I'd like some help with. 

Ed:
Something with red water, by chance? 

Mugear:
Oh! So you have heard about it! That'll spare me having to explain. The truth of the matter is, I've done my research as well. And I happened to hear some rumors that you're very much interested in the Philosopher's Stone. 
What do you think, Edward? It's the product of crystallized red water. A prototype for the prize that you're after. 

Ed:
And so what do I do with that? 

Mugear:
First of all, together we can save Xenotime. Once we revitalize the gold mine, this town can get back on its feet again.

Ed:
Sounds like a good cause. So, where're the fakes? 

Mugear:
Taken care of. They're in the cellar. 
What'd you do that for? 

Ed:
We'll talk about the unfinished work later. First we execute those prisoners. We State Alchemists aren't the type to forgive liars. 

Mugear:
Oh! Then you mean you're accepting my request for assistance? 

Ed:
I told you, let's take care of those pathetic kids first. It's been a good while since I killed anyone. I kind of miss it. You wanna watch? 

Mugear:
Uh... No thanks. I'll let you take care of it. 

Fletcher:
Brother. 

Al:
Hi. 

Fletcher:
Al, what are you doing here? 

Ed:
I know who you guys are now. And I know that your father was actually Nash Tringham. What I don't know is why you'd so foolishly continue his work? 

Russell:
Because it was his dream. And as his son it was my duty to see it through. 

Ed:
So you honestly think this is what he wanted? You do realize the suffering that toxic water is causing the people of this town, don't you? Well, your father realized it. That's why he chose to abandon his research. And I can tell you right now, you're not gonna find happiness by chasing your father's failed dream. 
Live your own life and stop with all the acting, trying to be someone you're clearly not. Come on, Al. 

Mugear:
Not to worry. That was nothing compared to what those boys will fashion for me. 

Ed:
Which boys? You mean us? There's one more thing I've been wondering. Whatever happened to Nash Tringham? Just in case we have any questions to ask him. 

Mugear:
Nash Tringham? Oh! His research wasn't making progress anymore, so I had to let him go. 

Ed:
Huh. You don't strike me as the type of guy who lets someone who knows all of his secrets just walk away clean. 

Mugear:
I'm afraid I miss the implication. 

Ed:
I'm saying I don't answer to murderers, Mugear! You got that? 

Mugear:
Really? In that case, you're not getting out of here alive. There are plenty of other alchemists I can use. 

Al:
Another stone? 

Ed:
So he's got more than one of those things? 

Mugear:
It may not be as potent as that other one... ...but it'll do! 

Ed:
Is that all you've got? Bad question. 

Mugear:
Didn't think I had the stones? 

Ed:
Aw crap! 

Mugear:
You can't hide for long. 

Ed:
Yeah. I hate to say it, but he's right. We need an out. Fast! 

Mugear:
Not done yet. 

Ed:
Now's our chance, Al! Push! 

Russell:
Well Ed, I do hate to interrupt, but it looked like you needed the help. 

Ed:
Nah.

Russell:
We're not gonna be chasing our dad's dream anymore. You're right. It's time we live our own lives. 

Fletcher:
Russell! 

Al:
Brother! 

Ed:
A secret passage? Come on guys. Time for a chase. Russell, how much farther? 

Russell:
The spring where the red water comes out is just up ahead! We're almost there! 
Mugear! He blocked our path! 

Ed:
He forgot who he's dealing with. 

Mugear:
I'll never surrender the spring! As long as I have the red water, nothing can stop me! Least of all a diminutive State Alchemist and his copycat friends. 

Russell:
Ed! 

Al:
Brother! 

Ed:
Diminutive State Alchemist. Points for the big word, but you're still going down. 

Mugear:
Oh yeah? 

Ed:
You see now? Even with your stones, I'm on a whole other level. 

Mugear:
What's going on? 

Russell:
Ed! That's enough! Let's get out of here! 

Al:
Brother! 

Mugear:
I'll never surrender the spring. 

Russell:
Rushing water. The red water's overflowing. 

Ed:
That should hold it, for now. 

Al:
Won't it just come out somewhere else? 

Russell:
That shock probably weakened these support beams. We should leave! 

Ed:
Now then, if we can just find a drain. 
The trees, they're absorbing all the red water. 

Al:
I saw something like this back in the lab. 

Ed:
Huh. That's right, they were detoxifying the red water with plants. 

Fletcher:
See? It works. 

Ed:
They pulled through. Well done. 

Fletcher:
Thank you, trees. Sorry for this. 

Elisa:
Take these. They're from my uncle. 

Al:
Great. Thank you very much. 

Elisa
Stay out of trouble, you guys. 

Fletcher:
Yeah, and come back to see us! 

Al:
Sure. Of course we will. 

Ed:
So are you sure you'll be able to make it in this town? 

Fletcher:
Really? You promise? 

Elisa:
Can I give you one last hug? 

Russell:
Belsio wants us to go work for him. Our agricultural alchemy should be pretty useful around his farm. 

Elisa:
Okay, put me down! Put me down!

Russell:
So Ed, you'll still hunt for the Philosopher's Stone after this? 

Ed:
Yeah. 

Russell:
If you want, I can tell you exactly how we crystallized the red stone. 

Ed:
But why? 

Russell:
It's not so much out of atonement, but just because you deserve to know. 

Ed:
Thanks a lot Russell but no thanks. We'll find the real article on our own. You can count on that! 

Fletcher:
You'll see Ed! When you come to visit, this town will be even better! 

Elisa:
That's right, and by that time, I'll probably be taller than you! 

Ed:
Come on! Show a little respect for your elders, huh? 
I'm serious. Hey, why's that funny? 

Ed:
So long guys! 

Al:
Good-bye! 

Fletcher:
Good-bye! Good-bye! 

Elisa:
Don't forget to visit! Good-bye! 

Fletcher:
Bye! 

Ed:
Hey, a letter. 

Al:
It's for us? 

Ed:
Yeah. Let me read. What? 

Al:
What's it say? 

Ed:
Drop it! It's nothing okay! 

Al:
Oh? Let me see! Let me see! Let me see! 

Ed:
Stay away from me Al, I'm serious! 

Al:
If it's nothing then show it to me! 

Ed:
Hey! 

Al:
Got it! 

Ed:
Give it back! 

Russell:
Ed, thank you for all the help and words of wisdom you gave us. I'm sorry I was such a smart ass to you at first. But I'm trying to be a better older brother to Fletcher, and I'll try hard to follow your example, Ed. I guess you being a year older than me makes a big difference. Well, have a good trip. Russell. 

Ed:
Damn, I can't believe he's a year younger than me and already so much taller. Life is so unfair! 

Al:
You think those two are going to be all right? 

Ed:
Yeah, they'll be fine. Maybe we will, too.
