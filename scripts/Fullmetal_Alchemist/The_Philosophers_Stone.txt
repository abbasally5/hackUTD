  Hawkeye
It's so cruel.
If the devil really does interfere in this world, we've seen his work tonight. 

Mustang:
The devil's work, huh? 
We State Alchemists are human artillery they roll out if nothing else works. 
And when the military calls, it's our duty to respond regardless of how grotesque the scenario. 
To serve, we have to distance ourselves from emotional attachments. 
In that way, we're not so different from Tucker. 

Hawkeye:
With respect, that's the reasoning of an adult. 
But those children are still just... 

Al:
Brother? 
Brother, the Major... 

Mustang:
There's no use, kid. 
You can't go around trying to bring every living creature that dies on you back to life, Edward. 
It's not possible, and it's not healthy. 
Anyway, who'd you be helping by bringin' back a malformed chimera? 
It's an ugly world out there. 
And from here on out, it's only gonna get uglier on the path you've chosen.
Just be thankful it wasn't you and get on with your life. 

Ed:
Get on with my life? 

Mustang:
There's a reason you became a State Alchemist, right Ed? 
Can you really afford to get distracted by every little lost cause? 

Hughes:
Great. 
Well so much for making it home in time to kiss my little girl goodnight. 
Crime scene's over here. 

Mustang:
It's up to the Investigations Department now. 
Step aside. 

Hughes:
We got some kinda mess here. 
This work of that serial killer we've been tracking, Mustang? 

Mustang:
No, that guy only goes for women. 
Besides, this thing wasn't carved up... 

Hughes:
Right. 

Mustang:
I'd say it's almost as if that poor, pathetic creature were blown apart from the inside. 

Al:
Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. 
To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. 
That is alchemy's first Law of Equivalent Exchange. 
In those days, we really believed that to be the world's one, and only truth. 


Havoc:
Why so glum, Elric? 

Ed:
This job's a little more real than I bargained on. 
I think I just need something to take my mind off this whole mess. 
So, um... 
What's this assignment you've got for me? 

Havoc:
Here you go. 
Your orders are to go through and organize all of this stuff. 
You should familiarize yourself with all the results of Tucker's experiments. 

Ed:
So you want me to take over that maniac's research? 

Havoc:
True. 
He might have gone about it the wrong way, but some of his findings could be of great use to the military. 

Ed:
Why don't you let that whack job help you himself? 

Havoc:
He can't. 
He's dead. 
His guilt was so obvious that the higher-ups decided to forego the embarrassment of a trial and skipped straight to the execution. 

Ed:
So they covered it up! 
How could they? 

Havoc:
We don't question the wisdom of the military. 
See that's the first law of state alchemy, Ed. 

Al:
Interesting. 
It looks like Mr. Tucker was doing a lot of research on the Philosopher's Stone. 

Ed:
Well whoop-dee-flippin'-doo. 

Al:
How long are you planning to sulk like this, Brother? 
Do you have any idea the power of the Philosopher's Stone holds for alchemists? 
We could bypass all the laws of alchemy, including Equivalent Exchange! 
We could do the things we weren't able to do before, we could- 

Ed:
We can't do anything because it doesn't exist! 
It's just a bedtime story. 

Al:
But if a bona fide State Alchemist like Mr. Tucker was doing research on it, it must...

Ed:
Who gives a damn about his research! 
The man was a lunatic, or have you forgotten about Nina? 

Mustang:
It's a no-go, kid. 

Ed:
But why not? 
What if that serial killer you guys have been chasing really did kill Nina? 
I could help you find him! 

Mustang:
And the job that you were ordered to do? 
Have you finished analyzing Tucker's research? 

Ed:
I couldn't do that. 
In that case, I'll investigate on my own! 

Mustang:
Right. 
Investigate on your own, and leave that here. 

Ed:
Yeah, I intended to. 

Al:
Brother? 
Hold on, Ed. 
You're not the only one who's upset. 
We couldn't do anything for Nina. 
But we're alchemists, not police. 
We can't catch a killer! 
What we can do is put our talents to better use doing research, so that if another girl like Nina ever comes along, we'll know how to save... her. 

Scar:
It's you. 

Ed:
You were outside the library. 

Scar:
Tell me, if you've got access to the Library in Central, then that must make you a State Alchemist. 

Ed:
Well, I was, yeah. 
But that's all behind me now. 

Scar:
Really? 
You're better off. 
Because if you were still a State Alchemist, this arm would destroy you. 

Winry:
I can't wait to see Ed and Al's faces! 
They'd never expect me to travel all the way here just to congratulate them. 
Surprise. 

Al:
Have you ever seen it? 
What can you tell me about it? 

Hawkeye:
Not too much. 
I'm afraid I've never heard anything substantial about the Philosopher's Stone. 
Well, about it actually existing, anyway. 
As far as I know, it's just a legend. 

Al:
I see. 
But I can say, if you know what's best for you, you'll find another hobby to pursue. 
It's been said that bad things have a way of happening to those who seek the Philosopher's Stone. 

Bradley:
Did someone say something about the Stone? 

Al:
Who is this guy? 

Hawkeye:
Are you kidding?! 
This ''guy'' is... 

Bradley:
So you'd like to get your hands on the Stone, is that right, son? 

Al:
Yes, sir. 

Bradley:
And why do you want it? 

Al:
For human tra..., I mean, I need it to recover something important that my brother lost. 

Bradley:
Is that so? 
This brother of yours must be very special to you. 
It's some undertaking. 
The crusade you're embarking on is as old as alchemy itself. 
Personally, I try to stay above it, but from time to time, you'll hear about some alchemist who's succeeded in forging a Stone. 
Such rumors naturally have a way of congregating around military personnel. 
So there should be plenty of records on the subject down at the National Library. 

Al:
Is that true? 

Bradley:
Most assuredly. 
Of course, only State Alchemists have access to them. 

Al:
So, what you're saying is, any State Alchemist could find out more about this thing? 
Uh, excuse me. 

Hawkeye:
With all due respect sir, why would you encourage him to chase a futile pursuit like that? 

Bradley:
I think it's a good thing for youngsters to have dreams to follow. 
Don't you agree with me, Second Lieutenant? 

Hawkeye:
Yes, sir. 

Hughes:
You see! 
I'm right! 
You think she's just too cute, don't you? 

Man:
Uh, yeah, that's it. 
You got me. 

Hughes:
What do you think? 
I know, you're thinking she takes after me, right? 
Well, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree! 

Ed:
I've seen that same picture a dozen times! 

Hughes:
Now, there's no need for that attitude is there? 
Not when I've shared classified files on the serial killer with you. 

Ed:
Yeah, and you owe me for the train and delivering your baby. 
So what else you got? 

Hughes:
Touche, touche. 
Well, anyway, the investigation's at a standstill. 
We've got no clues and no witnesses to go on. 
The bodies are all sliced and diced, but none of us can figure out how he does it in such a short time. 

Ed:
Maybe he killed them somewhere else and moved the bodies later? 
How long between the time of death and when they were found? 

Hughes:
We've come a long way, but even with modern science we can't figure that. 
But between us and the police we must have checked the trunks of every single... car entering and exiting the city. 

Ed:
There must be some sort of a blind spot you're missing here. 
A car that can hide bodies or a... 

Hughes:
Or maybe it's all been the work of an alchemist. 

Ed:
Alchemists are not cold-blooded murderers! 

Man:
Excuse me, sir. 
Are you Edward Elric? 

Ed:
Who's asking? 

Man:
There's a visitor here to see you. 
Waiting out front. 

Ed:
A visitor? 

Woman:
Hey. 

Man:
If it isn't our prettiest delivery girl. 

Woman:
Behave yourself. 
So, they held the Certification Exams recently, right? 

Man:
Yes ma'am. 
And did you hear it? 
This time, some twelve year-old alchemist actually made the cut if you can believe it. 
All he has to do is this. 
And just like that, he can transmute. 

Woman:
Very impressive, indeed. 

Man:
Right there. 
He's the short one in the red coat. 
Look at him. 
He's just a little kid. 
By the way, I want you to be extra careful out there with that freak on the loose. 
They say he goes for the young pretty ones like you. 

Woman:
How sweet. 
It's nice to hear you think I'm pretty. 

Man:
Well, yeah. 

Woman:
I sure hope they catch this creep soon. 

Man:
You and me both. 

Woman:
So, working around here, you must get all the inside scoop on this case, right? 

Winry:
Isn't that just like Ed to keep me waiting forever. 
That's one of those new refrigerated trucks! 
I've read all about these, but I've never seen one up close before. 
So cool! 
I'd sure love to take it apart! 

Woman:
I'm afraid that'd make it a bit hard to drive. 

Winry:
Oh, I'm sorry. 
Is this your truck? 

Woman:
Sure is. 
I use it to make deliveries. 

Winry:
It really is amazing. 

Woman:
Would you like to take a look inside? 

Winry:
Really?! 
Can I?! 
Thank you so much!

Man:
That's odd. 
I told her to wait right here. 
Wonder where she could've wandered off to. 
What's up, Mr. Elric? 

Ed:
Is this... 
Winry? 
Was there a car stopped here when you left her? 

Man:
Well yeah. 
There's always refrigerated trucks parked here when they drop off food for the mess hall. 

Ed:
Refrigerated trucks... 
A car that can hide bodies... 
Oh no! 

Man:
Where are you going, Mr. Elric? 

Ed:
Hey, Miss, are you all right? 
Have you seen others like you in here? 

Woman:
Over there. 
A young girl. 

Ed:
Okay. 
I'll just go grab her and we can get the hell out of this place. 
Don't worry ma'am you're in safe hands now... 

Woman:
My hero awakes. 

Ed:
Why you! 

Barry:
Word on the playground is you can transmute without a circle, just using your hands. 
So to be safe... 
Please let me introduce myself. 
My name is Barry and this here is my butcher shop. 

Ed:
You're a man! 

Barry: 
Guilty as charged. 
And to reward you for making it this far we have a special guest. 

Ed:
Let her go. 

Barry: 
Since she enjoys taking things apart, I thought I'd do the same to her. 
If you watch us carefully, you just might get to see what makes her tick. 

Ed:
You sick-
Why are you doing this? 

Barry: 
Why? 
Huh... 
What a strange little question that is. 
I suppose it's because I enjoy it. 
The first person I killed was my wife. 
She was nagging me about something and then, without meaning to, I chopped her to pieces. 
But when I saw how finely I could slice her, I wanted more. 
More people to cut up, to reduce to their most basic building blocks. 
And I wanted everyone to see. 

Ed:
How can a person murder someone for such a ridiculous reason? 

Barry: 
Because they can! 
Given the slightest provocation, anybody can do it. 

Ed:
Stay back! 

Barry: 
Men have morals, but send them to war and they have no problem slaying each other in the most brutal fashions. 
Why do you think that is? 

Ed:
I have no idea. 

Barry: 
'Cause, deep down inside we all want to kill. 
Most just need the go-ahead from their society, like the State Alchemists I saw in a village, slaughtering helpless people. 
Splat. 
Big fountains of blood. 

Ed:
It's not true. 
No! 

Barry: 
You little! 

Ed:
Damn it! 

Al:
Don't! 
It'll take more than that to kill me, Brother. 

Man:
Hey! 
They're all in here! 
Don't move! 

Ed:
Al... I... 

Al:
Brother, are you hurt? 

Ed:
I thought he was going to kill me. 
I honestly thought I was going to die. 
I was so scared. 
So scared. 

Al:
Major Hughes was the one who realized that trucks from this particular shop had bypassed numerous inspection points. 
Thanks to him, we managed to get there in time. 
Afterwards, the case of Barry the Chopper became infamous, and it would be spoken of as Ed's first distinguished achievement. 
But he would remember it differently. 

Al:
Brother, it turns out the Philosopher's Stone may very well be real. 
But all the clues we need to find it are off limits to everyone except for State Alchemists. 
Since I no longer have a mortal shell, I can't feel the terror you felt, thinking you were going to die. 
I'm sure it must have been painful, and lonely. 
I want my body back, brother. 
I want to be able to feel what you felt. 
To feel human again. 
If we find the Philosopher's Stone, I can have that. 
And we can repair what we've broken. 

Ed:
When I was certain that he was going to kill me, my mind went blank, and I didn't have any hope anymore. 
The only thing I could do was scream my lungs out. 
I felt so helpless. 
I couldn't even bring myself to believe someone might save me. 
Then you showed up, Al. 
And I realized if we don't take care of each other, no one else will. 
So I'll do anything in my power to get our bodies back, even if it means being the military's lapdog. 
And we'll just have to hope our powers are good enough to help us rise above our own limits. 
'Cause we're not gods. 
We're humans, tiny, insignificant humans who couldn't even save a little girl. 

Mustang:
On one condition you say? 

Ed:
I'll obey all your orders, sir. 
But as long as I serve, I'd like to receive all information on the Philosopher's Stone. 
And then whenever I've finished all my other duties, you have to permit me to search for it. 

Mustang:
People will question your motives. 
You realize what'll happen if the state learns about your human transmutation. 
Al will be hauled off to some lab as a precious sample. 
Well, I can keep that in my back pocket to make sure you behave. 
Fine. 
But you'll report to me everything you uncover about the Philosopher's Stone. 
Oh, and I almost forgot. 
You've been issued your official state title by the Fuhrer. 
It's quite ironic actually, he's got a good sense of humor. 

Ed:
We give the name, 'Fullmetal' to thee Edward Elric, 

Ed and Bradley:
In the name of Fuhrer King Bradley. 

Ed:
Fullmetal? 

Mustang:
Along with the pocket watch, everyone of us is assigned a symbolic second name, depending on your talents. 
And yours is Fullmetal. 
The Fullmetal Alchemist. 

Ed:
Sounds heavy. 
Tell 'em I like the feel of it. 
I won't let it weigh me down. 

Winry:
To celebrate, you're going to buy me all kinds of neat things I can't get back home, right! 

Ed:
I think you've got it backwards there. 

Winry:
I forget.
Who fixed up your arm? 

Al:
I heard that serial killer had nothing to do with Nina's death. 
Is that true, brother? 

Ed:
Yeah, it didn't fit his pattern, and he had an alibi that night. 

Al:
So if he didn't kill Nina, who did? 


Ed:
Fullmetal Alchemist. 

Al:
Episode Nine. 
Be Thou For The People. 

Ed:
From the very beginning, I knew what it would mean to become a State Alchemist. 
I only hope I made the right choice, Al.
