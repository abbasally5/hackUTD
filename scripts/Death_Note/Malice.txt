  --------- SPK HQ ---------

GEVANNI： Near, it’s all taken care of.
I did exactly as you asked.

NEAR： Good.


--------- TAKADA & MIKAMI ---------

TAKADA： T, that is all I have to tell you today.
We’ll talk soon.

MIKAMI： Very well.
I understand.
I also have a message for you.

TAKADA： Yes, what is it?

MIKAMI： “I have confirmed it.”

TAKADA： Huh?!


--------- NPA TASK FORCE HQ ---------

MATSUDA： You got a text?
Wow, it says she wants to see you!
Man, I’m so jealous, huh!

( LIGHT： I’ve done it!
That’s the sign of confirmation from Mikami.
Now all I have to do is wait for Near to request the meeting face to face.
Game over, Near.
I win.
I knew what your move would be from the very beginning. )


--------- ＳＰＫ HQ --------

GEVANNI： Sir, this is Gevanni.
I’ve been checking the notebook regularly as you ordered.
For the past three days, he’s continued filling out one page every night after midnight as he usually does.
The victims do match up.
And there has been no change in Mikami’s behavior otherwise.

NEAR： I understand.
Well, then, let’s begin.


--------- NPA TASK FORCE HQ ---------

MATSUDA： Oh, it’s Near.

( LIGHT： He called. )


NEAR： L.

LIGHT： Yes, this is L.
What is it, Near?

NEAR： I wanna meet you.

LIGHT： What?

NEAR： There is something I must show you pertaining to the Kira case.

LIGHT： But, don’t you suspect me of being Kira?
Do you really think it’s wise to reveal your face to me?

NEAR： That’s true.
I cannot show you unless I reveal my face.
Furthermore, the very act of showing my face will prove something.
And that will bring this case to a close.


EVERYONE： Huh?!


LIGHT： All right, fine.
As far as I’m concerned, the sooner you realize you are wrong about me, the better.


( AIZAWA： The time has finally come for Near to prove that Light is Kira.
But, on the other hand, if that’s true, this would be a chance for Light to kill Near.
It all comes down to this. )


NEAR： I’d like to lay out some ground rules for the meeting.

LIGHT： We are willing to go along with whatever you want.

NEAR： First, I wanna have all the investigators from both teams be present.
In other words, everyone who is chasing after Kira should be gathered together to take part in the meeting.

LIGHT： I understand.
That’s not a problem.

NEAR： As I mentioned before, there are a total of four members in the SPK, that’s including myself.
All of us would be there.
Besides our team, we’ll also bring along Mr. Mogi, who’s currently staying with us.
As for Misa Amane, she would be released right before we meet.
She’ll not be told where we are going.
You can come and meet us once you confirm that she’s been safely released.
Is it acceptable?


MATSUDA： What do we do?

IDE： Hmmm.


LIGHT： OK, Near, I understand.
I have a team of five investigators including myself.
Of course, Mogi is with you at the moment, so aside from me, there would be only three people.

NEAR： Very well, that’s fine.
Now, as for our meeting place ….
“Daikoku Wharf.”
There’s a warehouse on the outskirts of the Southeast side and it’s been abandoned for sometime.
It’s known as “the Yellow Box.”
I’ve already taken a liberty of purchasing it.
If this arrangement is fine with you, then we’ll use it.


( NEAR： How about it, Light Yagami?
With a location like this, you can do what you are planning to do. )


NEAR： One more thing.
This meeting cannot take place unless I have your word that someone will bring the notebook.

LIGHT： Wait, why the notebook?

NEAR： It’s quite simple.
If your entire team leaves HQ to meet me, then there’ll be no one left behind to guard the notebook.
I can promise you this; I will make no attempt to steal it.
In fact, I won’t even try to touch it.
As long as Mr. Aizawa can confirm that is the genuine notebook, I’m willing to place my faith in you and accept his word.

AIZAWA： Huh, all right.

NEAR： However, I do insist that someone other than L hold on to it.
My reasons for making that request should be fairly obvious to you.

LIGHT： Right, I understand.
But I’ll be the one who decides who’ll hold on to it.
Does that sound fair?

NEAR： Yes, of course.
Then, all that’s left arranges the time and date.


( LIGHT： Right.
The question is “what time?” )


( NEAR： Mikami makes his judgments after midnight.
He most likely receives a notice in the morning of which people to kill next.
If we take his movements into consideration, …. )


NEAR： Say, three days from now; on the 28th, at 1 pm.


( LIGHT： 1 o’clock, huh?
That’s the exact time I expected him to pick.
Near is obviously aware of Mikami’s movements. )


LIGHT： That’s fine by me.
The time doesn’t really concern us.

NEAR： Well then, 1 o’clock, 3 days from now.

LIGHT： Sure.

- disconnected –


( LIGHT： Near …. )


( NEAR： Light Yagami …. )


( LIGHT & NEAR： I know exactly what your plan is!!
I’m going to win!! )


--------- HOTEL ---------

LIGHT： Kiyomi, I’m sorry, but I’m a little busier than usual today.

TAKADA： Oh, really?
Does that mean you can’t stay until morning?

LIGHT： Yeah, I’m sorry.
The police are gonna have their hands full for the next two or three days.

TAKADA： That’s a shame.
Hm?

- Light passed a note about the location -

( LIGHT： I’ve already given orders to both Mikami and Takada about what to do.
This will be the final order to kill Near. )


--------- IN FRONT OF ＮＨＮ ---------

LIDNER： Quick!
This way.
Are you all right?

TAKADA： Yes.


MAN： Getting away! After them!


LIDNER： We need to get inside NHN now.

MAN： Don’t do it!!
Take a look around.
It’s not safer in here, not even inside.

( LIDNER： Mello! )

MELLO： It’s best if you get away from here right now!
Miss Takada, get on!
NOW!!

LIDNER： It’s OK, you’ll be safe with him.
Please, you have to go.

TAKADA： Right.

- Mello and Takada left –

LIDNER： Team A and Team B, stay on that bike’s tail and don’t lose sight of them.
As for the rest of you, I need you to find that assailant.


--------- CHASING TAKADA ---------

MAN： All right, we’ve confirmed Miss Takada’s safety.
Let’s get her onto the car No. 7.


MAN： Ah, what the hell?!

MAN： No, he’s taking her arm!

MAN： Damn it!

MAN： Stop you idiot!
You can’t do that!
What if it ends up hitting her?!


TAKADA： What are you doing?!


--------- NPA TASK FORCE HQ ---------

TV News： One of the attackers was heavily-armed.
As of this moment, both Miss Takada’s escort team and the police are hot on the tail of the suspects.


MATSUDA： Oh man, this is really bad.

IDE： Is it Near again?

( LIGHT： Near, he promised that we’d meet in 3 days time.
What’s the meaning of making a move like this now?!
It doesn’t make sense!
No, this isn’t Near’s style.
It’s more like …. )

- blip –

MATSUDA： It’s Near.


--------- CORNERED MATT ---------

( MATT： So, those cars got ahead of me, huh?
How many damn bodyguards does one woman need, anyway? )

MATT： Hey, c’mon!
Give me a break.
Since when were the Japanese allowed to carry around such big guns?
You got me.
I’m part of this whole kidnapping incident.
That means you’ll have a lot of questions to ask.
You won’t shoot ….

- bang! bang! bang! bang! bang! bang … !!! -

MAN： What an idiot.
You probably wouldn’t have told us anything, anyway.
And, death is the only way to pay for crimes against Kira.


--------- MELLO ON TRUCK ---------

( TAKADA： This man, he is the person that Light warned me to be extra careful of; Mello.
Mihael Keehl. )


--------- MELLO & TAKADA ---------

- Mello put off his helmet -

MELLO： Take off everything you are wearing and put it all in that box.

MELLO： Hurry up!
You can use this blanket.


--------- NPA TASK FORCE HQ ---------

NEAR： L, I am not the one who kidnapped Takada.

LIGHT： Is that so?
Then it has to be … Mello.

NEAR： Yes, that’s right.
I have to be honest with you on this.
We had one of our members escorting Takada and they confirmed it.
Mello was the one who abducted her.
I apologize for letting this happen while one of us was guarding her.

LIGHT： Near, isn’t there any way for you to contact Mello?

NEAR： No, I’m afraid that would be impossible.
While I do have a method for getting in touch with him, there’s no way he’d respond in the current situation.

( LIGHT： Hmmm. )


--------- MELLO & TAKADA ---------

TAKADA： Before I take off the rest, could I please have the blanket so I can wrap it around me?

MELLO： Whatever you want.

- Takada took a piece of death note she was hiding under her bra -


--------- NPA TASK FORCE HQ ---------

TV News： Our latest report is that the escort team was forced to shoot one of the perpetrators.
They are also still making efforts to track Miss Takada’s whereabouts.


IDE： Were you able to get a hold of her?

LIGHT： Not yet.
Takada’s phone has been turned off.
Mello must have confiscated it.

( LIGHT： Damn it.
I need to get in touch with Takada.
With no way of getting a hold of her, all I can do is wait. )


--------- MELLO ON TRUCK ---------

( MELLO： This is the only thing that can be done.
If I don’t do it …. )

TV News： As for the suspect who was gun downed earlier, we’re still unable to identify him.
The police are tracking the remaining suspects who are currently ….

( MELLO： Matt.
I never thought you’d be killed.
I’m sorry. )


--------- TAKADA ---------

- Takada locked-in alone wrote down a name on the piece –


--------- NPA TASK FORCE HQ ---------

- Light’s cell rings –

IDE： Light’s cell phone.

MATSUDA： Could it be her?

LIGHT： Quiet everyone.


- blip -

LIGHT： Hello?

TAKADA： Light …, I ….

LIGHT： Miss Takada?
Listen to me.
Are you all right?


( LIGHT： The only reason she’d be able to call me like this without getting caught is if she had an opportunity to get away from Mello, or …. )


TAKADA： Light, Light, please save me!

LIGHT： It’s all right.
Calm down and answer my questions, OK?

TAKADA： Oh, OK.

LIGHT： First, your location; do you know where you are?

TAKADA： No, no, I don’t know where I am.
I was put into a truck that was locked from the outside.
But we were on a freeway and I caught a glimpse of the sign that said we were heading to Nagano.
Right now, I think we’ve parked inside of the building somewhere.

LIGHT： Miss Takada, you are Kira’s spokesperson.
Do you remember the conversation we had when I told you that there might be people who would try to hurt you because of that?

TAKADA： Y-yes, I remember.

LIGHT： We talked about what you should do if a situation like this ever arose.
Do you remember that?

TAKADA： I remember.
I did what you told me to, Light.
I did it!


( LIGHT： Yes!! )


TAKADA： I didn’t struggle even when he stripped me naked.
I did exactly as you said： I made survival my first priority, and, and I did it.
Please, Light, I did everything that you told me to.
Come quickly, save me!

LIGHT： Miss Takada.
You remember what I told you to do after that, don’t you?


( TAKADA： I have to do as many killings as possible while I still can. )


TAKADA： I, I know!
But, but, Light!

LIGHT： Can you do it?

TAKADA： … I can do it.

- blip –


LIGHT： Aizawa, Ide, let’s get going.
Matsuda, you stay here and take care of headquarters.

MATSUDA： You got it.


--------- MIKAMI AT OFFICE ---------

TAKADA： It’s me.
Send me as many names of people to punish as you can.
Here’s my e-mail address.

MIKAMI： Yes, right, I understand.

- blip –

( MIKAMI： If Takada is calling me like this, it must mean that she’s been able to kill her kidnappers.
In which case, the only certain is that she’s in a situation where she can’t move. )


MIKAMI： Nakajima, I’m going to the scene of the crime for this case.

NAKAJIMA： OK.


--------- CAR ---------

LIGHT： All right, I got the location by tracing the call.
Head to Karuizawa by freeway.

AIZAWA： Karuizawa, huh.
Damn, it’ll take at least 30 minutes to get there.

LIGHT： Well, hurry!
This is Mello we are talking about.
Who knows what he’ll do?

AIZAWA： Got it.

( LIGHT： I don’t believe this; Aizawa and Ide are just too stupid.
They jumped the gun and got on the front seats without even thinking.
This is just too easy. )

- Light wrote a name on a hidden piece –




LIDNER： Huh, no, Mello.


AIZAWA： What the hell is this?!


( LIGHT： Kiyomi Takada, suicide.
January 26, 2013, 2：32 pm.
Burns to death by setting fire to everything around her, including everything she wrote on. )
