  --------- SECOND HOME IN MOUNTAIN ---------

MOTHER： I think we should do this everyday.
The sun will do you good.

( YAGAMI： What in the world am I supposed to do now? )


--------- LIGHT’S HOTEL IN LA ---------

SHIDOH： Haai Ryuk.

RYUK： Shidoh!
What, what are you doing here?


--------- RYUK RUNNING AWAY FROM THE HOTEL ---------

RYUK： Hey!
Quit following me!

SHIDOH： I want my notebook.

( RYUK： Damn!
Guess I shouldn’t be surprised. )

RYUK： Too bad, things got a little complicated recently.
I have no idea where it is.

SHIDOH： Why am I not surprised?

RYUK： Look!
I told you! Stop following me!

SHIDOH： Then give me back my notebook.

RYUK： I don’t know where it is!
If you want it back, you’re gonna have to look for it yourself!


--------- NPA’S HOTEL IN LA ---------

AIZAWA： Wammy’s House isn’t exactly a normal orphanage.
It’s like a school for gifted children, but here is the crazy part; its real purpose is to groom these kids so that one of them could become the next L.

( LIGHT： L’s successor? )

AIZAWA： Apparently the one most likely to succeed L is this kid named Near.

( LIGHT： “Near” is that N? )

MATSUDA： Also, we found some leads on Mello; the one N mentioned.
He’s smart too but he always came second to Near.

( LIGHT： So Near was meant to be L’s successor.
There is no mistake, he has to be N.
He is the one commanding the SPK.
As for Mello, he would have wanted to become L’s successor, but he probably lost out to Near.
That gives him a motive for wanting to get his hands on the notebook first.
It all adds up perfectly.
This guy is definitely the same Mello that N told us about. )

AIZAWA： These are sketches of both of them.
We couldn’t find any photographs.

( LIGHT： L’s successors.
It looks like I’m still fighting L after all this time. )


--------- LIGHT’S HOTEL IN LA ---------

( LIGHT： First things first.
I have to find out where Mello and his mafia associates are hiding themselves.
I already had Misa check a list of known mafia syndicates using her Shinigami eyes. )


MISA： Look!
I found him!
I can’t see his life-span.
He is No. 105.
They have him listed as Jack Neylon.
But his real name is Kal Snyder.
He’s got the notebook.


( LIGHT： After that, it was a simple matter of using the death note to make Snyder send a letter to me with a location of the gang’s hideout.
It should be arriving soon. )


MISA： Hi Light!
Great news.
The letter arrived!

( LIGHT： He is in LA!
I did it!
I outmaneuvered both Near and Mello.
Guess it’s no surprise.
As long as I have the notebook and Misa’s eyes, I’m unstoppable. )

MISA： So Light, I guess this means I was helpful to you again, doesn’t it?

LIGHT： Yeah, I love you, Misa.


( SHIDOH： Los An …. )


--------- MELLO’S DEN ---------

MELLO： The next step is for me to figure out just how much I can control people with this thing.

( SHIDOH： Oh, they’re gonna have to be able to see me before I can even talk to them!
What a drag.
Looks like Snyder is the owner right now.
Guess I’ll have to make him touch the notebook first.
Oh well …. )

SHIDOH： Tag. You're it.


MELLO： Ya …, the notebook just flew!

LOS： Ha!
It’s a notebook that kills people.
Hell, nothing surprises me anymore.

JACK： AAAAhh!
Boss!
Who is this?!
The guy in the freaky costume!
Who the hell is he?!
Who brought him in?!

SHIDOH： I came here on my own.
I’m actually a Shinigami.

JACK： A Shinigami?!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

SHIDOH： If you don’t wanna everyone to think you’re crazy, pass the notebook around so they can see me, too.

JACK： He says you can see him if you touch the notebook!
Please everyone, touch it!
I swear I’m not crazy!

LOS： Fine.
Whatever.
C’mon guys.
Touch the notebook.

EVERYONE： Last time I touched that …!
Should I kill him?!

- bang bang bang bang …! –

SHIDOH： Nice try.
You humans can’t kill a Shinigami.

LOS： Jack’s right.
That ain’t no costume.
That’s a real live Shinigami.
So now, what will we do?


--------- LIGHT’S HOTEL IN LA ---------

LIGHT： Ryuk, as of now, I’m going to forfeit ownership of this notebook.
All I ask is that you agree to follow whichever person I give it to.

RYUK： What?!
You’re giving up ownership again?!

MISA： But wait!
Won’t you lose all your memories if you do that?!

LIGHT： Misa, lend me your notebook.
I’ll keep it on me like this.
That way, even if I forfeit ownership of my notebook, I won’t lose my memory.
I’ll give you as many pages as you need.
From this moment on, you are going to be Kira.
Can you do that?

MISA： Of course, but I don’t get why you are doing this.

LIGHT： I’ll explain everything to you right now.
I won’t forgive any mistakes.


--------- MELLO’S DEN ---------

SHIDOH： Chocolate is so good!

LOS： Hey!
What about that stuff you told us?!
Is it true?!
“If the person using the note fails to consecutively write names of people to be killed within 13 days of each other, then the user will die.”
“If you make this notebook unusable by tearing it up or burning it, all the humans who’ve touched the note till then will die.”
Are you saying those two rules are made-up?!

SHIDOH： Oh yeah.
Those rules are definitely fake.
My guess is some Shinigami wrote those down as a joke before giving the notebook to a human.


( MELLO： As for the 13-day rule, we can test it out by using one of our people.
But the real question is; is this the notebook that was used by Kira?
And if so, was he aware that these two rules were false?
If he did know, he could have used these rules to his advantage.
In particular, the 13-day rule would have allowed him to prove his innocence in only 13 days. )


MELLO： Shidoh!
Go keep watch outside!
It’ll be very convenient for us that you can’t be seen by humans!
Go outside and keep watch!
Got it?!


( SHIDOH： Oh, what’s with this guy?
He is [a/ ] human, but he is scary. )


--------- SECOND HOME IN MOUNTAIN? ---------
- phone rings -
YAGAMI： Yagami speaking.

KIRA： This is Kira.


--------- NAP IN LA BUGGING CONVERSATION OF YAGAMI AND KIRA ---------

MATSUDA： What did he say?!

IDE： Kira?!


<Conversation between Yagami and Kira>

KIRA： I understand that the notebook that was in your possession has fallen into criminal hands.

YAGAMI： Can, can you prove that you are the real Kira?

KIRA： Prove it?
Now that there’re others using a notebook, there’s no point in predicting killings in order to identify myself.
They could just as easily kill the same targets.
But don’t worry.
I’ve already taken this into account.
I’ve sent you something that would clearly prove to you that I am Kira; it’s my own notebook.

YAGAMI： What, what do you mean?

KIRA： The notebook I’ve sent you gives me the power to know a person’s name by seeing only their face.
And you will be able to gain that same power.
Do you understand?


- MISA： Please, stay, calm, and, listen, careful-ly.


KIRA： I’ve gathered information from the FBI and other sources.
On November 10th at exactly 11:59 pm, arrangements have been made so that all known associates of the mafia will die.
It’s already been written in my notebook so it’s impossible for me to make any changes.
You will not be able to prevent these deaths.
I already know their location.
I will hand over that information along with the notebook.
So remember, November 10th, 11:59 pm.
That’s when it all happens.
That moment is your best and only chance to get the notebook back.
It’s up to you.

- blip-


--------- NPA’S HOTEL IN LA ---------

LIGHT： What should we do?
If the mafia members are going to die on the day Kira specified, it would be a chance to get the notebook back.
I don’t like the idea following Kira’s plan but it’s our best option.

RYUK： Exactly!

IDE： But still, knowing the time of deaths of these guys isn’t going to be enough for us to make our move.

MATSUDA： Ide, I think we both know what needs to be done.
We get the Shinigami to follow us and, eh, and then we do the deal for the eyes and make sure they’re all dead, right?

YAGAMI： I will make the deal for the eyes.

MATSUDA： No way, chief!
Let me be the one to do it!

YAGAMI： I was responsible for handing over the notebook in the first place.
Since [that] moment, I’ve been unable to live with what I’ve done.
I’ve even thought of killing myself.
I’ll use the notebook to kill any criminals who try to stop this, and then, after 13 days, I’ll die as well.

( LIGHT： If Dad writes a name in the notebook, then, when the time comes …. )


--------- OUTSIDE MELLO’S DEN ---------

- LIGHT： Report.
Is everybody ready to move in?

EVERYONE： Roger.

- LIGHT： All right.
Deputy director, make the eye deal with the Shinigami.

YAGAMI： All right, Ryuk, I’m ready.

RYUK： Sure thing, boss.


- LIGHT： Once you are finished, I want you to take a look at the photographs of the criminals I gave you.
Can you see their names and life-spans?

YAGAMI： Yes, I can.

- LIGHT： Their names should disappear soon.
That’s your cue.

- click! -

YAGAMI： EVERYONE! MOVE IN!


--------- MELLO’S DEN ---------

( MELLO： So, Kira is involved after all.
I didn’t think he would go this far.
My plan was supposed to be perfect.
Damn!
What the hell is Shidoh doing?! )


- RYUK： Relax, Shidoh.
Just shut up and watch, all right?
All you have to do is sit here and do nothing.
If you can do that, you’ll get your notebook back.


MELLO： Roy! Skyer!
The notebook’s under the Los’s body!
Bring it to the surveillance room upstairs!


ROY： Don’t move!

- bang! bang! –


YAGAMI： L, we’ve apprehended two of the criminals.
We’ve also been able to secure the notebook.

MATSUDA： We’ll begin withdrawing now!

- LIGHT： Not yet.
Keep going.

EVERYONE： Huh?!

- LIGHT： We still haven’t found anyone who resembles our picture of Mello.
That means he must be hiding somewhere in the building.
We’ve come this far.
Let’s finish this.
Do a thorough search.


- wham! –

IDE： What was that?!

AIZAWA： An explosion?!

MELLO： Don’t move!
I’ve already blown up the two entrances to this place.
This would be your only warning.
The next explosion will take out the entire building as well as all you men inside.
So you’d better do as I say.


- ( LIGHT： It’s Mello …. )


MELLO： Ha ha ….

YAGAMI： Hm?!

MELLO： Yagami again, ha?
Maybe I should’ve killed you when I had the chance.
History repeats itself, but I never dreamed in a million years that I’d be bargaining for the notebook with you again.

YAGAMI： M-I-H-A-E-L, K-E-E-H-L.
Your real name.
It’s Mihael Keehl.

( MELLO： WHAT THE HELL?!
How did he … ?! )


- ( LIGHT： I did it! )


YAGAMI： It’s over Mello.
It’s time to turn yourself in.
If you give up, I won’t kill you.
You have my word on that.


- ( LIGHT： What are you doing?!
Don’t be stupid!
Write his name down and kill him NOW!! )


YAGAMI： You know how this works.
I write your name, and you will die.
Let go of that trigger and put your hands in the air!

MELLO： … hmm, Yagami,

YAGAMI： DON’T MOVE!!
I’ve written your first name!
And it will only take me a second to write your surname!


- ( LIGHT： You idiot!
Just write it!
KILL HIM!! )


MELLO： I’m truly sorry.
For what it’s worth, I give you my word that I never wanted to kill you.

YAGAMI： Hm?

MELLO： But tell me, Yagami.
You’ve never killed someone before, have you?

- bang bang bang … !! –


- LIGHT： Gun fire?!

YAGAMI： … Aarrrgghh ….

AIZAWA： What was that?!

MELLO： Jose!
The notebook!

JOSE： Damn!
Oh, this guy!
He won’t let go of the thing!
Son of a bitch!

MATSUDA： Deputy director!

AIZAWA： It’s all over, Mello!
Put your hands up and surrender!

- wham! –


AIZAWA： Matsuda!
Are you all right?!

MATSUDA： No, I don’t think so.

AIZAWA： I’m sure you live.

IDE： L!
I don’t see any sign of Mello!

- ( LIGHT： Damn it!
After all that, he got away?!
That’s why you should have just killed him! )


--------- HOSPITAL ---------

LIGHT： Come on!
Please, Dad!
You can’t die on me like this!

YAGAMI： … Light ….

LIGHT： Yeah, Dad.

YAGAMI： Eh …, thank … goodness ….

LIGHT： You’ll be fine.
It’s OK.

YAGAMI： Light … I still have them ….
I still have the Shinigami eyes ….
According to that Shinigami Ryuk, I can’t see the life-span of someone who owns a notebook ….
But I can see the numbers above your head ….
… Light …, you really aren’t Kira ….
I’m so glad ….
My son.

MATSUDA： Don’t tell me you’re still worried about that, chief.
Of course he’s not Kira.

LIGHT： C’mon, you shouldn’t talk so much, Dad.

( LIGHT： That’s important.
But I’ve got bigger things to do with right now.
I’ve got to get him to write Mello’s name in the notebook. )

YAGAMI： I … I’m so sorry … but, in the end, I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t bring myself to kill him ….

( LIGHT： I can’t just come out and say “it’s not too late!”
No, wait, maybe I can.
It all depends on how I do it.
No one would think it’s weird if I get upset and panic. )

LIGHT： C’mon!
Dad!
Write his name!
You can’t let him beat you like this!
Write his name down!
With your last bit of strength, do you wanna die in vain?!
Da, Dad!
No!

YAGAMI： … Ligh … t ….

- bleep –

DOCTOR： I’m sorry for your loss.

LIGHT： Dad, wake up!
C’mon, Daddy!
Don’t you die on me, you idio … !
DAaaaaaahhh!


--------- OUTSIDE ---------

LIGHT： You are the Shinigami who came here to take back this notebook, aren’t you?

SHIDOH： Yeees.

LIGHT： The notebook might be helpful to the Kira investigation, but we really only need one of them.
I’ll give this one back to you.


( RYUK： Humans who used the notebook are cursed with fear, pain, and misery.
Hm, of course, Souichiro didn’t use the notebook.
He got to die believing that his son wasn’t Kira.
I guess that means he was happy. )
