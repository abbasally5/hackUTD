--------- YOTSUBA ---------We’ve just received a new report from Coil.He says that Misa Amane might know L.According to Coil, L once [questioned] Amane as part of his Kira investigation.Let’s see, here is the problem.He says “I’ve been able to deduce that Amane worships Kira.”“At the moment, Yoshida productions is trying to promote Amane as the new face of Yotsuba.”“My recommendation is that Yotsuba use her for their next ad campaign and take the opportunity to extract information about L.”Personally, I don’t like the idea.It’s unacceptable, if you ask me.It seems like a perfectly good plan.It’s supposed to be Coil’s job to investigate L’s identity.It doesn’t make sense for him to leave all the hard work to us, in my opinion.We’re paying him to uncover L’s identity, after all.--------- AIBER’S HOTEL ---------So, is it an emergency?In that case, I think I have an even better idea.--------- HIGUCHI’S HOME ---------Being Kira is so time-consuming.But things sure have become more interesting lately.It’s pretty clear that Misa Amane was the second Kira and that L must have caught her at some point.The only way she could have got out of that situation is by forfeiting ownership of her death note and losing all memories of what she did with it.I’m not about to leave things as they are.I’m going to make Misa Amane my wife.Ha ha ha ha …!Everything I could ever want: money, power, and a beautiful wife.That’ll be enough to make anyone envious.Once we’re married, I’ll ([ ] vest / just invest) a large lump sum in her life insurance.--------- MISA’S ROOM ---------Let’s try again from the top.It looks too cheesy, not to mention the fake.But I thought that was a realistic performance.--------- IN MOGI’S CAR ---------And you can just call me Misa, you know.I already know about that.And of course that means you can’t [let your cover fall], either.You’re gonna play the character of the hyper-energetic manager, OK?Bring it on, [huh / hooah]!!!---------　YOTSUBA HEAD OFFICE ---------I’m Misa-misa’s manager, Kenichi Moji, also known as Mochi.I’m very pleased to meet all of you!!!--------- YOTSUBA INTERVIEW ROOM ---------My name is John Wares, an executive adviser for the advertising department.Nice to meet you.I’m very pleased to meet you, too!We’ve been talking about it, and we’ve pretty much decided to hire you already.But, before we make it official, I’d like to clarify a few things.You worship Kira because he killed the suspect.Isn’t it true that you came to Tokyo in hopes of finding and meeting Kira?The information is liable and now I’d say it’s confirmed.The look in your face tells me that these are the facts.Coil, I never thought you’d investigated that far. )Something you prefer the world not to know.We’d like you to tell us the full story of what really happened.It would be a problem if the new face of Yotsuba turned out to be Kira.We would appreciate to it if you are honest with us.I understand.I’ll tell you everything.Yes, I was held for questioning.I didn’t think it was L, but he did ask me lots of questions about Kira.But I’m not the second Kira and I never was.I was released because he realized that I didn’t have anything to do with Kira, after all.Job interview or police interrogation?How long are we gonna keep this up?I’m going to the bathroom.It seems the interview veered a little off track.We are very sorry.But, would you mind if I went to the bathroom as well?--------- YOTSUBA WASHROOM ---------But, everything’s going well so far.I just have to keep it up.- Rem made Misa touch a piece of a page from the death note –Hmmm!!But at least now Misa can see me once again. )Some kind of monster?! )There are people within Yotsuba who can easily have you killed.I’ve come here to warn you.Calm down and listen to me.How can I?!This thing looks like it’s gonna kill me! )I’m your ally.--------- TASK FORCE HQ ---------Maybe we should have wired her or used something to track her movements.The Kira before I was detained and the one it surfaced afterwards; they must be two different people.The aim all clearly doesn’t match.This Kira is killing criminals as soon as they’ve had their crime broadcast on TV regardless of the situation.He’s punishing people who never intended to kill; those who sincerely regretted their crimes or people with excusable circumstances.The original Kira would have never punished those kinds of people.That’s the sort of distinction I’d make if were him.The way the original Kira acted is disturbingly close to my ideals.… Huh!!What the hell am I thinking?I’m not Kira.Something’s gotta be wrong with me if I’m seriously comparing myself to that murderer. )--------- YOTSUBA WASHROOM ---------What are you?I mean I can tell you’re not a stoker but, but you don’t look like a human at all.I am a Shinigami.Before you were captured by L, you and I worked closely together.I don’t understand.You know me?And Light is Kira?It grants its owner the power to kill someone simply by writing that person’s name in it.Light Yagami took it upon himself to punish criminals using that notebook.He soon became known to the world as Kira.You also possessed that same power.In fact, your ability was even greater than his.You managed to find Light by using your power to determine that he was in fact Kira.Or rather, that used to be the case.Light arranged it so you would both lose this power.This was all according to his plan.Then Ryuzaki was right!! )… Unbelievable.You got to be telling the truth.You already know everything about me.I totally believe you now.And, yes, I do love him to death.Not to mention how amazing it is that Light and I were both Kira, of course I wanna believe something like that.I only wish I could remember it!And it seems your feelings for Light will never change, either.It’s enough to convince me that the only way you can be truly happy in life is if you can support him in his plan.The current Kira is a violent pathetic human being.I don’t know what he’s capable of.Be careful and beware the others from Yotsuba.Trust Light.Let him do whatever he feels necessary.I guess I should just act normally in the meantime though, right?When you go back to the interview, you will be able to see for yourself who the real Kira is.Be on your guard and do not trust him.--------- YOTSUBA INTERVIEW ROOM ---------It took so long.I was just fixing up my makeup a little.The man sitting in front of me will be Kira.… Higuchi is Kira?![The / That] bastard!! )--------- TASK FORCE HQ ---------… Oh, they’re back!Oh, I’m exhausted.That’s good to hear.Would you believe three out of the seven guys already [massage] me asking for a private date.Oh it’s going exactly as I planned.The plan’s getting canceled right now.But why?Everything’s been going so smoothly up until now.You can still appear in their commercials.But from now on, you should deny that you were suspected of being the second Kira and thus detained by L.Mogi will continue being your bodyguard, but you’ll be working thoroughly as a celebrity.Tomorrow shoot is bright and early, so I better get some sleep.You are so sweet to be worried about me.But I’ve thought of the best plan ever.I’m gonna be useful to you.I promise. )You’ll save me for after we catch Kira, right?You don’t have to be shy about it.There’s no need to be shy.--------- LOCATION ---------Ok, that’s [a wrap]!Can you take me to the restroom in that hospital?I’ll be waiting!!--------- HOSPITAL WASHROOM ---------- knock -Misa!You actually made it.You look so cute in that nurse’s outfit!--------- IN FRONT OF THE HOSPITAL ---------By the way, lovely in that nurse’s outfit, Misa.--------- HOSPITAL ---------… Where is Misa?!--------- HIGUCHI’S CAR ---------He’s been even more persistent than any of the other guys.He is Kira, it can’t get any worse than that. )Well, even if you were, that’s OK.I’ll be fine since I can kill people.Is this part of Light Yagami’s plan?Is this what he wants you to do?Or is this your way of telling me that you want me to kill Higuchi the moment he tries to do anything? )You can kill people?It’s true!And do you know why?Because I’m the second Kira.That can’t be!Even if she was the second Kira before, there’s no way she still is.She’s not supposed to have any memory of it, either.What the hell is going on? )I’m sure you’ll find that I’m quite a gentleman.Anyway, I’ll only prove that I’m the second Kira to the real Kira.Why?I know he’ll need me by his side once I tell him.If that’s the case, I need to make sure I keep this girl by my side at all costs.I’ve gotta test it first. )Well, since I happened to be Kira, does that mean you’ll marry me?I mean it.Then prove it to me!!C’mon, let’s prove it to each other!It would be a pretty bad idea to let someone witness how I kill people.I don’t know.If I thought someone was Kira, I think I’d be willing to show them.We’d never get anywhere if I didn’t.Then why don’t you kill someone?After all, I could be the real Kira.Bad person, huh?This is Ginzo Kaneboshi, president of a major finance company.He’s [infamous] for his immoral collection [with it / method], sometime he even makes people pay with their insurance money.How about him?Could you turn around for just a sec?Then Higuchi will believe your claim about being the second Kira.Very well. )He should be dead by now.Call back later!The same guy I chose just a minute ago!Would have been impossible to do that unless she had the power!This proves it!!)You understand?!For all I know, you’re just making all this up and you have an excuse to take me to your place.Wait!I know.What if you stop killing the criminals on TV?!That should prove it!If you are Kira, it should be no problem.You can start killing again when I tell you to.If all the times and deaths match up, then I’ll believe you.After all, killing criminals in that way is something that only Kira can do.That’s a good idea.All right, Misa.--------- TASK FORCE HQ ---------I’ll stop killing criminals for the time being, then once you are fully convinced I’m a real thing, you and I get married.That’s amazing, Misa-misa!!
