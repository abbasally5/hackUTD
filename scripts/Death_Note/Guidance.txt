--------- TASK FORCE HQ ---------However, I knew Amane would do almost anything for Light, but do you think that she would actually go this far?If criminals do stop dying after this, it will make it difficult to determine the critical element; how Kira conducts his murders.I have to think of a plan. )That guy’s totally in love with me.All I had to do was tell him I’d marry him if he was really Kira.Plus I managed to convince him that I am the second Kira.You idiot!!Didn’t I tell you to deny all that?!So what’s the problem?Can’t we just catch him?Before we move to arrest Higuchi, I want to find out how he kills people.Isn’t that right?At any rate, even if we do arrest Higuchi, we’re not going to do it until we are certain that criminals have stopped dying.Let me think about this for a moment.We should be able to track 70% of their movements using our cameras inside the office building.I’ve only been able to enter the houses of five of the men so far.But Midou, Namikawa and Higuchi, all have super high-tech security systems, especially Higuchi.He recently constructed a dampening room that shuts out any electronic waves.It took me two days just to break into the place.Then begin installing microphones, trackers, and cameras, but not in the house. Instead just put them in every car.After getting this far?!Do you know how difficult it is to break into someone’s house?!Besides, do you have any idea of how many cars this guy has?I just have to install them in all his cars, right?Are you still going on about that?!Look, I’m not Kira!How many times do I …Well, do you remember?How could I?!Cause I’m not Kira!I’d like you to thoroughly analyze my current theory.This could determine the way in which we’d end up catching Kira.Kira’s power has somehow passed onto another person.Light Yagami now has no memory of ever being Kira.I need your analysis based on these assumptions.Do you think you can do that for me?Kira’s power has somehow passed onto another person.Was that because Light Yagami[, who] wanted it to happen, or was there someone else in control of Light, lurking in the background, who gave him the power?Was it that person who passed Light’s power to someone else?If there is a third party with the ability to bestow or transfer Kira’s power and they didn’t want their method to be discovered, it makes no sense that they would wait so long to transfer it from you to the next Kira.If we believed that this was the work of some being watching us from above, then we’d have to accept that they are impossible to catch.Not to mention, I’d already be dead.Or at the very least, I’m being made to be a fool by eternally dancing in the palm of someone’s hand.It’s highly unlikely that such a being exists.Thank you, Light.I can now say that I feel 99% better [than before].We’ll have him show us how he kills.We’ll [book] a three-hour time slot.It’ll be announced that Kira’s identity will be revealed near the end of the special.This is Sakura TV, after all.For all we know, Higuchi may not even watch that program.Turn on your TV.”That should be enough to get him watching.Higuchi will buy it once he realizes that the special guest on TV is someone who knows his secret.So we’ll be using Aiber then.He will reveal that he was a spy all along!We will not be using Aiber.Whoever appears on the show has to be someone who Higuchi believes he’ll be able to kill.In other words, it has to be someone whose name he can look up easily.It would make sense that Misa’s manager who he thought was dead is the one revealing the secret.We’ll have Sakura TV use a voice-filter and a frosted glass to protect your identity.Higuchi would probably realize from the announcement and [his/the] silhouette that it’s the manager, Taro Matsui.And just to make sure we will have the studio messed up to accidentally reveal your face from behind the frosted glass.Sounds exciting!!He’d have no choice but to find out the manager’s name as soon as possible.We can anticipate what actions he’ll take.After that, we’ll arrest him.And there is one potential problem with this plan.If Higuchi can kill by simply looking at someone’s face just like the second Kira, Matsuda will die.We’ll have to wait for two or three days to see whether or not that happens.In the meantime, Matsuda will have to decide if he wants to go through with this plan.I want to do this.--------- MIDOU’S HOME ---------What’s with this private meeting? Who do you think is Kira?Besides, for all I know, it could be you, Shimura.Or maybe even Midou.He was the one who came crying to me about how he can’t go along with Kira’s crimes anymore.But if Midou had turned out to be Kira, you would have been killed.You and Midou would have been successful on your own.There is no way either of you would need to hold those stupid meetings, let alone with seven others.I can at least see that much.We’re all cooperating with these killings because we are afraid of Kira turning on us.I mean it’s only a matter of time until the public finds out.And this isn’t going to stop until that happens.Who do you think Kira might be?Kira would make sure there are people less clever than him.It’s Higuchi, isn’t it?He is the one who’s the most obsessed with money and success.He might always act as if he’s not interested in those things, but that just proves it all the more.I believe that’s why he was demoted from being head of the development department.By the way, I meant to ask, was I the only one you invited here?Good old Ooi, always the blunt one.I was wondering who it was from.You know, Shimura, you really are a sharp one.Kira provably selected you, because he appreciates your caution.- Namikawa’s cell rings –- blip -Before I go on, are you by yourself?One of the people here with me was just expressing his suspicions about your last phone call.I’m reasonably certain that neither of them are Kira.In fact, they seem fed up with it at this point.I’ll speak for them and say they’ll choose to stand back and watch your face-off with Kira, like I plan to.--------- TASK FORCE HQ ---------Then it’s the end for Higuchi.You know that it’s him?So even the great L can be tricked.Based on your reaction I’m now a hundred percent certain that Higuchi is Kira.But then, I always thought he was from looking at his face.I guess [this proves it].That was just because Light messed up.A few minutes into the program, I want you to contact Higuchi, tell him to tune in.Do that for me, and I won’t go after you or any of the other five.As for the others; Kida, Takahashi and Ooi, if they tried to do anything, make sure to stop them.---------　MIDOU’S HOME ---------He’ll be captured tonight apparently.--------- HIGUCHI’S HOME ---------It’s been about three days since I stopped killing criminals.That should be good enough, shouldn’t it?Now, when I marry Misa Amane, the second Kira, I’ll have the Shinigami eyes.With that power in my hands, Yotsuba will be under my control.Ha ha ha ha ha!!!- Higuchi’s cell rings –Turn on a television.Check out Sakura TV.I’ve got a more evidence to prove it, too.C’mon, it’s probably a hoax.This is Sakura TV.At the beginning of the show, he said that he overheard a meeting between eight people.Someone who knows about the meetings?!Who is it, did someone betray us?! )The man who died was Mr. H.Hatori!If he knows this much, he could be one of the other six.No, maybe it’s Coil. )There is no benefit for them to do this.But no one else knows about the meetings, do they?Damn it!!Who is it?!What, wait, could it be …. )- frosted glass falls –It’s Misa’s manager.Matsui, that’s his name?!Why is he still alive?!He pretended to fall out of the apartment window and escaped to a balcony of a few floors below.Just to be careful, I went home that night and wrote his name in that notebook like he was written on his business card.Why is he still alive then?!Could he be a former entertainer who became a manager using a stage name?!Is that possible?! )I’m contacting everyone right now to let them know.We’ll talk later.- blip -Are you all right?We can stop if you want.I knew I was gonna be in danger going into this.This is for a sake of justice.So I’ll see through till the end even if it means my death.--------- SAKURA TV ---------That’s perfect!Listen, just be sure to hold up on the Kira announcement till [a/the] last minute, all right?--------- HIGUCHI’S HOME ---------Calm down.Misa knows his face.Or she is the second Kira, she should know what his real name is. )---------　TASK FORCE HQ ---------Hm!- Misa just hangs up the call –--------- HIGUCHI’S HOME ---------Who knows when they make the announcement.Misa’s new lineup lipstick.Just for you.Are you watching Sakura TV?Why don’t you call your father at the House of Councilors?Have him pull some strings at the Ministry of Internal Affairs to stop this broadcast!No one believes this program so we’d only make ourselves look suspicious if we stop it.Besides, there shouldn’t be anything to worry about.The guy revealed his face earlier.Everyone knows it’s really Taro Matsui.Namikawa’s already gone ahead and told everyone to watch the show.Since one of us seven has to be Kira, that should mean Taro Matsui will soon be dead, right?That means if I say anything, it’ll reveal the fact that I’m Kira. )I’ll talk to you later.--------- TASK FORCE HQ ---------He just received a call from Higuchi.Everything’s as planned.< Conversation between HIGUCHI and MOGI >Where is Misa?!Pleasure to hear from you.I’m sorry but Misa-misa’s taking [a much new] vacation right now.She should be back by all tomorrow morning, though.You can reach her then!She’s requested that no one know where she is.I’m very sorry.I’ll have her contact you tomorrow first thing.I know his face!!I could kill him at anytime if only I knew his name!! )I was only recently hired so I don’t know much about him.If you need some information, I can let you talk to someone from the office.I just remembered, everyone’s in Okinawa at the moment!You can try calling the president, though.It’s almost scary.You should be happy.That manager’s real name isn’t Taro Matsui, is it?Stupid Higuchi.< Conversation between HIGUCHI and the President of Yoshida Productions >I think he was just [ ] manager.And his first name was, eh, I’m sorry, I can’t remember.Why the hell can’t you remember the names of the people you hire?!No need for that kind of language.I’ve got his personnel file back the office.Give me a break.We’re on a first company vacation in two years![If] you wanna know that badly, I’ll give you the pin code for the office lock.You can go in yourself and look it up. How’s that?The personnel files are in the desk at the back to left.You'll find the files in the bottom drawer.They should all be sorted alphabetically.But I’m pretty sure it was Yamashita.He’s only carrying a single bag.I’m in pursuit.I’ll kill him no matter what.I’ve come this far.I won’t let them stop me.I’m not giving up until I have everything!Ha ha ha ha ha!!! )
