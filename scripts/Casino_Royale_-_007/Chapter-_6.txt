  Le Chiffre:
Weeping blood comes merely from a derangement of the tear duct...
...my dear general.
Nothing sinister.
All in.
I have two pair, and you have a 1 7.4 percent chance...
...of making your straight.
When does Ellipsis expire?
Kratt:
We have less than 36 hours. I can-
Le Chiffre:
No. No, no.
That's all the time I have anyway.
Give our guests five minutes to leave...
...or throw them overboard.
M:
Who the hell do they think they are?
I report to the prime minister, even he's smart enough...
...not to ask me what we do.
Have you ever seen such a bunch of self-righteous, ass-covering prigs?
They don't care what we do, they care what we get photographed doing.
And how the hell could Bond be so stupid?
I give him double-0 status, he celebrates by shooting an embassy.
Is the man deranged?
And where the hell is he?
In the old days, if an agent did something embarrassing...
...he'd have the good sense to defect.
Christ, I miss the Cold War.

M:
You've got a bloody cheek.
Bond:
Sorry.
I'll shoot the camera first next time.
M:
Or yourself.
You stormed into an embassy.
You violated the only absolutely inviolate rule...
...of international relationships.
And why?
So you could kill a nobody.
We wanted to question him, not kill him.
For God's sake. You're supposed to display some kind of judgment.
Bond:
I did.
I thought one less bomb-maker in the world would be good.
M:
Exactly.
One bomb-maker.
We're trying to find out how an entire network of terrorist groups is financed...
...and you give us one bomb-maker.
Hardly the big picture, wouldn't you say?
The man isn't even a true believer.
He's a gun for hire.
And thanks to your trigger finger...
...we have no idea who hired him or why.
And how the hell did you find out where I lived?
Bond:
The same way I found out your name.
I thought ''M'' was randomly assigned.
I had no idea it stood for--
M:
Utter one more syllable and I'll have you killed.
I knew it was too early to promote you.
Bond:
Well, I understand double-0s have a very short life-expectancy...
...so your mistake will be short-lived.
M:
Bond, this may be too much for a blunt instrument to understand...
...but arrogance and self-awareness seldom go hand in hand.
Bond:
So you want me to be half monk, half hit-man?
M:
Any thug can kill.
I want you to take your ego out of the equation...
...and to judge the situation dispassionately.
I have to know I can trust you, and that you know who to trust.
And since I don't know that, I need you out of my sight.
Go and stick your head in the sand somewhere...
...and think about your future.
Because these bastards want your head.
And Iâ€™m seriously considering feeding you to them.
And Bond...
...don't ever break into my house again.
Bond:
Ma'am.
