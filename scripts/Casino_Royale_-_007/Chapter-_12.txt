  Police officer:
Get moving!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

Trader
The puts expired. I’m sorry,
I’m not sure yet how much you've lost.
Le Chiffre:
One hundred and one million, two hundred and six thousand dollars.
Someone talked.

MI6 CSI member:
You got everything you need?
MI6 CSI member:
Yeah, I have.
MI6 CSI member:
I’m gonna get a few more photos....
M:
Quite the body count you're stacking up.
She was tortured first.
As you'd already killed her husband...
...she must have been the only one left to question.
Did she know anything that could compromise you?
Bond:
No.
M:
Not your name, what you were after?
Bond:
No.
M:
Dimitrios worked as a middleman.
Knew where to put his hands on weapons...
...and people who could use them.
He worked with anyone who had money.
For years he was involved with a man we knew as Le Chiffre...
...a private banker to the world's terrorists.
He invested their money, gave them access to it wherever they wanted.
Oh, good. You're here.
Albanian, we believe.
Chess prodigy.
A bit of a mathematical genius and liked to prove it by playing poker.
Bond:
So you can keep an eye on me?
M:
Yes.
When they analyzed the stock market after 9l1 1 ...
...the ClA discovered a massive shorting of airline stocks.
When the stocks hit bottom on 9l1 2, somebody made a fortune.
The same thing happened this morning with Skyfleet stock...
...or was supposed to.
With their prototype destroyed, the company would be near bankruptcy.
Instead, somebody lost over $100 million betting the wrong way.
Bond:
You think it's this man Le Chiffre.
M:
Which would explain how he could set up a high-stakes poker game...
...at Casino Royale in Montenegro.
Ten players, $10 million buy-in, 5 million re-buy.
Winner takes all.
Potentially 150 million.
Bond:
Good.
Then we'll know where he'll be.
Do you want a clean kill or to send a message?
M:
We want him alive. Le Chiffre doesn't have 100 million to lose.
Bond:
Has he been playing the stock market with his clients' funds?
They're not gonna be too happy when they find out it's gone.
M:
We can't let him win this game.
If he loses, he'll have nowhere to run.
We'll give him sanctuary in return for everything he knows.
I’m putting you in the game...
...replacing someone who's playing for a syndicate.
According to Villiers, you're the best player in the Service.
Trust me, I wish it wasn't the case.
I would ask you if you could remain emotionally detached...
...but I don't think that's your problem, is it, Bond?
Bond:
No.
M:
Don't worry about keeping in touch.
We'll know where you are.
Bond:
You can stop pretending.
You knew I wouldn't let this drop, didn't you?
M:
Well, I knew you were you.
