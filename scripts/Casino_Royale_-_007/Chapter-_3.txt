So how do I trust this man that Iâ€™ve never met with my money?
Mr. White
You asked for the introduction.
That's all my organization will guarantee.
Le Chiffre:
I suppose our friend Mr. White will have told you...
...that I have provided reliable banking services...
...for many other freedom fighters over the years.
Obanno:
Do you believe in God,
Mr. Le Chiffre?
Le Chiffre:
No.
I believe in a reasonable rate of return.
Obanno:
I want no risk in the portfolio.
Le Chiffre:
Agreed.
Obanno:
And I can access it anywhere in the world?
Le Chiffre:
Yes.
I have the money, so short another million shares...
Int. Stockbroker:
...of Skyfleet stock.
Sir, you must know you're betting against the market.
No one expects this stock to go anywhere but up.
Le Chiffre:
Just do it.
