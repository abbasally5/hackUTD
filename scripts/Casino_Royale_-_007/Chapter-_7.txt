  Valet:
Good day, sir, and welcome to the Ocean Club.
A couple of women:
Hey. Hey.
Fat german:
Hello.
Are you going to take this or make me wait?
Certainly, sir.
Sorry, sir.
Security guard:
Security to car park.
Security to car park.
A couple of women
Absolutely incredible.
Receptionist:
Welcome to the Ocean Club, sir.
Checking in?
Bond:
Yes.
But it's a spur-of-the-moment thing, and I haven't got a reservation.
Receptionist:
Okay.
We have an ocean-view villa.
Bond:
Perfect.
Could you do me a favor?
I was here last night...
...and I parked my car next to a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin.
I nicked the door.
You wouldn't happen to know-?
Receptionist:
-Mr. Dimitrios.
Bond:
-Right.
Receptionist:
If he hasn't noticed, I’m not sure I’d mention it.
Isn't the type to take bad news well.
Bond:
But if I felt compelled to find him?
Receptionist:
He has a house just up the beach.
Bond:
Thank you.
