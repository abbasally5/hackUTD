  Valet:
Thank you, sir.
Solange:
No wonder he was in such a foul mood.
My mistake.
Bond:
Can I give you a lift home?
Solange:
That would really send him over the edge.
I’m afraid I’m not that cruel.
Bond:
Well, perhaps you're just out of practice.
Solange:
Perhaps.
Bond:
Well, what about a drink at my place?
Solange
Your place?
Solange
Is it close?
Bond:
Very.
Solange:
One drink.
Valet:
Good evening, sir, and welcome back.
Bond:
Welcome to my home.
Dimitrios:
I'm having a hard time seeing how this is my fault.
It's your plan.
All I did was get you the man.
Le Chiffre:
A man who was under surveillance by the British Secret Service.
Which makes me wonder if I can trust you at all.
Dimitrios:
Then don't. I couldn't care less.
But I do care about my reputation.
I have someone else willing to do the job.
He just needs the particulars...
...and payment.
Solange:
You like married women, don't you, James?
Bond:
It keeps things simple.
Solange:
What is it about bad men?
You, my husband....
I had so many chances to be happy...
...so many nice guys.
Why can't nice guys be more like you?
Bond:
Well, because then they'd be bad.
Solange:
Yes.
But so much more interesting.
Bond:
What makes your husband a bad man?
Solange:
His nature, I suppose.
Bond:
The nature of his work?
Solange:
A mystery, I’m afraid.
I’m also afraid you will sleep with me in order to get to him.
Bond:
How afraid?
Solange:
Not enough to stop.
Bond:
Can I ask you a personal question?
Solange:
Now would seem an appropriate time.
Bond:
Does ''ellipsis'' mean anything to you?
Solange:
Should I ask him about it?
Bond:
Perhaps later.
Solange:
Yes, dear?
Dimitrios:
I'm on the last flight tonight to Miami.
Don't wait up.
I'll be back in the morning.
Solange:
Okay, I understand.
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.
Apparently he's on the last flight to Miami...
...so you have all night to question me.
Bond:
ln that case...
...we're gonna need...
...some more champagne.
Valet:
Good evening. Room Service.
Bond:
Good evening.
Can I get a bottle of chilled Bollinger Grand Année...
...and the beluga caviar?
Valet:
With everything?
Bond:
Yes, with everything.
Valet:
And would that be for two, sir?
Bond:
What?
Valet:
For two?
Bond:
No, for one.
