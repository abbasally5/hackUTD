Houki: But don't worry, okay? You can always trust me to get you way you're going.

Ichika: I have to try!

Houki: I'm finished as a pilot. I quit.

Rin: So are you going to get up, or are you just a pathetic coward who can't fight when it really accounts for something?

Houki: Because I'm not going to lose this time!

- - - - -OP- - - - -

Laura: Don't hold back! Keep firing! It's faster than I expected!

Charlotte: I've got him! I guess [I] will never shoot him down.

Ichika: Why does this... remind me of something I've seen before?

Mystery girl: They're calling. You have to go now.

Cecilia: Did you get it?

Rin: No! Not yet!

Armored girl: Ichika, do you desire power?

Laura: Houki! Release your weapons and run!

Charlotte: Houki!

Cecilia: Houki!

Laura: Are you all right?

Houki: Yes, I am. I'm just fine.

Armored girl: Ichka, do you desire power?

Laura: Mein Gott! It's shifted into secondary form!

Armored girl: Ichika, do you desire power?

Ichika: Mm-hm.

Armored girl: Why do you desire power?

Ichika: I want to... protect my friends. I mean, my comrades, that's what I want.

Armored girl: For your comrades?

Ichika: Yes. It's like there's so much in this world that you have to fight against.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
This world's consumed with irrational violence.
I want to fight it and to aid my comrades in that battle as much as I can.
That's what I need the power for. To help them.

Armored girl: Yes, I see.

Mystery girl: It's your fate. You have to go. Do you understand?

Cecilia: Houki, no!

Houki: I miss you... I miss you, Ichika. I miss you... I miss you. Ichika...

Ichika: Houki.

Houki: Ichika...?

Ichika: Yeah. I'm sorry about the wait.

Houki: Ichika! Are your wounds...? Are you...?

Ichika: Ah, I'm okay. I could fight, too. Everyone tried to stop me, though.

Houki: I... I'm so glad that you're all right.

Ichika: Hang on, are you crying?

Houki: Ah, no. Of course I'm not crying.

Ichika: Well, just in case, here.
To be honest, I like your normal hairdo better than this.
But, um, happy birthday, [xxx]. Today is July 7th, isn't it?
I'll be back. Just have faith.

Houki: Oh Ichika...

Maya: Why haven't our transmissions gone back to normal yet?

Chifuyu: Because the kids probably shut it off themselves.

Girls: Ms. Orimura!

Ma'am!

Ma'am!

Chifuyu: Just stay out! We're busy in here.

Girls: We understand that, ma'am.

But Orimura is...

Chifuyu: What?

- - - - -

Maya: That's the Byakushiki's second form. Setsura!

Ichika: Setsura! Change the shield mode!

Houki: That's the Reiraku Byakuya's shield!

Ichika: Houki!

Houki: I'm okay. Don't worry about me.

Laura: I'm sorry. It took some time to recover.

Cecilia: Right. Then it's time to stage our counterattack.

Ichika: Laura! Cecilia!

Rin: All right, Ichika, let's finish this up in short order.

Charlotte: We have enough energy for this. So you don't have to worry about us.

Ichika: Rin! Charl! Come on! Let's do it!

Houki: Ichika. I wanna fight alongside you. I want to have your back.
What's going on? My energy's recharging! This is the Kenran Buto.
So this has to be... the Akatsubaki's fourth gen's special ability!
Right. Let's do this, Akatsubaki!

Maya: The Byakushiki's energy level has fallen into just 10%.

Ichika: Oh no! My energy level!

Houki: Ichika, here. Take this.

Ichika: What the hell? My energy's been recharged.

Houki: That's right. Now go and finish it off!

Ichika: Right. Let's go!

Charlotte: Right.

Laura: Yeah.

Rin: Let's do it.

Cecilia: Roger.

Houki: Ichika, now!

Ichika: Laura, now!

Laura: Jawohl!

Cecilia: I'm right over here, you monster!

Rin: Ichika, hit it one more time!

Charlotte: Rin! Please hurry, Ichika! We can't hold on!

Ichika: You won't get away this time!

Houki: Is it over?

Ichika: Yeah, it finally is.

Chifuyu: Mission accomplished. Well, that's what I'd like to say.
But the fact is that you have committed a very grave offense here.

All: Yes, ma'am.

Chifuyu: When you get home, I want you to all write an essay on what you did wrong.
And in the meantime, I'll be preparing some especially grueling training for you as punishment.

Maya: Um, excuse me, Ms. Orimura.
But shall we call it a day now?
I'm sure everyone is very tired.

Chifuyu: But in spite of all this screwups, you did a good job.
And... I'm glad you all made it back all right. So, um... take the rest of a day off.

Girls: So [I'd like to hear], what just happened out there?
What really made the Gospel run wild?

Is it true there was no one inside it?

Weren't you afraid when you were fighting? Wasn't it scary?

Come on, you guys. Tell us.
The teachers aren't saying anything to anybody.

Charlotte: So sorry. The official's labeled the whole thing top secret.

Rin: No kidding. Even though we haven't been told all the particulars yet.

Laura: I understand. You're curious about the situation.
But if you knew more, they would place restrictions on you as well. Okay?

Girls: Ah, no. I don't think I'd like that.

I don't wanna be spied on or anything.

Cecilia: Hold on. Just where have Ichika and Houki wandered off to?

Tabane: The Byakushiki sure is surprising, isn't it?
It even has the capability of being able to revive its pilot. Just like...

Chifuyu: Just like... the Shirokishi?
Core number 001, which you poured your blood, sweat and tears into?
The original IS unit.

Tabane: What's up, Chi-chan?

Chifuyu: I'd like to speak hypothetically.
Let's say that a certain genius could have an IS planted into a certain location on the day of a certain boy's high school entrance exam.
The genius make sure that's the only time this IS ever moves.
That way, it would look like a boy, who can't operate an IS, actually made it move.

Tabane: Then that would have been the only time it moved, wouldn't it?
But to be honest with you, even I don't know exactly why the Byakushiki moves.
It's really a mystery.

Chifuyu: All right then, let's talk about something different.
A certain genius decides she wants to debut her precious younger sister with a big bang.
So for her sister, she prepares her own personal unit.
The IS that made just run amok. And then, an incident occurs.
She drops her sister's new state-of-the-art unit into the mix.
Quite a debut for a little sis, don't you think?

Tabane: That really would be a super genius, huh?

Chifuyu: Mm-hm. A true super genius.
A super genius who's already managed to hack into the military computers of at least twenty countries.

Tabane: Say, Chi-chan. I wonder, does the world seem like a fun place to you?

Chifuyu: Fun, more or less, I suppose.

Tabane: I agree.

Ichika: I finally did it. I protected my comrades.

Houki: Ichika.

Ichika: Hey, Houki. So you came down here to swim, too?

Houki: Uh-huh, and I wanted to clear my head a bit.
So um, I guess you had the same idea.
I really... wish you wouldn't stare.

Ichika: Oh, I'm sorry. So umm, I was wondering.

Houki: Yeah?

Ichika: Is your hair okay? It got kinda burned back there, right?

Houki: Yeah, that's not a big deal. It'll grow back.
And as for the ribbon, I got a new one.

Ichika: I'm really glad that it'll be fine then.
And that everyone got back okay.
Even my injuries were nothing major in the end.

Houki: But are you really okay?
I mean, I didn't think you'd be able to recover from something like that so easily.

Ichika: Well, it wasn't really as bad as it looked.
So there's no need for you to worry about it anymore, okay?

Houki: But I do! I do! It's my fault that you were injured in the first place.
If you had made just one wrong move, you might've been killed.
So you're wrong. Don't forgive me like it's not a big deal.

Ichika: Okay, if you feel like that, how about some punishment?

Houki: Punishment?

Ichika: Yes, punishment. Now close your eyes.

Houki: That's fine. I deserve it.

Ichika: Okay, all done.

Houki: Are you making fun of me?

Ichika: Hey, calm down. Don't get so excited.

Houki: Don't get excited?! How can a warrior be calm when our pride has just been [insulted]?

Ichika: Houki, they're touching me!

Houki: Okay. Now they're not. But um... Can I ask you how they compare...?

Ichika: What?

Houki: Look, this's what I'm talking about.
I'm asking... if you've noticed me as someone of the opposite sex.

Ichika: Ah, I suppose.

Houki: Is that so?

Laura: We noticed that the two of you had disappeared.

Charlotte: That's right. What are you doing here on the beach?

Rin: Yeah. Let's kill him!

Cecilia: Well, maybe flesh wound!

Ichika: Houki! Get away!

Laura: Stop dodging!

Cecilia: You can't escape!

Rin: You're dead! Stop running!

Charlotte: We were worried something happened to you!

Ichika: Please!

Cecilia: So do you try [xxx] by the Britain law?!

Laura: You're unprepared to be my bride!
