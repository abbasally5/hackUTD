  Yui:
Mommy...It's mommy. She's here!

Kirito:
A...Are you sure?!

Yui:
Yes! I'm positive!

Leafa:
Hey...I...

Yui:
I scanned again, it's mommy's player ID! The coordinates are...Above us in the tree!

Kirito:
...!

Leafa:
Kirito! Wait, Kirito!
Why are you acting like this, Kirito? Is this person that important? But they are worth of this trouble?
Huh...! Watch out, Kirito! You'll be hit the barrier!

Kirito:
Gah!

Leafa:
Kirito! No!
Snap it, Kirito! It's impossible! You can't get any higher from air!

Kirito:
I have to...! Damn it, I have to try!

Yui:
Mommy...! I'm here mommy! ...Mommy!



Yui:
Ah...! Mommy...!

Asuna:
Uh...?

Yui:
Mommy!

Asuna:
Y-Yui...? Is that you?!

Yui:
Mommy! Mommy! I'm here!

Asuna:
I'm up here! Where are you?! Yui, I'm up here...! (Sob) Kirito...! ...Come on, think, there's gotta be something I can drop to let them know I'm here...!



Kirito:
Agh! ...Why can I pass through it!

Yui:
I used warning mode to contact her, but I don't know if it worked...

Kirito:
Ug...ah? ...What's that? ...A card? ...Leafa? Do you know what this thing does?

Leafa:
Uh-uh, I've never seen the item like that before...

Kirito:
(Tap, tap) I can't access the menu on it.

Yui:
Let's see...Ah! I got it! This is a system's admin access card!

Kirito:
Ah...Really?! Do you think we can access the GM controls with it?!

Yui:
No...You need the right console to access the controls. And, way to find it is the system menu, but, even I can't link that up, no one can...

Kirito:
I see...Although, I doubt something like this just fall out of the sky...I wonder...

Yui:
Yes! It's from mommy! She must have heard us and dropped it!

Kirito:
Asuna...
Leafa. I got a plan. I need to know where the gate is that will give me inside the world tree...

Leafa:
Well, the gate is the dome in the base of the tree, but...Ah! You are not thinking about going in there? The biggest raiding party couldn't get through! The whole thing's protected by guardian!

Kirito:
It doesn't matter, I have to try.

Leafa:
Uh...?

Kirito:
It's OK. Thank you for everything. I'll be going on my own from here on.

Leafa:
...Kirito.

Lady:
Should be get going now...?

Man:
Then that you---What the hell?!

Lady:
Is this an event?!

Kirito:
Yui, do you know how to get to the don?

Yui:
Yes! Just go up those stairs and, then---oh! eek!
A...Are you sure about this, daddy...? I'm only asking because beast on everything they told about the gate, breaking in sounds like it's going to be really hard...?

Kirito:
I don't any other choice. Besides...It's not like we'll die if we fail.

Yui:
Yeah...I guess you're right...

Kirito:
If I have to spend another second waiting around doing nothing, I'm gonna lose my mind.

Yui:
Um...

Kirito:
And, I'm knowing you wanna see mommy, too. Just as bad as I do.

Yui:
...I do.

Guardian statue:
Thou know'st not the heights of heaven and above. Dost thou seek entreat the castle of the king?

Kirito:
I'm coming, Asuna...Almost there...

Guardian statue:
Go, then...Prove thou art worthy of flying wings...Prove thou art worthy of flight!

Kirito:
Here we go, Yui. Keep your head down, OK?

Yui:
Okay...Good luck.

Kirito:
...WRAAAAAAH!
GET OUT OF MY WAAAY!
...I can do this!
GAAH! DIE! DAMN YOOOOU!
Asuna...Asuna...Asuna...Asuna...Asuna...Asuna...!
Almost there...I'm almost there...!
Gahaa! Ugg...AAAAAAHHHH!
Just a...little further...
AAAAAAH!



Kirito:


Leafa:
Kirito!
...Ugh! Gaah! ...Waaaaar!
...Kirito.
Ah...Kirito!

Kirito:
Thank you, Leafa...

Leafa:
I...I didn't...

Kirito:
Promise me, you won't do that again. I can do this on my own. But, I don't wanna cause you any more trouble.

Leafa:
Trouble?! But it's not...! I was just...Eh? Hold on, where are you going...? Wait! You can't do this alone, Kirito!

Kirito:
Yeah, maybe you're right.

Leafa:
You know I'm right. Listen!

Kirito:
I'm going anyway.

Leafa:
! ...Please...stop...Just go back to how you were...I...I just...You mean so much to me...

Kirito:
...Leafa...Sorry.

Leafa:
!...

Kirito:
If I don't get up there, nothing will end...nothing will begin. I have to see her again...Just once. I have to see Asuna...

Leafa:
...Wh---what did you to say...?

Kirito:
Her name's Asuna. She's the one I'm looking for...

Leafa:
Bu---But then---Then, you're...oh my god...!
...Is that you? ...Kazuto?

Kirito:
Huh?
...Sugu? Suguha?!

Leafa:
Haa...I can't believe it...! It's not fair! No...

Kirito:
...Sugu!
Sugu!



Suguha:
...

Kazuto:
Sugu, it's me.

Suguha:
Go away! ...Just go...leave me alone...

Kazuto:
I wanted what's wrong, Sugu...I mean, it was kind of a shock for me, too...And, if you mad because I'm using a Nerve Gear again, I'm sorry. I just...I didn't have a choice.

Suguha:
...You're wrong. It's not why...It's not...

Kazuto:
Sugu?

Suguha:
I...I...! I...I betrayed the feelings I had...! I betrayed the love I felt...for you...
When I met Kirito, I thought finally...I could give up on these feelings I have for you...oh, what the hell...I already had! ...But, but now, I...

Kazuto:
Well, I mean...love? But you and me, we're

Suguha:
No we're not...

Kazuto:
Huh?

Suguha:
I said, no we're not! I know you aren't really my brother, and I'm not your sister! I've known all along! For the last two years anyway...That's why you quit kendou, isn't it? And why started avoiding me...It's because you knew the whole time, didn't you?! You push me away because I'm not your real sister, didn't you?! ...You did. Well, if that's how it is, why do you care about me now?!

Kazuto:
eh...

Suguha:
I just, I was so...happy you came back from SAO. I was happy because you are being nice to me again...just like when I'm little. It felt like you were finally giving me a chance. That's what I thought. But now, if this is how it is, I wish you'd kept and being jerked to me...If you had...I wanted when if you raised I felt about you...! I wouldn't felt sad and jealous when I found about her...! And even I'm trying forgetting about you, I'm falling love in Kirito instead!

Kazuto:
...I'm sorry.

Suguha:
...Go on, leave me alone.

Kazuto:
...Sugu.
