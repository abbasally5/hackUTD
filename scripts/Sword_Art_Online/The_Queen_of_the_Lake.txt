  (Morning, Kazuto's house. Kazuto and Suguha were eating their breakfast. The news caster was providing the program on TV)

News Caster:
Only three days left til the new year. And I hope you all enjoy your holiday. Traffic always...

Suguha:
Hey, were you up late again?

Kazuto:
Yeah...for the mechatronics project for the school...

Suguha:
Mecha---what? ...Sounds fun.

(Kazuto was sipping his coffee)

Suguha:
Kazuto, you see this yet?

(Suguha showed him her tablet computer)

Kazuto:
Ah!? What the... The Holy Sword Excalibur have been found in ALO!? ...Oh, man, That sucks. I can't believe someone else beat us to it...

Suguha:
Read the article, doofus. It said it's been found is all. No one's actually got it yet.

Kirito:
Oh...Yeah, you're right. Don't scare me like that.

Suguha:
Mm-huh.

(Kirito began narration, explaining the situation they were in)

Kirito:
A couple of month ago, on the Alne planes. Leafa, Yui, and me got swallowed by a big-ass monster worm. It dragged us in underground land called "Jötunheimr." We looked around for a bit, and came across this four-arm humanoid monster. It was fighting another monster that looked like across between elephant and jellyfish. Go figure, Leafa felt sorry for the Jellephant-thing, and told me go save it. I lured four-arm on to this frozen lake, and it fell through the ice. Then, the Jellephant took care of it.
Leafa decided to call it Tonky, and suddenly it transformed into even weirder looking thing, with eight wings. We hopped on its back, and it took us to a passage way. Leading to a surface world. On the way up, we saw it. In the upside-down pyramid, hanging from the roots of World Tree, and long, golden sword shimmering inside...Excalibur.

(Kirito's narration ended)

Kazuto:
I was planned on going back for it someday, but now...

Suguha:
It'd be a nice break from all that floor clearing you're doing in new Aincrad.

Kazuto:
This article doesn't say anything about how they found it. Players can't fly in Jötunheimr, you remember? But that's the only way to spot Excalibur. That thing's too high-up to see.

Suguha:
Unless they rescued one of Tonky's friends, which the riding trigger the quest flag? If we could it, so could someone else.

Kazuto:
I guess, that makes sense, although... Who trust that creepy...

Suguha:
Hm?

(Suguha cast intimidating glare to Kazuto, while she's drinking her milk)

Kazuto:
Um... er, I mean, who trust such "unique" monster unless they have weird tas...

Suguha:
Hmmm?

(Suguha cast more intimidating glare to Kazuto)

Kazuto:
I mean, a weirdly big heart!

Suguha:
(Bubble bubble bubble...)

Kazuto:
Someone just like you, sis! What are the odds...

Suguha:
He's not creepy! He's adorable! ...Anyway, the whole point of showing you that was get you going. It's only a matter of time before someone ground to that dungeon to get the sword.

Kazuto:
You're right, clock's ticking.

Suguha:
So, what are you gonna do about it?

Kazuto:
A-ahem, Sugu, getting rare items isn't the point of it. If that's all play for, you're missing out.

Suguha:
...Yeah, I guess you're right. There's funner things to do than boosting stats.

Kazuto:
I wasn't finished. I think Tonky wanted us to find it, and that's why he showed us where it was. For some reason, he needs us to clear that dungeon, so it's up to us to make his wish come true.

Suguha:
Mh-hmm...

Kazuto:
Tonky's our friend! And, there's no way I'm turning my back on a friend!

Suguha:
Mm~hmm...A minute ago, you called your "friend" creepy.

Kazuto:
Um, I meant "creepy cool!" ...Anyway, are you in?

Suguha:
...Sure, I don't have practice because of the holidays.

Kazuto:
Awesome! OK, we need seven others. We don't wanna over load Tonky. For starters, we got you, me, and Asuna. Then, there's Klein, Liz, and Silica. We need one more person... Agil got his work tonight. Chrysheight's not leveled up yet. Recon's grinding in Sylph territory...

Suguha:
Oh! I know! Let's ask Sinon to come along!

(Kazuto snapped his fingers)

Kazuto:
Great idea, sis!

Suguha:
What do you expect? I'll message them right now, except for Asuna. I'll leave that to you.

Kazuto:
Okay.

(Asuna's place. She was taking bath)

Asuna:
Hmm...I wish I get to see Kirito again...before I get visit to grand parents.

(Asuna's smart phone rang. She recognized the call was from Kazuto)

Asuna:
H-Hi, Kirito!

Kazuto:
Morning, Asuna. Sorry to call so early. We are planning on the quest in ALO this afternoon. You wanna go?

Asuna:
Yeah, I'll totally go. I'm all free today.

Kazuto:
Cool. I'll text the time and place, so keep an eye for it.

Asuna:
You know I will. See you in a little while, then.

(Asuna hanged up her phone)

Asuna:
...Yes!



(ALO, Liz's shop. Klein was guzzling some drink, heaved a contented sigh)

Klein:
Bwah! Ha ha ha...

Silica:
Hey Klein, do you get to take vacation for new year's?

Klein:
They're on since yesterday! Even if I want it to work, I don't. There's no ship in this time of year. You know what my cheapass boss said, "Be thank for you gotta job, and you got whole week off for new year's!" bragging about like he's doing us a favor! And speaking of favors, if we do manage to snag Excalibur today, how about do me a solid on help me get my hands on Soul Brade Kagutsuchi?

Kirito:
Seriously? That dungeon's like a freaking out the man.

Klein:
Yeah? I'm going to Jötunheimr for you, where the cold in the ass end of an ice pod!

Sinon:
You know, I want something out of this, too. The Shekinah Bow.

Kirito:
Er...Your avatar's two weeks old, and already you're gonna for legendary weapon?

Silica:
Yeah, well, that bow Liz made me is great now, but I need something with the little more range.

Lizabeth:
Oh yeah? Then, what the heck using bow in ALO for? Their reach falls between the spears and the magic. You're like the only player who wants to use these things to snipe from hundred meters.

Sinon:
If I had my way, I'd want double that range at least.

Lizabeth:
Uh-huh...hmm.

(Leafa and Asuna arrived at the shop)

Leafa:
We're back, guys!

Asuna:
Thanks for waiting.

Silica:
We thought you were never coming back.

Klein:
What's up? You get lost or something?

Yui:
Not at all! We were gathering information, while we shop. We talked to a whole bunch of people, daddy. And, so far, not one player or party has reached that dungeon yet.

Kirito:
Really? Well, then, how the heck do they know where the Excalibur's at?

Yui:
That's the thing, daddy. No one really knows where it is. Apparently, they found it different quest than the one Tonky showed us. They met an NPC who told them if they finished this other quest, they'll get Excalibur as the reward.

Asuna:
And, from what we heard, the quest there going on isn't very pleasant. Instead of a delivery quest or an escort quest, it's a kill quest. Just, slaughtering monsters. Everyone in Jötunheimr is out there right now killing as many as they can.

Kirito:
Yeah, that doesn't even sound close to be in pleasant.

Klein:
This whole thing sounds sketchy to me, guys? Here's what we know, there's a dungeon in the sky where the Excalibur locked up at the bottom of it. To get to it, we gotta fight to way through a bunch of the monsters. But now, we gotta NPC offered end opposite. Kill quest reward? That's bizarre.

Silica:
Now, that you mention it. That is weird. The NPC's not showing anyone to the dungeon, but that where the sword is.

Everyone:
Hmm....

Sinon:
Well, I'm sure we'll find out why once we'd get there.

Lizbeth:
All ready! Your weapons all restored, and ready for action!

Klein:
Even though our party's full of hotness, we're still a bunch or guild of meat-heads.

Lizbeth:
If you wanna switch you up, you could always boost your magic.

Klein:
Hah! Keep dreamin'. A real samurai, he wouldn't be cut out using magic. Code of Honor.

Lizbeth:
Code of Honor, huh? Know what's samurais classified as in RPGs? They're both worriers and black magic users.

Klein:
Please, I'd rather bust my sword and quit being a samurai than I use magic, duh.

Silica:
I don't know, Klein. If I remember, why didn't you use a flame sword skill the other day? You know, when you activate it, you are using prime magic.

Klein:
No way! Really!?

Yui:
Yes, Klein. What Silica said is true. Remember the May update? It brought a whole bunch of new sword skills to ALO. Some are physical, and others are advanced, like, Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Dark, and Divine. All of which are magical attributes.

Klein:
Fire's magical, too. Huh?

Lizbeth:
OK, ex-samurai. You need help to bust that sword?

Klein:
Yikes! Doofs...what we up here...?

Kirito:
Well...since you don't chant when using sword skills, I guess it's not the same...?

Lizbeth:
Oh? Let it slide this time, humph.

Kirito:
...I really appreciate you guys helping me out on such short notice. Seriously, you don't know how much this means to me.
Alright! Are you ready!?

Everyone:
Yeah!



(ALO. The team of Kirito's are running down spiral stair way, heading to Jötunheimr)

Lizbeth:
Couldn't high[?]...How many steps this things have anyway?

Leafa:
I know, I bet the tower of the dungeon floor of new Aincrad doesn't even have as many as this.

Lizbeth:
Hmm...

Kirito:
Oh, come on! It's not that bad. If we took the normal route to Jötunheimr, it takes at least two hours. This way, it's just five minutes! Instead to complain about the steps, you should be thanking me for showing you guys this large short cut.

Sinon:
Yeah, yeah, you're right. But it's still pain in the butt.

Kirito:
I got your pain in the butt.

(Kirito grabbed Sinon's cat like tail)

Sinon:
Er...! Eek! Why you...!

(Sinon tried to scratch him with her crows)

Sinon:
Dumb-ass! Do that again, and you gotta fire arrow in your pie-hole!

Klein:
Brother, you've gotta bow's of steel. No joke.

Kirito:
Heh heh...

(The party reached the edge of Jötunheimr. Strong cold wind blew hard)

Klein:
...Freezing!

Silica:
Wow, there's...

Sinon:
Amazing...

Klein:
A-aren't you cold?

Asuna:
Oss sér rauðr vind, burt hálka stórhrið!

Klein:
...oh?

Asuna:
Better? I cast a freeze resistance spell over us.

Leafa:
(Whistle)

Tonky:
Rrrooor!

(From faraway, jellyfish and elephant like creature responded to Leafa's whistle, with elephant like roar)

Yui:
Tonky, up here!

Klein:
Jesus! Wow...

Kirito:
Take it easy, Klein. He doesn't look it, but he's a vegetarian.

Leafa:
Well...not exactly. When I brought some fish from above ground, he's gulped it all down in one bite.

(Tonky reached his elephant-like nose top to Klein and others, grabbed them)

Klein:
Wh-what's he doing...?

Kirito:
He's setting you get on his back is all.

Klein:
Dude, no way. No way in hell... My grand-pa's dying words were don't ride on foreign cars and fly on floating elephant!

Kirito:
He's the same dead grand-pa who's dried figs you eating at Dicey's the other day? Stop fooling around and get on.

Klein:
Ohh...them each, man!

Lizbeth:
This is gonna be fun.

Klein:
And, so dad...

Kirito:
Thanks a lot for doing this, Tonky.

Leafa:
Alright, Tonky, Everyone's on board, so take us to that dungeon!

Tonky:
Rrrooar!

Lizbeth:
Wow...I wonder what would happen if we fell from way up here.

Asuna:
The same thing happened when the certain someone decided to get to the next level of Aincrad by climbing the out of pillars. So, how about, I wonder if you let's care to show the lady?

Kirito:
Nah, I think I'll pass. But maybe one of more cat-like friends would like to take a shot?

Sinon & Silica:
Nope nope nope nope nope...

Tonky:
Grroar...

Leafa:
Huh?

(Tonky suddenly dived to the ground)

Everyone:
Eeeek!

Leafa:
Ha ha ha ha... Yaa-hoo!

(Tonky restored its stableness in flying when he reached at lower altitude to right above the land, enough to see what is going on the ground)

Leafa:
Ah! Kazuto, get up here. Check it out!

(On the ground, Kirito and others saw other players were fighting against one of the Tonky's kin. The magic flame's incinerating it. By their side, there is gigantic four-armed monster helping them to kill jellyfish-elephant-like monster)

Asuna:
My god...I-I can't believe it. It figured out how to make that monster faith for them...

Silica:
No, there's got be another reason. It's not possible to tame monsters in this game. Not even if you're Cait Sith's master tamer with a full power boost and special equipment!

Klein:
Then, they aren't reach enough to the monster? No way, they are not reaching...? Piggybacking! Yeah, that's it! See, that group got the four-arms, they are doing all the heavy lift and sniping the jellephant when they get in opening!

Sinon:
But, is it that easy to control that monsters aggro? It's ignoring everyone else.

(The Jellephant on the ground fell his body. Magicians belonging to the other players' party cast fire bolts to the monster. In the flame, the monster became a countless shards of light and vanished, meaning its death)

Tonky:
Grroah...

Everyone:
...

(The other monster, four-armed one, glanced to the team of other players, then, began walking, as if it led the way for them)

Kirito:
...How come they're not taking on that four-arm, too? Where's everyone going?

Asuna:
...Hey you guys, look!

(Asuna indicated to the ground. There are more flames burned on the ground, which probably meant other fights against Jellephants down the ground)

Klein:
What the hell's going on down there!?

Lizbeth:
After what we just saw on how went down, it should pretty obvious what it is. I hate to say it, but we're looking at the kill quest Asuna told us about. Even though it's a quest, helping these four-armed freaks murder Tonky's friends is...disgusting.

(Then, on the behind Kirito's party, at once they saw the light generated in the space, there was a woman wearing blue gown standing at the rear edge of Tonky's)

Klein:
...Damn, she's tall...

Urðr:
Greetings. I am Urðr, Queen of the lake. You have bonded with my kinsmen, and I'm grateful. My two younger sisters and I have spoken at length, and we have a request for you. If you would be so kind, we ask that you save our lands from the Frost Giants...

Yui:
Daddy! ...She's an NPC, there's something strange about her, though. Her speech pattern doesn't follow the same set response routine that a normal NPC's would. Her core programming is connecting to the language engine module of the game.

Kirito:
What are you saying? Is she some kind of AI?

Yui:
Yes, daddy. She is.

Urðr:
...In the past, Jötunheimr was similar to your Álfheimr. Covered in lush greenery and beautiful lakes...It busked to the blessings of Yggdrasil, the World Tree. We, the Hill Giants, lived in peace and harmony with our kinfolk, the creatures.
Far below this land of Jötunheimr...is a realm of ice and snow, known as Niflheimr. Thrymr, king of the Frost Giants, rules that land. He shuttered our peace, by casting Excalibur, the sword that slices through wood and iron, into the Well of Urðr, the heart of our land. It severed the thickest root of the World Tree. In an instant, Jötunheimr lost the blessing that received from Yggdrasil.

Kirito:
I was right...Excalibur...

Urðr:
Under Thrymr's command, the Frost Giants marched on Jötunheimr and overwhelmed our defenses. Their fortresses and castles soon blighted our land. And, scores of my people were captured and imprisoned... Once they seize control, they built Thrymheim, their largest castle, the top of mass ice once known as the Well of Urðr.
During the chaos, my sisters and I escaped on the bottom of frozen lake. However, we no longer have the power we once have... The Frost Giants were not satisfied with their spoils. They wish to annihilate our kin, the creature that populate our realm. If they succeed, my powers will be extinguished...And Thrymheim will arise to the next world...your world, Álfheimr.

Klein:
Wha---Hold the phone! You're telling us that once they're done here, and go up to destroy Alne?

Urðr:
Yes, that is their intention. King Thrymr will seal Álfheimr in ice and continue on, until he reaches the top of Yggdrasil. Once he reaches it, he will take the golden apple growing there.
Thrymr and his Generals have growing frustrated by the time it is taking to wipe out my kinfolk. So, they have turned to your people, the Fairies, for assistance in their murderous plot. Your kind hands our kinfolk extinction, moved by the offer of Excalibur as a reward...However, King Thrymr cannot bestow that sword unto others. For as Excalibur ever leaves Thrymheim, the blessings of Yggdrasil will return to this land, and their castle will vanished as the mist on the meadow...

Lizbeth:
Bu---But...Then, er, What kind of the quest is in reward for, it's a total lie? How are they gonna way with it!?

Urðr:
Most likely, your reward the victor a sword called Caliburn, whose appearance is identical to Excalibur.

Leafa:
But, ug...that's cheating! If he was a king, doesn't he have a Code of Honor?

Urðr:
Unfortunately, cheating and falsehoods are Thrymr's most powerful assets. However, he has made one grate mistake...In his eagerness to slaughter my kin, he has sent a number of his giants down from Thrymheim. To marshal your kind for battle. At this moment, the defenses of his castle are weaker than they have ever been.

Kirito:
There's a shot...

(Urðr leveled her right arm, generating light from her hand and materialized an object, passes it to Leafa. The object has large emerald stone on it's center)

Urðr:
Once the stone in the amulet turns black, it will mean all my kinfolk have been slain, and my powers have left of me.
Good fairies, infiltrate Thrymheim, remove Excalibur from its plinth, and save my realm.

("Quest accepted." The words popped up above Urðr. The quest's name was Holy Sword of the Frozen Palace. The quest started)

Urðr:
...I am counting on you, good fairies.



(Tonky was bringing Kirito and his party to upside-down pyramid stuck out from ceiling, Thrymheim)

Tonky:
Rroooar...

Leafa:
This is turning into a bigger deal than we thought...

Sinon:
Is this still considered a quest? Because it's kind a turned into something way more epic than plain old quest. You heard her, she said if the creatures in this world get killed off, the Frost Giant will take off the surface next.

Kirito:
Yeah, I know. But I doubt that admins would look that happen, It would some kind of update or warning or something. I mean, normally, they'd let players know we get ahead a time.

Leafa:
Whatever, we're gonna finish this quest for Tonky. Right, Kazuto?

Kirito:
You know it. We were gonna storm the castle, grab Excalibur, anyway. It'll be easier if the castle's defenses are down. Helping Tonky and his friends out, that's a bonus.

Klein:
Here we go! Guys, our last big quest of the year! Let's bang this thing and scores the spot on the front page of MMO Tomorrow!

Everyone:
Yeah!

(Tonky entered into the castle, the huge gate appeared in front of their way)

Leafa:
Don't you worry, Tonky. We'll get your home back for you. It'll be good as new. Promise!

Kirito:
...Here we go.
