  Death Gun:
With that name, and your sword skills... Are you the real deal, or what?

Kirito:
... (In his mind) If he knows me, I should know him...! That's it! He's an SAO survivor! ...Who is he? And, where did we meet in SAO?

Death Gun:
Answer the question. Or, don't you understand?

Kirito:
No, I don't. What do you mean by real deal?

Death Gun:
Never mind. Whether you're a fake using his name, or the real guy, someday, I'll kill you.



(Kirito sat in the booth alone. Rather, he crouched down. A cold sweat run down on his face)

Kirito:
(In his mind) Laughing Coffin... Meaning I'm the one on the list belongs to the murderer guild from SAO...? Laughing Coffin. God knows how many players they killed in their time. But, they are not only ones guilty on the murder...

(Kirito reminisces when his party raided the hide of Laughing Coffin)

Man A(Kiroto's side):
If the tip we've got is good, we should be near by Laughing Coffin's base! Before we charge in, let's keep one thing in mind! Those guys are red players! Once the battle start, they are not gonna think twice about killing any one of us! So, don't you hesitate! You do, and you're dead! We've got two things going for us, though. We are numbered on them, and we've got higher skill levels. So, who knows, maybe they surrender peacefully. Hell, I can't dream, can he?

(Suddenly, Men wearing black food attacked from above the cave)

Man A(Kiroto's side):
Umm... Damn it! Some one must leaked a plan to these bustards!

(Kirito was crossing swords with Laughing Coffin members)

Man B(member of Laughing Coffin):
Nn, he-he...

Kirito:
(In his mind) They caught us off-guard, but we regrouped in time. We can do this!

Man C(Kirito's side):
We are outnumbered! Surrender, or else!

Man A(Kiroto's side):
Come on! Drop your sword!

Man C(Kirito's side):
Do it! You can't take another hit!

Man A(Kiroto's side):
Drop the sword, Now!

Man D(member of Laughing Coffin):
Hee...hee... Yyeah!

...

Kirito:
(In his mind) It turned into a blood soaked nightmare after that. We won the battle. But, by the time fight is over, we've lost ten of ours. As for Laughing Coffin, twenty of them refused surrender and were killed. Out of that twenty, two lives were claimed by my sword.

(The scene returned back to the basement in present time)

Kirito:
(In his mind) That guy, if he is one of the survivors from Laughing Coffin, then he must have talked to me at some point after that battle. Or, maybe, he's one of the two people I killed...? No! That's impossible... That's crazy...!

(Kirito reminds the voice that came from his PC)

Death Gun:
(From PC speakers) The name I share with this weapon... Death Gun!

Kirito:
...! (In his mind) Oh my god! His voice was as same as Death Gun's!
Was that him? Could he be... Death Gun?

(Then, Sinon patted Kirito's shoulder)

Sinon:
You look like you're about lose it?

Kirito:
eh... am, No. I'm OK.

Sinon:
Guess, the first match was tougher than thought. You got pretty early, though. Not to shabby for newb.

Kirito:
(Deep sigh)

Sinon:
God, if you're like this after one match, you'll never make it to the finals. You better man up, guy? Remember. We've got things to settle.

(Sinon punches Kirito's shoulder. Kirito grabs her hand)

Sinon:
Hey! Let go!
...What's wrong with you? Are you O... eh.

(Kirito's body started to dematerialize. His next match began. Right after the match commenced, opponent's gunfire showered to Kirito. But, he stood still. Then, suddenly he burst into run to his opponent as if he's determined, or resigned something inside his mind. The photon sword in his right arm glosses its purple light blade)

Kirito:
Rrraaahhh!

(Kirito, barely dodging bullets burst from the machine gun, ran straight close to his opponent)

Spectator:
That player got a death wish? or what...?

Spiegel:
Hmm...

Sinon:
Huh...

(Kirito advances his step forward while he cut off opponent's shots. He jumped up, and land near the back of his opponent. Kirito slashes opponent's gun, and his body)

Spectators:
Oooh!
Ha ha ha...!

Spiegel:
Huh, I can't believe he keeps winning with fighting like that. His next match is his semi finals.
...Yours is too. So, get out of them and rock. Good luck.

(Sinon keeps watching the screen. There, in the screen, Kirito stands still in the field alone)



(Sinon is looking through the scope of her rifle, with a prominent muzzle brake, PGM Hecate II)

Sinon:
(In her mind) Stinger's my target. His main weapon is an FN SCAR carbine rifle. As a sniper, if I let him get too close, I'm done for her. But on this map, if he wants closing on me, he's gonna have to go through there... And that's where all take him out.

(Sinon reminds her hand grabbed by Kirito when they rode a buggy, his bewildered face, and so on)
Agh... Damn him...

(A shadow moved on the road. Sinon shot it. But, it was not an opponent. She failed. The opponent's car drove through fast the road it was the shooting point that Sinon prepared for it)

Sinon:
He wanted me waste my first shot to buy him time so he could advance.
...Too bad for him, cause I know the path my first bullet took. My second one will right, on, target...!

(Sinon succeeded to hit the opponent. He vanished in the car)

Sinon:
...You should get out of the car, buddy. If you did, you might've seen the bullet line in time to dodge it.



(Sinon is waiting in the black space. The final match of preliminary is going to start in a minute. The screen displays the players' name who will fight the match. Those are Sinon and Kirito's. The match began. Sinon rode into the ruined bus to hide and wait to her opponent)

Sinon:
(In her mind) He's gonna try closing on me... using a shadow for cover. My only chance is nail him with the first shot before he figures out of my location. He won't even know when it hit him. ...What's my problem? Why do I wanna beat him so bad? ...ah. It's because he reminds of me?
...!

(Sinon perceives Kirito walking ahead of her. He simply walks. No photon sword in his hand. Not hide any place to protect him from her snipe)

Sinon:
(In her mind) Does he think he can dodge my bullet? at this range!?
Ugh...
Does he even want to...!?

(Sinon can't focus to him. The bullet circle, the representation of the accuracy of the player's shot in GGO, is beating unquietly)

Sinon:
Don't... Don't!
Don't screw with me!

(Sinon's shot missed her opponent, Kirito. After the first shot, Kirito merely stand there, as if he is waiting Sinon shoot him. Sinon misses her shot several times. Sinon gets out of the ruined bus, runs to where Kirito stand by)

Sinon:
Fight me. Come on! Fight! You maybe you think I'm not the worth of the effort!

Kirito:
You've got it all wrong... All I want is competing in the final. There's no reason to fight anymore.

Sinon:
Then, go on and shoot yourself to get it over with! Who with that is a waste of ammo. Or may be you wanted me to shoot you because you thought with even the score between us! To you, it's just a game, just one stupid match! That's all it is to you. That is, a game! Well, just because you'll be allow doesn't mean I do!

Kitito:
Ah!

(In Kitito's mind, he reminds that Sinon said before)
Sinon:
But... If we do meet in the final bracket in the prelims... I'll be playing to win.

Kirito:
Oh, ...I get it. Alright. If we both make it, no holding back.

Kirito:
...I'm sorry. What I did was wrong. Sure, it's a game. It's only one match. But, still, that's why we have to give it all we've got. It's why we're here. It's how we live, how we keep surviving. If anyone should've known that, it's me... Sinon, give me a chance to make a right with you. Let me give you the fight I promised.

Sinon:
I swear if you messed up with me...

(Kirito took out his handgun, picked out a bullet round)

Kirito:
You got any bullet on you, or you are out?

Sinon:
Yeah, I got one.

Kirito:
OK, then, let's have the duel. Here's the rules. We stand ten meters apart. You, with your rifle. And, me, with my sword. I'll toss this bullet up. When it hits the ground, we start. What do you say?

Sinon:
Hang on... If we were ten meters away from each other, it won't give you enough time to see the bullet line in react. And, with my Hecate, I'll definitely hit you. With that range, I can't miss.

Kirito:
You won't know for sure to you try.

Sinon:
(In her mind) Why's he acting so confident...? Does he have a plan or something...? Whatever it is, I'm ready for it.
Okay. If that how you want it. Let's go.

(Kirito moved to stand his place. Sinon rearmed her ammo, then aimed Kirito with her rifle)

Sinon:
(In her mind) I knew it. He does have a plan...

Kirito:
'Kay, get set!

(Kirito tosses up the bullet. He get his photon sword in his right hand. He switched on the sword. He lowered his body, to ready in action. The bullet slowly dropped to the ground. When it hits the ground, Sinon shoots her Hacate. Kirito swings his sword. The sword cut the projectile that shot from her rifle into two pieces)

Sinon:
(In her mind) No way! That's impossible!
Ugh...!

(Sinon loses her balance. While she trying to pick up her handgun to cover her, Kirito has enough time getting close to her. He thrusts his sword before Sinon's neck. He holds her body so she won't fall down)

Sinon:
You knew where I was aiming... But, how? How do you know I was going for your leg?

Kirito:
I knew because I could see your eye, through the lens of your scope.

Sinon:
...! (In her mind) That's how he predicted my bullet's path...!? That's amazing... That kind of power is way beyond in any be our game!
If you're so strong you can do that, why you look so afraid before?

Kirito:
You're wrong. It's not strength. All it is a skill.

Sinon:
No! It's not! Techniques enough cut bullet from my Hecate in half. You and I both know that. It takes strength. And all I want to know is how to get it...! It's what I... It's what I'm here to figure it out...

Kirito:
Listen... Could you shoot a player in here, if you knew in the real world, that player would die from it? And, what if you had to kill that player, 'cause if you didn't, your someone in love will die instead. If you had that power, could you still pull that trigger?

Sinon:
(In her mind) ...Does he know? About what happen to me that day? Maybe... something like that happened him too.
Ah!

Kirito:
I can't go through that again. ...So, I'm not as strong as you think I am. I don't know the name of the two, no, three people that I killed in another game. I have to live with it, every single day. And, everyday I keep hoping I'll forget.

(Sinon tried to reach her left hand to Kirito's right cheek, to console him. Kirito softly declined her act)

Kirito:
I'm fine. Anyway, I guess I won the duel, doesn't it?

Sinon:
Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess...

Kirito:
Well, would you mind surrendering then? I'm not big fun to assassinate girls.

Sinon:
Huh?

(Sinon notices, this whole time, Kirito embraced her with his left hand in her waist. Out of embarrassment, Sinon push Kirito aside)

Sinon:
Next time, I'm not gonna lose! See you in the finals! And, make sure you are still alive until you see me again! Hmph. Resign!



(A fanfare announces to spectators that Kirito is the winner of the final game of the prelims. Spiegel gasps in surprise. At the back in the room, Death Gun stands alone and watches the duel. His eyes glow red)
