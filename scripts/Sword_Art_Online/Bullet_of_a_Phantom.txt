  (GGO. Kirito was out of the cave. He opened his map, and received data from the satellite. The coordinates of the other players displayed on his map)

Kirito:
Huh, there is no one any of near us.
(In mind) Death Gun and Sinon aren't on map. For counting them... the six players left.
Huh?

(Two icons being near each other lost their colors at the same time)

Kirito:
They took each other out...? That leaves four.

(The map counted up dead count. It shows 24 now)

Kirito:
Thirty players started, twenty-four out, so that leaves six. Me, and Yamikaze, and Sinon, and Death Gun. That's twenty-eight. Pale Rider makes it twenty-nine. We are short of player...? Does Death Gun murder someone else, after he got Pale Rider? No, his partner's been waiting at Sinon's for his kill. It can't be two places at once. Unless... there's another angle to this I'm missing...?



(Kirito returned to the cave)

Sinon:
Well, what do you find?

Kirito:
There's five of us left. You, me, Yamikaze, I didn't see Death Gun, though. And there's another player out there somewhere. The scan didn't pick them up. So, they might've hide in a cave like us.

Sinon:
That's it? Just us five? ...Well, it's been an hour and forty-five minutes already. Seeing that how the last BoB ended in about two hours, this one's right on schedule. Ha, I'm surprised no one's checked and grenaded here yet.

Kirito:
Yeah, maybe we've got Death Gun to thank for that. Could be worries to come for us, he swept off down competition by that rifle of his.

Sinon:
If you're right, then he's for sure for the max kills award. Whatever, we should worry about Yamikaze. You were probably the only one who showed up on his terminal, so we better get ready, because he'll be coming for ya.

Kirito:
'He any good?

Sinon:
He was running up the last BoB. He's a typical forlorn AGI type. They call him "The Run-Gun Daemon" or something.

Kirito:
Er... Run-what?

Sinon:
Running gun. You run, shoot, run. It's a style of combat. His main weapon is Calico M900A. An ultra light sub machine gun. Yamikaze couldn't compete with XeXeeD's rare gun and armor in the last tourney. But, even though he didn't win, some people say he's a better player.

Kirito:
Wow... he's really that good? Let the best player on Japan's GGO server good?

Sinon:
Yeah, he is. And he might be an ace in a whole too. If you're right about Death Gun, and I'm only the one he's ready to kill, you know, because his partner's waiting back at my apartment right now? See, I figure, if that's the case, Yamikaze isn't real danger of getting killed, this is gonna sound cold, but I was thinking he would make the perfect decoy for us. When Death Gun shoot Yamikaze, we'll know where he is. In a way, we got two decoys. Him and here, and me, I along[?].

Kirito:
You're pretty brave, Sinon.

Sinon:
Huh? Not even. I'm trying not to think about it. Trying to avoid it scares me, like I always do. Anyway, you think it would work?

Kirito:
Yeah. I mean it sounds pretty good. Although, there's still one thing that bothers me... Just now, when I added up players one left who are done, I could only come up with twenty eight. Pale Rider's twenty-nine, but still, we are short of one.

Sinon:
No way! Could Death Gun have killed someone else after he tried for me? How's that even possible? I mean, his no.2 supposed to be waiting at my place now.

Kirito:
Right. That's how I figured out it too. But now, I'm thinking something else's going on... Between the time Death Gun shot Pale Rider and one he tried for you, only thirty minutes were gone by. So, based on my theory, Pale Rider's apartment was have to be no more than 30 minutes away from your place, that's kind of convenient, don't you think?

Sinon:
I guess, but what other explanation is there for it?

Kirito:
Maybe, Death Gun isn't working with just a one guy, like, maybe he's got few more partners... If he does, then, it'll be possible to kill one player, or still have someone available to kill you. And one, for Yamikaze. He could be a target now, too. I don't know, how know...

Sinon:
...! Oh my god...! If you're right, there's more of them there!? How many more we're talking about!

Kirito:
If they're all ex-Laughing Coffin, at least ten. Maybe more... I doubt they're all involved with this, but we can't be sure there's only one real world killer out there anymore.

Sinon:
That crazy! Why else would they do this after getting out of SAO alive!? How could anyone stay up player killer after that game!

Kirito:
For the same reason with us. Why do I keep being swordsman, and you, a sniper.

Sinon:
I called them PKers, but I take it back. There are lots of people who PKing in this game. I used to run with squad of PKers myself. But, at the end of the day, PKers have a code of honor they stick to. They'er not PKers. They kill people with poison on unconscious, like a bunch of cowards. There's no honor in murder. That's chicken shit! Straight up, and we can't let them get away with it.

Kirito:
No, we can't. We've got the chance to stop these people, and we're gonna take it. Death Gun's going down on this battle field. It's over for him and his pals. I'll make 'em all pay. Yeah... this is how I make amends for what I did... For losing in the chaos of the battle. For killing those two players that night, and the other one the later on. This is how I'll get closure... I'll protect Sinon, take out Yamikaze, and end Death Gun. It won't be easy, but it's what I have to do.

Sinon:
I'm in taking Yamikaze out. I won't let Death Gun kill him.

Kirito:
Huh?

Sinon:
Yamikaze is tough. I doubt even you could finish him out with one hit. And if he busy with you, Death Gun'll shoot for him.

Kirito:
Then, how are we gonna do with that?

Sinon:
Did you forget what I am? I'm a sniper. I'll have eyes on you the whole time, so once they move on you, I'll know their locations. I'll hit Yamikaze first, then, I'll go for Death Gun.

Kirito:
Okay, then ...We go with your plan.
Alright. I think they should pretty close by now. I'm on the hop on the buggy in head out. Leave the cave either after I do. And, get set up as fast as you can.

Sinon:
Good luck out there, partner.

(Kirito and Sinon fist bumped, exchanged smiles each other)




(Out of a cave, evening desert. Sinon was at a roughly built watch tower on a rock. She was setting up her position, adjusting her rifle scope)

Sinon:
Yamikaze's coming from the west, so the shot comes from the east would probably be Death Gun's. He's got that cloak, so when he shoot, he'll be invisible. If he hits Kirito in heart or head, it's over. But, if you can cut my bullet you have, you can dodge his, right? Right, Kirito? My first priority is taking Yamikaze out of the picture. If I miss, Kirito will get shot. Then Death Gun will find me, and kill me. My life, my real life, depends on a single bullet, like I did that day... Please, Hecate... I'm weak. I need your strength. The strength to stand up by myself! And move on...!

(Kirito was gazing up the sky, the full moon. Kirito closed his eyes, steadied down his breath. Then, he heard every movement around him)

Kirito:
South west... That's Yamikaze... Don't worry... Sinon's got him.

Sinon:
Wow!

Yamikaze:
Humph!

(Yamikaze's speed was faster than Sinon expected. Perhaps he notices something, he sped up more)

Sinon:
What would I do...? I could tried to shoot in front of him, when shoot at his feet, hope he panicked, and then empty come out.
...No. Once he's got Kirito in range, he'll stop to steady his aim... I have to wait til he does... I'll be patient. Don't worry Kirito. I've got your back.

(Kirito was standing still. The wind direction changed. His long hair swayed from his back to his front)

Kirito:
Concentrate... Omen of his drive to kill... Like a last time... That's right. I could feel their lust for murder... That's how I noticed him... The first guy who attacked me... What was his name...?

(In his imagination, in SAO, when he raided by Laughing Coffin, someone slashed at him. The man in cloak talked to Kirito)

Man in cloak:
Kirito... someday, I'll kill you...properly.

Kirito:
...Ah!

(Kirito felt hear someone's voice. He looked around him)

Man in cloak:
Someday, I'll kill you...properly.

(Some projectile plunged with blistering speed to shooting through Kirito's head. Kirito dodged the bullet with a hairbreadth wide. The shot hit the tall rock behind him. It's top part crumbled and fall down to the ground. In that direction, Kirito noticed Yamikaze standing there)

Kirito:
Yamikaze.

(Soon, Kirito turned his focus into the other direction of Yamikaze. The bullet line was capturing him. Kirito turned on his photon sword, rushed into where the bullet line came from)

Kirito:
Raaahhh!

(Yamikaze hid himself behind the rock, to wait and see where Kirito heading to. Sinon, was waiting for the chance she could snipe Yamikaze, pulled her trigger. The bullet shot through Yamikaze's chest, brings him a instant death)

Sinon:
Kirito...!

(Her scope followed to where Kirito heading. She captured Death Gun, who laid down on the ground and shooting his rifle to stop Kirito)

Sinon:
Gotya!

(The moment Sinon aimed at Death Gun, exposed her bullet line to him, Death Gun changed his target to Sinon. They both triggered off their rifles simultaneously. Their bullets crossed very near almost grazed each other. Both hit opponent's rifle scopes. Death Gun abandoned his rifle)

Sinon:
...It's up to you now, Kirito.

(Kirito was dashing toward Death Gun)

Kirito:
She did it. Now, it's my turn!

(Death Gun crawled out from the place he hid. He got some weapon, put himself into a posture to face Kirito)

Kirito:
Hm! Rraaahhh!

(Kirito assaulted Death Gun. Death Gun drew his rapier like weapon. He nimbly dodged Kirito's attack, then stubbed Kirito's right shoulder)

Kirito:
Agh...!

Sinon:
Kirito!



(Hospital, in the elevator. Asuna was heading to where Kirito was sleeping. A smartphone was in her hand, enables her to communicate with Yui)

Yui:
Don't worry mammy. No matter how strong enemy is, daddy won't lose. He's daddy after all!

Asuna:
Nn, yeah, you're right.

Yui:
Turn left! His room is eight meters down!

(Asuna rushed into the room, where Kirito laid down on the bed. He was panting. Aki, a nurse, standing aside him)

Aki:
Kirigaya!?

Asuna:
Kirito!

Aki:
Wouldn't you this Yuuki, right? We've been expecting you.

Asuna:
Is something wrong with Ki--- I mean, Kazuto?

Aki:
No, he's OK. I know it looks bad, but he's not in danger. His heart beat spikes is all.

Asuna:
His heart beat...?
Why? What's going on?

Yui:
Mommy, Look to your right! At the monitor on the wall! I'm going to patch in the live footage from MMO stream.

(On the wall, the monitor started showing BoB match. In the display, Kirito and Death Gun faced to each other)

Asuna:
Is that... Kirito?

Aki:
That's Kirigaya's avater? from the game he's diving in now?

Asuna:
Uh-huh... he's in battle. I think that's why his heart beat raise so much. ...?
An estoc...? ...! That's it! One of Laughing Coffin's leaders was the master of the estoc! But, what was he called...?

(Asuna looked at Death Gun's name plate that displayed on the monitor. The name was "Sterben")

Asuna:
S---sterben? ...Isn't it supposed to be "Steven?"

Aki:
...It's not.

Yui:
She's right.

Aki:
It's a German word. I know it. It's a medical term we use... It's pronounced, "shu-tár-bun."

Asuna:
Shutar...bun?

Aki:
It means, to die. In hospitals, we used that word when a patient past away.

Asuna:
Kirito...



(GGO. Kirito and Death Gun are facing each other. Those camera saucers are floating around them)

Kirito:
Hmph! That's an interesting weapon you've got there. If I'd known where the metal swords in GGO, I would've got my hands on one.

Death Gun:
You should've done your homework before logging in, black swordsman. I made this with a weapon creation skill. It can't be any longer or heavier, but it does the trick.

Kirito:
Wow, if that's the best sword I can make, then I guess I couldn't make one I be happy with.

Death Gun:
Still, into a swords with high strength requirements? You haven't changed. Must be pretty tough for you, having the toy of that flash light around.

Kirito:
This thing's not as bad as all that. I always wondered what it be like fight with one of these. Besides, a sword's a sword. Fight and slash your HP with it, it's good enough for me.

Death Gun:
Ha ha... You talk a good game. But, it's all talk. You sucked in too much rotten air from the real world. That half-ass vorpal strike you just pulled, if old you saw, it'll shake his head.

Kirito:
Maybe so, but the same goes for you, too. You're living in the past. I bet you think you're still member of Laughing Coffin.

Death Gun:
You remember? I'm impressed. Then, I guess you understand the difference between you and me. I'm a genuine red player. Well, you... are not.
...You killed only because you're scared. Scared, and desperate to survive. And, instead to facing it, haven't you tried to forget it even happen? Just, like a coward.

Kirito:
...I might be a coward, but still, I'll stop you from killing again. I figured out how XeXeeD and the others were murdered. It's got nothing doing with that handgun of yours. And, you don't have special powers either.

Death Gun:
How those people die, then?

Kirito:
Back at the terminal at the governor's office, you used that cloak to scope out addresses of BoB contestants. Then, you had someone breaking their apartments, and timed it when you fired, they'd injected drug into them, making it look like they died in heart failure. That's how you did it. The Ministry of Internal affairs has the in-game and real-world info of every single player from SAO. What's they get your handle? They'll find out your real name, your real address, and all the evil shit you've ever done. It's only matter of time. It's all over for you. So, log out, and turn yourself in!

Death Gun:
You think you've got all figured out... But, you don't. And, you can't stop me... Want to know why? Because I know you'll never remember what my handle was.

Kirito:
You think so? What makes so sure I won't!?

Death Gun:
Ha ha ha ha... You don't even remember the reason you forgot in the first place. Think back, after that battle between your group and mine, I tried to tell you my name. But, you said... "There's no point in giving your name. And, I don't wanna know it. As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see you again." You can't remember my handle, and you never will. I never gave it to you. And, now I'm going to cut you down. I'll leave you lie in here watching helplessly as I killed the girl. ...And, you can't stop me!

(Death Gun suddenly moved to attack Kirito. His estoc stabbed Kirito's armor)

Death Gun:
Huhuhu... Steams, doesn't it? This is made from the best metal you can get in the game. It's armor plating... from a space battleship. Huhuhu... Hahaha...!

(Death Gun's rushing to Kirito. Kirito couldn't respond to his attack. He was at the mercy of Death Gun)
