  (Morning. Kazuto(Kirito) and his sister, Suguha(Leafa), sat at their dining table)

Suguha(Leafa):
Kazuto~? Nfufuï½ž

Kazuto(Kirito):
Eh... Okay. What's with that goofy grin...?

Suguha:
Well. This morning I just so happened to see this interesting article. And then I noticed... that.

Kazuto:
Oh, hee-hee... Wow. What is the odds. Someone's gotta similar handle...

Suguha:
Yeah... Except this isn't similar, this's exactly the same!

Kazuto:
If you're gonna put that way, yeah, I guess... Although, that name isn't that unusual... I mean, mine's an abbreviation. Maybe the Kirito in GGO's name is, Kiri... Kirigamine! Yeah, Toguro Kirigamine! or something... Ha...
(munch munch) Better eat up, or It's gonna get cold.



Kazuto:
(In his mind) Who is he...? He's gotta be one of the survivor from SAO. And, that's not all. We must fought some point, and I bet we would try to kill each other.

Suguha:
Kazuto. You're making up that scary face again.

Kazuto:
Hope it's not scary unusual. Ha ha ha...

Suguha:
Look. I already know everything. I know you've converted Kirito from ALO to GGO. So, just drop the act already. OK?

Kazuto:
Uh...

Suguha:
Come on. Did you honestly think I wouldn't notice when you suddenly vanished from my friend list?

Kazuto:
I didn't think you checked it at every five minutes.

Suguha:
I don't, I just knew. Last night, I got this weird feeling and checked my list. When I saw you weren't on it. I headed over the room, and about the bust the door down. I didn't, because I knew it piss you off something fears. I also knew you'll never quit ALO without telling me. I figured that you must have good reasons... so I called Asuna up to if she knew anything.

Kazuto:
You did...huh.

(Kazuto reminisces a chatting with Asuna on the phone the other night)

Asuna:
Sorry. I hope I'm not calling you too late.

Kazuto:
It's OK. I wasn't sleepy. Besides, I ...eh, never mind.

Asuna:
Honestly... You started to say something, so just go ahead and say it!

Kazuto:
I guess... I guess I was just thinking about how... I'd like to hear your voice.

Asuna:
That wasn't so hard. ...What's wrong?

Kazuto:
Nothing's wrong. Long day.

Asuna:
Date something happen in the game you've converted over to?

Kazuto:
eh... Nothing happened. It's just...

Asuna:
hmph. If the new job's so reloading you, I can help.

Kazuto:
Thanks for offering. I got it. though, besides, you've converted over, Yui'll get lonely.

Asuna:
Are you sure you alright?

Kazuto:
Yeah, I'll be back before you know it.

Asuna:
If you need me, call. OK?

Kazuto:
Will do. ...Good night.

Asuna:
Good night.

Kazuto:
(In his mind) I can't drag Asuna into this. That guy'll sure to show him up to the BoB's main tournaments. I have to end this. This is my problem, not hers.

Suguha:
Kazuto.

(Suguha patted Kazuto's shoulder. Kazuto was brought back from his reminiscence)

Suguha:
Oh, well, Asuna told me. She said not too worry, because once you tore up GGO, you'll be back. She didn't say it, but I knew she was really worried about you. That makes two of us. Last night, you got a home so early. When I saw your face, I wanted to say something because you looked of freaked out...

Kazuto:
I did? ...sorry.

Suguha:
I hope you are not doing anything crazy. Because, if you are, I couldn't bare it if something happen to you.

Kazuto:
I'm gonna be fine. I promise. Tonight's the last night of GGO's tourney. and after that, I'll be back, to ALO, and here.

Suguha:
uh...

Kazuto:
I'll be back no matter what. So, don't be worry. Okay?

Suguha:
'kay.
Oh. I almost forgot!

Kazuto:
What?

Suguha:
When I was talking to Asuna, she just so happens to tell me that you are gonna get a huge check for this new gig!

Kazuto:
Eh... T-That's right. And... when I get back, I'll treat you something cool!

Suguha:
Seriously!? In that case, there's this awesome new nano carbon shinai I have my eye on!

Kazuto:
Oh, okay... sure, you've got it...



(A park. Shino is kicking a metal pole of swings)

Shino:
That dumbass! ...He pisses me off!
I'm so mad, I could kill him!

Shinkawa:
Take it easy Asada...? I know you're upset, but... It's weird to see you this worked up.

Shino:
He is some... He's obnoxious. He's cocky. And, he's dirty liar. He thinks he's such a big shot fighting with a sword, in GGO! about places... He tricked me, and I was thinking him was a girl, and had me take him to the gun market! I even have him to pick out his gear! He thinks I'm an idiot! OH! MAN! UH! REALLY PISSES ME OFF! ...What's that look for?

Shinkawa:
Nothing. I mean, it's just a, like, you are acting kind a strange. I don't think you've ever talked this much about someone else before.

Shino:
You're kidding. Really?

Shinkawa:
Yeah. I mean, you don't usually let people get you. You know, like, this.

Shino:
I get like this, when, people push my buttons.

Shinkawa:
Nn, yeah, I guess you do. ...I know! How about we find the field in the game to ambush him!?

Shino:
Huh?

Shinkawa:
Yeah! I can lure him out, and then, you can snipe him! Although, if you wanna get him back, you probably wanna take him head on. Either way, I know I can find a couple of machine guns to back you up, if you want.

Shino:
Thank you but, Nn-nh. I've had something else in mind. It's like, yeah, he pisses me off, but when in fights, at least he was honorable about it. Unless I beat him fair and square, it won't mean anything. And, today's final, I'm gonna blow a hole through that dumb avatar of his is the last thing I do!

(Shino reminds last match with Kirito)
Kirito:
Would you mind surrendering then? I'm not big fun to assassinate girls.

Shino:
Uggggh... Ah!

(Shino shapes her right hand into a gun, pointing to a clock that stand in the park)

Shino:
Just you wait! I swear I'm gonna pay you back double for what you do to me...!
Wha...? What's wrong?

Shinkawa:
Nothing. It's, it's just a... You see what you are doing?

Shino:
Huh? Wow, I don't even noticed. I guess it didn't bother me because I'm so mad.

Shinkawa:
Oh. ...Asada!

(Shinkawa holds Shino's hand)

Shino:
What, wait! What are you doing? What's the matter!?

Shinkawa:
I'm worried about you. That's what. You're not ...acting like usual self today.

Shino:
Oh... Wh-what do you mean? How do I usually act...?

Shinkawa:
As long as I've known you, you've been cool, calm, level headed. Nothing gets to you. You've got the same problem at the school as me, but you didn't run away like I did. You are, like, really strong!

Shino:
But, I-I'm not strong at all... You know that. I-I'll get freaked out whenever I see a gun...

Shinkawa:
But, Sinon doesn't. She's got that amazing rifle and know how to use it! If, if you ask me, that's who you really are. And I know one day, you'll be like that in real life too. That's why... when you go ballistic over that guy, I-I start to worry...
I see you lose it like that, I wanna help you! I-I'll do anything to help you!

Shino:
(In her mind) I remember... I used to be normal. Once, I laughed and cried, just like anyone else... I didn't become who am I now because I wanted to...
...ah!

(Shinkawa hugs Shino)

Shinkawa:
Asada...

Shino:
...!

(Shino strongly refused Shinkawa, and pushed him back)

Shino:
ha... I'm sorry. I really appreciate you want into help me... Especially, since you are the only one in the city who really understand what I'm going through... But, I... I'm just out ready to be anyone's girlfriend yet... Besides, I, I can't really fix what's bothering me. I must do it on my own.

Shinkawa:
I see...

Shino:
Until then, do you think you can wait for me...?

Shinkawa:
(nod)

Shono:
Thank you...



(In his dream, Kirito was fighting against Laughing Coffin again. He finished the one of them. then, Death Gun appeared)
Death Gun:
With that name, and your sword skills... Are you the real deal, or what?
Are you Kirito...?

(Continuously, several dead men, it seemed they were all killed by Kirito, appeared in his dream, and questioned him. They shed tears of blood)

Dead Man:
Are you Kirito...?

Three Dead Men:
Are you Kirito?

Another Dead Man:
Are you Kirito!?

(In town, day. Kirito rode a bike to go to hospital)

Aki:
What's the matter, kiddo? You look like you've seen a ghost.

Kirito:
Oh... no. It's nothing.

Aki:
You've gotta super hot nurse here, offering free counseling. And, you're gonna passed up? Come on. Tell me what's bothering you.

Kirito:
Well, since pretty that way, I guess I don't really have a choice, do I?
um... Before you came the rehab unit, you're in trauma. That's right?

Aki:
That I was.

Kirito:
I've gotta... personal question. And, if you don't wanna answer, I totally understand. Of all the patients you've cared for, can you remember the ones who died?

Aki:
Let's see... I guess I have think about it. I can recall their faces and names, even patients I only spent an hour, or so with, in OR. Uh-huh, I remember.

Kirito:
Do you ever wish you could just forget those people?

Aki:
Hmm... That's a tough one. Not to you, this is an answer, but it's the best I've got. I guess, I think of something's meant to be forgotten. A person will under forgetting it, without even thinking they want to. That said, the more person they wishes could forget something, the stronger memory becomes, til they can stop thinking about it. And, if that's the case, then maybe subconsciously, whatever the memory is, it's something that... shouldn't be forgotten.

Kirito:
Then if I forgot, I must be a monster.
When I was stacking in SAO, I took out... no, I kill three people. They were all red players, so murder who was their business. And, I could overpowered them instead to kill them, but... I went ahead of kill them anyway. I did it out of rage, hatred, revenge. And over the past year, I've totally forgotten all about those people. Even as I sit here talking about it, I can't remember what two of them look like, or what their names were. How's that possible? If I can forget people I killed, what's that say about me, a person?

Aki:
I'm sorry, Kirigaya. I guess I'm not the awesome counselor I thought I was. I wish I could take away the burden you're carrying, or at least share the load of it. What do I know, I've never even played Sword Art Online. When you say you killed someone, I don't know what that means. But, there's one thing I know. When all settled down, the reason you did what you did... was to save someone else, wasn't it? ...In the medical field, sometimes we have to choose who to save. It doesn't make the decision to let someone die any easier. But still, in a life and death situation, everyone's got the right to consider the people they can save. Over those, they can't. Even you, just think about the lives, about the people you've saved. And make peace with your decision.

Kirito:
I don't know... I'd wanna believe you, but... I can't! I kill people! I killed them. I can't even remember who they were! Don't you get it! It's like I don't even care lots of dead! I don't deserved to find any peace!

(Aki hugs Kirito so she can pacify him)

Aki:
...If you didn't care what you did, you wouldn't be suffering like this.
Deep down, you remember. And, when the time's right, it'll all come back to you. When it does, and it will. Just you make sure remember, all the people who are alive today because you were there to protect them.

(Kirito remembered Asuna, when he fought to protect her in SAO, when he call her the other night)
Asuna:
If you need me, call. OK?



(Kirito lays in the bed, is preparing to dive into GGO. Aki operates some apparatus to monitor Kirito's body condition)

Kirito:
Um... Thank you. You know, for the pep talk.

Aki:
Sure. I'm glad I can help.

Kirito:
I don't think anything will happen to after eight o'clock. I should be out a ten by the latest. Well, here I go.

Aki:
Okeydoke! Bon voyage, you superstar! do you?

Kirito:
Ugh... Link start!



(Shino lays in bed. She is reminiscing today's event, that about Shinkawa)

Shinkawa:
Asada...

Shino:
Nn-nh. ...Okay!
(In her mind) I'm in a fight hard. And I... will... beat him.
Link start!



(ALO. Klein and his party are fighting against huge lizard like monster)

Klein:

Silica:

Klein:

Lisbeth:

Klein:

Silica:

Lisbeth:

Leafa:

(They slaughtered the monster)

Asuna:

Klein:
No, it's all good. No harm, no fail. Right?

Lisbeth:
Yeah. Today's a boy's big day.

Silica:
That's right! Kirito's tournament. It's gonna start soon.

Leafa:
I don't know about you guys, but I'd say we quit early, and get over to a room to watch it!

Klein:
I see we use our cash we scored today to buy beer and snacks!

Lisbeth:
Do you honestly think we are gonna let you blow our money on food?

Klein:
Hee hee hee...

Yui:
Don't you worry, mommy! Daddy's gonna win today! You'll see!

Asuna:
Surely well. No matter where he goes, Kirito knows how to handle himself.

Lisbeth:
Hey guys, we don't wanna miss for first match. So, let's start hang over to Yggdrasil City.

Asuna:
OK.



(GGO. The venue that held Bullet of Bullet event. Sinon is walking through a Governor's office hall. There's a bookmaker who's taking bets for BoB finalists. Sinon stopped to check her odds)

Bookmaker:
Come on, folks! Place your bets!

(Her position was 27th in odds ranking, one behind Kirito)

Sinon:
Hmph.

Spiegel:
Sinon!

Sinon:
H-Hey, Spiegel...

(They moved to window side. A view of skyscrapers was spread out before them. It's 65 minutes to begin BoB final)

Spiegel:
I's almost time. I believe in you. I know you're gonna win this thing.

Sinon:
Thanks. So, what are you gonna do?

Spiegel:
Well, I sort to find bar somewhere. To watch the heat from there.

Sinon:
Cool, I track you down after this so we can toast my victory, or cry in our beers.

Spiegel:
Huh. ...Sinon, I mean, Asada.

Sinon:
Yeah? What's up?

Spiegel:
I was wondering if you meant what you said earlier...

Sinon:
What did I say?

Spiegel:
You asked me to wait for you, remember? After you won this thing and conquered to your fears, It... Then, then maybe we can go on stuff?

Sinon:
What the...? You're bringing this up now...?

Spiegel:
It's just a... I care about so much, Asada!

(Spiegel tried to hold Sinon's hand, but she slapped off his hand)

Sinon:
Don't do this now. I have to focus on the tournament. I'm sorry. But, I don't have a chance of winning unless I put everything I've got to into it.

Spiegel:
Right... I understand. Even so, I'm believing you. And I wait til you're ready.

Sinon:
O-kay... well, um, I'd better go get ready now. See ya.

Spiegel:
I'll be rooting for you! Good luck!



(Entrance hall. It's 42 minutes to begin. Sinon was watching Kirito walking through the hall)

Spectators:
Wow...

Sinon:
I won't loose today.

Kirito:
I won't, either.
