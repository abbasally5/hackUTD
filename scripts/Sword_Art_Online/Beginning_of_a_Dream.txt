  (The real world, a school which Asuna and Kazuto went)

Student A:
Now, see, the way it's set now. The gyro's too sensitive...If you wanna prioritize visual tracking, you gotta give yourself little more room on these parameters.

Kazuto:
Okay...but, wouldn't it lag like crazy if she makes any sudden moves?

Student B:
I guess, you...just have to trust the learning program and optimizer can deal with it.

Asuna:
Hmmm....
How much longer, guys? Our lunch break's almost over!

(Kazuto, and two other students, seems the members of mechatronics club or something, were tuning up the settings of the apparatus that sat on Asuna's shoulder)

Kazuto:
Let's just say, this is the default setting and hope it works...
Hey, er, Yuuki, can you hear? Are you OK?

Yuuki:
Yup! I hear ya loud and clear!

(Yuuki answered to Kazuto through the apparatus' speaker)

Kazuto:
Good. Alright, I'll firm up the lens now, and so might get bright.
Let me know when you can see perfect in a look that setting in.

Yuuki:
Fire away!

(Kazuto began squeezing shutter of the camera, searching the right point of it's setting)

Yuuki:
Hold it!

Kazuto:
OK. You're ready to go.
Last thing. I installed stabilizers but they're kind of junky, try not to make any sudden moves, OK?

(Asuna sprang up in joy, to express her gratitude to Kazuto)

Asuna:
A lot of thanks, Kirito!

Yuuki:
Eww...

(That Asuna's move must be an one example of those sudden moves)



Yuuki:
Wow...your school is ginormous!

Asuna:
I know, right?
I'm sorry I couldn't show you around first, but the lunch break's almost over and, we don't wanna be late.

Yuuki:
Nah, that's OK.
I'm just exited to check out your class!

Asuna:
Sweet.
Then, let's head to the faculty room, and introduce you to my teacher!

Yuuki:
Hmm...

(Yuuki sounds nervous. Asuna and Yuuki were at the door of the faculty room)

Asuna:
...What's wrong?

Yuuki:
It's the one part of school I don't miss.
I don't like the faculty room...

Asuna:
Don't worry. The teachers here aren't typical teachers.
They're cool.
Excuse me!

Yuuki:
Me...Me too!

(Asuna opened the door, and entered into the room)

Asuna:
...I just want to make sure still alright.

Teacher:
Er, sure, er, I'm fine with it.
And, what's the name of the student to be joining us today?

Yuuki:
Oh! Um...Yuuki! Yuuki Konno, sir!

Teacher:
Oh, OK. Ms. Konno, you're welcome in my class anytime you want.
Although, we start Akutagawa's "A Lorry" today.
Unless you stick with it to the end, you won't get the point.

Yuuki:
Y-yes, sir.
Thank you very much.

Teacher:
Hm. Fu fu...

Asuna:
See you in class!

(Asuna bowed once, then left the faculty room. And took deep breath for relief from free of nervousness. Yuuki did it, too. They laughed each other. Asuna entered the class 3-1, her class. All classmen chatting with their mates. Yuuki looked around the room)

Yuuki:
Oh...

Asuna:
Heh...

(Asuna walked to some class mates who sat and chatted at the rear of the class. They noticed Asuna)

Student C:
Ah...What's that, Ms. Yūki?

Yuuki:
H-Hey! How did you know my name?

Student C:
Huh?

Asuna:
No, she was using my last name there.

Yuuki:
Oh, right, dah.

Asuna:
Guys, meet Yuuki Konno. She's in the hospital for right now, and can't leave a room.
So, instead, she'll be attending our class like this.

Yuuki:
Nice to meetya!
I can only hang out for a little while, though.

Students:
Ohh...

Student C:
Nice to meet you!

Student D:
Hey there! My name's Kota.

Yuuki:
Oh, hi!
Hey, nice to meet you, too!

(Then, the teacher Asuna and Yuuki had talked in the faculty room entered into the crass room, shut the door. Students in the class room hurriedly sat their own desk. When the teacher stood at the lectern, a student began calling)

Student E:
Please stand...Bow...Be seated.

Teacher:
Alright then, class...please open up your text book page 97.
We'll be reading "A Lorry" by Ryunosuke Akutagawa.
Let's see...er, who will read it for us...?
Yuuki Konno. Would you do it on us?

Yuuki:
Huh!? Me?

Asuna:
Eh, urm...

Teacher:
Problem?

Yuuki:
No, sir! I-I can do it!

(Asuna stood from her chair. She whispered to Yuuki)

Asuna:
Yuuki...are you up for this?

Yuuki:
I might not look at it, but I have read before...

(Yuuki took deep breath in the virtual world, began read the story aloud)

Yuuki:
"When Ryohei was eight years old, construction of the light railway between Odawara and Atami began. Every day, he would head to the outskirt of town to watch the progress. It wasn't the construction of it that fascinated him so much. It was the side of the lorries, transporting the soil, which drew him.
"There were two laborers aboard the lorry, standing behind the soil they just loaded. Since a lorry was headed down the mountain, it didn't need anyone to push it. So as the chassis swung, and the sleeves of the laborers' coat flapped, and then narrow rails bent under the strain---Ryohei would gaze longingly at the sights, and wish he could be a laborer, too. Or, at the very least, be able to ride on that with them, if only once."

(While listening at Yuuki's reading, tears welled up in Asuna's eyes. After the class, classmates were gathered at Asuna, or Yuuki on her shoulder. They began to speak to Yuuki one after another)

Student C:
All we love listening to you read, Yuuki!

Student F:
Hey, have you had a chance to tour the school?

Student G:
If not, we could show you around.

Asuna:
T, take it easy, guys...

Student D:
Hey, wanna go to our soccer match?

Yuuki:
Heh heh...thanks, guys!
You're the best!

(Asuna looked almost crushed by large number of her cheering, curious classmates)



Yuuki:
Now, that was fun!

(Asuna and Yuuki sat on the bench in the court yard of the school)

Asuna:
I know, right?

Yuuki:
Thanks for making today happen, Asuna.
Really.
I had a blast.
I'm never gonna forget today...ever.

("How long that ever will last?" Asuna might think so, she looked feel a lump in her throat)

Asuna:
Well, of course you won't!
The teacher said you could come back again if you want.
Oh, Modern Japanese is third period tomorrow.
You don't wanna miss that!

Yuuki:
Yeah...

Asuna:
Hey, what's next?
Is there anything else to wanna do or see?

Yuuki:
Oh, umm...
I guess, there is one place I'd like to go.

Yuuki:
Where?



(Hoshikara railroad station, Yokotetsu line. Asuna and Yuuki were at the station square. The background painted in sepia, so the sunset must be close)

Asuna:
It's so pretty here, huh?
Just, look at that sky!

Yuuki:
Yeah...hey, are your folks cool if you stay out for so late?
You've been holding me around all day.

Asuna:
Don't you worry about it.
I sent a text and it's fine.
Well? Where do you wanna go next, Yuuki?

Yuuki:
Go...left.

(Asuna began walking. She went through shopping mall, concrete paved slope in residential area. When the dusk sky turned into night, Asuna reached to the place where they aimed to)

Asuna:
Hey, are we in Tsukimidai yet?

Yuuki:
Yeah...next corner, there's a white house.
Can you stop there...?

(Asuna stopped at the corner. Across the road, there was a house on top of the hill)

Asuna:
Yuuki...this is your house, huh.

(Plants in flowerpots are withered. One of the pots was on its side, and scattered soils on the entrance way. In the back yard, there was a small round white table and two chairs. Also, one of the two chairs was laid on its back. They indicated that the house had no residents anymore)

Yuuki:
I never thought that I get the chance to see it again.
Thanks for bringing me out here...And, for everything.

Asuna:
...Do you wanna go inside?

Yuuki:
Nah, this is enough.
Come on. Let's head back before your folks get worried.

Asuna:
No, it's okay.
We can stay a little longer.

Yuuki:
Me and my family...we only got to live here a little over a year.
And the weird thing is, I can remember everyday so clear...
My sister and me used to playing in the yard running around and around...
We had barbecues...And, we even built the bookshelves with our dad!
Good times...

Asuna:
Lucky you...

Yuuki:
Yeah, they are...gonna tear down, though.

Asuna:
Really!? Why?

Yuuki:
My aunt want to it put a convenience store here, or, maybe sell it.

Asuna:
No way...

Yuuki:
That's why I wanted to come here.
So like it cheer up my time.

Asuna:
Well, I know how you can save it.

Yuuki:
How?

Asuna:
You're fifteen now, aren't you?
When you turned sixteen, find someone you love and marry him!
That way you'll have someone around who will keep this house from never being torn down.

Yuuki:
Ah ha ha...!
You got the craziest think he has!
...hah, I don't think those anyone will wanna marry, though.

Asuna:
Oh, yeah?
Then you and Jun make a cute couple?

Yuuki:
God no!
That guy's so immature!

Asuna:
Fu fu...

Yuuki:
Let's see...Who should I marry...?
Oh! I know! You!

Asuna:
Uh...Who?

Yuuki:
The only thing is, if you marry me, you have to be the wife.
I mean, the other way around...my name'd be Yuuki Yūki.
And, that'd be weird! Heh heh heh...

Asuna:
I can't imagine what my mom would say...

Yuuki:
I know. I'm kidding!
Besides, you already got someone in mind up.

Asuna:
Oh. Well...yeah. I guess.

Yuuki:
Still, you should be careful.

Asuna:
Er...?

Yuuki:
I get the feeling he's not living in the real world either, not like me, but...you know?

Asuna:
Eh...hee hee...

Yuuki:
I can't thank you enough, Asuna...
Just sist my old house again, you know how happy that makes me.
Back home we lived here, I remember...we go to church to pray and stuff.
And, mommy's always say this to me and my sister,
"God would never put us through all this suffering, if he didn't think we could bare it."
...And it didn't make me feel any better, though.
Instead accord to the Bible, what I really wanted was this from mom'd talk to us like...well, like a mom.
But, you know, after seeing old house again, I think I get it now.
The words didn't matter.
It was the feeling behind those words.
She was praying for me so I wouldn't feel sorry for myself.
So, I could be strong to the end.
And, now I finally get it.

Asuna:
I'm the same.
See, I...I haven't understood my mom either.
I can't hear what she's really trying to tell me...
And, she can't same to hear me.
...Remember what you told me?
That, "sometimes you have to fight to get your point across?"
How can I get to be strong...like you?

Yuuki:
Me?
Hmph, I'm not strong.
No way...

Asuna:
Oh, yes you are!
You're not like me...
When you stand up to someone, you don't flinch or the rat intimidate you...nothings seem to scare you at all!
It's like second nature for you.

Yuuki:
Nn~y---yeah, I...I don't know.
When I was living in the real world, er...you know what I'd mean, most of the time, I was faking it.

Asuna:
Huh?

Yuuki:
It's like...I thought I had to act cheerful...because I didn't want to make my mom and dad feel sad for me.

Asuna:
Yuuki...

Yuuki:
You wanna know what I think in the end?
So, what if I'm just acting?
If I get to spend more time smile 'em, even if it fake, what's the big deal? Am I right?
I mean...it's not like I got a whole other time left, and, be ashamed to waste whatever I do got by mopping around all the time...
So, now I say, exactly what I feel to everyone!
And, they've got problem with that?
Who cares!?
At least, they spoke my mind.
And, maybe he even got little closer to.

Asuna:
You're right.
That's the reason we're here today...
I was so close after only few days, so because of you.

Yuuki:
Nope. That wasn't because of me.

Asuna:
Huh?

Yuuki:
It's 'cause, even I half runaway from you, you tracked me down.
Look, how about you try talking to your mom?
Like did it to me?
If you try telling how you feel? Maybe you'll get trough to her.

Asuna:
Nn...

Yuuki:
Don't worry!
You can do it!
You're way stronger than me! Honest!

Asuna:
Yuuki...

(Asuna pushed her cheek to the apparatus, the interface between Yuuki and the real world. Yuuki touched the screen hanging in her world, it was showing Asuna's face)

Yuuki:
You head me with everything you've had.
That's how I knew I'd trust you with everything I had.
In the end, it worked out for both of us...didn't it?

Asuna:
Yes, it did...
Thank you so much, Yuuki.

Yuuki:
Hmph.

(Asuna looked up the winter night sky. She had a good view of stars)



(Yūki resident. Asuna held an Amusphere rig with both her hands. She tried to knock her mother's room's door, but she hesitated. She recalled Yuuki's voice)

Yuuki:
If you try to tell her how you feel, maybe it get through to her.
...Don't worry! I know you can do it!

(She determined her mind, knocked the door. After a short while, Asuna's mother replied)

Mother:
Come in.

(Asuna opened and entered into her mother's room. In the room, the mother sat at her desk, typing her PC's keyboard, not looked back at her daughter coming in. Asuna closed the door. After she pushed the enter key on the keyboard, the mother heaved short sigh, put off her glasses, and turned her chair to face Asuna)

Mother:
You're late again.

Asuna:
I'm sorry.

Mother:
Well, if you're hungry, you'll have to make do with whatever in the fridge.
Oh, and don't forget, the deadline for transfer application is due tomorrow.
Make sure it's filled out by morning.

Asuna:
Actually, about that...

Mother:
Hmm?

Asuna:
We need to talk...mother.

Mother:
Well, what is it?

Asuna:
I can't really explain it here.

Mother:
OK, then, where should we go?

(Asuna hand the Amusphere rig to her mother)

Mother:
Nn...?

Asuna:
...The virtual world.
It'll only be for a little while.
And you're going to have to use this.

Mother:
Mm...
Don't be ridiculous!
If you can't tell me what this is about like a normal person, I don't wanna hear it.

Asuna:
But, you don't understand!
It's the only way I can explain!
It's just five minutes!

Mother:
...

Asuna:
Mom, please!
There's no other way to tell you what I'm thinking and whole I'm feeling honest.
I can't tell you any of that here!
...Trust this once.
Mom, all I want is for you to see my world!

(The mother quietly listen her daughter's beseech, trying to fathom the act what Asuna readied to her)

Mother:
...Five minutes.

Asuna:
Ah...!

Mother:
But, no matter what you say, I have no intention of allowing you to attend that school again next year.
Understood?
Also, once you're done, you will fill out that application.

Asuna:
Okay.

Mother:
So, how do I use that thing?

Asuna:
Nn...

(Asuna unfolded the Amusphere, and put it on her mother's head)

Asuna:
Just sit back, and relax.
Once it turned it on, it'll automatically connect you to my sub account in the game.
After you're in, wait for me.
I'm turning it on now.

(Asuna turned on the rig, The power and wan LED lights glowed in green. Asuna dashed to her room, put her other Amusphere rig on her head)

Asuna:
Link start!




(ALO, the Forest House K4. As soon as Asuna logged in, she looked around her mother's avatar in the room. Her mother, using Asuna's second account, was short haired female Sylph, looking at the mirror and examining her appearance)

Mother:
This is so bizarre.
Seeing a strange face, mimic what I do, is unsettling.
And this...body? It's so light.

Asuna:
Oh, that's normal.
That particular avatar's weight setting's about 90 pounds or so.
Feels lighter than your real body? huh.

Mother:
That is so rude!
I do not appreciate what you are implying!
...That's interesting.
Your face here looks just like your real one.

Asuna:
Wow...yes.

Mother:
Actually...I take it back.
Your real face is puffier than this one.

Asuna:
Oh!? Now who's being rude!?
I looked the same here as I do there!
...! Urm...

(Asuna noticed something, and shrunk)

Mother:
Well, I'm here, and now what?
You don't have much time left.

Asuna:
Follow me, mom.

(Asuna and her mother changed their room. In storage room, both sides were built-in shelves, has a window at the back, Asuna led her mother to the window, and opened it. The snow and cold wind got into the room. The mother knitted her blow a little, but stepped at the side of the window, and stooped to see outside of the house. They could see the house was surrounded by coniferous trees. Outside of the house was completely covered by snow)

Asuna:
You see?
It looks just like it.

Mother:
I have no idea what you mean.
All I see some old ceder gro---

(The mother suddenly realized it, and lost her words)

Asuna:
Doesn't it bring back memories?
Of the house that grand-ma and grand-pa had...?
I really loved their place in Miyagi...
It was magical.
...Remember that Obon holiday? When I was twelve, you, dad, and Koichro went to Yūki family companion in Kyoto.
And, I went to Miyagi by myself.

Mother:
I remember.

Asuna:
When I got there, I apologize to them that you couldn't be with us.
I felt bad you couldn't visit our ancestors' graves.

Mother:
I wanted to.
But, that year, the Yūkis' having important memorial service.

Asuna:
No, mom. I'm not blaming you or anything.
In fact, you know what gland-pa said?
He said no to fuss, because he and grand-ma so proud of you.

Mother:
...

Asuna:
You left this village, went university, became a scholar, and your work published.
Made him so happy to see you make a name for yourself in the world.
And, then he told me something I'll never forget.
That, someday, you might get tired from all the hard work, you would need break from it.
And, if that day ever came, he said he wanted to make sure the house and mountain were always there.
That he'd guard them, to give you a place to come home to...if you needed it.
...I didn't understood it then.
But now, after everything what's happened to me, I think I finally do.
Life isn't just about doing the things make you happy.
It's also about finding a way to live.
Where the happiness of everyone around you fulfills you too.
Somehow, I wanna figure out how to live the life that makes everyone around me happy.
I wanna life that let's me be there for the people I care about when they need someone to lean on...
That's all I want.
...Mother. I'll study and work hard.
But I wanna keep going to the school that I love.

(Asuna's mother was keeping her silence. But, after a moment, she noticed something out of the window. There were rabbit like animals jumping around in the forest. Two of them stopped for a short while to glance at Asuna and her mother, and went somewhere out of their sight. The mother looked outside silently. When Asuna peeked her mother's face, her mother was shedding tears, and that astonished Asuna)

Asuna:
...Mom?

Mother:
...Ah, what is this.
This is crazy...I'm not really crying.

Asuna:
Mom...you can't hide when you sad in this world.
When you cry, you cry...just like in real life.

Mother:
Hic...such an annoying world...hic.

(The mother continued crying. Asuna placed her hand on her mother's shoulder, hugged her until she stopped crying)



(The real world, Asuna's home, morning. Asuna stepped down the staircase, headed to the dining room. The mother sitting and checking the news on the tablet computer. And, there were Asuna's sandwiches, salad, and cup of coffee prepared as breakfast, across the table of the mother. In contrast that Asuna was wearing rough, easy cloths, the mother wore neat wine red jacket, and her hair and makeup were perfectly done)

Asuna:
Good morning, mom.

Mother:
Morning.

(Asuna sat on her chair)

Mother:
Asuna.
Are you determined to live that kind of selfless life you spoke of?

Asuna:
...Mm-hmm.

Mother:
Fine.
If that is what you want, you have to be strong enough to carry that burden.
So, make sure you go to college.
And, for that, you'll have to get better grades this trimester, and next year.

Asuna:
...Really?
Then...I can stay?

Mother:
That's up to you.
You'll have to prove yourself.

(The mother stood up, leaving from the dining room)

Mother:
Do your best.

(The mother left from the room. Although the mother shouldn't able to listen her voice, Asuna spoke to her mother)

Asuna:
Thanks, mom, I will...

(Then, she put her left hand on her right shoulder)

Asuna:
Thank you, Yuuki...!

(Asuna changed her cloths to the uniform of the school. She closed the front gate of the house. Before she headed to the way to the school, she turned back, and looked up the house)

Asuna:
Here, I go!

(With smile on her face, she started to run)
