  Leafa:
Ahh...! Ha ha ha...

Kirito:
Ah...It's amazing.

Leafa:
Nn-fu-fu...I know, isn't it? Welcome to Alne. It's the central of Alfheim. It's also the biggest city in the world.

Kirito:
Yeah, we finally got here.

Yui:
Oh, exciting! I've never been this big city before!

Leafa:
Me neither! The oil-light is so beautiful...? Like a bunch of twinkling stars!

(Ding!)

(Announcement):
Attention, players. The server will be down today. January the 22nd, from 4am to 3pm, for scheduled maintenance. We ask the all players, please log out, no later than ten minutes before shut down. Repeat announcement...

Leafa:
(Yawn) Whew, I guess that does it for us for today, let's go find inn and log out.

Kirito:
...Sure.

Leafa:
Uh...?

Kirito:
Well, I hope you can find some place good. Nothing to pricey, though. I sort of blew through on my cash today.

Leafa:
And why's that? Oh, right! You were showing off you gave all your money to Sakuya. You should've saved the little for the inn, big spender.

Kirito:
Heh heh...

Leafa:
Your dad's financially challenged. Do you know there's a cheap inn anywhere?

Yui:
Hmm? Urm...There's one down from what I can tell it's super cheap!

Leafa:
Great, super cheap, yay...

Kirito:
Come on, let's go.

Leafa:
Eh, Hey! Wait for me!



Asuna:
An opening...


Kazuto:
Hey, Sugu. Good morning.

Suguha:
Mwoing, Kazuto...(yawn)

Kazuto:
Someone looks sleepy today? When did you get bed last night?

Suguha:
Iwronknow...Aron'Four Isinc?

Kazuto:
Whoa, It like you should be up that late. What're you doing?

Suguha:
Oh? Ah...touring around in mind?

Kazuto:
Just don't go too over board, OK?
...Right, like I'm one the talk.

Suguha:
Um...

Kazuto:
Hey, Sugu? Turn around for a sec.

Suguha:
Why?

Kazuto:
Go on, turn around.

Suguha:
Okay...? ...Hyak! EEEEEEEEK!



Asuna:
How far this hallway'd go...? ...No way, It's a map! ...Where is it? There's got to be a console where I can log out...er? "Experiment Hangar"...?



Suguha:
Mmmmnph...To make up for that water gag you pulled, you owe me one green-tea-raspberry parfait! You cool with that?

Kazuto:
Alright...

Suguha:
Then, we're even. We could go get 'em today, if you are not too busy.

Kazuto:
Er...I can't today. I have to do something in the afternoon. And...I was also planning on going to the hospital.

Suguha:
Oh...right.
Hey, I was wondering...Is it okay, if I go with you to the hospital?

Kirito:
Huh? Sure, why not? I'm sure it will make Asuna happy...

Suguha:
Nn...

Kirito:
Um?

Suguha:
Come on! Let's eat, I'm starving!

Kazuto:
Hmm...



Asuna:
Ah...! It's about a...?

Oberon:
Did you know that by expanding brain control regions? One could, influence of person's thoughts, emotions, and memories...hee hee hee...

Asuna:
Ack! ...It's suffering! ...Ahh...! They're all...players...! Oh my god... This is horrible...
He won't get away with this...! Now that I can do anything about it... Don't worry, you'll be okay...! I'm gonna save you!

Researcher A:
Time to see everyone's up to...

Researcher B:
Woo! This guy's dreaming about Spica again. His B-13 and B-14 are way out of scale. Look at his 16 up there too, he's thrilling excited.

Researcher A:
It's only the third experiment. Maybe it's a coincidence.

Researcher B:
No, it's definitely re-induced emotion circuit. He's over the threshold now, because of the frequency of which symmetry occurrence.

Researcher A:
Hmmm... Then we have to keep monitoring him. I'll put him on the list.



Suguha:
Hey, I was wondering. What's happening with school?

Kazuto:
What about it?

Suguha:
It's just that you were supposed to start high school last year, and it sucks if you got too far behind.

Kazuto:
Yeah, well...I don't know. They said something about me having to go to school on this city. It's kind of temporary thing setting up in old building. Middle schoolers, high schoolers, everyone from SAO.

(Bus announcement):
Now departing.

Kazuto:
You can get in without taking the test, and once you graduate, you can take the college entrance exams.

Suguha:
Really? huh. If you ask me, that's a pretty good deal. But it sucks they are cramming you together like that...

Kazuto:
Ha, I get wiser doing it. When you think about it, we were all trapped inside that death game for more than two years. So, no one knows what that experience did to our minds. This is how they keep an eye on us.

Suguha:
Seriously?

Kazuto:
If I wanted to get into a normal high school now, It'd be way too hard. I'd have to spend whole year in cram school, but then, I'm basically staring over from scratch. I could always just take the exams now, and see what happens, but I doubt I pass...

Suguha:
What are you saying? You'll totally pass! You're smart, and you've got good grades!

Kazuto:
My grade used to be good. I haven't study two years, remember?

Suguha:
I've got great idea! I can be your tutor!

Kazuto:
Oh? Sweet, then you can help me with math, information technology.

Suguha:
Ugh...

Kazuto:
Ha ha...



Asuna:
There it is! This is system console... They don't see me. Good... Please work! ...Er...This is it!



Suguha:
Wow...That's a big hospital!

Kazuto:
The inside is amazing too, like a hotel.

Suguha:
Asuna...Yuuki. She used her real life name for her avatar. That's not something a lot of people do.

Kazuto:
I can't believe you know that, Asuna's the only person I've ever met who played under her real name.

Kazuto:
I'll introduce you. This is Asuna, Knights of the Blood's second in command. They called her "Lightening Flash." I can never match her speed in battle, or her accuracy of the sword... Asuna, this is my sister, Suguha.

Suguha:
Um...Er, Hello, Asuna. Nice to meet you.



Asuna:
Ugh...Ah!

Researcher A:
Who are you?! You wanna tell us what are you doing here...?

Asuna:
Um...Hey! Let go of me! Sugou's very good friend of mine! I have his permission to be here, and just about to leave, you grabbed me.

Researcher A:
...No one told me you were gonna be here today. Did you know about her?

Researcher B:
Er...No. All I know is that he doesn't want anyone to see this stuff, ever.

Researcher A:
Hmm... Hang on the sec, this is the girl! You know the one Sugou keeps locked up at the top of the world tree?

Researcher B:
Right, right! I heard about her. I don't take it's fair how boss get to have all the fun with this cute girl...Oh, come on. Stop struggling...

Asuna:
Stop it! Let me go, you monster!

Researcher B:
Oh...Don't be so mean. After all, you interrupted our deep sense mapping experiment.

Asuna:
You're supposed to be scientist, right? All this...It's wrong! It's illegal the mess of people's minds! Illegal and Unethical!

Researcher A:
Well, it's more ethical than sticking electrical probes in the brains of some poor animals, wouldn't you say? Our experiment is just..."dream." That's all.

Researcher B:
He's right. Sometimes, we show them the most wonderful dream. Dreams you wish you'd never wake up from. I wish I could have that.

Asuna:
You're insane...

Researcher B:
The boss is out on business, right? Log out and go see what he wants to do with her.

Researcher A:
Uh, fine. Whatever...Listen, though. Until I get back, don't do anything I wouldn't do!

Researcher B:
Oh, yeah, sure. Hurry up and get going.

Asuna:
Ugg...You can't keep me here! Put me down, right now!

Researcher B:
I'm sorry, but I can't. The boss would kill me if I let you go... Oh! Wait, I have it! Why don't you and I take an electric-drugs? I'm so bored with dolls! But, you look like someone I can have some fun with...?

Asuna:
Eww! Stop it...! Stop...Umg!

Researcher B:
Ouuch! What you've done! Hear as me? Putting you down! Uuarg...Geez! That say, I remember to tune right pain sense is off!

Researcher A:
Okay, what happened here?

Researcher B:
Mm-hm? What? Nothing. Uh, nothing happened. So? What the boss said?

Researcher A:
Oh, he was so pissed. He said we have her put back in the cage upstairs, change the pass-code, and keep an eye on 24-7!

Researcher B:
Damn it damn it damn it...I'd just about have some fun! Okay...I say, we walk with her, instead of teleporting her. I want to enjoy this feeling as long as I can...

Researcher A:
You know what I think? You're a perv.

Researcher A, B:
Huh?

Researcher B:
Stop struggling. It won't do you any good, hee hee hee.

Asuna:
Ugg...Er...! Let me go...!



Suguha:
She's really pretty...I feel sorry for her that she hasn't waken up yet.
I don't know if coming here was such a good idea...I'm so confused. I don't know how I feel...I thought if I met her, I'd figure it out...But now, I don't know what I want...? Do I wanna be a good sister? Or...what? ...Kazuto...



Researcher B:
Mm-fu-fu...Don't go anywhere. I hope you have another chance to hang out. Mm-fu, fu-fu...

Asuna:
This won't stop me, Kirito, no way! I'll never give up! I''ll find a way to get out of here...



Leafa:
Haa...hah...

Kirito:
Hey, Leafa. Eh? What's wrong? You OK?

Leafa:
Uh-un-uh...I'm not OK at all! I just, I just---I just got my heart broken! Hic...I, hic, I'm sorry...! I don't know why I'm telling you this. We just met. And I know it's not cool for players to drag the real I problems into the game...

Kirito:
It's okay to cry. Doesn't it matter if you here or in the real world. There's no rule. Even on the game, you can show your feelings if you want.

Leafa:
Kirito...
I'm in love with my brother. And that's something I can't tell anyone about...ever. I have to bury these feelings deep in my heart. Maybe then, someday, I can forget.

Leafa:
Haa...I'm OK now. Thanks for that pepped up, Kirito. You're really sweet, you know that?

Kirito:
Oh...yeah, well, you probably the only person who thinks that about me. You wanna log off today? I can make it rest of the way my self.

Leafa:
No, I've come this far, so I might as well as go all the way. Hm...Come on, let's go.

Kirito:
Yui, you hear?

Yui:
(Yawn) Ah, good morning. I hope you both slept well.

Leafa:
Good morning, Yui! Hey, I didn't get the chance to ask you yesterday, but, like, do navi-pixies have a sleep?

Yui:
Oh, no. See, whenever daddy logs out of the game, I shut down my input circuit, and process the data I've acquired. You could consider, it's little like human's sleep, but it's not.

Leafa:
Then...how come you yawned?

Yui:
Oh, well, that's what human's do during their boot-up sequence. When daddy yawns, it usually last for eight seconds.

Kirito:
Please keep that weird trivia to yourself.

Leafa:
Nn-fu-fu.

Kirito:
Ahem, you ready to go?

Leafa:
Yup.



Leafa:
There's tons of people here!

Kirito:
I guess it really is the center of Alfheim.

Yui:
It seems all the fairy races in the world over are here. Look how they getting along!

Man:
...They're fool right up! Ha ha ha...

Girl:
Ha ha ha...

Leafa:
Ah!

Kirito:
Wow... There it is, the World Tree.

Leafa:
Yeah... And it looks even more amazing up close, doesn't it?

Kirito:
Um...I heard there's supposed to be a city up there at the top? What else?

Leafa:
Over on, the Fairy King lives there, along with Alf, the Fairy of Light. And, they say the first race to get to the top, and see the king, will become an Alf.

Kirito:
Has anyone never tried to climb the side of that thing?

Leafa:
They made the whole perimeter of trunk off limits. So, a player can't even get closer enough to try. And if you just fly straight up, the fly limit of your wings would expire before you even got half way.

Kirito:
I've heard about some players who try. They got more than half way up by piggybacking on each other.

Leafa:
Yeah, I heard about them, alright. But they could only make up to the lowest branches before failing. The GM was freaked out, fixed it, so no one could ever do it again. Now what they did, they put the barrier up there, just above the clouds.

Kirito:
Interesting... Alright, then, let's head to the base of the trunk.

Leafa:
Well, right behind you.



Leafa:
Once we pass through that gate, we're in the World's Heart, the central district of Alne.

Yui:
Pwah!

Kirito:
...What, Yui? Is something wrong?

Yui:
Mommy...

Kirito:
!

Leafa:
...

Yui:
It's mommy...She's here!

Kirito:
A...are you sure?!

Yui:
Yes! I'm positive!

Leafa:
Hey...I...

Yui:
I scanned again, and it's mommy's player ID! Her coordinates are...above us on the tree!

Kirito:
...!

Leafa:
Kirito! Wait, Kirito! Kirito!
