  Shino:
When I was in fifth grade, I pointed a gun at a man, and killed him.

Robber:
Let's go bitch! Fill it up, or you'll get too!
Give me the money now! Or I'm gonna kill her next!
I swear! I'll do it!
...Aggh!

Shino:
Ah!

Robber:
You! little...
Get it back, you brat! Let go! Let go of my gun!
...Ugh!

Shino:
I pulled the trigger, three times.

Shino:
Aaaaahhh!!

Shino:
Ever since that day, if I saw a gun on TV, or even a picture of one, it will trigger my PTSD, and send me into a panic attack.
Meds didn't help. Counseling didn't help. Nothing helped me get rid of my phobia.

Shino:
(I look awfull...)



Shino:
I thought if I got as faraway from home as I could, to this high school in Tokyo, I'd get better somehow.
But, nothing changed.

Endo:
Bang!

Shino:
Looking back, I don't have any regrets pulling that trigger to protect my mom.
But the thing is, I'm not strong enough to convince myself what was the best choice either.
Despite being so screwed up, I did make one friend in Tokyo.
He was the one who got me into playing Gun Gale Online, Kyoji Shinkawa.

Shinkawa:
I've been totally left behind.

Shino:
That is so not true!
In the last qualifier, you made it all the way to the semi finals, remember?

Shinkawa:
Ugh...whatever...
An AGI build only get you so far in GGO.
A good gun helps too.
I spent points on the wrong stat...

Shino:
Don't get so down about that stuff.
Signed up for BoB and see what happens.

Shinkawa:
Nah, no point. I just die.

Shino:
Uh-oh, it's late.
Sorry, I have to get going now.
...Thanks for the tea. And, thanks, I mean, thank you...for saving me.
You were pretty cool.

Shinkawa:
I, I wish I could always be there to protect you...
Hey! Er...if you want, I can walk your home every day.
I mean...if you want.

Shino:
Oh, no, no. That's okay.
I'll be fine. It's the only way I'll get stronger.

Shino:
At the time, I was so focused on taking care of me and getting better.
I didn't notice Kyoji's true feelings for me...



Shino:
In GGO, I became Sinon, the sniper.
Then, I made my mission to take on the strongest players.

Sinon:
...Next!

Ginro:
Ack...Arg!

Sinon:
Ah! ...?
(Bullets are flying, and he's got a gut to smile like that...maybe I will too, when I kill him!)
Hah!

Behemoth:
Mwa ha ha ha...Ha ha ha ha ha! ...Ah!?

Shino:
I thought, the stronger Sinon got in the game, the stronger I'll get in the real world.
I believed it with every fiber in me, so I took on all comers with my Hecate II.

Sinon:
...You're dead.



Kirito:
...Yes, it's my first time.
I'm looking for a place to buy a cheap gun...
Oh, and I also need to find out where the governor's office is!
...Aha.

Shino:
I was on my way over to sign up for prelims for the third Bullet of Bullets tourney, when I met a player calling herself Kirito.
Turns out she was a he, and insisted on using a sword in a game of guns! Boyed! He pisses me off!

Sinon:
You kidding!
No way...you're guy!? With that avatar?

Kirito:
Hee hee...

Sinon:
Why you...!



Shino:
Even though he pissed me off, I could tell he was fighting with own demons...just like I was.

Sinon:
(He won't even know what hit him...er? Does he think he can dodge my bullet? At this range!? ...Does he even want to?)
Don't...
Don't screw with me!
...Fight me!
Come on! Fight! Or maybe you think I'm not worth the effort!?

Kirito:
...You got it all wrong.
All I want is to compete in the final.
There's no reason to fight any more.

Sinon:
Then go on and shoot yourself! And get it over with!
To you, it's just a game, just one stupid match...and all of it to you is, that is...a game...
Well, just 'cause you'll be on that way doesn't need I do!

Kirito:
Nn...Sinon, give me a chance to make a right with you. Let me give you the fight I promised.
...Okay. Get, set...

Sinon:
(No way! That's impossible!)
Urg! ...Ah!
...You knew where I was aiming.
But, how...?
How do you know I was going for your leg?

Kirito:
I knew because I could see your eye.
Through the lens of your scope.

Sinon:
...!
(That's how he predicted my bullet's path...? That's amazing... That kind of power is way beyond any being in our game!)
...If you're so strong you can do that, why did you look so afraid before?

Kirito:
You're wrong.
It's not strength.
All of these is a skill.

Sinon:
No...it's not.
Techniques enough to cut a bullet from my Hecate in half...
You and I both know that...
It takes strength, and all I wanna know is how to get it...!
It's what I...it's what I'm here to figure out...!

Kirito:
Listen.
Could you shoot a player in here, if you knew in the real world, that player would die from it?
And, what if you had to kill that player, 'cause if you didn't, your someone you love would die instead?
If you had that power, could you still pull that trigger?

Sinon:
...



Shino:
When Death Gun drew down on me, all the hope I put into Sinon's strength...were shuttered.

Sinon:
(A type...54 B-"Black Star!?" It's the gun...Why...Why here...? Why just here that gun...?)

Sinon:
Okay...then, who's next?

Kirito:
I got a feeling that...right now in the real world, Death Gun's partner's in your place.
He's watching the live stream.
Waiting for when you get shot by that gun.
It's just a hunch.

Sinon:
No...!
No, not that!
Oh, god...Nn, Uggh!

Kirito:
Until Death Gun shoots you, the guy in your place isn't gonna do anything, OK?
That's the rule they set up for themselves.
But, if you logged out now, and wake up in the apartment there, he'll kill you.

Sinon:
...Tell me. You got a plan.

Kirito:
We're going to take out Death Gun.



Sinon:
(Please, Hecate... I'm weak. And, I need your strength. The strength to stand up by myself...and move on!)

Kirito:
(Concentrate... Omen of his drive to kill...)
Ah!
Wraaah!

Sinon:
Kirito!
...Gotya!

Death Gun:
Fuh ha ha ha...

Kirito:
(Damn it! He's tough! If I can slow him down... One second is all I need!)

Sinon:
(Right now, Kirito's trying to get "the closure" he was talking about. He's confronting his demons from SAO by taking on the person who represents them---Death Gun. In the reason he came, isn't because he's strong. It's because he accept what he did, even know it still terrors him up, and he's still try to move on, despite it! ...I gotta do something...Think!)
Ah!

Death Gun:
...!

Sinon:
Kirito!

Kirito:
(Sinon's distracting him with the bullet line! She's got him in her insights, using all her skill and spirit to keep it betrailed on him! It's like a phantom bullet! One last attack! I can't waste this chance!)
Aaaaah!

Death Gun:
Ha ha ha...

Kirito:
Grrraaahhh!

Death Gun:
Fool... It's not over yet. You can't stop me. He'll find you... And, he...

Kirito:
No, XaXa...You're done.
And, we'll find your partner, too.
He won't kill anyone, anymore.
Laughing Coffin is dead.

Kirito:
...It's over.

Sinon:
Yeah.
...My name is Shino, Shino Asada.

Kirito:
I guess, now, we should probably get this tourney over with, huh?

Sinon:
Yeah, we should.
There.

Kirito:
Huh? Whoa!

Sinon:
Nn~fufu~

Kirito:
Eh, hee hee...?



Shinkawa:
I love you, Asada...!

Shino:
I thought once I got to be the strongest player in Gun Gale Online, it's somehow cancel out my weakness in the real world.

Shinkawa:
Asada...Asada! Asada! Asada, Asada! Asada!

Shino:
Eek!

Shino:
I couldn't have been more wrong.

Kazuto:
Run, Sinon!



Endo:
H-hey...wow!

Shino:
I realized Sinon and Shino were the same...They were me.
I know I won't get better over night.
It's gonna be a long time before I can come to grip with the memory of what I did.
Even so, little by little, I will get better.
It's OK.
This world...isn't that scary anymore.
It's pretty nice, actually.
