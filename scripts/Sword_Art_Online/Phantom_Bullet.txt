  (GGO. Death Gun was rushing, overwhelming Kirito)

Kirito:
(In mind) Damn it... He's tough! If I can slow him down... a one second all I need!

Sinon:
Kirito!
...If only I had my scope!

(Sinon reminisced about a talk with Kirito back when they were in a cave)

Kirito:
I get it now. There are things I shouldn't forget. What it means to kill. Significance of taking life. And, once I accepted, maybe then, I'll be able to find some closure. That's how I see it.

(Sinon activated her skill, "Hawk Eye." She could watch the progress of the fight between Kirito and Death Gun)

Sinon:
Right now, Kirito's trying to get "the closure" he was talking about. He's confronting his demons from SAO by taking on the person who represents them---Death Gun. In the reason he came, isn't because he's strong. It's because he accept what he did, even know it still terrors him up, and he's still try to move on, despite it! ...I gotta do something. ...Think!



(Hospital. Asuna and Aki were keeping their close watch on both the sword fight in GGO and Kirito's physical condition)

Asuna:
Kirito...

Aki:
He's sweating so much. He'll dehydrate soon... I wonder if we get him to log out. At least, warn him.

Asuna:
No. He wouldn't hear us. The dive box everything out. The Amusphere's designed with stuff like this in mind, so it should shut off if he gets too dehydrated.

Aki:
...OK, then, I guess we just have to wait.

Yui:
Hey, mommy! Try holding daddy's hand. He'll feel the warmth if you touch, and know you're here, watching over him. Since I can't touch anything in your world, hold it for me too. I know he won't feel me there, but still...

Asuna:
No. That's not true. I'm sure he'll feel your hand too.

(Asuna placed her smart phone, which linked with Yui, on under Kirito's hand)

Asuna:
I know he will... Let's cheer him up, together.

Yui:
Mommy...

Asuna:
Hang in there, Kirito. Fight for what you believe in. And I'm right here by your side. Wherever you go, and whatever you do, I'll always stay with you...



(GGO. Kirito and Death Gun were still fighting)

Kirito:
He's right. I didn't want to know his name. I didn't want anything to do with him. But I should have known. I wouldn't have erased that easy! I didn't forget. I only pretended to! But, I was just fooled myself.

(With his estoc, Death Gun continued trying to pierce Kirito. Kirito was full to parry Death Gun's attack. A moment, Kirito could catch the glimpse Death Gun's eyes)

Kirito:
Red eyes...

(Kirito looked back his memory, the meeting in SAO)

Kirito:
I saw him in the briefing before the raid... Black... Red... Red! ...XaXa!
"Red-Eyed" XaXa! That's you! That's your name!

(Death Gun stopped his attack. Then, he noticed a red mark is on his shoulder, meaning someone aiming at him. From the distance of several hundred meters away, Sinon was holding her rifle, without it's scope, she somehow managed her gun to point at Death Gun. Kirito caught his chance, rushed to Death Gun)

Kirito:
Sinon's distracting him with the bullet line! She's got her insights, using all her skill and spirit to keep it betrailed on him! It's like a phantom bullet! One last attack! I can't waste this chance!
Aaaaah!

Death Gun:
Ha ha ha...

(Death Gun tried to hide by using his invisible cloak. But, Kirito used his handgun so it's shot cancelled the cloak's effect)

Kirito:
Grrraaahhh!

(At last, he was able to his sword cut into Death Gun's body, separated him into two)

Kirito:
(Panting)

Death Gun:
Fool... It's not over yet. You can't stop me. He'll find you... And, he...

(Death Gun was dead)

Kirito:
No, XaXa... You're done. And, we'll find your partner, too. He won't kill anyone, anymore. Laughing Coffin is dead.



(Hospital. Asuna, after witnessed Kirito won, was prone down her face on Kirito's hand)

Asuna:
Kirito...

Yui:
Daddy...



(GGO. Kirito was walking through a desert. Coming from the opposite side was Sinon. They faced each other. Sinon stood her rifle on the ground. They fist bumped. Both of them looked up, the starry sky)

Kirito:
It's over.

Sinon:
Yeah.

Kirito:
I guess, now, we should probably get this tourney over with, huh?

Sinon:
Yeah, we should.

Kirito:
...With Death Gun out of the picture, I'm pretty sure the guy chasing out your apartment's taking off.

Sinon:
Nn.

Kirito:
I don't think you'll be any danger when you log out. But, you should call the cops when you do. Just to be safe.

Sinon:
O-key...but, what am I supposed to tell them?

Kirito:
Oh, yeah... right. The guy I work for at the government, I could ask him to send the cops to your place. ...But, how am I gonna get your info? I can't really ask for it in here.

Sinon:
It's cool. I'll tell you.

Kirito:
Huh!? Are you sure?

(Sinon closed the distance between her face to Kirito's left ear, whispered)

Sinon:
My name is Shino, Shino Asada. And I live at...

Kirito:
You are not gonna believe this, but you're close to the place I'm diving from.

Sinon:
Yeah? Wow. No way...

Kirito:
How about this? After we log out, I'll get head over to you.

(Sinon responded with smile)

Sinon:
You would? really!? ...um, no, I'm good. A friend of mine lives near me, so I've got help if I needed.

Kirito:
OK. But, after I log out, I'll call the guy work for and have him send the cops, if you're cool, then.

Sinon:
Mm-hm. Sounds good. Um... but not good enough. You're just gonna log out without telling me your info?

Kirito:
Oh? ...Right, sorry. My real name is Kazuto Kirigaya.

Sinon:
That's how you got Kirito? ...Seriously? Talk about lack of imagination!

Kirito:
Y-yeah! Whoa. Wait! You're the one that talk!?

Sinon:
Huh? Heh heh heh...

Kirito:
Alright, then. If we ever gonna log out this thing, we've gotta end BoB first. ...So, how do you wanna do this? You wanna have a duel like we did yesterday?

Sinon:
Hmm... Look out yourself. You're beaten-up. There's no challenging beating someone who is already as trashed as you. Nah, I'll take you on the next BoB. But, you better not leave me hanging!

Kirito:
Urg...

Sinon:
Well, let's get this thing's over with already...

Kirito:
How we gonna do that? Unless one of our HP's drains out all the way, there's not gonna be a winner.

Sinon:
I guess, you didn't hear what had happened in the first BoB? There were two winners. The player who should have won let his guard down too soon. So, his opponent gave him what we called a "Souvenir Grenade."

Kirito:
A "Souvenir Grenade?" 'The heck was that?

Sinon:
This.

(Sinon took out a grenade from her back pocket, and put it on Kirito's hand, switched it on)

Kirito:
Huh? Whoa!

(The grenade start to count down. While Kirito panicked, couldn't handle the grenade, Sinon held Kirito tight. The grenade was between Kirito and Sinon)

Sinon:
Nn~fufu~

Kirito:
Eh, hee hee...?

(The grenade blasted, involving Kirito and Sinon. Then, the winners of BoB were determined. The screen broadcasting the game showed Kirito and Sinon were both the Winners of Bullet of Bullets)

Spectators:
(Roaring)

(A fanfare rang. Fireworks went off. While everyone in GGO cerebrating the end of the match, Kirito was waiting at the silent place until he was able to log out. The display at the front of him, shows rankings of the players who participated the final game of BoB. Two players, Garrett and Pale Rider, were out of rankings because of their disconnection)

Kirito:
Death Gun had two victims this time. That means he's got at least two others helping him...



(The real world, Shino's apartment. She lied down on her bed. The Amusphere mounted on her head. She recovered her consciousness, timidly opened her left eye. When she confirmed there's no harmful people in her room, she woke up, took off her dive box, then put her glasses on. She was searching around in her room, opened a wardrobe, crouched to peek under the bed, checked the bus tub if anyone sneaked in)

Shino:
What am I doing?

(She sank down to the floor with a sigh of relief. Then, doorbell rang)

Shino:
Wha!? Huh...?

Shinkawa:
Asada, are you there? It's me. Asada.

Shino:
Ah! Shinkawa!

Shinkawa:
I, er, I just wanna congratulate on your win. I even have some from pastries.

(Shino's room. Shino sit on her bed. Shinkawa sit on the floor with cushion)

Shinkawa:
Hey, congrats. You are so awesome, Asada. I mean, Sinon. You did it. You are the best gunner in GGO now.

Shino:
Nn~fu fu...

Shinkawa:
I knew all along you could do it. You deserve to No.1 more than anybody. You showed them all real strength about. You should be proud.

Shino:
um...Thank you.

Shinkawa:
...Urm, Asada!

Shino:
Wh-what's up?

Shinkawa:
You said...you said to wait, remember that!?

Shino:
What are you talking about?

Shinkawa:
Well, you told me to wait. And if I did, then you'll be mine.

Shino:
Huh?

Shinkawa:
I waited... I waited for you!

Shino:
Wh-what's got into you...?

Shinkawa:
From now on... I'll always be with you... You don't need him to protect you... That's my job... I'm gonna protect you now... forever.

(Shinkawa clinched Shino)

Shino:
Shinkawa...!

Shinkawa:
I love you Asada... You're mine... My Asada... Ah... Shino...! Mine...

Shino:
Ugh... Let go...!

(Shino pushed hard Shinkawa to the floor. A cake box fall. The box's corner dinted)

Shinkawa:
Why did you push me in the way like that...? Y-you made a promise. We both did.

Shino:
Sh-sh-sh-Shinkawa...?

(Shinkawa's breath was becoming harder. He picked out something from his pocket. It looks like some type of injector. He pressed it against Shino's side waist)

Shino:
Shi...Shinkawa...?

Shinkawa:
Don't make any sudden moves, Asada... The syringe I'm holding's gotta drug that paralyze your muscles in instant. Before you know, your lungs will stop with your heart.

Shino:
Syringe!?

(Shino reminded the talk with Kirito, and then, with Shinkawa)

Kirito:
Maybe, by injecting some kind of drug or something...? That's one way.

Shinkawa:
Yeah, it is the family business. I promise my dad go to med school, so it's a done deal, stick with it now.

Shino:
This is crazy... Y-y-you're the other Death Gun...?

(Shinkawa silently smirked)

Shinkawa:
Woo... I'm impressed. You figured out Death Gun's little secret... It's true. I'm Death Gun's partner in crime.

Shino:
...!

Shinkawa:
Up to now... Before this youth BoB anyway... I was the one playing Sterben. But today, I insisted on being the one to do the job I along... Don't you see I had to be the one doing indeed? I can't let some other guy touch you... even if that guy's my brother.

Shino:
Your brother...!? So then... the player who belong to that murder guild in SAO... That was your older brother...?

Shinkawa:
Forget about him... It's just you and me now, Asada...

(Shinkawa slipped his hand into Shino's stomach, under her wear)

Shino:
Stop! It's not too late... You don't have to do this...! What about cram school on!? You said you can be a doctor...!

Shinkawa:
Doc...tor...? You think I give a dumb about that!? For those my parents...? For those guys in school...? They're all assholes! You know what made me happy? To be the strongest player in GGO! But that piece of shits XeXeeD lied about AGI type's being the strongest! AND I FELL FOR IT LIKE AN IDIOT! You don't know...! GGO was everything to me! And I gave everything up in the real world for it! GOD DAMN IT!

Shino:
Y-you... you killed XeXeeD... because he lied...?

Shinkawa:
Oh, come on... He was the perfect victim... We had to show the world Death Gun was the strongest in GGO... in the all VRMMOs...! What better person to sacrifice than that dog!? And now, that's done. I don't need this reality anymore... Let's move on to the next one... Come on... Just you and me...

Shino:
Wh-what are you saying...?

Shinkawa:
We can go somewhere like GGO... Nn-nh, No, some place of the fantasy vibe instead... As long as it's with you I don't care... I'll be reborn, be husband and wife. We'll get a house. Look on quest together... Ah, and have kids, too! We'll have so much fun! I know it will... Come with me!? Oh... Asada...? ...You're so beautiful... You are... more than anything... You're mine... And no one else's... I always loved you, Asada... Always... Let's go... When I heard about what happen... When I heard... what you do...! A good luck all over, I'll never find another girl like you... I mean, you shot a real bad guy with real gun...! And killed him! How cool is that... I told you didn't I...? I said you had real power...! I came up with that Death Gun legend... I picked the Type 54 as his gun because of you... That's how much I love you, Asada... I love you so much...! More than anything...!

Shino:
Nn-n-no...

(Shino's eyes were becoming hollow. Seemed she lost any hope. She saw the robber's face overlaid on Shinkawa's. She couldn't keep her eyes open anymore)




Shino:
I don't wanna see anything... I don't feel anything, anymore... This isn't real... It can't be...

(Shino reminded Kirito's face)

Shino:
Kirito... you went to all the trouble to save me... But that was all for nothing...

(In her memory, Kirito spoke to Shino)

Kirito:
How about this? After we log out, I get head over to you.

Shino:
...! If he comes over... He'll be in danger...! And, I can't do anything about it...

That's not true.

Huh...?

(In her imaginary cave, Shino curled herself up. And, Sinon stood by her)

Sinon:
Up to this point, All we've been doing was looking out for ourselves. We certainly never fought for anyone else. But now, Even know it might be too late for us, let's go fight for someone else. Just this once. Me and you.

(Sinon offered her hand)

Shino:
Er...

Sinon:
Come on! Let's go!

(She was pulling Shino to resurface her from the imaginary cave)




(The real world. Shinkawa was about to grope Shino's body)

Shinkawa:
I love you Asada...!

(Shino smashed her elbow to Shinkawa's left cheek. At the same time, she forced Shinkawa to drop the syringe. She kicked him to rip him off from her. She ran to the door to get out of the house, turned a door lock, and pulled a door chain. Then, Shinkawa caught Shino)

Shinkawa:
A...Asada...!

Shino:
No! Let go!

(Shinkawa mounted on Shino. He completely lost his sanity, repeatedly shouted Shino's surname)

Shinkawa:
Asada! Asada! Asada! Asada! Asada! Asada...!

(Then, someone barged into Shino's house. He kicked up Shinkawa's face, and he and Shinkawa started to scuffle with)

(Unknown):
Run Sinon!

(Shino glanced his profile. She realized the boy who barged in was Kirito when he was in the real world)

Shino:
Kirito...!?
