  Suguha:
"I wanna see what the virtual reality is like." I wonder why I first thought that?
I used to hate the virtual reality games with a vengeance. And, I blamed to them stealing my brother away from me. But later on, I got curious. I didn't know why my brother loved them so much. So I figured, maybe I should see it by myself.
I didn't know what to expect for first. But after a while I was surprised how much I loved ALfheim Online. It was amazing. Fly in through the sky on my very own wings. To fly as far as I wanted, as high as I wanted, as fast as I wanted. I give anything and everything for that.
I think I can get it now. I can see why my brother loves the virtual world.



Nagata:
er...Hold it! Leafa!

Suguha:
Er!?
Ugh... I thought I told you not to call me that in school, Nagata, didn't I?

Nagata:
Yeah... you did. Sorry, Suguha.

Suguha:
Idiot!

Nagata:
I'm sorry! I mean, Kirigaya!

Suguha:
Hmm... What do you want?
Wait. Why are you even here? You gotta release from taking high-school entrance exams. They're not making come anyway, are they?

Nagata:
Sugu...

Suguha:
Grrr....!

Nagata:
Kirigaya! I need talk to you so, I've been waiting on morning.
Wait, you're not here for the exams, are you?

Suguha:
No. The adviser for the kendou club asked me come in, that's all.
Well, what's up?

Nagata:
It's Sigurd and the others. They all wanted to go hunting again this afternoon.

Suguha:
Sorry, I won't be going out with those guys for a while.

Nagata:
Wait, What!? Why not!?

Suguha:
I've got plans to head over to Arun, that's why.

Nagata:
But, isn't Arun at the base of the World Tree...?
Wait a second! You! ...Are you! ...You're not going with that Spriggan?

Suguha:
Yeah... well, sort of...? I promised I'd show him how to get there.

Nagata:
But... have you thought about what you doing, Lea...

Suguha:
Grrr!

Nagata:
eek...
...Ahem! K-kirigaya, it's just so far away, and, you guys'll be... "sleeping" together... and,

Suguha:
DON'T GET ANY WEIRD IDEA SO BAD! YOU JERK!

Nagata:
Ugh!

Suguha:
Look, I made up my mind and that's that. Say "hey" Sigurd and others for me.
See you later!



Suguha:
...All I'm doing is showing him the way. ...That's all I'm doing.
Nn...!
Link start!



Leafa:
Oh.

Kirito:
Hey there. 've been waiting long?

Leafa:
Not at all. I just walked in. Actually, I was out shopping for gear.

Kirito:
Oh, that's right. I should update my equipment, too. I don't think this is gonna be enough.

Leafa:
Okay. I know a good weapon shop in town. But do you have enough money? Because they are not cheap.

Kirito:
Okay, money... wait, this thing called "Yld." Is that money?

Leafa:
Uh-huh.

Kirito:
Um... Hey, Yui, wake up and heading out now.

Yui:
Yawn, okay...


Leafa:
Hm...? (Chuckling)


Kirito:
Why would we come here?

Leafa:
Well, when flying long distances, it's better if you start from higher altitude. That's what the tower's here for.

Kirito:
Oh...that makes sense.

(In his reminiscence)
Kirito:
You're kidding meeeee!

Kirito:
ugh...

Leafa:
C'mon! Let's go! I wanna get pass the forest before dark.

Kirito:
er...

Leafa:
This way, Slowpoke!

Sigurd:
Leafa!

Leafa:
Oh, er... Hello, Sigurd.

Sigurd:
What's this I hear about you leaving the party. Is that true?

Leafa:
Well... Yeah, it is.

Sigurd:
Do you have any idea how much that's going to upset other members?

Leafa:
You said it wouldn't be a problem if I joined only when I have the time. You've also said I could quit whenever I wanted to!

Sigurd:
Yes, I know what I've said. But you've been with us for a while now. Everyone knows you. If you leave us, it's going damage to reputation of the party!

Leafa:
eh...

Kirito:
Party members are not items.

Leafa:
um...?

Sigurd:
What did you say?

Kirito:
Party members aren't items. So, don't expect them be on call for you. They're not your armor. They're not your sword. They're not your equipment.

Sigurd:
You son-of-a...!
I bet that big mouth of yours got you thrown out of your own territory. Let's see what you got, you piece of Spriggan trash!

Leafa:
Okay, that's it! Enough!
Kirito's my new partner. So leave him alone.

Sigurd:
What!? Leafa, you are abandoning us!? To be a renegade like him?

Leafa:
...Yes, I am. And, I'm not coming back. Ever!

Sigurd:
I don't give a damn about you buzzing around my party members. But if you think you can steal them, then that's another story! If you are stupid enough to waltz in to another races territory, and then, it's your own damn fault if you get killed, Spriggan!

Kirito:
(Sigh)

Subordinate A:
This isn't the time and place Sigurd. If we gang this guy in front of all these people, we're gonna look bad...

Sigurd:
Umm...!
Once you cross our border, you better run and hide, Leafa. I've never expected you betraying like this. Never. But, you'll regret it soon enough.

Leafa:
Ugh... I'm really sorry you've got dragged into all that drama.

Kirito:
It's cool. I'm worried about you, though... Are you sure about this?

Leafa:
Um...

Kirito:
Hey! Don't...!


Kirito:
Wow... This is an amazing view... The sky is so close. It's like I can reach and touch it.

Leafa:
I know. Right?
Whenever I look up that sky, everything else feels so small.
...The timing couldn't be any better. I've been thinking about leaving here for a while now.

Kirito:
Okay, but, I feel like it's sort of my fault you left on bad terms from those guys.

Leafa:
Yeah, well, I don't think it could've happened any other way.

Kirito:
What do you mean by... "renegade?"

Leafa:
A "renegade," is a player who abandons their territory. If you get bland as this one, everyone's gonna look down on you.

Kirito:
And, you're cool that?

Leafa:
Yeah. I don't really care. But I don't understand why everyone's so quick to tie each other down like that. I mean, what's the point in having wings, you know.

Yui:
You humans are so complicated. Honestly, your psychology's confusing. Why do you act so horribly to each other, when all you want is companionship.

Leafa:
What do you mean?

Yui:
If it were me, (smooch) I'd do that! It's simple, straightforward, and efficient!

Leafa:
Ah... That's amazing AI. Do all private pixies act like that? Or just yours?

Kirito:
No, just mine. But she's a weirdo.

Leafa:
I guess, you would know. Huh? All we want is companionship... huh.

Recon:
Leafa!

Leafa:
Hey, Recon.

Recon:
How could you do this! Are...you gonna at least to say something you left!

Leafa:
Oh, sorry. I guess I forgot!

Recon:
Oh... Why do you quit the party all of a sudden like that?

Leafa:
Well... I didn't really think too hard about it. I just did it. What are you gonna do, though?

Recon:
As if! Leafa, it doesn't matter where you go. My sword belongs to you, and you alone!

Leafa:
I don't need it, but, thanks.

Recon:
Oh, aww...
What I meant by that was... I'm gonna go with you. Wherever. That is... I'd like to go, but... there's something that bugging me.

Leafa:
What is it?

Recon:
I can't really prove anything yet, but there's a few things I wanna look into more. So, I'm gonna stay in Sigurd party for a little longer.... Hey, Kirito! She has a habit of getting herself in trouble. I'd appreciate if you keep an eye on her.

Kirito:
Yeah, sure. Whatever you say.

Recon:
And just make sure, and absolutely clear! Leafa is my...! Urg!

Leafa:
Will be in the neutral zone for a while? Message me if you need anything.


Kirito:
Let me get this straight, in real life, is he your friend?

Leafa:
Yeah... something like that.

Kirito:
Hmm-humm...?

Leafa:
OK, what's that weird noise supposed to mean!?

Kirito:
Nothing. Just a little jealous is all.

Yui:
Now, that person's feelings I can understand. He must like you a lot! Wouldn't you say, Leafa? Do you feel the same way about him?

Leafa:
Ar...!? I-I don't know! Jeez!
Hurry up you guys! Let's try to make it all the way to the lake without stopping!

Kirito:
OK!



Oberon:
Nn fu fu...
Mm...? ...Unbelievable. You can be so stubborn, seriously. No matter what I do, I can't hurt you. It's not like the body's real. Why can't you just loose up and enjoy yourself a little.

Asuna:
I don't expect you to understand. But, to me, it doesn't matter of my body is real or virtual. You may not think that way, but I do.

Oberon:
Are you afraid going to be corrupted somehow? Nn fu fu... Because of that's the case, you definitely need to take things little less seriously why you're here?

Asuna:
Oh, I'm not planning on staying this cage forever. You'll see, he'll come and save me.

Oberon:
Really? Who will? That hero boyfriend of yours? Goes by the name of Kirito.

Asuna:
...!

Oberon:
Nn fu fu... Please, you think I didn't know? His real name is Kirigaya. I met him the other day, in the real wold.

Asuna:
...

Oberon:
I couldn't believe that weak little boy was the same one who beat Sword Art Online. It took me a second to collect myself.
...By the way, where do you think I met him? In your hospital room! As you were lying there, I told I've been marrying you next week. My god! You should've seen his face. It was like all the color drained out of it! I could barely keep myself from laughing! Nn fu fu... Do you wanna know what I think? I'll bet you anything that brat won't have the guts to put on the nerve gear ever again!

Asuna:
...

Oberon:
That reminds me, I promised him I was going to send along our wedding invitation. I'm pretty sure he'll come. He's going want to see you in your wedding dress. I know, I'm generous the least I can do as leave the little hero a few clams! Nn fu fu... Ha ha ha...!
Well, I have to get going now, Tatanya. I hope you don't miss me too much...?

Asuna:
He's alive...! Kirito is alive!

Oberon:
...fu fu.

Asuna:
Eight-one-one-three-two-three-two...nine.



Kirito:
Ohhaahhh!

Leafa:
Þeír slíta fimm grœnn vindr!

Kirito:
Hmm...

Leafa:
Nice job!

Kirito:
Thanks for the awesome backup!

Leafa:
Hm? Our wings aren't gonna last much longer, I think we should land down there for a bit.

Kirito:
OK.

Leafa:
Um! Nn~! Hey! You' getting tired yet?

Kirito:
Nope! I'm good to go.

Leafa:
Oh, OK, Mr tough guy. I hate to break it to you, but flying is out of both of us for a little while.

Kirito:
Huh? How come?

Leafa:
You see that mountain way over there? It's above the altitude limit, so we can't fly over. The only way anyone can pass is to go through the caves. It's the toughest part of the trip between South Territory and Arun, as so I've heard. I've never even been this by myself.

Kirito:
Guess, we walk? These caves, are they long?

Leafa:
Pretty long. There's a mining town about the halfway. It's neutral territory so we can rest there. And that reminds me, are you good for time until we have to get back?

Kirito:
It's seven at night in the real world. Yeah, I can keep going for a while.

Leafa:
Cool, I can, too. So, let's keep going. But, since we're here, we should rotate out.

Kirito:
Wait, rotate...?

Leafa:
Yeah, we take turns logging out and resting while other keeps watch. You can't log out when you're in the field, remember? So, we have to take turns logging out. The person who stays behind guards other's avatar.

Kirito:
OK, sounds like a plan.
...Lady's first.

Leafa:
Okay! Don't mind if I do. See you in about twenty minutes.



Suguha:
Hyak! ...hah.
...Whoa!
Hey! Kazuto! What do you wanna do for dinner?! ...I wonder if he's asleep?
um... Nn...!
I can't wait to get back there... Kirito... It's not that I'm in love with him or anything. Or that I've got someone to go on adventures with. ...No, I'm just excited I get go places in the new world.



Leafa:
Nn... Hey, I'm back. Did you see any monsters?

Kirito:
No, I didn't. It's been pretty quiet this whole time.

Leafa:
What are you eating?

Kirito:
I bought a bunch other shop before we left Swilvane. I don't know what they are called, but NPC said you can only get them in there.

Leafa:
I've never seen them before.
...Hum! Eek!

Kirito:
Sorry to leave you like this, but it is my turn. Keep me safe, okay?

Leafa:
Cough, coough...! Get out of here before I hurt you! cough!
...Hmm?

Yui:
Hm.

Leafa:
Woa! No way! you can move when your master's logged out?

Yui:
Well, of course I can move! You know, I'm my own person! And for your information, he's not my master. He's my daddy!

Leafa:
Yeah, about that... I was gonna ask you before. Why do you call him daddy? Did he, you know, um, set you that way or something?

Yui:
He didn't do anything to my settings. He saved me. He told me I was his daughter. That makes him my daddy. You see how that works?

Leafa:
Yeah, I guess...
Do you, you know... like him?

Yui:
I'm sorry. I don't understand what do you mean by "like?"

Leafa:
Ar...Are you serious? It ...means you wanna be with him all the time, and when you are together, you get excited about being near him. Or, ...something like that.
(She happened to imagine Kazuto)
Ah! Nn-nn-nnn...

Yui:
What's wrong Leafa?

Leafa:
Nothing! It's nothing!

Kirito:
What's nothing? What's going on?

Leafa:
OH?

Kirito:
What is it? ...Did something happen?

Yui:
Welcome back, daddy!
Leafa was just explaining to me what it means when someone...

Leafa:
NOOOOO! I said it's nothing! It's Nothing!
Y-you weren't there for very long. I hope you got some to eat...

Kirito:
Yeah. My family left something for me. So I'm good.

Leafa:
It's sweet.
er, Come on then, let's get going.

Kirito:
Oh, okay.
...Alright! we get the way. ...Hmm?

Leafa:
Is something wrong?

Kirito:
I don't know. It's sort of feel like someone was watching us... Hey, Yui. There're any players near by?

Yui:
No, I'm not sensing any other players.

Leafa:
Hmm... It's possible someone put a tracer on us.

Kirito:
What the heck is that "tracer?"

Leafa:
Kind of tracking magic. It looks like a small animal, or an insect. It tell the caster a target's position.

Kirito:
Can you dispel it?

Leafa:
Sure. If you can find it.
The thing is, if the caster's magic skill's high, the tracer can track you from far away. And if the field is this size, it'll take forever to find it.

Kirito:
Great. Nah, maybe it's just my imagination. C'mon! let's go.

Leafa:
Okay.

...

Bat:
...Kyee! kyee!
