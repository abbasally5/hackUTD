  (ALO, in some restaurant or bar, Asuna sat alone in the front of a fireplace. She was pensive. Then, like she remembered something, she opened her window and sent a message to Yuuki. The message was "Please respond, Yuuki." But the system responded that she no longer logged in. She ruminated Yuuki's action, how Yuuki logged out suddenly as if she escaped from Asuna. While Asuna continued her pensive thinking, Siune appeared and talked to Asuna)

Siune:
Asuna...

Asuna:
Siune!
Please, do you know what happened to Yuuki?
It's been three days and she hasn't logged back in!

Siune:
It's not just you. None of us have been able to contact to her either.
Asuna, I hate to say this, but I don't think she wants to see you again.
...I think she's doing it for your own good.

Asuna:
But, why!?

(Siune kept quiet. Asuna waggled her head slowly)

Asuna:
I had a feeling something wasn't right.
I could tell everyone in the group was avoiding getting to close to me.
Go ask I was one to upset anyone, or be a nuisance?
But, still...I don't see how any of this could be for my sake?

Siune:
You're not a nuisance!
...It's not like that. Believe me what I say, we're truly happy that we met you.
I've got have one last amazing memory about time together here.
And it's all thanks to you.
And, Yuuki, I know she's grateful, too.
But please, forget you ever met us...!
It really is the best thing for you and for Yuuki.

Asuna:
I can't ever see any of you again...?
I thought, after the guild was gone, I thought we could at least we keep on being friends.
But, this whole time...I was the only one who thought that?

Siune:
...I'm sorry.

(Siune opened her window, hastily operated it and logged out)

Asuna:
No, wait!

(Asuna left there alone. She continued brooding)



(Asuna's home in the real world. Asuna was languidly stepping down stairs. When she passed hallway, she glanced at dining room. There were her mother and her father taking their beak fast. They didn't have any conversation. While the father drinking his coffee, her mother looked busy operating, seeing her tablet computer. Asuna silently left her home, went to school. At the school, while Asuna walking, contemplating something, Risa Shinozaki called her with usual her loud voice)

Risa:
Asuna!

Asuna:
Ah...

Risa:
Morning!

Keiko:
Moning, Asuna...!

(We don't know how long they run, but Risa and Keiko both lost their wind when they reached at Asuna. Asuna replied them with not brightest way)

Asuna:
Good morning...

Risa:
Ah! We finally gotya...
Alright, we are here. So, you're gonna tell us what the message was about!?

Keiko:
Is it true? What is this something about you're doing a guild?

Risa:
C'mon, c'mon! Tell us. Are they cool?

Asuna:
Well...it's like...

(Suddenly, Asuna's cell phone rang)

Asuna:
Oh, hang on a sec...

(The call was from Kazuto)



Kazuto:
Alright. How's then? Can you see my face okay?

Yui:
I see you. But, you're little blurry.

Kazuto:
Hmm...It's the out of focus again. It's gotta be that.
Give me a sec, Yui.

Yui:
Okay, daddy.

(On the roof of the building of the school. Kazuto was facing an apparatus which have camera lens, attached to note PC Kazuto operating. While Kazuto typing PC's keyboard, Asuna opened the door and entered into roof space. Kazuto closed his note PC, and place it aside from his lap, stood to have conversation to Asuna)

Kazuto:
Hey.

(Asuna couldn't erase her depressing mood. She approached to Kazuto, and placed her head on Kazuto's left shoulder. Kazuto patted Asuna's back)

Kazuto:
...This second, you still wanna see her?

(Astonished Asuna parted her head from Kazuto's shoulder, and stood straight to face right in Kazuto's)

Asuna:
Mm-hmm.

Kazuto:
Even after they say it's better you didn't. You still do?

Asuna:
Mm-hmm.
I don't care what they say.
All I want is to talk to Yuuki one last time.
I can't leave it like this!

Kazuto:
OK.
I think I might've found where she's in.

(Kazuto took out a piece of memo paper)

Kazuto:
I'm not sure, but it's the best I've got.

Asuna:
What makes you think she'd be here...?

Kazuto:
That place has a "Medicuboid." There's the only one it's doing a clinical trials for it.

Asuna:
Me---dicuboid...?

(On the memo, there's a name of the hospital in Yokohama, and the phone number on it)



(Yokohama, Asuna was walking toward the big hospital building. She stopped for a while, and looked up the building with anxious expression. She entered to hospital lobby, and asked to the female clerk sat at the counter)

Asuna:
Excuse me.

Clerk A:
May I help you?

Asuna:
Yes.
I, um...I think I'm looking for a patient.

Clerk A:
Er...

Asuna:
Uh, she is about fifteen years old or so...
I think her name might be Yuuki, but I'm not sure...

Clerk A:
I need a name at least.

Asuna:
Oh, um, well, I think she may be the patient who is testing that Medicuboid thing...?

Clerk B:
Pardon me, miss.
What's your name?

Asuna:
Eh, oh, sorry. My name is Asuna Yūki.

Clerk B:
Ahh...Please, have a seat. I'll get someone right away.

Asuna:
Urm...Sure.

(Asuna sat, waited someone so the middle aged clerk called. After a while, a doctor, male, wearing white coat, appeared)

Kurahashi:
Hi. Sorry about that.
I hope you haven't been waiting long.

Asuna:
No, not at all.

Kurahashi:
That's good.
They told you are Asuna Yūki?

Asuna:
Yes.

Kurahashi:
Great. I'm Dr. Kurahashi.
I'm Yuuki Konno's primary physician.

Asuna:
Yuuki Konno...



(Cafeteria in the hospital. Dr. Kurahashi and Asuna sat at the table. Back of Dr. Kurahashi, there was a window view that showed town's prospect. So, the floor must be as high as around tenth. The weather was fine)

Kurahashi:
You know, I'm surprised you even found us.

Asuna:
Why?

Kurahashi:
Oh, well, we keep a low profile.
That's said, Yuuki warned someone called Asuna might try and pay on visit to some point.

Asuna:
She warned you?

Kurahashi:
Uh-huh. She also said, she didn't tell where she was.
So, I said, don't worry about it, she's not gonna find you here.

(The doctor sipped his coffee. Asuna regained her anxious expression)

Kurahashi:
When reception told me you're in a lobby, I was shocked.

Asuna:
Doctor...Has Yuuki told you anything out about me? Or, how we met?

Kurahashi:
I'll say she, yes.
You're pretty much the only person she talks about.
Although...It seems whenever Yuuki does mention you, she always ends up in tears.

Asuna:
...

Kurahashi:
She's always been a brave girl, and never felt sorry for herself.
She wants to see you.
But, she can't bring herself to do it.

Asuna:
Nn...Yes, I know, and I still can't get my head around it.
But, friend of us told me in game, that was for my own good.
...Why is that? Why can't we see each other?

(The doctor placed his cup on the saucer. He looked contemplating something)

Kurahashi:
...For starters, I should tell you what the Medicuboid is about.

Asuna:
...Okay.

Kurahashi:
"Medicuboid" is the code name for the world's first medical full-dive machine.
It's so revolutionally, the government backed its development.

Asuna:
It's a full-dive rig for hospitals?

Kurahashi:
Uh-huh. For example, let's say you are a patient with a visual or hearing disability, this machine can give you back those senses.
You know how with that Amusphere rig?
Images and sounds get sent in electric to your brain.
Well, transmit any signals isn't all it does.
The Amusphere has the ability to cancel out physical sensations, too.
Back here, it is that spot with the electro-magnetic pulses, so it temporarily numbs the nerves.
It's...kind of like a general anesthetic.

Asuna:
Okay...but, how is that useful for hospitals?
There's a limit to how much the Amusphere can block out.
What happens if the patient's in serious pain?

(The doctor was getting enthusiastic with conversation)

Kurahashi:
Exactly! You hit the nail right on the head!
The Amusphere can't do it.
Even the "Nerve Gear" can't block pain from surgery or chronic illness.
However, the Medicuboid enhances the electro-magnetic pulse.
Plus, it's built in the bed so there's more coverage, the brain, spain...everything.
Once it gets on the market, it'll change the course of medicine as we know it.
The Medicuboid has incredible potential!
You could, say, per with the camera, and give it their all function, the patient gets real world images, in real time.

Asuna:
That's great.
Sounds more like a miracle than a machine to me...

Kurahashi:
Yes, in a way, it is a miracle...

(Suddenly, the doctor lowered his tension, like he disappointed something. He took off his glasses)

Kurahashi:
Even so...curing illness is something it can't do.
The Medicuboid is making an impact, though, we hope,...in terminal care.

Asuna:
Terminal care...?

Kurahashi:
Yes. It's helping patients who are dying.

Asuna:
...She's dying?

(The doctor started cleaning his glasses, and continue talking)

Kurahashi:
Yuuki told me that...if you really wanted to hear about what's going on with her, I could go ahead and tell you.

(He put the glasses on again)

Kurahashi:
But, I have to warn you, it's not a pleasant story.
You are going to wish this conversation ended right here...?

Asuna:
No. I wanna here it, the whole thing.
And I'm not leaving here until you'd tell me.

(Asuna and Dr. Kurahashi were changing the place, walking in the hallway)

Kurahashi:
Yuuki was born in May of 2011. But there were complications.
And the doctor said to give her mother had C-section.
Her mother was given the transfusion during the procedure.
...But, unfortunately, the blood they used was contaminated with a virus.

Asuna:
...

Kurahashi:
They didn't find out about it until September, when her mother was having test through on flu infection she got.
But, by that time, the whole family 've been infected.

(They arrived at a certain room. The doctor opened the room using his ID card)

Kurahashi:
This way.
We have to keep the room on the other side of the glass for medically sealed zone, this is the closest you can get.
I hope you understand.

(The doctor operates the console panel which placed in front of the glass window. The light turned on in the room other side of the glass, showed emaciated girl laid on the bed. The huge machine covered upper half of her head. Asuna astonished, and dropped her bag to the floor, placed her both hands on the glass)

Asuna:
Yuuki...
Dr...what kind of illness does Yuuki have?

Kurahashi:
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. AIDS, for short.

(Asuna gasped)

Kurahashi:
It's caused by HIV virus.
It's scary, but, there's hope, because not everyone who has it develops AIDS.
If you can treat HIV early, you can have a long life.

(The camera attached to the room adjusted its focus to Asuna and the doctor)

Kurahashi:
In her family's case, the virus was difficult to treat.
It's a drug resistant strain.
When her mother found out, she got upset over her children's fate.
She actually considered the killing her whole family along with herself.
...But, then, she changed her mind, and decided to fight to the disease instead.

Asuna:
She fought it...for her kids...?

Kurahashi:
Yes. Soon after they were diagnosed, Yuuki was put on the multi-drug course of therapy.
But it was hard for a child to have to take so many different medications, and keep taking them, the side-effects are a one thing.
In the other, being shun by people who don't understand her condition.
Still, Yuuki was a trooper. She believed her and her family would get better eventually.
However...when she was in the fourth grade, her immune system suddenly collapsed.
And then, she was brought to this hospital, and that's when she was diagnosed with AIDS.

(While hearing the doctor's explanation, Asuna couldn't avert her eyes from Yuuki, sleeping in the bed)

Kurahashi:
But, like I said, she's a trooper.
She never once lost optimism...

Asuna:
Doctor...

Kurahashi:
Hmm?

Asuna:
Why's she using the Medicuboid...?

Kurahashi:
I guess, you could say at all started back when everyone was panicking over that Nerve Gear incident.
They had just completed the first prototype of the Medicuboid.
The electro-magnetic pulses it put out, were many time stronger than the Nerve Gear's.
That was a problem. Since no one knew what the long time effects of exposure were.
Because of that, they couldn't find the patient willing take the risk, so its trial run was daunt.
...When I found out, I thought about Yuuki's situation, and I contacted her parents.
If she were the test subject, she be moved the Medicuboid steer and run.
She run less of risk of getting infection.
I told it was an great opportunity.
...At least that what I thought.
But, hencely[?], I still don't know if I was right to suggest it.
God knows, what I was right for Yuuki and her parents.
Thinking about whether or not to accept.
But I think the rule of the unknown, the virtual world, was the deciding fact for Yuuki.
So, that brave little girl agree to be a test subject, and they moved her in.
She's lived inside the Medicuboid, ever since.

Asuna:
You mean, she's never come out?

Kurahashi:
No, she hasn't.
Yuuki stays logged in, and rarely spends any time in the real world.
She's always in a lot of pain.
But, thanks to the Medicuboid's sensation canceller, she can block it out.

Asuna:
So, way, you mean she's in a continue with twenty-four hour dive?
...Since when?

Kurahashi:
For three years now.

Asuna:
That's a whole year longer than us...

(Asuna recalled that Kirito mentioned before)

Kirito:
It felt like they were product of full-dive environment itself...

(Asuna drooped her head. In the Medicuboid, Yuuki watching covertly, sitting, grasped tight her knees)

Asuna:
...Thank you, doctor.
I'm glad I could she her again.
She'll be OK, as long as she's here...right?

Kurahashi:
We are doing everything we can for her.
But even if they're on the sterile, there's no way to eliminate the virus that's inside her.

Asuna:
...What do you mean?

Kurahashi:
Yuuki doesn't have much time left.
...And, that's most likely the reason why she tried cutting ties with you the way she did.

(Tears welled in Asuna's eyes)

Asuna:
That's why she...Yuuki!

(Several events in ALO ran through in Asuna's mind)

Yuuki:
...Asuna...I, I...!
...Nn-fu-fu...We did'it!
...Leave it to me, sis!

(Asuna reminded something)

Asuna:
...Um, doctor? I was wondering.
Does Yuuki have an old sister?

Kurahashi:
Urm...Yes, actually.
A twin sister, to be precise.
Her name's Aiko. And, she was born in few minutes earlier.
Yuuki was the cheerful one.
In fact, Aiko would just sit and watch her, in smile.
...Come to think of it, if Aiko were here, I'd imagine she'd be a lot like you.

Asuna:
Where is she...?

Kurahashi:
Yuuki's parents passed away two years ago, and last year, Aiko.

Asuna:
Yuuki.
...Yuuki!

(Asuna clutched the glass window, began weeping. In the Medicuboid, Yuuki took deep breath, looked she'd determined something)

Yuuki:
Don't cry, Asuna!

(Yuuki's voice was heard from the speaker, it should be installed in the room where Asuna was. Asuna was wondering and searched in the room where the voice came from. In the sterile room, the monitor along the Medicuboid, showed she was talking)

Asuna:
Yuuki...Yuuki, you can hear me!?

Yuuki:
Yeah, I can hear you.
I can see you, too.
Wow...you look exactly like you during the game!
Thanks to coming to see me...

Asuna:
Yuuki...
I just...I don't...

Yuuki:
Hey, doc, Would it be okay if Asuna use the room next door?

Kurahashi:
Sure. Why not?
I keep an Amusphere in there so I can visit her.
Go ahead, it's all yours.

Asuna:
...Thanks!

Yuuki:
The ALO ups on the start up menu.
After you logged in, come to the place where we first met, OK?

(Asuna hastily went out the room, bowed to the doctor. The doctor nodded to Asuna)



(ALO. As soon as Asuna logged in to ALO, she activated her wings, and flew by full speed to Yuuki's place)

Asuna:
I wanna see you...
I wanna see you one more time!
I wanna see you!
And, this time, I wanna talk to you for real!

(Asuna arrived the island in 24th floor, where she first met with Yuuki)

Asuna:
Yuuki! ...Yuuki!

(Asuna shouted Yuuki's name. In the game, the time was just of the end of the night, the sun began to appear in the back of Asuna. Asuna turned back, And, Yuuki was standing there)

Asuna:
Yuuki...

(Asuna ran to Yuuki's place)

Yuuki:
I knew it.
I don't know how you did it, but I had a feeling you'll find me in the real world...somehow.
And, I was so careful not to say nothing, thought I had you fooled...
It didn't work.
You've found me, anyway.
I must be doing psychic, because my prediction's never come true...but I'm happy, really.

(Asuna timidly reached her hand to Yuuki's shoulder. When she was sure that Yuuki wouldn't refuse, Asuna hugged Yuuki tightly)

Yuuki:
...My sis used to hugged me like this.
You smell like her...like the sun.

Asuna:
Did...Aiko...play VRMMOs with you, too?

Yuuki:
Yup.
In fact, she was the first leader of the Sleeping Knights ever had.
And, If you thought I was strong, man, you should've seen her...
We met Siune and other guys in this virtual hospice called Selene Garden.
Back then, we were nine of us.
But, my sis, Clovis, Merida, well they are all gone.
...Anyway, if you wanna know I were disbanding, it's 'cause we promised each other, if we lost someone, we'd ended.
I'm sorry, Asuna. That's why I couldn't tell you.
The Sleeping Knights won't be around any more by this spring.
But it's not 'cause we'll all be too busy to play anymore, it's 'cause little while ago, two of us got the news from our doctors...
They gave us three month.

(Asuna gasped)

Yuuki:
You see? That's why we were also fired up on having one last big adventure together in this world.
We wanted to leave some kind of proof we were here.
On that big, old monument, where everyone can see it.
One last run that was so cool, we could brag about to my sis in the others.
But...nothing was going right for us.
So, we decided the best we to get there, was to get someone tough to enough to help.
But, we just caused you trouble, and, we hurt your feelings, too...
I'm sorry...We all are.
Forget about us...It's probably for the best, anyway.

(Asuna shook her head)

Asuna:
I can't do that.
I'm happy I've got to meet you...all of you.
And, I'm glad that I got to be a part of your last quest.
Even after everything, I still wish I could join the knights.

Yuuki:
Yeah...I wish...I wish you could, too.
And, I'm happy you came here...
And glad to meetya.
Your saying that makes it worth...more than worth it.
That's enough for me...I'm good.

Asuna:
But...isn't there anything you wanna do...?
I mean, I'm sure there's a lot of places I'll find you haven't been yet.
And, other virtual worlds...There's still lots of things to do and places to see!
You can't tell me you've had enough!

Yuuki:
...For the last three years, we've got going tons of adventures and other worlds.
But I want my very last memory, to be the one I got going with you, Asuna.

Asuna:
Yeah, but, do you think of anything out you wanna see, or maybe do?

Yuuki:
...I don't know.
I guess...maybe go to school again?

Asuna:
Eh...for real?

Yuuki:
Nah, forget it, just kidding...
I'm happy you wanna help, but, don't sweat it.
It's cool. I had an awesome life. Really.

(Yuuki turned back to see the sunrise)

Asuna:
...Maybe you can.

Yuuki:
Wait, what?

Asuna:
Maybe you can go, you know, to school!
