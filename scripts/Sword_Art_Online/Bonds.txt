  Suguha:
But now, if this is how it is, I wish you'd kept and being jerked to me...If you had...I wanted when if you raised I felt about you...! I wouldn't felt sad and jealous when I found about her...! And even I'm trying forgetting about you, I'm falling love in Kirito instead!

Kazuto:
...I'm sorry.

Suguha:
...Go on, leave me alone.




Kirito:
I remember the day that everything changed. The day I found out I wasn't really part of this family.
...It felt weird. Like I didn't fit in them anymore. And, I found this out...when I was ten.
I'd wonder, who is she? And...do I really know anything about her? Maybe that feeling I had, if not fitting in, it was the thing that drove me to online gaming.
I guess I figured, in the virtual world, no one knows anything about anyone.
So, I'd override in, and thought where I belonged.
But, those two years I spent trapped in SAO told me something. The difference between the real world and virtual world is slim is best.
It's waste of time asking people who they really are. All you can do is accept as it is. And, have faith in them.
Because, in the end, whoever think they are, that's who they really are.
...When I got the real world and saw Sugu's face, I was really...truly happy. Right then and there, I swore I do whatever I could...to try to close the gap that had grown between us, over the last couple of years.
But, how do I do that?
What can I do...for Sugu?
(Knock, knock)
Sugu? I'll wait for you in Alne, on the north terrace.

Suguha:
...How could I be so horrible to you. And how could you...be so strong?
I wish I could be strong as you, big brother...
I told you then hang in there...to not give up on one you love...but I can't do that.
And, now...I can't stop crying.



Leafa:
(Took deep breath) I guess...this is how it is...? (Sigh)

Racon:
Leafa?

Leafa:
Huh? ...Uh!

Racon:
Er...Hi! Y-you know, I've been looking around all for ya.

Leafa:
Wait...what are you doing here? I thought the Salamanders caught you.

Racon:
Year, well, I sort of poisoned all of them to escape.

Leafa:
No way. You poisoned them?

Racon:
Big time! And after I got a way to tack to here.
Hang on...what are you doing here alone? Where's that Spriggan?

Leafa:
Ah...Oh yeah, well...um...
I kind of...said something really mean to him.
It wasn't cool, and I shouldn't have said it.
It was...play stupid of me.
...Oh, never mind. I'm just being weird.
I'm not gonna be seeing him anymore.
Come on. Let's go back to Sylvain.

Racon:
Don't cry like that...
...Wait!

Leafa:
Er...?

Racon:
You shouldn't be crying like that!

Leafa:
Uh...sorry?

Racon:
The Leafa I know was always smiling and happy!
And I...well, I'll never leave you like that!
I'd stay with you always! In here and in the real world!

Leafa:
Er...

Racon:
I...I, er...Leafa! I mean, Suguha...I love you!

Leafa:
!...You what? Wait, don't do that! No! What are you doing?!

Racon:
Uwah! Ugh! Ah! ...Ugg.

Leafa:
Are...are you OK?

Racon:
...Oh, where did I go wrong?
After everything I said and done I thought always had to do is led the guts could confess my feelings to you.

Leafa:
You really are a moron, aren't you?

Racon:
Ugh...

Leafa:
A-ha-ha-ha...!
Even so, I could learn a thing from you, Fumio.



Kirito:
Um...
Hey.

Leafa:
Here I am.

Kirito:
...Suguha---

Leafa:
Kazuto, I wanna re-match.

Kirito:
Huh?

Leafa:
Let's finish what we started.

Kirito:
...And, this time, no holding back.

Leafa:
Er?
...Now I know why he looks so composed.
Here I come!

Kirito:
What are you doing?

Leafa:
Um...what are you doing?

Kirito:
Um...
Look. I wanna to apologize. But I just didn't know how to go about doing it. So, I was gonna through the duel...

Leafa:
!...You were?

Kirito:
I'm sorry.

Leafa:
...I'm sorry, too.

Kirito:
I think my problem is...I never really came back to the real world after SAO.
And I can't come back until she wakes up.
In a way, the game hasn't ended for me yet.
And, I guess that's why I still haven't figure out how I fit in at home with you.
Not yet anyway.

Leafa:
Hmm...and you do all be there, it doesn't matter how long it takes.
I'll be waiting for the day you come back to us for real!
Until then...I'll help you in here!




Racon:
So, er...wait, what's going on again?

Leafa:
Three players are gonna raid the World Tree today.
He's player one. You're player two. And, yours truly makes three.

Racon:
Oh...Okay, wait...What?!

Kirito:
Yui, you there?

Yui:
Hi daddy. What is it?

Kirito:
I need some info on the guardians.
You learned anything?

Yui:
Their stats of one were not very high, but that's not the problem.
There's just too many of them.
As I see it, this quest is designed to be next impossible to finish.

Kirito:
So, what you saying is...they are adopt the one unbeatable boss, huh?

Yui:
Yes. But, don't forget your skills and EXP are really high.
So, maybe with the bust of speed, you can smash wight through them!

Kirito:
Nn-huh. hey guys, this isn't your fight, the only way I'm gonna get through is your help.
But, time's running out. So, we have to go now.

Leafa:
Don't worry. I'll do whatever I can to get up there.
You ready? Let's see that game face.

Racon:
Huh? Well, I guess, I don't have a choice since we were destined to be together forever---

Leafa:
Okay! Don't talk stupid.

Rakon:
Eww...Sorry.

Leafa:
Geez!
...We are in this together.

Kirito:
Thanks guys. I mean it.
I'll draw the guardian's attention, while I do, stay back and heal me.
You shouldn't be any danger then.

Leafa:
Nn.

Racon:
Mm-hmm.

Kirito:
Nn. Let's go.




Leafa, Racon:
Þú fylla heilagr austr, brott svalr bani!

Kirito:
Wraaah!

Racon:
That's awesome!

Leafa:
There's a lot more coming!

Kirito:
So many of them!

Leafa:
Ah...! Now, Recon!

Recon:
Right!

Leafa, Recon:
Wwra!

Recon:
Er...? Why are the guardian's targeting us instead of him?!

Leafa:
My guess is, they are using a different targeting algorithm than any of other bosses in the game.
It looks like we gonna be doing some fighting after all...

Racon:
Wait!

Leafa:
Wait!

Leafa:
What are you doing?!

Racon:
Wait a sec...Listen, I'm not sure what's going on here, but, like, is this what that important?

Leafa:
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
I don't think it's just a game. Not now, anyway.

Racon:
Nn, umm...
Then I'm gonna help you to help that Spriggan!

Leafa:
Ah...
Wait, Racon!

Racon:
Haah!
Þeír slíta fimm grœnn vindr!

Leafa:
No! You idiot! ...Ah! Heal!

Racon:
Ung!

Leafa:
Racon! That's enough! Go on! Get outside!

Racon:
Hmph.
Ek kalla svartr tjúgari, hverfa himni...

Leafa:
No way! He's using a dark magic spell!

Racon:
...brott regin, gapa Niðafjoll!

Leafa:
A self destruct spell...He used it even know the penalty's worse than normal death.
That dummy...what was he thinking?!

Kirito:
Umm...Raaah! Ugh, gah!

Leafa:
No...
Oh no...Now what?!
He can't keep this up. It's impossible!

Sylph army:
Woaaaah!

Kirito:
What are they Sylphs doing here?

Leafa:
No way, they made it!
Dragons...It's the Cait Sis! And they brought the whole arm---woa!

Sakuya:
Hello, there?
I hope we're not late.

Alicia:
Yeah, sorry!
It took so long to ready, but we're here now!

Leafa:
Ah...Sakuya! Alicia!

Alicia:
OK, dragoons! Get ready to chase these suckers!

Sakuya:
Sylph warriors! Prepare to engage the enemy!

Alicia:
Fire breath, attack!

Sakuya:
Fenrir storm, fire at will!

Kirito:
Aah...

Leafa:
Thank you...Thank you so much for coming!

Sakuya:
You don't have to thank us.
We can't even begin to up here that Spriggan for all he's done.

Alicia:
Sakuya's got a point, you know?
I mean, the only reason we're here for this little late's because of the money he gave us.

Leafa:
Ha ha...

Sakuya:
Warriors! Forward to battle!

Army:
Roooaaaah!

Sakuya:
Destroy them all! Keep going!

Leafa:
Heeya!

Sakuya:
Fu fu...

Kirito:
Eh...Sugu!

Leafa:
Yeah?!

Kirito:
Watch my back, okay?!

Leafa:
You got it!

Kirito:
Humh!

Leafa:
Yyeeya!

Sakuya:
Follow the lead!

Kirito:
Woooa!

Leafa:
Kazuto!

Kirito:
Ugg...!

Leafa:
You can do it...Oh, Kazuto...Go!

Kirito:
Wwwooooooooh!

Sakuya:
Hmm...We're clearing out! Everyone, fallback!

Leafa:
Keep going...Fly!
Keep flying as long as you can!
To the very end!





Kirito:
Damn it!
...Now what would I do?
Hey, Yui.

Yui:
Yes, daddy?
...Daddy, something strange is going on.
This door isn't marked by a quest flag.
It's locked by the system administrator...

Kirito:
What's that supposed to mean?

Yui:
Restricted access, this door was never intended to be open by a player!

Kirito:
...Ah!
No. Wait...That's it!

Yui:
Huh?

Kirito:
Hey, Yui, see if this will work!

Yui:
Ah!
...I'm transferring the code!
We're gonna teleport! Daddy, give me your hand!
