  (ALO, Thrymheim. A cloud of dust raised in the blue, cold room)

Yui:
Punches incoming! To in a low!

(Thrymr leaped to Kirito's party, thrust his fist to the floor of the room, made another cloud. Kirito dodged it by jumping, but was captured by Thrymr's another fist. He was slapped onto the floor)

Leafa:
Ah!

(Sinon released her fire arrow to Thrymr's left side head, distracting him. Klein slashed Thrymr's back with his fire enchanted sword. Leafa hacked Thrymr's right leg by several cutting combo. Kirito tried following his comrade's attack, but Yui warned Thrymr's next move)

Yui:
His ice breath is next! Coming up to three...two...one...now!

(Thrymr emitted white-blue breath to the players. Kirito and the party jumped to dodge. At the rear, Freyja activated some magic, dropping purple thunder onto Thrymr. The thunder made Thrymr fall, and gave moving lag to him)

Kirito:
Now, it's our turn!

Klein, Kirito and Leafa:
Raaaar!



(Falling from the above, Leafa slashed Thrymr diagonally. Kirito and Klein simultaneously cut Thrymr's leg from below to upper. Those attacks exhausted Thrymr's first HP gauge of three)

Thrymr:
Oo...Aaaarrrhh!

Kirito:
It's attack pattern's changing! Stay sharp!

Leafa:
Oh my god...Kazuto! There's only three clear spots left. Can't you use skill connect thing you use before?

Kirito:
He still got two bars left on his HP gauge. Skill connect won't them put denting it.

Thrymr:
Haa...

(Thrymr began inhaling huge amount of air so his stomach bulged, plumped by it)

Kirito:
Watch out! Ice breath's coming up!

(Thrymr's breath was far powerful than before. The entire room front of him engulfed in the ice storm. Kirito and others' cold resistance spell were broken at once)

Leafa:
Oh no...! The buff...Kazuto! we...

(Leafa frozen out in instance)

Kirito:
What the...

(Kirito and others followed Leafa, they all frozen into ice. After Thrymr's massive cold breath attack, everything in front of him was all refrigerated into ice. Then, Thrymr stomped the floor and generated a shock wave to give another blow to his enemy. Frozen out Kirito and others could do nothing but receive the blow directly. The shock wave made them all in front-line fighters' HP gauge into red zone)

Asuna:
Mm...

(Soon, Asuna activated her healing magic. That recovered front-line players' HP some from red zone, but not enough from made them full-recovered)

Asuna:
Get out of there!

Thrymr:
Oohhh...!

(Thrymr raised his right leg to tread on the party. Sinon shot fire arrow to Thrymr's head. It blew on Thrymr's face, made Thrymr blind for seconds)

Kirito:
Sinon! Keep on this before few!

(Kirito and Klein drunk red HP recovery potions. Thrymr's aggro was on Sinon, he swooped down upon her. Sinon maneuvered to dodge Thrymr's attack, jumped, turned herself and kicked his nose to take another jump to leave him. Kirito's HP was almost full recovered)

Freyja:
Swordsman! If we continue this course of action, we will not defeat Thrymr. There is but one hope now. Somewhere in this room, hidden in the plunder, you will find the treasure of my people.

Kirito:
I'm on it. Tell me what it looks like, and I'll grab it.

Freyja:
It is about yea big. It is a hammer made of gold.

Kirito:
Wait, it's a hammer?

(Sinon continued to grab attention of Thrymr's. Kazuto and Leafa were in a quandary while standing in front of huge mound of gold treasures)

Leafa:
Ah...Hey Kazuto, you can find it using a lightning skill!

Kirito:
Lightning? Really?

(Kirito jumped into the air and turning backward. With falling force, he stubbed the ice floor with his two swords. Those swords emitted purple light, so they get lightning magic. The electric current flowed golden treasures. One of the treasures glowed inside the mound)

Leafa and Kirito:
Ah...?

(Leafa and Kirito nodded each other. Kirito dug gold mound, found golden shining hammer)

Kirito:
There it is...

(Kirito tried to pick up the hammer, but it's weight was far more heavy than he expected. Kirito grabbed the hummer with both arms, using his all dorsal muscles. He threw it toward Freyja)

Kirito:
Freyja, catch!

(Freyja, caught the hammer with one her thin right arm, looked and examined it. She was struck by some impulse)

Freyja:
...! It flows...into me...!

Kirito:
...Huh?

Klein:
F-Freyja!?

Freyja:
To me...it overflows...! AAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!

(Freyja's body swelled. She's transforming)

Kirito:
Freyja...? Er...

(When it turned to Kirito and the party, it became muscular, bearded giant. Klein fell on the ground. Everyone got dumbfounded)

Klein:
She's a...a...

Klein and Kirito:
A freakin' dude!?

(The Freyja's name on the status bar was changed)

Kirito:
Oh, He's Thor...The god of thunder.

Thor:
Wwwrraaaaahhh!

(Thor's height was almost the same of Thrymr's. Both walked with earthquake-like tremble until they faced each other)

Thor:
You despicable giant! Your treachery and deceit has come to an end! And now, you shall pay for stealing Mjölnir!

(Thor was hitting down his hammer on Thrymr. Thrymr blew cold air to his right hand, he made one handed ax and blocked Thor's attack with it. They began hitting each other with their fists)

Thrymr:
I shall make you pay for deceiving me, you miserable excuse of a god! I shall rip that beard from your face, and send your body back to Asgard!

Sinon:
Thor's pulling aggro from Thrymr! Let's attack while we can!

Asuna:
Nn.

Kirito:
Here we go guys! Hit him hard! Don't hold back! Use all your sword skills!

Klein:
Freyjjaaa!

(Klein activated his fire sword skill, and attacked Thrymr)

Asuna:
Um..!

(Asuna materialized her rapier, and made a stab to Thrymr's Achilles' tendon)

Lisbeth:
Wrah!

(Lisbeth, with green lighting flail, hit Thrymr's little toe. That made him cry)

Thrymr:
Ugg...Arrr!

(Silica attacked over with her dagger, glowing blue light, on Thrymr's back, and stepped away from him. Thrymr went down on his knee)

Kirito:
This is it!

(Kirito and his party showered their attack to immovable Thrymr, his second HP gauge was exhausted, and he collapsed and handed his two hands on the floor)

Thor:
Return to your abyss! King of the Giants!

(Thor struck down his hammer on Thrymr's head. The purple thunder struck along with it. It destroyed Thrymr's crown. He was turning into the huge ice block)

Thrymr:
Ugg...heh heh heh...brag in your victory, insects...But, take heed...If you put your faith in a dogs of As...

(Thor struck again Thrymr with his hammer. Thrymr vanished and turned into a huge amount of cold air)

Thor:
You have my gratitude, brave fairy warriors. Thanks to you, my treasure has returned, and my disgrace avenged. Now then, I must reward you.

(Thor extracted golden ingot from his hammer, Mjölnir, and bestowed it to Klein. The ingot became two handed hammer. its
size was miniature, but the shape was almost the same of Thor's)

Thor:
That is Mjölnir, the Lightening Hammer. Use in the noble battles. Farewell, my champions!

(Thor raised his hammer. It emitted bright light, and he disappeared into it)

Kirito:
Whew...

Leafa:
Fu fu...

(Kirito approached Klein, and patted his shoulder)

Kirito:
Congrats, pal. You've got a legendary weapon.

Klein:
Yeah, but...It's the hammer. I don't get no hammer skills!

(Klein wept. Then the whole room shook, crumbling)

Sinon:
The room's moving! ...Wait, is it floating!?

Leafa:
Hey, Kazuto! I don't think this quest is over yet!

Kirito:
Huh...?

(Recollection)
Urðr:
Good fairies, infiltrate Thrymheimr, remove Excaliber from it's plinth, and save my realm...

Leafa:
Look at the medallion...It's all black except that one clear spot!

Yui:
Daddy! A stairway leading down has just appeared behind the throne!

Kirito:
Seriously!?

(Everyone ran to the stairway)

Kirito:
...Let's go.

(At the bottom of the stairway, it was also the bottom of entire dungeon, Kirito and the party stood in front of the plinth where Excaliber stuck on. Kirito reminisced the last occasion when he used the sword)
Kirito:
System command! Generate object! ID:"Excaliber!"

Kirito:
Long time no see...

(Kirito grabbed it's hilt, tried to pull off the sword from the dais. But despite pulling with his all might, the sword moved not an inch)

Kirito:
Ummm...

Asuna:
You got it, Kirito!

Lisbeth:
Come on! Pull harder!

Sinon:
Put your back into it!

Yui:
Don't get back, daddy!

Silica:
You can do it! I know you can do it!

Pina:
Cwahh!

Klein:
Go, keep pulling!

Kirito:
Uggggrrrr...!

(The plinth had crack around where the sword stung)

Kirito:
Urrraaahhh!

(The sword pulled off from its plinth. The blinding light filled the room. As soon as the sword pulled off, the dais broke and the tree root grew by incredibly speed from where the sword stuck. The root trained spiral staircase the party used to descend, and pushed walls of the dungeon, broke them)

Klein:
Oh crap...It's breakin' up!

Yui:
Daddy! Thrymheim is collapsing! We have to leave here now!

Kirito:
I know, I know...!

(Training root broke the column where the staircase were around. The bottom of the the dungeon, or the top of the upside down pyramid, was hanged by single string of the tree root)

Klein:
Hee hee...alright! Looks like it's up to me to save the day! Time for some Olympic grade high-jumping! ...Ouch!

(Klein tried to reach for tearing tree root, but he couldn't make it. The root torn off. The floor of the room, where the party were, began falling)

Everyone:
Eeeeek!

(The roof of the Jötunheimr was high enough to fall several minutes. Everyone clung on to tree roots remaining the falling floor)

Kirito:
...We're so screwed. Leafa, how much time we've got?

Leafa:
...We made it...Thank god! We made it!

(Leafa watched her emerald amulet. It still embraced one green spot, meaning the jellyfish-elephant-like creature's extinction was averted. Leafa hugged Kirito in joy. While Kirito hugging back to Leafa, he was busy operating his console window)

Kirito:
Looks like I can't claim Excaliber unless the quest is cleared...

(Kirito heaved regretful sigh. Leafa's ears caught some sound)

Leafa:
Er...did you hear that?

Kirito:
Huh?

Leafa:
Ah, there it is again!

(Leafa stood up, walked to the edge of the falling floor. Tonky was coming to rescue them)

Leafa:
Tonky!

Tonky:
Grrooow!

Leafa:
We're saved!

Kirito:
Hurry guys! Hop on his back!

(The party members hopped to Tonky's back, except Klein and Kirito. Kirito nudged him jump to the creature's back)

Kirito:
...We're running out of time.

Klein:
Yeah, I know! ...weh...We sure weren't so high up...?

Kirito:
Go on...Jump!

Klein:
Dyeehhh!?

(Kirito pushed Klein's back, he dropped from the edge of the floor, failed to land Tonky's back. But Tonky caught Klein by his long nose)

Klein:
...Hey, Tonky. Thanks for saving my ass...

(Next, Kirito was going to jump to Tonky's back. However, Excaliber was too heavy to carry for jumping with. So Kirito had to decide whether he should abandon the sword)

Kirito:
I guess, you're still too heavy for me...

Yui:
Daddy...?

Kirito:
Seriously...stupid Cardinal System...?!

(Kirito made his decision, he threw away the sword, and jumped on Tonky's back. He watched Excaliber falling into the bottom of the crater, with regretful expressions. Sinon walked to the edge of Tonky's back, picked out an arrow from her case)

Sinon:
...That's about two hundred meters.

Everyone:
Huh?

Sinon:
...Ek skýt aftur ör.

(It was Sinon's "Retrieve Arrow" spell. Sinon shot an arrow to the falling Excaliber. The arrow was attached with magic string so if the arrow hit the target, the spell caster can retrieve it by pulling string)

Kirito:
You gotta be kidding...

(The arrow hit the sword. Sinon hauled it up)

Sinon:
Wow...heavy!

Everyone:
Si-si-si-Sinon...That was awesome!

Sinon:
Oh, don't look at me like that. You can have it. Here.

Kirito:
Thanks! You're the best!

Sinon:
...I'll give it to you but with one condition. You gotta promise me, every time you draw it, you have to think about me...okay?

All girls except Sinon:
Umm...

Klein:
Well, well...The chit magnet got another girl f---

(Kirito kicked up Klein's chin)

Klein:
Gwoph...!

Kirito:
(Harrumph) You've got it. I'll think about you every time I draw it. Thanks a lot.

Sinon:
You're more than a welcome. Fu fu...

(Sinon winked to Kirito)

Tonky:
Grrooor...

(The entire castle of Thrymheim was collapsed)

Lisbeth:
Man, it sucks...really got to do one quest. And it's now gone for good...

Silica:
I know, it seems like such a waste...

(All debris of the castle fall into the dried-up lake, the Great Void. At the time when the castle's debris reached the bottom of the lake, a massive water column arose from the desiccated ground. It filled the crater up to full with water. The massive tree which covered entire roof of Jötunheimr reached it's root to the well, spread it's arm all over the lake)

Asuna:
Look at that! It's sprouting!

(From spread roots, all type of plant grew on it, sprouted green leaves. Birds came back to the land and flew around. The sun shined over the world)

Silica:
So warm...

(A waterfall made moisture. Jötunheimr regained its fertile state, was not withered land anymore)

Tonky:
Roooah!

Sinon:
He's happy...

(They heard elephant-like roar from every place from the ground, it's not from Tonky. A number of the creature re-spawned. It brought back it's population)

Leafa:
I'm happy too...Isn't this great, Tonky? Look, all of your friends have come to say hi, you see 'em? They're all waiving...You're popular guy.

(Urðr appeared)

Urðr:
You've removed Excaliber from its plinth. The quest has been completed. Now that the sword witch slices wood and iron is secure. Jötunheimr can return to it's former glory. It is all thanks to you and your bravery. My younger sisters would also like to express their gratitude toward you.

(On the Urðr's right side, Verðandi materialized herself)

Verðandi:
My name's Verðandi. Thank you, all brave fairy warriors. To think I can gaze upon green Jötunheimr again, ah...it's like a dream.

(With twirling wind, Skuld appeared on the left side. Klein was struck in his mind by something)

Skuld:
And my name is Skuld. You have my thanks, and respect.

(Verðandi generated light, passed it to Skuld. Skuld gave a breath to it, the light dust poured on Kirito and others. They noticed their status windows opened, perhaps they received some status update on themselves)

Urðr:
My gift to you...shall be the holy sword.

(Urðr leveled her arm, pointed the sword Kirito held. The sword disappeared. Instead, a new window popped up on Kirito's. On the window, it was described "QUEST BONUS: Excaliber." So the holy sword was now belonged to Kirito)

Kirito:
Ah...Yes!

Urðr, Verðandi and Skuld:
Thank you, noble fairies. Until we meet again.

(The banner popped up in front of Kirito. It said "Holy Sword of the Frozen Palace: Quest Clear")

Kirito:
We've finally cleared it...ha...

(Three goddesses were flying away from the party. Klein ran to the edge of Tonky's back, shouted)

Klein:
Um...Excuse me, Lady Skuld! Can I get your number!?

Everyone:
Eh...

(Skuld turned back to Klein, waived her hand, send some light particles to Klein. We don't know what she gave to Klein, but Klein's face was filled with satisfaction. Three goddesses were disappeared into the sky)

Lisbeth:
Hmph...right now, I respect you more than ever Klein. You can be a dork, but you've got heart.



(Real world. Kazuto, Shino, and Suguha were at Dicey Cafe, where Agil run)

Kazuto:
How's that, Yui?

Yui:
I can see perfectly, daddy! And, I can hear, too!

Shino:
Cool, but...What is it?

Kazuto:
I'm tuning real-time footage on the cafe into mock 3D-images. Okay, try moving, but take it slow.

Yui:
Okay!

Kazuto:
If it's working right, Yui should feel like she's flying around the room.

Yui:
Eh heh heh...

Shino:
I get it...That camera and it's mike are acting like Yui's eyes and ears. But a hand it to Yui, that's pretty clever.

Suguha:
Kazuto's taking a class called Mech---mecha-something.

Kazuto:
It's "Mechatronics."

Suguha:
Like I was saying, taking this mecha-thing class, he has to do a project so he came up this idea. But if you ask me, he's just doing for Yui.

Yui:
You're spoiling me, daddy.

Kazuto:
Nn?...ha ha...



("Reserved for the day!" The plate hung on the front door of the cafe said that)

Kazuto:
Nice job guys! We got the Holy Sword Excaliber, and Mjölnir, the Lightning Hammer. Congrats! ...To 2025...To us!

Everyone:
To us!

(Suguha, Asuna, Ryoutarou, Keiko, Risa, Shino, and Kirito, all the party members who participate to Excaliber quest gathered to year-end party. There are many food plates on the table. They toasted with orange juice)

Shino:
Hey...I was wondering. Why did they call it Excaliber in the game?

Kazuto:
Huh? What do you mean "why?"

Shino:
Well...usually in the fantasy books or comics I've read always called it "Caliburn," not "Excaliber."

Kazuto:
Urm...I don't know.

Suguha:
No way. You don't seem like someone who'd be a fan in fantasy books?

Shino:
Nn...When I was in middle school, I pretty much lived in the library. I spent all my time in there reading books about "King Arthor." Every one of 'em read for it as "Caliburn."

Asuna:
Actually, didn't the sword go by a lot of different names in most of those legends?

Shino:
Depending on which Celtic language. But the word "Caliber" is cool, because which called diameter of a gun barrel. And it's also highly describe the quality of the person's character.

(Shino glanced at Kazuto)

Suguha:
Thanks for the lesson, teach!

Shino:
Sorry, if I got carried away there...

Risa:
So, basically what you saying is...Whoever owns Excaliber, has to be someone who's exceptional person!

Keiko:
Huh, who is? You mean, Kirito?

Risa:
Yeah, of course! Duh! In fact, he's so except, you know, he wouldn't think twice about paying for dinner with some of those crazy money he made...Right?

Kazuto:
Ugh...y-Yeah, I was saving it for a surprise, but, yeah, totally...This dinner's on me!

Everyone:
(Cheer)

(On the last cut, Kirito and everyone in the party in the photograph. They all were on Tonky's back. Kirito posed with Excaliber. Klein was with his Mjölnir)

[End of the episode]
