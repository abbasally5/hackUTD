  Sinon:
A type... 54, "Black Star"...!?
It's the gun... Why...? Why him...? Why did he have that gun...!?




(Sinon was panic attacked. She ghostly hear someone laughing. The eyes of Death Gun glowing red rolled to white, then she saw those eyes tuned into somebody else's. Maybe those are ones from the robber who she killed that day)

Sinon:
What is the mean to be strong...? To be brave? I thought, somehow, I could learn know still something from Kirito...! I don't wanna die!

Bang.

(Sinon closed her eyes tight. Though, after gunshot, there seemed no reduction of her life gauge. When she opened her eyes again, there was Death Gun who staggering from the shot that hit his right shoulder)

Bang.

(Another shot from the behind of Death Gun. It grazed his left shoulder. Death Gun dashed to cover him into nearby building. He promptly counter attacked with his long rifle, Silent Assassin. Someone threw a something into the place)

Sinon:
A grenade!?

(Death Gun retreated. Paralyzed Sinon could only wait the grenade detonating. But, the grenade was actually a smoke bomb. In the smoke, appeared Kirito lifted Sinon and her rifle, carried them away)

Sinon:
Kiri-to...?
I'm slowing you down. Just leave me.

(While Kirito was running, there's a shot from his behind. It seemed they were still chased by Death Gun yet. They arrived a parking lot. Several baggies and a robot horse are ready waiting someone rode them)

Sinon:
Not... the horse. It can go fast, but it's too hard to handle.

(Kirito chose to ride buggy. He placed his hand to the sign board and paid to rent. He started igniting the engine)

Kirito:
Sinon, get your rifle, and blow that horse away!

Sinon:
Eh...what? ...Alright. I'll try.

(She aimed at the robot horse and tried to pull the trigger)

Sinon:
Huh? No... my finger...? I can't pull... I can't do it! I can't pull the trigger!

(While Sinon's struggling, there's Death Gun running around the corner, he saw Kirito and Sinon)

Kirito:
Hang on tight!

(Kirito started buggy running)

Sinon:
Ah... It's no use...

Kirito:
We can still get him away! Stay sharp! Damn it!

(Death Gun could a ride on the horse. The robot horse was approaching fast, so their distance was becoming shorter)

Sinon:
No! He's getting now... Hurry! Faster! Please, don't let him catch up to us!

(Death Gun shot with his handgun, that could cause death in the real life. The shot flew fast near Sinon and Kirito)

Sinon:
Help me...! I can't do this! I don't wanna die!

Kirito:
Hey! Sinon! Snap out of it! Listen, he's catching up with us! Take up your gun, and shoot him!

Sinon:
N-No, I can't...

Kirito:
You don't have to hit him, just distract him!

Sinon:
I can't! It make me... too weak me...

Kirito:
Then get up here and steady still. Give me your gun, I'll shoot him!

Sinon:
Er...
Hecate... She's part of me... I'm the only one who can use her...

(Sinon readied to aim with her rifle at Death Gun. But her right index finger didn't move. She couldn't pull the trigger)

Sinon:
I can't do it. I can't shoot. I can't move my finger. I can't. I can't fight anymore...!

Kirito:
You can! Everyone give fight if they want to! It's your choice on whether it'd be! Will you give up, or will you fight!?

Sinon:
If it's my choice, I don't want to fight anymore... I'm done, I don't want to suffer anymore... I thought I could get stronger playing this game, but I was wrong.
...!

(Kirito put his hand on Sinon's hand. Now, the baggie was handled by Kirito's left hand only)

Kirito:
I'll help you. But, you have to try. So, come on. You can do this.

Sinon:
It's no good! With all these shaking around, can't a gun!

Kirito:
It's OK. The shaking the gun's stop in three, two, one... Now!

(The buggy ran over an wasted car, makes the buggy flew into the sky. A vibration from running a buggy on the road stopped)

Sinon:
How's he do it...? How could he be so calm now...? No... It's not that he's being calm. He's getting it everything he's got. When he fights, he goes all out every time, no excuses...

(Sinon's right index finger began to accept her will)

Sinon:
That's it. That's where he gets his strength!

(Sinon pulled the trigger of her rifle. But her bullet went forward to the left of Death Gun)

Sinon:
I missed...?

(Her bullet hit the car wasted there nearby Death Gun. Her gun shot hit the car's engine. It caught fire, and then, exploded. A blaze surrounded Death Gun and his horse)




(Running away from ruined city, they were now in a desert land where they could hardly see anything but sparsely standing cacti)

Kirito:
This isn't good. We're like sitting ducks out here. We need to find some cover.

Sinon:
Hey, I think I see a cave little over there. We hide inside. We can avoid the sat's scan.

Kirito:
Sounds good. Let's go.

(Kirito brought the buggy to inside the cave. They were taking a rest there)

Kirito:
This is perfect. We can dodge the scan and rest up too.
What happened back there? It's like he just popped out of nowhere. We didn't see him on the scan. That must mean he's got some kind of cloaking skill. Is there the skill like that here? If is it the ability?

Sinon:
Yeah, there is. It's the skill called Meta-Material Optical Camouflage. We're safe, who know anyway. Even if he's invisible, the sound would rap here where he'll clench under his boots. We'll see his foot prints too. So, he can't sneak up like he did before.

Kirito:
Roger that. Well, I guess we'll keep our eyes end ears open.

Sinon:
Hey, Kirito... Do you think there's a chance Death Gun's killed in that explosion?

Kirito:
No, the second that track pulled up, I saw him jumped up from that robot horse. He might've got dinged-up. But I can't believe that blast killed him.

Sinon:
Oh... When he hid an inside back at the stadium I thought I was a goner. How did you know I was in a trouble? And how did you get to me so fast from your position?

Kirito:
We were wrong about Jushi X being Death Gun. I took one look, and I knew it wasn't. 't was pretty obvious, actually.

Sinon:
Obvious?

Kirito:
Yeah, I know woman when I see one.

Sinon:
Oh.

Kirito:
In second I thought, I knew he overlook something. I didn't know what, though. Oh, by the way, even if her handle said Jushi, she calls herself Musketeer X. Anyway, after I took out Musketeer X, I looked over the south and saw you are in the street. I knew you were in the trouble, so I grabbed her rifle and grenade to charge it in. Shooting and tossing bomb as fast as I could.

Sinon:
I can't believe I let guard down like that.

Kirito:
Don't go beat self up over it. ...I mean, look, it's not like I knew he was hiding down there either. And if our roles were flipped, you know what? I would've been the one get shot instead. But, that's OK. Because, I know you would've rescued me too, wouldn't you?

Sinon:
I can't believe it...! My rival's trying to make me feel better. He knows I'm weak, and here he is... Consoling me, like I'm kid or something...

Kirito:
I'm heading up for a bit. You might've as well as kicked back here, and rest up all you can. I with you could logged out but I know you can't, not till the tourney's over, anyway.

Sinon:
Huh?
...You're going after Death Gun, aren't you? You think you can take him all alone?

Kirito:
Yeah, I have to. He's tough, and he won't go down without getting over shot it to me. If he comes down to that, I don't know what I'll do. I might bail. I don't wanna leave you hang on like that. So, it's better if I face him alone.

Sinon:
Then... you're scared of him too?

Kirito:
Yeah, I am. If it is the old me. I would jump and try to fought him, even if there was a chance if I was gonna die. But, not anymore. These days, there's things I have to protect. I can't die. I don't want to.

Sinon:
Things you have to protect?

Kirito:
Yeah. In the virtual world, and the real one too.

Sinon:
Hm, OK. Then, don't go after him. Just stay here, and keep low. As long as BoB's going on, we can't log out. But once the competition's little down to us and the other player, we can suicide out and let the other guy win. That'll end the tournament.

Kirito:
Yeah, I don't know. I mean, that's one way of doing it. Thing is, it's not really a good option. If we'd sit here and wait for the tourney'd end. There's no telling how many players that guy's gonna kill.

Sinon:
Yeah.
You really are strong after all...
I'm not gonna hide either.

Kirito:
Huh?

Sinon:
I'm going out side, and help you take that bastard out.

Kirito:
No, you're not! Haven't you been listening!? If he shoot you, there's a chance you'll die! As a player, close combat is my specialty, it's not yours! You're in way more danger than me, because he can be invisible if he want. He'll pop up next to you, and bang!

Sinon:
I don't care if I die.

Kirito:
...

Sinon:
I was scared out of my mind backed at the stadium. I was scared if I was gonna die. I was even weak as I was five years ago, like a screaming, crying little girl. If that's how I'm gonna be for the rest of my life, I'd rather be dead.

Kirito:
It's only natural to be afraid. I don't know anyone who's not afraid of dying.

Sinon:
Yeah, well, I hated. I'm tired of being afraid. ...I'm so tired. Whatever, I'm not asking to go with you, I'll fight by myself.

Kirito:
You wanna fight alone, and, die alone. Is that what you are saying?

Sinon:
Yeah, I was always supposed to die alone. Let go! I have to do this.

Kirito:
You've got it all wrong! There's no dying alone, it's not that simple. When you die, you leave a whole and all the people whose lives you are part of. And, like it or not, you are part of mine now.

Sinon:
Yeah, well. I've never asked to part of it. Besides, my life is no one else's business but mine.

Kirito:
You're wrong. We involved each other's lives now.

Sinon:
...Alright, if that how it is, then you can protect me for the rest of my life!

(Sinon burst into cry. Hitting her fist at Kirito's chest again and again)

Sinon:
You know anything! And, you can do anything, so don't go saying stuff like that. This... this is the true fight. It's mine! Mine! You've got that!? Even if I lose, even if I die! You won't get blamed from what I did... You wanna help? You're gonna carry this burden with me!? Then what? Huh? You're gonna hold my hands? Even though, they've got blood over him!?

(In her past? or in her imagination, little Shino was surrounded by several children. They are calling her...)

Children:
Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer!

Child A:
Murderer!

Child B:
You murderer!

Child C:
You kill anyone today!
Eww... Don't touch me!

(She saw her hands. They were smeared by blood)

Child C:
You get me all bloody!

Child B:
Won't you see yourself!

Child A:
Murderer!

...

(She left from that place, left to the darkness, alone. Backed to the present time, Sinon continues hitting Kirito's chest, and crying aloud. Kirito tried to place his hand on her shoulder, but Sinon snapped it)

Sinon:
Hate you! I hate your guts! I hate you...!

(Sinon cried, sank and sat in tears. It took some time before she regain her calm. Kirito and Sinon were still sitting in the cave)

Sinon:
...Even though, I hate your guts. Can I borrow your lap for a sec.

(Sinon laid on the ground, using Kirito's lap as her headrest. She took deep breath. Then, she was starting to speak)

Sinon:
I... I killed someone.

(Indifferent looking Kirito glanced at Sinon when she started speaking)

Sinon:
About five years ago, in the small town of north, this guy trod upon the post office. A news said the robber died because, his gun went off accidentally. But the truth is, I was there. I grabbed his gun, and shot him dead...

Kirito:
How old were you?

Sinon:
I was eleven years old. And, ever since then, whenever I see a gun, I start throwing up, and then I passed out. If I see a gun, I see the face of the robber, the way he looked right before he died. And then I... I get so scared.

Kirito:
Really?

Sinon:
Yeah. But, in this world, I don't have those problems. And that come from thinking... If I can become the strongest player in the game, then I'll be strong, I'm allowed too. And, maybe even forget what I did. But, just now, I mean, when Death Gun had me pinned, I was terrified. And just like that, I wasn't Sinon anymore, I was the real me again... I'm scared to die. I am, although... what's worth is living in this sphere...? It's so painful that I rather be dead... But I know, if I run away, from Death Gun and my past, I'll end up weaker than before! I will. I know it!

Kirito:
Yeah... I get it. I killed someone once too.

Sinon:
What?

Kirito:
I mentioned it once, but how I knew Death Gun. We fought before when we stuck in another game. I'm sure you've heard of it, Sword Art Online.

Sinon:
...Oh my god, I knew it.

Kirito:
Yeah, I'm a survivor of SAO. It's so with Death Gun. And back then, he was a red player. And his guild, they called themselves Laughing Coffin, PKers. They've had to be stopped. So one day, a party was formed to catch them whole after prison. I was in that party. They found out about the plan and ambushed us. And, middle in the chaos, I killed two of Laughing Coffin. I just... cut 'em down. And no for time, I managed to force myself to forget what I did ...to yesterday, when I run into the guy called himself Death Gun.

Sinon:
And there's no doubt he was with Laughing Coffin that day? You sure he was in party that ambush?

Kirito:
I am. About the sure I was ever be. He's one of the player we took the prison that day. That's why, no matter what, I have to settle things with him in here. In this world.
