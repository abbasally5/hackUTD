  (ALO, a town's bar)

Yuuki:
Hey guys! This is Miss Asuna! Miss Asuna, This is my guild, the Sleeping Knights.

Jun:
My name is Jun. What's up? How's it going!?

Talken:
er...H-Hi, Miss Asuna...I-I'm Talken. I-It's nice to meet y...ah...!?

Nori:
You really need to get a grip on those nervous talks, seriously! Every time meet a girl, you turned into a blubbering mess! Anyway, My name's Nori. Glad to meetya.

Siune:
My name is Siune. It's wonderful to meet you. And, so much thank you for coming today!

Tecchi:
It's pleasure to meet you. My name's Tecchi.

Yuuki:
Er, A~nnnd! I'm Yuuki! The leader of this guild, a kind and sort of...Miss Asuna, don't laugh, but see, we wanna be the only guild to beat the boss on this floor. And we want you to help us!

Asuna:
Huh...? Eh!? Huuh!?

Yuuki:
(Smile)



Asuna:
It's fairly ambitious, but a boss raid usually takes at least forty-nine players, that seven parties with seven players the piece. So no matter how skilled you are, it's just seven players. That's kind of...well, it'd be perfectly honest it's, in realistic...

Yuuki:
Yeah, I've thought it is, isn't it...? Only tried taking on the bosses on the floor twenty-five, and six in the same way.

Asuna:
Huh...!? Ju-Just you six!?

Yuuki:
Yup. And if you ask me, we put up a pretty good fight, too! But, whole times, this huge guild swept in and beat them before we could figure out our next move.

Asuna:
Er...why would you even risk it...?

Siune:
That's a story. Because back to we met in another game's net community. We hit it off right away, and we've been friends ever since. But...we only have until next spring to go on quests together. Since our time is limited, we wanted to make the most of it. You see...coming spring, we'll all be busy with other things. So, we decided that before we disbanded the guild, we had to do something so amazing, so unbelievable we'd remember it forever!

Nori:
Nn-huh.

Asuna:
So, that's why you wanna do this boss raid...

Siune:
Exactly. If we defeat a boss together, our names will be inscribed on the monument of swordsmen. You know, the one of the town of beginnings, in a black iron palace. I know it sounds silly, and, maybe even little vain...but, we really wanna get our names upon that wall. No matter what. But...getting them on there is a hard part. If a boss is defeated by a party, then all of it's members will get their names inscribed on the monument. But if it's beaten by multiple parties, working in tandem, only the names of the party leaders get inscribed.

Asuna:
Ahh...

Siune:
That's the catch. If we want the names of everyone of Sleeping Knights upon that wall, we have to beat the boss...together. Just us, no one else...So, we talked over and came up with the plan. A party can have up to seven players max. Therefore, we decided to find someone who strong, or even stronger than most powerful player, Yuuki. In hope whoever we found, accept our invitation.

Asuna:
I get it, that's why you were dueling.

(Asuna told Yuuki)

Sine:
Well, what do you think about joining up with us!? We can't pay you very much, but you're welcomed what we have...?

Asuna:
E-er...Oh no! That's OK! Er...Boss raids cost a fortune, so, you should use your money for that! I feel horrible taking your money, really. I-If you want, you can give me whatever boss drops, and I'll be fine!

Siune:
Really!? Then, you join our party!?

(Everyone at the round table stared Asuna. Asuna contemplated for a minute. For some reason, Asuna saw former herself in the reflection on the glass cup, when she was in Aincrad, a swordwoman wearing white armor with red colored hem)

Asuna:
This is nothing like how the old Aincrad was... And yet, here I am thinking about...safety margins in, the odds of winning. Having safe fights, and certain victories...there's more fun the game is than that? I bet Yuuki and her friends are already noticed, better than I do...
Okay, let's see how far we can go.

Everyone:
Yes!
Awesome!

Asuna:
...In the end, it's not about winning or losing, let's having fu---!?

(Yuuki grabbed Asuna's two hands)

Yuuki:
Thanks of bunch, Miss Asuna!

Asuna:
Ah, ha...Please, I-I prefer it if you just call me Asuna.

Yuuki:
Nh-fu-fu...And, you can call me Yuuki.

Asuna:
It reminds me, Miss Yuuki...Sorry, Yuuki, the duel was all about testing players, right?

Yuuki:
Yup, pretty much!

Asuna:
Then, you must've gone up against ton of strong players before I showed up. Do you remember ever fighting with Spriggan dressed in black? He would've been using a one-handed sword.

Yuuki:
Huh...You know what? I do...man, he was pretty tough.

Asuna:
Then...why didn't you ask him to help you out?

Yuuki:
Nn...I don't know. He just wasn't right.

Asuna:
Well, why not?

Yuuki:
...He'd undone my secret. I can't help that.

Asuna:
...?

(Asuna and other party members were out of the bar)

Asuna:
Okay, so, for tomorrow, how about we meet back here one?

Everyone:
You got it!
I accept.
Roger that.

Asuna:
And, let's have fun.

Everyone:
Right!

(The party was dismissed. "I'll explain when I get back." Asuna messaged to Lisbeth, and she walked around the park alone. Then, the world suddenly shut down)



Asuna:
Uh...!

(Asuna awoke in the the real world. By bedside, her mother stood, and looked down Asuna. The power cord of Amusphere rig's was wound up in mother's hand)

Asuna:
...Wha---! Mom! What are you doing!

(Asuna looked at the clock. It was 18:35)

Asuna:
Er...

Mother:
Last month, when you are late for dinner, I told you it better not happen again. And, here we are...You are late because of that game, so now you loose your privileges.

Asuna:
Nn...I just lost track of time...! That's my fault, I'm sorry...But, you don't have to go on pull the plug on me like that! You could've shaking me, or even yelled on my ear! I would've gotten a lot in game, and then I could've logged out...

Mother:
I tried that approach before. It took you five minutes to snap out of it, remember?

Asuna:
Wh...yeah...I-I had to say good bye to everyone before I logge---

Mother:
Hold on! Give me that! What you doing some stupid virtual game does not take priority over your commitment in your real world...ever!

Asuna:
Nn...hmm...I'm sorry...I'll be more careful next time.

Mother:
This will be your last warning. If you break your word to me because of that think again, I'm confiscating it. I have no idea what's going on in the head of yours... You lost two years of your life because of that...that infernal machine. You could've died. How can you even stand to look at it?

Asuna:
...This isn't the Nerve Gear, mother.

(For some reason, Asuna lowered her face, gritting her teeth)

Mother:
...It's dinner time. Get changed and come down stairs.

Asuna:
I'm not hungry.

Mother:
...As you wish.

(The mother closed the door of Asuna's room, left her alone. Asuna languidly stood, walked to her closet, and opened it. The electric powered opening motion of the doors was so slow, Asuna violently pushed to open the closet doors.
Asuna was walking out side of the house. The sky was covered by dark clouds. She sat on the arch type bollard at the entrance of the park, took out her smartphone. It's light made her face stood out in the night park. She slid her finger on the screen to move up it's call history two times. On the screen, there are names of Rika, Kazuto, and her mother. She stared the screen. She almost begin to cry. Instead dropping her tears, the snow began falling. The ice flake of the snow touched her forelock, and immediately melted, dropped through her cheek. She didn't move. She was quietly sitting at the entrance of the night park)



(ALO, the same bar from yesterday)

Yuuki:
Sounds like a good lineup, right? ...huh? Asuna~?

Asuna:
...Er? ...Ah, So...Yuuki, Jun, and Tecchi are in front. Then, Talken and Nori are middle range. And, Siune and I are the backup? Right, then I guess...If you were covered, maybe I should hang back at the real guard.

Yuuki:
Yeah...sorry. I feel bad you are not front, you are so good at the sword...

Asuna:
Oh, I don't mind at all. I'm afraid I'm not much good as a tank. And anyway, I'm curious to see whether Jun and Tecchi can survive a proper beat down.

Jun, Tecchi:
Er...

Jun:
Don't worry about us! We ban handle it!

Asuna:
Well, I guess...Alright, ready to go take a peek at that boss through?

Everyone:
Yeah!




(The 26th floor's labyrinth, where the floor both hid. The labyrinth did not have intricate path. Yuuki went forward while she slashed off the lizard-man)

Yuuki, Jun:
Yeah!

(They high-touched, resumed an exploration)

Asuna:
What a team...! I wonder if they really need me after all? ...sigh. I can't believe how quickly you guys are clearing the labyrinth. You are amazing group of players.

Yuuki:
Mm...heh heh...Ah! It's a boss room! Come on!

Asuna:
...Yuuki, hold it!

(She stopped all members at the little distant from the boss chamber)

Asuna:
Ek kalla fimm fiskr, brjóta ljúga galdr.

(It was "Searcher" magic. Several small blue fish shape lights were born from her hand. Asuna blew her breathe, the magical fishes swam towards boss chamber's entrance. They uncovered hidden other players)

Nori:
Eh...? Look!

Player A:
Wh-whoa! Hey! Hang on! Hang on! We weren't here to fight you!

Asuna:
Then, lower your weapons! Now.

Player A:
Get rid of it!

(A man looked a leader of the party of three whispered to other two players, to answer Asuna's request hastily. And Asuna whispered to her comrade)

Asuna:
Keep your eye on them. If they make a move their weapons, hit with Aqua Bind spell...

Siune:
Yes, you got it...hee hee hee, this is our first PvP in ALO...It's kind of thrilling...!

Asuna:
...If you not PKers, then why were you hiding from us?

(Asuna inquired to three players)

Player A:
W-we were waiting for someone! We were hiding because we didn't want to get into a mob before our friends got here. You know how it is...?

Asuna:
...Alright, then. We are here to take on the boss, so if you're not readied enter yet, we bout to take a crack at first.

Player A:
N-no. That's cool.

(Asuna's party passed through the other's)

Player A:
We'll just hung here. You know, to the buddy show up, oh, and a, watch your backs in there...Good luck!

Player B:
Oss sér óvíss grœnn lopt!

(Other players disappeared again with their magician's "Concealment" magic)

Jun:
Don't give those dudes to second thought, come on! Let's do this!

Yuuki:
Hmm...

Asuna:
Don't worry. Let's just take to the plan, and have a look inside, OK?

Yuuki:
OK.

Jun:
Instead just scoping out, Let's bust in there, and trash the boss!

Asuna:
If you wanna try, go for it. Just make sure not to use any of your expensive potions and stuff to recover. Siune and I will support you with healing spell, so fight hard. But try not to get too far in the red.

Jun:
Dah! Right on, coach! Ugr!

(Jun was acting funny, and got Asuna's poke in the forehead)

Asuna:
Listen up. If you die, don't respond right away. Just hang out, and study the boss's attack patterns. Then, let's meet back at the Lonbal save point and talk about what we learn. Okay?

Everyone:
Roger that!

(Jun and Tecchi, two tank members pushed to open boss chamber's door. Everyone in Asuna's party entered into the boss room. But, at the same time, some small lizard sneaking in to the chamber with them. Torches at the wall fired up when they all entered the room. At the rear end, there were several fires running through the floor. In the fire, two headed giant with two huge hummers in both hands appeared. The boss battle began)

Asuna:
Let's get him!

Everyone:
Right!



(ALO, town park. First, Nori, and her team member's came out from portal gate)

Nori:
Geez! We got a boss, kid![?] What kind of attack was that!? That goes against the rules!

Tecchi:
A boss had those hard defensive shell, he got some random move, use his arms to block...

Yuuki:
Hmm...Can we faugt so hard to...Uh!? Hey! What's wrong?

(Asuna grabbed Yuuki's hand, and take her to the corner of the park)

Asuna:
Come here, you guys! Gather around!

Everyone:
Huh...?

Asuna:
I know you're tired but we need to talk.
Remember those three guys, standing by the boss room?

Jun:
Sure. Why?

Asuna:
They were scouts in the guild that specializes in boss raids.

Everyone:
Er...?
What?

Asuna:
If another guild tried to hit the boss room, their job, is just sit back and watch. The bosses you tried to raid on the previous floor, and one before that, I have a feeling they were there, too.

Siune:
I, I had no idea they were even there...

Asuna:
They didn't get running away, or tried to stop us, they're definitely spies. All they want is intel. And wanna small guild like Sleeping Knights comes along to take on the boss, we are helping them figured out all it's attack patterns, and weaknesses.

Talken:
Wa-wait a sec...The door shut behind us when we were inside. And, they definitely didn't follow us. So...if they can't see us fighting the boss, how are they gonna gather an intel on it?

Asuna:
Actually, they could see us fight. Towards in there, I looked over I thought tiny gray lizard near Jun's feet. That's why I realized I let my guard down too soon. It's a dark spell called Peeping. It binds a familiar to a player, and the caster sees what it sees.

Yuuki:
So, what you're saying is...After we got hammered by the bosses on floors twenty-five and six, that other guild sweeping in the beating them, that wasn't in a coincidence!?

Asuna:
Now, I'm afraid it wasn't. You probably fought so hard to the boss, used every moves against you, and they saw it all. That's how they defeat the boss so quickly.

Siune:
They used us again...! Now they know all about this boss too...They probably in there and take it down...!

Jun:
Those dicks!

Talken:
Damn it!

Asuna:
Easy, guys. Don't count us out just yet.

Yuuki:
But...what can we do about it now?

Asuna:
Simple, it's 2:30 pm in the real world. At this time of day on such short notice, It'll be hard to find enough people for the raid party. By my estimate...it should take them at least an hour. That's plenty of time for us. So, here's the deal. After this, if we can get back to the room in thirty minutes, we can take it. Okay?

Yuuki:
Yeah!




Jun:
Last one this is a rotten egg! Hee hee hee!

Yuuki:
Hey, wait for us!

Jun:
Slow pork!

Asuna:
...Crap! We are too late!

(In the front of the gate of boss chamber, there were few dozen people gathered)

Yuuki:
Hmm-m...

Asuna:
Don't worry. They've only advanced twenty players, we should have enough time to get one more try before the rest show up.

Yuuki:
You think!?

Asuna:
...Excuse me?

Man A:
Hm?

Asuna:
We would like to try the boss before you do. Could you guys let us fight?

Man A:
...Sorry, doll-face. The boss room's off limits for now.

Asuna:
...Wait, off limits? What's that supposed to mean?

Man A:
It means, in a couple of minutes the rest of the guild gonna role up here. We just holding the room until they do. If you want, you can wait over there.

Asuna:
And, how long do you expect to wait?

Man A:
Urmm...Another hour or so...?

Asuna:
...But, we don't have that kind of time! If you are going in it right now, well, that's a different story, but you're not! So, let US going first.

Man A:
...Look, I don't make the rules. I'm just a grunt here, following orders like everyone else, okay? If you gotta complain, go to the guild head quarters to talk them. It's over Ig city, so you---

Asuna:
Are you kidding!? That's faraway! It'll take us at least an hour to get there!

Yuuki:
Hey, big guy.

Man A:
Hmm?

Yuuki:
Just try and figure things out here. So, no matter how nice we ask, you're not gonna let us to get by you, is that what you're saying?

Man A:
...Yeah, that's it. That's pretty much what I'm saying.

Yuuki:
Okay...if that what you're saying...you wanna fight?

Man A:
Huh!?

Asuna:
Huh? ...But, Yuuki, are you sure?

Yuuki:
Asuna, sometime, you gotta fight to get your point across. You know, like, how dead serious you are about something...Just saying!

Jun:
Yup! That's pretty much how it is!

Asuna:
You guys...

Yuuki:
These folks no exactly what I'm talking about. They look like the serious types. You could chop away all day, and defend this room to the last player...right, big guy?

Man A:
Urm...W-we got orders that...

(Yuuki drew her sword)

Yuuki:
...Come on. Draw your sword.

(The big tank type guy drew his sword, readied to fight with Yuuki. Yuuki started to thrust the big guy, she slashed the guy several times, instantly made the man's HP reduced to red zone)

Man A:
You are punk...! I'm gonna make you pay for that!

(The big guy's comrades, there are around two dozen players, drew their weapon. Asuna reminisced what Yuuki just said)

Yuuki:
Sometime, you gotta fight to get your point across.

Asuna:
Yeah...She's right.

(Asuna was recalling her recent agony with her mother, and determined something. She unarmed her rod, instead, she brought out her rapier from her stock)

Asuna:
Hm.

Yuuki:
Fu fu...

Nori:
Hey, guys!

(The other dozen of players of the big guy's side were coming from the dungeon)

Asuna:
Ugg...I should've done with this when I have the chance...!

Yuuki:
Sorry, Asuna...my big mouth got into this mess. I was totally worth it! Know why? Because just now, I saw the best smile that I've ever seen on you!

Asuna:
In that case, I'll start pulling my weight. We might not take down on this boss, but the next one, I promise, that ones ours!

Man B:
Ha! Some folks still don't know when they are quit!

(Some boy wearing black clothes leapt from the back end of the arriving players, to the front of them. It was Kirito)

Kirito:
Sorry, guys.

(Asuna turned around to see the guy when she heard the voice. The boy, Kirito, stuck his sword to the ground, and said to the players appeared from the dungeon)

Kirito:
Stand down. You'll not get passed me.

(With Yui on his shoulder, Kirito wore provocative smile)

[End of the episode]
