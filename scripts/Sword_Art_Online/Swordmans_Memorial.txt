  (ALO, the labyrinth of 27th floor boss, front hall of the boss chamber)

Nori:
Hey, guys!

Asuna:
We might not take down this boss...But the next one, I promise, that one's us!

Kirito:
Sorry, guys...Stand down, You'll not get passed me.

Asuna:
Kirito!

Man in red armor:
You sure you wanna do this, buddy? It's a bad idea. I doubt even you can take out whole this big solo.

Kirito:
Yeah, maybe. There's only way to find out for sure.

Man in red armor:
It's your funeral. Okay, people. You are the man. Mages! Let him have it!

(Man in red armor snapped his finger. Three mages at the rear end of party started to chant)

Asuna:
Watch out! Kirito! ...uh!

(Asuna looked back to Yuuki and her opponents. They were also about to begin fighting any time. The mages red armored man's side finished chanting. Magic spear, Lightning bolts, and magic arrows assailed Kirito)



(Kirito pulled off his sword from the ground, rolled it several times, and placed it on his shoulder. He was activating sword skill)

Kirito:
Hmph.

(The magic projectiles were all cut down by his sword. Everyone saw it were dumbfounded)

Yuuki:
No way...

Talken:
He cut those spells...!

Tecchi:
Ug...That's impossible!

Man A:
Er...I don't know I could do stuff like that...?

Man B:
Now, you know...

Man in red armor:
...How did you do that?

Kirito:
Easy. Compare to the bullet from high-powered rifle, knocking down high-speed spells is nothing.

Man in red armor:
Oh, crap! B-battle formation! On the double!

(Half dozen of heavy armored players built a wall of shields at front of the opponent party. Mages at the rear end of the party started again chanting another magic)

Kirito:
I can only hold on for a couple! Head to the boss room! Hurry!

Asuna:
Nn.

(Asuna nodded. Kirito materialized another sword, the "Excalibur," from his item stock. He took it on his left hand. Now his two hands both occupied by two one-handed sword)

Man in red armor:
Oh yeah...Hold your clown! There's only one of him!

Klein:
No even! I'm here too! Dumb steamy yeah!

Kirito:
You're late! What the hell took you so long!

(While busily slashing rear end magicians, Klein replied to Kirito)

Klein:
Sorry man! Took a wrong turn!

Asuna:
Klein's here, too...?

(Asuna looked at Kirito's shoulder, there was Yui, giving Asuna "Go" sign)

Asuna:
Thank you, Yui...You too, Klein...And, Kirito...I love you...
My friends take cares those players. But if we want get into the boss room today, we'll have to get through the ones blocking ourselves.

Yuuki:
Gotya!

Asuna:
Ready!?

Yuuki:
Yup!

(Yuuki and other fighters of the Sleeping Knights dashed to the big guy's side opponents. Jun and Tecchi hit hard, and knocked back one of the opponent members. Talken trust his long spear, pierced male, and female Imp magicians. Nori was rolling in the air, struck down her hammer to the Sylph fighter's back. And Yuuki, she rhythmically stepped and dodged all attacks from the opponent players, and cut down them all. But as soon as they gave damages to the opponent players, Healers of opponent team recovered their HP)

Yuuki:
Heyy! Not fair!

Asuna:
Mm...! Think you can heal them on your own for a bit?

Siune:
Sure. I should have enough mana for that!

Asuna:
Great! Then I'm gonna take care of those enemy mages!

(She jumped backward to take a runway, and began sprint. While running with incredible speed, she also activated her sword skill)

Asuna:
Yuuki! Watch out!

Yuuki:
Huh?

(Asuna run so fast, she generated a sonic-boom. The big guy embroiled in that storm, lost his all HP, and turned himself into a spirit flame. Asuna stopped just in front of the opponent mages)

Mage:
Uh...It's the "Berserk Healer!"

Asuna:
Wraaar!

(Asuna activated another sword skill, slashed down all of the mages. After a short while, there are dozens of spirit frames lingered in the front of the boss chamber. And all members of Asuna's party remained alive)

Asuna:
...Alright, guys. The hard part's next. Come on. Let's get that boss!

Everyone:
Right!

(Jun and Tecchi opened the doors of the boss chamber. All party members entered into the room. Torches in the room automatically lit. Siune touched a panel, then the doors began closing. Asuna turned back to see Kirito, he was surrounded by blazing flame. Kirito tuned into Asuna, too, leveled his right arm and show a sign to Asuna with sticking two, indicate and middle finger out, meaning V for victory. He swallowed by huge flame, and the doors of the boss room closed)

Asuna:
...Yeah. We will beat him.

(More torches lit up as doors closed)

Asuna:
Okay, drink your portions, guys. Max at your HP and MP. Stick to the plan and we'll have a shot. We know at the start, its attack patterns are simple. Stay calm, and avoid them. ...Hm?

(Asuna noticed everyone of the party had faces with some concern)

Yuuki:
Um...Asuna...Those guys...Those friends of yours. Are they here just to help us...?

Asuna:
...Yes. They know it's important to you. So, let's pull this raid off, and make it worth for their effort.

Yuuki:
Yeah, but...I mean...We can't let you do all this and not give anything in return...

(Asuna put her left hand to Yuuki's right shoulder)

Asuna:
But, you have. You told me something I always going to remember. "Sometimes you have to fight to get point across." Right?

Yuuki:
Uh...

(Everyone smiled, and nod. At that time, on the rear end of the boss chamber, fires run on the ground and formed a frame circle. The boss is appearing)

Asuna:
Mm...Well, this is our last chance of this. Time's running out. It won't be long that guild regroups and comes charging through that door. Let's do our best to win...so we can flash them our victory signs when they do. Hey, Yuuki...When this battle's over, I want you to tell me all about yourself. I wanna know about all the worlds you've been too. And, all the adventures you've had.

(Asuna dematerialized her rapier. Instead, she had magic wand in her right hand. At the rear end of the room, on the flame, boss materialized his body and animated it)

Two headed giant:
Gnarraaawww....

(The boss was two headed, four armed giant. It had two gigantic sized hammers, in both sides of arms, and had thick chain in his rest two arms. While the monster roaring, Yuuki had slapped her left cheek by herself, to psyche up)

Yuuki:
Here comes the boss, guys! Let's mess him up!

Everyone:
Right!

(The second round of the battle with 27th floor boss began. The boss struck down his hammer to the ground, generated a shock wave. Tecchi in the most front line in the battle held his large shield, absorbed its damage. Shortly after, Yuuki and Nori jumped over Tecchi, slashed monster's struck downed right arm several times. The boss monster started to follow after Yuuki, then Asuna released her attacking magic, hit and blasted on boss's heads. The boss's four eyes glowed in red, its two mouths grinned, as if he found some enjoyable new toys. The boss swung its thick chain, it hit hard on the ground, and made shock wave in large area. All party members in front line's HP bar instantly reduced to yellow. Asuna and Siune immediately stated chanting their healing magic)

Asuna, Siune:
Þeír fylla...

(Party member's HP were recovered. Yuuki ran to the boss again. Asuna and Siune consumed one bottles of their magic portions)

Asuna:
Only three left...
You guys! We are almost there! Don't let them butt in!

Yuuki:
Right!

(Yuuki and Talken dashed to the boss monster. The boss monster swung his chain to them. Yuuki could dodge it, but Talken couldn't completely dodge, made his long spear fly. The flew spear accidentally hit boss's chest. The boss winced, and curled its four arms to protect itself. Asuna noticed something. She recalled that Tecchi talked right after the first battle of the boss)

Tecchi:
The boss, you know how to defend itself...You think it's a random move? Using his arms to block?

Asuna:
Siune! I have an idea and need your help! Can you take over healing for thirty seconds?

Siune:
Yes! That shouldn't be a problem! I have an preserve to cover everyone!

Asuna:
Ek skýt fjórir ískaldur ör...!

(Asuna chanted "Ice Arrows" magic spell, carefully aimed boss's hexagonal object that attached at its chest, and she released the magic. Ice arrows hit the object. Instantly after that, the boss growled to express its pain, and protected itself with its four arms)

Asuna:
I knew it! That wasn't random...It's protecting a critical weak spot with that move. You see that jewel on its chest? That's where we need to focus our attack!

Siune:
So, we just shatter the jewel, and we can defeat it?

Asuna:
At the very least, we'll put it dent in its HP. Thing is, it's too high up to reach and we can't fly in this dungeon.

Siune:
Then, more just use a sword skill, and keep an eye up for counter moves.

Asuna:
Sounds good. I go up front to tell them the plan...Here's for the little longer, okay?

Siune:
Don't worry, I'm on it.

(Asuna dashed to front fighters)

Asuna:
Yuuki!

Yuuki:
Asuna? What's going on?

Asuna:
Guess what? I found a weak spot on the boss. You see that jewel on its chest, below the necks? If you hit that, you'll do some major damage.

Yuuki:
You sure?

(The boss monster threw the chain to Asuna and Yuuki, they dodged it. Jun slashed the boss to get its aggro on him)

Yuuki:
It's high...I can't reach it even if I jump!

(While Yuuki and Asuna talking, Tecchi was busy to hold the enemy's attack)

Asuna:
...You could if you have the right spring for those.

Yuuki:
Huh? ...Ah, yee-hee-hee.

(Yuuki grinned when she saw Tecchi's back)

Asuna:
Tecchi! When it swing that hammer again, take in knee!

Tecchi:
Er...? ...Um.

(Perhaps he didn't fully get the idea, however, he nodded)

Asuna:
It's our chance to win. Good luck, Yuuki!

Yuuki:
Leave it to me, sis!

Asuna:
Eh...sis?

Two headed giant:
Gooarrr...

(The boss monster hammered down its weapon. Yuuki start to dash. When Tecchi knelt according to previous talk, Yuuki stomped Tecchi's back to gain leverage her jumping power)

Asuna:
Uaaahhhh!

(While falling from jump, she showered the rain of her trust to the boss monster. All attacks hit to the jewel. In total, eleven trusts hit the boss monster's weak spot. Yuuki broke the jewel which attached to the monster. The monster, two headed giant got ripped vertically from the bottom of giants two heads. The two headed monster turned into countless light shards)

Asuna:
Haa...er?

(After a short while silent, fanfare rung in the room. Asuna confirmed the event was over on her window, and fell down to the ground)

Asuna:
We did it...huh.

Yuuki:
You see that!? Ha ha! ...We did it! We did it. We did it! We beat him, Asuna!

Asuna:
Fu fu...That we did. Oh...I'm so tired...

(Yuuki ran and jumped to hug Asuna, but all other party members was the same to Asuna. All of them didn't have energy, sat down on the ground)

Jun:
We did it...!

Tecchi:
Yeah, but I'm what...?

Asuna, Yuuki:
Ee hee hee...

(The door of the chamber started to open. Behind the door, there are red armored man and his comrade waiting. But they noticed Asuna and others were still alive, meaning the boss defeated by them)

Red armored man:
Agh...Oh my god!

(Asuna, Yuuki, and all other party members form V signs to show off their victory to red armored man)

Red armored man:
Ug...You...you...You gotta be kidding me!

(Man's shout with anger echoed in the boss room)



Everyone:
Yay!

Asuna:
Great job, you guys!

(Asuna and other party members returned to the town through a warp gate. Seven hands high-touched in the air at the same time)

Asuna:
I'm kind of sad it's over.

Siune:
Oh, it's not over yet.

Asuna:
Huh?

Siune:
There's last one thing to do...

Asuna:
Urm...

Siune:
You know, a party.

Asuna:
...Oh, of course. Let's have a bog one. We pull out all of stocks.

Jun:
Sweet! We got enough now the party in style, right?

Tecchi:
Mm hm.

Jun:
Where are we gonna have it? Hey, we should go to some big city and buy a restaurant for the night!

Asuna:
Erm...

Everyone:
What?

Asuna:
Actually...If you guys want to, we can have my place in game...It's small, but cozy.

Yuuki:
Really? ...uh, um...

Asuna:
Y-Yuuki? Is something wrong?

Siune:
Um...Please forgive us, Asuna...We really appreciate your offer to host the party, I-It's just a...

(Yuuki grabbed Siune's arm to stop her talking to Asuna for refraining her offer. But Yuuki couldn't say anything on the spot. Siune stroked Yuuki's head, and continued to talk to Asuna)

Siune:
Oh, never mind, it's nothing. We'd be honored to have a victory party at your home, Asuna.

(Asuna had subtly perplexing expression, but said nothing)

Nori:
That settles it! Guys! We are ahead [???] the Lonbal central market, we got ourselves in shopping to do.

Everyone:
Hell, too fine.
Right on!



(Asuna invited Yuuki and others to her Forest House K4. Snows surrounded the house, A tiny snow man Silica and Leafa made still smiling at the wooden fence of the balcony)

Yuuki:
Wow...! You place is so cool, Asuna! ...Wait, there's already foods drinks out.

Talken:
Wow...

Tecchi:
That's what I'm talking about!

(On the table, there was a message card. A message, "Congratulation on Your Voctory!" was on the card, and mark of two swords and girl's portrait were also written on it)

Asuna:
Hm...

(They began eating. Tecch and Jun munching their meats with bone sticking out. Nori pored wine-like drink to Talken's glass)

Nori:
You're not scared of little alcohol, are ya?

Talken:
No...I-I just wanna pace myself...

Yuuki:
OK, so, the worst of MMO I have played was...Aha, there's one from the U.S. called Insect Site!

Siune:
Aah...That one's bad.

Asuna:
Really? And, why don't you like it?

Yuuki:
Bugs everywhere! If it were just the monsters, no problem. But you gotta player is a bug! I had played as a bipedal ant, so I guess I didn't have a too bad. But, you should've seen her...

Siune:
Ah! No! Please don't say anything!

Yuuki:
She was a giant caterpillar! Spills strings like "qoo!" Ha ha ha...!

Siune:
Umm...

Asuna:
Ha ha...That's awesome. Sounds like you've got to travel to some really cool places together.

Yuuki:
How about you!? I mean, you come up like you've been playing these MMOs forever.

Asuna:
Do I? Well...I play this one a lot. I can tell you how many hours to tough to get the money to buy this cabin.

Yuuki:
Worth it. You know, when you say this place was cozy, you weren't kidding. It's got this really cool old time in vibe.

Siune:
Yes, it does...It's all peaceful I could stay here all day...uh.

(Siune shut her mouth suddenly)

Asuna:
Wh-what's wrong, Siune?

Siune:
I'm so sorry, but I'm just remembered! When we asked you to help, we said we'll give you whatever the boss drop to you in return. it wasn't all money, though, and...we spent a lot of it on food and drink for a party...

Talken:
What have we done...

Everyone:
Umm...

Yuuki:
Crap! Now we don't have anything to give you! Umm...

Asuna:
No, it's OK! ...How about, a favor, instead?

Yuuki:
Favor...?

Asuna:
A-ha. Honestly, I'm little sad the quest is over, I wanna get to know you better, Yuuki. There's so many things I wanna ask you.

(Asuna recalled again Yuuki said to her)

Yuuki:
Asuna, sometimes you got to fight to get point across...

Asuna:
Yuuki, would you let me join in the Sleeping Knights?

(Everyone astonished. Yuuki looked sad)

Yuuki:
Asuna...I wish we could, but...It's like...This is a temporary thing for us...And, like...come spring, we'll splitting up. And after that...I doubt any of us will be diving much any more...

Asuna:
I know, but, can I join until then? I wanna us to be friends. I wanna be friends of all of you! There's still enough time for that, isn't there?

Yuuki:
I...I'm sorry Asuna...You can't. Sorry...

Asuna:
Um...Not at all. It's fine! I shouldn't have put you on the spot like that, Yuuki. I'm sorry.

Siune:
Um...Asuna...I don't...You see way---

Asuna:
No. Really. You don't have to be. Sorry I was so pushy...Anyway, come on! Let's go check it out!

Siune:
What?

Asuna:
The reason we beat the boss, remember? You know, the monument in the Black Iron Palace? I'm sure it's updated by now.

Jun:
Yeah. Guys, let's go! ...Oh, Know we should do? We should take a picture with it!

Talken:
Good idea!

Tecchi:
Best one yet!

(Asuna talked to Yuuki)

Asuna:
Hey, let's go!

(Yuuki kept silent for a while, and smiled up to answer to Asuna)



(the Black Iron Palace. All the party members walked to the monument. Asuna was holding hand with Yuuki, and she led her)

Jun:
There it is!

Nori:
Hey, wait for me!

(They all run to the monument)

Yuuki:
Look...up there.

(On the monument, following to "Floor 27," there were Yuuki, and other five members and Asuna's name inscribed. All except Asuna, there were also the emblems of the Sleeping Knights on the left of their names)

Yuuki:
There we are...We got our names on it...

Jun:
Hey, guys! Let's take the picture!

Asuna:
Come on, Yuuki...

(Asuna and Yuuki turned themselves to the camera Jun preparing to take a picture)

Asuna:
Make smile.

(Jun set self-timer on the camera. He ran to join other members. All they made smiles and formed V-signs. After accelerando pace of several "peep" sound, the camera released its shutter)

Asuna:
There it is...You did it.

Yuuki:
Yeah...I finally did, for sis.

Asuna:
Nn-fu...There you go again, Yuuki.

Yuuki:
What?

Asuna:
You called me "sis" just now. That's what. ...And in the boss room, too.

Yuuki:
Uh...!

Asuna:
It's fine! It makes me happy.

(But, Asuna noticed Yuuki suddenly burst her tears, sobbing with her hands on her mouth)

Asuna:
Wha---what's wrong?

(Yuuki stepped back a couple steps)

Yuuki:
Asuna...I, I...

Asuna:
Yuuki!?

(Yuuki opened her operating window, and logged out from ALO. Asuna stood there without move while Yuuki logging out)
