  At the entrance to the gulf, a Buddha statue, once meant to brighten the world with the light of virtue, now sits decaying. Beyond its faded glory lies Roanapur, the city of immorality. From the overland entrance to the city, there's always a noose left hanging intended for some unknown person. And what awaits past the scenery is the city of pleasure, Roanapur. Until recently I was a businessman in Tokyo, now I'm a crew member on a pirate ship.

I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Arrrgh, bastard! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! [indistinct] Die, bastard! Kill you! Kill you! Arrgh!


Revy, I'm stepping out for a while.

Gotcha. Watch your back.

Huh? You going out?

Yeah, for a bit.

Ugh, poo! What the hell is this?

Revy?

Hmm?

Just saw Dutch. Where's he going?

Who knows. Besides, it's none of our business what Dutch does in his spare time.

You're right. I only asked because I was curious.

Nosey types aren't too popular. ... What the hell is this?! Tasted like it came out of your ass! Whatever you paid for those, you got ripped off!

Guess so. It looks like things don't get any better when you go downtown, either. And this city...

You got to realize international criminals come here to lock horns with each other. They all try to scam one another, from top to bottom. You don't really stand a chance of surviving here if you always believe everything you see. Then again, you're lucky if that's the biggest problem you got.

I'll take it to heart.

She's right. I may still be too soft. After all, I don't know the histories of my crew members. They keep their pass to themselves, their privacy protected by a fierce sense of independence. But I don't care. That's how I feel.


Hello there, it's me. So, how are you doing? ... Yeah, go ahead. International number 10013. Right. Send me 120,000 to the name "Flyer's Company". ... Yeah.

(car horn honking)

Hey, Dutch.

We'll talk later. Fuck me...

Great weather, huh? So how's business going for you guys? Good, I hope.

Can't complain, Mr. Chin. We're getting by.

Well, that's great to hear. Tell me something - how long do you plan to work with that Fry Face bitch, anyway? Maybe you're just not thinking straight, eh?

Do you know, Mr. Chin... No clue what you're talking about.

I'm talking about that crazy Russian. Ever since those damn Ruskie got here, we've been losing money left and right. That Ivan's taking all of our girls, the rights to our hotels, and the heroin routes. They've got no sense of honor. And if we end up losing the sea routes to them too, those greedy bastards are gonna wipe us out completely. Allow me to spell it out for you. What I'm trying to say is, you should pull out, and quickly.

Hey listen. Let me give you some advice.

Hmm?

Even bad guys have common sense. You hear me? When you went and sold that junk to the New People's Army, we were the ones hired to deliver it. It wasn't even close to a "no problem" situation, but why don't remind me who pulled out then?

Why don't you let that go, huh, Dutch? It's behind us, so don't bring up the past like some old bitch.

I'll say what I want, and I'll tell you this much. Balalaika has a hell of a lot more honor than you ever did. If you wanna do business with us, we'll ship your goods at our rate. We're done talking now.

I'm telling you, you won't get any second chances, Dutch!

And neither will you, my friend. Try using your head if you wanna survive. Later.


Hey, Dutch. Why don't you ever come sample the goods here, baby?

I already know what's inside your bottles, ladies. After all, I did ship them here.

Hmm?


That bastard. Is it true that torpedo boat bustles, working for some country bumpkin Ruskie bitch these days?

Yes sir. But I'm hearing that these guys will take on jobs from just about anyone, so long as they have money to spend.

Hm...


I'll be damned if you can find me a city as rotten to the core as this.

(honk honk)

Hmm?

Dutch! Look! The new board's finally arrived! This is the pure, unadulterated, real deal!

You're probably the first guy that ever used the word "pure" in this city.

(laughs)

Then hurry your ass up and get that stuff on the boat, Benny.

Yeah, sure thing!

Man, oh man, our crew can be so damn simple-minded sometimes.

Hey, Dutch.


(snore)

Wake up, sailor! We have a job!

Oh, OK. What, job?

Where the hell is Rock?

I told him to wash up, but he's sure taking his sweet time.

Sorry to keep you waiting.

What is it today?

Just killing men. Passed on from Donnie Yen.

...(bored)

...Who's Donnie Yen?

He gives us jobs from time to time. Today we're receiving a package from the Vietnamese military at Phu Quoc Island. I figured since our schedule was open... Anyway, nothing's better than a hard day's work, right?

What are we supposed to do with all these lame jobs, Dutch? No wonder we can't make Office-Boy here trade these shitty white collar shirts for some real clothes!

I wish you'd stop with that. I told you, this is just my style.

Which reminds me, Rock! What happened to that Hawaiian shirt I got you at the market? You know the one!

The hideously ugly shirt? Wearing that thing should be some form of punishment.

Something you wanna say, Rock? You think I don't have any taste?!

Hey! Stop that!


Yeah, I got it. (dialing) That's right, it looks like they fell for the trap. Whether you wanna see this thing through is up to you at this point. ... Heh heh heh... I know for a fact you've been down on your luck lately. I hear you messed up the last time and got chased around by a battleship. Huh? You take care of this job, and I guarantee you get all the tolls between here and Kalimantan. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. That's the deal. Give that one to some thug, why don't you? (turns off phone) I told you, Dutch. You're not gonna get any second chances with us.


(humming)

Take this... Through here... Then back... Then it should end up... Like this! ...? Hey. That's funny.

Come on! You have got to be the clumsiest person I've ever seen! Or is it that you're just not trying hard?

Sorry...

You're not cut out for this. Watch my hands. A retarded monkey could do it.

I guess... But don't be so hard on me. I never did stuff like this at work.

Well, Rock. What kind of stuff did you do at work?

I was in the materials procurement department. I took trips, I wrote reports... made calls, but I think bowing my head to my superiors was my real job. At night I had to accompany my boss when he'd go out for drinks. I even got my ass kicked once when he was really drunk.

That's really great, Rock. What a disgusting story. How could you put up with all that shit? Huh, what are you, some kind of masochist or something?

Putting up with it is part of the job. I mean, no one wants to end up on the streets. Plus, that's just how people survive.

Pfft. Pathetic.

Revy, what did you do before you ended up here?

What I do now is pretty much what I've always done.

Really? Then let me guess - as a kid, you spent your days on the river near home, swinging a cutlass around.

That's the truth. I stole, I killed... I did everything... that you'd consider bad. ... And it ain't no sick joke.


Dutch, I've got several boats approaching.

Huh?


Start prayin', 'coz you're gonna need directions for how to get to heaven, Dutch. Heh heh heh...


BLACK
LAGOON


It doesn't make sense for there to be any merchants around. This is known as Pirate's Bay. Can you find out who they are?

They're small and fast. Could be cops looking to arrest pirates. Dutch, a Red Alert!

(sigh) What the hell is this? They blew right by yellow and gave us the red lamp already.

Their speed is 28 knots.

(sigh)

Hey, Dutch!

Hold on, Benny will explain the situation to you.

Wait a second. Huh?! I just saw three more boats! There's a total of six boats now! The first three started accelerating from the other side of the island we just passed. And these last three on port side came from behind a completely different island. Changing course to port side is dangerous - the ships that side will catch us. But the same problem with starboard.

A basic hunting pattern.

These guys haul ass, too!

Hey, Dutch.

Yeah.

I smell it.

So? Who are they?

I know that stench even from this distance. These guys definitely aren't marine cops, that's for sure. There's no doubt in my mind. They stink too much of blood and smoke for that.

Pirates? We're actually being targeted by pirates?! Dutch, what's the background of our client?

Rock. That observation really hurts. I haven't been conducting background checks on Donnie Yen's economic situation from the beginning.

Hello! Hello! Can you hear me, Lagoon?! That's right, it's me. Dutch, it's been a while.

Now I see. It's Luak. Sorry, but there's no prey here. You should go home before you get lost.

There's prey right here, Dutch. A rowdy old torpedo boat.

Six vessels in pursuit. If it is Luak, he's brought everything he's got.

Damn, all these stupid bastards...

Chin got you involved in this, didn't he, Luak? God must pity you for your stupidity.

Ha! Once we gun a pint of lead in you, maybe it'll put an end to all that pitiable talk of yours.

The enemy's got us on both sides. But in these positions, I think they're...

I see there, Rock. I suggest you get inside.

Ahhhh!

Nice job.

If you wanna flank the enemy, it's common sense to style your positions to avoid friendly fire. Amateurs!

Urgh! Bastards! Don't get too confident. I'll send you straight to Hell!

Still four vessels remaining. Dutch, they're coming.

Revy. It's your turn. Give 'em a taste of Two-Hands.

Leave it to me.

It's show time. Can you make them dance?

You know I can.

Revy, what are you planning to do?

Listen, why don't you take a break from all that casual conversation about your world? Because right now, I need to focus on this world. (starts music)

Benny-Boy. We've got two closing port side, and another two starboard to stern. [xxx], right?

And one more - directly behind us.

Do that one last, Revy.

All right. I'll start with the shit on the left. ... Let's dance the jitterbug, baby!

How did she...?

She's on the next boat!

Do something about that bitch!

Damn, I can't see with all the smoke!

Make sure you never hit-

Argh!

Dammit!

Kill that bitch! Finish her off! Argh!

[Shit, waaahh]!

So, Rock. Which boat is she on?

She's working on her fifth now. Hold on! Looks like the third is still alive.

There she is, right there! Shoot her! Kill her!!

Damn it. My fleet! She took out all of my boats!

You just hit a dead end. Seems like you were the one destined to dance the cha-cha with some hot lead, Luak.

Damn it! How dare you! That bitch isn't even human! [xxx] kiss my ass! I'm not dealing with those demons anymore!

She defeated them all single-handedly. Incredible. Even though I was saying the words, a completely different thought had crossed my mind. I can't even imagine how her life was shattered to make who she is today, but I must be pretty broken myself to sit here in awe, praising her for her powers of destruction.


Damn it! Luak, you useless bastard! You screwed me! That idiot. What kind of mother raises such a useless piece of shit? He puts my balls in a vise and then - oh, how convenient! - he goes and dies! This is a fuckin' disaster! I'd like a chance to kill him myself all over again. Unh!

Well, well, well. Moving out so suddenly? That's such hard work. Perhaps we could help you, Mr. Chin.

...Uh... n-never-never mind... There must be some kind of misunderstanding here... I don't what kind of pathetic rumors floating around town. If we sit down over lunch, we'll see there's a perfectly good explanation. It's plain to see... Nuh! Ugh...

Listen carefully, you piece of horse-shit. We didn't come here so you could tell us a story. We already know everything we want to.

(whimper)

Pray. That's about the only thing you can still do while you're alive.


Ah, this sucks. We busted our asses for nothing. What a waste.

That's not so bad. Kinda like being bitten by a dog.

(phone rings)

You dumbass, I'm serious. Bullets aren't free, y'know.

Hello, Lagoon Company.

Oh, Japonski! It's been a while. Is Dutch around by any chance?

Who is it?

Ms. Balalaika.

Hi there, Dutch! I heard you went on a wild goose chase. And you got stuck playing games with Mr. Chin.

Who told you about that?

He told me himself. Let's just say he's a bit too loud to organize any kind of conspiracy. He was blabbing away to just about everyone in town. Even the dead would've known what was happening. Anyway, we'll make sure nothing like this happens again. It was a real pain for you, wasn't it?

No, I wouldn't say that. It wasn't even enough to give me a headache.

Thanks, Dutch. I realize it's hardly enough after what you went through, but I'll let you hear something amusing. They call this "Pleasure and Pain".

Oh. Is it cooler than J.B.?

Of course. (bleep)

(explosion)

Yeah, that sounded cool.

We'll have a job for you soon. I'll call you then.

Was that a call about a job?

Something like that. She filled me in on some gossip to cheer me up. Revy, Rock, do you guys have any plans?

Not really.

You, Benny?

Got maintenance work on the electronics. But nothing I can't wait today.

Alright then. Considering the mental anguish incurred due to external interference, as your employer, I should provide entertainment as compensation. And, after careful consideration, I'd like to propose a trip to the Yellow Flag tonight to drink away our pain. This one's on me, of course. So who's coming?

You serious!? Can we stay there till dawn?!

I'm in!

Uhh, me too!

Then it's decided! Benny, get the car! Rock, you are not on the job anymore! You should wear that Hawaiian shirt I got you.

I don't want to.


<Preview>
Despite that, there are still some fights that you must take on. Let's go. Prepare the torpedos for surface attack.
