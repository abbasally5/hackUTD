She said she would go get the medicine for my feathers.[Nemu]
[Reki]
Um... I went to go buy some food. I thought maybe you might be getting hungry.[Nemu]
Let's cook together. Sorry about before.[Kuramori]
[Reki]
[Kuramori]
[Reki]
Really?[Nemu]
[Reki]

Go ahead.[Reki]
How could you leave her alone like that?! You knew that if she touched the wall, she would develop a fever![Communicator]
[Reki]
[Communicator]
[Reki]
[Communicator]
[Reki]
So it's true. She really did it.[Communicator]
[Reki]
[Communicator]

It's bitter.[Reki]
[Rakka]
Thanks, Reki.[Hikari]
I hope you get well soon.[Kids]
You wet the bed! You wet the bed![Kana]
[Reki]
[Kana]
What'll we do?[Reki]
[Rakka]
Reki.[Kana], [Reki]
Hmm?[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Nemu]
It's okay.[Reki]
Take care.[Kana]
Reki.[Communicator]
Descend.[Rakka]
Huh?[Communicator]
Put this on.[Rakka]
Huh?[Communicator]
[Rakka]
Does this mean... I'm gonna be put in prison?[Communicator]
Prison?[Rakka]
[Communicator]
Inside the wall.[Rakka]
The wall?[Communicator]
Look over here.[Rakka]
Huh?[Communicator]
[Rakka]
You mean... by myself?![Communicator]
Are you frightened?[Rakka]

[Hyohko]
[Midori]
[Hyohko]
Right.[Midori]
[Hyohko]
What?! When did I...?![Midori]
There's a girl in your place with funny hair that sticks up, right?[Reki]
You mean Rakka?[Midori]
Hyohko wants to give her this.[Reki]
Hmm, what is it?[Midori]
[Reki]
[Midori]
[Hyohko]
Don't order me around![Reki]
You jerk![Rakka]
What are you doing?[Reki]
[Rakka]
Hmm?[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Hikari]
Wow![Nemu]
[Kana]
[Hikari]
We should really give them something in return.[Kana]
[Hikari]
But we still should.[Nemu]
What do you think, Reki?[Reki]
I really have no idea what we should do.[Nemu]
[Rakka]
What do you mean?[Nemu]
[Rakka]
Oh, I see.[Reki]
If it's Abandoned Factory, then I...[Nemu]
I know. Someone else will host the visit.[Hikari]
Oh, I wanna go![Nemu]
But I have to warn you, the boys in the factory can be pretty rowdy.[Kana]
No kidding.[Rakka]
I would like to go.[Hikari]
Well then, I'll make some treats![Nemu]
Is that okay?[Reki]
It's up to you.[Hikari]
Good night![Kana]
'Night![Nemu, Reki]
Good night![Reki]
Nemu...[Nemu]
Yeah?[Reki]
[Nemu]
[Reki]
I'm saying I don't want to be a burden to you anymore.[Nemu]
