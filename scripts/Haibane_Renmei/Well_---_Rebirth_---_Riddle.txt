Rakka![Nemu]
Rakka![Kana]
Hey![Reki]
Found her?[Hikari]
I hope this storm's not going to get any worse.[Reki]
[Rakka]
Who are you?[Kuu]
"I just wish we could talk with the crows."[Kana]
"The Haibane believe that they carry our lost items."[Sumika]
"What did it feel like when you were being born?"[Rakka]
[Communicator]
[Rakka]
Yes.[Communicator]
[Rakka]
I'm all right![Communicator]
[Rakka]
[Communicator]
[Rakka]
I saw that there was a dead bird at the bottom of the well.[Communicator]
And that is what you risked your life for?[Rakka]

[Communicator]
[Rakka]
No...[Communicator]
[Rakka]
[Communicator]
Why do you feel so much grief for someone you cannot even remember?[Rakka]
I don't know! But I know I hurt them.[Communicator]
[Rakka]
[Communicator]
[Rakka]
But you don't understand--my feathers are...[Communicator]
[Rakka]
[Communicator]
[Rakka]
[Communicator]
To recognize one's own sin is to have no sin.[Rakka]
Huh?[Communicator]
[Rakka]
[Communicator]
Then do you recognize your own sin?[Rakka]
If I do, does that mean my sin will be erased?[Communicator]
[Rakka]
Uh! But if I think I have no sin, then I become a sinner![Communicator]
[Rakka]
What's the right answer then?[Communicator]
[Rakka]
Ah...[Communicator]
[Rakka]
Can I see you again?[Communicator]
It will be necessary for you to return the cane.[Rakka]
Thank you for everything.[Reki]
Rakka![Rakka]
Reki?[Reki]
Rakka, you're okay.[Rakka]
[Reki]
You're covered in mud. Where are your shoes? What happened?[Rakka]
I fell into the well in the Western Woods.[Reki]
Huh?[Kana]
Hey! Don't run off by yourself like that![Hikari]
You found her?![Reki]
Over here![Rakka]
Hi! Over here! Hey![Reki]
That cane...[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
Umm[Reki]
While you're out there, did you touch the wall?[Rakka]
[Kana]
What's wrong? You look so pale.[Reki]
[Kana]
Hey, wait![Reki]
She said she touched the wall.[Kana]
What?[Reki]
Rakka, get on.[Hikari]
[Nemu]
Hikari, we all have to hurry back now.[Rakka]
My body feels like it's getting lighter.[Reki]
Try not to talk and get some sleep.[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
The bird?[Rakka]
While I was in the well, the dream I couldn't remember from when I was in the cocoon came back to me.[Reki]
[Hikari]
Will she be alright?[Nemu]
Is she asleep?[Reki]
Kana. Sorry, but could you go to town and get some fever medicine?[Kana]
What?! Why didn't you ask me when we were out?[Reki]
Come on. I'll even Iet you take my scooter.[Kana]
Fine. But is the store even open now?[Reki]
Make them open it for you. And don't say anything about the walls.[Kana]
Yeah, I know. Keys?[Reki]
Oh, I left them in the ignition.[Kana]
Why do you always have to do that?[Hikari]
Reki, I don't think she has a fever. In fact she feels cold.[Reki]
The fever won't start until after midnight.[Hikari]
Reki, how do you know so much?![Nemu]
Uh, Reki, have you let the Housemother know that you found her yet?[Reki]
Oh, no I haven't.[Nemu]
Hikari, we have to go tell the Housemother check on the kids.[Reki]
Thanks a lot for the help.[Nemu]
I'm always good at putting them to sleep.[Reki]
Better not fall asleep before they do.[Rakka]
Mmm... huh?[Reki]
Sorry, did that hurt?[Rakka]
No. I almost feel like my body isn't here.[Reki]
Well. Just looking at you hurts.[Rakka]
It's like the night when my wings came out.[Reki]
Yeah, I guess so.[Rakka]
You know Reki, you're always taking care of me.[Reki]
I'm a busybody. It's just in my nature.[Rakka]
Your hands, they're so warm.[Reki]
That's because your hands are so cold. They're just like ice.[Rakka]
Reki, I feel like my body is getting lighter. Tell me. Am I still here?[Reki]
Don't worry, you're still here.[Rakka]
Reki, I don't wanna go.[Reki]
You not going anywhere. Don't worry about it.[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
Reki, you've always been helping me.[Reki]
You're free. And now I'm alone.[Nemu]
How is she?[Reki]
[Nemu]
Is it something medicine can cure?[Reki]
[Hikari]
[Reki]
[Hikari]
Of course.[Reki]
