Rakka, are you up?[Rakka]
Yes.[Kana]
We're all going into Kuu's room.[Rakka]
O...kay. I'm coming.[Hikari]
Do you like the wing covers?[Rakka]
Mm-hm.[Hikari]
I'm so glad![Nemu]
Every one of us will take one of Kuu's belongings to remember her by.[Reki]
Rakka, how about the bed? Do you want anything else?[Rakka]
Just those.[Reki]
[Rakka]
Do I have to keep using the medicine? And keep hiding my wings forever?[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Kids]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
Your dream of falling from the sky?[Rakka]
[Reki]
Hey, don't get so far ahead![Kids]
Reki! Come on![Reki]
[Old-Clothes Dealer]
Everybody, fall in![Kids]
[Old-Clothes Dealer]
[Reki]
Oh, great.[Old-Clothes Dealer]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
Mmm.[Old-Clothes Dealer]
Send them in after they take off their coats.[Reki]
Okay.[Kid]
Yeahhh![Reki]
Hey! I told you to take your coat off first![Old-Clothes Dealer]
Come on! Not all at once![Reki]
Sorry about that.[Old-Clothes Dealer]
[Reki]
[Old-Clothes Dealer]
[Rakka]
Huh?[Old-Clothes Dealer]
Bet you're surprised at how early winter comes around here, right?[Rakka]
This one.[Old-Clothes Dealer]
[Rakka]
Um, but I...[Old-Clothes Dealer]
[Rakka]
Well, but...[Old-Clothes Dealer]
[Rakka]
But why?[Old-Clothes Dealer]
[Rakka]
Blessings? But I'm not...[Old-Clothes Dealer]
[Rakka]
Oh, no. My notebook, there's only one sheet left inside.[Old-Clothes Dealer]
[Rakka]
No, they won't. I'm just... a big failure as a Charcoal Feather.[Old-Clothes Dealer]
Huh?[Man]
Hello.[Old-Clothes Dealer]
Uh, hi, there. Let's see.[Man]
Do you have this in a different size?[Old-Clothes Dealer]
Oh, that only comes in one size.[Woman]
[Man]
Leave her alone. You're bothering her.[Woman]
No, I'm not bothering her. Right?[Rakka]
Don't touch me![Woman]
Huh?[Old-Clothes Dealer]
Hey![Gentleman]
That was a big fall you took, young miss.[Rakka]
[Gentleman]
Here, I think you dropped this.[Rakka]
[Reki]
Where's Rakka?! Did she come back?[Hikari]
I wonder what happened to her.[Kana]
Hey, do you think that maybe she...?[Reki]
It's different from Kuu's time! Rakka hasn't...[Nemu]
Weren't you the last one with her, Reki?[Reki]
Sorry about that. I guess I messed up.[Kana]
[Nemu]
[Kana]
Alright then. Let's go![Nemu]
[Reki]
You're right. This situation is similar. But she's not as stupid as...[Nemu]
[Reki]
It's okay. Let's go![Rakka]
