[Sumika]
[Nemu]
Your shoes.[Sumika]
Oh.[Nemu]
[Sumika]
Damn, you sound just like my mother.[Nemu]
So, how much longer can you work?[Sumika]
Just till the end of the month[Nemu]
[Sumika]
[Nemu]
[Sumika]
[Nemu]
Downstairs I think.[Sumika]
Ah, I guess I'll take care of the hard part first.[Rakka]
Ah... Huh?[Sumika]
[Rakka]
[Sumika]
[Rakka]
No, it's okay. I'll be fine.[Sumika]
[Rakka]
Thank you.[Sumika]
[Rakka]
Uh...[Sumika]
[Rakka]
[Sumika]
Really?[Rakka]
Oh, thank you very much.[Sumika]
Not at all, thank you for the advice.[Rakka]
Huh?[Sumika]
On how a parent should frame her mind.[Nemu]
Did you bring them up all by yourself?[Rakka]
A nice lady named Sumika was helping me.[Nemu]
[Rakka]
Huh?[Nemu]
[Rakka]
[Nemu]
And they're very old, so you should be careful.[Rakka]
Uh.[Nemu]
[Rakka]
Uh-huh.[Sumika]
Nemu? Huh?[Rakka]
[Sumika]
[Rakka]
[Sumika]
[Rakka]
[Sumika]
No, not at all.[Rakka]
Oh, I guess that's to be expected.[Sumika]
I guess I could tell you, I once thought about going out beyond the walls.[Rakka]
Eh?[Sumika]
I wanted to find the beginning of the world.[Rakka]
The beginning of the world?[Sumika]
[Rakka][Sumika]
Hehehe.[Sumika]
[Rakka]
Ah![Rakka][Sumika]
Oh, no![Nemu]
Sumika is really something else.[Rakka]
I'm sorry.[Nemu]]
[Sumika]
[Nemu]
[Kids]
Yay![Nemu]
Stop it. It's embarrassing.[Reki]
Now, did you say "thank you" to the Storybook Lady?[Kids]
Thank you![Reki]
[Nemu]
I know. We've put a lot of effort into changing this place.[Reki]
[Hikari]
[Kuu]
[Reki]
Thanks. See ya![Rakka][Nemu]
Hm.[Nemu]
[Rakka]
But you seemed like you were having a good time with them.[Nemu]
[Rakka]
[Nemu]
[Rakka]
Huh?[Nemu]
[Rakka]
[Nemu]
It's a secret.[Rakka]
I can help if you tell me what it is.[Nemu]
[Rakka]
Huh?[Nemu]
[Rakka]
And then?[Nemu]
That's the only hint.[Rakka]
[Nemu]
[Rakka]
Hm?[Reki]
Hm?[Haibane of Abandoned Factory]
[Midori]
[Haibane of Abandoned Factory]
[Reki]
What was that for?![Hyohko]
[Reki]
[Hyohko]
Ah![Reki]
Jerk.[Haibane of Abandoned Factory]
[Nemu]
Come on, let's leave now before we get caught.[Rakka]
Uh, okay.[Nemu]
[Rakka]
[Nemu]
Yes, and one thing led to another with those two.[Rakka]
What kind of things?[Nemu]
[Rakka]
[Nemu]
[Rakka]
Oh...[Nemu]
I don't think having boys around would be too bad, but I don't like the ones in Abandoned Factory, they're so rowdy.[Rakka]
[Nemu]
Ahh...[Rakka]
[Nemu]
Well, sure, I'd love your help, but I won't be leaving till late.[Rakka]
Well, I'll do some research until then.[Nemu]
What are you researching?[Rakka]
The beginning of the world.[Sumika]
So what's she studying so intently?[Nemu]
[Sumika]
[Nemu]
Was I?[Sumika]
In the beginning of the world, there was nothing but a dark mist, called the Nothingness.[Nemu]
[Sumika]
[Nemu]
It's hopeless, this book is too damaged to read.[Sumika]
[Rakka]
Ah.[Nemu]
Oh, you should wake me instead of watching me.[Rakka]
But you looked so happy sleeping like that...[Nemu]
How did your research go?[Rakka]
[Nemu]
And, what's the answer?[Rakka]
Nemu, why should I tell if you just gave me a hint?[Nemu]
[Rakka]
[Nemu]
[Rakka]
Can I read it?[Nemu]
You won't laugh?[Rakka]
I won't.[Rakka]
Oh, is this all?[Nemu]
[Rakka]
Ah! You won't laugh, right?[Nemu]
I promise.[Rakka]
........[Nemu]
Ha ha ha![Rakka]
[Nemu]
You gotta be joking.[Rakka]
[Nemu]
[Rakka]
But it's a book written by you, so I think it should remind the reader of the author, don't you?[Nemu]
[Rakka]
[Kana]
Where's Nemu?[Rakka]
She's got double overtime.[Kana]
Huh?[Rakka]
[Kana]
[Rakka]
I understand.[Kana]
But it's still hard to believe.[Kana]][Rakka]
Hahaha.[Cafe Master]
Here you go.[Kuu]
Thanks a lot.[Cafe Master]
Yeah, see you later.[Kuu]
[Cafe Master]
[Kuu]
[Rakka]
Kuu![Kuu]
Oh, Rakka.[Rakka]
What are you doing?[Kuu]
[Rakka]
Saying good-bye?[Kana]
I said no![Kuu]
Come on, it's okay.[Kana]
No way![Reki]
[Rakka]
She's still in bed.[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
Uhh, it's something private but it's also a very important thing, I guess.[Reki]
[Rakka]
Ah...[Reki]
Rakka.[Rakka]
Ah.[Reki]
[Rakka]
Oh...[Nemu]
[Reki]
Right on time.[Rakka]
I really hope that Sumika will like it.[Nemu]
[Rakka]
What? why?[Nemu]
[Rakka]
Huh?[Nemu]
It's too late for that.[Rakka]
[Nemu]
[Rakka]
Nemu, I'm very happy.[Nemu]
I hope Sumika will be, too.[Rakka]
How can she not be?[Sumika]
When God...something...glowing over his head...[Nemu]
[Rakka]
