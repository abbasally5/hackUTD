[Rakka]
[Kuu]
[Rakka]
[Kuu]
Mmm. It's way too big for me, and winter will be coming soon.[Rakka]
Winter? But it's been so warm until just a few days ago.[Kuu]
[Rakka]
Sure, thanks for the help.[Kuu]
[Rakka]
Ah... you're so full of knowledge, Kuu.[Kuu]
So what's this?[Rakka]
[Kuu]
What?[Rakka]
This is a room for everybody; it's so comfortable in here, that I might grow lazy if I stay any longer.[Kuu]
[Rakka]
Thanks to the help of a good senior.[Kuu]
Found a good room yet?[Rakka]
[Kuu]
I gotta go now.[Rakka]
Huh? But it's almost time for breakfast.[Kuu]
Yeah, but I've got a lot of things to do today.[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
Well, she said she had something to do.[Reki]
Hmm, maybe I should wait to make them for her.[Hikari]
[Reki]
Yeah, I guess you're right.[Hikari][Rakka][Reki]
Huh?[Reki]
Huh?[Nemu]
Huh?[Kana]
Hey, you guys! I did it![Hikari]
That's great![Rakka]
She really did fix it.[Reki]
I guess now someone here can wake up on time.[Nemu]
(Grumbles.)[Rakka]
We have to celebrate![Hikari]
Good idea![Kana]
Yahoo![Reki]
[Kana]
[Nemu][Rakka][Reki][Hikari]
(They all sigh.)[Kana]
[Rakka]
Um, well, it's... We're just wondering how long it's going to keep ringing.[Kana]
Huh? Oh, well, the ringing will stop if I kill the breaker, but then the clock would die as well.[Hikari]
What? Then it's useless.[Reki]
You idiot! Go kill it now![Kana]
[Reki]
We'll never sleep![Kana]
[Reki]
She just had to do this on a Sunday.[Nemu]
I'm tired.[Rakka]
[Kana]
Wait a sec.[Rakka]
It stopped.[Kana]
Oh well, that's it.[Rakka]
Sorry about this.[Kana]
[Rakka]
(Giggles.)[Kana]
[Rakka]
Oh, Mm-hm.[Kana]
If she gave it to you, then she finally gave up, I guess.[Rakka]
What do you mean?[Kana]
[Rakka]
Is it okay? Should I keep it?[Kana]
She no longer has to pretend to be what she isn't anymore.[Rakka]
Huh?[Kana]
Kuu used to wanna copy everything that we did.[Rakka]
Really?[Kana]
[Rakka]
[Kuu]
That's because... this is the room where you were born.[Rakka]
I was born... in here?[Kuu]
[Rakka]
[Kuu]
[Rakka]
[Kuu]
[Rakka]
[Kuu]
You know, Reki was very mad.[Rakka][Kuu]
Hahahaha.[Kuu]
[Rakka]
Kuu...[Kuu]
[Rakka]
(Gasps.)[Reki]
It's getting stormy.[Rakka]
(Gasps.)[Reki]
Hmm, seems like we're gonna have some rain, too bad it's on a Sunday.[Rakka]
Yes.[Reki]
[Rakka]
Reki... did she say anything else?[Reki]
[Rakka]
No.[Reki]
No? Who was it then?[Rakka]
Kuu.[Reki]
[Rakka]
(Gasps.) Reki![Reki]
What's wrong?[Rakka]
Uhm, it's nothing.[Reki]
[Rakka]
I'm not sure...[Reki]
You can keep this room for a while longer if you're not ready to move out yet.[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
Protected? Protected from what?[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
Huh?[Reki]
Rakka, where are you going?[Rakka]
(Gasps.)[Reki]
Rakka.[Rakka]
In the Western Woods... the birds...[Reki]
Mmm, they must've been surprised as well.[Rakka]
It seems like they were trying to tell me something.[Reki]
[Rakka]
Reki.[Reki]
Hey, where's Kana and Kuu?[Hikari]
[Nemu]
[Hikari]
I thought she might have gone into town, but...[Reki]
[Rakka]
I'll go look for her.[Reki]
Look for her where?[Nemu]
What's up with Rakka?[Reki]
[Hikari]
[Nemu]
[Hikari]
[Reki]
[Nemu]
All right.[Reki]
Oh, damn, and I just got dry.[Hikari]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
Maybe... Kuu didn't go into town.[Reki]
Hmm?[Rakka]
This morning, she asked you to pack her lunch, right?[Reki]
Oh, yeah.[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
Probably... the Western Woods.[Reki]
[Kana]
[Reki]
[Kana]
But if she really did go there then that means that...[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Kana]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
That was because of the rain.[Rakka]
But then I saw a light there for a moment.[Kana]
Like lightning?[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Kana]
You're lying!![Rakka]
Uh... Kana.[Kana]
[Reki]
I didn't want to believe it either, but it seems that Kuu might have really left all of us.[Rakka]
What?[Reki]
The time when a Haibane goes outside the walls, on their Day of Flight.[Hikari]
[Kana]
[Nemu]
What do you mean?[Kana]
[Reki]
[Kana]
All the more reason why we can't leave Kuu by herself![Reki]
A guiding hand is given to a Haibane on the Day of Flight.[Kana]
[Reki]
Kana, even if you go, there's nothing you can do.[Kana]
[Nemu]
Reki, is it true about Kuu?[Hikari]
If there's still time, I want to see her, too.[Reki]
[Rakka]
We need to have a point of reference.[Reki]
What's that?[Rakka]
Kana, the bell on the clock tower.[Kana]
What?[Rakka]
[Kana]
That's right![Reki]
Rakka.[Rakka]
[Nemu]
So, bring three more raincoats, or four more?[Reki]
[Kana]
Kuu![Rakka]
(Gasps.)[Kuu]
[Rakka]
Kuu!![Reki]
Everybody... in the end, everybody leaves me.
