[Rakka]
You look a little pale.[Reki]
I didn't sleep enough, but I'm alright.[Rakka]
Oh, here. You left this on the table.[Reki]
[Hikari]
[Reki]
Uh-oh, she's becoming a full-blooded housekeeper.[Hikari]
No, you're becoming a slob.[Nemu]
[Rakka]
Bell nuts?[Hikari]
We need them for the Passing of the Year Festival.[Rakka]
Are all of these from the same kind of tree?[Hikari]
[Rakka]
Oh?[Reki]
Having fun?[Rakka]
The sound is very soothing.[Reki]
Yeah.[Rakka]
So, these symbolize appreciation?[Reki]
[Rakka]
Oh.[Midori]
Why can't you at least pretend to be part of the group?[Hyohko]
Shut up and stop following me![Midori]
[Reki]
It's nothing.[Midori]
If you have something to say to me, then why don't you just say it?[Reki]
[Midori]
Reki?[Hyohko]
The festival's not till next week.[Reki]
I don't have much time. And... I might not see you again.[Hyohko]
[Midori]
Oh, you've got to be kidding.[Hyohko]
[Midori]
And then she left, taking you with her.[Hyohko]
[Midori]
[Reki]
[Midori]
[Hyohko]
It wasn't her fault! I did it on my own![Midori]
Reki is still selfish![Hyohko]
You were one of her best friends.[Midori]
Why don't you shut up!?[Rakka]
[Midori]
[Rakka]
[Hyohko]
[Midori]
Idiot, you aren't allowed to enter the South District. Remember?[Hyohko]
Don't you worry about me. I got a brain.[Midori]
What brain?[Hikari]
Good morning.[Rakka]
Oh, good morning.[Hikari]
[Rakka]
Okay.[Kana]
Hey, I'm starving![Hikari]
Hey, Kana, why don't you help for a change?[Kana]
Yeah, I know, alright.[Nemu]
Rakka, have you seen Reki?[Rakka]
Uh-uh, I don't know what I should do.[Nemu]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Communicator]
Where did you learn that? I permit you to speak.[Rakka]
[Communicator]
[Rakka]
Kuu has a different name?[Communicator]
[Rakka]
Rakka...[Communicator]
Can you tell me where that name came from?[Rakka]
It's because I isolated myself inside a shell like a nut.[Communicator]
[Rakka]
Ah, but, what about Reki?[Communicator]
[Rakka]
Why not?[Communicator]
Five years ago, she brought to us a Haibane boy who had fallen ill.[Rakka]
I know. He tried to climb the wall by driving a wedge into it.[Communicator]
[Rakka]
[Communicator]
Why do you think you were forgiven?[Rakka]
It's not because I forgave myself.[Communicator]
[Rakka]
[Communicator]
[Rakka]
Reki's name. Her true name.[Reki]
Stir lightly, being careful not to flatten the meringue.[Hikari]
Like this?[Reki]
[Hikari]
Okay.[Rakka]
Hello, good morning.[Reki]
[Hikari]
You've been a tremendous help with this, Reki.[Reki]
[Hikari]
Yes, I know![Reki]
[Rakka]
Reki?[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Kana]
[Rakka]
You are?[Hikari]
That's why we have these--to express feelings without words.[Kana]
And at the end of the festival--o-oops.[Rakka]
And at the end?[Hikari]
You'll see. It can't be explained in words.[Kid]
Is it coming--?[Midori]
Honestly, you really are a meddler, aren't you?[Dai]
Rakka![Rakka]
Dai.[Dai]
It's a cake![Rakka]
I know I'm getting in the way, but...[Midori]
[Rakka]
What? But...[Midori]
[Dai]
Because you've got no class. Right, Midori?[Midori]
[Rakka]
[Midori]
[Rakka]
Wait a minute! What's the matter?![Midori]
[Rakka]
[Midori]
Where's Reki's room?[Rakka]
West wing, third floor.[Midori]
[Rakka]
Reki!![Midori]
[Reki]
[Midori]
[Rakka]
Yellow...? What does yellow mean?[Reki]
[Midori]
"Good-bye and thank you", Reki.[Kana]
Hey, Rakka![Hikari]
[Rakka]
Can you wait for a second?[Kana]
Huh?[Nemu]
What's going on?[Rakka]
Just stay here.[Kana]
The bell stopped. So ends the year.[Rakka]
That's right. So what happens now?[Hikari]
The walls send the thoughts they've been receiving from everyone over the past year into the sky.[Rakka]
The thoughts?[Hikari]
You just listen for it.
