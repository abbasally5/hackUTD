Sleep over? He's so lucky![Shorta]
I wanna go, too![Reki]
Next year, Shorta.[Shorta]
Why does only Dai get to go there? No fair![Reki]
Dai..., you take care.[Dai]
Of course![Rakka]
I like the smell of the river. For some reason, it seems so familiar.[Dai]
Yeah?[Rakka]
You are too hot?[Dai]
Reki made me wear this. She said I had to, or I catch a cold.[Rakka]
So, are you going to miss her much while you're away?[Dai]
[Rakka]
Maybe that's because she already misses you.[Dai]
[Rakka]
Yeah, that's very true.[Dai]
Over here![Rakka]
Maybe, nobody's home.[Male-Haibane]
[Hyohko]
[Male-Haibane]
I was just saying hello to the visitors down there.[Hyohko]
Huh? It's that funny-haired chick.[Midori]
Wow, thanks a lot.[Female-Haibane A]
Hey, you didn't have to do that.[Midori]
Did you make these by yourself?[Rakka]
Mm-hm, Hikari did. You know her?[Female-Haibane B]
Oh, I know her! The girl that works at the bakery, right?[Female-Haibane A]
Hey, what's your name?[Rakka]
I'm Rakka.[Hyohko]
Try it.[Midori]
Hey, now, don't let the kid get hurt![Hyohko]
Don't worry![Midori]
[Dai]
Ｙｅａｈｈｈ! Uh![Midori]
Are you still angry?[Rakka]
Huh?[Midori]
At Hyohko, I mean.[Rakka]
No, not at all.[Midori]
Well, that's good.[Rakka]
Anyway, I just want to say thank you for taking in Dai.[Female-Haibane B]
Actually, we should be thanking you for taking care of our kids all that time.[Female-Haibane A]
[Rakka]
What trouble?[Female-Haibane A]
[Midori]
I wouldn't know![Female-Haibane A]
Oh, she can be so pigheaded.[Midori]
[Rakka]
Oh, okay.[Midori]
[Rakka]
Well, I saw...I saw you guys and Reki arguing over here before.[Midori]
What else?[Rakka]
And I also heard that Reki and Hyohko of Abandoned Factory tried to...[Midori]
Run away together, right? Give me a break.[Rakka]
Isn't it true?[Midori]
[Rakka]
Reki... Reki wouldn't do such horrible things.[Midori]
You know nothing about her, Reki's capable of doing. Nothing![Rakka]
[Communicator]
[Rakka]
Reki has been acting a little nervous lately.[Communicator]
[Rakka]
[Communicator]
[Rakka]
[Communicator]
[Rakka]
Is it possible for Haibane to remain here?[Communicator]
[Rakka]
[Communicator]
[Rakka]
Thanks for meeting me.[Reki]
[Rakka]
It's okay. Are you painting again?[Reki]
No, I'm just... I'm just smearing a few paints around the studio.[Rakka]
Oh, yeah. This is for you.[Reki]
From Midori?[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
No, she didn't.[Reki]
[Rakka]
Reki! I'll do my best![Reki]
[Kana]
[Hikari]
[Rakka]
Mm.[Hikari]
What's the matter?[Nemu]
I have a cold.[Kana]
Don't spread it.[Nemu]
[Hikari]
[Nemu]
[Hikari]
Why don't you ask Kana?[Kana]
Oh, No, that's gonna making me late for work.[Hikari]
Only ten minutes late, that's okay, right?[Kana]
Actually, for Master, ten minutes is not okay.[Rakka]
I have some time. I'll go.[Nemu]
You will? Thanks.[Rakka]
Sure, it's no problem. Kana will give me a ride. Right?[Kana]
Huh? Ugh...[Rakka]
Thanks![Librarian]
[Rakka]
What's this?[Sumika]
Oh, hey, Rakka! Why are you here?[Rakka]
[Sumika]
It's almost my due date.[Rakka]
Is it still okay for you to be out?[Sumika]
[Rakka]
It's so mysterious, isn't it?[Sumika]
[Rakka]
Oh, she has a cold and won't be in today. I came by to tell them that.[Sumika]
[Rakka]
Petrified books?[Sumika]
[Rakka]
So, what is the book about?[Sumika]
[Dai]
I almost got it! One more time![Rakka]
Rek...[Midori]
You know nothing about her, Reki's capable of doing.[Rakka]
Reki![Reki]
[Rakka]
Oh, I didn't know peaches were good for colds.[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
What? That was sudden.[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
Yeah, that makes sense. Guess you're right.[Reki]
Off to work, huh? Good luck.[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Nemu]
Reki...[Reki]
Now, it's time for me to end it.
