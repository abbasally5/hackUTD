[Rakka]
[Reki]
Aaaaah![Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
I guess that my name is more suitable for you.[Reki]
Damn.[Rakka][Reki]
(Laugh.)[Reki]
[Rakka]
Are you a painter?[Reki]
Yeah, but I'm not a real one, though.[Rakka]
Can I see?[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
Oh, sorry.[Reki]
It's okay.[Rakka]
[Reki]
Hmm, I'll eat later.[Rakka]
[Reki]
The Temple? By yourself?[Rakka]
No. Hikari says she'll come along with me.[Reki]
Okay. Well then, you take care.[Rakka]
I will.[Reki]
Huh... the same dream again.[Hikari]
You're worrying too much![Rakka]
[Hikari]
[Rakka]
I don't know.[Nemu]
[Rakka]
Really?[Hikari]
We're going this way.[Rakka]
What? The Temple isn't in town?[Hikari]
[Nemu]
Well, take care.[Hikari]
It's staying up on its own.[Rakka]
What?[Hikari]
[Rakka]
[Hikari]
Uh, well, it's nothing, forget it.[Rakka].
Hikari, why did you want to be the Halo bearer?[Hikari]
[Hikari]
What's wrong?[Rakka]
Uh...[Hikari]
[Rakka]
Ah...[Hikari]
[Hikari]
Hey, you weren't scared.[Rakka]
[Hikari]
You should be careful.[Rakka]
[Rakka][Hikari]
Uh?[Rakka]
The Communicator we saw yesterday?[Hikari]
[Rakka]
Uh...[Hikari]
[Rakka]
[Communicator]
[Hikari]
Shh![Communicator]
[Rakka]
Uh, uh...[Communicator]
Your name is Rakka, is it not?[Rakka]
Uh...[Communicator]
[Hikari]
Whew, that was tense, don't you think?[Rakka]
[Hikari]
[Rakka]
[Hikari]
Huh?[Rakka]
[Hikari]
[Rakka]
Oh, really?[Hikari]
[Rakka]
[Hikari]
You worry too much.[Rakka]
Mmm, but I...[Hikari]
Well, see you in the evening, then.[Rakka]
Okay, thank you.[Kids]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
Reki.[Reki]
[Rakka]
Mmm. Uhm...[Reki]
[Rakka]
Yes, but I got scolded since I couldn't move my wings.[Reki]
[Rakka]
Reki, you know...[Reki]
Hmm?[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
Must be hard work.[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Kids]
[Housemother]
[Reki]
[Shorta]
Because they're bitter.[Dai]
Bitter![Reki]
[Housemother]
At a time like this, the teacher must set for them a good example![Rakka]
Hehehe.[Reki]
You do it.[Rakka]
Eh? Eh? Eh?[Reki]
[Rakka]
I just have to eat this, right?[Reki]
Right. Just act like you're enjoying them.[Rakka]
Reki, go eat them yourself.[Reki]
[Hana]

Ooh![Reki]
Eat with a smile.[Rakka]
[Kids]
[Reki]
[Kids]
[Reki]
Come on, you won't grow big and strong unless you eat them up.[Hana]
So what![Reki]
If you're a bad girl and don't finish your carrots, a huge scary carrot monster will come to get you in the middle of the night![Hana]

[Reki]
[Hana]

I'm not lying.[Reki]
[Hana]

[Shorta]
Yeah, just like pancakes.[Dai]
I want some pancakes![Kid]
Pancakes! Pancakes! Panca... Uh![Housemother]
Ahem![Reki]
Hah.[Housemother]
[Reki]
Then what did we go through all that trouble for?[Housemother]
[Reki]
So this whole thing is because you just wanted some pancakes?[Rakka]
Um, I'll go get them.[Reki]
You sure?[Rakka]
[Kids]
What? Who told you that we hate carrots?[Rakka]
Unless you go back to the classroom and apologize to Teacher Reki and your housemother, there will be no snacks for any of you.[Kids]
What kind of snacks?[Rakka]
Pancakes![Kids]
The sweet kind?[Rakka]
Mmhmm.[Kids]
[Kuu]
Hey, Rakka![Rakka]
Oh, Kuu.[Kuu]
Where are you going?[Rakka]
[Kuu]
[Rakka]
You were walking on the Hill of Winds this morning, right?[Kuu]
[Rakka]
Wow. It looks nice.[Kuu]
[Rakka]
Wouldn't it be nice if we could really fly?[Kuu]
We can![Rakka]
What?[Kuu]
[Rakka]
[Kuu]
[Rakka]
[Kuu]
[Rakka]
[Kuu]
[Rakka]
Ha ha.[Man]
[Kuu]
[Rakka]
Huh?[Kuu]
[Man]
Get outta here![Kuu]
[Rakka]
Mmm.[Kuu]
[Rakka]
Oh! Then it must be a special store with a very good reputation.[Kuu]
[Rakka]
Oh.[Woman]
[Rakka]
Oh, thank you,[Bakery Employee]
Croissants ready![Hikari]
Yes![Bakery Employee]
Bacon rolls ready![Hikari]
Yes![Bakery Employee]
Butter rolls ready![Hikari]
Yes![Kuu]
This is great![Rakka]
We better not disturb Hikari.[Baker]
[Rakka]
Uh, yes.[Baker]
Hey, your friends are here.[Hikari]
Oh, hi.[Rakka]
We came to buy some snacks, little treats for the kids[Hikari]
[Kuu][Rakka]
Wow![Rakka]
It must be hard work.[Hikari]
[Baker]
[Rakka]
[Kuu]
Hikari, this is great![Hikari]
He he he.[Baker]
She brought in an interesting frying-pan the other day, so we experimented with it.[Rakka]
Hikari...[Rakka]
[Kuu]
[Rakka]
Hikari![Hikari]
But you see, I just couldn't help trying it when I saw that mold.[Rakka]
How could you even think of doing something like that?![Hikari]
I washed it clean.[Rakka]
That's beside the point![Reki]
How would they like it if I made them carrot cakes?[Housemother]
You can't eat carrots either, can you?[Reki]
I can eat carrots just fine if I close my eyes![Housemother]
[Reki]
[Housemother]
Well, I guess you've grown up enough to know not to run away.[Reki]
Give me a break.[Hikari]
And when we sell them at the store, we put two pieces on top of each other and then put strawberries and whipped cream in the center.[Kana]
Let's just eat them. Hurry up.[Nemu]
Mmm, sounds good.[Kuu]
[Kana]
I'm so tired.[Rakka]
Hah...[Hikari]
Rakka, I'm really sorry.[Rakka]
