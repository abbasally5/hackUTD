[Rakka]
[Reki]
Hmm? This is--oh my. This is big![Hikari]
[Kana]
[Kids]
Come on, Reki! Please![Reki]
Come on, you saw the sign to stay out; why can't you listen?[Kids]
We wanna see![Reki]
I already said "no."[Kids]
[Kana]
[Reki]
So, think you can take some time off from work?[Hikari]
Of course! This is a big event for all of us Haibane. We can't miss it![Kana]
[Kuu]
Wow! It's huge![Kana]
Whoa... now that is something really big.[Nemu]
You're late.[Kana]
Oh, come on! I didn't get the word in time. And do you know how hard it is for me to leave work early?[Hikari]
[Kana]
[Hikari]
I guess.[Nemu]
[Reki]
[Kuu]
Is there really someone inside of the cocoon, Reki?[Reki]
[Kids]
[Reki]
[Kids]
Monster![Reki]
[Nemu]
She's the one who's been acting up over this the most.[Hikari]
[Kuu]
[Kana]
Wow, this cocoon is way bigger than yours was, Kuu.[Kuu]
What?![Kana]
Come on, time to clean the room.[Kuu]
You're mean![Rakka]
[Kana]
[Hikari]
When do you think it's gonna hatch?[Kana]
I won't help there already...[Rkka]
There must be people outside.[Kuu]
It's all clean now.[Kana]
I'm so tired.[Hikari]
There.[Reki]
Okay then, we'll draw straws to see who takes the first watch.[Kuu]
Yeah! Whoo-hoo![Kana]
[Hikari]
How can you say that?![Reki]
[Kana]
Huh! So now you think we're baby chicks?[Nemu]
Well, why don't you just sleep during your watch?[Reki]
That defeats the purpose of having a watch![Kuu]
Hey, I just heard it make a "blub" sound.[Reki],[Nemu]
Huh?[Kuu]
See?[Reki],[Nemu]
Huh?[Kana],[Hikari]
Huh?[Everyone]
Huh? Oh... Huh? Argh![Rakka]
[Reki]
[Kuu]
[Hikari]
See, I should've stayed here, just like I said.[Kana]
But you wanted to be the ring person.[Rakka]
Well, uh, um...[Hikari]
How do you feel?[Kuu]
Are you hungry?[Reki]
[Kuu]
Okay.[Reki]
[Nemu]
You turned this guestroom into your room, to be more precise.[Reki]
[Rakka]
Uh, uh... sure.[Reki]
First of all, can you tell us about your dream?[Rakka]
My dream?[Reki]
[Rakka]
Well, uh...[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Kuu]
[Hikari]
[Kuu]
[Hikari]
[Kana]
[Nemu]
Do you wanna get hit?[Reki]
[Rakka]
I think I might have saw something, but I can't remember.[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Hikari]
Feather Rakka, to help guide your future as a fellow Haibane, I give you this halo.[Rakka]
[Hikari]
Oh, be careful, it's still hot.[Rakka]
Hmm... Oh, no! Oh...[Everyone]
Oh...[Hikari]
Well, it looks good.[Reki]
Don't worry--it'll stick in a few days.[Kuu]
Oh no, lunch break is over.[Kana]
[Hikari]
[Nemu]
Reki, you can take it from here.[Kuu]
Rakka, see you later![Kana]
Bye![Hikari]
See you tomorrow![Kana]
Hurry up![Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Laughs.][Rakka]
Are those real?[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
Huh?[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
Mirror...[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
I wanna go home.[Reki]
[Rakka]
Why?[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Whimpering.][Reki]
It's started.[Rakka]
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts![Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
Hmm?[Rakka]
What are you doing?[Reki]
I have to brush your wings to make them clean.[Rakka]
Have you done it... for a while?[Reki]
[Rakka]
Is your hand all right?[Reki]
[Rakka]
Mmm... my head is hot.[Reki]
[Rakka]
Mmm.[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
Hmm, ha, ha.[Rakka]
Huh? Don't laugh![Reki]
Do you attract static?[Rakka]
[Reki]
It's nothing.[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
Thank you very much.[Reki]
