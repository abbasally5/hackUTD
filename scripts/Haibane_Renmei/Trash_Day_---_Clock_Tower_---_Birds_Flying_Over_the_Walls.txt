[Rakka]
[Kana]
Hey! Wake up![Rakka]
[Kana]
[Rakka]
Yes, I know. What time is it?[Kana]
Six thirty-four in the morning.[Rakka]
[Kana]
[Rakka]
[Kana]
Rakka.[Rakka]
[Kana]
Did you leave this out here?[Rakka]
Mm-hm. I thought the birds might eat it.[Kana]
[Rakka]
Uh... Um... But I...[Kana]
[Rakka]
[Kana]
[Rakka]
Kana![Kana]
Oh, sorry.[Rakka]
That was mean![Kana]
[Rakka]
Wow, they're really smart.[Kana]
[Rakka]
Uh, I know, oh, why don't we just take out the things that crows might like to eat?[Kana]
[Rakka]
Oh, oh...[Kana]
[Rakka]
Oh.[Kana]
[Rakka]
Mmm.[Kana]
[Rakka]
Oh.[Kana]
[Rakka]
Well, um, I can't really remember, but I think I was having a bad dream.[Kana]
Well then, good thing I woke you up so pleasantly.[Rakka]
Uh, I think maybe that's what caused it.[Kana]
Well then, time for breakfast.[Rakka]
Where did you get that watch?![Kana]
[Rakka]
[Kana]
[Rakka]
It's still amazing.[Kana]
[Rakka]
A biggie?[Kana]
Wanna see?[Reki]
So, where did you get the tea cups?[Nemu]
[Reki]
Oh, now you're a librarian abusing her power, right?[Nemu]
[Reki]
Sad, isn't it? The older you get, the more deceptive you become.[Nemu]
[Kuu]
Huh?[Rakka]
Uh...[Kana]
[Rakka]
Uh.[Kana]
Isn't this like a secret hideout?[Rakka]
[Kana]
[Rakka]
What is that?[Kana]
[Rakka]
[Kana]
[Rakka]
That's why you work at the clock tower?[Kana]
[Rakka]
I hope that you can fix it.[Kana]
[Nemu]
Today is very relaxing.[Reki]
[Hikari]
Having good tea makes a difference.[Everyone]
Huh?[Kana]
Urgh...[Rakka]
Ah... Kana![Kana]
Rakka, breakfast![Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Kana]
Jump on, hurry up![Rakka]
[Kana]
Shut up, you'll bite your tongue![Rakka]
Are we flying?![Kana]
[Rakka]
What?[Kana]
[Watchmaker]
[Kana]
Good, perfect time.[Watchmaker]
[Kana]
[Watchmaker]
[Rakka]
Uh...[Watchmaker]
[Kana]
Ow![Watchmaker]
Do you buy liquor from a teetotaler?[Kana]
I'm too young to buy liquor.[Watchmaker]
[Kana]
[Watchmaker]
[Kana]
[Watchmaker]
Hey you, what's your name?[Rakka]
[Watchmaker]
You're new to Old Home, aren't you?[Rakka]
Ah, yes.[Watchmaker]
Got used to this town yet?[Rakka]
Uh, a little bit.[Watchmaker]
And Kana, she's being nice to you?[Rakka]
Yes.[Watchmaker]
Uh.[Rakka]
Is there anything you like me to do?[Watchmaker]
[Kana]
Hey Master, are we gonna be tending the store again today?[Watchmaker]
[Kana]
[Watchmaker]
And if you have any questions, just ask Kana.[Rakka]
Okay.[Kana]
How come you're so nice to everybody else but me?[Rakka]
He he he.[Watchmaker]
[Kana]
So he says.[Rakka]
Wow![Kana]
[Rakka]
Late-night snack?[Kana]
[Rakka]
So where should we start off?[Kana]
[Rakka]
[Kana]
Here you go.[Rakka]
Seems like everybody has a job.[Kana]
You already knew that.[Rakka]
But, I wonder why the Haibane work.[Kana]
[Rakka]
That's not what I meant.[Kana]
[Rakka]
Yes, sort of.[Kana]
[Rakka]
[Kana]
Ah-ha, now I get it, you were helping Reki yesterday, weren't you?[Rakka]
[Kana]
[Rakka]
Mm.[Kana]
Oh, but unless you work hard, you could end up being one of those high-maintenance kids instead of an assistant.[Rakka]
Ah, really?[Kana]
[Rakka]
Umm.[Kana]
[Rakka]
Uh.[Kana]
Nice view, isn't it?[Rakka]
Mm.[Kana]
[Rakka]
[Kana]
[Rakka]
[Kana]
[Rakka]
[Kana]
[Rakka]
Oh, the birds.[Kana]
Hm?[Rakka]
They're flying over the walls.[Kana]
The Haibane believe that they carry our lost items.[Rakka]
Lost items?[Kana]
[Rakka]
Huh?[Kana]
Feeling any better now?[Rakka]
Um, yes, much better.[Kana]
[Watchmaker]
[Kana]
What's next?[Watchmaker]
Yeah, that's it.[Kana]
What's this?[Watchmaker]
[Kana]
Can I really?[Watchmaker]
[Kana]
Alright![Rakka]
[Watchmaker]
Hey, is Kana going to leave this place?[Rakka]
[Watchmaker]
[Rakka]
They might look fancy, but the truth is that they really don't work at all.[Watchmaker]
[Kana]
Rakka, can't you go any faster?[Rakka]
No, safety first.[Kana]
Damn.[Rakka]
I wanted to say thank you for today.[Kana]
Yeah, did it help you out?[Rakka]
Yes, I discovered a lot of things.[Kana]
Like what, Rakka?[Rakka]
Don't judge people by appearances.[Kana]
[Rakka]
No, not him.[Kana]
What?[Rakka]
[Kana]
You're strange.[Rakka]
I think I can smell the river.[Kana]
Hmm.[Rakka]
Maybe I've seen scenery like this one time somewhere before.[Kana]
[Rakka]
[Kana]
What is it?[Rakka]
[Kana]
[Reki]
Never give up, huh?[Kana]
Yeah, they don't, those damn crows.[Reki]
No, I meant you.[Kana]
What'd you say!?[Reki]
Oops, backfired.[Rakka]
You shouldn't give up.[Kana]
You aren't trying to patronize me, are you, Rakka?[Rakka]
[Kana]
[Rakka]
