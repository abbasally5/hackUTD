[Rakka]
Kuu...[Kana]
Rakka...[Nemu]
Rakka, if you keep crying like that, Kuu can't go on her journey without worrying about you.[Rakka]
[Hikari]
[Reki]
Let's go.[Kana]
I wonder if Kuu can hear the bells.[Hikari]
[Rakka]
[Cafe Master]
[Rakka]
Kuu.[Cafe Master]
[Rakka]
Kuu isn't here anymore.[Cafe Master]
[Rakka]
But I...[Cafe Master]
Here you go. Have some more coffee.[Rakka]
[Hyohko]
Hey.[Rakka]
Ah...[Hyohko]
You live in that run-down house in the south district, don't you?[Rakka]
It's called Old Home.[Hyohko]
[Rakka]
You're Hiyoko.[Hyohko]
[Rakka]
[Hyohko]
Hey, wait![Hikari]
Kana![Kana]
Overcooked![Hikari]
It's cooked fine.[Kana]
No, it's not.[Nemu]
Where's Rakka?[Hikari]
[Kana]
Maybe she's on a diet.[Hikari]
Kana.[Kana]
[Hikari]
Alone?[Kana]
[Nemu]
[Kana]
Oh, so Rakka did it, too?[Reki]
Kana, you went to Kuu's room, too?[Kana]
[Hikari]
I wonder if Rakka just can't accept it.[Nemu]
You know, I thought maybe we should leave her alone until she's ready to let it go.[Reki]
But she has to find closure to this event sometime.[Hikari]
[Rakka]
[Hikari]
[Rakka]
Mm-hmm.[Hikari]
[Rakka]
[Hikari]
Fine. We'll be waiting.[Kana]
Looks too difficult for me.[Hikari]
Come on, help us.[Kana]
[Hikari]
[Nemu]
[Kana]
I just don't like doing stupid work like that.[Reki]
Your Clock Master would be in tears if he heard what you just said.[Kana]
[Rakka]
Uh...um, good morning.[Nemu]
Hey, good morning, Rakka.[Reki]
Um, what happened to your dress?[Rakka]
Uh, it got dirty. So I washed it.[Hikari]
Here, take a look at this.[Rakka]
What is it?[Hikari]
[Kana]
Rakka, are you good at sewing?[Rakka]
[Kana]
[Hikari]
[Rakka]
Uh, it's nothing.[Hikari]
[Rakka]
Well, not really.[Hikari]
[Reki]
Rakka. What's this?[Rakka]
[Kana]
[Nemu]
Because it won't fit through the door.[Hikari]
[Rakka]
What?[Kana]
[Rakka]
But It's Kuu's...[Nemu]
I think Kuu would be very happy knowing that you would have it.[Rakka]
[Reki]
Rakka![Kana]
Rakka?[Hikari]
What happened? It seems like I said something wrong to her?[Reki]
[Hikari]
I'll come with you![Reki]
No, leave it to me.[Hikari]
But...[Reki]
[Rakka]
Stay away![Reki]
It's all right.[Rakka]
[Reki]
It's gonna be all right.[Rakka]
Am I... sick?[Reki]
[Rakka]
It stings.[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
An elderly tree?[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
So am I...[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
Reki, you don't remember your dream in the cocoon?[Reki]
[Rakka]
