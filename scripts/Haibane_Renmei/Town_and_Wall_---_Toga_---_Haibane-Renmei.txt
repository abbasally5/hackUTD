[Rakka]
[Kids]
Reki, play with us![Reki]
How many times have I told you kids not to come into this room with your muddy shoes on.[Dai]
Reki, why aren't you coming to class with us?[Reki]
[Dai]
Uh-uh. I just fell down.[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Hana]
[Rakka]
Mm-hm.[Hana]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
Okay.[Dai]
Hey, she's got a halo holder. It's a halo holder.[Rakka]
Huh? Holder?[Shorta]
Can I take a look at your back?[Rakka]
Yeah, sure.[Dai]
Wow, that must hurt![Shorta]
So, did you cry?[Dai]
I didn't cry![Shorta]
That's a lie![Dai]
How do you know it's a lie?![Shorta]
Because it is![Reki]
Hey, guys, cut it out![Hana]
[Rakka]
Like this?[Hana]
[Reki]
Oh, boy.[Kuu]
[Hikari]
We picked up some breakfast![Reki]
Hm, thank you.[Hikari]
[Nemu]
[Rakka]
Well, it was all gone when I woke up this morning.[Reki]
Honestly, what makes everybody think my room is their hang-out?[Nemu]
Well, it's comfortable here for some reason.[Reki]
You always come in without asking as if it was your own room, and that's why the kids are doing the same.[Hikari]
The truth is Reki just moved herself into the guestroom.[Reki]
[Nemu]
Which room are you going to move into?[Reki]
The end room on the floor above.[Nemu]
But there's a vacant room right next door.[Reki]
I've been using the room upstairs as my studio, and I have a feeling I won't be sleeping quietly on this floor.[Nemu]
But you're the noisiest person whenever you get out of bed.[Reki]
I don't believe I'm hearing that from someone who never even wants to wake up.[Kana]
Yeah, Nemu's snoozes are really hard-core.[Kuu]
[Nemu]
Oh, come on, can't we just drop the subject.[Rakka]
[Kana]
[Hana]
[Dai]
I wanna be a carpenter![Rakka]
A dream for the future.[Shorta]
Shortcake![Dai]
That's just your favorite food, Shorta.[Shorta]
[Reki]
You two, I told you to stop fighting.[Rakka]
[Reki]
Huh? I, um...[Dai]
Reki means little stones![Rakka]
What?[Reki]
[Hikari]
Come to think of it, you like to walk, don't you, Reki?[Nemu]
Yeah, and switching rooms, too.[Kana]
[Kuu]
[Rakka]
Mmm.[Kuu]
It's okay, isn't it?[Reki]
Only if Rakka wants to.[Hikari]
Aren't you coming with us, Reki?[Reki]
[Hikari]
Well, see you later.[Reki]
Rakka.[Rakka]
Mm?[Reki]
You should try to take it easy, you're still recuperating.[Rakka]
Uh, yeah.[Reki]
Well now.[Kuu]
Ooh, yeah![Kana]
All right![Kuu]
Let's go![Nemu]
[Hikari]
[Kana]
[Rakka]
Sure.[Kuu]
You're gonna be hanging around with us a lot anyway right?[Kana]
Watch out![Rakka]
Not everybody has wings like we do.[Hikari]
[Kana]
[Rakka]
Really?[Kuu]
[Kana]
That sounds pretty good, but you mean that thrift shop, don't you?[Rakka]
Thrift shop?[Hikari]
[Nemu]
Wing covers too, so when it gets cold.[Rakka]
[Old-Clothes Dealer]
[Hikari]
Oh, she's a newborn.[Old-Clothes Dealer]
Yeah? Ahh. That's why.[Rakka]
Uh? Ah...[Old-Clothes Dealer]
All right, then why don't you pick out something you like from that clothing section over there.[Rakka]
Is it okay?[Kana]
Hey, what about us?[Old-Clothes Dealer]
For you guys... These.[Kana]
Ugh![Old-Clothes Dealer]
[Kana]
You should at least wash them.[Kuu]
Yuck![Nemu]
They're disgusting[Old-Clothes Dealer]
Hey, you can only have one piece each, all right?[Kana]
Yeah, we get it.[Nemu]
What a cheapskate.[Old-Clothes Dealer]
[Kana]
'Cause it isn't easy.[Kuu]
Rakka, have you decided?[Rakka]
[Kana]
[Hikari]
Oh, that's right. You don't have a notebook yet.[Old-Clothes Dealer]
[Rakka]
Ah![Nemu]
Sorry, did I hurt you?[Rakka]
[Old-Clothes Dealer]
[Kana]
Rakka![Rakka]
Yeah.[Hikari]
We got some tea![Nemu]
Coming![Rakka]
Oh, one thing, what's that Haibane Renmei you spoke of?[Nemu]
[Kana]
[Hikari]
[Rakka]
Oh.[Kuu]
Hey, look over there.[Kana]
[Rakka]
Toga?[Nemu]
See, those people there bringing in the carts are the Toga.[Rakka]
Look at those walls.[Kana]
[Rakka]
Communicator?[Kana]
[Hikari]
[Nemu]
[Kuu]
[Kana]
Idiot![Kuu]
Mmph![Nemu]
[Kana]
[Hikari]
You don't know if that's the one who's been scavenging our trash.[Kana]
I hate crows! Rakka![Rakka]
I can see the wall over there.[Nemu]
[Rakka]
So what's beyond the walls?[Nemu]
[Kana]
Maybe you thought you were reading, but really just snoozing.[Nemu]
You wanna read them yourself instead?[Kana]
Ah! I'm suddenly attacked by drowsiness![Rakka]
Beyond those walls, I wonder if the town I used to live in is somewhere over there.[Kuu]
[Nemu]
[Rakka]
[Hikari]
[Rakka]
[Kana]
[Hikari]
Knock it off, Kana![Rakka]
Um, Really?[Nemu]
You wrote your name down when we went clothes shopping.[Rakka]
Oh yeah.[Kana]
All right, mob, Rakka's so quiet I was just trying to cheer her up.[Hikari]
Oh, come on![Nemu]
You're exactly like Reki used to be, acting just like her.[Kana]
Oh, rats.[Nemu]
Kana's just trying to make you feel welcomed in her own way.[Rakka]
Mm.[Kuu]
Oh, look, the lights are off in the guestroom.[Nemu]
I wonder if Reki's finished moving out.[Hikari]
So should we all say good-night right here?[Nemu]
Hikari and I live over there in the east tower.[Rakka]
Bye.[Kana]
Well, see you tomorrow.[Rakka]
Okay, see you.[Kuu]
Bye![Hikari]
Rakka, I'll come to get you tomorrow[Rakka]
Mm-hm, until tomorrow.[Rakka]
[Reki]
Oh, Rakka, so, how was it going to town?[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
We all ate at a cafe on the way back.[Reki]
Oh, I see.[Rakka]
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you waiting for me?[Reki]
[Rakka]
I'll make you some tea.[Reki]
[Rakka]
[Reki]
[Rakka]
Yes.[Reki]
[Rakka]
Is it staying?[Reki]
Mm-hmm.[Rakka]
[Reki]
I will when you're asleep.[Rakka]
I already am.[Reki]
Good night, Rakka.[Rakka]
Good night, Reki.
