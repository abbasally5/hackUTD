Holo:
I was hoping this would be a more moving reunion. But you look just terrible.

Lawrence:
Lemerio betrayed us. This is the only thing I could protect.

Holo:
Seriously, you are such an idiot. Your face is swollen from being hit.
You are covered in mud and your wrists are even burnt.
Even in this pathetic state, you are still careful and folded my robe to keep it from getting wet.
You are terribly good-natured!
Lawrence, I might be forced to kill humans.

Lawrence:
Holo…

Holo:
I had a plan to carry out this scheme as quickly as possible.
I wanted to go back to just us traveling alone.
It is the reason I did not argue with that arrogant youth.
I managed the situation with maturity.

Lawrence:
Did you have to… bow before them?

Holo:
I did!
Forget about it. I made the decision to do so.
And yet, this is how we are rewarded?
I return to find you in this abused state.
I cannot bear to see you suffer.
We will go see Lemerio immediately. A price must be paid for what he has done to us!

Lawrence:
No! Wait! We have to find Leibert and the others first, and as soon as possible.

Holo:
If a reason exists that will convince me, tell me now.

Lawrence:
They are planning to kill Nora.

Nora:
That little girl does have a partner as well. I am sure she will be fine even without our help.

Lawrence:
It may be true she has a partner, but there's only so much a sheep dog can do, Holo.
She needs you.
[There is only so much ~ can do :ができることには限りがある]


Holo:
What could I do?

Lawrence:
You could help. You could take care of a hundred men in no time.

Holo:
Of course I can, but only in my wolf form!

Lawrence:
So?

Holo:
That little girl is a shepherd, right?

Lawrence:
You have to do it, Holo. We can't let them kill her. You don't wanna see someone murdered anymore than I do.
I would be willing to show my appreciation as well.

Holo:
Really?

Lawrence:
As long as you don't say you want Nora's life, I'll do everything I can to fulfill your wish.
Come on! You're the only one that can save her. Holo!

Holo:
I should probably take off my clothes. It would be such a pain to make new ones.

Lawrence:
I'll take that as a yes.

Holo:
I still have one condition though.
It does not matter who they are; I will not be able to guarantee their safety if they begin to aggravate me.
You will accept this before I can act.

Lawrence:
Yes. I understand. Although I still have faith in you.

Holo:
When did you become such a smooth talker?
Honestly, my companion is nothing more than trouble.
I am sorry, did you have something to say?

Lawrence:
Yeah… you've got an amazing tail.

Holo:
Well, that was rather bland, but most appreciated.
Now then, I need you to close your eyes for a minute.
Go ahead. Get on. It is all right if you need to hold onto my hair.
Do not worry. If you fall, I will carry you in my mouth.

Lawrence:
I'm not gonna let go…

Holo:
Lawrence?

Lawrence:
What is it?

Holo:
It is, um... I just want you to know I do not like shepherds even a little.

Lawrence:
Good! I'm relieved to hear it.
Remember Nora's gonna have to quit working as a shepherd whether this job succeeds or not.

Holo:
I have decided on what I want.

Lawrence:
What?

Holo:
The finest honey-pickled peaches money can buy.

Lawrence:
Come on, Holo, …

Nora:
No! Lawrence and Holo?

Man:
When we found them, they were beyond recognition.
Their bodies laid over one another.

Leibert:
Nora!

Nora:
Excuse me. I think I'm okay now.

Leibert:
While it really is regrettable, we must remember we're alive and we should do our very best to carry on in their memory.

Holo:
Hey, I need to know if you are prepared for this.

Lawrence:
What?

Holo:
We are very near to them.

Lawrence:
We've already caught up?

Holo:
We have.

Lawrence:
I can't see them!

Holo:
Damn it! There are at least twenty people--and they appear to be heavily armed.

Lawrence:
Are you serious?

Holo:
It does not matter. Leave it to me!
Once I jump over them, I shall drop low. I want you to get off of me then.

Holo:
I want you to stay here!


Leibert:
Protect the shepherd and the sheep!

Lawrence:
Nora! She's still alive!

Leibert:
Take the shepherd and get out of here. Run!
Shepherd, do your job!

Nora:
Enek!

Lawrence:
Oh, no! This is bound to aggravate Holo.

Leibert:
Listen to me! I will pay you 300 Lumiones, if you protect me.

Lawrence:
Oh, God! No!

Nora:
Enek, go!


Part B

Nora:
Enek, no! Wait!

Lawrence:
Nora!

Nora:
Is that you? I can't believe it. Lawrence, you aren't a ghost, are you?

Lawrence:
Wanna know a secret? That wolf is actually Holo.

Nora:
Holo?

Lawrence:
So you didn't kill him after all?

Holo:
I thought about swallowing him once and for all.
But gold would probably not sit well with my stomach.

Lawrence:
Understandable.
This is it.

Leibert:
What the hell is going on?
I hope you bastards don't think you'll get away with this …

Lawrence:
Hello, Leibert. How's it going?

Leibert:
Please! I wasn't the one who betrayed you! It wasn't me. I swear. It wasn't me.

Lawrence:
This wolf is a proxy sent by the almighty God, you know.
She is not going to believe your lies.

Leibert:
No, no, no, no! The payment you demanded was too much for us.
If we paid as much as you wanted, we wouldn't have had any money left after paying our own debt.
It was Lemerio's idea.
It's not my fault. You understand. You're a merchant like me.

Lawrence:
I'm nothing like you!
I hope you can excuse all this commotion.

Nora:
Um, no problem.

Lawrence:
And now I'm sure you've realized Lemerio Trading has betrayed us.
I also heard them talking about their plans to kill you.

Nora:
I did think something seemed strange, but I never imagined...

Holo:
Well, are we going to run with the gold now or what?

Lawrence:
I'm not really sure.
If we don't smuggle the gold to Lubinheigen, the exchange rate for what Leibert purchased is still worth 600 gold Lumiones.
If we simply forget about Lemerio, we could split it with each other and live happily without having to work for a long time.
On The other hand, if we didn't get the funds from Lemerio in the first place, we wouldn't be in the position to keep this gold.
If we run with the money now, their company including all their employees will end up bankrupt, out of business.
And then... what then?

Holo!
I'm just trying to make sure that we can still live with ourselves at the end of the day.
If we get revenge on them for betraying us, there'll only be another revenge waiting.

Holo:
I'll take care of it!

Lawrence:
You can't tell me you're gonna kill everyone involved!
It won't feel good to buy bread tomorrow with money that's been stained with blood.
You have to believe me. There's more than just one option here.
Now is our opportunity to choose the road that will lead us into tomorrow.
Holo, don't act like you don't care. If it wasn't for you, I would have frozen to death.
And I appreciate your agreeing on my request more than you know.
Listen!

Holo:
Enough already! Do what you want!
I really do have the most troublesome companion.

Lawrence:
Sorry to keep you waiting.

Nora:
What? Oh, that's fine.

Lawrence:
So tell me what you'd think about this idea?


Holo:
Tell me the truth, Lawrence.

Lawrence:
The truth?

Holo:
Yes, please. I would like to hear it from you.

Lawrence:
What are you taking about?

Holo:
Do not play dumb with me. [play dumb:とぼける]
I know you are not quite the saint you pretend to be.


Lawrence:
I want you to be the one to decide whether or not we go ahead and take this gold into Lubinheigen.
And I won't mind at all if you think we should just divide the 600 Lumiones.

Nora:
Oh.

Lawrence:
But then, if we take it into town, well, I can turn it to six thousand.

Nora:
Six thousand!

Lawrence:
Yes. And with that much we could keep Lemerio Trading from going under. [go under :つぶれる]


Lawrence:
Since you seem to know everything already, I might as well tell you.
The amount of gold is too little.

Holo:
Really?

Lawrence:
Yeah. There is no way that bag has six hundred Lumiones in it.
There's a hundred at best.

Holo:
If we split it up and if you repaid your debt, there wouldn't be any left.
So unless we smuggle it, we won't make any money.

Lawrence:
Apparently they were starting to get desperate; the most they could come up with was one hundred Lumiones.
It's only a sixth that what we asked for.
If they smuggled this, it would increase to one thousand which would barely get them by.
Again it's not as if they would have had the split of proceeds with us to have their plan worked.

Holo:
Perhaps it was all they could afford. Either way, Lemerio Trading knew they could not pay us from the very beginning.

Lawrence:
Actually I bet it's the very reason they decided to go along with our little scheme.

Holo:
Yes, I understand it all now. However …

Lawrence:
Don't tell me there's more.

Holo:
It was not necessary to speak to that little girl the way you did.

Lawrence:
What, do you think I overdid it?

Holo:
You did not have to shoulder the burden all alone.
There is more I would like to say, but we are out of time.
Get on! You do have to go see Lemerio, correct?

Lawrence:
You're going to come in with me though, right?

Holo:
I have no interest in business dealings.

Lawrence:
Are you angry with me?

Holo:
If you don't hold on, I will throw you off!


Lemerio:
What! Five hundred?

Lawrence:
That's right. Once we succeed with the smuggling.
Do you think you would be able to buy it from us at 500 gold Lumiones?

Lemerio:
No! That's impossible! There's no way we can afford that in our current state!

Lawrence:
I'm not talking cash here.
All you would have to do is draw up a bond of debt, then you would simply pay installments over the next ten years.

Lemerio:
Didn't you hear me! Five hundred is too much!

Lawrence:
Interesting. You're someone who founded a trading company that can secure a fairly lucrative loading place in this town.
It seems to me five hundred in ten years would be a small price to pay for you.

Lemerio:
Wait! What are you doing?

Lawrence:
Your man Leibert was full of information.
I suppose you can run away with this insignificant amount of money.
But it might be in your best interest to simply accept our demand and rebuild your company.
You can put the Lohen Merchant Association as the loaner.

Lemerio:
Association?

Lawrence:
Well, you can always lie to an individual, but if you end up betraying an association, you'll never work as a merchant again.


Jacob:
I thought I'd seen the last of you! You scared the hell out of me, you stupid son of a gun!

Lawrence:
Jacob … help … I can't breathe …

Jacob:
Inspirational! What a good son! You're so devoted.

With this you'll be able to convert your ten-year-loan into cash immediately and still break off relations with Lemerio.
How the hell did you manage this?

Lawrence:
It was just a gold dealing, although I can't talk about it too loud.

Jacob:
For now, I'll buy this for thirty Lumiones. Once the deal goes through, I'll go ahead and give you another one hundred.

Lawrence:
A hundred?

Jacob:
It's an extra for such a joyous occasion.

Lawrence:
Thank you, Jacob.
If I have that much, I'll be able to repay what I owed to people when I go to apologize to them.

Jacob:
Now I can't believe it, Lawrence. You turned out to be quite an impressive peddler.
Now once the assessment is finished, we'll drink until we drop. [until we drop：とことんまで]

Lawrence:
Er, well, it's just my companion… She's waiting.


Holo:
You are late.

Lawrence:
I'm sorry. Now, did you have something you wanted to ask me?

Holo:
Two somethings.

Lawrence:
Two somethings?

Holo:
Firstly, how much do you trust that little shepherd girl?

Lawrence:
It doesn't matter even if Nora ran with the gold. We'd be able to catch her.
I guess I don't trust her to the extent that I gave her the gold with that in mind.

Holo:
Well, that is that then.

Lawrence:
What is your other question?
I promise I'll answer no matter what you ask.
Remember I'm the one who owes you now. So please ask away.　　　[ask away：なんでも聞け]

Holo:
I just wan… I think I need to get some air.

Do you… remember?
I have been wondering, whose name did you call when I faced the dog and the little shepherd girl?
I was so angry at the time, I could not hear you.
However I could still see you all, so I know you must have called at least one of our names.

Lawrence:
That's what's been weighing on your mind?

Holo:
No, not really. Like I said I had just been wondering about it.

Lawrence:
I called your name, Holo.

Holo:
Did you just lie to me?

Lawrence:
Yeah, I kinda did. To be honest, I don't remember what I said.
On the other hand…

Holo:
On the other hand?

Lawrence:
Given the situation, I'm almost positive I would have called out your name.
I didn't really have any time to waste. I imagine I must have unconsciously chosen to call your name.
Yes. That makes sense, because …

Holo:
Lawrence, hold on!
Okay. You may finish explaining.


Well, it's because… it's because your name is a little shorter than hers is.

Holo:
Aah?

Lawrence:
On top of that, even if I had said Nora quickly, you'd know for sure, right?
I mean, come on, the name Holo goes so fast.
In that split second you wouldn't have heard me, if you were angry.
So there, don't you think that's a pretty good explanation?

Holo:
No! Not a bit!
Are you seriously telling me you only called my name, because it was a little shorter?
What upsets me more than anything is that you actually think this way, idiot!
Ugh! I wish you would have just told me you called her name.
Moron! What is wrong with you?
Try again. But this is your last chance. Lawrence, please just say one name.


Lawrence:
Holo.

Holo:
Huh?


Yeah, I like that name better after all.

Holo:
Idiot!


Holo:
Oh, yes. Well, I should clear up the false accusation for him.

Nora:
What?

Holo:
Your companion was never in love with me.
He just knew what I was; that is all.

Nora:
So you knew who she was then.

Holo:
You have a very good partner.
Trust me; this one here is more trouble than he is worth.

Lawrence:
Oh, really?

Nora:
Well then, I wish the both of you much happiness.
