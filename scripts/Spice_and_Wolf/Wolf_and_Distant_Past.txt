Holo:
Just look at my ears and tail. Can you not tell that I am a very proud wolf?
Not only can my ears hear disaster, they can detect lies.
Many have been helped with their ability.
In fact, I could not even count the number I have saved.
When people speak of Holo the wise wolf, they are referring to none other than me.

I really hate fleas.

Lawrence:
Yeah, well, you do have a fine coat of fur.

Holo:
Thank you. I like that you appreciate my tail. You must be a very good judge of character.

Lawrence:
Yeah, we would say that.

Holo:
Oh, you shall get a bath as well. But it will start with the top of your head.

Monk:
We should thank God for our meeting today.
Thank you. Please come in. Who's this?

Lawrence:
My... wife. She has some bad burns on the face.

Monk:
Oh, I see.

Lawrence:
Let me take care of our drenched goods and then I'll come inside.

Lawrence:
It's raining pretty hard out there.

Holo:
Yes. But it feels so cooling on my burns.

Lawrence:
Holo, what should I do about the wheat?

Holo:
What do you mean, what should you do?

Lawrence:
It's just I don’t know if I should thresh it or not.
I feel like I should leave it alone.
Well, that's if what you say is true, if you really do dwell within the wheat.

Holo:
As long as I am alive, what you do to the wheat does not matter.
It will not go bad or wither away.
Now, if it should be consumed or become kindling or should it be ground down and mixed in with the soil
I shall likely disappear, but threshing will not be a problem.

Lawrence:
Then I'll put the grains in a bag after I thresh it and you can hang on to it.
I figure you want it with you.

Holo:
I do. Would it be possible for me to wear it around my neck?

Lawrence:
Your neck?

Holo:
Mmhmm.

Lawrence:
Can--can I keep some?
I was thinking it would be nice to find newer markets for wheat.

Holo:
Crops from certain places grow well, because that is where they belong.
It would only wither elsewhere.
Trust me. You would be wasting your time.
The frame was a waste, too. (frame: the human body, or the figure)
You may have gotten soaked to without it. Yet still, you stink.

Lawrence:
Hey!

Holo:
I believe you to be a decent enough looking man.
Why do you not take care of yourself better?

Lawrence:
Excuse me, but it doesn't seem to be affecting my business.

Holo:
That may be due to your beard. It does look nice on you.

Lawrence:
Hmm, so there is something about me you like.

Holo:
But I think it will look better, if you wear it a little longer.
If the whiskers were different..
Maybe something like this.
Lawrence the wolf. That would be funny.

Lawrence:
There're people around there, so please try to act normal.

Holo:
I am Holo the wise wolf. I have been traveling in this form for a long time.
Do not worry about me. Although I would've never thought to hide my face.
Not because of a burn.
It is an interesting notion however.

Lawrence:
Oh, what would you think it were for real?

Holo:
Well, such a burn would be proof of myself, as my ears and tail are.
I would think this is the face which belongs to none other than me

Lawrence:
Hmm, I guess that's true.


 Noble man:
I see, so you came from Yorenz then.

Lawrence:
Yes, I picked up salt there and got some of their best marten for an exchange.
It was really a nice deal actually.

Noble man:
Right, but it seems to me like it would be a pain to go back to Yorenz from here.

Lawrence:
That's the beauty of it. I don't have to go back.

Noble man:
You don't? Why not?

Lawrence:
When I purchased salt from a trading company in Yorenz, I didn't initially pay for it there.
I had actually sold some wheat in a different town to a branch of the same company where I got the salt.
The transaction was that instead of receiving a payment for the wheat, I didn't have to pay for the salt.
In other words two separate sales transactions were completed without exchanging any money.

Noble man:
Nice, very unusual!

Lawrence:
It's a system we like to call exchange transactions which was invented by merchants who were dealing with people in several different locations.

Noble man:
I own a vinery in town not far from here, called Perenzzo.
I'd never considered paying my business transactions in this way.
Should I be learning this technique, too?

Lawrence:
No, I think you are fine.
This is simply a way for us to avoid the risk of having all of our money stolen while we are traveling back and forth.
If you are a lord who owns a vinery, all you have to be careful of is not letting the traders get your price too low.

Noble man:
That's true. I end up fighting with them about it every year.

Lawrence:
I feel for you.

Noble man:
Craft Lawrence, is that right?
When you come to the Perenzzo area next time, by all means you have to stop by my house. We will welcome you.

Lawrence:
Yes, thank you.

Noble man:
Now, we should probably go. My wife seems to be tired.

Lawrence:
Well, then.
I hope that God will bring us together again.


 Zheren:
Mister, you're really good.

Lawrence:
I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm just a merchant.

Zheren:
Yeah, right, I had my eye on that couple, too. I couldn't get anywhere close to them.
But you, Mr. Just a Merchant, you made it look so easy.
Tell me something. How did you do it?

Lawrence:
When I first started, all the peddlers looked like monsters to me.
Funny thing, most of 'em are actually still monsters. You gotta try harder.

Zheren:
Thanks, it's nice to know somebody understands how I feel.
Hey, it's nice to meet you. My name is Zheren.

Lawrence:
I'm Lawrence.

Zheren:
And I'm a rookie, in case you hadn't noticed
So I'm guessing this is your wife?

Lawrence:
Yes, Holo.

Zheren:
You don’t normally see a peddler with a wife.
Why is she all covered up?
What? Don't you think she's pretty enough to be seen by other people?

Lawrence:
No, that's not it at all.

Zheren:
Meeting you today has to be the will of God.
And because of that, I think you should let me take a look at her.

Lawrence:
What?

Holo:
A trip is the most fun before one sets out on it.
With dogs, the bark and not the bite is more frightening.
And women are almost always prettier when they are shrouded in mystery.
I could never be as pretty as you imagine, and I would never do something like that to you.
Would it not be better to imagine?

Zheren:
Um, oh, yeah, you have a pretty good point there.

Lawrence:
She does have a way of putting things into perspective sometimes.

Zheren:
I think it could only be heaven's guidance that would've led me to the two of you,
So knowing that, do you think you might be willing to listen to me about an amazing opportunity?


Holo:
Wow, that smells nice! Mmm, baked potatoes. With what?
Oh, is that goat cheese? Oh!

Lawrence:
Hold on a sec.

 Holo:
Why?
Is this the wheat?

Lawrence:
It is. And I put a leather string on it, so you can hang it around your neck.

Holo:
Thank you.
But forget about the wheat right now. Food comes first!

Lawrence:
Hold on a sec.

Holo:
What?

Lawrence:
There's the leather string and the bag.
And don’t forget. I got the cheese as a treat so I had to donate a lot of money to the church.
You'd better be ready when I bill you!

Holo:
Are you finished or did you have something else?

Lawrence:
Um...,no.

Holo:
I already know all those things.
Vegetables grown by humans taste better than leaf buds.
I also like the idea of cooking them.

Lawrence:
Don't eat them all at once.

Holo:
That was frightening! I find human throats to be very narrow. It is vexing!

Lawrence:
Yeah, um, get used to chewing.

Holo:
Well, so you know wolves do not have any cheeks. We can not take time to chew.

Lawrence:
I can tell.

Holo:
It has been a long time since I have choked but I remember doing so on a potato.
Perhaps I do not do so well with this vegetable.
Stupid potato!

Part B ***Lawrence:
Holo, can you really tell if someone is lying to you?

Holo:
Lying? Yes, basically.

Lawrence:
But to what extent?

Holo:
Well, to the extent that I could know this:
You praised my tail, but for some reason you did not mean it.
However, you realize I can not be correct at all times.
In the end, whether or not you believe me is your decision.

Lawrence:
But say I believe you, what do you think about that kid?

Holo:
What kid?

Lawrence:
The one who talked to us in front of the fireplace.

Holo:
Oh, him! Yes, but from my point of view, you are both kids.
Do not worry. I believe you are a bit more mature.
You wish to know if the story he told was truth. Is that it?

Zheren:
Let me get to the point here.  (Let me get to the point: はっきり言います)
There is a certain silver coin that's currently being circulated.
Word has it, there's a newer coin coming soon. And it's supposed to contain more silver.

 Lawrence:
Really?

Zheren:
Something told me that wouldn't surprise you.
When you exchange it for another country's currency, the silver coins will be worth more to you.
So in other words...

Lawrence:
In other words, if you begin collecting silver coins now and exchange them when the new ones become available you will then be able to make a fairly impressive profit on the difference.

Zheren:
What do you say?
I can tell you which silver coins are going to change.
And in return, when you make your big profit, I wouldn't mind if you share a little bit of it with me.

Holo:
I do not know all the details, but it is most definitely a lie.

Lawrence:
Currency speculation is pretty common actually. But...

Holo:
You seem to be unsure as to why he is lying. True?
When a person lies, what is important is not the lie itself; no, it is their reason, their why.

Lawrence:
Yeah, do you have any idea at all how long it took me to figure that out?

Holo:
You do not have to let it bother you. After all you are still a kid.
At any rate, what would you have done had I not been here to tell you this?

Lawrence:
I would have held off on deciding whether or not it was true, most likely.
I would have acted like I was gonna go along with his proposal.

Holo:
Why would you do that?

Lawrence:
If it is true, I can just go along with the idea of making a profit. I'm not out anything.
If it's a lie, that means someone's up to something. 
So if I quietly investigate, I'll be able to find out what's behind the whole scheme.

Holo:
And nothing will change now that I told you it is a lie, correct?
You would not have hesitated from the beginning.
Either way, you would most assuredly pretend to go along with him.
Do not forget that I am Holo.
Remember how much longer than you I have had this life.


 Lawrence:
What is she doing?

Holo:
I shall pray for my husband's strength. May he have more pluck.

Lawrence:
More pluck?

Holo:
'Tis odd. I cannot believe how important they have become.

Lawrence:
Churches have always been important.

Holo:
Not so. Around the time I came down from the north, they were not so weighty.
At least they did not exaggerate their story.
Really, one true god did everything and the humans are merely borrowing it.
Nature is not a thing which can be created by someone.
I have been wondering, when exactly did churches begin handling comedies?
Do you know?

Lawrence:
That's enough for now.

Holo:
It must have to do with the changing times.
At this rate, we can not prevent it.

Lawrence:
Have you changed this much, Holo?
Then I'm willing to bet your home won't have changed either.

Holo:
Being comforted by you is rather disgraceful for this wise wolf.

Holo:
Hey! Are you coming? What are you doing?

Zheren:
Really? You wanna do business with me?

Lawrence:
Yes. But I can't pay you upfront.
I won't be able to do much, until I cash in the fur.

Zheren:
Then let's meet up again at the port town of Pazzio.
Once you're in town, ask about the bar, Yorrend.
And we'll go from there.
Things will be set up, so you'll be able to get into contact with me.

Lawrence:
Sound good. It's Yorrend, right?

Zheren:
Yes, Yorrend. That's it. Okay, I'm going on ahead.
I'll be seeing the two of you soon!

Holo:
He is a very noisy man. Why are we not going with him?

Lawrence:
The road's too muddy right now. Walking will be faster for him.
There's no reason to make him ride with us.

Holo:
Is it true, merchants are particular about time?

Lawrence:
Time is money. So, yes.

Holo:
I have never heard that. "Time is money."

Lawrence:
It means if you have time, you can use it to make money.
Think about it. I bet those farmers you've seen for all these years were pretty punctual.

Holo:
What is your basis for that comparison?
Those famers were not concerned with being on time. They were following their senses.

Lawrence:
I don't understand.

Holo:
Think of it like this.
They awaken when they sense daylight and pull weeds when they sense the afternoon.
They rejoice in buds spouting when they sense it is spring.
And they enjoy crops growing when it becomes summer.
Celebrate the harvest when they sense fall.
And await the spring when they sense winter.
They do not care about time.
And neither do I.
You only lack the experience but you will get there.

Shall I put it another way?

Lawrence:
Hmm?

Holo:
I mean to say you will become nicely established when you get older.

Lawrence:
How many hundreds of years ahead of me are you?

Holo:
Do you see what I mean? You have a very sharp wit!

Lawrence:
I don't know. I think that might be all you. Your brain is so old that it's starting to break down.

Lawrence:
Hmm?

Holo:
Let me ask you something. Do you know why we wolves attack humans when they travel in the mountains?

Lawrence:
No.

Holo:
It is violent.
We do like to eat their heads, but it is only because we want to obtain their power.
You are just a fledgling, no match for me.
Now have you ever been attacked in the forest?

Silence. I can assume then your answer must be yes.

Lawrence:
Yeah, at least eight times.

Holo:
And they were formidable?

Lawrence:
Yes. We somehow made it through a band of wild dogs.
But, wolves were different.

Holo:
Do you know why? It's likely the wolves had eaten humans before and had gained their power.

Lawrence:
Will you stop it?
Look, I'm sorry if I insulted you. Just please stop! Please, stop talking.

Holo:
Oh... yes.

Are you angry?

Lawrence:
Yes, I am.
Don't say anything like that ever again.

Holo:
Wolves have only lived in forests. Dogs, however, have spent time with humans.
That is the difference. That is why the wolves are more formidable.
Wolves only know about being hunted by humans.
Humans are something to be feared. That is why we attack.
We feel as if we have no other choice.
The forest must be safe.

Lawrence:
Have you attacked?

Holo:
There are things even I refuse to answer. I ask you to understand.

Lawrence:
Sorry.

Holo:
And now we are even.


Holo:
We live in two worlds... and they are very different from one another
