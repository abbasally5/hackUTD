Marlheit:
So, she's a wolf?
If that's the case, then this is a warning form Medio Trading.
They're telling you not to do anything until the deal is completed, unless you want your companion taken to the church.

Lawrence:
But still, how can we know they won't take her to the church afterwards anyway?

Marlheit:
And let's not forget we've already invested a great deal in devaluing Trenni silver coins.
If we back off now, we'll lose all of it.

Lawrence:
Then we need to be aggressive!

Marlheit:
Suppose we rescue your companion and agree to provide her shelter.
If we are reported to the church, there will be no more options available.
Like obedient sheep, we'll simply have to do what we're told.
As long as she stays in this town, we can't hide her.

Lawrence:
Then I'll get her out of the town and we'll run.

Marlheit:
Unless you are extremely lucky, you'll be caught.
She'll only end up being taken to another town and reported to the church there.
Once that happens, there's nothing we can do.

Lawrence:
What if we take into account of profit they're going to make? We might still be able to solve this thing with money.
If only we had a trump card we could counter with.

Marlheit:
There is one way.
We'll report that Medio Trading has your companion with them before they do, which would redirect the focus onto them.
But if we choose to sacrifice your friend, I'm sure you'll be less than supportive.
You might even take the initiative and testify against us.

Lawrence:
You can count on it.
What's the benefit in having the silver coins?
It must be some sort of privilege obtained from the King of Trenni, right?

Marlheit:
According to our investigation, the royal family's purse strings are increasingly tight

Lawrence:
They'd have to be. The royal family is trying to temporally gather and melt the silver coins currently in circulation.
The idea is that if 10 of their silver coins can be made into 13 by reducing the purity, they have made a profit.
For now they can generate the funds needed, but at the same time the country loses credibility.
If you ask m,e the long-time disadvantage is far greater than the temporary increase in funds.
Yet they've taken it upon themselves to do it anyway, the Trenni Kingdom must be in severe financial difficulty, which means that depending upon the agreement, you could get plenty out of them.
It's amazing. We're talking minting rights, the rights to set tariff rates, manage complete markets--anything.

Marlheit:
That's exactly right.

Lawrence:
But I think I might have an idea.
Before Medio Trading reports her, complete your negotiations on the Trenni silver coins.
Use that profit as the trump card to bargain with them!
But selling privilege for Holo might not be worth it to you.

Marlheit:
You mean we have them buy the privilege back?

Lawrence:
If we make them think buying it is more profitable than shutting you down, I'm willing to bet that they'll go ahead and pay.

Marlheit:
Don't forget they have their own trump card that could send every single one of us to the stake.

Lawrence:
Not true. If Trenni gets in trouble with the church the country can't win.
Trenni Kingdom wouldn't want their public to know they were connected with you, not a company sent to the stake.

Marlheit
If we received any unwanted attention from the church, the king would suffer because of his interaction with us.

Lawrence
Medio Trading would never make an accusation that would only anger the King in return.

Marlheit
I see.
But still, they won't be able to back off of this quietly.

Lawrence
They'd be forced to take you down with them.

Marlheit
So we hand over the privilege in exchange for reasonable compensation and releasing your companion.

Lawrence
Yes, exactly.

Marlheit:
Well, it's fine methodology. However, we still have one major problem.

Lawrence
That's where you're wrong.
As far as I can tell, Medio Trading hasn't gathered that many coins yet.

Marlheit
Based on...?

Lawrence
Based on, if they'd already had enough silver coins, they wouldn't have just taken Holo, they'd have gone directly to the church.
But they didn't. They just tried to block our move instead.
Hardly seems to me like they're confident in their plan.
This deal takes advantage of the King.
I can't imagine they've made a big show of purchasing coins.

Marlheit
What about you? It seems I have a plan, but what are you going to do?

Lawrence
I'll get Holo back. We can stay on the run until you finish the negotiations.

Marlheit
It's reckless!

Lawrence
We may eventually get caught, but I think I can buy us some extra time.
In the meantime, gather as many silver coins as you can and finish the deal.

Marlheit
I can't do it.

Lawrence
So then do you intend to report Holo?
If that happens, I will testify against you.
All we need is a little help.
We can manage for at least a day or two.
You have to remember that I'm running with the incarnation of a wolf beside me.
Even if she ends up getting captured, humans are no match for her, not if she's using her natural abilities.
Trust me on this.
Let me ask you a question.
How much time will you need to gather enough coins to talk to the King?

Marlheit
If we leave by horse for Trenni Castle right now, we'll get there by sunset. And then if the deal's made on the spot, we could be back by morning.

Lawrence
Right now? But you haven't even figured out how many silver coins you're going to need to collect yet.

Marlheit
We'll simply work it out based on an estimate. And when it comes time for a delivery, we'll have it all for them.

Lawrence
Okay, but do you think you'll be able to negotiate with the King on the spot?

Marlheit
I certainly don't want to brag, but if we want to, we can make any deal on the spot.

Lawrence
So then, you have to tell me--do you know where they're hiding Holo?

Marlheit
We are Milone Trading after all.
Our employees are attacked at night. Our shops are set on fire.

Man:
Hey.

Marlheit
These are everyday things for us.

Man:
See ya.

Marlheit
Our emergency measures have to be, and are, perfect, although we do have one rival.

Lawrence
The church.

Marlheit
That is correct.
They visit more countries and cities than we could or would want to visit.
So they are surprisingly well prepared for emergencies themselves.
If the church decides to make a concerted effort to find her, she'll have no choice but to confine herself instead of carelessly running away.

Under normal circumstances I would have preferred to negotiate after finding out who's behind Medio Trading.
We could find out who's behind their financing and take it from them.
It really is a shame we don't know that benefactor.

Lawrence
I wouldn't even know where to start.

Marlheit
Be careful. I know you'll be successful.

Lawrence
I'll try to live up to your expectations.

Marlheit
Oh, and the password: Pireon and Numai.
Remember them.

Lawrence
We're using two gold coins?

Marlheit
What else would we use?

Lawrence
Once I'm underground, I go forward while touching the wall on the right.
Is that it?

Marlheit's man:
Yes. When you get to the end of the passage, just stay there and wait.

Lawrence
And the warehouse above that is where they're holding Holo, so I stay there until the market's opening bell rings.
And that's when your people will go in and save her.

Marlheit's assistant:
If all goes well, someone will be there to open the cover above you and lower your companion.
After that listen very carefully, if you hear the word "Rahhe" wait for my colleague, if you hear "Perouso", then escape with her via the planned path immediately.

Lawrence
Rahhe and Perouso, periods of economic boom or decline.

Marlheit's assistant:
We'd like to keep it simple.

Lawrence
Clearly.

Marlheit's man:
Okay, it's almost time.

Coachman:
You idiot, watch where you're going!

Man:
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

Marlheit's assistant:
Go! It's now or never.

Lawrence
I had no idea they'd be this prepared.
I've often heard the churches dig underground passages for espionage and tax evasion, while at the same time making it look to the general public as if they're digging graves.
This is it!

Man:
Come on out. I have orders to move you.

Lawrence
It's happening now.
God, I hope they can get her out okay.
Damn it! Why can't I stop shaking? What's taking so long? Come on!

Part B

Man:
Rahhe... Rahhe!

Lawrence:
Numai!

Man:
Pireon.

Lawrence:
Holo!

Holo:
So I have to take this with me, so they think it was a burglary?

Lawrence:
Come on, let's go!

Holo:
I cannot, until you get out of my way. Please move.
Do not just stand there! Here, these are for you. Take them and try moving.

Chloe:
Yes!

Marlheit's assistant:
Pireon.

Lawrence
Numai.

Marlheit's assistant:
Looks like everything went well.

Marlheit's assistant:
Surprises are a part of this business, right?

Lawrence:
Are we leaving him?

Marlheit's man:
He'll come up at another location. Plus, someone has to get rid of that ladder.
After that I'm sure he'll wanna leave town, since he's giving the information he has on Medio to Marlheit.

Lawrence:
Thank you for everything.

Marlheit's man:
I hope you two make it.

Lawrence:
Yeah, so do I.
I'm glad you're okay.

Holo:
You are glad I am okay, really?

Lawrence:
Yeah...

Holo:
Say my name then!

Lawrence:
Holo ... Holo!

Holo:
Call me Holo the wise wolf!

Lawrence:
Er ... wise, yes.

Holo:
And you would do well to remember it; I can name everyone who has ever embarrassed me and now I have to add one more to that list.
You are probably wondering what name to which I am referring.
'Tis your name!

Lawrence:
"Lawrence"?

Holo:
What were you doing all that time!? I expected you to come and rescue me!

Lawrence:
Yes, and I did!

Holo:
I know but you should still ..
You were supposed to have come for me much sooner!
I cannot talk, I am too angry!

Lawrence:
Holo, what happened?

Holo:
You are a male; it should have been natural for you to come and rescue me immediately!
I thought I would be down there forever.
You have no idea how humiliating that was!

Lawrence:
But you are okay, am I right?
I'm glad you're okay.

Holo:
As long as you have that wheat, I shall not die; there is no need to be worried.
I am pretty, so human males have been known to fall for me.
Some would be wise to remember I am too strong for a human.
I am a wolf, you know.
I did warn them: "Touch me and I will tear your thing off!"
And--can you believe?--not one of them did.

Lawrence:
Good for you.

Holo:
I was fine... until that person appeared.
You may well be surprised by who it is.
I know I was.

Lawrence:
Who was it then?

Holo:
Chloe--the one from Pasloei.
Before I escaped she told me that young man Zheren was the one who gave her my name.

Lawrence:
What did she say?

Chloe:
I really thought it was just an old story.

Holo:
She was not kind.

Chloe:
An incarnation of the wolf who lives in the village's wheat fields and can freely control whether the harvest is rich or poor.

Holo:
It is funny--I do not know how many years have passed since I began living there.
It could be one year for each hair on my tail.
I am Holo the wise wolf.
In order to have rich harvests more often, I sometimes made a poor harvest to recover the fields.
It was always under my supervision.
Yet even with those poor harvests, I am sure their village was a much better place to grow wheat than other lands.
It is true the villagers treated me as if I were a god of rich harvests, but they did not do so out of respect. They simply wanted to keep me there.
The one who harvests the last gets captured by everyone and has to pretend to be me, correct?
Do you have any idea what that woman said to me?
She said... once she heard my name from Zheren, she hoped it might be true.
I was... I was... and I was happy when she told me this.
However, she was hardly finished with me.

Chloe:
Didn't you know? The days of us spending our time appeasing you are over now.
We no longer need to be nervous about your impulsiveness.
And when we turn you over to the church, we will finally bid farewell to a god who does not care. (bid farewell to:～に別れを告げる)

Holo:
I felt... I felt... such shame!

Lawrence
Y'know, I think you're looking it at the wrong way.
If you want to go back up north, you're going to have to leave the land eventually.
So, it doesn't upset them to see you leave.
Don't you see there's a kind of freedom in that? You're not bound to the land anymore.
But at the same time, we're not leaving for nothing. Because I, no, we are both of us merchants.
And I'll promise you one thing: "We will not laugh until we get the money; we will not cry until we go bankrupt."
And guess what? We are going to laugh.

Holo:
Ahh! Thank you. However... (punches Lawrence)
I have had few conversations in the past several hundred years, so I've become emotionally delicate.
It may be true that I have cried in front of you twice now, but I would have cried even if it was not you. Do you understand what I am saying?

Lawrence:
That I'm your favorite?

Holo:
Wrong.

Lawrence:
If it makes you feel any better, I'm taking care of you for the money.
My job is to keep running until Milone contacts us.
You can't keep crying at the drop of a hat.　 [at the drop of a hat: (ちょっとしたきっかけで)すぐに)]
Although if you did, I'd still be there, if only for the money.
So even if it was someone else that was doing the crying, I'd've...
Stop it! That isn't fair!

Holo:
I am the favorite.

Coachman:
Hey, you two! We've arrived.
I certainly hope you've come to an understanding.

Lawrence:
Yeah...
I know the person who's behind Medio Trading. His name is Earl Ehrendott.
The merchant that's been dealing wheat in the Earl's territory is the one who's collecting the silver coins in a large quantity.
Please pass this information along to Marlheit.

Man:
I'll tell him myself.

Coachman:
No surprise. Seems those who bring money-making ideas are always a little different.

Holo:
You mean my ears?

Coachman:
Watching you two reminds me of the old days.
I used to be a peddler too.

Lawrence
You'd be better careful... or you might just end up with someone like her.

Coachman:
Really! Well, the coach's seat is too big for one person.
I'll have to start praying for your luck.

Holo:
Maybe if I had ended up with him, I would not be in such a mess.

Lawrence:
Not fair. I just won't talk.

Holo:
I think you're developing a crush on me.

Lawrence:
All right, you are pretty cute, I'll give you that much.

Holo:
I'm glad.
And for a kid, you're pretty cute yourself.

Lawrence:
Geez!
