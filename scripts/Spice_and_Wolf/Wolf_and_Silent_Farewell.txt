Lawrence:
What's wrong?

Holo:
The air. I can feel it beginning to shake.

Lawrence:
We should be right underneath the market; do you think that might be it?

Holo:
No, it is something else. Hold on.
Water. I can hear it splashing.

Lawrence:
What direction?

Holo:
Ahead of us. We need to run!
Does this passage not fork anywhere?

Lawrence:
Not the way we were headed, but there're a series of side roads up ahead!

Holo:
I do not think even I can keep us from getting lost in here.

Lawrence:
What is it?

Holo:
Even if we run, they will catch up.
It seems they have released the dogs.

Lawrence:
The dogs?

Holo:
Their voices sound stupid.
You should cover your ears now. Trust me.


Chaser:
What the hell is that?

Holo:
I could really use some apples.　　　　　　　　　　　（could use: ~があれば有難い）

Lawrence:
Once we're out of here, I'll get you some.

Holo:
How did they find out where we were?

Lawrence:
They most likely didn't know we were here. They probably came underground and found us by accident.
Otherwise we would have been attacked already!

Chaser:
Milone Trading betrayed you both! Give up now!
There's no use running from us!

Holo:
Is that true? Did they betray us?

Lawrence:
If so, we were sold for a high price.
After all, I could shut down Milone's branch, if they had you.

Holo:
Really? It must have been high indeed.

Lawrence:
They're just formally greeting us.
Don't worry, it's a lie.
Let's turn here!

Chasers:
Hey, I found them!
There they are! That way!

Holo:
Do you know where we are going?

Lawrence:
Yes, of course!
We'll make the next right!

Holo:
No!

Lawrence:
Sorry, but we're in a hurry.

Holo:
Lawrence, no!

Chaser:
Father, I ask you to forgive me of my sins.

Lawrence:
Before you ask forgiveness, you should try repenting how you live!
Damn it! He stabbed me...

Holo:
Lawrence!

Holo:
Oh, thank goodness.
I, I could not wake you up.

Lawrence:
...I'm all right. I'm only resting. That's all.

Holo:
Please stay strong; we are almost there.

Lawrence:
Where?

Holo:
Did you not listen to what I was saying?
I told you I smelled light and asked if there was a place that led above.

Lawrence:
That's right. Yeah, I remember.
What's this?

Holo:
A bandage! Do not tell me you forgot about that already!

Lawrence:
Well, I am all right. Don't worry.

Holo:
We are getting close.
Now, we should find an exit just at the other end of this passageway. Look!
Oh, no!

Lawrence:
An old well.

Holo:
Lawrence, I am sorry. I did not foresee this.

Chasers:
There they are!

Lawrence:
Stay back!

Holo:
No! Wait! Stop it! You cannot!

Lawrence:
I don’t have a choice.

Holo:
You cannot! Even if I were not Holo the wise wolf, I could tell this.

Chloe:
From the description they gave me, I thought it might be you.
I was hoping it would not be, though. It's a shame.

Lawrence:
The one behind Medio Trading is Earl Ehrendott, isn't it?
He is trading in wheat, Pasloei's harvest and when you deal with wheat you can request payment in any silver coin you prefer.
On top of that the privilege of eliminating the wheat tariff will be more than a blessing to Medio Treading, the Earl and the Pasloe villagers.
You are the one personally acquainted with the merchants who come specifically for wheat and more deals are carried out after the harvest festival than any other time.
The village mayor was putting you in charge of the entire thing.　It's been you all alone.

Chloe:
Well, I think we should catch up later. We don't have time now.

Lawrence:
Don't be so cold. After all I barely got to see you while I was in the village.

Chloe:
Lucky for you, you found someone else to occupy your time.
Give her to us, Lawrence.
We are going to turn her into the church and bid farewell to the days of Holo the wise and faithless wolf.
Once we give her over to them, we can shut down Milone Trading.
Additionally, if we can use the King's privilege to eliminate the tariff, our wheat will produce an enormous profit for us, and it will be the same for the merchants who handle our wheat.
Lawrence, you chose to purchase wheat from our village while we were still suffering under that tariff.
I want you to know I still I appreciate everything you did.
We would certainly give you preferential treatment, if you continue to do business with us.
Lawrence, this is our opportunity--we could open that shop, you and I.
Think of the profit we can make together. Come with me.

Lawrence:
With you? Opening a shop has been my dream for a long time.

Chloe:
Yes, I know!

Lawrence:
But what kind of merchant would I be if I couldn't keep a simple promise?
I'm not sure what I did to deserve this turn of events, but I just happened to meet a strange wolf.
She wants to return to the north and I made a contract to accompany her.
I cannot break that contract; I gave my word.

Holo:
Yes!

Chloe:
I did not want to say goodbye to you.

Lawrence:
Such is a merchant's life, is it not?

Chloe:
You can kill the man. Just make sure you capture the girl alive.

Lawrence:
I'm not dead yet!
Holo! Get the knife!

Holo:
That is enough! This might hurt a little. You must bear it

Chloe:
No! Stop hesitating! She is simply a girl who is possessed by the Devil!

Holo:
Look away... I do not want you to see me like this.

Chloe:
All gods are... the same! Unfair! You're cruel, every one of you!

Lawrence:
Holo, please don't!
Wait, Holo! Holo!
You, you tore all of my good clothes; do you know how much those cost?
I don't care if you're a god or not, you'll have to pay for them!
You may have earned 50 silver coins, but that's not going to be nearly enough at all!
Don't you try to get out of it either!
I will follow you!
Holo! I will follow you all the way to the north! Holo!


Marlheit:
It's nice to see you're awake.
Your injury isn't causing you too much pain, I hope.

Lawrence:
No, it's... it's fine. Thanks.

Marlheit:
We'd like to apologize to you, Lawrence.
We miscalculated the situation

Lawrence:
Oh, thank you. But I don't think anyone could have seen that coming.

Marlheit:
We were very fortunate all the commotion occurred underground though.
If people had witnessed her true form, they would have probably thrown our headquarters into the fire.

Lawrence:
You saw her true form?

Marlheit:
I did. I received a report from my employees stating that they had found you, but that a giant wolf had refused to hand you over to anyone other than myself.

Lawrence:
So where is she then? Where did she go?

Marlheit:
Once we brought you here, she left without telling us where she was going.

Lawrence:
Without even saying goodbye...
Well, did everything at least go as planned with the King?

Marlheit:
We were successful, of course, and acquired the privilege before Medio Trading could ask for it

Lawrence:
You've gotta be kidding me.

Marlheit:
We collected 307,112 coins and it seems the King will devaluate the silver coins rather dramatically.
He said he would give us cash worth 350,000 silver coins to be paid at the time of delivery.

Lawrence:
Three hundred fifty thousand!

Marlheit:
And according to the contract we made with you, your share is to be five percent of our profit. That is correct, isn't it?

Lawrence:
Yeah, that was the deal.

Marlheit:
Please, look this over.

Lawrence:
What is this?

Marlheit:
You will receive 120 silver coins, which is five percent of our profit.

Lawrence:
That's all? I'm sorry, I don't understand.

Marlheit:
There is a delivery cost of the coins we collected, then the tariff that comes along with it, not to mention the handling fee for the contract itself.

Lawrence:
I never would've believed it would cost this much just to handle a contract.

Marlheit:
Blame his government contractor for that.
Since they were also giving us the privilege, they were trying to get back their losses from purchasing the silver coins.
We weren't expecting this to happen.
It is an unfortunate result.

Lawrence:
I guess when it comes to business, you can't be prepared for everything.

Marlheit:
However, the unexpected can be good as well.
Medio really wanted that privilege.

Lawrence:
Wait, what?

Marlheit:
Remember, they were collecting the same silver coins we were.
They knew the silver coins would eventually be devalued so in the end they were going to be stuck with quite a bit of debt.
I imagine they were fairly determined to turn a profit no matter what.
So when we spoke with them, they suggested an amount that we were willing to accept on the spot.

Lawrence:
It's 1000 coins!

Marlheit:
Yes, congratulations.
Would you like to receive it in silver coins?
Or if you like, we could arrange for some of it to be given in product.

Lawrence:
Pepper. Pepper--it's light and easy to carry, and its price is about to go up.
People buy more meat in the winter, so naturally they'll want to buy more pepper as well.
What's so funny about that?

Marlheit:
Oh, I'm sorry, you reminded me of a play I read recently.

Lawrence:
What are you talking about?

Marlheit:
It's actually a religious play the church uses to preach rules to trading companies.
In it, the Devil appears to a very wealthy merchant.
It says to him, "Bring me the most delicious human in this land or I shall eat you instead."
Because he doesn't wish to perish, he brings young maids and a fat male servant, but the Devil does not accept them.
He searches all over town for delicious-looking people until he finally finds a boy who smells of honey and milk.
He presents this boy to the Devil immediately, but the boy says to the Devil, "The most delicious human in the entire world is right in front of you. Look, do you not see how delicious this merchant must be? He's seasoned his fat soul with the spices that made his fortune."
So when you asked for pepper, I saw an image of you getting fat and eaten by the Devil.

Lawrence:
Well, the sooner my soul can be seasoned with spices the better.

Marlheit:
Yes, definitely.

Marlheit:
And I'll pray for luck, naturally I want you to know our company would like to maintain the relationship we built with you.

Lawrence:
Thank you. I would as well.

Marlheit:
Good, good, I'm happy to hear it.
Hum, Lawrence, this is an invoice that has your name on it.

Lawrence:
I don't remember purchasing any of these products...
Where can I find the unloading area?

Marlheit:
Um, well, go down the hallway and take a right at the end.

Lawrence:
Thank you!
Watch out! Sorry!
A robe, a silk waist sash, a new pair of traveling shoes, a tortoiseshell comb ... and last ... plenty of apples!

Milon stuff
Your total is one 140 silver coins.

Lawrence:
Holo! 'Scuse me!

Holo:
I cannot have you coming all the way to the north to collect, do you understand?

Lawrence:
Geez!

Holo:
I shall not go home till I pay off my debt.

Lawrence:
You've got a deal.

Marlheit:
"Spice and wolf" seems fitting enough to me.
