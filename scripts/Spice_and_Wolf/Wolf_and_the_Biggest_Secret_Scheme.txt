Man:
I said "no"! Now get out!

Lawrence:
Please help. I'll take anything you can give me.
Thank you for your kindness.

Innkeeper:
Well, you're back early.

Lawrence:
I'm sorry.
Holo, I... I could only manage three Lumiones on my own. I'm 44 Lumiones short.
There's not much I can do about it now.
I thought maybe I could gamble with it and see what happen, but you probably have better luck than I would.
I suppose at this point it doesn't make a difference though.
I can afford to risk it.
I'm sure that adding three Lumiones back to my debt probably can't hurt me any more. Right?


Holo:
You idiot! Get back up here already!

Innkeeper:
Will you make a decision please?

Lawrence:
Sorry. I dropped this bag out of the window up there.

Innkeeper:
Yeah, right. I'm sure you did.


Holo:
You are an idiot!

Lawrence:
I'm sorry.

Holo:
Stop saying sorry.
Do you know what you are sorry for?
What would you do, if I had run off with all your money?

Lawrence:
I think that I would be okay with it.
After all, I won't be able to help you anymore anyway.
Perhaps you could use it to travel.

Holo:
Use it to travel?
Why can't you just be angry with me?
It is all my fault! Correct? It's my fault, otherwise I know they would have helped you.
This... is all ... my ... fault!

Lawrence:
I'm not angry with you, because you only came along to help!
I could never blame you for that!

Holo:
Again you are an idiot!

Lawrence:
Holo!

Holo:
You are terribly good-natured.

Lawrence:
What do you mean?

Holo:
You were wrong about me. I went with you out of my own selfishness.
It backfired so you could be angry about it, if you want.
But instead, you apologize to me for simply brushing up against my hand
You should not feel sorry.

Lawrence:
But I do feel sorry. I thought I had done something that I could never take back.
I thought you would never be able to forgive me.
I will do all that I can to make things right again, but I realize it still may never be enough.

Holo:
Lawrence, will you answer something for me?
Why is it that you have such a good nature?
I just cannot understand it.

Lawrence:
My personality? I don’t know.

Holo:
You really are rather dense! 　　　　　　　　　　　　　(dense:鈍感な)
Did you just tell me "your personality"?
An imbecile would have charmed me and said I was special or something, even if it was a lie!

Lawrence:
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm confused about what you want though.

Holo:
There are times you want to hear something.
It does not matter if it is a lie or not but you will eventually want to hit a person in his face if he takes too long to say it.
Guess where I stand?

Lawrence:
Um, the hitting?

Holo:
Unbelievable! I simply cannot believe you.
I am sure you find it inappropriate to tell me how you feel because of our situation.

Lawrence:
I'm appalled at myself actually.

Holo:
I would still enjoy hearing you say it to me though.
Shall we try it again?
A-Ahem! Tell me, why is it that you have such a good nature?

Lawrence:
Because you are very special to me, Holo.

Holo:
Oh, my goodness! What are we doing right now?

Lawrence:
Wait! You're the one who told me I had to tell you that.

Holo:
Well, it was wonderful practice for you, was it not?
But you realize … from now on you should just try to upset me.
Although I do very much appreciate your consideration
Do you not agree that we get so much more accomplished faster when we just argue about it?
Huh?

Lawrence:
Agreed. Yes.


Holo:
So how much exactly do you have in this little leather bag?

Lawrence:
I have three and two-sevenths Lumiones.

Holo:
Then there are still forty-three and five seventh left of the debt.
I have an idea. Do you want to hear it?

Lawrence:
What idea?

Holo:
Now, do not get your expectations up, but I think it might work.

Lawrence:
Seriously? What is it?

Holo:
Well then, this approach is out of the ordinary, which means what I have in mind right now they will never see coming.

Lawrence:
What is it?


 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:0:&lt;h3&gt; 

Holo:
Do not worry. I am right here.

Lawrence:
Yeah.

Lemerio:
You've already obtained my money? I heard you had something important to discuss.


Nora:
You really want me to take that road this time?

Priest:
The road is a bit rough, yes, but I know you can do it.
I have faith in God, and I believe He will protect you again, as He has before.

Nora:
You're right.
But haven't you heard about all the mercenaries terrorizing and murdering people along that road?

Priest:
Remember faith is what keeps you eternally safe. You must trust in God to protect you.

Nora:
We will.

Priest:
You are indeed quite an extraordinary shepherd, my Nora.
The church and I are proud of your steadfast commitment to our Lord.


Lemerio:
Smuggling? Are you serious?

Lawrence:
Do I look like I'm joking?

Lemerio:
How dare you waste my time!

Lawrence:
I realize there have probably been many people who've tried a smuggling method similar to this before, and I'm sure they were all caught.

Lemerio:
At least you're not completely ignorant.
Those on the verge of bankruptcy have a tendency to misunderstand a reckless plan as a perfect one.
You must think that I'm new at this!

Lawrence:
But what if, what if you could entrust the gold smuggling to a dependable, highly skilled person?

Lemerio:
If the person is that skilled, he'd be making enough money without taking the trouble to smuggle gold, wouldn't he? Your theory is empty.

Lawrence:
What would you say if I told you I knew someone who was very skilled but who didn't make very much money?

Lemerio:
I would say "I don't believe you in the least"　 Who could that be?

Lawrence:
Highly skilled and currently working in this town but poorly paid and even more importantly they're in need of money.
What's more, this person is, shall we say, dissatisfied with their employer.
To say they are unhappy would be an understatement.
Their employer is the church.
And clearly smuggling gold is an action that directly opposes its rulings.
If we imply this is not simply an opportunity to make money, but a small yet calculated revenge on the church, this person will definitely want to be involved.
And trust me. There is virtually no possibility of betrayal.
Once I tell you who this person is, I think you'll understand their position a little better.

Lemerio:
If what you say is true, why don't you carry out this scheme on your own?
You must want something from me; otherwise why tell me your plans, knowing you will have to share the profit?

Lawrence:
Repayment of my debt is due today.
As soon as the sun goes down, I'll be arrested by the trading house.
Unfortunately, this is all the money I have on me right now.
I want you to accept this as collateral.
You see, I'd like you to hold off on the collection of my debt.
and I also want you to provide me with the necessary funds to purchase the gold we'll be smuggling.

Holo:
Excuse me. Do you believe now is the best time to be hesitating?

Lemerio:
What do you mean?

Lawrence:
Holo!

Holo:
Interesting. I heard someone taking off just now.
My ears are especially sensitive; I can even hear whispering.
For example, the people downstairs are planning a strategy for running away.
Oh, another one left now. As it stands, I do not see how this trading house can last more than a couple of days.　
(as it stands: このままでは)

Lemerio:
Please, stop it!

Lawrence:
So, Lemerio, what do you think?
I assume you have the appropriate channels we can use to sell the smuggled gold
and you can trust me with that knowledge as well as my promise to make the conditions of the deal favorable to you.
I need an answer.

Lemerio:
All right! I'll do it. You have a deal.

Lawrence:
Good. May God overlook us in this endeavor.


Lemerio:
Get Leibert here, now!

Servant:
Yes, sir.


Holo:
I think now it must be my turn. Am I right?

Lawrence:
I don't know what you mean.

Holo:
You cannot possibly believe a good-natured person like you could deceive that little girl?

Lawrence:
There are actually a few innocent people in this world who simply like good-natured men, you know.

Holo:
You think you understand females so well; you do not.

Lawrence:
Listen to me, okay? Come on, you cornered him. Now, it's my turn.
I need to talk to her myself.
Remember I'm the one who was blinded by greed and ended up getting products whose value had collapsed in the market.
If I have you talk to just because I don't want to, then I'm pretty much hopeless.

Holo:
Oh well, I was hoping I could get you further and further into debt with me; then you would owe.

Lawrence:
Well, yeah, that was close then.


Lawrence:
Hello, Nora.

Nora:
Oh, Lawrence. Hi, Holo.

Lawrence:
Well, who would have guessed it?
We happened to run into you right here in front of the church; the only explanation has to be divine intervention.

Nora:
Even I won't fall for that story.

Lawrence:
Well, I think that might be because you've been drinking too much holy wine at Communion.

Nora:
I don’t really drink alcohol very much; that includes the wine as a sacrament too.
What's the … the truth?

Lawrence:
Right. I came here to request your service.

Nora:
Really? Is that so?

Lawrence:
We can't really talk about it in the open, so why don't we go to a street stall instead?

Nora:
Okay.

Lawrence:
Here's to our reunion!
Now then, you told me this before but can you really go to Lamtra?

Nora:
Yes, that's right, I can go there.

Lawrence:
But can you go there with sheep as well?

Nora:
If there's not too many of them, I can.

Lawrence:
All right. Then this time I'm gonna ask you to do something different.
Your pay: twenty--and I'm not talking about a worthless bond either.
I'll give you twenty gold Lumiones.
Watch it!

Nora:
I'm sorry. Um, did you say twenty... Lumiones?

Lawrence:
That's what I said but there is a risk, so the payment will be contingent upon our success.
If we fail, it'll be nothing.

Nora:
I see.

Lawrence:
What I'll need you to do is walk to Lamtra with your sheep and then just bring them back safely.
That's basically what it is. So I'm not really asking for anything more than for you to just be a good shepherd.

Nora:
I imagine this job must be very dangerous; otherwise you wouldn't be paying me so much.

Lawrence:
I won't deny that.
In fact, because of it, I won't insist that you join me.
I want you to take a minute to think about this.
The fee to join the association is one Lumione at the most, right?
If you have twenty, you can rent a house and work without having to worry about your immediate living expenses.
You'll probably be able to purchase a trusteeship too.
At that point you'll be the proud owner of Nora's Clothing Shop.
I'm wondering something. Were you wanting to join the tailors' association in this particular town?

Nora:
No. Actually I'd always planned on moving somewhere different.

Lawrence:
I see.

Lawrence:
But the size of this town is at least appealing, right?
Just think, Nora, it would be difficult to move to a town with no contacts.
Then again I guess you wouldn't want anything to do with the church in this town if possible either.

Nora:
No, you have it wrong.

Lawrence:
Nora, it seems to me the church does not at all appreciate the effort you go through to protect the sheep they entrust you with.
In fact the better you are, the more they suspect you of using pagan witchcraft.
You know that I am correct.
As a test they send you into areas other shepherds wouldn't go near and even know you know it's not true,
they tell you the safe territories are all being claimed already.
I'm willing to bet they'll keep on sending you into danger too, until you're attacked.
They want you to be attacked by wolves or mercenaries. They don’t' care.
And they'll keep sending you out, because they want to prove you are pagan.
I've seen it happen before.
If you ask me, the church here is worse than the Devil.
We figured that you could make a little money then we could leave this town.
But only after we make sure the church suffers!
You know we're the only ones you can count on.
I really believe we can help each other, Nora.
This is your way out. What do you think?

Nora:
Tell me. What are you planning?

Lawrence:
We are going to smuggle gold.

Nora:
What? Smuggle gold?
I don't understand. What do you think I can do?

Lawrence:
You can help us pass through this town's strict inspection, because the gold will be hidden within your sheep's bellies.

Nora:
Can I... would you mind telling me the whole plan?

Lawrence:
In any town influenced by the church gold fetches an exorbitant price.
So the most convenient place to make a wholesale purchase of gold will be a pagan village such as Lamtra.
But if we wanted to take the safest route from Lamtra, we'd have to take the main road, one which is entirely too busy.
On top of that, the area has been another shepherd's territory for a long time.

Nora:
But if it's me, I won't arouse any suspicion, even if I decide to go on a quiet road which very few people take.
And, of course I will decide on a road that is the shortest distance between here and Lamtra.

Lawrence:
Exactly.
Nora, you've been treated very poorly by this town's church.
This plan is a great chance for you to get back at them for being so cruel to you.
After all, the biggest source of their funds is the import and export of gold, along with so-called donations.
However if they find out, we'll be severely punished, and regardless we have to leave this town for our own safety after the work is completed.
Now you understand; that's why the compensation is so high.

Nora:
All right, Lawrence, I will do this for you.

Lawrence:
I look forward to working with you.

Nora:
Likewise.

Nora:
Um…

Lawrence:
What's wrong, Nora?

Nora:
Nothing. I just wanted you to know I wouldn't have taken this offer from anyone else.
I only said yes, because… because it was you.


Holo:
Are you not happy now? Things turned out well, did they not?

Lawrence:
But is the end worth it?

Holo:
Of course it is.

Lawrence:
The gamble's not worth our lives.
If what we're focusing on here is our financial gain, then we might as well call it fraud.
If you sign an unfavorable contract, you are the fool. That rule is common sense if you are a merchant.
But what about the person we're working with this time?
She's a poor shepherd girl who doesn't know her left from her right.

Holo:
It is true that little girl's smile at least looked innocent.
Seriously, you are more than hopelessly good-natured.
That little shepherd girl is not a mere sheep, you understand.
She exists for more than to be hunted.
No, in fact she is rather a bold sheep who decided on her own to jump into a pit of wild animals.
Consider this: she might just be a completely different animal who is hiding in sheep skin.
I do not wish to admit this, but she is a shepherd that even I acknowledged.
You are not so bad after all, but please try not to be so gullible.

Lawrence:
Well at this point it doesn't matter. We have a job to focus on now.
Hopefully we'll end up the ones laughing.

Holo:
Is that so?
Because I believe the idea of the two of us chuckling all by ourselves is the most appealing.

Lawrence:
I don't necessarily disagree, but I'll be far more relieved once we can all laugh together.

Holo:
You really are terribly good-natured.

Lawrence:
You don’t like it?

Holo:
You are silly.


Leibert
Master, you've got to be kidding me.
Are we really going through with this?

Lemerio:
We're going through with it. We have no choice.
Did you hear me, Leibert? We have no choice!
