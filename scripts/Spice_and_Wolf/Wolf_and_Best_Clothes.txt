  No one knows when the people of this village began to say "'the wolf is running" to describe the ripe wheat swaying in the wind. Whene'er the wind lays flat the ears of wheat, they become "trampled by the wolf." And should a poor harvest befall, the crops are "eaten by the wolf."

In the beginning, there was nothing. There was only warmth. And then, a promise was made.

The cycle of encounters and farewells continued with favor until one day humans came to achieve abundance on their own. And there was no need to be faithful to their promise anymore...

Lawrence:
I bet you're getting just as tired of these country roads as I am, right?

Cavalier:
A peddler?

Lawrence:
I am, yes. Actually I'm returning from a small mountain village half a day east of here. Lucky for me, they ended up buying my salt.

Cavalier:
Really. Is that it?

Lawrence:
No. These are all furs.

Cavalier:
Hmm... ?

Lawrence:
Yeah, that's just a bundle of wheat.
It's the kind which can sustain either hot or cold.
What's going on? Everyone seems a little overcautious.

Cavalier:
Not really. We've been told a village in the west is holding a pagan festival.

Lawrence:
Pagan festival?

Cavalier:
Yeah. It's a disgrace. They've refused to believe in the one true God.
You'd think the Holy Father would use his power over them.
If it were me they'd be crushed.
But it looks like he won't do anything.
I don't know, maybe he just pities the filthy and scheming.

Lawrence:
Pagans, huh?
So the people of Pasloei are pagans.

A:
Hahaha, who would have guessed it?

B:
I can't believe the new method led to such a rich harvest.

C:
We can't thank the Earl enough!

D:
Well, we couldn't just keep counting on the wolf.

E:
Hey, don't insult her. She's supposed to be a god, remember?

F:
Oh, hey, Lawrence!

Lawrence:
Hello. It's been a while, hasn't it?

F:
Well, you came at the right time.
Our harvest festival starts tomorrow.

Lawrence:
Tomorrow? I'm getting the impression that it's already started, right?

F:
Haha. Hahahaha. You're right. We started early. Care to join?

G:
Hey now, he didn't do any work, so why does he get to join us?

F:
You didn't do any work either!

Lawrence:
You wouldn't by chance know where I can find Chloe, would you?

F:
Chloe? Oh, I see. That's how it is.

Lawrence:
Not at all. She's a fellow merchant so I'd like to have a drink with her every once in a while.
We'd like to talk work.

F:
I have bad news for you.

Lawrence:
Huh?

F:
They'll be the last ones this year to finish harvesting, so Chloe will have to become Holo for the festival.

G:
Look everyone, I can see her hiding from us in the wheat!

H:
Who'll be the lucky one to catch the wolf? Who's it going to be?

Lawrence:
Chloe!

Chloe:
Lawrence!? When'd you get here?

Lawrence:
You'd better watch out, Holo's gonna get away!

I:
Finally, the last bundle.

J:
Come on, now. Don't keep all the wheat for yourself.

K:
You'd better be careful or Holo will escape.

I:
Who's gonna be the lucky one to catch the wolf?
It's Chloe! Chloe! Chloe!

Chloe:
Haa...
Hooooooooowl!

J:
Holo the wolf has appeared! Catch her! Catch her!

Chloe:
Hooooooooowl!

K:
She's heading over there.

L:
Lawrence! help us! Don't let her get away!

Chloe:
It's been a while so tonight it's gonna be your treat.

Lawrence:
What do you mean "Tonight is my treat"?
You'll be locked up in there for a week.

Village Mayor:
Thanks to you, we were finally able to find some new customers.

Lawrence:
I'm sure Chloe's a help to you now.
She has a talent for this business.

Village Mayor:
Yes, she is our price negotiator.
This village is not the same as it used to be.

Lawrence:
Whoa... Those are Trenni silver coins.
I haven't seen them in this area before.

Village Mayor:
Hahaha. Yes, I know.
We are bidding a farewell to the old rusty Lute silver coins.

Lawrence:
I suppose you will soon rival big towns like Pazzio.

Village Mayor:
Well, not yet.
But when we do, it'll be thanks to our new lord, Earl Ehrendott.
We will never have to pray to that wolf again.
Fortunately, we can now overcome the drought and the wind all by ourselves.
Forget about Trenni silver coins, I'd like to fill our village with Lumione gold coins.

Lawrence:
And when you do, I hope you continue to use my services.

Lawrence:
After all, an outsider would just be a nuisance.
On the other hand, "filling the village with Lumione gold" is a stretch.

Lawrence:
Time for bed, finally.

Lawrence:
What!? A girl?
Hey! Hey you!
Get up now! What are you doing in my wagon anyway!?
I said, get up!
Are those... ears?
A tail?

Holo:
Wow, what a beautiful moon.
You there, do you perchance have alcohol?

Lawrence:
No! I don't have any! Who are you!?

Holo:
Why not? Well then, do you carry any food?
Oh no... What a waste.

Lawrence:
Demon! Are you possessed by the Devil!?

Holo:
Ungrateful beast.
How dare you direct your blade at me!

Lawrence:
What? Ungrateful?

Holo:
Oh, an oversight? You are not from the village, perhaps.
My apologies. You may wield away.
My name is Holo. This is the first time in a long while I have taken this form. I believe it to be working out finely.

Lawrence:
Holo?

Holo:
Yes. Nice name, is it not?

Lawrence:
Amazing. I have heard of someone else who's referred to by that name.

Holo:
Really? How unusual. I have never known another Holo besides myself.
From where is this person?

Lawrence:
It is the name of a god, the village nearby has known for generations.
Don't tell me you happen to be the same god.

Holo:
I have been named a god and bound to this region for quite a long time now.
I am not so grand, not as a god. I am Holo and Holo is all that I am.
A meager, lost, delirious woman who must have been locked deep inside of her house ever since she was a tiny infant, you are thinking something like that?
I was born in the land from the far north.

Lawrence:
North?

Holo:
Yes. They have a short summer and a long winter.
My home is in the forest of Yoitz.
It is a world of silver where everything sparkles.
You are a traveling peddler, are you not?
Take me with you, then.

Lawrence:
Wha... But why me?

Holo:
Because I am a good judge of character.
And because I do not believe you're at all the type of person who would deny me this kind of request.

Lawrence:
Stay away!
I'm not that generous!

Holo:
Please be kinder to me.
I believe you are adorable.

Lawrence:
Wha!

Holo:
Hachoo.
I do not hate this form, but I find it too cold for my liking.

Lawrence:
Holo!
If you really are Holo the wise wolf, I want you to prove it to me.

Holo:
Does that mean you wish to see me in my wolf form?

Lawrence:
That's right.

Holo:
I do not want to.

Lawrence:
What? But why not?

Holo:
I should ask you why!

Lawrence:
Well, because if you're human, I'll turn you over to the authorities.
A person possessed by the Devil needs to be saved.
But I might reconsider turning you in if you are indeed Holo, god of rich harvests.
After all it's possible you might end up bringing me some luck as well.

Holo:
And you insist upon this?

Lawrence:
Yes, please.

Holo:
One more time shall I ask: Do you insist upon seeing this, no matter what?

Lawrence:
No matter what.

Holo:
An incarnation cannot change her form without a compensation.
And in order for me to change, I'll need the blood of a human... either that or a bit of wheat.

Lawrence:
By all means, the wheat.

Holo:
[Retches.]

Lawrence:
Hey!
Are you all right?

Lawrence:
Once again, I apologize for coming back so suddenly.

Village Mayor:
Not a problem. I'm headed to the festival, but make yourself at home.

Lawrence:
Who's there?

Chloe:
Holo.

Lawrence:
Holo?

Chloe:
You didn't bother showing up so I've come to you.

Lawrence:
What are you doing? Aren't you supposed to stay locked up?

Chloe:
Come on! It's not like there's a real Holo that's gonna get mad. Let's go.

Lawrence:
Just where are we going?

Chloe:
You're treating me, remember?
Did you go to Sauschbasch before you came here?
You smell differently than you did last time.

Lawrence:
You always did have a good nose.

Chloe:
Each place you visit has a scent. I guess it's only natural for it to stick to you.

Lawrence:
And your features are different than before. You seem to be more confident.

Chloe:
Thank you. Things are going well for me. You should watch out or I might end up taking your place soon.

Lawrence:
Well, when you do, please make use of my services.

Chloe:
That's rude. You don't really think I will, do you?

Lawrence:
Why not? This is good alcohol.

Chloe:
Fine!

Lawrence:
Who's being rude now?

Chloe:
If you believe in me so much, then I've got a proposal for you.

Lawrence:
Ah?

Chloe:
If it works out, you'll be able to open your own shop. You might even be able to get married.

Lawrence:
Very funny, Chloe.

Chloe:
I'm not being funny! I've heard them talking about a big business deal.
I'm telling you, we could make a killing here!
Lawrence?

Lawrence:
You're becoming more and more like your father.
When it came to dealing with business, he definitely shared in your enthusiasm.

Chloe:
It's not just enthusiasm.
Otherwise I would have never brought it up.

Lawrence:
Is that so? Well, just talking big business can be intimidating.
But I'd find it hard to believe you need me to talk.

Chloe:
No, I want to work with you specifically because I respect you.
Don't you know? I carry everything you have ever taught me in my heart.
The only reason I'm where I am today is because of you. It's always been you.

Lawrence:
Sounds risky. Risky, risky!
You're still young, Chloe.
It sounds to me like this is an all-or-nothing deal.
Before you get involved, I think you should have more experience.

Chloe:
Your choice! But this could have been our opportunity to make a profit together!

Lawrence:
How about I'll bring you a less risky deal next time?
I wouldn't mind working with you on that.

Chloe:
And here I am. I've grown up. And you've never even noticed.

Lawrence:
Uh... it's just your judgment as a merchant needs some growth.

Chloe:
Don't underestimate me. You'll regret it one day.

Lawrence:
That might be good for me. But I'll try not to do it.

Chloe:
Is it a woman?

Lawrence:
Hm?

Chloe:
You seem as if you're distracted by something.
I was wondering what it could be.

Lawrence:
Oh, I wonder what it would be like if Holo became my partner.

Chloe:
Holo? Do you mean me?

Lawrence:
No. I'm talking about the real Holo.

Chloe:
For god's sake. Please don't tell me you believe in that myth.

Lawrence:
You think it's just a myth?

Chloe:
Yes, I do.

Lawrence:
Just a myth, huh?

Chloe:
Just a myth.

Lawrence:
I wonder if she ever feels heartbroken.

Chloe:
You're talking about Holo again?

Lawrence:
Yes. If she is real.

Chloe:
No. That's impossible. Why would a god feel heartbroken?

Lawrence:
I don't know.

Lawrence:
There's no way she really exists.

Holo:
Who does not exist exactly?

Lawrence:
Ah! Holo!

Holo:
Do not be surprised at what you expect.

Lawrence:
Where have you been hiding?

Holo:
Around this time of year, I am in the harvested wheat.
Usually, I cannot leave there, otherwise people would see me.
But there is one exception.

Lawrence:
An exception?

Holo:
If perchance there is another harvested wheat within a close proximity to the wheat where I am hiding.
I can then move to that wheat.
In other words, without the bushel in your cart, I could never have escaped.
I am in your debt.

Lawrence:
I'm sorry. You graciously show me the true form. All I did was act like an idiot.
Is that why you disappeared?

Holo:
A long time ago, a young man from this village approached me. He asked me to help their wheat to ripen well.
The promise made I have kept ever since.
However, a rich harvest places strain upon the land.
I had to allow it to rest from time to time.
The villagers called me impulsive.
They believed I had broken my vow.
Now it appears no one needs me any longer.
And even when they still had need of me, whenever anyone saw me, they trembled with fear and ran as far as they could.
So I was alone. I never wished for that.
I never meant to frighten you either.

Lawrence:
Alright. Suppose I accept your story as it is.

Holo:
You are a very skeptical man.

Lawrence:
Do you have a place to go?

Holo:
I wish to return to the north.

Chloe:
Lawrence?

Lawrence:
All clear, you can come out now.

Holo:
I have to admit it was not easy to tie my shoelaces inside of this thing.
Woe is me.

Lawrence:
I can imagine it would be. Shoelaces?
Ah...
Hey! Those are mine!

Holo:
Yes. And how do I look?

Lawrence:
Those are my best clothes. I spent ten years collecting them.

Holo:
They are very fine, quite wonderfully tailored.
So you are not such a bad merchant after all.

Lawrence:
I can still refuse to take you with me.

Holo:
I do not think you would though.

Lawrence:
Don't underestimate.

Holo:
I would never. Now as for your name. What is it?

Lawrence:
Lawrence. My name is Craft Lawrence.

Holo:
Well, Lawrence.
I will make certain a stirring legend about you shall be passed down among the people for all time.

Lawrence:
No thank you. I don't need a legend. But I will need you to pay for your own meals.
It's not like this is an easy business.

Holo:
I am not the sort who would insist upon living off the charity of others.
I am Holo the wise wolf. And I am a very proud wolf. At any rate.

Lawrence:
Hm?

Holo:
This is rather small.

Lawrence:
Thank you.

Holo:
But, I'm sure it helps to keep out the cold.
