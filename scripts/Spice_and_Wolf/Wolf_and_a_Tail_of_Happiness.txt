Lawrence:
How many have you eaten so far?

Holo:
Seventeen. Maybe eighteen. Probably at least nineteen.

Lawrence:
How many are left?

Holo:
Why do you even care?

Lawrence:
I just wanted to know.

Holo:
You already know.

Lawrence:
I want to hear you say it.

Holo:
Eighty-one.

Lawrence:
Really? Eight!

Holo:
I said 81!

Lawrence:
I heard.

Holo:
Would you like for me to finish them right now? Will that make you happy?

Lawrence:
I don't know. I don't think you can do it.

Holo:
I can! I am Holo the wise wolf, so you shut up!

Lawrence:
You know, you don't have to be so stubborn.

Holo:
I am not being stubborn.

Lawrence:
You sure about that?

Holo:
Yes, I am sure.

Lawrence:
Are you sure that you're sure?

Holo:
I am sure that I am sure!

Lawrence:
Because you don't sound very sure to me.

Holo:
Just you watch and you will find how sure I am!
Honestly, I sure am tired of them.

Lawrence:
That's what I figured.
Even if they are your favorite, you ate 20 of them yesterday on top of what you ate today.
(on top of: ～に加えて)

Holo:
So what? I will eat every one of them right now. Watch!

Lawrence:
Don't get so upset. I'm sure you're tired of eating raw apples.
But there're plenty of other ways to eat them, you know.

Holo:
What other ways? You had better not be teasing. This is not a joke.

What are you talking about? Baking apples? I have never heard of such a thing

Lawrence:
I had no idea there were still people that have never tasted apple pie.

Holo:
Well, I have not. But it sounds like an excellent idea.

Lawrence:
It is. They bake it in an oven. That way, the apples become surprisingly tender.
It's like they're rotting. Well, the texture's like that. The flavor's actually amazing.

Holo:
Oh?

Lawrence:
I guess you can think of it like this.
You know how things are really tasty right before they go bad.
And for whatever reason, when you bake an apple, it tastes like that.
It becomes sweet and tender and warm, and it's all at same time.
But I'm sure after your little binge sweet things are starting to get boring.
So how about this, instead.
Would you rather have salt-seasoned meat for dinner or fish?

Holo:
Meat!

Lawrence:
What happened to the girl who looked as if she couldn't stand to eat another bite?

Holo:
Meat is a completely different story.
Let's go.

Lawrence:
Okay, finish the apples though, seriously.

Holo:
You do not have to worry.
After what you just told me, I am positive I can finish them all, thank you.

Lawrence:
Well, I guess we can go then. Ready?

Holo:
Of course!

I have been waiting out here forever. Why are you being so slow?

Lawrence:
Why are you being so difficult?

Holo:
Because you like me this way.

Lawrence:
Uh... well...

Holo:
What?

Lawrence:
It' just that... well, you kinda look like a nun.

All I see is a nun. From every angle, nun.

Holo:
Yes, it is quite convenient for traveling. Would you agree?

Lawrence:
I guess.

Holo:
I fail to understand how it makes a difference whether I wear this simple cloth.
The human world is strange as always.

Lawrence:
But I suppose if you think about it, even a wolf will sometimes like to wear sheep's clothing.
Am I right?

Holo:
True enough, although if one were to wear the fur of a rabbit instead, I believe you would be caught rather easily.

Lawrence:
Then I guess I should probably carry some apples with me just in case I end up getting captured.

Holo:
And I had very nearly forgotten about those stupid apples.

Lawrence:
However...

Holo:
What?

Lawrence:
Well, in your particular case, looking too much like a nun can actually be problematic.

Holo:
What do you mean?

Lawrence:
Well, because it doesn't matter what happens, nuns do not drink during the day

Holo:
Oh, really, well, then I must be an outstanding nun.

Lawrence:
And a nun would never say something like that.

Holo:
I humbly beg your pardon, kind sir.

Lawrence:
But really though, when we head north, there're some places where your looking like a nun will definitely cause trouble.

Holo:
Trouble? Well, what do you suggest we do about it?

Lawrence:
You'll have to change clothes. I'm thinking it'll be safer if you at least wear something similar to what the girls in town like to wear.

Holo:
The food will not taste as good, if we know we have to run errands afterwards.
So what do you say we go ahead and purchase something before we eat?

Lawrence:
Really, yeah, that'd be great.
I was afraid I was gonna have to convince you.

Holo:
Were you worried I would insist upon eating and drinking first?
You should know me better by now.
I am not that drawn to food.

Lawrence:
No, not food.

Holo:
I see. Then you were being considerate after all. I should probably take you up on it.
Your exaggerated reason behind purchasing me a new outfit.
Or did you really think that I would not notice?
For your sake, I shall not hold back and will allow you to purchase new clothes for me.
The winter is fast approaching and it will be getting cold.

Lawrence:
That's very big of you, thanks.  [that's very big of you : それは有難い]
Oh, no!

Holo:
"Oh no"? Is something the matter?

Lawrence:
I don't have money.

Holo:
I don't believe you.

Lawrence:
No, I didn't mean that way.
I meant I don't have any change.

Holo:
I simply do not understand. Why can you not use that money?

Lawrence:
Well, technically I could. But they wouldn't like it very much.
Using gold coins to buy clothes is kind of like using a sledgehammer to kill a fly.

Holo:
I see. I didn't realize the gold coins were so much higher in value than the silver ones.

Lawrence:
They are. For example, a current Lumione gold coin is equivalent to 35 Trenni silver coins.
If you live modestly, you can last seven days on one silver coin.
Gold is 35 times that.

Holo:
Wow, it is a big difference then.
But this robe cost two gold coins, exactly.
That is what they said at the store.
Are you sure you do not buy clothes with gold coins and apples with silver?

Lawrence:
If that were the case, most of the townspeople would be naked.
The clothing shop owner who sold it to you was probably just worried about whether he'd really get paid for it.

Holo:
Oh, I did not realize it was so expensive.

Lawrence:
Well, obviously.
So for the next ones, why don't you pick out something a little cheaper?

Holo:
Cheaper! I am Holo the wise wolf!
If I am caught in cheap clothing, it will ruin my good name!

Lawrence:
You know what they say. If one is truly pretty, she'll look good no matter what she wears.
Now, I need to make some change...

Holo:
Oh, exchanging money!
Then we shall have to go to that bridge, right?
Come on, come on! Let's go!
And walk fast while you're at it.
I need to have a drink and I need one soon.


Weiz:
Let's see. For Lumione, it's gonna be 34 Trenni silver coins to stay current with the going rate.

Lawrence:
And the transaction fee?

Weiz:
It's ten Lute silver coins or I'll take 30 Trie copper coins.

Lawrence:
Lute silver it is.

Weiz:
Agreed. We'll go with the Lute. All right then.
Now, don't forget to be careful. If you drop anything, it will end up belonging to the person who picks it up first.

Lawrence:
Weiz.

Weiz:
Yes?

Lawrence:
Try to remember that I'm the customer.

Weiz:
Just leave the coin over there somewhere.
Can't you see I'm kinda busy?

Lawrence:
Well, when you tear yourself away from her, do you think you can help me?

Weiz:
What did I say?
It is more important to me to make sure this delightful girl does not drop any of her silver coins.
Isn't that right?

Holo:
Yes, and thank you.
But can I ask you a question?

Weiz:
Anything in the world!

Holo:
Do you not think there might be a few too many of these silver coins for my hand to hold?
(a few too many:多くの)

Weiz:
But my dear Holo, that's exactly what my hands are here for.

Holo:
Ah, oh, perhaps you should not though.
Your precious hands will be occupied.

Weiz:
Oh, no, I gladly sacrifice my hands to prevent any unfortunate loss of silver coins form yours.
In fact, such sacrifice could only bring me joy. Yes, joy!
And do you know why that is, my darling?
Because then maybe you could see that the passion in my heart is so great that my hands, no, not even my arms could contain it!

Lawrence:
All right!
Have you forgotten the basics of money dealing?
"Silver gets a bag. Gold gets a box. And if money is to be held in hand, it should be crude copper", right?

Weiz:
Fine! Keeping a wonderful girl like that to yourself is an act that can only defy God!
Haven't you ever heard the expression, "Share the bread you've been given with others"?

Lawrence:
You want me to share her?
Remember, there's no bargaining when it comes to money dealing.
If I hand her over, it's all or nothing!
If you take her, the debt she owes me will transfer over to you as well.
And I, of course, would expect to be paid in full immediately.

Weiz:
I could never do something as cruel as to put a price on you, love.
What a horrible thing to say!
You are nothing more than a crooked merchant!

Holo:
I want you to please understand the scales of my heart will always be swaying back and forth.
But there is something you should know.
I will never lean to one side or the other due to the weight of gold coins.

Weiz:
Oh, Holo, of course you wouldn't.

Holo:
You dare touch swaying scales with your hand?
You must be a very disreputable person indeed.

Weiz:
Oh, my darling!

Lawrence:
Well, we should be going now.

Weiz:
Hey, Lawrence, I was wondering...

Lawrence:
What?

Weiz:
You came all the way here just to exchange that gold coin?
Are you buying anything?

Lawrence:
I am.
I hear every day things are getting more and more expensive. That's to buy now.
See ya!

Holo:
Tell me, do money dealers work even after it is becoming dark?

Weiz:
No, it's pretty common knowledge that money dealers who trade after dark are less-than-honest dealers.
I am not a crook, so I refuse to work after dark.

Holo:
I would like Weiz to accompany us, if you do not mind.

Lawrence:
We are buying her clothes and then we'll go get dinner.
If you feel like it, you can meet us at the bar later.

Weiz:
Oh, yeah, definitely!
I'm assuming the usual place?

Lawrence:
Of course, it's always best to get drunk where you are comfortable.

Weiz:
See you there then! As soon as I finish up here, I'll see both of you at the bar!


 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:0:&lt;h2&gt; 

Holo:
How fun! That was certainly amusing. Do you not agree?

Lawrence:
Hilarious. But you'd better watch yourself with that one.

Holo:
What do you mean?

Lawrence:
He'll follow you around.

Holo:
But I am already followed around by you.
He is different though in that he knows he is playing a game.
It is more fun teasing you though.
And I enjoy speaking to a smart male every once in a while.
Come on now, Lawrence. Please do not be so serious.
We both realize that this is only a game.
Although I have to admit I am a little embarrassed.
It is just... that Weiz fellow is such a smooth talker, which is unlike you completely.
But I know from past experience there is nothing more unreliable than the words coming out of people's mouths.
You live in the business world. You must know what I mean.

Lawrence:
Yeah, I'm fairly certain I would lie about anything if it meant I could make a profit.

Holo:
Your lies do not work on me though.

Lawrence:
If you say so. Shall we go buy your clothes then?

Holo:
Lawrence!

Lawrence:
Hmm?

Holo:
You've failed to grab the happiness which has been handed to you twice now.
If you fail to grab it one more time, the tail of happiness might just run away and you shall never find it again.


Wait! I have no idea what you are talking about.
Holo! What do you mean?


Shop owner:
That one is 40 Lute coins, which is a pretty fair price for that piece.

Holo:
It is expensive.

Lawrence:
We're actually planning to head north soon, so if you could find us something suitably thick and cheap for two people, that'd be great.

Shop owner:
What can you afford?

Lawrence:
Two Trenni silver coins.

Shop owner:
I think I can help.
Two tops and bottoms, plus two blankets.
How will these work for you?

Lawrence:
I think those should work just fine. Thank you very much.
As you can see, I'm a peddler myself. I've managed to get in good with the local Milone Trading branch while I've been here.

Shop owner:
Oh, Milone Trading?

Lawrence:
Yeah, so it looks as though I'll be traveling to this town several times a year from now on.

Shop owner:
Oh, is that right?
Then why don't you go ahead and take this coat as well.
Then I'll just go and grab you another blanket.
Of course, these have been fumigated.
They're guaranteed to be bug-free for two more years at least.

Holo:
I am sorry, but I thought we came here to buy me clothes.

Lawrence:
We did.

Holo:
But then, do I have to wear those?

Lawrence:
If you think you can stay warm wearing just that robe, then no, you don't have to wear them.

Holo:
If you are upset about me spending some of your money without asking you, you can just tell me you are angry.
For I am Holo the wise wolf, I have a good brain as well as a pleasing appearance.
But I have a good nose too, and wearing that will make my nostrils curl.

Lawrence:
Well maybe this is your chance to learn some humility.
Trust me, your personality will benefit

Don't be upset. I'll show you what's behind the trick.
Mister, I wanna ask you something.

Shop owner:
Yes?

Lawrence:
Do you have anything nice that a woman would wanna wear?

Shop owner:
Something for a woman?

Lawrence:
Preferably something warm for those northern towns. And in the lady's size, if you have.

Shop owner:
Hm, give me just a second. I have the perfect thing. How about this?
I bought it from a merchant family when they were updating their wardrobe.

Holo:
I think it is far too extravagant for me.

Shop owner:
Well, then, what are you looking for?

Holo:
I would like something a little simpler and easier to change into.

Shop owner:
Hmm, right. Let me see what I can find.

Lawrence:
Excuse me, what about that?

Shop owner:
Pardon? Oh, yes, of course!
I'm not surprised this caught your eyes.
This is an excellent piece that's been worn by a noble.
Look at this. The ends are stitched very carefully so they won't tear.
And pay careful attention to this walnut button. Can you see the detail?
You simply will not beat this quality.
You are a very good merchant.
Oh, and notice this specially made sling.
If you wear this around your shoulders, you won't be able to help catching the eyes of people in town.

Holo:
I smell rabbit.

Lawrence:
Well don't eat it.

Holo:
I would like these.

Lawrence:
Hmm, so how much are they?

Shop owner:
For the two of them together? Ten Trenni silver coins.
No, make it nine instead.
No, no, wait. How about eight silver coins?
So I can show my respect to this lovely lady's beauty.

Lawrence:
That's a deal.

Holo:
What if this lovely lady were willing to try on this lovely merchandise and show it off, would you then make it seven?

Shop owner:
Okay, sure, you can have them for seven.

Holo:
Oh, thank you.
Excuse me a minute.

How do I look?

Shop owner:
Just wonderful! If I didn't know better, I'd think you'd paid 20 coins for it.

Holo:
So, were the clothes not expensive?

Lawrence:
No, seven silver coins for that quality is really a good buy.
Did you know you'd be able to knock the price down?

Holo:
Uh-uh.
If I had picked the kind clothes you are carrying, I know we could have purchased them for one-tenth the price of this.

Lawrence:
Well, I'd actually expected them to cost a lot more, so don't worry about it, okay?
However, if you feel that bad about it, try not drinking anything tonight, you'd save up seven coins pretty quick.

Holo:
I do not drink that much!

Lawrence:
Anyway, your little tactics for knocking down prices are kinda dirty.
No matter how good the merchant is, he has no way around that.

Holo:
So? It is hardly my fault all men are idiots.
What do you plan on doing with those things you purchased?
You do not intend to take them to the bar, do you?

Lawrence:
No, that was not my attention.

Holo:
We are not headed to the inn either, are we?

Lawrence:
That is because I'm not taking them to the inn.
I'll sell these as is to another clothing shop.
We've still got some time before winter hits.
We can buy them again, when we get further north.

Holo:
Sell them? Really?

Lawrence:
Yeah. There's no use in keeping them if we're not using them, right?

Holo:
Yes, that is true.
But will you be able to sell them at a high price?

Lawrence:
I'm not sure. I guess selling them for the same price would be difficult, probably lose some on the deal.

Holo:
You sell even when you know you will lose?

Lawrence:
You haven't figured it out?

Holo:
Hold on! I need a minute to think this over.

Lawrence:
Would you like me to explain the trick?

Holo:
I am not asking for your help, but if you would like to tell me, I will not stop you!

Lawrence:
Understood.
It's nothing special, and plus, you did a better job than me anyway.

Holo:
Huh?

Lawrence:
This bundle of clothes cost two silver coins.
Let's say, for example I sold these to another shop for one silver coin, I'd lose one silver coin.

Holo:
Go on.

Lawrence:
Well, then you have to pay attention to something else altogether.

Holo:
What else altogether?

Lawrence:
Look, no matter who sees your robe, they're going to be able to tell it's very good quality, right?

Holo:
I guess so.

Lawrence:
I'm sure you can imagine that people who normally wear this kind of quality wouldn't visit a shop like that.
So the shop owner wanted to have a good relationship with me, because I was with you.
Now, this being the case, what would you do if you were him?

Holo:
I would sell things cheap, so it would leave you with a good impression.

Lawrence:
That's correct. And after you did that, then what would you do?

Holo:
Hmm...

Lawrence:
He reduced the price a little on these, but he reduced it quite a bit for your clothes.
I am a customer who willingly paid two silver coins for clothes that are basically rags, but there's a big difference in the price of these versus the price of your clothes.
So tell me, what's the significance there?

Holo:
If we take into consideration the total balance, we really saved a lot.

Lawrence:
Exactly right!
Oh, that hurt!

Holo:
Ha, you did that to him and yet you call me the tricky one!

Lawrence:
Which means you had to go and hit me?

Holo:
That's right! Although I am surprised you came up with such a method anyway.

Lawrence:
I like to call it having business sense.
Still, the way you handled that merchant was a lot better than I could have done.

Holo:
Naturally! Because your shallow cleverness is no match for my scheming.

Lawrence:
Yeah, so you say. [so you say :お前はそう言う（が本当かな？)]

Holo:
Oh, is that a challenge?
Because if you are confident, you should probably show me your skills in the bar where we are headed.

Lawrence:
Show them in the bar?

Holo:
You can pay as high a price as possible to purchase me.

Lawrence:
Sure, of course I will. But I'll insist on paying in apples.

Holo:
You are not playing very nice to mention apples.

Lawrence:
They will get a little sweeter if you bake them.

Holo:
I think jealousy heats you up a little bit.
Males burned with jealousy are too sweet to eat.

Lawrence:
Then what about you?

Holo:
What, are you saying you want to give it a try?

Lawrence:
I'll think about it.

Holo:
You caught the happiness that time.
