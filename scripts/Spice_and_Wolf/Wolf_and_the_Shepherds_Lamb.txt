Nora:
[A prayer of safe passage]
Thank you very much, sir.

Lawrence:
Oh, no, thank you very much.

Nora:
And now I must thank you again.

Lawrence:
Well, then…

Nora:
Wait. I was just wondering... where did you hear about this road?

Lawrence:
A bar in Poroson a few days ago.

Nora:
Didn't they tell you about wolves out here?

Lawrence:
Yes, they certainly did, but we decided to risk it.
We're in a bit of hurry.

Nora:
I understand.

Lawrence:
Um, is something the matter?

Nora:
Oh, no. It's just…

Lawrence:
Go ahead. Please, don't hold yourself back on my account.  [don't hold back on my account : 遠慮するな]

Nora:
Okay then... do you think you might wanna hire me?

I am a shepherd. And yes, part of my job is raising sheep, but I also have to protect them.
I can drive wolves away. I'm very good at it.
If you hire me, I can protect you from the wolves on this road!
What do you think?

Enek, go!

Lawrence:
Give me just a second. Let me go talk to my partner.

Holo:
Her skills?

Lawrence:
Yes, she can help us. You heard what she said, right?
I think it might be worth it.

Holo:
Yes, but you already have me.

Lawrence:
I know, and I realize you should be enough.
But I never even considered that a shepherd could be used to protect us from wolves, did you?
It could help me with some business ventures too.

Holo:
It appears as though human males do not mind having several females around.

Lawrence:
First of all, don't wolves run in packs?
And second of all, you're prettier than her and you know it.

Holo:
Oh, fine. I guess I can accept that explanation.

Lawrence:
So, you think she's any good?

Holo:
She ranks among the highly skilled, most likely.

Lawrence:
Think you could be more specific?

Holo:
I could hunt her sheep without a problem, but I imagine she could handle ordinary wolves easily, even if they all attacked at once.

Lawrence:
Why is that?

Holo:
She is quite the expert at handling her dog.
A troublesome shepherd and a clever dog always work well together.
'Tis true in her case at least.
Judging by her voice, she seems young; I'm concerned about how good she is yet to become.
Perhaps I might want to take care of her now...!

Lawrence:
Please don't. Thank you though.

Holo:
Oh, Lawrence, you do not really plan to hire her, do you?

Lawrence:
That's what I'm thinking, yeah.

Holo:
If you do hire her, we will be forced to travel together for a while.
Am I not correct?

Lawrence:
Well, yes.

Holo:
Well, I find that disconcerting.

Lawrence:
We'll only be traveling together for two days. That's all.

Holo:
Yes, and I find that disconcerting.

Lawrence:
Right, you'll be fine. Just be patient.

Holo:
What could I possibly need to be patient for?

Lawrence:
Well, you know, it'll be two whole days before we can be alone again.
But if you can't bear it …

Holo:
I do not mind but it might cause problems for you.
If we were to carelessly travel with others, what happens if they are to find out about me?
Oh, I understand now! Would you rather I said something like this?
"I want to travel with you. All by myself!"
Idiot!

Lawrence:
Holo …

Holo:
Seriously, well, she will probably not find out, if it is only for two days.
You may do as you please.

Lawrence:
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

Nora:
No, that's fine.

Lawrence:
How does forty Tries to get us to Lubinheigen sound?
And I'll pay you extra if you keep us from getting harmed, should wolves happen to attack. Is that too low?

Nora:
No! Thank you very much.

Lawrence:
No, thank you. …Um, I'm sorry, I completely forgot to ask your name.

Nora:
Oh, of course. I'm sorry too. I'm, I'm Nora Arendt.


Nora:
Enek!

Lawrence:
Have you been working as a shepherd for long?

Nora:
Oh, no. It's been about four years.
I only became a shepherd just after I took in my Enek.

Lawrence:
That's surprising. What did you do before?

Nora:
I lived in a convent annex and worked there.
We sheltered the poor and helped take care of them.

Lawrence:
I see.

Nora:
I enjoyed my time at the shelter but I always wanted to have a job of my own.
I'm really lucky to have found my Enek.

Lawrence:
He's probably a reward for your kindness.

Nora:
Yes, I'm sure it must have been God that brought him to me and for that I am very grateful.
When I first met him, he was filthy and covered in wounds.

Lawrence:
Attacked by wolves?

Nora:
No, I think it must have been mercenaries.
The poor thing was cowering under a small cliff not far from the annex when I first saw him.

Lawrence:
Really? You know, I never imagined I'd have a shepherd as guard.

Nora:
No?

Lawrence:
Shepherds don't normally guard people, right?

Nora:
No... I guess... I thought we could talk.

Lawrence:
I can understand.

Nora:
Also, I had always wanted to become a tailor.
But to do it I knew I needed to have money.
They have association fees and things like that.

Lawrence:
So you know, you'll probably make more money guarding merchants than you will caring for sheep.
I imagine your territory as a shepherd is always up for debate.

Nora:
Definitely. It seems the safe places are already claimed by the time I get there.

Lawrence:
The only area left was the one with all the wolves?

Nora:
Yes.

Lawrence:
I have a feeling they can be a pain.
Ow!

Lawrence:
On top of that, they're cunning and underhanded.

Nora:
They may be able to hear us, so it's best not to talk bad about them.

Lawrence:
You're right.



Part B


Nora:
Once again, I am very sorry for making you stop so early.

Lawrence:
No, don't be. I understand completely. Shepherds have to go to sleep before the sun sets.

Nora:
Thank you. Enek and I have to watch over the whole flock throughout the night.

You know, I always think the same thing when I look at all of them.
I wonder what kind of clothing their wool will become.

Lawrence:
Your shepherding skills are really quite impressive, Nora. You're very talented.

Nora:
Oh, no, not me.

Lawrence:
With your skill, they should allow you to care for a lot more sheep than this.

Nora:
I consider the ones I have blessing enough.
I don't think I would be able to handle any more.

Lawrence:
I don't think your employer's very smart.
Why don't you find someone who appreciates you?

Nora:
I could never though. It's not possible.

Lawrence:
Sorry. I'm a merchant after all, so I tend to think about things only in terms of profit and loss.

Nora:
Lawrence?

Lawrence:
Yeah?

Nora:
Lawrence:
Well, it's normal to find someone else to work for, if you don't like how you're being treated.

Nora:
I didn't know that.

Lawrence:
Nora, don't you work for the church?

Nora:
What?

Lawrence:
It's just a guess, but I have a feeling it's true.

Nora:
I do, yes.The priest at the church entrusted the sheep to me.
He's actually been very considerate.

Lawrence:
You can ignore what I said earlier.
You may not get the best pay, but as long as God doesn't abandon us, the Church is not gonna go anywhere.
You'll never have to worry about losing your job as a shepherd and you'll never go hungry.

Nora:
I guess you're right. Yeah, I guess you're right!

Lawrence:
And as far as I know, God doesn't have any rules against doing a little work on the side.
Tell you what. When I get to Lubinheigen, I'll have a talk with some of my friends who're merchants.
I'll see if any of them need a dependable guard. Okay?

Nora:
You'd really do that for me, Lawrence? Thank you.


Lawrence:
She doesn't have a job that's easy.

Holo:
Well, I do have to care for my tail every day.
Mmm? Oh, wait! You are talking about her, aren't you?

Lawrence:
Her name's Nora, by the way.
Hey!
You said it was okay. I mean, that is why I asked you first.

Holo:
Now I cannot even groom my tail in peace.

Lawrence:
But you were just doing it.

Holo:
Yes, until I had to listen to the two of you!

Lawrence:
Are you kidding?

Holo:
I suppose you seem to be having a nice little chat.

Lawrence:
You mean with Nora?

Holo:
Unless you were speaking to her dog or the sheep.

Lawrence:
She said she wanted someone to talk to; I'm not gonna turn her down, Holo.
More importantly, I haven't talked to a normal girl in a while.

Holo:
And do you never notice that the little shepherd girl did not actually wish to speak with you?

Lawrence:
That's okay too. I mean if it was love at first sight, I wouldn't be able to experience the joy of gradually having her fall for me.
What do you think? I'm pretty smooth, right?

Holo:
No, no, you are not! You are not smooth at all!

Lawrence:
Thanks so much for that. Geez!
You happy now?

Holo:
Yes, actually I am rather amused at the moment. So thank you.

Lawrence:
As long as you're not in a bad mood anymore, that's all that matters.

Holo:
I am not. I do not remember why I was angry.
I shall take it as a gift from shepherd girl.


Nora:
This is it.


Nora:
Good morning to you, sir.

Gatekeeper:
Well, good morning to you, miss.

Lawrence:
May I have a pass? Thank you.

Nora:
Thank you very much, sir.

Lawrence:
I really appreciate your help.
You know, at an official check point, it would've taken me at least ten times longer than that to get this pass. Thanks.

Nora:
Don't thank me. It's all part of my employment with the church.

Lawrence:
All right, here's the forty Tries I promised you.

Nora:
Wait. These two silver coins will exchange for about 45 Tries.

Lawrence:
An investment from a greedy merchant.

Nora:
How?

Lawrence:
If I have a good connection with a skilled shepherd, you never know, I might just come across an unexpected money-making idea in wool trading.

Nora:
Well then, thank you again.

Lawrence:
We'll be at the trading house of Lohen Merchant Association for the next few days.
If you plan to go back out across the fields again, please let me know.
I may be able to introduce you to some merchants from town who are in need of guard.

Nora:
Yes, of course I will.

Lawrence:
Just in case, let me ask you something: the road we took--is that the only road you'll be able to work on as a guard?

Nora:
No. I can also go to Kasrata, Poroson and Lamtra.

Lawrence:
Lamtra? You mean that Lamtra?

Nora:
Of course.

Lawrence:
And not the roundabout, official route, either?

Nora:
Oh, no, I take the shortcut that goes through the forest.

Lawrence:
Are you serious? Even knights are afraid of that forest.

Nora:
As long as I'm with Enek, I'm fine.

Lawrence:
Oh, in that case you'll have a much better chance of finding a customer.

Nora:
I hope that you're right, Lawrence.
Well, I have to go this way for the livestock entrance.

Lawrence:
Okay! We've almost made it.
Now all we're gonna have to do is get through customs and then head over to Lemerio Trading to sell these weapons.

Holo:
Hold on! We still have to buy honey-pickled peaches.

Lawrence:
All right! Let's go.

Holo:
I do not appreciate being ignored!

Lawrence:
Now, listen to me. If they don't have 'em, you're just gonna have to deal with it--and they might not.

Holo:
So you say.

Lawrence:
You can't get mad at me, if they don't.

Holo:
So you say.

Lawrence:
I'm not kidding.


Holo:
What is that gate?

Lawrence:
It's there to keep enemies from getting in during a battle.
And they use those holes for pouring out boiling-hot oil.

Holo:
This town has a disturbingly solid defense!


Customs officer:
Your pass, please.
So you're coming from Poroson. What are you bringing?

Lawrence:
Oh, yes, I'm bringing twenty sets of arms.

Customs officer:
Weapons? From Poroson?

Lawrence:
That's right. I bought them wholesale form Latparon Trading. Is that okay?

Customs officer:
Hmm... all right, you're good. So, are you paying tax with cash or goods?

Lawrence:
Oh. With goods please.

Customs officer:
That's a wise decision. Give the people on your left two sets of arms.

Holo:
It must be unusual then to make a wholesale purchase from Porson?

Lawrence:
Well as a matter of fact, no, it's not. It's actually pretty common.

Holo:
Oh.

Lawrence:
Here are my papers.

Customs officer::
You can go now.

Holo:
I think public officials have to be unpleasant no matter where you go.
Did you not notice?
It appeared the last one we encountered was silently laughing at us.
He most likely became jealous after seeing that pile of arms and thought to himself, "You are a mere merchant. You do not get to have any [?gloat] because you made a little money."

Lawrence:
Well that's okay. We still entered the town without any problems.
So you wanna leave the wagon at the inn and head straight to the street vendors?


Woman:
And peace be with you, Father.

Priest:
Good morning to you.

Man:
Good morning


Preacher:
And god will always find a way for us!

Holo:
So good! Could I have a refill, please?

Barkeep:
Okay, another beer it is. You're a pretty strong lady.

Holo:
Oh, but barkeep, I am just getting started!

Barkeep:
You've been had by an expensive girl, sir, but I gotta say, she's a pretty one.

Lawrence:
I know, and she'd be perfect, if she just didn't have that tail.

Holo:
I like this place; the alcohol is good and the town is lively.

Lawrence:
Be careful of that liveliness. You can't let your guard down.
No matter what, don't mess around with knights and mercenaries, okay?
You do, we'll be in big trouble.

Barkeep:
Here you go, ma'am.

Holo:
Thank you, much appreciated.


Holo:
So, where are we going now?

Lawrence:
The trading house.
Holo, you have stuff all over your face.
Will you stop? Come on!

Holo:
I have a question. Is there any point in me going to that trading house with you?

Lawrence:
No, but I think it's too dangerous to leave you alone.

Holo
Because of how attractive I am, right?

Lawrence:
I didn't mean it that way. We'll be in trouble if you get drunk and show off your ears and tail.

Holo:
If that should happen, which it won't, but if it did, I shall take you into my mouth and run out of town as quickly as possible.
The fence is low: I could do it.
If I am correct, there are stories like this about a knight and a young woman in fairy tales, is there not?

Lawrence:
The ones where a knight rescues a captured young woman in his arms?

Holo:
Yes. I shall do that.

Lawrence:
I'm sure you see it as a lovely picture, but for some reason me inside a wolf's mouth… doesn't seem too romantic.

Holo:
Would you rather I took you upon my back and raced through fields of lilies?

By the way... what is this trading house?

Lawrence:
Running any business comes with dangers and accidents, and you can't always trust that someone's gonna protect you.
You know how knights wear armor, well, we merchants like to keep safe by using connections with each other.
We're headed to a branch of an organization that consists of merchants from the same homeland.
As always, this place brings back memories. Looks like the buildings where I'm from.
It just feels like I'm home.

Holo:
It must be nice--to be able to feel at home in different places.

Lawrence:
Do you think you can manage to wait here a little while, while I go inside?

Holo:
Wait, I thought you were going to take me in and show me off to all the people from your home town.

Lawrence:
I'll be quick. If you can behave yourself, I'll buy you some sweet bread when we're done.

Holo:
Do not treat me like a child.

Lawrence:
So do you want some?

Holo:
I shall wait till you get back.


Jacob:
You're a poor excuse for a merchant to come in here. [excuse: 悪い見本]
It's the middle of the day. If you don't have an interest in doing an honest day's work, then you might as well become a thief, huh?

Lawrence:
But a really good merchant can make money without even getting dust on his shoes and he should only dirty his fingertips with a little black ink.
Running around in the market all day long is proof of a third-rate merchant. Isn't that right?

Jacob:
Look what the cat dragged in! You've turned into a pretty smooth talker.
Welcome back, son!

Lawrence:
I've never understood why you always call me your son.

Jacob:
Now, don't act so special.　You know, everyone in the Lohen Merchant Association is like a son or daughter to me.
Plus, I do still have the benefit of knowing you wet your bed a lot whenever you went camping.
I also know you stole the proceeds of a sale and went trembling with some of your friends to the house of ill repute.

Lawrence:
Okay. That's enough. Thank you.


Messenger:
Have you seen a merchant named Craft Lawrence come through?

Man:
Forget your man Lawrence. I haven't even seen a rat around here for the past few days.

Messenger:
I see.
