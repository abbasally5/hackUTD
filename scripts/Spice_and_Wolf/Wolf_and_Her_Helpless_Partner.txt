Lawrence:
Well, the smoked mutton was unexpectedly tender, don't you think?
And I'm sorry--I guess we ended up drinking more than I'd wanted to.
We didn't really exchange that much information, did we?

Zheren:
Yeah, you know, I guess we didn't, did we?
I keep getting distracted by your wife's conversation.
I'm fascinated by what she says.

Lawrence:
She loves to chatter about nothing, it seems.

Zheren:
Even so, I think she's absolutely incredible! You're a lucky man.

Thanks again, you two have been great.
Alright! Take care.

Lawrence:
Sure.

Assessor:
Sounds good.
Now that I know what this Zheren person looks like, I can find out more about him for you.

Lawrence:
I'd really appreciate it.

Assessor:
But to be perfectly honest, this is unusual.
I'm surprised to see it happening after only one day.
We were a little cautious at the beginning, but after hearing all the details, it doesn't seem to be just a simple fraud.
In order to get a large amount of silver coins whose value is going to decrease, someone is enlisting people to persuade several merchants to purchase silver coins by telling them a somewhat believable story about the value increasing.
However, since their value is going to decrease, the merchants will want to get rid of them pretty quickly.
I can only assume at that point this mystery person will buy them all at once.
And any merchants sure aren't going to tell anybody.
After all, they don't want to hurt their reputations.
I'm starting to get a good idea about how you can make an enormous profit using silver coins whose value is decreasing.
However, it does come with a fairly significant risk.
I have to admit, I'm pretty intrigued by this whole thing.

Lawrence:
I'm glad to hear it.

Assessor:
Well, everything is a learning experience--and that includes the sale of those marten furs.


Holo:
Do you think we will make it in time?

Lawrence:
Huh?

Holo:
Even if your assumption is correct, Milone Trading is going to have to do something about this situation quickly.
Otherwise the plan to outwit Zheren shall end in failure. (outwitz: 裏をかく)

Lawrence:
I'm sure it will be fine.
In order for this to be successful, especially in a foreign land, they have to be able to investigate a person's background and do it quickly.

What's so funny?

Holo:
Oh, it's nothing.
I was just remembering the old days.

Lawrence:
Why?
Because of me?

Holo:
He was leaning back in his chair as well and had a terrible fall. I tried to warn him, but he refused to listen to me.
I will never forget the look on his face.

Lawrence:
Sounds like a fun person to be around.

Holo:
Yes. He was quite a fool, but still extremely cheerful.
For some reason he was never surprised when he saw my wolf form.
I imagine some called him strange.
But he was a very nice man.
He was the first person to treat me as if I was like everybody else.
I liked him. He was from Pasloei.

Lawrence:
Is he the one who asked you to make the village's wheat ripen well?

Holo:
Yes. Oh, what a fool he was!
I found him to be a good friend.


Lawrence:
What's wrong?

Holo:
I believe I need to tell you something important.
I just had it, but now I cannot remember what it was.

Lawrence:
What are you talking about?

Holo:
I do not remember, but I think it is important.

Lawrence:
If it's that important, don't worry, you'll remember.

Holo:
I imagine so.

Lawrence:
He was her friend. Huh...


Marlheit:
My name is Marlheit, branch manager.
You can count on us. We have no problems with this deal.

Lawrence:
What about Zheren? Does that mean you were able to find out who he was working for?

Marlheit:
Yes. It appears he was working for the Medio Trading Company.

Lawrence:
The Medio Trading Company?
I don't understand.
I mean, yes, it's true they're the number one crop dealer in Pazzio and they do have a lot of shipment vessels. But still …

Marlheit:
Mmhmm. You're correct.
It would seem to be impossible for them to carry out what you suspect all by themselves.
It's more likely there's a nobleman behind this whole thing.
We have yet to identify that person. （have yet to～ : まだ～していない)
But no matter who they may be, if we move first as you suggest, we can make it work in our favor.

Lawrence:
Then why don't we discuss what our share's going to be?

Holo:
You appear perhaps too happy today, I think.

Lawrence:
Yeah. But just think about it. There could be at least 300,000 Trenni silver coins.
Maybe even 400,000! And if Milone gives me 10% of their profit, that's 2000 and enough to open my shop.

Holo:
I am glad things appear to be going so well for you.

Lawrence:
I wanted you to stay at the inn, if your hangover was that bad.

Holo:
I was worried. I do not want for you to get sweet-talked.

Lawrence:
What's that supposed to mean?

Holo:
Exactly what I sai…

Lawrence:
You're gonna be fine. The inn's right around the corner, alright?
Just a few more steps and we'll be there.

Holo:
All right.


Holo:
You drew your shop!
Do not be frightened.

Lawrence:
How long have you been there?
I never even heard you!

Holo:
I think you are a very talented artist.

Lawrence:
Well, I don't think so. But thank you.

Holo:
Are you wanting to open this shop of yours soon?

Lawrence:
If this thing with Milone Trading goes through, I guess, yeah.
It's pretty much a done deal.

Holo:
I see.

Lawrence:
There isn't a single merchant I know whose dream isn't to own their own shop.
I guess I'm not any different.
If you have your own store, you can become a member of that town.
It's different than being a peddler.
You can make close friends and it'll be easier to find a wife.
Speaking of which, I wonder how Chloe is doing right now.　 　(speaking of which:そういえば)
I can't imagine what she would say if I open my own shop.
Who knows, she might even bite her tongue!

Holo:
I would be at a loss though.

Lawrence:
Huh? What do you mean?

Holo:
Once you open this store, you are not very likely to leave there. Am I right?
I would be forced to either continue traveling all alone or find myself a new partner.

Lawrence:
Yes, but you are wise. And don't forget about the money you earned from the marten furs.
Trust me, you'll be fine traveling by yourself.

Holo:
I do not want to.
I will not bind you.
But I am tired of being alone, you know?

Lawrence:
Holo, I don't mind coming along with you until you get back to the north.
Even if I do get the money, it's not like I'll be able to open my shop right away.

Holo:
Do you mean this?

Lawrence:
Of course, why would I lie?
Now why are you making that face? I told you I was gonna go with you.
This isn't like you.

Holo:
I always have the same dream.

Lawrence:
Dream?

Holo:
When I wake up, everyone is gone. Yue, Inty, Paro, Muri, I cannot find them anywhere.
We can live for a hundred years. I thought I could leave.
I left on a journey fully believing I would see them again.
But I cannot find them. I cannot find them anywhere! I never imagined.
I thought I would be able to see them again.
And now I am afraid. I do not want to wake from my dream and discover that I am all alone.
I am tired of being alone. I do not want to be cold I do not want to be lonely.

I am so embarrassed.

Lawrence:
This dream is very common among peddlers too.
Goodness! Your tears have made your face so sticky.
Give me a sec. Here.

Holo:
That is your drawing.

Lawrence:
I've drawn a ton of them.
Besides, it's not like the deal has gone through yet. I need to be careful.
Don't wanna get overly optimistic.

Holo:
Thank you. I suppose I am in your debt.
Oh, I am so tired. Are you not going to go to sleep yet?

Lawrence:
I suppose I should.
I could save the candle.

Holo:
You think like a merchant every second of the day.

Lawrence:
What the... what are you doing?

Holo:
That is not a very romantic thing to say.
I cannot breathe!
Hold on. Have your eyes adjusted yet?

Lawrence:
What do you…?

Holo:
It was important after all; I finally remembered what I wanted to tell you
There are people outside the door, and I do not sense that they are well-meaning.

Lawrence:
I'd be willing to bet it's Medio Trading.

Holo:
And we are on the second floor. Luckily no one will be waiting outside.
Come on, we should go now.
You should probably just take advantage of this situation and look at my body under the moonlight, don't you think?

Part B

Holo:
We shall run. We do not have time for the wagon.
Killing the horse will not serve their purpose anyway.
We can retrieve him when things calm down.

Lawrence:
Right!

Holo:
Here, take this. Keep it with you, just in case.

Lawrence:
Why is it hot?

Holo:
Because it is the wheat in which I dwell.

Chasers:
They're headed to Milone Treading!
Don't let them get inside!

Lawrence:
Holo, when we're done with this, I think we should go shopping!

Holo:
What are you saying to me right now?

Lawrence:
I'll buy you a comb and a hat.

Holo:
What are you up to?

Lawrence:
Nothing!
You just happen to have beautiful hair!

Holo:
I think I would much rather have a comb for my tail.

Lawrence:
Good idea! We should get one.
Hang on. We're almost there.

Chasers:
Did you find them?
No.
They should be around here somewhere. We've got a backup coming.
We are going to completely surround them.
Yes sir!

Holo:
H this is not looking terribly good for us.

Lawrence:
Do you think we should split up then?

Holo:
That is a good thought, but I think I have a better idea.

Lawrence:
What is it?

Holo:
I will go out onto the street and attract their attention.
In the mean time …

Lawrence:
No you can't! I won't let you.

Holo:
Listen.
If we split up without a plan, you will be the one caught.
Do not forget that I am a wolf and not so easy to capture.
If I am left alone, how can I negotiate with Milone Trading?
You have already handed over your plan to them.
What if they abandon us?
We are left with no choice but for you to threaten to betray them.

Lawrence:
No, I can't do it! Don't you understand?
If Medio Trading sees your ears and your tail, they will take you immediately to the church.

Holo:
They shall not capture me.
But even if they did, I can keep my ears and tail hidden, if it is for a day or two.
After all I know you will soon arrive to rescue me anyway.

Lawrence:
You don't understand!

Holo:
Listen! You want to open the shop, correct?
Remember, I owe you. This is simply my way of paying back the debt.

Lawrence:
Don't be ridiculous!
If you get caught, they'll kill you!
A debt is not the same as your life.

Holo:
Loneliness is a disease that can lead to death. They might as well be the same thing.

Lawrence:
Please don't!

Holo:
I will always believe in you.

Chasers:
That way! We found them! They're on Roita Street.
Where are they?
There's only one of 'em. There's supposed to be two!
Hey, stop him! There he is!

Lawrence:
My name is Lawrence. Help me!
I was here this afternoon. Help me!

Chaser:
I hear him!
Hold it! Hand him over to us, now!

Assessor:
That's enough! Let me make myself perfectly clear to you.
This is the Great Marquis Milone's Milone Trading Company, which is authorized by the Grand Duke Raondeal of the Duchy Raondeal.
This gate belongs to the Marquis. Anyone who is on these premises is considered a personal guest to him.
And any guest of the Marquis is also under the care and protection of the Grand Duke of Raondeal.
Understand this:
You are wrong, if you think you are striking a simple property. You might as well be striking the pedestal of the Grand Duke!

Chaser:
Withdraw for now!

Assessor:
It's rather late for this kind of disturbance. Now, why don't you tell us what's going on?

Lawrence:
You saved my life just now. And I do apologize for disturbing everyone.

Assessor
No problem, but you shouldn't be thanking us. You should thank the Marquis
So tell me, who were those guys, anyway?


Marlheit:
In all likelihood, those men were working for Medio Trading.

Lawrence:
I think so, too.
Somehow they figured out I brought a deal to you.
They wanted to stop it.

Marlheit:
They wanted to stop it...

Lawrence:
It's possible they caught the woman who was traveling with me.
Can you help her? Is there anything you can do?

Marlheit:
After hearing all the commotion earlier, some of our men went to investigate.
They reported back to me that they'd seen a young woman being taken away by force.
Do you think it might be her?

Lawrence:
It has to be!
That was probably Holo. She acted as my decoy, so I could come here.

Marlheit:
Let me ask you, why do you think they captured her?
What would they want her for?

Lawrence:
Like I said, they didn’t want us to work with you!
They wanted to get us out of Medio Trading's way.

Marlheit:
Then let me ask you this: Do you find it at all strange?

Lawrence:
What are you talking about!?

Marlheit:
Please calm down, Lawrence. There's something else going on.
It's not that simple.

Lawrence:
I don’t understand.

Marlheit:
Think about it for just a minute.
What would they gain by taking you two hostage?
Doesn't make any sense. It would have no affect on us

Lawrence:
What?

Marlheit:
We've now started collecting that Trenni silver coin.
So what would be the point? They are already too late.
It would only be worth taking the two of you hostage, if you had asked us simply collect the coins, without having told us what kind of money making idea it was.
But we do know the deal.
You know what's happening?
It doesn't make any sense.
Yet still, if the rest were true I can't see a store acting on it. Can you?

Lawrence:
No, I... I can't.

Marlheit:
Yes, I hate to say this, but we already have all the necessary information.
Whatever happened to the two of you is really no longer our concern.
Believe me. I am sorry. We already have invested quite a bit of money into this.
I have to compare the extraordinary profit from this deal to the grudge from a merchant who we might see every three years.
Again, I'm very sorry, but I'm going to have to choose the company's profit.
However everyone here in Milone …

Lawrence:
I can't believe this.

Marlheit:
Calm down and think! Look, I can tell your companion must be very important to you.
But you cannot allow that to go to your head right now.
Might as well put the cart before the horse.

Lawrence:
You are right. I apologize.

Marlheit:
No need.
I don’t imagine I'd be able to keep my composure either, not if my wife was in the same situation
Still though, this is strange.
Medio Trading would also know full well what our decision would be in regards to helping you two. （know full well:十分知っている）

Lawrence:
That's true. 'Course they'd know.

Marlheit:
And yet they went after you, knowing it still wouldn't give them any leverage.
Why would they want the two of you, if they weren't going to get anything out of it?
Do you have any idea why they want you?

Lawrence:
No, none whatsoever. I don't know.

Marlheit:
In all truth, the profit margin we're looking at could be enormous.
I'd like to ensure this plan is going to succeed.

Lawrence:
Yes, I'm sure you would...

Marlheit:
If you think of anything, no matter how trivial, I'm asking you to please let me know.
Lawrence! If you have an idea, tell me what it is!


Assessor:
Excuse me, sir.

Marlheit:
Yes, what is it?

Assessor
We received a letter. It was thrown over the fence.
I think it has something to do with what's going on right now.

Marlheit:
It's to "the wolf and the forest where the wolf lives."

Lawrence:
Please give it to me. You can have it back. I just wanna read it first.

Marlheit:
Be my guest.

Lawrence:
I appreciate it.

"We have the wolf.
The door of the church is always open.
Keep the doors closed with those in the house so the wolf does not come in."

They have the girl who was with me. Her name is Holo.
She is an incarnation of the wolf who is known to bring a rich harvest.


Holo:
...It is you!
