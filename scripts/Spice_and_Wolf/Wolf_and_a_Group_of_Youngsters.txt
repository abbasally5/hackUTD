Nora:
Hello.

Lawrence:
Hello, Nora. I'd like you to meet our other collaborator.

Leibert:
My name is Martin Leibert, from Lemerio Trading.


Yes. Hello there. My name is Nora Arendt.


I think it's about time we get started.
Tell me, have you ever heard the saying "business is like raw fish in the kitchen"?

Lawrence:
Basically what the saying means is that unless we act quickly, it'll go bad.



Lemerio, do you think it'll go well?


I don't know, but if we fail, none of us will have a future.

Leibert:
Why are we stopping now? The sun hasn't even set yet.

Lawrence:
You must not travel with shepherds.

Leibert:
I'm going on ahead. I trust you will catch up with me quickly.

Nora:
Wait! Leibert!

Lawrence:
Oh, don't worry. I'll get him. 
He just doesn't know much about shepherds and dangers of traveling alone at night.

Holo:
Remember, he carries the burdens of Lemerio Trading on his shoulders.
It is only natural.

Lawrence:
The stars are beautiful out here.

Holo:
They are all right, I suppose; the stars from my homeland are much more beautiful though.

Lawrence:
Who would've thought we could have such a normal conversation in the midst of a situation like this?

Holo:
You realize we will not last, if we are tense the entire journey.

Lawrence:
Yeah, I guess you're right.
We're not taking the dangerous road until tomorrow anyway.


Leibert:
There's really no way of knowing what might show up out here.

Nora:
Even if wolves appear, please do not panic. I will not fail you. I promise we will get there safely. 

Leibert:
May God's grace be with us.

Lawrence:
Holo, do you think we'll be able to stay safe from the wolves in this wood?

Holo:
It is too late. We are already surrounded.

Lawrence:
Are you serious?

Holo:
Even if it were to happen, you should have more faith in me to guarantee our safety, although… beyond that I cannot make any promises.

Lawrence:
It'll be a problem if we are not all safe, you know.

Holo:
So you say, Lawrence, so you say.
You do realize the forest is downwind of us.
If there are wolves within it, they will have already noticed the sheep and are most likely sharpening their fangs by now.

Lawrence:
He is a very wise dog.

Holo:
Well, yes, which is all the more reason for me to be annoyed.

Lawrence:
What are you talking about?

Holo:
That dog of hers knows all about me and is threatening me! 

Lawrence:
Y-you really think so?

Holo:
Yes, I do, and he is foolishly forgetting his place.

Lawrence:
I wonder if Nora suspects anything as well.
If the smuggling fails, she will be the one who will suffer the most.
The rest of us can keep quiet and try to escape, but she won't be able to.

Holo:
Oh, good grief! You really are a sucker for blondes.

Lawrence:
I did tell you the ways in which they would punish her, didn't I?
She is so tiny; there's no way her body could withstand it.


Then you must protect her. You should use all your might so she will not suffer.

Lawrence:
Holo…


Lawrence:
With any luck, we won't have to deal with wolves at all.

Leibert:
What? Oh, right, wolves. I agree.

Lawrence:
She said if we leave at dawn, we should be able to get to Lamtra by noon.

Leibert:
And then it shall be my part in this small mission.
I should probably get some rest so I'm ready for it.

Lawrence:
I'll see you at dawn then.

Nora:
Lawrence, step back now, please!

Holo:
There is no reason for you to panic.

Nora:
You need to wake up. Please be careful!

Leibert:
Have they departed?

Nora:
No, not completely, but they have backed off a little.
The wolves in this forest always act the same way; they don't howl or show any other signs they are about to attack.
It almost seems as if they're just staring at us right now.

Holo:
I agree with you. It is strange to me they are not howling.


Nora:
Do you think that it's going to go well?

Lawrence:
Absolutely.

Nora:
Um, Holo, do you know a lot about wolves?
Well, it seemed to me. I mean you noticed the wolves very early on as well.
So I was just curious.

Holo:
Oh, yes. It is something like instinct.

Nora:
Instinct, really?

Holo:
It could have been because I was a little tense though.
You know, since the men around here are not very dependable.
Do you not agree with me?

Nora:
What? Um, I mean, uh, I don't think so, no.

Holo:
I see.
Then tell me, what do you think about this one?
Do not hold back. Feel free to say exactly what you are thinking.
Mmhmm...
You are indeed a very good judge of character.
I think it is rather odd to ask a woman who is traveling alone with a man if she knows a lot about wolves.

Nora:
Why is it strange?


If there is always a cute rabbit sitting in front of him, a wolf will be sure to make some sort of appearance every night.
Therefore, a rabbit who is eaten by a wolf every night should have a great understanding of wolves, should she not?

Nora:
Oh, I see. Yes, that makes sense. Oh, dear!

Holo:
What a great reaction! But in my case, it is the exact opposite.
My companion is a lonely rabbit who would die if you would not keep him company.
In any case, you can call it luck, but I just happened to notice the wolves were there early on.
That is all.


Yes, I see. I had started to wonder if you were a shepherd though.

Holo:
That is rather surprising.

Nora:
Enek had been keeping his eye on you quite a bit, so it seemed to make sense.

Holo:
Ah--he is probably in love with me.

Nora:
What? You mean Enek is in love with you?

Holo:
Now, I assume you must cherish your dog a great deal. Am I right?
Because of that, he is most likely thinking your affection for him is secure at the moment.
He must have gotten greedy and wanted to play with someone else.
What a naughty boy he is!
If you are cold to him sometimes, it should help towards keeping him in line.

Nora:
That's good advice.
If he thinks about cheating on me again I promise I'll go ahead and give it a try.


Good for you.


In the meantime, I believe I'll praise him as much as I can.
After all, in my case, it really doesn't matter if this job goes well or not.
Either way, taking this job will forever end my life as a shepherd, won't it?

Holo:
See? You have to admit to me now, you did not give her enough credit.

Lawrence:
Fine. You win.


Lawrence:
So, it went well?

Nora:
I'm so glad. After seeing your face I started to worry.

Leibert:
Why? What's wrong with my face?

Lawrence:
Considering the amount of money you're carrying, it's natural (to) be nervous.

Leibert:
Now I'm embarrassed. Let's get going, shall we?
Our future is waiting for us, and it's shinning as brightly as this gold.

Leibert:
This cannot be it. This is the same road we took before?
It does kind of seem different now, doesn't it?

Nora:
Enek!
I'm sorry, but we need to move faster!

Lawrence:
They're here.

Holo:
Correct. There are more on that hill too.

Leibert:
Oh, God! Tell me we're going to be okay.

Nora:
We'll be fine, but I do still need you to hurry, please!
Enek, go!

Holo:
She is a very good deal.
If we can keep moving this fast, the wolves will not attack.

Lawrence:
Think you can elaborate on that?

Holo:
Wolves will never attack in a way so just one of a group will get injured.
Carefully and cunningly, they target the entire prey by slowly surrounding them.

Nora:
Enek!

Holo:
But in this formation, we would have the capability to at least strike back at one of them.
If we can keep this up, we will be able to survive.
Wolves never attack alone.
Get ready!

Lawrence:
Get ready?
Here goes nothing!

Holo:
Back off!
I have heard humans say the phrase "young people these days."
I feel the same way about the wolves in this forest.

Leibert:
Hey, are we out of it now? Nora, are we okay?

Nora:
I'm not sure. I'm doing my best to keep us safe!

Leibert:
"Doing your best"!


Holo:
Listen to me, Lawrence. I am the one who has to take care of the trouble here.
Once we let that girl and that brat go on ahead, I want you to stay here for a while with me.

Lawrence:
What? I don't understand. Why now?

Holo:
I did tell you they were strange wolves, did I not?
If I handle them now, the group will not pursue the sheep.
After all, the sheep are not their target.
Cheap stubbornness, crude pride--both of which these ridiculous youngsters value.
Lawrence, they are not going to go, if you do not talk to them.
Communication is important, right?

Lawrence:
Nora, Leibert, we'll take care of things here.
You two go ahead; proceed with the gold as planned.

Nora:
No, we can't!

Leibert:
Come on. Let's just do what they want!

Holo:
We will meet at the city walls of Lubinheigen.
The next time we see you, we will all be rich.

Leibert:
God be with you.

Holo:
I want you to keep a safe distance from here. If you are even a little too close, I will be worried.
Do you understand?

Lawrence:
You should know I won't forgive you if you lose.

Holo:
If you were actually a good-looking male, I would kiss you right now.
Oh, yes. Please keep this with you for me.
I would like to settle this peacefully, if it all possible, but I do not know for sure what will happen.
If I am naked when we join them again, it could be problematic.

Lawrence:
I will see you soon.

Leibert:
We can't stop now, Nora. Listen to me. Are you going to allow their deaths to be for nothing?

Nora:
Did you say deaths?

Leibert:
Pardon me. In order to repay their courage, we should keep moving.


Holo:
Well, go ahead. You might as well tell me what you want.
Is that really all you have to say?
Kids these days are all the same; you all bare your fangs immediately.


Lawrence:
Holo!

Man #1:
Hello. Are you the one they call Lawrence?

Lawrence:
That's... my name.

Man #2:
So you did survive. Leibert didn't think you would.

Man #3:
We've been waiting for you and your companion outside the forest just in case.
But we decided we can't sit around and waste any more of our time.

Lawrence:
All this for me? Since the rain kept getting heavier, I found somewhere dry to take cover for the moment.

Man #2:
So Lawrence, where's your partner?

Lawrence:
She's not here.

Man #2:
Oh, good. That's a relief.

Man #1:
I'm not gonna say "don't take it personally," but this is just business.

Lawrence:
It's Lemerio Trading! They're betraying me, right?

Man #2:
Call it insurance.
We were initially a little reluctant when we found out you were with a woman.
We are all glad she's not with you anymore.

Man #1:
I know this isn't much of an excuse, but in this economy we are all suffering, we've been forced to eliminate any risk, no matter what it may be.

Lawrence:
What, did you think I was gonna blackmail you?

Man #3:
Anyone would be blinded from that amount of money.
It's called common sense in the business world.

Man #2:
I'll give you back your companion's memento.
I really hate to say it, but I'm not bothered too much by knowing I'll never see you again.
It depresses me more to think about what we're gonna have to do after we finish with you.

Man #1:
Stop it!

Man #2:
You feel the same way.

Man #1:
But still, she is someone who was brought in by him.

Lawrence:
Nora!

Man #1:
That was your fault. You should have kept still.

Man #2:
What if we just tied that girl up instead, we can bring her here and leave her with him.
Let the wolves take care of them both!

Man #1:
You idiot. Haven't you heard that she uses pagan witchcraft?
We could blindfold her and tie her up, but she'd still probably survive.
If that happens, then we'll be the ones who'll have to suffer.

Man #2:
Do you think you'll be able to stomach it? Do you think you could kill her?

Man #1:
Don’t say it.

Man #2:
Sorry.

Man #2:
Do you think we'll need to finish him?

Man #1:
Maybe we should.

Man #2:
No! The less we have to kill, the better it is.

Man #1:
Agreed.

Man #2:
Let's go. We'd better hurry or we'll hear about it from Leibert.

Man #3:
I'm sure his companion is dead by now anyway.
