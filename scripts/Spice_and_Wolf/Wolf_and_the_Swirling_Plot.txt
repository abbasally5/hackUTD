Jacob:
 There's only one reason you'd come here so early.
 You must be doing serious business today. Do you need a certificate?
Lawrence:
Yes, please.

Jacob:
I hope you'll end up becoming a merchant whose name alone will make people flinch.

Lawrence:
Yeah, so do I.
Oh! And by the way, is there anyone at the trading house that might wanna go to Lamtra?

Jacob:
Oh, no! Say it isn't so.
Tell me you didn't fall for that shepherd girl.

Lawrence:
It's not like that.

Jacob:
Well, she is the only one who comes back safe from that area.
I don't need to tell you how the church feels about her, do I?
If you don't want to be dragged into a damn complicated mess, stay away from her.
Although when you think about it, that fairy girl Nora is definitely your type.

Lawrence:
No, she is not.

Jacob:
So do you want the recipient's name on the certificate or not?

Lawrence:
On it. Go ahead and make it out to Lemerio Trading.

Jacob:
Are you saying you already have a buyer? Did you purchase this on credit?

Lawrence:
Yeah. Is that a problem?

Jacob:
I guess you'll find out.

Lawrence:
What do you mean? Did they drop the price or something?

Jacob:
Nah. Don't worry about it.
It's you so I'm sure everything will turn out just fine.

Lawrence:
Okay.

Jacob:
Either way you need to wait to spend your money on women until later.
You go through all that trouble and then it's gone in no time.

Lawrence:
If I didn't get anything in return, I wouldn't invest.

Jacob:
Look who's turning into a hotshot.
Here's the certificate.

Lawrence:
Thank you very much.
All right then, I'm off. Wish me luck.


Lawrence:
Holo, sorry to keep you waiting.

Holo:
They were quite sweet. They told me I was just like a pretty little snowdrop.

Lawrence:
Yeah, well those kind of guys are just like starving dogs.
They're preying on what they think is weak.

Holo:
Well I am not weak, plus I have you to rescue me anyway.
Am I not right?

Lawrence:
Yeah, I guess if I felt like it.

Holo:
Although the only one doing any rescuing recently has been me.
Now, then. I have no idea what it is you are expecting in return.
I would still like for you to invest in me though.

Lawrence:
Uh... you heard that, huh?

Holo:
I did not know you liked blondes.
So you like her gangly appearance?
Or is it that she is having such a hard time?
Or are you just into shepherds?

Lawrence:
Hold on a sec! Jacob was being funny, that's how he is!
I mean it's not like…

Holo:
Not like what?

Lawrence:
Well, it's true that Nora is very pretty. It's also true that I, well, I like talking to her but that's all.
It's not like that'll end up making me not like you anymore.
Please don't get all sensitive! Okay?

Holo:
Okay. I was just trying to tease you a little bit, that is all.
However… I never thought that I would hear that from you.
Thank you. I'm so glad.

Lawrence:
Holo.

Holo:
But men will say anything to get their way.　　　[get their way:思い通りにする]

Lawrence:
That may be true with other men, but I am a merchant. My word is my bond.

Holo:
I have heard knights sometimes leave their shields and swords on the hands of others to show their sincerity.
What would you do, as a merchant?

Lawrence:
All right then, to show my sincerity, I'll buy you honey-pickled peaches.

Holo:
What did you say you would buy for me?

Lawrence:
You know everything doesn't have to be a game all the time with you!

Holo:
You were the one that told me to ask you in a cute way, silly.

Lawrence:
No, I wanted you just to ask me! Not play games!

Holo:
But I was cute, was I not?
I was only trying to make things more exciting. They were starting to get rather boring. Do you not agree?
Please do not be upset with me, Lawrence. It is true that I felt happy.
Does that not matter to you at all?

Lawrence:
Okay, fine. I get it, I get it. I'm not upset. Are you happy now?

Holo:
We should not get separated, so I think we should hold hands.

Lawrence:
All right. Wouldn't want that to happen.

Holo:
Running a business can get pretty scary, am I right?
One must be intelligent to make money, yet if they allow it to go to their head, one can also fall victim to their own schemes.
Then they will end up selling their arms at half price just like Latparon Trading.　　[ go to their head: 自信過剰になる]

Lawrence:
But we're smarter than that.
By transporting arms without investing anything like we've done, we can make a lot of money.
The sooner the better.

Holo:
Really. That is all well and good but I do not like being in debt. [that is all well and good but : まあ、それはいいとしても]
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

Lawrence:
Do you mean buying on credit?

Holo:
Yes. You bought 100 Lumiones worth of weapons at half the price, but technically you borrowed that money from him, right?

Lawrence:
Yeah. I'll sell them at full price to Lemerio Trading and the difference will take care of my debt.
You see, they'll buy them at the wholesale price which is two times what I paid so I'll end up making twice as much.
I know you don't like it but, come on, you have to admit it's worth it.

Holo:
Yes, well, I suppose.


Holo:
It seems that this place should be run by a monk.

Lawrence:
If that were the case, we would've heard a prayer or two.
I'm curious. Can you hear anything besides the sound of you eating my meat pie?

Holo:
Your sarcasm is appreciated, but if you actually want an answer, I can tell you I do hear what sounds like people inside.

Lawrence:
Are you serious?

Holo:
Yes. But it is a dangerous atmosphere--well, it is not a fun atmosphere at least.

Lawrence:
Hesitating isn't gonna get me anywhere. I mean I'm not gonna make any money unless I go in.

Holo:
Like meat pies are not nutritious unless you eat them?

Lawrence:
That is my meat pie, y'know.

Holo:
Oh! You should have said something sooner. Here.


Lawrence:
Is it a holiday or something? Why isn't anyone here?
It's not the Sabbath yet?

Man:
Yeah, well, it's complicated.
Did you get into town today?

Lawrence:
Oh no, we got here a few days ago.
I had things to do.

Man:
Uh, okay. Well you look like someone important.

Lawrence:
I'm not. I guess I'll be on my way then.
We'll come back tomorrow.

Man:
In that case I'm sure to see you next time. Till then, Craft Lawrence!
I knew it had to be you. These must be the weapons from Latparon Trading, right?

Lawrence:
How did you know that?

Man:
A post horse messenger came here from Poroson.
Latparon Trading just transferred a debt to us. They transferred your debt.

Lawrence:
They did what?

Holo:
What is going on?

Man:
Sorry to tell you, but your friend's business has failed; now he's just like us.

Holo:
What do you mean?

Man:
The arms market collapsed a while ago; your weapons are worth almost nothing.
Latparon let him borrow money towards worthless stock and then transferred the rights to our company.
Pretty much all he's got in that cart is a huge debt.
Your friend is bankrupt, lady.

Holo:
Lawrence.

Lawrence:
He tricked me!



Part B


Lemerio:
We both make our livings on these kinds of arrangements. You understand that, right?

Lawrence:
Of course I do, Lemerio. We are merchants after all.

Lemerio:
You obtained exactly 100 Lumiones' worth of weaponry at Latparon Trading.
Out of that purchase, forty-seven and three-quarters Lumiones have been applied to your credit with a payment deadline.
I would appreciate being paid promptly.
Otherwise I will insist your debt be assumed by Lohen Merchant Association of which you are a member.

Lawrence:
I see.

Lemerio:
Your deadline will be the day after tomorrow; I can give you two days but no more.
You will need to pay back the forty-seven and three-quarters Lumiones in full by then.
Have I made myself perfectly clear?

Lawrence:
You have. And I will sell those weapons somehow.
Thank you so very much for your time. I'll see you in two days then.

Lemerio:
Good.

Lawrence:
I'll get you your money.

Lemerio:
Let me give you a little information, just in case.
Our street stalls can be easily found around the town exits in case something should happen.
Feel free to stop by anytime, if you need us.

Lawrence:
Thank you for your offer but I'm sure I'll be fine.
I hope the rest of your day today is profitable.

Lemerio:
The feeling is mutual. May God's grace be with you.


Lawrence:
Sorry 'bout that.

Holo:
Hey, so …

Lawrence:
What?

Holo:
To be more precise, what happened back there?

Lawrence:
To be more precise, everything back there is garbage.

Holo:
Oh! I was hoping I had misheard.

Lawrence:
You did not.
We're gonna end up being bankrupt.

Holo:
Shall we run?

Lawrence:
The information network among merchants might as well be God's.
No matter where we went, I'd be found in no time, if I was doing business, so I would never be able to be a merchant again.

Holo:
Some are going to take it for granted, but an animal once wounded will not always die.
Will you let this wound overtake you?

Lawrence:
No, absolutely not! What I'll do is find that money one way or another and throw it right back in their face.
I've still got time to start over.

Holo:
I am Holo the wise wolf and I am sure I will be of some help to you.

Lawrence:
Yeah, actually saving on your food alone will be a really big help.

Holo:
I have told you I will earn my food.

Lawrence:
I was just kidding.

Holo:
Very funny. But I promise you, if you need it, I will help you escape.
Even if I have to use the power of wheat.
You promised me you will take me to my home in the north.
I could not take it if you stumbled in a place like this.

Lawrence:
I know. I will keep that promise. I will.
If it comes down to it, I might really need your help.

Holo:
Mm-hm. Of course you will.

Lawrence:
Well then, I need to stop by the trading house, so you can just wait at the inn.

Holo:
Do I look like an ungrateful wolf to you?
Do I look as if I wish to relax and groom myself at the inn while you are in trouble?

Lawrence:
I never said that!

Holo:
Answer me!

Lawrence:
Holo, of course not.
But that's really not the point.

Holo:
Then what is your point exactly?

Lawrence:
The trading house is like a hometown for me and if I take a woman there, they'll tease us and make a big deal out of it.
[make a big deal:大騒ぎする]

Holo:
Then you can explain the situation.

Lawrence:
And how would you like me to do that?
If they report you to the church, it's not gonna make anything easier.

Holo:
So why do you not tell them we are in love or married or something?

Lawrence:
Okay then. You can come with me.
After all, you're certainly wittier than I could ever be.

Holo:
Yes. Count on me.

Lawrence:
And I think I'll tell them you're an associate; just don’t say anything you don’t have to.
And one more thing: their welcome is a little rough.

Holo:
Do not worry about me.


Jacob:
Okay. First I need to ask you: who's this lovely girl you brought with you today?

Lawrence:
We've been traveling together for business reasons.

Jacob:
Huh, that the truth?

Holo:
Mm-hm.

Lawrence:
Milone Trading in Pazzio offered 140 Trenni silver coins for some furs I had, but she got them to go higher.
They ended up paying 210.

Jacob:
What?

Lawrence:
I told you. If I'm going to invest in a girl …

Jacob:
You'll get something back. I see.
I know your type well, but luckily the Scriptures also tell us not to open a mysterious box carelessly.

Holo:
Which is quite wise.

Jacob:
Now, let's get to it. So I have a general idea of what happened.
One of the Lemerio Trading employees came by earlier to inquire about us assuming the debt they have with you.　
The gist is you failed because you simply got too greedy. Is that right?

Lawrence:
Basically.

Jacob:
Then it's quite simple.
The association is most likely going to have to assume your bad debt, which means you'll have to repay us on your own.
If you had fallen victim to fraud, been robbed or were sick or injured, things would be different.
We could have helped you with your debt then, but we can't help you with your own greed
If God cannot help you, then it seems the only one who can is this young girl.

Lawrence:
I'm well aware.

Jacob:
I am sorry. Unfortunately I can't show you any mercy. I stand by the rules, no matter what, which is the reason I'm in this position.
My concern is the entire association.

Lawrence:
I understand. If someone else was being given special treatment, I know that I'd get upset as well.

Jacob:
Loans between association members are not allowed either.

Lawrence:
Yes, I know.

Jacob:
The debt repayment is in two days, right?
The pressure's on Lemerio too, due to their failed investment in arms.
They probably wanna correct immediately, which means your failure will become public knowledge day after tomorrow and I'll be forced to physically restrain you.
Do you understand the severity of what I'm telling you?

Lawrence:
Yes, I understand. Unless I can collect 47 gold Lumiones, I won't have a tomorrow.

Jacob:
No, you will still have a tomorrow. You will definitely have one. But this one will be cold. It'll be dark. It'll be very difficult.
If we're looking at a forty-seven Lumione debt, you can probably repay that, if you row a long-distance trade ship for about ten years.
You could also dig holes in a mine, but that's if you're lucky and actually stay alive.

Lawrence:
No one could be that lucky.

Jacob:
I know this is hard. And I know it doesn't mean much, but I don't want you to die.
Sins get punished, and at the end of the day I still have to do the right thing.

Lawrence:
Yes, I know.

Jacob:
Do the best you can in these next few days
If you need me, I'll assist you in any way I can. I have faith in you, Lawrence.
Go. Take this time you have to do as much as possible.

Lawrence:
Thank you for being so kind. I don't know how, but I'll make this money within two days.

Jacob:
There're always loopholes when it comes to business, and I'm sure that some of them can only be seen when you're cornered.
Do you have any more questions for me? Anything else I can help you with?

Lawrence:
No, we don't. Thank you.
No, wait.
I need a clever line to give them--something to say when I throw the money back in their face.

Jacob:
Keep talking like that and you'll be fine. Good luck, kid.


Lawrence:
Forty-seven Lumiones in two days.

Holo:
So, what are you going to do?

Lawrence:
Repay my debt with a debt, I guess.

Holo:
Can you turn to anyone?

Lawrence:
Well, I'm not known for running my business irresponsibly.
I don't know anyone in particular who would loan me a large sum of money, but there are several who might be willing to help me out with a little here and there.

Holo:
If there are 47 of them, you will have the money in no time.

Lawrence:
Exactly.


Merchant 1:
Lawrence, it's been a while, hasn't it? You have any money-making ideas?

Lawrence:
Well, actually …

No problem. There're plenty of others.

Merchant 2:
Unfortunately we are too busy right now. I'm sorry.

Merchant 3:
Hopefully prices for wheat and meat will also rise towards to the end of the year…

Lawrence:
Oh well, moving on I guess.

Holo:
How did it go?

Lawrence:
There's still the next person.

Holo:
Yes, of course.

Merchant 4:
We're actually right in the middle of inventory right now…

Merchant 5:
I'm sorry but we can't.

Holo:
Uh, okay. So?

Lawrence:
Damn! Why? Why did I have to make such a stupid deal? Damned idiot!

Holo:
Lawrence?

Lawrence:
It's nothing. I've still got the next one.

What about this place? No, they won't work.

Holo:
Hey, wait. Wait for me!

Lawrence:
What is it?

Holo:
Please forgive me, but I cannot walk as freely as you in this form.

Lawrence:
You're right. I'm sorry

Merchant 6:
It's been too long, Lawrence.

Lawrence:
Yes, it's been a while and I know that we haven't done business since some time, but I have a huge favor to ask you.

Merchant 6:
I've heard that you've been begging for loans all over the place. Is it because of the collapse in the arms market?

Lawrence:
It is. I made an optimistic projection which turned out to be off.

Merchant 6:
Optimistic projection?
Well, that was part of it. What could you do? A market collapse couldn’t possibly be predicted by anybody but God.　
It would be unfair to blame only yourself.
My friend, you've helped me make money plenty of times, so I thought I would be able to help you if you ever ended up in trouble.

Lawrence:
Really?

Merchant 6:
But your attitude is not that of one who is living an honest life under God as well as being sincere to others.
Especially your friends.

Lawrence:
Wait. What? What do you mean?

Merchant 6:
Don't mock me, Lawrence!
If you're really that desperate for money from everyone, then how can you afford to still walk around with a woman?

Coachman:
Idiot! You're in the middle of the street! What are you doing?

Lawrence:
I don’t get it! Why is this happening to me? Why now?

Holo:
Wait. Lawrence, are you okay? Let's go to the inn. You are so pale. Please …

Lawrence:
It's your fault!
I'm sorry.

Holo:
I will be at the inn.
