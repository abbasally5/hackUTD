  Flight Attendant:
Ladies and gentleman, we have begun our descent into Tokyo's Haneda International Airport.
Please move your seat backs into their full and upright position...

Akira:
Did I wake you?
 Good morning.
 Look. Remember the missile attack we saw on TV at the airport?
 That must be where it happened.

Saki:
Yeah, must be.

Akira:
Looks like there's a bunch of spots just like it that aren't on fire.
 You think they're from missile attacks, too?

Saki:
Hm?
 Well, yeah. They sure are.

Akira:
Really?

Saki:
See those two craters right there?
 They're what's left over from the Careless Monday attacks.

Akira:
"Careless Monday"?
News Reporter:
Due to the recent attacks, security checkpoints at Customs and Immigration are on high alert...

Saki:
Come to think of it, today's Monday.

憂鬱な月曜日
Episode 2"
Melancholy Monday

Saki:
Every text is from Osugi.
 It's already three o'clock...
 There's no way I can make the interview now.

Akira:
They're saying a plane was shot down by a missile.
 By some miracle, a six-year-old boy and girl survived.
 But everyone else...

Saki:
No way!
 One of those missiles actually killed people?

Akira:
Yeah.

Saki:
I can't believe this.
 Last time, nobody died.

Akira:
Huh?

Saki:
That explains why the airport is so crazy today.

Akira:
Wait, say that again.
 You said no one died last time?

Saki:
Yeah. On Careless Monday, there wasn't a single casualty.

Akira:
Why not?

Saki:
What do you mean "why not?"
 ...hey, what's up?





Osugi:
Ah, Saki! Finally!
 Are you inside the terminal?

Hirasawa:
Sounds like her flight landed on time.

Osugi:
Mm-hm.
 Yeah, we're all hanging in there.
 And your sister's place didn't get any damage either.
 Yeah. So, uh, today's your final interview, right?
 We're here in the car waiting to pick you up.
 Uh-huh. That's right.

Hirasawa
Osugi.
 You do realize in this traffic, there's no way we could make it in time?

Osugi:
Shhh!
 No, it's fine! Uh, just stay where you are, we'll be right there.
 Ah, Saki?
 The call dropped. Must be because of the missiles.

Michhon:
I doubt it.

Osugi:
Does anyone else have something they'd like to add?

Hirasawa:
You know the two of you seem to be getting close.
 Did you guys bond during your trip to America, or something?

Osugi:
Oh crap, the car's completely full - where's Saki gonna sit?!





Akira:
Boyfriend?

Saki:
Mm-mm. Huh?
 Sounds like your phone's ringing.

Akira:
Hello?

Juiz:
This is Juiz.

Akira:
Hey.

Juiz:
Number 9, you have entered the operating range of the Seleção system.
 Please resume fulfilling your obligations as one of the "haves" immediately.

Akira:
One of the "haves"? I don't...
 Juiz, what do you mean?

Saki:
Juiz?
 Uh, hi there. This is Saki Morimi calling.
 Can you connect me to Yamada from Human Resources?

Akira:
Listen, I have no idea what you're talking about.
 If you know why I wiped my memory, could you do me the favor of filling me in?

Juiz:
I don't know why.
 I merely acquire the means for you to do so.
 If you have any further questions or requests,
 don't hesitate to contact me at any time.
 Your remaining balance is: 8,262,307,719 yen.

Akira:
8.2 billion?!

Juiz:
It is your duty to spend it all in the course of your mission.

Akira:
Hold on.
 I have to spend it?

Juiz:
That's correct.
 I am your concierge, and I will strive to serve you to the best of my ability.

Akira:
Or in other words, I can request anything I want and you'll make it happen.
 No questions asked.

Juiz:
Yes. That is correct.

Akira:
'Kay then, I'm stuck here at the airport and it's a madhouse.
 I want to get out of here ASAP.
 What can you do for me?

Juiz:
Order accepted.
 Noblesse oblige. I pray for your continuing service as a savior.

Akira:
So I'm Number 9, then?

Man:
Watch out people.
Move aside! Clear a path!

Saki:
What's this?




Police Scanner:
APB on a 24-year-old male, unemployed;
suspected of being involved in the disappearance of the NEETs.
He is wanted for questioning.

Kondo:
Right.
 No employment, education, or training.
 Good riddance, I say.
 Perfect, now what?
 Number 9?
 What the hell? That's a bribe, clear as day!
 A pack of gum, too?
 This guy's getting careless.
 Wait a second...




Woman:
Thank you. Have a wonderful day!

Akira:
So I can buy anything with this phone...
 Thanks everyone!

Saki:
I've never been so embarrased in my life!
 I guess they must have you mixed-up with someone else.
 Unless you are a celebrity. You're not, right?

Akira:
I don't know.

Saki:
 Hey, Takizawa?

Akira:
Hm?

Saki:
I was wondering if you had plans later?

Akira:
No.

Saki:
Well, I'm supposed to meet with someone today, but that's not gonna happen.
 So, I have the afternoon off. We could get a cup of tea.
 I mean, if you're up to it.

Akira:
Ahh.
 So, uh, this is gonna sound weird, but...
 See, I have a confession to make.
 I have what you would call "amnesia".

Saki:
Huh?

Akira:
Whatever happened to me before the White House is a total mystery.
 I don't know my name, what I've been doing, where I've been, or how I got to D.C..
 So, it might be best if I found out some answers about myself first.
 I think I'll start by going to the address that's listed on my passport.
 So I guess this is goodbye, then.
 Bye!

Saki:
Aw...





Kondo:
Here I was thinking Number 9 was dead this whole time.
 Of course, it's very possible someone just picked up his phone.
 Though I can't see some random person off the street knowing how to use it.




Saki:
Hmm!
 No fair.
 I really believed the two of us were hitting it off.
 Oh.
 My face... maybe I just didn't smile enough?
 Aw.

Akira:
I thought your smile was perfect!

Saki:
Huh?!

Akira:
Hey!

Saki:
What the...?
 You can't come in here!

Akira:
I just... need some directions, that's all.

Kondo:
Looks like Number 9 just waltzed into the monorail.
 I think it's time to get a look at this guy's face.




Saki:
Ah!

Akira:
What is it?

Saki:
I just found the address listed in your passport.
 It's right where a missile hit on Carless Monday.
 I'm pretty sure that whole area is destroyed.

Akira:
Doesn't sound like my house has much of a chance of being there.

Saki:
Hmm.

Akira:
So, tell me about these missile craters.
 How many are there, anyway?
 Does anyone know why we were attacked in the first place?

Saki:
I think there were 11 missiles total, counting yesterday's.
 No one knows why it happened,
 but out of the blue on Monday, Novemeber 22nd of last year, the missiles came flying.
 The military and politicians were blindsided.
 No one ever dreamed Japan would be the victim of a surprise attack like this.
 The following night, the Prime Minister went on live television and said, "I was careless."

Akira:
So that's why they call it "Careless Monday".

Saki:
Yeah.
 And afterwards, when the news broke that somehow there were no fatalities in the attacks,
 the Internet and the media went into a frenzy trying to figure out who was behind it.
 There were all sorts of crazy theories, like it being an American conspiracy,
 or the one about our own government having a hand in it.
 But after a while, when no answers came, people stopped asking questions.
 Everyone went back to life as usual.
 It seems stupid now, but a lot of us were actually... anxious when it happened.
 Like it was a sign that something bigger was coming.

Train Operator:
Next stop, Tennoz Isle.



Kondo:
Where'd you go, Number 9?
 I was right.
 Damn it! He should still be here.
 Lost him.

Akira:
Hey.
 You and I have the same exact phone.
 Let me ask you something.
 Did you lose your memory, too?

Kondo:
Huh?
 Excuse me?

Akira:
Sorry! Thought you were someone else.
 Your phone just happened to catch my eye, that's all.
 Take care, now.

Kondo:
Hey, wait. Not so fast, kid.
 Are you a Seleção?

Akira:
Seleção?

Kondo:
I'm with the police.
 I'm sure you've probably noticed the tight security.
 I'd like to see your identification.

Akira:
Sure, no problem.

Kondo:
Akira Takizawa.
 It says here you live in Toyosu.
 Well then.
 If I see you acting suspicious again, I'll haul your ass in, you got it?

Akira:
I'll try to be more careful.
 Thanks, officer!

Kondo:
So that's Seleção Number 9.
 This is not good.




Akira:
You can head back once the boat gets here.
 I'll be fine on my own.
 Here's your coffee, and your change.
 760 yen.

Saki:
Thanks.
 You can keep the change.
 You don't have any cash, right?

Akira:
Yeah, right. Thanks!

Saki:
I hope your house is still in one piece.

Akira:
Hm? Yeah, me too.
 But if it's not, I'm sure I'll figure something out.
 Since I don't have anything useful to say,
 why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself?

Saki:
About myself?

Akira:
We may as well talk about something until the boat gets here, right?

Saki:
Hmm.
 I'm a senior in college.
 And I, uh... I hope to find a job sometime in April.

Akira:
Hey, that sounds exciting.
 Where at?

Saki:
At the company that my brother-in-law used to work for.

Akira:
So, you have an older sister?

Saki:
Mm-hm.
 Well, uh, it'll come up sooner or later, so I'll just tell you.
 My parents...
 There was an accident and... and they died.
 My sister had just gotten married when it happened.
 I thought I'd have to drop out of college and start working,
 but she and her husband ended up taking over the family business.
 So I could finish college.

Akira:
She sounds really nice.

Saki:
So is Ryosuke.
 He's my amazing brother-in-law!
 They had a baby last year and now the four of us all live together.

Akira:
So what's this Ryosuke guy like?

Saki:
Huh?
 Ah! You're putting too much pressure on me!
 Ryosuke is probably the most sincere person I know.
 They've been a couple ever since my sister was in college.
 I remember the first time I saw them together, I know they'd get married.

Akira:
He sounds cool.

Saki:
I guess so.
 He's definitely compatible with my sister.

Akira:
That's good.
 You have a nice family.

Saki:
Yeah, but my life is far from perfect.
 I feel guilty for being such a burden on them.

Akira:
I see.
 Guess what?
 I think listening to you now triggered one of my memories to come back.
 Huh.

Saki:
Really?

Akira:
I was five, and some lady at a department store gave me 500 yen.
 She said I could use the money to buy whatever I wanted to.
 When I hesitated about doing it alone, she told me,
 "There's no reason to worry. Remember, if you have money in your pocket,
 a little kid isn't any different than an adult."
 I can't recall what it was that I bought that day, but I still have an image in my head -
 the cashier bowing to me when I paid him, which I thought was the coolest thing ever.
 I felt like the happiest kid in the world.
 I can remember turning around to tell my mom that she was right when I...
 Of course, my mom was the lady!
 Anyway, when I turned around to tell my mom, she had disappeared.
 I think that was the last time I ever saw her.

Saki:
Oh no!

Akira:
Well, at least I remember having a mother, so that's a good sign.

Akira:
So long.

Saki:
Wait, I... I don't even know how to get in touch with you.




Kondo:
I'll take another double.
 Monorail, plum gum, a bribe at Immigration...
 got his brain nuked at the Harima Nueroscience Institute.
 That's strange. It seems like he went to a lot of trouble to try and erase his memory.
 I wonder why?
 Then there's activity at a shopping mall in Toyosu.
 I don't get it.
 What does any of this have to do with serving the country?
 Wow, I did find someone who's worse at their job than me.

Cook:
I see you're in a good mood for once!

Kondo:
Oh, I am.
 Looks like luck is finally starting to swing my way.

Man:
That's exciting news, Mr. Kondo.
Maybe now you can pay back the 20 million you owe me.
Of course, if you can find a way to misplace a certain piece of evidence,
I'll be able to look past this.





Saki:
Yeah.
 The airport was crazy!
 It took forever to get anywhere.
 Tomorrow I'll explain everything, okay?
 I'm gonna stay at Micchon's tonight.
 Sorry.

Akira:
So, you mentioned going to New York before, right?
 Did you walk down Fifth Avenue?

Saki:
I went to Tiffany's!
 But I didn't buy anything.
 Here's a picture I took of Times Square.
 I went to "The Lion King" that night.

Akira:
Ahh, so did you go anywhere else cool?

Saki:
Sure!
 I went to Central Park, and The Statue of Liberty, and I walked across the Brooklyn Bridge.

Akira:
That's the, uh, Gothic one, right?

Saki:
Yeah! How did you know that?

Akira:
I'm a bit of a film junkie.
 Right. This is the bridge with the time portal - in that Meg Ryan movie.

Saki:
Is it?
 Sorry, I don't watch a lot of movies.

Akira:
Oh.
 Well, what do you know. I thought all the girls had seen that one?
 It's kinda crazy how vivid my memory is for movies, and yet...

Saki:
Well, do you remember any others?
 You never know, it could trigger something.
 What's your favorite movie of all time?

Akira:
Uhh...
 It's weird. I remember dozens of 'em, except for my favorite.

Saki:
Oh well.

Akira:
Hey, what's this?

Saki:
That's a pic of the Freedom Tower.

Akira:
The Freedom Tower?

Saki:
 Yeah, you know. The new building they're putting up at Ground Zero.

Akira:
As in 9/11?
 Okay... I don't think they've put this one into a movie yet.

Saki:
It was strange to see.
 It'll be pretty once it's done.
 I wanted to make a special trip to see Ground Zero,
 but it really doesn't look anything like it did 10 years ago.
 I think it's important to never forget what happened.
 I feel it's the least I can do.

Akira:
Hey, come here.

Saki:
Huh?

Akira:
Look.
 Ground Zero.

Saki:
 Think you could send this to me?

Akira:
Sure.
 Ah, I don't know how to!
 Here, show me.

Saki:
It's easy. See?




Man:
Mr. Kondo, if we keep having to go down this road,
you'll leave me no choice but to visit your workplace, which none of us want.

Kondo:
Whatever.
 Juiz, kill these assholes.

Juiz:
Understood.
 Noblesse oblige. I pray for your continuing service as a savior.

Kondo:
Yeah, yeah.

Man:
Trying to be funny?

Kondo:
 Today is the first day of my new life.

Man:
Sounds like someone's getting delusional.

Kondo:
Bang.

Man:
Uh?!

Kondo:
Bang.
 Yeah, and this one too, Juiz.
 Sorry, pal.
 Bang.
 Seems like a cop just can't do the right thing these days, even if he wants to.
 Well, whatever.
 Thank you, Number 9. I'm sure I'll make a better go of things once I've got your life.
