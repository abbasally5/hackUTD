  Hirasawa:
Okay. You're right, it does look like Eden's mascot.

Kakuga:
That confirms it.
That looks exactly like his bag.
And he's always had that charm on it.

Micchon:
This picture was taken today around noon.
"Help me!"
"Johnny Hunter."
"I'm gonna die."
"Hotel"?

Sis:
It's consistent with the legend.

Hirasawa:
Looks like the area the Johnny Hunter grabbed him in is pretty close to where Kasuga last saw him.
There's a lot of circumstantial evidence pointing toward this being Osugi.

Akira:
So, who's this "Johnny Hunter" you guys have been talkin' about?

Kasuga:
It's an urban legend that's been going around last few years.
There's this beautiful woman who lures innocent young virgins like us into hotel rooms.
And if they can't, you know, perform to her liking, then she slices off their johnny.
Some are claiming the number of her victims to be over 20,000.

Akira:
Twenty-thou?! [20,000]
Some coincidence.
You sure they're not just mixing 'em up with my 20,000?

Flight of the Black Swan


Sis:
I don't get it.
Why would he ask for help on a message board?
If this really is Osugi, don't you think he would at least try to contact one of us directly?

Kasuga:
This is a special forum made for lonely singles.
And Osugi is on here all the time.
He's been in a really fragile state recently, depressed about not having anyone in his life.
I'm afraid he let his guard down last night.
Then, in the desperate attempt to fill the void in his heart, he left with the first woman who would make eye contact with him.
I'm sure he's just filled with too much pride and embarrassment to call us for help!
Oh, poor Osugi!
I know exactly how he feels!

Akira:
So, who is this Osugi, anyway?

Kasuga:
The poor guy was drunk out of his mind.
If only I had taken him home after dinner last night, then none of this would have happened!

Saki:
You went to dinner? Was that for...?

Kasuga:
That's right! It was the date he was supposed to have with you, Saki, not me!

Sis:
Dumb-ass!

Akira:
Would you guys mind filling me in?

Micchon:
Look! A new image just uploaded.

Hirasawa:
It looks like a picture of his reflection in the window.
Is that what he was wearing? Look!

Kasuga:
Yeah, it's definitely him! I'm positive!

Micchon:
Hey, what is that?

Sis:
I think it's a piano.

Hirasawa:
Try running it through Eden's search engine!

Micchon:
It's a "Stanway Luis 15 Model M1150." Super-rare.
Japan purchased a few during the economical bubble.

Hirasawa:
Since we know the manufacturer and the model number, we can find out where it was purchased.
Way to go, Eden! I knew we could count on you!

Sis:
There's a new comment.
"Her accomplice's name is Juiz."
Who could that be?

Akira:
"Juiz"? No way...

Sis:
And where are you off to?

Akira:
I might have an idea where he's at.
So, I'm gonna check it out.

I need you to find me a piano in the area.
It's a "Stanway Luis 15 Model M1150."
It's had some repairs done to its legs.

Juiz:
Order received.

I've found it.
That piano is currently in room 1109 of the Hotel Insomnia in Roppongi.

Akira:
What name is the room booked under?

Juiz:
A woman by the name of Hanako Roppongi has occupied the room for over a year now.

Akira:
Sounds fake to me.
Can you find out her real name?

Hey, Juiz?

Juiz:
Yes?

Akira:
Are you familiar with the "Johnny Hunter"?

Juiz:
No. Would you like me to do some research?

Akira:
Nah, forget it.

Juiz:
I've got it. Her real name is Diana Kuroha Shiratori.
She is the CEO of Monolom, a talent agency for foreign models.

Akira:
Where is she right now?

Juiz:
Location confirmed.
She's currently traveling by car in Minato, near the main Roppongi Intersection.

Akira:
I bet that's right near the hotel.
Juiz, I need you to stop her for me.

Juiz:
Is there a specific method you'd like me to use?

Akira:
I don't care, the police? 
Whatever's the quickest, got it?

Juiz:
Order received. Noblesse oblige.
Even though you are now guilty of abusing state power, I still pray for your continuing service as a savior.

Kuroha:
What's wrong, officer?
I was going the speed limit.

Cop:
Evening, ma'am.
License and registration, please?

Kuroha:
Number 9 is trying to make contact with me.
But why?
I feel honored.

Cop:
Hey!
Get back here!

Kuroha:
Juiz, find me the motorcycle that went through the Kasumigaseki toll booth about fifteen minutes ago.

Saki:
Hello, Takizawa?

Akira:
Saki! Your friend Osugi, I know where to find him.

Saki:
Really?
Takizawa figured out where Osugi's being held.

Hirasawa:
What? You're kidding!
How'd he do that?

Sis:
Is he okay?

Akira:
He's in room 1109 of the Hotel Insomnia in Roppongi.
I'm just a few minutes away from there.
Talk to you soon.

Saki:
Hold on! Don't hang up!

Akira:
Huh?

Saki:
Thanks for your help.
But how were you able to find him?

Akira:
Waarrgh!!

Saki:
Takizawa? What's wrong? Are you okay?

Takizawa, what happened? Hello?!


Hirasawa:
He said Osugi's being held captive at the Hotel Insomnia, right?

Saki:
Mm-hm.

Sis:
I just got off with the front desk.
The guy said they're just way too busy to send someone up to the room.

Micchon:
Hey, check this out.

Kasuga:
That's on the way to Roppongi!

Akira:
There. Just try to get to your hotel room now.
If you wanna play dirty... then that's the way we'll play it!

Clerk:
Ah, Miss Roppongi.
I'm terribly sorry, but the ownership of the hotel has just changed hands.
Unfortunately, we're unable to grant access to the rooms at this time, and uh...
And I'm afraid I've been instructed to ask all guests to vacate the premises.
I tried knocking on the door to your room, but your companion isn't answering.
I wasn't sure if you would approve of me entering the room by myself, so I decided to wait for you.

Kuroha:
You made the right decision.

Number 9 paid 1.5 billion for this place?
What a colossal waste of money.
Now I own it.
But why did the price go up 200 million in five minutes?

You're a crafty one, aren't you?
We're running out of time.
Let's begin, shall we?

Akira:
I got it open, Juiz.
Though I may have thrown out my shoulder in the process.

Juiz:
Noblesse oblige.
You're such a violent savior!
I pray you will show more restraint in the future.

Akira:
Thanks for the advice, but now's not the best time for it.

So you're the Johnny Hunter?
Huh, you really are a Seleção... and good-looking too.
Not the type I would expect to go blowin' up tanker trucks and clippin' off men's johnnys for sport.

Kuroha:
Hmm, Number 9...you're just a baby!
I find it hard to believe you were the one behind the Careless Monday attacks.

Akira:
Wait, are you saying I was somehow involved with that, too?


Hirasawa;
It's no good. We're gonna be stuck here for a while.

Sis:
It looks like it's a pretty big wreck.
I hope Takky's doing okay...


Kuroha:
Who knows?
I must confess, I was hoping to get the chance to meet you some day.
It's too bad you have to be the Supporter.

Akira:
Hmm? You're wrong. I'm not the Supporter--I'm just another Seleção.
Plus, the only reason I'm here is to save him.
He's a friend of a friend of mine.

Kuroha:
You're friends with someone who knows this degenerate low-life?

Akira:
Well, from what I've heard, he's actually a stand-up guy.
Right, Osugi?

Hey, easy!

Kuroha:
Let's assume for the moment you actually are friends with this piece of garbage.
I will still have my way with him.
I feel my methods of mutilation are justified through my personal convictions.
I've felt this way long before I received this phone.
Not even the Supporter can stop me from reaching my goal.

Akira:
I told you I'm not the Supporter!
And how does a serial killer come into possession of a Noblesse phone, anyway?

Kuroha:
You got me. The only time I ever used it is to have Juiz hunt down these pigs for me.
Then once I'm done with it, she gets rid of the bodies.

Saki:
"Juiz gets rid of the bodies"?
What in the world are they talking about?

Hirasawa:
What's up, Saki?
Did you get a hold of Takizawa?

Saki:
Uh-uh.
I-I'm gonna go ahead on foot. See you there!

Kasuga:
Saki, wait!

Akira:
I guess Seleção come from all walks of life, huh?
You're so different from Dr. Hiura.
How do you expect to win this game if that's all you use Juiz for?

Kuroha:
For each pig I remove from this earth, I use my agency to replace them with a gentleman from overseas.
To be honest with you, I have no desire to win this game.
You can fight to change the world all you want, but you'll never get more than half the world to agree with your side.
Until I exhaust the last of my ten billion, I intend to carry out my own brand of justice.

Akira:
So, in order for me to get Osugi back, my only choice is to take you out first.

Kuroha:
I'm sorry I can't be more accommodating.

Akira:
Remind me; your name is Kuroha, right?
I'm curious, what was it that got you into johnny-snipping in the first place?
You have something against them?

Kuroha:
Yes I do.

Akira:
Well, there you go. I'll have to save you, too, 'cause I'm different from you.
See, I wanna win this game.
Giving a serial killer the chance to save the nation?
What has this country come to?
This Mr. Outside deserves a beating for the games he's playing.
Kuroha...
You were hurt by a man in the past, weren't you?

Kuroha:
And what makes you think that?

Akira:
I just get the feeling that you've never had true love from a johnny.


Saki:
Takizawa, who is it you're talking to?
And what is a Seleção?


Akira:
Aghh!

Kuroha:
I've often wondered.
But I'm not sure that it's even out there--the johnny that can give me love.
If it exists, I'd love to give it a try.

Saki:
Takizawa!
If you're there, say something!

Come on!
Come on, already!

Ah!

Kuroha:
Hi, there.

Saki:
What's going on?

Kuroha:
And you are... his girlfriend, perhaps?

Saki:
What happened to Takizawa?
Did you do something?

Kuroha:
Takizawa?
I've been taking good care of him, that's all.
Looks like you've got yourself a nice girl.
You'd better cherish every hair on his head.
He's a special guy.
Juiz, it's time. Do it.

Saki:
Hold on! That's my...

Kuroha:
Don't you worry, kid. This man has nothing to do with you.
He's a wanted serial rapist.
His life holds absolutely no value.
I wonder how you mistook him for your friend. How odd.
This is goodbye, Seleção Number 9.
We should meet again some time.

Saki:
Takizawa? Takizawa?!
What happened to you?
Takizawa, snap out of it!
