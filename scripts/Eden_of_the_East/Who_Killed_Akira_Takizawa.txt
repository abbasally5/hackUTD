  Saki:
What's up?

Akira:
I gotta run. Something just came up.

Micchon:
Saki?

Akira:
Bye.

Saki:
Takizawa!


第10話
誰が滝沢朗を殺したか
Episode 10
Who Killed Akira Takizawa?


Micchon:
What happened?
Why didn't Takky get on the train with us?

Saki:
I have no idea.


Akira:
You called me, didn't you?

Mononobe:
Daiju Mononobe.
I hear you'd like nothing more than to punch Mr. Outside.
Are your memories back?

Akira:
How'd you hear that? Did Itazu tell you?

Mononobe:
Mm-hm.
He had good things to say about you - he called you a hero.
But can you still live up to those expectations?

Akira:
Expecta...?
Wait, what are you talking about?

Mononobe:
Your memories haven't returned then, nor have you read the past logs.
Perhaps I've overestimated your abilities.
I intend to go to Harima Science Garden City and become the winner at this game.

Akira:
Oh, yeah? Hold on, what number are you?
I don't remember noticing any Seleção spending money like they thought they were about to win the whole thing.

Mononobe:
I'm Number 1.
But there's no need to panic.
I'll make it so you can finish the game too.
Now then, will you come with me?
If you do, I'll tell you everything you want to know: 
The truth behind that phone and the reason you erased your memories.

Saki:
Takizawa, what happened?

Akira:
Um, I have some urgent business. I'll call you later, okay?
Bye.

Saki:
Hold on! Don't hang up!
I know... I know about your phone.
I know that it can do things a regular phone can't.
Remember that night we thought Osugi'd been kidnapped? I found you inside that hotel room unconscious with a strange woman.
Leading up to that, you had left your phone line open, so I listened in and I heard everything you said.
I saw something truly bizarre happen in the room that night.
And I know that woman used her phone to do it.
It was the same kind of phone you have.
Be straight with me, Takizawa.
The "Seleção" are the terrorists behind Careless Monday, aren't they?
Are you connected to them in any way?

Micchon:
Yeah. Yeah. Give me a sec.
Yeah, I'll call you right back.

Saki:
Takizawa, tell me.
Who are you?

Akira:
I see where you're coming from. I do.
Even I think it sounds suspicious.
But my identity is still a mystery to me.
And that's the truth, I swear.
Anyway, I'm about to have a talk with someone who claims to know all the answers.
So, why don't you stay on the line and listen in to our conversation?
I promise I won't hang up.
If it turns out I'm a criminal, then forget you ever knew me.
And I'll disappear from your life forever.

Saki:
What? Hold on. I didn't mean it like that.


Osugi:
Well.
I think the evidence is clear - he was involved in the disappearance of the NEETs.

Hirasawa:
So, he used aliases in the six cities that were hit with missiles, and he gathered the NEETs here right after Careless Monday.

Osugi:
And then 20,000 people just vanished into thin air.
It's like he's the Pied Piper of Hamelin or something.
I just hope they're not buried somewhere inside this building.

Hirasawa:
It's strange.
I just don't get it.
What reason could he possibly have for doing this?

Sis:
I just got off the phone with Micchon.
They caught the last train into town, but Takky stayed behind for some reason.

Osugi:
So, does that mean Saki and Micchon are okay?

Sis:
Yeah, I guess so.
Anyway, I told them to come meet us here ASAP.

Hirasawa:
Huh? From Itazu?
He just sent a ton of data.
It's too much for my phone to handle.


Mononobe:
Get in.

Saki:
A helicopter?

Micchon:
What happened to Takky?
Huh? It's a message from Panties.
It looks like he's uploading a bunch of data onto Eden's server.
But the files are so enormous, my phone can't read them.

Mononobe:
So what are you calling yourself these days?

Akira:
Akira. Akira Takizawa.

Mononobe:
"Takizawa," eh?
You do know that's not your real name, right?
What about this? Did you know you sent 20,000 people to Dubai?

Akira:
More or less.

Micchon:
Hey, wait!
Do you think he's talking about the NEETs who disappeared?

Akira:
I've been able to put a few of the pieces together about that.
But what I don't know yet: Why did I erase my memory?
Why did I need all these aliases in the first place?

Mononobe:
Those are fair questions.
Are you aware of a firm called Ato & Company?

Akira:
"Ato & Company"?

Mononobe:
I've discovered the real identity of Mr. Outside, the man who dragged you and I into this game.
His real name is Saizo Ato. He's the company's CEO and their senior advisor.

Akira:
Saizo Ato?

Mononobe:
Yes. Heard of him?
He's a well-connected businessman who made his fortune through a transport company he started after World War II.
In the post-war reconstruction, men like him would like to think they were fixing Japan.
Ah, the youth of today. Ignorant.

Akira:
So, what kind of proof do you have that this Ato guy is really Mr. Outside?
"Ato Saizo"... Mr. Outside...
Wait! You just swap the name!

Mononobe:
Yes, it's an obvious play on words.
But the reason I know he's the one is because he's the only person with the amount of resources necessary... to make this game a completely automated experience.
At one point he studied overseas, focusing on pre-war Europe and ideology.
And he's also quite the soccer fanatic.
The name "Seleção" is derived from "Seleçon", a term stemming from his idolization of Brazilian football.
Once these hints were made clear to me, it was actually quite simple to deduce who he was.

Akira:
But why would a successful old man wanna blow ten billion yen on each of us for such an insane idea?
Does he really believe we could make a difference in this country?

Mononobe:
Perhaps to Mr. Outside, giving a young man like yourself nearly infinite power and wealth--as well as allowing a serial killer to murder and a warmonger the ability to launch missile attacks--are all valid and feasible methods worth exploring in the interests of our nation.
Saizo Ato is someone who prides himself on having laid the foundation for modern-day Japan.
But as the years went by, he began to wonder if the country was on the correct path--if all that he had achieved was right.
I believe he came to his decision after taking a hard look at the impasse our country is facing today.
And then, by forcing power upon the people he found to be worthy and able of the many hurdles laid ahead,
he sought to replicate his feats of the past by orchestrating yet another moment of dramatic change for Japan.

Akira:
Yeah, well I still think it's insane.

Mononobe:
I agree with you wholeheartedly.
He has made us all into victims, mere pawns in his twisted game.
However, while I don't defend his actions in any way, I understand he had to act quickly.

Akira:
Huh?

Mononobe:
At the time this game was put into motion, he'd already been diagnosed with terminal cancer.
The reality is, Mr. Outside is most likely dead.

Akira:
Huh...?


Micchon:
This is crazy.
Who's this guy he's talking to?

Mononobe:
It's a shame. Your chances of punching Mr. Outside are zero.

Akira:
Oh well.
I'm not sure I'd have the nerve to clock a sick senior citizen, anyway.
So tell me, what exactly are your plans for winning this game?
Even if the old man is dead, as long as the game continues, you still have to worry about the Supporter.

Mononobe:
My strategy for winning is simple:
The plan is to assume the role of Mr. Outside and then eventually replace him.
The game itself borders on absurdity.
But the Noblesse phone system is a form of engineering artistry.
It gives simple men like us the political power that Saizo Ato spent his life cultivating.
When you use your phone, you have a concierge who handles your requests, right?

Akira:
Yeah, you mean Juiz?

Mononobe:
I will be assuming control of her too.

.
Akira:
Mononobe, are you positive this is where Juiz works?

Mononobe:
This is a research lab owned and operated by the Ato Foundation.
In the years before his death, Mr. Ato reportedly spent much of his time here on a variety of secret projects.

Akira:
You've looked into everything, haven't you?

Mononobe:
Once I figured out the identity of Mr. Outside, I left public service and began making connections in the private sector, specifically with Ato's subsidiaries.
Then, just a few days ago, I assumed the role of CEO at Ato itself, allowing me complete control of the company.

At this point, I have established the identities of ten of the Seleção, including yourself.
Out of those ten, two of them have come on board to work with me.

Akira:
Huh?

Mononobe:
This is Yuki, Seleção Number 10.
He's the one responsible for launching the previous 11 missile attacks.

Saki, Micchon:
Ah!

Mononobe:
Where's Tsuji?

Yuki:
He's waiting inside.

Mononobe:
Excellent.

Juiz:
This is Juiz.

Mononobe:
Hello there. Please choose a bottle of celebratory champagne.
Have it delivered to the control room at once.

Juiz:
This is an unusual request for you to make, Mr. Mononobe.

Mononobe:
You refuse?

Juiz:
No.
It's said that rewarding oneself is good for the psyche.
Noblesse oblige. I pray for your continuing service as a savior.

Mononobe:
Thank you.


Akira:
I have a question.
Is there more than one Juiz?

Mononobe:
Hm?

Akira:
The girl who just answered your phone, she sounds exactly like mine.
It makes me feel kinda guilty for running her around so much with all my crazy requests.
Yeah I don't know why, but I always had an image in my head of a huge room full of women sitting in long tables, and taking requests while using voice disguisers so they all sounded the same.

Mononobe:
Hmm. You have a unique imagination.
The truth is the device we're standing on is Juiz.

Akira:
Huh?

Mononobe:
Ato would be 100 if he were alive today.
I suppose he created this awesome machine as a way of seeking atonement.
Takizawa, now that Mr. Outside is deceased,
only those of us in this room are aware of the facility and its capabilities.
He manipulated this country from behind the scenes until his death, never taking credit for his accomplishments.
Now we must carry the torch.
Join us in sending Japan back to its former glory!

Akira:
Huh?

Yuki:
Are you really going to tell him?

Mononobe:
Why shouldn't I?
After all, he is one of Japan's selected few.
No matter what he decides to do, don't you feel he has earned the privilege of knowing the full truth before the general population does?

Akira:
The full truth?
Look, just tell me what it is you're planning.

Mononobe:
Tomorrow at 8:00 am, this country will find itself under attack again.
Only this time, it will be sixty missiles.

Saki:
Huh?

Micchon:
So these are... the people behind Careless Monday?!

Saki:
Shh!

Mononobe:
Yuki's the one who came up with the idea.
We will force society to reevaluate what is important to them.
By doing so, we will become the saviors of this country.

Akira:
That doesn't make any sense!
Have you even thought this plan through at all?
How can you call yourself a savior when you attack your own people?!

Yuki:
Open your eyes, man!
What doesn't make sense is how this country preaches equality, then exploits its citizens.

Mononobe:
Yuki says he first received his Noblesse phone in the days after his parents died from the effects of being overworked.

Yuki:
And by that time, I'd seen there was no place for me in society.
I could either settle for an endless string of part-time jobs,
or go to school, get a corporate job, and work ninety hours a week for slave wages.
And if I complained, even the damn NEETs said it was my own problem if I couldn't get ahead; that I didn't work hard enough.
The ten missiles that I fired on Careless Monday were a message: It's this society that has the problem and it's this government that isn't working!

Akira:
Okay, you may have a point, but have you considered...

Yuki:
Come tomorrow morning, I'm going to give those bastards who kept me down a taste of their own medicine!
It's my noblesse oblige.

Akira:
And you agree with this, Mononobe?

Mononobe:
I've always believed it's an individual's responsibility to make something of themself.
But if we aim to downsize the country, and restore our power in the global marketplace, we need immediate results - we need to eliminate the deadweight slacker culture, and remove the gerontocracy's grip on the reigns of power before we can move forward.
I believe Yuki's plans will help accomplish these goals.

Akira:
So what's your story?

Tsuji:
I already had ten billion yen to begin with.
At this point, I just want out of this stupid game. The sooner the better.

Yuki:
Don't get in our way this time.
You got it?!

Akira:
You people are out of your minds.
You're misinterpreting what "noblesse oblige" means!
I wanna deck you guys more than Outside!

Yuki:
That's pretty much what you said before you evacuated all those people from the impact sites, not that you'd remember.
You may as well tell him everything; tell him why he erased his memories.
If he still wants to interfere with our plans, I promise not to say anything.

Mononobe:
Okay. In the days before you wiped your memory, you were betrayed by not only those you helped, but those who helped you.

Train Announcer:
Thank you for choosing to ride with East Japan Railways today.
We appreciate your continued business.


Hirasawa:
Wait. Are these logs from Takizawa's cell phone?

Kasuga:
It looks like Number 10's logs are the ones in the red font.

Hirasawa:
I wonder what this is?

Sis:
What do you think those numbers are for?
That's close to ten billion yen.

Osugi:
Hey, look! Right there!
It mentions Tomahawk missiles!

Hirasawa:
Does this mean Takizawa was involved in Careless Monday?
What's happening?!

Kasuga:
What the heck is that?!

Sis:
Who the hell are they?! It's like a naked army!

Kasuga:
Who do you think they can be?

Hirasawa:
Wow, there are so many of them...
Wait, it's...

Osugi:
I think it's the 20,000 missing NEETs!

The NEETs:
Aaahhh!

Hirasawa:
Run!


Akira:
Okay, I see what you mean.
It's enough to make any man lose all hope.

Saki:
It's not fair.
They're so cruel towards Takizawa!
But am I really any different?
I'm no better than the people who betrayed him.

Micchon:
No, that's not true! It's not the same thing at all!

Saki:
You're wrong.
I've said terrible things. 
Right after the missiles fell, I said to myself how I wished something bigger would happen.


Yuki:
Did we make the right decision by letting him go?
We don't even have full control over the system yet.

Mononobe:
If he calls Juiz now and requests something that could potentially stop us, he wouldn't have enough time to implement it.

Yuki:
We have a little over eight hours until the missiles begin launching.

Mononobe:
It's here.
Ah, a Bollinger...
It's empty.

Lady:
It turns out the winner of the game will not be decided tonight.
Therefore, you will have to postpone your toast.
Noblesse oblige.
Please continue following Mr. Outside's orders, and stay on your path towards becoming a savior to this great nation of ours.

Everybody:
Ah!

Mononobe:
"Transfer Juiz to a secret location"?!
Number 12's the Supporter... or he's Outside himself!
