  Saki:
It's turning into a slum...

Akira:
Yeah, but it looks like people are still in the apartments.

Saki:
You live in an apartment too, right?

Akira:
Who knows?
 Judging by the address, I'd say it's a house.
 Haha, yeah right!

レイトショーの夜に
Episode 3:
On the Night of the Late Show


Akira:
It should be that way...

Saki:
The missile hit over there, so I bet your place is still standing.

Akira:
The thing is, all those buildings are dark - like they're condemned.

Saki:
We should at least check it out.

Akira:
Here we are.

Saki:
Are you sure this is it? I'm not.

Akira:
It's the right address.
 ...it worked.
 There should be a light switch around here, somewhere.

Saki:
Wow. Not the kind of place I was expecting.

Akira:
Tell me about it...

Saki:
Is anything here ringing a bell?
 You found the key to get in like you've done it before.

Akira:
I feel something, but I can't place it...

Saki:
 Takizawa!

Akira:
What the?

Saki:
I got spooked.
 Aw, cute!
 What are you doing here, little guy?

Akira:
Hey there!

Saki:
I think we can say for sure this is where you live.
 I mean look at him!
 And that little puppy obviously knows who you are.

Akira:
You're right.
 You sure are friendly, aren'tcha little buddy?





Kondo:
I know this is out of your jurisdiction.
 Thanks for sticking your neck in.

Officer:
I'm just doin' my job.

Kondo:
Oh, and hey, would you mind stickin' around here for an hour or so?
 If I'm not back by then, head home to your wife and kids, okay?
 Thanks, pal.

Kondo:
You gotta be kidding me!
 A kid actually lives here?
 Sure enough. It says right here in the log he bought the entire place.
 You're not the only one who wants to wipe your memory.
 I just hope you're inside

Akira:
He wants us to go upstairs.

Saki:
I can't believe you live in a mall!
 How cool is that?

Akira:
It makes me wonder what kind of a person I really am?


Saki:
Is that a movie?

Akira:
Mm-hmm.

Saki:
I'm sure if we start looking around, we'll find something that'll help you.
 The paper was still being delivered, and I'm sure there's some mail too.
 We may even find the paperwork for when you bought the place.

Akira:
No way. This is where that photo was taken!
 So this is definitely the home of Akira Takizawa.
 But what exactly was I doing here?

Saki:
Takizawa! Are you okay?
 Did you find anything?

Akira:
Nope, nothing yet!





Saki:
This must be the movie theater.

Akira:
You trying to get us into the late show, little guy?
 Is this where you live?

Saki:
Huh?
 Oh, wow! What in the...?
 This apartment is amazing!
 Oh yeah. You definitely live here.

Akira:
I'm not so sure.

Saki:
But just look around you!
 Like, you know more details about the movies you've seen than you do about yourself.
 How much do you wanna bet you worked here at some point as the theater manager?

Akira:
Manager, huh?
 Oh, look. You can see ground zero from here.

Saki:
 Sure can...

Akira:
Oh, hey!
 Are there any movies that you're really itchin' to see?
 It can be any movie at all.
 I can play it on the big screen!

Saki:
I'm not sure.
 Remember I don't watch many movies.

Akira:
You can't think of one movie you like?
 For instance, what did you see on your first date?

Saki:
Hmm.
 Uhh, well let's see...
 There's a French movie with a dolphin and a diver I really liked.

Akira:
Ahh, nice one.

Saki:
And yet, you still don't recall any details about yourself?

Akira:
I know, huh?


Saki:
Someone who I've always liked really loves that movie.





Akira:
Hey, Juiz?
 I was hoping you could do me a favor.
 There's a specific movie I'm looking for.
 Yeah. I'm in the theater right now...
 Police?

Juiz:
Understood.
 I'm scanning the database for the films that are currently on file there.
 Please standby.
 Noblesse oblige. I pray for your continuing service as a savior.

Akira:
Yeah, well, I can at least try to be a gentleman.

Kondo:
Look at this place. It's a dump!
 I've seen refugee camps in better shape than this.
 Aw, man, look at all these cell phones...
 Okay, I get it now.
 This kid was involved in the disappearance of all those NEET losers.
 So a Seleção was behind the attacks and the disappearances...
 If I'd've payed attention to his history rather than blowing all that cash,
 I'd be up for a promotion right about now.
 But, I'm getting myself a new lease on life and a cool eight billion to go along with it.
 Simply not my problem any more.




Saki:
Oh, right.
 I can't have my cell phone going off while the movie is playing.

Phone voice:
The number you are trying to reach is either out of range or no longer in service.
Please try again later. Thank you.

Hirasawa:
I have to hand it to Osugi.
 Can't fault him for lack of trying.

Micchon:
I think he's fighting a losing battle.

Hirasawa:
"Tell everyone I'm staying at your place tonight.
 Pretty please. I just told Asako that, so don't get me in trouble."
 Hey, when did you get this?

Micchon:
It was around eleven or so.

Osugi:
Uh, what's goin' on?

Hirasawa:
We're going home. So tired...

Micchon:
I wonder where she's really staying?





Akira:
Maybe Saki's right.
 I really could've been a projectionist here.


Saki:
Wow, the screen's gigantic!

Kondo:
Here goes...
 Where is he?
 There you are.

Akira:
You always come to the movies by yourself, Detective?
 Since you're alone, I assume you're not here to arrest me, huh?

Kondo:
You've been watchin' me?

Akira:
Yeah. See?
 So I take it you came here to talk shop?
 Actually, I was hopin' you'd stop by since we got cut short last time.

Kondo:
That's nice.
 So kid, have you been checkin' out my logs recently?

Akira:
By logs, you mean the ones on here, right?
 By the way, what is a Seleção?
 Look, the thing is, I'm suffering from amnesia.
 I literally don't remember one detail about myself.
 Now if you don't mind, I'd appreciate the chance to pick your brain for a while.

Kondo:
So then, you really did wipe your memory, huh?

Saki:
Oh, where's Takizawa, huh, pup?

Kondo:
Interesting.
 So Harima Neuroscience Institute's brainwashing program really did the trick, didn't it?
 I may have to try it for myself sometime.
 But first, I'm gonna need you to hand over that phone you got in your hand.

Akira:
Ah?!

Kondo:
You got way too careless, big guy.

Akira:
What the hell is that phone, anyway?
 How much money did yours start with?

Kondo:
Stubborn prick.
 I'm takin' whatever cash you have on here.
 If I had to guess, I'd say you started with ten billion, like I did.
 The joke's on us, though.
 There's no way you could change the world with a measly 10 bil.
 It's impossible! The bastards who forced us into this game should die!

Akira:
Mister, you've got one hell of a kick.
 The girl... she has... nothing to do with... this game.

Kondo:
Killing her would cost me money.
 It'd be a waste of my time.
 Oh, right. I may as well give you a little heads-up.
 When it comes to Noblesse phones, as soon as the balance hits zero,
 someone named the Supporter will track you down and give you two to the head.
 Those are the rules we live by.
 That's tough luck for you, kiddo.
 The girl may be safe, but you're a dead man.

Akira:
The score's even now, Detective.
 I wonder who this Supporter is.
 Another mystery...
 I'm sorry.
 It doesn't look like I'll... be able to make the late show...





Saki:
 Hey there.
 You wouldn't happen to know where Takizawa went, would you?
 If he didn't want to spend time with me, he could've just said so.

Akira:
...ow.
 Heh, nice message.
 Well, time we paid the Detective a visit!

Kondo:
"...by now I have enough money for us to play around with for the rest of our lives.
 I called you a taxi. See you in Kabukicho. Bye."
 There. Just spent my last yen.
 They're both identical, you'd think it'd work the same way... damn it.
 Shit. I'll have to call Juiz.

Juiz:
Hello, Juiz speaking.

Kondo:
Hey, there.
 I got a question I wanna run by you.
 What would happen if someone were to get a hold of my phone.
 Can just anyone use it?

Juiz:
It uses fingerprint recognition technology, so it would effectively be rendered useless.
 Why? Is there a problem?

Kondo:
Oh, no.
 Just makin' sure.
 Thanks. Gotta go.
 Son of a bitch...
 Dammit! How do I always fuck things up?

Akira:
Thanks, Saki.
 Let's go, already. Answer.
 I know you can hear me!
 Come on, Detective Kondo.
 Just trying to make a nice gesture by returning your precious ID badge.
 The least you can do is say hello?

Kondo:
Damn it.
 How did you...?

Akira:
It's about time.
 So tell me, where are you right now?

Kondo:
I'm in the middle of Kabukicho.
 You better get your ass over here!

Akira:
Kabukicho...
 Um, how do I get there, again?

Kondo:
Come on! Stop dickin' around!

Akira:
How quickly you forget.
 Remember? I wiped my memory.





Akira:
Go towards Kiba and hit the expressway...

Kondo:
Misae...
 Hey, what are you doing here, honey?

Misae:
"Enough money for us to play with for the rest of our lives."

Kondo:
 Hold on. How did you...?

Misae:
When you text your mistress, try not to send it to your wife.
It's over, my darling...





Akira:
You okay, Detective?

Kondo:
Shut up, kid. Shut up...

Akira:
Let me call you an ambulance.
 You need help.

Kondo:
Don't bother wastin' your time.
 It looks like I'm done for.

Akira:
You can't just give up!
 I still need to--

Kondo:
Listen.
 There are ten others besides us.
 All are Seleção and they all have the same exact phone.
 Seleção are people, just like you and me -
 forced into playing this idiotic game, whether they want to or not.
 You can see their activity logs on your phone.
 Your best bet at finding them is by tracing their steps through those logs.
 Once you do, ask them who you are.
 Of course, this is assuming any of them are willing to meet with a dangerous Seleção like yourself.
 So don't be surprised if they run.

Akira:
Wait. I'm dangerous?

Kondo:
Damn straight.
 You rounded up 20,000 NEETs and tried to kill them.
 And that is the truth.
 No, wait.
 Of course, you're the Supporter, aren't you?
 It all makes sense now, that's why Misae...

Akira:
Look, Detective. I don't know what you're talking about!

Kondo:
Well, you got me.
 Take this and split, kid.
 I said get out of here!
 I lost this one.
 In the beginning, I tried to do the right thing.
 God knows, I tried...
