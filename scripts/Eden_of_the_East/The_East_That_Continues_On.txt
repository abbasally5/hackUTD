  Hirasawa:
Wait, so you're saying Takizawa has a phone that can do anything he asks it to?
That's insane!

Saki:
This line's too long!
Let's try somewhere else.

Micchon:
Anyway, before you do anything else, take a look at the data that Panties sent.
I tried calling him, but he's not picking up.

Hirasawa:
I'll take a closer look as soon as I can, but whatever you do, do not come to Toyosu.

Micchon:
Huh? How come?

Hirasawa:
Well, uh, you know those 20,000 missing NEETs?
They're all in the movie theater right now looking for Takizawa.

Micchon:
Huh?!

Hirasawa:
This place isn't safe anymore.

Episode 11:
The East That Continues On


Sis:
I'm impressed, Hirasawa.
How'd you find this spot?

Hirasawa:
I saw it in the real estate documents.

Osugi:
So, do you really think we'll be alright if we hide in here?

Kasuga:
It's our only option.
We can't reason with a bunch of angry, naked men!

Sis:
Wow, they seem more concerned with finding their phones than they do about freezing to death.

Hirasawa:
I'm not surprised.
Their phones are obviously important to them.
Hello?

Saki:
Hey, it's me.
So, we're gonna head your way after all.
It'll be much faster to go over all the data together.

Hirasawa:
Okay.
But are you absolutely certain there will be a sixty-missile attack this time?
And if so, is there anything we can do ourselves to stop it from happening?
It's not like we have magical phones at our disposal.

Saki:
I don't think Takizawa saved all those people on Careless Monday because he had a magic phone.
I think he did because that's what needed to be done.

Hirasawa:
Then what was the point of erasing his memories?
And it certainly doesn't explain why all these NEETs are so angry with him.

Osugi:
He's right, Saki!
They wouldn't be so pissed if hadn't done something to make 'em that way!

Saki:
Osugi, Takizawa had to do more than just protect people from the missiles.
He also had to protect the 20,000 NEETs who helped with the evacuation.
To draw suspicion away from them, he set himself up to look like the sole bad guy, then wiped his memory.
After he got that phone and learned about the attacks, Takizawa used the Internet to anonymously assemble an army of volunteers, and they evacuated people from the landing site by methods that were borderline criminal.

Hirasawa:
And you're saying the volunteers were the 20,000 NEETs?

Saki:
Yeah, I think so.
But after the missiles hit and the initial shock wore off, the people they'd rescued started getting angry and venting to the media.
They wanted answers:
How did anyone know to evacuate them in the first place?
Was there some ulterior motive behind it all?
See, Takizawa's volunteers didn't really know for certain that the missiles would come.
So apparently, some of them had used the opportunity to steal things at the sites.
Most of them, though, were simply excited and proud to have been part of saving so many lives.
They had to keep their involvement a secret.
And when many of the people who had lost their homes in the attacks remained vocal about their suspicions that they'd somehow been deceived, well, eventually the NEETs couldn't remain silent any longer.
They began firing back at the evacuees in forums and message boards online.
And very quickly, the different rumors and conspiracy theories begin to spiral out of control.
So to help diffuse the situation, Takizawa used a number of aliases to gather the NEETs at the mall in Toyosu, and he redirected their anger by telling them he'd been the one who orchestrated the missile attacks.
That explains why they know him by so many different names, and why they're still so openly angry with him.
That, and the fact that he helped ship them to Dubai for three months to shield them from the spotlight, until media interests in the story died down.
Public opinion can be fickle, and people are quick to latch on to unfounded rumors.
Especially in times of crisis when all they really want is someone to blame.
Takizawa was betrayed by the people he'd gone to such great lengths to protect, so he lost hope.
And that's what led him to erase his memories.

Hirasawa:
Has he remembered all this himself?

Saki:
I don't know.
But what I do know is it's up to us this time.
We have to find a way to stop these new attacks from happening.

Osugi:
Damn it!
Why'd you have to get us involved in all this?
Even if Takizawa is a good person at heart, it's obvious that the guy is a complete idiot.
He has a phone that can literally do anything and yet, he still finds a way to screw everything up.

Saki:
I think the missile target areas are listed in the data Itazu sent over to us.
If we use the Internet like Takizawa did in Careless Monday, there's a chance we may be able to stop it.

Hirasawa:
Yeah, good idea.
Nowadays, even the threat of violence is enough to get you arrested.
I'm sure that we'll get some sort of reaction if we post another missile attack is on the way.
Ah, but...

Saki:
But, what?

Hirasawa:
We can't post anything to the net right now.

Saki:
What do you mean?

Hirasawa:
The laptop with all the data on it has fallen into the hands of the zombies!

Kasuga:
Yaghhh!
I'm so sorry!!
I must've left it on the bar when we ran out of there.
Hey, look! I see it!

Sis:
Where?

Kasuga:
Right there!
It's that guy!

Hirasawa:
But how are we supposed to get it back from him?

Kasuga:
I think I know!
Our only chance is to hit them with the stealth attack, which means we should all take our clothes off.

Hirasawa:
Huh?
Wait, you want us to strip?

Kasuga:
Yes!
It makes perfect sense.
The best place to hide a tree is in the woods.
So to blend in with the NEETs, we should all be naked!



Kasuga:
Looks like they haven't noticed us yet.
Guess my plan is working, huh?

Hirasawa:
It would appear so...
Let's go!
Don't hesitate--you have to commit!

Osugi:
Yeah, I guess you're right...

Micchon:
You have got to be kidding me!

Saki:
I don't know how we're gonna do it, but we have to find the others.
I say we run as fast as we can and hope for the best.

NEET:
Uh?!
Girls!!

Hirasawa:
Nice laptop you got there!

NEET:
Huh?
Thanks.
But it's useless without the password.

Hirasawa:
Let me take a shot at it.

NEET:
Wait a sec.
You guys have hair...
And you're really pale.

Hirasawa:
Excuse me.
Run!

Saki:
Oh great, they're following us!

Micchon:
Don't worry.
They look like the type who are only into two-dimensional girls.

Hirasawa:
Osugi!! Catch!

Kasugi:
Run Osu...
Ahh!

Hirasawa:
Run!
Don't stop, keep going!

Osugi:
Saki!

Saki:
Osugi!
What aren't you wearing any clothes?!

Osugi:
Ah!!

Micchon:
Don't let the computer touch it!

Osugi:
Geez! Do you have any idea what I went through to get that back?!

Micchon:
Sorry, but all that matters right now is the data.

Osugi:
Huh?

Sis:
Come on!
Get in here.

Micchon:
Sis!

Sis:
I'm so glad you two are okay.

Osugi:
Enough with the hugs!
Let's get to work.



Sis:
If I remember correctly, we should be looking for some red text...

Micchon:
Like this?

Sis:
The Diet Building in Roppongi are listed.

Osugi:
All right, let's split this up.
First, send it to all of our cell phones.

Micchon:
You got it.
Wait.
Oh no... look at this!
Toyosu?!


Sis:
What the hell?

Akira:
Test, 1, 2, 3.
Just making sure the camera's working.

NEET:
It's Takizawa!

NEET:
Wow, can you believe this?

Akira:
Hey, Johnnys!
You may be wondering why I've gathered you here today.
Well, believe me, it's for a good reason.
I'm minutes away from launching yet another missile attack to kill each and every one of you.
I'm getting rid of everyone who knows the truth about Careless Monday and teachin' the rest of the country a lesson all in one shot.

Saki:
That's a lie!
Why would you say something like that?!
I know you're not capable of committing mass murder.
Stop joking around and tell the truth!

Akira:
Believe me, this is not a joke.
But there is good news.
You still have a chance to survive!
If any of you Johnnys want to live, head to the roof.
I'll meet 'cha there.

Saki:
Takizawa?



Yuki:
Damn it!
I can't believe we let Juiz slip away!

Mononobe:
Sorry, kid.
But from here on out, it's every man for himself.
I believe Mr. Outside is still alive after all, and I plan on locating him.
If I find anything, I'll contact you.
Otherwise, don't expect to hear from me.

Tsuji:
I think you've been played, my friend.

Yuki:
What do you mean?

Tsuji:
I mean, you're really stickin' your neck out on this one.
What if he's the Supporter, did you ever stop to think of that?
He put you up to launching another attack to eliminate the witnesses...
Well, what if he's just setting you up for an epic failure, so he can take you out of the game?
Best of luck to ya, man.
But keep your eye out for that clown Number 9.
I'm pretty sure he's gonna try to pull something again.

Yuki:
It's too late, he can't stop it!

Tsuji:
Didn't you read the news?
They altered the strategic programming protocols from the Patriot missile systems--two days ago.

Hirasawa:
Save yourselves!
We'll find a way out of here eventually.

Micchon:
That won't be easy.
All of the fire exits are blocked.

Sis:
Do you think we can make it to the elevator?

NEET:
Uh, hold on!

NEET:
Hold that door!

NEET:
Hold on! Wait!

Sis:
That was so close!

Osugi:
Hey!
Come on guys, wait for the next one!

Saki:
Osugi!

NEET:
It's him!

Osugi:
Takizawa?!

Akira:
You must be Osugi.
You've got balls--I expected nothin' less.

Saki:
Takizawa, wait!
You didn't come here to kill everyone.
You're here to save 'em, right?
You're gonna paint yourself as the bad guy again, to protect us!

Akira:
So you listened in on the phone all the way to the end, huh?

Saki:
Mm-hm. Until my battery ran out, yeah.



Akira:
Afterwards, I went back to Itazu's place and found out that he had sent all the logs over to Hirasawa.
So, I knew you guys would eventually turn up here once you saw the data.

Saki:
Your memories...
Are they back?

Akira:
Hey guys!
Good to see you again.
The missiles should be arriving any minute now.
This time around, I want you to post solutions for shooting down the missiles onto the Eden of the East website.

Kasuga:
Look at 'em go!

Hirasawa:
Yeah...

Akira:
Ahh, the power of crowdsourcing...
Put enough minds together and you can achieve brilliance.
Just you watch--I'm sure they'll come up with something miraculous, just like they did on Careless Monday.
It's not like I did that all by myself, you know?

Akira:
Come on, guys! Get hacking!
Juiz?

Juiz:
This is Juiz.
I've called the information from the posts on Eden of the East,
and have narrowed them down to the most effective ways of countering the missiles.
I pray for your continuing service as a savior.

Akira:
Thank you.
Let's get started then...



Akira:
Bang!

Hirasawa:
Hey, you made it.

Osugi:
Is Takizawa the one who called in the fighter jets?

Hirasawa:
Yup, and he could never have done it without the help of all these NEETs.

Micchon:
This is amazing!
Is this happening all over Japan?

Kuroha:
Any time you want to come and save me, I'll be waiting for you, Seleção Number 9.

Panties:
Well, would you look at that?
I did it!

Tsuji:
He can shoot down all the missiles he wants--doesn't change the fact this country's at the end of its rope.

Mononobe:
It looks like he made it just in time.

Akira:
Huh?!
Bang!
Who am I? The Sundance Kid? Idiot...
Saki!

Akira:
Hey, Juiz?

Juiz:
Yes?

Akira:
I'm afraid this time around, passing myself off as a terrorist won't be enough to cover all my tracks.
So I'd like you to use the rest of my balance to make me the King of Japan.

Juiz:
Did you say, "King"?

Akira:
That's right.
There are a lot of intelligent people in this country.
But none of 'em are willing to step up and lead the way.
Honestly, I'd rather not be the guy that'd have to do it, either.
But there's one girl who truly believes in me.

Juiz:
Order accepted.
Noblesse oblige.
I pray you shall be a splendid prince the next time we speak.

Akira:
When that time comes, I hope I am the same as I am now.
Oh! Juiz, one more thing...

Saki:
Huh...?

Akira:
Damn it!
Well isn't that a shame?
No gold ring on this merry-go-round...

Saki:
And so he became a prince,
in this world without a king.
