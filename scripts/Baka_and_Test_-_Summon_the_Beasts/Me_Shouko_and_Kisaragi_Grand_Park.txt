  Shouko:
Good morning, Yuuji.
It's beautiful outside today.
Are you hungry? Here...
Yuuji, you look sleepy?

Yuuji:
Shouko, toss me my cell.

Hello, is this the police?
I'd like to report an intruder.


-- OP --


Shouko:
Yuuji... what is this?

Yuuji:
Well, I don't know.
I've never seen that book before.

Shouko:
Really?
Because it was hidden under a false bottom in the third drawer of your desk with a school book cover disguising it.

Man:
Hello? Did you have an emergency? Hello?

Yuuji:
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

Shouko:
All right. If you burn it, I will forgive you.

Yuuji:
Why would I do that?
What do I care if you forgive me.

Shouko:
Fine. I'll take care of it myself.

Yuuji:
You can't just torch someone's stuff!
Ahhhhhh!
So tell me, what are you doing here anyway?

Shouko:
Let me show you...

Yuuji:
Wait. The VIP ticket for the amusement park?
How did you get that?

Shouko:
Someone generous gave it to me.

Akihisa:
Good luck!

Yuuji:
Yeah, right, someone generous!
Akihisa was the one who ended up with those tickets.

Akihisa:
It wasn't me. I'm not guilty.

Shouko:
We have special passes to the Wedding Experience...

Akihisa:
Hello? Who may I ask is calling?

Yuuji:
I'm gonna kill you!

Akihisa:
What? But why? Who are you? Please don't!

Shouko:
Well, it's time. Let's go.

Yuuji:
No way.

Shouko:
So you lied to me?

Yuuji:
I have no idea what you're talking about.

Shouko:
You promised that you would go out with me back when you lost the STWar.

Yuuji:
I don't remember that at all.

Shouko:
It's your choice.
You swore if you broke your promise, you would marry me right away.

Yuuji:
Okay, now you're just making things up.


-- Episode 7 : "Me, Shouko, and Kisaragi Grand Park" --


Yuuji:
Of course this is all Akihisa's fault.
I'm gonna kill him!
Aw... Would you let go?!

Shouko:
Couples are supposed to walk arm in arm like this.

Yuuji:
Really? Because I don't see any other chicks using brute force.

Akihisa, Hideyoshi, Kouta:
Hello, lovers!
We'd like to give you a big fat welcome!

Akihisa:
Hello?

Yuuji:
Hey, you jerkwad.
I bet you guys think you're real funny, don't you?

Akihisa:
Run!
I'm innocent!

Yuuji:
If that's true, then why the hell are you running?!
I can't believe you're a part of this whole thing, too, Hideyoshi.

Hideyoshi:
Who did you say?
I happen to be a member of the staff here.
This is my occupation.
I am not acquainted with this person to whom you are referring.

Yuuji:
Really? I'm supposed to believe that?

Hideyoshi:
Oh heavens, my hand just slipped for no reason.

Yuuji:
Of course, it did.

Hideyoshi:
May I please have your tickets now, folks?

Shouko:
Here.

Hideyoshi:
Whoa! Would you look at that!
You have VIP passes with you!

Hideyoshi:
Alpha calling Bravo. I've confirmed the target.
We have a Code 7 and are shifting to Operation Wedding.
Repeat. Operation Wedding.

Yuuji:
We're standing right here.
It's not like we can't hear you!

Hideyoshi:
Please calm down, sir.
It's not your concern.

Yuuji:
You were just talking about me!

Hideyoshi:
Now then, it's about time for us to take a complementary picture.

Kouta:
Smile.

Yuuji:
Shouko, Sorry.
Am I supposed to not notice it's you down there being your pervert self?
Hmph.

Shouko:
Yuuji... Be nice.

Yuuji:
Okay, I'll do my best.

Shouko:
Good. I'll reward you later.

Yuuji:
No! How many times do I have to tell you!
I don't give a crap what your underwear looks like.

Shouko:
I will never forgive you for that.

Yuuji:
Stop please!
Pushing down on someone's temples like that can cause brain damage...

Kouta:
Cheese!

Shouko:
Cheese.


Yuuji:
What the hell is this picture?

Kouta:
It's a free souvenir for the happy couple.

Akihisa:
It'll be put up in the park's photo studio so everyone can see it.

Yuuji:
You can't do that!

Shouko:
Yuuji, don't be shy.

Yuuji:
I'm not being shy, I just don't want this picture up!

Girl:
Cool! Check it out, baby.
Let's have them take our picture, too!

Guy:
Whatever you want, Sugar.
Hey, little dude, go ahead and take our picture next.

Hideyoshi:
Unfortunately, good sir.
This service is only available to our VIP ticket holders.

Guy:
What?!
We're customers too. I'm just asking for one picture.
So what's the big deal?
Wouldn't you rather have a hot couple on display instead of those lame tweenies?
Well.

Girl:
It's true. I mean, look at us.
It's not like high school kids can compare, right?

Yuuji:
Hold on. Where're you going?

Shouko:
I will not allow them to talk that way about us.

Yuuji:
Don't let those jerks get to you, okay?

Shouko:
All right then, if that's what you want...

Guy:
We wanna have a picture just like they had!

Akihisa:
All right, if you insist, we'll do it.
Please come this way.
If you could, put your hand right here.
Now, squeeze as hard as you can.

Guy:
Ow, ow...

Kouta:
Cheese!

Girl:
Cheese.

Guy:
What the hell do you think you're doing?!

Akihisa:
You said you wanted us to take the same picture.

Guy:
I hope you run fast 'cause I'm gonna kill you!

Akihisa:
No, xxx he's lost his mind!

Guy:
Are you making fun of me, you punk?!

Akihisa:
Would you like [to blow me/promise] with that, sir!

Yuuji:
Of course, you know, if you wanted to leave instead, I'd be cool with it.


Yuuji:
Doesn't it bother you at all that everyone can see what you're doing to me?

Shouko:
Don't be shy. Relax.

Yuuji:
I'm not being shy, I just prefer not to be hurting!

Shouko:
But this is how couples walk.

Yuuji:
It's arm in arm, not arm in pain!

Mizuki:
Greetings to the adorable looking couple over there!

Shouko:
See? I told you we look like a couple.

Yuuji:
She's a giant fuzz ball! What does she know?

Mizuki:
I am Fee the fox!
Please allow me to show you a fun and interesting attraction!

Yuuji:
Earlier, I could've sworn Akihisa was out on a date with some chick.

Mizuki:
What?! You saw Yoshii? Where is he? Where did they go?

Yuuji:
Hello there, Himeji.

Mizuki:
I am Fee the fox!
Please allow me to show you a fun and interesting attraction!

Yuuji:
Look. If you wanna play innocent, that's fine.
Why don't you just tell us where we should go then, all right?

Mizuki:
Okay!
Don't miss the haunted house right over there!
You should go now!

Yuuji:
Awesome.
Shouko, we're going anywhere but that haunted house.

Mizuki:
What? Wait!
You have to... ah... go...
Why don't you wanna?

Yuuji:
Because I'm sure you guys have set up something stupid there.

Mizuki:
Please go to the haunted house!
You don't wanna miss out on it, please!

Yuuji:
Not happening!

Akihisa:
Stop right there, Yuuji!
I'm Noin! And I wanna not let you make Fee cry anymore!

Yuuji:
Oh, come on.
Your head's all messed up, Akihisa.

Akihisa:
How rude!
Which part is messed up?

Shouko:
Yuuji, Noin is the absentminded one.

Yuuji:
I don't care.
What kind of fox would have his head on backwards!

Mizuki:
Yoshii! You put your head on the wrong way!

Akihisa:
What?! Damn it!
No wonder I couldn't see anything!

Mizuki:
Hurry and fix it before they figure out who we are!

Yuuji:
Sad thing is they really think they fooled us.


Yuuji:
Oh, by the way, how did your date with that super hot college chick go, man?

Akihisa:
What?

Mizuki:
Yoshii...
I heard, while we were working on this very important assignment, that she and you went on a date.

Akihisa:
Wait... Where did you hear that?

Mizuki:
Minami's on her way here now.
We think we need to sit down and talk about it.

Akihisa:
No, bad idea.
This park is supposed to be for amusement, not a fighting!

Minami:
Hey! What the hell is going on here, Aki?!

Akihisa:
xxx crashed down on the ground.

Minami:
You're gonna tell us every single detail.

Mizuki:
And you need to tell us the truth, too.

Akihisa:
I don't know what's going on.

Yuuji:
Let's get out of here, Shouko.
What do you say if we go ride the Ferris wheel or something like that?
Shouko? Where did you...?

Hideyoshi:
[We] set up, the haunted house is ready.

Yuuji:
Stop that!

Shouko:
We're going where they want.

Yuuji:
Aw, what the hell did Hideyoshi say to you?!

Shouko:
That I can jump into your arms in there.

Kouta:
Sign this before entering.

Yuuji:
Sign what?

Hideyoshi:
Liability waiver.
Such waivers are often prepared in these types of dangerous situations, just in case.

Yuuji:
Really? So, this place is actually dangerous?
At least that'll make it interesting.
What's it say?
"Waiver"
"I, Yuuji Sakamoto, will love Shouko Kirishima as my wife as long as I live and will share my joys and sorrows with her. So I swear?"

Akihisa:
Here's a pen.

Shouko:
And the registered seal.

Mizuki:
Inkpad to stamp it with.

Yuuji:
What the hell?!
Am I the only one who finds this entire thing ridiculous?!

Hideyoshi:
Under the carbon sheet is a second sheet, your marriage registration form.

Shouko:
How considerate.

Yuuji:
No, it isn't!


-- EYE CATCH --


Hideyoshi:
Please come this way.

Shouko:
Would you mind holding my bag for me?
Make sure what's inside doesn't fall out.

Hideyoshi:
As you wish.
Well then, I hope you'll enjoy yourselves whilst being thoroughly terrified.

Yuuji:
So, this is supposed to be an abandoned hospital.
I guess it's not too bad considering.

Voice:
Himeji...

Yuuji:
What's that?

Voice:
...more than Shouko...

Shouko:
It sounds like... you.

Voice:
Himeji is more... than...

Yuuji:
It's weird. It's like synthesized. I wonder if Hideyoshi is doing it.

Voice:
Himeji is more like... than... bigger...

Yuuji:
Whatever, it's not scary at all.

Voice:
Himeji is more my type than Shouko.

Yuuji:
Wait...

Voice:
She's got bigger boobies, too.
Himeji is more my type than Shouko.
She's got bigger boobies, too.
Himeji is more my type than Shouko.

Shouko:
Yuuji... Is that true?

Yuuji:
Okay, guys. Very funny, you got me. I'm scared!

Shouko:
Yuuji...
Prepare yourself.

Yuuji:
Crap! Why are you doing this?
She's really gonna hurt me!

Shouko:
You're right.

Yuuji:
Please calm down!
It's just a trick!

Voice:
Eek!

Hideyoshi:
How did it go?
I bet that ride made you wanna get married, didn't it?

Yuuji:
What makes you think I'd wanna get married?

Hideyoshi:
Because they say when a man and a woman face danger together, that couple forms a special bond.

Yuuji:
That only works when one of them isn't the danger the other one is facing!

Shouko:
Yuuji... I think it's lunchtime.

Yuuji:
Fine. All that running around made me hungry anyway.

Narrator:
Uhm, attention, guests. Attention, guests.
We've prepared a special menu for those with a VIP ticket at the restaurant today.
And during lunch, their special performance will be held.

Yuuji:
Nice. A special menu.


Hideyoshi:
Follow us to the restaurant.

Kouta:
Right this way.

Yuuji:
Hm? What's the matter, Shouko?

Shouko:
Nothing. I'm just really hungry.

Yuuji:
Me too.


Yuuji:
That was pretty good, huh?

Shouko:
I'm with you. Of course it was.


Yuuji, Shouko:
Huh?

Hideyoshi:
Good afternoon, everyone!
Thank you so much for coming to our special performance today.

Minami:
Believe it or not, we actually have a beautiful young couple dining with us who are very excited about getting married soon!

Yuuji:
Excuse me?!

Hideyoshi:
In their honor, we've arranged a game to celebrate their union and to show our support.
Get ready, everyone?
Because it's time for the super deluxe grand wedding experience.

Akihisa:
Yay! Let the show begin!
Everyone, cheer!

Yuuji:
Dammit! They've locked the exit!


Minami:
If they answer the following five questions correctly, they'll be able to experience our exciting and romantic wedding package.
And if they wanna go ahead and get married at the time, it won't be a problem.

Yuuji:
Oh, it's a problem!

Mizuki:
Well, Mr. Yuuji Sakamoto and the lovely Miss Shouko.
Please head towards the stage!

Yuuji:
No, we won't!

Shouko:
Wedding experience...
We will not fail.

Yuuji:
Let go of me, Shouko!

Mizuki:
The dream come true!
Aren't you excited?!

Yuuji:
This blows.
I have got to find a way to get out of here.

Akihisa:
All right, let the quiz begin!

Yuuji:
Of course!
If we have to answer the questions correctly, this will be a piece of cake to lose.
All I have to do is give the wrong answer.

Akihisa:
Question number 1.

Yuuji:
Bring it on! I've got this thing in the bag.

Akihisa:
When is Mr. Yuuji Sakamoto and Miss Shouko's anniversary?

Yuuji:
Okay...
I don't think I understand what they're asking.

Shouko:
I know.
It is everyday.

Akihisa:
Correct!
Every day is an anniversary! Good job, lovers!

Question number 2.

Yuuji:
I'm gonna give them such a wrong answer they won't know what hit 'em.

Akihisa:
Tell us, where are you going to hold your wedding?

Yuuji:
Mackerel cooked in miso!

Akihisa:
That is correct!

Yuuji:
Is not!

Akihisa:
Is too!
You've planned to have your upcoming wedding held in the Phoenix Hall!
Which has recently been nicknamed "Mackerel cooked in miso" !

Yuuji:
What're you talking about?
You just nicknamed it that, didn't you?

Akihisa:
Question number 3!

Yuuji:
Now I get what you're doing.
There's no way you'll be able to make my next answer work.

Akihisa:
Where did you two meet the first time?

Yuuji:
I got it!
Ahhhh!

Shouko:
Grade school.

Akihisa:
That's correct!

Yuuji:
Fine. I'll give up before they can even ask it this time.

Akihisa:
And now for question number 4!
The two of you...

Yuuji:
I don't know!

Akihisa:
Correct!

Yuuji:
It's no use...
They won't let my answers be wrong no matter what I do.
This is the end for me.

Girl:
Hello, not fair.
We're planning to get married too, you know.
Why are they the only ones who get the special fancy treatment, huh?

Guy:
Yeah, we wanna play your stupid game.

Akihisa:
Look, burger head, I mean, sir.
We're not done yet.

Guy:
Now you listen to me, you stupid fox!
I'- m'a- cu- sto- mer- too, you jerk!

Girl:
He's right, you know.
We want a wedding thingy.
And we should be able to have it, too!

Akihisa:
Well, yeah, but...

Guy:
Don't give me that...

Akihisa:
Well, yeah, but...

Guy:
...crap!
We're gonna do it so just give us what we want!

Girl:
Oh my god, you guys, I'm so smart.
I have an idea.
Why don't we ask the last question?
If they get it right, they win, but if they get it wrong, we do.

Akihisa:
I don't think that'll work.

Yuuji:
Perfect.
I know I'll be able to answer them wrong, then I can finally get out of this whole wedding nightmare.

Akihisa:
Hey!

Guy:
All right. Listen up, kids. Here's the question!
What's the capital city of Europe?!

Akihisa:
Congratulations!
Mr. Yuuji Sakamoto and Miss Shouko have won the Exclusive Wedding Experience!

Mizuki:
And now we'd like to present today's main events!
The wedding starring Yuuji and Shouko.

Akihisa:
First, let's welcome our groom with a warm round of applause.

Yuuji:
You realize I'm gonna knock your teeth out for this!

Akihisa:
And next, the groom's profile!
We don't have this part ready yet, so we'll just skip it.

Yuuji:
What?!

Mizuki:
Finally, welcome the bride!
As she makes her grand entrance!

Minami:
She looks so pretty...

Shouko:
Um, Yuuji...

Yuuji:
Uh...

Shouko:
Tell me the truth, do you really think that I look like a bride?

Yuuji:
All things considered, you look pretty nice.
I mean I've definitely seen worse out there.

Shouko:
Yuuji...

Yuuji:
Yeah, what is it?

Shouko:
I'm so happy.

Yuuji:
Uh, wait, don't cry!

Shouko:
This is... my dream come true...

Yuuji:
A dream?

Shouko:
I wanted this since... since we were kids...
I prayed for this moment.
I've always dreamed of being able to marry you...
I dreamed that one day I would get to be the bride of Yuuji Sakamoto.
I never thought it would actually happen and here we are...
You and I standing like this together...
I'm just really happy right now...
After all, I'm here with you.
This day is everything I've ever hoped for...

Yuuji:
Shouko... I...

Girl:
Oh, man! This is boring!
Could someone do something interesting, please?
No one cares about your loser love life.
So hurry up, so we can get this thing over with!

Guy:
Yeah, we've got stuff to do, you know.
Enough with the chitchat.
Shut up already and get to the freaking point!

Girl:
Does anyone else think it's weird that her dream is to become a bride.
I mean, what, she's like a twelve, right?
Not to be rude, but that is way creepy.

Guy:
Maybe we're on one of those practical joke shows.

Girl, Guy:
Hahaha...

Akihisa:
I dare you to say that again!
What do you care?!
Why do you two have to be so rude?!
I think you'd better get out of here before I kick you out!
So...

Mizuki:
Wait! Yoshii!
You're about to mess up the entire event!

Akihisa:
But they...

Mizuki:
Calm down, you'll embarrass her even more... Please!

Akihisa:
They were so mean to Shouko. I can't just do nothing...

Yuuji:
Shouko...


Mizuki:
Yoshii!
Did you see her anywhere?!

Akihisa:
She didn't go this way.

Hideyoshi:
Yuuji!
Where did Shouko go?

Yuuji:
I don't know.

Hideyoshi:
Why not?!

Minami:
Well, do you know where she might be?
Everyone's really worried about her.

Yuuji:
I'm not. I don't care.
I don't have time for this.
I have to go to the bathroom.

Mizuki:
You have to what?

Yuuji:
I have to pee. See you.


Guy:
That wedding was a joke.
Talk about total crap, right?
I mean, look at the couple.

Girl:
Oh, Yuuji...
I've always dreamed of marrying you.
How's that? Sound like her?

Guy:
Yeah, you really do, that was perfect.
She was so pathetic.

Yuuji:
Hey, you two...

Guy:
Hm?
What the hell do you want, high school boy?

Yuuji:
Well, it's really not that big of a deal, but...

Guy:
What?!

Yuuji:
I think the three of us need to have a talk!


Yuuji:
Hey.
I was beginning to wonder if you'd show up.

Shouko:
What are you doing?

Yuuji:
I figured you'd come here.

Shouko:
Yuuji...

Yuuji:
What is it?

Shouko:
Do you think my dream is... weird?

Yuuji:
Shouko, there's something I really need to say.
You shouldn't feel the way that you do about me.
It's a big mistake.

Shouko:
Ah...

Yuuji:
Seven years ago, I was stupid... and you got sucked into all that.
I was only ever trying to take responsibility. That's all.
Nothing else.
All this time you've been wasting your dreams on me.
And I know I'm not worth it.
Believe me. I'm really sorry.

Shouko:
Yuuji... I...

Yuuji:
Listen to me
Your dream is nothing to laugh at.
Yeah, you may have picked the wrong guy.
But I think caring about someone for such a long time is a wonderful thing.
What you want is amazing, and you should be proud of it.
That's what makes you so special.
Although, you probably wanna go with the right man next time.
It might work out better.
Well then, guess it's not every day you almost get married, you might as well have some kind of souvenir from it, right?

Shouko:
But, Yuuji... Wait...

Yuuji:
Oh yeah, I almost forgot...
Thanks for that lunch you made. It was delicious.
Let's go home.
If it gets any later, people will think we're together.

Shouko:
Yuuji!

Yuuji:
What now?

Shouko:
I knew it.
I knew that there was no way I could be wrong about you!


[Preview]

Mr. Fukuhara:
Question 8.
What does "computer" refer to in the Japanese language?

Akihisa:
Super electronic brain!

Mr. Fukuhara:
That sounds pretty tough.

Akihisa:
Next Time, "Loss of Control, Labyrinths, and the Avatar Instrumentality Project"

Mr. Fukuhara:
This will be on the test.
