  Yuuko:
No. This is not over yet... Not yet...
We still have a chance to win.
Ah!
Take this!

Everyone:
Uh...

Yuuko:
What? It's not over?

Ms. Takahashi:
Class A, I declare you the winners.

Everyone:
Uh...

Yuuko:
Wow, really? Awesome.

Everyone:
Uh...

Yuuko:
Yay me?


-- OP --


Narrator:
The Summoner Test War has ended and a new morning has begun.

Akihisa:
You have got to be kidding me...


-- Episode 13: "BAKA and TEST - Summon the Beasts!"


Yuuji:
Drawing boards and mats. That's awesome.

Hideyoshi:
I underestimated them. I didn't think it could get worse than cardboard boxes.

Minami:
But it did. It got way worse.

Kouta:
Way way worse.

Akihisa:
I'm so sorry, Himeji.

Mizuki:
Don't worry.
You don't have to apologize to me.
You didn't do anything wrong.
The STWar was pretty fun.
We have a really good team.

Akihisa:
Yeah, I guess so.

Minami:
Geez... Stop whining about it. We lost!
Big deal, could we move on already?
We can still work in class using the drawing boards.
No other class gets to sit on the ground.

Mizuki:
Yeah, it's kind of like [going/we're] in an art class or something.
I think it's cool.
Oh...

Minami:
What's the matter? You okay?

Mizuki:
Nothing. It's just, well...
I can't use the bottom of the board.

Minami:
Ah...

Akihisa:
Where are you going? Hey!

Minami:
Where do you think, Aki?!
I need to start another STWar now!

Hideyoshi:
No, Minami!

Akihisa:
It's not worth it!
We can't declare war for another three months anyway!

Minami:
But I hate this drawing board!
I hate even looking at it!

Akihisa:
Oh, come on!
Your boobs won't even be able to kick my spine inside out.

Minami:
You don't know my breasts.

Kouta:
Almost... Almost...
This is so close... so close... so close... so close... so close... so close... so close...

Akihisa:
You let yourself catch on fire, Kouta!

Hideyoshi:
Nice, the blood doused the fire.

Aiko:
What's the matter?
It's early.
Don't tell me you're already anemic.

Kouta:
Aiko?

Aiko:
Oh no, when I went through all the trouble of putting on a bra today just for you.
And it's a lacy one.

Kouta:
So, I don't care.

Hideyoshi:
Your nose appears to disagree with you.

Akihisa:
It's okay.
I'm all over this, man.
Awaken!
Ah?
I forgot my bracelet broke.
I guess I'm not all over this.
Wait! Where are you going now?!

Kouta:
Please allow Yoshii to summon his avatar.

Mr. Fukuhara:
What exactly do you want him to do?

Kouta:
Take someone's bra off.

Mr. Fukuhara:
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

Hideyoshi:
I don't know, maybe Class F just wasn't good enough to win.

Yuuji:
Yeah, that sounds about right.

Akihisa:
I can't. I don't believe this, man.
The way it ended seems wrong.

Yuuji:
Agreed.
But a defeat is a defeat.
We made the decision to use our fighting skills as our weapon instead of some lame test scores.
Class F fought under the same terms, A was just better.
They were able to attack and not be affected by what was going on around them.
We lost because we let our guard down.

Akihisa:
Yeah, but...

Yuuji:
But nothing.
Get real, dude.
How things play out is all that matters in this stupid world.


Akihisa:
Huh...

Akira:
Okay, what's all this dramatic sighing about?

Akihisa:
Akira, remember how you said trying hard is only a means to an end?

Akira:
Of course.
Why do you ask?

Akihisa:
I did my best, but it wasn't enough.
Starting to feel like I really am an idiot.

Akira:
Well, if you're taking pride in your own efforts, that is pretty stupid.
However, it doesn't mean someone else can't take pride in you and how hard you're trying.

Akihisa:
Really?

Akira:
Aki, you did the best you could out there.
That's all anyone can do, and I'm proud of you, little brother.

Akihisa:
Thanks, Sis.

Akira:
You have my permission to mope around for the next few days.

Akihisa:
Wait, aren't you supposed to cheer me up by telling me not to mope around?

Akira:
It's important to accept the defeat for what it is.
If a person goes through their life without experiencing disappointment, they'll never know how to get up when they fall and continue moving forward.
Dive right on into that failure and mope around for a bit.
And when you're finished being upset, just pick yourself back up and move forward with your life, okay?

Akihisa:
Sure!

Akira:
And while you're busy being depressed, please know I'll do whatever I can to comfort you, little brother.
Whether it's taking a bath or sleeping right next to you.
Doesn't that sound nice?

Akihisa:
No. It sounds gross.

Akira:
Don't be so shy, Aki.
I am your sister after all.

Akihisa:
I'm not shy!
I'm throwing up in my mouth!

When I'm done being all depressed, I can pick myself back up and move forward with my life.
My future...
I wonder if there's still something I can do...
That's it! I'll do it!

Akira:
Do what? Take a bath with me?

Akihisa:
No! Absolutely not!


Ms. Takahashi:
And that concludes the STWar result report.

Principal:
Who is it?

Mr. Nishimura:
Hello, Yoshii. What can we help you with?

Akihisa:
I have to ask for this favor, please ma'am.
We need another Summoner Test War with Class A.

Principal:
Why are you asking me permission?
All you have to do is wait three months and then you can do whatever you want.

Akihisa:
I want to do it now!

Principal:
Too bad. It's a rule, Yoshii.
And you're going to have to follow it.

Akihisa:
Please!
I'm begging you.
I can't accept losing like that, please!

Yuuko:
We'd like to second that request.

Akihisa:
Huh?

Yuuko:
I cannot accept this outcome, either.
Class A may have ended up beating Class F.
But to be honest, we really only won by a fluke.

Akihisa:
Ah, Yuuko? You serious?

Ms. Takahashi:
Do you really mean that, ladies?

Yuuko:
We do.
Class A represents the best this academy has to offer.
This isn't how we should win and I bet the other classes agree.
Please.

Shouko:
We'd like to have another war, too.

Principal:
I understand.
But the Summoner Test War system represents responsibility and accountability.
Not breaking the rules.
I simply cannot grant you another war. Sorry.
However, I believe we still owe you for the time the system went out of control.
The new iron bracelet was a prototype and I feel bad for making you the guinea pig on it.
With all that being said, maybe we can come to a compromise after all.

Akihisa:
Compromise?

Principal:
If what you want is to exchange equipment between Class A and Class F, I can't help you.

Akihisa:
Huh...

Principal:
If not, there is another option I have available to you.


Everyone:
What?!

Minami:
We can fight Class A again?

Hideyoshi:
But I thought we had to wait three months.

Yuuji:
I can't believe you got that old hag to give us another chance.

Mizuki:
That's wonderful news, Akihisa!

Akihisa:
Yeah, I guess...

Yuuji:
All right!
We're gonna take them down for real this time!
Better come up with a new strategy quickly.

Akihisa:
Yeah, about that...
It's not the normal kind of war this time.

Yuuji:
Hm?

Everyone:
What?!

Yuuji:
You're dueling by yourself?!

Akihisa:
That's the deal.
I'm supposed to take some kind of test against the Class A representative.

Yuuji:
Shouko is who you're up against?
You'll never win!

Akihisa:
Look, I know this is a long shot, but I've still gotta try.
If I win, we can't exchange equipment or anything but they'll grant us one small request.

Hideyoshi:
You do know you're fighting the number one student.

Minami:
Do you think you can win?

Mizuki:
You don't have to do this.
It's not worth it!

Akihisa:
Don't worry.
No matter what, nothing bad will happen.

Yuuji:
You sure about that?
We can't afford to lose any of the crap equipment we've got left.

Akihisa:
I'm sure.
Besides, Class A would just give us a small request too.

Shouko:
If I win, I'll ask to get my marriage certification form back.

Yuuji:
It was never yours to begin with, woman!
You giant lying jerk!
Didn't you say nothing bad was gonna happen?
This is very very bad. Real bad.

Akihisa:
It's not that big of a deal!

Shouko:
We'll go on our honeymoon as soon as the war is over.

Yuuji:
No way, freak!

Shouko:
Yuuji, how many children do you want?

Yuuji:
If you don't win, I swear I'll kill you and make it as painful as possible!
And as for you, Shouko, you better take it easy on him!

Shouko:
Why would I do something like that?
After all, you told me not to hold back.

Yuuji:
Dammit! My life is completely over! Over...

Akihisa:
Your confidence in me is overwhelming.

I guess they are right though...
It really doesn't matter if I get to fight them again.
I mean... it's with... Shouko...

Haduki!
Hey, Stupid, what's up?!

Akihisa:
Hi, Haduki!

Haduki:
Guess what!
I got you a present, see?

Akihisa:
Whoa!
I didn't know you knew how to make cookies.

Haduki:
I learned it in home ec class.
I'm not that good, so I hope they taste okay.

Akihisa:
I'm sure they do. Thank you.

Haduki:
I wanted to help.
I thought that... maybe they could help you do your best.

Akihisa:
Huh...

Thank you. That's sweet.
I really appreciate it.
Mmm, these taste great!
I think you found a new talent.

Haduki:
You mean it?
That was the forth batch I made, I burned the first three to smithereens.
But I kept trying hard and then I did it!

Akihisa:
All right!

Haduki:
All right what?
I don't get it.

Akihisa:
Well, I'll just try hard too then.
It can't hurt anything.
Might as well give it a shot.
Thanks again, Haduki.

Haduki:
You're welcome!


Akihisa:
I'm home!

Akira:
Hey there, how was your day, Aki?

Akihisa:
I'll study all night. I don't care.
Whatever it takes, I'm gonna make sure I can answer as many questions as possible.

Akira:
Hmm.


-- EYE CATCH --


Ms. Takahashi:
Welcome to the test showdown.
We'll now begin a duel between Class A Rep Shouko Kirishima and Akihisa Yoshii, one of Class F's students.
This competition will follow sudden death rules.

Narrator:
In sudden death rules, the students are given the same questions one by one and answer simultaneously.
If either student gives a wrong answer, the game is over.
The person who made the error is the one that loses.

Mizuki:
So, basically the one who makes the first mistake loses the whole thing.

Yuuji:
And there's an unlimited amount of questions. The further a student goes, the harder it's gonna be to answer.

Kouta:
Which means, this probably isn't gonna take very long.

Mizuki:
You can do it, Akihisa.

Ms. Takahashi:
Let the sudden death duel begin!

Yuuji:
Come on, win! You can do it!

Akihisa:
Yuuji...

Yuuji:
Believe it or not, you can win this test!
Come on, just trust in yourself, Akihisa!
Then you can do anything!

Hideyoshi:
Wow, he's a really committed cheerleader when his entire future is at stake.

Mr. Fukuhara:
Question 1.
Write down a proverb that means the following.
To fail at something one is known to be good at.

Minami:
Oh good.
This one's like way easy.

Yuuji:
Yeah, I mean Akihisa's pretty stupid, but he should be able to answer that with no problem.

Hideyoshi:
You're kidding! He doesn't know it?!

Yuuji:
Answer!

Akihisa:
Got it!
One down!

Mr. Fukuhara:
Both answers are correct.

Yuuji:
Gah...
Don't scare me like that, Akihisa!


Akihisa:
I didn't do it on purpose!
How do you think I feel?!

Mr. Fukuhara:
Question 2.
How do you calculate the area of a circle.

Akihisa:
Heck yeah!
Shouko already made a mistake! It's over!
Huh? What?! Hold on! Is that right?

Yuuji:
Honestly, he is an idiot.

Mr. Fukuhara:
Moving on, question 3.


Akira:
It's better, but it's not quite there.
At least it's not awful.
Aki must be fighting hard right about now.
I hope I can make something as good as he deserves.
Well, I'll just have to keep on trying.


Mr. Fukuhara:
Uh, next, Question 30.
Name the year the twelve court rank system was established.
Both answers are correct.

Hideyoshi:
Uh...

Yuuji:
Good job, way to rock!

Kouta:
Keep it up, man!

Akihisa:
I don't know how, but I sure guessed the right subjects to study.
She's not gonna make an easy mistake though.
If I lose my focus even a little, I'll lose.

Mr. Fukuhara:
All right then, Question 31.
Name the person who defeated the last king of the Persian Empire.
This well-known conqueror started his eastern campaign in the year 334 BC.

Hideyoshi:
Another history one.

Minami:
And it's a pretty hard one too.

Mizuki:
I know he can do it.

Mr. Fukuhara:
Both answers are correct.

Hideyoshi:
Nice. He got it right!

Minami:
Way to go, Aki!

Akihisa:
Phew... Even I can't screw up Alexander the Great.

Yuuji:
Okay, the questions'll start getting really hard now.

Hideyoshi:
I hope he prepared for their increasing difficulty.

Mizuki:
Akihisa...

Mr. Fukuhara:
Question 32.
Japan's very first imperial era was called "Taika."
Name the year the Taika Reform took place in the Christian Era.

Everyone:
Ahh!

Hideyoshi:
Did he really ask that?

Kouta:
It's like a freebie.

Yuuji:
Well, obviously, they're both gonna get this question right.

Minami:
I'd be more worried about the next one.

Yuuji:
Hey, come on, you know this!

Akihisa:
Yeah... the Taika Reform... When was that again?

Everyone:
Ahhh!

Yuuji:
Seriously?!
How many times do we have to keep going over the same thing?!

Akihisa:
It's not my fault!
You're the one who confused me about it in the first place!

Yuuji:
Answer the question, you idiot!

Akihisa:
The trick is Taika Alive... I know that much.
I can't remember which one it is.
645 or 625?
Taika Alive... Taika Alive... Taika Alive's in 6 what 5!

Mizuki:
You know this...

Minami:
Aki...

Akihisa:
Which one? Which one is it?
If I screw up here... it's all over.
Dammit!

Minami:
Answer!

Mizuki:
Come on, Akihisa!

Akihisa:
Dammit!

Minami:
Aki!

Hideyoshi:
What're you doing?!

Yuuji:
That bastard totally just gave up!
He's dead.

Mizuki:
No, there's no way he'd do that.
Would he...?

Yuuji:
Ah!

Kouta:
Ah!

Minami:
Ah!

Hideyoshi:
Striker Sigma V, he's gonna use it!

Akihisa:
Go Striker!

Yuuji:
No! Stop it!

Minami:
Wait, isn't it 645?!

Hideyoshi:
That's the wrong answer.

Yuuji:
Uh... It's over... My life is over...

Ms. Takahashi:
And the winner is Akihisa Yoshii from Class F.

Yuuji:
Huh?

Akihisa:
What?
I answered it right?

Minami:
You did it, Aki!

Hideyoshi:
Good job, Akihisa!

Mizuki:
So proud of you!

Akihisa:
I still can't believe I won.
How weird.


Yuuji:
Shouko... why did you do that?

Shouko:
Because... I made a promise.

Yuuji:
Huh?

Shouko:
Remember? I said I'd never forget.

Yuuji:
Yeah, sorry about that.

Shouko:
Don't be. Because I still got what I wanted.

Yuuji:
Huh?

Shouko:
I'm going to City Hall now.

Yuuji:
What the hell! How did you find that?!

Shouko:
Someone nice gave it to me.

Yuuji:
Don't tell me!

Kouta:
Kindness never goes unrewarded.


Principal:
I never thought you'd win.
Congratulations!

Akihisa:
Thank you.

Principal:
Let's get this over with.
According to our agreement, we'll grant you that request.

Akihisa:
I appreciate this.

Mizuki:
Akihisa, what was it that you requested?
New equipment?

Akihisa:
Not exactly.

Mr. Nishimura:
Get ready, Mizuki.
Yoshii requested for you to take another placement test.

Mizuki:
Ah?! Oh, Akihisa, you did that?

Akihisa:
That was the whole reason I ever wanted to start this Summoner Test Wars for you.
You're a Class A student.
You just had a bit of bad luck.
All I wanted was to make sure you could study with good equipment.

Mizuki:
I see...

Principal:
Then you can go to the class best suited to you.

Akihisa:
Himeji, isn't that great?

Mizuki:
Sure, I guess...
But Akihisa...

Akihisa:
What is it?

Mizuki:
Is this what you want?
Are you really okay with me being in a different class?

Akihisa:
It'll be lonely without you.
But Himeji, as long as it's what's best for you, that's all I want.

Mizuki:
Oh, okay...
Thank you so much for doing all of this for me.

Akihisa:
Sure.


Mr. Nishimura:
Ready, begin.

Principal:
A lot of people in this world are only good at academics.
But no matter how high one's individual ability is, there's a limit.
Some people only worry about their own strength and talents.
More often than not, you'll find that they're the ones who never exceed limitations.
When I was in school, it was natural to work hard for everyone's sake.
We all supported each other.
And we pushed ourselves together.
After all, you don't get much when you're only working hard for yourself.
That's one of the most important lessons you can learn.

Mr. Nishimura:
Your time is up.
It looks like you did well.
I'm sure this is good enough for you to join Class A.

Mizuki:
Thank you...

Mr. Nishimura:
I will let you know the results soon, okay?
You can go home now.

Mizuki:
Excuse me!

Mr. Nishimura:
What is it?

Mizuki:
I just remembered I made a really huge mistake.
Will you please let me fix it?

Mr. Nishimura:
The test is already over.
You're not allowed to make changes.

Mizuki:
But...

Mr. Nishimura:
Don't worry about it.
The test looks good.
I'm sure you'll be okay.

Mizuki:
That's not the point!

Mr. Nishimura:
Hm?

Mizuki:
Let me change it!
No matter what.
Please sir, you have to let me fix it!
I'm begging you, sir.


Minami:
What's up, Aki!

Hideyoshi:
Good morning. How are you doing?

Kouta:
xxx stuff.

Akihisa:
Hey, guys.

Shouko:
Yoshii...

Akihisa:
Oh, hey, Shouko.
How's it going?

Shouko:
I took the form down to City Hall, but they rejected it.

Narrator:
In Japan, men must be 18 years or older in order to get married.

Akihisa:
Bummer.
Maybe in a couple of years or so.

Mizuki:
Hey, Akihisa!

Minami:
Aki, have you seen Mizuki today?

Akihisa:
No, I haven't seen her yet.

Minami:
Okay...

Hideyoshi:
I'm guessing it'll be harder to see her now that she's in a different class room.

Akihisa:
Yeah, I know.

Yuuji:
Did you hear the news, Akihisa?

Akihisa:
Hear what news?

Yuuji:
Apparently, Himeji's test score was good.
Looks like she'll probably end up in Class A.

Akihisa:
That's good...

Hideyoshi:
Doesn't sound like it's good.

Akihisa:
It is.
I know Himeji was never supposed to be in Class F.
She should have been studying in A's room with all that fancy comfortable equipment from the very beginning.

Yuuji:
If that's how you really feel, then we're okay with it, too.
However... Things don't appear to have worked out the way you planned, dude.

Akihisa:
Huh?

Mizuki:
Good morning, everyone. Akihisa.

Akihisa:
Hey, what're you doing here?!
Did you forget something?

Mizuki:
Not at all. This is my classroom.

Akihisa:
What?
But I thought you were gonna join everybody in Class A!

Mizuki:
Yeah, funny story...
It turns out I forgot to write my name on the test so I didn't get any points at all.
You see, that means that I'm gonna be in Class F for good now.

Akihisa:
Are you serious?

Mizuki:
Don't you think that's wonderful?
I'm glad we can still study together.
This is a great class.

Minami:
Is everything okay?

Yuuji:
Are you crying?

Hideyoshi:
You should be pleased, Akihisa.

Kouta:
Yeah, it's a happy ending.

Akihisa:
It's not!
I hate that vicious mean old hag!


-- ED --


Akihisa:
You're a horrible person!

Principal:
Excuse me?
What do you think you're doing barging in here like that?

Akihisa:
What am I doing?!
What are you doing giving Himeji zero points?!

Principal:
It's simple.
She forgot to put her name on the test.
That means no points.

Akihisa:
That is so messed up!
She is the only one who took the test!
Of course it's her test!
That should be obvious!
How could you not know that it's the most common of common senses ever!?
How stupid could you people be?!
You idiot!

Principal:
How odd.
I never expected to be called an idiot by you.

Akihisa:
Now listen, you give her her points and you give them to her now.
Either that, or you can just let her retake the test again.

Principal:
Huh... Good grief.
You really are an idiot.

Akihisa:
Huh?
What?

Yuuji:
Idiot.

Minami:
Idiot.

Hideyoshi:
You are an idiot.

Kouta:
Idiot.

Yuuko:
A genuine idiot.

Shouko:
Idiot.

Mizuki:
It's true, you know.
You really are an idiot, Akihisa.

Akihisa:
Hey, you don't really think that, do you, Himeji?

Everyone:
Idiot!
