  Yuuji:
Great job, guys.
How about we call it a day?

Akihisa:
Yeah, okay.
Huh?

Mizuki:
Something wrong with your bracelet, Akihisa?

Akihisa:
Ever since we took our midterms, this thing's been all kinds of crappy.
Stupid shoddy craftmanship!
Disappeared.

Minami:
I'll bet you have no idea how to work that thing.

Hideyoshi:
Did you ever read the manual?

Akihisa:
Okay, let's see here...
Do not touch it with wet hands.
Do not step on it.
Do not use it as a handle.
Do not give it to your girlfriend.
Do not pawn it.
And always remember to keep this product out of the reach of children.
It's all pretty much standard stuff.

Kouta:
What's that?

Akihisa:
For ages 13 and above.

Everybody:
That's it!

Akihisa:
Everybody knows I'm over 13!

Yuuji:
But you still think like a little kid.

Akihisa:
Hey, that's not true.
In fact, most of the stuff I read is only meant for people 18 or older.
Ahh!

Mizuki:
We'd like you to tell us exactly what type of books you're reading.

Minami:
Be sure to choose your answer carefully!

Narrator:
The bird that keeps quiet doesn't get smoked.


-- OP --
--Episode 12 : "Love, Courage, and Our Battle Has Just Begun! (Temporary)"


Akira:
It's a beautiful morning, Aki.
Time to get up.

Akihisa:
Hmm... Good morning, Akira.

Akira:
Got your breakfast all ready.
I know you're fighting the top class in the Summoner Test War today.
So I made you a manly breakfast to help your strength.
Meat brings luck in combat.
And with that being said, I got you a steak.
And a breaded pork cutlet...

Akihisa:
Really?!

Akira:
No, they were too expensive.
But I made sure to cut out the photos.

Akihisa:
What? Just pictures?

Akira:
Isn't that great?
Now you'll win for sure.

Akihisa:
You're not really making any sense.
And I'm still hungry.

Akira:
You're so right.
I know most teenage boys have big appetites and pictures alone just won't suffice.
I thought as much, so I got actual food...

Akihisa:
Really?!

Akira:
...and made a video of me eating.

Akihisa:
Why didn't you feed me?!
This is beyond cruel!
I figured out I got pictures cuz we couldn't afford it!

Akira:
We couldn't afford a second steak.
And trust me, finishing that first one was hard enough to do in a single sitting.

Akihisa:
I'm so hungry I could eat that piece off your chest?!

Akira:
Oh, why do you tease me, Aki?

Akihisa:
Would you stop it!
I don't need any of this crap from you right now!
I need food!

Akira:
You're such a little monkey.
Don't you wanna tell me how much you like my swimsuit?

Akihisa:
There are tons of other things I should be saying right now.
So your swimsuit quite frankly is the least of my worries!
Why are you eating steak in a bikini anyway?

Akira:
It was the director of photography.
He said you'd like it better that way.
I'm thinking he was right.

Akihisa:
This thing's got a DP?
Ah...


Yuuji:
Test scores are the only thing that matter here.
Nobody cares about your academic ability.
Show those skills on the test or you'll be dumped in a class with the rest of the idiots.

Minami:
That's how you ended up getting stuck in Class F, isn't it, Mizuki?

Mizuki:
They told me that staying healthy was part of preparing for the placement test.
I was a little sick that day.

Yuuji:
We should be action-oriented like this school!

Akihisa:
What do you mean?

Yuuji:
I mean we can start this battle way before the bell is even rung.
Hideyoshi!

Hideyoshi:
This is everything I took from my sister.
Books and a school uniform.
I don't know if we can use any of this against her.

Yuuji:
We'll figure something out.
Leave it to me.


Akihisa:
Wow... Class A books look pretty tough.
I wonder how you solve this weird math problem here.

Mizuki:
Let me take a look at it.

Minami:
Math problems are a piece of cake!

Mizuki, Minami:
Ah... This... It's a... This math is hard!

Mizuki:
The problems excite me but make me confused!

Minami:
I don't really know what those two make together.

Akihisa:
The problem must be super advanced if it stumped these two over here.
Your sister is really smart.

Hideyoshi:
There's more here too.
Why are they so expensive?
If they're just tiny little pamphlets.

Minami:
These aren't safe for delicate brains!

Mizuki:
Akihisa can't process those yet!

Yuuji:
All right, dude.
Grab something from the box, and then go declare war on Class A.

Akihisa:
Hmm... Nah.
I don't wanna get my butt kicked again.

Yuuji:
Don't worry. I got your back.
Just walk in like you found her favorite book somewhere and wanna return it to her.

Akihisa:
Nice one.
Then she'll be all thankful and let me declare war on them without the whole beat-down thing.

Yuuko! I found your book!

Yuuko:
Nooo!

Akihisa:
You're all big fat liars.

Yuuko:
You're just a bunch of heartless cruel mean misfit heads!

Hideyoshi:
Yuuko?!

Yuuko:
I can't believe you did that to me!
I'll never forgive you for this!

Yuuji:
Hey, Yuuko, here to scope out your sweet new equipment?

Yuuko:
Is that supposed to be a joke, monkey brain!
There's no way Class F can defeat Class A!
Why don't you idiots give it a rest?!

Akihisa:
Gooood... night.

Hideyoshi:
I'm fairly certain she was speaking metaphorically.

Yuuko:
You cretons should be thankful to be in this school at all.
You're the scum of the academy!
Quit trying to mess with the real students here!

Mizuki:
You're wrong about that!
Class F might not get the highest grades in all the academics.
But I won't be quiet while you call them scum!

Yuuko:
I guess you're not scum then.

Mizuki:
Ah...

Yuuko:
I mean, if things had turned out differently on that little placement test of yours.
Or, perhaps I'm wrong.
And you really fit in with these losers.
Maybe it might be too late for you.
Word is you've turned into a real moron already.

Akihisa:
Okay, that's enough outta you.
Himeji is way too smart to be stuck here in Class F!

Hideyoshi:
Akihisa, this little /outburst actually strengthens her argument about us.

Yuuji:
Cardboard boxes are ready.
We made sure to shine them all up for you.
They'll look good in Class A.

Yuuko:
You won't be so cocky after school gets out.
You better be ready!

Yuuji:
The first phase of the plan is now complete.

Minami:
I still don't see how this helps us to win against them.

Mizuki:
We'll never survive a head-to-head battle with Class A

Akihisa:
There's that little history thingy of Souko's, but something tells me it won't work twice.

Hideyoshi:
Agreed.
Making the same mistake a second time is highly unlikely.

Yuuji:
Why do you think we didn't exchange equipment on our last encounter?

Akihisa:
Huh?

Yuuji:
The seeds I planted have grown.
And now it's time to harvest!


Yuuko:
A mock STWar?

Nemoto:
Normally we would've liked to officially declare war, but that's not allowed for three months after our last loss.
We just need a training match.

Yuuko:
I'm afraid we already have a war with Class F starting this afternoon.
So we don't have the time.

Nemoto:
You only attacked those idiots after they were weakened from their war.
Is that the legacy this Class A wants to bring?
Although it would be terribly embarrassing to have to say you couldn't win because you were tired from frighting us.

Yuuko:
I hope you're not suggesting we'll lose to them because that would be stupid.
Oh fine.
Suppose we can use this as a warm-up for fighting F.
Is that okay, Rep?

Shouko:
Go ahead. I don't mind.

Nemoto:
A warm-up, huh?
I wouldn't underestimate us if I were you.

Yuuko:
Whatever.
I'm not going to stress too much about fighting an amateur trainee.

Nemoto:
Ah...


Ms. Takahashi:
This is a mock STWar as agreed.
Classes A and B are both present and ready!
Begin!

Yuuko:
Let's not waste any time with them!

Everyone:
Summon!

Yuuji:
It sounds like it's started.
Hideyoshi, it's all you.

Hideyoshi:
Got it!

Everyone:
Whoa...!!

Hideyoshi:
How's this? Do I look like a girl now?

Everyone:
Whoa...!

Kouta:
Too fast...

Minami:
Looks like the enemy of us girls has been a woman alone along.

Mizuki:
I feel weird.
I don't know which way I'm supposed to swing!

Akihisa:
Way to flaunt it, Hideyoshi!
I totally knew you were a hot chick ever since the first time we met!

Hideyoshi:
Like I keep telling you, I'm a guy.

Kouta:
Close...
Change too quick.

Hideyoshi:
In Drama Club, you have to learn the quick change.
Now you see it?
Now you don't.

Kouta:
Ahh!!!

Yuuji:
What're you doing, dude?!

Kouta:
If you would have told me, I could've had my camera ready!

Akihisa:
I guess he's been trying pretty hard to snap pics of you in the buff.

Hideyoshi:
Now it's time for the final piece of deception.
Ahh, Ah, Ahh, Ahh, Ahh...
Hello, my name is Yuuko.
My name is Yuuko.

Ah, hello, my name is Yuuko.
Hello, my name is Yuuko.
Hello, my name is Yuuko.
Hello, my name is Yuuko Kinoshita!

Hideyoshi:
You're all just a bunch of filthy squine!

Yuuka:
What?
You can't just burst in here and start yelling...

Hideyoshi:
You shut your pie hole!
You smell like a pig!

Yuuka:
What?!

Hideyoshi:
I'm Yuuko Kinoshita from Class A!
We're tired of your lame poopy poop classroom!

Yuuka:
Poopy poop classroom?!

Hideyoshi:
The stench of this pigsty that you call home is making me nauseated to the point where I wish for your destruction!
You domesticated animals should be soiling our worst room!

Yuuka:
You seriously trying to say we deserved to be put in Class F?!
There's no way we're as dumb as those losers!

Hideyoshi:
What did you say?!

Lucky for you, we're going to be too occupied fighting a Summoner Test War with Class F today.
But trust me, your reckoning approaches.
You've been warned.

Yuuka:
That does it!
It's on!

Ms. Takahashi:
It's over!

Nemoto:
I thought it'd never end.
Boring! Let's go.

Yuuko:
You're the one who wanted to fight us so bad!

Yuuka:
I'm Class C Rep Yuuka Koyama!
I'm here to challenge Class A to a mock Summoner Test War.

Yuuko:
Huh?

Yuuka:
You...! I'll never forgive you!

Yuuko:
Uh...

Nemoto:
Ah... Yuuka!
This is a pleasant surprise.

Yuuka:
So, is this like a regular thing?

Nemoto:
It's not what you think.
Let me explain of..., Yuuka!

Narrator:
And just like that, their relationship ended because of cross dressing confusion.

Yuuka:
Ready! Charge!
Do not leave anyone standing!

Yuuko:
What's the matter with them?!
Aren't they afraid of getting killed?!

Miharu:
Is everyone ready?

Everyone:
Yeah!

Miharu:
My dearest Minami, I hope you'll see how brave I'm being for you.

Genji:
Alright you guys. Let's get in this battle for Class F!

Everyone:
Yeah!

Yoshiko:
Class A is exhausted from back-to-back battles.
Attacking them right now is the only chance we have of taking them down a notch.

Girl:
We don't wanna owe Class F forever, do we?
Come on, let's hit Class A with all we got!

Everyone:
Yeah!


Yuuko:
We're Class A... Don't forget it!

Hiromi:
I'm Class E Rep, Hiromi Nakabayashi.
I'm challenging you to a mock STWar!

Yoshiko:
What's wrong?
You're not gonna chicken out, are you?

Minami:
You guys!
So far Class E's holding up against Class A.

Yuuji:
An STWar takes physical strength and stamina.
While Class E consists mainly of athletes, Class A is full of brainiacs and bookworms, who can't be bothered with going to the gym.
If they begin to get tired, their attacks can start to miss.
Remember, their battle... it's mock; recovery test is out of the question.

Mizuki:
I get it!
That's the reason we didn't exchange classroom equipment when we won!
You planned on doing this all along!

Minami:
Now everyone of them owes us big time.

Yuuji:
Accumulating little victories can really add up.
There's never one big way to win a battle.
And building an advantage over an enemy doesn't happen over night.
Strategy is the key to winning this thing.


Yuuko:
You guys like to play dirty, huh?

Yuuji:
Sorry. What are you referring to?

Yuuko:
I know you think you can beat us down by turning the other classes against us.
But we don't care. You still have to face us alone.
We can take it.

Yuuji:
This is about what I'd expect from Class A.
Never smart enough to call it quits.

Yuuko:
Enjoy that smug look on your face while you can, 'cause you're going down!

Yuuji:
Hmm.

Shouko:
Don't forget... I'll be there as well.

Yuuji:
All right then, let's kick some ass!

Everyone:
Yeah!


-- EYE CATCH --


Yuuko:
They're Class F idiots.
They need to be taken down a notch.
We...

Shouko:
Excuse me.
This battle is not going to be easy.

Yuuko:
Shouko.

Shouko:
We'll have to use every ounce of our strength.
That's all.
Don't screw up.

Everyone:
Yeah!
Summon!

Shouko:
What's our strategy?

Yuuko:
There's a stairway behind Class F.
The main force will attack from the front while we send squads above and below them to make their move from behind.

Boy:
Let's get 'em!
Huh? They're not here!

Boy:
Maybe they ran?

Akihisa:
Hey! We're over here!

Boy:
There they are!

Yuuji:
You guys should probably get more sun.
You're looking kinda pasty there.

Boy:
What a bunch of jerk!

Boy:
Ah!

Yuuko:
How did they...?
Everyone! Regroup in the schoolyard!

Yuuji:
Here they come, Akihisa!

Akihisa:
Okay.

Boy:
Go, outside!
Huh? What the heck is this?!

Boy:
Dammit!

Boy:
Everyone, follow me!
You can't get... away from...

Class F's guys:
Welcome.

Boy:
Hey... guys... sup...
Ah... Ahhhh!

Mr. Nishimura:
Remedial class for you!

Yuuji:
I can't believe it.
Those dorks actually stopped to change shoes before battling.

Mizuki:
They're used to coming at us from everywhere, but now they're all in one place.

Hideyoshi:
If we attack them one at a time in a big group, it won't matter if they're Class A students.
We can still overwhelm them.

Yuuji:
Heck yeah.
On to the next one, right, Akihisa?

Akihisa:
Alright!

Boy:
Everyone, move!

Boy:
Bunch of jerks! Come here!
Ah!

Boy:
What the crap?
Why did you pull down your pants?

Boys:
Ahh...

Akihisa:
Now attack!
Take them down while they're worried about flapping in the wind!

Class F's guys:
Yeah!

Yuuji:
That's what I love about your Avatar, man.
He's faster than anyone else out there.

Kouta:
Oh yeah, one request!

Akihisa:
What would that be, Kouta?

Kouta:
This time...

Akihisa:
Huh...

Kouta:
Can we unhook their bras instead?!

Yuuji, Akihisa:
So predictable.

Aiko:
How dare you attack them.
You'll have to face off against me.

Akihisa:
Okay, Kouta! Leave it to me!
Hold on? You're not...

Aiko:
Your plan is waste of time against me.
I decided I wouldn't wear a bra today.

Akihisa, Kouta:
Ahhh!

Kouta:
No...

Aiko:
I guess we'll finally get to see which one of us should dominate here, my little Kouta.

Kouta:
A battle of the sexes, male or female, only one can win.

Akihisa:
Oh, Kouta!

Kouta:
I'm okay.
I'll take her down all by myself!

Kubo:
Yoshii!
I'd love to face off against you.

Akihisa:
Kubo! Right, count me in.

Kubo:
A little over confident, aren't we?
Allow me...

Akihisa:
Eh...

Kubo:
Me pantsing before you brings no shame.
It fills me with life!
Now I turn that energy into passionate blows, that strike your flesh with the resounding fleshy sounds!
A matter to orient heat!
The more you hurt me, the harder I can feel your love.
Yoshii, wait!
We have to risk our lives together in [a curdle/eternal] embrace of sweaty combat!

Akihisa:
Kick him while he's down!

Everyone:
Yeah!

Yuuko:
What do you think you're doing?!
I've had enough of this playing around.
It's time for me to face Yuuji.
Where is he?

Hideyoshi:
Yuuji is busy!
You'll have to take us on!

Minami:
We're cutting the numbers down bit by bit.

Akihisa:
Hey, guys!

Mizuki:
Akihisa!

Minami:
Aki!

Akihisa:
Looks like things are going well.

Yuuji:
Surprise and distraction, those are the best tools when you're fighting someone who can totally kick your butt.

Yuuko:
You mean us?

Yuuko:
So, the only way you can fight us is with traps and tricks, is that it?

Yuuji:
Haha...
No law against tactics.

Yuuko:
True.
But the time for games is over.

Shouko:
Yuuji, I'm going to defeat you now.

Yuuji:
My thoughts, exactly.
Let's go.

Ms. Takahashi:
I approve this!

Yuuji, Shouko:
I'm summoning my Avatar. Summon!

Yuuko:
Summon!

Yuuko:
Our attacks keep missing!

Minami:
We've been practicing a lot.

Akihisa:
With my iron bracelet, we can summon our Avatars whenever we want.

Mizuki:
We've had lots of time to figure out the best way to control our Avatar's movements.

Akihisa:
You don't use your Avatars everyday.
And because you guys are tired from all the wars you had before, dodging your attacks is easy!

Yuuko:
Got a pretty big mouth.
But it only takes one hit to end it!

Akihisa:
Bring it on, Yuuko.
It means nothing if you can't hit.
Like this!
Our hits may not be all that powerful, but they sure can add up over time.

Yuuko:
But you can't...
You're just Class F!

Akihisa:
Guess we've been hitting the books a lot lately.

Yuuji:
Yeah. But you guys are still smarter than us.

Yuuko:
It can't be...

Mizuki:
It looks like helps finally arrived!

Yuuji;
They got here quicker than I thought... Akihisa!

Akihisa:
Right. Awaken!
None of you can get through here 'till we're finished!

Boy:
No!
Push it!

Yuuji:
You guys are on your own now.

Yuuko:
Big deal.
I could take you losers all by myself!

Minami:
Talk about conceded!

Mizuki:
I'll fight you!

Shouko:
Yuuji...
It's time.

Yuuji:
Come on!

Yuuko:
They're just the stupid F class!

Shouko:
But how?

Yuuji:
We got better.
And now you're going down!

Akihisa:
Way to go!

Yuuji:
Let's finish this!

Akihisa:
Ah?

Yuuji:
What's wrong?!

Akihisa:
It's the bracelet...

Yuuji:
Dammit! The bracelet survived when the school system was down.
Why is it crapping out now?

Akihisa:
How should I know?

Yuuji:
You overloaded it because you've been studying so much!

Akihisa:
What's your point?!

Yuuji:
That bracelet is designed to be used by an idiot only!

Ms. Takahashi:
Yuuko!

Yuuji:
Shouko!

Akihisa:
Himeji! No!

Shouko:
Ah...

Yuuji:
Shouko...!

Mizuki:
Ah... Hold on, Akihisa...

Akihisa:
Yeah, I got you...

Minami:
Aki!

Hideyoshi:
What's going on?!
Akihisa!

Kubo:
Is Yoshii okay?!
Please tell me he's not under that!

Mr. Nishimura:
Ahhh!


Minami:
Close one, huh?
I really didn't think we were gonna make it.
Huh?

Mizuki:
Akihisa!
I've never been that scared in my entire life!

Minami:
Argh!!
It's not like he was the only one scared, Aki, come on!

Kubo:
I still can't keep my pants up!

Shouko:
Thank goodness...

Yuuji:
Ahh.
For a second I thought I'd lost you.
You see... It's just... I thought...
Can we just not talk about it now...?

Yuuko:
Take this!

Yuuji:
Ugh... No...

Yuuko:
I got you.
What? It's not over?

Ms. Takahashi:
Class A, I declare you the winners.

Everyone:
Whaaaaat?!


-- ED --

<Preview>

Mr. Fukuhara:
Question 13.
Fumizuki Academy adopted a battle system in which tests are used.
What is this battle called?

Akihisa:
Entrance Exam War.

Mr. Fukuhara:
Please don't mistake the fundamentals of this show.

Akihisa:
Next Time, "BAKA and TEST-- Summon the Beast!"

Mr. Fukuhara:
This will be on the test.
