  Narrator:
Mizuki Himeji is diligent in every subject she chooses to study.
For example, today, she's studying a subject that's not even covered in school.

Mizuki:
How to deliver a love letter.
There're many ways, but it's best to give it in person.
This way, the person knows how serious you are, and...

Akihisa:
Hi, Himeji!
Are you studying?

Mizuki:
Huh? Yoshii!
Yeah, just a little extra curricular research.
Hold on!
The book said it was best to give it to him in person...
Well... Actually... to tell you the truth... I have something for you.
Please...
No matter what you think, just don't laugh at me.

Akihisa:
Urgh...

Mizuki:
Ahh! Wrong envelope!

Akihisa:
How is this funny?


-- OP --
-- Episode 10: "Prep Tests, Mysterious Thieves, and Love Letters"


Narrator:
Akihisa's Year 2, Class F student.
This is a normal morning for him.

Akira:
Wake up, little brother.
It's another beautiful day!

Akihisa:
Uh... just ten more minutes...

Akira:
Then, there's no other way to do this.
I'll have to give you a little good-morning kiss to get your blood moving.

Akihisa:
I'm up!
I'm up! Look at me, I'm up!

Akira:
Yes, you are...
But why stop now?
I'm here.

Akihisa:
Ugh...

Akira:
Don't I deserve a good-morning kiss, Aki?

Akihisa:
No way!
I don't ever need my sister's kisses!

Akira:
Well, that's unfortunate.
I'm only trying to keep our family close.
Hurry and get dressed.
I've got your breakfast ready.

Akihisa:
You made breakfast?
Okay, I must be dreaming then.

Now, I understand what you meant.

Akira:
Meal replacement drinks are very good for you.
I thought I'd buy you these because there's never enough time to cook in the morning.

Akihisa:
It's no bacon eggs and toast, but it sure beats the heck of salt water, right?

Akira:
Having enough calories in your body is vital.
Especially first thing in the morning.
However, when the evening begins to approach, eating something light is smart because...

Akihisa:
... it's good for your health.

Akira:
The average male is supposed to eat about 2500 calories per day.
I've come to the decision that it would be best to give you 1000 calories for breakfast, 1000 calories for lunch and the last 500 for dinner.

Akihisa:
Mm-hm.

Akira:
Each one of these cans is only 200 calories.
So I expect you to drink five full cans for breakfast.

Akihisa:
[This is/That's] like way too much!

Akira:
You get thirteen cans a day.
It's really just a matter of simple math.
You need to stay healthy.

Akihisa:
There's no way I'll be able to drink all those?!

Akira:
I knew you'd say that.
So I bought all the flavors, they had to keep you from getting bored, Aki.
You'll have the "normal" entree with the side of "corn soup".
Your drink is "coffee."
And you can choose between "cafe au lait" or "chocolate" for dessert.

Akihisa:
Think you're missing the point here, Sis.

Akira:
I'm sorry. Silly ole me.
I forgot... you're growing.
Therefore, you're going to need more than the average males daily intake.

Akihisa:
Please don't! Can't take it anymore!

Narrator:
A good morning is still in the far distance.

Akihisa:
Ugh.
She could've at least thrown a couple of granola bars into the mix.


Kouta:
Hmm....

Akihisa:
What're you doing, man?
Bird watching?

Kouta:
I'm taking measurements.

Akihisa:
Measurements?

Kouta:
I'm recording the stats on bust sizes in this academy.
Standard A cup is 10 cm from summit to base.
Add 2.5 cm is xxx B.
C, D, B, C, A, F, D, D, D, B, C, E, A.
Guess a G! D, A, B, A.

Akihisa:
I thought those last two were D.

Kouta:
Silicone doesn't count, of course.

Akihisa:
Oh... That's a good eye, man.
Oh, look at those poor little fellas.
Do you [stuffed/staff her at] A cup?

Kouta:
Not at all.
As we go from small to nearly concave by 2.5 cm, you get your AA, AAA.

Akihisa:
I see.
So if it's completely flat like the one we just saw, you could be [ready xxx/really as] low as AAAAA xxx...

Minami:
Flat chest of women in the world united take over!

Yuuji:
Ahhh!

Shouko:
I'm sorry, Yuuji, but you cannot watch that.

Kouta:
A little more... There you go...!

Akhisa:
I... give... up...!

xxx hold it!

Hideyoshi:
You guys are lively, as usual...

Akihisa:
Why the nurse clothes?
I get it.
You're here to take care of me, aren't you?

Hideyoshi:
It's my costume for the drama club.
It's supposed to be for a male nurse.
But for some reason, it looks like it was made for a woman when I put it on.

Kouta:
Hold on!
That should be nurse, not male nurse.

Hideyoshi:
Are you sure?
I guess it's possible I misread the script.
Now it would explain why the underwear they provided had lace.

Akihisa, Kouta:
What?!

Hideyoshi:
I don't understand why the top unsnaps are in front.

Minami:
Pathetic. This is just sad.

Yuuko:
Yeah, how embarrassing.

Akihisa:
Ah?
Hm?

Hideyoshi:
It's my sister.

Yuuko:
Pull it together, Hideyoshi.
If you act like a total freak, people can't help thinking your sister's one too.

Hideyoshi:
Hey, I'm not acting like a freak.

Yuuko:
Did I say freak?
What I meant to say was my stupid brother is a Class F dork, which is fine since you actually like these guys.
How can you live with yourselves?
You're an embarrassment.

Hideyoshi:
You should really watch what you say.

Yuuko:
What? You can handle the truth?
Or, did you guys all grow brains over night?

Akihisa:
Ugh!

Minami:
Ugh!

Kouta:
Ugh!

Yuuji:
Ugh!

Yuuko:
This is a school.
Stop wasting all your time fighting and playing dress-up.
Let's go, Rep.


Narrator:
Meanwhile, Mizuki continued her important extra curricular research.

Mizuki:
How to deliver a love letter.
If you don't have the courage to give it in person, simply ask a close friend to help.
Close friend... I get it. I think...
Hey, Minami.

Minami:
What is it, Mizuki?

Mizuki:
I was hoping you could help me... with Yoshii.

Minami:
No way!
Don't tell me you are too!

Mizuki:
Uh...
Yes way! Why [don't/did] you write?

Minami:
I don't suppose you have my missing ones?

Mizuki:
Uh...
Maybe it would work better if I asked one of Yoshii's close friends instead of one of mine.
Hey, Yuuji.

Yuuji:
What's up, Himeji?

Mizuki:
I wonder if you would do me a favor?

Yuuji:
Favor?

Mizuki:
I have... a love letter...

Yuuji:
W-Wait, Shouko!
How is any of this my fault?!

Shouko:
Look at this.
You're mine...

Yuuji:
A marriage registration?!
No! Get it away from me!
I'll never sign it!
You can't make me... Ahhhhh!

Mizuki:
If you find it hard to give a love letter all by itself, you might wanna spice it up with a gift.
Hey, Yoshii...

Akihisa:
What is it, Himeji?

Mizuki:
It's nothing...
I really wanted to give you a present, so I baked something this morning...
It's cookies!
They're chocolate chips with rais..
Oh, dear...
Where did he go?
Yoshii! Where are you?!
Yoshii!
I baked you cookies...

Kouta:
This is my hiding place.

Akihisa:
Shh! Don't make a sound!
If she finds us, we're both dead!
Ah!

Mr. Nishimura:
Having fun playing your stupid games, Yoshii?

Akihisa, Kouta:
Ugh, Iron Man!

Mr. Nishimura:
Good timing!
Now you can move stuff for me.

Akihisa:
What?!


Mizuki:
It's also okay to secretly hide it in their bag or slip it in their locker.
It'll make you appear shy and that can increase the attraction he has to you.
Why didn't I just do this at the very beginning?
Uh...

Minami:
What're you doing, Mizuki?

Mizuki:
Ah... Nothing...

Minami:
What's that?

Mizuki, Minami:
Ahhhh!
It's porn!


Shouko:
Yuuji... where are you?

Yuuji:
Close one.
If she ever makes me sign on a demon contract, all will be lost!

Kouta:
My work here is finished.
The Complete Guide of Fumizuki Boobs.
All rights reserved.

Mizuki:
Uh... Not fair...
I didn't even get a chance to put it in his stupid locker.
What should I do now?
Ah! This isn't my letter!
Although these are kind of pretty.
Ah, wait a minute!
What happened to my love letter?!
Did I drop it somewhere earlier?


Akihisa:
This blows, man...
Why am I the only one who has to do this?
Ahh! Avatar! Ow!
What's this?
It looks like...
Wait, these're the questions for the next exam!
Hey, if I study these... and memorize all the questions here, even I could get a good grade!
Just kidding!
That would be cheating.
People will totally know something's up if I start getting good grades suddenly.
Ah?
The boxes are all jacked up!
Crap, I'm busted.
Maybe I can swap them out with the boxes from the classroom.

Nemoto:
Humph.

Akihisa:
I'm finished with the stuff.

Mr. Nishimura:
Say goodbye to those for now, but I'd start getting ready to see them again on the upcoming prep test.

Akihisa:
Yay... tests.


Mizuki:
Ah! There it is!
Though I'd lost it.
Thank goodness.
Ah... A delivery slip...?
Huh? Whaaaaaat?!


-- EYE CATCH --


Akihisa:
What's wrong, Himeji?
You look really bummed out.

Mizuki:
Oh, it's nothing, I... well... I...

Akihisa:
What is it?
If you need me to help you with something, all you have to do is ask.

Mizuki:
Yoshii?

Akihisa:
Huh?

Mizuki:
Help me...


Yuuji, Hideyoshi, Kouta, Minami:
It's gone!

Yuuji:
Where is that stupid marriage paper?
I left it right here!

Kouta:
My Fumizuki boobies list that I busted my butt on is gone.

Minami:
That collection of pictures took me years to build up.

Hideyoshi:
My nurse costume, where is it?!

Yuuji:
How could this happen to me?
I locked it.
I had so many security measures.
Whoever did this must be a professional.

Nemoto:
I saw Iron man earlier.
Pretty sure he took some boxes down to the safe.

Yuuji:
Ah!

Everyone:
Holy crap!

Nemoto:
And...

Everyone:
Whaaaaat?!


Akihisa:
You lost an important envelope?!
Wait, do you remember where you dropped it?

Mizuki:
I thought I did.
But when I checked, I only found this.

Akihisa:
It's a slip from the box of prep tests.
That must mean, when I dropped the exam papers... it must have gotten mixed in with them.
Now they're all locked in the safe and I'm pretty sure they do that to keep us out.
What should we do?

Yuuji:
Call for back up.

Akihisa, Mizuki:
Huh?

Kouta:
We're here to help!

Minami:
That's what friends are here for.
You just gotta ask!

Hideyoshi:
Good support systems are fundamental.

Akihisa:
Yuuji! You guys!

Yuuji:
You're not the only one with something important trapped behind six inches of cold steel.

Hideyoshi:
This may seem a tad overdramatic for a costume.

Kouta:
My boobies list is like my family!

Minami:
We're gonna get them all back no matter what!

Akihisa:
Yeah, we are!

Mizuki:
You guys... Thank you!

Yuuji:
When we have one goal...

Everybody:
Nothing can stop us!

Narrator:
Their goals were actually very different.

Yuuji:
Who knew?
They really do have that big round doors.

Nemoto:
A key and a secret code're needed to open it.

Mizuki:
I wish it would open with just a key or just a secret code.

Kouta:
It's like two things at the same time.

Minami:
I say we get Aki's Avatar to rip that big round door off.

Akihisa:
I'll be the only one who gets kicked out if we do that.

Hideyoshi:
Hold please, I have an idea forming!

Everyone:
What do we do?

Hideyoshi:
In the drama club's production of top hat bad thief, a thief devised this clever deception to gain access to a vault.

Everybody:
Whoa!

Yuuji:
How did he do it?

Hideyoshi:
He took the time to prepare a decoy treasure.
Then he showed the fake to the owner and told them that he stole it.
The owner completely freaked out and opened the safe to check it.
When he opened the safe, he stole the treasure for real.

Minami:
That's amazing!

Mizuki:
Your thief was so smart!

Yuuji:
Can I be the one with the top hat?

Akihisa:
Okay, let's use the plan from the drama club!

Everyone:
Yeah!

Akihisa:
Hahaha...
Iron Man... Would you look at this right here?
It's a prep test from the safe.

Mr. Nishimura:
Why don't you give me that?

Akihisa:
What?

Mr. Nishimura:
Hmmm....

Akihisa:
Hold on!
Don't you wanna go open up the safe and double-check to make sure?

Mr. Nishimura:
Why should I have to do that when you're standing right in front of me, genius?

Akihisa:
Oh, yeah. Right.


Akihisa:
Oh, crap! It didn't work.

Hideyoshi:
We didn't have any problems in the play.

Minami:
I wonder what was difference.

Kouta:
Costumes?

Yuuji:
Guess we're just gonna have to crack this baby ourselves.

Akihisa:
I don't know, man.
A secret code and a stupid key?
What're we gonna do?

Nemoto:
Perhaps I should offer you my assistance.

Everyone:
What?!

Akihisa:
Who are you?

Narrator:
Kyouji Nemoto. He is the rep for Year 2, Class B.

Nemoto:
All we have to do is open a little safe.
I think we can handle that.

Akihisa:
You think?

Nemoto:
You'll noticed that I said "we" there.
You guys get the key, I'll handle the code.
It'll be a piece of cake.

Everyone:
Really?!

Nemoto:
Yeah, I promise.
We have to count on our friends in times of need, right?

Everyone:
Nemoto is totally awesome!


Yuuji:
Where is it?!

Hideyoshi:
That's the one.

Akihisa:
The key to the safe is over there?

Minami:
No way!
It's right behind Iron Man?

Mizuki:
What do we do?

Kouta:
This is hopeless.

Yuuji:
Okay, someone has to create a diversion for us.

Akihisa:
By doing what?

Yuuji:
A really hot chick would be the perfect distraction for him.
We'd have no problems snagging the keys.

Akihisa:
Hideyoshi is the perfect hot chick!

Hideyoshi:
Why make me do it?

Akihisa:
We couldn't let Himeji risk going in there by herself and Minami doesn't have the hotness level...
Ow, ow...

Minami:
Who doesn't have any hotness?!

Mr. Nishimura:
What's going on out here?

Akihisa:
This is our new routine for dance class. It's called angry troll.
She grabs my spine...

Mr. Nishimura:
Ahhhh!

Akihisa:
I get... because of a big of my brain.

Yuuji:
Your sight should come back soon.

Kouta:
Because of your pain, I got the key.

Yuuji:
Good job.
It went exactly as we planned, Kouta.

Akihisa:
So I was the decoy?!


Akihisa:
Okay, it's unlocked.

Hideyoshi:
Now all we need is the secret code.

Nemoto:
Try not to touch anything.
These alarms are very sensitive, it could still go off

Yuuji:
Okay, super thief.

Akihisa:
It's all you, then.

Nemoto:
Check this out.

Everyone:
No way!

Kouta:
A sweet camera!

Nemoto:
I recorded Iron Man opening it.

Minami:
We can see all the numbers he pressed!

Nemoto:
That's right.
We've got the secret code that's just for today.

Everyone:
Whoa!

Kouta:
I found it!

Minami:
They're all here! I've got my pictures!

Yuuji:
You can't get me now!
I'd better find some place to bury this!

Mizuki:
Here's my letter!

Akihisa:
I told you we'd find it, Himeji.

Mizuki:
Yeah. And it's all thanks to you!
Thank you...
You saved me, Yoshii...

Hideyoshi:
Yes! My nurse costume is intact!

Akihisa:
Oh... And a bra?!

Kouta:
Front-hook!
You'll pop it right open!

Mizuki:
Huh...
I always wondered what those looked like.

Minami:
Hm?
You serious?
Mizuki, you've never seen a front-hook bra before?

Mizuki:
Stores don't have it in my size.
Apparently, clasps aren't strong enough for me.

Minami:
Ahhh!
That's so not true!
Those things are like steel traps!
Front-hooks aren't just made for those who have flat chests!
Who said that?!

Akihisa, Kouta:
Strong enough?

Nemoto:
Oh... Jackpot!

Hideyoshi:
What're you doing, Nemoto?

Nemoto:
Nothing. just a little research.

Mizuki:
Doesn't look like research.

Minami:
You're just a cheater!

Nemoto:
Don't try to get righteous with me.
We're in this together now.

Everyone:
Ugh...

Nemoto:
You helped to break it to the safe for the exams were being kept, remember?
If they would ever find that out, you would be as much troubled as me.

Mizuki:
But we... didn't want this!
We were just trying to get our stuff back.

Nemoto:
Do you really think that any teacher's going to believe that, honestly?
A couple of months in Class F and already you're nearly as stupid as them.
This world only cares about winning.
That's all.
It doesn't matter how you get there.

Akihisa:
You can't! No!

Nemoto:
The only thing I have to do is answer these questions correctly at the day of the test.
If I can do that, then I prove I'm smart.
I still have to memorize all the right answers even if I know the questions.

Akihisa:
You're kind of a jerk!

Nemoto:
Only a moron would skip this perfect opportunity.
That's why you guys are idiots.
Am I really hurting anyone by improving my scores a little bit?
And who gets anything from a pointless act of honesty, really?
Answer those questions correctly and maybe you could make it out of Class F!
I can see now that it's not only your academic performance that's defective but most likely your very brains themselves, your worthless class F, nitwits!

Mizuki:
You're the nitwit!

Akihisa:
Himeji...

Mizuki:
True, Class F's academic performance may not be good.
But... But they've all got kind hearts!
They're considerate...
So I guess maybe you're right.
They'll never be like you!

Akihisa:
Wow, Himeji...

Mizuki:
You better think twice before you talk about my class that way again!

Nemoto:
Humph!
How touching...
Anyway, don't forget we're in this together.
If I'm caught then, so are you.
Call it the one thing we have in common.
Get it?
I don't know what you were doing in here and to be quite frank, I don't care.
Let's just pretend this whole thing never even happened.
We were never here.
Time to wise up, simpletons.
Hope you all have a wonderful day.
Hahaha...


Akihisa:
Yuuji...
Do you really think we're stupid... like he said...?

Yuuji:
Dude, without a doubt.
We're all extra crispy sun-dried boneheads.

Akihisa:
Yeah, I guess.

Yuuji:
You're just mad, he got us good.

Akihisa:
I don't care if someone makes a fool of me.
But... talk smack about my friends and that's going to piss me off!
Himeji should totally be studying in Class A right now, but she got stuck in F because of luck.
It isn't her fault she was thrown in with the losers and rejects of the academy.
So, there's no reason for him to be such a jerk!
Why try to make her feel ashamed of it?

Yuuji:
Hmm... If you're that upset, guess the two of us should do something.

Akihisa:
What?

Yuuji:
It's almost been three months since our loss.
In a couple of days, we'll be able to declare war again.
Sound good?
We got our butts handed to us last time we tried.
It was all because I didn't think things through.
I'm sorry...

Akihisa:
Yuuji...

Yuuji:
But it's because we got so close that I know we can do it.
I'm not gonna screw up like that ever again.
I know we're ready this time.
Let's give it another shot!
What do you say, man?!

Akihisa:
Hahaha.
It's pretty obvious. I say we do it!

This time we'll win!
This'll show them we're no ordinary idiots!
Let's go!
It's Summoner Test War time!

Yuuji:
Yeah! I say we go and even the score!

Akihisa:
First things first.

Yuuji:
Huh?

Akihisa:
I should go get Himeji's cookies.

Yuuji:
Good idea!
Why should we be the only ones who risk our lives on her food?

Akihisa:
Awaken!
I'm summoning my Avatar. Summon!

Yuuji, Akihisa:
Yaay! Hahaha...

Minami:
What's this?

Mizuki:
It looks like the prep test from the safe.
That's weird.

Boy:
All I have to do is memorize the questions and I'll get the perfect score!

Akiko:
Wow, look at all those brainless geeks.

Shouko:
They'll never put any of these questions on the test now.

Boys:
Oh....!

Nemoto:
Hmm..

Minami:
Something tells me, we might know the guys behind this.

Mizuki:
Think you're right.

Mr. Nishimura:
Yoshii! Yuuji!
What the hell do you think you're doing?!

Akihisa, Yuuji:
We're sorry!

Mr. Nishimura:
Huh...
Explain right now!
Why'd you two do this?

Akihisa:
It was supposed to be a prank.

Yuuji:
I guess we went too far!

Mr. Nishimura:
Don't give me that!
What's going on here?!
Ugh...

Akihisa, Yuuji:
Look, seriously! We're really sorry!

Mr. Nishimura:
Hmm...
You're not gonna tell me the truth, huh?

Akihisa:
We did. It was a prank.

Mr. Nishimura:
Oh, come on!
The two of you have never apologized like this before.
Hmm... Okay then...
You're both getting the demon's remedial class!

Akihisa, Yuuji:
Ahhhhh!

Mr. Nishimura:
Suck it up!
I'm re-working all my lessons for you two.
This prank is gonna hurt.

Akihisa:
Hehehe...

Yuuji:
Hmph.

Akihisa, Yuuji:
Yes sir!


-- ED --


Nemoto:
Oh? What's this?
Some girl gave me cookies.
Huh, quite the chick magnet, aren't I?
Think I better eat them before Yuuka finds out I have these.
Ahghghghghghghg!

Narrator:
That's the sound of his soul being taken away.


<Preview>

Mr. Fukuhara:
Question 11.
What tactic did the Germans use during World War II that was a combination of bombing and armored divisions?

Akihisa:
Let's go full blast!

Mr. Fukuhara:
Please value your life.

Akihisa:
Next Time, "Rivals, Love Letters, and Blitz Tactics."

Mr. Fukuhara:
This will be on the test.
