  Shouko:
Yuuji, I can never remember when the Taika Reforms were.

Yuuji:
We're in third grade, you should know this by now. You're such an idiot.

Shouko:
Well, maybe you could teach it to me.

Yuuji:
There's a simple trick to remember it.
You say Taika alive in six twenty five.

Shouko:
Taika alive?

Yuuji:
They centralized power for the imperial court like China, but kept a newly united Japan from dying on the vine.
Taika alive.

Shouko:
Taika alive in six twenty five.

Yuuji:
Can you remember that?

Shouko:
I've got it now.
I don't think I can ever forget.


--OP--

--Episode 2 : Lilies, Roses, and Health and Physical Education


Narrator:
At Fumizuki Academy, your skills in the classroom are your power and the test results are your justice.

Yuuji:
What's up, Himeji?
You wanted to tell me something?

Mizuki:
Actually... it's more like a question I want to ask you.
I need to talk to you.

Akihisa:
Ah!

Ms. Takahashi:
So that's what happened.
The very first battle of the term between the second year students ended up with Class F beating Class E.

President:
I see... A good start to the year.
However, the losing class is likely dispirited about moving to worse equipment, so early on.
If they keep up with their studies, they can just as easily take it back the next time they meet.
The next battle is all we can ever prepare for in life.

Teacher:
Ah, actually... after the battle the students decided they didn't want to trade equipment.

President:
And what would make them do that?


Akihisa:
Man, this super glue was ridiculous.
My desk is totally fixed already.

Hideyoshi:
Will wonders never cease!
Looks like Yoshii got himself better glue.

Akihisa:
We crushed class E.
If we can't get some better glue out of the deal, then why bother fighting?
And she'd have a Class E desk now if I were running things.
Okay, explain to me one more time why we turned down our new desks!

Yuuji:
They're not new.
You really want the crappy wooden desks they got in Class E?

Akihisa:
It's better than these kindergarten tables that they pull out of a dumpster!
Hmm... Huh?

Minami:
I don't know why you're making such a big deal out of it.
You never use it to study anyway.

Akihisa:
But I do use it for real!
I eat lunch on it. I sleep on it. Draw stuff on it.
A desk is like a trusty steed you ride when you do battle at school!

Kouta:
Yoshii is already become one with his desk.

Yuuji:
Go ahead and kiss those tables good-bye.
With Class A declaring war on us, we'll be trading them in today.

Akihisa:
Ah...

Yuuji:
I've got this worked out, we beat those guys and their gear is ours.
I've had to change my time table, but it's no big deal.
Everything is rolling along just as I thought.
Right, Himeji?

Mizuki:
Ah... I guess so.

Yuuji:
All right, what do you say we check out Class A.

Minami:
So this is Class A...

Hideyoshi:
It seems more like a four star hotel.

Akihisa:
Humph.
Now you see what I'm talking about.
I could like so see myself sleeping in here.

Minami:
Look at that, Yoshii!
It's like a free coffee shop. they can eat at whenever they want!

Akihisa:
Yeah, don't let them think you're blown away by their awesomeness 'cause then they've got you.
Just try to act casual like me.

Hideyoshi:
You're the absolute picture of nonchalance, Sir table hand.

Yuuko:
My, my. I didn't think we started 'till tomorrow.

Hideyoshi:
Hey, Sis.

Yuuko:
I understand if you wanna throw in the towel.

Yuuji:
Nah. We thought we'd check out our new stuff before we take it from you.

Yuuko:
Well, look at the little narcissist.

Yuuji:
That's a pretty big word for a chick.
I thought you might wanna mix it up a bit.
Have a rep duel instead.

Yuuko:
And you're an idiot, too! Wow!
In what world could any of you possibly duel our top student.

Yuuji:
Getting scared?
Seems like it, since you're picking on the weakest class here while they're still recovering from their last battle.

Shouko:
We can do this right now if you like.

Yuuko:
Wait.

Shouko:
I accept. This duel is mine.

Yuuko:
But Shouko...

Shouko:
Only... I have one condition.
The loser has to do one thing the winner says unconditionally.

Akihisa:
Ah...

Yuuji:
So that's the reason you're picking on Class F all of a sudden.

Yuuko:
Don't be absurd; it is our duty to confront you.
We are Class A and, as such, represent the highest standards of this school.
You've set something in] emotion here.
When bottom feeders start wars without even cracking open a book, somebody needs to teach them a lesson.

Yuuji:
Fine by me.
The loser does what the winner says.
This should be an entertaining duel.

Yuuko:
It's not a duel. It's five against five.

Everybody:
Argh!

Shouko:
But, Yuuko...

Yuuko:
I'm certain our Rep would emerge victorious.
But the wise are also prudent.

Yuuji:
All right.
We'll go along with this five-on-five duel as long as Class F gets to pick the subjects to battle in.

Shouko:
We are agreed.

Narrator:
And with that the battle had been set.


Akihisa:
What were you thinking?
Why'd you agree with that creepy psycho?!

Yuuji:
Relax. They haven't got a chance against us.
And now we'll get to boss them around whenever we're finished.

Hideyoshi:
Uh, don't be so sure.
From what I hear, Shouko is not really the girl you wanna mess with.
If you get what I'm saying...

Akihisa:
Oh, yeah?

Hideyoshi:
Everybody says how smart and pretty she is.
But for whatever reason, the boys in this school don't wanna go anywhere near her.

Minami:
That is weird. Guys love the pretty nut jobs.

Hideyoshi:
Well apparently, she's a total ice princess to men.

Akihisa:
How could she not like us guys?
I mean... Wait a minute... so... what if she's after...
...R-Ridiculous. There's no way that'll ever happen.
I mean no judgment.
But that's just stuff they make up for late night cable.
Right? Back me up here!

Minami:
It's real.

Akihisa:
What?

Minami:
There's this one girl... she's always jumping me!

Miharu:
There's my sweet, baby!

Minami:
Miharu?!

Miharu:
Why do you always wanna hurt me?
You left me just so see you could hang around with these stupid little boys and hide your love away!

Minami:
Hey, xxx okay, xxx

Akihisa:
Who's that?

Kouta:
Miharu Shimizu, 2nd year, Class D.

Minami:
Stop it!
Get off of me!

Miharu:
There's no reason to be shy, sweetie!
I know deep down inside you really love me, and I can't wait 'til you realize it!

Minami:
For the last time, I told you I don't swing that way!
Yoshii! A little help here please!

Akihisa:
And I'm afraid she's right.
But I can see why you're confused.
Shimada's got small boobs, they're barely even there, a bad temper and kind of just looks like a dude and figure-four leg lock, argh!!

Minami:
I do not look like a dude! Take it back!

Miharu:
That's right! I love Shimada because she's a beautiful woman!

Akihisa:
I give! I give up!

Minami:
You're not getting out of this!

Akihisa:
You're breaking my leg!
Okay, I give!
I'll do anything you say!

Minami:
Really? That's so sweet!
Then you're gonna take me out.
I expect crepes at La Veditz by the train station.

Akihisa:
What?! That place? It's too expensive...

Minami:
Fine!

Akihisa:
Ahh! No. Okay, I'll do it!

Minami:
Good, from now on, you'd better try to be super nice and call me Lady Minami, and I get to call you Aki.

Akihisa:
Y-Yes, sir! My Lady!

Minami:
I want... I want... You should... You should just say... say you love me some time!

Akihisa:
Fine... Here goes...

Miharu:
No you won't!

Akihisa:
Ughhh!

Minami:
Say it!

Akihisa:
Argh! No! No!

Kouta:
Almost... Almost... Almost...

Akihisa:
Arh, you're xxx my legs...

Minami:
Say it! Say you love me right now or lose the leg!

Akihisa:
Y-Yes, ma'am!
You love me right now or lose the leg!

Minami:
You... idiot!!!!

Akihisa:
That was not real fun for me.
Ah... Himeji?
Must be an important letter you're working on?

Mizuki:
Ah! Yoshii, don't!

Akihisa:
That totally looks like a love letter.
Why would anyone risk writing a love letter at school in their classroom?

Mizuki:
It isn't like that.
Okay, you got me. It is...
But it's not really what you... what you're thinking.

Akihisa:
It's a silly cursed chain letter.

Mizuki:
And now you've managed to make things even more complicated.

Akihisa:
Is it to someone in our class?

Mizuki:
Yes...

Akihisa:
Okay.
Then how about I teach you how to write a really good one that'll freak everybody out.

Mizuki:
No thanks.
It's not a pass it on or be cursed letter.

Akihisa:
Stop! I know it's one of those!
Oh, Great. See, the curse is working on me already!

Mizuki:
It's not like that.

Akihisa:
I see...
What's so great about this guy?
I bet you'll say he's hot.

Mizuki:
Well, I don't care how he looks.
But I think he is pretty and cute!
You know, my friends were always saying that when you and Yuuji are walking together that they can't keep their eyes off of you because your guys are so perfect.

Akihisa:
Your friends sound pretty nice.
You should keep them around.

Mizuki:
They also are pretty sure that you're the doughnut to his banana.

Akihisa:
You should lose those friends.

Mizuki:
He's... It's not all about the way he looks, it's about his insides.

Akihisa:
Well, who among us doesn't have a fabulous spleen.

Mizuki:
Pretty sure that's not what I meant.

Akihisa:
Oh, you mean his personality.

Mizuki:
Uh-huh. He's so kind and cheerful.
I always see him happy.
I've liked him ever since the first time I met him.

Akihisa:
That's great.
So this letter...

Mizuki:
What about it?

Akihisa:
I hope you'll get the response you've been waiting for.

Mizuki:
Thank you!


Yuuji:
Here's where you've been hiding?
Ready to start talking strategy?
Oh, man. What's with you?

Akihisa:
I don't wanna talk to you!
I don't want you walking with me!

Yuuji:
Come on, dude. Talk to me.
Tell me what's wrong, man.

Akihisa:
I'm not... I'll never be...
I'll never be your doughnut!

Yuuji:
Huh...



Ms. Takahashi:
Okay, it's time to start round one.

Hideyoshi:
Unbelievable. Why am I the round whore?

Akihisa:
What're you talking about, Hideyoshi?
Do you see anyone else around here as pretty as you?

Hideyoshi:
Good point, though you're aware I'm not a girl.

Ms. Takahashi:
One player from each class, please step forward.

Yuuji:
Don't screw it up, all right?!

Minami:
Watch and learn, boys, 'kay?

Yuuko:
I'll try to get this over with quickly.
No sense in torturing the unfortunate.

Minami:
Don't let the F fool you, you're going down!

Ms. Takahashi:
And here we go.

Minami:
Right, summoning my Avatar... Summon!
Oh, I forgot to mention something, my test scores in math would have easily put me in Class B.

Yuuko:
Oh wow, I think I might start crying.
Summon!

Minami:
That sucks!

Yuuko:
Oh, I forgot to mention that my math scores put me in A.

Ms. Takahashi:
Winner, Yuuko Kinoshita, Class A.

Akihisa:
What can you do?
It's not like that Class B brain of yours could have beat a Class A one just because your math sucks but...
I'm not so whole yet. It feels so good stretching ...

Kouta:
Almost... Almost...


Announcer:
Round Two!

Ms. Takahashi:
The second round begins now.
Players, step forward.

Miho:
Class A, Miho Satou.

Yuuji:
Well, it's on you.
Sink or swim, dude.

Akihisa:
Why me?
You know if I lose, we're screwed.

Yuuji:
Don't sweat it.
We both know you can do this.

Akihisa:
I guess so...
Does that mean it's about time to bring out the big guns?

Yuuji:
Hell yeah. Can't keep it locked up forever.
You need to let everybody know what you can really do.

Akihisa:
That's cool. I guess I'll live.

Miho:
Oh, no... You're him!

Akihisa:
Yup, and this is like the first time I've been serious in my life.

Miho:
It's true... You're really the one...

Akihisa:
Yes I am. I don't like to spread it around.
I've tried to hide it, but no more...
High five with my left hand.

Ms. Takahashi:
The winner is Miho Satou from Class A.

Minami:
You thought just because you were left-handed that would somehow make you smart?

Akihisa:
My arm... My arm... My arm...!

Kouta:
Almost... So close... Oh please...

Yuuji:
Our real fight is coming up now! Game face time.

Akihisa:
Oh, thanks! And what happened to both of us knowing that I can do this?

Yuuji:
Well, I never said what it was you could do.

Akihisa:
I seriously wanna punch your head with my left hand right now!


Ms. Takahashi:
Okay, students onto the third round!
Aiko Kudou from Class A against Kouta Tsuchiya from Class F.
Have you picked your subject yet?

Kouta:
Phys Ed. along with Health.

Aiko:
Well, well.
There's a rumor going around that you're something of an athlete.
I bet no body's ever told you how amazing I am.
And how hard I work my body.
And how much I sweat.

Kouta:
I feel sick...

Akihisa:
I'm coming!
How dare you hurt him like that! You're taking advantage of his disability.
That's sick!

Aiko:
You could always step in for him if you like.
But academics aren't really your thing, right?
If you don't mind getting a little rough I can teach you Physical Education and Health.
Of course then... I'll make you sweat.

Mizuki:
Yoshii!

Minami:
Aki!
You stay away from him!
He doesn't need a girl to teach him anything!

Mizuki:
Yeah, that's right!
Yoshii isn't ever going to need your sweat education!

Akihisa:
Okay, you're depressing me with all the negatives...

Dude, stay down!

Kouta:
I'm okay. Just dizzy.

Ms. Takahashi:
All right. Then let's begin the match.

Kouta:
Summon.

Aiko:
Summon!

Akihisa:
Over 400 points!

Aiko:
Practice versus theory.
We finally get to see which is stronger.
Say good-bye, you little perv!

Kouta:
Accelerate...
Acceleration complete.

Aiko:
That can't be... I really lost?!

Ms. Takahashi:
Winner, Kouta Tsuchiya, Class F.

Akihisa:
He's strong!
His Health and Phys Ed. score alone is bigger than all my scores combined!


Ms. Takahashi:
And now we move to Round Four.

Mizuki:
Okay then, time to fight.

Akihisa:
Go kick some butt, Himeji.

Mizuki:
Uh-huh.

Kubo:
I will fight this one.

Yuuji:
That's Toshimitsu Kubo.
This is the match we have to win.

Akihisa:
Why is that?

Yuuji:
He's the No. 2 student here.
Unless she picks one of his weak subjects, it'll be tough one.

Akihisa:
Holy crap!

Ms. Takahashi:
Tell us, in what subject will you be fighting?

Kubo:
I would like all subjects combined.

Akihisa:
He can't do that! It's our choice! Tell him to...

Mizuki:
That's fine with me.

Akihisa:
Or not?

Yuuji:
This is not good.
When you fight in combined subjects, your strength is basically your rank.

Akihisa:
And he is...

Ms. Takahashi:
Begin the match!

Kubo:
Now, summon.

Minami:
Look at that score!
That No. 2 student must be smart!

Akihisa:
Himeji!

Mizuki:
I am summoning my Avatar...
Summon!

Everyone:
It's over 4000?!

Yuuji:
She's right up there with the top student in the academy.

Kubo:
From where did your skill level originate?!

Mizuki:
I just decided... to do my best!
I know why our class started Summoner Test Wars this year.
They're such a good class you can't help but like them.
They always try to help each other.
And that's more important than anything to me.
Besides, I've still got a letter to give one of them.
That's why I can't give up!
I have to give my all...

Ms. Takahashi:
The winner, from Class F, is Mizuki Himeji.

Minami:
Can you believe this, Aki?
Somehow we're tied with the top class in school!

Akihisa:
Himeji...

Hideyoshi:
So the next match decides our whole thing, I guess.


Ms. Takahashi:
Okay, it's time to begin the fifth and final round.

Yuuji:
Well then, I guess it's my turn.

Akihisa:
Ready?

Yuuji:
We'll sure find out.
Yuuji Sakamoto, Class F Rep.

Shouko:
Class A Representative, Shouko Kirishima.

Ms. Takahashi:
Very well, what is your subject?

Yuuji:
Why not raise the stakes.
I'd like a restricted Japanese history test.
How about we limit the questions elementary school level with a perfect score of 100.

Boy:
A test match?

Boy:
They're not using their Avatars?!

Narrator:
This Summoner Test War is based on the students' scores on the actual test in the real world.
As long as the attending teacher approves, the chosen test can be on any subject for any skill level.

Ms. Takahashi:
You heard what he said, I will get the test prepared, and the players can go wait for me in the classroom.

Akihisa:
Have you lost your mind, Yuuji?!

Hideyoshi:
Fighting it out on an elementary school test will simply get you each a perfect score.

Minami:
The best we can do now is a tie!

Mizuki:
Not necessarily, now even a simple mistake may lead lost for that side.

Minami, Akihisa:
Ah!

Yuuji:
Exactly.
Now the battle is only about strength of concentration and will power.

Akihisa:
Oh, man...

Yuuji:
Just trust me, you guys. I've got this.
Whenever Shouko memorizes something, she never forgets it.

Akihisa:
Isn't that bad since history battle is all about memorizing?

Yuuji:
No, that's how we'll win.
Shouko seems to think that the Taika Reform happened in the year 625.
She memorized them as "the Taika alive in 625."
I just need that one question on the test, and I'll win.

Akihisa:
Hold on, Yuuji!
The Taika Reform did not start in the year 625?!

Yuuji:
No, the rhyme's Taika alive in 645.
But it's easy to get confused if someone teaches it to you wrong.

Akihisa:
Okay...

Yuuji:
Hello, workstations from Class A.
You're about to become Class F's.


Ms. Takahashi:
Okay, you may begin the test.

Minami:
It's about time.

Akihisa:
Hmm...

Hideyoshi:
What happens if there isn't a question about the Taika Reform?

Akihisa:
If Yuuji can't keep his focus and loses his concentration, then she'll definitely beat him.

Mizuki:
But that question might not even get asked...

Akihisa:
I know...

Akihisa:
He got it.

Ms. Takahashi:
Okay, I have the test results tabulated.
For Shouko Kirishima, our Class A Rep... 97 points.

Akihisa:
That's right!

Hideyoshi:
I can't believe that Little Miss Sunshine didn't get a perfect score!

Minami:
We're getting our class room make over big time!

Mizuki:
Can't believe it!

Akihisa:
I know!

Ms. Takahashi:
Now for the score made by the Class F Rep, Yuuji Sakamoto.
53 points.


Narrator:
Class F's low tables turned into cardboard boxes.


-- ED --


Akihisa:
I didn't think it could get worse.
What is up with that score?!
Did you stroke out or something?!

Yuuji:
Guess that's my real skill level.

Akihisa:
What use is your stupid plan if you can't even get a hundred points?!

Yuuji:
Sometimes in life you just get hit with an unknown X-factor.

Akihisa:
Especially when the X-factor is your own puny brain!

Shouko:
Yuuji.

Everyone:
Ah...

Shouko:
Your promise. It's time.

Akihisa:
Right, the promise...
He's gonna do whatever she tells him to.

Yuuji:
I didn't forget. Let's have it.

Akihisa:
You can't do this, Shouko!
It only happens on cable!

Shouko:
Yuuji... I want you to go out with me.

Everyone:
Huh?

Yuuji:
I thought you'd finally given up on that.

Shouko:
I can never give up.
You're the one I'll always like best.

Yuuji:
Can I say no?

Shouko:
You can't.
You made a promise, and now we're going out on a date.

Yuuji:
Wait a minute. Can't we talk... Urgh!

Minami:
Okay, what's that about?

Mizuki:
Don't know. But so sweet.

Akihisa:
Then, what was the deal with Shouko always looking at Himeji?

Hideyoshi:
I don't know, maybe she was simply trying to intimidate the competition.

Akihisa:
Umm, I'm sorry, Himeji.
Our classroom is even worse than before all of this.

Mizuki:
I like our classroom.

Akihisa:
Huh?

Mizuki:
Class F is like my new home.
And I think that I love it.
And besides... I've got you here with me.

Minami:
You know what? I'm hungry.
And Aki still owes me some crepes.

Akihisa:
Ah? We're not supposed to do that until the weekend!

Minami:
There's no time like the present.
Machi no lieben. (Germany?)

Akihisa:
No way! You're gonna make me blow my whole food budget before my parents can send any more money!

Mizuki:
Hold on, Yoshii promised he would take me out to the movies instead.

Akihisa:
Himeji, this may sound bad.
But how come I have no memory of asking you out?

Mizuki:
'Cause I just made it up now.

Minami:
Come on! It's time to go eat some crepes, you guys!

Mizuki:
I can't wait to see what movie you pick for us!

Akihisa:
Please don't! Nooooo!
I have a limited budget.
I've got each issues with my bread sugar and need my food.

Hideyoshi:
I didn't think it could be possible.
But he may just be a genuine idiot.

Kouta:
Mm.


-- Preview --

Narrator:
Question 3.
What do you call the part of your household budget that is spent on food?

Akihisa:
I only get salt and water this week.

Narrator:
I didn't ask you how you'd spend your budget.

Akihisa:
Next time, "Food Budget, Dates and Stun Guns."

Narrator:
This will be on the test.
