  Minami:
Come on! Just let me see it!

Akihisa:
Stop!

Minami:
Jerk, what's wrong with you?
Why do you have this?!

Akihisa:
Ah...

Minami:
You know you didn't have to be all creepy about it.
If you wanted to see, you could've just asked.

Akihisa:
Well, actually it's funny.
I thought this was a picture of Hideyoshi.
You two look so much alike... especially...
I can't breathe!!!

Minami:
Take it back!!! I said take it back!
Acknowledge my hotness!

Akihisa:
This is abuse! People go to jail for this, you know!

Minami:
Mr. Nishimura, may we have your permission to fight a practice STWar please?

Mr. Nishimura
Yes. I approve.

Minami:
Summoning Avatar. Summon!

Akihisa:
Summoning Avatar. Summon!
Oh, really? Summon!
I'm summoning!
Summon! Summon! I said summon!
Okay, that was weird.
Let's try this again.
Summon! Summon! Summon! Summon! Summon!

Mr. Nishimura:
Approval suspended!
The... The field's out of control.


-- OP --


Narrator:
Problems always seem to occur when we least expect them.


Kouta:
You ready?

Akihisa:
Uh...

Kouta:
What's the secret passcode?

Akihisa:
Makes me too frisky.

Kouta:
'Kay.

Akihisa:
Where is it?

Kouta:
Hand over the cash first.

Akihisa:
Ooh... there's Hideyoshi as a cute little waitress...
He makes life so delicious.

Kouta:
I've got more if you want.
How about a locker room shot?
Costs you twice as much though.

Akihisa:
Oh...
Dude, come on! Give me a discount!
You know I can barely even afford to eat these days!

Kouta:
Buy it and I'll throw this one in for free.

Akihisa:
Well, that is pretty hot.
All right, I'll do it.


Nemoto:
Come on...
I gotta say, expected it to be easier...
There. Oh, you can't be serious?
They want another password?
Dammit!
Oh, man...
That was a close one!
Ahhhh!


Principal:
Something's not right here.

Ms. Takahashi:
Excuse me, ma'am.
We have a problem .
Something is wrong with the Summoner Test system.

Principal:
Yes. I'm aware of that.


Akihisa:
This is crazy.
I can't believe they've spread this far.
What is going on?

Yuuji:
Okay, that's annoying.

Akihisa:
Ow, ouch!

Boy:
Get off me!

Akihisa:
Ahhh! Ow, ow! Stop it!

Mr. Nishimura:
Listen up.
I'm getting sick and tired of your pranks, Yoshii!

Akihisa:
What the crap?
Why is this automatically my fault?!

Yuuji:
Why'd you have to break it?
You suck.

Hideyoshi:
It'll be all right.
Just tell us how to fix it.

Kouta:
No one will be mad at you, I promise.

Akihisa:
Great, you guys, too?!

Minami:
Aki, it's obvious it's you.
No one else's Avatar's acting like that.
What the...? Where'd she go?

Hideyoshi:
Interesting.
I wonder if there's something wrong with the system.

Mizuki:
I'm gonna try summoning my Avatar.
Summon!

Hideyoshi:
This is not appropriate.

Mizuki:
Ahh! Close your eyes, please!

Yuuji:
My eyes...!

Shouko:
She asked us to close our eyes, Yuuji.

Akihisa:
Is this is the future? Are we looking at grown-up Himeji right now?

Kouta:
Looking at something growing up.
That's for sure.

Minami:
I'm gonna summon my Avatar, too! Summon!

Akihisa:
Figures why am I not surprised Minami's Avatar grows everywhere except in the... Frankenstein?!

Kouta:
Mm, I'm a genius.
If I zoom in a bit, I can see everything.

Mizuki:
Ah, please don't do that...

Akihisa:
Oh, yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

Mizuki:
Please don't take thata picture! Please!
Fine then, you leave me no choice]!
Stop!

Kouta:
A skeleton...

Akihisa:
It worked in theory, Kouta.
Good idea.

Kouta:
Maybe I just need to try a different angle.

Hideyoshi:
It's kind of like playing dress-up, isn't it?
I think I'll try summoning my Avatar. Summon!
Oh, no!
Don't eat me, Mr. Big Bad Wolf!
Stop that.
Those aren't for you.

Akihisa:
Could have told you this was gonna happen.
You make a hot girl though.
It hurts to look at you!

Hideyoshi:
Well, this clarifies everything.
The whole system is out of order!

Yuuji:
Well then, better give it a shot before it's fixed.
Summon!

Shouko:
Beautiful...
I've got to try it. Summon!

They look great together.

Yuuji:
Hey, man. Let's see what yours looks like.

Kouta:
Summon.

Hey, stop.

Yuuji:
I know you want...

Kouta:
Stop! stop!

Yuuji:
Ugh...
Hold on!
I didn't...
I don't have control over what he does!
You know the system is screwed up!
Ahhh!

Shouko:
You've betrayed me, Yuuji.

Mizuki:
You're the only one who wasn't done is Yoshii.
Don't you wanna see what it looks like?

Minami:
I know I do!

Akihisa:
Yeah, all right. Summon!

This really sucks.
Why is my Avatar the only one that's freaking out like this?

Minami:
Ah, they're normal again.
Ahh!

Hideyoshi:
What's going on now!

Yuuji:
Everything, they're possessed!

Hideyoshi:
Where are they going?

Akihisa:
This is insane.


Ms. Takahashi:
The teachers' Avatars are the closest to the core of the system, but it appears they are completely frozen and cannot be summoned.
The students' Avatars are obviously out of control.

Principal:
I don't get this.
There's no way to access the crime prevention system in the server room.
As it is right now, we can't even open the door, much less go in to fix it.

Ms. Takahashi:
What if we turn off the power and completely restart the system?

Principal:
The power supply unit keeps everything functioning for at least a month in case of shutdown.

Ms. Takahashi:
I see...
Then I guess we're going to have to break through the wall and enter that way.

Principal:
We must remedy this before presenting the system at the conference tomorrow.
Showing them a huge hole in the wall would be terribly embarrassing.

Ms. Takahashi:
Well then, what do you propose that we do?

Principal:
Hmm... Perfect.
We'll get one of the idiot students to do it.

Akihisa:
How am I supposed to fix it?!

Principal:
A probationary student's Avatar is run from a separate area of the system.
So, unlike your classmate's Avatars, yours will not be affected by the malfunction.

Hideyoshi:
That makes sense.
Explains why Akihisa's second self is the only one that was behaving normally.

Akihisa:
It wasn't normal. I couldn't even summon him.

Principal:
That's because the teacher's field you used had also have affected.
But if I recall, you do have your own field, don't you?

Akihisa:
Oh, yeah. I guess I could use my iron bracelet.

Principal:
All you have to do is send your Avatar into the server room and reconnect the cable.
When that's done, I'll shut down the crime prevention system from the terminal and open the door.

Yuuji:
Only a probationary student's Avatar can pull this off .
Their ability to touch objects is crucial here.

Akihisa:
You know that how is he supposed to get in there?
He can't just bust through the wall.

Principal:
Good question.
The system's equipped with a cooling vent.
I'm sure he is small enough to walk through it.

Minami:
Yeah, but Aki can't see inside the vent, how is he supposed to control the little guy?

Kouta:
Check this out.
Video camera and transmitter.

Mizuki:
If we have his Avatar take it with him, then we can see everything that's going on.

Akihisa:
Good call, we love Kouta, yes we do!

Hideyoshi:
You just carry those things with you.
What were you gonna use them for?

Akihisa:
Don't judge him!
He's just misunderstood, and by misunderstood I mean a little...

Hideyoshi:
I was merely asking a question, I wasn't judging him.

Yuuji:
Akihisa is an extremely loyal customer.

Principal:
The effective field area for the iron bracelet is small.
You'll have to go to the front of the server room to control your Avatar.
We'll guide you from out here.

Akihisa:
I guess that's where he goes in.
Awaken! Now, summon!
Let's go!

Mizuki:
Look, there he is! He's inside the vent.

Minami:
Okay, it's clear!

Yuuji:
You're all good. Just keep going straight.

Akihisa:
Got it.

Ms. Takahashi:
Are you sure about this?
He is a probationary student.
What if he just causes more trouble?

Principal:
Then we'll have to hope he doesn't.
Unfortunately, that idiot's the only one who can use the iron bracelet.

Hideyoshi:
Count three turns and make a right, then take a left at the next intersection.

Akihisa:
Am I in a labyrinth? There it is.
Why's it have to be so complicated?

Principal:
It's just a security measure.

Akihisa:
Ow! xxx everything hurts like ban?!
Why is my score going down!
What's happening?!

Narrator:
Walk through a poisonous swamp.

Akihisa:
Why the hell would there be swamp in here?!

Principal:
It's just a security measure.

Yuuji:
Dude, you can go around it.
Turn right at the next corner.

Akihisa:
I see a light!

Yuuji:
You're almost there. Just keep going straight.

Akihisa:
Ah? I wonder what it is?
Avatars?!

Minami:
The psycho Avatars're in there!

Mizuki:
They're about to attack!

Akihisa:
Knock it off, Yuuji!

Yuuji:
It's not me, man.
They're out of control!

Akihisa:
They're what?
No, they're not, shut up! No, stop!
Help! You guys please make them stop!
Yuuji! Hideyoshi! Minami! Himeji! My dad!
Don't do this! I'm begging you!

Akihisa:
Uh...

Mr. Nishimura:
Meet me in the remedial class room.

Akihisa:
Noooo!


-- EYE CATCH --


Mizuki:
You okay, Yoshii?
What happened?

Akihisa:
I just hung out in hell for a bit.

Hideyoshi:
What kind of remedial class was it?

Ms. Takahashi:
Let's continue moving forward.
We will now be taking the recovery test to help bring up your scores.

Minami:
Unless he makes a really good score, he'll be screwed if he runs into any more of our Avatars.

Mizuki:
If you want, I can help you.
Study, I mean.
It'll be fun if we do it together.

If you want... I can help you...

Yoshii:
What?

Mizuki:
It'll be fun if we do it together.

Yoshii:
Yes.
I want to do it with you more than anyone in the world.
Study, I mean.

Hideyoshi:
Why do I get the impression that your test scores are the last thing on your mind?

Shouko:
The only method that will actually work is one that produces immediate results.

Yuuji:
In that case, I think I have the answer.

Everyone:
Huh?

Minami:
I get it.
You make the test like bonehead easy and Aki can actually get a good grade.

Yuuji:
And it's only kinda cheating...

Hideyoshi:
Whoa!
I've never seen Akihisa do so well on a test before.

Mizuki:
You're doing such a good job, Yoshii!

Minami:
Don't mess it up, Aki!

Yuuji:
You have got to be kidding me.
Which one did you miss?
You didn't know the Taika Reforms took place in 645?
How could you miss that after everything that happened?

Akihisa:
I'm under a lot of pressure here, I got confused, okay?

Hideyoshi:
Even with that, he did mange to bring his score up quite a bit.

Minami:
So he's not a total loser, I mean, if those guys come back, he should be okay.

Kouta:
He'll be fine. Let's do this.

Akihisa:
All right!
Summon!
I can clear this thing for sure!
Just wait and see.

Yuuji:
Okay, left turn at the next intersection.

Akihisa:
Right!
Ahh!

Narrator:
It was the poisonous swamp.

Yuuji:
I guess we need to teach him some tricks to avoid that.

Akihisa:
I'm not an animal!

Yuuji:
Okay, so this time, take a right.

Akihisa:
I know.
What the..?

Yuuji:
All right, Listen, you're gonna have to be really careful here.
If you touch it, you'll...

Akihisa:
Ahhh!

Mizuki:
Oh, my gosh!

Minami:
Aki!

Akihisa:
I can't breathe...

Yuuji:
Which part of "be careful" did you not understand?

Akihisa:
I couldn't help it! It was a habit!
Hm? What's that?

Hey, what's up, guys?
I'm ready for you this time.

In your face!

Mizuki:
Yoshii, you have to stay focused!

Minami:
Look out, Kouta's right behind you!

Akihisa:
I got this.
The subject we're fighting is history.
If the match [turns into/xxx isn't] battling without his Health and Phys. Ed. knowledge, he's dead before he even attacks!

Narrator:
It was the poisonous swamp.

Mr. Nishimura:
Those who died meet me in the remedial class room!

Everyone:
Huh...

Hideyoshi:
How's that fair!

Yuuji:
We weren't even fighting, our Avatars are possessed, man.

Mr. Nishimura:
I don't wanna hear it.

Kouta:
You're freakishly strong.

Akihisa:
I made it!

Principal:
Look for a disconnected cable.
And when you find it, connect it.

Akihisa:
Okay!
Huh? Found it!

Minami?!

Minami:
Aki!

Mizuki:
Run!

Akihisa:
Not yet!

Mizuki:
Please hurry!
If you don't, it could get worse!

Akihisa:
Himeji?

Mizuki's Avatar:
One, two, three!

Akihisa:
Ow!

Mizuki:
Hold on, Yoshii!
He can't win this one!

Minami:
Aki!

Akihisa:
Ow! Ow!
Noooo!

Mizuki:
Something's coming!
Come on, summoning field! Please sync!

I think it's... it's another Avatar!

Miharu:
Honey, this xxx!

Minami:
Miharu?!

Miharu:
Hello sugar cups, you didn't think I let you and your holograph of hotness fight that thing alone, did you?
Besides, it's my duty to protect you from breathing gross boy air.

Akihisa:
Now!

Mr. Nishimura:
To the remedial class room.

Minami:
I don't wanna...

Miharu:
This is gonna be so fun!

Akihisa:
Himeji! I'm sorry!
Not too bad. Huh?

Ahhh! Dammit!

Mizuki:
Yoshii, please run!
You won't be able to beat her.

Akihisa:
No way...
I've come too far... I'm not backing down.

Mizuki:
Yoshii, no!

Akihisa:
Come on... I'm so close...!

Ms. Takahashi:
He won't be able to fight much longer.
We need to stop him.
As educators, it's our first responsibility to keep our student's...

Akihisa:
No, I'm fine!

Ms. Takahashi:
Huh...

Akihisa:
I still have some points left!

Ms. Takahashi:
There's too big of a gap between the scores right now.
And your ability level is too low!

Akihisa:
I don't care! Wait...!
That's right. You guys!
I can raise my ability level the same way!
The test doesn't have to be about my own actual ability!
Himeji! Take the recovery test!

Mizuki:
Uh?

Akihisa:
Just take it!

Mizuki:
Oh, I get it now!

Principal:
Hm.

Mizuki:
Ms. Takahashi, can I take it?

Ms. Takahashi:
It's risky.
If you raise your score even by one point, he won't have a chance.

Mizuki:
I'm done. Please grade it!

Yes, you did it!

Ms. Takahashi:
I don't believe this.
Zero points!

Akihisa:
Hmm... Good work, little guy.
Huh?

Ms. Takahashi:
It worked. The system has been recovered!

Principal:
At least for the time being...
I'm impressed.


-- ED --


Mizuki:
You did great!
Are you okay, Yoshii?!

Akihisa:
Yeah, just one hanging out's not gonna hurt me.

Mr. Nishimura:
Those who died with a pathetic sore of zero meet me in the remedial class room!

Akihisa, Mizuki:
Huh...

Mizuki:
That'd be me... Guess I'll see you later...

Akihisa:
'Kay... Thanks a lot, Himeji...

Principal:
What's with the gloomy look?

Akihisa:
Ahh!
That hurts! Why would you do that?! Ahh!
My points, I'm losing them!

Principal:
Is six points really so important?
You should take the remedial class anyway with a score like that.

Akihisa:
Ahhhh....

Mizuki:
Let's go, Yoshii!

Akihisa:
Okay!

Ms. Takahashi:
I'd say that qualifies as a day.
Talk about gambling in trusting something so important to a Class F student.
But I'm glad everything worked out in the end.

Principal:
Actually no, I don't think it was much of gambling at all.

Ms. Takahashi:
Huh?

Principal:
There's a specific way to handle idiots we have here.
You'll learn... eventually.


Shouko:
I'm finished.
Will you please grade it?


[Preview]


Mr. Fukuhara:
Question 9.
One of the units used to indicate breast size is "cup."
Explain the size of an A cup, which is used as a basis?

Akihisa:
Minami Shimada!

Mr. Fukuhara:
No comment.

Akihisa:
Next Time, "Kisses, Breasts, and Ponytails."

Mr. Fukuhara:
This will be on the test.
