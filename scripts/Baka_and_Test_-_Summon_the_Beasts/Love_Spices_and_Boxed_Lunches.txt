  Mr. Nishimura:
Hey, Yoshii.

Akihisa:
Sir!
Summon, now!

Narrator:
The Avatar of probationary student Akihisa Yoshii has special skills.
Not only can he actually touch objects in the real world, but because he has highly increased strength.

Mr. Nishimura:
Go get the world map.

Akihisa:
All right.

Narrator:
The teachers force him to help with their chores.

Mr. Nishimura:
Yoshii!
They need six more desks to the audio-visual room right now!

Akihisa:
Huh...

Mr. Nishimura:
Yoshii! The soccer goalpost needs to be moved back.

Akihisa:
Again? Why am I the only one who gets ordered around?!

Mr. Nishimura:
You're a probationary student. Get used to it.

Akihisa:
Man, this totally sucks!

Narrator:
The probationary student feels the exactly same pain as his Avatar feels.

Mr. Nishimura:
You've got a pop quiz coming up, so be sure to review what you've learned so far.

Akihisa:
I'll pop your quiz next time, Mr. Jerk-face!

Minami:
Idiot.


- Episode 4: Love, Spices, and Boxed Lunches --


Narrator:
Today is Sunday. However...

Mr. Nishimura:
That's it for today.
But make sure you go over it again when you get home.

Class F's guys:
Yes, sir.

Narrator:
But even on a Sunday, Class F sometimes has a remedial lesson.

Mizuki:
He's gone, Yoshii. Now tell us what happened to you.

Akihisa:
Well, I tried to kick his face in.

Hideyoshi:
It appears he backfired on you.

Akihisa:
I'm so hungry.
My stomach's not used to all that heavy lifting.
He really worked me hard.

Minami:
Your Avatar seems really cool, but he's kind of a drag.

Shouko:
Yuuji. Lunch time.

Yuuji:
Shouko?! Why are you here?
Class A doesn't have a remedial work, do they?

Shouko:
I was studying by myself.
If you're at school on a Sunday, then I'll be at school too.

Yuuji:
How about don't?

Shouko:
I'll stay at home when you do even during the week.

Yuuji:
I hope you mean your home.

Hideyoshi:
Look who decided to make their own lunch today.

Yuuji:
What is that thing?

Akihisa:
One sixty-seventh of the cup noodles.

Yuuji:
Why only one sixty-seventh?

Akihisa:
One half of one half of one half of one half of one half of one half.

Yuuji:
Akihisa, that's only one sixty-fourth, you goober.

Hideyoshi:
You're not really a whiz at fractions, huh?

Akihisa:
I'm all done eating.

Yuuji:
That's pathetic.

Hideyoshi:
A hobo would laugh at that lunch.

Minami:
Somebody has to do the right thing.
Aki, do you wanna share my lunch with me?

Akihisa:
Really?

Minami:
Yeah, I made like this massive lunch today.
It'll be silly for me to throw it out.
Do you want some?

Akihisa:
Of course!

Minami:
Give me a sec, okay? Hm?
My bad... looks like I left it at home.

Akihisa:
Oh man...

Minami:
And after I worked so hard...

Akihisa:
Don't pretend.
It's against the laws of nature for you to do girly things like share your lunch with a dude is cliche, this satisfy xxxx!

Minami:
I told you that I just forgot to bring it!
You idiot!

Kouta:
Closer... more...

Yuuji:
Ahh!

Shouko:
Looking is not allowed.

Yuuji:
My eyes!
My freaking eyes!

Hideyoshi:
We'll never be bored in here.

Haduki:
Excuse me.

Everyone:
Hm?

Haduki:
Is this the class for all the idiots?

Minami:
Haduki?!
What do you think you're doing here?

Haduki:
Ah, hey, Sis!

Akihisa:
You're Haduki?

Haduki:
Yup! And you're the idiot!

Yuuji:
Impressive, man.
I didn't think everybody in the whole world knew how stupid you were.

Akihisa:
Not the world, just this area!

Haduki:
I can't believe it! I missed you so much!

Minami:
Hey, Haduki, exactly how do you know Aki?

Haduki:
Simple. He's going to be my husband some day.
We've been dating for a while and lately we started to talk about getting married!

Everyone:
What?!

Narrator:
The two of them knew each other before today.
But that's a story I'll have to save for another time.

Minami:
Okay, Aki. What'd you do to my sister?!

Guy:
Order! The inquisition is now in session!

Akihisa:
No!
What the heck are you guys doing to me?!

Guy:
The inquisition accuses Akihisa Yoshii of breaking our blood brother's bond, which prohibits us from all chick's stuff.
Like dating, or feeling things.
How do you find?

Class F's guys:
Guilty! Guilty!

Guy:
Any last words from the defendant?

Akihisa:
Last words? What happened to the whole trial thing?!

Guy:
Guilty. Death penalty.

Akihisa:
Ahh!

Hideyoshi:
So, what grade are you in, Haduki?

Haduki:
I'm in fifth grade.

Yuuji:
Something tells me, you're way too smart for this guy.

Haduki:
Wow, I really like your pink hair!

Mizuki:
You're so sweet, Haduki.

Hideyoshi:
Wow, what brings you out this way?

Haduki:
Oh, that's right! Here!
You left these this morning.

Minami:
The lunches I made!
Thanks a lot, Haduki! How sweet!
I'm glad you brought me my really big lunch.
See? Told you I wasn't lying.
I'm perfectly capable of making lunches and all that stuff.

Haduki:
Now I see. It's starting to make sense.
You never wake up early, and you were taking so much time giggling and making noise in the kitchen, I didn't get it, but now I see what you were doing it all for...

Minami:
I have no idea what she is talking about!
She's so weird.

Hideyoshi:
I know. What she's trying to say is "you got up early to make lunch for Yoshii."

Minami:
As if!
I wouldn't bother making a lunch for Aki!

Hideyoshi:
Well, why did you wake up early then?

Minami:
I didn't make an extra lunch.
It's a German Tank! I make models.

Akihisa:
A German Tank?!

Minami:
A sweet King Tiger at a one thirty-fifth scale!

Akihisa:
It's not food?

Yuuji:
That should be a tasty lunch.
And that's bigger than one sixty-fourth of a cup of noodles.

Akihisa:
Who cares how big it is?!

Hideyoshi:
I don't know, it might be good just saying...

Akihisa:
It's a plastic model, I can't eat it!

Minami:
Nobody is eating my one thirty-fifth King Tiger Tank!
Haven't the Germans been through enough?

Hideyoshi:
Hey, is something wrong, Himeji?

Mizuki:
What? No, nothing's wrong with me!

Kouta:
Is that... your lunch?

Yuuji:
You made your lunch today, too?

Mizuki:
I did...
But I'm terrible at making food.

Akihisa:
Growl...

Kouta:
Huh?

Mizuki:
Well...
To tell you the truth... I actually made this food for Yoshii.
Yoshii, if you're still hungry, you can have this!

Guy:
Order. This inquisition is now in session.

Akihisa:
Hey! How'd you do that!

Guy:
Guilty. Death penalty.

Akihisa:
I don't even know what I'm being accused of.

Mizuki:
Please don't! It's not his fault!
Ah... Well, um...
You see I...
Give me a second...
You're all just staring...
I made it for...
Hehe.

Guy:
We torture first then death!

Akihisa:
Ahh!

Haduki:
Where's my sister?


Minami:
Hmm... Idiot...


-- Eye Catch --


Mizuki:
I don't think you should be smoking.

Akihisa:
I'll be fine...
Being burned alive is a small price to pay for a bite of the food you brought me.

Mizuki:
Sweet. You're embarrassing me.
I thought if you waited here we wouldn... you wouldn't be bothered by anyone.

Akihisa:
Whatever you say.
Whoa! It looks so good!

Mizuki:
You're too nice.
Ah... I totally forgot to get you something to drink.
I'll be right back.

Akihisa:
Ahh... Himeji... She's so beautiful and smart, on top of everything, she's awesome at cooking!

Yuuji:
In other words, too good for you.

Akihisa:
Ah, stop that! What're you doing?!

Hideyoshi:
I think I should try some as well.

Akihisa:
Ahh! Hideyoshi, No!

Yuuji:
Dial it down.
When did you get so stingy...
Urgh...

Akihisa:
Yuuji?!
Hideyoshi?!
What's the matter with you guys?!
We have to get them to the nurse's office right now, dude!
Not, Kouta too!
Oh, don't tell me... They all ate the lunch...
Well that sucks!
It looked like really good food, too.
Urgh...
That was close.
The hands of death nearly took away my soul.
That proves it then, they've all been poisoned by her food.
The smell alone nearly killed me.
I guess I'm lucky

Hideyoshi:
Uh... Akihisa...

Akihisa:
You're not dead!

Hideyoshi:
High five...
Come on, don't let me hang out like this.

Akihisa:
High five?

Hideyoshi:
If this is the end for me, I wanna go out with a semblance of machismo.
Though perhaps, I've displayed enough through the years in my crochet circle.

Akihisa:
Oh, man.
Her food has started to warp his brain!

Mizuki:
I made some of my special tea.

Akihisa:
Thanks, Himeji...

Mizuki:
Uh, what's wrong? Are they all okay?

Akihisa:
They're fine!
Taking a nap after eating helps your digestion.

Mizuki:
If you do that, you'll end up getting as fat as a cow.

Akihisa:
I'd rather be a cow and eating grass than have to kill myself eating your food.

Mizuki:
Here. Have some tea.

Akihisa:
Ah, you made it for me with your very own hands.
This is bad... What do I do?

Mizuki:
What's wrong?
You don't feel like eating?

Akihisa:
Ah... No!
Your food just looks too precious to eat.

Mizuki:
I knew it.
Bringing you lunch was dumb.

Akihisa:
Are you kidding? This is so awesome of you!
Look how happy I am!
Ha ha ha...

Mizuki:
That's good.

Akihisa:
I'll bet you're the type who likes to sneak little nibbles of your cooking in the kitchen while you're making it.

Mizuki:
They say if you eat while you're cooking, that you end up getting weight.
And besides...

Akihisa:
Besides what?

Mizuki:
I was hoping that you would be the very first one to taste it.

Akihisa:
Aw...
There's no escape now. She has you trapped!
What a crappy angel.
You're not supposed to agree with him!

Yuuji:
Akihisa...

Akihisa:
Yuuji!

Mizuki:
Have a nice nap!

Yuuji:
Yes, thanks, Himeji.
Would you do me a favor?
I really have a craving for some oolong tea right now.

Mizuki:
Sure. I'd love to.

Akihisa:
What do I do?

Yuuji:
My friend... Let me give you some words of wisdom.
Listen well.
Since ancient times, there've been certain spices that were known to act as antidotes.
And before refrigeration was invented, spices were used to cure foods for storage.
That said, when it comes to a woman and her cooking, the one spice that always rises above all others is love.

Akihisa:
You mean... I have to...

Yuuji:
That's right, amigo.
You can neutralize the poison with your love!

Akihisa:
Good bye.
I know what to do now.
This is just the first test for my truest love!
I have faith, any trials I face, I can overcome with the strength of my heart!
As long as I have the spice of love stinking up my soul.
There's no poison that can stop me.

Yuuji:
Love doesn't protect against poison. Check.

Hideyoshi,
Akihisa was such a brave friend.

Kouta:
Amen.

Mizuki:
Oh my!
What happened to Yoshii while I was gone?

Yuuji:
He said, after lunch he felt like a nap.

Mizuki:
If you sleep after eating, you'll became as fat as a cow.

Hideyoshi:
Oh, yeah... Whatever happened to Shimada?

Minami:
After all that work...
I wish I would've just been honest and asked him to eat it.

Akihisa:
It's hard to believe.
But there's actually a subject that Himeji is bad at.
Now I'm even hungrier than I was before.

Minami:
Aki...

Haduki:
Hey, Stupid, wait up!

Akihisa:
Haduki, hey.

Haduki:
Do you have any idea where my sister might be?

Akihisa:
Um, come to think of it, I haven't seen her.
"Growl"

Haduki:
Did you have lunch?

Akihisa:
There's been a lot going on so I haven't really had anything considered food.

Haduki:
Then you must be starving.

Akihisa:
Hm, yeah...
I should have eaten Minami's lunch earlier.

Haduki:
You mean Big Sister's?

Akihisa:
Uh-huh.
It would've been nice to see what kind of lunch she cooked up.
I bet it was good.

Minami:
Okay...
Aki! You can still have...

Miharu:
Hey, baby! It's lunch time!

Haduki:
You need to get some food.

Akihisa:
Ha ha ha...

Miharu:
I've been looking all over for you.
I worked really hard making this special lunch just for my gorgeous lady!

Minami:
What are you even doing here?!
Class D is not meeting today?!

Miharu:
Well, if you're here on a Sunday, then I'll be here too!
I'll stay home when you do even on a week day.

Minami:
Why is this stupid academy full freaking skitzoid stalkers?!

Miharu:
Sweetie, can't we spend an afternoon of pure bliss together eating lunch?

Minami:
Leave me alone!

Akihisa:
I guess we should check for her over that way.

Haduki:
Mm-hm.

Miharu:
You can't escape from me!

Minami:
No, get away from me!

Miharu:
I can feed you like the princess you are!

Minami:
Get down!


Miharu:
I don't know what her problem is?
She doesn't have to be shy around me.
Honey! Sugar lips!

Minami:
I really don't like her.
Forget it. I have to find Aki.
He's way more important.

Haduki:
Hi-ho, Silver, away!
Faster! Go horsy! Go!

Akihisa:
We're not supposed to run in the hallways!

Minami:
Aki... Now's my chance?
Nothing's gonna get in my way this time!

Guy:
And so the truth is revealed.
Yoshii has had two girls making lunch for him this entire time?!
I find that to be... unforgivable!
I say death to the traitor!

Class F's guys:
Death to the traitor!

Minami:
Hold on!
It's all a misunderstanding!
It's not true.
I just...
Well, I...
You know...
He he he.

Class F's guys:
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!...

Akihisa:
What?! Hey!
How do you guys do that?
Let me go, oh, come on!
You're all a bunch of mouthbreathers!
I can hear you!

Minami:
Huh...
What am I trying to do here?

Haduki:
Go, horsy! Go, yeah!
Faster! Go faster!

Akihisa:
Running in the hallways is frowned upon, Haduki.

Haduki:
This isn't a hallway, silly!

Akihisa:
Oh, yeah, looks like I'm running out of gas already.

Minami:
He's coming right toward me.
Aki!

Haduki:
Huh?

Akihisa:
Minami...

Haduki:
There you are.
I've been playing horsy with Mr. dumbdumb over there.

Minami:
That's nice.
But try not to bug him too much.

Haduki:
Sure.

Minami:
Hey, Aki...

Akihisa:
Hm?

Minami:
Did you manage to get lunch today?

Akihisa:
Uh... I sort of had some... but not really much.

Minami:
I see.
So, uh...
Did you, um...

Akihisa:
Hm?

Minami:
Well... If you think you might still be hungry...
I thought... Wh... Wh..

Akihisa:
Wh?

Minami:
Wh... Wh... Dang it. Wh... Wh...
What food do you think Hokkaido is best known for?

Akihisa:
Haha..

Minami:
Ahh!

Kubo:
Everybody knows Hokkaido's best dish, softshell crabs.

Akihisa:
Hey, Kubo.

Kubo:
It's weird seeing people up here on a Sunday.
Are you here studying by yourself?

Akihisa:
Class F has some remedial work.
"Growl"

Kubo:
Huh. Sounds like you haven't had lunch.

Akihisa:
Yeah. No, not really.

Kubo:
Would you like to accompany me?

Akihisa:
Yeah. But I don't have money.

Kubo:
Oh, well, it's no big deal.
I suppose I can cover you since it's just lunch.

Akihisa:
Heck yeah! I'm coming with you!

Minami:
Uh...

Kubo:
I guess we'll see you later then, Shimada.

I've got a great idea.
We can quiz each other for mid-terms while we're eating?

Akihisa:
Mid-terms?
Um, yeah... That sounds great...


Minami:
Well, did you eat?

Haduki:
Not at all.
I was playing with stupid head, I guess I forgot.

Minami:
You're too young to be skipping meals.
It'll keep you from growing.

Haduki:
Didn't you make this one for Aki?

Minami:
No, goofball.
Why would I do something as silly as that?
I made it for you.

Haduki:
Can we eat ours together?

Minami:
Of course!

Haduki:
Hm?

Minami:
Sorry, Haduki.
I forgot I still have another class to go to.
Why don't you head on home?

Haduki:
Sure! Watch me run fast!

Minami:
He he he...
Hmm...


Akihisa:
Hmm...
Man, I'd love to scarf Lunch A.
But I should probably be cool and order Lunch B since it's cheaper.

Mr. Fukuhara:
Hey there, Yoshii.

Akihisa:
Hey, Mr. Fukuhara.

Mr. Fukuhara:
Perfect timing.
I can't seem to get this lid to open up.
Would you mind summoning your Avatar to see if he can get it off for me?

Akihisa:
That's a piece of cake for him.
I'm summoning my Avatar. Summon!
Open!
Ow!

Mr. Nishimura:
Those who died get a remedial class, Yoshii!

Akihisa:
It can't be serious!
What? Come on! I haven't even eaten yet!

Mr. Nishimura:
I want...

Kubo:
He's so cute.
And he doesn't know it.

Akihisa:
It wasn't even a real battle!

Kubo:
I don't even know what I'm saying.

Mr. Fukuhara:
I will eat now.


Minami:
Why are you such a fricking xxx all the time?!
Ouch, stupid king xxx!
Is anyone gonna make lunch for you?!
No! You lunch alone, 'cause you're chicken!
Idiot...


Akihisa;
Ahh! No, no, no!

Minami:
Aki...

Akihisa;
Are you really... gonna toss that?

Minami:
Oh, yeah.

Akihisa;
Well, it's just... because... something...
See?
I don't think we should go around wasting stuff like that.

Minami:
Hm?

Akihisa;
Global warming is killing our planet!
And if you throw that food away, then you're a plant killer too.
And the ghost of a dead homeless dude might haunt your bathtub.
Which is also why you should recycle.
And hug a spotted owl and try to stop talking so much if you can.
It's mostly how I feel.

Minami:
He he he..
Here.

Akihisa;
Huh?

Minami:
Do you want it?

Akihisa;
Huh?

Minami:
You don't have to.

Akihisa;
Well, I guess I could try to eat it.
I never like to see food wasted...
Minami...?

Minami:
Idiot!


[Preview]

Mr. Fukuhara:
Question 5.
What do you call the sport in which you go from checkpoint to checkpoint using a map and a compass?

Akihisa:
Role-playing game!

Mr. Fukuhara:
I knew that would be your answer.

Akihisa:
Next time, "Maps, Treasures, and Striker Sigma V(Five)"!

Mr. Fukuhara:
This will be on the test.
