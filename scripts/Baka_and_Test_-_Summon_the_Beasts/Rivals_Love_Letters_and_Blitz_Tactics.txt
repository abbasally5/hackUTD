  Akihisa:
Rock-paper-scissors.
No chickening out.
Whoever loses has to start the war with Class D.
Hope you're ready, Yuuji.

Yuuji:
Plain old rock-paper-scissors is lame.
Too bad it's not rock paper kill.

Yuuji:
Well, it's not.

Akihisa:
I'm calling rock.

Yuuji:
Yeah, it was dumb.
All right, you called it.
Now if you don't use rock, I'll kill you!
Rock-paper-scissors!
Better get moving.

Akihisa:
You fricking tricked me!

Yuuji:
First of all, you walked into it.
Second of all, you should know that Class D tends to go easy on the guys that are hotter.

Akihisa:
I see.
So then I guess I should be okay, right?

Yuuji:
Uh, no.
You're not hot, dude.

Akihisa:
Whatever!
If there was a random chart of my hotness, it will be filled up with one solid color.

Yuuji:
Look a random chart.

Hideyoshi:
And you only fill up five percent.

Akihisa:
I hate you all!

Yuuji:
Don't forget! We're all counting on you, dude!

Akihisa:
I think I need an adult.


--OP--


Ms. Takahashi:
This afternoon, as planned, an STWar between Second Year Classes F and D will take place, should be interesting.

Principal:
Indeed, I do enjoy stubborn idiots.
Do you think they actually have a chance of winning?

-- Episode 11: "Rivals, Love Letters, and Blitz Tactics"

Ms. Takahashi:
I wanted to talk to you about that...

Principal:
About what?

Ms. Takahashi:
I'm concerned about Class F student Yuuji Sakamoto.
His scores have been dropping with every test he takes.

Principal:
And he is their Rep.
What exactly makes him think they'll be able to defeat Class D?
Is this all some kind of joke to them or do they think the STwars are a silly game to play when they're bored?

Ms. Takahashi:
No ma'am. I don't believe so...
Have a look.

Principal:
Hm?


Yuuji:
Clear this stuff up!
Gotta be prepared, guys.
Everything has to be put away before the battle.

Minami:
We'll need this space.
I'm guessing our new gear is gonna take up more room.

Hideyoshi:
I'll be so glad to get rid of these boxes.

Akihisa:
It'll be like we're real-life people, Himeji.
With a real-life classroom!

Mizuki:
Yup! We're gonna do it this time for sure!

Akihisa:
That letter...
Why do I keep getting the feeling it's for Yuuji?
But even if it is, he's already with Shouko.
If she still wants to give it to him...

Narrator:
Excuse me. Do we need all of these?
You realize the captions lessen my role.


Genji:
So, Class F has decided to start a war with us, because they don't wanna use boxes anymore.
Well, you know what? That's too damn bad!

Girl:
That's right!

Genji:
We're gonna show those losers that they're exactly where they belong with the garbage!

Yuuji:
All right.
Let's work on our strategy.

Akihisa:
Strategy, dude?
Don't be so dramatic.
We've got Himeji, hello, that's like an automatic win.

Hideyoshi:
He's got a point, you know.
Her strength is Class A level.

Yuuji:
But still... you never know...


Genji:
Okay, listen up!
Class E lost because they didn't know Mizuki Himeji was in Class F.
However, since we know that strategy, we have the advantage.
As you know, our room is located at the end of the new building.
And of course, theirs is in the old one.
Since our fighting power will need to spread over a large battlefield, we'll have the upper hand because our scores are much higher.

Yuuji:
If Himeji goes in there alone she's done for, it'll be easy for Class D to attack her.
She'll be surrounded and won't be able to reach the class rep.

Akihisa:
Great. Then what're we gonna do?

Yuuji:
We'll use something I like to call Blitz tactics.
First Class F will march right into the enemy's trenches attacking them from the rear.
This in turn will create an opening in their defense.
Then, Himeji...

Mizuki:
Yes.

Yuuji:
You'll be up next, you're making a surprise attack right down the center.
That'll throw everybody off and you'll be able to take down their top guy.

Mizuki:
Got it!

Yuuji:
We can't split up this time or we'll die.
Forget the defense. It's all about the attack. We got one shot at this!
No screwing around!
All right, Class D is gonna eat those boxes!

Genji:
Their defense will be weak since they'll likely put all their energy into attacking us.
Fortunately, the class rep's score is pathetically low.
If he's not guarded, we can take him out with one shot.

Everyone:
Oh...

Genji:
F's gotten cocky.
Let's go out there and crush those idiots!

Narrator:
And just like that, the war began.

Yuuji:
Okay, let's do this!

Everyone:
Yeah!

Yuuji:
Akihisa, take the front line.
You're gonna be the unit leader.

Akihisa:
What? Why me?

Yuuji:
Why?
'Cause it'll confuse them, dude.
We've never done this before, and they won't know how to respond to it.
Trust me. You're our only hope.

Akihisa:
Yeah, okay...


Boy:
Are those snakes?

Akihisa:
I'm a snake.

Boy:
Phew...
Summon!

Akihisa:
Worst plan ever!

Yuuji:
Oh, wow. How are you standing here?

Akihisa:
Because [of my/by] some freaking miracle, I didn't die!
Five of our people were just sent to the remedial class, you jerk!

Yuuji:
Kouta, let's take a look at the list.

Akihisa:
Hm?

Yuuji:
Check it out.
Tell me what their lineup was like?

Akihisa:
That one, this one and her.
They were all on the front and...
Hey yeah, I don't see the guys anywhere.

Kouta:
I don't do guy pics.

Yuuji:
I see. It doesn't look like any of these chicks are good at math.

Minami:
Sweetness! Guess that means I'm up.

Yuuji:
That's right.
All part of the plan.
We've made sure to secure Hasegawa.
We got this.

Akihisa:
Hey, anyone else remember that time I almost died?

Yuuji:
Sugawa, go ahead and make the preparations.

Sugawa:
Roger that.

Yuuji:
All right, everyone, prepare to attack!

Minami:
Mr. Hasegawa! May we have your approval?

Hasegawa:
Approval granted!

Minami:
Summon!
Here I come!
It's as if you think I'll be less of a math genius, if there are more of you.

Boy:
Hey.

Minami:
Take this, jerks!

Mr. Nishimura:
Those who died meet me in the remedial classroom!

Boy:
Ugh, oh man.

Boy:
I really don't wanna take a class from Iron Man!

Boy:
That's not even a real class! It's torture!

Mr. Nishimura:
Well then, it must be working.
Just you wait.
You'll soon be ideal students who study to relax, attending philosophy clubs on the weekends.
So prepare yourselves!

Akihisa:
All right! Let's attack their line of defense!

Class D's guys:
Ahh!

Boy:
It's the Class F rep, he's entered the new building!

Boy:
Okay, move in!

Boy:
We've got to kidnap Hasegawa!

Mr. Hasegawa:
Excuse me?!


Kouta:
So the D troop captured Mr. Hasegawa and are holding him in the bathroom.

Yuuji:
Forget him. It's a trap.

Mizuki:
But what about Minami

Minami:
Hey, what's going on with the math field?!

Akihisa:
Holy crap. No way!
That's Mr. Takenaka!
Where did he come from?

Mr. Takenaka:
Let me catch a breath.
I approve the fight in classical language.

Minami:
Oh, great.
Of course they picked that one.

Sugawa:
Don't worry, I got your back!

Akihisa:
Sugawa!
I need you to buy me some time!

Akihisa:
Okay, we're on it, right, Minami?!

Minami:
Why're you asking me?
Ah!

Miharu:
Love monkey, sorry it's come to this.

Minami:
What? Miharu?

Miharu:
I don't know that I can't even look at someone who's become a puppet in the man show much less fight them!

Minami:
Oh, boy...

Miharu:
But I'm gonna try... Summon!
There's a battle in every love story, prairie dog and don't lose hope.
If destiny wants to test our heart, let her! We will survive this.

Minami:
Will someone help me?!

Hideyoshi:
Classical language, right?

Minami:
Thank you!

Sugawa:
May I have your attention please.
This is an urgent message for Ms. Funakoshi in the math department.

Akihisa:
It's Sugawa!

Sugawa:
Akihisa Yoshii is shirtless and waiting for you in front of Class D.
He says it's important.

Akihisa:
Ugh!

Narrator:
Perhaps a little explanation is needed here.
Ms. Funakoshi is a 45-year-old single woman.
And that may be enough.
If not, let's just say she's the one who believes in extra credit.

Sugawa:
Please hurry, Ms. Funakoshi.
Young Yoshii says it's not about the assignment.
Screw the assignment.
This is about a man and his feelings.

Akihisa:
Shut up!

Minami:
Look! It's Ms. Funakoshi!

Akihisa:
Where?!

Boy:
Yoshii, you are the man, man! Best leader ever.

Boy:
That's what we call taking one for the team.

Boy,
Come on, guys!
Let's show our leader it wasn't all for nothing.

Everyone:
Yeah!

Akihisa:
I'm gonna get you, Sugawa!

Yuuji:
I wouldn't get you, cocky Class D.
I think we both know there's more than one math teacher.
Hey there, Kouta. Go get Mr. Takenaka.

Kouta:
Roger.

Hey, you might wanna check the wig.

Mr. Takenaka:
Ahh, I uhm...
I have to go be important now!

Hideyoshi:
All clear!

Minami:
Ms. Funakoshi! Please approve us!

Genji:
Ah!

Minami:
Oh good. I can win now.
Take this!

Kouta:
The path is clear!

Yuuji:
Himeji, you're up.

Mizuki:
Right!
Summoning my Avatar. Summon!

Genji:
Too late. This is over!

Kouta:
Emergency!

Yuuji:
It's Kouta, what's going on?

Boy:
Haa.

Girl:
Ha!

Kouta:
You're surrounded.
I can see them on the spy camera.

Boy:
There he is! That's their rep!
Now's our chance!
Let's go!

Yuuji:
Not so fast.
Defeating me isn't that easy.

Principal:
That kid made a fool of us, didn't he?
All this time I thought they meant to insult him by calling him a smart ass.

Boy:
No way! I heard you had the lowest score ever!

Yuuji:
Oh, you did? Sorry about that.
Bummer.
I guess I forgot to add my latest score to that list.
Intentional info leak.
Pretty hard not to fall for.

Boys:
Ugh...

Yuuji:
But I digress.
Let's go!

Genji:
Mizuki, but why?!

Mizuki:
So sorry.

Yuuji:
What a bunch of chumps!
Too easy!


-- EYE CATCH --


Mizuki:
We actually beat them!
Can you believe it?

Akihisa:
Way to be smart, man.
When did you start studying and stuff?

Yuuji:
At this stage of the game, it's not important.
We've got bigger things we need to be thinking about.
Like beating Class A!
The first thing we need to do is destroy Class B!
Who's in?!

Akihisa:
Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't Nemoto in Class B?

Yuuji:
After every one of us has taken a recovery test, we'll be ready to declare war on that jerk.
Hey, Akihisa, listen up.
I need your help with something.
And you're the only one who can do it.

Akihisa:
Why do I let you do these things?

Yuuji:
I'm just amazed you keep falling for it.

Akihisa:
Argh!

Nemoto:
Class F has decided to start a cute little war with us.
But they'll learn soon enough.

Yuuka:
I don't know if you've heard about this.
But Class F defeated both Class E and class D.

Nemoto:
Humph.
Are you afraid of the little freaklings, Yuuka?

Yuuka:
Oh, please don't make me laugh.
Class C has absolutely nothing to worry about.

Nemoto:
Then why would you even suggest that Class B might be in danger?

Yuuka:
I was simply thinking...

Nemoto:
About the mysterious winning streak, either they're cheating or have some kind of a secret weapon.
Fighting them head-on isn't a viable option.

Yuuka:
Yes, agreed.

Nemoto:
Just wait.
I'm working on a strategy.
I'll pay them back for what they did to me the other day.

Yuuji:
So that's how it's all going down.
I need you guys to tear it up out there.
We're not gonna stop winning now!

Everyone:
Yeah!

Yuuji:
All right, get out of here!

Everyone:
See you later.


Akihisa:
Are you sure it was a good idea for us not to make the exchange with Class D?

Yuuji:
Positive. I'm planting seeds as they say.

Akihisa:
I thought it was sowing.

Yuuji:
Just sit back, relax and watch what happens.


Akihisa:
What happened in here?

Minami:
Well, it's obvious what happened, but who did it?

Yuuji:
Guessing Class B.
Nobody else springs to mind.

Hideyoshi:
I guess they were trying to sabotage our recovery tests by breaking our pencils in half.

Yuuji:
Like we can't just sharpen the other side?

Kouta:
Lame...

Mizuki:
Ah!

Akihisa:
Huh?
What's the matter? Are you okay?

Mizuki:
Oh, yeah... it's nothing.

Kouta:
Ah...
Nemoto is gonna get it!

Minami:
After we kill him, I'll eat his liver!

Yuuji:
Just calm down.
There's no need to lose our cool here.

Akihisa:
Why not?

Yuuji:
Beating them in the STWar is gonna be enough payback.
Freaking out about this crap is what Class B wants.
Because if we lose focus, we won't win.

Mizuki:
Huh...


Narrator:
And thus began the showdown between Class F and Class B.

Yuuji:
Get ready, guys!
Kill them all!

Everyone:
Yeah!

Akihisa:
There they are!
Let's kick some butt!

Boy:
Class F is on the way!

Nemoto:
After all that, pathetic.
Proceed as we planned!
They still don't stand a chance!

Boy:
Charge!

Boy:
No way!
They're too strong. We can't beat 'em!
Are we really gonna go through with all this?

Akihisa:
It's class B.
We knew they were strong coming into it.

Mizuki:
Yoshii!

Akihisa:
What're you doing here?
I didn't think it was your turn yet.

Mizuki:
It's not. But Yuuji said for you to use this if you feel trapped.

Akihisa:
What is it?
Ha, yes!
Okay, you guys, listen up!
I just found out that the Class B Rep Nemoto has a girlfriend.

Everybody:
What?!

Akihisa:
He's seeing the Class C Rep, Yuuka Koyama!

Everybody:
What?!

Akihisa:
Get this.
I know for a fact that she's been making his lunches every day!

Everybody:
What?!

Narrator:
Once their outrageous fury reaches its peak, the FFF inquisition delivers merciless slaughter.
In ways that would make the remedial classes of the Iron Man feel euphoric.

Boy:
This is unforgivable!
How dare he choose to be happy?!
If we all have to suffer from being alone, so should he.

Boy:
What's with those guys?
Careful!
They look really dangerous.

Akihisa:
Who's on top now, jerks!
Come on, guys. Let's go!

Boy:
What's going on with them?!

Boy:
Why aren't they afraid of the remedial class?

Nemoto:
What is it?

Boy:
Class F is acting crazy.
I don't know what's gotten into them.
What do we do?
They've already taken out a lot of us, sir.

Nemoto:
Hm...
I think I smell an insurance policy.

Mr. Nishimura:
Those who died meet me in the remedial class room! Haa...

Akihisa:
Thanks, Sugawa...
I'll never forget the sacrifice you made ever.
Oh and I just realized that I'm not even mad about the cougar thing anymore

Hideyoshi:
I had a feeling you were holding a grudge against him about Ms. Funakoshi.

Minami:
The size of our group is shrinking.
We need to change formation!

Boy:
Right!

Boys:
Okay!

Hideyoshi:
Anyone feeling weak should go take a recovery test!

Akihisa:
Huh?
Hey, Himeji!
Ah... Nemoto. What the crap?!

Mizuki:
That was really mean of you to mess up our classroom.
Why did you have to do that?!

Nemoto:
Exactly what proof do you have that it was Class B?

Mizuki:
There isn't any...

Nemoto:
Hahaha...
Fine, okay, we did it.
Are you happy now?

Mizuki:
That does it!
I'm summoning my Avat--

Nemoto:
Oops.
That was a close one, wasn't it?

Mizuki:
Ah...

Akihisa:
Uh...

Nemoto:
Could this be a thank you note for saving you the trouble of finding evidence of our work?

Mizuki:
Don't open it.

Nemoto:
And why not?
Is it a love letter?
Talk about an unexpected bonus.
I didn't even know people still did that.
How adorable.

Mizuki:
Stop! Give it back to me right now!

Nemoto:
Not yet.
I haven't even had the chance to read it.

Mizuki:
Uh....

Nemoto:
You know,
I should probably read this when I'm not in such a hurry.

Mizuki:
Why are you being this way.

Nemoto:
I don't know.
It's not like it'll help me win or anything.
But I'll take it in lieu of insurance, thank you.
You'll get it back after the war is over.
That is if I don't change my mind, of course.
Hahaha...


Yuuji:
What're you doing here?
Did you leave the fight?
Figured you knew better than that.

Akihisa:
Don't start, dude.
I need to talk to you.

Yuuji:
What is it?

Akihisa:
I think it's time for Himeji to be taken out of this battle.

Yuuji:
Did something happen?

Akihisa:
I don't wanna talk about it.

Yuuji:
Fine. She's out.
However...

Akihisa:
Huh?

Yuuji:
By removing her from the battle, you're gonna have to take over her assignment.

Akihisa:
Of course, yeah.

Yuuji:
I need you to launch a surprise raid on them.
Use the method of your choice.
Can you handle it?

Akihisa:
Sure, I'll try.
Screw that!
I'll make it happen!

Yuuji:
That's the spirit.
Go get them, champ.

Akihisa:
Just one thing.

Yuuji:
What is it?


Hideyoshi:
No way!
Are you really gonna do that?

Akihisa:
If I have to launch a surprise raid on Class B alone, then it's the only way.

Genji:
Works in theory but who's gonna give you summoning approval?

Akihisa:
I don't need it.
I've got this little gem, remember?
Awaken!
Go!
This is nothing!
Ah!

Nemoto:
Whoa, what's going on?

Akihisa:
That's not all!

Hideyoshi:
Are you okay, Akihisa?!

Akihisa:
Yeah, I'm more than okay.
No matter what happens to me...
I made a promise and I'm gonna make this work.
I won't give up!
I don't care what those jerks do.
This one's for Himeji!

Mizuki:
What's happening?

Akihisa:
Ahhhh!
There he is!

Yuuji:
Hm?

Nemoto:
Did you really think I wouldn't be prepared for this sort of thing?
I know you were looking forward to surprising me.

Akihisa:
Shut up!
Kouta, where are you?!

Nemoto:
What the hell?!

Kouta:
Our battle will be in Health and Phys Ed.!
Summon!

Nemoto:
No way...
He can't do that!
He can't jump in there with a teacher!

Narrator:
Oh, but he can.
Iron Man is not only able to approve battles in every subject, but he can jump with the best of them.

Mr. Nishimura:
Ugh... Kill me!
This war is over!
Class F is the winner!

Yuuji:
It's a shame you guys lost.
Good try though.

Nemoto:
Yuuji...

Yuuji:
Listen up!
I've got a little proposal for you guys.

Class B guys:
Huh?

Yuuji:
Now, usually this is where we trade stuff.
We take your things and leave you with cardboard boxes.
But we'll skip that under one condition, of course.

Nemoto:
What condition?

Yuuji:
Wear this.
You'll look hot, I promise.
Oh, and you have to do whatever I tell you to from here on out.

Nemoto:
What? That's ridiculous!
What made you think I'd ever agree to that?!

Boy:
We'll make sure he agrees to it.

Boy:
We've got your back, Yuuji!

Boy:
I think this color really brings out your eyes.

Nemoto:
I am not wearing a dress!

Boy:
xxx regret this.

Nemoto:
Get off me! Stop...

Yuuji:
Did you get what you wanted?
I did.

Akihisa:
Yeah!


-- ED --


Akihisa:
Here you go, Himeji.
It's yours.

Mizuki:
Thank you, Yoshii.
It means so much to me that you did this.
I was completely worried about it.

Akihisa:
I know... I could tell...
I wanted to talk to you about it .

Mizuki:
Sorry. Guess I should've mailed it earlier.
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have ignored the chain letter's instructions.
And now I've brought everybody my bad luck.

Akihisa:
What're you doing?

Mizuki:
I was afraid to send the letter because so many bad things happen.
I didn't wanna anyone to go through all of this.
So I kept it, but then I realized...
A lot of good things happened too, so it must not be that cursed.
Don't need to hold on to this.
I should express my feelings without hiding behind the letter.
I know this won't be easy.
But telling someone in my own words how I feel just seems right.
Can I start with you?

Akihisa:
Yeah, sure.
I'm here to help.

Mizuki:
I wanted to ask you... can I... can I call you Akihisa?

Akihisa:
Uh...
Oh well, I'd normally have to say yes, but you might not wanna say that around those FFF guys, you know.

Mizuki:
I don't care about them.
Is it all right with you?

Akihisa:
Okay.


Shouko:
Yuuji, why are you obsessed with the Summoner Test wars?
Is it the boxes?

Yuuji:
'Course not.
Shouko, this isn't about desks.
This is about proving to everyone that life doesn't revolve around test scores.
It's more than that.
And that's why I'm counting on you not to go easy on them.

Shouko:
I wouldn't dream of it.
You have my word.


<Preview>

Mr. Fukuhara:
Question 12
What do you call the last scene in a story, such as a novel or play, where things get resolved?

Akihisa:
Final boss battle.

Mr. Fukuhara:
You need experience points.


Akihisa:
Next Time, "Love, Courage, and Our Battle Has Just Begun! (Temporary)"

Mr. Fukuhara:
This will be on the test.
