  Mayu: Hi, Nyu? What's up? Nyu, stop!

Nana: She didn't do anything! Don't hurt her!

Lucy: Hmm. Did you come for a rematch?

Nana: Huh...

Lucy: There's not much left to cut off, is there?

Mayu: Nana, don't!

Kohta: Aw!

Yuka: What?!

Kohta: Oh, sorry.

Yuka: Let me see.

Kohta: It's not a big deal.

Yuka: Yeah, but still you should put a bandage on it. I thought you [could / couldn't] handle the scallions without hurting yourself.

Kohta: I guess I'm crass.

Yuka: I'll be back in a second.

Kohta: I told her I'd mess it up somehow. What was that?

Lucy: Is that the best you can do? How do you plan to kill me if that's the best you've got?

Nana: Mayu, get out of here! I can do it!

Mayu: No!



[Infant]



Yuka: Huh? Hey, Kohta! Nyu's not in her room!

Kohta: Huh? What's that?

Mayu: You can't... can't do it... these things...

Nana: That was so close.

Lucy: What is this? What are you doing?

Mayu: See, Nyu, you can stop if you want to.

Lucy: This fight is not over yet.

Nana: It never is.

Mayu: Nyu, stop! No more! Stop it!

Kohta: No more! Stop it!

Mayu: Nyu!

Nana: Huh?

Manyu: What's going on?

Kohta: What're you doing out here? You scared us.

Nana: Be careful.

Nyu: Kohta.

Kohta: Ah, it feels like you still have a fever.

Nyu: Kohta! You're so nice! You're so nice! Kohta! Kohta!

Mayu: Um...before they notice, you should put them on so you don't scare them.

Nana: That girl...that's not Lucy any more...

Mayu: What?

Yuka: All we have is rice porridge. Take as much as you want. Sounds like you are hungry.

Nyu: Nyu!

Nana: Sure. That would be nice.

Kohta: Mayu, is this girl your friend?

Mayu: Ah, yes. she's my friend. Her name is Nana. She's just like me, she doesn't have a home to go to.

Kohta: I'm sorry to hear that. But why did she attack Nyu?

Mayu: Well, you see, Nana was just hungry and that made her kinda cranky. But on a full stomach, she's actually really well-behaved.

Nana: Hey.

Yuka: Well, we were just in the kitchen making diner.

Kohta: Yeah. We've got enough for one more.

Nana: What? But I can't...



Nana: Bowl, please.

Kohta: Huh?

Yuka: Oh...

Nyu: Nyu.

Yuka: That poor girl must have been really hungry.

Kohta: You aren't kidding.

Nana: Another one, please.

Nana: Oh...

Yuka: Sorry. There isn't any more.

Mayu: You know, I don't know if Nana has anywhere to stay right now. Do you think it would be okay if she spends the night?

Kohta: Are you saying she's homeless?

Nana: There aren't many places people with horns can go.

Yuka: What should we do?

Kohta: I do have a lot of questions for her. Fine! Then why don't you stay with us for a while?

Nana: No!

Kohta: Huh?

Mayu: But Nana...

Nana: I'm not staying with people who [treat / treats] me like I [do / did] something wrong!

Kohta: What're you talking about? You're the one who attacked Nyu for absolutely no reason!

Nana: I have a reason!

Nyu: Nyu!

Nana: Huh?

Nyu: Hmm.

Nana: Is that for me?

Nyu: Nyu!

Kohta: But, Nyu...

Yuka: She heard Mayu say that Nana gets mad but she's hungry.

Kohta: That's nice, Nyu. But you have to eat too.

Nyu: Nyu?

Yuka: I've hardly touched my bowl. You can have it if you want it.

Kohta: What's wrong?

Nana: I'm very sorry.

Nyu: Nyu?

Nana: It was wrong with me to attack you like I did. I don't know what came over me. I'm very sorry.



Director Kakuzawa: You owe me quite a debt of gratitude. I [ ] any farther disobeying [ ].

Kakuzawa: Hey, you'll stay here after you graduate?

Kurama: Yeah, I think staying here is the best way to keep focused on my research.

Kakuzawa: Look, don't say anything to anybody else about this.

Kurama: Huh? Your father's research institute?

Kakuzawa: Yeah. They've been doing some classified research on a government project. Restricted and xxx and they are looking for people they can trust overly hush-hush.

Kurama: Classified research, huh? I don't want a job that I have to keep secret.

Kakuzawa: Your skill is invaluable to to us.

Kurama: I'm not your man, Kakuzawa. Sorry.

Kakuzawa: Come on, Kurama. Don't you wanna see the beginning of a new human race?



This is the police! We have you surrounded!

Don't move!

Poor girl...

It's all right, sweetie, don't be scared. Is the bad person still inside?

We're going in!

There's no one here!

What? There's no other way out of here.

Honey, where's the bad person now?

Ahhhhhh!!!

Shoot her!!

Four years ago in the Kanagawa prefecture, several girls were born with horn like temporal protrusions. It was thought to be rare disease, but the problem was never that simple.



Girl with horn: Please... Not again...

Kakuzawa: Do it.

270 joules cleared.
We'll do 300 joules next.

Girl: No more... No more... I'm scared!

Girl: I'm scared! I don't wanna do it any more! Please stop! Don't do it!

Kakuzawa: Yes, 270's the limit.

There hasn't been any change in the past month.

Kakuzawa: Her power should be growing as her body matures. But I suppose it's possible that the vectors differ as much as the individuals who possess them.

Kakuzawa: What's the matter, Kurama? You look like you're in [a] bad mood.

Kurama: I regret being taking in by your fast-talking flattery.

Kakuzawa: We're researching samples that are all but unknown outside of this research facility. Future generations [ will undoubtably ] benefit from what we learn here. Trust me, Kurama.

Kurama: Why are all these cases in the same area at the same time? That's what we should concentrate the investigation, rather than wasting our time on this inhumane torture.

Kakuzawa: Do you think our subjects are human?

Kurama: What's that?

Kakuzawa: Diclonius show their true colors when ther turn three. 'Cause that's when their vectors first appear. They [ ] with repeated murders. Our research shows that Diclonius will kill their own parents without hesitation. Yet consistently, they use their powers only against human victims. What does that mean? It means, Kurama, that the Diclonius are the enemy of mankind.

Kurama: Enough. I'm going home now.

Kakuzawa: Say hi to your wife for me, Mr.Newlywed.

Chief Kakuzawa...

Kakuzawa: What's the matter?

It's meal time for #3 but it looks like something's wrong.
There's no comunication from the room and looks like the security door's unlocked.

[ ]!

#3: Now it's my turn [ ] to you.

Kurama: Close the security hatch! [ ]

#3: [ ]. I finally get to meet you, the person behind the glass. I'm glad. I wanted to thank you. So thank you.

Kakuzawa: [ ]

Kurama: So are you saying she already had the power to stop the bullets?

Kakuzawa: [ ]

Kurama: What did she mean?

We still haven't found [ ] cause of the mutation. But the number of Diclonius' birth is growing. We can't admit them all. Even this facility has limits.

Kurama: Are you ordering us to terminate children born with this condition?

From now on, we'll report the mutant's death as sudden infant death syndrome by congenital chromosomal abnormality. The facility has a public license to make that kind of diagnosis.

Understood, sir.



Ohmori: Stay the hell out of there! What're you going to do to my baby?! [ ]

Kakuzawa: Ohmori, you know better. You [ ] when they're older.

Ohmori: Don't understand" She's my daughter!

Kakuzawa: Which only means that in three years youre the first person she'll kill. Forget about her. You had a bad luck. That's all.

Ohmori: Bad luck, Kurama? Is that all you have to say?

Kurama: When you consider the only eventual outcome, it's better to kill her before she grows. She'll only come to love you, which it makes much cooler.

Ohmori: This is insane. No father can make that kinda decision.

Kurama: I'll make the decision. I decided to do it myself. You'll only have me to blame.

Kakuzawa: It doesn't always have to be you, you know.

Kurama: I've already terminated over ten of them.

There's no reason anyone else should have that bad on their hands.

Kakuzawa: Well, if you feel the killing as your duty, I'm about to argue with you. But your wife is nine months pregnant, break will be healthy.
