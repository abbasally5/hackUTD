  Researcher: You're thinking why did they keep her locked in a tank? #35 has a full range of her vectors at a range of eleven meters.

Shirakawa: Um.

Researcher: If you ask me, she has a very good xxxxx of feeling Lucy. Then again, every instinct she has tells her to kill human beings. How do you plan to make a co-operate? After all, it's almost impossible to restrain her. or perhaps you feel you can appeal to her emotions.

Saitoh: Thanks for waiting.

Shirakawa: You must be...

Saitoh: Yes, I'm Saitoh but she calls me Mom.

Saitoh: There's nothing on xxxxxxxxx by doing it. But I doubt she'll be able to stand on her own. You do realize that we've kept her isolated in that chamber ever since she was born. Um, you're really going to let her out?

Shirakawa: That's right.

Researcher: As long as number 35's been here Saito has worked with her, but that doesn't mean...

Saitoh: I think she'll listen to me. We talk through these speakers every day. And the only voice she really knows. She calls me Mom. It's strange, isn't it? But every girl needs her mommy. I've never seen her face before. So, it feels like I'm meeting my long-lost daughter. I xxxxxx recognize me when she sees me.

Shirakawa: Get ready.

Saitoh: Sure.

Researcher: So you really think she can persuade number 35?

Shirakawa: Even if she is the strongest Diclonius, number 35 is still just a child. As far as she knows, Saitoh is her parent. for a only human contact.
number 35 won't do anything that might tear them apart.

Researcher: In theory, but is there any evidence to prove that she'll listen.

Shirakawa: If kindness doesn't work. I'm sure threat will.

Researcher: Threat....

Shirakawa: soon after she was born. number 35 went into surgery. A bomb was planted in her body.

Researcher: A bomb?! Why wasn't I told? isn't that a little drastic?

Shirakawa: Perhaps at that time xxx that's drastic, but there's no doubt it's useful now. If number 35 doesn't listen to Saitoh, we'll detonate the bomb and kill her. A bomb? does Cheif Kurama know?

Director Kakuzawa: Kurama agreed to it. He was her responsible father, after all. and he didn't want his daughter to hurt people. I used the bomb as a leash to make sure he never xxxx too far from his assigned duty. But, unfortunately, he disobeyed me and allowed the silpelit to escape. I've allowed it to happen. It gives her chance to rrecoup the money we spent on keeping her alive.

Saitoh: I'm releasing the partitions. Mariko, come on now, sweetie. Come out now.

Researcher: This is...

Saitoh: Good. Ohh.

Researcher: you think it's safe to let her get that close?

Shirakawa: He's been given the warning. He can set it off.

Saitoh: You poor thing, so thin... You know who I am?

Mariko: Moh, Mommy?

Saitoh: Um.

Mariko: uh.. No you are not.

Researcher: Uh...

Shirakawa: Detonate the bomb! Now!

Researcher: I knew this was gonna go wrong. Shirakawa! Get out of here!

Shirakawa: Move quickly. She's unable to use her vectors for she's in a state of pain. You've learned a lesson. If you don't listen to us, you are going to suffer, a lot more than you're suffering now.

Mariko: Ahhhhhhhhhh!

Nana:
Wow! This ice cream stuff is good! what do I do, Mayu? I can't stop eating!

Mayu: If you eat that like that, it's going to....

Nana: Ow, ow, ow, ow.....

Mayu: ...give you a headache. But it looks like you figure that out
huh?

Kohta: Nyu, what are you doing?!

Mayu: huh?

Kohta: No, you completely disassembled it.

Nyu: Nyu!

Kohta: Nana. Can I talk to you for a minute.

Mayu: Let's see... Where does this piece go. I don't know this is gonna xxx

Nana: ask me xxxxxxxxxx, I won't tell you anything.

Yuka: so what is your relationship with Nyu? could you tell us that?

Kohta: If you don't wanna talk to us, I'm not gonna pressure you. But listen. There's a price if you wanna stay here. Got it?

Yuka: Kohta?!

Nana: Well, that's how it is. I'm not hanging around this stupid place any more.

Kohta: That's completely fine with me, If you wanna do chores, who needs you. Everyone xxxxing here. Me, Yuka, and even Mayu. it's just the way it works.

Nana: So, it's okay if I stay here?

Kohta: Hm? Where else were you planing on going?

Nana: It's just...

Mayu: I think everything's back where it supposed to go.

Nyu: Nyu?

Mayu: huh?

Nyu: Nyu?

Mayu: Excuse me...

Nana: It's just I was scared. I didn't know what to do. If I was on my own again. I was scared. I've always been scared.

Mayu: Nana?

Yuka: Hey Mayu?

Mayu: What's wrong?

Yuka: There are a lot of simple things she doesn't know how to do, so maybe you could show her.

Mayu: Sure.

Kohta: Welcome.

Nana: Huh?

Mayu: Something's wrong?

Nana: Taking a bath means getting into hot water?

Mayu: Of course.

Nana: Wow! This feels so good! Ahaa! This is better than what I used to do. They would [do splash] me down with cold water out of a hose.

Mayu: A hose?

Nana: Aha. I'm sorry, Mayu. This doesn't change anything.

Mayu: But, don't you see Nyu's nothing like the girl you used to know.

Nana: But when she does become Lucy again, I don't really have a choice. You know? I hope lucy never stops being Nyu. I could live here for a long time, then I could know could be really happy.

Researcher: I heard that number 7 was spotted in Kamakura

Shirakawa: That's the rumor.

Researcher: number 35 can capture her?

Shirakawa: the bomb seemed to be very effective. right now, she's complying.

Researcher: So what happend to Chief Kurama? Where is he? I would expect him to oversee this mission.

Shirakawa: all projects relating to number 35 have been entrusted entirely to me.

Researcher: But why. Wait!

Shirakawa: I'm going to give my report to the chief. That is, if you have no objections. Chief? Excuse me, sir. Last night?

Lady A: Yes, he said it was an emergency conference. And he left immediately on a specially chartered flight. Um, did he tell you otherwise?

Guardman A: Ms. Shirakawa, the preparations for #35's conveyance has been completed. You can leave here already.

Shirakawa: Could the cheif be.. He's..

Arakawa: I'm exhauted. I wonder how many days it's been since I've taken a bath. Hm? There're at least 3,000 students, not including grad students, at the university! It's impossible to pick out a face that I've only seen one time. Anyway, would it hurt to let me take a shower? It's been a long time since I've changed my underwear and I think I'm about to get mad, you know? What? Fine, no hurry.

Bandoh: Shit!

Kurama: What happened to that hand?

Bandoh: You... None of you business!

Kurama: If the connection and the control components aren't damaged, simple exchanging of parts will solve the problem.

Bandoh: What?

Kurama: If you permit me, I can secure the parts without anyone's knowledge.

Bandoh: Yeah? What do you get out of all this.

Kurama: There's a diclonius coming that I want you to kill. Can you handle that?

Bandoh: What? Are you serious?

Kohta: She's in charge of Wanta's meals?

Nana: Yes, right now xxxxxxxxxx much I know how to do, but Mayu said she'd show me everything

Kohta: Well, that sounds good to me. All that we ask of you is that you do whatever you can around here.

Nana: So, who's that girl? Over there.

Kohta: What? Uh... My little sister. She passed away.

Mayu: She passed away?

Kohta: Before she passed away, I said something really mean to her. I don't remember it exactly, but I've always regretted. No matter how badly I wanna apologize, I think I've lost my chance. Kanae's gone.

Nyu: No, no no! Don't cry, Kohta!

Kohta: Huh?

Nyu: Please don't cry.

Kohta: But Nyu, I'm not crying.

Mayu: What's wrong?

Nana: Nothing. I just had that feeling for a second.

Kohta: Where are you going with those scissors. Nyu! I have no idea where she went.

Mayu: I'll go check up stairs.

Nana: I'm coming with you.

Mayu: Hey Nyu!

Kohta: Nyu! Nyu?

Nyu: I'm not Nyu! I'm Kanae. I forgive you. I forgive you! Koihta

Mayu: Nyu wants to be his little sister so she can forgive Kohta and make him feel better. Nana? What's the matter?

Nana: You were wrong, Mayu. She really isn't a nice person

Mayu: Hey, Let's leave them alone.

Nyu: Kohta, don't look sad. I'm sorry.

Kohta: Huh?

Nyu: I'm sorry.

Kohta: Huh. Oh yeah, When we first arrived here. I remember. You were still bothered about the shell.

Nyu: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry. I'm sorry... Nyu! Nyu.

Kohta: I don't know why, but I feel like that I've known you for a very long time.

Nyu: Kohta...

Kohta: Thank you Nyu, I care about you, too.


(around 16:00)
Kohta: Oh, no, you're doing it again? Well, I guess you can't break it any more than it already is. That's strange. Yuka's late.

Nana: I'm in charge of your meals from now on, so you eat a lot, okay?

Mayu: Ah...that's much more than he needs...

Nana: You call this creature a Wanta, is that right?

Mayu: Gotcha. This one's name is Wanta. But...

Nana: Hey, Mayu.

Mayu: What is it?

Nana: This is kinda nice, don't you think so?

Mayu: Yes.

Nana: !!!... Who's that...!!!?



#35: It's okay to kill the other one, right? The one who isn't Lucy?

Nana: ...!!!

Mayu: What's wrong?

Nana: She's come to kill me!

Mayu: What!?

Nana: She's like me...! A Diclonius that's very very vicious...
