Gensokyo: A world which exists quietly beside our own, separated by a mystical border. 
It is a utopia where humans and other beings such as fairies, demons, and gods live peacefully together.
Every summer, there is a large festival held at the shrine of Reimu Hakurei, the maiden who guards the border of Gensokyo,
It becomes filled with residents all over Gensokyo, indulging in the celebration.

This year, summer is approaching Gensokyo once again.

(Hakurei Shrine: Storehouse)

Suika:
I found it! I absolutely found the wind chime!

Suika:
Reimu?

Reimu:
Ah, Suika, could you grab that tub over there in the corner for me?

Suika:
Oh? Over here now?
Over there!

Reimu:
So much for getting a feast prepared for this year’s Summer Fest... Suika is the only person who showed up to help me.

Reimu:
Suika!?

Reimu:
This is going to be a very long day.

Reimu:
Come on, we're going now.

Reimu:
Hold on to that, okay?

Suika:
Sure!

Suika:
 Hey, Reimu…
 In this tub, it just doesn’t have any saké in it?
Saké! Saké! Saké!

Reimu:
You know what? You'll have more than enough to drink during the summer festival, okay? Just wait until then now.

Suika:
Hmpf!

Reimu:
Eh, I guess it can’t be helped. I’ll finish the preparations for the festival myself, so go do shopping for me, okay?

Reimu:
Take this.

Suika:
Oh!

Reimu:
Don't forget about all the change!

Suika:
Leave it to me!

Reimu:
Alright then…that should be about it for now.

Reimu:
And then...next come…

Reimu:
And then...

Reimu:
W-w-w-what!?

Reimu:
How can it...

Reimu:
M-m-my...

Reimu:
Where is my donation box!?

Reimu:
Gone... gone... gone...

Reimu:
I haven’t been able to find the box anywhere. Maybe it's been...

Aya:
Maybe the box has been stolen?

Reimu:
That’s right, it’s been stolen and...

Reimu:
What the..! A-Aya!?

Aya:
Ah.. good morning!

Reimu:
What are you doing here?

Aya:
But you know, if you stop and think about it, Reimu,

Aya:
do you honestly think that anyone in Gensokyo would wanna steal the Hakurei shrine’s donation box out of all things?

Reimu:
Eh, shut up about that!\NIt doesn't matter whether or not anything was inside! It's gone!

Aya:
Hard to believe it’s possible, but it seems like it did.

Aya:
But never fear! I shall personally help you find the culprit!

Reimu:
It's alright. I can handle this by myself.

Reimu:
You're just going to take more blackmail photos again, aren't you?

Aya:
Yeah, it’s my job! Do not question my skills as a journalist!

Aya:
You know my intelligence gathering abilities are of the best of Gensokyo! Am I right?

Aya:
Anyway, here's the latest scoop on...

Reimu:
Well then, where should I begin my search?

Aya:
wait a minute, Am I not worthy of helping you out…

Reimu:
Not listening, not listening ~

Aya:
Okay! I got it! I'll bring an assistant to help us speed up the search!

Reimu:
Huh?

Aya:
Please wait right here, Reimu.

Reimu:
W-wait? Aya? Hold on!

Aya:
it’s okay, I'll be back in 5 seconds!

Reimu:
What are you going to do...

Aya:
FU-JIN-SHO-JYO-!

Reimu:
Spell card!?

Reimu:
Wait!

Aya:
I have returned with some help.

Reimu:
That was pretty fast...

Reimu:
Marisa?

Reimu:
Are you all right?

Marisa:
You almost killed me by dragging me all the way out here and you asked…

Aya:
 Oh, as I just was saying, the donation box from Reimu’s shrine has been stolen.

Aya:
We haven’t been gone a search for it yet.
But I have a hunch the culprit may be someone we know.

Marisa:
Are you trying to imply that I stole the box set?

Aya:
Marisa, you should know that you aren’t suspected.
Besides, we were together all day yesterday, weren't we?

Marisa:
That's only because you told me you needed help printing out newspapers.

Reimu:
Hey! You two!

Reimu:
Don’t stay around talking all day, we’ll need (to) start searching for the box. Hurry up now.

Aya:
Yes! Marisa-san and I are more than happy to support you in your search!

Marisa:
Hey. Since when did I get counted in the stupid search for the donation box?

Marisa:
I already said I’m not going to help out at all, remember?

Aya:
You know, are you sure you should be saying that?

Marisa:
Huh?

Aya:
Marisa-san's scandalous private photos are gonna go public if she doesn’t help out!

Aya:
I wonder how Reimu is gonna react when she sees them.

Marisa:
Aya! How dare you blackmail me! You dirty little...huh?

Aya:
Is something the matter?

Marisa:
I felt like we were being watched just now.

Aya:
I didn't notice anything out there.

Marisa:
Yo. I think we should stay out of this after all. Something is wrong here.

Aya:
Probably just your imagination. Maybe you remember something that you forgot?

Reimu:
Come on, you two! Hurry up!

Marisa:
 No, that’s not sounded at all, but I just think…

Aya:
Yes! We are coming!

Suika:
Hey, Reimu! I'm back!

Suika:
I'm back from... huh?

Suika:
Reimu?



Forest of Magic: Scarlet Devil Mansion

Marisa:
Hey, Reimu, can I ask you something?

Reimu:
What is it?

Marisa:
Why are we at the Scarlet Devil Mansion looking for the donation box?

Reimu:
Aya told me that Patchouli has been acting suspiciously.

Marisa:
Patchouli? You mean that Patchouli?

Reimu:
Yes! I'm going to be furious if she's using it at a bookshelf or something. So lame!

Marisa:
How can a donation box become a bookshelf..?

Marisa:
Don't hold me responsible for whatever happens.

Marisa:
And, Aya, what are you doing over there?

Aya:
Just taking a snapshot.

Marisa:
I already see that...

Marisa:
Try to get it quick, okay?

Remi:
This morning, I wonder what that was all about.

Sakuya:
Tea, now?

Sakuya:
Ah...I'm terribly sorry but...

Remi:
The tea disappeared?

Sakuya:
Yes, as well as the wine and food supply last evening.

Remi:
Could thief have broken in and stolen it all?

Sakuya:
At first I thought about that as well, but...

Sakuya:
I didn't hear a single sound.

Sakuya:
And that much, at a single night.

Remi:
Ah...

Marisa:
Hey, is the box that important to you?

Reimu:
Marisa, you won't understand if I told you.

Marisa:
But there were hardly any donations!

Reimu:
What was inside doesn't matter.

Reimu:
It really means a lot to me.

Remi:
Reimu...and Marisa?

Remi:
What are they doing here?

Aya:
They are just running a few errands.

Remi:
Hem!?

Aya:
Oh, and also

Aya:
Here is today's Bunbunmaru News, Summer Extra Edition.

Marisa:
Yo! Aya?

Marisa:
Where did you go?

Aya:
Tell me your thoughts about it when you’ve done reading.

Aya:
See ya!

Remi:
My thoughts...huh?

Remi:
The Hakurei Shrine… Summer Festival Canceled?

Remi:
Scarlet Devil Mansion Basement: Voile Library

Pachi:
That's strange... it should be around here.

Pachi:
Not this one either.

Pachi:
Trespassers...

Reimu:
Patchouli, we're coming in!

Marisa:
We're already in...

Aya:
Wow!

Aya:
These are some really rare-looking books!

Aya:
I can see why Marisa comes here to borrow and never return them.

Marisa:
Hey, don't give people that wrong impression.

Reimu:
Hey Patchouli, I know you're around.

Reimu:
Where are you..?

Reimu:
Oh, there you are.

Reimu:
There's something I wanna to ask you.

Pachi:
Oh? But unfortunately I'm busy looking for something at the moment.

Pachi:
If you need someone to play with, there's Flandre.

Reimu:
I’ll pass. But if you can confess your crime honestly now, I'll reconsider playing with her.

Pachi:
Huh?

Reimu:
Give it back, now!

Pachi:
What's with your hands?

Reimu:
Give me back my donation box!

Pachi:
Huh? What are you...

Aya:
Marisa, this was really good read!

Marisa:
Whoa! What that heck?

Aya:
This one's nice, too!

Marisa:
Hey! Aya, stop it!

Pachi:
…talking about?

Pachi:
Mukyu!

Aya:
Ha? Did I hit something?

Reimu:
Hey, Patchouli, we're still in the middle of conversations, so get a hold of yourself.

Reimu:
Patchouli?

Pachi:
You messy idiots!

Remi:
"Reimu Hakurei, the self-professed 'Wonderful Shrine Maiden of Paradise,' said that

Remi:
tonight's feast will be canceled in order to search for the Hakurei Shrine's recently stolen offertory box."

Remi:
Could this be..?

Sakuya:
Lady Remilia, your drink is ready.

Remi:
Ah, Sakuya, the tea, you finally found it?

Sakuya:
Unfortunately no. This is a cup of ice choc instead.

Remi:
I hope you find it soon.

Sakuya:
Yes, I do, too.

Remi:
It's right. Patchy was saying some of her book are missing as well.

Remi:
Sakuya?

Remi:
Sakuya!

Sakuya:
Huh?...Uh...Please forgive me, I thought I heard some strange sounds coming from the library just now.

Remi:
Um...that's probably just Reimu and others doing something.

Sakuya:
That China...I mean, Meiling...she's not doing her work again.

Sakuya:
I'll go and take a quick look.

Remi:
Wait a minute, Sakuya.

Pachi:
Unleash! Powers of knowledge!

Pachi:
Spell card!

Pachi:
Sun Sign: "Royal Flare"!

Reimu:
Not bad at all!

Pachi:
Ah? Oh no! My magic wall has been broken?!

Reimu:
The powers that lie within Hakurei... release!

Reimu:
Spell Card - Spirit Sign: "Fantasy Seal"!

Reimu:
She got away.

Pachi:
What was that all about? My library is a complete mess now...

Sakuya:
Lady Patchouli, please keep quiet! It's me, Sakuya.

Pachi:
Sakuya?

Sakuya:
My apologies, I arrived too late.

Pachi:
How are you going to take responsibility for this?

Sakuya:
Please stay right here and be quiet for a moment.

Pachi:
What do you mean?

Sakuya:
That is…you'll see in a minute.

Reimu:
Patchouli, show yourself!

Reimu:
I know you're hiding back there!

Marisa:
Reimu! Calm down!

Aya:
This is starting to get really really interesting!

Remi:
I see you are making quite a ruckus here, Reimu.

Reimu:
Remilia!?

Remi:
So it is true that your donation box was stolen from the Shrine.

Reimu:
How did you find that out?

Remi:
Hmm? It seems like it's true, given your reaction.

Remi:
It appears that you are suspecting Patchy, but I highly doubt that she did it.

Remi:
Patchy has been looking for her missing books all this time.

Remi:
And also, she hasn't been outside of Scarlet Devil Mansion at all recently.

Reimu:
But then, who else could have done this?

Remi:
When exactly did your donation box disappear?

Reimu:
I think... some time last night. Why do you ask?

Remi:
Patchy's books disappeared last night as well.

Remi:
That's not all, all of Sakuya's tea and food supplies also disappeared last night.

Reimu:
Same day... same time...

Remi:
Reimu, I think you'd realized by now what just happened.

Marisa:
Reimu, does this mean?

Reimu:
Yes, I see now.

Reimu:
This is...

Reimu:
yet another{\i1}incident!{\i0}

Marisa:
Huh? This is gonna continue?

Reimu:
That’s weird. Didn't they say it would?

Sakuya:
Well, at this rate, it will...
