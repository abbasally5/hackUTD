Rin :
I won't let his death be for nothing.
Berserker took out Archer, and I'm going to take out Berserker.

[battle sequence]

Rin :
Neun, Acht, Sieben! 
(Nine, Eight, Seven!)

Stil, Schießt Beschießen, Erschießung!
(Style, Shoot Shelling, Execution! / Shoot!, Shoot him!, Shoot him dead!)

Illya :
Berserker, turn her into mush!


---------- Opening Theme ----------


[battle sequence]

Shirou :
Saber!

Illya :
Come on Berserker, hurry up and finish her!

[battle sequence]

Shirou :
Saber!
Dammit, I've had another this!
Let her go!


Saber :
Shirou, don’t!
Shirou ... Don't be foolish, you've done enough!
Stand back, Master.

Shirou :
I said, let her go!
Saber, no!
Dammit, I told you to stop!

Saber :
Why did you do that?
Listen, I have to do this, it’s our only option!

Shirou :
She is already so much weaker just from summoning her sword. 
There is no way she can use that, not in the shape she is in. 
Hold on ... 

> [Archer] If you face an opponent that you cannot defeat, then visualize something that allow you to defeat it. 

I’ll create one for you. 

> [Archer] This is the only skill you have, so I suggest you to perfect it. 
I'll get you your weapon, Saber, ... Just wait ... 

Saber :
That sword was mine, but how did he? ...


[Shirou charges ahead, and cuts Berserker’s left arm off]

One more try. If a sword that is supposed to be unbreakable just broke on me, my visualization had to be flawed. OK, Initiate, ... Projection, ... The only enemy I have to face is myself, ... I can’t allow a single irregularity or compromise ...

Saber :
Shirou!

Shirou :
Basic structure ... Visualized!, ... Component materials ... Identical!, ... Accumulated age ... Replicated!, ... Craftsmanship ... Exceeded!, ... 
Bind these thoughts together ...
And form a sword!, ... !!!

[Shirou vs. Berserker]

Saber :
Shirou!

Illya:
Huh! What are you thinking? You are no match for Berserker. 

Shirou :
If I can create a sword that is more powerful than Berserker, then I have to be able to use it ... 

Saber :
Give me your hands. 

[Shirou and Saber vs. Berserker ... 
The sword pierces through Berserker’s body]

Illya :
Ah! ...

Berserker :
So, Saber, that is your sword?

Saber :
Yes, this is Caliburn ... The sword in the stone that chooses the kings ... Lost for all eternity. 

Berserker :
But it’s nothing more than an illusion created by that man standing next to you. A legendary sword that’ll never exist again. I’m impressed. Even the illusion is formidable. I never would have thought a single blow from that blade could defeat me seven times. 

Saber :
Shirou. 

Shirou :
I’m OK. 

Illya :
How ... How can Berserker possibly be dead? ... 

Shirou :
Hold on, Saber! 
Illya is not a threat to us anymore, OK? 
With Berserker gone, she won’t be a problem. 

[shift of scenery]

Saber :
I see that you are awake, Shirou.

Shirou :
Yeah.

Saber :
How are you feeling today, are you well?

Shirou :
What’s wrong, Saber?
What’s that long look on your face all about?

Saber :
Nothing. 
I just had somewhat a troubling dream, that’s all.

Shirou :
About what?

Illya :
Keep it down, will you?

Shirou :
ACK!

Saber :
Are these enough dishes?

Shirou :
Yep, that should be perfect.

Rin :
Hey! ... 
Sorry, but I’m gonna have to help myself to some milk.

Shirou :
Good morning. 

Rin :
My head hurts for some reason. Wow, you're really cooking a big breakfast this morning, aren't you?

Shirou :
Yep, Japanese beef patties. 

Saber :
You seem somewhat relaxed today, Rin. 

Rin :
Well yeah, now that Berserker is dead, we can all relax a little bit more. And now that you can replenish your own mana Saber, you can easily take down the rest of the Servants alone. 

Saber :
In a time of war, nothing is ever certain. 

Rin :
You are just being modest. The only servants left are just your average garden variety epic heroes, that shouldn't be a problem for the likes of King Arthur, right? 

Shirou :
Tohsaka, you know what Saber’s real identity is? When did you figure it out?

Rin :
Well, I had my suspicions, but I wasn't sure until yesterday. After all, there is only one hero who can wield a sword of that caliber. 

---------- eye catch ----------

Rin :
So Shirou, just what do you plan to do now?

Shirou :
What do you mean? Do about what?

Rin :
I am referring to that dangerous little girl sleeping under your roof. 

Saber :
She is not just sleeping under Shirou’s roof, she is sleeping in his bed. 

Rin :
Ah!? Hmm ...

Shirou :
Hey, it wasn't my idea, it’s just where she ... 

Saber :
I agree with Rin, Shirou. Taking Illyasviel into your house is insane. There is no way you can trust her. 

Shirou :
Well, I couldn't just abandon her out there. I mean she is just a kid. 

Rin :
How can you say that? After all that little brat put us though? 

Shirou :
She won't try anything like that again. She just doesn't know how to behave properly. And besides, I said from the beginning, I have no intention of killing other Masters. I’m only in this thing to put an end to this stupid wars. 

Rin :
So you are saying that you are just going to forgive Illya for everything that she’s done? 

Shirou :
It’s just that ...

Rin :
Well, I won't exonerate her for what she did to Archer.

Illya :
Why are you so mad? When this is over, all the Servants are just gonna disappear anyway. If a little thing like that bothers you, then you are not get out to be a Master, Rin.

Rin :
Watch your mouth, Illya!

Illya :
I would like to say thank you to Saber’s Master. I'm deeply touched by the kindness you have shown me, a former enemy. ... Just kidding. The smell is so good! You actually set a place for me. You are the best! 

Saber :
Take your hands off him, you insolent child! 

Illya : 
You really talk like that at a table? Wow, what a bad manners you must have! 

Saber :
Shirou, I simply cannot condone this. Taking her in would do more harm than good. 

Shirou :
But she is just a kid, how dangerous can she be? It’s not like she is a Master anymore. 

Rin :
You're wrong Shirou, that’s not true. She is still a Master. Have you forgotten what I told you? As long as you have your command seal, then you are still a Master. 

Rin :
And the same goes for Servants too. If they've lost their Master, they still have a window of time before they disappear. If she wanted, she could easily form a pact with a stray Servant. 

Illya :
But I won’t. I’m not gonna team up with any other Servant. Berserker will always be the only servant for me. ... But, if you happen to lose Shirou, I'll be happy to take Saber off your hands.


Saber :
Not a chance. I have no intention of ever becoming your Servant. 

Illya :
Huh? You know it really doesn't bother me if you feel that way. Regardless of whether I win or you just protect Shirou, the end result will be the same. 

Shirou and Saber :
Huh??

Rin :
?!

Saber :
Well, it still bothers me. 
Rin, please make Shirou understand. 

Rin :
I'm sorry, could you repeat that?
I wasn't paying attention. 

Saber :
I was saying that I'm opposed to offering Illyasviel sanctuary. 

Rin :
I don't see what a problem is. 

Saber :
Ah!

Shirou :
Two minutes ago, you were just saying ... 

Illya :
That's great news, this is gonna be so much fun! 

Saber :
This is completely ridiculous, Shirou! 

Shirou :
I got it Illya, you are happy. Now, go eat your breakfast. 

Rin :
It’s possible that Shirou may have just unwittingly made a brilliant decision. 

[sword practice]

Illya : 
Hmm... Is this really how you go about training?
It seems to me Saber is either going easy on you or just not in the mood to fight. Either way, she is holding back. 

Saber :
I never hold back in a fight! 

Shirou :
Now that she mentions it, you do seem more passive than you usually do. Come on Saber, if you don’t come at me head on, I’m never gonna get any better. And we all know I need to get better. 

Saber :
Do you really want me to come at you head on? I-If I do that, it means in a course of the fight, we could have our bodies colliding each other. 

Shirou :
Yes, so what? That’ sparing, comes with the territory. 

Saber :
It’s time for lunch, now. 

Illya :
This is delicious, you are a very good cook, Shirou. 

Saber :
Hold on a minute. 

Illya :
What for?

Shirou :
Saber ... 

Illya :
What was that about? Not too long ago I had a impression you hated me. 

Saber :
Rather than hold a grudge against you, Shirou was kind enough to welcome you into his home. It was big of Shirou to do that, and I suppose I could show you some basic courtesies as well. 

Shirou :
Man, I really worked up a sweat back there. 
ACK! 
Oh, crap, I did it again! 
I’m sorry, I didn't think you be in here. 

Saber :
No, I'm sorry. But if you don't mind, could you please just give me a few more minutes? I should’ve foreseen you would want bathe after that workout. I would never go that far and restricting my Master’s interest. I'm so sorry. You shouldn't see me like this. I’m not like Rin. Her body is far more attractive than mine. 

Shirou :
What are you talking about? 

Saber :
I don't want you to see my body, Shirou. I can't imagine any man wanting to see these overdeveloped muscles, and must be revolting. 

Shirou :
What are you kidding that ... ?
So, ah ... anyway, I'll let you finish ...

Rin :
Well, nothing seems to be broken. I still can't believe you did it, that was a powerful projection spell you conjured up. 

Shirou :
Projection?

Rin :
That’s right. It’s the spell you use when you want to re-create something, in your case a sword. You imagine and duplicate it using your own mana, but we all know that human imagination can be incredibly inaccurate. You could never reproduce it exactly. So, it’s really just a half-ass form of sorcery. 

Shirou :
Yeah, it did disappear pretty quickly. 

Rin :
Plus, projection burns up a lot of mana. If you were to truly imagine Saber’s sword, the mana it required would be undue capacity. Envisioning that would be tantamount to suicide, Shirou. By the way, just how much of the history of Excalibur do you actually know? 

Shirou :
Excalibur? Well, it’s pretty much synonymous with King Arthur, right? It was a sword that could cut through anything and never break no matter what. 

Rin :
I knew it. That’s what you were imagining, wasn't it? Look Shirou, you have to know your history on this one. It’s not the sword that’s important but scabbard. 

Shirou :
Really?

Rin :
Really. The legend goes that as long as King Arthur has the Scabbard in his possession, he would never bleed, in other word, he was invincible. 

Shirou :
Well, if that’s true, just how did King Arthur die then? 

Rin :
That’s a good point. According to the legends, the Excalibur’s Scabbard was stolen. 

Shirou :
What’s going on? Why you get now worked up about this?

Rin :
Mind your own business! If this is true, it means Saber is invincible, and I was wrong about her mana 
levels. I do make mistakes sometimes.

Shirou :
Just sometimes?

Rin :
Humph!

Shirou :
Huh, I was joking ... 
I know Tohsaka said I shouldn't do this, but ...
Initiate! ... Projection! ...

Saber :
So, this is where you were ...

Shirou :
Yeah, I couldn't get a sleep. So I thought I work my brain a bit. 

Saber :
Is this an everyday routine for you?

Shirou :
Well, I try to it at least. It’s sort of a daily thing my dad drilled into me. By the way Saber, you mention a dream you had this morning. 

Saber :
Servants don't have dreams. What I saw was your dream. One of your memories something from your past. The ties between Masters and Servants are connected down to the spiritual level. As that bond begins to strengthen, you can often catch glimpses of the other’s past. Please forgive me. 

Shirou :
Don't worry about it. It’s not like you meant to. So tell me just what was the dream about. 

Saber :
It was about an enormous fire. You and I are lot like Shirou, that’s why your mistake is obvious to me. I know what will become of you if you continue down this path. And it’s because we are alike that I know this. 

Shirou :
How am I making a mistake? I wanna do what my dad did in champion justice.

Saber :
Exactly, and that what I'm saying as your mistake. Rin has expressed this to you before that you have an unhealthy tendency towards self-sacrifice. Unfortunately, you are always ready to put yourself in harm’s way without the first fact to bring in the value of your own life. It’s still imperative that I attain a Holy Grail at all costs, however Shirou needs it as just as much I do. It was inevitable that I should be summoned by you, Master. 

Kuzuki :
Looks like the battles are entering the middle stages. 

Caster :
Actually, No! Now that Berserker is gone, we no longer have anything to worry about. The only enemies we have left are Lancer and Saber. Our stockpiles of mana will soon be full as well. All we need now is a Magus to act as a receptacle. With that we will be able to summon the Holy Grail by force. 

Kuzuki :
If it’s a Magus you need, I’m afraid I won't be of any use. 

Caster :
Not to worry. When it comes to a human sacrifice, one of the other Masters will suffice just fine. Of course, since this object will become the vessel for the Grail, it must also be a Magus with enormously in potential to be worthy of this endeavor. In terms of ability, this young lady is ideal, but perhaps a bit too tomboyish on the end. All that is required is that they come from a Magus blood line. As long as they make a superior element, whether they can use magic or not is completely irrelevant. I believe you fit the bill nicely, young lady.
