Girl:
What is it you're so afraid of?
Why don't you take a chance sometime?



Lain:
No, that's not it.
I don't have mail.
I don't get it.

Mika:
Oh, you're alone.
I thought somebody was in here.

Lain:
Someone else? Who?

Mika:
Lain, you know who I'm talking about.
Your little imaginary friend.
Or something like that.
You're gonna be late again!



Alice:
Lain!
Hi Lain. Good morning.

Lain:
Oh... good morning, Alice.

Reika:
I'm right.
See what I mean?
It couldn't have been her.

Julie:
You really think so?
I don't know.

Lain:
What is it?

Alice:
Oh, cut it out!
Don't tease her like that.
It's nothing. Come on, let's just go.

Lain:
Mmm...

Julie:
But Alice, she really...

Alice:
Come on!

Julie:
Well?

Lain:
So Julie, are you still getting... e-mail?

Juri:
E-mail?

Lain:
You know... from Chisa...?

Julie:
Oh, that. No, I haven't. Not any more.

Alice:
Oh Lain, you mean to say you got that prank e-mail too?

Julie:
What?

Reika:
Why'd you ask?

Lain:
Oh, never mind. I was just curious.

Julie:
About what?

Reika:
You know what?
She does look like her.

Julie:
Huh?

Reika:
So Lain, what were you doing last night anyway?

Lain:
Huh?

Julie:
See? I told you.

Alice:
C'mon, it wasn't her.

Reika:
You're right.
She looks nothing like her.

Julie:
Well...

Lain:
Tell me. What?

Reika:
We were partying, Lain, out at Cyberia last night, where we saw a girl who looked exactly like you.

Lain:
You say Cyberia?

Julie:
We were scared at first, but then we all finally got up the courage to go there last night.

Reika:
Oh c'mon, it wasn't such a big deal.

Alice:
Oh, right. You were scared. (Giggles.)
It's a new club that plays really great hardcore techno for really hip young crowd.
And you know, there was a girl we saw there who looked a little bit like you, Lain.

Lain:
But last night, I was...

Alice:
I believe you, Lain.
There's no way it was you.
I admit though, I didn't get a close look at her, but she was wearing these really wild clothes,
and was copping attitude and chewing people out all night long, right?

Reika:
Yeah, it was like she was like the total opposite of your personality.

Julie:
But I saw her. Lain does look like her.
Say, I've got an idea.
Next time you come with us!

Reika:
Hahaha... and then we can really make sure.

Arisu:
Cut it out! You're just making fun of her!

Julie:
You know, maybe when a girl like Lain goes to a club, her personality does a complete 180!

Alice:
Or maybe, she would just have a good time for once in a life.

Julie:
What do you say, Lain? Are you afraid or what?

Reika:
Might even find someone really nice.

Arisu:
I bet there's a really fun girl inside that shell you're wrapped up in, just dying to get out!
Right, Lain?



Announcer:
A new type of smart drug on the street called Accela uses nano-mechanisms, and oscillate at a specific frequency within the body.
This triggers the secretion of a synthetic hormone.
It is said that when secreted, this hormone completely alters the response time of the human brain, making it seem as if one's awareness is accelerated.
Not only its awareness, but the workings of the brain itself are altered,
multiplying the speed at which the brain calculates by a factor of 12.
This nano-mechanism itself is destroyed by digestive juices within 24 hours,
but it is unknown how long its effectiveness lives on in the brain.

Deliveryman:
Huh? Hey, is this your place, kid?
Aww, finally. I, ah, have a delivery for you.
I'll unload it. Could you get the gate for me?
There. Could you sign this, please?
This Navi is so cool.
Fast, simple to use, I wish... oh.
So, all of this here is for you?

Lain:
I'm not sure.

Deliveryman:
Huh? Then you don't even know what all of these things are?
It's a top-of-the-line Navi! Fully loaded, too!
A computer with this kind of horsepower could handle any kind of software without ever crashing, even in the Wired!
Me, I only use a home-brewed system myself--it doesn't hold a candle to this!

Lain:
It doesn't matter.
You see, I don't know hardly anything about it.

Deliveryman:
(Chuckles.) You will, soon enough.
Well, so long.



Yasuo:
Your Navi came today.
Isn't that right, Lain?

Miho:
Get that mess cleaned up soon, all right?
It's in the way.

Yasuo:
What do you say we get the whole thing set up for you right after dinner, okay?
To be honest, I'm interested to see how this thing operates myself.

Lain:
Dad...

Yasuo:
What?

Lain:
Could you... maybe... set it up for me right now?

Yasuo:
Now? Mind telling me what's the big hurry, right now?
Lain... okay.



Yasuo:
A child's Navi, like the one you have, Lain, can't be used forever.
Communication is essential--the information highway is the key.
You have to keep up with the times.
For that, you need a state-of-the-art, high-end machine.
Understand, Lain?

Navi:
Copland OS Enterprise.

Yasuo:
Come here.
Register yourself as the machine's user.
Try talking to it.

Lain:
Hello, Navi.

Yasuo:
With that done, this Navi's officially yours.
You can show off to your friends now.
Oops. What is it, Mika?
Something wrong?

Lain:
Navi, do I have mail?

Navi:
Lain has no mail.



Reika:
Yeah, turn left at that corner.
Keep going straight.
See it?

Lain:
Uh-huh.

Reika:
We're in the basement. Got it?



Taro:
Hey! Hey you!

Myu-Myu:
You're blocking the stairs!

Lain:
I'm so sorry.

Taro:
If you do it that way, you're gonna get spotted by Information Control right off the bat!

Masayuki:
Don't you think it's okay if you're under attack?

Myu-Myu:
Hey, let's go over to the game center.



Alice:
Jeez, what took you so long, Lain?

Reika:
Aren't you usually in bed by now, Lain?

Julie:
Oh Lain, don't you have any other clothes you can wear?
This is a party, you know.

Alice:
I'll help you find something nice for next time, okay, Lain?

Reika:
Aww, you think we'd recognize her dressed up?

Alice:
Reika!

Julie:
Hey, Alice.

Alice:
What?

Julie:
I guess the girl that we saw the other night wasn't really Lain after all.

Reika:
That's what I've been trying to tell you, Julie.
Lain isn't anything like her at all.
The girl we saw in here, she had attitude, she wouldn't put up with anything.

Lain:
And that person... really looked that much like me?

Juri:
Yeah, it's true.
I thought it was really you.

Lain:
Oh...

Man:
He's got a gun!

Man:
Let's get out of here!

Alice and Reika:
Julie!

Alice:
Lain, come on!

Reika:
What's she doing just standing there?

Alice:
Reika, take care of Julie.

Reika:
Alice? Alice!

Man:
What're you looking at!?

Alice:
Lain, hurry!
Wake up, Lain! Come on!
Lain! Lain, please.

Man:
Just get out of here!
Huh?
Why? Why? Why are you making me do this?
What right do you have?
I just wanted to clear my head, I...my head...
You don't understand.
You just don't understand it.
I don't know anything about this!
I don't know anything but...
That's your god, it's not my god.
It...it's...got nothing to do with me...
Just...just leave me out of it...just...just leave me out of it.
Just...leave me out of it!
The Wired can never interfere with the real world.
Just leave me out of it, will you!
Who the hell are you?

Alice:
L... Lain?

Man:
Leave me out of it...
Leave me out of it...
Leave me out of it...
Leave me out of it...

Lain:
No matter where you are, everyone is always connected.
