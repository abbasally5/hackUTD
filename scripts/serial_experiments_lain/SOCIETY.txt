Girl:
Just between you and me, let me tell you what's happening.
What's beginning to take place in our society without you ever being even vaguely conscious of it.



Lain:
Not that.
No, that is wrong.
I'm just watching because when I get inside of the Wired...
That's right.
It's becoming less and less like me it seems.
I don't honestly know.
What? Who do you mean?

Mika:
A...A...Mo...

Lain:
Hm? What, Mika?
I can't figure out Mika lately.
She hasn't been herself.
Well?
I'm not sure I can answer that.
Right.
Fine, suit yourself.



Man:
I know what you mean.
The real world and the Wired are liner in their connections.
I can exist anywhere that I desire.
No matter where my body is in any particular time,
I can release my consciousness anywhere I want, anytime I want.



Woman:
I just thought you would like to know that it is now time for the E-Motor Consortium banquet.

Man:
Right.

Navi:
Mail.

Man:
Please tell them I'll be down in 3 minutes.

Woman:
I'll let them know.

Man:
Hmm...
So, what game do you want to play this time, huh?



Man:
Hahaha... Try this.
Hahaha... Just try me, you morons.
Hahaha... I'm better than all you bozos.
Hahaha...



Lain:
The real world out there isn't actually real at all.

Arisu:
Lain? Are you okay?

Lain:
Huh? Why do you ask?

Arisu:
Lately it seems... you've been slipping away again.
I guess we... we wanted to make an effort to include you into everything we do.
We wanted to take you out and make you happy somehow.
That's all we were trying to do.
Of course if we've been a nuisance and you'd rather we didn't call you, I apologize.

Lain:
That's... No.
That's not it.
I... I was having fun.
I've had a really great time.

Arisu:
That's good to hear.

Lain:
Arisu, wait!

Arisu:
Yeah?

Lain:
Um... Thank you.
Thank you so much for thinking about me.

Arisu:
That's what friends are for, right?
See ya!



Announcer:
This afternoon, the firewall of the Information Bureau's Information Control Center was cracked by some unnamed renegade party.
As a result, the information network system of the Wired is in total disarray.
And furthermore, being advised that although it is actually a live broadcast and is being sent out this very moment.
It is quite possible that it may arrive tomorrow, right now, or perhaps yesterday.



Man's voice:
It looks like the Knights did it again.

Man's voice:
"Knights"? Who's that?

Woman's voice:
"Knights."
A mysterious group of mathematical knights, said to have great influence in the Wired.
Members of this group are unknown at this time.
They are not only involved in information manipulation.
They've also been linked to the development and distribution of illegal information devices.

Man's voice:
I hear that somebody's after Lain.

Man's voice:
Lain? Who's that?

Woman's voice:
"Lain."
Search has no matches and no documentation on record.

Man's voice:
I haven't seen Lain around lately.

Man's voice:
Who the hell is Lain?

Man's voice:
She's a young girl.

Man's voice:
A young girl?

Man's voice:
She's very powerful.

Man's voice:
How do you mean?

Man's voice:
Her metaphorize.
Her will.
Her power.
The light in her eyes.
Her existence.

Man's voice:
Hey, can I ask you something?

Man's voice:
What is it?

Man's voice:
I was just wondering.
You wouldn't happen to be a Knights member, would you?



Wife:
Coming.

Delivery man:
I have a package for you.

Wife:
Ah... let me get my stamp.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to keep you waiting so long.

Delivery man:
Ah, it's okay.

Wife:
Here is my stamp.
Oh, what is it?

Delivery man:
Oh, a Navi, ma'am.
A new model probably.
I wish I had one.

Wife:
I could buy it.
My home job makes me extra money.

Delivery man:
Oh, even working at a job like this one, I'd never be able to afford one of these.
Here.

Wife:
Well, keep working at it.

Delivery man:
Haha... I sure will.
If I don't work at it, I'll never get it.
If you have any trouble with anything, let me know.
I can always teach you.

Wife:
Huh? Hm...
You think you can teach me?

Delivery man:
Sure. I'm pretty talent in.

Wife:
Ahaha...
Sounds to me like you're trying to seduce a bored housewife, is that it?

Delivery man:
Well... No, I thought.
Well, maybe just a little.

Boy:
Hiya, Mom.

Wife:
Well, thank you very much anyway.

Delivery man:
Hm... now shoot!

Boy:
Hey, Mom?
Can I go over to Kinya's to play later?
I won't be at late.

Wife:
If you're going to play a game, can't you just play it over the Net?

Boy:
But Mom, I have to be there.
He's gonna teach me how to play it.

Wife:
The Wired is really the same thing as the real world.



Lain:
What... do you want?

Men In Black-2:
Good day, Lain Iwakura.
Would you please walk this way and step into the car?

Lain:
Huh?

Men In Black-1:
We promise not to force you in.
This is simply a request.

Men In Black-2:
We have no intention of causing you any physical harm.
You can trust us.
You have my word on it.

Lain:
Who are you?

Men In Black-1:
If you promise to come along with us quietly, you'll find out.


[B-Part]


Man:
I don't wanna be here.
You understand all the reasons, don't you?
Just look at all I can do.
It's unbelievable how far I'm traveling into it.
Look at all of this.
I'm finally breaking down the barrier between the real world and the world inside the Wired.

Come on, I've become really qualified.
You just have to give me the chance.
I can handle anything you can throw to me.
Let me into the Knights.
You're pretty impressed, huh?
I tracked you down all by myself without any assistance.
This is your dedicated secret channel, isn't that right?
Come on, won't you make me one of you?
Ah... Who are you?



Man:
Could you come here for a minute?
I can't get the main office's firewall system to recognize this machine.
I've done everything I can on the application end of things.

It's hopeless with an old machine like this one I've got here.
But I've gotten so used to using this thing.
I just can't work up the interest to switch to a new Navi, I guess.
No, not at my age.

But I tell you, if I were as young as you...

Lain:
That jumper over there.

Man:
Huh?

Lain:
Try removing this jumper and that jumper over there.

Man:
I'm sorry, but could you possibly do it for me, please?

Lain:
Huh?

Navi:
Authorized.

Man:
Well.

Man's voice:
So Lain, are you of the Knights?

Lain:
Huh?

Man's voice:
You are, aren't you, Lain?
I had no idea.

Lain:
You moron!

Man's voice:
Ah, wait!
Please listen to me.
That game, the one you've been playing with the kids lately is the greatest!
You've gotta give me an unction.
You are the only one I can turn to.
Just give me a break.
Just this one time, Lain?
But I have a better idea.
Please make me one of you.
Make me a Knight, I beg you.
Please make me one of you!
Please!
I'll do anything you ask me.
Just get me in. Please...

Man:
Some say the Wired doesn't have political borders like the real world.
But with this freedom, there is a price to pay.
I'm talking about nonsense-spouting anarchists and idiots who think a lot of pranks are up to a revolution.
The Knights are quite different.
They don't seem to be anarchists or idiots at all.

Lain:
The Knights...

Man:
I'm not sure if you are totally aware of the power that you have inside of you, Lain.
You should know your presence in the Wired is extremely unnatural and disturbing phenomenon.
The Knights are interested in you.
For what reason, we haven't figured out yet.
But they're out there watching.

Lain:
I... I am... I don't understand... don't understand what you're saying...

Man:
The Knights.
I understand Lain that, you've spoken directly to them at one point.

Lain:
But... But I don't... don't ever remember...

Man:
At any rate, from the looks of it, it appears that they want to accomplish something by using you.
And we believe Lain that that is something that must be prevented, no matter what the cost maybe.

Lain:
Who... are you?
What... are you people...?



Man:
Your secret's safe with me, you bet.
It's true you believe in Deus [xxx] stands for, is that right?
I'll follow you lead them.
But wait.
Is it really true?
Is God really in the Wired who said the rumor?
I'm not quite ready to believe all that yet.
But, if you let me join you, I'll certainly be able to learn more, don't you think?
Then I'll be able to believe anything you want me to believe.
I'll believe you.
Wh...What?
Is that really you?
You came for me, right?
You came to pick me up.



Man:
My name...
It's totally meaningless to know my real name.
These gentlemen and I don't actually have names that would mean anything to you.
Now, I have to know something.
Tell me, Lain Iwakura.
Are you and the Lain in the Wired in reality one and the same person?
Who are you, Lain?

Lain:
I'm... I'm...

Man:
Do you know if your parents are truly your real parents?

Lain:
Huh?

Man:
Is your sister your real sister?

Lain:
What... What are you asking me?
Of course, certainly.

Man:
How about your father's birthday?
Can you tell me when that is?

Lain:
Well... well, sure...
Dad's birthday...

Man:
And how about your mother's birthday?
Do you know when that is?
Do you have any idea when your parents were married?
Did they meet, or was it arranged?

Lain:
Th... That's something I really don't know...
I... That's because I... I...

Man:
How could you not know?
You never even ask, did you?
You've never celebrated a birthday in your family that you can remember.
How about when you were a little girl?
Not even then?
When and where were you born, Lain?

Lain:
What... What does it matter...?

Man:
You don't know.
You don't know any of them.
Are you okay?
Are you certain that you have nothing to tell me?

Lain:
Why don't you shut up?
Who the hell cares about any of that old crap anyway?
Don't waste my time!

Man:
I see.
You're Lain of the Wired, aren't you?

Lain:
What if I am?

Man:
Even without a device, you must be aware that barring some unforeseen miracle.
The border between the real world and the world of the Wired is starting to crumble.

Lain:
Yeah, so what?

Man:
We are also of the opinion that this is extremely dangerous.

Lain:
Sounds very interesting.
Huh?
Move it.
What's the big idea?

Men In Black-1:
You are the one.
You are what's dangerous.

Man:
Karl! Wait.
Hmm...
It's exactly as she said.
Something interesting is about to unfold.
We should just watch from the sidelines.



Woman:
Hey, Shou!

Boy:
Yeah, Mom?
What's up?

Woman:
Let me play too, will you?

Boy:
Are you done with work already?

Woman:
You bet!
You know, I'm just the greatest there is.
I'm gonna take you down, Shou!
Just you wait and see.
See?
I told you.
You better say your prayers!
Oh, watch this!
