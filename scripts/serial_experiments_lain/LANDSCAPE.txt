Girl:
Oh, okay. So that's how it works.
I had no idea the world was this simple to figure out.
I was overthinking things all along.
I always thought the world was such a big scary place to live in, with no place to hide.
But no.
Once you figure it out, it's all so easy.

Girl:
See? I told you it would be.



Juri:
Hahaha...
Oh Lain, that's terrible!

Reika:
I can't believe you just said that.

Arisu:
Lain...

Lain:
I know it, but it's really true.

Juri:
That's the first I've heard of it.

Arisu:
What does it mean?

Reika:
Acting all high and mighty again, is that it, Lain?

Reika:
That reminds me.

Juri:
What is it, Reika?

Arisu:
But, that's a...
Ah...
But, that's a...

Reika:
Unbelievable...

Juri:
Aw, c'mon...!



Lain:
People only have substance within the memories of other people.
And that's why there were all kinds of me's.
There weren't a lot of me's per se.
I was just inside all sorts of people, that's all.



Taro:
Oh, I see.
Now I get it.

Myu-Myu:
Come on, Taro, tell us.
Who's that you've been talking to?

Taro:
Hahaha...

Masayuki:
What's up, man?

Taro:
Well, you know...
So happens, I kissed an angel.

Myu-Myu:
Taro...



Voice:
Lain...
Lain...
Lain...



Announcer:
Protocol Seven is expected to allow the seamless sharing of information.
Information that will be shared between the Wired and the real world.
And now, the following message.
Let's all love Lain.
Let's all love Lain!
Let's all love Lain!
Let's all love Lain!
Let's all love Lain! Lain! Lain! Lain! Lain!...



Masami:
As a general rule, all of the functions of the human body, without exception,
can be put into simple words and described in terms that are purely materialistic.
A body is nothing but a machine.
If the physical limitations of a human body restrict mankind's ability to evolve,
it would be as if the fall of the species called "man" had already been decided by a God that doesn't even exist.
The information etched inside humans isn't only that which they themselves acquired as individuals.
The species called man is connected to his predecessors and information has accumulated within him.
Therefore, if that information isn't shared, it's meaningless.
It amounts to nothing more than data.
Mankind can evolve. Evolve by its own power.
But to do that, it must first discover and understand what it truly is.
What do you think you are?
Originally, people were connected to each other.
All I've done is to return things to the way they once were.
That's in essence what you have done, Lain, haven't you?
You can do anything you want to.



Men In Black-2:
Hey, c'mon.
I thought you quit smoking.
I just don't understand why all of this is happening right now.
We followed instructions and did exactly what we were told.

Men In Black-1:
What it means is that our client wasn't the only one who thought those "secret society" computer geeks would be so much trouble.

Men In Black-2:
What're you talking about?

Men In Black-1:
Our client was in contact with Masami Eiri.
Better yet, it could be Masami Eiri was behind that all along.

Men In Black-2:
Enough about Eiri!
I'm sick of it!
I'm telling you that guy is dead.

Men In Black-1:
He is not dead.

Men In Black-2:
Uh? Wha...?

Men In Black-1:
Whether he had a body or not, at this point, never really mattered.
Never mattered...

Men In Black-2:
Are you serious?

Men In Black-2:
What's this for?
Your payment for services rendered?
You've been using us all along.
Is that what it is?

Kurosawa:
Well, you can interpret it anyway you like.

Men In Black-1:
You want us to leave town, huh?
And go where?

Kurosawa:
I suppose a place that has no power lines or any satellite coverage.

Men In Black-2:
That's ridiculous!
There's no place like that anywhere on Earth, and you know it!

Kurosawa:
Well, if you're going to run, you'd better get started finding a place like that.

Men In Black-1:
What's going to happen?
What are you planning to accomplish by connecting the Wired to the real world without using any devices?

Kurosawa:
Something absolutely wonderful...
I'm looking forward to it.

Men In Black-2:
What the hell... Ah...

Men In Black-1:
What's wrong with you?
What do you see?


[B-part]


Arisu:
Lain...?



Arisu:
I can't believe it...
This is Lain's room?
Lain?
L-Lain!

Lain:
Oh... Hello, Arisu...

Arisu:
What is... this...?

Lain:
Nothing.
I've just been watching stuff.
That's all.

Arisu:
Watching what?
I thought...
You know, for a while I thought I had gone completely crazy.
But it wasn't like that at all.
Tell me, Lain.
Tell me, why did you leave only me?
Why did you only leave my memories alone?
Why do I have to keep on living the past, remembering all those horrible things?
Tell me, what have I ever done to you for you to hate me so much.
I can't... I can't take this...
I just... I just can't live like this...

Lain:
No... You've got it all wrong, Arisu.
I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me.
I never meant to make you cry.

Arisu:
You liar! Look at what you've done!

Lain:
Arisu, you're really okay.

Arisu:
Huh?

Lain:
Can't you see?
You were always my closest friend even without ever connecting with me, Arisu.

Arisu:
Connecting...?
What are you saying?

Lain:
You're my only friend, Arisu.
And you've been aware of it all along.
Even without a connecting...

Arisu:
C-Connecting?
I don't... I don't understand you...

Lain:
To me... and everyone...

Arisu:
Stop!

Lain:
But Arisu...
I really do love you.

Arisu:
You're crazy!
Do you have any idea what you're saying, Lain?

Lain:
You have to understand that all humans were originally connected at an unconscious level.
I reconnected them, that's all.

Arisu:
What did you do?

Lain:
Hm?
I didn't really do anything.
When it comes down to it, it doesn't matter whether this side or the other side is real.
I was in both of them.
Without getting too technical, I'm basically a program designed to destroy the barrier between the Wired and the real world.

Arisu:
You're a program?
But that's insane!

Lain:
Oh no, not just me, Arisu.
You and everyone else were all just applications.
The truth is, you don't need bodies, understand?

Arisu:
You're wrong.
Look.
I don't really understand everything that you're saying.
But somehow, I think that you're wrong.
It feels like your body's cold, but you're alive, Lain.
Here, give me your hand.
I'm alive too.
You see?
My heart... beating, beating...

Lain:
Beating, beating...

Arisu & Lain:
Beating beating beating...

Lain:
But why?
Why is it beating?

Arisu:
Because I'm scared.
It's pounding because I'm scared.

Lain:
But how could you be?
You're smiling, Arisu?

Arisu:
Yeah, I guess I am.
But inside, I'm really scared.
I've always been scared.
I wonder why?

Lain:
I wonder why?

Masami:
Because she's afraid of losing her body.
All emotions are caused by impulses in the brain.
You just need to block the unpleasant ones.
And then select only the happy, pleasant one.
It's really that simple.

Lain:
Is that all it takes?

Arisu:
What is it, Lain?
Who's there?
Who're you talking to?

Masami:
If you really love her like you say, then Lain, why don't you try connecting with her?

Lain:
I'm not sure...

Arisu:
Lain, tell me!
Who are you talking to?
Lain!

Masami
You must have a bug.
Huh... very well.
I will have to take some time to give you a thorough debugging.
Lain, come.
Let's go.

Lain:
It is not a bug.
What I don't understand... is you, God.

Arisu:
God...?
You are talking to God...?
You are, aren't you?

Masami:
What don't you understand?
It's all very simple, Lain.

Lain:
What you did was to remove all the powerful devices that interacted with the Wired.
Phones. Television. The network. But without those, you couldn't have accomplished anything.

Masami:
Yes, Lain.
Those are things which accompanied human evolution.
They are not an end in themselves.
Understand that humans who are further evolved than other forms of life have a right to greater abilities.

Lain:
But wait a minute.
Who gave you those rights?

Masami:
Huh?

Lain:
The program that inserted code synched to the Earth's characteristic frequency into the corresponding Protocol Seven code ultimately raise the collective unconscious to the conscious level.
So tell me, did you honestly come up with these ideas all by yourself?

Masami
What is it you're getting at?
It can't be!
No!
Are you telling me there's been a God all along?

Lain:
It doesn't really matter, does it?
Without a body, you will never be able to truly understand.

Masami:
It's a lie! A lie!
I'm omnipotent, you hear me?
I'm the one who gave you a body here in the real world!
And this is the thanks I get?
You were scattered all over the Wired!
I gave you an ego!

Lain:
So, if that's true about me, what about you?

Masami:
I'm different!
How dare you!
I'm different!

Lain:
The Wired isn't an upper layer of the real world.

Masami
What do you mean?

Lain:
When you were inside the Wired, you were God or so it seemed.
But what about before the Wired ever came into existence.
You were standing in for someone who was waiting for the Wired to reach its current state.
You were just an acting God.

Masami:
An "acting" God?
That can't be!

Lain:
Arisu!
So, what do you think now?
You still think a body doesn't mean anything to you?
