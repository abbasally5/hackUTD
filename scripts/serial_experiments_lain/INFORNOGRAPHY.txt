Chisa:
I wish you'd come here.



Hodgeson:
If you please, excuse me, I'm feeling a little tired.
I hope you'll understand I can't stay.



Myu-Myu:
Hey, I've never seen one before.



Man:
Tell me, Lain Iwakura.
Are you and the Lain in the Wired in reality one and the same person?



Taro:
Right.
I remember seeing you once.
You were in the Wired.



Masami:
But I'm still here for you.
The man who truly loves you is here.



lain:
But how can you?
I'm Lain just like you are now, aren't I?

Lain:
No!
No!



Arisu:
That's right, Lain.
You see, it's just happened you're no longer needed in the real world.



lain:
Look at me.
I'm committing suicide!

Lain:
Why... Why are you so warm?
Why is it... Why do I have to feel your body heat?
Is there no escaping you?



Masami:
Yes, I am your true God.



Arisu:
You deceived me!



Arisu:
I bet there's a really fun girl inside that show you wrapped up in, just dying to get out.



Arisu:
You know, I think it's true she has changed.



Arisu:
Are you okay?
Lately it seems... you've been slipping away again.



Arisu:
Are you okay, Lain?



Arisu:
Lain, I'm so sorry.
Can you ever forgive me?
Are you okay, Lain?



Arisu:
That's good to hear.


[B-Part]


Masami:
Are you tired?

Lain:
Yes, I am.

Masami:
You're really incredible.
But you may've gone too far.
So you've loaded an emulator of that Navi into your own brain to see what will happen.
It's dangerous to subject yourself to that much information.
At your current capacity, you'll certainly overflow.

Lain:
Am I a machine?
Don't talk about me like I'm a machine.
I'm not that.

Masami:
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
This is basically a software problem that we're facing.
Lain, what I've been telling you all this time is that you are software.
You're not hardware.

Lain:
I'm software?

Masami:
Yes. An executable program with a body.



Lain:
Be quiet...
Be quiet!

Lain:
Hi, Chisa.
Hey, Chisa.
We walked home from school together one afternoon, do you remember that?
I think I understand it all now.
I finally understand what you told me.

Chisa:
Listen, Lain.

Lain:
Huh?

Man:
Just remember.
It's easy to die, Lain.
Isn't that right?

Chisa:
It's not true.
There's nothing easy about dying.
Never is...

Man:
What do you talking about?
Hey, Lain.
You already have something that will let you do it.

Lain:
What do you mean?

Man:
And I've already taken the safety off.
The trigger's really kind of heavy, so you cradle with both hands and pull it with your thumb.
A girl just isn't strong enough.

Man:
What?
You still wanna stay in the real world?
Hey now, Lain, that's not fair.
You're the one who called me here, remember?

Lain:
But I... I never called you...

Man:
Bodies are totally meaningless.

Lain:
You're wrong.

Arisu:
Lain...

Lain:
Huh?
What the...?
What is this?



Juri:
Think it over.
I thought that maybe we could meet after school and I could introduce the two of you.
I promise you, you won't be sorry.
This guy is really pretty cute.
There's all those rumors going around about you and that teacher...
I think if you get a boyfriend, everyone will finally know that that's all just a pack of lies.
You know what I mean?
See you tomorrow, we'll talk about it then.
Bye.

Arisu:
Hmm...
It's not a lie...
Huh?
Wh-Who's there?
Who's there?
Lain...!
Wh-What the...
Wh-What's happened to you?
You're...

Lain:
It wasn't me...
Believe me...
You've got to believe me, Arisu.
I never peeked at your secrets. I never do something like that.
And it wasn't me who sent those secrets out onto the Wired.
I had nothing to do with it. I swear.

Arisu:
I don't know how you can stand there lying to me like that.
It was you, Lain! I saw you!

Lain:
But the person you saw isn't me...
It looks like I'm not the only me out there.
I guess some other me must've done it.

Arisu:
What are you trying to tell me?

Lain:
You might not be... the only Arisu out there either.

Lain:
Anyway, no matter how often I say I didn't do it, you are still going to believe that I did.
So instead, I'll make it so that it never really happened.
And I've been working practically day and night to be able to do just that.

Arisu:
What are you talking about?

Lain:
I don't need any devices any more.
It looks like... I've already destroyed the border between the Wired and the real world.
What I mean is I can go absolutely any place I want to now.
So I came right over here.
You see, I wanted you to know that I can undo something that never should have happened.

Arisu:
But, Lain...
I'm scared...
Please help me, I'm really scared...



Reika:
Arisu!

Juri:
Arisu.
Good morning!

Arisu:
Good morning...

Reika:
What's up, Arisu?
You seem so depressed.

Juri:
What is it, the time of the month or something?

Reika:
Hey, ever hear of "delicacy"?

Juri:
Just kidding.

Arisu:
Juri?
I don't think I can go through with it today.
Is that okay?

Juri:
Huh?
Go through with it?
With what?

Arisu:
What do you mean?
Didn't you send me a CU-mail yesterday?

Juri:
Huh?
Of course not.
I didn't.

Reika:
Boy, you are certainly acting strange today, Arisu.
Hey, Arisu, look!

Juri:
Hmm?
Oh, that teacher.
He sure is hot.

Reika:
Yeah.
But rumor has it that he's seeing an 8th-grader.
I still haven't figured out who it is though.

Juri:
What?
Are you serious?
That's gross.

Arisu:
Um... I... Uh... Listen.

Juri & Reika:
Hm? What is it?

Arisu:
It's about that teacher... and me...
There's something...

Juri & Reika:
Huh?

Reika:
What do you mean?
Is there something going on between you and that teacher?

Juri:
You're not about to tell me you like him or something.

Reika:
We're sorry, Arisu.
I think you're too late.

Juri:
Yeah, like we told you, he already has a girlfriend.

Reika:
That's not like you, Arisu.

Juri:
That's right.
She sure is acting strange today.

Juri:
Oh, good morning, Lain!

Reika:
Hurry it up, will you?

Juri:
Come on!
Come join us, Lain!

Reika:
Lain!

Arisu:
Lain... you...

Arisu:
You... you smiled...
