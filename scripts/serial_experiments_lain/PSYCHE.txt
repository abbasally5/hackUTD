Girl:
There's a girl named Lain.
You may have heard of her.
She's on the Wired--Lain.



Policeman:
Are your parents away on vacation or something?
I called the number you gave me, but no one answered the phone.

Lain:
They're just out.
I'm not lying.

Policeman:
No, I didn't say you were lying.
It's just my job to ask.
Don't worry, we're all through with you.
All right. You're Lain Iwakura, your address and phone number check out fine.
It's late, so I'm gonna have to have someone else take you home.
But next time, I want you to tell me exactly what you saw.
Keeping quiet is a bad idea, even if you weren't involved.
Okay, you're free to go now.

Alice:
Lain, I'm so sorry.
Can you ever forgive me?
Are you okay, Lain?
Are you alright now?
Let's go home, Lain.

Lain:
A...

Arisu:
What? What is it?
Yes, Lain?

Lain:
I... I'll be...um...

Alice's mother:
Alice! Come on!
We're going home.

Alice:
Lain...

Alice's mother:
Alice!

Alice:
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Lain.
Tomorrow... we'll talk tomorrow, okay?

Policeman:
Well, it's time for you to go home now too, huh?

Lain:
A... Alice...



Policeman:
You have a key, right?

Lain:
Yes.



Lain:
Messages...

Navi:
There are no messages for Lain.

Lain:
Good night, Navi.

Navi:
Good night, Lain.



Miho:
Don't you think it's embarrassing to oversleep and be late for school?

Lain:
I'm sorry.
Last night...
Mom?

Miho:
Hmm? What?

Lain:
Never mind. It's nothing.



Voice:
Lain... Lain... Lain...

Lain:
Huh?

Voice:
Good morning, Lain.
You can hear me, can't you?

Lain:
Who's there?

Voice:
You are not alone.



Girl:
Well how did it happen?
Did he kill himself?

Girl:
Did you see him?
Was he cute?

Girl:
I have no idea. They wouldn't show his face on TV.
Was he cute?

Juri:
Well, I think he was cute.

Reika:
Oh, you were screaming the whole time.
You didn't even see his face.

Juri:
I saw his feet.

Reika:
Admit it, Juri, you were too scared to look at the blood.

Arisu:
Hey, Lain!

Juri:
Uh Lain, did you get into any trouble?

Rika:
It's not like it was our fault, Juri.

Arisu:
Excuse me.

Reika:
You know, I think Arisu was the one closest to the guy.

Girls:
Really?
She was?
The blood splattered all over?

Arisu:
That's right.

Reika:
Year, I was so grossed out.

Juri:
Me, too.

Girl:
Arisu!



Voice:
But that's not all.
If you see the Pushuke simply as an upgraded processor, you lose sight of the whole picture.
As a multi-purpose information terminal, Navis have come into use all over the world, even with grade-school children.
However, activity within the Wired is currently limited by the machine.
The Pushuke can dramatically enhance the Navi in ways not yet fully understood.

Chisa:
There was no reason for me to stay in the real world any longer.
It was only holding me back.
In the real world, it no longer mattered whether I was there or not.
When I realized that, I was no longer afraid of losing my body.
Now I can live wherever I choose.

Voice:
Who is Lain?
Who is Lain?
Who is Lain?
Who is Lain?



Arisu:
Reika!
I think there's something wrong with us.
I mean last night, we saw someone actually die right in front of us.
But we're acting like... it's something we saw in some kind of a horror movie or something.

Reika:
I know we were there last night.
I know what I saw.
But it didn't seem real.
I guess an out-of-body experience is the best description.

Juri:
It was like that for me, too.
You know, maybe you should forget about it, Arisu.
And just not take it so seriously.

Arisu:
No, that's not what I mean.
It's just that it's strange that we can't take it seriously.
Right, Lain?

Lain:
What?
Oh, sorry.

Arisu:
What's that?
Lain, did somebody send you a love letter?

Juri & Reika:
What? No way!

Lain:
No... I tell you... it's not...

Juri & Reika:
Let us see! Let us see!

Reika:
Come on, don't be a baby!
Let me see it!

Arisu:
Stop that, Reika!
Come on, give it back to her.

Reika:
Ah... a brown envelope.

Juri:
Is there anything inside it?

Juri:
So?

Reika:
What have we got here?

Juri:
Well?

Reika:
Talk about boring.

Juri:
I knew it wasn't.



Lain:
Pushuke...


[B-Part]


Girl:
It's not a secure program.
Some hacker got into my voicemail this morning.
I can't believe it!

Man:
Seeing as how there was no pertinent information in the research we received from your office, we're currently discussing how to handle it.
Now, as for your company...

Woman:
I love kissing.
Just kissing is enough to make me happy.

Man:
Well that kid pulled some stupid stunt while he was on Accela, right?
Looks like the black market supplier's freaking out.
You just can't find it anywhere now.

Man:
Rumor has it that the Pushuke chip is mass-produced in factories in Taiwan.
They'll tell you that it was designed by a group of renegades called the "Knights."
There are a lot of urban legends like that surrounding the Wired.
But I'm not sure if these "Knights" even exist.

Girl:
You feel so good, when you die.

Man:
I feel like I'm being accelerated.

Woman:
Oh no, there's someone in my room!
Can't you see?
There's a little person like a kid there, wearing red- and green-striped clothes!
I can't move in my bed!
It's standing by my door!
I can feel it watching me!
Someone help me! Aah!

Girl:
I have a picture of you with your lover.
I just want to do business.
What do you say?
If you don't buy it, I'll leak this JPEG to your company's server.
You'll be famous all over the Wired.

Girl:
Lain, why won't you come here?



Navi:
Hello, Lain.
Lain has new mail.

Lain:
Navi.

Yasuo:
How's it going, Lain?

Lain:
Uh...

Yasuo:
So tell me, have you gotten used to your new Navi yet?
What's the matter?
Is there something wrong?

Lain:
Do you know what this is?

Yasuo:
I have no idea.

Lain:
I thought you'd know.
I thought that you'd know, Daddy.

Yasuo:
Lain, I said I-I don't know.



Man:
C'mon, why not? Why not?

Woman:
I can't.



JJ:
Lain.
Where you been lately?
I haven't seen you around, and everyone's been looking for you, sweetie.

Lain:
What do you mean...?

JJ:
Check you.
You're really going for that little school girl look, aren't you?
How 'bout another rave, huh?
I'll leave the planning to you.



Taro:
What're you trying to act so tough for?

Lain:
Excuse me?

Masayuki:
Look who's talking.

Lain:
Do you know what this is?

Taro:
Wow!
That's a real Pushuke, isn't it?

Masayuki and Myu-Myu:
Huh?

Masayuki:
I don't believe it.

Mew-Mew:
Wow, no way!
I've never seen one before.

Masayuki:
Where in the world did you get it?

Lain:
What exactly does it do?

Taro:
You mean you don't know?
If I install that thing in here, I can have full access to the Wired and do anything I want with it.

Lain:
But I still don't understand how to use it.

Mew-Mew:
You don't know?
Talk about lame, man.
Huhuhu...

Masayuki:
Wanna sell it?
Can I buy it off you, huh? Can I?

Taro:
Moron!
You can't buy something like that.
What kind of Navi do you have?

Lain:
I'm not sure.
I think it's a Tachibana.
I think it's their newest model.

Masayuki & Mew-Mew & Taro:
What?
Awesome!

Taro:
So it's new?
I mean, you haven't gotten inside of it yet?

Masayuki:
Wow... You're in eighth grade? Ninth?

Lain:
Eighth.

Masayuki:
So, that means you've taken Basic Information at school, right?
So you should know, a Navi's basic motherboard layout is right there in the textbook.
You connect that opposite to the main processor.
It intercepts the original online information and automatically manipulates it on its own.
Using it is almost as easy as building a model kit.
Just avoid static electricity.

Lain:
Oh, thank you.

Taro:
Hold it!
Information isn't free here, you know.
It doesn't matter if you're in the real world or the Wired.

Masayuki:
How much should we charge, Taro?
How much?

Lain:
Oh... well...

Taro:
You're Lain, aren't you?

Lain:
Ah?

Taro:
Right.
I remember seeing you once.
You were in the Wired.

Lain:
You saw me... logged on the Wired?

Taro:
You were different.
Nothing like the way you seem now.
There's nothing unusual about taking on a different personality in the Wired than the one you have in the real world.
It's pretty much expected.
But yours are like total opposites!

Mew-Mew:
No way!

Taro:
And weren't you also in the club at the same time when those stupid shootings happened?
So, what do you plan to do now?

Lain:
What do you... What do you want me to do for you?

Taro:
Go out on a date with me.

Mew-Mew:
Moron.

Taro:
Myu-Myu, quiet.
But not like you are now.
I want the wild Lain.
I'm only kidding, girlfriend!
But hey, if you ever feel like going out sometime...

Mew-Mew:
What the hell are you talking about?

Masayuki:
Mew-Mew, chill out!

Taro:
Forget about it.
You're just jealous.

Mew-Mew:
Jealous?
Jealous... right.



Mika:
Ah... Can I help you?
Are you here to see someone?
Who are you looking for?

Men in Black 1:
Just keep walking and don't turn back.
You never saw us at all.
Understand?

Mika:
I'll call the police!
Who the hell are you?

Men in Black 2:
Go ahead.
But what could you possibly say that we're not even here?

Mika:
Hey, hold on.
Hey! Don't you walk away!



Mika:
Mom, if they show up again, you should call the cops.
Are you listening? Mom?
Huh...



Mika:
Lain, what in the world are you doing in here?
What are you doing?
Why... why are you dressed like that?

Lain:
Oh... it's for static electricity.
They say the only way to really prevent it is to take your clothes off.

Mika:
Huh? You gotta be kidding.

Lain:
Hahaha...
Welcome home, big sister.
