Girl:
Why? Why won't you come?
You really should come here.



Woman #1:
What's the matter with her?

Woman #2:
Oh my gosh!

Woman #1:
She's too much!

Woman #2:
I know!



Man:
C'mon baby!

Woman:
No, I...

Man:
C'mon, c'mon!

Woman:
Ow, ow... stop...
Hey, cut it out!
Get off!
No!

Man:
Oh, don't be like that. C'mon...
Come here.

Woman:
Hey... Don't... C'mon!



Man:
Huh?

Man:
What the hell?
What's going on here?

Woman:
Oh no! This is horrible!

Man:
I don't know.

Man:
What's all that noise? What happened?

Man:
I don't know anything!
We got nothing to do with this.

Woman:
She just came outta nowhere!



Lain:
It's so noisy...
Can you just shut up!?

Passenger #1:
Huh?

Passenger #2:
Huh?



Schoolgirls:
Morning!

Hi...

Morning!
Morning!

Your hair looks so good today.
...You gotta show me what's in it.



Julie:
(Crying)

Alice:
Julie, c'mon, don't make such a big deal out of it.

Reika:
Yeah, really. It's just some stupid prank!

Julie:
But I just...

Alice:
Aww Julie, it's okay.
Lain?

Lain:
Ah?

Alice:
So, did you get one, too?

Lain:
Get what?

Alice:
The e-mail!

Lain:
The e-mail?

Alice:
Chisa Yomoda's e-mail!

Lain:
Um... I'm not up... on all that stuff...

Alice:
You really oughta check your e-mail at least once a day.
It's best to, you know.

Reika:
Baby Lain doesn't know computers.

Lain:
Poor Julie.
Why's she crying?

Reika:
Because she got that awful e-mail from Chisa.
Oh, can't you put two and two together?

Lain:
Chisa?

Reika:
It was suicide.
She was the one in D in our second period.
She jumped off a building last week.
The teacher told everyone!

Alice:
And it's not just Julie.
There were a whole bunch of other people who had gotten e-mail from her this week also.

Lain:
But if she's... she's...

Alice:
...Dead? Then we shouldn't be getting any e-mail from her.
It must be a prank.



Navi:
Login.
Who is the user?

Lain:
Huh?

Navi:
Lain.
Please state your name.

Lain:
Lain.

Navi:
Voice accepted.
Greetings to user Lain.
User Lain has new e-mail.

Lain:
Who's it from?

Navi:
Chisa Yomoda.
Do you wish to read your e-mail?

Navi:
Hello, how are you?


[B-Part]


Navi:
Lain, I remember walking home with you once.
Do you remember?

Lain:
Mmm.

Navi:
I have only... given up my body.
You see, by sending you e-mail, I can use the system to explain to you that I am still alive.
I wanted to let you know this, Lain.
I want all the others to know too, so I have sent them e-mail also.
You may find this hard to believe.
Do you understand?
It's okay if you don't.
You will all understand soon.

Lain:
Why did you die?

Navi:
There is a rumor at that school that this e-mail is some sort of a prank.
But I want you to know, Lain, that it is not a prank.
This is real.

Lain:
But why?
Why did you die?

Navi:
Here... there is a god.

Lain:
Huh?



Mika:
I'm finished already.
Is that okay, Mom?
I had a big lunch today.

Lain:
Um... Mom?

Moho:
Yes?

Lain:
I got an e-mail from a friend today.
It was from this girl I know who killed herself last week.



Yasuo:
Well, what is it, Lain?
You usually don't come to visit me in here.
What is it?

Lain:
I...
You know that Navi... in my room?
It's old now.
Do you think that I could...

Yasuo:
Hahaha...
So finally caught the computer bug, have you?
Lain, you are in junior high now already.
Your school chums must be leaving you in the technical dust.
Huh?
We should upgrade that old Navi.
You know Lain, in the real world or the Wired world, people are connected somehow.
That's how societies are created.
You should broaden your horizons, make an effort to create friends.
Take the initiative--even a girl like you should be able to make friends right off the bat.
You can live and communicate in both worlds.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
I wish your mother could understand that.

Lain:
I'm not scared, not really.

Yasuo:
So... why are you up so late?
And talking about your old Navi.

Lain:
I have a friend I want to see.

Yasuo:
Yeah! Haha!



Man:
What happened?

Man:
Oh man...

Lain:
Ouch...

Announcement:
Ladies and gentlemen.
We apologize for the inconvenience.
The train is temporarily stopped due to an accident.
Please be patient.

Man:
What was that?
Do you think we hit someone?

Man:
I can't believe this.

Man:
Who cares?

Lain:
Ah?



Teacher:
Miss Iwakura?

Lain:
Ha?

Teacher:
Miss Iwakura?

Lain:
Yes, ma'am?

Teacher:
Blackboard?
You know this will be on the test.

Lain:
Um...



Lain:
Chisa?
So where... are you?
Wait.
