Lain:
Okay, let's see...
I guess that I'm confused again...
Am I here, or am I there?
I don't know.
Over there, I'm everywhere.
I know that.
But here is connected to over there.
Is that right?
But then where is the real me, after all is said and done?
Oh, there is no real me.
I guess that's it.
I only exist inside those people who are aware of my existence.
But what about this me that I can hear talking right here and now.
It's me... isn't it?
This me that's talking.
Who is it...?
Who is me?


[OP]


Lain:
Arisu!
So, what do you think now?
You still think a body doesn't mean anything to you?
Arisu...

Arisu:
Why don't you leave me alone?

Lain:
I mess up almost everything I try to do for you, Arisu.
I don't know what's wrong with me...
Honest, I didn't mean to...
Arisu! Arisu!
I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Arisu, I'm sorry...



Mika:
I'm finished.

Yasuo:
Hold on there.
You didn't clean your plate.

Miho:
She says she's on a diet.

Mika:
Tell the whole world, why don't you?

Yasuo:
Oh, I... might get a package today.
It's C.O.D.
Here it comes, pay for it, okay?

Miho:
What is it?
Computer parts again?

Yasuo:
Hey.

Miho:
Yes?

Yasuo:
No, it's nothing.



Juri:
Arisu!

Reika:
Arisu! We're going out tonight, right?

Juri:
Cyberia! Cyberia!

Arisu:
Oh, sure.
Why not?
Better mail her, too.

Juri & Reika:
Huh?

Juri:
Arisu, Um... who are you going to be sending mail to?

Arisu:
Um? Ah...

Juri:
Oh... don't tell me you want her to come along.
You know?

Arisu:
Huh? Who are you talking about?
You mean... Chisa?

Reika:
Yeah, Chisa Yomoda.

Juri:
You know, one time, you made us take her to Cyberia.
But it's like she just didn't care or her mind was someplace else.

Reika:
Inviting her is pointless.

Arisu:
I get it...

Juri & Reika:
What?

Arisu:
Hmm... it's nothing.
I just thought of something strange, that's all.

Juri:
What do you mean something strange?

Arisu:
Well, it's simply that what isn't remembered never happened.

Juri:
Not remember?

Arisu:
That's right.
If you aren't remembered, then you never actually existed.

Reika:
Who are you talking about?
Someone we know?

Arisu:
Like I said, I didn't really have anybody in mind.
Well, c'mon.
Let's hit the books!

Juri & Reika:
Arisu!



Masayuki & Myu-Myu & Taro:
Go!

Masayuki:
Ah, I gotta do it again?
C'mon, one more time!

Myu-Myu:
Hurry up!

Masayuki:
Wait for me!

Myu-Myu:
You're such a sucker.

Taro:
Huh?
E-mail?

Myu-Myu:
What?

Myu-Myu:
Who's that girl, Taro?

Taro:
I... don't know.

Masayuki:
Now what?

Man:
Hey, nice machine!

Taro:
Huh?

Man:
The one I've got's pretty tricked out, too.

Girl:
C'mon, hurry.

Man:
Hm?

Girl:
C'mon! C'mon!
Mom's waiting for us now.

Man:
Okay, okay...
Bye.

Myu-Myu:
Hurry up!

Masayuki:
Hey, no fair!
Shoot for it again!

Myu-Myu:
Let's go, Taro!

Masayuki:
I'm gonna shoot for it again, Myu-Myu!

Masami:
I'll quit... I'll quit that dump...
That crap they make me go through those idiots don't miss me when I'm gone, that's for sure...
They all underestimate me...

Taro:
Oh, well.

Masami:
I'll quit... I'll quit...
Hmm?
I'll quit... I'll quit today for sure...



Lain:
Is that true?


[B-Part]


lain:
Why are you crying, Lain?
Because you deleted yourself from everyone's memory?
But Lain, isn't that what you wanted all along?

Lain:
Yes, it is... but...

lain:
You must feel good that no one is dying in any strange way and no one is being hurt.
And no one hates you either.

Lain:
Yeah... I guess...

lain:
And don't forget that dead people's information is no longer leaking out of the Wired anymore.
Not anymore.
So at last, Lain is free and no longer needs to be anywhere.
This is the way you wanted to be, isn't it, Lain?

Lain:
You sound just like him, you know that?

lain:
Him?
That man has never existed all along.
Even if he had, he wouldn't have had thoughts about being God.

Lain:
I know...
But I'm nowhere now...
If I'm nowhere, then what? Then who am I?
And where am I?

lain:
You yourself said it.

Lain:
Uh?

lain:
The Wired isn't an upper layer of the real world, isn't that right?
That's what that man was mistaken about.

Lain:
Ah...

lain:
A network is a field to pass along information.
Information doesn't stand still there.
Information functions by always being in motion.

Lain:
Oh, yeah...

lain:
People's memories aren't just personal or one part unrelated fragment of the history of humanity.

Lain:
But they're shared in the collective unconscious.

lain:
Do you think that humans could create something that could store memory that's that vast?
I really don't see how.

Lain:
The Wired was just connected to something else all along.
But... then... what was it made to connect to...?

lain:
Do you believe most people really need to know that?

Lain:
Huh?

lain:
Just look how far they've come and how much they've accomplished without ever knowing.
The human world creates and prays to its various gods and they convince themselves.
"This is how the world is."

Lain:
I don't like how you're saying this.

lain:
Either way, it is Lain that's saying it. Me. Understand?
Oh, that's right. Lain was never a person now, was she?
Lain is omnipresent, existing everywhere.
Lain watches quietly, seeing everything.
Right, Lain is God.

Lain:
Wrong.
You're wrong!

lain:
It would be much easier if you became God.
I think it would be a lot easier than being a human being.
You wouldn't have to do anything.
Just stand there and watch all day.
No one would ever look down on Lain, or cast judgement.
No one would ever hate Lain, either.

Lain:
I don't know...

lain:
Hey, Lain...
Why don't we go back to the way it was.
And start things all over again.
I mean, you already reset things once.

Lain:
Enough!

lain:
Fine. Then just what are you, Lain?

Lain:
I... I-I guess that I... I guess that I...
Where do I exist...?

Yasuo:
Come, Lain...

Lain:
Is that you, Dad?

Yasuo:
Lain, you don't have to wear that, ever again.
You understand?

Lain:
Daddy, do you know what...?

Yasuo:
What?

Lain:
Everyone... I feel like...

Yasuo:
You love them?

Lain:
Um...

Yasuo:
Am I mistaken?
Lain, I'll make us some nice hot tea next time.
I know, with some madeleines.
Definitely. They're great!



Lain:
So memories aren't only out of the past, are they?
They can be of right now, or even of tomorrow.



Man:
Unbelievable!

Arisu:
Isn't it? But hang on a second.
I have just one question.
I listened to everything you had to say.
Very patiently, I might add.
You'll at least let me pick the curtains for the bedroom, right?

Man:
Yes, ma'am.
Anything that makes you happy.
It's fine with me.

Arisu:
Anything? That's my good student.

Man:
Something wrong?

Arisu:
Huh... No.
Sorry... Honey, wait here just a minute.

Man:
Where are you...?

Arisu:
Well, hello there.

Lain:
Oh... hello to you.

Arisu:
Have we met before?
We have, haven't we?

Arisu:
Did you go to the school where I was student teaching?
No, that can't be it.
Let's see...

Lain:
I'm pleased to meet you.

Arisu:
Huh?

Lain:
Pleased to meet you, right?

Arisu:
That's right.
I'm pleased to meet you, then.
Well, my name is Arisu.
Pretty boring name.
Don't you think so?
I'm kind of embarrassed by it.
And who are you?

Lain:
Lain...

Arisu:
Lain...?
Hmm...?

Man:
Friend of yours?

Arisu:
I thought she was someone else.
Lain, I've got to go now.
But you never know, maybe we'll run into each other again someday.
Bye!

Man:
Bye, Lain.

Arisu:
See ya.

Lain:
You're right. We can see each other anytime.



Lain:
I promise you I'll always be right here.
I'll right next to you.
Forever...
