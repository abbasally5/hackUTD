Girl:
I don't need parents.
Humans are alone.
They're connected to no one.
No one at all.
No one.



Mika:
Let's see... mmhmm...

Miho:
So, how'd it go?

Mika:
Dad, what's with Lain?
She's... really been acting strange lately.

Yasuo:
Now Mika, that's just perfectly normal.

Mika:
What? Have you even seen her?

Miho:
Mika, do I have to remind you again about your tone of voice?
Is that right?

Yasuo:
Yes, of course it is.



Man:
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
What do you want!?
What's going on!?
Damn keys!

Girl:
Gotcha.



Alice:
Hey Reika, our next period is homeroom.

Julie:
Lucky!

Reika:
Don't you think it's strange they called for a special staff meeting?

Alice:
Do you really think it's true, then?

Reika:
What, Alice?

Alice:
They say that a senior committed suicide.

Julie:
Huh? Suicide?

Alice:
And not just at our school, Julie.
Somebody jumped off of their roof--of their apartment building.

Alice:
Lain?

Lain:
Huh? Oh.

Alice:
Huh?

Lain:
Sorry. What is it?

Julie:
You really don't think Lain would have heard anything about what happened, do you?

Lain:
The suicide, you mean?

Reika:
Lain, where did you hear about that?

Alice:
You know?

Lain:
Well, yeah.
I only heard about it.

Alice:
Oh, like where?

Lain:
On the Wired.

Alice:
Right, you must've gotten the hang of your new Navi by now.
You'll have to show it to me sometime.

Lain:
Mmm, sure, Alice.
But after I modify it.

Julie:
You're modifying it?
I didn't know you were into all that hacking stuff.

Reika:
You know, I don't know what it is about you, Lain.
You've changed.

Lain:
Really?
How so?

Julie:
Reika's right.

Reika:
I can't put my finger on it.



Julie:
So, what sort of rumors have you heard lately on the Wired?

Lain:
Well, that it's some kind of interactive game.

Reika:
A game?
A network game, you mean?

Lain:
I don't really know.
I haven't played it yet.
But they've been saying that all the kids who committed suicide were hooked on it.

Julie:
And guys really do like that kind of stuff too, you know.

Alice:
A game?
Wow, sounds dangerous.

Lain:
I know, but... Um...

Alice:
Hey, take it easy.
You'll choke on it.

Lain:
I'm... I'm okay.
Do you mind if I go home right now?

Reika:
Hey, you don't need to ask our permission for everything.

Julie:
You got something to do?

Lain:
I wanna put the finishing touches on my Navi.
It's still in bits and pieces.

Julie:
Oh, you prefer a machine to your friends, huh?

Alice:
Julie, that's enough!
Stop badgering her!

Julie:
I was just asking.

Alice:
Lain, just let us know when you're done.

Lain:
Mmhmm!
I'll see you later.

Alice:
You know, I think it's true--she has changed.
Aah!
Oh, I'm really sorry.
Here.

Girl:
It was all my fault.
I dropped it.
Sorry! Goodbye! Bye!



Lain:
Log in: Lain.

Navi:
Authorized.

Lain:
Mail?

Navi:
Voicemail.

Man:
Hello, Lain.
I couldn't figure out the answer to your question by myself,
so I asked a colleague at the lab about it.
If that is a Pushuke processor that you are trying to install,
then you probably should set the oscillation to "variable" like you thought.
Navi motherboards are designed to be compatible with just about anything,
but you might run into some glitches.
Good luck to you.
Remember, if you need anything else, just ask.



Girl:
JJ!

JJ:
Yeah?

Girl:
You know anything about that Net game all the kids are playing?

JJ:
Ah, Phantoma.
Forget about it.
An adult like you wouldn't be into a game like that.
So, why do you ask, hmm?
No!
Oh man, are my ears, like, playing tricks on me already?
Ahaha...



Boy:
Make it go away!
I'm no longer part of it.
I quit already.


[B-Part]


Boy:
This isn't the Wired!
Why?
What am I doing here?

Girl:
Wait!
Don't run away.

Boy:
Who-Who are you?
Are you a PK, too?
Please, help me!

Girl:
I can't go where you are.

Boy:
What's going on?
Stop screwing around!
Bullet charge, lock, gauge 5!
Stop right there!
Die!
Die!
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!
Die!
Die, you bastard!
Die!
Bastard! Bastard! Bastard! Bastard! Bastard! Bastard! ...



Boy:
I was scared.
I didn't know it was just a young girl.
I'm telling you it wasn't my fault.
Look, I didn't even know who she was.
She just came out of nowhere.

The game Phantoma uses this dedicated client-server application.
It lets you fight in the Wired without any boundaries.
I downloaded the app from an illegal server to play it just a little while ago.
For us, it had the most advanced dungeon-style action game interface.
But it had somehow gotten linked up with a tag game played by kindergartners.



Navi:
Lain has mail.

Lain:
Open it.

JJ:
Hey Lain, it's JJ.
I didn't know you were into something like Phantoma.
I, uh, I checked around, but I didn't find out all that much.
Um, anyway, the basic game isn't all that unusual in the Wired nowadays.
So, my guess is they just modified that.
The problem is how the programs connect to each other.
It looks like there's some kind of weird hole in the protocol.
My buddies and I think that it might be the work of the Knights.

Lain:
The Knights...

Yasuo:
Lain.
Looks like you've gotten very comfortable now.
Talking to people on the Wired.

Lain:
Yeah.

Yasuo:
Let me give you just one little warning.

Lain:
Yeah?

Yasuo:
I think that my little girl perhaps has become obsessed with the Wired.
It's just an advanced medium for communication.
Don't ever get it confused with the real world.
Do you understand what I'm warning you about?

Lain:
You're wrong.

Yasuo:
Huh?

Lain:
The border between the two isn't so clear.
And I will be able to enter it soon.
In full range and full motion.
I'll be completely metamorphosed.

Yasuo:
But even with a top-of-the-line civilian-use Navi, you couldn't possibly...

Lain:
I can do it.
I've upgraded it.

Yasuo:
A Pushuke processor, huh?
But Lain...

Lain:
Don't worry, Daddy.
I'm still me, you know.

Yasuo:
Sometimes I wonder.



Woman:
I waited for you.
Why the hell didn't you come?
Why?

Man:
Damn you!
Damn you!
Damn you!
Damn you!

Woman:
This mail is one of happiness.
By agreeing to receive this, you'll be happier than you've ever dreamed possible.

Man:
In other words, the Knights do not physically exist, but are rather thought itself that occurs inside the Wired.
They can be thought of as a religion that is spreading through the Wired and into your subconscious.

Man:
Would you go out with me?
If you already have a boyfriend, I apologize.
If you really like him, I'll give up on you.
But please browse code J946-5488AA9...

Woman:
Whoever gets this mail, please help me, whoever you are.
You may not believe this, but I'm always being followed.

Girl:
Lain, why won't you hurry and come here?



Lain:
Just go away.
Go away!

Navi:
Intruder interrupted.
