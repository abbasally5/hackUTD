Girl:
If you can hear it, then it's speaking to you.
And if you can see it, then it's yours to have.



Man's voice:
Mankind is a creature that no longer evolves.
Compared to other animals, the incidence of cancer in man is exceedingly small.
One theory says that man, a neoteny, is no longer able to evolve.
If this is actually true, then what an absurd creature man has ultimately evolved into.
Not knowing what it is that drives them or even keeps them alive,
they keep their bodies merely to satisfy the desires of the flesh.
They're worthless, don't you think?
That's all mankind is when it comes down to it.
However, you don't have to remain a wretched human being forever.
Mankind has finally created an exit whereby he can cheat mortality and escape.

Lain:
Huh?
What do you mean?

Man's voice:
The network.
The Wired is the way.
Lain.

Lain:
But tell me who you are.

Man's voice:
I'm God.



Man:
Wanna get something to eat?
Come on, aren't you hungry?
Hey, wait.
Next time I'll take you to the pool.



Mika:
Huh...
Damn, I can't believe it.



Lain:
Tell me a story.
Come on, please.
Just one story, okay?

Doll:
What kind of story would you like to hear, Lain?

Lain:
Let's see...
Hmm.
Hey, how about something I never heard of.

Doll:
There is nothing in the world that exists that you do not already know.
And I cannot tell you a story that does not even exist.
You understand, don't you?

Well, how about this, then?
For every event, there is first a prophecy for shadowing the event.
An event first comes into existence when there is a prophecy.

Lain:
By whom?
Who makes these prophecies?



Announcer:
Throughout Tokyo today, the VTCZX road traffic information system that monitors the entire metropolitan area sent out information that was incorrect.
It appears that the auto-drive programs in cars and trucks interfered with traffic signals, sending them out of control and causing accidents.
There was a fatality in Shibuya area of downtown, Tokyo today.
The Information Ministry says the system is up and running, and such an accident will never happen again.



Taro:
Excuse me?

Mika:
Huh?

Taro:
What's up?
How about a date?
What do you say?

Mika:
Huh...

Taro:
Wow!

Mika:
Hey!

Taro:
Uh-oh...
Oh, shit!
Later!

Mika:
Hey, you!
Little weirdo!
Grr...damn it.
Oh no.
Oh well, I guess I'll have to have it dry-cleaned.
Huh?
What the...
What in the world is this?
Some kind of bad joke.
Oh...

Woman's voice:
What's she doing?

Woman's voice:
I don't know.

Man's voice:
Is she crazy or something?

Lain:
Everyone gets connected.
Everyone gets connected.
Everyone gets connected.

Mika:
Lain, what...
What in the world is her problem?



Mask:
The prophecy will be fulfilled, Lain.

Lain:
But then, it's no longer a prophecy.

Mask:
Everything is a prophecy.
History is not a random collection of points scattered along the timeline.
The individual points are all connected in the continue.
They are all connected along with common line.
No.
It is more accurate to say that they are made to connect to the line.

Lain:
By who?
Who's the one who connects all these points?



Arisu:
Lain!

Reika:
Hey Lain, what on the earth did you do?

Juri:
I still can't believe it, Lain.
I guess that you really are pretty good.

Arisu:
I have no idea you could pull off a complicated hacker stun like that.

Lain:
What're you girls talking about?

Reika:
She's still playing innocent, I guess.

Lain:
I really don't understand.

Arisu:
You mean to say that you honestly didn't do it, Lain?

Lain:
Do what?



Announcer:
The Information Control Bureau of the Information Ministry began their official investigation this afternoon of the yesterday's computer crash and the VTCZX road traffic information system, stating that there is a high probability that it was a deliberate act.
At this time, the Bureau, Road Information Ministry that includes...


[B-Part]


Girl:
Your total is 948 yen.
Here's your change.
Please enjoy your meal.

Arisu:
Huh? Oh no!
There it is again.

Reika:
Not again?

Juri:
What, Arisu?

Arisu:
Spam.
Indiscriminate mail.
This guys are so persistent.

Reika:
"Fulfill the prophecy," is that it?

Juri:
What are we talking about?
Is it a declaration of war by some cult?

Arisu:
I asked some geeks, I met them on the Wired a while ago.
They always have the inside track on this kind of thing.
They said it might be the Knights.

Juri:
The Knights?
Who is the Knights?

Arisu:
Well, I think that it's some kind of super-hacker group.

Reika:
Are you sure it is?
I always heard that hackers hardly ever work together unless they have to.

Arisu:
That's true.
But maybe these Knights are some kind of a loose affiliation and not really a formal group at all.
They say that they have a lot of power in the Wired, and they do a lot of their work in secret.
They're practically impossible to detect.

Juri:
So they really are a secret society.

Reika:
Geez.
So they're getting their kicks out of messing with other people's e-mail.

Arisu:
I'm not sure.
But maybe...

Juri & Reika:
Yeah?

Arisu:
Maybe there's another explanation.
Maybe they're not just in it for the fun or for the money.

Juri & Reika:
Hm...



Miho:
The Wired might actually be thought of as a highly advanced upper layer of the real world.
In other words, physical reality is nothing but an illusion, a hologram of the information that flows to us through the Wired.

Lain:
But, Mom...

Miho:
This is because the body, physical motion, the activity of the human brain, is merely a physical phenomenon simply caused by synapses delivering electrical impulses.

Lain:
But Mom, I...

Miho:
The physical body exists at a less evolved plane only to verify one's existence in the universe.

Lain:
Are you really truly my mother?
Are you...



Mika:
Lain?

Lain:
Huh?

Mika:
Didn't I see you down in Shibuya?
Forget it. It's nothing.



Salesgirl:
Thank you.
Come again soon.

Girl:
Hey, you know I don't know.
I thought he was pretty cute.

Girl:
So, how are things going with the two of you anyway?

Girl:
Come on, go ahead.
You can tell us.

Mika:
Wh-What prophecy are you talking about?
Huh?



Mika:
What's going on?
I usually have dinner with my Mom and Dad about now.
Wh-Why me?
Is... Is someone there?
Come on, I know you're in there.



Lain:
Are you real?
Are you really, my dad?

Yasuo:
Have you ever considered another possibility?
That what flows through the Wired isn't merely electrical information.

Lain:
Huh?

Yasuo:
If we can assume that it was the development of the worldwide system of electricity,
phones and computers that caused the eventual formation of the Wired,
then I have to wonder if another world was created.

Lain:
Another world?

Yasuo:
Here in the real world, God exists only as an imaginary concept.
But in the Wired, there may actually exist a sort of Deus-like embodiment of an all powerful being.

Lain:
Is it really god?

Yasuo:
I really don't know whether or not that should actually be called a god per se.
But at the very least, I think it has the same kind of super natural power that is written of in old myths or legends.

Lain:
You know, I think it might have been God that I talked with on several occasions.

Yasuo:
The Deus of the Wired may already have harnessed enough power across over and affect the real world in some isolated instances.
It's true in the form of prophecy.

Lain:
Prophecy?



Lain:
What's the matter?

Mika:
It's nothing.
It's nothing at all.



Lain:
Who'll it be today?
