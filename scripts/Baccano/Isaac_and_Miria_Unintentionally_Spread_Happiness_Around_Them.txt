Chief:
Alright, gentlemen, I'd like to introduce special agents, Bill Sullivan and Donald Brown.
They're working on this case for the Justice Department.
Thanks.

Inspector Sullivan:
Yeah.

Inspector Brown:
It's a pleasure.

Chief:
They're here because they're pursuing suspects in the string of unusual robberies from San Francisco all the way to the East Cost.
There's been over 80 of them so far.
Of course I pledged the entire force's full cooperation.
These are the only known photographs of the robbers.
Next…next…next…

Inspector:
Uh, Chief…

Chief:
What is it?

Inspector:
You trying to put one over on us? [put one over on: ～をかつぐ]

Chief:
I can see why you think that, but these suspects are the only jokers.

Inspector:
Chief…

Chief:
Go ahead.

Inspector:
If they had time to pose for photos, why haven't they been caught before now?

Chief:
I think it'll be better if I let Mr. Sullivan answer that question.

Inspector Sullivan:
These photographs were given to us by citizens who took them because they were intrigued by their costumes.
Most people thought they were actors and didn't even realize that they were criminals until afterwards.

Inspector Brown:
Up until recently, their crimes have all been petty offences, nothing serious enough to get them on our wanted list: chocolate, candy, watches…　[petty offence:軽犯罪]

Inspector Sullivan:
Once they stole the door to a history museum.

Inspector:
If that's so, why don't we just tell their mamas and let them slap them around?

Chief:
Because lately they're hunting bigger game.

Inspector Sullivan:
 [make off with: ~を盗む]

Inspector:
Sir…

Chief:
Now what?

Inspector:
So, why the sudden change of plans?

Chief:
Honestly, I'm looking forward to finding the answer to that myself.
After they're behind bars, of course.


Isaac:
This is terrible!
Miria, we've forgotten something of the upmost importance!

Miria:
What could it be?

Issac:
Miria, it's Ennis!

Miria:
Whatever shall we do?

Isaac:
What will we ever do?

Miria:
Isaac!

Isaac:
Miria!

Isaac, Miria:
We forgot to buy a gift for Ennis!


Nick:
I think there's something crawling around up there.
Aaaa…Go!

Jacuzzi:
That's the Rail Tracer!

Nice:
I think it's gone.

Jacuzzi:
Let's go!
All right, guys, up there!
Donny, you go through the car and wait for us at the next coupling!
You got that?

Donny:
No problem!

Jacuzzi:
Hey, watch out for the guys, black suits, okay?

Donny:
Right!

Jacuzzi:
Let's go!

Nick:
Hey, Nice, Jacuzzi seems pretty worked up, huh?　　　[worked up(何かに対して)興奮する]

Nice:
I haven't seen him like this since the Russo family killed eight of our guys!

Nick:
He fought greatly with tears last time. I wonder how far he'll go now?


Gustavo:
I'm Gustavo Bagetta of the Runorata family.
I'm sorry we were a little rough.
But relax; we not planning to kill you.

Eve:
Runorata… I've heard that name before.

Gustavo:
That's because your grandfather, father and brother all used to be good friends with our boss.

Eve:
Why are you doing this?

Gustavo:
We have business with your (?beloved )brother.

Eve:
Do you mean Dallas?

Gustavo:
Your big brother has been a very naughty boy.
And naughty boys gotta be punished.
Xxx . we can’t find him so we figured that we took you hostage. It make it easy.
then he just come to us.
It may be distasteful, but you’re gonna stay with us.
Are you scared?
You scared, aren't you?
You are a (?sparky little scape.)
You want me to tell you what kind of bullshit Dallas drag me into?
Blackmail, that's all.
He’s saying we were the ones who killed your father and brother.
Like we kill people.

Eve:
Is that really the truth? Are you the one responsible for killing my father and Geoffery？

Gustavo:
I'm afraid I can't say it.
I don't believe it. There's no way that good-for-nothing father and son team's really related to you.
If they were xxx like you, dollface, then maybe they would have last more than five minutes with me.
Oh, no! That just slipped out!

Eve:
In the end, it won’t be so funny when you find out God punishes people like you!

Gustavo:
God? The law of this world is that the strongest man wins.

Eve:
That's not true!


Eve:
Dallas…

Isaac:
Hey, Miria.

Miria:
What, Isaac?

Isaac:
She is… crying.

Miria:
Crying?

Isaac:
Yeah!
She's looking at a picture and crying.

Miria:
A photograph!

Isaac:
It must be her lover!

Miria:
Oh, romance!

Isaac:
I'll bet they were lovey-dovey.

Miria:
Lovey-dovey!

Isaac:
Perhaps they've been forced to part.

Miria:
It must have been bittersweet farewell!

Isaac:
Or maybe it's death that stands between them.

Miria:
Tragic love!

Eve:
Um--

Isaac, Miria:
Sheee!

Isaac:
How did you know?

Miria:
How could you tell?

Eve:
I could hear you.

Isaac:
What shall we do, Miria?

Miria:
She looks pretty tough.

Isaac:
Do you know what we are? (?Bruno dacks)

Miria:
(?Bruno dacks.)

Isaac:
She is laughing!

Miria:
Laughing!

Isaac:
She was crying just a second ago!

Miria:
She is acting rather strange.

Eve:
You two are just so funny!

Isaac:
We have no choice.

Miria:
No choice, huh?

Isaac:
Tell us everything about your lover!

Miria:
We good listeners.

Isaac:
And advisers.

Isaac, Miria:
We no lie. We tell truth.


Jacuzzi:
So what's the score?

Nice:
There were two lookouts and both of the guys were packing Tommy guns.
But it seems like everybody that we were talking with earlier ain’t around no more.
Isaac, Miria, Chezz, Mary, Mrs Beriam. They’re all just gone.

Jacuzzi:
They are gone?

Nice:
Maybe they were just taking to another car.

Jacuzzi:
Let's find them.
Nice, I want you and Nick to take the roof and head toward the dining car.
You're with me.
Hey, Nice, I'll be coming back, so please be careful.


Isaac, Miria:
Your brother?

Eve:
Yes. You see my brother, Dallas used to always be a very kind person.
But… lately he's been acting rather violent and he hardly ever comes home anymore.

Isaac:
The violent time.

Miria:
Juvenile delinquent.

Isaac:
But why?

Eve:
Well, I think it's because of our money.

Isaac:
Money is a good thing, right?

Miria:
I thought that it was!

Eve:
No, it really isn't.
When you have a lot of money, most people want something other than your friendship.
What they say and what they feel are not the same.
We end up seeing a lot of bad things.
It's probably why my brother…

Isaac:
Sounds like a real pickle.

Miria:
Poor thing.

Isaac:
What should she do?

Miria:
Maybe she should just stop being so rich.

Isaac:
Then she wouldn't have to see bad things anymore!

Miria:
It's so simple!

Isaac:
All right then, excuse us a moment.

Miria:
Excuse us.

Isaac, Miria:
Excuse us.

Isaac:
What on earth just happened here?

Miria:
It's a mystery!

Isaac:
Do you think it was the Rail Tracer?

Miria:
It's a horror!

Isaac:
There's no sign of Jacuzzi

Miria:
What if he's already been eaten?

Isaac:
It's okay; don’t' worry.
Since his body is not here, it must mean that he was swallowed whole by the monster.
Which means he still survives inside its stomach.

Miria:
Swallowed whole?
I'm so happy!

Isaac:
He was swallowed whole?

Miria:
Swallowed?

Isaac:
He's been gobbled up!

Miria:
Then-then are we going to find the hungry monster gobbled him up?

Isaac:
Well, we just have to hope it. (? Whatever xx miserable on this train!)
Then at least we'll still be with Jacuzzi!

Miria:
I can still have him in our hearts forever!

Jacuzzi:
Miria!

Isaac:
He really… was a great guy!

Jacuzzi:
Are you guys all right?

Miria:
We'll be okay. Jacuzzi left a voice.

Jacuzzi:
Hey Isaac! Hey!

Isaac:
You know it's almost like I can hear his sweet vice calling my name right now.
I'll never hear such music!

Jacuzzi:
Thank goodness! Are you both still alive.

Isaac:
We're so happy that you turned up safe, Jacuzzi!

Miria:
So you gotta out of the stomach. Good for you!

Jacuzzi:
Stomach?
Why don't we get out of here and go talk about it in the baggage car?

Isaac:
Sounds good! Let's go!

Isaac:
I finally understand what's going on here.
This train is now like the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. 　[Romance of the Three Kingdoms:三国志演義]

Donny:
What's the Romance?

Jacuzzi:
I don't know what that is?

Isaac:
It's a piece of ancient Chinese historical fiction.
It tells the story of three great worriers who divide their land in a feud.

Jacuzzi:
And?

Isaac:
Their names were Cao Cao, Liu Bei and Hokusai. [Cao Cao, Liu Bei: 曹操、劉備]

Miria:
In ancient artwork, they're often represented by the snake, slug and frog.

Jacuzzi:
A slug?

Isaac:
Jacuzzi, you have to be Billy the Kid!

Miria:
Be him!

Jacuzzi:
Be someone that legendry?

Isaac:
Yes, you can do it!

Miria:
You can do it!

Jacuzzi:
Well, I-Iwas planning on saving all the passengers by taking care of those guys in black suits and Russo's goons, but I'm honestly not that great of a person.
All I do is bootleg liquor and yesterday I ended up killing three people.

Isaac, Miria:
Killing?

Donny:
No! We're the ones who killed them. Jacuzzi, didn't do nothing!

Jacuzzi:
What's the difference, huh? It happened.
The Russos got eight of our friends. Killed them!

Isaac, Miria:
Killed them?

Jacuzzi:
It made me so mad that I went and knocked over eighteen other Russo family's speakos!

Isaac:
Eighteen robberies?

Miria:
That must have taken all month!

Jacuzzi:
No! Just one day!

Isaac, Miria:
Just one day?

Donny:
Jacuzzi was angry as that I’d ever seen before which means he cried a whole lot more than usual.

Jacuzzi:
I wanted to revenge for my friends, but I just made it worse.
More people got killed because I was outta control!
There's no way a guy like me can be some great hero.

Isaac:
Hey! Don't let that get you down, xx!
In the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Cao Cao and Billy the Kid killed thousands millions, billions of guys.
That didn't stop people from thinking they were great guys.
And so the only conclusion is that they must have been great guys!
Well, so then you…

Miria:
You've got to live in the moment.

Isaac:
Right, you are!
You see, Jacuzzi, we think you are a great guy!
And that wave of enthusiasm is all you need to help you ride over those negative thoughts!
Don't miss the wave! Go with the flow, kid!

Miria:
Yeah! All you need to make those waves is just one person who think you're great!
Just one! And you've got two! We know you're great, Jacuzzi!
Who knows you're great? We do! We're making waves for you!

Isaac, Miria:
'Kay?

Jacuzzi:
Thanks you two!

Isaac, Miria
How!
We're taking all of the unhappiness out of your home!

Miria:
Leaving just a piece of xxx behind.

Isaac:
Your brother will be magically transformed.

Miria:
Just like new!

Isaac, Miria:
Chao!

Eve:
Err, w-wait!

Isaac:
Oh, we didn't get your name.

Eve:
It's Eve. It's Eve Genoard.

Isaac:
It's Eve, I'm sure you'll be happy!

Eve:
Well, good bye.

Isaac, Miria:
Bye!

Jacuzzi:
Where're you going?

Isaac:
My friend, we are going to hunt down the Rail Tracer.

Eve:
We're going to ask it very nicely to get off the train.

Jacuzzi:
What if it doesn't listen?

Isaac, Miria:
We'll tan his hide!  [tan one’s hide: 懲らしめる、ぶちのめす]

Jacuzzi:
What if it doesn't work?

Isaac:
Humm…

Isaac, Miria
We'll run away and hide!

Donny:
That monster is real bad. You'll both die.

Isaac:
Don't you worry.　If things get ugly, I'll use my trusty hundred guns.

Jacuzzi:
But you haven't any guns.

Isaac:
How about that!
But you know what? A grizzled old ranch hand asked me once.
“Know where a real cowboy keeps his gun? His heart!”

Miria:
Try not to die. Okay?

Isaac, Miria
Bye!

Jacuzzi:
Well, I'm still not sure either of them is playing with the full deck!
 [not playing with a full deck: 頭が少しおかしい/必要な資質の一部が欠けている]
But I have to admit those two have got way more guts than I do.
Donny, we can't let them show us up.
So, why don’t we become the biggest baddest guys on this train?

Donny:
Yeah, sounds like it could be fun!

Isaac:
That’s the end of that!

Miria:
End of that!

Isaac:
You know this car looks exactly like the one that hit us earlier, doesn't it?

Miria:
Just like it.

Ennis:
Um, actually…

Isaac, Miria:
Uh?

Ennis:
Nothing. Never mind.

Isaac:
By the way, where are you taking those xxx anyway?

Ennis:
Um… to the police.

Isaac:
Oh! Well, then this is good-by.

Miria:
That’s too bad really!

Ennis:
Why is that?

Isaac:
The police have lots of rules.

Miria:
They might arrest us.

Isaac:
Well, if you must know, we are on a journey of sorts in search of self-redemption.

Miria:
We're doing good now to make up for all the badly done!

Ennis:
You’re so strong. The two of you are really strong, huh?

Isaac, Miria:
Huh?

Isaac:
Oh, I’m extremely strong!

Miria:
I’m strong!

Ennis:
I’m too afraid to face the sins of my past
There’s no way I could do it.

Isaac:
What on the earth do you mean?
What could you possibly have done?

Ennis:
Um, well, I…

Isaac:
I don’t care about your xxx past!
But on this day you chose to save our lives!
So you should consider yourself completely redeemed!

Miria:
No matter what bad things you may have done in the past, all you have to do is just one good thing!
It’ll make you thinking that you’re a good person after all

Isaac, Miria:
So you just forget about it, okay?

Ennis:
Uh, thank you.
I have to go now.

Isaac:
It has been a real treat, my lady.
I’m Isaac Dian.

Miria:
I’m Miria Harvent.

Ennis:
I’m Ennis, just Ennis.

Isaac:
You don’t say. No last name.
That’s unusual.

Miria:
We won’t forget that!
Ennis. Ennis, right?

Isaac:
Bye now, Ennis.

Miria:
Bye now!

Isaac:
Hey, see you later!

Miria:
So, see you later, bye-bye!

Ennis:
See you later.

Dallas:
Eve, Eve?

Eve:
Oh, Dallas!

Dallas:
I’m sorry, it’s been so long. Hey, to make up for it, how about I teach you to play billiard tonight or something? Sound good?
I’ll go see.

Eve:
Okay.

Dallas:
Stop the praying, will you?
They’re saying we’ve been robbed, Eve.
That’s just my luck!
I just came home for some spending money, since grandpa had to have left me something.

Eve:
Dallas?

Dallas:
Stop being such a fool!
Only stupid children believe in god!

Miria:
Hey, Isaac, who’s Clare?

Isaac:
Calm now, Miria, you have to know that.
Let’s see. “Carries out the mission”, huh?

Miria:
What’s the matter, Isaac?

Isaac:
Well, with a name like Clare, I xxx she is a female!

Miria:
Incredible!
