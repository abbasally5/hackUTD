  I want you to deal with it. Find Genoard and bring him here.

And the item?

Safe; however, your wife and daughter are aboard the train.

What's a Rail Tracer?

All the people start to disappear. And then, as the empty cars are still rolling down the tracks, the train vanishes!


Worker:
Right! Now swing it around.

Benjamin:
Pardon me, Miss, but you might catch a cold, if you stay out in this damp air for too long.

Eve:
Thank you, Benjamin. But I'll be fine. I…, I want to wait just a little longer, and then I'll go inside.

Worker:
Take that all down!

Benjamin:
Are you sure?

Eve:
Dallas…

Nicholas:
Gentlemen, good afternoon!
I'm Nicholas. I run the English edition desk. Pleasure to meet you.
And you must be …, let's see…, don't tell me, from the Runorata family. Am I right?

Runorada's man:
How'd you know?

Nicholas:
You see. I'm an employee of the Daily Days newspaper.
As an information broker there are very few facts of which we are not aware.

Runorada's man:
Then fact me this, pal.
You ever heard of some punk called Dallas Genoard?

Nicholas:
Of course. Dallas is the prodigal son of the Genoard family, a notorious juvenile who just so happens to be missing.

Runorata's man:
So any idea where he could be?
Tell us and we'll make it worth your while.　[make it worth your while: 礼はする]

Nicholas:
Five hundred.

Runorada's man:
What?

Nicholas:
Five hundred bones and not a penny less.
Plus you gotta pony up one piece of information about yourselves.  [pony up: (決済のために)支払う]

Runorada's man:
You can't grift us.

Nicholas:
But I can, and so what I wanna know about the Runarota family is... (?what's your thing for) Genoard?

Runorada's man:
Why do you wanna know that?

Nicholas:
I'm an information broker. I'm just trying to stay in business.

Runorada's man:
Right, pal.
Let's say we answer your question, what happens if someone wants to buy that information?

Nicholas:
Well, then we sell it to 'em.
That is part of the job description.

Runorada's man:
You think I'm gonna listen to this garbage all day?

Nicholas:
Sorry, the nature of our business, we gotta be prepared for any eventuality.
So you boys wanna tell me what you want with Genoard?

Dallas:
Who is this bruno?

Someone on our turf.

Dallas:
Hey, watch it!

Man:
It there a problem, pal?　Watch what?
Look here. I'm in care of the Runorata family! Know what that means to you ass?
It means a redhot like you can't afford to be flapping your trap at a guy like--

Dallas:
Runarota, huh? Where do you get off talking so big?
You palookas are like crap employees to us!
Sucking up to my pop and brother? Why, huh?
Tell, me, huh? Talk!
So you can exploit them, even though they are the reason you're still around, huh? [be still around :まだ存在している]

Luck:
Enough already. Keep it up, you'll blow him down.

Dallas:
Who the hell are you?

Luck:
Get out of here. This here is Gandor turf, right?
It'd be best not to throw the name ''Runorata'' around here too much.

Dallas:
So what? I don't give a damn if you're Gandor or not.  [not give a damn;気にしない]
Nobody put it to you.
Let's blow.

Berga:
Wonder who the hell those guys were...

Luck:
No one I know.

Ladd:
Well, well, well, well, well, it's almost time for our show to start, isn't it?
Which means it's almost time for their lives to end.
How delightful! How fun!
I'm so excited that I won't be able to sleep tonight.

Lua:
If you enjoy it that much, maybe you should have gone first.

Ladd:
No, I lost the draw. It's no use. I'm just so frustrated, Lua.
It's always been my dream to find those who love life and want to live in this world more than you do and slaughter them one by one until, until there's just you.
And then I would lovingly spend the rest of your life killing you so slowly.

Lua:
But Ladd, you could kill me right here and now; why wait?

Ladd:
What are you talking about? That's absurd.
This world is still overflowing with many many people I have to kill first.
But you already know that, doll.
So killing you won't happen for a very long time.

Lua:
But Ladd …

Ladd:
Until then you stick with me and don’t you dare die. Right, babe?

Ladd's man
Lil' Vicky is really champing at the bit.　　　[champ at the bit :うずうずする、落ち着かない]

Ladd:
Damn it! I envy Vicky! I really do! I really do!
There is no god in this cruel cruel world anymore!
Vicky went and killed them earlier! I just know it!

Lua:
Why don't you just go see what's going on?

Ladd:
Yeah, that's exactly what I should do!
I am such an idiot. There's no reason for me to wait in here now, is there?
And here I was thinking I had to behave myself.
I'll be back!
Watch where you are going, will ya?

Jacuzzi:
I'm very sorry! I really didn't mean to …, you see everyone here is in great danger!
So I need to find the conductor, because I think he can help.
Er, sorry, I gotta go!

Ladd:
Wasn't that…? It's gotta be…
This just got a little more interesting.
Lua, why don't you take my good friend here and go to the conductor's compartment to see what's going on?
Also, if you happen to see a kid with a tattoo on his face in there, snatch him for me, will you?
Interesting. There's something very interesting happening on this train and I wonder exactly what sort of trouble that little tattoo kid was talking about.
This is looking bad. If I don't cut loose pretty soon, I'm probably gonna bust.

Pecho:
Eh, stop that! You're gonna burn your hand off.

Randy:
Nah. It'll be fine. See?

Pecho:
Wow! Randy, that's amazing!

Randy:
Ain't it (so?/??doll?) I'm gonna use it to entertain at the party and I'm sure Firo will get a kick out of it too.
Hey! (?Pecho), what are you doing?

Pecho:
I bet I can do it.

Randy:
No, you boob! You're using the wrong kind of gloves!
Those ones are made out of cotton!

Pecho:
Hot! Hot! Why ain't it going out?!

Randy:
Just calm down!
Just... This is why I used leather gloves! Now take that damn thing off, get it off!

Pecho:
Ow, ow, hot!

Randy:
You alright, pal?

Pecho:
Damn! For a minute there I thought I was gonna die.

Randy:
Do you think I'm dumb enough to light my hand on fire if it was (?gonna high/gone out of height)?

Pecho:
That was silly, huh? *laughs*

Barnes:
I've done it! The formula is finally perfected!
Damn it,no! Why now?

Samantha:
All right, Miss Eve, I think this is the place.
My friend is the information broker. He is a really nice fellow.

Benjamin:
Aren't the Daily Days' the ones who print the newspaper?
Well, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to put a little bit of faith in these people.

Samantha:
You go on in there and ask them about Master Dallas. They'll be able to tell ya.

Nicholas:
Have a good day!
Welcome! What brings you in here today, young lady?

Firo:
Amazing! What do you think, Maiza? Ain't this joint amazing?  [joint 俗:建物、住居]

Maiza:
The Martillo Family capos have always bought their hats here, for generations, it seems.
I bought mine here as well.

Firo:
A capo. It still doesn't seem really it.

Maiza:
Oh, relax. It'll start to feel real once you become one.

Firo:
Are you sure it's okay for me to do this?

Maiza:
It's okay, because it's who you are. Now look.

Firo:
I think I really like this one, Maiza. It's perfect for me.

Maiza:
Welcome to the Matello Family, Firo, and the Camorra.

Firo:
Thank you, but... isn't it still a day too soon for that?

Maiza:
Actually the ceremony's already started. Right, pal?

Maiza:
Excuse me.

Isaac:
For carelessness, there is no excuse.

Miria:
No excuse for carelessness!

Firo:
Looks like there's something going on over there.
I think I'm gonna go check it out.

Maiza:
Firo, nobody likes a rubbernecker!

Firo:
I'm just gonna see if they need help!

Ennis:
Are you all right, sir?

Firo:
Yeah…

Ennis:
I'm terribly sorry about that.
Excuse me. I've got to go. I'm looking for someone.

Firo:
Hey, wait! Lady, wait up!

Nick:
Whoa!

Donny:
Where're you running to, Jacuzzi? Looks like the Devil's chasing you.

Jacuzzi:
This is terrible; everybody on this train is about to die!
I have to come! I have to find the young conductor!

Donny:
Why?

Nice:
Oh, there you are!

Donny:
Hey, Nice, what's up?

Nice:
You've seen Jacuzzi?

Nick:
Yeah, he went that way, screaming abut the conductor.

Nice:
Donny, I need you to come with me, okay?
Now, we're gonna have to check out the fright hold on our way to bring Jacuzzi back here. You got that?
Nick, while we are doing that, you take care of the dining car.

Nick:
Hold on. I don't understand. What am I supposed to do with the dining car?

Nice:
Nick, while we are doing that, you take care of the dinning car.

Nick:
Hmm, maybe what she really meant was …

Nice:
Nick, listen.
While Donny and I are checking on the freight hold, you go to the dining car and make sure that everyone's okay.

Nick:
Hmm, I guess that's possible, but maybe she means…

Nice:
When we're doing the robbing, we can't have people knowing.　
If they find out about it, they're likely to cause a scene and they may go so far as to stop the train, which is why, Nick, I need you to keep the people in the dining car quiet. You got it? [cause a scene:騒ぐ] [go so far as to: ～しさえする]

Nick:
I got it, boss. Nice and quiet.

Goose:
Gentlemen, we've gathered here today to begin the rescue of Master Huey.

Elean:
Samantha!

Samantha:
Elean! Good to see you!

Elean:
Oh, been so long, too long!

Elean:
Yeah, that's Dallas Genoard.

Eve:
Does that mean you know my brother?

Elean:
Don't you know who I am? Just where do you think you are, kid?
He's that famous Genoard's son, who turned out missing one year ago.
Who's the biggest delinquent of out time?
Dallas Genoard. Sucks up to the mighty and bullies the weak, detested by all.
He's the biggest scumbag around!

Eve:
Well, my brother was always very kind to me.

Elean:
Um, I'm sorry. It just slipped out. Please accept my apology, miss.
Sometimes it just happens.
But I promise you we're gonna find him, alright?
I'm sure he's fine, so don't worry yourself, 'kay?
Finally! Where have you been? Can't you see our guests are waiting?
You should have been here an hour ago!
Thank you, sir.
Give me just one minute, okay? I need to skim this over real quick.

Eve:
What's wrong? What's it say?
Dallas! Does that letter have any news about where my brother is?
Is there anything at all?

Elean:
Uｈ, I'm terribly sorry, but… we--we haven't found him, well, not yet anyway.
Even going through our most reliable information sources, we still can't seem to get a single lead on it.
I'm terribly sorry about this, but I'm afraid it's still a mystery.

Dallas:
What's the deal, gramps?
Is the box that important to you?

Man:
Come on! Show us what's inside, gramps, huh?

Dallas:
Whoa!
See what happens when you're stingy like that?
Huh? You're determined, ain't ya?
What are you looking at, nancy?

Firo:
Who? Me?
Oh, I was just standing by to see if you're actually gonna rob the old guy, wondering if you even have the skills to do it.

Dallas:
Ha! Why don't you blow, kid?
Scurry on home to your mother and give her good suck for me.

Firo:
I assume you're calling me kid, which is funny, 'cause watching you jerks I started missing the sand box.

Man:
You dirty brat! I guess you came over here looking for a beating, huh?

Firo:
That's not true and I'm not a dirty brat. Name's Firo Prochainezo.
I also happen to be one of the youngest members of the Martillo Family.

Men:
Yeah, well. So what?
Why, you little punk!

Firo:
Ah, come on. You can't go pulling out a weapon in a fight like this.

Dallas:
Shut up!

Firo:
Hey, pal, you hurt?
Now, honestly, was that box really worth it?

Barnes:
Back off! This has nothing to do with your kind, kid. Do you follow what I'm saying?
If money is what you want, I'll give it to you.
If not, then hit the bricks.

Firo:
You owe me more than money, mister. I saved your life.
Relax. I'm joking.
But hey listen up. Can I ask you a quick question?
I'm actually looking for someone.
Have you seen a girl wearing a thin black suit around here?

Barnes:
No, I haven't. Is there anything else?

Firo:
That's all.
You and your box should probably hurry on home, while these ginks are still licking pavement, okay?

Dallas:
Firo…

Isaac:
My goodness, I'm completely stuffed.

Miria:
Nonsense! There's always room for dessert.

Vicky:
Bang!
Well, guess I should get started.

Nick:
Alright, here comes the action!

Black suits
Everyone, down on the floor right now!

Vicky:
Hands in the air! All of you!

Nick:
Everybody freeze and whatever you do, don't move!

man:
Ah, but which one should we do?

Issac:
Okay, so...

Miria:
Yeah, what is it, Isaac?

Isaac:
Well, we are on the floor and our hands are up. So what now?

Miria:
Don't move! Right?

Isaac:
Oh, yeah, right.

Nick:
I'm… sorry for the confusion.

Barnes:
It's you.

Ennis:
Mr. Barnes …

Jacuzzi:
It's here. I'm too late. It's-it's already taken us over. The Rail Tracer!


Preview:

Miria:
Do you know the word ''slaughter'' can also be a person's last name?

Isaac:
But what if that person doesn't have violent blood in them?

Miria:
Maybe their name makes them violent.

Isaac:
So, if I name myself "Isaac Greenback", then I can be rich.

Miria:
And I'll be rich too.

Isaac:
No! You have to get your own name!

Miria:
How about Miria Moneybags?

Isaac:
Yes! Brilliant!
