Nicholas:
I see. So it arrived without incident?

Man:
Well, it seems it wasn't entirely without incident.

Nicholas:
What do you mean by that?

Man:
The Flying Pussyfoot switched out more than just its engine; it's switched out its passenger cars as well.

Nicholas:
Has there been any reason given for the switch?

Man:
Nothing official.
Nebula is being very tight-lipped the situation, but there isn't any question there was a very serious incident.
But for the whole picture, that still remains unclear.
Apparently many of the passengers are dead.

Nicholas:
If I remember correctly, wasn't Rachel aboard Flying Pussyfoot?

Man:
Yes sir.

Nicholas:
Let's wait until she's giving us a full report.
What’d she see? Did she talk to anyone and what other things does she know?

Man:
It appears that the young lady has arrived.

President:
Rachel, it's good to have you back.
I must admit I've been a little worried because there's been nothing but bad news coning in regarding the Flying Pussyfoot.
As president of the Daily Days I am honored to have employees like you.

Rachel:
Thank you, sir. I appreciate that.

Nicholas:
So, you had your another free ride. Rachel?

Rachel:
I certainly did. Is that a problem for you?

President:
Nicholas, Judging by Rachel's injure condition, I should think you would have the common sense to know this is no time for jokes.

Nicholas:
Please excuse me. I'm not very funny.

President:
Now that, Rachel, normally I would give someone in your position time to recuperate before the briefing, but we are in the business of information.
So, I'm afraid I'll have to dispense with the formalities.
What happened aboard that train?

Rachel:
I'm not sure I know much.
The only things I do know happened right in front of my eyes, sir.

President:
That's perfectly fine.
Do you know anything about the two factions on the train? Those in the white suits or black suits.

Rachel:
Well, sir, it appears that you might already know more than I do.

President:
Do you know anything about this Rail Tracer?

Rachel:
Rail Tracer?

Jacuzzi:
Wh,what's the Rail Tracer?

Isaac:
Calm now. I can't believe you've never heard of it.
What the Rail Tracer is, Jacuzzi.

Rachel:
I remember some of the passengers in the dinning car talking about it.

President:
It's a legendry monster that traces the shadows of the railways.

Rachel:
A monster?

President:
Yes, a monster.

Rachel:
Well, sir, I don't know if I can say that all of the stories are true.
But there was a monster there, riding aboard the Flying Pussyfoot.
I saw it, a brutal crimson monster.

Ladd:
Wow, would you look at this? It's unbelievable!
Oh, my God! Why is there so much blood?
Should we call it strange, or it's inspiring better?
What kind of thing can make such a beautiful mess?
Wait! Hold on a second!
Could it be? Is this gentleman here without a face the guy we call Dune?
Do you know what this means?
Our pal is telling us that we are now the hunted.
Come on, Dune, tell us who did this to you right now!
How were we to avenge our friend if he can't talk, much less find his own face?
Oh, Dune, you, poor poor faceless bastard.
Your brothers even do not do simple act of vengeance!

Elder conductor:
So, now back to your question, how can you be spared?
Thing is, everyone who hears this story dies.
So, I'm sorry to have to break it to you like this, kid.
There is no way to be spared.

Young conductor:
You just have to kill it, before it kills you.

Elder conductor:
Now hold on! W-wait a minute!

Young conductor:
It's too late,
Well, now, I guess it's only fair that I finish, huh?
The best way to keep the Rail Tracer from showing up is to believe the story when someone tells it to you.
If it's already here, your only hope is to keep running until the morning sun rises.
But it's too late for you.
The Rail Tracer is certain now to show up for all the people of this train.
You’re sacrifice for surely awakening it.
It's time for you to die!

Dune:
What's going on?

Young conductor:
Who are you?

Dune:
Hey, would you hold on just a second, buddy!
I ain't done nothing to nobody. Got it?

Young conductor:
There were only two conductors who were scheduled to be aboard this train tonight.
So, who does that make you?

Dune:
Okay, maybe you could put that thing down. We can talk this out!

Young conductor:
Why are you so relaxed when I got a gun point at in your face?
Who the hell are you?
What’re you really after? [What are after?: 何をたくらんでいる？]

Dune:
That was quick! The secret's out already!
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

Young conductor:
You don't seem to be the type who'll talk after the usual encouragements.
I can see this will take something more.

Dune:
Hold on, pal! You mean torture?
You never get reliable information I should know!
You know it was nice of you to drop your gun and even things up like that. [even things up: 対等にする]
But I'm afraid I just can’t return a favor.

Young conductor:
I'll try one more time! Tell me who you are!
That's too bad,
I'm gonna ask you again. Who are you?

Dune:
D-d-dune.

Young conductor:
What are you doing on this train?

Ladd:
I cannot wait to meet the genius responsible for this masterpiece!
I hope it's someone incredibly handsome and just a little bit fat and absolutely certain that never be killed!
Because, then, there’s me! I’ll tap-dance on their heads like I’m goddamn Bojangles!
[Bojangles: Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, アメリカのタップダンサー、俳優] 

Young conductor:
Now Dune, friend of the Russo family, I know what your buddies’ little plan is.
So just one more question!
Why the hell are you dressed up like a conductor?

Dune:
I like, I like… I like how it feels! It's fine… killing is fun!

Young conductor:
Is that your reason? You're just killing for the fun of it, huh?
Where did you get the uniform then?
Dune:
Xxx some old man! I met him at the station!

Young conductor:
Some old man? What did you do?

Dune:
I killed him! I killed him! It was so much fun!

Young conductor:
You should know that old conductor's name was Tony!
He told me everything I know about being a conductor!

Ladd:
Alright, you guys. I don’t exactly know what's going on here.
But I'm gonna kill whoever do this and those damn black suits.
So go hide, 'kay?

Lua,,my precious angel, now don’t you forget I’m the one who’s gonna kill you when all this is over, dollface!

Young conductor:
Lemures, the Russo family, how amusing!
I’m the monster who’s gonna devour you all!
It’s begun!
It’s too late now! There’s no going back!
I have become the Rail Tracer！

President:
A conductor?
Rachel:
That’s correct, sir.
It appeared to me wearing a conductor’s uniform.

President:
Interesting! Did this monster speak to you?
Your ticket, Please

Nicholas:
Ahem, excuse me.

Rachel:
I think it must have known somehow that I boarded the train without a ticket.

President:
Indeed. There doesn’t seem to be any question then.
That conductor was Vino.

Nicholas:
But how can you be so sure this monster was Vino?

President:
What [xx] makes Vino such a feared and elusive monster?
It’s the fact that he will appear in one city and then not long after show up in another random city far away, then inexplicably another.
How does he manage to cover so much ground?
If he were a conductor of the transcontinental express, it would be possible.

Nicholas:
That has certainly explained why he’s so elusive.

President:
Likewise it would explain why he’s been spotted in cities across the country.

Rachel:
This Vino, I think I may have heard of him.

President:
Vino, also known as Clare Stanfield was practically raised by the father of the Gandor family.
While growing up next to the Gandors, Clare was orphaned and subsequently taken in by the family.
That’s why Luck, Keith and Berge think of him as the forth brother.

Nicholas:
Xx that he ran away with the circus.

President:
That’s true.
While in the circus, his determination led him to gain strength and agility that have beyond the any that have seen before.
The skills that must be of use now that he’s an assassin.

White suits:
Hey, now would you pipe down already.
You and Ladd maybe perfectly fine with just offing a bunch of people.
But I got the more refined habits.

President:
Vino was known for the messy he leaves behind when he makes a kill.
He completely destroys the bodies he attacks.
Leaving them as if they’d been soaked in wine.
It seems to be his way of assuring that he has not left the job undone.
Were you able to confirm that he made contact with the Gandors?

Nicholas:
Yes, sir.

Firo:
What happened?
You look like hell ran you over. Easy!

Isaac:
You live long enough and someday I'll tell you the story.
Good to see you!

Messenger:
Excuse me, but could you happen to be Mr. Luck Gandor?

Luck:
Yes, I am.

Messenger:
I have a telegram for you.
Luck:
Thank you very much.
[?You are right.]

Berga:
How is it going, Clare?
Should know you, conductors be working inside or something?

Vino:
I’m no longer Clare, nor am I a conductor.

Luck:
Heh, then what do you want us to call you?
You can call me Vino, now, or if you like, the Rail Tracer.

Berga:
You gotta be kidding!

Vino:
Enough talk. Let’s get going. Who do you want me to kill?
Last night was a walk in the park. [walk in the park: 朝飯前のこと]
I want some real excise so I don’t get out the shape.
Let’s try to be quick about this.
I got someone I gotta track down later, and if I’m lucky, you guys might just be coming my wedding soon.

Rachel:
But why would he do that?
Why would Vino choose to kill so many people without any reason at all?

President:
His killing’s been appeared to have no connection to realty.
But he operates on what others have reported as his own scene of justice. 
However warped that may be.

Rachel:
But still what reason could he possibly have for killing a child?

President:
What child was this?

Rachel:
It was a young boy. I guess about ten years old.

President:
I see. Perhaps one day you’ll be able to ask that question to the boy himself.

Rachel:
The boy? How is that?

President:
Now, Rachel, there’s much more information I’d like to hear about your journey. 
For example, we still don’t know the about story behind that injury of yours.
