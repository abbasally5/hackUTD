President:
So you were under duress?　　　　　 　[under duress: 強要されて、無理に]

Nicholas:
Sir, Gustavo Baggetta is a man of unbelievable strength.
I was sure I was gonna die.
But I can't make any excuses for what just happened.

Elean:
I specifically warned you not to say anything that would put Eve in danger!

Nicholas:
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
But there was nothing else I could do.

President:
I have to agree with Elean.
Even with Gustavo threatening to do bodily harm, there was no excuse to use that sweet girl in such a way.

Elean:
Mm-hm

President:
Nicholas, the responsibility in this matter falls squarely on your shoulders.

Elean:
Mm-hm

President:
You must try to be more careful. Understood?

Elean:
Mm-hm

Nicholas:
Absolutely, sir.

Elean:
Mm-hm

Nicholas:
Any word?

Man:
Not so far. They don't appear to have moved yet.

Nicholas:
Notify me the moment there is any movement, okay?
Gustavo and the Gandores fight over Dallas maybe a good thing for us.
Who knows what little bits of information might now pop up?
Tell me what you learn.　Keep a lid on what you hear.

Man:
I understand.

Black suits:
I need backup! Send it freight hold now! Now, send it now!

Spike:
Spike here. What's going on?

Black suits:
They're gone! They're both gone! Send me backup now!
I need backup now!

Spike:
Calm down! What happened? What happened?

Black suits:
Stop! Stay back! No! Get away!

Woman in fatigues
What is--

Luck:
I don't think so.
What obligation do you think we have that we must help you carry out this retaliation?

Dallas:
Well…, you telling me that punk, Firo ,that outsider can just have his run of the place?

Luck:
Only members of our family may concern themselves with our business affairs.
You are not family.

Dallas:
Well, how about this arrangement?
You agree to help us out with the little bit of pest control, and we agree to join your organization.
That's a solid deal, isn't it?

Luck:
I don't know, Dallas.
Tell me honestly. Haven’t you ever been the least bit curious as to why we've never reached out to you?
It begs the question, doesn't it?
You may be mistaking in your impressions about the gracious blind eye we have turned to your way.
I just hope you aren't so foolish as to think it is because we are afraid of you and your impudent conduct.
Let me speak plainly.
You haven't been invited to join us because you're now with the trouble that your business would bring upon our organization.
You have drawn considerable attention from the police[? for with all the muggings you feed necessary] for you and your little friends there.
That is the source of our disinterest.
If we need muscle, they have a plenty of gorillas at the Bronx Zoo.

Dallas:
You don't know a goddamn thing about me.

Luck:
I know you have trouble defending yourself against teenagers.
(?I don’t want to be just not at you.)

Berga:
Now Luck, who are these runts with no manners?

Luck:
Nobody you know.
Well, what'd we have here?

Berga:
Giggle juice?  [giggle juice: 酒]

Luck:
Beats me.

Czeslaw:
Okay, Mary, and you go.
There'll be enough room for you in there. Don’t worry.

Mary:
But Chess, what about you?

Czeslaw:
I'm gonna go back and check out what's happening.
Now you have to try to stay hiding in here
Just keep you really quiet and you'll be fine.
I promise I'll be right back, okay?
Oh, that takes care of tagalong.
Now I gotta find that immortal.

Nick:
Jacuzzi?

Jacuzzi:
Nick, you're alright!

Nick:
Sorry, I messed up.

Nice:
Nick, where did the lookouts go?

Nick:
I really don't know where they went off to.

Ladd:
Thank you! Fuck you! The star is here! What? No guards?
Now what kind of fun is there?
Lure, my angel, are you all right? I was worried sick about you!

White suits:
She' okay.

Nick:
Hey, pal, aren’t you gonna untie me too?

Ladd:
Huh? Why? Is there something in it for me?　[Is there something in it for me? :それは俺とってなにか利益になるのか？]
If you were a woman, I could get a kiss.
But you're a man, aren’t you?
So,instead how about you die like this.
That's right. It's your fate to die like this.

Jacuzzi:
Do you have any idea who he is?

Nick:
No.
Um…Jacuzzi

White suits:
Found you!
Oh, com' on! Just not screaming aloud!
Young pretty girls are specialty of mine!
I'm just not fool like Ladd!
I only like to play with things that are weaker than me!

Nick:
It's them, those of the guys!

Ladd:
Well, I guess you got some friends after all. Jacuzzi Splot!

Jacuzzi:
What? Do you-how-how do you know what my name is?

Ladd:
Whoops, now where have I placed my manners?
I am Ladd Russo, and that should have you understand how I know so much about you.

Jacuzzi:
Russo! You're one of the Russos?

Ladd:
Now to what do I owe the pleasure of your company on this train, my little friend?
And just who the hell do you think you are, anyway?
Now very soon this train is gonna be completely under my control.
We'll kill half the passengers, or maybe we'll get to kill 'em all.
If you don't fancy being killed by us, you can always jump off and die.

Jacuzzi:
So, you're the one responsible for killing the conductor!

Ladd:
He's dead? What a tragedy! Let's go see the dead conductor.
You know, it really is a shame that we don't have time for a funny game with you right now.

Jacuzzi:
Yeah. Our dance card is full too.　 [dance card is full: 予定がいっぱいだ]
But I'm sure we'll find time for each other later on!

Ladd:
Oh? You are so tough! You're not crying now, kid?
We didn't kill the conductor. And what's more we're responsible for the little mess in that room neither.

Nick:
You just gonna let him go?

Jacuzzi:
For now. There's something else we have to take care of first.

Isaac:
Next time I see that hit-and-run bastard, it is gonna be brutal!

Miria:
Brutal…

Isaac:
I'll punch his car!

Miria:
But you'll break your hand!

Isaac:
Yes. Well, then, I'll hit the driver!

Miria:
But how will you get him out?

Isaac:
Aa… Aha! I'll spit on his car!

Miria:
That's perfect!

Man:
So, what are we gonna do, Dallas?
It seems like we can't really take on the Gandors--

Dallas:
Shut your trap!
Damn,that Firo! He's a goddamn nobody!
You watch! Soon we'll take care of him and the Gandors!
They can't treat me like some jerk!

Man:
Don't worry about it. Your family still has a plenty of cush to back you up, right?　[cush: money]
They'll always be xxx some to you well, won't they?

Dallas:
Unfortunately they said everything that they had got taken by some (?shopper) last month.

Men:
Hey, it's sad irony.
You got food for your belly though?
There's always that cute sister of yours.

Dallas:
If you go near Eve, I will personally make sure you suffer for it!

Man:
All right. I-I get it.


Isaac:
And now, my dear, our final performance!

Miria:
It can't go on further!

Isaac:
We started our adventures as the thieves of time itself.

Miria:
When we stole the watches, right?

Isaac:
I will admit that we may have bit off more than we can chew, trying to steal that whole museum.

Miria:
Yeah, that was impossible.

Isaac:
The next best thing was keeping everyone else out…by stealing the entrance.

Miria:
Jeez! That was heavy!

Isaac:
(?Our turn towards the rights and deeds of goodness was only steal that rich man's financial legacy.)

Miria:
Now his xx kid will have nothing to fight about!

Isaac:
I can feel that gratitude even as we speak.
And so since doing good deeds also feel so good, let's be good guys for our final caper.

Miria:
But how, Isaac?

Isaac:
Oh, well, by stealing the Mafia's money, my dear!

Miria:
Oh, wow, that's incredible idea!

Isaac:
Hey, now, watch yourself!

Miria:
Watch yourself!

Dallas:
What did you say?

Gustavo:
That's Eve Genoard, correct?

Sugarcube:
So it seems.

Gustavo:
Call her down.

Sugarcube:
How'd I do that?

Gustavo:
That's something I [xx] under your problem.

Sugarcube:
Do you want some?

Gustavo:
No!

Sugarcube:
Well, that's too bad.

Samantha:
Yes, Genoard residence.

Eve:
From the newspaper?

Samantha:
Yeah, they got something they want to say to you, Miss!
They said it's got something to do with Master Dallas.

Eve:
Did they really?

Samantha:
Yeah, they're saying they got some new information on Master Dallas or something.
Thing is, they say it can't be over the phone thing because they got to tell you in person, or they can't say it.

Eve:
Then we have to go; please fetch me my coat.

Nice:
Jacucuzi…
How did that much blood get all the way up there?

Nick:
Hey, guys, I think there's something crawling around up there.
Okay, let's. I'll take a look on "go".

Nice:
Okay.

Nick:
Aaaa.. Go!

Jacuzzi:
I think that's… that's the Rail Tracer!


Dallas:
You gotta learn how to control that bod, pal!
Everyone around here can't just run into people excepting nothing to happen!

Man:
Some kid of problem, dollface?

Dallas:
I-I let them go! (?There's no problem), lady!

Ennis:
I'm afraid that they don't concern me. My problem's with you.

Isaac:
Amazing! You beat them all!

Miria, Isaac:
Wow, we thank you!

Isaac:
We're total strangers, but you came to our rescue!
Dollface, we owe you our lives!

"Szilard":
You should be more careful. What’s wrong with you?

"Ennis":
I’m terribly sorry, sir. They came out of nowhere and I couldn't stop in time.

Isaac:
Ask us for anything!

Miria:
We will do anything for you!

Ennis;
There is one thing. Would you two mind to help me carry these gentlemen back to my car?

President:
Miss Eve's been kidnapped?

Nicholas:
Yes sir, I just received word a few minutes ago.　[receive word:知らせをうける]

Elean:
I told you so! Now what are you gonna do about it, huh?

President:
Gustavo is most likely not going to do anything to her right away.
Elean, calm dawn!

Elean:
But sir!

President:
My only concern is that the company not be responsible for instigating conflict between the Gandors and the Runoratas
I assume you have a [xx] for that ,Nichols .

Nicholas:
Sir, I will do everything in my power to ensure that doesn't happen.

President:
See that you do. Now go.

Elean:
Sir, I can tell from his face that he's got something ribbed up.

President:
I know. My guess is that he is probably driving the two families to the brink of all-out war that see if he can uncover any dirt on them.
I'm sure he's looking for clandestine secrets that have never been revealed.


Elean:
You are saying that we should let him do it?

President:
There's much about Dallas Genoard that is still unclear.
Hidden secrets notwithstanding. Is he really immortal?
Sometimes it takes a little gap like this to bring a little clarity, right?
What's more, it won't necessary be us that raises the [xxx] conflict between the Gandors and the Runoratas.

Elean:
What do you mean?

President:
I have the information that the assassin Vino, A. K. A. Clare Stanfield to set toward New York at the behest of no other than Luck Gandor.

Elean:
Vino…

President:
Traveling on the transcontinental express out of Chicago, the Flying Pussyfoot.

Szilard:
Not much information's being from this one, even if I were to devour him.
But I brought it on myself.
Ennis!

Isaac:
Miria, everything's about to start!

Miria:
Wow, the real beginning?

Isaac:
Um, "Ad-wee-na…"

Miria:
It's "Ad-ve-nna."

Isaac:
Oh, right! " Ad-wee-na…　Avasin...

Miria:
Aa…, I still don't think that's right.

Isaac:
Yeah, yes, yeah…A-weh-nass… Ad-naa?
