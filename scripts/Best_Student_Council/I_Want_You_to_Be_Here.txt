  Rino:
Dear Mr. Poppit.
It's been a while since the last time I wrote you.
I have some exciting news: I became a ninja today.
I can't wait till I can throw Chinese stars and use smoke bombs to disappear!
You're probably totally lost and have no idea what I'm talking about, huh?
Well, let me try to explain...

Seina:
Rino! Minamo!
I was wondering if you two would be interested in helping out the Best Student Council's Covert Squad.

Rino, Minamo:
Yeah!

Rino, Minamo:
Hi! We're here to help you, Kotoha!

Kotoha:
Oh, no...

Rino:
So that's how it happened.
But all of a sudden...

Kotoha:
Thank you, but I do not need your help.

Pucchan:
Aw, man! Where'd she go?
She was just here!

Rino:
Awesome!

Minamo:
She's so cool!

Nanaho:
Hey, you guys!
You know you just got left behind, right?


Kotoha:
What was she thinking?
Why would Seina reveal my identity to those two?
This is gonna cause major problems for the Covert Squad...

Rino, Minamo:
Miss Kotoha Kutsugi!

Rino:
Hello, Miss Kotoha!

Minamo:
Kotoha!

Rino:
Hey, Kotoha! Over here!

Girl:
Hey, wait. That's the student council's secretary.

Girl:
Her name's Rino, isn't it?

Girl:
I wanna know why she's dressed up like a ninja.

Rino, Minamo:
Kotoha!

Minamo:
Guess what? The Covert Squa-

Kotoha:
What a nightmare...


Kotoha:
What's the matter with you two?

Rino:
Nothing.
Like we told you before, we were asked to help the Covert Squad.

Minamo:
It sounded exciting, so we accepted!

Rino, Minamo:
Yeah!

Kotoha:
How many times do I have to tell you I don't need your help?

Rino:
Aw, don't say that!

Minamo:
Fine then! I'm gonna tell the entire school about you!
Tell them you're a member of the Covert-

Kotoha:
I need your help!

Rino, Minamo:
Yay!

Rino:
So, what can we do? Any orders?

Kotoha:
Well, let's see...
First of all, take off those ridiculous outfits.

Rino, Minamo:
Okay!

Kotoha:
Okay. Now I want you to go back to your classrooms.

Minamo:
And then what?

Kotoha:
That's all.

Rino:
But I don't understand!
How is that gonna help you?

Kotoha:
Trust me, that's the best thing you could do to help me.

Minamo:
Ahem!
Listen up! 9th grader, Kotoha Kutsugi, has a secret!
She is a member of the student council's Covert-

Kotoha:
I have a secret mission for you!

Minamo:
Rino, "a secret mission!"

Rino:
Awesome!
I can't wait to go back to the dorm and tell Miss Kanade all about it!

Kotoha:
You're supposed to keep it a secret!

Rino:
Oh, sorry.

Pucchan:
Listen, Covert cutie, you're wasting your breath reasoning with them.
Your best bet here is to stop struggling and play dead.

Rino, Minamo:
Yay, yay, we're super ninjas!

Kotoha:
What a nightmare...


Kotoha:
This is Mayumi Minegishi.
She's scheduled to transfer to Miyagami Academy in three days.
She is our target for this mission.

Minamo:
Question! So did this Mayumi girl do something wrong?

Kotoha:
We've been monitoring her activities before the transfer.
On several occasions a young man was seen leaving her apartment.
This is troubling because she is supposed to be living alone.
Our mission today is to verify the authenticity of these reports.

Rino:
Minamo, what do you think she's doing with that guy?

Minamo:
Sounds like hinky-pinky.

Rino:
But what are they doing when they're all alone together?

Minamo:
Bet you they get all kissy-face and stuff!

Rino:
No! Not that!

Pucchan:
You idiots! I know you're not that dumb!
There's gotta be a lot more going on than kissy-face!
They're probably in there practicing their wrestling and playing rumble in the jungle as we speak!

Rino:
That sounds like fun! We should play!

Kotoha:
Stop daydreaming and focus!

Pucchan:
Sorry about that.

Kotoha:
I'm going to start monitoring Miss Minegishi now.

Rino, Minamo:
I wanna help!

Kotoha:
So you're really serious about this.

Minamo:
Well, of course I am!
I don't wanna just sit back and watch the action, I wanna be a part of it!

Rino:
Minamo, that's not the point.
Come on, Kotoha, let's go keep a close watch on Mayumi's apartment!
That way, we'll be able to prove her innocence.

Kotoha:
Prove her innocence?

Rino:
That's our job, isn't it?

Kotoha:
Uh, yeah, I guess you're right.
Let's prepare for a stakeout.
I want you to meet me in front of Miyagami station in exactly two hours.

Rino, Minamo:
You got it, Kotoha!


Kotoha:
I didn't find anything suspicious in Mayumi's academic records...
But there's something about her that has me worried, I just can't figure out what.
Kuon Ginga...

Kuon:
Kotoha.
Seina told me about your current assignment.
I understand you're running a background check on a possible transfer student.
Thank you for taking care of that.

Kotoha:
Just so you know, I no longer consider you to be the leader of the Covert Squad.
I act only under orders of the Best Student Council.

Kuon:
Please Kotoha, wait!

Seina:
Oh my...


Kotoha:
It's five minutes after...

Rino:
Sorry I'm late!

Kotoha:
What are you wearing?

Rino:
I thought I should dress up for our stakeout!
Detective Rando reporting!

Kotoha:
So you think you're a detective?

Rino:
My card, ma'am.

Kotoha:
I don't want it.

Minamo:
Sorry I'm late!
Having... hairdressing... took forever!

Rino:
You look so cute, Minamo!

Minamo:
Huh?
At ease, Officer Rino!

Kotoha:
I thought I made it clear that we're going on a stakeout, so why are you wearing such a frilly outfit?

Minamo:
What are you talking about?
A young lady should always look her best whenever she leaves the house!
That's a basic rule of being a girl!

Kotoha:
Do you understand-

Minamo:
What did you bring, Rino?

Rino:
I didn't want us to get hungry while we were working, so I asked Maachi to make us something yummy for lunch!

Minamo:
You're the greatest!
I brought some video games to help pass the time!

Rino:
So cool! That way, we'll never get bored while we're staking out!
That's my Minamo!

Minamo:
Let me see what's in there... Oh, wow!

Kotoha:
What a nightmare...

Rino:
What games did you bring?


Kotoha:
She just got home.
Doesn't look like there's anyone else inside the apartment.

Rino:
Hey, Kotoha. Can we get some food?
I'm hungry...

Kotoha:
You just ate a little while ago!

Minamo:
This stakeout is so boring!
I've already played all my games!

Kotoha:
Then go home!

Pucchan:
Sounds good to me!
I hereby decree that Mayumi Minegishi is innocent!
Now let's get outta here!

Kotoha:
Don't tell me what to do.

Minamo:
I didn't know that the Cover Squad's duties were so boring!
But it figures, its members even look boring!

Rino:
What? You really think so?
Well, I happened to think that Kotoha was very pretty.

Kotoha:
That's enough.

Minamo:
Well, she does have some nice features...

Rino:
Told ya!

Kotoha:
Would you two cut it out?

Minamo:
But you can't tell how pretty a girl is until she smiles.
And Kotoha is always frowning and depressed-looking.

Kotoha:
The Covert Squad doesn't require me to smile.
As long as I can carry out my missions, I don't need to smile.

Minamo:
That's kinda depressing!

Kotoha:
It's fine by me.

Rino:
Um, hey, Kotoha. Can I ask you something?

Kotoha:
What?

Rino:
Why did you become a member of the Covert Squad?

Kotoha:
Because I thought it was the one place where I could use my abilities to their full potential.
And...

Rino:
And what?

Kotoha:
Never mind.

Rino:
So, you chose to be a member of the Covert Squad all by yourself?

Kotoha:
That's right.

Rino:
That's great!
I hope I didn't offend you by asking such a personal question...

Kotoha:
No problem.
So it's a good thing that I chose that for myself, huh?
She said something like that to me once...

Kanade:
You know that you didn't have to come after me, don't you?

Nanaho:
I can assure you that I, and all of the Best Student Council, will protect Miss Kanade because that's what we've chosen to do.
So Kotoha, if you're here because someone ordered you to and you're not happy about it, then I would suggest that you just leave now.

Kanade:
You have no obligation here.

Kotoha:
It's true. I came to this school because I was ordered to.
However, I was given a choice, and I chose to accept that order.
Therefore, I am here of my own free will, ma'am.

Kanade:
So you were not at all coerced.
This was your decision.

Kotoha:
Yes, ma'am.

Kanade:
Well, then that's a good thing.
Welcome to Miyagami Academy!

Nanaho:
Welcome aboard, Kotoha Kutsugi.

Kotoha:
And that's when I met her...

Kuon:
So you wanna be a member of the Covert Squad?

Kotoha:
Yes.

Kuon:
I should probably warn you: Information collection isn't nearly as exciting as it sounds,
unless, of course, you count the occasional, indecent exposure.

Kotoha:
Not a problem.

Kuon:
Kotoha, do you ever smile?

Kotoha:
If I have to smile to complete a mission, then I will do so.

Kuon:
I'm not so sure that would count as a real smile.
At any rate, I'm happy to have you as a Covert Squad member.

Kuon:
I'm impressed. Good work, Kotoha.

Kuon:
That certainly was a difficult mission.

Kuon:
I'd really appreciate it if you wouldn't share that information with the president.

Kuon:
Thank you, Kotoha.

Kotoha:
But why? Why does this bother me so much?

Rino:
Hey, Kotoha!

Kotoha:
What is it?

Rino:
Look over there!
There's a man going into Mayumi's apartment!

Kotoha:
What?!

Kotoha:
It's him... Kokyu Fujisawa, an agent of the Nafrece Intelligence Organization...

Minamo:
They're gonna get kissy-face!

Pucchan:
Did I mention the wrestling in the rumble?

Rino:
No! Not that!

Rino:
Where's Kotoha?



Rino:
Whoa, Kotoha just totally disappeared!

Minamo:
But where or where could she have gone?!

Pucchan:
Where do you think she went?
She's over there!

Minamo:
She went to the scene?!

Pucchan:
That's one crazy chick.


Kokyu:
You met her, the illustrious Kanade Jinguji?

Mayumi:
Yeah, a few days ago.
She was at my transfer interview.
You know, she really is a beautiful young lady.
And she has this incredible presence, it almost took my breath away.
So that young girl's the next head of the Jinguji Family?

Kokyu:
Well, that's what our spies have reported.
The Jinguji family has been the power behind Japan for generations.
And we know that what's kept the Jingunji Conglomerate prosperous has little to do with their financial power.
There has to be another reason for their strong influence.
The Jinguji family have a special ability...

Mayumi:
And your job is to figure out what that is, right?

Kokyu:
We sent an agent three years ago, but she is yet to produce a conclusive report.

Mayumi:
Let me guess, that's why you called me in.

Kokyu:
Yes, that's right.

Mayumi:
I read in your report that the other agent is Kuon Ginga?

Kokyu:
Yeah. She's been working with us since she was 13 years old.

Mayumi:
Do you think it's possible that she's betrayed your organization?

Kokyu:
Not a chance.
Kuon Ginga's parents own a successful company, it is financed by Nafrece's affiliate.
I'm sure that even a 16-year old girl could figure out what the consequence would be if she betrayed us.

Mayumi:
What?

Kokyu:
I just find it amusing that she's doing all of this without her parents' knowledge.
She's been keeping a distance from her parents so they won't find out what she's been up to.
Talk about a faithful daughter, huh?

Mayumi:
That's kinda sad.

Kokyu:
Yeah, I agree.
In order to protect her beloved family, she's forced to distance herself from them.
But a girl with that much to lose would never betray us. Never.

Kotoha:
That bastard!

Kanade:
I guess that means you'll just have to keep trying to figure it out.
So until you find out what my secret is,
you will continue to attend this school and you will remain Vice President of the Best Student Council.

Kotoha:
It all makes sense now...
I know why I can't reveal Kuon's true identity.
If I did, then not only would she have to leave the Best Student Council,
but her relationship with her parents could be ruined.
She's torn between her parents and the Best Student Council...
I can't believe she's been suffering all this time...

Mayumi:
What?

Kokyu:
Nothing. I thought I heard something.

Kotoha:
Kokyu Fujisawa...


Rino:
Oh, hi, Kotoha!

Minamo:
Hey! Don't just go off and disappear like that!
We didn't know what to do without you!

Kotoha:
Sorry about that.

Minamo:
So tell us! How did everything go?

Kotoha:
Excuse me?

Minamo:
What happened in what's-her-face's apartment?

Rino:
Did they get kissy-face?

Pucchan:
Did you see any wrestling going on?

Kotoha:
It appears our initial reports were false.
The man visiting Mayumi is her relative.

Rino, Minamo:
What?

Kotoha:
In other words, we've proven her innocence.

Minamo:
Bummer! I got all excited for nothing!

Pucchan:
You mean I could have been home sleeping all this time?

Kotoha:
It's part of the Covert Squad's job.

Rino:
Well, it's good to know there's not a problem after all!
I think maybe we should apologize to Mayumi.
You know, for being suspicious of her.

Kotoha:
Yeah, you're right. I think I might do that.

Minamo:
Big deal! Get over it!

Rino:
It is a big deal!

Kotoha:
I think I understand now...
Seina sent these two to work with me because she knew that...


Rein:
We heard about everything from Seina, she told us and she informed us!

Mayura:
So you two got to help out the Covert Squad?

Sayuri:
Well, how'd it go?

Cyndi:
Tell me.

Minamo:
It was super boring, you guys!
We did this stakeout, and absolutely nothing exciting happened!

Rein:
Well, that's no fun at all!

Rino:
You know, I'm kinda glad nothing happened.

Mayura:
You're right. Nothing's better than something bad.

Rino:
Yeah!

Pucchan:
Everything's back to normal, right?

Sayuri:
I'd say that there's absolutely nothing normal about you.

Cyndi:
He's wonderful!


Kokyu:
Don't forget to check in with us regularly.

Mayumi:
Don't worry about me. I know the routine.

Kokyu:
Who are you?

Shiro:
You seriously have no idea who I am?
And you call yourself an intelligence agent?
Maybe you should consider another line of work.
And you, come on, gramma.
You're not fooling anybody with that schoolgirl routine.
That ship's long gone.

Kokyu:
Are you from the Jinguji family?

Shiro:
Not a member, but we're definitely close.
Let's just say I got their backs.

Kokyu:
Hmph! Then where's your gun?

Shiro:
You really are stupid, aren't ya?
Guns are illegal in Japan, you moron.

Kokyu:
Oh, really...

Shiro:
Okay, listen up.
Those girls are enjoying their high school years.
So you'd better not go and screw it all up for them, you got that?
Leave 'em alone or you'll deal with me!
Do I make myself clear?

Mayumi:
Could these bodyguards be the real power behind the Jinguji's?

Mayumi:
A kid?

Kotoha:
Please don't be deceived by my appearance.
I am a fierce watch dog of the Jinguji.

Mayumi:
Really? And what a cute watch dog you are!
You're a brave kid. Too bad I have to kill you.

Kotoha:
I've been trained by the best martial artists in the world.
You might want to keep that in mind.

Mayumi:
That doesn't matter. Not when you're looking down the barrel a gun.

Kotoha:
I now realize my true purpose here.
To defend the right of every Miyagami student to live a normal and happy life.
That's the real job of the Covert Squad!


Kaori:
What was that noise?

Shiro:
Hey, it's #4. I got a report.
Situation of Miyagami is under control. Thanks.
I managed to catch these two. That still leaves Ginga.
And no doubt that cute little spy will continue with her mission.
And me no likey that...


Seina:
President, Kotoha took care of everything.
It seems that Shiro played a part in the spies' capture, as well.

Nanaho:
Brother four? Really...

Kanade:
I put Kotoha in such a dangerous situation...

Seina:
You know, she chose to be part of that situation on her own.
It was her decision.

Kanade:
Yes...

Nanaho:
So, how do you think Kotoha will handle her issues with Kuon?

Kanade:
To be honest, I'm not really concerned about that.
She'll make the right decision.
After all, she's a member of the Best Student Council.


Kotoha:
Do you mind if I join you?

Kuon:
I didn't hear you come in.

Kotoha:
Of course you didn't.

Kuon:
Well, you do have a knack for showing up unexpectedly.

Kotoha:
I needed to talk to you without being seen by the other members.
I want... I need to apologize to you, Kuon.

Kuon:
You don't have to apologize, really.
How did you get that scratch?

Kotoha:
Don't worry. It's no big deal.

Kuon:
What happened during your mission today?
Kotoha?

Kotoha:
You care about your family...
But you also care about the Best Student Council...
Isn't that right?

Kuon:
You've just proven why you're the most impressive member of the Covert Squad...
I guess I can't hide anything from you.

Kotoha:
Kuon Ginga, you're an intelligent young woman who appears to be in complete control.
But you've had to make some difficult choices and you're suffering as a result.
It's no different than the image I'm used to.

Kuon:
Well, I guess now you know the real me.

Kotoha:
Is that so?

Kuon:
Yeah.

Kotoha:
You can continue to try and find out Miss Kanade's secret.
Just know that I'll do all I can to stop you. So...
You'll have to try to get past me, Vice President.

Kuon:
I'll remember that, Kotoha.

Kotoha:
If you don't mind, I have one last question.

Kuon:
Hm?

Kotoha:
Why do you keep that picture of you and Kokyu Fujisawa?
It's none of my business, but don't you hate him for what he's done to you?

Kuon:
I hold on to that photo so that I never forget.
Miyagami Academy... The Best Student Council...
I've always felt so comfortable here, Kotoha.
Sometimes it's easy to forget the bad stuff, to forget the situation I've been put in.
So I keep that photo around.
It's there to remind me of the reality of my situation.

Kotoha:
You know, you're still a hard person to figure out.

Kuon:
I may be closed off, but at least I can admit when I need help.

Kotoha:
What do you mean?

Kuon:
I know that deep down you just wanna fit in with everyone.

Kotoha:
No...

Kuon:
Seina told me about your two sidekicks.
I'll bet you've had a lot of fun with Minamo and Rino.

Kotoha:
Not really...

Kuon:
Are you sure?

Kotoha:
Well... maybe just a little.

Kuon:
You know, I never thought I'd see this.
You're smiling, Kotoha.

Kotoha:
I am?

Kuon:
Uh-huh.

Kotoha:
I guess it's okay to smile every now and then.



Cyndi:
Oh... Oh...

Pucchan:
Really? Cyndi's mom has come to visit and things are gonna get crazy?

Cyndi:
Yes!

Pucchan:
Next time on Best Student Council: "Keep on Lying!"
The lies we tell are the Best!

Cyndi:
Uh-huh!
