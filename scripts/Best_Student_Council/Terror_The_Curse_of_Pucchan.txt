  Kaori:
I can't believe we're eating curry rice for lunch again.

Rein:
How many days straight have we been eating it as of today, this afternoon, this time?

Sayuri:
Ten days.

Kaori:
Please, Vice President.
We can't eat this stuff every day. It's not good for us.

Nanaho:
I understand you're concerned, Kaori, but it's wrong of us to waste food.
Besides, you guys are the ones who made too much of it.
Take responsibility.
Even I'm eating this stuff just to help you out.

Kaori:
Yeah, but you're the one who got all fired up and made us cook it...

Nanaho:
Did you just say something?

Kaori:
No, ma'am! Nothing at all!

Nanaho:
Take a look at Rando over there.
She's happy just to have food in front of her.

Rando:
It's so yummy!
I've got no problem eating curry every day as long as it's this delicious, right, Pucchan?

Pucchan:
Yup. You got it, kiddo.

Kaori:
She doesn't mind. She's insane.

Mayura:
Hey, Nanaho, I didn't compete in the contest, so why do I have to eat curry rice every day, too?

Pucchan:
Don't sweat the small stuff, treasurer chickie.

Mayura:
It's kinda hard not to when the Covert Squad is eating cake...

Seina:
This cake is delicious, don't you think?

Kuon:
Yes, it's very good.

Kaori:
I just want a little piece...

Rando:
Kaori!

Kaori:
Huh?

Rando:
Cake is nothing compared to curry rice!
You want some more?

Kaori:
Quit it, Rino, or you're gonna get hurt!

Rein:
I can't eat it anymore, I can't...
I'm tired of it.

Pucchan:
Quit whining! You're such a little brat!

Sayuri:
That was rude.

Pucchan:
You know, all that curry will give you bigger boobies to go with those glasses.
The curry diet, I heard it works wonders.

Rein:
Sayuri!

Sayuri:
Yeah, Rein!

Rando:
There really isn't such a thing as the "curry diet," is there, Pucchan?

Pucchan:
Nope. No such thing.

Rando:
You're so silly, Pucchan!

Nanaho:
That stupid little puppet is as foulmouthed as ever.


Nanaho:
I have completely accepted this without ever even questioning it, and I'm not sure that I should even bring this up,
but there's one question I have to ask.
Rando.

Rando:
Hmm?

Nanaho:
What's the deal with that puppet?

Rando:
He's my friend, Pucchan.

Pucchan:
Yup. The name's Pucchan, little lady.
You'd think you girls would have a doubt by now.

Nanaho:
Stop it. That's not what I'm asking, Rando.
And I expect an honest answer.
Why do you insist on making offensive comments through ventriloquism?

Kuon:
Ventriloquism?

Seina:
You think so?

Kaori:
I never really thought about it till you pointed it out, 'cause his voice sounds like a completely different person.

Nanaho:
Exactly, but the unacceptable behavior that we've been dealing with from this puppet, Pucchan, is because of Rando!
She's made fools of us using her ventriloquism skills!

Mayura:
So that means Rino was the one who called me treasurer chickie!

Rein:
Why'd you call me a little brat, Rino?

Sayuri:
Big boobies with glasses?

Rando:
Um, I...

Kaori:
Speak up, Rino! Why don't you tell us why you're trying to make fools of us?

Rando:
That's not what I'm doing...

Pucchan:
Don't get your knickers in a wad!
I'm only telling you the truth!

Rando:
Stop it, Pucchan!

Kaori:
Rino, quit acting like he's a different person!
We know you're the one who's making him talk!

Rando:
But I...

Pucchan:
Why don't you leave the kiddo alone?
Who cares about the Best Student Council?
You little girls are nothing but a bunch of wimps!

Nanaho:
I've had enough, Rando!
How dare you ridicule the Best Student Council!
Unforgivable!

Mayura:
No, wait! Please calm down!

Kaori:
I'm sorry, but we can't let you do that, Vice President!

Nanaho:
Let me go! I've pledged to defend the reputation of the Best Student Council!

Kaori:
Yah, we know that!

Mayura:
Stop, please!

Nanaho:
Confiscate that puppet NOW!

Rando:
Pucchan, apologize to them!

Pucchan:
This could be the perfect opportunity...

Rando:
Huh?

Rein:
Confiscate, impound and take it!
Sayuri!

Kaori:
Here you go, Vice President.

Nanaho:
Rando, we're going to take this puppet of yours into council custody.

Rando:
No, please wait! He's my best friend!

Nanaho:
Your behavior must be punished.

Kaori:
Sorry, Rando, but you deserve it after all those horrible things you said.

Sayuri:
It's nothing personal.

Rando:
But I didn't say those things...
Pucchan...


Kanade:
So you confiscated Pucchan?

Nanaho:
To be precise, we have confiscated Rando's puppet, ma'am.
It'll be closely watched under our surveillance.
Her behavior using ventriloquism is unacceptable.
It creates disorder among our members and could possibly interfere with the future of Best Student Council activities.
Please, Miss President. I'm begging you to approve this action.

Kanade:
I won't interfere, but can I ask you something, Nanaho?

Nanaho:
Sure. What is it?

Kanade:
How is Rino handling this?

Nanaho:
Well, she's been a sniveling mess, but I guess that's to be expected.


Rando:
Please, Miss Vice President! Can I see Pucchan?
You see? I even made this visitation permit myself!

Kuon:
I'm really sorry. This was Nanaho's decision, so I'm afraid there's nothing I can do to help you, Rino.

Rando:
Pucchan! Pucchan!

Rein:
I feel sorry, sad and miserable for her...

Sayuri:
So do I.

Kaori:
I know what you mean, this is kind of hard to watch.
But she should be punished for what she's done.


Ayumu:
What's the matter? Rino?
It's like she's fading away or something.
She's lost all color.
Hey, wait, Pucchan's missing.

Rando:
Ayu-chan!

Ayumu:
What is it, Rino?! What's the matter?!


Cyndi:
Oh. Cute...


Ayumu:
I see... So they took Pucchan away from you?
But you know, I can understand why they did it.
I mean, when you make Pucchan talk, you kinda act like a completely different person, Rino.

Rando:
That's 'cause he is a different person!
Pucchan talks on his own, it's not me!

Ayumu:
That can't be!
Pucchan's just a puppet, he can't talk on his own.

Rando:
But that's just not true! Pucchan's NOT just a silly puppet!
He's a very special friend of mine. I'm not lying.
I'm telling you the truth...
When my mom passed away, it was Pucchan who was always there for me...
I would have been lost... without him...


Rando:
Mom...
Mom...
Say something! Please, I just wanna hear your voice!
I'm so afraid of being alone! Please, mom! I'm so lonely!

Tell me what I'm supposed to do. Please, Pucchan...

Pucchan:
Don't cry, kiddo.

Rando:
Pucchan?

Pucchan:
Rino, don't you remember what your mom told ya?
She said you're a strong girl and that she knew you'd be okay.

Rando:
Pucchan...

Pucchan:
I'm not going anywhere, kiddo.
I'll be with you forever.

Rando:
Pucchan!


Rando:
Isn't that the sweetest story?

Ayumu:
Actually, I think it's a little creepy...

Rando:
It's not creepy at all! It's a beautiful story!

Ayumu:
I guess it's not as creepy when you put it that way...

Rando:
It's like he said! I'm gonna be with Pucchan forever!
I'll do it!

Ayumu:
Just what are you planning to do?

Rando:
I'm gonna have a serious talk with Pucchan.
I'll convince him to never talk badly about people again!
Maybe if he agrees to that, then they'll give him back to me!

Ayumu:
Rino...

Rando:
Crying isn't gonna get me anywhere.
I'm gonna do it, Ayu-chan! You'll see!

Ayumu:
She agonizes alone, she cries alone, and then she gets over it on her own.
Well, I guess all of that is just part of what makes Rino, Rino.


Rando:
Miss Vice President!

Nanaho:
Yes, Rando?

Rando:
I'd like to ask you a favor, Miss Vice President.
I wanna talk to Pucchan.

Nanaho:
Rando, I've been told your puppet is missing.

Rando:
Huh?

Nanaho:
Follow me, and we'll check it out.

Rando:
Pucchan!

Nanaho:
Give me a status report, Kaori.

Kaori:
Well, it seems that the jail cell that was holding the puppet has been opened.

Mayura:
And there's that...

Rando:
That's Pucchan's handwriting...

Nanaho:
No way.

Kuon:
Does this mean...

Seina:
Is it possible that Pucchan could have escaped from this cell...?

Mayura:
Now he's plotting his revenge on us for throwing him in there in the first place!

Rando:
Uh...

Pucchan:
Hope you gals are ready for some serious revenge!



Rando:
I miss Pucchan...
I wonder where he could be right now...

Kanade:
It'll be okay, Rino.
I'm sure that he'll come back soon.

Rando:
I really hope you're right.
You think he's gonna be angry with me?

Kanade:
No.

Rando:
You're gonna come back, aren't you?
You said that you'd stay with me forever.
Do you remember, Pucchan?


Nanaho:
Hmph! The puppet's curse?
What's the matter with you two?
I thought you had more common sense than this!

Seina:
Yeah, but you never know.

Nanaho:
Maybe. However, in this case, it's obvious someone stole the puppet and then drew the graffiti on the wall.
There's no other explanation.

Kuon:
And while I do agree with you, Nanaho, I must say that I'm relieved to know that if for some strange reason there is a puppet's curse,
it'll in no way affect the members of the Covert Squad.

Nanaho:
What do you mean by that?

Kuon:
The person who called for the confiscation of Rino Rando's beloved puppet, Pucchan, was you, Nanaho.
And of course, the people who completed your orders and took the puppet away from her were Assault Team members Sayuri, Rein, and Kaori.

Seina:
So if anyone is going to be targeted by Pucchan, it's safe to assume that it will only be the members of the Assault Squad.
All this talk of curses and stuff has got me a little scared!

Kuon:
Yeah, I know what you mean, Seina.

Nanaho:
Oh, you guys are ridiculous.
You don't really think I'd be scared by a little...
What?

Seina:
Oh, it's nothing.

Kuon:
Just surprised by the lightning.

Mayura:
Aiiieee!

Kuon:
Who was that screaming?!

Seina:
It sounded just like Mayura!

Nanaho:
Mayura!

Kanade:
Is there something wrong?

Mayura:
Look over there!

Nanaho:
But that's impossible!
How could members of the Assault Squad be defeated so easily?

Kuon:
Maybe it's the puppet's curse.

Rino:
Oh, Pucchan...

Kuon:
You'd better be careful and watch your back, Nanaho.

Nanaho:
What? Are you kidding?
I don't believe in stupid curses!
What?

Everyone:
Surprised by the lightning.


Kuon:
Now there's absolutely no question in my mind.
The puppet's curse actually exists.

Rino:
Oh, Pucchan...

Nanaho:
That's interesting. If that's how it is, I accept the challenge.
Puppet curse or no puppet curse, I refuse to back down and risk bringing shame to the Best Student Council.


Nanaho:
Come and get me if you dare!
I'm not gonna run away from a silly little puppet!
I'm not gonna run away...
What? A blackout?

Pucchan:
Nanaho Kinjo! Do you think you are safe?
You're the one who threw me in jail in the first place!

Nanaho:
Who's there?
I wanna see who's making that puppet talk!

Pucchan:
Nobody is, toots!
I told ya I'm Pucchan! And don't ya forget it, chickity!

Nanaho:
Don't underestimate us!
Rein! Sayuri!
Turn on the lights, Kaori!

Mayura:
Did you get him?

Rino:
Pucchan!

Cyndi:
No...

Nanaho:
It's you, Cyndi?
Does this mean that you're our culprit?

Cyndi:
No.

Nanaho:
Don't play dumb, Cyndi!
I know it was you! You're wearing the puppet on your hand right now!

Cyndi:
It wasn't me...

Pucchan:
I told ya! It's just me, baby!

Nanaho:
Shut up!

Pucchan:
Revived!

Mayura:
What's going on? I swear that wasn't me!
This thing's totally talking on its own!

Pucchan:
I told ya I'm the one and only Pucchan, toots!

Mayura:
I can't get it off!

Nanaho:
I've had enough of this!

Rino:
Pucchan, please stop this!
If you keep this up, everyone will hate you even more and then they'll take you away me again!
I don't want that to happen!

Pucchan:
Rino...

Rino:
Please apologize to them.
Do it for me, Pucchan.

Pucchan:
Of course I will, but only for you, kiddo.

Rino:
Thanks, Pucchan.

Pucchan:
I know I crossed the line and I'm sorry about that.

Rino:
Won't you please forgive Pucchan, Miss Vice President?
I'm begging you!

Kuon:
Nanaho, I think maybe you should go ahead and reconcile with the puppet.

Nanaho:
Yeah, you're right.
I'll admit that I was tough on you and that I shouldn't have been so quick to judge.
So please accept my humble apologies.

Pucchan:
You know what, toots? You're a pretty tough broad.

Nanaho:
Yeah. And you're a stupid puppet.

Rino:
No, Pucchan!

Pucchan:
I'm the type of man who's determined to achieve his goals, honey!
And now my revenge is complete!

Nanaho:
You little bastard!

Rino:
Let him down!

Nanaho:
Somebody's gotta teach you a lesson!

Rino:
No! No! Pucchan!

Chieri:
Please take care of Rino for me, Pucchan.

Rino:
Pucchan! Pucchan!
Pucchan, no...
Please talk to me... Pucchan!

Pucchan:
Is that you, kiddo?

Rino:
Pucchan, please don't leave me!

Pucchan:
I was stirring up a little mischief.
Guess I went too far.

Rino:
But you always do.

Pucchan:
You know how I am, kiddo.
I'm like a sports car without any brakes.

Rino:
So, then you're defective?

Pucchan:
'Fraid so. I've been an odd puppet all my life, kiddo.

Rino:
Pucchan!

Pucchan:
My vision's blurry...
Sorry, Rino, I won't be able to keep my promise of staying with you forever...

Rino:
But why...

Pucchan:
I'm sorry, kiddo...

Rino:
No! You can't leave me!
I've already lost my mom, I don't wanna lose you, too!
I don't wanna be alone!

Pucchan:
Listen to you. You're not alone anymore, kiddo.
You're part of the Best Student Council now.
You shouldn't be running around with a no-good puppet like me.
I'm telling you, kiddo, this is what's best for you.

Rino:
Pucchan!

Seina:
Is it possible that Pucchan did this to help Rino become independent?

Mayura:
Wow...

Kuon:
He could have done that without breaking Rino's heart.

Pucchan:
Listen, Rino, this is where I have to say goodbye.
Have fun with your friends.

Rino:
Pucchan, no...

Pucchan:
So long...

Rino:
Talk to me! Pucchan!

Pucchan... Please... Open your eyes...
Pucchan! Pucchan! PUCCHAN!

Nanaho:
I'm really sorry. Rando.

Rino:
Please don't apologize.
It wasn't anyone but Pucchan's fault.
He could be such a pain in the butt. Always in trouble.
Maybe my life will be easier without him.

Nanaho:
I'm sorry.

Kanade:
Rino.

Rino:
Miss President.
He left me... Pucchan left...

Kanade:
No. I bet he feels amazing.

Rino:
Huh?

Kanade:
He's pretending to be dead.

Pucchan:
You busted me, pretty lady!

Rino:
You're alive?!

Nanaho:
There's no way!

Pucchan:
I may be charred, but did you really think that puppets can die?
Dummy! You've been fooled!

Rino:
Wait, Pucchan! Where are you going?

Nanaho:
Get back here you stupid puppet before I turn you into throw pillows!
Hey! Come back here!

Mayura:
Wow, scary...

Kaori:
Can someone tell me what just happened?

Seina:
Looks like everything's back to normal, right?


Pucchan:
It was crazy. I was really dead for a while there.
Hey, Miss President, did you do something special?

Kanade:
Huh? Whatever do you mean?

Pucchan:
Don't play coy.

Kanade:
Oh, come on. That doesn't really matter, does it?
All that matters is that you're around for Rino because she needs you.
The only reason she's been able to let go of the grief of losing her mother is because you're always with her.

Pucchan:
You could always take my place if you needed to.

Kanade:
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

Pucchan:
Huh?

Kanade:
Pucchan, won't you please stay with Rino?
Please, Pucchan?

Pucchan:
I guess I got no choice.


Ayumu:
Oh, wow. I had no idea all of that was going on.

Pucchan:
I'm telling ya, that Vice President is a piece of work.
She was all like, "I'm sorry, Rando!" I fooled her!

Ayumu:
That's kind of mean!

Rino:
Quit being such a jerk, Pucchan!

Nanaho:
You kids having fun?

Rino:
Vice President!
It's not what you're thinking, ma'am!
I swear it wasn't me, it was Pucchan!

Nanaho:
I understand that, but I've got a score to settle with that puppet.
Now give him to me, Rando!

Rino:
No! You can't have him!

Nanaho:
Hand over that puppet!

Rino:
Don't take him away!

Nanaho:
I'm ordering you, Rando!

Pucchan:
Wanna know who I am?
Well, get over it. I'm not telling.



Mayura:
Hey, this is treasurer, Mayura Ichikawa.
My Best Student Council pals are up to something, but I don't know what.
What do you mean it's for my own good?
Next time on Best Student Council: "Love Being Nosey"
Do you have a Best friend?
