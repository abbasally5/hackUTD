  Mayura:
We don't have the budget!

Kuon:
I'm calling an end to today's meeting.
I would like to thank you for attending.

Mayura:
Listen! Our budget can't handle it, I'm telling you!

Nanaho:
It's the treasurer's job to handle the Best Student Council's budget.

Seina:
In other words, we're gonna let you figure it out, Mayura.

Mayura:
If you're leaving the budget up to me, I'd appreciate if you'd get my permission before you carelessly use our money!
Unplanned car repairs... Unplanned welcome parties... Unplanned crazy full-scale traps...
And on top of all that, firing the Youth Cannon!
We're gonna be short no matter how hard I work on it!
It's impossible for me to keep up when you ask for approval after you've spent the money!

Nanaho:
It's not completely our fault.

Kuon:
It's not like we can foresee these events.

Mayura:
I can't foresee a balanced budget!

Seina:
Hey, Mayura, try to calm down!
Why don't you tell us how much we're short exactly?

Mayura:
Either the Assault Squad or the Covert Squad is gonna have a budget of zero for the next month.

Kuon:
Oh my...

Nanaho:
Well, that's certainly not good news.

Pucchan:
Things are looking good where I am, ladies!

Kuon:
Whether it's the Assault Squad or Covert Squad, it would be absurd for one of us to have no budget for an entire month.

Nanaho:
Can't we cut the other budgets down a little?

Mayura:
I completely cut the other budgets.

Nanaho:
Right. Then cut the Covert Squad's budget.

Kuon:
No. Didn't you mean to say the Assault Squad's budget?

Nanaho:
The Covert Squad is so sneaky that none of us really even know its purpose.
And the same goes for how their budget is being spent.

Kuon:
I believe that the Assault Squad wouldn't need a budget if they would stop destroying school property.

Nanaho:
Sacrifice is a necessity of combat.

Kuon:
The Covert Squad's operations are necessary to try and avoid combat altogether.

Kanade:
In that case, why don't we have a battle?
The Assault Squad and the Covert Squad could compete to decide who gets to have a budget this month.
So now, what kind of a battle should we have?

Pucchan:
Wake up, Rino!

Rino:
Oh, Pucchan, I have a giant plate of yummy curry rice over here...

Kanade:
How about a curry battle?

Kuon, Nanaho:
A-A curry battle?


Nanaho:
Listen up, everybody!
Now I'm not sure how we got into this mess,
but in order to secure our budget we, the Assault Squad, have to make an amazing plate of curry rice, better than the Covert Squad's!

Rein:
Don't you worry, Miss Vice-President!
All three of us have prepared yummy, scrumptious and delicious curry rice plates for you to sample, taste and select!

Nanaho:
Bring me the first plate.

Sayuri:
Here you go.

Nanaho:
Well, it's not too exciting, but it does have a well-rounded flavor.
The spiciness is pretty balanced.
Sayuri, what's the secret to your curry rice?

Rein:
Contestant No. 2! Rein Tsunomoto!
Please eat it, savor it, and polish it all off!

Nanaho:
Oh, wow. It reminds me of curry rice you'd get at one of those old noodle shops.
This isn't all that bad, Rein.

Rein:
I knew you'd like it.
Believe it or not, I've got skills you guys don't know about!

Nanaho:
I have to say I'm very impressed!
So tell me, what's the secret behind your recipe?

Delivery guy:
Excuse me! You done with those plates yet?

Rein:
We're still eating and consuming, sir!

Delivery guy:
Sure. I'll just come back.

Rein:
Say hello to your boss for me!

What's the matter?

Nanaho:
This is pathetic...
I can't believe the great Assault Squad can't even make a plate of curry rice...

Before I taste it, tell me where it came from.

Kaori:
It's homemade, ma'am.
I may not look like it, but I'm actually a good cook.
I even took the time to blend the spices myself.

Nanaho:
I see...

Kaori:
Please go ahead and give it a try!
It may surprise you!

Nanaho:
For the sake of the Assault Squad, I hope it's good.

It's good! Kaori, it's good!

Kaori:
Like I said, I'm really a pretty good cook!


Kuon:
I see... Thanks for the report.
Interesting that Nanaho has appointed Kaori as their team leader for the curry contest.

Seina:
Probably through a process of elimination.
When it comes to cooking, Sayuri and Rein are absolutely horrible!

Kuon:
No matter if the others can cook, one good cook is enough.
I'm sure that Kaori could serve up a scrumptious curry rice plate all by herself.
We need to take the necessary precautions.

Seina:
You got it, Kuon!


Rino:
Miss Vice-President?
What are you doing all the way out here?

Kuon:
I've come out here to scout for talent, Miss Rando.

Rino:
To scout?

Pucchan:
Oh, wow. What kind of talent do you expect to find in the woods?

Kuon:
Would you like to come along and see?


Rino:
Where are we?

Kuon:
This is an old temporary building that was used while Miyagami Academy was still being built.
More than half of this building has been demolished.

Pucchan:
So why'd they only keep this part?

Kuon:
Because that's what the president wanted.
It's become something of a monument over the years.

Rino:
Oh...

Pucchan:
Hey, toots, mind getting the lights?

Kuon:
Please follow me.


God of Cooking:
I am the God of Cooking!
Please identify yourself, brave visitors!
Identify yourself!

Kuon:
I am the Vice-President of the Best Student Council, Kuon Ginga.

Rino:
And I'm the secretary, Rino.

Pucchan:
And I'm Pucchan, the comic relief.

God of Cooking:
Just as I thought. I knew that members of the Best Student Council would show up here sooner or later.

Kuon:
That really simplifies things for us, doesn't it?

God of Cooking:
I have called the Curry Commando elite task force to duty.
Please feel free to utilize their talents.

Karen, Eliza, Suzie:
Karen! Eliza! And Suzie!
And together, we are... The Three Curry Rice Sisters!

Rino:
Karen... Eliza... and Suzie?

Pucchan:
They look Japanese to me!

Karen, Eliza, Suzie:
My real name is Saito!
I'm Yamamoto!
And I'm Yoshida!

Pucchan:
They're not really sisters!

God of Cooking:
The Three Curry Rice Sisters will help you.
Ladies, make sure that you demonstrate our full abilities!

Karen, Eliza, Suzie:
Aye-aye, sir!
It's very nice to meet you, Miss Vice-President Kuon!
Greetings!

Kuon:
I'm glad that you'll be part of our team.

Pucchan:
Sure about that?


Rino:
I had no idea that was the culinary club's meeting room.

Pucchan:
They're more like a secret society than a club.

Kuon:
But there's no denying that they're good cooks.

Pucchan:
But why on earth would you go to all the trouble to bring in the pros?
They're cute and all, but the Assault Squad ain't exactly a group of master chiefs.

Kuon:
And that's exactly why I wanted them.
You never know what to expect in battle.
Especially when Nanaho is your opponent.


Kaori:
To add some depth to the curry sauce, I'm gonna sauté some onions.
You have to sauté them until they turn to golden brown.

Rein:
Fire! Fire!
Put 'em together and you've got a blaze!

Kaori:
Rein, put the cover on it!

Rein:
Cover!

Kaori:
No!

Rein:
Call 911! Call 911!
What's the number for 911?

Nanaho:
So that's how it is.
I'd expect no less from you, Kuon, you're pretty good...

Kaori:
Just do it!
Never mind! I'll do it myself!



Seina:
Thank you all for your patience!
Isn't it a beautiful day today? It's a perfect day for curry rice!
Who's gonna win the curry battle of the century?
Will it be the Red Staff team of Nanaho Kinjo?
Or will it be the Blue Staff team of Kuon Ginga?
We'd like to welcome you today, I'm Seina Katsura, president of supplies!
And with me is the treasurer of the Best Student Council, Miss Mayura Ichikawa!

Mayura:
Why did I agree to this?

Seina:
And now, let's introduce our judges!
They are the president of the Best Student Council, Miss Kanade Jinguji, and our secretary, Miss Rino Rando!

Rino:
Excuse me, Miss President, I still don't understand why I got picked to help judge such an important contest.

Kanade:
Don't you wanna eat some delicious curry rice?

Rino:
Yeah, of course!

Pucchan:
Me, too!

Kaori:
Look how close they are! Stupid Rino Rando!
I'll make a curry rice plate that'll make Miss Kanade moan with delight!
You just wait and see, I'm taking your place this time!

Kanade:
I've been waiting, Kaori.

Kaori:
Miss Kanade, was there something you wanted to say?

Kanade:
Oh, how nice. It looks so good on you.
You are the Taj Mahal.

Kaori:
I'm the Taj Mahal... Oh, Miss Kanade...

Kanade:
You're my little Curry Cook from India.

Kaori:
Oh, Miss Kanade...

Karen, Eliza, Suzie:
They're not even breaking a sweat!
When we're about to face off!
They're formidable opponents!

Nanaho:
So we're up against the culinary club?
Yes, I'd expect no less.
I mean, she'd do anything to win this.

Kaori:
Don't worry about a thing, Vice-President!
This turban's from the Taj Mahal and, and I'm her little Curry Cook!

Nanaho:
I don't know what you're talking about, but I like your confidence.

Kaori:
Yeah!

Seina:
Now, there are a few surprises that have been set up for this battle of the century.
Just take a look at this!

Nanaho:
What on earth is that?

Kuon:
A climbing wall?

Mayura:
Seina, where did we get that monstrosity?

Seina:
I made it myself!

Mayura:
No one told me about this!

Seina:
We call this challenge "the Ingredient-Gathering Climb"!
If the contestants take too long on the wall, they won't have any time left to cook!

Nanaho:
We can do this, Kaori!
This is the kind of stuff that we specialize in!

Rein:
Tsunomoto go first, Vice-President!

Kaori:
Good luck out there! Just be careful, Rein!

Eliza:
Um, what is that thing?

Karen:
What are we going to do, Miss Vice-President?
We're no good at climbing walls, all we do is cook all day!

Suzie:
We're more like liberal arts kind of girls.

Kuon:
Well, this could be a problem...

Seina:
Everybody on your mark and... Go!

Seina:
Look at Tsunomoto go! She's so fast!
Team Nanaho has made it to the top in the blink of an eye!

Rein:
Let's see here, carrot, onion, potato...

Suzie:
This sucks! If we don't get up there, we're gonna lose before we can even cook!

Eliza:
Oh, man! What do we do now, Saito?

Karen:
Stop calling me that!

Kuon:
Please don't worry.
It'll be taken care of momentarily.

Karen, Eliza, Suzie:
What?

Sayuri:
There's no way...

Kaori:
A helicopter?!


Pucchan:
That's gotta be breaking a rule.

Kanade:
It's what I figured Kuon would do.

Mayura:
How did they get that helicopter?

Seina:
My guess is that they chartered it.

Mayura:
Oh no! Don't tell me that!

Nanaho:
Pretty sneaky, Kuon...
Hurry! Let's go!

Rein:
Roger, understood, okey-dokey!

Rein:
I've returned, I'm back, thanks for waiting!

Kaori:
But where is the basket?
Uh, Rein?

Rein:
Huh? Hmm? Hmm?
Huh?

Nanaho:
Now go get it.


Seina:
Both teams have finished preparing their ingredients and they're about to get to the best part of curry rice making!
However, Team Nanaho has lost five minutes in the boiling segment of the contest!

Kaori:
Pretty impressive, culinary club, but this is nothing new for them.
I have to do something...

Seina:
And now, it's time for us to move on to our second challenge!
This challenge is called "the Curry Roux War"!

Kaori, Rein, Sayuri:
The curry roux?!

Karen, Eliza, Suzie:
The Curry Roux War?!

Seina:
The rules are simple!
Each team will select a representative to fight.
Whoever wins will get to add this "Ultra Scrumptious Brilliant Curry Powder" to their recipe!
Unfortunately, the losing team will have to add this "Plain Old Normal Curry Flavor" to their recipe.

Suzie:
But I'm not a fighter!

Karen:
We're at a total disadvantage here!

Rino:
Things are getting kinda crazy, don't you think?

Pucchan:
I don't know what's going on.
All I wanna do is stuff my face with some curry rice.

Kanade:
Oh, you will soon enough.


Karen:
I'm so gonna be chopped liver!
I'm up against Sayuri!

Eliza, Suzie:
You'll never know until you try!
You can do it, Saito!

Karen:
I told you not to call me that!

Eliza, Suzie:
Relax, I don't think Sayuri would go all out against an amateur!
But we'll be back here praying for you just in case.
Now go!

Seina:
Let the fight begin!

Sayuri:
Prepare yourself.

Karen:
Eeek!

Sayuri:
My glasses... Glasses...

Karen, Eliza, Suzie:
Ta-da!

Sayuri:
I lost the fight and it might cost us the contest.

Rein:
We're done, defeated, cheerio!

Kaori:
Well, I guess I can still make a decent curry with this.

Nanaho:
Doesn't that put you way ahead of us?

Kuon:
Yes, but you seem very calm and composed, considering.

Nanaho:
Because I know that battle is unpredictable and can go either way.

Kuon:
You're right about that.


Seina:
The battle is now on its final stages!
It looks like both teams are getting ready to finish up!

Karen, Eliza, Suzie:
Mm-hm.

Kaori:
So what do you think?

Nanaho:
It's not great. It doesn't even compare to the curry I had last time.

Kaori:
Yeah, I thought so...
You guys don't have to get all bent out of shape like that!

Seina:
Now let's move on to our final challenge!

Kaori:
Another challenge?!

Seina:
This one's called "Rotating Secret Darts"!
One member from each team will throw a dart, and win the secret prize on the board that their dart is stuck to!

Now, let's see what Team Kuon got!
Sweet pickled vegetables! The perfect complement to curry rice!

Suzie:
We'll win! With this, we gotta win!

Eliza:
Saito, we did it!

Karen:
Please stop calling me by my real name!

Seina:
Now let's see what the other team got!

Rein:
What do we do? What do we do? What do we do, Vice-President?
If we get some crazy ingredients, we'll never recover from it!

Nanaho:
Calm down!

Kaori:
I-Indian?

Chadayama:
Namaste!

Kaori:
Huh?

Chadayama:
Namaste!

Pucchan:
Holy cow, that's Chadayama!

Rino:
You know that lady, Pucchan?

Pucchan:
Yeah, she's an old friend of mine.
Curry rice brought us together, but curry rice also tore the two of us apart...


Chadayama:
Namaste...
Namaste...
Namaste...
Namaste...


Pucchan:
What in the world is she doing in Japan?

Kaori:
Hey, what are you doing?

Chadayama:
Namaste.

Kaori:
Huh?

Chadayama:
Namaste.

Pucchan:
Chadayama is a master in the art of curry.
Even if it's the plainest curry, ever once it's been blessed by her, it becomes the finest feast.
Now it's even, it's anybody's game.

Karen:
Wha- It'd taste better just because it's been blessed by her?!

Suzie:
There are a lot of unexplained phenomena and Saito, what do you think?

Karen:
Stop it!

Kanade:
Those two are such good friends.


Seina:
The fierce battle has finally come to an end.
Now both curry rice plates are going to be tasted by our judges.
Let's start with Team Kuon's curry rice!

And now for Team Nanaho's!

Kaori:
Please pick ours, Miss Kanade!

Kanade:
So what do you think, Rino?

Rino:
Well, they're both pretty good, but...

Kanade:
But what?

Rino:
Yummy! I think they taste better together!

Kanade:
Let me try.
Goodness, you're right! This is the best!

Rino:
See? Told ya!

Kanade:
Therefore, our final verdict is...

Rino:
They taste the best mixed together!

Seina:
Well, well, well! The judges have determined the two dishes taste better if you mix them together!
The curry battle of the century has come to an unexpected conclusion!

Kaori:
What kind of judgment is that, Rino Rando?!

Mayura:
But if the contest is a draw, then we haven't solved anything!
Plus you guys wasted more of the budget!

Nanaho:
Rando sure got us, huh?

Kuon:
Who knew cooking was so competitive?

Nanaho, Kuon:
You never know what to expect in battle... do you?

Rino Rando:
Curry rice is my favorite!


Pucchan:
Are you sure you can't stay?

Chadayama:
Namaste.

Pucchan:
I know, darling. It was silly of me to ask.

Chadayama:
Namaste.

Train Announcer:
The train will be departing momentarily.
We ask that anyone who is not a passenger please step back from the track.

Rino:
She was really sweet.

Pucchan:
Yeah, I know...



Pucchan:
What's up? Pucchan here.
That vice-president chick has taken me away from Rino.
Now I must plot and take my revenge!
Next time on Best Student Council: "Terror! The Curse of Pucchan"
I'll let you hear the song of the Best curse!
