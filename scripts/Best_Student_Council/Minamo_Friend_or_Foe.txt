  Nanaho:
Hey everyone, the president has returned!

Nanaho:
What... happened here...?

Rino:
Oh... Miss President...

Kanade:
Rino!
Oh Rino, are you okay?

Nanaho:
Rando, what in the world happened here?

Rino:
Well... you see...
You'd think it would be a really long story, but actually, it's not.

Nanaho:
Then start explaining!

Pucchan:
That little brat over there is the one who caused this whole mess.

Nanaho:
Little brat?

Kanade:
Who are you?

Rino:
Actually, it wasn't too long after you guys left for the president's home this morning.
Kaori stopped by with some cookies she had made for you, Miss Kanade.
Oh, and they were really good.
Not long after that, Cyndi drove Vice President Kuon and Seina off somewhere.
So the rest of us were just hanging out playing card games in the living room.
And of course I lost big time.

Rino:
Man, I lost again.
And of course it's raining when I'm the one who has to go out to get everyone's snacks.

Pucchan:
That's what you get for being too dumb to win at cards.

Rino:
Every time I think I figured it out, I lose again.

Pucchan:
Then I guess you'd better get used to getting wet, kiddo.

Rino:
Does it only rain when I lose?

Nanaho:
So that was the first time you saw her.
She's... She's gone.

Kanade:
Rino, please tell us what happened after that.

Rino:
Well, then it gets kinda weird...

Minamo:
Excuse me miss, do you know if this bus will take me to Miyagami Academy?

Rino:
Huh? Yeah! You're at the right bus stop!

Pucchan:
But that's a school bus stop and school buses don't run on Sunday.
So you'd better start hoofing it if you wanna get there before it gets dark.

Minamo:
You have such an unusual pet.

Rino:
Oh, no. He's not my pet.

Pucchan:
The name's Pucchan, little lady.
Sorry to disappoint, I ain't nobody's pet.

Minamo:
What is your name, ma'am?

Rino:
Uh, my name is Rino Rando.

Minamo:
Okay! So then I can call you Rino, right?
Hey Rino, you should give me that pet of yours!

Rino:
I told you he's not my pet!
I'm sorry I can't give him to you. Pucchan is a dear friend of mine.

Minamo:
That's not very nice!
Why are you being so mean to me?
I thought you and I were friends, Rino!

Rino:
Wait a minute, we're not friends yet! We just met!

Minamo:
But it's not like I'm a stranger or anything!

Rino:
Well yeah, I guess you're kinda right about that...

Minamo:
Then we're friends! Gimme!

Rino:
Um, but I don't think that's a good idea...

Minamo:
Just give it to me already!

Rino:
That argument went on for about another two hours or so...

Nanaho:
Well, that's just nuts.

Minamo:
You're the first person who's refused to give me what I want when I want it!
Why are you being so mean to me?

Rino:
I'm not being mean!
I've never had someone demand something from me when I told them "no" a hundred times!

Rino:
We developed a weird kind of friendship.

Kanade:
Well, I think that's wonderful.

Nanaho:
Now I'm totally confused.

Rino:
But then all of a sudden...

Rino:
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Are you okay?

Pucchan:
It looks like there's something really wrong with her.
Come on, Rino, we'd better take her somewhere where she can get some rest.

Rino:
But where will we take her?

Kanade:
I see. So you carried the girl all the way to the dormitory?

Rino:
Yes, ma'am...

Nanaho:
But Rando, you know that only members of the Best Student Council are allowed inside the dormitory.

Rino:
But this was an emergency, she could have died or something.
I didn't have a choice but to bring her here.

Rein:
Rino sure is taking a long time.

Kaori:
I bet ya that nitwit got lost somewhere.

Mayura:
Hey, remember how she got lost on her first day of school?

Sayuri:
I can't believe she's such a scatterbrain.

Rino:
Oh I get it. While I'm out getting their snacks, they talk bad about me.

Pucchan:
Kiddo, you'd better call a doctor.

Rino:
I can't do that, Pucchan!
If I call a doctor, everyone will know I brought her in the dormitory.
I know! We can always visit our beautiful school nurse, Miss Wakana Hirata!

Pucchan:
You mean that luscious temptress disguised as a school nurse?

Rino:
Maybe if I explain to her what happened, she'd be able to help us out.

Pucchan:
Well, I know where she lives, so we can go visit her.

Rino:
How do you know that?

Pucchan:
I know where all the hot ladies live.

Rino:
Are you home, Miss Wakana?
There's someone sick who needs your help!
If you're in there, I really need to talk to you!
It's an emergency, Miss Wakana!

Wakana:
And just who are you?

Rino:
Miss Wanaka... Ugh, you totally reek!

Wakana:
What's the big deal? It's just alcohol.
Today's my off day, so I can do what I want.
What, am I breaking a law?
Is there some kinda law out there that says a girl can't drink on her off day?
If you got a problem with it, then why don't ya kiss my...

Rino:
I'm back!
On the way home, I picked up some cold medicine, some stomach medicine and some pain killers for y-- waaahhhh!
But, but where did she go?!

Pucchan:
Hey kiddo, let's split up and search for her.

Rino:
Do you know something about how this works that I don't?

Rino:
That's the door to the Vice Presidents' room.
Why is it open?

Pucchan:
Think she's in there?

Rino:
I don't know how she got in, but I figured that since the door was wide open,
that meant she had to be somewhere in the Vice Presidents' bedroom.

Nanaho:
You guys went inside?!

Rino:
Yeah...

Nanaho:
YOU SAW EVERYTHING?!

Pucchan:
Oh yeah, honey! We saw it all!

Pucchan:
I never would have thought that our tough as nails Vice President would be so girlie.

Nanaho:
Just shut up!
It's none of your business!
You're nothing but a stupid puppet!

Kanade:
Let's get back on to the subject of the girl.
So tell me, did you see the girl when you went inside?

Rino:
I did.

Minamo:
Yay, this is awesome!
There's so many stuffed animals to play with!

Rino:
Hey, what are you doing in here?

Minamo:
Oh wow, this is so cute!
I think I'll take it.

Rino:
You can't take other people's stuff without permission!

Pucchan:
That's ten in the poky!

Minamo:
What's the big deal? I mean, look how many there are!
Even if I take five, they'll never even notice!

Nanaho:
Stop right there!
What kind of stuffed animal was she holding hostage, Rando?

Rino:
Um, well...
If I remember correctly, it was a small, pink teddy bear.

Nanaho:
That is my Pilotto teddy bear and he's very special!
He's a special limited-edition bear that was only available in Europe!
I worked hard to get him!
I exchange e-mails with the locals to try and win their friendships so that one of them would send me a bear!
Rando! What did she do to my Pilotto bear?!

Rino:
Well, you see, at that point...

Rino:
Uh, excuse me, I'm glad you're feeling better but considering what happened earlier,
maybe we should call your parents before they get worried.
Do you know their phone number-- wait a minute! I don't even know your name!

Minamo:
I don't think I like this bear anymore.
I don't wanna look at him. Good bye!

Rino:
So we're really sorry, but she threw your teddy bear out into rainy...

Nanaho:
NOOOOOOO! MY PILOTTO!

Kanade:
Hey, Nanaho?

Rino:
Are you okay, Vice President?

Nanaho:
This is unforgivable... Unforgivable!
I'm gonna make that little brat pay for this!
How could she do that to my precious Pilotto?!
I'm gonna tear that little brat apart!

Kanade:
Who would've thought...

Rino:
...that a little pink teddy bear...

Pucchan:
...would make her blow a freaking gasket?

Kanade:
So tell me what happened after that, Rino.

Rino:
Well, while I was standing there in shock, she ran away again.

Rino:
Hey, wait up! I said wait!
Where could she have gone?

Rein:
Rino! We finally found you!

Kaori:
So where have you been all this time?

Mayura:
And where are the snacks you were supposed to get us?

Rino:
Um, well, it's kinda funny...

Sayuri:
Let me guess, she got lost.

Rino:
Uh, yeah, you could say I got lost.
I guess you could say that.

Rein:
Then give us back the money we gave you to buy snacks!
Hand it over, return it, refund our money!

Rino:
Um, I'm sorry but I kinda used all the money to buy medicine and stuff on the way home.

Mayura:
Medicine for what?

Rino:
You'd think it would be a really long story, but actually, it's not.

Kaori:
Then you'd better start explaining!

Rino:
So I decided to tell Kaori and the others about how I brought the girl here to the dorm.
So much had already gone so terribly wrong, Miss Kanade.

Kanade:
Huh?

Rino:
But that was only the beginning...



Kanade:
What do you mean that was just the beginning?

Pucchan:
She's tricky.
We should have realized what she was up to.

Rino:
You see, we never even thought about how she managed to unlock the door to get into the Vice Presidents' room.
We should have realized.

Mayura:
I'm glad you told us what's going on.
Okay everyone, let's split up into teams and start searching for that girl.
Kaori, I want you to come with me to search the third floor.

Kaori:
You got it, Mayura.

Rein:
Then Sayuri and I will start searching for her on the second floor.

Mayura:
And Rino, you watch the front door, okay?

Rino:
Uh, right!

Rein:
All the doors are unlocked!
How, why, what for?

Rino:
I hope everyone is gonna be all right up there.

Pucchan:
Hey kiddo, don't know about you, but I hear a voice coming from Maachi's room.

Rino:
What?

Rino:
Maachi!

Maachi:
There was this girl in my room...
And I don't have any idea how she got in here...
She caught me off guard...

Pucchan:
Not good! Check it out!
Someone broke into the safe!

Maachi:
Oh my, no...
I keep the card key that unlocks all the rooms in there...
If she took it, she has access to everything...

Rino:
What?!

Minamo:
With this key, I can go anywhere!

Rein:
Hey, stop right there!

Minamo:
Oh no!

Rein:
Wait!

You're not getting away!

Sayuri:
We may have a little problem...

Rein:
That's the emergency commuting system!

Minamo:
This thing is so cool-looking! I wonder what it does!

Sayuri:
Let us go!

Rein:
Who are you anyway?
Where did you come from?
What's your name?

Sayuri:
What's your reason for breaking into the dormitory?

Minamo:
You know, I'm feeling kinda hungry all of a sudden.

Rein:
Don't pretend you don't hear us, you brat!

Minamo:
Huh? I wonder what that does.

Sayuri:
No, don't do it.

Rein:
Whatever you do, don't push it!

Sayuri:
Where are my glasses... My glasses...

Mayura:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!!
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone!
The Best Student Council's accounting book is missing!

Kaori:
Is it possible that the girl Rino brought here is sneaking around trying to find out the secrets of the Best Student Council...

Mayura:
What did you say?

Kaori:
It's rare that the president and Vice Presidents aren't here.
She must have known that and used that idiot Rino to walk away into the dorm.
She must be an expert spy. No doubt about it!

Mayura:
If that's the case, then we have a serious problem.
I mean, what if she finds her way into the dormitory's secret room...

Kaori:
What the... We have a secret room?

Mayura:
The dormitory's control system is in a hidden room.
It's rumored the dormitory has its own self-destruct device.

Kuon:
But why would a dormitory need a self-destruct device?!

Mayura:
Don't ask me! I don't know, Kaori!
Let's hurry up and get back downstairs, come on!

Guy:
C'mon! You gotta pay for your food!

Guy:
I came all the way out here in the pouring rain to deliver this stuff!

Rino:
Uh, I'm really sorry, but we didn't order any of this stuff...

Minamo:
Food! Food! Food! Food! Food!

Mayura:
Hey, there she is!

Kaori:
You're trespassing!

Minamo:
Oh no!

Mayura:
Just who are you anyway?

Kaoro:
Yah, tell us who you are, you stupid spy!

Sayuri:
Glasses... Glasses...

Rein:
That little brat! How dare she tried to fool us like this!
I'm gonna break her, beat her up and tear her to pieces!

Sayuri:
My glasses!

My glasses... My glasses... My glasses... My glasses...

Pucchan:
We're lucky they left without making us pay!

Rino:
Do you think that girl could have ordered all that food?

Pucchan:
Who else do you think would do something like that?

Rino:
So what are we gonna do now, Pucchan?

Pucchan:
Okay, listen up, Maachi.
Use the emergency communication system in the Best Student Council meeting room to call someone.
Rino and I will start searching the building for the girl.

Maachi:
Mm.

Pucchan:
Come on, Rino! Move it!

Rino:
Okay!

Rino:
There isn't anybody here...

Pucchan:
Don't tell me she somehow got them all.

Rino:
No, please. Please don't say that, Pucchan.
I already feel bad enough 'cause all of this is my fault.

Pucchan:
This isn't the time to start getting wishy-washy.

Rino:
Huh?

Pucchan:
What's the matter?

Rino:
What is that?

Rino:
I didn't know that we have a basement in the dormitory...

Pucchan:
Wait! Be quiet, Rino!

Seina:
Hey, calm down, Maachi.
All you're doing is making strange noises and I can't understand you.

Rino:
It's open.

Pucchan:
I bet ya she's inside somewhere.

Rino:
Mm-hm.

Minamo:
This thing is so cool!
I've never seen anything like this in a basement before!
It's so awesome!

Rino:
Wow...

Minamo:
Oh, wow! I wonder what it does!
I love all the pretty colors it's got on it.

Rino:
Just what do you think you're doing?

Minamo:
Hey, Rino! Did you come to bring me my delicious food?

Pucchan:
I knew that you were the one who ordered all that food, you little monster!

Minamo:
I had to. I was really hungry, you know.

Rino:
You can't just do whatever you feel like!

Minamo:
Oh yeah, I can!

Rino:
Excuse me?

Minamo:
You see Rino, that's just how it is.
I can do whatever I want when I want to.
That's just the way it has always worked for me.

Rino:
But how can you be so selfish?!

Minamo:
So are you gonna try and stop me from having fun, Rino?

Rino:
Trying to stop you?
No! That's not what I'm trying to do!
But you shouldn't do things that can cause problems for other people!

Minamo:
I don't care about that.
Not as long as I'm having some fun.

Rino:
How could you...
How?
How could you say something like that?!

Minamo:
If you wanna hit me, go ahead and do it.

Minamo:
Go ahead and hit me!

Pucchan:
Do it! Hit her, kiddo!
Since she won't listen to what you're trying to tell her, you've got no choice but to hit her!

Rino:
No, Pucchan... I can't do it...
Even if it was just a weird coincidence that brought us together today,
I still wanna try to be your friend if that's okay with you.

So please... Don't be so... Selfish!

Rino:
What just happened?

Minamo:
Yay, lots of flashy lights! Awesome!

Pucchan:
Rino, you just set off the dormitory's self-destruct device.

Rino:
Whaaaaaaat?!

Minamo:
This is so much fun!
I knew that Best Student Council was gonna be a lot of fun, but this is better than I thought!

Rino:
This isn't the time to be talking about having fun...

Maachi:
Oh no...

Rino:
So that's how it happened.

Kanade:
I see. I'm glad that you told me the truth, Rino.
But let me get this straight.
The Best Student Council Dormitory was destroyed because you accidentally hit the self-destruct button?

Rino:
Yes, ma'am. That's exactly how it happened.

Pucchan:
Yeah, sorry about that.

Kanade:
You know... I feel like I've seen that girl before.

Nanaho:
Where are you? Come here!

Minamo:
Oh no!

Nanaho:
Don't run from me! I'll get you!

Hey, what is this? Stop! No!
What are you-- waaaaahhhh!

Sayuri:
My glasses... My glasses... My glasses... My glasses...

Mayura:
What's the matter with that little girl?

Sayuri:
My glasses!

Glasses... Glasses...

Kuon:
What in the world happened while we were gone?!

Cyndi:
Oh no...

Seina:
Miss President! Rino!

Rino:
I'm glad you're finally back, Seina.

Kanade:
Welcome back home, Kuon.

Kuon:
Miss President, are you okay?
What happened to the dormitory?

Rino:
You'd think it would be a really long story, Miss Vice President, but actually, it's not.

Kuon:
Then would you please start explaining, Rino?

Pucchan:
Well, that little brat over there caused this whole mess.

Minamo:
That was so cool, I had a blast today!

Seina:
What are you doing here, Minamo?

Minamo:
Hiya, Big Sis!

Kanade, Cyndi, Kuon:
What?

Rino:
You're Seina's little sister?!

Minamo:
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm Seina's little sister, Minamo Katsura.
It's nice to meet you, I'm sure we'll be the best of friends.

Kanade:
That's it! I just knew that I recognized you from somewhere.
I should have known it was you, Minamo.

Minamo:
Long time no see, Miss Kanade!
I know why you didn't recognize me, we haven't seen each other in three years!

Seina:
I hate to interrupt the reunion, but what are you doing here?

Minamo:
Isn't it obvious? I transferred!
As of tomorrow, I'm a student of Miyagami Academy!
And today I decided that I'm gonna join the Best Student Council!
I never thought it would be this much fun!
So when's your next meeting?

Rino:
She... She's staying here?



Seina:
Seina Katsura here.
The Best Student Council is having some financial difficulties.
Who's going to fix our financial woes? My little sister of course!
Next time on Best Student Council: "Desperately Poor Student Council"
Don't miss out on the drama!
