  Narrator:
At Miyagami Private Academy, there is a group of girls who have more power and authority than any of the faculty members.
Miyagami Academy Maximum Authority-Wielding Best Student Council.
Otherwise known as...

Best Student Council members:
Best Student Council!

-- OP --

Rino:
Dear Mr. Poppit,

It's been almost a year since Mom passed away from her illness.

Girl:
Hey!

Rino:
I was so surprised when I received your letter.
I never expected such kindness.
I can't believe that my penpal would take care of the enrollment procedures at Miyagami Academy for me!
I couldn't tell you this before, but I'm glad you did, 'cause I kinda ran out of savings.
I know this may sound sorta rude, but I hope you'll let me continue to depend on your financial kindness.
I'm transferring to Miyagami Academy! Thank you, Mr. Poppit!
I guess Miyagami Academy is somewhere over there!
I hope it's as amazing as I think it's gonna be.

Pucchan:
Gimme a break!
There's gotta be some kinda catch, Rino!
Hmph!

Rino:
Wait a minute!
What are you trying to say, Pucchan?

Pucchan:
You think it's normal for your penpal to pay for you to transfer schools?
He even set you up with an apartment!
It sounds like he wants something from ya!

Rino:
You really shouldn't talk like that about Mr. Poppit!
He happens to be a very nice man!

Pucchan:
Ha! I swear you women will trust anyone!
You're ALL hopeless!

Rino:
Oh, why are you so mean, Pucchan?

Pucchan:
I'm just trying to warn ya!

Rino:
But you don't have to be so mean!

Pucchan:
C'mon, Rino, listen to me for once!

Conductor:
Attention: This train will soon be arriving at Miyagami Academy.

Rino:
You are a mean, nasty creep!

Rino:
Wow, it's so big!
I'll be near the mountains and the ocean!
Awesome!
My name is Rino Rando, and I'm forever in your debt.

Pucchan:
Just who are you talking to?

Rino:
Come on, Pucchan, let's go see the apartment!

Pucchan:
Yeah, sure, if it exists.

Rino:
Don't be a party pooper!
I know it exists, 'cause Mr. Poppit took care of it for me!

Rino:
The apartment is... gone.

Pucchan:
More like burned to a crisp!

Rino:
What are we gonna do now?

Pucchan:
Like I know!

Rino:
Please help me!
The apartment I was supposed to move into today burned down!
And my wallet is as barren as the Antarctic wilderness.
And all my luggage was sent to the apartment in advance, so it all went up in flames!
I'm gonna have to spend my days wandering along the roadside and then camping in parks at night.
Oh! I don't wanna do that! I won't make it!
So please show me some cheap apartments!
Please! All I ask is that rent's not more than 20 bucks a month!
Can you help me?

Realtor:
Get outta here, kid.

Rino:
That figures...


Rino:
Now what am I gonna do?

Pucchan:
Rino, I think it's about time you got in touch with that Mr. Poppit guy.

Rino:
The problem is, he's just my penpal.
All I know is his mailing address, so...

Pucchan:
So you don't even have his phone number?

Rino:
I've never even seen a picture of him, Pucchan.

Pucchan:
Some guy ya don't know told you to come out here and you trusted him?!

Rino:
Well, yeah... there wasn't really anyone else I could rely on.
Ever since Mom passed away, you're the only one that's been around for me to depend on.
You know that.

Pucchan:
Man! Quit with the sob story already!
Why don't you go to the school and explain what happened?
I'm sure they'll let you spend the night there.

Rino:
Really? You think they'll let me?
Wow! Thank you, Pucchan!

Pucchan:
No worries, kiddo.
Now where is this Miyagami Academy?

Rino:
Let's see... on the map, it looks like it's... uh... I think that's it!

Pucchan:
So much for sleeping tonight.


Kanade:
Hello, this is Kanade.
How may I help you?

Seina:
Hello, Miss President.
I've finally located the... individual we've been tracking.
So, what would you like me to do now, ma'am?

Kanade:
Let's leave that matter to the Assault Squad.
Would you report this information to the vice-president?

Seina:
I knew it!
I thought you might say that, so I've already contacted her.

Kanade:
Thank you very much, Seina.
And what about the other matter?

Seina:
Right... actually, that matter has caused quite a bit of trouble.

Kanade:
Trouble?


Rino:
Hey, Pucchan, Miyagami Academy must really be something, huh?
I mean, I've never been to a school that has such a tough school route before!

Pucchan:
Why won't you just admit you're lost, kiddo?

Rino:
Ugh! Because I didn't want to accept such a harsh reality!

Pucchan:
Well, start accepting!

Rino:
What's... that?

What? What was that?

Pucchan:
Betcha it was a bear.

Rino:
A bear's no biggie.
I was kinda worried that it might be some kind of crazy pyromaniac who's trying to start a giant bush fire in the jungle coming our way!
Whoa! Not a BEAR!
NO!

Kaori:
This way!

Rino:
NOOOOO!

Kaori:
He's close!

Rino:
NOOOOOOOOOO!

Kaori:
What the...?

What's she doing out here?
Oh, no!
He got away.
Aw, man! Idiot!

Pucchan:
Rino! Pull yourself together, kiddo! Rino!

Rino:
Uh... I couldn't eat another bite...

Pucchan:
Ugh! You just got attacked!
This isn't the time to be sleeping!

Ayumu:
Huh?

Girl:
Oh my God, I hope she's all right.

Ayumu:
Hey guys, what's going on?

Girl:
Ayumu!

Girl:
A girl passed out over there!

Ayumu:
Excuse me, please!
Uh, sorry!
Coming through!

Hey there... Wake up, come on.
Wake up!
Are you okay?

Look, whatever I did, I'm really sorry!
Somebody... help me!

Rino:
Thank you so much.
Because of you, I'm gonna be all right.

Ayumu:
Somebody, PLEASE!
HELP ME!


Nanaho:
The new transfer student has become big news today.
Her name is Rino Rando. She's an 8th grader.
So why don't you tell me why you blew it yesterday? Kaori?

Kaori:
I'm terribly sorry.

Nanaho:
Was the assignment too much for a newbie to handle?

Kaori:
That's not it at all!
If I hadn't been distracted by other people, I would have caught him.

Nanaho:
What do you mean distracted?

Kaori:
Uh, I was just thinking aloud.

Nanaho:
It doesn't matter.
You see, I've decided to go ahead and give your mission to someone else.
Resume your normal routine.

Kaori:
What? But ma'am, I thought that--

Nanaho:
That's an order!

Kaori:
Yes, ma'am...

Nanaho:
Homeroom will be starting any minute.
Get to your classroom on the double.

Kaori:
Understood, ma'am...

Kaori:
This totally sucks!
That was my one chance to make a good impression!
And it's all because that idiot got in the way!
It's all because of her! That dirty, rotten, little...
YOU RUINED EVERYTHING!

Excuse me. I meant to say good morning.

Yukimi:
Hey, Kaori. You made it just in time.
We were just about to welcome the new transfer student to our class.
Why don't you introduce yourself to her?

Kaori:
Yeah, sure thing!
It's nice to meet you. I'm Kaori lzumi.

Rino:
I'm Rino Rando.

Pucchan:
Yo, Toots! The name's Pucchan.

Kaori:
What is that thing on your hand?

Rino:
He's my special friend.

Aah! Pucchan!



Yukimi:
All right, everyone.
I'd like you all to use this homeroom class to decide who will be your class representative for this semester.
Kaori, I'll leave the rest to you.

Kaori:
Thank you, ma'am.
Okay, listen up! It's time to select our class rep for this semester.

Eiko:
But we don't have to go through all that mess again.
I vote that we keep Kaori lzumi as our class representative!

Biiko:
I second the motion!

Kaori:
Thank you, ladies.
But if there's anyone else who'd like to announce their candidacy, please do so.
And in the event there are no other candidates, I will continue to serve as your class rep.
Is that okay with everyone?

Eiko and Biiko:
Works for us!

Kaori:
So if there's anyone else who'd like to announce her candidacy, please raise your hand.

Ayumu:
You don't have a place to live?

Rino:
No, my apartment burned down.

Pucchan:
Oh, and we're flat broke.

Ayumu:
Rino, that's horrible!

Rino:
Tell me about it.

Kaori:
Are there any other candidates for class rep?

Ayumu:
You know...

Kaori:
Well, if there are no other candidates, then I will gladly accept.

Are you announcing your candidacy?
But she just transferred to the school!

Rino:
Well, I, um...

Ayumu:
Of course!
I, Ayumu Oume, nominate Rino Rando!

Kaori:
That's very sweet of you, Ayumu.
But I'm not so sure she'd make a suitable class representative, since she just transferred and she doesn't know how things work around here.
It oughta be common sense, you big dummy!

Ayumu:
Sure, she may not know all the ropes, but everyone could help her out!
It may even help bring the whole class together!

Kaori:
Well, you certainly have a valid point...
I can unite the class just fine on my own!

Ayumu:
I've got a great idea, Kaori.
Why don't we vote on it?

Kaori:
Um... Okay, good idea.
Is it all right with the rest of you?

Everyone:
Yes!

Eiko and Biiko:
Fine with us!

Kaori:
You idiot! I was class representative all last year, and I'm a member of the Best Student Council.
You don't have a chance against me.
The little ditz said her name was Rino Rando, right?
Here's payback for yesterday, Rando.

Everyone:
WAAAAAAUGH!

Kaori:
But how?!

Eiko:
No way!

Biiko:
Rino?!

Kaori:
No! NO WAY!

Girls:
I totally voted for Kaori.
So did I.
Yeah, I did too.
Me too.
So how?!

Ayumu:
Go on! Go up there and address the class!

Rino:
Um, okay...

Pucchan:
Looks like I'm your class rep now, chickies.
At yer service!

Girls:
What's the matter with you?!

Yukimi:
Ooh! It's been decided that Miss Rino Rando is our new class representative.
Okay, Rino, here's the deal.

Rino:
Yes, ma'am?

Yukimi:
All class reps are to attend a meeting this afternoon, so go to the Best Student Council room after class, okay?

Rino:
The Best... Student Council?


Rino:
Um, you are...?

Ayumu:
Ayumu. Ayumu Oume.
But you can call me Ayu.

Rino:
Then I'll call you Ayu-chan.

Ayumu:
Cool, then I'll call you Rino.

Rino:
Sure. So, Ayu-chan, do you really think it's all right for me to be class representative?
I'm so pathetic, I don't even have a place to live.

Ayumu:
That's exactly the reason I nominated you in the first place, so you could get into the Best Student Council.

Rino:
The Best Student Council?
The teacher said something about that.

Ayumu:
Right! She was talking about Miyagami Academy's student council.
If you're chosen to become a member of the Best Student Council, you get to live in the student council's special housing.
The rent is free! Same goes for your meals.

Rino:
That's perfect!

Pucchan:
You've hit the jackpot!

Rino:
Mmm.

Ayumu:
As a class representative, you'll get the chance to meet the Best Student Council members.
And who knows, if they really like you, they may even ask you to join them!

Rino:
You think so?!

Ayumu:
You're very lucky, Rino.
They happen to have an opening for a secretary.

Rino:
Thank you, Ayu-chan!
I'm so happy!

Ayumu:
You don't have to get THAT excited about it...

Rino:
Oh, Ayu-chan!
I'm so glad you're my best friend!

Ayumu:
Since when am I your best friend?

Pucchan:
You'll have to forgive my daughter.
She's a little loony sometimes.

Ayumu:
You're her FATHER?!

Rino:
Oh, God! Thank you so much!

Eiko:
That totally sucks...

Biiko:
Oh, poor Kaori...

Rein:
Is lzumi here? You know, Kaori.
Is Kaori Izumi in here?
Time for work, gotta get going, time to move out!

Kaori:
Yeah, got it.


Newscaster:
This latest fire is the sixth act of arson in the last month.
Citizens are baffled as their homes and workplaces go up in flames.
Four buildings have been completely destroyed this month alone.

Kanade:
Come in.

Kuon:
Miss President, the class representatives are assembled.
We'll wait your formal address, ma'am.

Kanade:
Very well. I'll be there in just a second.
Kuon, before you go, I heard that the Attack Squad failed to capture the culprit yesterday.
And although this troubles me, I'm sure he will eventually fall into one of the Covert Squad's traps.
I think we should leave the rest to the Assault Squad.


Ayumu:
All you gotta do is go to the student council room and impress the president!
Now go get 'em, Rino!

Rino:
Yeah! I won't let you down!
But... where is the student council room?

Pucchan:
Snap out of it!

Rino:
Hey! That really hurt!

Pucchan:
I didn't raise you to be so dainty!

Rino:
Of course not, 'cause you didn't raise me at all!


Kuon:
Your attention, please.
Sorry to keep you waiting for so long.
My name is Kuon Ginga, and I'm vice-president of the Best Student Council.
And now, ladies, the Best Student Council's president, Ms. Kanade Jinguji will share a few words with you.

Kanade:
Hello, everyone. Welcome.
I'm Kanade Jinguji, and I am the president of the Best Student Council.
Oh, Kuon. That girl isn't here.

Kuon:
"That" girl? Which one?

Kanade:
Representative Rino Rando...


Kaori:
Where is Sayuri? Do you know, Rein?

Rein:
She pressed on, she pushed forward, and she went ahead to the area where the Covert Squad set their traps!
She should be in contact with the culprit very soon!

Sayuri:
I thought I'd run into you.
And just what do you think you're doing?

Don't try to run!

Rino:
So, uh... where is the student council room?

Pucchan:
It's not outside!

Rino:
I'm sorry!
Huh?

Sayuri:
Oh, no... Where are my glasses?
Glasses... Glasses...

Rino:
Did you lose your glasses?
I'll help you look.

Uh, um, I'm so sorry!
I'll go get them fixed right away!

Rein:
This is terrible! Sayuri failed to stop him!

Kaori:
Just leave it up to me!

So, we meet again.
You're not getting away from--

Rino:
I'm sorry!

Kaori:
Watch where you--
IT'S YOU AGAIN?!

Rino:
Um... what do you mean?


Mayura:
Nanaho!
You really shouldn't be using the car without the president's permission!

Nanaho:
That's true, but the Assault Squad has been authorized to act autonomously in times of emergency.

Mayura:
Please, just don't wreck it!
Promise me that much.

Nanaho:
I can't make any promises.

Mayura:
Come on!

Nanaho:
You ready?

Cyndi:
Yes, ma'am.


Kuon:
Miss President, what are we going to do about the agenda?

Kanade:
If you don't mind, I'd prefer not to worry about that today.
Thank you.

Seina:
Miss President, shall I show you to the scene?


Rein:
Hey! To the right!
The hand you hold your chopsticks with!

Kaori:
But I'm left-handed!
Why are you chasing me?!

Rino:
My mom always told me to help out people who are in trouble!

Kaori:
You're the reason I'm in trouble!

Rino:
Watch out!

Not again!
He's getting away!

Nanaho:
I've had about enough of you, pyromaniac.
I'm not gonna let you cause any more trouble.
I am the Best Student Council's vice-president, Nanaho Kinjo!


Pucchan:
Anyone who tries to hurt this kid is gonna have to deal with me first!
Now this is what I call justice! You feel that, buddy?
That's not unnecessary violence, it's the glory of justice!
You're finally getting what you deserve, pal!
Feel the burn!

Nanaho:
Wh-What was that?

Rein:
She was like talking all cool and stuff.

Cyndi:
Awesome...


Kanade:
Hey there. Wake up.

Rino:
Wow...
What a pretty lady...
You know, she kinda looks like my mom.

Kanade:
Are you feeling all right?

Rino:
Um, well... yeah.
Thank you.

But what's... going on?

Kanade:
They were kind enough to tell me what happened today.
Your bravery is quite impressive, Miss Rino Rando.

Rino:
How do you know my name?

Kanade:
Ladies, I would like to elect Miss Rino Rando as a secretary of the Best Student Council.
Is there anyone who disagrees with me?

Kuon:
That's a brilliant idea.
Miss Rando's abilities are outstanding.

Nanaho:
True.
Though I don't understand the whole puppet thing, I can't deny that her moves are excellent.

Rino:
Um, I... thank you...

Kanade:
Miss Rino Rando, I welcome you to the Best Student Council.

Rino:
The Best... Student Council?

Kanade:
That's right.

Rino:
Um, okay...

Pucchan:
Happy to join you, pretty lady!

Nanaho:
Welcome to the group, Rando.
Now, I've got a question I've been meaning to ask: What's up with that puppet you've always got on your hand?

Rino:
He's my special friend.
Ah! Pucchan!
Are you okay, Pucchan?

Pucchan:
I'm still kicking.

Rino:
Pucchan!

Dear Mr. Poppit, I'm so glad you helped me transfer to Miyagami Academy.
There are so many really awesome girls doing some really awesome stuff!
I think I'm gonna like it here, 'cause it's... really awesome!


Newscaster:
The suspect in the serial arson cases that have flooded the city this month has been taken into police custody.
The suspect is Hirofumi Ijuuin, age 31.
The police will now be conducting a thorough investigation into...

Sayuri:
Oh, where're my glasses?
I need my glasses...
Glasses, glasses, glasses...

-- ED --

Rino:
This is Rino Rando.
I've just been inducted into the Best Student Council.
Now they're having a welcoming party for me.
But wait till you see the uninvited guest that shows up!
Next time on Best Student Council: "Gushing Youth."
What does youth gush?
I don't know, but it sounds gross!
