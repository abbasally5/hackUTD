  Rino:
Whenever I think of my mother, I'm surrounded by the smell of orange osmanthus.

Rino:
Mama!

Pucchan:
What's up, kiddo?

Rino:
Pucchan!

Rino:
I remember happy times...
And I remember sad times...

Rino:
Mom! No!
Please don't die, Mom!
Mom, please!
Please don't leave me all alone!

Pucchan:
Don't forget, you've got me, Rino.

Rino:
Hm?

Pucchan:
Kiddo, no matter what happens, you're never gonna be alone.

Rino:
You can't even talk if my mom doesn't do it for you!
She is why you speak!

Pucchan:
Ah, come on! Don't say that.
Rino, your mother is at peace right now.
She knows that you'll be okay because you're a strong young woman.

Rino:
But that's not... That's not true, Pucchan!

Pucchan:
Rino...

Rino:
Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom!

Chieri:
I feel amazing!

Rino:
But Mom, are you sure that you're okay?

Chieri:
Yeah, I feel good!

Rino:
Yay!

Pucchan:
I'm feeling pretty awesome, too!

Rino:
Awesome!

Chieri:
We should have sukiyaki to celebrate my recovery!

Pucchan:
Sounds great!

Rino:
Yay for sukiyaki!

Rino, Pucchan:
Sukiyaki! Sukiyaki! Sukiyaki! Sukiyaki!


Rino:
It's kinda strange...
I always used to cry when I would remember my mom.
But this time, it's different.
The smell of orange osmanthus... it's so sweet and...

Kanade:
Good morning.

Rino:
Huh?
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat?

Maachi:
Huh?

Nanaho:
What was that?

Kuon:
That was certainly a deafening scream.

Rein:
Shut up! Quiet down!
You're disturbing my sleep!

Sayuri:
My glasses...

Seina:
Well, it must have been Rino screaming like that.

Mayura:
But why would she be...

Rino:
I'm really sorry about that, Miss President.

Kanade:
It's alright, Rino.
I would never want you to hold back.
You're very important to me.

Rino:
Thank you very much, Miss President.

Seina:
Wow, looks like Rino and the president have really hit it off.

Mayura:
Hold on, something suspicious is going on...
Oh, I've heard this... phenomenon happens all the time in all-girl schools!
I'm afraid it's...

Rein:
Girls on girls! Girls on girls!
Girls on other girls!

Seina:
Oh, Rein.

Mayura:
Since when are you...

Rein:
Did you see that?

Sayuri
No, I can't see.


Kanade:
Thank you very much, Miss Hisakawa.

Rino:
Well, thanks a lot!

Kanade:
Now, let's eat.

Rino:
Yeah! It looks great!

Pucchan:
Thanks for the grub!

Nanaho:
But that can't be true...
The president came out of Rando's room this morning?

Rein:
You're correct, it's a fact, and it's the truth!

Kuon:
Well, Miss President sure gets around, doesn't she?

Sayuri:
No, she's in the corner.

Seina:
They get along so well.

Nanaho:
Maybe she went in there this morning to wake Rando up.
Rando may need help 'cause she's not used to this place yet.

Mayura:
But has the president ever done something like that for anyone else before?

Kuon:
You've got a point.
Regardless of whatever happened in that room, I'm afraid it's undeniable that the president has special feelings toward Miss Rando.

Rein:
Finally we're alone, you and I.
One forbidden night!

Nanaho:
That's enough, now cut it out!
Everyone listen carefully.
Until I get the whole story from the president, no one is allowed to talk about this subject, so don't let the other students know!

Rein:
What?

Nanaho:
Understood, Rein?

Rein:
Yes, roger, understood!

Cyndi:
Thank you.


Kaori:
NO WAAAAAAY!
That can't be true...
The president...

Cyndi:
It's true.

Kaori:
The president... Miss Kanade...
The president went to Rino Rando's room and did the "payapaya" with her?!

Girls:
Miss Kanade did what?
She was in Rino's room doing the payapaya?
What's the payapaya?
The payapaya! You know what it is!

Rino, Kanade:
Paya, paya!

Girl:
No! That's gross!

Kaori:
I think we should all go find Rino Rando and question her!

Girls:
Yeah!

Cyndi:
Do you need me to help you up, Kaori?

Kaori:
That's okay...


Ayumu:
Rino, get outta here!

Rino:
What's the matter, Ayu-chan?

Ayumu:
I'm not sure what's going on, but everyone's looking for you and-

Girls:
Miss Rino Rando!
Would you come with us, please?

Rino:
Eh? Uh, what?!

Pucchan:
She ain't going with ya.

Girl:
What did you just say?!

Pucchan:
I said she's not going with ya!
Don't make me hurt you!
Listen, I'm a puppet who won't hold back!
I don't care if you're a bunch of little girls!

Ayumu:
Pucchan's... so cool.


Girls:
Hey, did you hear the news?
President Kanade and that new girl secretary Rino Rando were doing the "payapaya" in the Best Student Council dormitory!
No! I can't believe it!

I wanna be payapaya-ed too someday!
Me, too!

Yukimi:
Wow, who'd have thought Rino Rando was so brave?


Nanaho:
How?
How did this happen to us?
Rein!

Rein:
It wasn't me! Not me! I swear I didn't!

Kuon:
The most important thing we can do right now is try and figure out how we're going to deal with this.

Seina:
That's true.
We don't want either one of them to get into any trouble.

Mayura:
Nanaho, it may be a little late.

Nanaho:
What?

Kanade:
Then, you take this side like this.

Rino:
Wow, awesome!

Pucchan:
You're pretty good with your hands.

Nanaho:
They're doing Lilian...

Seina:
Oh, the memories...

Mayura:
How old is the president anyway?

Kuon:
Hey guys, look there.

Mayura:
Kaori...

Nanaho:
She's lost it.

Mayura:
Oh, no. Look over there.

Nanaho:
The photography club?!

Seina:
And it looks like...
Members of the school newspaper are on the other side.

Mayura:
Ah! The paparazzi club is here, too!

Kuon:
That makes sense.
I bet they're here to try and get the scoop on the president.
Their stealth is quite impressive.

Seina:
The president is so popular, if they get some juicy pictures, they can sell them.

Nanaho:
We won't let them get away with this!
Assault Squad, do whatever it takes to keep them from taking pictures of them together!

Rein:
Yeah!

Sayuri:
Understood, ma'am!

Nanaho:
Oh, man. We've had nothing but trouble since Rando got here.

Seina:
It's pretty fun, though.

Kuon:
Yeah. At least we're never bored around here.


Rino:
Oh, it's Sayuri.

Kanade:
Did you want something?

Sayuri:
Look, a UFO.

Rino:
A UFO?!

Pucchan:
All I see are birds.

Kanade:
An unidentified flying object?

Rino:
Ah!

Kanade:
Well, I can't seem to find it...
Are you sure that it was there?
Rino?
Oh my...


Rein:
We've detained, captured, and confined her!

Nanaho:
Roger that.
Stay there and monitor the dormitory.
Do not allow Rando to have any contact with the president.

Rein:
Understood.

Kuon:
Nanaho. According to the Covert Squad, the photo club, the newspaper club, and the paparazzi club have all moved into action independently.

Nanaho:
And we know exactly what they're after.

Kuon:
Right.

Seina:
They wanna catch the president and Rino...

Nanaho:
...doing the payapaya together...
They want their scoop.

Rino:
Sukiyaki... Sukiyaki... Sukiya...



Miura:
Welcome to the newspaper club's meeting room.
I'm Miura, leader of the school newspaper club.
My dear members of the photography club and the paparazzi club.
There's a very important reason that I have called our rival clubs together for this meeting today.
We should work together to expose the private life of... the Best Student Council's president, the illustrious Kanade Jinguji!
So are you guys with us or not!

Photography club members:
I don't know, I mean, they are the Best Student Council.
They're totally out of our league.
You never know what they might do if they caught us.

Miura:
How can you give up like that?
What do you think your cameras are for?
Their sole purpose is to capture the truth onto film!
If we work together, we can be the seekers of the truth!

Paparazzi club members:
That's interesting...
I think we should do it!
Any photos we could get of Miss Kanade privately should fetch a pretty good price.
This would be an excellent opportunity to show the school our talents.

Miura:
Thank you so much, members of the paparazzi club!
You are indeed seekers of the truth!
You are the few who truly deserve to hold cameras!

Photography club members:
Isn't this Miura chick a member of President Kanade's fan club?
I bet she's jealous!
The only thing she wants to know is if Rino Rando was really doing the payapaya with her beloved Miss Kanade!

Miura:
Excuse me, ladies!
Now tell me, will you help us seek the truth?

Photography club members:
Yeah, we'll help you.


Kanade:
I see... So the photography club, the paparazzi club, and the newspaper club...
I had no idea that going into Rino's room yesterday would cause so many problems for everyone.

Nanaho:
Ma'am, I think it would be a good idea to restrict their actions, using the maximum authority of the student council.

Kanade:
But we can't do that.
We have a free press here.

Nanaho:
But this is a complete invasion of privacy.

Kanade:
Nanaho...
I want the students of Miyagami to be free and never to feel that they're being restricted.
I mean, that's the reason that I...

Nanaho:
...founded the academy, right?
Somehow, I knew that's exactly what you'd say.
But Miss...

Kanade:
What is it?

Nanaho:
I have a question, for Kanade Jinguji and not the president.
Please, tell me why you went into Rino Rando's room last night.

Kanade:
Uh...

Nanaho:
You won't even tell me, Kanade?

I understand.
As the vice-president, I'll do whatever I can.
I'll do my best to protect your reputation.
But please, just try and lay low in your dorm today, okay?

Kanade:
I'll do that. Nanaho, I'm sorry.

Nanaho:
It's alright. I mean, after all, it was my own choice for things to be this way.

Kaori:
Payapaya...

Nanaho:
Snap out of it, Kaori!
Don't forget our mission as members of the Assault Squad!

Kaori:
Yes, ma'am!

Nanaho:
They're on their way.


Seina:
I finally heard from the entire Covert Squad.
They finished setting their traps.

Kuon:
Thank you, Seina.

Mayura:
The budget... The budget...

Seina:
Tonight's going to be an eventful night!

Kuon:
President Kanade has been getting uncomfortably close to Rino Rando...
But I don't think it's just sympathy for a girl who has no family.
There must be another reason behind her obsession.
What could it be?

Seina:
Penny for your thoughts, Kuon.

Kuon:
Oh, I was just daydreaming.

Seina:
You know, the president doesn't have any hidden agendas.

Kuon:
Just what do you mean by that?

Seina:
I'm sure you can figure it out.

Nanaho:
Kuon, how are things coming with the Covert Squad?

Kuon:
Everyone is ready to go.

Nanaho:
It's about that time.

Kuon:
Yes it is.


Kaori:
Payapaya...


Nanaho:
And so the war begins...

Mayura:
What's that horrible noise?
Wh-What kinda traps are those?

Kuon:
We set up a high-tech motion detector so that when motion is detected, it makes a loud noise.

Seina:
It's an ordinary trap you'd find anywhere!

Mayura:
But, what's with all the red flashing lights?

Kuon:
We're just playing around with our new light system.

Mayura:
Then where is all that smoke coming from?

Seina:
We wanted to make it as realistic as possible!

Mayura:
Where'd you get all this fancy equipment?
Don't tell me...

Seina:
Yeah. We used some of the budget!

Mayura:
I'm begging you! Don't ignore me anymore! I'm the treasurer!


Photography club member:
More than half of the decoys have been taken out!

Miura:
Impressive, Best Student Council.

Nanaho:
All enemies are concentrated on the left side of the dormitory.
No, wait! The other side!

Cyndi:
I got it.


Sayuri:
Back off!

Kuon:
The boiler room.
Intruders are coming up from the sewers!

Nanaho:
Rein!

Rein:
Don't come near me, you idiots! Get away!

Nanaho:
Rein, what happened? Are you all right?

Kuon:
Now they're coming in through the rear entrance.

Kaori:
I can take care of them!

Kaori:
Sorry, but I'm in a terrible mood today, ladies!
So you don't wanna make me any angrier!

Paparazzi club member:
Uh, yeah...

Kaori:
Vice-President!

Nanaho:
Don't let your guard down, Kaori!

Sayuri:
So do you wanna keep going?

Paparazzi club members:
No, we've had enough.
I'm so sorry.

Cyndi:
Good job.

Nanaho:
Kuon, our forces have split up.
Please confirm the president's safety.

Seina:
Okay, I'll go check on her.

Miura:
I have a package here to deliver.

Maachi:
Thank you very much for coming.

Nanaho:
What's up?

Seina:
Hello! We have a little problem.
The president isn't in her dorm room.

Nanaho:
What?
Then let's check Rando's room on the double!

Nanaho:
We have to separate them before the enemy discovers them!

Seina:
Hey, everyone!


Rino:
Sukiyaki!

Pucchan:
Sing it, babe!

Rino:
Sukiyaki!

Pucchan:
Oh, yeah!

Rino, Pucchan:
I like sukiyaki!

Nanaho:
Uh, what are you doing in here?

Kanade:
We were just about to have dinner.

Mayura:
Do you understand the severity of the situation right now?
If any of those crazy journalists or paparazzi see you here...

Miura:
Gotcha!
Give peace a chance!

Rino, Kanade:
Peace!

Miura:
I've finally got it!
Now they'll know the truth about Kanade Jinguji and her sukiyaki date with an underclassman!
But that means the rumors are all true...
You two have been doing... the payapaya...
I mean, as a member of the school newspaper club, I'm thrilled!
But personally, this makes me sad!
Miss Kanade!

Kuon:
Now the rumors are going to get even worse, aren't they?

Nanaho:
President, your actions have caused us much trouble.

Kanade:
Did I do something wrong?
I'm sorry that I've caused you trouble, but I really don't understand why.

Mayura:
How could you not know, president?
We've gone to a lot of trouble to protect you and Rando and here you are together!

Kanade:
What's the matter?
Is there a problem with me being in my own room?

Nanaho:
In your own room?
What?

They're sharing a room?!

Kuon:
When did that happen?

Kanade:
This room belongs to both Rino and myself.
So there should be no problem with the two of us being together.

Rino:
President, can I start eating some of the meat?

Kanade:
Of course.

Rino:
Yay! Thanks for the food!
Wow, this is so yummy, Miss President!

Kanade:
Eat as much as you like.

Rino:
Let's stuff our faces, Pucchan!

Pucchan:
Oh yeah! Time to chow down!

Nanaho:
Uh... Now, you know... Uh...
So, as you can see, it's no big deal, Miura.
We have very few empty rooms here, so the president and Rando are sharing a room.
That's all there is to it, despite the rumors, there's nothing inappropriate going on.

Miura:
Is that true?

Kuon:
Yeah, nothing newsworthy here.

Seina:
Nothing going on at all.

Mayura:
Yup, there's nothing funny going on around here.

Miura:
Oh, I'm so glad! That's great!
Just like I always thought, Miss Kanade IS noble!
I'm glad!

Seina:
Hey guys, here's an idea if you don't mind.
You could write a story denying any unpleasant rumors about the president in the next school paper.

Kuon:
We'll make an exception this once and allow you to use the photo you just took.

Miura:
Of course I'll write it! I'd love to!
It would make me so happy!


Kaori:
No waaaaaaaaaaay!

Nanaho:
What's the matter, Kaori?

Kaori:
Vice-President, Rino Rando and President Kanade are staying in the same dorm room!

Nanaho:
They're just sharing a room.
Like it says in the article, there's nothing inappropriate going on.

Kaori:
But, what if something happens in the future, Vice-President?

Nanaho:
You're overthinking things.


Rino:
Mom...

Kanade:
It's okay. I'm here with you, Rino.

Rino:
I miss you...

Kaori:
Please rest assured, Chieri.
Your daughter, Rino... I promise I'll...
And you, too...

Rino:
I can smell the orange osmanthus.
It's so calming, nostalgic, and so very...



Kaori:
Hey guys, it's Kaori.
That weird puppet, that ditsy girl, her pig-tailed friend, and I are going to help solve an incident that occurred on the Assault Squad's watch.
Next time on Best Student Council: "A Brilliantly Clever Approach"
Look forward to the Best solution!
