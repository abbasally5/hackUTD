Tamaki: Long live the Black Knights. Hip, hip, hooray!



Kallen: What happened to that Knightmare? The one that saved Zero.

C.C: It escaped using a route Xingke gave us.

Lelouch: Xingke?

Kallen: The Chinese Federation guy I mentioned.

Lelouch: I see. Then I'll be sure to make use of that route as well.

Kallen: So was that pilot the same one from Babel Tower?

Lelouch: Because of what happened to Urabe, I won't tell you his name. Simply think of him as a person who supports our cause.

C.C: You didn't use your Geass on him, did you?

Lelouch: As it turned out I didn't need to. Anyway, C.C., about the Emperor...

Kallen: Now wait a minute. You'll keep the pilot a secret from me?

Lelouch: So what? There're times when I like to keep secrets, too.

Kallen: Are you speaking as Zero or Lelouch right now?

Lelouch: It's not as if everyone knows about our relationship, do they.

Kallen: Stop saying weird stuff like that, all right?

C.C: And your true identity? Kallen and I are the only ones among the group who know who you really are.

Lelouch: That's secret, too.

Kallen: Lelouch, do you still want me to be the captain of Zero's personal forces I have been?

Lelouch: I do.

Kallen: Understood. I'll consider that. Roger and out.

Lelouch: I'm counting on you now.

C.C: We'll talk about Geass later. There are more pressing matters.

Lelouch: Very well. I catch your drift.



Sugiyama: Here it is. Man, I 've missed my old uniform.

Tamaki: Rock'n'roll!

The Black Knights: I can't believe they had all this ready for us.

The Black Knights: They say Captain Kouzuki and Urabe arranged it.

The Black Knights: Oh, man.

Tohdoh: Oh, I see. And you say Urabe died well?

Kallen: Yes.

Asahina: You should just confess already.

Chiba: What do you mean by "confess"?

The Black Knights: It's Zero.

Chiba: Hold it, hold it. While we appreciate you rescuing us, Zero, we wouldn't have been captured in the first place, if you hadn't betrayed us the way you did.

Asahina: Don't you owe us an explanation?

Ohgi: What happened? We deserve to know.

Lelouch: Everything is for victory over Britannia.

Tamaki: Okay. Go on.

Lelouch: That's all.

Asahina: Huh? Nothing more to say? No apologies? No excuses?

Tohdoh: Stop it. Zero, were your actions intended to give us a chance of winning?

Lelouch: I'm always focused on getting results.

Tohdoh: I understand. At times, our operations must be kept secret. Right now, we need to rely on his power. I can think of no one more capable than Zero to be our leader.

Ohgi: I agree. We should all trust Zero.

Minami: But Zero treated you as if you were nothing more than a pawn.

Ohgi: Who other than Zero could have pulled this off. Even the Chinese Federation isn't strong enough to wage war on Britannia. And the E.U. continues to lose to Prince Schneizel, doesn't it. We are the last hope out of all the areas Britannia has colonized. Zero is the only one who can lead us to victory in our war of independence.

Tamaki: Ohgi is right! Zero! Zero! Zero! Zero!

The Black Knights: Zero! Zero! Zero!

---------- [OP]

Suzaku: Hello, everyone. My name is Suzaku Kururugi and I'll be returning to classes here at Ashford Academy starting today. I look forward to studying here.

Student: Suzaku Kururugi?

Student: The guy who caught Zero?

Student: The white death is coming to school here?

Student: He is the Knight of Seven.

Student: But he is an Eleven.

Student: Doesn't matter. He is the Emperor's immediate subordinate...

Villetta: Okay, quiet down. Sir Kururugi has been reassigned to Area 11 and that's why he's coming back to school here. Why don't you take the desk next to Lelouch for now.

Suzaku: Yes, ma'am.

Lelouch: Suzaku. You... You were my first real friend.

Suzaku: But the war tore us apart.

Lelouch: The Second Pacific War, the conflict in which Britannia took control of Japan.

Suzaku: After its defeat, Japan became an area colony of Britannia.

Lelouch: I, who was abandoned by my homeland.

Suzaku: I, who was forced to abandon my homeland.

Lelouch: When we reunited, we were at once enemies and allies.

Suzaku: Although I was Japanese, I was also a Britannian soldier.

Lelouch: I was Zero. We both hid our true identities.

Suzaku: We fought each other.

Lelouch: However, those are memories of what really happened.

Suzaku: The Emperor rewrote three things in Lelouch's memory.

Lelouch: Nunnally.

Suzaku: Anything about Zero.

Lelouch: That I was a prince of the royal family of Britannia.

Lelouch&Suzaku: And so, the two of us now...

Lelouch: Hey, welcome back. It's been some time.

Suzaku: I missed everyone a lot.

Lelouch: Suzaku, feels like forever.

Rivalz: You've really come up in the world, haven't you?

Milly: Suzaku's back? Where is he?

Lelouch: Madam President, class is in progress, you mind?

Milly: Oh what's with you, Lelouch?

Lelouch: You screwed up Suzaku. When you heard the name,"Lelouch", you just walked right to my side. In other words, you acted as if you knew me. Now to make sure Rolo doesn't do anything stupid...

Shirley: And so everybody up and left except us. They all went back home. Even the teachers.

Suzaku: Back to the homeland?

Lelouch: Yeah and that's the reason why we're the only ones here at school who know you, right Rolo?

Rolo: R-Right.

Suzaku: That explains why I don't recognize anyone here.

Rivalz: Hey you saw Zero's face, didn't you? So what did he look like?

Milly: Is he really a girl?

Rivalz: It's really Prince Clovis, right?

Shirley: Or a prince from another country?

Suzaku: Um...well...

Lelouch: Can't you share that with us?

Suzaku: No, it's a military secret. I'm sorry...

Milly: Arthur?!

Shirley: Oh, you brought him with you?!

Lelouch: Well, Suzaku, you really have a thing for cats, don't you.



Villetta: Did anything leap out at you during your contact with him?

Suzaku: No, not especially.

Villetta: Then we can conclude that the subject's memories haven't returned.

Suzaku: Wait just a minute. Please, I feel we have to investigate this further.

Rolo: Do you mean you don't trust our surveillance?

Suzaku: There's also the matter of C.C. Continue playing his little brother just the way you have been.

Rolo: All right, my lord.

Villetta: It seems the student council is planning to throw you a welcoming party. Please reconfirm his state then.

Suzaku: Yes, understood.

Rolo: What should I do? Do I dare trust Lelouch?



Lelouch: Teacher, could you please overlook all the campus infractions that Rolo and I are involved in?

Teacher: Very well. I can do that. Just don't wander off school ground so often, you two.

Lelouch& Rolo: Yes, sir.

Lelouch: The only member left now is Miss Villetta, right?

Rolo: Correct. But Suzaku Kururugi is here now. Shall I kill him?

Lelouch: You shouldn't behave like that. Oh, and something else.

Rolo: Yes?

Lelouch: Can you quit speaking to me in such a formal manner? After all, we are supposed to be brothers. Don't worry. I'll hurry up with my plan for your sake, as well. I am going to do it. Independence for Japan will begin with this school.



Edgar: Iwate... Wakayama... Tokushima...

Cloudio: There are reports from Yamaguchi, too.

Edgar: Hmpf! Zero makes an appearance again and now we get this.

Cloudio: It may be an effect of Lord Guilford's absence, too.

Edgar: If this keeps up, our Sakuradite supply will also be...

Announce: Emergency! Unknown M.R.F. within the perimeter.

Cloudio: What is it?

Edgar: No way. This government bureau controls all of Area 11.

Gino: Hahaha. Getting in here couldn't have been easier. These guys are almost annoyingly sloppy. Is this the best line of defense that Area 11's got to offer? Ah-ha, perhaps I was being a bit hasty.

Cloudio: I don't know who you are. But this ends right here.
