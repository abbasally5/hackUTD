  [Origami Tobiichi was blacked out, because she choked by one of Kurumi's clones. Perhaps, it might also because she was so excited she finally found the perpetrator who killed her parents long time ago, the ultimate target of her vengeance. Kotori floated above the school roof, several frame rings turning around her]

Shido:
No way, it...can't be...

Kurumi:
If you think your flame's gonna scare me, you're wrong.

[Kurumi summoned again her Angel, the large clock]

Kurumi:
Because, you're not the only one with a cool toy.

--- OP ---

Narration:
Spirits are not human beings.
And, human beings are certainly not Spirits.
Even though they have some similarities, their difference is abound.
Poor Shido, he's far more than slightly confused.

---

Kurumi:
Ah ha ha ha...
Ha ha...Now then, how about you and I engage a little bit of Spirits in competition?

[Her pistol sucked the power which oozed out from the letter "I" on the clock face, and shot herself. Next moment, she fall from the sky, warped from the roof space ground, and attacked Kotori]

Kotori:
Uh.

[Kotori blocked the bullet shot by Kurumi's long rifle, with using the haft of her broad axe. And, she dodged consecutive attacks from Kurumi]

Kurumi:
Is this really the best you can do?
I have to say, I'm unimpressed.
You can call more the Angel and command flame, surly you can bemaul on me, can't you?
Or, well, guess not?

Kotori:
Why don't you keep mouth shut?!
You're lot cuter when you're not talking!
Wraah!

[Kotori brought down her broad axe. It emitted the large amount of flame. But, Kurumi dodged it easily]

Kurumi:
Well, I happen to think you would be a lot cuter with your pretty little head mounted on my wall!
Zafkiel, Zayin!

[Kurumi's pistol sucked the power from the clock. and shot Kotori two times]

Shido:
Guys, stop it! Please!

[Kotori parried the bullet, but her time stopped by the effect of Kurumi's shot]

Kurumi:
It must really suck to be you right now...
Frozen in time and completely surrounded.

[Seven or more Kurumi's clones appeared around Kotori, began their shot. It should make Kotori be honeycombed]

Kurumi:
Oh, well, bye-bye flame girl...

[Lastly, Kurumi who seemed the head of all those clones pushed her pistol's nozzle to frozen Kotori's head, pulled the trigger. Just then, Kotori's time recovered to flow]

Kurumi:
Heh heh heh...
A point blank shot to the noggin, that'll sure dump in your spare the day.[?]
It really is too bad.
I was actually starting to enjoy her...And now, she's dead.

[Kotori laid on the ground, gun smoke arose from the middle of her forehead]

Kurumi:
Now, but that's settled.
You're on death, Shido?
Let's have a little fun...uh?

[The flame emerged on Kotori, made her wounds disappear. It was the same flame once healed Shido from Origami's shot]

Kotori:
Man, I'm looking always get the bad guy in trouble.
Not part in your plan?
If you'd rather tuck your tail between your legs, and run on home to mommy, I completely understand.

Kurumi:
Ha! Not in your widest dreams, flame girl!
Raah!
...Aleph!

[Kurumi summoned the clock, and her enchanted gun shot Other Kurumi's clones to accelerate their time]

Kurumi:
Heh...

[First, Kurumi tried to attack Shido. Kotori kicked him away]

Shido:
Gwah!
...What are you doing?!

[Then all Kurumis swooped down upon Kotori. Kotori swung her broad axe]

Kotori:
Cut her the pieces, Camael!

[The explosion from the axe wasted all Kurumis surrounding around her]

Kurumi:
Damn you!
Come Zafkiel, Dalet!

[Kurumi shot herself, rewinding her time to heal her wound]

Kotori:
Oh, come on! Don't give up on me already!
You can't quit just when your opponent is warmed up. It's bad form!

Kurumi:
I promise you this...you'll be sorry you ever decided mess with me!
Zaaafkieeeel!

Kotori:
Yeah?! Show me what you've got!
...Eh?!

[Kotori felt sudden giddiness, sank down to the ground]

Kotori:
Ew...what's happening...?

Shido:
Kotori!

Kurumi:
Eh, hah ha ha ha...!
You looks like your devils luck has run out?

Shido:
Ugh...Kotori! Are you alright?!

[Shido staggered to approach to Kotori. When Kotori raised her face up, it was completely changed from her usual ones, utter evil. her pupils were opened wide, an the eyes were now glowed in red]

Kotori:
Camael, Megiddo!

[With her shout, her weapon changed its form. Its head were hid into its haft, a large nozzle hole was made on its top. It looks now more like a canon. The cannon began sucking flames which emitted from Kotori. Kurumi instinctively felt this attack was more powerful than any attacks from Kotori, ordering her clones to protect her]

Kurumi:
Rolling to me immediately!

[All remained clones gathered in front of Kurumi]

Kotori:
Turn them all to ashes!
Do it! Camael!

[The cannon shot the blast of the flame. The flame erased all Kurumi's clones. Only one Kurumi remained, and sat down on the ground. The part of concrete surface of the roof space, where the blast grazed, was melt in heat and glowed red like magma. There was a large hole on Zafkiel's clock face. Kurumi was barely averted the blast from her by using all her other clones]

Kurumi:
Ugh...

Kotori:
Pick up your weapon! This fight's not over yet! And, the war's not over yet, either!
Well, come on then!
Let's have some more that destruction you love so much!
This is about you wanted! This is the war you wanted, isn't it?!

Kurumi:
...

Kotori:
If you can't face the muzzle of a gun anymore, it's over.
Time for you to die.

Shido:
Kotori! If you keep pushing like this, she will die!
Isn't the point of Ratatoskr to solve all conflicts without killing Spirits?!

[Kotori didn't hear Shido's voice. The cannon began to suck Kotori's flame, being ready to next shot]

Shido:
You have to stop!

Kotori:
Heh heh...

[Kotori made evil smirk on her face. She looked really enjoying to kill her opponent. Shido ran to Kurumi's side]

Shido:
Stay back!

[Shido stood in front of Kurumi, opened his arms to protect her]

Kurumi:
No...don't...!
Please...!

[Kotori unchanged her attitude until the charge of her cannon finished. At the last moment, she recognized that Shido stood to block her blast from Kurumi. But, it was too late to cancel the blast, the blaze of Camael's Megiddo shot out to Shido and Kurumi]

Kotori:
Big brother! Look out!

[The flame rushed on Shido. He lost his consciousness]

---

[While he wandered between life and death, he heard a little girl crying nearby him. They were surrounded by flames. The girl wore the robe of feathers which was the same Kotori wore earlier, so it might be the image of her childhood]

Kotori:
(Sob, sob) Big brother...

---

Yoshinon:
Would you like me to operate?

Yoshino:
Yes, please...
Thank you, doctor.

[Shido opened his eyes. His first sight was Yoshinon's red eye and its eye patch]

Yoshinon:
Oh! ready then!
Nurse! Please hand me my scalpel!
Hah...hah...hah...!

Shido:
...

Yoshino:
Oh...I was playing doctor...
Sorry...

Shido:
You're fine.

Yoshino:
Eh...um...

[Yoshino left from the room. Tohka was sat at the other side of Shido's bed. She fell her head on the bed, then fell into sleep. Shido sat up on the bed]

Shido:
Tohka...? She's here, too?
Hmm...Why am I in the sickbed?

[Reine appeared at Shido's sickroom]

Reine:
Well, you're awake. That's good.

Yoshinon:
Looks like the anesthesia didn't work!
Good thing, you woke up before I cut you open!

Yoshino:
I really am sorry...
I hope I didn't scare you...

Shido:
Please, I'm fine, really.
...Hey, Reine, tell me, what am I doing in here?

Reine:
The thing is, you were knocked out in the battle with Kurumi.
So, we brought you here just to be on the safe side.

Shido:
Yeah...yeah, that's right!
But, I don't know what happened after that!
What about Tohka?! She's just sleeping, isn't she?!
Oh, hey! Where is Kotori?! What was that power?!

Reine:
You need to calm down, Shin.

Shido:
No! I'm not gonna calm down!
Wait! What about Kurumi?!
And, Mana! Is she alright?!
And everyone from school! ...Wup!

[Reine hugged Shido's head, sunk his face into her sizable chest]

Shido:
Mgg...!

Yoshino:
Oww...

Reine:
Everything will be just fine.
Do you feel better now?

[Reine released Shido's head. She patted Shido's head]

Shido:
Bwah!
...yeah.

Reine:
Everybody is doing okay, and no one was killed.
All thing's considered it could've been much worse.
...As far as Origami, and Mana, they were both taken by members of the AST.
We can't be certain yet, but our best guess is they were brought to Tengu hospital.
Kurumi ran off, while she had the chance.
And, as you can see, Tohka is sleeping.
Even though she's hurt, she wanna to be by your side.
Tohka cares more about you than she does her own recovery.
Not too worry, though, she's gonna be fine.

Shido:
...That's good.
And, this isn't the end, is it?

Reine:
Of course not.

Shido:
Kotori...Can I see her?

---

[Kotori was sat at the table, drinking her tea. She was surrounded by glass walls, or magic mirror. Bunch of devices were monitoring her conditions. Shido and Reine was right outside of the room, they can see through her]

Reine:
She can't hear, or see us through the protective wall.
You're going to be on your own in there.

[Shido stepped up the short stairs. An automatic door of the room opened. Kotori looked at Shido]

Kotori:
Hey, you.
I didn't expect to see you up and about.
How are you feeling?

Shido:
Better.
I guess.
...What about you?
Are you feeling okay?

[Shido sat at the table, opposite side of Kotori. Kotori smiled to Shido and spoke back to him]

Kotori:
I feel like my normal super cute self.

Shido:
Not sure it's normal to call yourself cute...

Kotori:
You don't think I'm cute?

Shido:
...No, you're right.
I guess you're kind of cute.
...But, Kotori, tell me the truth.
Are you really a Spirit?

---

[While the conversation between Shido and Kotori was getting up its tense, the scene changed to show Mana laying on the bed. Her dark sickroom was full of machines. The scene turned back to Kotori's room. Reine was monitoring them from outside of the room. She could hear their conversation through the speaker]

Shido:
Answer me, are you Spirit or not?

Kotori:
Well...if I told you that I wasn't the Spirit, would you believe me?

Shido:
Of course.
If you said so, then I would.

Kotori:
Is that right...
You believe what someone says even when you've seen the contrariety to be true?
If you want my true sense, that seems like a first way to make a fool of yourself...

[Kotori sipped her tea]

Shido:
If I can't even trust my little sis, what kind of brother will that make me?
Look, I said I believe you.
I always will, no matter what.

[Kotori put down her cup onto the table]

Kotori:
...I think I'm a human being.
I mean, I wouldn't call myself a Spirit.
Although...the observation equipment might beg to differ...
I have no doubt the machine hasn't lied to you.

Shido:
Wait, what do you mean?

Kotori:
I was born into the Itsuka family, and that much I know for sure.
But, five years ago...somehow, I became a flame Spirit.

Shido:
...

Kotori:
That might not be the way to put it...
I guess it's more accurate to say I became a person who possesses a Spirit powers.

Shido:
Seriously...?
...!

[Shido recalled that sobbing little girl, surrounded by flame]

Shido:
This might sound nuts...but I knew about this...

Kotori:
That's impossible!
I never said anything to you!

Shido:
No...! ...no, that's not what I'm saying.
I had this dream...

[Shido tried to remember his dream. In the dream, he was running to Kotori]

Shido:
Kotori! No!

Kotori:
Eh! Big brother...Big brother! No!

Shido:
Aaaah!

[Younger Shido was hit by the flaming lumber, got thrown himself away from Kotori. Crying Kotori tried to be close to Shido, crawling on her hands and knees]

Kotori:
Ah...Big brother...I'm sorry, brother...(Sob)

[Shido fainted out in his dream. The scene returned to the room Shido and Kotori sat at the table]

Kotori:
...I have to say, I'm not sure I agree with the part where I was screaming out for you, and crying like a big baby.
But, more or less, that's the way I remember it, too...
It's possible I've made flowed to you through the path, and the Spirit powers return to me...

Shido:
...I see.
But, I still don't get it.
What happened?
How did you become a Spirit?

Kotori:
Hmm...I wish I could tell you.
But, the truth is, I don't remember.

Shido:
Huh?

Kotori:
I mean, obviously I know something must've happened back then.
Before the life of me, I don't know what?
I remember becoming a Spirit, but I don't know how...or, even why for that matter...

Shido:
How can you forget something so important?

Kotori:
Look who's talking...
You're no position to pass judgement on the forgetful front, big bro?
But, then again, you're right.
It's kind of weird that neither of us has any memory of it at all...
You think we would remember everything...who knows?
Maybe, somebody erased our memories for some reason...?

Shido:
...

Kotori:
Well, it's a theory, anyway.
After that, I was discovered by Ratatoskr.
Then I found out the truth about what was going on behind the scenes.
And, I decided I wanted to save the Spirits.

Shido:
But, want you got passed that big fire, you lived a pretty typical life...?
How are you able to blend in with the regular kids?

Kotori:
What? You don't remember that part either?
I was able to be a normal girl because you sealed the way my Spirit powers.

Shido:
Really? ...Wait, are you serious?

Kotori:
Yeah, didn't I tell you yesterday?

[Shido recalled the scene when the Flame Spirit appeared on the battle field]

Kotori:
Don't let me forget to give this back to you, Shido.

[Kotori stood in front of present Shido]

Kotori:
I don't fully understand why, but for some inexplicable reason, you're able to seal the way of Spirit's power.
And, that's why you're chosen by Ratatoskr to talk to the Spirits.
You're special, Shido.

Shido:
So...my regeneration ability came from...

Kotori:
Ah! Yes, your ability came from mine!
...Now, listen up!
Come over here, and stand right in front of me.

[Kotori pointed down the floor next to her, invited Shido to stand there]

Shido:
Er...why should I do that...?

Kotori:
'Cause I said so.

Shido:
Fine...

[Just when Shido stood up, started to walk to the place Kotori indicated, Kotori gave her full swing punch to Shido's stomach. Watching it Reine from outside the room couldn't move, being dumbfounded. Shido knelt down on the floor]

Shido:
Gfwoh...!

Kotori:
I told you to be careful, didn't I?
But you didn't listen to me.
If I hadn't come to my senses, you'd be dead-meat!
You're very lucky.
What the heck are you thinking anyway, you idiot?
Running in front of my line of fire like that!

Shido:
...You scared me.
I thought you'd lost it.

Kotori:
Uh...

Shido:
And, I was right...You weren't yourself.

Kotori:
...Yeah, when the Spirit powers returned to me, I lost control.
All I want is to do break something.
I better yet killed someone if I got the chance...I was scared.
It was like I was different person.
Who knows what other awful things I've done that I have no memory of...?
There's no telling, because that's easy for me to loose control of my self...
I wouldn't be shocked if I already have killed someone...!

Shido:
Stop talking like that!

Kotori:
Just ignore me...
I don't even know what I'm talking about.
But I do think I know why I snapped out of it yesterday.
It's because you stepped in front of me.
Thanks for saving the day, big bro...

Shido:
About your Spirit power...will it come back to me?

Kotori:
I don't really know.
Unfortunately, Spirit stuff isn't always easy to understand.
All I know for sure is this.
You have to seal it, just like you did it before.

Shido:
But, the seal would the way I'd have to...

Kotori:
Yes, take me on a date, and make me fallen love.
The same way you did with Tohka, and Yoshino.
You have to...
...Unn...

[Then, Kotori dropped her mag, and she also sunk down to the floor]

Shido:
Hey, Kotori?! Are you alright?
Can you stand?

Kotori:
Yeah, I'm okay...
You don't need to worry about me.

Shido:
Please, talk to me...

[Reine barged into the room]

Reine:
Shin, that's enough for today, alright?
You go ahead, and I'll handle things from here.

Shido:
No, I can't.

Reine:
We'll have lot to discuss later.
But, for now, go on.

Shido:
...Okay.

[Shido walked out the room. While he prodded in the corridor, Tohka found him]

Tohka:
Shido!
't happen? Looking everywhere!
I was worried because when I woke up, you were gone.
But, you are awake. So, does this mean you're feeling better?

Shido:
I don't know.
...Do you mind if we talk later?

Tohka:
Um...yeah, okay.

[Shido was at Reine's lab]

Reine:
I give her two days.
I doubt she'll last much longer than that.
Eventually, her Spirit power will be too much for her to handle.

Shido:
What do you mean by that...?

Reine:
Once her power takes her completely, Kotori will no longer be anything like the little sister you once knew and loved.
In just under forty-eight hours, we'll have you go on a date with her.
That'll be your best chance to make sure she doesn't slip away forever.

---

[Shido was at the hospital's lobby]

Receptionist:
Sorry, sir. But, you are no allowed to see her.
Not even her family can do that yet.
I do apologize, but I'm afraid I don't know when she's going allowed to visitors.

Shido:
But, why?
Is she really that bad?

Receptionist:
I wish I could help, but, unfortunately, it is time I can't discuss her condition with you.

Shido:
Ma'am, please!

Origami:
...Shido.

Shido:
Origami!

[Origami happened to be walking around the hospital. She toddled with using her intravenous drip stand as a cane]

Origami:
I'm glad you're safe.
...Is Tohka okay?

[Shido got dumbfounded for a short while. Because, Her concern to Tohka was unexpectable to him]

Shido:
Er...yeah.
She's a...she's good.

Origami:
Ugh...

[Origami clenched her teeth in regret. Shido got dumbfounded again]

Shido:
Er...

Origami:
...Never mind.

[They moved to the bench where they can see outside the hospital from the window]

Origami:
So, you came here to see Mana, huh?

Shido:
Yeah, well...I tried to, but the nurse wouldn't allow it.

Origami:
I can't go into specifics, but...for Mana's recovery, they are using some highly classified equipment on her.
So, until she's moved to general ward, there's no way that anyone see her.
And, if you tried to force you way in, it won't end well.
...I know that's why you're here.

Shido:
Huh?

Origami:
...To see Mana, and nobody else.

Shido:
Oh...well, obviously, I came to visit you, too.

Origami:
Uh-huh...?

[Origami squinted her eyes with her doubt. Shido stood from the bench]

Shido:
Yeah, I'd better get move on! Ha ha...sure you're really busy.
I bet you have lots of doctor's appointments and stuff like that?
Later!

[Shido walked away from Origami, but when he left several steps from her, he heard "Thud" sound from the place where Origami was]

Shido:
Uh...?

[Shido found that Origami's body laid on the floor. He ran to her]

Shido:
Er...Origami?! Are you alright?

Origami:
...I can't make it back to my room on my own.
Will you please carry me?

Shido:
I-I should get have nurse...

Origami:
Carry me, right now.

Shido:
Come on, who needs a nurse?
Can you walk?

Origami:
No, I can't.

Shido:
What you need is a wheelchair...
Well, I'll get one.

[Shido began to left Origami to find an wheelchair, but Origami grabbed Shido's shirt, detained him]

Origami:
No, please stop. I can't handle that.
I'll vomit from motion sickness.

Shido:
What do you expect me to do about it?!

Origami:
Piggyback me.

Shido:
Huh?

Origami:
You heard me.

Shido:
...Right.

[Shido piggybacked Origami, walked to her sickroom. Origami dragged her intravenous stand]

Shido:
...Hey, Origami, don't you think you're holding a little tight there?

Origami:
Oh, no?

[Origami held Shido's back more tight, pushing her bosom against his back]

Shido:
Er...You're in room 305 on the way on west wing, aren't you?

[Origami tightened her hand that grabbing Shido's chest]

Shido:
Hyak!
O-okay, that tickles!
Please, don't...

Origami:
Man, up.

[They were in the elevator]

Shido:
Um...Origami, stop.

Origami:
Haa...haa...

Shido:
Hell, boy...Alright, that's enough.

Origami:
(lick)

Shido:
Hey! Looking at the crossing line! Okay?!

[The elevator arrived on the third floor. Now they were at the room 305]

Shido:
Well, then...I'm just gonna go ahead and...oh!

[Origami thrust the fruit knife before Shido's nose. And, she was holding an apple on her left hand]

Origami:
Peel it.

Shido:
Eh...well, I suppose I can make that happen...

[Shido peeled an apple, cut to pieces, and arranged them on a plate]

Origami:
...Now, feed it to me.

Shido:
Don't you think this is getting a little crazy...?

Origami:
You wanna see crazy? Try not feeding me.

Shido:
(Sigh)

[Shido picked a piece of the apple, moved it to Origami's mouth]

Origami:
Now, put it in my...

Shido:
Fine! Here!

[He suddenly raised his voice, pushed the apple into Origami's mouth hard]

Origami:
Mgg...!

Shido:
Fu fu...eh?!

[Origami took Shido's hand, started to run her tongue over his index finger, sucked it]

Origami:
Nn...Aah...Nn~

Shido:
Oh...please, stop...wait, don't stop...!
No, do! It's gross, and awesome too!
Oh, god...! Too much!

[Origami finally released Shido's finger from her mouth. Saliva made threads between her mouth and his finger]

Origami:
Nn...delicious.

Shido:
Great! I'm glad to hear you liked it.
So, anyway, I'm gonna take off now...

[Origami brought up a clinical thermometer]

Origami:
But, what about my temperature...?
I'm gonna need your help.

Shido:
Mm...

Origami:
Sticking it to my mouth.

Shido:
Al...right, fine.

[Then, Origami made Shido sat on her bed]

Shido:
Why am I sitting down to take your temperature?

[And, she opened her thighs, and mounted on Shido's lap. They were facing each other]

Shido:
...This isn't appropriate!
What the heck is going on?!

Origami:
Oh, you seem to get excited by Kurumi's behavior?
Since you like that sort of things, I thought I turned up the volume, get more aggressive.
Here the rules, big-boy...If you look, you have to touch.

[Origami opened the front of her garment, revealed her cleavage. Shido couldn't move his eyes from looking at Origami's face]

---

[The time passed enough to make yellow sunlight into red. Shido walked to the door of the sick room]

Shido:
Good-bye, Origami.
I'm really leaving this time...

Origami:
Can I ask you one more thing?

Shido:
Hm?

Origami:
It's important.
I want you to tell me what happened after the fight with Kurumi Tokisaki yesterday...
Because I...thought I saw another Spirit floating in the sky.
She was surrounded by flames. Flame she could control...
Then, I must've passed out. The next thing I knew, I woke up in here.
So, I want you to tell me what I've missed...
No matter how insignificant the details, I wanna know everything that happened and everything you know about this Flame Spirit.

Shido:
Oh...well, er...
I got knocked out too, so I don't know much...
Why do you ask?

Origami:
Just curious...

Shido:
Well, do you know her?
The Flame Spirit, I mean.

Origami:
...Yes, I do.
Five years ago, there was a massive fire in Tengu city, in manly broke out the small neighborhood called Nankoh.
And, that's when I first saw her.
The day she burned my parents alive.

Shido:
...

[Shido recalled the memory that young Kotori sat on the floor, sobbing in the flame, called him]

Kotori:
Big brother!

Origami:
Ever since she killed my family, I've spent every waking moment searching for her...
No one should ever have to feel the way I felt that day.
She's the reason I joined the AST, the reason I trained as hard as I could.
She's why I get out of bed in the morning...and she's what I think about when I go to sleep.
I promise myself back then, when I have the chance, I wouldn't hesitate.
I'd wrapped my hands around her throat, look her in the eyes, and crush...every last bit for meaning life.
And, now, my opportunity's right in front of me.
This is the moment I've been waiting for...
I swear to you, I will kill the Flame Spirit.
