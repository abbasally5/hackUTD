  [Chime rang, the school was over. Students were getting on their way home. Kurumi was wearing her outer shoes at shoe rockers. She was worrying how she should respond to Shido]

Kurumi:
Tomorrow, isn't...like, tomorrow?

Shido:
Tomorrow. If you have time, of course.
I thought I could show you around town.

Kurumi:
That sounds fun.
...Wait, are you asking me out on the date?

Shido:
Uh...I guess you could say that.
...What do you say?

Kurumi:
Alright. I'll go on a date with you.

Shido:
That's awesome.
Is ten thirty OK?
We can meet by the station gate.

Kurumi:
I'll see you there.
Looking forward to it.

[With short chuckle of joy, she ran off the entrance hall. Shido heaved a sigh while looking after Kurumi's back. He was recalling the talk he had in the physics preparation room during the lunch break]

Reine:
Mana Takamiya supposedly killed Kurumi Tokisaki.
We don't know why she's still alive.

Kotori:
Well, as long as she is still alive, we're sticking with our plan.
Tomorrow's a holiday, and there's no school.
...Shido, we need to ask Kurumi on a date.

Shido:
What?!
Even after what already happened?!

Kotori:
It's because what already happened.
There's no guarantee that she'd be revived, so she gets killed again.

Reine:
And let's not forget about Origami Tobiichi.
She will have told the AST.
So they'll know that Kurumi didn't die.
Which means, Mana knows as well.

Shido:
...Alright then.
I understand.

[While recollecting the conversation between them, Shido talked aloud the last few sentences he talked at the time]

Shido:
I'll give it all of me.
I swear it.

Origami:
You swear what exactly?

[Without noticing him, Origami stood just behind of Shido, hearing Shido's soliloquies]

Shido:
Whooa!

--- OP ---

Narration:
Dating everyone at the same time...
It should be paradise.
This girl, that girl, and the girl over there could be yours.
...Unfortunately, life doesn't always go the way we want.

---

Origami:
I'm going to ask you one more time.
You swearing what to Kurumi Tokisaki?!

[Origami pressed Shido to inquire him]

Shido:
Er...nothing! I don't know what you mean!

Origami:
Just answer!
Trust me, this is very important.

Shido:
Yeah...sorry, I gotta go. Tohka's waiting...
I'll see you later!

[Shido put aside Origami, and ran away from her. Remained Origami showed a concern on her face. She recalled the event with Kurumi during the lunch time]

Kurumi:
Oh, Origami...I must say you look delicious too...

[Kurumi slowly walked to approach Origami, licking her fingers. She began groping Origami's inner thigh]

Kurumi:
Yes...very delicious...

Origami:
Uh...Ugh...!

Kurumi:
But...I think I might save you for later...
Instead, I'll devour you once I'm finished with Shido...

[Then, she released Origami, disappeared from the hall front of the roof space. Origami coughed several times, sat on the floor, and rubbed her neck. Origami mumbled while she stood alone in the entrance hall]

Origami:
Oh, Shido...

---

[Shido and Tohka were walking along the way their home. Shido was holding a plastic bag from the super market, A daikon stuck out from the bag]

Shido:
I'm sorry about lunch, Tohka.
But, you gotta chance to eat, right?

Tohka:
Yeah, I got eat...

[This time, Tohka began recalling her lunch time. She sat on her seat in the class room alone. Her stomach was grumbling, but waiting Shido to eat lunch with him. Tohka welled tears on her eyes]

Tohka:
(Where is he...)

Ai:
Boo! We only want two of these ticket instead of three!
Or, we spread a cost of one more?
Oh! Hey, it's Tohka.

[Ai, Mai and Mei were entering into the class room. Ai was holding two tickets in her hand]

Mai:
Why haven't you eaten lunch yet?

Ai, Mai, Mei:
Ah...!

[They noticed that Tohka was about to cry on her seat]

Mai:
Oh, no! What's wrong?!

Ai:
Tell us everything! Who did what?!

[Tohka shook her head]

Tohka:
Shido isn't here. And, I started thinking about how...
Well, I started thinking about how we haven't really talk to much today.
Then I, er...
For some reason, I just got sad...

[Tohka finally began weeping]

Ai, Mai, Mei:
Oh~?!

Ai:
Girl! You do not have to say another word!

Mai:
Shido's a jerk! And he's taking you for granted!

Mei:
That is just so lame!

Tohka:
No. Really, he didn't do anything wrong...

Ai:
No, no. Of course not.
But still...

[Ai flipped the tickets she had been grumbling about]

Ai:
You don't have to be sad.
And, we can help!

[Tohka was walking along with Shido. It seemed she had determined something in her mind]

Tohka:
Mm...

---

[Shido and Tohka returned to their home. Shido walked into the room beforehand, next Tohka. Tohka locked the door backhand. When she entered the living room, she shut the curtain of the window]

Shido:
Huh...? We've got some time before dinner, don't you wanna go home first?
...Hey, Tohka?
Are you okay?

[Suddenly, Tohka untied her ribbon tie, began undoing her blouse buttons]

Shido:
Huh?!

[Tohka got down on the floor on her hands and knees, emphasizing her cleavage of her breast, holding the ticket on her mouth]

Shido:
Wha---?! Wait! Wait-wait-wait! Hold on a second!
I am very confused!

Tohka:
Fuuh...fuuh...

Shido:
Okay, what's going on?

Tohka:
Fuuh...um?
(Shoot! This isn't working...)
What's next?

[Tohka retreated to the back of the room, reading a piece of memo, nodded. Then she squeezed the ticket into her breast crevice, and pressed her hands on the back of the sofa where Shido sat, so the ticket was right in front of his face]

Shido:
Ah...?!

Tohka:
Shido...I...have a question for you...?

Shido:
Er...year?

Tohka:
Hah...tomorrow...will you go on...a date with me...?
Please...?

Shido:
Wha...A date, huh?

[Tohka nodded. Her cheek blushed in red]

Tohka:
Pretty please...?

Shido:
Y-yeah! Sure thing!

[Shido took the ticket off of Tohka's breast. Tohka raised her two arms to triumph of the success on her plot]

Tohka:
How wonderful!
Those girls are write about everything!
Now then, meet me by the statue in front of the station at ten a.m.!
And, don't forget!

[Tohka stormed out of the living room]

Shido:
Hah...

[Shido sighed for relief. He noticed Tohka had left the memo paper. He picked it up from the floor. It read "You definitely can kill that monkey with one shot. Tohka's seductive techniques list: (1) The pause of female cheetah (2) Ticket in boobs (3) If the above wouldn't work, then push him down"]

Shido:
What's this...?

[Then, Shido's cellphone began vibrating]

Shido:
...It's Origami.
Hey there, Origami. What's up?
Are you OK?

Origami:
I'm fine.
But, you shouldn't be left alone right now.
I will be waiting for you at the fountain in front of the station tomorrow at exactly eleven a.m.

Shido:
Wait! But I...

Origami:
Meet then.

[Beep---Origami hung up the phone. ? mark floated above Shido's head]

Shido:
...Crap.

---

Kotori:
Test, test. Can you hear me?
I can't believe your triple locked on such an unbelievably important day!
You dirty little dork!

[Shido stood at the front of Tengu station. The dog statue stood aside him]

Shido:
Hey, don't be mean.
Remember, you're the one who kept me from canceling.

Kotori:
If you can't keep promises you make to Tohka, her happiness meter will go down.
And, if you cancel on Origami, she'll be even more suspicious than she already is...
Stop worrying. You're not by yourself.
We'll be supporting you with everything we've got.
All you have to do is follow the schedule and go with the flow.

[In Fraxinus's bridge, Kotori, Kyouhei, Reine, and Yoshino and Yoshinon were on board with other Ratatoskr members. The time on clock appeared on the monitor]

Kawagoe:
Commander! The plan will commence shortly!

Shinzaki:
Countdown is beginning now.
Ten seconds to start from now.
Ten...

[Shido murmured while looking the ticket of the aquarium nearby the station]

Shido:
The first, I'm going to the aquarium with Tohka, right?

[Yoshino spoke with small voice, encouraging Shido]

Yoshino:
I know you can do it, Shido...

Yoshinon:
It's dangerous! And, don't get hurt!

Shido:
Right.

Shinzaki:
Three...Two...One...

Kotori:
Now, let's start a date, shall we?

Shinzaki:
...The date has begun.

[Soon after Shinzaki's quiet, yet solemn voice declared the event had begun, Tohka's voice came from the right side of Shido]

Tohka:
Shido!

[Tohka was running toward the place Shido waiting. She wore blue short jeans, two layered flare blouses. Shido opened his eyes wide, had been charmed by Tohka's outfit]

Shido:
Ahh...great. She's here...

Reine:
I chose her out fit.
Not too bad, huh?

[In Fraxinus, fascinated Yoshino nodded several times, and Kotori gave Reine thumb up]

Tohka:
Nn, fu...er? You're alright?

Shido:
Those cloth, they are...You look really cute.

[Tohka's face boiled into red]

Tohka:
Ah! Okay! That was about stupid cloths!
Can we just go now?!

Shido:
Sure, but, do you even know where you going?!

[Tohka hurried on the way to the aquarium, Shido followed her. Kotori was observing them through the monitor]

Kotori:
Not the best start.
But it couldn't be worth.

Minowa:
Commander, look!

Kotori:
It's Origami!
I got she wasn't supposed to get here until eleven!

Reine:
Apparently, she's impatient.

[In the monitor, Origami went up stairs lead to the station gate. She was wearing white blouse, blue short skirt. Tohka and Shido was arrived at the entrance gate of the aquarium]

Tohka:
So, I was wondering, what is this aquarium thing?

Shido:
Wait, you don't know?
Why did you want to come here if you didn't know it was?

Tohka:
Don't get the wrong idea!
I just wanted to go out on a date with you.
It didn't matter what it was!

[Shido slightly blushed his cheek]

Shido:
Eh...ahem!
An aquarium is the place that has a lot of fish and stuff they lives in water.

Tohka:
Really?!
Do you think there are hot fried fish?!

Shido:
No.

Tohka:
What about boiled fish?
Or, poached fish?
Or, steamed fish?!

Shido:
The only thing ever you think about is food?!
Ugh...you'll know when you see it...

[Now, they were already in aquarium facilities. In Fraxinus, Kawagoe reported another target approaching]

Nakatsugawa:
The main target has appeared!

Kotori:
Well, at least, this one's just ten minutes early...

[That was Kurumi. The time was 10:20, she was wearing black blouse, tying her hair on both sides with red ribbon. The other monitor showed Tohka shouted in the aquarium]

Tohka:
I can't believe this sight is real?!

Shido:
Try to use inside voice!

[Shido whispered, but said strong enough to restrain Tohka]

Tohka:
Right, sorry...
I can't help myself.
This is the neatest thing ever!
Ahh...those are really real fish out there...?!

Shido:
Yeah. More than just fish.

[They were in the transparent tube inside the huge pool. Turtles, ray fishes, and lot of other sea fish were swimming above Tohka]

Tohka:
Wow...it's also beautiful.
Come with me!
I wanna go see the rest!

[The time on the monitor in Fraxinus showed it's 10:28. Kotori noticed to Shido her next instruction]

Kotori:
Hey, Shido.
It's almost time for you to meet Kurumi.

Shido:
What? Already?

Kotori:
We'll pick you up using Fraxinus.
So, go outside, find somewhere with no one around.

Tohka:
Um...? Are you coming?
Because you haven't moved a bit.

[Suddenly, Shido began holding his stomach, writhing as if he was attacked by acute stomach-ache]

Shido:
Ah! Ugh! Ahghhh!

Tohka:
Oh no! What's wrong with you?!

Shido:
Arg...it's nothing! Only my stomach...!
I'm gonna head to the bathroom!
Keep looking at the fish for a while...!
Whoah...!

[Shido dashed away from the site]

Tohka:
Wha---?! But are you going to be okay?!

---

Shido:
I need to find a place for no one's around...

[Shido walked into the hidden space back at toilet hut. Immediately after that, Kotori transferred his body to Fraxinus]

Kotori:
Retrieval.

Shido:
Wah!

[Shido fall into Fraxinus' transfer room]

Kotori:
Open to the gate in front of the station now!

Shido:
Hold on! Already?!

[And he transferred to the station again. He ran to the station, Kurumi was already waiting for him]

Shido:
Sorry, I'm late!

Kurumi:
Don't worry.
I actually only got here around a minute ago myself.
So, where shall we go first?

Shido:
L-let me think...

[The three choices appeared on the monitor in Fraxinus. "(1) Shopping around in shopping mall. (2) Romance movie with us two alone. (3) Appreciate her trying on in the lingerie shop"]

Kotori:
This is where the real game begins!
Alright, everyone! Make your selections!

[50% of them chose option 1, and the other chose 2]

Kawagoe:
I think it should be no. 2!
And then, their hands, touch to romantic movie moment!
And, happen to so sweet[?]

[He was so exited, so the last sentence he said couldn't be perceived]

Shinzaki:
Option 1 is obvious choice.
All girls like shopping, so I really can't go wrong.

Kotori:
Neither one was a technically bad...

Kyouhei:
Except, they are both attached to the station, and equally in attached as well.
So, the risk of running into other girl is pretty low...
But I always say, there is no reason go looking for trouble.

Kotori:
Really? So, lingerie store's a best bet?

Reine:
Well, the other day, Shido asked her to show her panties, she didn't seem to have a problem with it.

Kotori:
Hmm...Heh heh.

[Kotori decided the action that Shido should follow]

Shido:
What?! Lingerie store?! For real?!

Kotori:
Don't make it so loud, pervert!

Shido:
Um...!

[Kurumi considered it for a second. Then she talked to Shido with smile]

Kurumi:
...If that what you want, I don't mind going to one of those stores...?

[In Fraxinus, Yoshinon exulted at her response]

Yoshinon:
She took that betting! Land with it! [?]

Yoshino:
She's so bold...

[At the station, Shido was completely infatuated]

Shido:
Heh...Then, let's go!

Kurumi:
It'll be your job to help me choose something cute!

[Kurumi linked her arms to Shido's left right arm, and they started to walk]

---

[Lingerie store. There are several mannequins displayed in the shop, wearing different design lingerie]

Kurumi:
Wow...they are so much here for try on...!
...Which one do you think the best on me?

[Kurumi picked up two pairs of bras and panties, let Shido choose the one for her. The three options appeared on the screen in Fraxinus]

Kotori:
Selections, everyone.

[The options were "1. Right hand, with pink based and black laced sexy one", "2. Left hand, cool blueish, fresh one", "3. I rather like more exposing one..." And, actually most of the Fraxinus clue choose option 3]

Nakatsugawa:
This is the time to attack!
Extreme strategy will short or reduce any resistance to the kiss!

Kotori:
Yeah, I mean she was okay going to the store, so it's probably a good pose. Go for it, okay, Shido?

[Shido gulped saliva]

Shido:
I, er, the both really pretty, but, eh...I like that style...over there.

[He pointed at the mannequin which wearing black, partially transparent set of lingerie with a pair of garters]

Kurumi:
You like the black one?
And, you think it's better than these two?

Shido:
Yeah! Just because, you know, I think you'll great in it!

Kurumi:
Well, that's very sweet of you to say...
I'll try it on, so will know for sure.

[She entered into a fitting room, and shut the curtain. Every female customers in the store cast dubious looks to Shido]

Shido:
Cool! Sounds great!
...Just make a quick, okay?

[The time was 10:54 a.m. Kurumi opened the curtain. Her white body under the black thin underwear were sparkling in the fitting room]

Kurumi:
So...how do I look?

Shido:
Ahh...

Ai:
What do you think you are doing, Mr?!

["Emergency" alarmed in Fraxinus bridge]

Mikimoto:
We have an emergency!

[In store, there were Ai, Mai and Mei stood behind Shido]

Shido:
Ugh...!

Ai:
Why is this looser with Kurumi?

Mai:
Good question.
And, what is that lingerie?

Mei:
That's so lame!

[And, Kotori solemnly proceeded the process]

Kotori:
Okay, Shido, it's time.
Get out of there now.
But make sure you don't leave Kurumi hanging!

Shido:
Aahhhgh! Ahg! Ow, ow!
My stomach!
Kurumi! I'm going to the rest, and I'll catch up with you up end, okay!?

[Shido began dashing to go out of the store. While running, Shido turned his face to Kurumi, shouted]

Shido:
Also, your look is freakin' incredible!

Kurumi:
Ah...well...

[Kurumi placed her hand on her heated cheek. Ai, Mai and Mei tried to chase him]

Ai:
Hey! Where are you going?!

Mai:
Get back here! Right now!

Mei:
You're so lame!

[In Fraxinus. The time was at 10:57]

Kotori:
Make her visions to the schedule.
...Oh, Shido. This is just the beginning.

---

[Ground force's lab. Mana laid on the chair, and she was connected several cables through the machine she wore. She opened her eyes]

---

Shido:
Hah...ah...Sorry, I'm late. Sorry...

[Panting Shido apologize to Origami. They were at the front of the fountain. Origami, probably had been unmoved to stand there for an hour, had peacocks on her two shoulders and her head]

Origami:
Don't worry about it.
I just got here myself.

[Peacocks flew away from Origami]

Origami:
You look kind of sleepy.

Shido:
Oh, no! I'm not tired at all!
So, where did er...where did you wanna go?

Origami:
To the movies.

Shido:
...But you don't wanna go to the one here, right?

Origami:
Of course, silly.
We have to go to this one.
I've already picked up tickets.

[Shido and Origami showed on the monitor. Clue members watched them with anxious]

Kyouhei:
This isn't good...

Yoshinon:
That one's not any better.

[Shido and Origami sat at the restaurant]

Origami:
Okay, I'll be back in just of it.

Shido:
...Lunch?

Origami:
We have just enough time to eat before the movie.
I figured now it would be as good time as any.

Shido:
Sure, let's eat then.

[Shido lifted up a glass of water, drank it at a single draft]

Shido:
Hey, Origami.
Why did you ask me out on a date today?

Origami:
I just no one to be by yourself.
Once the movie is over, come back to my place.

Shido:
Er, your place? What for?

Origami:
Look, you should stay with me for a while.

Shido:
...Eh...?

Origami:
I'm very serious.

[An waitress brought the dishes for their lunch. One was a dish of Spaghetti Neapolitan]

Waitress:
Here you go, guys.

Kotori:
There's something so weird about her...

[Kotori mumbled while she sat on the chair at Fraxinus]

Mikimoto:
Commander! It's Tohka!

Kotori:
Ah! Shoot...

[Tohka ran out of the aquarium to find Shido. In that time, Shido was eating spaghetti at the restaurant. When he noticed Tohka was running the restaurant, he spurted out pasta into the midair. Origami, sitting in front of Shido, stared at him]

Origami:
Want me to Heimlich you?

Shido:
No thanks...
I'll be right back.

[Shido stood from the seat. Origami left alone at the restaurant]

Shido:
Hey! Tohka!

Tohka:
There you are!
I was getting really worried!

Shido:
Yeah, me too...

[Tohka's stomach grumbled]

Tohka:
Ah...!

Shido:
Do you wanna get something to eat?

Tohka:
Yes, that sounds perfect, I'm so hungry!

[Kurumi stood in the front of the store alone. Every passing male pedestrian stared at Kurumi, being fascinated. Tohka gormandized over hundred plates of sushi at conveyor belt sushi bar. The time was around 11:35]

Shido:
Hey, that's sure there's a lot of sushi...especially you after the aquarium.

Tohka:
One more pickle mackerel!

[While Tohka biting big size taiyaki cake, Shido hid into the restroom and Fraxinus retrieved him, and immediately redeployed him to the street where Kurumi was waiting. Origami ate all spaghetti on Shido's plate. The time was at 11:41]

Shido:
You really bought it...that lacy underwear?!

Kurumi:
Oh, after you told me I let in freakin' incredible, is that king of had to?

Shido:
Yeah...

[At 12:14, Shido and Tohka was in front of the ramen shop]

Tohka:
Shido! It's ramen! Don't we have another ramen! [?]

Shido:
No! [???] on the way!

[At 13:04, Origami and Shido was walking in the back array. Shido upset when he noticed that Origami led him to the hotel where they could rest]

Shido:
Oooah?!

Origami:
Which room should we get?

[Shido pulled her out of the hotel. At 13:35, Kurumi smiled at puppies, she and Shido was at the display window of pet shop. And, Shido noticed the trio of Ai, Mai, Mei rushed out from the corner, and they are about locating him]

Kyouhei:
They'll be seen!

Kotori:
Ugh...!

[Fraxinus dispatched Yoshino to the location. She bumped to the trio]

Ai:
Ah...Now, hey, that hurt!

Yoshino:
I'm...so sorry...

[Yoshino apologized to them with her helpless but adorable looking up face. The trio somehow got trapped by her cuteness]

Ai, Mai and Mei:
Haaaahn?!

Ai:
No, it's fine!

Mai:
I'm worried about, answer you don't pain?!

Mei:
You're so cute, it's lame!

[While the trio were busy to take care about Yoshino, Shido quietly walked away from the site with Kurumi]

Yoshinon:
Yeah!

[Yoshinon secretly boasted their triumph to Fraxinus]

Kotori:
...Get them, Yoshino.

[14:45:07, Shido and Tohka were walking on land bridge. 14:46:23, Shido held Origami's hand and running through under the same bridge. 14:46:59, Shido led Kurumi, walking on the other side of the same bridge, and the trio was about to notice Shido again. Trying to distract them, Yoshino approached to the trio, but she stumbled and fell onto the ground. Fraxinus retrieved Yoshino]

Reine:
Looks like it's nap time.
...You worked pretty hard.

[At 15:25, Shido ran from Kurumi while they were walking in the park]

Shido:
Sorry Kurumi...Bathroom!

Kurumi:
Hah...What is wrong with that kid?
He's hardly making this is still a date.
I wonder where he keeps rushing off to, anyway...

[Kurumi sat on nearby bench]

Kurumi:
Oh well, it doesn't matter I suppose.
After all, I'm sure little Shido will be mine soon enough...
Aha! I get warm and tingly just thinking about it.
Not long...and then he will be mine...

[Kurumi bought a can milk tea from the vending machine. She pushed the can to her cheek, then she heard kitten voice from woods. She walked to the direction where cat crying]

Man A:
Oh, this guy's a feisty one!

[Four men wearing masks were bullying white kitten. They were in the middle of woods in the park. Men were armed by mock pistol using plastic BB pellets. Kurumi coldly looking at the scene for a short while, but she suddenly changed her face into a smile, and began taking to those men]

Kurumi:
Oh, look at you!
It seems like I found if you boys, or up to something interesting?

[Four men stopped shooting, turned to Kurumi warily]

Kurumi:
Calm down. Don't worry about me.
I'd like to get into on this sweet action if that's okay...
Believe or not, I've been known to be fairly decent with a gun myself.

Man B:
What should we do...?

Man A:
Hmm...
Hee hee! Well, that's it, sweetheart!

Kurumi:
Well...thanks so much for your permission.
I certainly didn't expect that eager welcome, so it is appreciate it.
But I have a small suggestion...
Why don't we change the rules? ...For fun.
It's not that complicated, we'll just switch targets for a little while...

[Then, the camera that used by Ratatoskr to monitor Kurumi was blacked out]

Kotori:
Er...?
Hey! What happened?!

Kyouhei:
This is broken? Get that thing fixed!

Kotori:
What are we missing?!

[Only the time was on the monitor. It was at 15:33]

---

Tohka, Origami:
Ow!

[They bumped to each other in the town]

Tohka:
Oh, I'm sorry!

Origami:
No, it was my fault.
I should've been paying attention...?

Tohka, Origami:
...Ah?

[They recognized a person they collided to]

Tohka:
...It's you! Stupid Origami!
What the heck are you doing here?!

Origami:
Well, stupid Tohka, what I do is nothing about your business.

Tohka:
Irk! That's fine!
I don't have time to waste for a loser like you anyway, so there!

Origami:
Good. 'course neither do I!

[They harmonize to say next sentence]

Tohka, Origami:
Because I'm actually on my way to find Shido!

Tohka:
Hah!
...er?
Whatever! I'm on the date with Shido right now!
So, you need to stop telling a lie!

Origami:
You are lying! Shido have instead on a date with me!

Tohka, Origami:
Ugg...!

[They glared each other for a while, but Origami noticed something important in her mind]

Origami:
(Oh no, this could be bad...Who is he with playing now?)

[She ran away from Tohka to find Shido]

Tohka:
Hey! Come back here!
I'm not done yelling at you yet!

---

[Shido was in the front of the bench where Kurumi's porch, paper bag from lingerie shop and can of milk tea sat. He was panting so he might run back to Kurumi, but she couldn't be found around the bench]

Kotori:
Shido, bad news.
We've lost Kurumi.

Shido:
How could you loose her!

[In Fraxinus, the sound of the alarm filled the room]

Mikimoto:
Alert! Spirit wave reaction nearby!

Kyouhei:
It's in the woods by the park's east exit.

[The time was at 15:38. Shido ran to the location. He searched for Kurumi in the woods, then he felt some strong stench so he pressed his right arm to his face. And, he found all over the woods and the ground was covered by dark blood. All Ratatoskr members lost words, stare still at the monitor. When Shido found a shoe down on the ground, he finally understood the situation that he is very now standing at the scene of massacre. He started to shout and caught in panic]

Shido:
AAAHHHHHH!

Kotori:
Shido! Calm down! Shido!

[When Shido knelt to the ground, about to vomit, Kurumi began speaking to him]

Kurumi:
Oh my...hello, Shido?
I'm so glad you finally decided to join us...

[Kurumi changed her outfit from completely black dress to her Spirit dress with orange and black frill, Elohim. Her left eye, now revealed its golden clock face, glanced at Shido. She was pointing the classic looking pistol to the man seemingly one of the four men who was bullying the cat. Now, he was undressed on his top, triple layered circles were painted on his bosom]

Man B:
Help...please! She's a monster!
Y-You have to help me!
Don't let her kill me...!

Kurumi:
You've tried to kill something without being ready to be killed yourself?
Doesn't that seem odd to you?
It was helpless...And now, you are helpless....
How do you like looking down on the barrel of a gun...?

[Kurumi shot her gun five times. Holes that the sizes were around clenched fist were made on the man's body. He collapsed to the ground]

Kurumi:
...Oh no, my finger messed to slipped.

[Kurumi slowly turned to Shido. He was unmoved by trapped in fear]

Kotori:
Shido, get out of there!

[He tried to stand, leave from the sight]

Kurumi:
Where do you think you are going, Shido?

[White arms, which once choked up Origami in the hall front of roof space, appeared, grabbed Shido's legs and fell him on the spot]

Shido:
Let go of me!

Kurumi:
How always me, I can't believe I completely messed things up!
I was having such a wonderful time on a date together, I wanted it to last little longer...
Oh, well...it cant be helped now.

[Kurumi grabbed Shido's face with her own two hands, peeked into his eyes which completely seized in fear. She licked her lips, her left golden colored glass eye captured Shido in its reflection. Then, it felt time was stopped. Suddenly, Kurumi's body flew into the midair, and slapped onto the tree trunk]

Shido:
Uh...?!

Mana:
Are you alright, big brother?

Shido:
M---Mana?

[Mana stood at between Shido and Kurumi. She was wearing the white-blue anti-spirit armor]
