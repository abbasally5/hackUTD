  [Shido plodded the road along side the train rail. The setting sun already hid more than half of its body. Wind from train passing by blew Shido's hair. He was reminiscing the conversation with Origami, and other things]

Origami:
Five years ago, there was a massive fire in Tengu city, in manly broke out in the small neighborhood called Nankoh.
And, that's when I first saw her.
The day she burned my parents alive.

Kotori:
If it's that easy for me to loose control over my self.
I wouldn't be shocked if I already have killed someone...!

Shido:
(We'll never know what happened unless Kotori and I both get our memories back. And, until then...)

Reine:
Eventually, her power will be too much.
I don't think she'll last longer than two days.
Only one person can save her.

Shido:
(I won't let her die...)

--- OP ---

Narration:
His younger sister is a Spirit.
He has a friend who is in the AST.
And somehow...Shido must save them all.

---

[The hospital where Origami and Mana staying. Captain Kusakabe visited to Origami's sickroom as an inquiry]

Kusakabe:
I heard they said you could be discharged tomorrow.
That's great.
...But, take another day off for safety.
You'd kill yourself for the busy it's been.
Looks like your school's out on break for a while, too.
That should give you plenty of time to recover.

[Kusakabe waved her left hand, start to leaving from the room]

Origami:
Rodger that...

Kusakabe:
Oh! Almost forgot, there's some interesting equipment being delivered to the base.
And, it's not what you might expect.
It should be there on the next couple of days...

---

[Shido was on the invisible airfleet Fraxinus]

Shido:
Ocean park, huh, interesting.
Isn't that the amusement park with the water park attached?

Reine:
It is.
We all agreed it would be the most suitable place for your date with Kotori.
You have two more days.

Kyouhei:
Lucky duck!
It's swimsuit season!
Which means, you'll get to see the Commander show off a charm --- like a charm as well as a dangerous current with nothing but two pieces of fabric!

Shido:
No, you don't have to say all those things out loud.

Reine:
(Harrumph) Well, those things...As well, we have arranged some training for you before the date.

Shido:
What? Training?
...
Bring it on.
Whatever it takes to save Kotori, I'm ready.

---

Shido:
...For real?

[Shido, Tohka and Yoshino were at the swimsuit corner in the department store]

Shido:
Is there some kind of hidden message here?
Or, how would shopping for swimsuit's training me?

Reine:
It will be sensitized you to other girls in every type of swim-ware.
We can't have you getting distracted when you're with Kotori.
That would be destructive.

Shido:
Look, Kotori's fate is on the line here, I'm not gonna get distra...

[Shido glanced at the mannequin wearing blue two-piece swimsuit, and couldn't get looking away from it]

Reine:
I hope you haven't forgot that your heart rate is being monitored.
You're gawking right now.

Shido:
Crap! Okay! Trained me!

Reine:
I'll do.

Tohka:
Can you believe how beautiful these are?!
Is everyone of them called Mizugi?

Shido:
Umm...yeah, in Japanese.

Tohka:
But, what is it?
I mean, what are you supposed to do with it?

Shido:
Eh, huh...you really don't know?
Okay, this is...

Origami:
MIlitary
Zapped
Ultimate
Grind Instrument
MI-ZU-GI, for short.
It's a new anti-Spirit annihilation suits.
When it's activated, the built-in realizer starts to critical driving force.
And, the war-head is broken into its molecular components and discharged.
It easily cuts through Spirit armor, and destroys the target's body.
So that, it can never be returned to its original state.

Tohka, Yoshino:
Uwah...

[Tohka dropped the top part of the yellow swimsuit she had been holding]

Shido:
What's wrong with you?!

Origami:
Oh, look, Hermit.

Tohka:
What are you doing here?!
What do you want from us?
Is it true? Did you bring us here to buy us annihilation suit?

Shido:
No, she's making that---

Origami:
No, I'm not.
He knows all about MI-ZU-GI and he's afraid.
He wants to destroy you.
That's why you're here.
He wants only trying to destruct you, so be easier to make his attack!

Tohka:
I don't believe you!
Shido will never do something like that to us!

Yoshino:
I don't think he would, either...

Tohka:
She's lying...right, Shido?

Shido:
Er---

Origami(Mimicking Shido):
No, Origami is telling the truth.
I've been tried to figure out easy way to kill you guys for weeks now.

Tohka:
But, why?!
I don't understand!

Shido:
I didn't say that. She did.

[Tohka finally grasped she was mocked by Origami. Her cheek turned into red]

Tohka:
Why, you, little coward!
Shido wasn't saying those things!
You were just playing a trick on me!

Origami:
I have no clue what are you talking about.

Shido:
(Sigh) ...Kind of a weird coincidence running into you here.
Oh, hey, how's your injury?

Origami:
Oh, I'm alright.
However...It's not a coincidence.

[The security camera set on the ceiling of the corner glittered wickedly]

Origami:
I'm glad I'd got to see you, Shido.
But, Tohka's actually the one I'm here to talk to today.

Tohka:
Talk about what?!

Origami:
Some stuff...Do you remember the Spirit wearing flames, that came down from the sky yesterday?
I know you saw her.
I would like you to tell me what you remember.

Tohka:
Humph!
Even if I did know something, you are the last person I would tell!

[Origami put her palm together, placed them next to her cheek, made her looking similar to a young girl begging something to her parents]

Origami:
Pretty please with cherries?

[Tohka and Shido got utter astonishment from her behavior]

Shido, Tohka:
Whoa?!

Tohka:
Stop that!
What do you think you are trying to do?!

Origami:
...I want you to tell me what you know about the Flame Spirit.

[She moved her hands from her right cheek to left. She also bowed to Tohka this time]

Origami:
Pretty please?

Tohka, Yoshino:
Eek...!

Tohka:
Alright! I'll tell you!
But, what to pick your head up? it's confusing!
...Yes, I did see the Flame Spirit.
She was...I don't know, hmm...very red.

Origami:
...Anything else?

Tohka:
...Let me think...she was also...very strong?

Origami:
And...is that it?

Tohka:
Um...I was like, "whooooaah" when I saw her.

Origami:
...That doesn't help me.

Tohka:
Oh, really?!
You bothered me for an explanation, and now is that good enough for you?!

Origami:
By the way, Shido, I just realized, the only swimsuit I have the one from the school swim team.
And, what that means is, it will quite problematic later if we decided to go to the beach or the pool.

Shido:
Oh, okay, well, why don't you just buy one while you're here?
Problem solved.

Origami:
I could, but it's very important to get second opinion when choosing such things.
Having a male opinion is especially helpful...

Shido:
Huh?

Origami:
I said, "Having a male opinion is helpful."

Shido:
Oh, well...

Origami:
very helpful.

Shido:
So...are you just trying to gain me to check you out?

[Anyhow, it made a competition among Origami, Tohka and Yoshino. They finished to pick up their own swimsuits. Tohka and Origami glared at each other in front of the changing booth]

Tohka:
Now, listen up, Origami!
If you want to play that way, fine. Then, whoever excited Shido the most will win a date with him!

Origami:
Do you really wanna waste your time?
I'll never let you go on a date with him, I will win.

[Shido grumbled to Reine through his transceiver]

Shido:
Umm...What's happening?
Why am I suddenly in the middle of the wet T-shirt contest?

Reine:
Just go with it.
This will be a good training exercise for you.

Ai:
Oh my gosh. Is that Shido?

Mai:
Er...why is he hanging out in the girls swimwear section?

Mei:
That is so lame...

Shido:
Ug...

[Ai wore black one-piece swimsuit. Its front side was opened wide and knitted by black strings, emphasizing her large breast. Mai was wearing red one, and Mei's was white, both of them were the two-piece. Shido felt uneasy himself stood at the spot. He averted from looking them]

Shido:
(I'm so at begins...)

Ai:
I hate it, let's get something else.

Mai:
We could try the school swimsuit.

Mei:
Haa, that's so lame.

[They disappeared from Shido. Monitoring him Reine commented to him]

Reine:
Wow, your heart-rate's through the roof, record breaking numbers.
Looks like those girls won a date---

Shido:
Hey, that is not funny!
I'm trying!

Tohka:
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

[Tohka opened her change booth's curtain. Her chosen swimsuit was white, plane type one piece]

Shido:
Oh...

[Shido let out a surprised sound. And, in Fraxinus, Kyouhei was enthusiastically giving his commentary]

Kyouhei:
Ohh~! Yes, wonderful choice!
The simple design, beautifully highlights Tohka's wholesome curves, making her unwittingly arousing...
Good girl!

Tohka:
So, what do you think? Tell me...!
Does it excite you at all?

[Tohka asked to Shido. Shido was completely mesmerized by Tohka's outfit, and stammeringly replied]

Shido:
Err...what?!...yeah...hee hee hee...

Tohka:
Yay! I'll try something else then. This will just a warm-up! I think it gets better!

[Then, Origami opened her booth curtain]

Origami:
How's this?

[Her swimsuit was a black two-piece. The fabric's size looking slight smaller than usual one, but difficult to say it's too small so it made herself obscene]

Shido:
Uh....

Tohka:
Ahh...

Kyouhei:
What destructive power she has!
Lovely contrast of dark fabric and pale skin!
And, up-do with a string holder is always a sassy choice!
This! Ha-haa!

Origami:
So, what do you think?

Shido:
Me? Right...er, I think...

[Origami made her waist grind. Shido started running down sweats on his face]

Shido:
I-it's...it looks nice on you...

[Origami made slight smile on her lips. Behind Shido, Tohka was getting in her temper]

Tohka:
Well, what's that?! It's gotta do with it! Argh!

[Tohka shut the curtain. Moment later, she opened the curtain again, and she was wearing another swimsuit]

Tohka:
What do you think about this one?
...Eww...

[Tohka's new suit was purple base colored two-piece. She must think it exposed her body-skin too much, she tended to push her arms to her body. The action made her body writhing]

Kyouhei:
Yeeeees!
That's what I'm screaming about!
A noting body combined with a face-full modesty! Irresistible!

[While Shido lost in admiration to Tohka's outfit, Origami changed her suit too]

Origami:
Over here.

[She was in ordinary cloths, with light yellow blouse and brown skirt]

Kyouhei:
Oh, no?! What is she thinking?!

Tohka:
Ha! Does this mean you're giving up? I don't blame you!

[Origami walk to the front of Shido. She placed her right hand on his chest. And, her left hand clutched his left hand, guiding it to her skirt]

Shido:
Eh...Huh?!

Origami:
Take it off.

Shido:
What?!

Tohka:
I'm pretty sure you're not playing by the rules!

[Now, Shido's hand was under Origami's skirt, tucking it up]

Shido:
Eh...Eh?! Er...
Ahh....! Aah!

[Then Origami opened her blouse's front, revealed her hidden swimsuit wearing under her cloths. That was white, light-green rimmed, plane one-piece]

Kyouhei:
And the game just took surprising turn!
Origami is stimulating what the art of teasing! Less Is More!
One glimpse, and his heart-rate's gone through the roof!
Imagination photo win!

Tohka:
Ugg...!
Don't wait! I'll soon onboarding me!
This isn't over yet!

Yoshino:
Um...Shido...?
Will you come here...?
I...um...I need your help...!

Shido:
I'm here.
I'm coming in. You're not hurt, are you?!

[Shido opened the booth curtain where Yoshino in. Yoshino was half naked, struggling to tie up her top part of the two-piece pink swimsuit. It was because she did not wore off Yoshinon from her left hand. Yoshino was looking up at Shido with her usual begging, half crying face. Shido must see her exposed left chest, of the girl who was just entered into puberty, small but surely recognizable bulge]

Yoshino:
I was trying to get it on by myself...
But it's hard to do with just one hand...

[Her innocent cry knocked out Shido. The sound of triumph echoed through Shido's earphone]

Reine:
Looks like we have a winner.
Game over.

Shido:
...Crap.

---

[Shido returned to Fraxinus. He and Kyouhei are speaking at a lounge, both of them were holding a cup of drinks]

Shido:
I don't ever wanna go through that again...

Kyouhei:
I can't say I understand.
But, at least, you had some entertaining commentary, right?
Did it help?
That's better to see those girls there than during a date.
So, do you feel you could handle it now?

Shido:
For sure...
I'm completely focused on saving Kotori...
Tomorrow, it's on.

[Shido crunched the paper cup]

Shido:
I won't let her down.
It's just that...I wish I could remember...you know, what happened five years ago...
How did I do it...? If I knew how I sealed her powers, maybe this'll be easier.

Kyouhei:
There is one thing we might do to talk your memory.
Would you like to look the footage of the fire, from five years ago?

Shido:
You have that?!

---

[They watched an TV report, taken five years ado. The screen showed a scene of large fire incident]

Reporter:
The flame is spreading quickly. Hot winds are blowing upward. Ah!

[A sudden explosion occurred at the site]

Kyouhei:
This is lost area footage from one of the networks.
It was never aired.
Ratatoskr recovered up pretty well...okay, yes, here it is.

[He paused the video. The monitor showed young Shido and Kotori. Kotori was dressed in Flame Spirit's]

Shido:
That's me and Kotori...wow.

Kyouhei:
Now, pay close attention.

[Kyouhei resumed the video in slow-motion. While young Shido lied on his stomach to the ground, young Kotori stood still, staring somewhere with no expression on her face. Some noise jammed the video a little]

Shido:
Pause it!

Kyouhei:
Wait, why? What would you see?
Is there something I missing? I don't see any movement...

Shido:
Over there!
...Who is that?
Or...what is that?

Kyouhei:
On screen...?
What are you talking about?

Shido:
Behind her!
(...It's so blurry...strange, but I can still see a person through all that...?)

[In Shido's mind, the same scene, Kotori stood at the street surrounded by the flame, A hand she reached to him, repeated again and again. Shido tried to extract some memory from it. But, instead, he lost hist consciousness on the spot, and fell down to the floor]

Kyouhei:
Hey! What's wrong?!
Are you okay?!

---

[Next morning. Shido was waiting for Kotori in front of the dog statue at the station]

Kyouhei:
Sorry about last night.
Clearly, I did more harm than good by showing you that footage.

Shido:
Oh, don't worry about it.
I wanna find out what that image was.
But another time, I gotta focus on this date.

Kyouhei:
Understood.
We're ready to help in anytime you needed.
So, have faith in yourself today.
I have to say, I have never seen the more talented playboy.
No Spirits stands a chance against your charm.

Shido:
Hee hee...thanks.

Reine:
Alright, Kotori has just been sent to the ground.
She should be arriving very soon.
You got this.

Shido:
Roger that.

[After the conversation, he heaved a short sigh to keep himself calm. Kotori was walking to Shido]

Shido:
Hey, there you are!

Kotori:
Yup, sorry for the late.

[Kotori was wearing brown overall short pants, white blouse. Red-rimmed black ribbons were arranged on her twin-tails]

Kotori:
...(Sigh) Isn't there something else you'd like to say to me? Like, about the outfit?
I'm pretty sure that's the first thing we taught you.

Shido:
Yes, you did.
You're great. Is that for me?

Kotori:
Oh, well, not completely. I mean, it's not unusual for me to dress up to go out.
But, also I had to do something that would you feel like it's an actual date.
And, compliments are nice for everyone once in a while...
Alright, come on.
Let's get this date thing started.

Shido:
Ha ha...'kay.

Tohka:
Yeah, let's!

Shido:
Um?

[With "Ta-da" sound, Tohka and Yoshino barged into the screen]

Yoshino:
Oh...boy...

Yoshinon:
We're gonna have so much fun!

Shido:
What's going on?! What're you guys doing here?!

Reine:
Oh, guess, I forgot to tell you.
The girls will be accompanying you two on a date.
We decided that'll be a better plan in a long run.

Kotori:
So, group date, huh?
I love surprises. How very brave?
I can't wait to see this turns out.

Tohka:
Shido, look!
I brought the swimsuit you bought yesterday, the one you loved so much!

Yoshino:
Yeah, I brought mine, too!

[Kotori cast a defiant look to Shido]

Kotori:
Hmm...You all went swimsuit shopping. How sweet.

---

[Ocean Park, many young men and women were playing in pools, water sliders]

Tohka:
Whoooa!
This is so amazing!
I can't believe they actually have a mountain and a lake inside the building!

Yoshino:
There's a lot of water here.

Yoshinon:
I do excite I can't just swim!

Tohka:
Look! Another wave!
Can we go swimming that one, please?!

Shido:
Sure. But, stay close.

Tohka:
Thank you and wait!
Let's go, Yoshino!

Yoshino:
Okay!

Tohka:
Yiiie!

Kotori:
...They sure have a lot of energy.

[Kotori appeared, wearing white two-piece swimsuit. Shido looked at her, slightly reddened his cheeks]

Kotori:
So, what's the deal here?
You're taken up your sister now?

Shido:
Of course not!
Don't be gross!

[Reine gave her advice on Shido from Fraxinus' bridge]

Reine:
You're about to compliment her, right?
She dressed up for you today.

Shido:
...Ahem.
Kotori.

Kotori:
That's my name.

Shido:
So, yeah...that swimsuit, it, er...looks very nice, of your way.
I mean, you...look, cute.

Kotori:
Hmm...Right on schedule.
Thank you Shido, was it Reine or Kannaduki who told you to say that?

Shido:
Eh?! Neither! I mean it!

Kotori:
Yeah? Well then, I'm flattered.
And, I'd love to know what you like the most about my look?

[Then, the three choices appeared. "1. All of it! You look great whatever you wear, Kotori", "2. It looks simple, but anyhow it also has a sophisticated design. You have a good taste on that swimsuit!", "3. Well, I especially excited by your growing chest"]

Kyouhei:
Everyone! Your options are there in front of you!
So, make your hits!

[All Fraxinus board members, and the players of "My little Seed" all over the world answered their options. The result was: 58% of them choose option 1, 42% for 2, 0% for 3]

Kyouhei:
Hmm...they all very reasonable.

Minowa:
Option 1 is a given.
It can't go wrong, man.

Nakatsugawa:
Not No.2, because it sounds like it's all about the suit, and not her.
And, 3 is just asking for it.

Kyouhei:
You're right about that...good point.
Hmm...
Option 3! Quick!

[Then, an electric current ran through Fraxinus. All clue members were looking at Kyouhei]

Fraxinus clues:
Huh?!

Shido:
...I really loves the way your boobs fill out the top.

Kotori:
Ugh...
What did you just say to me?!

Shido:
Nothing! I said your build like a mom!

[Shinzaki's straw doll threw to Kyouhei's face. He knocked back, but did not fell]

Kyouhei:
What the hell?!
Why is everyone freaked out?!
Oh, so suddenly, it's wrong to have a great luck?

Nakatsugawa:
Can you hear yourself?!

Shinzaki:
It's like you wanted to pull hot springs again?

[Tohka indexed water sliders. She's wearing inner tube]

Tohka:
Hey, Shido!
Let's go on that!

Shido:
You wanna try the water slide?

Tohka:
Yeah! Ain't they all four? but, could ride together!

Yoshino:
Eww...it's okay...
I don't want Yoshinon to get wet again...

Kotori:
And, I'm way too busy being not five, so I'm out.

Tohka:
Oh, darling.
Because it's just you and me then, this'll be so fun!

[Tohka linked her arm to Shido's. Shido was peeking at Kotori awkwardly]

Shido:
Er...ha ha...

Kotori:
You're right.
I change my mind, and I want to go.

[Reine nodded on Fraxinus bridge, murmured]

Reine:
Nn, that's much better.
Thank you, Tohka.
I wish Kotori will relax and have fun on a date.
This doesn't surprise me.

[Kotori, Shido and Tohka were on top of the water slider]

Shido:
...Is there another way to ride?
I mean, are we sure we're...you know, say...?

[Shido was sandwiched by Kotori and Tohka. Both of them held on Shido, and pushed their breast to Shido]

Tohka:
Not really!
So, hold on tight!

[Tohka pushed themselves to the slope. They began sliding down]

Shido, Kotori and Tohka:
Whoooah!
Eeeeek!
Ahhhhh!

[They were off-lane at the middle of the slide, being thrown out, and fell to the pool. Looking it Yoshino was shuddering with horror. Only Tohka looked having fun. And, Kotori began crying]

Tohka:
Ha ha ha!
That was the best ride ever!

Kotori:
Hic...oh, big bro...!

Shido:
You okay?
What's wrong?

Kotori:
Uh...!
Look, over there...
Can you get my ribbons...?

[Red-rimmed ribbons Kotori had been wearing were floated on the pool]

Tohka:
It was like "Wooooh" and "Whaaaah!"
Then, "Shooooo!"
A ha ha ha!

[While Tohka tried to explain what was the water slider like to Yoshino, Kotori tied her ribbons up on her twin-tail]

Kotori:
Ah, you're way too wild for me.

Shido:
Your ribbons are black, I just noticed that.
There any special reason?

Kotori:
Why, did they look bad?

Shido:
Of course not.
I was just curious.

Kotori:
Fine, I'll tell you, nosy.
White is a vulnerable color.
And, today, I need to be strong...Black is strong.

---

[They all were at the eating place. Lots of pilaf, spaghetti, sandwiches, burger plates on the table]

Tohka:
Yum! This is so good!

Yoshino:
Yes it is. Thank you.

Shido:
You're welcome. Glad you like it.

[Shido glanced at Kotori. She looked very unsatisfied, sullen face on her. Shido whispered to the transceiver to communicate with Fraxinus]

Shido:
Hey, Reine, what's the reading Kotori's happiness meter?
She looks pissed...

Reine:
It's not going down.
But, it's not going up, either.
There's been no change.

Shido:
(So, that means she hasn't had any fun at all...No way I can seal her powers like this...)

[Kotori slurped orange juice through an straw, and suddenly coughed several times]

Kotori:
(Cough)

Shido:
Are you okay?

Kotori:
...Yeah, just went down on pipe, I guess.

[Kotori stood from the table, start leaving to somewhere]

Shido:
Hold on a sec, where're you going?

Kotori:
I'm going to use that rest room, mother.
Not it's any of your business.
And, any other girl would kill you for asking...!

[Kotori didn't hide her irritation, left from the eating place. Shido heaved a long sigh]

Shido:
Haa...hm? What I do?

[Yoshino and Tohka looking at Shido with anxious face]

Tohka:
I just...I thought you and Kotori weren't getting along again.

Yoshino:
Are you guys in a fight?
It seems like she was mad at you...

Yoshinon:
You look so relieved when she stood up from here.
It's funny how easy to read you are.

Shido:
Huh? I'm that obvious?

Tohka, Yoshinon:
Nn-huh.

Shido:
Hmm...
I need a rest room, too.

[Shido stood from the table, walking to the restroom. He spoke to Fraxinus]

Shido:
Reine, can you tell how freaked out I am?
What are my mental readings right now?
Am I bad easy to read?

Kyouhei:
Hey, Shido. It's me.
I'm sorry, but Reine isn't here to do the analysis.

Shido:
That's weird. Where did she go?
Um?

[Shido found Reine sat behind vending machines nearby the restroom. He walked to approach her]

Kyouhei:
No, don't go over there.

[Behind vending machines, Reine treated to cure Kotori]

Reine:
Does that feel any better?

Kotori:
Yes...much better. Thank you.
That was a close one, wasn't it?
...One more, please?

[Kotori stuck her right arm out to Reine]

Reine:
I don't want to risk injecting more.
They already gave you fifty times than normal dosage.
I don't want to kill you.

Kotori:
Hee hee...
You really think something like that could kill me?
Drugs don't have a very strong effect in Spirit mode.
But, you would help the date with Shido...I mean, with big bro.

[Shido was hearing the conversation, while hiding himself using vending machine]

Shido:
...

Kotori:
Please, Reine...I know it's risky.
But, this might be last chance to see him.
If it fails, I won't be myself anymore after today...
But, no matter how it turns out, I want to be able to finish my date with him.

[Reine nodded silently, and pulled out an injector. When Reine finished her treatment and go out to return Fraxinus, she noticed Shido stood in front of the vending machines]

Reine:
Eh.

[Shido quietly walked out the corridor of the restroom, and Reine followed him]

Shido:
Be honest with me, how long has Kotori been in that state?

Reine:
Since the moment she's got her Spirit power's back.

Shido:
Why don't you tell me?!

Reine:
Kotori wanted that way.
She asked me not to say anything to you about it.
She didn't want you to spend your date feeling sorry for her.

[Shido clenched his teeth]

Reine:
If you want to help, pretend that you didn't see any of this.
Kotori will appreciate it.

Shido:
Yeah, I will. Thank you.

[Reine left from the site. When Kotori returned to the eating place, Shido sat alone at the table]

Kotori:
Mm...Hey.
Where the girls go?

Shido:
I don't know.
But, I think you and I should get dressed, and go to the amusement park.

Kotori:
Huh?
...You got all those Fraxinus, didn't you?
It's not going well out there, so you might wanna take to ride some rides indoors.
Whatever, not like it'll make any difference.

[Shido pulled out his infixed transceiver from his right ear, and threw it away]

Shido:
You're wrong.

Kotori:
Eh...?! Why did you do that?!

Shido:
I just like to amusement park better than the pool, and I'm ready to leave.

Kotori:
Really?

Shido:
We don't have to take Tohka and Yoshino.
They're having a blast on the jungle cruise.

[Shido took Kotori's hand]

Kotori:
Er...

Shido:
Are you ready? You haven't been here in a while, so prepare to have your mind blown.

Kotori:
...

[Kotori curiously looked up Shido]

[Kusakabe and Origami were at an equipment depot of the ground force's]

Origami:
This is the equipment?

Kusakabe:
That's right.
It's an experimental annihilation suit, DW029, or White Licorice.
It has the firepower of entire AST troop of one monstrous unit.
All it would take is one shot,

Origami:
Do you think it would be possible to even defeat Ifrit using this?

Kusakabe:
Well, if our simulations are accurate, this baby holds enough power to take down the Spirit.
But, it doesn't mean you allowed to use it.
You don't have the ability using it, or the authorization.
A specialist wizard from DEM was crippled after using it on full-power for only thirty minutes for the fist time.
...Wait, why are you talking about Ifrit?
Oh, I get it. The Spirit in the footage with her, right?
It's true they were the flames.

Origami:
...What footage?

[In monitor room, Origami watching the video taken when the Flame Spirit appeared at the roof space of the school]

Origami:
Kotori...I knew it was you...

[Origami glared her eyes in dark monitor room]
