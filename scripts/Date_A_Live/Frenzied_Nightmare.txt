  Mana:
That was pretty close, Shido.
Are you okay?

[Mana in the white-blue combat armor stood in front of Shido]

Shido:
Mana...?
I...

Mana:
Right.
This is probably little shocking, huh?

Kurumi:
Excuse me...but we were in the middle of lovely date, do I find a terribly rude of you interrupt us like this?

Mana:
Give me just a minute, big brother?
This won't take very long.

[Mana made the weapon wearing on her shoulders active, snapped her finger and the weapon blasted out two arrays of laser beams. Kurumi jumped to the air to dodge the attack, but the beams were controllable by Mana's finger, they changed their direction in midair, eventually the beams all gathered at the point on Kurumi's body. They burned Kurumi and dropped her to the ground]

Shido:
Kurumi!

[Kurumi was writhing in pain, and Mana stood next to her]

Shido:
Stop it! Don't kill her!

[Kurumi opened her eyes. She had a slight smile on her face, mumbled while she was waiting for Mana stubbed her light saber on her neck]

Kurumi:
Aha...I knew it...you really are a good stuff[?]...

[Mana killed Kurumi]

Shido:
Mana...why?

[Mana stood till, staring Kurumi's body to ensure her death]

Shido:
How can you stand there like nothing happened!
You just killed a person!

Mana:
I just killed a Spirit.

[She changed her outfit to normal cloth]

Mana:
Besides, I do this all the time.

--- OP ---

Narration:
"It" is something all things are given.
It cannot be bought, and it cannot be sold.
People often waste it, hold it dear, and chase after it.
If only we knew...what "It" was.

---

Mana:
It seems you've already heard a few things from Master Sergeant Tobiichi.
Well, you should probably pretend this is all a bad dream.
Just forget it ever happened.

Shido:
How could I forget it?!

Mana:
She won't stay dead.

Shido:
...

Mana:
Kurumi Tokisaki, or Nightmare, is a special Spirit.
No matter how many times she's killed, or, how she's killed, this Spirit appears again and kills more people, as if she's on a mission for murder.
So, I killed her over an over again.
And, I will continue to kill her, over and over and over...

Shido:
Will you shut up?!
Please don't tell me you're used to killing!
I don't wanna hear you talk like that.

Mana:
This job is one that can only be done by me.

[She began expanding her barrier field, that flew Shido away]

Shido:
Mana, wait!
...Damn it!

[Shido tried to enter inside the field, but he couldn't. In the field, Mana stood nearby Kurumi's body. And, the kitten saved by Kurumi cried to her corpse]

Shido:
Mana...why?

Mana:
I don't know...why.

[Mana suddenly felt stinging pain on her rear side head. She grimaces and put her hand on the head. Then, she heard somebody's voice, the sound arose in somewhere close around her. She found an earphone dropped at right back on her]

Kotori:
The plan's been aborted! We'll pick you up to Fraxinus!
Shido, can you hear me?!

---

[Tohka and Origami were running the street, found Shido trudging alongside the street]

Tohka:
Shido!
What happened?!
We've been looking for you!

Origami:
Spill it. What's going on?

[Tohka noticed that backside of Shido's right hand was swelled into red]

Tohka:
Oh, no...You've been hurt.

Shido:
Er...?

[When he looked at his swelled hand, he flushed back the scene that only a shoe remained in the bloodbath. He snapped Tohka]

Tohka:
I'm so sorry!
Did I make it worse?

Shido:
No.
...uh.
Sorry!

[Shido ran away from Tohka and Origami]

Tohka, Origami:
Shido?!

---

[Shido trudged, went up to reach his home. When he was almost at his home, he noticed Tohka was waiting at the gate of his home]

Shido:
Hey.

Tohka:
Hey!
Is your arm feeling any better?

Shido:
...Yeah.

Tohka:
Good! ...We can go, then.

[Tohka grabbed Shido's hand, and started to dash downward the slope]

Shido:
Wait! Go where exactly?!

Tohka:
We're continuing our date, silly!

---

Tohka:
Could I have some bread please?!

[Tohka ordered deep-fried breads at the bakery]

Tohka:
Corn dogs!

[She ordered Frankfurt sausage at the other shop]

Tohka:
Steamed pork bun!

[Shouted at Chinese restaurant]

Tohka:
Here!

[Tohka offered the foods to Shido to cheer him up]

Shido:
...Thanks. That was sweet.

Tohka:
Come on! Let's go!

Shido:
Hold on!

[Next, they were at that expensive-look Italian restaurant. That super-deluxe plate sat on the table]

Shido:
Tohka...I don't have much money on me.

Tohka:
Don't worry about money!
Reine let me borrow her magic viking's card!

Shido:
You mean, credit card...?

[After the restaurant, Tohka brought Shido to coin arcade]

Tohka:
She also told me about you, and Kurumi and Mana...

[Then, they were at an amusement arcade. Tohka won the deep-fried bun cushion from the crane game. Tohka was tracing places where they spent in their first date]

Shido:
I see...Then, you know I have to stop Kurumi from killing more people.

Tohka:
...Yeah.

[They went up the slope, led to the park on hill's top. This time, they can look all over the night illumination of Tengu city]

Shido:
I'm just...I'm not sure how I should go about with her.
I mean, Kurumi is a Spirit, but...she's different from you, or Yoshino.

Tohka:
No, that isn't true at all.
And, you know it.

Shido:
...?

[Tohka held Shido's hand]

Tohka:
Kurumi and I are the same.
...We are.
Remember that I had you here for me?
You saved me. And, didn't even know I needed you, but I did.
Then you asked me out on a date...like today.
And, showed me how amazing and beautiful this world really is...
If it weren't for you, Shido, I most likely would've ended up just like Kurumi.
There's only one difference between the two of us...
And that...is having someone close who's reaching out his hand...

Shido:
...Tohka, thank you.
You helped me realize what's important.

Tohka:
Yeah? Does that mean you aren't scared?

Shido:
No...not quite.

Tohka:
Don't worry!
I'll be here to protect you!

Shido:
Oh, thanks. It makes me feel better...

Tohka:
I know! Right?
...Shido, can we stay like this for a while longer?

Shido:
...Sure.

[They stood alone at the night park, holding their hands. The yellow and blue city lights far below them lit them feebly]

---

[The next morning, Shido and Kurumi were at the shoe rockers]

Kurumi:
Well, good morning, Shido.
How are you today?

[Shido closed his shoe rocker with slight strong motion]

Shido:
I'm fine.

[Then the trio spotted Shido and began to blame him]

Ai:
You are so dirt, dude!

Mai:
How dare you show your face around here?!

Mei:
That is I don't know lame!

[And Tohka appeared]

Tohka:
Hold it!
Please, let Shido alone!
Just go this way...!

[Tohka pushed the trio away from Shido. Both Tohka and the trio faded-out from the screen]

Kurumi:
...I have to admit I'm a little surprised.
I thought for sure you wouldn't wanna come to school today.
You know, after all that crazy drama.

Shido:
Kurumi.

Kurumi:
That's me.

Shido:
So, you know...I've made the decision that I need to save you.

[At first, Kurumi had had a burlesque face as if she mocked Shido, but she changed the mood. Now she wore an challenging atmosphere, like she was measuring his real intention]

Kurumi:
...Oh, that's kind of a strange thing to say?

Shido:
I will not let you kill anyone else.
I'll also not let Mana kill you.

[After a short while she glared Shido, gave him a "What do you know about me?" look. But soon, she recovered her usual burlesque attitude and spat out the comment before she leave from him]

Kurumi:
How very big of you.

[School's ordinary day began. Cicadas were buzzing outside the school, students practicing choir in the music class. Kurumi stood alone on the roof space. She turned around on her right leg. Then, red and black aura enveloped Kurumi. She transformed her cloths to the Spiritual dress. When she downed her left foot on the roof, spherical shaped dark-red field was born under her left foot. It spread, devoured the entire school]

Kurumi:
Little Shido...I've made the decision I need to test you.
And, see if you are really telling me the truth.

---

Mana:
Ratatoskr, huh?
I can't believe you and my big brother are part of that twisted organization.

[It seemed Mana summoned Kotori. They were in an abandoned building, the signboard hung in front building told "Do not enter." Contrasting to the bright, blue sky outside, inner building was dark, they were hardly visible. Mana threw the earphone-type transceiver toward Kotori]

Kotori:
I'm surprised you found that out.
Now, what do you want?

Mana:
It's about Shido.
You are negligent at best...how could you send him unarmed to go meet with dangerous Spirits?
You're failure as a little sister.
So, I'm going to take over that role from now on.

Kotori:
Oh, you've got be kidding me?
And, that corrupt company like Deus Ex Machina could their hands on him?
I don't think so, Mana?

Mana:
...How did you know?

Kotori:
You should stop underestimating me.
I know that except Ratatoskr, your little group supplies all the military forces around the world those realizers...
And you...you are one of their employees who was sent to the AST.

[Mana opened her eyes wide]

---

[School. Chime rang. According to the clock fixed at the top of the school building, the time was 3:40 p.m. Students started to go on their home. Shido, stood at the hall way, staring the outside through window, took deep breath]

Shido:
...Here goes.

[In Fraxinus, Reine spoke to Shido through the transceiver]

Reine:
Kurumi has not been seen leaving school as of yet.
Still though, our real problem is whether or not she'll listen what we have to say.

Shido:
Hey, where's Kotori?

Reine:
Something just came up.
She'll be back soon, but this time, I'll have to be your navigator.

Shido:
Okay, got it.
Let's do this.

[Then suddenly, the space Shido stood at wavered. Dark-purple air filled the entire building. Every students at the hallway went sick, and sank down to the floor]

Shido:
What...happened?
...Reine!

Reine:
We're analyzing right now.

---

[Inner the ruined building]

Mana:
I'm not going to stand here, and listen to call us corrupt.
You know nothing about DEM.
That place gave me a reason to live after I lost my memory.
I can't thank them enough for their help.

Kotori:
Really? Even after what they did to you?

Mana:
What are you talking about?

Kotori:
Eh,

[Kotori recalled the recent conversation between she and Reine]

Reine:
I discovered something terrible for Mana Takamiya's cup.
What they've done is wrong.
Her body has been implanted with far too much magical power.
...Sadly, she's not likely to live more than ten years.

[Kotori asked to Mana]

Kotori:
...You don't know?
They haven't told you?

[Then Kotori and Mana's each cellphone rang at the same time]

Kotori:
It's Kotori. What's up?

Kyouhei:
Commander, there's an intense Spirit wave reaction in Shido's high school.
It's coming from Kurumi Tokisaki.

[Kurumi squinted her eyes]

Kotori:
Understood.

[Mana must have also been received the same kind of information from her organization, she and Kotori simultaneously began running]

---

[School. Many students lied down on the floor. But, somehow Shido still could stand in the purple air]

Reine:
It's a wide area barrier. The kind of barrier meant to debilitate everyone within its range.

Shido:
She did this...but why?

Tohka:
Hey, Shido...

[Tohka approached to Shido. She also barely could stand, had walked to Shido's place]

Shido:
Tohka! Are you alright?!

Tohka:
Well...my body feels heavy for some reason.

[Shido talked to Fraxinus]

Shido:
Why am I the only one who's not affected?

Reine:
Since you've sealed the powers of both Tohka and Yoshino, it's like you've received their divine protection.
Given these conditions, you're the only one who can move normally.

[A school broadcast system suddenly began talking with Kurumi's voice]

Kurumi:
Shido, darling? Can you hear me?
If you need anything at all, feel free to join me on the roof.
Something tells me you might wanna get as soon as possible, though...
Eh heh heh heh...

[Shido talked to Tohka]

Shido:
Listen to me, stay right here, okay?

Tohka:
eh...

Shido:
And, don't worry. I'm going to save her!

[Shido left, run from Tokha]

Tohka:
Be careful! Shido!

[In the other class room, Origami sat down at the rear of the room, calmly observing the situation. She pulled out some device, looked like black IC chip. And, placed her left index finger on the chip]

Origami:
Identifying AST, Origami Tobiichi.

[The chip separated into four pieces, widened its size. It exposed some kind of display device. On it, the message "Identification completed. Basic realizer device ready to boot" displayed]

Origami:
One basic realizer, activated at once.

[Origami placed the device on her left forehead, where button like tiny device implanted into her. Once the device touched to her, her whole body began emitting green light. Her outfit transformed into AST combat suit]

Origami:
Ahh! ...Nn!

---

[Shido was standing at front of the door that led to roof space. The door's lock was destroyed, a clenched fist sized hole was made on the door. Shido opened the door, entered to the roof space. The entire floor of the roof space was covered red-blue pattern, the shadow of the shell of the barrier field might made this eerie sight]

Shido:
Ugh...eh?

Kurumi:
Welcome, Shido.
I'm glad you have some eager to come see me...

[Origami ran through the hall way, to get to the roof space where Kurumi, and probably Shido waiting]

Kusakabe:
I'm showing you using the emergency uniform.
What's going on?!

Origami:
Dangerous situation. I need support!
Eh...?

Kurumi:
Fu fu fu...Hello, Origami.
You seem like you're in a rush where I to be off to?

Origami:
I'm here to protect Shido from you...

Kurumi:
Now, that doesn't work for me...
Terribly sorry, but you'll have to stay right here.

[Origami activated her light saber, readied to fight to Kurumi]

---

[Tohka sank down to the floor, she seemed like her energy were absorbed to the purple air]

Tohka:
Oh, Shido...don't go...ugh...!

[She tried to stand up, however, she instead fell down onto the floor]

Tohka:
It's not safe to go up there alone...!
Shido!
Come on...get up...MOOOVE!

[Her strong will unsealed her Spirit power. Her cloths was half transformed into her astral dress]

Tohka:
...There you go, Tohka!
I can do it!

[Gun shot suddenly assaulted Tohka. She barely dodged the bullet]

Tohka:
Hey! Who did that?

[Kurumi appeared in front of Tohka]

Tohka:
Kurumi?!

Kurumi:
Good morning, Tohka.
Going anywhere?

---

[The barrier Kurumi generated completely swathed entire school. Shido and Kurumi were standing at the roof space]

Shido:
Kurumi, what is all of this about?!

Kurumi:
Isn't it pretty? ...my time eating castle?
This barrier sucks up the time from anyone who steps on my shadow...

Shido:
The time...?

[Kurumi showed her left eye. The clock in her left eye was rapidly moving to counterclockwise]

Shido:
Your eye's a clock...

Kurumi:
That's right. Which you looking at is my time.
Lovely thing...I suppose you called it my life span.
My angel has such a wonderful power...
But unfortunately, it does have that nasty habit to eating up my time whenever I use it.
So, I have to replenish with other people's time every once in a while...

Shido:
What...other people's time?

Kurumi:
Everyone is my pitiful, adorable prey...
But, you...you're special, Shido, who don't even realize it.
...Guess what? You're the reason I'm here...I came all this way just so I could become one with you in person, and see to look on your face then I eat you...

[Sudden change of Kurumi's face into sheer evil look intimidated Shido]

Shido:
Okay, fine! I'm the one you want!
So, don't hurt everyone else!

Kurumi:
I'll think that option...but first, I want you to take back what you said this morning.
Obviously, you are not going to save me now, are you...?

Shido:
...

Kurumi:
Come on, Shido...?
Don't you think I'm downright, awful to cause all this pain for such a silly reason?
You can say it...you hate me, and it's clear to you that I'm not someone who deserves mercy.
I will eat you...but first, I'm giving you the chance to take your words back.

[Kurumi reached her left hand to Shido, stroking his cheek]

Kurumi:
...Do that, darling? I'll reward you by taking down this barrier so those people won't die...?

Shido:
...!

Kurumi:
Eh heh heh heh...!

[Kurumi closed her face to Shido's right ear, whispering]

Kurumi:
So, what will it be, Shido...?
Better make your decision quickly...Or, there will be nothing left for you to save.

[Shido replied after he contemplate for a few seconds]

Shido:
...Take down the barrier, Kurumi.

[Kurumi chuckled for her win]

Shido:
Do it. But I will not give up on you.

Kurumi:
...!
Why are you so stubborn?

[She left herself from Shido, sighed]

Kurumi:
Ah...your choices confuse me.

[Kurumi leaped to some distant from Shido, raised her right hand. The spatial quake siren began alarming]

Kurumi:
You know that sound means, so what could I possibly be doing?

Shido:
It's the spatial quake alarm!

[Fraxinus. The sound of the alarm was ringing in the ship]

Kyouhei:
A quake? She can't, can she?

Reine:
She's causing a spatial quake on purpose.
We didn't know any Spirit could do that...

[Kurumi bust out laughing on the roof]

Kurumi:
Eh-heh...Heh heh heh...!
What is my little Shido going to do...?
If a spatial quake occurs now...?
What you are imagining will happen to all those unconscious students...?

Shido:
...!

Reine:
Shin, Kurumi's emotional condition has started changing...
It seems almost if she's frighten of you.

Shido:
...That's it...!

[Some idea came up in his mind]

Shido:
Listen! You've been saying you came here just you could eat me, right?
If that's true, stop the quake!
...If you don't stop it, I'll jump off this roof and kill my self.

[Shido stood on the fence of the roof space]

Kurumi:
You're making yourself for hostage...?
Nice threat, but...something tell me you're not gonna follow through with it.

Shido:
Watch me.

[Then, Shido leaned backward, began falling from the roof]

Kurumi:
!

[Kurumi immediately warped in her field, caught falling Shido's body in the midair. She brought him up, and drop him onto the roof space]

Shido:
Gwah! Ugh...

Kurumi:
Are you kidding me?!
Damn it...! That was incredibly stupid!

Shido:
Hah...I'm not a stupid as you think.
Because, now I know I have worth you as a hostage.
If you go ahead, and stop the spatial quake, that'd be great.
Oh, and take down the barrier while you are at it.
...If you refuse, I swear I'll kill myself.

[Kurumi irritated herself by Shido's deal]

Kurumi:
This is ridiculous!

[She snapped her finger, then the distortion in the air that cause the spatial quake, and the dark-purple field enveloped the entire school were disappeared]

Shido:
...Ah, there is one more thing.

Kurumi:
How much more can there be?

Shido:
I want you to allow yourself to have another chance.

Kurumi:
Huh...oh, we back to this?
Trust me, I'm more trouble than I'm worth.

Shido:
That isn't true...Even for you.

Kurumi:
...

Shido:
Listen to me, you can change and be happy if you want.
And, I know you do.
I know it...if that wasn't an option, you wouldn't have so much fun on our date.

Kurumi:
You're wrong...
It's too late.

Shido:
It's not too late!
I can help you!

Kurumi:
...

Shido:
Yes, you'll have to live with what you've done for rest of your life, but still, Kurumi...
It doesn't matter how terrible you've been.
Nothing will ever give me a reason not to save you!

Kurumi:
What...?
I---I don't know...

[Shido offered his right hand to take Kurumi's. He was smiling to her]

Kurumi:
Why are you so kind...?

[Kurumi was hesitatingly reaching her hand to Shido's]

Kurumi:
Am...am I worth it...?
Can I...?

[Almost her hand touched his hand, some shock attacked Kurumi. She stopped her motion]

Kurumi:
Agh...?!

Female voice:
It doesn't really work for us to have you fall for his pretty words, you know...?

Kurumi:
Haa...

[A white arm stuck out from Kurumi's berry. It pierced through her guts, skin, so the arm was smeared by her blood. Shido opened his eyes wide in the shock]

Kurumi:
I...Thank you so much, Shido...!

Female voice:
Well, that's that. Why don't you go back to rest now?

[The white arm disappeared into Kurumi's body, left a hole on her torso. Kurumi's cloths shined, and disappeared into the air. She collapsed onto the roof ground]

Female voice:
Goodness me...

Shido:
What...Kurumi...?
But...how?!

Kurumi:
It seems the me I chose for this interval might've been a little too young...

[White arms arose from the ground held the deceased Kurumi's body, sunk it to the dark-red pool. Other arms grabbed Shido's legs, made him unable to move]

Kurumi:
Look, now why don't we put a stop to tediousness already?

[Kurumi touched Shido's cheek. Then, turquoise light slashed her right arm, cut it half]

Shido:
Mana!

Mana:
Hi. Are you ever not in trouble, big brother?

Kurumi:
Eh, heh heh heh...
Right on time, like usual.
You've always have a strange ability to cut my spirit arm so easily?
This time, tough...things have change, so you might as well as accept that I won't die, and, you won't live!
Here me, Zafkiel! Come to me, now!

[The black thunder struck on right behind Kurumi. Next, the clock face taller than Kurumi emerged from the dark. Her waist was at the center of the clock, and her raised left hand was at the "XII", top letters of the clock]

Kurumi:
...Dalet.

[She pulled out her classic looking pistol, it sucked the black dust that generated from the clock, where "IV" printed. Then suddenly, she pushed its nozzle under her chin, pulled the trigger. And, anyhow, her cut arm flew back, connected to her again]

Shido:
Huh?!

Mana:
Your talent for healing is impressive.

Kurumi:
Ah ha ha ha!
I'm not healing at least!
I simply turning back the clock!
...Come, fight...let the fun begin!

Mana:
...Sure, bring it on.
I'll just kill you like I normally do.

Kurumi:
Eh heh heh heh...!
You still don't get it, do you?!
Try as much as you like. But, there's no way you'll ever be able to get rid of me completely!

Mana:
We'll see about that.
Get ready to die!

Kurumi:
Aleph!

[She called the name of the time. This time, it was "I" and her pistol sucked the dust generated the letter. And, she shot herself again. Mana looked at her in astonishment. But, within no time, Kurumi stood next to Mana, she pointed long classic looking rifle at Mana during Mana couldn't even notice. And she shot the rifle, Mana's barrier field could block the bullet, but she got blown away into the midair]

Mana:
Eek!

Shido:
Mana!

[Mana turned in the air, changed her direction to Kurumi. She tried to counter her. But, Kurumi leaped, almost teleported into right behind Mana, stamped her and made Mana drop from the sky]

Kurumi:
Zayin.

[This time, the letters "VII" produced dark aura]

Mana:
But, how?!

[After sucked the dark aura, Kurumi's pistol shot at Mana, froze her time]

Shido:
Mana, no!

[Kurumi's consecutive rifle shot hit at Mana's right thigh, belly, chest. When Mana's time thawed into the normal speed, those shots assaulted her simultaneously. Her shield barely made her remain alive, but she couldn't move anymore]

Shido:
She's alive!

Mana:
Please...don't come any closer...

Tohka, Origami:
Shido!

[Tohka and Origami just arrived at the roof space]

Shido:
You're here?!

Kurumi:
Oh, how sweet.
Looks like everyone made it.

Tohka:
Kurumi! You're gonna pay for what you're doing here!

Origami:
You can't run from us!

[Tohka and Origami glanced at each other, their timing was so harmonized]

Tohka, Origami:
Eh...?

Kurumi:
Whoa, I'm positively terrified!
To attack poor little Kurumi with so many people all at once?
Lucky for me, though...I'm playing for keeps today.

Mana:
Uggh...!

[Mana stood up despite to her damages. Kurumi began widening her shadow around her]

Kurumi:
Isn't that right, ladies?

[From the shadow, countless white arms arose, then they turned themselves into the shape of Kurumi]

Shido:
What the...hell is all this?

[Countless Kurumis were giggling]

Kurumi:
This is my past, my dear Shido...my history...they're beautiful, aren't they?
...Now do you understand why I can never fully be killed?

Tohka:
Where did they all come from?!

Kurumi:
Time.
Now, we need to finish this.

[All Kurumis aimed at Tohka, and others from every direction. It seemed there was no way to dodge all the bullet from them]

Kurumi:
Eh heh heh heh...!
After you're gone, I can be free.
There you go...You should really stop getting your hopes up on you, Shido...?
I've take some precautions to make sure you can't seduce me again...

[Kurumi raised her right hand to the sky, then the spatial quake alarm resumed its siren]

Shido:
No! You can't!

Kurumi:
Eh hee hee...
Prepared to be surrounded by so much death, the last that you want to save is me.

Shido:
PLEASE, NOOOO!

Kurumi:
Eh heh heh heh...!
Ah ha ha ha...! 
A-HA HA HA HA HA...!

[Kurumi clenched her hand, then thrust it down. While all the student were still unconscious, laid in the school, a spatial quake's black sphere began to form in the right above the school building, swelling. But, just the black ball about touch the building, purple wind blew, cancelled the deformation of the space. The spatial quake disappeared, and the original blue sky returned as if nothing had happened]

Shido:
...

Kurumi:
...What is the meaning of this?

Girl:
You mean, you didn't know?
Surprise, surprise...
Spatial quakes can be neutralized if they run into a tremor of equal force at the onset.

[The girl was invested by flames. She wore an ancient raiment, and a robe of feathers. She had a pair of horns which came out from right above her ears, grew to upward. Her long, red hair trailing. She was Kotori]

Origami:
Ah...!

[Origami opened her eyes wide, her eyeball went into convulsions. Almost, she looked in fear]

Origami:
It's...her...!

Shido:
What...sis...?

Kotori:
