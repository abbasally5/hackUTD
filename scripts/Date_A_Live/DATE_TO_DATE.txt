  Shido:
Truth, Iâ€™m meant to Lolita chicks...
I try to go by the elementally school whenever the little girls have PE because I love watching them so much.
Such smooth, flat, innocent bodies...I can barely contain my Sandalphon when I see them...
I get turned on by little elementary school girls.

Origami:
Huh.
...That's cool.

Shido:
It is?!
...Yeah, but, that's not all.
I also have a serious mother complex, and kiss my mom's picture before school every morning.
And, then, when I get home, I change in the baby cloths and baby talk.
I mean, I have a pacifier in everything!

Origami:
Huh.

Shido:
...I have a sister complex, too.
I make Kotori sleep next to me.
When she's not home, I totally sneak into her room to smell her blanket.
Just a blanket. Though, I draw a line to smell her panties because that will be too creepy, so I did just her blazer!

Origami:
Huh.

Shido:
Ugh...Well, on top of that, I'm not faithful. I've got like ten girls right now.
So, I sneaked out of my house all the time. How else am I gonna head up to the club? Am I right?
The club is where you meant the ladies, you feel me?
And, more ladies I have to butt her, and when I say, have them, I mean, do them, obviously!

Origami:
...

Shido:
(Did that get her?!)

Origami:
So, I'll just have to exterminate all of them.

Shido:
You have to what...?
Are you kidding me?

Kotori:
What the crap? Crazy...
None of that got to her?

Shido:
I have no idea what I should do now...

Kotori:
Well, this date just have gotten started, so maybe take that whining down or not?!

Shido:
Haa...
(I guess if she's right...I don't wanna accepted. But, this is supposed to be us...on a date)


--- OP ---

Narration:
Pervert, that is...
Like a rosebud blooming.
Like a butterfly flying in the night.
I can't stop the loneliness.
Who knew this side of me?
...Who knew?

---

Tohka:
I'm so excited, Shido!
Look! It's called a "Cell phone!"
Kotori gave it to me. Isn't it super neat?!

Shido:
Super neat.

Tohka:
I hope it's OK that her had put your number inside...I want to call you first!

Shido:
Yeah, that's fine.

Tohka:
Yeaaay!

Shido:
Where are you going?!

Tohka:
I'm going faraway before I call you!

Shido:
Ha ha ha...
Eh?!

Origami:
Hi.
Tomorrow, we should go walk around together.

Shido:
Er...do you mean like on a...

Origami:
Like a date.

Shido:
Right, sorry but I'm gonna be busy...uh?

Origami:
We are going out, aren't we?

Shido:
Yeah, we sure are...

Origami:
Good. That's what I thought.
I'm waiting you in front of the park statue at ten o'clock sharp.

Tohka:
Shido!
I think I don't know how to make a call!

Shido:
Gwah!

Tohka:
Oh, oops!

---

Kotori:
Hey, what's up, big bro?

Shido:
Origami asked me out on a date...

Kotori:
What?

Shido:
...Kotori?

Kotori:
...My professional advice is just to ignore her.

Shido:
I'm the one who made her think we're going out start off with.
I don't want to hurt her feelings anymore than I probably already have...

Kotori:
Uh...fine, whatever you want.
I guess we can just make her hate you, and then you'll be off the hook.

Shido:
Cool.

---

Kotori:
So, how do you like the cloths we choose for you?

Shido:
Ah, they're pretty awful.

Kotori:
We're at almost an hour after you supposed to meet up with her.

Shido:
I got it.

Kyouhei:
The AI setting change is complete.

Kotori:
I've done a lot of research to make this worst possible date you've ever had.
All you have to do is what I say.

Shido:
That's fine. I trust you.

Kotori:
Tell me you gave Tohka something else to do like I asked?

Shido:
Yup. I had her go buy stuff for dinner.

Tohka:
I need to buy some of your pork, please?

Kotori:
Great. But, we'll keep monitoring her just in case.
We do not want you bumping into her.
You ready to make first contact? Hmm.

---

Shido:
Hey there!

Origami:
Uh.

Shido:
Heh heh heh...

Origami:
Oh, good.

Shido:
Huh?

Origami:
I was worried something had happened to you.

Shido:
Agh...!

Kotori:
Get it together!
If you let something on that bother you, you're never gonna get through this!

Shido:
Yeah, you're right...

Origami:
Cloths.

Shido:
Um?
O-oh, er, I...

Origami:
...Do you like mine?

Shido:
Do I like yours?!
Sure, ri---

Kotori:
This isn't go word counts!

Shido:
Yeah! What I meant to say was that they...suck.

Origami:
Well, what would you prefer, then?

Kotori:
Make your choices, guys!

Shido:
...
Um...A school swimsuit with dog ears and tail.
Ugh...
(Here comes the beat down! ...Or, not?)
...Huh?
Waaaah!
Where is the world did you get those cloths!

Origami:
By the store near by.
I'm pretty lucky, huh?

Shido:
(I have no idea...What is this town coming to...?!)

Origami:
Let's go.

Shido:
Huh...? Into town...?

Kotori:
Why didn't that make her happiness meter go down...?
...
Nice. Very nice.
All of them are beyond nasty.
Your choices!
Shido, first option.

Shido:
Uh?!
Er...for a bitch like you to walk at the same level as a human is so presumptuous.
Ugh...get on your hands and knees...!
I said on your knees! Bitch!
Eh?!
...Arrrgghhh?!

Kotori:
Oh! No way!

Origami:
Whine...

Shido:
Wha---ah?!

Origami:
Woof.

Shido:
She, what?!

Origami:
Hah hah hah...

Woman:
I didn't think those kind of couples for real...

Man:
Nah, must be movie shoot or something.

Child:
Mommy, is that a dog?

Mother:
Don't look at! Stop pointing!

Shido:
...Wait!
I am so sorry...!

Origami:
Woof.

---

Shido:
(And now, the pervert coming out plan just failed miserably...)

Kotori:
That is one hard nut to crack!

Shido:
Um?

Origami:
Restroom.

Kotori:
Shido, go with three.

Shido:
Won't that be sad for her...?

Kotori:
Just do it already!
I thought you wanna over today!

Shido:
I...I won't let you go.

Origami:
Huh?

Shido:
I said that, I...won't let you go.

Origami:
You mean...you want me to do it here?

Shido:
Huh?!
No! Stop!

Origami:
...Pee on you?

Shido:
Huh?

Origami:
Over you other [beep] on you instead?

Shido:
Huh?!

Kyouhei:
What?!
...Total perveeeeert!

Kotori:
You are the one who talk?!

---

Shido:
I'm gonna get drink from the vending machine...
Wait for me around here...

Origami:
Sure, all right.

Kotori:
That is some freak job.
Makes me want to take inside her twisted head!

Shido:
I can't take it anymore of this...

Kotori:
For once, I agree.
It's time for our last resort.
Okay, Shido, you're gonna have to become her real boyfriend.

Shido:
What?

Kotori:
If she accept the fact that you two are dating, then you can break up with her, and have an official end.

Shido:
Oh, I see what you mean.
I guess I'll have to do something like that to make her hate me.
Or, she'll never let this thing go...

Kotori:
You've got one chance.
Practice what you want to say now, while you can.

Shido:
Yeah, OK.

Tohka:
Just one more left.
Yay!
I have to say I'm doing pretty well on my first errand!
Shido needs to give me a pat on the head, moving so fast!
Alright, almost done!
Hmm...? Sa-ta an-der-gi...I wonder what that is?
That sounds like it's some important for sure...?
Oh, I should ask Shido about this earlier...
On second thought, that's the whole reason I have this!
To your magic cellphone!
...Now, where was that contacts list?

Shido:
Ahem...Let's break up.
See, to tell you the truth, I just don't love you anymore.

Tohka:
What? Really?

Shido:
Yes. I want this to be over.

Tohka:
But, that's not that I want.

Shido:
I hope you understand.

Tohka:
But, I don't understand!
You hate me?

Shido:
I do. Yes, the fact is that I do hate you.
...Huh?

Tohka:
Oh, Shido...

Shido:
Who is this?

Tohka:
(Sob)

Shido:
Oh, it sounds like Tohka.
Argh! This is bad!

Kotori:
That was Tohka.
There was sudden change in her emotional state.
And, her Spirit powers are flowing back into her at a frightening pace.

Shido:
How's this happen?!

Reine:
In order for the phone we gave her to work during different emergencies.
We made it so that it would connect to the head-set when she called you.

Shido:
What?! No one told me that!

Kotori:
This is hardly the time to be complaining, Shido.
Right now, you'll find the park just outside the shopping arcade.
Go before it's too late!

Origami:
Shido, where did you run off to?

Shido:
Sorry! I need to hang there for a while!
...Tohka!

Tohka:
Oh...hi, Shido...

Shido:
I didn't mean what I said.

Tohka:
What...?

Shido:
I'm sorry.

Tohka:
You...you mean it?

Shido:
I do.

Tohka:
You don't hate me? So, you really don't hate me?

Shido:
Of course not.
How could anybody hate you?

Tohka:
Then, we...we don't have to be separated now and all?

Shido:
No, we don't:

Tohka:
So, we can be together forever?

Shido:
Nn-huh.
Together forever.

Tohka:
I'm so glad...I'm so glad...!

Shido:
Eh?

Tohka:
...What do you think?
I did my errand well, huh?!

Shido:
Yeah, yeah.
You did awesome!

Tohka:
Ha ha...
Nn-huh?

Shido:
Er...?
Wh---! Origami?!

Origami:
Together...forever.

Shido:
Um...what?

Tohka:
Get away from him, you!
When he said, he was talking to me!

Origami:
Well, that's not possible.
I'm positive that Shido was saying those things to me.

Shido:
What's going on...?
Eh?! Ah!
Oh, great...Origami heard everything too...?

Kotori:
Well, that's funny...Origami Tobiichi's happiness meter has gone past full.
I've never seen that happen before.
Congratulations, bro.

Shido:
Hee heh heh...

---

Origami:
Waaa.
You will paaaay.

Tohka:
Haaaaaah!!!

Origami:
Humh humh humh...

Tohka:
Origami Tobiichi, you stupid-head!
Ra ta ta ta ta...Take that!
Haa...I feel little better now.

Shido:
What?!
Just a little?!
This can not be okay...

Kotori:
So, I guess, why in the beginning of a date, has to be you knew a thing or something.
You don't have time to whine, Romio!

Shido:
Hah...(Here we go again...the dates must go on)

---

Tohka:
What exactly do you think you are doing, Origami?!

Origami:
I'm being with Shido.
What exactly are you doing?

Tohka:
Stop!

Origami:
Do not get in the way.

Tohka:
You're the one who's in the way!

Origami:
Wrong. You're the one who is in the way.

Tohka:
Quit repeating everything I've said!
You are in the way!

Origami:
No. You are.

Tonomachi:
Yo.

Shido:
Yo.
...Cool?

Tonomachi:
I know.
Adorable, right?
Nn-huh, it's Ottore, a.k.a. the rainbow fur seal, totally wanted at the arcade.

Shido:
I wanna those gross-cute things.
How get that? Wow...

Tohka:
You thief! Well, listen to me, bastard! You won't get away with saying that again!

Origami:
I only speak the truth.

Tohka:
Lies! Ngg...

Tonomachi:
There's flannel animal series popular with chicks.
These are some of the different kinds.

Shido:
Oh, I sort of like that one.

Tonomachi:
Nice. That's the dream panda, Pandarone.

Shido:
Uh? Sorry, hand on a sec.

Tonomachi:
Nah, don't worry about me.
Converse to heart's content.
...And, I can take this time to chat with my girlfriend.

Shido:
Hey, what's up, Kotori?

Kotori:
What do you think you are doing, jerk-face!
Tohka's happiness meter just dropped out of nowhere!

Shido:
Huh?

Kotori:
Don't you "huh" me!
Did you forget what's gonna happen?

Reine:
If Tohka's emotional state becomes unstable, it's possible the Spirit power you sealed off will flow back into her.
It might be a good idea to let her blow off some steam.

Shido:
Blow off some steam?
Like how?

Reine:
Let's see...She enjoy the arcade, right?

---

Tohka:
Origami Tobiichi! You big dummy!
...
Won! Which one's next?
...
Take that! You horrible girl!
You're so gross!
Ngg...You have an outie! ...A ha ha ha!
Flat chest floozie!
Killjoy!

Origami:
Oh no...
I'm going to eat your brains and stuff...

Tohka:
Pervert dummy!
Ha ha ha ha...! ...Ya!

Shido:
Will you please stop that?!

Tohka:
The arcade is a pretty fun place, Shido!
Thanks for taking me!

Nakatsugawa:
All right. Let's bring this mess up.
Make it quick, you guys.
We gotta need to replace that with a new one, ASAP.

Shido:
Wait, I know them.
Ratatoskr, right?

Kotori:
Of course. We organized with the arcade beforehand.

Reine:
I don't like this.

Kotori:
Don't like what?

Reine:
I show Tohka's happiness meter's rising smoothly, but her uneasiness numbers remain high.
It appears she is rather worrying about something.

Kotori:
Huh...Fine, well, why don't we let her play some more, and see what happens.

Tohka:
Hey, what's up, Shido?

Kotori:
This should be fun. Go take a cute picture together.

Shido:
It's called a photo booth.
Basically, takes pictures of you.

Tohka:
Ah! It takes pictures?!

Shido:
What's wrong?

Tohka:
It's just...I'm not really comfortable taking those picture things...

Shido:
Hey, seriously?
Well, let's do something else.

Tohka:
Er...! It's fine...
Shido, I'll do it if you wanna picture of me.

Shido:
Er...yeah, I'd like that.

Tohka:
Just this once...
I'll do it for you, Shido.

Shido:
Hold on, what about me?

Tohka:
No way! Don't come in here!
Hold your horses! Stupid, stupid boy!

Shido:
I'm confused...?

Kotori:
I have no clue she was camera shy...?

Reine:
I've only took her picture once during my examination of her...so, yeah, that must be it.

Shido:
Hi, you're well done?
Or...?

Tohka:
Please don't look at here.

Shido:
Oh, okay...?

Ai:
Oh, my god.
Did you guys hear those like a couple going around breaking all the machines?

Mai:
I heard the girl is the one breaking stuff.

Mei:
That's so lame.

Origami:
Ah!
...I'm out of coins.
I'll be back.

Tohka:
Make sure you're by yourself when you look at that picture, okay?

Shido:
Sure, okay.

Tohka:
Ah!

Shido:
Oh, this?
If you want one, I can get it for you.

Tohka:
No! What's the point if I don't do it myself?!

Shido:
...Go for it.
You've done the crane game before, anyway.
I bet you can get it.

Tohka:
Yes!
...Oh, look! I did it, Shido.

Shido:
Nicely done, Tohka!

Tohka:
Tee hee.

Shido:
Crap...I think it might've gotten stuck.
I'll get someone who works here...

Tohka:
Are you ready to go home now, Shido?

Shido:
Yes...

Nakatsugawa:
Good. The exchanges complete.

Origami:
Let's play.

---

Tohka:
I want to give this to you.

Shido:
You do?

Tohka:
I do. I'm not exactly sure how to explain why...
I guess, it's because...I want you to have it, so you don't hate me anymore.

Shido:
What? I don't hate you.

Tohka:
But, at school, Origami told me that you hated me...

Origami:
It is impossible for humans to ever accept Spirits who kill the world.
And, Shido, well, he definitely hates Spirits.

Tohka:
Haa...that's what this is about.

Tohka:
So then, that's the truth...?

Shido:
Absolutely not.

Tohka:
Absolutely...?

Shido:
Absolutely.

Tohka:
Really absolutely?

Shido:
Yup. Really absolutely.

Tohka:
Really absolutely...like, for real?

Shido:
Really absolutely, really absolutely like, for real for real.
Plus, I wouldn't go on a date with someone...that I...that I didn't like.

Tohka:
Ah. That's true.
I feel the same way.

Shido:
You hang on to that, Tohka.

Tohka:
Huh?

Shido:
Like, a memento for today.

Tohka:
Yes...yes I will.

Kotori:
Seventy-five points.
I guess that counts as passing.

---

Tonomachi:
What's with you Tohka? You're in a good mood today.

Tohka:
Yeah! I can't help it!
Shido took me out to a fun place yesterday!

Tonomachi:
Well, all right! Way to go, Shido!

Tohka:
There was punching and hitting and random bullets, and it felt so good...!

Ai:
He...did, what...?

Mai:
Where the hell did that creep take you?!

Shido:
No, wait! It's not what it sounds!

Ai:
Oh!

Shido:
Ah!

Mai:
Ah! Oh, Tohka?!

Mei:
That is so lame!

Ai:
You can have this back...

Shido:
Oh, thank you.
I left this in my pocket and forgot all about it.
Ugh...

Tohka:
Why'd you bring my picture here?!

Shido:
Why are you naked?!

Tohka:
Because Reine told me I was supposed to take my cloths off when I took a picture!

Shido:
You guys! It was just a misunderstanding!

Origami:
Good morning.
...So, here.

Shido:
Huh?

Origami:
It's for you.

Shido:
Oh...you, really didn't have to...

Origami:
Just take it.

Shido:
Okay...thank you.

Origami:
Now, we match.

Tohka:
Wait up, Shido!
You can't just leave this picture behind!
Uh? ...Huh, look, we match!
