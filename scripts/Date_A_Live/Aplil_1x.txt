  [30 years ago, in the vicinity of Sino-Mongolian border. A butterfly was flying around peaceful glassy plain. But suddenly, blue sky deformed, fell down to the ground. From the point where deformed sky touched to the ground, black spherical thing born, spread. The black ball burned, swallowed forests, cities, people. It's size was visible when you look down to Earth from space. A diameter of the black thing swelled to several thousand kilo meters]

Shido:
The Eurasian Continent was attacked by a massive spatial quake.
There were one hundred fifteen million victims on this unprecedented event.
And, now...

--- OP ---

Kotori:
Waaaake up!
A-ha-ha!

[Kotori stepped cheerful dance on Shido, over his blanket. She wore a school uniform. White sailor blouse and short length, navy-blue pleated skirt. Her panty's flashing]

Shido:
My little sister is getting me what the possibly be the worst wake up call ever.
Ugg...Kotori...! Daring little sister of mine...

Kotori:
Aha! What is it, daring big brother of mine?

Shido:
Get off of me!
You're too big!
Ugh!

Kotori:
Aha!

[Kotori jumped up high from Shido. At the highest point in air, she flashed her panty again. And, fall on her brother's stomach with her left foot]

Shido:
Oww! ...Cough! Agh...

Kotori:
Aha ha. Sorry, did that hurt?
I bet you wake, though.

[But Shido stubbornly resisted to wake up. He covered entirely over himself, and tried to keep sleeping]

Kotori:
Hey! Stop just go right back to sleep!
Wake up! Come on, wake up sleepy head!
Wake up!

[Kotori mounted her brother, tried to get rid of his blanket. Somehow, she seemed be little amused]

Shido:
Listen to me...all the way...

Kotori:
Huh?

Shido:
I've contracted the mysterious ten-more-minutes-of-sleep-or-else-my-sister-goes-to-tickle-hell-virus...
Often referred to as the T-virus for short...

Kotori:
What?! You got...what?!

[Seemed, Kotori got gravely scared]

Shido:
Run away, Kotori...Run!
While I can control myself!

Kotori:
Wait!
But then, what's gonna happen to you, bro...?

Shido:
As long as you're safe...it doesn't matter what happens on me...
Run away...

Kotori:
No, I can't...I can't leave you!

[Shido suddenly removed blanket from him, his face colored ghastly pale, eyes blackened. And began roared]

Shido:
GRAAAAAH!

Kotori:
EEEEEK!

[Kotori dashed from her brother's room. Shido laughed triumphantly]

Shido:
Hee...hee...hee...
...Okay. Much better.

[Shido changed his cloth from pajama to school uniform. He entered dining room]

Shido:
Um?

[Behind the sofa and the table stood on its side, Kotori had been hiding and trembling in fear]

Kotori:
Oww...I don't wanna go to tickle hell...! Someone help me...!

Shido:
Heh!

[Shido sneaked on behind the sofa, and appeared himself to his sister, by horrific way]

Shido:
BWAGRAAAH!

Koroti:
EEEEEK!

Shido:
...It's me.
Calm down, it's only me.

Kotori:
Are---are you sure...?

Shido:
I am much good friend to you.
Yes, I, Kotori's big brother.

Kotori:
Phew...
Ha...Aha ha ha ha!

News caster:
A spatial quake was recorded early this morning near the center of Tengu city.
There was only slight damage. With no casualty among residence near the area.
Investigation's continue. Has to the cause of the spatial quake---

[Shido broke an egg, preparing breakfasts while listening TV news]

Shido:
Again? Some close, too.

Kotori:
It was.

[Shido was looking for inside the refrigerator, picked out slices of bacon and something. And, he asked her sister which she preferred to]

Shido:
Spatial quakes, wide spread vibration phenomena.
An area randomly starts vibrating, and no one knows why.
This quake's so irrational, mysterious, unbelievably destructive.
After the mass of catastrophe thirty years ago, spatial quake continue around the world for six terrifying months.
In Japan, the Great Southern Kanto Spatial Quake completely flatten the area, not too far from our house.
It was total devastation.
In the twenty-five years after that, nothing happened.
Nothing...until five years ago when a spatial quake showed up in the redeveloped Tengu city.
Not long after that, we started hearing about quakes all the time.
Most of which occurred here, in Japan. It's weird.
They have been a lot lately.

Kotori:
Not telling me.

[In the TV show, it showed the area devastated by spatial quake. The area dented, like 30meter or so width crater. Watching it made Kotori squinted her eyes]

Kotori:
(This is happening earlier than planned...)

[And, Shido's expression was also stern]

Shido:
Hold it!
No sweets!

[Shido scolded her sister. He tried to confiscate her pop candy, but she never released the candy from her mouth]

Kotori:
Nn~!!

Shido:
Seriously...
(Sigh) Just make sure you eat breakfast, okay?

[Kotori took out the pop candy, and smiled, winked to her brother]

Kotori:
Aha! OK, bro.
I love you!

[There was a calendar hanged on the wall. Its 10th day was marked by thick red circle, and it was written "The Opening Ceremony!" under the date]

Shido:
Oh, hey. Got any request for lunch?

Kotori:
Oh, yeah! One Deluxe kid's plate! Hurray!

Shido:
And, that's for a diner's menu...
We don't serve that dish at this restaurant.

Kotori:
Ahh?! Come on...
Please! Pretty please!
Look that cherry on top? It's yummy!

[Kotori begged with her hands put together. Vexed looking Shido bit his toast]

---

Kotori:
Deluxe kid's plate wins!
I'm love eating out for lunch...!

[Shido and Kotori walked along to their school]

Shido:
It's a diner! Not that exciting.

Kotori:
Ya-hah. Thank you so much, bro.
Okay, so after school, I'll be waiting for you right here in front of the restaurant.

Shido:
Sounds good.

Kotori:
And don't break your promise!
Be here no matter what happens!
Even if the place's taking over by terrorists, we still eat!

Shido:
If that goes down, I doubt they let us stay.
I'll be here. Be careful on your way to school.

[Shido patted her sister's head. Three school girls stared the conversation between Shido and Kotori from the distance, looked sullen]

Ai:
Hey, isn't that Shido Itsuka?

Mai:
Didn't they seem too close? 'Cause I've heard he's gotta weird sister complex.

Mei:
That's so lame...

[Kotori started to run to her school. She turned back to her brother, waved her hand]

Kotori:
Don't forget, you promised me!
So, I'm gonna be here ready to eat even if a spatial quake happens.

Shido:
Great. Now, go to school already.

[Shido waved back his hand. Then, somebody held Shido's hand from behind him]

Tonomachi:
Well, hey there.
What's up?

Shido:
Hey, Tonomachi.

Tonomachi:
You ready for the semester?
You sure look like you are...

[Three girls gave inquisitive looking to Shido and Tonomachi]

Ai:
Ow, have you also heard rumors about him?

Mai:
Yeah, he swims both ways they say...

Mei:
That's so lame.

Ai:
Hm...?

[Ai noticed that mysterious white short haired girl stared at Shido from behind an utility pole]

Mai:
Are you OK, Ai?

Mei:
I'm perfect.
I just saw, super genius creeping...

Girl C:
That's so lamme.

---

[A school. In the class 2-4]

Tonomachi:
Nice coincidence, aren't, Shido?
Lucky you being putting in the same class with me again.
Some people would call this fate.
I would be one of the those people...

Shido:
Of course you would...

[Tonomachi's smart phone rang]

Tonomachi:
Hold on. Excuse me...It's my girl.

Shido:
What?
Girl? Like girl friend?

Tonomachi:
Oh yeah. You wanna meet her?
Check it out!

[He showed his smartphone's display to Shido. The message "Touch Me!!", the game's title "Fall in love: My little Seed", and pink color haired 2D school girl, wearing pink colored sailor collar blouse, were showed on the display]

Tonomachi:
That's a dating sim.

Shido:
Yeah, so what?

Tonomachi:
Doesn't change the fact she's my girl friend.
Don't judge me. A dating sim will tell you everything you need to know about how to tread women.
It's like a text book for loving!
This particular add is groovy because she lived...

Origami:
Shido Itsuka.

[A girl with white short hair, dark blue eyes called Shido]

Shido:
Who...Me?

Origami:
Yes.

[She wore black blazer, blue pleated skirt. The design that had white hem on blazer collar was the same to the Shido wearing]

Shido:
How do you know my name?

Origami:
You mean, you don't remember?

[She sat her chair without waiting Shido's answer. Her desk was next to Shido's. Shido whispering to Tonomachi so he wasn't heard by Origami]

Shido:
Hey...who is she?
Am I supposed to know her?

Tonomachi:
Of course you are!
That is Origami Tobiichi, otherwise knownst as super genius!

Shido:
For real? Crazy.
(She knows me...?)

Tonomachi:
That chick always has some of the best grade in our class.
She's ridiculous has sports. And, I mean, look at her! Gorgeous!
On my-girls-I-probably-ought-to-have-the-girl-friend list, she's never been out of the top 3, like, ever!
How do you not know one of the most popular kids in our school?
But, more importantly, why in the world this Origami know who you are?

Shido:
I wish I knew, but I have no idea.

[Then, chime rang. Everyone in the class sat their own the chair. A homeroom teacher was entered into the class. She has chestnut colored hair, seemed popular among boy students]

Tonomachi:
Oh! Heck yeah! It's Tamae!

Okamine:
It's Ms. Okamine, please?
Now, quiet down. I'll be your homeroom teacher this year.
I hope you guys are ready to learn.

[Everyone in the classroom clapped their hands, except Origami. She was staring at Shido intently]

Shido:
(Origami Tobiichi...Why's she know who I am? And, why's she looking at me? So weird...What the heck is going on?)

---

[Clock tower's clock reached just noon. The bell rang]

Tonomachi:
Hey, Shido.
Wanna go home together?

Shido:
Sorry, I've got plans.

Tonomachi:
Oh yeah? Is it a girl?

Shido:
Technically. It's just Kotori, though.

Tonomachi:
Oh, I understand.
Besides, as far as I know, there's not a girl in this school with a sensitive in kind enough spirit to have lunch with you.

[Shido had got a sullen face]

Shido:
Thanks. But, that was not a compliment.

[Suddenly, a siren blown]

Announce:
Your attention please.
This is not a drill. They have been precursory signs...

Shido:
A spatial quake!

Tonomachi:
Another one?

Shido:
We need evacuate.
The shelter in the school should be safe enough...

[Origami stood up, walked away on her own. Shido's eyes chased her]

Announce:
I Repeat. There have been precursory signs...

Shido:
(Where's she going...?)

---

[The blue hologram display floated in the dark room, showing analysis graphics of some kind of power field]

Unknown man A:
Kontri era. Aura uv eutrimis klub.[?]

Unknown woman:
Kontensi tero to shigersa trique conmaifen.[?]

Unknown man B:
Monsto, tome he[?] "Princess!"

Unknown man C:
Ahh, she is here...

---

["Spatial quake warning issued." The sign stood beside the road]

Announce:
I repeat. They have been precursory signs for impending spatial quakes in this vicinity, please evacuate to near shelter immediately. This is not a drill. I repeat. They have been precursory signs for impending spatial quake...

[Right after town's people evacuated into the shelter entrance. The entrance shut down and sank into the ground. Train cars on the rail sank too. While students walked to shelter, Teacher Okamine got quite upset herself]

Okamine:
Ah! Everyone, please cool down! Let don't forget 3Ds! Don't push! Don't Run! Don't mock with! Huh!

Tonomachi:
You might wanna take it down, Miss coach.

Okamine:
Of course. You're right. I'm sorry.

[Shido was making phone call, with anxious face]

Shido:
(I hope Kotori is evacuating run. She should...Surely she's not still gonna try to meet me at the diner...)

[Shido recalled what Kotori said in the morning]

Kotori:
I'll be here even the spatial quake happens!

Shido:
(Come on...! Please, don't waiting at that diner!
She has to found her shelter...She's fine. She gotta be fine!
I bet the shelter she's in just has bat reception. Or, she has a phone in silent or something.
I need check her location...Just in case...)

[Shido operated his phone to show his sister's location. The app located his sister at the diner on the map]

Shido:
!

[Shido imagined his sister sat, crying in the front of the restaurant. He lost his control]

Shido:
No!

Tonomachi:
Hey, wait! Shido!

[Shido was running through the city, outside of the shelter. Kotori's smiling face circulated in his mind]

Kotori:
Okay, bro. I love you!

Shido:
(Why?!)

Kotori:
Thank you so much, bro!

Shido:
(Why?! Why did she not just take shelter! The city's about to be destroyed. She's worried about promise?! Kotori...Kotori...! Kotori!)

[When Shido turned the corner to enter small avenue, a black ball erupted. The ball was gaining its size as it swallow the buildings of the city. The shock wave blew off Shido]

Shido:
Aagh!

[The black ball was getting bigger and bigger, but it's evaporated just before it swallowed Shido]

Shido:
Wow...what was that?

[After the place black ball had grown, a huge crater made. Shido lost his voice with looking the sight. However, he found a girl stood at the center and the bottom of the crater. The girl wore some kind of armor. Its color was purple. The color was matched with her long straight hair and her eyes. She stared Shido with dauntless manner]

Shido:
(It's...a girl? What's she doing...?)

[The girl grabbed the hilt of her broad sword with her two hands. Pulled it from its scabbard, or dais. Swung. The sword created purple electric shock wave. Its run just next to Shido, and its impact vanished another building behind Shido]

"Princess":
Not you too...

[The girl leveled her sword, pointed at Shido]

"Princess":
I see. So, it's true...
You came here to kill me.

Shido:
...

[Shido couldn't say anything. Fell down on the ground with his legs lost its strength]

"Princess":
Do not try denying you are here to kill me...
I'll deal with you before the others are arrive.

Shido:
Wait! Just wait, please!
That's...it's not why I came here!

"Princess":
What?!

Shido:
I---I can never kill anybody...
Is that what you're here for?

[The "Princess" squinted her eyes slightly. Then, she noticed something approaching to her from sky, turned herself to that direction. Five mechanical armored girls wearing jet wings appeared, launched rocket missiles to the Princess]

Shido:
Uwaaah!

[The Princess thrust her left arm, created purple light shield in front of her, blocked all missiles]

"Princess":
Why do they not realize the futility of their attacks.

[She jumped high, swung her sword. The sword cut off all the missiles the mech-squad girls another launched]

Shido:
(This isn't just any girl...)

[the Princess turned back to see Shido. For unknown reason, she had had very sad looking face]

Shido:
(If she that strong...why did she look so sad?)

[Mech-squad didn't stop their attacks. They fired missiles one after another. The Princess wielded her sword, dropped all missiles off. She cross swung her sword, and some electric shock wave created. All mech-squad girls dodged. As the Princess landed to the ground, one girl of the mech-squad aimed her laser blaster to the Princess, at point-blank range. She shot the blaster, but the Princess raised her left hand, stopped and voided laser beam's energy. The princess slashed at the mech-squad girl, but the girl anyhow dodged Princess's attack. The girl lost one mechanical wing of two she reared. She detached flying equipment, jumped over Shido, and landed to near him. Shido could see girl's face]

Shido:
To...Tobiichi? Is that you?!

Origami:
Shido...It's you.

Shido:
Uh, why are you wearing those cloths?

[The princes attacked them with the shock wave she created from sword slash]

Shido:
Gwaah!

[Shido was blown away. Origami jumped, and activated her light saver and cut at the Princess. The Princess blocked Origami's slash, and they began cut at each other. The fight was so fast, couldn't see what they actually do. When they slashed each other wither their full strength, and their swords crushed each other, white flash flushed. And, Shido enveloped the blinding light]

---

Woman:
Coordinates SJ-8020 the target "Princess" has been lost.

Man:
Their reaction way too load affection threshold.
That is confirmed.

Shido:
...Hello?

Mysterious Voice:
Finally, we made again.

Shido:
Who are you?

Mysterious Voice:
I'm so glad. But, just wait...
Just a little while longer...
I won't ever let you go again.
I won't ever be wrong again.
Soon...

---

Shido:
Ah!

Reine:
Hmm...It appears you are awake now.

[In front of Shido. A woman whose face had unhealthily pale and had dark rings under her eyes]

Shido:
Wait. I don't know you. Who are you?

Reine:
My name is Reine Murasame. Just call me Reine.
I'm the head analyst here. There's no reason you freaked out.
The first aid is hardly out of my league.

Shido:
(That supposed to be reassuring...?)
So...here's a question...?
Where exactly am I?

Reine:
You're resting in Fraxinus's sick bay.
You were unconscious, so was decided this for the best course of action.

Shido:
Fraxinu...what now?
Did I pass-out?
All right...I ended up in the middle of that thick fight...wait, Kotori!
But, my sister! I need to go find my sister!
She's waiting for me in front of the diner!
She could be...!

Reine:
What you need is calm down.
You sister is perfectly fine.

Shido:
What?!
She is?

Reine:
I'm assuming you want some sort of explanation now.
Apologies, but that isn't really my forte.
You should ask the vice commander for more details...

[Reine brought Shido to another room. There was young man standing. His hair was blond, long]

Reine:
I'm brought him with me.

Kyouhei:
Thank you for taking care of it.
It's very nice to meet you. My name is Kyouhei Kanaduki. And, I am the vice commander.
Welcome, Shido. We glad you here.

[After greeting to Shido, Kyouhei humbly gestured Shido to turn himself right. Above the stage, surrounded by operating console machine. A girl sat on her chair]

Shido:
Kotori...?

Kotori:
Glad you could make it, bro.
Like idiot said, welcome to Ratatoskr.

---

[The scene was changed on some military base. Huge body plane, four tanks, were outside of the building. A dozen people wearing engineering suit looked maintaining those plane, vehicles]

Man:
Penetration angle, checked!
Main earth[?], set!

[Origami Tobiichi flew to her stand, attached her backpack to it]

Origami:
Release connection.

[After she detached from her back pack, seemed from exhaustion, she could not stand her own, began to fall. Her colleague held her body so she didn't fall down to the ground]

Kusakabe:
I got you. Good work.

Origami:
Capt. Kusakabe...

Kusakabe:
You're working yourself too hard!
Take it easy, okay?

---

[Fraxinus. Kotori was showing a girl called the "Princess" on the display to Shido]

Kotori:
This thing is a monster called a "Spirit" who's lost now long ago...that means disappeared.
This is what we call---

Shido:
Wait, will you shut up for a second?

Kotori:
Don't be rude.
The commander's taking the time to explain everything to you personally!
You should on your knees bowing in gratitude.
If you want, I certainly wouldn't mind letting you lick my boots while you down there.

Kyouhei:
What?! Really I can?!

Kotori:
Hum!

[Kotori hit Kyouhei's belly, so strong that impact could be visible as his back deformed]

Kyouhei:
Urgh...!
Oh year...Thank you for that, commander...!

[Somehow, he looked so happy, and crumbled down to the ground]

Shido:
And er...You are Kotori?

Kotori:
Of course.
Have you forgotten my face looks like? Shido?

Shido:
No "bro?!"

Kotori:
I knew your memories bad, but not all time as that.
Well, I guess I have to admit you to a nursing home pretty soon.

Shido:
So...what's going on?
Where are we?

Kotori:
Quit freaking.
I'll explain this specific to you later, but first, you need to remember the three things I'm about to say.
One: That girl is a Spirit. She doesn't belong in this world, and simply appearing on our planet causes everything around her to blow up whether she wanted to or not.

Shido:
Blow up...why?

Kotori:
You are so damn.
You know those things we call "Spacial Quakes?", or Spirits just like that girls are under the ones who responsible for making them happen.

Shido:
...

[Shido recalled when the Spatial Quake burst in very front of him, and after that, the girl stood at the center of the crater which the burst made]

Shido:
(How could one girl do all that...?)

Kotori:
Ready for two?

[She showed five mech-girls on the screen]

Kotori:
These are the ground force's Anti-Spirits Team.
When the Spirit appears, the AST flied to their location, and take care of it.
Meaning, they kill them.

Shido:
What?! ...Kill them?!

"Princess":
It's true...you came here to kill me, didn't you?

[Shido remembered the "Princess" said]

Kotori:
And, now for Three: There is another way to deal with the Spirits without having rely on AST.
This is the reason why you're here, and why your help would be most needed.

Shido:
Me? Help how?

Kotori:
We have to make sure you start training tomorrow.
I'll leave the rest of the details after the person in charge for development.
In the mean time, just go back to school like normal.

Shido:
Wait, will you slow down?!
Why would you train me?
I mean, seriously, what could I possibly do?

[Kotori stomped her right foot to Kyouhei's left foot hard]

Kyouhei:
Aargh!!

Kotori:
No one was asking your opinion on the matter.
Your only option is "yes."

Shido:
What...

Kotori:
Now I have a question.
What were you doing down there Shido?
Did you want to die?

Shido:
No! Stupid, I was looking for you!
Remember, you said you would be at diner even if there was a quake?

Kotori:
I said that?
But, how was I supposed know you'd follow through?

Shido:
Look Kotori! Besides being dependable, your phone's locate showed me you were there!

Kotori:
You don't say...Oh year, I guess that does make sense.
Although, technically we are above the diner.

Shido:
Huh?

Kotori:
Disable the filter.

[Reiko, stood next Kotori, nodded. Then, the floor disappeared. Shido astonished, but they didn't fall in the air. Apparently, they were still on physically solid floor]

Kotori:
We're currently fifteen thousand meters above Tengu city.
You're on board airship called Fraxinus.

[Shido looked down the city from see through floor, like he flew at 15,000 meters high above]

---

[Unknown space. A girl with purple straight long hair slept in dim light. There's nothing in the space other than girl herself. She quietly opened her eyes, seemed she was thinking, remembering something, someone]

---

[The next day, at the school]

Okamine:
Is everyone enjoying day 2 of the new semester?
Well, I am. Because today, we have a brand new assistant homeroom teacher with us!

Reine:
I'm Reine Murasame.
And, I'm excited to be here...ah...

[As always, unhealthily pale looking Reine got dizzied, fainted away behind the lectern. Everyone in the class upset. Shido had a grave skeptical face]

Shido:
How did you get to be one of my teachers?
Tell me what's going on?

[Three o'clock pm, Shido and Reine were at physics preparation room. And Kotori was also there. In the room, there was dozen monitors hung on the wall. They were all turned on, showing different graph, information on them respectively]

Shido:
Please, Miss Murasame?

Reine:
You can just call me Reine.
'Key Shin?

Shido:
Er...My name is Shido.

Reine:
Is that right? Wow...Sorry, Shin. My bad.

Shido:
You can't be serious!
Come on! You didn't even try getting it to right!

Reine:
It's more convenient from it keep close to you if I remember of the school's teaching stuff.

Kotori:
And, you shouldn't able to figure that much out of you alone.
Try not to be so stupid!

[Kotori pointed her pop candy at Shido]

Shido:
Hey, why don't you tell me why you even here?
Don't you have school?

Kotori:
I got permission to come today.

[Kotori ostentatiously showed her slipper "For visitors" printed on it]

Shido:
...Fine, so you're finally gonna explain to me what this training is for or what?

Kotori:
It'll start to make more sense with you start using the training software.
Hit it, Reine!

Reine:
Nn.

[Reine typed something on the computer. On the screen, some software began loading. After a while, software started, showing the title of it. That read "Fall in love: My little Shido"]

Shido:
Huh? ...This is a dating sim.
Tonomachi was playing with it.

Kotori:
Oh, no, it's not.
Take another look.

Shido:
My...little...Shido?

[At dusk, Shido and Origami stood themselves alone at just inside of the exit to the roof space of the school building]

Origami:
So, Shido...About yesterday...

Shido:
Uh-huh?

Origami:
Please, just keep that yourself.
In fact, it'll be for the best.
If you forgot about everything you saw yesterday...

Shido:
What, it...You mean that girl, right?
Look, Tobiichi. I...I think she might---

Origami:
She's a "Spirit."
That thing is an enemy that I must defeat.

Shido:
...Why?
You really think they're so evil?

[Origami nodded quietly]

Origami:
Spirits killed my parents.
They browned them.
They are very evil...
And, they will pay.

[Usually, Origami never expressed any emotions in front of the other people, but at this moment, she did not hide her emotions toward the Spirits. She squinted her eyes, knitted her eyebrows, expressing her hatred]
