  [Ruined town. Under fine blue sky, two AST members were collapsed on the ground. The other AST member's body was hanged on the wall. Behind it, Origami was facing a girl wearing unfamiliar combat armor. It looked like the one AST members usually wearing, but its coloring was different. The armor's color was composed by white and blue, and Blue-green light emitted here and there. The girl had dark blue colored hair, dark brown eye, slightly smiling as if she provoking her opponent, Origami. Origami turned on her laser sword, produced white electric blade]

Girl:
You still want more?
I can respect that.

[With short nod, she showed her acknowledgement to Origami]

Girl:
Let's go.
Gathering Cloud Sword Style!

Origami:
Now!

[At the time when the girl activated her sword, Origami leaped to the girl, fully boosted her wing. While she was approaching to the girl, Origami detached her wing and use them to attack the girl. The girl slashed down the wings Origami abandoned]

Girl:
Is that all?

[Origami turned herself in the air. Since Origami abandoned her wings, her weight was much lighter now. Her improvement of her agility was more than the girl could predicted, so when Origami turned, thrust her laser sword on her back, the girl couldn't react fast enough to dodge Origami's blade. But, the defensive field surrounding the girl completely blocked the thrust, Origami couldn't give her a damage]

Girl:
Woo! Almost!
Too bad.

[Beep beep beep... The alarm beeped on their transceivers. The practice match was over]

Kusakabe:
Time's up.
Mana Takamiya wins.

[Hearing the declaration of her lost, Origami slightly expressed mortifying on her face. In operation room of the ground forces, Kusanagi mumbled to herself while watching the monitor]

Kusakabe:
How did she win ten against one?
Then again, I probably shouldn't be too surprised...that girl did kill a Spirit.

--- OP ---

Narrator:
Real sister, adopted sister...
Does a single word make all the difference in determining the kind of love one will see?
What is appropriate? And, what is forbidden?
...Who can say?

---

Kusakabe:
Alright, please introduce yourself again.

Mana:
I'm Second Lieutenant, Mana Takamiya.
Please to fight alongside all of you.

[Mana was stood at the front of the briefing room, Kusakabe stood by her side. In the briefing room, all AST members were listening to the Captain silently]

Kusakabe:
Well, we've got that out of way now...

[Kusakabe slapped Mana's head with the clipboard]

Mana:
Ouch!

[First, Mana couldn't understand why the captain slapped her head in front of everyone in the room, she didn't hide protesting look on her face, looked back at the captain's back. But the captain walked into the front of Origami, slapped her head too]

Kusakabe:
Ugh...seriously! What's the big idea destroying valuable equipment on practice match?!

Origami:
Oh, it was my fault, Captain.

Mana:
It won't happen again, Captain.

[Origami and Mana told simultaneously. Mana might feel some kind of bond between she and Origami was formed, she faintly smiled while apologizing to the Captain. Some AST girls murmured rumors at the back line of the seat]

AST member A:
I've heard she's the best fighter the ground forces got...

Kusakabe:
Don't let it happen again, okay?
We're about to go over the fight with the Hermit Spirit.
So, have a seat. And join us.

Mana:
Yes, of course, ma'am.

[Mana sat on the chair next to Origami]

Mana:
The Captain is kind of hard headed, isn't she?
Being stubborn strategically will play right into the Spirit's hand if she's not more careful.

Origami:
I agree.

Mana:
Grad I'm not the only one.

Origami:
Oh, everyone has been talking about is how you've killed the Spirit before.
Would you mind if I ask you how you did it?

Mana:
Whoa, words should travel fast around here?
Well, not two Spirits are alike, so if you want to fight effectively, it's important to remember, you can't do with them all the same way.

Origami:
...Huh.

Mana:
Yeah, with how hectic things then lightly, I think you'll figure out what I mean soon enough.
That's why I've assigned here after all...

[While they talking to each other with smaller voice, the scene when the AST encountered Hermit showed on the screen, the boy stood on the roof space of the building speaking something. Mana noticed she knew the boy's face]

Mana:
...Brother?!

Origami:
...?

---

[Two AST members were walking along on the corridor. One of them had heaved]

AST member B:
We got absolutely destroyed in today's match...

AST member C:
Well, that's the life of backup, I guess.
We might as well to get used to it...

[After them, Mana walked alone silently. Origami approached to Mana]

Origami:
Care to explain yourself?
Shido never mentioned he had another little sister.

Mana:
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you a friend of his?

Origami:
We're not friends.
...We're together.

Mana:
Hmm...?

---

[Morning, the high school where Shido and the others went to]

Okamine:
Good morning everyone!
May I have your attention?
Nn fu fu...are you ready for a surprise?
A transfer student is joining our class today!

[The class was filled with murmuring. Shido thought to himself. He stood his right arm on the desk, and his head rested on the arm]

Shido:
(Didn't Tohka transfer a while ago...?)

Okamine:
Okay! Come on in!

[The transfer student, a girl opened the door, stepped into the class. She did her long, rich black hair knotted down around her shoulder, quietly walk through the front of the room. She wrote her name on the chalkboard]

Kurumi:
Hello guys, my name is Kurumi Tokisaki.

[She flashed her smile to her classmates. Boys in the class room got excited, even some of them stood at their desk]

Boys:
Whooah!

Kurumi:
Just so you know...I'm actually a Spirit.

[First, Shido couldn't understand, but he dropped his head in surprise to the meaning the transfer student just said now]

Shido:
Eh...?!

[The surprise was felt in Tohka, and Origami too. Unable to fully understand, Okamine was wearing worried smile, but continued her own procedure]

Okamine:
Um...let's move on.
...Wow, that's one of the more unique introduction as class as had!
Go ahead and take a seat anywhere?

Kurumi:
Before I sit, could someone do me a quick favor...?

Okamine:
Oh, do you need something?

Kurumi:
Since I'm new, I'm afraid I don't know my way around the school that well...
But, anyone be so kind this to show me around?
I'm really sorry to trouble you, but I promise I'll make it worth you a while...?

[Kurumi said so with her extremely sweet voice. Tonomachi shot up to stand, raised his hand]

Tonomachi:
Yeah! You bet that I'll do it!

Kurumi:
Not you, but thanks.

Tonomachi:
Ow...

[Kurumi walked to Shido's seat. It couldn't see her eyes from Kurumi's left profile, since her uneven bang only showed her right eye]

Kurumi:
Would you be interested in helping me?
...Shido, right?

Shido:
Huh?
Er...y-yeah, okay...?

[While Tonomachi got depressed on his seat, Kurumi smiled at Shido with narrowing her right red eye]

---

[In ground forces' premise, Kusakabe inspected the information on the screen]

Kusakabe:
So, you're completely sure? Without a doubt?

Officer:
I am.

Kusakabe:
Spirit transferred to the high school...
Well, give a credit for being a creative.

Mana:
She's not your typical Spirits.

Kusakabe:
...

[Mana suddenly voiced at the behind of Kusakabe]

Mana:
To start with, she's deadlier than all the others.
Over ten thousand people have died by her hands.
The number's even bigger when you taking into account all the Spatial Quake deaths.

Kusakabe:
Are you kidding me...?

[Mana squinted her eyes. "Nightmare" was the distinguished name that ground forces' AI showed on the monitor to address Kurumi as the Spirit, after finished its analysis]

---

[Returned to the high school, Shido stood in front of the window, looked to the outside of the room]

Kotori:
It's been confirmed on our room too.
I didn't think she turned out to be actual Spirit, but this could definitely work in our favor.
So, I want you to try and work your charm in make her phony love to you before the AST attacks...

[Then, Kurumi called Shido's name from his back]

Kurumi:
Hi, Shido.

[Shido turned back to Kurumi]

Kurumi:
...Are you ready to show me a good time?

Shido:
Um...sure.

[Shido and Kurumi walked out of the room. Origami and Tohka watched Shido's back. In Fraxinus, Kotori and Kyouhei watched the screen that monitoring Shido and Kurumi]

Kurumi:
Which from into get away should we have to first?

Shido:
Urmm...

[The choices appeared on the screen. "1. Roof", "2. Infirmary", "3. Cafeteria/Kiosk"]

Kotori:
Make your choices quick, team!
He's on the spot!

[In the result, more than half Ratatoskr members had chose they should go to the roof]

Kotori:
Hmph, the roof looks awfully popular...
But, which of you want with number 3?

Reine:
That was me...

Kotori:
And, how did you arrive at that answer?

Reine:
Through process elimination.
The school nurses are in their office, and as for the roof, it's a much lovelier view to witnesses at sunset.
Just might to sense.

Kotori:
Who knew you were such a romantic?
Hey Shido? Did get all that?

[Hearing the conversation through the transceiver infixed in his right ear, Shido resumed his talk to Kurumi]

Shido:
Why don't we start with cafeteria and student store?

Kurumi:
Okay.

[Behind them, Tohka and Origami continued spying their conversation]

Tohka:
...What does she think she's trying to pull?

Origami:
No one else is going to get between Shido and me...

---

[Shido and Kurumi was in front of school cafeteria. They were looking at the menu. On it, several items such as "Yakisoba bread", "Melon bread", "Cream bread" and so on were shown. The cafeteria was closed at the time]

Shido:
A lot of people like Yakisoba.
It's cafeteria classic.

Kurumi:
How interesting.

Shido:
I'll give you personal recommendation.
It's this one, the Durian bread.
But you have to brush your teeth after eating it.

Kurumi:
How interesting.

Shido:
Hmm...? Are you even listening?
Eh...Ah?!

[Shido turned to Kurumi, and noticed she was peeking closely him. He got taken aback]

Kurumi:
Nn-fu...

Shido:
Er...Are you okay?

[Kurumi was speaking with her index finger on her lip, smiling bewitchingly]

Kurumi:
Yeah...just zoned out for a second.
It's hard to concentrate with such a handsome man in front of me...

Shido:
Ex...cuse me?

Kotori:
It won't do us any good if you fall for her.

Shido:
Right, sorry...

[Shido whispered to the transceiver. Ratatoskr members on Fraxinus anxiously watching exchanges between Shido and Kurumi]

Reine:
She's different from the ones we faced in the past.

Kotori:
Hopefully Shido can keep his act together to get more info on her for us.
...Hm?

[The choices appeared on the screen. This time, they were "1. What do you mean the word Spirit you said in the morning?", "2. Where the high school did you go before come here?", "3. Kurumi, What kind of panties are you wearing?"]

Kotori:
Right on queue.
The next set of options.

Kyouhei:
I say number 3.

Kotori:
And, why is that?

Kyouhei:
I'm interested in seen her panties. And that's pretty much it.

[Crackle. Kotori snapped her finger. And that was the sign the guards stood by at the room to apprehend Kyouhei and bring him out of the room]

Kyouhei:
No way!
Have mercy! Have mercyyyee!
Like I'm the only one into that sexy thing...!

[As door room shut, his voice tapered off and became silent. Kotori placed her elbow on the desk, to support her chin and heaved a sigh]

Kotori:
...Kurumi, what kind of panties are you wearing...?
How did that pervy choice sneak in there?

[And, then Shido started his action]

Shido:
Hey, question.
Eh...Kurumi, what kind of panties are you wearing?

Kotori:
Ugh...

[Watching him through the monitor, Kotori lost her words for short while. She noticed she accidentally pressed the button on the desk to turn on the microphone]

Kurumi:
Panties...?
Like, right now...?

Kotori:
Numskull! Those weren't instructions, dummy!
You were supposed to ask her about being a Spirit!
Whatever! Just change the subject to something, moron!

Shido:
Ease up! It was an honest mistake!

[Shido whispered back to Kotori]

Kurumi:
...Would you like to take a peek it, then?

Shido:
Huh?!

Kurumi:
Yeah...I don't mind...
As long as it's you...

[Kurumi responded while slightly reddened her cheek]

Kotori:
Yieeh?!

Shido:
Ahh...?!

[Kurumi stepped up several rows of the staircase, then turned back to face Shido. She began to rift the hem of her skirt]

Shido:
Ahh...

[She slowly went up her skirt's edge. But, just about her under garment exposed to him, he raised his right hand, restrained Kurumi's action]

Shido:
Stop!
That's good enough! Thanks!

Kurumi:
Aha...
You're so cute and shy.

Shido:
Come on, then on...
What did you mean, earlier today...you said you were a Spirit?

Kurumi:
Nn-fufu.
You don't have to play dumb with me, silly...?
Besides, I already know that you know all about the Spirits inside and out.

[Somehow, the line Kurumi just said pulled Ratatoskr members attention]

Kotori:
Nn?

Reine:
Hmm...?

Shido:
Eh, but, how did you know so much about me?

Kurumi:
That's my little secret.
...There's only one thing I can tell you about myself.
Ever since I first found about you, I've been crazy in love and hoping you notice me.
I'm so happy that two of us finally alone...It's exactly how I dreamed it would be...

[Kurumi held Shido's left hand with her two hands]

Kurumi:
Hey...are you still listening...?

Shido:
Eh...

Kurumi:
Now that I've got your attention, I need you to do a favor for me...
If you think you can handle it of course...?

Shido:
Ahh...

[Kurumi's alluring smile had trapped Shido. He had been completely mesmerized by Kurumi's attractiveness. He couldn't move, but only stared to Kurumi. Her pink, voluptuous lips glowed sensuously in Shido's eyes. Then,]

Tohka:
Ah!

[A door of the locker stood nearby Shido, suddenly opened. And Tohka and Origami busted out from the inner side of the locker, fell down on the floor]

Shido:
Tohka? Origami?!

Kurumi:
This is awkward.
What exactly are the two of you doing, barging in on us?

Tohka:
I, I was just looking for Shido, that's all!

Origami:
Students not supposed to hold hands at school.
Let go of him, right now.

Shido:
Eh...

[Kurumi didn't release Shido's hand]

Kurumi:
I'm sorry, but I can't.
I have a crippling case of anemia.
Shido was kind enough to offer his body, so that if I faint, I'll simply land in his waiting arms...

[Just after Kurumi declared she had anemia, Origami fainted down to the floor, too. She looked up at Shido]

Origami:
My anemia...

Shido:
Er...

Tohka:
I can't believe how pathetic you two are!
...Ah!

[She noticed something, suddenly then]

Tohka:
O, oh...I think my aneminies kicking in, too!

[Tohka suddenly began rhythmically shaking her hip. Even Shido can't say what the disease she pretentiously claimed at that instance]

Shido:
You're...what?

Tohka:
It makes me sway back and forth and fish will attracted by my cuteness!

Shido:
She said her anemia! Not sea aneminy!

Ai:
Well...looks like a fighting over him...

Mai:
This is intense!
Is he already trying to hook on transfer student?!
It hasn't been a day yet!

Mei:
That's so lame!

[Hearing it Shido lost his words]

---

[Shido, Tohka and Kurumi were at the front gate of the school. The time was almost evening, every white thing now turned into crimson red. Tohka held Shido's arm tight from her intention to secure Shido from Kurumi]

Kurumi:
Thank you so much showing me around school today.
I would've been lost without you.
So thank you.

[Kurumi approached to Shido, closed her face to Shido's ear. She whispered so Shido was the only one who could hear the voice]

Kurumi:
That being sad...Next time, I wanna do it with you, alone...

Shido:
Eh...ha ha...

Kurumi:
Alrighty then, I guess I'll see you two in class tomorrow.

[Kurumi turned back, started walking on her way home. While staring Kurumi's back, Shido was thinking]

Shido:
(Maybe it was a good thing Tohka and Origami were there...Otherwise, who knows what would've happened...?)
Oh, hey, where did Origami go?

[Shido spoke to Tohka]

Tohka:
Huh? Beats me, she probably already went home without us.

---

[Kurumi was skipping on the road, humming. Seemed she was in very good mood]

Kurumi:
Hm~mm, mm~, Shido tasty Shido~ ...oh.
Easy, girl...Don't get exited just yet.
You need little more patients than that.
I'll be sure to save the best for last...

[Then, a man stood on the road bumped to Kurumi]

Kurumi:
Eh!
Oh my gosh. I'm sorry!
I guess, I didn't see you there...

[The man, wearing red T-shirt, ostentatious metal necklace, looked like a sort of gang faced to Kurumi. From the behind of the corner, two other delinquents appeared, surrounded Kurumi]

Delinquent A:
Yeah! What was that for, bitch?!
You gotta do a lot more for me than just say sorry if you wanna go free...?

Delinquent B:
Darn! This one's looking hell o' fine!

Delinquent C:
Give us your name before we get down.
Don't worry, we don't bite that hard...

Kurumi:
Fellows, hold on a sec!
Although...sorry about the bump.
Maybe I can make it up to you with a different kind of bumping...?

[Kurumi said while she touched her under lip with her index and middle finger tips]

Delinquent B:
Hot damn! You really are a slut?!
Awesome!

Delinquent C:
We gonna treat that pretty face really nice...!

Delinquent B:
We are taking turn!
Then I get to go first!

Kurumi:
Come now...There's plenty to go around...?
Follow me and see for yourself how I liked to have fun...if you dare.

[Kurumi walked into the array where three delinquents came from, men followed Kurumi. On the road, the truck approaching on the way Kurumi originally walked]

Delinquent B:
Hee hee hee...while I do, guys, hold on until get party started...!
...Wh-what the hell...?! ...Help! Ugh. Whooahhhgh!

[Splash! The truck ran over a drink can, unopened. splashed can's content on the road. The surrounding environment of color of setting sun made the liquid looks alike much more blood. That might indicate the fate of the three men, in the array, dark stain splashed here and there on the wall, same dark color made pools on the ground. Kurumi stood alone in the shadow of the array]

Kurumi:
Thanks for the snack, boys...

[She licked her lips]

Mana:
Did I arrive too late?

Kurumi:
Well, hello?
You just missed all the fun.

Mana:
...You really ought to learn how to clean up after you eat.

[Mana Takamiya came from nowhere, stood at the entrance of the dark array]

Mana:
Right, Nightmare?

---

[Shido and Tohka got off a bus. They were in the middle of the slope. The sky was still red]

Tohka:
Burgers! Tonight, I'm in the mood for some burgers!

Kotori:
Eww...that's sounds good! Go that!

[Shido moderately laughed. A pair of scallops stuck out from the plastic bag he bringing]

Shido:
Nn~...I guess, we'll have to see...

[Then, they stopped walking. Mana Takamiya stood in front of them]

Mana:
I don't believe it...
It's really you...!
Origami was telling truth after all!

[Shido and Tohka looked at each other, perplexing]

Shido:
Do you know this girl?

Tohka:
No, I don't...

[Mana ran to Shido, looked up him]

Mana:
Hi...

Shido:
Eh?

Kotori:
Who's that?

Mana:
Big brother!

[Mana jumped to hug Shido]

Shido, Tohka:
Huh?!

---

Mana:
This is such a nice place you've got here!
I can't wait to see it!

[Mana was stood at the front of Shido's home. Next scene, She was in his home, shaking hands with Kotori]

Mana:
It's nice to meet you!
I never thought my brother would be living with so many women!
Everyone's so pretty, too!
Thanks for keeping an eye on him.

[Tohka, Yoshino and her puppet sat on the sofa in the living room]

Tohka:
Well, this was unexpected.
How many more sisters do you think Shido's hiding from us?

Yoshinon:
Who knows?! He is true man of mystery!
Juicy, juicy!

Shido:
It's not like I actually knew she even existed...
Wait a minute, what are Yoshino and Yoshinon doing here, too?

Yoshino:
Um...sorry, please forgive us...

Shido:
Oh, no. It's really not a big deal to me.

Yoshinon:
Look at them!
They're so super alike! It's crazy!

Mana:
That's no surprise!
We are related, after all.

Kotori:
Yeah, it's funny you mentioned that.
I've been his little sister for as long as I can remember.

Mana:
Eh, wow, what a coincidence!
Does that make you my big sister?

Kotori:
No! Of course not!
We were both still little kids when my family adopted Shido.
So, we're as close to siblings as we can be.

Mana:
You mean, accept for actually being siblings.

[The tense between Mana and Kotori gradually grew, knowing or not, Shido interrupted their conversation]

Shido:
Hey...Mana? Little sis, I've gotta question for you.

Mana:
Oh? Go ahead and ask away then.

Kotori:
Humph!

[Kotori harrumphed, then sucked her tea in the glass cup with straw]

Shido:
Well, er...It's just, the...mm.
No offense, but, er, I don't remember you...

Mana:
That isn't surprise me.
It's weird, the past is such a blank that sometimes my memory's been erased!

Shido, Kotori:
Huh?!

Kotori:
You've got me kidding me?!
What the heck do you mean your memory's been erased?!

[Mana spoke with her right hand scratching her head]

Mana:
I remember the past two or three years okay, but any thing before that is completely blur...

Shido:
Crazy...so you don't remember mom either?

Mana:
No. No, I'm afraid I don't.

Kotori:
Then, how do you know for sure that you and Shido actually related to each other?

[Mana drew a locket from her chest pocket, opened to show the picture. The monochrome picture rendered two children, a boy and a girl both got muddy smiled to the camera]

Shido:
Is that...me?

Kotori:
A lot of little boys look alike.

Mana:
No. This is definitely Shido.
Like I said, my memory's pretty fuzzy...But I do remember my older brother going off somewhere.
I was so devastated, but more than that, I spent every day worrying about him.
That's why I'm so happy!
And now, you sitting in front of me!
I can't explain! I'm ecstatic!

Shido:
(Mana...?)

Mana:
I love you, brother!

[Mana held tight Shido. Irritatingly watching Kotori kicked away Shido, tried to separate he and Mana]

Kotori:
Get away from Mana[?]!

Shido:
Guh!

Tohka:
Ah...!

Kotori:
What do you think you are doing?!

Shido:
What the hell is that for?!

Kotori:
Shido is my family!
I'm not going to let you or anyone else take him away from me!

Mana:
I wasn't planning on doing that!

Kotori:
...You weren't...?

Mana:
I just haven't got to see him in such a long time.
I'm relieved he's doing well...
And, even now, he's still got a cute little sister looking after him.

Kotori:
Oh, thank you...you should've opened your mouth before I kicked him.

Mana:
Besides, at the end of the day, there's no beating the real sister.

Kotori:
Funny...You are joking, right?

Mana:
Nope, I'm only stating facts.
There's no bond stronger than blood, I know of.

Kotori:
I think you mean better than neighbor who's near than sister faraway...

Mana:
Hmm...No, no. An adopted sister is practically a stranger.
A real sister will always be closer because she shares the same blood.

Kotori:
What's the point of emphasizing the blood part?!

[A quarrel continued between Kotori and Mana. Spectating Tohka questioned to Yoshino]

Tohka:
Adopted, a real...what are this all mean?

Yoshino:
Do you have any idea?

Yoshinon:
Wake up you two!
Everyone knows that sister can drive a man wild like a forbidden fruits, sweet with just a right amount of tangy!

Tohka:
Really? Then, sisters drive me wild too!
I want some forbidden fruits!

Shido:
Quit putting ideas in Tohka's head!

[Kotori and Mana still continued their argument]

Kotori:
Just how much is your blood word?!
Big woop! It's not like a real sister could marry him!

[Everyone astonished hearing the words that Kotori said]

Everyone:
Huh?!

[Kotori blushed her cheeks]

Kotori:
Ew, er...
Um...Never mind!
Point's his only sister is me!

Mana:
I don't think you make a very good one.
You're not as strong as his real little sister.

Kotori:
That has nothing to do with being a sister! You jerk face!

Shido:
Hey, girls...let's try to stay calm...

Kotori:
Shido, which do you like more?!

Mana:
An actual blood sister? Or, stupid adopted sister?!

Shido:
Whoa! I'll pass!
Yeah, I mean, talk about awkward, right?
Um...do you live by yourself nowadays?

Mana:
Eh...?

Shido:
If...the someone our there's taking care of you, then I ought at least to meet them, and tell them thanks!

Mana:
That's not a good idea...

Kotori:
How come? Is there something wrong with your living or what?

Mana:
I wouldn't say that.
See, the thing is, it's kind of a special dorm for people I sort of work with...

Shido:
Wait, work with?
Hold on! You already have a job?!

Mana:
Oh, um...I can't really explain at all that well...

[With a little deceiving laugh, Mana quickly walked to the door of the room, and retreated from Shido's house]

Mana:
See you guys later!

Shido:
Eh...what was that all about?!

Kotori:
Uh...

---

[School. The morning next day]

Okamine:
And, Shimada?

Student A:
Here.

Okamine:
And, Suzuki?

Student B:
Here.

Okamine:
And, Tokisaki?
...Is Tokisaki here?
Tokisaki?

Shido:
She's gone...?

Tohka:
Wow...I can't believe it.
Just a second day, and she's already late.

Origami:
She's not here.
Kurumi Tokisaki will no longer be attending to school.

Okamine:
I told her to contact us in case something just ever came up.
Kids these days...

[Then, someone opened the back door of the classroom]

Kurumi:
I'm here.

Okamine:
Huh?
...Miss Tokisaki, you're very late.

Kurumi:
Yes. Sorry about that teach.
I felt a little queasy on my way here, so I decided to take a quick nap.

Okamine:
Er...oh, do you feel better now?

[Shido mumbled at his seat]

Shido:
That's good.
Another minute, then she'd have marked absent.
Er...You okay, Origami?

[Shido's cell phone vibrated in the desk, it was an e-mail from Kotori. It said...]

Kotori:
Come to the physics preparation room during lunch.
There's something I want to show you.

[At the lunch break, Shido was in the physics preparation room. There were also Kotori and Reine sat on the chairs. The room was dark, all they are watching the monitor]

Shido:
So, what's up?
Why did you call me in?

[Reine operated the system, then a game titled "Fall in love: My little Shido 2" showed up on the monitor]

Shido:
There's a sequel?!

Reine:
Oops, sorry about that. Wrong window.

[Reine changed the window in the monitor, it's a video record. The camera flew in the air captured the scene Mana facing to Kurumi]

Reine:
This is a footage from yesterday.

Shido:
Who's that?
Kurumi...and Mana?
...Origami and the AST?!
Why?!

Kotori:
They wouldn't show up unless there was a Spirit around.

[Mana changed her wear into the combat suit, and Kurumi also changed her cloths into Gothic Lolita style dress]

Shido:
No way...

[Kurumi raised her hand, looked like she was about attacking Mana. But, Mana blasted an array of five laser beams, went through Kurumi's body]

Shido:
...

[Kurumi tried to stand after she fell on the ground, but then another shot pierced her again. Her blood splattered to the wall. Kurumi stopped her motion. Mana walked to Kurumi's side, she turned on her light saber and pointed its tip on Kurumi's neck. She raised her saber, then...Reine stopped the movie]

Shido:
What is this?!

Reine:
The facts.
Yesterday, Kurumi Tokisaki was killed by the AST.
And, Mana was the one who took her out.
So, you can see the video doesn't lie.
Kurumi Tokisaki should be dead.

Shido:
But, how?
No...it can't be. Kurumi came to class.
She's alive!

Kotori:
I know.
Kind of weird, don't you think?

Reine:
Yes, I do.
I don't have explanation.

[Kurumi and Origami was stood at the hall, in front of the door to the roof space. The small hall had light which came from the door window, but fairly dark so the green light of emergency exit sign felt bright enough. And, the half of Kurumi's body was hid in the darkness]

Kurumi:
Hello Origami.
You want to see me about something?
Oh, but first...I haven't eaten lunch.
Would you like to grab a bite with me?

Origami:
You were supposed have died yesterday...

Kurumi:
I was...?
Oh, yeah...Yeah, I remember.
You are fretting around with Mana when she murdered me, isn't that right?

[Origami sucked an air, and leaped backward]

Origami:
...Oh?!

[White Hands grew out from the dark floor grabbed Origami's legs, her body. Those hands fixed her on the wall]

Origami:
Argh!

Kurumi:
Uh-fu-fu...!
What a temper on you?
Try to calm yourself down...
You took real good care of me yesterday...cleaned up if nothing happened.
Well, guess what...?
I'm, not, dead.

[One of the hand squeezed Origami's neck, made her suffocating]

Origami:
Ugh...what is this...!
What are you going to do to me!

[Kurumi combed up her front hair, exposed her left eye. Her left eye was a clock, black Greek letter numbers on the gold face. Maybe it was a fake eye, or perhaps it's a kind of the color contact lens]

Kurumi:
Oh, you'll see...
You could say I wanted to try out school.
And, even I admitted has been a funny experience.
But now...That's not why I'm here.
I'm here for the same reason you are.
It's for Shido. I think you know him, you crave him too, after all...
But unfortunately for you, he means much more to me.
...So much more...
So, if you know what's for good for you...
Get out of my way, and never talk to Shido again...?
He is absolutely delight...And he makes me feel amazing...
He also looks delicious...
I yarn for little Shido...!

[Kurumi licked her lips. That made her looked herself very evil]

Kurumi:
Ahh...I long for that boy...!
I want him so badly...!
I want his entire body for myself...!
I want all the power he has inside...!
And, I know we're little take in order to have him...
Before you know it...Shido is going to be mine...!
Hee...ha ha ha....fu-fu-fu...

[Those white hands grew out from the floor one after another. Kurumi's excitement affected them, now they've been glowed into red, wiggled in the air as if they craved something]
