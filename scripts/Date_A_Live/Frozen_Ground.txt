  [A downpour continued outside of Shido's house. Shido knocked the door of Tohka's room]

Shido:
Hey! Tohka! Will you let me in?
Please, just hear me out!

[Kaboom! The sound like something exploded, or something very heavy fell, burst out from the room]

Tohka:
Why don't you go such a little girlfriend?!
I have nothing more to say about you dummy! Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!

[Tohka shut in her room, sat still on her bed, hugging a cushion she and Shido got the video arcade the other day]

---

[The shrine. Hermit stood silently at bottom of stone staircase which lead to the main building. Her bare left hand was exposed to the rain, water drops fell from her finger tips]

--- OP ---

Narration:
Rain...it's just like a girl.
Sometimes, kind. Sometimes, fickle.
Fallen down heavenly. Or, not fallen at all.
It is the source of all life.
And, tonight, the rain...is a little cold.

---

[Reine and Tohka were in the restaurant]

Reine:
I'll get right to the point, Tohka.
You've been really irritated lately.
Please, just tell me what's going on?
Though, if I had to take a while, I guess, I'd say this is about Shido and that girl?

Tohka:
No. No, you're wrong.
This is nothing to do with him!

Reine:
Oh, I just assume he was the cause of it.

Tohka:
Awww...!

[Tohka tore her hair. Eventually, she resigned to keep her pretense of indifference on Shido]

Tohka:
I don't know what's wrong...
I'm in the worst mood ever, and I'm not even sure I know why...

---

[Shido walked in the street, hanging a plastic bag of convenience store's, so he might on the way for some errand. He turned right on the corner, and saw Hermit sat on the ground, searching something in the rain]

Shido:
Er...Yohinon?

[When Hermit noticed she was called by someone, recognized it was Shido, she started running away from him]

Shido:
Wait! Hold on a second!
Don't run away!
...Oh, hey, what happened to your puppet?!

[Then, Hermit turned back to him, grabbed his cloths]

Shido:
Oh, I see. That's what you looking for?

[She nodded]

---

Tohka:
Shido can do whatever he wants.
It's really not of my business who he dates or kisses, or spends his free time with...
But, when I saw that, it just...I thought awful all of a sudden.
Then what I heard the rabbit say, Shido cared more about that other girl than me.
It was like, I was empty inside...like, I was all alone.
Sad, that's what I made me feel more than anything else.
Scared, too...
I'm really worried there might be something wrong with me.

[Reine silently heard what Tohka spoke]

---

Shido:
Gotya.
So, you lost it while you were fighting the AST yesterday?
Kotori, do you copy that?

[Through the earphone type transceiver, Shido communicated with Kotori who sat on the chair in Fraxinus bridge]

Kotori:
Yeah, we're analyzing the video now.
You take a lead on searching, we're supporting as much as we can.
Or, we're gonna take a back sheet on this one.
It'll be better for her attention is on you.

[Tap, tap. It would be a sign to respond to them, Shido tapped the earphone two times]

Shido:
Yohinon. We're ready to start wherever you are.

Hermit:
...See, the thing is...My name is...It's not Yohinon...
It's Yoshino...And, Yoshinon is the puppet we're looking for...and my...friend.

Shido:
Yo-shi-no...I gotya.

[Yoshino, or Hermit, started to leave from the site to find her friend. But Shido stooped her]

Shido:
Er, wait a sec.
Please, take it. You could catch a bad cold in a rain storm like this.

[Shido handed his umbrella to her. Yoshino was stupefied, looked up Shido]

Shido:
Oh, don't worry. I'll be alright.
Really, I want you to have it.

[Yoshino, switched looking at Shido and the umbrella, bowed him to express her gratitude]

Yoshino:
Um...That's very kind of you...

Shido:
Sure.

[Shido smiled back to her thanks]

---

Reine:
There's absolutely nothing wrong with you.
But, listen. I think we should definitely clear few things up.

Tohka:
Like what?

Reine:
Well, you should know that kiss was an accident. Completely.
And, it's not remotely true that Shido cares more about the other girl than any does about you.

Tohka:
Yes, but...Shido was...

Reine:
Just think about it, he risked his life to save you.
Do you seriously believe he would've put himself in danger like that if he didn't care one bit?

["Watch out!" Tohka recalled Shido's yelling, to save her from the rain of the icicle knives the other day]

Tohka:
...

---

[Yoshino and Shido were pushing aside the concrete blocks of the demolished building. While they were searching around, Yoshino's belly grumbled]

Yoshino:
Ack...

Shido:
Hmm? Yoshino, are you hungry?

[She shook her head to deny, but the grumbling sound continuously went on. She reddened her entire face. Yoshino hid her face to her unusually big hood]

Kotori:
Why don't you two take a break and get something to eat?
Might give you a chance to ask her some questions.

[Observing them from the bridge of Fraxinus, Kotori gave her advice to Shido through the transceiver]

Shido:
Yeah, good call.
...By that looks like the fighting cause restaurants out of commission, let's go to my house.
We can eat there.

Yoshino:
...

---

[Shido and Yoshino were in Shido's house. Shido broke an egg, preparing a meal]

Shido:
You sure love that puppet, don'tya?
Most people would just give up, and go buy a new one.
She must be really important to you, huh?

Yoshino:
Huh...She is. Yoshinon's my friend.
My best friend.
And, she's my hero, too...

Shido:
Your hero?

Yoshino:
Oh, yes!
She...Yoshinon is the greatest.
She's who I want to be...She's just so brave.
So strong...She's not pathetic like I am...
If I can be more like her, i would be so happy...
But, I'm not...And, I'll never be.

Shido:
...Well, I don't know all about that.
As matter of fact, I like you just the way you are.

Yoshino:
...

[Yoshino reddened her cheek, hid her face with her hood again]

Shido:
Hey, something wrong?

Yoshino:
Oh, well...no one's ever said that before...
Thank you. It's nice.

[In Fraxinus, Kotori wore a difficult smile, murmuring]

Kotori:
Did you rehearse that line? Or, did it just come to you...?

Shinzaki:
Commander, here's the analysis of the puppet in the videos.

[Shido's house]

Shido:
Yoshino, why don't you ever trying to fight back in AST attacks you.
There's gotta be a reason for it?

Yoshino:
Yes, there is...
The thing is, I don't like pain...or being scared.
I can't stand it.
But, everyone hates those things, though...How could they not?
Any creature that feels has to despise them...don't you think so?

Shido:
Yeah, maybe...one would help.

Yoshino:
Then again, I just a big scary cat...
When I'm scared, freeze up, I can't think, and move, or speak...I'm so afraid.
It's like I can't do anything at all.
Except stand there, hoping someone will save me.
It's awful. If I wasn't such a coward, I maybe able to fight back.
But, I am...always have been...The truth is I was nothing like Yoshinon.
When I'm in danger, she's right there by my side...always.
She gives me a courage I don't have on my own.
She's strong...brave, and fearless.
She's my hero.
So, you see? That's it. That's why I won't bite.

[Shido rubbed her head through the hood]

Yoshino:
Ah?!
Why are you petting me?

Shido:
Come on. I'm here to protect you.

Yoshino:
...

Shido:
And, I'll make sure we find Yoshinon.
But, you don't have to rely on her to protect you anymore.
'Cause, I'm gonna be your hero now.
(That's right. It doesn't matter if she's a Spirit. A girl as kind as she is deserves nothing less)

Yoshino:
Ah...Thanks so much for your kindness...

Shido:
Sure.
Uh...So, look, I'm sorry about what happened.
...Kissing you out of the blue, and everything.

Yoshino:
Kissing...?

Shido:
Yeah, you know...A kiss is, when you...get really close, touch each others lips...
Just like this...

[Shido closed his face to Yoshino's, he closed his eyes, practicing the act of kissing]

Tohka:
Shido! I'm so sorry! That a...

[Of course, Tohka barged into the room at that moment. And what Tohka witnessed was that Shido and That little girl looks just about kissing each other. The air was frozen]

Shido:
Geh...Um, er...

[Shido sweated as he saw Tohka stood there. Yoshino hastily stood up, vanished herself to nowhere, disappeared]

Shido:
Arh?!

Tohka:
Um...Nn!

[Tohka burst out from the room, slapped the door shut. Remained Shido couldn't do anything to follow them]

Kotori:
Shido, sorry to bother you to time like this, but we figured out where Yoshinon is.

Shido:
Great. Awesome work.
Tell me where?

Kotori:
Actually...that's kind of awkward part...

Shido.
Umm...

[Shido knitted his blows, looked he is having a trouble]

---

Tohka:
Ugh! ...Ah!

[Tohka punched the cushion again and again, and sadly sat on the bed]

Tohka:
There's that feeling again. It's awful...I just wanted to go away.

[Tohka held her knees, buried her head into her arms. She began sobbing]

---

[A Chime rang at the front of the entrance of apartment building]

Origami:
Who's there?

Shido:
It's Shido. Can I come---

[At the instant he responded to Origami, the entrance door opened. The response was unusually quick. Shido heaved a short sigh, then entered the building. While the elevator brought him to the floor where Origami lived, Shido contacted to Kotori through the transceiver inlaid in his right ear]

Shido:
This is crazy...Are you positive I'm in the right place?

Kotori:
According to the analysis, there's no question.
We're able to confirm the other shadow without doubt that Origami took Yoshinon from the scene.

Shido:
It doesn't maybe feel any better about having the act like a thief...

Kotori:
It's too late to back out now. We'll do our best to score you now. Wh...wil yo---

[Suddenly, the noise jammed into the communication between Shido and Kotori]

Shido:
Hello? Are you there?

[The noise made unable to communicate to Kotori. Besides, he noticed he was standing at the very front of Origami Tobiichi's house. After he took deep breath, Shido pushed a doorbell. But, unexpectedly again, the door shot open at the same time he push the button. He stepped back in surprise, and Origami stood at the entrance of the home. She wore made outfit, with unnecessary short length frilled skirt]

Shido:
Er...Hi there, Tobiichi.

Origami:
Hello.

[Origami responded to Shido with no expression]

---

Shido:
Thanks for let me in, come over...I know it's really a sudden now and all...I appreciate it...

[Sitting before the table, Shido seemed somehow stiff]

Origami:
You're very welcome.

[Origami poured a something tea from the typical shape Japanese green teapot. But tea has color of purple, raised blue-purple-ish steam]

Origami:
Here, you go.

Shido:
Oh...Thank you.
...Wait! Tobiichi! What is this?!

Origami:
Just drink it.

Shido:
Come on! You gotta be kidding me!

Origami:
Drink it.

Shido:
...Of course, I would love to.
...Argh!! Dah!!!

[With one sip, Shido knocked out to the floor. And, in no time, Origami mounted on Shido]

Shido:
Hey, what in the heck do you think you doing?!

[Origami rubbed her butt to Shido]

Origami:
Do you like that?

Shido:
...Well, er, I would say no...not really.

[Shido averted his eyes from Origami]

Origami:
I'll get off you if you agree to grant me one request.
No "if"s, and/or "but"s.
Do we have a deal, or not?

Shido:
Depends on what it is...?

Origami:
I'm completely over you calling me by my last name.
You got that?
I hear you call everybody else by their fist names.
But, I'm just still Tobiichi to you.

Shido:
Huh?

Origami:
My name's Origami.
That is what I preferred to be called.
...Deal?

[Origami tilted her head]

Shido:
That seems like a reasonable proposition, and settled it done.

[Origami had placed her hands on Shido's chest, now placed on the floor. Meant she was closer to Shido]

Shido:
Yeah...Origami?

[Origami stood up, freed Shido]

Origami:
We good?

Shido:
Er...Totally, sure.

[Origami jumped, leaped to the door]

Shido:
Wait...where are you going.

Origami:
The shower.

Shido:
...Seems like a weird time to that?

[Shido soliloquized. Origami left from the room]

Shido:
Oh, I forgot! The puppet!

[While Origami taking a shower, Shido was searching for the puppet in entire house. While searching, Shido found empty bottles labeled "Energy MAX", "Black Viper." They were looked very strong nourishing tonics, seemed they were the actual contents of the drink Shido had drunk. Origami scrupulously washed her up. Shido continued searching, he found a pillow that have the words "No problem" printed on it. He turned the pillow, then he could see the words "As you please" printed on the back. He realized that Origami was fully prepared to have it with him]

Shido:
Oh...No use! I can't find it!
Damn it! These not so sudden pillow messages are freaking me out!
Ugh...?

[Then, he finally found the puppet sitting on the dresser. When Origami was out from the shower, he was sat back in the living room]

Shido:
Oh, well. That was pretty fast...Ah?!

[Shido got shocked by looking at Origami. She was wearing nothing but putting only the bath towel around her torso]

Origami:
What's wrong?

Shido:
Eh...! ...Nothing is wrong...why?

[Origami closed the distance between her and Shido. Shido instinctively moved his body away]

Origami:
Are you okay?

Shido:
Dude...how can you ask me that...?

[Origami close the distance again]

---

Kotori:
We still haven't been able to re-establish the connection?!

Kyohei:
No, not yet. Some sort of powerful jamming signal there.
And it's far stronger than signal of AST.

Kotori:
Origami...what is her deal?!

[Kotori grumbled in Fraxinus]

---

Origami:
There is something I want to ask you.
During when I'm in missions, I would sure you would've been...

[Origami was recollecting her memory when she shot Shido with her rifle, made a large hole on Shido's abdomen]

Origami:
I wanna know what you are.

Shido:
Look...Have you ever talked to a Spirit before?

Origami:
What are you trying to say.

Shido:
I'm saying I've talked to them.
And not just Tohka either. I've talked to Yoshino.
She's a Spirit they call her Hermit.

Origami:
That's too dangerous.
You shouldn't do that.

Shido:
It's really not.
You should give it a try.
I think you'll be surprised.
Look, you'll right, there are probably a ton of bad Spirit out there, but not all bad.
I know this might sound a little bit nuts, but she gotta believe me is true.
Tohka and Yoshino were good Spirits.
I have to help Yoshino.
And, no matter what, I'll never deny Tohka.
You asked something to me, then I'm gonna demand something of you.
Promise me something...promise you stop hurting good people.
You're a good person too, and they're not different than you are.
So, tell me, why the hell did it have to turned out this way?

Origami:
Look, I don't know.
But it just can't be helped.
Even if you are right about them, and even that Hermit isn't looking for a fight, there's still the problem with Spatial Quakes.

[Then, Origami's cellphone rang]

Origami:
It's them!
We are being deployed.

Shido:
Origami! Let me ask you one more thing, if Hermit's Spirit's powers gave out like Tohka's did, you stop attacking, won't you?
What would be a right thing to do.

Origami:
It isn't about being right or wrong, good or bad.
It's about following my orders.
Regardless of whatever I might want to do.

Shido:
Alright, Origami.
Good bye, I'll see you soon.

[Origami opened the door, left from the room]

---

Yoshino:
Aww...

[Yoshino was flying high speed above Tengu city, to dodge bullets fired by AST squad. She lowered altitude trying to make it difficult to aim to her. But, Kusakabe, Captain of AST squad, waited silently aiming to Yoshino, fired her machine gun, shot down the Spirit. Yoshino protected herself by activating defensive shield, but couldn't help to fall the ground]

Kusakabe:
Yes! We've got her right where we want!

[After she waited for the dust smoke made by previous shot was cleared, confirmed that the Spirit wasn't move, Kusakabe pulled the trigger of her machine gun again. Yoshino slapped the ground with her right hand, summoned her Angel]

Yoshino:
Zadkiel!

[From the spot where Yoshino touched on the ground, white fog bust out]

Kusakabe:
Did we get her?!

Origami:
...!

[Origami recognized the huge white monster, with a pair of long ears, red glowing eyes was emerged from the fog. It's height surpassed seven story buildings which surrounded it]

Kusakabe:
Whoa...what is it?!

Origami:
It's Angel...

Zadkiel:
Grooow...

[The monster, Zadkiel, which carried Yoshino and connected with her left arm, breathed out cold air. The air froze buildings, trees around it. Two AST members other than Kusakabe and Origami, fired their weapon to the monster. And the monster slowly fight back to them with its chilling beam. AST members were blocked themselves with protecting field, but the beam froze them over the protection field, made them round rocks of ice. They fell to the ground]

Kusakabe:
This can't be a real!

[The monster began running away from the scene]

Kusakabe:
Move. Let's go!

[Yoshino was carried by the monster, running through the town. Short after the monster passed through the shrine she used to play, she heard Shido was calling her name]

Shido:
Yoshino!
It's me! I'm here!

[Yoshino had located him standing on the roof space of the building]

Yoshino:
He...he came.

[The monster stopped running]

Shido:
Yoshino! I came here to give you something!

[Then, behind from Shido, an yellow laser beam was shot, hit the monster. The shot was from Origami]

Shido:
Eh...

Kusakabe:
What do you think you are doing!
It's not safe over there!

[Kusakabe, float in the air with her back booster, warned Shido. The monster lost it's control, Yoshino couldn't handle it]

Zadkiel:
Groooah...

Yoshino:
No! No!

[The monster began activating its weapon breath, the beam blast that froze out two AST members before. Tohka, running around in the town, spotted the monster and Shido stood on the roof where the monster aiming at]

Tohka:
Shido!
Oh no! This is not good!

[Tohka stomped the ground, trying to summon her Angel]

Tohka:
Sandalphon! ...Sandalphon! Sandalphon!
Ugh...! Come on! Please! Sandalphon!

[But, her stomp was unusually weak, compared to she used to be, just the strength with ordinary girl should make, didn't summon anything. She continued stomping, but the monster blasted out its deadly chilling breath]

Tohka:
Aaaaaaah!

[Sandalphon was appeared, right front of the Shido. It blocked the breath and protected Shido]

Shido:
Oh man...Sandalphon!

[After blasting the breath, Zadkiel start to run away again, and AST squad also began chasing it. Before to leave from him, Origami glanced to Shido for a short while. Perhaps, she could recognize the special artifact, which belonged to the Spirit, standing in front of him]

Tohka:
Are you okay?!

[Tohka descended to Shido, she had flew with her regained Spirit power. Now she wore partially transformed wear which she called it Adonai Melek]

Shido:
Tohka...? You saved me.

Tohka:
Oh, Shido...I owe you an apology for lots of things.
I bet matter you about some stuff I didn't really know about...
I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.

Shido:
Thank you. But, I'm the one who should apologize.
Tohka, I need your power.
To save Yoshino!

[Tohka bit her lip, because those words were the last thing she wanted to hear from Shido at the time]

Tohka:
Er...Yoshino...She's the girl you've kissed...
You see, she is more important to you than I am...
I understand...

Shido:
No!
That's not how is it all!
Yoshino, she's...she's a Spirit, just like you!
I made a promise that I'll do everything I could to protect her.
But, I can't do it on my own!
I'm begging you!
Please...lend me your power!

[Tohka spaced out for a short while, evaluating the motivation sat inner Shido's mind]

Tohka:
(...His heart is so...good.
How can I turn my back on him...The man who saved me...
I have to do the right thing)

[Tohka walked through Shido, approaching to Sandalphon]

Shido:
Tohka...?

[She kicked, fell down Sandalphon to lay it on the ground]

Tohka:
Get on.
There's not much time.

---

[While Tohka and Shido talking on the roof, AST member were continuously assaulted Yoshino and the monster. They caught the monster in the net, and Origami tried to slash down the master of the monster, but the monster tore up the net and blasted out its deadly cold breath. The breath caught Origami's left arm, froze the weapon she had. She immediately threw it the frozen weapon. Now, the monster and the Spirit was enveloped the snow storm which made by the monster]

Kusakabe:
Urm...this is definitely not a good sign.
It looks like the blizzard just taking the magical power from our realizer and it using its strength on its defenses...

AST member:
And there's no way we can lower the territory and go in there.
We won't be able to withstand the ice bullets...They'll rips us all shreds.

Kusakabe:
Besides, if we only use physical attacks, we won't be able to do anything about the Spirit.
...Origami?

[Origami turned to nearby building, leveled her arms, and concentrated some energy on her, then freed those energy. The green energy lifted the building]

Kusakabe:
Wait...what is this?!
What are you doing?!

Origami:
I'll use sheer force.
Attack at the exact moment the barrier falls!

[Origami flew to right above Yoshino, she threw the building to Yoshino. But, exact moment the building fell on to Yoshino, it cut up by purple slash waves, and on of them also attacked Origami]

Origami:
Eh...!

[Tohka landed to the roof top on one of the building. She held the broad sword in her right hand]

Tohka:
Humph!
Excellent dodge.

Origami:
Tohka Yatogami...!

[Origami activated her light saver, leaped to slash Tohka. Tohka parried Origami's sword, and they both jumped, flew to the air]

Tohka:
Why wouldn't you just gave up while you still can?

[Tohka provoked Origami. Origami prepared to carry out next attack]

Origami:
Hmm...

Kusakabe:
Troops! Switch your target to Princess!

[All AST squad off from the ground, began to chase Princess. Tohka lead them away from Yoshino, and she smirked]

Tohka:
...Hmph.

[While Tohka attracted AST squads, Shido, flew in the sky by riding on Sandalphon, landed to nearby the rounded blizzard made by Yoshino. He removed the puppet from the bag, and put it into his jacket. He started to walk into the blizzard]

Kotori:
Shido, Hold on!
Please, don't go in there on your own!
There's no protection, this is too much!
Even with your regeneration abilities!

Shido:
Wait a sec...Am I going crazy?
Or, do I detected the hint of concerning of your voice?

[Shido replied to Kotori while wearing a cynical smile on his face]

Kotori:
This is no time to joke around, Shido!
Last time, a single bullet hit you!
Trust me, this's gonna be a completely different story!
It'll be like trying to dodge machine gun fire!
If your Spirit powers detected, you won't able to be healed!

[While Kotori appealed desperately to Shido not to go into the blizzard, Shido noticed a hint of the power which saved him the shootings the other day]

Shido:
Spirit power...oh, wow.
So, my regeneration ability...it's a Spirit power then?

[Kotori clucked her tongue. Seemed that was a one of the facts which she'd never wanted Shido to know of. But, right now, her top priority was to stop Shido to enter the storm]

Kotori:
Shido! Don't do this, please!
Don't go in there, big bro!

---

[Inside the storm, Zadkiel sat still in the center of the space. The innermost space of the storm was calm. Yoshino sat on the monster, cried for her loneliness.]

Yoshino:
Hic...Yoshinon...

???:
Have no fear!
Yoshinon's here!

[From the dark wall surrounding Yoshino, the puppet poked out its face to speak to Yoshino]

Yoshino:
Eh...? Ah!

[After the puppet, Shido staggered to walk into the space, he fell down when he finally reached to Yoshino. She got off from Zadkiel's back, rushed to Shido]

Yoshino:
It's...it's really you, Shido...?

Shido:
In the flesh...ugh...

[His regenerating power continuously patch him up, but he still damaged, only he could do was turned himself back on the ground. Now his face was up to face Yoshino]

Shido:
I made it...Just on the nick of time.
...Here's your puppet.
See? I told ya I'll find it.

[Yoshino burst out crying. Surprised Shido sat up]

Shido:
No! What's wrong?
Hey, please don't cry!
Everything's gonna be alright!

Yoshino:
Thank you...you just so...nice...
Hic...thanks for saving her...
She...she's my best friend...
This means so much to me...

[Shido handed the puppet to Yoshino]

Shido:
Glad to do it.
But, now, it's your turn to be saved.

Yoshino:
Huh...?

Shido:
But, first, er...you see, the thing is, in order to save you...there's something we have to do...
We...have to kiss first. So...

[Yoshino bent her head, like as she felt shy, or she contemplating something]

Shido:
Oh, ah...well, not really. I was just kidding around!
We don't actually have to do that if you don't w---

[While Shido trying lough off the idea that he offered, Yoshino closed her face to Shido, kissed him]

Yoshino:
...Was that okay with you?

Shido:
Y-yeah, yeah...It was awesome.

Yoshino:
Sure was...I'm glad.
Because you think it's awesome, it's awesome to me, too...

[Then, her cloths of the Spirit, Astral Dress, disappeared just like Tohka's]

Yoshino:
Oh...what's happening...?
Oh, Shido...?
...Eh?

[Sequentially, the storm surrounded them was cleared. The blue sky appeared above them. A large, vivid rainbow arched in the sky]

Yoshino:
Beautiful...

--- ED ---

Shido:
Hey...what the heck is this?

[Shido stood in front of the building, a five-story condominium, which stood next to his house]

Kotori:
I've told you we'd make a special housing unit for Spirits?
Tohka will move out today and will live here.
If you listen to me, you'd already know that.
And, not just Tohka, either...

[A girl with blue wavy hair, wearing white one piece and big hat, ran to Kotori and Shido]

Shido:
Er, Hi, Yoshino.

Yoshino:
Hi...
From now on...I'll be by your side.

Shido:
Right. The same goes for me.

[Yoshino flashed her innocent smile. They looked up the building, her new home. And, Yoshinon barged into the screen]

Yoshinon:
Uah, Ah!
This isn't the end! And, just beginning, folks!
To be continued! Ha ha ha~ha ha!
