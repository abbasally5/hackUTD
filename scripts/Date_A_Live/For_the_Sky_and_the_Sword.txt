  [Tohka, her outfit was now a school uniform which is the same of Shido's high school's, pushed her palms and face against the pane glass of the "Sweet Bakery"'s window. The shop stood in the town where Shido lived, had a sign board on the right of its entrance. "Right out of oven!" read on the board]

Tohka:
Shido! What's in here?!
Is it a date?!
Tell me!

[Tohka's strong interest to deep-fried breads, displayed on the window, made white fog of her breathe on the window]

--- OP ---

Narration:
A prompt Tohka's arrival in a strange new world, she has immediately faced with a challenge.
She could choose to fight against the appetite for growing curiosity, or feed her generosity with love.
And, today, Shido's wallet is also feeling conflicted...

---

Shop clerk:
Thank you. Please, come again.

[Shido got out from the bakery. He held a paper bag. He offered a content, a deep-fried bread, to Tohka]

Shido:
Here, ya.

Tohka:
Ahh!
...Oh...

[Tohka intently looked the bread, then sniffed. Her saliva drool down like a cascade]

Tohka:
...Is this a test of mine about to fail?!

Shido:
No, it's for you.
Stop drooling.

Tohka:
Er...Ahm!

[Chomp. She bit the bread, and opened her eye wide, looked astonished]

Tohka:
Whooooah!

[And, she continued to eat the bread]

Tohka:
(Munching) Is this what the Date thing?

Shido:
No, it's bread.

[She had eaten whole bread, licked her finger]

Tohka:
Okay...?
Is that another name for Date?
I don't understand why something so delicious can't be call the Date.

Shido:
You can call it one if you want to.

Tohka:
Fascinating.
Even those with delicious, it's still not gonna enough to be called the Date.
And, so, then necessary continues...eh?

[Tohka found frankfurt sausages grilled at the counter of the shop, which located at catercorner of the bread shop across the road. She dashed to the shop]

Tohka:
There it was!

Shido:
Not quite.

[Tohka held the sausage in her mouth, so we cannot hear clearly what she's saying. She said something like]

Tohka:
All these people! Where do they come from!
Is this war?!

[The shopping arcade was crowded by people. Tohka continued speaking while she was eating down the sausage]

Tohka:
In just a case, I better attacked before the mech-mech squad came here...

[She began creating electric power ball on the tip of her index fingers. The ball, which could evaporate all the people walking around in the shopping arcade]

Shido:
No! Wait!
You don't wanna do that!

Tohka:
Why are you stopping while I'm saving us!

Shido:
Not!
There's nothing to save us from!
No one's trying to hurt us.

[Tohka cancelled the power she created, finished to eat her sausage. She noticed, a boy, walking with his mother, was walking to the front of the convenience store]

Boy:
Look! Mama!

[The boy threw an empty pack of something into the garbage box stood aside of the store]

Boy:
See?
I threw in the trash all by myself!

Mother:
Wow!
What a good boy you are!

[The mother stroked boy's head. The boy looked happy. Seeing it Tohka, ate up remaining two Frankfurt sausages, and threw in the skews and paper bag to the garbage box. Then, she thrust to offer her head to Shido, waiting something]

Shido:
Er...?

[Shido knew what Tohka wanted him to do. He stroked her head, and she looked happy]

Tohka:
Whatever I did right now, this moment...is this a Date?

Shido:
Not really...but, you're getting closer.

Tohka:
Dates are complicated matters...
Ah! Look that thing over there!
Looks yummy!

Shido:
How in the world you're still hungry?!

[Tohka dashed away again, Shido followed her. Then, the three girls, Ai, Mai, and Mei, were just get out from the convenience store, watching Shido tagging along a girl they've never seen before]

Ai:
Am I cray, or that Shido with the new girl?

Mai:
Oh my gosh! Is that mean he's cheating on Tonomachi?!

Mei:
That's so lame!

[And, hiding in between the walls of the buildings, Origami was watching the ongoing event on Shido and Tohka]

Origami:
(That woman...I know she's a Spirit. But, there's no spatial quake...)
Sergent Origami reporting.
A-0613, needing observation device immediately.

[She called a ground force's operator by her cell phone, requesting organization's support. While Origami's reconnaissance operation was proceeding, Tohka didn't stop sufficing her appetite. She chomped a piece of xiaolongbao dumpling, spilled out the soup that the dumpling contented, yelled joyfully)

Tohka:
Nn~! Oh great this!
I can't believe humans eat such a magically delicious things!

Shido:
Ha ha...
Oh, hey, Tohka. What happened after you left yesterday?

[Tohka replied while she ate an ice-cream]

Tohka:
Same thing as usual.
I swing my sword around some, I blast artillery, and, in the end, my body disappear.
Naturally, like it always does.

Shido:
Disappeared?

Tohka:
Yes, I go to a world different from this one.
It's a dark space...
Once I get there, I just fall asleep.

Shido:
So, you mean, when you wake up, you come here?

Tohka:
Well...I don't wake up on my own.
It's more like by force.
And, it is nothing to do with what I want.
I'm just pulled here...Usually, anyway.

Shido:
By force?
(And, Spirits don't cause Spatial Quakes on purpose...They must just be accidents...Er?)
By usually? You mean, today was different?

Tohka:
Mm...how would I know?!

(Tohka talked while she still eating xiaolongbao, and she pouted. So naturally the soup of the dumpling spilled out from Tohka's mouth. Tohka ate remaining two dumplings in one go)

Shido:
Please, tell me.
Look. That might actually be the reason there wasn't a spacial quake today.

Tohka:
You're too persistent!
Besides, I have important things to do! Like, find more foods!

[Tohka stood up, leaving away from Shido]

Shido:
Tohka, come on! Wait!
(...I should have problems of money)

[Shido checked his wallet before he started to follow Tohka, there were three pieces of paper of 1,000 yen note. From above in the sly, ground force's UAE was watching down the town, searching]

Kusakabe:
It looks like she's a 98.5% match!
That's way too high to be a coincidence, of course.
...But, why is she here?!

Origami:
She isn't wearing her Spirit armor right now.
If we want to attack, this is it.

Kusakabe:
Think about where you are.
You know we can't afford to be reckless.

[Origami gripped hard her smartphone type military system's terminal, heaved out her frustration. On the terminal screen, the Spirit and Shido Itsuka were walking in shopping mall side-by-side, speaking merrily with each other]

Tohka:
What kind of place is this?

[Tohka stopped to investigate a restaurant that was in front of her. The restaurant's name was "YAMAZAKI." A sign board stood at the entrance, "Lunch Menu: w/ Bread, Lunch, Salad and Coffee 2,000~3,000 yen. Spaghetti bolognese with eggplant and tuna..." means the restaurant was beyond the budget Shido could afford]

Shido:
Er...an expensive one.

Tohka:
I don't know what that means.
I'm going in!

Shido:
Oh?! Wait! Hold on!

Tonomachi:
Well, if it isn't Shido?

[Tonomachi appeared out of the blue. He raised his right hand to greet Shido]

Shido:
...Tonomachi?

Tonomachi:
Hmm...?

[He noticed something. Dashed to Shido, and clinched his neck, whispering him]

Tonomachi:
What do we have here?
That's some hot action!
How did you managed for that kind of tale without me knowing about it, huh?
I'm a little jealous...!

[Tonomachi poked Shido's left cheek]

Shido:
Y-yeah, a lot has happened lately! I guess...

[Tohka entered into the restaurant, leaving behind Shido caught by Tonomachi]

Shido:
Ah...!

Tonomachi:
Wow! And, straight up at the top of the shelf.
It's cool men, my lady's got some pretty expensive taste, too.
Check it out!

[Tonomachi showed Shido his monitor of smartphone, virtual girl friend living in it. "Oh? You wanna give me a present?! D-don't get any wrong idea that I've got flattered!" said the girl on the display]

Shido:
(Right...his virtual girl friend)

Tonomachi:
Listen! I wanna help you.
Someone gave you these tickets, but I think that I'm impressed you find new girl, and help you score here!
You're welcome in advance~
...Let me know how it goes.

[Tonomachi pulled out the coupon tickets that worth as 10,000 yen, from out of nowhere. And handed them to Shido]

Tonomachi:
See you later, bud!

[He was leaving from the scene. His back was bright as sparkling stars. Shido entered into the restaurant]

Shido:
Wow...

[The inside of the restaurant looked more expensive than Shido thought. A chandelier was hung on the roof, all the floor was covered wine-red carpet, every place in the restaurant seemed shine in Shido's eyes]

???:
How are you today?

[An waitress greeted to Shido. Shido looked at the waitress, but she's actually Reine]

Shido:
Reine?!
W-wha---?! How---?

[Reine pressed a menu book on Shido's face to shut his mouth. Recognizing Shido started speaking with more quiet voice]

Shido:
What are you doing here?!

Reine:
Checking on Princess.
We have to make sure we're not on risk of another spatial quake.
She's been waiting for you right over there.

Tohka:
Over here, Shido!
Why are you so late!

[Tohka waved her arm to catch Shido's attention. Shido sat at the table where Tohka was]

Shido:
Sorry...

[Shido looked around inside the restaurant. Somehow, he felt everyone in the restaurant, including customers was watching them. He felt uneasy]

???:
What's up, kittens? You ready to order?

Shido:
Er...Kotori?!

Wh, I...coulda---!

[Bump! After gave Shido faint smile, Kotori slapped her metal tray in his face. She slapped it so strong, Shido's death mask was formed on the tray]

Tohka:
Hmm...This looks so good, but so does that one...I wonder which of these two is the date...?

Kotori:
Hey, if you guys can't start, I have suggestions for you.
But, how about this?

Shido, Tohka:
What about that one come with?

[Ta-dah! A large plate, fully loaded such a yummy looking foods, such as sirloin steak, spare ribs, skewers of barbecue meat, 20 cm high mounted om-rice, dozen deep-fried shrimps tied to form tower, peperoncino spaghetti dished up with mountain style, and so on, delivered to Tohka's table]

Shido:
Wow...should be called what's with all this?!

[Tohka began ingesting them. First, she rewind the mountainous spaghetti, and swallowed it with one bite]

Tohka:
Oh! Thank you!
It tastes all delicious! It must be a date!

[While Tohka devoured foods one after another, Shido whispered to Kotori]

Shido:
What are you trying to pull here, Kotori?

[Kotori spoke while she wore perfect professional's smile]

Kotori:
Thank you, we're ex too. We're pulling at all the stuffs to help you score, because I'm awesome.
But we also have some business to discuss...
As soon as you guys leave, I need you to head to south of the station.

Shido:
But, what for?
That's just a residential area...

Kotori:
Okay then...I trust you've got this.

[Then, Tohka just finished to eat up all the food on the dish plate]

Kotori:
Now, let's get this date stated.

[Kotori left from the table. Tohka gulped a glass (its size was actually as large as a large sized gyu-don bowl) of tropical juice]

---

Man A:
Checking AI analysis...
Use shop type E-5963.

Man B:
E-5963? Rodger.

[Then, houses aside a road moved away, or sank to the ground. The whole avenue changed its face from usual residential area to shopping avenue, holding a festival for its own reason]

Man B:
Open the main gate.

[Two pillars emerged from the ground. They had arms to connect each other, to form a gate. On the gate, it read "Wolcome! To Ratatoskr!"]

Tohka:
What's that?

[Tohka pointed to the river flowing below the bridge where Tohka and Shido passing by]

Tohka:
Let's eat it!
They looks so yummy!

[Shido saw which Tohka pointed at, there are black carps swimming in the river]

Shido:
No, you can't eat them.
Well...you can, but, not those.

Tohka:
Wow...they even have red ones!
They're so fast!

Shido:
Yeah, the red ones are three times as fast as others...
Don't know why they'd be here, though.
...?
'The heck is all that...?

[Shido noticed, the other side of the river was changed completely. The area was no more the residential area he used to know, but commercial area where many shops, food stalls stood. Even cinema theater he could see]

???:
Congratulations!

[Party poppers cracked everywhere when Shido and Tohka passed the gate. They were now covered with colorful tape. A man wearing Japanese Happi jacket showed up in front of them. He had white colored mohawk, he was our "Bad Marriage" Kawagoe]

Shido:
What is going on here?!

Kawagoe:
You two are this shopping arcade's one hundred thousandth visitors!
So, we have a special gift for both of you!
Everything you eat here today...will be free!

Everyone in arcade:
Congratulations!

[Dozen of people there held their respective foods, such as croquetttes, breads, pizzas, noodles, and so on]

Shido:
Thanks, but I don't get it...

[Shido got surfed sick on his face, but at least Tohka looked happy]

Tohka:
Whoa! I've never seen one of those before!

Shido:
Wh---wait, Tohka! Come back here!

[Tohka ran into the shopping avenue. Shido couldn't help but followed her. Kawagoe made a peace sign to the camera, probably hidden in the gate. Other Ratatoskr members watching on board of Fraxinus]

Mikimoto:
Nice work, Kawagoe.

Kyohei:
Alright. Light food team, get ready for service.
Fish cake, and shaved ice team, approach customers!
Noodle team! Why was the delivery late!

Reine:
...Do you think we're gonna be okay?
Shin and Tohka are moving in.

Kotori:
Glad to see we're all ready, and prepared for action.

Reine:
Speak for yourself...

---

[Origami sat, hid bind the pillar of the bridge which probably Shido and Tohka had walked to pass the river, on the farthest side from the shopping avenue. Checking her terminal, but she couldn't acquire any useful information from it, eventually the device stopped functioning with "Connection Error" message]

Origami:
The signal's jammed...

Kusakabe:
Origami, can you here me?
I've managed to squeeze mobilization orders from higher ups.
Meet at the point on 101.

Origami:
Rodger that.

---

Tohka:
Yummy! I'll check all those foods!

[Again, her mouth was filled with food. This time it was takoyaki dumplings. So we cannot hear clearly her voice. She continued investigations on Earth]

Tohka:
What's that?! It looks amazing!

[She astonished the way how human beings cooked okonomi-yaki]

Tohka:
Oww...So does this...Gimme!

[She amazed by looking 30 cm or so high, with four patties, larger than her face sized hamburger]

Shido:
Slow down! Don't lash!

[She gulped a bowl of ramen, ate arm sized rolled sushi]

Shido:
You can get it whatever you want[?], it's free.
...How the hell would this happen?

[Everyone in the avenue smiled at Tohka and Shido, they seemed really happy to feed Tohka with their foods]

Tohka:
Shido...
I'm having fun.
...Are you?

Shido:
...huh?

Tohka:
This has been such a great day and, I'm having a wonderful time here.
But I'm worried I'm the only one...You seem upset, are you mad at me?

Shido:
No way!
Of course I'm not mad at you!

Tohka:
...Are you sure...?

Shido:
I'm positive!
In fact, I'm in a great mode!
I have this a lot in my mind is all.

Tohka:
Promise you having a good time!

Shido:
Best time ever.

Tohka:
I really hope you're telling the truth!

Shido:
I am. I swear!
I'm glad we came here today...

[Shido narrowed his eyes, not squinted in angry, but looked he was looking some bright thing, seemed he was feeling delight. His face gave Tohka a peace in her mind. Tohka took, held Shido's left hand with her right hand]

Shido:
Ah...?!

Tohka:
There's so much food we have to try!
Let's get them all as we can out of this date!

Shido:
...Yeah. Let's.

[Shido reddened his face. Around them, a lot of shop owners invited Tohka and Shido]

Tohka:
Great! Come on!

Shido:
'Kay!
...Wherever you need me to go, I'll follow.

---

[A golden ball was slowly falling. When it landed to the tray, "CEO" Mikimoto rang bell. It was a raffle. Shido and Tohka won special prize]

Mikimoto:
Congratulation, you two!
You won the grand prize!
Two tickets to Dream Park redeemable any time! Wow!

Tohka:
I don't know what that means!
But it sounds like fun!

Shinzaki:
It's the most fun you ever have!

Mikimoto:
What's this?
You've never been?
That's unheard of, you gotta take a ride now!

Shido:
...Dream Park?

["Dream Park" had a fountain. Water welled up from the relief which looked like that The Mouth of Truth. And, its staying cost was 3,500 yen for Rest on weekday, and it was 7,000 for Stay. The building was unnaturally decorated flamboyantly]

Shido:
Wow...

Tohka:
Look, how beautiful this place is!
Let in adventure!
What kind of things can we do in here?!

Shido:
Well...I...don't know.

[Hiding themselves half behind the building, Mikimoto and Shinzaki was encouraging Shido]

Mikimoto:
Do it, do it, do it!

Shido:
Hey, I have an idea.
...Let's not go in there. 'Kay?

Tohka:
I don't agree!
You told me that we could go wherever I want today.
Shido, do you think I'll learn what the date is behind those doors?!

Shido:
That thing tells me that's very possible...
But I don't think it's a good idea today!
...Besides, we're not legal.

[Shido pulled Tohka away from the building]

Tohka:
I'm not ready to go yet!
How am I supposed to learn a...

Shido:
Come on! Let's go.

[Behind the entrance wall of the building, Origami hid, watching them]

Kusakabe:
Origami, where are you?
What's happening? The time to meet has passed.

Origami:
Currently, surveying the movements of the target.
Send an emergency arming device to point 088-107.

[Then, The Mouth of Truth's eyes glinted, it split half from its mouth. Origami thrust her arm into its mouth, and removed the combat suit of AST from it. Now, she dressed in the armor and ready to combat]

Kawagoe:
I can't believe I'm seeing this.
Why didn't he bring her in, and do the deed?

Kotori:
This isn't the first time you failed with that tactic, is it, Kawagoe?

Minowa:
Fact established, and acknowledged...

Kotori:
Classic Shido.
He always insist on doing everything in a proper order...
...What's that?
Rain?

Reine:
Strange...There weren't any rain cloud in the vicinity.

Kotori:
Oh, well...maybe it's for the best.

[Sudden rain made people on the street run on their way. Shido and Tohka also hurried to find shelter from rain. They entered into a video arcade nearby]

Tohka:
Where did you bring me?!
Is this a secret base of the mech-mech squad?!

[Tohka gasped when she saw machines all over the place]

Shido:
Of course not. Don't worry.

[At first, Tohka walked with dubious face. But when she found a cushion its shape was just like deep-fried breads, she changed her expression. That was a prize of the crane game. She tried it, but never succeeded]

Tohka:
Mmm...!
Why gave up?! Get it, you honorary chicken!
Shido! Tell this thing to cooperate!

Shido:
I told you, this is really tough one.
You have to have a strategy.
And, yelling to the glass doesn't work.

Tohka:
Fine. Then, how?

Shido:
This one should be easy.
It's sticking up.

[Shido pointed at the other crane game, its prizes were stuffed kittens. Tohka stared it for a short time]

Tohka:
That's not what I want!
I want the chicken.

[It's actually a deep-fried bread. But it isn't important here]

Shido:
Okay...Now made me another one like it somewhere.

[Shido looked around]

Nakatsugawa:
Ha-ha-ha-ha...!
I can catch it whichever prize you want!
Come on...pick one!

[Wearing white zentai bodysuit, Nakatsugawa hung upside-down in crane game machine, soliciting Shido to use him as a crane. Instantly looked away, Shido scrutinized the arrangement the prizes at the one Tohka wanted]

Shido:
(Maybe, that one...)
I've got it!
Listen closely. All use this, but not over here...You use the one on your side, there.
Let go, when I give the signal.

Tohka:
It's worth the shot...!

[They cast a 100 yen coin into the machine. First, Shido moved the crane widthwise and released the button. Next, Tohka started to move it in depthwise]

Shido:
Wait for it, wait for it...wait for it...NOW! LET IT GO, TOHKA!

[Tohka released the button. The crane moved to downward...then, it caught one of the cushion in its arm]

Tohka:
Chicken!

[It's deep-fried bread]

Shido:
Hold on...it still hasn't dropped yet...

[The crane dropped the cushion. Unfortunately, the cushion hooked on the edge of its exit hole]

Shido:
...I'm so sorry. That was totally my fault.
I didn't give good instructions.

[Discouraged Shido was about to leave from the machine. But, Tohka didn't give up yet]

Tohka:
Drop the chicken!
Please drop it...Why wouldn't you listen to me...?!
Shido an I work so hard on this...
Drop it...Please...Ugh...

Shido:
...It's okay.

Tohka:
I'm begging you! Drop! You have to!
PLEEEEEASE!

[Tohka's strong wish jolted the space. And, her wish made the cushion drop from the edge]

Tohka:
Ah...!

[Tohka smiled to Shido. Shido smiled back to Tohka]

Tohka, Shido:
We did it!

---

[It was almost sunset, Tohka and Shido stood at the park. The place was bit far from the town, placed on the top of the hill. They could see all the town. They could hear trains run far below them]

Tohka:
What method those use to transform?

Shido:
Er, actually, trains don't transform.

Tohka:
What?!
So, they use fusion.

Shido:
Well...they do connect to each other.

Tohka:
Oh, wow!
...Thank you. I had so much fun today.

Shido:
Good. Me too.
Thanks for coming.

Tohka:
I am a little disappointed that we didn't get to explorer that Dream Park...

Shido:
Ah, er...I-it's totally overrated...

Tohka:
Hm, if you say so.
But...Shido?
The day is almost over, and I still didn't see a Date...

Can you tell me what one is like?

Shido:
...A date is just one a girl and a boy go out, and have a good time together.
You can't actually see one.

Tohka:
Oh, That makes sense!
Well, in that case, I would say we had a wonderful date today.

Shido:
Eh...sure.

Tohka:
I like dates.
They're nice.

[They continued to stare at the scenery that spread before them. The sun almost touched the top of the mountain across the town]

Kusakabe:
Not good...
I can't believe I'm seeing this.
A Spirit shows up without a spacial quake, and connect with a human boy...

Origami:
...Permission to shoot, Ms?

Kusakabe:
Not yet.
Still waiting here from the top.
This is very unusual situation.
No one's evacuated, we just have to wait and see.
...Point alpha here.

[Kusakabe seemed caught some contact from the organization]

Kusakabe:
What happened?
...What?!
We've got permission to shoot?

[Origami magnified the scope vision of her long rifle, to prepare to shoot down Tohka]

Tohka:
All the humans were very kind today...

Shido:
No one tried to kill you, did they?
I knew you'd be okay.

Tohka:
Yeah, you're right.
I never knew the world was so kind...so much fun...and, so beautiful...
I love it here.
And now...I understand why mech-mech squad is after me.
Because, whenever I appeared in this world, something bad happens.
I ruin something beautiful...
I ruin your world.

Shido:
That's not true...

Tohka:
So, listen...
I've been thinking its better if I don't exist any more.

Shido:
Don't say that!

Tohka:
...

Shido:
We're fine!
There was no spatial quake, was there?
You didn't ruin anything!

Tohka:
Yes, but...that doesn't mean that won't be on the next time I appear.
Once I back and fall sleep...I won't able to control myself.

Shido:
Fine! Then I guess you just can't go back!
Have you ever even tried?
Just once.
Just try staying here!

Tohka:
Even if I did, there's so many thing I don't know about this world!

Shido:
I'll teach you whatever you don't know.

Tohka:
Then, I need food, and place to sleep...
What if something happens what I'm not prepared for?

Shido:
I'm going to take care of you.
If something comes up that we need to deal with, we'll deal with it.

Tohka:
Are you sure...?
Am I even allowed to be here...?
Is it okay for me to be alive in this world...?

Shido:
Yes, it is.

Tohka:
You are the only one who said that to me...
Humans like that mech-mech squad...they don't want to risk it.
They don't want something dangerous as me nearby---

Shido:
I don't care about them!
Even if everyone else reject you,
It doesn't change the fact I accept you!
I don't want you to leave!

[Tohka opened her eyes wide. Shido offered his right hand to Tohka]

Shido:
Take my hand.
That's the only job you have right now!

[Tohka welled water in her eyes, but she smiled. She held Shido's hand. But, right then, Shido noticed, or his intuition felt something grave dander incoming]

Kusakabe:
Distance, 512.15. Wind direction, 40.8. Wind speed, 0.4. Temperature, 24 degrees. RH, 52.8. We're all clear.

[Silently waited Origami, pulled trigger of her rifle. The shot was intended to kill the Spirit, Princess, But...]

Shido:
Tohka!

[Shido pushed Tohka back. She fell on her back]

Tohka:
Ah!
...What are you doing?!

[At first, Tohka totally had no idea why he pushed away her. But when she yelled at him, she instantly recognize what was going on now. Cotton which was stuffed in the cushion they won were flying in the air, among them, blood splattered. The cushion got a hole, its size was a bit larger than the size of a fist, and so Shido, stood behind the cushion. Through those holes, it could see Tohka's frozen face. Shido fell on his back. A pool made by his blood spread fast under him]

Kusakabe:
Origami! Origami! Come in!

[Origami dropped her weapon, stood on her knee. She couldn't fully grasp what had happened, her mind lost. Tohka stepped into the pool made by Shido's blood. It then spread over two meter diameter. Tohka looked down his body]

Tohka:
Shido...

[Tohka unclothed her jacket, covered Shido's wound]

Tohka:
I thought, maybe if you were here for me, it'll be okay...
Might be hard, but I'll be able to do with you by my side.
I can get through anything when I'm with you...
But it doesn't matter...It's no use...!
You're gone now!
...I'm on my own!
This world has rejected me!

[She stood up, raised her right arm to the sky. A dark cloud was formed above her, then, thundered down black electricity on Tohka. Her outfit began transforming]

Tohka:
Adonai Melek!

[Now, she wore an armor the same she first appeared. Then, she stomped. It cracked the ground, and appeared wall like of the sheath for the sword)

Tohka:
Sandalphon!

[She pulled out the broad sword. And, she cut the sheath. The sheath crumbled, then gathered to the broad sword, strengthened it]

Tohka:
Halvanhelev!

[The broad sword became huge, nearly three times taller than Tohka]

Tohka:
How dare you...

[She raised up the broad sword]

Tohka:
How dare you reject me!

[The sword swung down, a purple shock wave generated. The shock wave cut the part of the hill, land. A large amount of area crumbled down]

Kusakabe:
No way...
Origami! Retreat immediately!
Support troops! Where are you?!
Origami! Do you read me?!

[Origami hadn't got over, she stared Princess flew at right above her with her huge sword]

Tohka:
So, it was you...
You are the one who did it.
You killed my only friend.
And, with him, my soul...just admit it.

Origami:
Yes...
I killed Shido Itsuka...

Tohka:
Kill her...
She must pay what she've done...
You must die...!

[Tohka glared Origami with her fiercest face. Origami couldn't move a bit]

Shinzaki:
It doesn't look like a pulse or heartbeat registering for Shido!

[Most of the person in Fraxinus seemed upset due to Shido's death and immediate danger of the approaching spatial quake. The message "Spatial Quake evacuation order issued" flew inside the ship]

Nakatsugawa:
The spatial quake is going off.
This can't be good.

Mikimoto:
Resident evacuation is still at 7%!

Kotori:
We're lucky here there aren't many houses nearby.
But, this rate, the whole town'll be decimated within minutes...

[Kotori held a pop candy in her mouth]

Kotori:
If he were a knight, he will burn the pass and free.
But he could also killed with the Princess, then he's obviously not her concern.
...hmm?

Kawagoe:
Excuse me, commander!
What we hear about Shido?

Kotori:
Oh, I wouldn't worry too much about him.
My brother won't be finished off by something like that.

Everyone in Fraxinus:
Huh?!

[Everyone turned to watch the monitor, which showed Shido Itsuka laid on the ground. A frame was quivering on his wound]

Kotori:
There it is.

[The frame burned away the jacket Tohka gave to him. It couldn't tell which was a frame a cause or a result, but Shido's wound which had been around 10cm diameter hole shrunk, closed. And he woke up]

Shido:
Wha---ch! Agh! Ah!

[His first reaction from the sleep was a surprise. Something burned on his berry, so he hurried to sit up and tried to cease the fire. He seemed he already forgot he was shot a few minutes ago]

Shido:
Huh...where am I?

[In Fraxinus, every clue members were dumbfounded. They couldn't understand what had happened]

Minowa:
Commander!
What...what we do now?

Kotori:
I already told you.
Even if Shido died, soon he be able to start a new game.
So, what the heck are you dragging ass for?
Get down there to cover him immediately!

Reine:
No one else's able to stop her.
It has to be him...

Kotori:
That's right.
The method will be decided to save her last.

[Tohka attacked consecutively Origami, who sat still on the ground. The shock wave evaded from Origami blew trees, even power transmission towers behind her]

Origami:
(I did...I killed someone...I'm like them, the Spirits...We're the same...)

Tohka:
Aaaaaahhh!

[Tohka hammered down her sword on Origami. Although she was protected by her defensive field, she got damage, and she spat blood]

Tohka:
...We must end this.

Origami:
(Dad...mon...I'm sorry...)

Tohka:
Shido...I promise to avenge you!

[Tohka swung up the sword, ready to crush Origami. But then she heard some one yelled, falling down from the sky]

Shido:
Aaaahhhgg!

Tohka:
What...?! He's alive!

[Tohka caught Shido in the air]

Tohka:
Shido...?!
Is it really you?

Shido:
Yeah...well, I think it is.

Tohka:
Oh, thank you...Thank you for coming back!

Shido:
Don't cry. Everything's OK now...er?

[The sword Tohka holding emitted red light, black electricity was about flew out]

Shido:
Tohka...what the heck is that?

Tohka:
I accidentally unsealed Helvanhelev...I have to find somewhere to release it!

Shido:
No! Hold on! You definitely can't do that!

Tohka:
But, what should I do?!
It's already reached its critical stage!

Kotori:
Shido, can you hear me?
Now is the time to use that method I told you earlier.
It's the only way you are able to save her.

Shido:
Umm...
Alright, Tohka, listen to me.
We have to kiss now, okay?

Tohka:
We...what?

Shido:
Urm...never mind. Forget it.
I'm sorry. There has to be another way.

Tohka:
No! I don't know what the kiss is!

Shido:
Huh?

Tohka:
Teach me how to do it!

Shido:
Um...'kay, it's that we put our lips together, and then we---

[Tohka put her lips on Shido's. He couldn't react anything. As soon as they kissed each other, the huge sword Helvanhelev shuttered, vanished in the air. They were descending to the ground while the armor Tohka wearing was also vanishing gradually. When they reached to the ground, Tohka became almost stark naked]

Shido:
I'm so sorry!
They told me this was the only way I could reverse it...?

[Tohka nestled close to Shido, told to him]

Tohka:
Just, don't let me go...I'm not to ready for you to see me naked yet.

Shido:
...

Tohka:
Shido...

Shido:
Uh-huh?

Tohka:
Will you, erm...take me out on another date sometime?

Shido:
...Of course.
Anytime you want to.

[Tohka made her brightest smile to Shido]

--- ED ---

Okamine:
Kids! I'd like to introduce you to our new transfer student!

[There was the name "Tohka Yatogami" on the chalkboard, and Tohka stood at the front of the classroom, next to Okamine. Shido was completely perplexed. Origami quietly sat on her chair]

Tohka:
I'm Tohka Yatogami!
I'm so excited to meet all of you!
