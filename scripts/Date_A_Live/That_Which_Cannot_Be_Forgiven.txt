  [Origami was mumbling in dark monitor room]

Origami:
Kotori Itsuka...

[Real Kotori was on a free fall attraction in the amusement park. Sweat all around her pale face]

Kotori:
Ugh...

Shido:
Hee hee hee...

Kotori:
Um...Is it too late to get off?
...I wanna.

Shido:
Oh, it's way too late. Ha ha.

[Then, they began to fall]

Kotori:
AAAAAAAAGH!

--- OP ---

Narration:
More often than not, feelings have a way of complicating things.
The red flame has forgotten the truth.
While the white flame has discovered it.
And, when these two flames meet...everything will burned to ash.

---

[Next, Kotori was on a roller coaster. The coaster almost reached its pinnacle, about to fall]

Kotori:
Umm...these rides are so stupid...!

Shido:
Fu fu fu...

[Shido smirked. The coaster started to increase its speed]

Kotori:
AAAAAAAAGH!

Shido:
Ho hoooooo!

[Kyouhei and Reine were observing them on Fraxinus bridge]

Kyouhei:
Yeah...
I wonder if Shido will survive this.
She's mad.

Reine:
Actually, this might end up being exactly what Kotori needed.
Haa...

[Reine heaved short sigh]

Reine:
I think he just made the perfect call.
We've blown this date out of proportion, instead of letting it be.

Kyouhei:
I hope you're right...

[Shido brought Kotori to a haunted house. Surrounded by skeleton, beheaded faces, an woman wearing triangle cloth on her head, Kotori seemed feeling unwell]

Shido:
Ha ha ha...are you scared?
Give me your hand.

Kotori:
What for?!
I'm not some frighten kid, you know!
Unless...you're the one who's actually freaking out.
You scared?

[Shido responded to Kotori with theatrical way]

Shido:
Yes! That's it!
Please hold hand on me!
I'm so scared!

Kotori:
Stop acting like a weirdo!

Shido:
Ohh...Please, Kotori, hold my hand!
I'm so scared!

Kotori:
Fine! And, you shut up!

[Shido offered his left hand, and Kotori held it with her right hand]

Shido:
Heh heh...

[In Fraxinus, Kyouhei deplored their action]

Kyouhei:
Ahh! Shido, no! What a waste!
If you hug to the Commander, you could legitimately enjoy her soft, supple body...
You just lost the perfect opportunity to get a footprint on a right in your face!

[Shido drove a go-kart, Kotori was next to him]

Kyouhei:
Why?! Why are you riding together?!
You should let the Commander drive the car by herself! You idiot!
That way...you could be running in front of her, as a personal target!
Imagine a gradually shrieking distance with the Commander, smiling sadistically, trying to run you down in crush your dreams!
Ohh...Mercy! Mercy, Commander! Have mercy!
Oh! Have mercy!

[Kyouhei thrashed about in the floor with his imagination. Other clew looked got irritated with noisy Vice Commander]

Shinzaki:
Shido was right.
Throwing out his head-set was a good call.

[Clew nodded to Shinzaki's comment]

---

[In the water park, Tohka and Yoshino were riding on jungle cruise]

Tohka:
Wow! This jungle cruise is everything Shido said it would be!

Yoshino:
Yes, it is. I'm having fun!

Yoshinon:
There's good to relax!

Tohka:
Don't you think it would be more fun when Shido and Kotori with us though?
Why didn't they wanna come to?
...Wait, why don't we go get them?

[Yoshino looked slightly upset]

Yoshino:
You can't do that, Tohka!

Tohka:
Why not?
We should all be having a good time together.

Yoshino:
Yeah, but...that's not it...

Yoshinon:
We might have overheard...something kind of a major.

[Yoshinon explained that they've heard while they're on Fraxinus, Shido and Reine talking about]

Tohka:
Kotori's really a Spirit?!

Yoshino:
Shido's trying to save her...
He's going to seal her power a way like he did both of us...
He needs this time...So, we shouldn't interrupt him.
We better let him do what he needs to...

Yoshinon:
We heard that if he fails, they don't know what will happen to Kotori.
Chances are it's not good.
We need to stay away Tohka.

Tohka:
Yeah, okay. I guess you're right.
But I do wish there are something we could do to help them.
I owe Kotori so much for what she's given me.
It's hard to just sit here.
Besides, I like Kotori a lot.
Don't you think she has the same kind of smell of Shido?

Yoshino:
Nn...

Yoshino:
That's probably...because they use the same shampoo!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

[Yoshinon break the serious atmosphere they had made. Tohka narrowed her eyes as if she said "I can't believe this creature"]

Yoshino:
We have to Shido handle this...
It's the best thing for Kotori...

---

[An emergency alarm ringing aloud over ground force's base]

Officer A:
We've got an emergency here!
DW029 had disappear!
There's no evidence of a transport vehicle!

[Kusakabe stood in the room which had stored the armor, now empty]

Kusakabe:
Agh...

Officer B:
The White Licorice battle suit has been stolen.
Whoever has it took all the ammunition as well.
It isn't ready for field use yet. The deployment inspection made that very clear.

[Kusakabe recalled Origami talked to her]

Origami:
Do you think it would be possible to even to defeat Ifrit using this?

Kusakabe:
Origami...

---

[In amusement park, Shido and Kotori were sitting at the bench]

Kotori:
Haa...

Shido:
Man! I underestimated this theme park!
Talk about a good time!

Kotori:
Humph! You are so immature!
Maybe, try to get out of those diapers before you graduate!

Shido:
This from the girl who was freaking out about a water slide?

Kotori:
You mean, death trap!
...Well, whatever, I'm over it.
And, besides, at least it wasn't totally boring, you know.

Shido:
Yup, that's true...

[They took a look around the park. Two couples were passing by the park]

Shido:
It's been a long time, right?
Since we've been to with theme park like this...
I can't remember, though...Do you know?

Kotori:
Yeah, five years.

Shido:
Really? That long?

[The words, five years ago, made Shido forced to remember that Origami said to him]

Origami:
Spirits killed my parents...They burned them.

Kotori:
Five years ago...somehow, I became a flame Spirit.

[Shido stare at Kotori]

Kotori:
What is it?
...Oh, is it happening now...?

Shido:
Kotori.

[Somehow, Kotori blushed her cheeks, hung her face down from embarrassment]

Kotori:
Yeah! What is it?!
Er...look, Shido...I---I think, well, this is just as good of a time as any, but...
I just don't...I wanna go somewhere with your people because I'm really embarrassed...

Shido:
...Why?

Kotori:
Er...it's not obvious...?

Shido:
We'll be okay right here.
I promise you.

Kotori:
Uh...

Shido:
Now...listen, Kotori...

Kotori:
Yeah...what?

Shido:
...I have a question.

Kotori:
Eww...You can't just ask me like that!
It's super awkward!
...Eh? Wait.
...No! Never mind and ignore me!
I'm all right! So, please just hurry up in asking your question!

Shido:
Yeah, OK...?
...So, listen, about...five years ag---

[Suddenly, Shido was surrounded by polygonal green field, shut himself from out of the field. And, an explosion occurred just next to him, where Kotori sat]

Shido:
...?
Kotori?!

[Shido tried to run to find Kotori, but the green field prohibited him to the place where Kotori was. He looked up the sky. There was a large battle suit, and Origami was its wearer]

Origami:
Shido! It's dangerous here!
You need to leave!

Shido:
Origami...?!

[Black smoke rose up from the hole the explosion made. The amusement park became a war zone in an instant, visitors were running away to the exit of the park]

Shido:
Origami!
Why?! Do you have any idea what you just did?!

Origami:
Yes. Kotori is dead.
I killed her.

[And, Kotori's voice resounded out of nowhere]

Kotori:
Ha! You killed me?
You don't make a sound like it was that big of a deal.

[Kotori appeared from the black smoke, she wore flame around her body]

Kotori:
I'm disappointed.
I thought you were smarter than that, but apparently, I was giving you far too much credit.
Who knew you get a hold of a missile? And, who knew you are crazy enough to use it?!
Especially when you consider how many innocent people are around us?!

Origami:
Mm...!

[Origami began running her machine gun to shoot Kotori]

Shido:
No!

[Kotori made a flame wall, blocked the bullets Origami shot. She called the name of her divine armor]

Kotori:
Elohim Gibor.

[The flame enveloped Kotori, turning into cloths, an ancient raiment, and a robe of feathers]

Kotori:
Camael.

[A large broad axe appeared from the flame]

Origami:
...I found you, FINALLY!

[Origami made strong shock wave. It blew Shido away from Kotori]

Shido:
Argh...!
Kotori! Origami! Stop!

Origami:
Wraaah!

[Origami launched countless missiles to Kotori, made the place around Kotori a blazing inferno]

Shido:
You have to stop this!
Please, stop!

---

[The sound of explosion and gunfire could hear in the water park, too. Every visitors were running to the exit]

Yoshino:
I...it is weird...

Tohka:
I know.
Come on. Let's go.

[Yoshinon grabbed Tohka's hand to stop her]

Tohka:
Hey! What are you doing, Yoshinon?!

Yoshinon:
You can't go, Tohka!
Remember, your powers are sealed inside Shido right now, so you might not even be able to protect yourself!
Whoever that, it has to be pretty strong to create such a big explosion.
If you go, there's no guarantee you'll come back alive!
...Huh?

Tohka:
I appreciate the warning.
But, I'm not making Shido face that alone.

Yoshinon:
But, Tohka...

[Purple sparkle emitted from Tohka. It became an armor and made Tohka partially return into Spirit state]

Tohka:
Shido is trying save my friend Kotori.
He won't give up on her.
Me, neither.
Let's go.

[Tohka flew away from Yoshino and Yoshinon]

Yoshino:
Hey, Yoshinon...?
I am...well, can I go?

Yoshinon:
If you feel that strongly about it, I won't stop you.

Yoshino:
Aha!

[Green light started to shroud Yoshino]

---

[Origami continued to launch countless missiles, the sound of explosion didn't cease. But, it seems they were almost no threat for Kotori]

Kotori:
Why on earth which you choose to use such an ill-behaving weapon?

[Kotori jumped to the sky. Origami traced her movement, and made protecting field around Kotori]

Origami:
Deploying Territory, marking coordinates!

[Then, Origami shot missiles into the closed field, detonated them. After the explosion, although Kotori can afford to retain smiles on her face, a part of her cloth burned out]

Kotori:
...Shockingly, not too bad.
I haven't seen that suit before.
It must be a new one.

[Kotori swung her left arm, and the damage on her cloths disappeared]

Kotori:
Hee hee...

[Kotori felt sudden giddiness]

Kotori:
(No...I'd used too much power...?!)

Shido:
Kotori!

Origami:
Cleave Leaf ready! Fire!

[Origami's armor generated two whip-like electric objects, which bound Kotori]

Origami:
Deploying Territory!

[The protecting field concealed Kotori again. The Territory was much smaller than the previous one]

Origami:
Blaster Arc ready!
Annihilate her!

[Origami shot two high-powered laser beams to inner side of the Territory. Condensed energy could not be encapsulated within the field, countless shred of laser beams leaked from the field, damaged all around the park]

Shido:
Kotori!

Kotori:
Heh!
Wrrah!

[The flame, then next Kotori, appeared right above Origami, and hammered down her huge war-axe to Origami]

Origami:
Protect Territory! Deploy!

[Kotori consecutively attacked Origami. She must be in the blind-spot of the armor, so Origami could not strike back at Kotori]

Kotori:
Oh no, where did all your power go?
You're going to beat me, right?
You're going to shoot me, right?
You're going to kill me, right?
Then stop stalling. Go on, take in before it's too late.
...Otherwise, teh heh heh...You'll be dead before you know what hit you.

Shido:
Kotori, stop it!

[Kotori broke the protection field, and floating device of Origami's armor. Origami landed down to the ground]

Origami:
Argh!

Kotori:
What? Finished already?
That's no fun at all.
...Camael, Megiddo!

[The broad axe changed it's form, now it was a huge caliber cannon attached to Kotori's right arm]

Kotori:
Do something.
Because if you don't, I have absolutely no use for you.

Shido:
I said, knock it off!

[Shido run to Kotori and Origami]

Origami:
Damn you, Ifrit...!

[Kotori began charging her flame into the flame canon, she aimed at Origami. The distance was almost point blank]

Kotori:
Sounds practically dreadful, don't you think?
Where did you here about my little nick name?

Origami:
This is how you did it, isn't it?
This is how you murder my parents five years ago!

Kotori:
?!
What do you mean?

Origami:
Five years ago, my parents were brutally killed by a Flame Spirit.
I watched just you murdered them!
I remember everything.
How could I forget that though?
How could anyone...
Now your pay!
This is where you die!
And, I'm the one who's going to kill you!

Kotori:
No...You don't...You're lying...

[Origami reactivated the armor's floating power, flew to the air]

Origami:
This time, I won't this!

[Origami ejected Cleave Leaf, bound Kotori]

Shido:
Kotori! No!

Origami:
Territory condense!
White Licorice! Critical driving force!

[Shido jumped into between Origami and Kotori]

Shido:
Origami, please stop!
You can't do this!

Origami:
Shido! Get out of my way!

Shido:
Like hell I will!

Origami:
I told you...since they've died, my only purpose in life has been avenge my parents, killing Ifrit...killing Kotori, is the only reason I have for living.

Shido:
You can't...you can't kill my sister.
If you pull that trigger...there's no going back...

[Shido, somehow remembered Mana talking to him one day]

Mana:
I do this all the time.

Shido:
I don't wanna see you end up like Mana...

Origami:
I don't care what you want.
My goal is kill Ifrit with my own hands!

Shido:
...Origami, just answer one thing.
You're only after Ifrit, right?
You want the Flame Spirit.
You're not after my sister at all.
You don't want kill Kotori Itsuka, do you?

Origami:
What are you talking about?

Shido:
Just answer me!
You after the Flame Spirit.
And, my little sister has nothing to do with it.
Isn't that right?

Origami:
You're not make any sense, Shido.
Yes, I'm after Ifrit, the Flame Spirit.
But, your little sister is a Spirit.
...No matter what you say, that is a fact.
So, please, get out of my way.

Shido:
Just wait!
Origami, I need you to give me some time!

Origami:
No! This is my best chance to take her down, and I'm not throwing that away!

Shido:
Listen to me!
I know it's sounds like an excuse, but I'm not about to just sit here while you murder my little sister!
And, on top of that, I can't do nothing more my friend is in so much pain!

Origami:
...Yes, even so...

[Origami deployed the Territory around Shido, confined him into it]

Shido:
Origami!

[Origami touched the trigger, pulling it with firm determination to kill someone she know well. She screamed]

Origami:
AAAAAAAH!

Tohka:
Wraah!

[Just about Origami to shot Kotori, Tohka slashed Origami with her broad sword, distracted her concentration. And Origami's canon barrel was frozen, disabled by ice]

Shido:
Tohka?! Yoshino?!

Tohka:
We're here. Are you OK?

Yoshinon:
Whaahooo! Thank yooou!
Don't worry, you can thank us later!

Yoshino:
Yoshinon...not now...

Origami:
Move!

[Origami forcibly shot the laser beam to Tohka and Yoshino. The laser beam broke the ice, assaulted them. They flew to the sky]

Tohka:
Shido! Take Kotori and get out of here!
We can take care of this!

Shido:
Wait! Are you sure?!

Tohka:
Yes! Now, go!

Yoshino:
Hurry! It can't last much longer!

Shido:
Thank you!

[Perhaps, because her focus switched to Tohka and Yoshino, Origami's confining field around Kotori and Shido was now discharged. Shido held Kotori in his arms, dashed to hide]

Origami:
I don't have time to slew of lag with you two!

[Origami activated armor's light saber. Tohka and Origami locked their swords]

Tohka:
Come on, Origami!
You have to stop this!
There's no point in killing Kotori!

Origami:
You don't know what you're talking about?!

Tohka:
Yes, I do!
Don't you remember?!
You shot Shido!
We both thought you had killed him!

Origami:
...!

Tohka:
It was so painful!
I never felt that sad before!
My heart broken!
And, more lonely ever!
Isn't that how you felt when you lost your parents?!
Do you really want to put Shido through that kind of pain?!
Forget?! that's not fair! You're fiend! Selfish!
Why would you want to hurt such wonderful people?!

Origami:
Ugg...!

[Origami recalled that Shido once told her]

Shido:
Promise me something. Promise you'll stop to hurt good people.

[Her screams meant to represent her agony. Origami pulled Tohka away, and launched missiles]

Origami:
AAAAAGGGH!

[The missiles hit Tohka directly]

Tohka:
Daaah!

[Shido and Kotori were hiding behind the building]

Kotori:
Shido...I'm so sorry about this...

Shido:
Don't worry about it.
I'd figured something out.
...Look, sis.

Kotori:
Er...yeah?

Shido:
(How am I supposed to confirm Kotori's happiness meter without getting in touch with Reine...?
I have to seal her power, and I have to do it now...!)

Origami:
Ifrit!

[Origami found Kotori and Shido, flying toward them. Shido continued to talk to Kotori]

Shido:
Focus on me!
Kotori...The truth is...well, you're always be my favor little sister...
I'm proud of you than you ever understand.
I adore everything about you.
And I...I love you.

Kotori:
Eh...really?

Shido:
...What about you?
How do you feel about me?

Kotori:
Um...isn't this kind of an awkward time to ask...?

[Origami was approaching]

Shido:
Kotori!

Kotori:
I do the same way!
I love you, too!
I've always loved you!
I love you more than anything!
...Mm!

[Shido pushed his lips against Kotori's. And, he remembered when he injured in the fire incident five years ago, Kotori saved Shido by kissing him and flew her power into him]

Shido:
...Do you remember now?

Kotori:
...Five years ago, I saw her...There was some one else...


[Then, explosions made by Origami burned around Shido and Kotori. Shido tried to evacuate from the site, holding Kotori in his arms, but he got an explosion burst right behind him]

Shido:
Wwaaaah!

Origami:
Shido...!

[But, the wounds Shido got immediately healed after the flames enveloped the spot]

Origami:
Eh...?!
What just happened...?

[Shido laid Kotori on the ground, and faced to Origami]

Shido:
Origami...you said it yourself, you're after Ifrit, the Flame Spirit is the one you want.
You don't want to hurt my sister.
...She's not a Spirit anymore.
She's human.
So, come on, change your aim.
I'm Ifrit now, target me!

Origami:
I don't under stand...
What are you saying?!

Shido:
I remember...I know what really happened five years ago.
I know what we did!

Origami:
But...Ifrit killed my parents!

Shido:
You are right that Ifrit was the reason of fire started.
But, understand...Kotori didn't kill anyone.

Origami:
No! That can't be!
I know I saw Spirit that day!

Shido:
Yes, there was one there.
It's the same Spirit that make Kotori suffer through all of this.

Origami:
...Do you feel expect me to believe you?

Shido:
Yeah.

Origami:
I want to, but I...I just can't.

[Origami activated her electric saber]

Shido:
If that's the case, you don't have a choice.
Shoot me.
Kill, Ifrit.
...Come on, you said it before, right?

[Shido made Origami recall what she told to him]

Origami:
No one should ever have to feel the way I felt that day...!

[Origami suddenly broke her balance, her saber disappeared. She knelt to the ground. The battle suit automatically detached from her]

Origami:
Activation limit...?!
No! I won't be stopped now!

[She pulled out a hand gun from her back pack, aimed at Kotori]

Shido:
Put the gun down!
You can't take Kotori away from me!
She saved my life!
If it weren't for her, I wouldn't be here!
Believe me...please, you have to believe me...!

[Origami's hand was shaking]

Origami:
No...! I can't...let go...

[Origami passed out, fell to the ground]

---

[The time was now almost sunset. Kurumi was stood alone on the roof space of some building. Her stretched shadow reached to red liquid pool formed on the ground, so she just finished to take her prey]

Kurumi:
Hmm...Well, that's not going to be nearly enough...

---

[Shido and Reine were talking in Fraxinus bridge. No other crew members were there]

Reine:
Shin, I'm so sorry.
I'm entirely responsible for what happened today.

Shido:
You mean, because you had Tohka and Yoshino go on the date?
That wasn't all that bad.

Reine:
No, I should never have sent you out on that date in the first place.
Instead, I should had you sealed her power as soon as you woke up yesterday.
But, Kotori was so exited about the date...I don't know, I just couldn't take that away from her.

Shido:
Oh, but, even so...that was impossible, right?
Her happiness meter, it wasn't even full.

[Reine turned on the monitor. Kotori's conditions were displayed on it]

Shido:
Er...what is this?

Reine:
There are all the changes we recorded in Kotori's feelings toward you since we measured her yesterday.
As you can see, they haven't changed in the least.
They've been maxed out the whole time.
She told you as much herself, didn't she?
Kotori loves her big brother more than anything.

Shido:
...

Kotori:
Wraah!

[Kotori appeared out of nowhere, kicked Shido's back, and knocked him off]

Kotori:
Something must be broken!
There's no way those stupid measurements are right!

Reine:
Not true.

Kotori:
Aggh!

Reine:
There is nothing wrong with the measurement.

Kotori:
Say the numbers offer buy me a dozen cream puffs!

Reine:
My apology, Shin. The measurements are wrong.

[All Fraxinus crew sat on their respective seat, curiously watching their conversation]

Shido:
Fine, whatever...
Anyway, you're sure you are all right?
Shouldn't you be resting, or not kicking me?

Kotori:
Don't have that kind of time.
I have a long report to write, you know.
We've finally got our memories back, but they could always be erased again.
If we wanna make sure we can remember what really happen to us five years ago, then we would probably be smart to record the truth somewhere other than either one of our two heads.

Shido:
Under stood...
Don't work too hard.

Kotori:
I won't.

[Kotori start to leave from the room]

Kotori:
...Oh, Shido?
You know what you said before you sealed my Spirit power?
Was that true?

Shido:
Erm...Yeah, of course it was.
I do love you. I always will.

[Kotori made her cheek blush, begin writhing in embarrassment]

Kotori:
Er...I was wondering...
Because...no reason...

Shido:
As a sister, of course.

Kotori:
That's what you meant?!

[Kotori jumped to kick Shido]

Shido:
Argh!

[Irritating Kotori leaving the room]

Shido:
Kotori.

Kotori:
What do you want?!

Shido:
I really like how those ribbons look on you.

Kotori:
...Oh, well...thanks big bro.

[Kotori didn't turn around, and walked out of the room. The door shut behind Kotori]

---

[White Licorice was retrieved by the ground force. Origami was in the hospital, tightly bound to sickbed. Shido and Tohka were in the park on the hilltop, where they sometimes use]

Shido:
Hey, thanks for saving me.
If you and Yoshino hadn't come, I don't know what would happen to Kotori...Or, Origami for that manner.

Tohka:
Mm...I just responded to your feelings.
I'm sure it was the same for Yoshino.
I hope you keep saving any other Spirits that might appear.
Like you saved me, and Yoshino...and Kotori, too.

Shido:
Sure. I promise.

Tohka:
But...I wish you wouldn't kiss them.
I don't know why, but I don't like it when I see you kissing someone else.
What is that about?
It's such a weird feeling...

Shido:
Well, let's see...
I...don't know if I can explain it. It's complicated.

Tohka:
I think you just shut up and kiss me!

Shido:
Oh, do you?!

Tohka:
I do...I really do.

[The situation seemed perfect for them, Shido held Tohka's shoulder, and closed the distance between his face and Tohka. But, Kotori interrupted them from Fraxinus]

Kotori:
Wooo! Wait and go, Shido!
Don't mind us. Just keep on doing what you about to do.

Shido:
Why are you guy still watching me?!

[Tohka pulled Shido to face her again]

Tohka:
Ignore them...I'm right here...ah...

[Kotori continued to tease him. And, other Fraxinus crew members followed her, calling it in unison]

Kotori:
Kiss her! Kiss her!

Fraxinus Crew:
Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!

["Smooch," anyhow, Shido managed to kiss, but not to Tohka. Before they knew, Yoshinon was in the way to him]

Yoshinon:
Ha!
To be continued!

Yoshino:
...Someday!
