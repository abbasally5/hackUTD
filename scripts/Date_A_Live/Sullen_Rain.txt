  [Shido was running in heavy rain. He didn't have an umbrella, so he decided to get shelter under the large tree stood in the shrine. He murmured]

Shido:
The weather forecast isn't really off lately...
So much for only a 10% chance in morning.

[Splash. He heard someone splashed in the pool. He turned, looked at the source of the sound. There was a child girl hopping around, pool to pool. She wore rubber boots, so she shouldn't worry about got wet her socks. But then, maybe slipped on muddy ground, she fell down on the ground. Shido ran to her side]

Shido:
Hey, are you okay?

[The girl sat up]

Shido:
Oh, good...
You're not hurt?

[The girl glanced at Shido. She crawled to the tree to make a distance, promptly she recognize someone was nearby]

Shido:
Guess not, then...?

Girl:
Please...don't come any closer to me.

Shido:
Hmm?

Girl:
Don't hurt me...
Please...please, don't hurt me.

--- OP ---

Narration:
The rain comes from the unknown world.
Washing the earth with its tears.
Is this new meeting a temporary necessity?
Or, it's more likely to be a contrived coincidence?
Because, as we all know, there is more than one truth.

---

[In the classroom, perhaps next day, Tohka slammed open the door]

Tohka:
Shido!
I made these things called cookies!
We're supposed to make them during cooking class.
And, the other students told me how!
So, do you wanna try one?

Shido:
Erm...sure.
I-I'd love to. Thanks.

[Shido flinched because all the student in the classroom looked at him curiously. Behind the door of the room, Origami stood still]

Shido:
Hey, Tobiichi.

Tohka:
No way!
You get out!
You can't go Shido!
Now, witch is going to more damage!

Origami:
I'm so sorry.
Although, I know an apology is hardly enough...

[Origami bowed to Shido, folded her both arms in front of her, showed her mea culpa in sincerest manner]

Ai:
Why is the super genius apologizing to him? What are we messing?

Mai:
Maybe he's got some dirt on her?

Mei:
That's so lame!

[The trio was whispering behind the Shido. Perhaps because he noticed it, he made bitter face]

Shido:
Oh, it's fine.
You can stop bowing now...
Just don't worry about it, 'kay?

[Then, Origami grabbed Shido's neck tie, choked him up]

Origami:
Listen up. No more cheating, okay?

[Tohka was upsetting around them]

Tohka:
Get a stinky hand off him!

Origami:
The report said that you stayed.
Tell me what are you still doing here?

Tohka:
That's none of your business!
Now, focus, Shido.
Forget about the stupid ugly witch.
Eat my cookies.

[Tohka offered a Tupperware fully contained of cookies. Tohka's cookies were primitive, but fun looking ones]

Origami:
And, mine.
I baked cookies, too.

[Compared to Tohka's, Origami's cookies were more sophisticated. They were timidly arranged in the container, almost professional grade]

Tohka:
Ugggh...You need to stop copying me!

Origami:
Actually, I baked mine first, so you're copying me.

Tohka:
Wrong! And besides...Looked at your damn cookies!
I bet they suck!

[Tohka picked up a piece of Origami's cookie, and threw it into her mouth, crunch it]

Tohka:
Ah...!

[The taste of Origami's cookie was so marvelous, Tohka had been brought to the another world. But, she soon regained herself]

Tohka:
...Yeah, they are not at all great, so, here! Eat!
Quick before she tried to make you eat her junk!

Origami:
No, you should try mine first.

[Devastated Shido piked up two cookies. The one was from Tohka, the other was from Origami. He ate them at once]

Shido:
...Yum!
Ha ha...
They're both good!

Tohka:
Mine must be better!
He ate it much faster!

Origami:
Incorrect. He ate mine 0.2 seconds faster than yours.

Tohka:
Ugg...excuse me?!

Tonomachi:
Hey, some strange little stranger just gave me a whole bag of cookies.
Do you want one, Shido?
I'd let her, but she's...watch and figure.

[He showed his girlfriend living in his smartphone to Shido and all other students in the classroom. Everyone couldn't react anything, speechlessly looking at Tonomachi]

---

[Shido was running in the rain. The school should be ended. The same situation the day before]

Shido:
Man, it wasn't supposed to rain the day either!

[He passed through the flyover which crossing the railway, stopped to take short rest under the tree. Nearby the tree, there was the entrance of the shrine where Shido met the tiny girl the other day. Shido happened to remember the girl, so he glanced inside the shrine]

Shido:
...Huh.

[No one playing there today, Shido think so to himself, and started to run again on the raining road to get his home. Behind the tree inside the shrine, a stuffed rabbit had watched Shido stopped at the entrance of the shrine, and left away from them]

---

Shido:
Hey, Kotori. I made it home.
I wanna go take a shower.

[Dripping wet Shido took off his shoes, entered his home. He went straight to the dressing room next to the bathroom and took off all his cloths. He opened the door of the bathroom, but there was an earlier visitor than him, taking shower. It was Tohka, and she was butt naked]

Tohka:
...

Shido:
...

Tohka:
Get out of here!
Right now!

[Tohka gave him her palm punch in the face, made him fly backward 2 to 3 meters]

---

Shido:
Kotori...what's going on...?
Why is Tohka here?!

[Shido, only wearing his trunks, inquired Kotori, resting on the sofa, sucking her usual pop-candy. She answered to the older brother with her adorable smile]

Kotori:
Hey! Welcome back home, bro!

Shido:
Oh...thanks.
...Don't change the subject!
Now, please tell me why Tohka's doing in our house?!

Kotori:
Well, I decided she should live with us.
You know, at least for the time being.

Shido:
Okay...do you mind telling me why that is?

Reine:
We have a good reason for this. Chill.

Shido:
Reine?! What are you doing here?!

[Reine, wearing pajamas, busily moving sugar cubes from its container to her coffee mug]

Reine:
Oh, sorry.
Am I using too much sugar again?

[In her coffee mug, the ramps of sugar were heaped up above its edge, even coffee didn't soak at the top of them]

Shido:
No...well, yes. But I don't really care about that.

[Shido, Kotori and Reine sat at the dining table]

Shido:
...Tohka's after care?

Reine:
That's right.
Fortunately, once she kissed you, her Spirit power was immediately in effectively sealed.
And now, there is invisible road, or we called a path, between the two of you.

Shido:
...Okay, but, what this thing about a seal?

Kotori:
I explained that to you after it happened.
When you kiss Tohka after raising her mood point, you, in particular able to absorb her Spirit power and seal them.

Shido:
So, why is it I have that kind of power?

Kotori:
I'm not sure.
I just got lucky and figured it out...with Ratatoskr's help.

Reine:
...Can I continue with my point?
Now, if the Spirit's mental condition becomes unstable, there is significant probability of the power sealed inside you returning back to her.

Shido:
Huh?

Reine:
Our research's conclusive, Tohka's number was the most stable when she is near you.
Until the special housing unit for Spirit has completed, it will be best for everyone if she stays here.

[Reine was speaking while she moved sugar cubes into her newly filled mug (Although, the content of coffee were originally intended of Shido's). Sugar piled up in her mug again]

Shido:
Right...whatever.

Kotori:
This isn't a bad thing.
Consider it a part of your training.

Shido:
You mean, I wasn't finished?
Tohka's power was already sealed, what else am I supposed to do?

Kotori:
...Did I say Tohka was the only Spirit around?
There are more out there.

Reine:
A lot more, in fact.
"Special Designation Disaster Beings", also known as Spirits, they come in all shapes and sizes just like us.

Shido:
Hmm...

Reine:
We want you continue speaking with them, Shin.
We need you to become even better at dealing with women.
The world need you become even better at dealing with women...

Shido:
Great. No pressure at all.
I still don't get why I have to live with Tohka!
...Eh.

[Just at that moment, Tohka entered into the room. She seemed heard Shido's last sentence]

Tohka:
I...I apologize, Shido...
I knew...I shouldn't be here...

Shido:
No.
You're fine.
I'm a jerk.

---

[Shido slummed her bag on his desk. He signed, then murmured]

Shido:
That weird has never gonna end...

[Kotori called out Shido from downstairs]

Kotori:
Shido! The light bulb in the bathroom!
Got change it immediately!

Shido:
Of course...
Fine! I'm on it!

[Shido brought a spare light bulb in his hand, walking in the corridor with whining]

Shido:
Why'd she have to be so mean?
Is she her commander mode...?
I normally the one to do these stuff, but still...

[He opened the door of the toilet. There was Tohka sitting]

Shido:
Sorry!
I'm so sorry!
I should have not!

Tohka:
Urggg...!
Go away far[?], you creep!

[Tohka threw a toilet paper roll to Shido. It was hit in his face. Shido fell down on the floor. Kotori appeared at the scene]

Kotori:
Someone within a lush...
Shame on Shido.

Shido:
You did on purpose...

Kotori:
I told you this was training, didn't I?
You need to unheard to face any situation calm and cool acted.

[Tohka opened the toilet door, peeked outside from the toilet room]

Shido:
Tohka! I'm sorry!
I didn't know you were in there...

Tohka:
It's fine. I forgive you.
Just...hand out to me...please?

[Tohka pointed at the paper roll she threw a moment ago]

---

[Shido was washing dishes. Koroti entered into the dining room]

Kotori:
Shido, I gotta bath already for you.
You can go ahead to wash up.

[Shido replied after contemplated the things that happened on the day]

Shido:
Nah, I'm good.
You go instead.
Oh, and, here.
You can use these if you want.

[He showed her bath salt]

Kotori:
Oh...!

Shido:
(Kotori's never given up first steps if I got these...She should know that she under estimated me...I, Shido Itsuka, haven't grown up in the same house with you without learning a thing or two!)

[Kotori was enduring, suppressing her urge to soak in the bath tab with using the newly procured bath salt. Her voice was trembling]

Kotori:
That's so nice...
But a...why don't you go ahead and use them...Think so...

[Then Tohka opened the dining room's door]

Shido:
Hm...? Hey, Tohka.
You're not taking a bath right now?

Tohka:
No. I'm standing at this door.

---

[Shido was soaked in the bath. The color of water in the bath tab was green, hence he must have used the bath salt he showed off to his younger sister]

Shido:
Maybe I was too being suspicious...
(Go figure there are Spirits besides Tohka...I wonder how many there are...And, will I be able to save them all...?)

[While he dwelt the current situation, Tohka was in dressing room next to bathroom, putting off her cloths]

Shido:
Kotori! I'm gonna kill you!

Kotori:
Not my fault. You dumb.

[Kotori rolled her glass of...orange juice or something on the rocks. Tohka rushed into the bath room. Shido hid himself into the bathtub]

Tohka:
Charge!

[Tohka jumped in to the bathtub. Then, she noticed something was in the bath. That was Shido]

Shido:
Um...Hi...?

Tohka:
Eek!

[Upset Tohka forced Shido sunk into bathtub, made him drawn]

Tohka:
You can't just pop out of me like that, you know?!

Kotori:
And...another fail.

---

Shido:
This is supposed to be my training...

[Shido murmured. He collapsed on his bed, fell asleep]

---

[Next day, lunchtime at the school]

Tohka:
Shido! It's time for the lunch!

[Tohka moved her school desk to Shido's, connected it. Then Origami did with her desk on the other side of Tohka's. Shido's desk was sandwiched by two girl's ones]

Tohka:
...Why are you here, witch?
You're not welcome!

Origami:
I was going to say the same thing.

Shido:
Can't we eat all this together?
...Hmm.

[Shido and Tohka opened the lid of their lunchboxes. Origami's sharp eye didn't miss the thing, that the contents of the lunchboxes were the same with Shido and Tohka's. Noticing Shido was covered by cold sweat all over his face]

Tohka:
Wha---what is it?
Staring you want, I'm not sharing.

Origami:
Excuse me? What is that?

Shido:
Eh...Urm, The thing is...This morning we bought a bentos from the same place.
I bumped into Tohka while she was there.

Origami:
Liar. You bought this one hundred fifty four days ago at the discount store in front of the station for 15:18.
You've been using the same container ever since.
This is not from the bento shop.

[Origami held the lid of Shido's lunchbox]

Shido:
And...how exactly do you know this...?

[Shido cast his dubious face to Origami]

Origami:
That's not really important.

Tohka:
Ah. Don't leave me out of the conversation like that.
It's rude.
Now what are you two talking about?

Tonomachi:
Hey, Shido.
My girlfriend wants to be helped her pick out cloths.
You think a French maid as best?
Shrine maiden, nurse, maybe---

Shido:
Dude, this is not a best time.
Who cares she's in maid or whatever else?!

Tonomachi:
Maid it is!
Thank then!

[Tonomachi left from the scene as fast as he came. Shido sat at the same pandemonium before Tonomachi came. Suddenly, the now familiar alarm of spatial quake echoed all over the place]

Announce:
Attention please. This is not a drill. There have been precursory sign for impending spacial quake in this vicinity. Please evacuate to the shelter immediately. I repeat---

[Origami stood up, left from the class. Teacher Okamine entered into the class]

Okamine:
Kids! Another quake alarm!
We have to evacuate immediately!
Move and listen as they say!

Tohka:
Leave?

Shido:
Yeah.

---

[Students formed lines in front of the entrance of the shelter. At the end of the line, while Tohka watching the line curiously, Shido and Reine spoke not to hear Tokha]

Shido:
You want me to leave her behind?

Reine:
Yes. Remember has been sealed, so she's the same as a normal human being.
Besides, we cannot afford for her stress level's to go up. Watching a fight might trigger that.

Shido:
That's true.

Okamine:
Shido, Tohka, Ms Murasame?! Why are you doodling back there?
If you don't hurry up evacuate, you gonna be in serious trouble and serious danger!

[Okamine hurried, ran to the three. She was obviously upset. Shido took Tohka's hand, and gave it to Okamine]

Shido:
Ms Okamine, will you watch Tohka for me?

Okamine:
Huh...? What, of course, I'll keep an eye on her...?

Tohka:
Shido...?

Shido:
Hey, Tohka.
I need to leave you here, okay?
Something just came up.
I have to go, but I'll be right back.

Tohka:
No. It's dangerous!

Shido:
I'll be fine.
Promise.

Okamine:
Shido Itsuka! Come back here!
You too, Ms Murasame!
Where do you think you are going?!

Tohka:
Oh, Shido...

---

[Fraxinus, floated in the sky]

Kotori:
Hey, you made it.
Well, for the aftermath anyway.

[They saw the front monitor of inner ship. A crater newly made by the spatial quake was showed up on the screen]

Kotori:
It's smaller than usual this time.

Kyouhei:
I'd like to say this was a good sign.
But, this is about average for Hermit.

Shido:
Hermit...?

Kotori:
The name of the Spirit's appeared this time.
She's none of being more docile than the other Spirits we've seen.

[The girl Shido met at the shrine the other day was on the monitor]

Shido:
Hold on...I've seen this girl before.

Kotori:
Where and when?!

Shido:
I met her at the shrine.
Two nights ago.

Kyouhei:
We were already tracking her by then, but we saw on destruction of main Spirit wave numbs that time.

Kotori:
So, its the same as it was for Tohka.

Minowa:
The AST has arrive!
They are commencing their attack.

[Coming from the sky, AST, including Origami, started to fire the machine gun to the Spirit girl]

Shido:
How can they fire on that little girl?!

Kotori:
What she looks like doesn't matter to AST.

Shido:
She's trying to run away.
What they're doing is wrong!

Kotori:
Don't feel sorry for, Shido.
That behavior will only make you weak.

Shido:
...

[The girl on the screen flew to dodge gunshots continuously fired by AST members]

Shido:
Kotori!

Kotori:
Hm?

Shido:
Let's do it.
I wanna go save that girl.

Kotori:
There, you're go. That's so my big brother for ya...
Listen up! Prepare for type 1 capture!

Everyone:
Right!

Kotori:
Okay...I think it's about time we go on another date.

---

Operator:
Permission to enter the building.
AST, I want you to hold your position until the target has moved.

[Hermit might have been hide into the building. AST paused firing their machine gun for a moment. The building was a multi storied department store. Shido was now also in the building]

Shido:
So, you think Hermit is really going to come here?

Kotori:
Yes. Based on the analysis, there's not doubt.
The AST probably won't able to make a move for a while.

[The room Shido was a stock room for clothing store. The room was dim lit, mannequin's face loomed like a ghost. When Shido turned his face, there was a rabbit like stuffed animal. The rabbit spoke to him]

Rabbit:
Don't tell me you're here to bully Yoshinon too!

Shido:
Whoa!

[Surprised Shido looked around carefully. There's a girl hung upside down from the roof. The doll was attached to girl's left hand, so the rabbit's voice seemed actually from the girl, Hermit. She turned herself and land to the floor]

Rabbit:
Oh~? The lucky lecher has returned for more, hasn't he?

[Shido tried to retort, but Kotori restrained him via an wireless earphone, communication tool to Fraxinus, he wore in his right ear]

Kotori:
Shido! Hold on a sec.

[In Fraxinus, three choices appeared on the main monitor at the front of its operation room. Choices were "1. Ah! It's been a while. How are you? -> Reply straight." "2. What's this lucky lecher? Me? Huh? -> Reply with lightly slapping tone." "3. I don't know. I'm only a passerby vagabond. -> Pretend a hard-boiled tough guy." Kotori directed to the clue to assist to make her decision]

Kotori:
Talk to me people, make your choice.

[The result was 2:2:2, means every options were equally valued by Fraxinus's clue]

Kawagoe:
Come on, this gotta be two!
This was straight out of dating sim.
Goes two.

Shinzaki:
Isn't that risky if you don't know the other person's personality?
Seems one was a best bet.

Mikimoto:
Hermit rarely attacks humans.
I'm on how to go with option three.

[Kotori decided]

Kotori:
Shido, go with three.

Shido:
Ar...are you sure about that...?

Kotori:
Come on. Don't you know someone who talk like that?

Shido:
Tonomachi...

[Shido also made his mind, and began his response to Hermit stood in front of him]

Shido:
Huh, excuse me. I don't know what you mean. I'm just a wondering vagabond.

[He told so in a way as if Tonomachi told to everyone, to Harmit. She, and her company rabbit stayed silent, stood still for a while, but suddenly the rabbit burst out laughter]

Rabbit:
A-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha!
A-ha! You tried to make me laugh, aren't you?
Nobody talks like that seriously!

Shido:
Hee-hee...
Well, I'm glad you liked my joke...
...So, my name, Shido.
You are?

Rabbit:
Oh! I'm sorry! How embarrassing!
I can't believe I've forgot to introduce myself to you.
My name is, Yoshinon!
Is it cute?! Is it cute?!

[So declare the rabbit, but the girl, seemed as a puppet master and giving voice to the rabbit through ventriloquism kept silence]

Shido:
Er...yeah. Sure, it's cute.
So, is that your name?
Or the name of the puppet?
Do you guys share name?

[The rabbit's mood was so good as it continuously waved its hands like dancing, until Shido commented to the name. But its mood now visibly went down, it lowered its shoulder]

Rabbit:
Ugh...

Shido:
Hmm?

[In Fraxinus, the gauge bar indicating Spirit's mood rapidly shrinking]

Kotori:
Shido! Her happiness meter just went down dramatically!
What did you say to her?!

Shido:
What...? Nothing. I swear.
All I just tried to find out while she talks through ventriloquism.
...Eh.

[The rabbit intimidatingly lowered his face, and spoke to Shido. It has eye patch on its right eye, and its left eye grew in red]

Rabbit:
I don't know, what you are talking about, Shido?
What is, ventriloquism?

Kotori:
Look, we'll figure out the cause of this later.
For now, just we're gonna making her happy again.

Shido:
...R-right, yeah.
I get your point.
So, Yoshinon is just Yoshinon.
Ha ha ha...

Rabbit:
Oh, Shido...You're one of those people whose joke's around out loud, aren't you...?
Why did you come here...?

Shido:
Oh, because...well, I know it's sudden.
But, well...will you go on a date with me?

Rabbit:
A date...?

[The rabbit and the puppet master seemed perplexed]

---

[Under ground shelter, where Tohka, Okamine and her students evacuated to]

Tohka:
Do you think it's really all the dangerous outside?

Okamine:
There's no telling how dangerous it is, but where the spatial quake, it's not where the risk.

Ai:
Seriously? Tohka doesn't know about spatial quakes?

Mai:
Maybe she's like a spoiled super rich girl?

Mei:
That's so lame.

Tohka:
Ms Okamine...Why do you think Shido would leave during such a dangerous time?

Okamine:
Honestly, I have no idea...

Tohka:
You don't...?

Ai:
...She wants to save him. She's totally brave.

Mai:
I wanna be here when I grow up.

Mei:
That's so lame...?

Okamine:
Well, I'm sure Shido would be perfectly fine.
There's really nothing to worry about, Tohka, you'll see...er?

[Okamine looked down the floor while she spoke to Tohka, but when she looked up to see Tohka, she disappeared]

---

[Outside of the department building. AST members were stood still in the rain. They were on the roof space of the nearby building]

Origami:
Permission to shoot?

Kusakabe:
Not gonna happen for a while.
We're talking about a weak little Hermit here, she has not that much of a threat yet.
Nothing with city damage and call for support troops.
The conditions with her were different from those of Princess.
...I still can't get over it.
A girl looking just like Princess transfers into your class, without any Spirit reactions detected.
Per seemingly nothing wrong with her family register either.
I keep racking my brain, trying figured it out...
But, tell you the truth, I got nothing.

[Origami silently stared to the building where Hermit hid]

---

[In the building, store room]

Rabbit:
A-ha-ha-ha!
Tell me what you think!
Am I cool? Or, am I the coolest ever?!

[Hermit and her puppet stood on the steel pipe shelf, balancing not to collapse the shelf]

Shido:
Hey, wait. That's not safe!

Rabbit:
Hey, wait. I asked if I was cool? Or the coolest?
Oh! Aargh!

[Hermit got off balance, and fell. Shido caught Hermit. When he held her in his arms, their lips accidentally touched]

Shido:
Um...
Th---! That was a...I, er...didn't mean---

[Hermit stood up like nothing had happened. A siren alarmed in Shido's right ear]

Shido:
Crap! She's gonna be pissed...!

Rabbit:
Aw...Ha ha ha!
Sorry about that, Shido!
I wasn't paying enough attention!

Kotori:
Shido! It's an emergency!

Shido:
What? An emergency?

[When Shido gave his sight to it, Tohka stood in the place, emitting crimson colored aura from allover her body]

Shido:
Tohka...?

[Tohka opened her eyes. They gleamed in red, reflecting her wrath]

Tohka:
Shido...what were you doing just then...?

Shido:
What do you mean...?

[Then, he recalled the scene he and Hermit accidentally contacted their lips]

Shido:
...

Tohka:
So, after you worried me half to death...you came here to make out with her?!
HOW DARE YOU!

[Tohka stomped the floor, fissures were made around where Tohka standing]

Kotori:
See waht I mean? You're looking at rather unstable mental condition.
Her Spirit powers are gradually flowing back into her...

Shido:
Really?! What should I do?!

Tohka:
How rude!
Why didn't you tell me that something that came up with meeting this weird looking little girl?!

Shido:
Agh...No, er, she's a...

Rabbit:
Hello there, angry lady?

Tohka:
My name's Tohka!

Rabbit:
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, Tohka.
But it seems just, though, Shido's gotten bored with you...
Based on what you were already communicated, Shido stood you up to come here, and hang out with me instead, isn't that right?
I think that's fairy conclusive...

[Tohka welled tears in her eyes. She was bearing tragic circumstance spreading before her]

Shido:
No! What are you talking about...!
Mgg...!

[Tohka pushed her hand on Shido's mouth]

Tohka:
Shido, you shut your mouth right now...!

Rabbit:
I do apologize though...Being second best is never an easy thing, is it?
It's because I'm so charming, not because of anything wrong with you, Tohka.
But, if that like, you can blame Shido for blowing you up, so he can complain with me?
I am pretty adorable...

[Tohka busted out her emotion]

Tohka:
No! Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!
This can't be happening! It can be...

Rabbit:
You can scream all you want, but you are about to hear the brutal truth!
Don't want Shido tell this poor things she's got bored anymore...

[Tohka grabbed puppet's neck, and raise it. So, it detached from Hermit]

Tohka:
Ugh...! I am too wanted! You...you don't know...
Shido is the one who said it was okay for me to stay here with him...
Why are you lying to me things so mean!
I won't take it anymore!
Say something!
Come on! Why are you talking those things!

[For a while, Hermit had only heard Tohka told to the puppet, silently. She stoop up and pulled hems of Tohka's cloths]

Tohka:
What's wrong...?
It won't talk! Make it talk!

Hermit:
I was trying to talk...
Give it back...please.

Kotori:
What are you doing there?!
The Hermit's mental condition is all over the place, too!
They need to calm down!

Shido:
Hey...so, listen, Tohka.
Could you maybe give that back to her, maybe...?

Tohka:
Ah...! Shido...?
She was right...
You really do like her better than me...

Shido:
No! It's not that at all!

[Hearing that, Hermes without the rabbit, reached her limit of capacity for uneasiness. She summoned her Angel]

Hermit:
Zadkiel!

[At once she called the name, a big rabbit-like monster appeared, crushed through the floor]

Shido:
Ah...what's that?!

[Hermes jumped to ride the monster's back, and connected her left arm to its back]

Zadkiel:
Wooooh!

[Zadkiel exhaled cold breath. It froze the room]

Kotori:
Oh no! She's releasing her Angel!
This is bad! You have to get out of there right now!

Shido:
Her Angel?

Kotori:
Did you forget Tohka's Sandalphon?!

[The air was so cold, it broke all the windows the room had. Rain penetrated into the building. Because of its coldness, raindrops tuned into sharp knives, attacked Shido and Tohka]

Shido:
Watch out!

[Shido pulled Tohka to move her to the safer place. Zadkiel broke out from the building with Hermit. Right after they were out, AST commenced to shoot down them]

Hermit:
Ah!

[Zadkiel stared back to AST, when it started glowing it's eye, the chilled air storm busted out, and they disappeared into the fog]

Origami:
...We lost her.

Kusakabe:
Everyone, return the base.

[Before Origami left from the site, she noticed something laid on the ground]

Shido:
You okay, Tohka? You are not hurt?

[In the building, Shido and Tohka were remained on the site]

Tohka:
I'm all right.
...Will you just get away?

Shido:
But...why?

Tohka:
Don't touch me!

[Tohka pushed back Shido. But then, Shido pressed his right hand on his left arm, seems he got injury on left arm. Tohka showed a little of her concern, but promptly erased that expression, tuned back from Shido]

Tohka:
...You like that little girl better than me!
I know you do! Admit it!

Shido:
Wait...what?

[Kotori was groaning in Fraxinus deck]

Kotori:
That's perfect.
Looks like someone's got trouble in paradise...
