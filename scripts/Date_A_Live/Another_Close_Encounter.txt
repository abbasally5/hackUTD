  [The space shuttle was waiting to launch. Shido and Ririko were speaking at the launching site. Seemingly, it was a situation in the game. Ririko wore space suit so she looked one of the clue members of the space craft]

Ririko:
I don't wanna go to sea yet.
Before the shuttle launch, and I leave this glove, there's something I think I'd like to know about me...

Shido:
What is it, Ririko?

Ririko:
Everyone wanted you to get really good at flirt on Spirits, so you can make them fall in love with you.
I mean, supposed to get better by proxy on me.

Shido:
Yeah, that's the plan.
What about it?

Ririko:
I want, just, I'm afraid...I'm afraid, I might've been falling in love with you...

Shido:
...

Ririko:
It's true, we've known each other forever, you always treated me like little sister...
But, do you think you can start looking at me as an woman instead?

[Choices of yours were displayed on the screen. They were: 1. Of course / 2. I can't do that / 3. Anyway, but I'm not interested in women. ---Shido chose option 1]

Ririko:
This is the best day ever!

[Happily smiling Ririko jumped at and hugged Shido]

Ririko:
Don't you wait about a thing. I'm leaving and waiting from Jupiter. It's like super faraway! Until next time...big brother!

[Ririko tried to kiss to Shido, but the helmet of the space suit she wearing blocked doing it. Anyway, end credit role flew, and the message "CG - mode completed" appeared]

Shido:
AAALLRIGHT!
Ha ha...hah...I rock...

[Real world Shido clenched his fist in triumphant. It looked the time's around early morning]

--- OP ---

Narration:
Spirits, mysterious girls appearing from another world.
Should we fight against their pure strength with the weapons of war?
Or, should we address them with love?
Now, mankind has faced this ultimate decision...

---

[A girl was running through devastated residential area. The area completely burned out, as if a war erupted in there]

Girl:
Dad! Mom!

[She turned the corner, then white haired girl found her parents in middle of the street. Houses behind them were in red flame]

Man:
Origami...!

[She gave back her smile to them. But then, bright light in the sky burst. The light devoured her parents, herself, whole world. Origami woke up]

Origami:
Ah...!

[She didn't wear any cloths. Sweat covered all of her body. She panted heavy breath. It was her nightmare]

---

Reine:
Shin...

Shido:
Yes, Reina...?

[Reine held Shido's head wither both hands. They stood alone in the ill-lighted room. She left her hands after she fingered around Shido's ear. Expectant Shido waited closing his eyes, making up his lip. But that wasn't Reine tried to do. Instead, Shido felt something remained in his right ear]

Kotori:
Are you daydreaming again?
It's time to implement stage two of your training.
So, you better be ready.

Shido:
Huh?

---

[Shido stood at the passage just out of the class 2-4. His teacher, Okamine stood near Shido, too, facing Shido]

Shido:
(This...is training...?)

Okamine:
Good afternoon, Shido?
Is there I can help you with?

Shido:
No...Thank you.

Kotori:
What are you think you're doing?!

[Kotori spoke to Shido through the earphone Reine set up beforehand]

Kotori:
Quit waste everyone's time.
Hurry up, and make her falling love with you!

Shido:
Do I have to?

[In the dark physics preparation room, Shido's voice could heard from the speaker. Kotori and Reine sat at the operation console Reine maintain]

Kotori:
You have to know by now that seducing a Spirit is easier said than done.
If you can't even make a human love you, how do you expect convince a Spirit, too?

Shido:
You asking a wrong guy!
I'm not a stud!

[He whispered to his microphone, hidden from Okamine]

Kotori:
We know.
Start with you compliments and see what happens?
We're hear for response, we'll give you the instruction.

Okamine:
Er...Is there something in your mind?

[Okamine didn't hear Kotori's voice]

Shido:
Mm...Ms. Okamine?
That's a...cute outfit you wearing.

Okamine:
What?
Goodness, you really think so?
Oh my, that was very flattering of you.

[She made her cheek pink. Looked she don't hate what Shido said]

Shido:
Oh yes!
It really does look good!

[Shido stuck up his right thumb]

Shido:
So, does your hair, and...those, sexy glasses.
Perfect shoes...Perfect stockings...Perfect attendance book, heh...

Okamine:
Shido, is everything alright...?

Kotori:
You got way too into that!
Stop it creepy!

Okamine:
I'm kind of busy right now.
So, see you in class?

Shido:
Er...Ugh, er...

Reine:
This can be fixed.
Alright. Listen closely and do exactly as I say.

Shido:
(Sigh) Here's the truth.
I love home room.
I look forward to going toward everyday.

Okamine:
Oh, that's enough I stay here!
I'm so glad you like it!

Shido:
The main reason because I get to see you all the time...
I can't help it!
I think I'm falling love with you.

Okamine:
Oh! Come on, don't say such sweet things!
Honestly, I'm flattered, but students and teachers can't love each other!

[Looked she actually was very flattered. Shido pushed more]

Shido:
No! Don't tell me that!
I'm dead serious...I want to marry you!

[Okamine opened her eyes wide]

Okamine:
You want to MARRY ME~?!

[Pink aura emerged from Okamine's entire body. She lost her senses, grabbed Shido's arms]

Okamine:
Eek! Is it true? Once you old enough to get married I'll be thirty is that OK? You need to meet my parents. Daddy's get so protective and I think he'll like you, he might've even given us the house, once you graduate and get decent job, I can retire and start having babies! Then you---

Reine:
Huh, we underestimated the game easy as that twenty-nine year old single woman.
They make for easy targets...

Kotori:
It'll be annoying if she get's more involved than necessary...
Hey, Shido. We're done here, so make her some excuse, and get out of there pronto.

Shido:
I'm really sorry, Ms. Okamine, I don't think I tried for that hard work commitment!

[Shido ran away by mach speed from Okamine. But Okamine was still in her dream]

Okamine:
You can start out in an apartment and work away, or twin three bedroom condo with a backyard...and don't worry about wedding ready, I've been saving about fifteen years, you can take care the didgy, I'll do the risk! ...

Kotori:
You found a market with older woman.
Good to know.

Shido:
Shut up!
How can you be so calm!
I'm about---Gwah!

[Shido collided other girl student while he was running. Both fell down to the floor]

Shido:
Oh, man...Sorry about that.
...!

[The girl laid on her back. Her leg was open, forming M letter, so her panty was frankly revealed. Nevertheless, the girl quickly regained her proper posture. It was Origami]

Origami:
I'm alright.

Kotori:
Perfect timing!
Why do you practice with her, too!

Shido:
Huh?!

Kotori:
She's around the same age as you, so it'll be natural.
Plus, even she's not a Spirit, she's a member of AST.
Doesn't seem like the type of spreading rumor either.

Shido:
But, rumors about what?

Kotori:
Just talk to her already!

[Kotori yelled at the monitor that showed the corridor where Shido and Origami standing]

Shido:
Urgh...
Er...Hey, Tobiichi.
Those cloths are nice on you.
Where did you get them?

Origami:
It's a uniform.

Kotori:
Come on, Idiot!
You have to put in more effort on that!
Again! With more feeling!

Shido:
(I don't know how...)

Reine:
Shin, follow my lead.

Shido:
To be honest, I already know.
I've known all about you for a quite a while now.

Origami:
I'm aware that.

Shido:
Oh, that's so.
Nice, I'm really glad we're in the same class this semester.
In fact, I'm watching you all the time during the class when you study.

Origami:
Yes. Likewise.

Shido:
Is that so? How random.
I also like sneaking into your locker after school, to sniff your gym cloths.

Origami:
Same here.

Shido:
Okay...I wasn't expecting that.

Origami:
And, why not?

Shido:
Who knew we had so much in common, so do you wanna go out with me?

[Origami stalled. She didn't respond any reaction. Shido spoke to the microphone with whisper]

Shido:
Okay, I'm at a nowhere. Don't you think this is a little sudden?

Origami:
...I wouldn't mind.

Shido:
Er...?!

Origami:
I wouldn't mind that going out with you.

Shido:
Oh...cool! So, you, wanna, like, go somewhere with me? Something like that?

Origami:
Like a movie?
I'm sorry, I assumed that you are asking me out on a date, Shido?
Am I wrong?

Shido:
No, not at all.
That's exactly what I meant.

Origami:
Good.

Shido:
(Getting at...What's exactly what I meant...? How come Reine didn't bay on me out of that one? I'm screwed!)

[Origami handed Shido something]

Shido:
Er...what's this?

[That was a photograph. A portrait of Origami. On the photo, there was a autograph written by Origami herself]

Origami:
For you.
Because you like my uniform.

Shido:
Huh?

[Then, emergency siren was blown]

Announce:
Your attention please. This is not a drill. They have been precursory signs for impending spatial quakes in this vicinity. Please evacuate to near shelter immediately. I repeat...

Origami:
Something's just came up.
Bye.

Shido:
Hey, wait a second!
Where are you going?!

[Origami dashed away from Shido]

Kotori:
A spatial quake is about to happen.
I've left to the Fraxinus for now.

Shido:
Do you think it's a Spirit?

Kotori:
Yes, "Princess."
Should be appearing your exact location.
...Raizen high school.

---

[At the base of the ground force, girls wearing equipment, preparing to encounter the Spirit. All the advertisements and signboards in the city now changed their displaying contents, now all showed warnings of the spatial quake. Walls appeared from under the ground, completely surrounded the school. Under the ground, AST's bullet train stopped for Origami, bring her to its base]

Kusakabe:
They are on their way now!

Origami:
Roger that.

[Origami changed her wear to AST's mech-squad's armor, attacked her back to mechanical wings]

Kusakabe:
Here we go!
The quake has started!

[The space above the high school began deforming, contracting, then burst, swallowed all surrounding material into it. After the spatial quake, half the facility of the school disappeared, as if it was scooped with very large spoon. AST squads stood ready in the woods behind the school premise, waiting for something]

Kotori:
Consider yourself lucky, Shido.
the AST CR units are deadly. They weren't build for indoor combat.

[Now, Kotori sat on the chair of the commander of Fraxinus]

Kotori:
As long as Princess remain inside the school, the AST will have a hard time interfering whatever you do.

Shido:
With what I do?

[Shido stood at the entrance gate of the devastated school]

Kotori:
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

Shido:
...

Kotori:
Relax. This is what you've been training for the past week.
You are as ready as you've ever been.
You wanna save the Spirit, or am I wrong?

[Shido recalled the face of Princess, when she turned to look at him]

Shido:
(She's right. I don't ever wanna see that sad look on her face again...)
Kotori, you're absolutely sure I can do this?

Kotori:
Yes. Just believe in yourself.
You're opposite, and different they dealing on the Spirits, on more intimate method.
Remember that.

Shido:
Be friendly with them, use sweet talk, and make them fall for me.

[Shido stepped forward to the school building]

Kotori:
You're gonna do just fine.
Besides, the Fraxinus has got your back...
We, hold the pride of Ratatoskr, are ready to response to any circumstance!

[Kotori began introduce her clue members. First, it's a tough looking man with a clue cut. He had white mohawk hair)

Kotori:
With five marries, and five divorces under his belt...
The love master!
"Bad Marriage" Kawagoe!

Kawagoe:
Mm~, 'key there!

[Kawagoe gave throwing kiss with his two fingers. His subtitle was "Too early to get boring period". Next man, he looked in early old age, having progressively rearing hair]

Kotori:
It's the working girl's favorite in midnight client...
"CEO" Mikimoto!

Mikimoto:
Who doesn't love love.

[Mikimoto sipped a glass of whiskey. His subtitle was "A president," or CEO. Third, she had a black long hair, sitting with her head down]

Kotori:
Go after this lady's fell in? You'll regret it!
Don't you dare pissed her off!
"Neil Nocker" Shinzaki!

[Her subtitle was "Doll made of straw." She gave a gleaming glance with holding a doll made of straw. Fourth, the man looked usual guy, wearing square shaped, red colored rim glasses]

Kotori:
The man has no fewer than hundred wives!
"Dimension Breaker" Nakatsugawa!

Nakatsugawa:
A-OK!

[He formed a circle using his thumb and index fingers. His subtle was "The man who surpasses the dimension." Fifth and last, she also looked usual woman, having waving chestnut hair, seeing a picture]

Kotori:
Lastly, a woman whose love is so strong...
Not even this, leave a straining order can't keep her away!
"Deep love" Minowa!

Minowa:
...Huh?

[She's too focused on looking a picture she's holding, hardly noticed she got introduced by Kotori. Her subtitle was "Under a probation order."]

Shido:
Fantastic. I'm aligned on perverts...

Reine:
Don't worry, everyone's gotta one they do.

Kotori:
And, that's only a portion of the troops on our side.
Just stay calm.
Even if you died, once you can always stat the new game without a penalty.

Shido:
I'm pretty sure this isn't a game...

Kotori:
Have faith in your little sister...?
Now getting there, flirt!

---

[Shido walked in corridor, arrived at the front of the class room where Princess was. He peeked the room, Princess stood still, alone, seeing outside of the class, the sunset. She turned to Shido. Shido made a gasp. Princess raised her left hand, then slashed down. She blasted a shock wave toward Shido, the impact blew away the building's wall]

Shido:
Whoa!
(Coughing)...Wait just a minute!
I don't wanna fight with you!
Please! Listen to me!

[Shido tried to approach, close a distance, but Princess gave another blast to him]

"Princess":
What's your name?
And, why are you following me?

Shido:
Because...

Kotori:
Don't answer yet!

[Through an earphone which infixed in Shido's right ear. On Fraxinus, busily analyzed the situation]

Minowa:
There has been a change in a mental statement of the Spirit.

Kawagoe:
Reaction analysis complete!

Nakatsugawa:
Displaying choices on screen!

["1. My name is Shido Itsuka, I've come to save you.", "2. I'm just a passerby! Please, don't kill me!", "3. Before asking someone's name, you should give your own." Choices were read out by synthesized voice of Shido]

Kotori:
Well, there they are.
Now, everyone get to work!

[Five clue members, and Reine chose their choice. one people chose choice 1, two people 2, three people chose 3]

Kotori:
No surprise here.
You guys went to the same one I do.

Mikimoto:
The fist choice is a traditional, true classic.
But it doesn't apply a situation.
And it does sound a little cliché.

Kyohei:
Option 2 is also out.
I fear escapes if he can continue the conversation.
Number 3, it is.

Kotori:
I agree. In this case, 3 makes the most sense.
So let him leave he'll get know her better.
'Key, Shido, make up your mind!
Now, listen closely and repeat after me.

"Princess":
What are you waiting for?
Answer the question already!

[Return to the school, irritated Princess questioned Shido]

Shido:
Mmm...

[Shido and Kotori read out the answer in unison]

Shido & Kotori:
Before asking for someone's name...

Shido:
You should really give your own first!

[Another blast attacked Shido. The blast shuttered most of the glass pane of the building story's window. Shido flew to the wall, but looked not so heavily injured]

Kotori:
Well, that was unexpected.

Shido:
What expected my ass!
I could've been dead!

[Shido yelled at the microphone. Princess approached him, making purple glittering electronic ball on her left hand]

"Princess":
No more time for game.
If you do not answer me, I can only assume you are my enemy.

Shido:
My name is Shido Itsuka! I am student of this school! I've got no reason to bite you!

[Shido promptly responded. Princess squinted her eyes]

"Princess":
Hold on...
This isn't the first time we crossed path.

Shido:
No, it's not.
I saw you on the Tenth on the city.

"Princess":
That's right. I thought so...
I remember you saying something on to me that day...

[Princess quit holding energy ball on her hand. Instead, she grabbed Shido's head, and continued questioning on him]

"Princess":
You said, you didn't come to kill me, and that you couldn't kill anyone.
And, now I know that was a lie.
Why else you'd be here?

[Princess stared Shido]

Shido:
Your face...
How come you always look so sad...?

"Princess":
...

Shido:
I'm not trying anything.
And, it's true. I really have no reason to kill you.

"Princess":
Quit lying!
Every single human is out to get me.
I haven't on the thing to them, yet they want me dead!

Shido:
I swear that's not true!

"Princess":
You never answered me...
You claimed to have no intention of killing anyone.
If that's really the truth, tell me why it is you came here?

[Then, another choices appeared on Fraxinus's console. They were "1. Of course, to meet you.", "2. That's not your problem.", "3. It's coincidence. Just happened."]

Kotori:
Oh, first reaction is all that pretty.
This time, option one's probably the safest choice.

[Shido read out option one]

Shido:
I, I wanted to meet you.

"Princess":
To meet me...?
Why would you want that?

[Another choices appeared. "1. I'm interested in you", "2. To have love with you", "3. I'd like ask you about a thing"]

Kotori:
...Do you guys have any ideas?

Kawagoe:
I'll recommend straight forward approach.

Mikimoto:
Yeah. Be clear and direct.
This girl's way too dense to get anything settled.

Kotori:
That's a good point.
We've already waste the enough time answering all these questions...

[So, Shido read out the choice 1]

Shido:
Er, it's simple. I came here because I'm interested in you.

[The "Pincess" sliced down the wall Shido leaned, just above Shido's head]

"Princess":
I'm in no mood to joke around.

Shido:
I know...And, neither am I.
...You wanna know the truth?
I came here so I can talk to you.

["I won't let you make such a sad face." Shido's emotion appeared on the screen]

Shido:
I don't even care what we talk about.
...Not one bit.
You can ignore me if you want to.

["I won't let you make such a sad face."]

Shido:
But, know this.
I'm not like every other human.

["I won't let you make such a sad face."]

Shido:
Because...

Kotori:
Stop it! Wait her signal!

Shido:
Because I'll never let you down!

["Bang." The sound of gun fire resonated in the Spirit's mind. She turned herself back to Shido]

"Princess":
...You said your name was Shido, right?
And, when you said you were interested in me, were you being serious?

Shido:
Yes, I was.

[She turned herself to Shido again, now they were facing each other]

"Princess":
But, like, serious-serious?

Shido:
Serious-serious.

"Princess":
...One hundred percent serious-serious?!

Shido:
One thousand percent serious-serious!

"Princess":
Ummm...!
Jerk! Who was seriously fall for your amateur tricks!
Stupid dummy!

Shido:
But, that was from the heart!

"Princess":
Then, again, this is different.
I don't know what your intentions are...
But, you are the only human I've ever had normal conversation with.
You know this world, which could serve me well.
It might just work...Yup, it's settled.
This should prove your usefulness.

Shido:
Er...Thanks, I guess.
Oh...oh yeah, what was your name again?

"Princess":
My name...?
I've never had any one of those...
But I suppose I will need one if I want to find out why humans so awful...
Okay. Why don't you come up with something you can call me?

Kotori:
Well, she's certainly putting the Fraxinus to work, isn't she?
Alright, clue! We need to pick of her name on the double!

[Every clue on the Fraxinus wrote down names, which they thought best. But, Reine raise a concern]

Reine:
The few suggestions we have aren't gonna be enough.
They want to call in troops from around the world.

Kotori:
One step ahead of you.

[Kotori touched console. Then, smartphones all over the world which installed the game "Fall in love: My little Seed" reacted. Tonomachi, now evacuated in underground shelter noticed a message]

Tonomachi:
Huh? Gosh, now what does she want?

[On the game display there were a message that read "Please, I need a name for my new sister! (Heart)"]

Tonomachi:
Heh heh heh...
Your wish is my command.
My digital darling!

Ai:
Isn't that "that fool" Tonomachi?

Mai:
He's probably sending a dirty text to Shido.

Mei:
That's so lame...

["Tome" was the name Tonomachi gave to her, or system. In Fraxinus, dozen of names were printed on screen. Among them. Also, names that Fraxinus's clue chose showed up on the monitor. The first shown name was "Misako"]

Kotori:
Come on!
Man! We're not naming Princess after one of your ex-wife?!

[The suggestion was made by Kawagoe. Next, the screen showed "麗鐘"]

Kotori:
I don't even know how to pronounce that gibberish!

Mikimoto:
It's "Clarabelle."

Kotori:
The 1920's are over!
Can anyone here think of half way decent girl's name?!
How about, "Tome!"

Shido:
"Tome"...
"Tome" sounds kind a name, right?

[Shido couldn't hide his suppressing smirk. Princess's happiness meter, it was showed on the monitor in Fraxinus, had began tumbling down. She attacked Shido with her dark energy ball]

Kotori:
Wow...She's mad...
Is "Tome" that bad?

[Around Shido, there were countless small hole, such like made by gun shot, around Shido. Shido froze as if he shot by shotgun at point-blank range]

"Princess":
Don't think I can't tell what a human is attempting to make fun of me.
You got it?

Shido:
Okay! Just a minute!
(Apologies to anyone named "Tome." but, I don't think I know a single girl would like that name...Think, Shido! There has to be a perfect name for her...!)

["The comment is just Shido thinking in that way, and it does not reflect any idea of the production committee." The caption explaining the stance of the product team of Date A Live flew on the screen]

Shido:
How about..."Tohka?"

"Princess":
Tohka...yeah, I guess that'll work.

[Shido wrote down her name on the chalkboard]

"Princess":
Is this how it's written?

Shido:
It is.

["Tohka," Princess also wrote down her new name, or scribble it using purple electricity she made on the tip of her index finger, on the chalkboard]

Tohka:
Huh...Tohka.
Now, I have a name.
I think I like it!
Thank you.

Shido:
Yeah...
Yeah, you're welcome.

[Tohka smiled to Shido. Shido stared her smile, thinking]

Shido:
"Tohka" just means "10th" as on a day we met...But, I hates not like she'll ever need to know that!

Kotori:
Get down, and take cover!

[Suddenly, a rain of gun fire fell on Tohka and Shido. From the sky, AST squad delivered a volley of fire]

AST member:
Sure this is OK, captain?

Kusakabe:
We have permission to smoke them out.
Once we've done our job, the enforcement can take care of the rest.

[Tohka's force field hadn't allowed the bullet to reach them, so she and Shido were undamaged]

Shido:
Are you alright?

Tohka:
Hurry up and leave while you still can.
I'd love to continue our talk, but the last thing I want is for you to get hurt.
Don't just stand there. Get going before they open fire.

Shido:
...I'm staying right here!

[Shido sat on the ground, cross-legged]

Shido:
Sit down.
I wanna talk some more.
You wanna know about this world, don't you?
So, have a seat.
Pretend they are not even here.

Tohka:
...Alright.

[She sat near Shido, face-to-face. She's on her knee. AST squad fired a volley again. The noise of gunfire was intense so we can't hear what Shido and Tohka speaking under the force field. But, looks they were chatting merrily each other]

Shido:
I'm curious...If you are not a human, what exactly are you?

Tohka:
I don't know...I don't remember how long ago was I appeared out of nowhere...
That's all I can recall...most of my oldest memories are fuzzy and distorted.
And, honestly I don't know what kind of being I am...

Shido:
That's awful.

Tohka:
I suppose so.
My birth was sudden, and inexplicable.
And, mech-mech-squad was already in the air when I awoke.

Shido:
Mech-mech...huh?

Tohka:
Them.
The noisy flying people...

[Tohka addressed it was AST squad, who were continuing firing their guns]

Shido:
Interesting...

[Then, an earphone Shido wore rang a bell in Shido's ear]

Kotori:
Here's your chance!
Her happiness meter is over seventy!
Now, it is good a time as any to make a move.

Shido:
What do you want me to do?

Kotori:
For starter as you, ask her on a date?

Shido:
...?!

Tohka:
...? What's wrong?

Shido:
Eh, nothing I'm just itchy.

Tohka:
You've been muttering under your breath for a while...
Are you hiding something from me?

[Shido lost his composure. He tried patching up]

Shido:
No, no! You over reacting!

Tohka:
Then, tell me what you were saying just now?

[Tohka generated, held purple electron ball at the top of her index finger, readied to attack Shido]

Shido:
I...forgot?

Kotori:
Come on...cut it the chaste, and ask her out...?
Ask her out! Ask her out!

[All crew members on Fraxinus followed Kotori's repetition]

Fraxinus crew:
Ask her out! Ask her out! Ask her out! Ask her out! ...

Shido:
Alright already!
Shut up, I'll do it!
...Tohka, I wanna ask you something.
Er, but it's...well, it's kind of abrupt.
But...will you go on a date with me?

[In the sky, among AST, Origami continue firing her machine gun. Captain Kusakabe approached to talk to Origami]

Kusakabe:
Have you receive any new orders, Origami?

Origami:
That's negative, ma'am.

Kusakabe:
Even after all this...?

[Then, gun shot broke a part of the building. It made AST members could see Princess was talking with someone, in the rain of gun bullets]

Kusakabe:
Someone was down there with a Spirit!
Hold on! Hold your fire!

[At the time the gun smoke flew away around Princess and her company, Origami immediately recognized who was with the Spirit. She recognized Shido was down there. She contorted her face, activated her light sword, and she nose-dived to attack Tohka]

Kusakabe:
Origami?!
Get back here!

[Down on the building, Tohka and Shido were continuing their conversation]

Tohka:
What exactly was a Date?

Shido:
Er...you don't know?

Kotori:
Look out!
The AST!

[As Kotori warned Shido, Origami, falling from sky, slashed Tohka]

Tohka:
How, rude!

[Tohka blocked Origami's sword by her energy field. Origami landed in front of Shido]

Shido:
What...Tobiichi?!

Origami:
Stand back!

Tohka:
[Well up?], is it you again?

Origami:
He's not your shield!
You scum!

[In Origami's view, She thought Shido was captured by the Spirit]

Shido:
! You've got it all wrong!

Kusakabe:
What are you doing, Origami!
We don't have orders to breaking in on foot!

Tohka:
Sandalphon!

[Tohka stomped the ground by her heel. Then, magic circle was drawn on the ground, and huge scabbard, taller than Tohka, wide as like door, materialized. Seeing it Kotori ordered Shido]

Kotori:
Shido! Get out of there now!
The Fraxinus will come retrieve you.

Shido:
And leave her here alone?

[Tohka pulled out a broad sword, swung. A great impact stormed Origami and Shido]

Tohka:
Um!

[Origami tried to block the shock wave, but she pushed back. Shido was dragged in]

Origami, Shido:
Aaargh!

[The building's wall collapsed, dust smoke rose from the building]

---

Kusakabe:
You could've been killed out there!
Do you realize just how lucky you are she became lost?!

[Captain's reprimand to Origami didn't drown out from noise of the helicopter which about to convey injured Origami's body. The sky had already turned into night]

Kusakabe:
Exercise some restraint, OK?
You're valuable member of AST, so stop acting like it!

[Kusakabe yelled to Origami, who now pulled up by helicopter and leaving from the site]

---

Shido:
(I was there when everything happened.
...Still, the massive destruction just doesn't seem real.
But, yesterday was real...)

[Next morning, Shido stood at the school building alone. School was closed due to destruction on last day. Shido stared the piece that once the part of blackboard hung on the class room. A scribbled name "Tohka" remained on it. Shido found the piece, and picked up it]

Shido:
(It wasn't a dream at all...)

Tohka:
Shido!

Shido:
(That's right. I really did talk with Tohka, and gave her a name...Crazy)

[Shido felt he heard Tohka's voice]

Tohka:
Hey, Shido...
Quit ignoring me!

[It's not he imagined. Shido tuned back, and he looked Tohka standing on a pile of crumbled concrete blocks]

Shido:
Tohka!

Tohka:
You just now noticed me?
Well, you are so dumb!

Shido:
But, how did you wind-up back over here?
The spatial alarm didn't even go on!

Tohka:
Why would it?
You were the one who invited me back!
For a...date, I think?

Shido:
Er...

Tohka:
Well, guess what?
It's time for that date!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

Shido:
Okay! Just bring it down a bit!
And, you should probably get out that first...
Do you mind changing?

[Shido pointed at Tohka's costume, a purple armor she wearing]

Tohka:
Right now?
You want me to undress in broad daylight?

Shido:
No! Oh, that's not it!
Er...Ah!
Let me show one example.

[Shido showed a photograph to her. Origami was displayed, and she was wearing school uniform]

Tohka:
You think this outfit is better...?
...Why are you walking around with this picture?

Shido:
Quit asking question.
Just change already.

Tohka:
Very well...

[Tohka split the portrait of Origami in two, and dumped it. Then she raised her right hand, and instantly, she changed her cloths into the same school uniform Origami wore. Her dark purple straight hair tied up with red ribbon, the same kind of string she tied around her neck]

Tohka:
How does this look?

Shido:
Um...good.

Tohka:
Glad you think so.
Time for a date!

--- END ---

Shido:
Hey! Stop walking so fast!

Tohka:
You're too slow, Shido!
Date time, date time!

Shido:
Oh, sure!
Just announced to the entire world!

[They were stepping aside the road which was packed by running ground force's vehicles]
