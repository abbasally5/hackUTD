  (ALO, Jötunheimr. Kirito and his party stood in the front of the gigantic gate of Thrymheim)

Kirito:
...? What's wrong, Yui?

Yui:
I have a feeling there's a lot more ex-take here than we think. This will require some explaining, but all VRMMOs originated the Seed program, there's a different between them and ALfheim Online. You see, a stripped down version of the Cardinal System from the other VRMMOs, but the one that operates this game, is a copy of full spec version, that of late Sword Art Online.

Kirito:
Full spec version...?

Yui:
The original Cardinal System had a feature which could automatically generate quests. It would mod onto the net, and search for various legends and folklore from around the world. Then, it would take the stories that found, adapt the data, and used it to generate infinite number of quests.

Kirito:
How about this quest, then? Is it auto-generated by Cardinal too?

Yui:
After seeing how that NPC was acting just now, I have a feeling it is. If that is the case here, and no matter what you do, this quest will end the same way the myth's pass.
Just now, I run a quick check on my archives. According to my data, in taking into account the north mythology ALO with based on, this quest must end in a final war event...the Frost Giants from Jötunheimr and Niflheimr aren't the only ones who want to attack Alne. Below Niflhelm is firely realm called Muspelheim, where the Frame Giants live. According to the myth, they will attack to the World Tree, and burned it to the ground...

Leafa:
Ragnarok...the Twilight of the Gods...!
Uh-oh...I don't buy it. I can't believe this game system would destroy it's own map on purpose. It's gotta be a mistake!

(Yui shook her head)
Yui:
I'm sorry, but there's no mistake about it. the Cardinal System has the authority to destroy it's maps if it wants. I know this because the original Cardinal System's last task...was destroying Aincrad, the floating castle of Sword Art Online.

Leafa:
No way...

Lisbeth:
There goes my black-smith shop...

Pina:
Caaw...

Klein:
There go my chances for ever meet in my soul mate...

Sinon:
Even if this Ragnarok thing happen, then it all deletes, can't the server be brought back the way it was from one of the backups it's made?

(Yui shook her head again)
Yui:
This system has an auto-backup feature but those files won't help. It only saves player data, not field data. So, you can't restore everything.

Everyone:
Hmm...

Klein:
Oh, I got it!

Everyone:
Hm?

(Klein brought his menu, operated several windows. Then, grabbed his head)
Klein:
...I don't got it.

Lisbeth:
...You can say that again.

Klein:
Stop razzing me, I was trying to call a GM to say if he knew about this, in happening now.
...It's after hours. Support closed.

Kirito:
That figures. It's Sunday morning, just before new years.

Leafa:
Kazuto...we're running out of time.

(Leafa showed the Emerald amulet. The jewel tainted with black stain)

Kirito:
Yeah...Let's hurry and get to the last level.

Everyone:
Right!



(Inner the castle. Kirito and his party fought against two large size Minotaur-like monsters)

Monster A:
Ooooww...

(While the gold color skinned monster fought in front with Kirito's party, at the back end of the room, the black skinned one rested in sitting position, prayed like Buddhist monk)

Kirito:
Ooohhh!

Leafa:
Ahhh!

(Kirito and Leafa slashed gold one, but they couldn't give much damage)

Kirito:
...Damn it.

(While gold one faced to his opponents, the black one emitted green light so to recuperate his HP. Sinon tried to interrupt it's attempt, and snipe the black monster. But the gold one obstructed her attack, catching her arrow by it's right hand)

Monster A:
Grroooww...!

Leafa:
This isn't looking good! A gold one's tough. Nothing we do slowing him down!

Kirito:
Yeah...

Klein:
It sucks! If we only had a mage who can cast attack spells in our party!

Lisbeth:
Urg...That's hilarious comment coming from you... It wouldn't help anyway, because the dude in the back is high-resistance to magic'll just move up. Could this get any tougher...?

Yui:
Shock wave attack coming up on three! ...Two ...One...!

(The golden Minotaur vertically struck down his ax to the ground. Shock wave ran across the room. Most of the party members were embroiled in the wave. Their HP bar went into red. Asuna cast Healing Magic)

Asuna:
...Þú fylla heilagr austr, brott svalr bani!
Kirito! I've only got about two and half minutes before I'm out of MP!

Kirito:
'Kay!

Leafa:
Kazuto! More than two third of this medallion's gone dark! If we die now, we won't have time to start over from the save point!

Kirito:
Thanks! good to know...!

(While receiving from the golden monster's brow by his two swords, Kirito managed to respond to them)

Kirito:
Ugg...Hey guys, there's one thing we haven't tried to yet. If you use sword skills with magic, we might do some damage to this gold bastard! It'll leave you wide open window, Nnah! ...It's do a die time! So, what you say we focus on out attack, wipe him out!

Klein:
Hell yeah! Just say the word, here's as request![?]

(Klein, Leafa, Lisbeth, and Silica were ready to next attack)

Kirito:
Silica! Time for your bubble spell!

Silica:
Right!

Kirito:
Ready, and...Hit it!

Silica:
Pina! Bubble Blind Attack!

Pina:
Aaahhaa!

(Pina, little dragon tamed by Silica, breathed out countless bubbles to the gold Minotaur. The bubbles popped around monster's head, causing it became a dizzying state)

Kirito:
Go!

(They all activated their magic-sword skills. Klein's was fire. Leafa's wind. Lisbeth's thunder. Silica's water. Sinon's ice. Kirito used fire, with several combo of his one hand sword skills)

Klein:
Kirito! ung...! We locked up!

(Klein and others couldn't move due to the Post-Motion. The golden Minotaur, it's HP was now below half, approaching Kirito, who also looked to suffer Post-Motion effect)

Kirito:
This is it!

(At once his right hand weapon ceased it's magical effect, Kirito activated his magic-sword skill again for his left weapon. This time, he got an ice effect on his left sword. He cut deep into the gold monster's torso horizontally, then vertically. When ice effect vanished, Kirito activated fire effect to his right hand sword again. At that time, everyone suffered from post-motion delay regained their mobility, and rushed again to the monster)

Kirito:
Raar!

(Kirito's final attack was a thrust by fire enchanted weapon in his left hand. The thrust went through minotaur's body, fire burst exploded on it's back. Everyone caught up again the post-motion paralysis, watching the Gold minotaur's HP bar. It acutely plunged, but not enough to reach zero. The monster smirked, raised his ax to smash up Kirito)

Asuna:
Yaahhh!

(Asuna interrupted the monster. It looked like her rapier has magic effect of divine. The healer's attack damage should be little but enough to administer the coup de grace to the gold monster. The remaining black minotaur was driven to his wit's end)

Klein:
Oh~? We killed your pal. Too bad, for you.

(The party minced up black minotaur. After the black one vanished into the air, "Congratulations!!" banner flipped, and fanfare echoed in the dungeon room)

Everyone:
Ya-hoo!

Klein:
...Okay, what the hell with that move you just hold?

Kirito:
You...don't wanna know.

Klein:
Oh, come on! That was totally a new skill!

Kirito:
Well, it's not really a skill. It's skill connect.

Klein:
Skill...connect?

Kirito:
Remember the last update, you know it brought a bunch of sword skills to ALO, right? Well, even now we got those, we didn't get unique skills like dual wielding or the divine blade.

Klein:
But, wait on a sec, you are dual wielding just now!?

Kirito:
Technically, that wasn't dual wielding.

Klein:
Huh?

Kirito:
I was using one hand sword skills in each hand, alternating between them. If I'm lucky, I can keep going without lag maybe three or four times.

Lisbeth and Silica:
Ahh...

Asuna:
Umm...

Yui:
Huh?

Asuna:
No, it's nothing Yui. Just déjà vu was all...

(Asuna reminisces the scene when Kirito first unveiled his dual wielder skill when they all still trapped in SAO)
Klein:
What the hell did you do just now!?

Kirito:
...I don't think you wanna know.

Klein:
Oh, come on! I've never seen anything like that before!

Kirito:
Um...It's extra skill I picked up...Dual Wielding.

Everyone:
Ohh...!

Asuna:
Hmm...

Kirito:
Don't pop a blood vessel. Alright, we can't seeing around n' chat all day. Leafa, how much time we got left?

Leafa:
Oh...right. At the pace were go on, we should have...maybe another hour, or so.

Kirito:
That's it...? Yui, do you know how big these last couple of floors gonna be?

Yui:
Yes, the third floor's about 70% the size of the second, and the fourth floor's pretty much just the boss room.

Kirito:
I figure the last boss fight will take us thirty minutes to finish. That means we only got about thirty minutes to get to his room...

Lisbeth:
That's settles it! The clock's ticking and the King of Giants is waiting. So, let's get it on, and kick its giant ass!

(Lisbeth slapped Kirito's shoulder, but it was too strong so Kirito fell down on the ground)

Yui:
Daddy!

Kirito:
Ugg...You heard her, as soon as everyone has got HP and MP restored, we'd hit that third floor!

Everyone:
Right!



(The third floor of Thrymheim. The floor boss fought against Kirito's party. But this time, Kirito's team leads the battle)

Silica:
(Whistle)

Pino:
Aaahh!

(While Pino distracting boss, Silica cut off one of his legs with her dagger. And Kirito slashed the monster with flame wearing sword. The boss monster vanished)

Silica:
Heh...

Kirito:
Come on guy's! The last boss is waiting!

(Kirito and his party running through the corridor. In middle of the way, they found the elf woman trapped in prison. Sitting on her knee, she looked enduring to something unacceptable for her)

Klein:
Haa...aah!?

(Klein got shocked with baking shocking pink screen, at once he glanced at the woman)

(Woman):
Please...Help me. Let me out of here...

Klein:
eh-hee-hee...Ughw!

(Kirito stopped Klein when he sucked to approach by losing himself of the woman's beauty)

Kirito:
It's a trap.

Lisbeth:
It's a trap.

Sinon:
It's so a trap.

Klein:
Umm...well, maybe it is...? ...Maybe it isn't.

Kirito:
...What do you think, Yui?

Yui:
She's an NPC. Her co-programming connected to the language engine module, just like Urðr. Although...There is one difference between them. This one has HP gauge.

Kirito:
Yeah, that's a big-red flag. If she's got an HP gauge, we might have to fight her.

Asuna:
A trap.

Silica:
Totally, a trap.

Leafa:
Obviously, a trap.

Pino:
Aaww...

Kirito:
It might be a trap, it might not. I don't know. Either way, we can't afford to take the chance. We can't waste any more time, we gotta get a Thrymr asap.

Klein:
...Oh...right...y-yeah. We gotta job to do...

(The party run from captive woman. The woman entreated)

(Woman):
Do not leave me...Please...I beg you...

(Klein stopped)

Everyone:
Er...?

Klein:
I know it's a trap. I'm not...stupid. But even if it is a trap. Even if I know it's a trap...I don't care! I can't just turned back on someone when if they need help! Even if...even if it means we failed the quest, and even if Alne to get destroyed...If I got a chance to do some good for someone, I will! ...Cause that for being a samurai is all about!

Everyone:
Er...

Klein:
Don't worry, princess! I'm coming!

(Klein cut open the bars of made of ice, freed the woman)

(Woman):
I'm free. Thank you, fairy swordsman.

(She smiled to Klein)

Klein:
...No worries, I mean help you up.

(Klein offer his hand for the woman, around his face, numbers of cross yellow stars gave him shine, and his eyes were sparkling. Beside of that, the rest of the party members got shades on their appearance)

(Woman):
...No, I can manage it...Ah!

(She tried to bring her up, bet her hand slipped on ice, so Klein had to support her)

Klein:
Whoa, ...The way out, it's kind a far, doll-face. You're gonna be OK to make it on your own? ...Hm?

(Woman):
...I could. But I'm afraid I cannot leave the castle just yet. For you see, I must first retrieve my people's treasure, which king Thrymr stole. If you would, fairy swordsman, please let me accompany you to Thrymr's room?

Klein:
Eh...? Um...

Asuna:
This is beyond fishy, don't you think?

Kirito:
Uh-huh...

Klein:
Hey, er...Kirito?

Kirito:
(sigh) Alright, I can't stand seeing your beg. Since we only got a little further to go for the end, and seeing how we don't know sure it's a trap...

(Kirito shrugged his shoulder exaggeratedly)

Klein:
Yeees! You here that!? You're coming with us, gorgeous! We'll have you be that jerk Thrymr. We are in the same boat now, so let's get work together!

(Woman):
Oh, thank you fairy swordsman!

(She hugged Klein, squished her bosom to him. It killed Klein)

Kirito:
...Tread Klein's last comment from your memory, Yui.

Yui:
Huh?

("An NPC wants to join you party." An window popped up in front of Kirito. He accepted it. The new member added his party, showed her name at the bottom of the party member list)

Klein:
...Name's Klein.

(Woman):
Oh, fine name...

Kirito:
Freyja...huh, she must be a mage, her MP's really high...

(Kirito looked the emerald amulet on Leafa's chest. It's almost about pitch dark black)

Kirito:
With the way they got this dungeon laid out, the final boss room should be down those stairs. Remember, he's the last boss, so he's gonna be way stronger than any other ones. When you hit him, hit fast and hit hard. Until we can figure out his attack patterns, we'll be on the defensive, so no one move on until I say. On last thing, if we see his gauge dropped yellow or red, his attack pattern's gonna change big time. So, watch out.

Everyone:
Nn.

Kirito:
This is it, guys. Get in there and give it all you've got!

Everyone:
Right!

Pino:
Aahhaa!




(At the bottom of stairs, the big door opened slowly. Frowning cold air poured out from the room. Asuna chanted Strength Buff magic)

Asuna:
Þeír fylla skína hugr, hogg margr illt.

Freyja:
Oss náða fjor regin, tynada vályndr jotunn.

Silica:
It boosted our maximum HP! I don't know how could do that!

(Kirito and Leafa nodded to enter the room. In the room, they found lots of gold objects, gold medals mounted, scattered offhandedly along side the wall)

Lisbeth:
Haa...Cha-cha-ching...! Wonder how much Yrd here...

Klein:
Hee hee...ha ha ha...qoo chee qoo chee qoo[?]...

(Man's voice):
Who let the fly zoon!?

Everyone:
Hm!?

(Man's voice):
The buzzing of their wings is so irritating! Hmm...I shall crash them all!

(Earthquake like footsteps were coming from the depth of the dark room)

(Man's voice):
Before they annoy me...any farther!

(Kirito was looking up huge humanoid figure. Looking up higher and higher, but he still cannot see the giant's face)

Kirito:
Ug...

Thrymr:
Fu fu...Weeny the Alfheim insects! Have you borrowed down here on the whims of Urðr, that trollop!? ...Wretches, how dare you enter here? Did you think of but steal my treasure? If you tell me where I can find that woman, I shall give it all to you gladly?

Klein:
Ha! You think a samurai gives a dumb about gold? Well, you can stick that treasure, right up your ass! But, oh yeah, let me give you a hand!

(Klein pulled out his sword)

Thrymr:
Fu fu fu...Lady Freyja? How good of you to grace us with your presents today. I see you've left your cage! That I take it you've come to a senses an agreed to become my wife? Ha ha ha...

Klein:
She is supposed to marry you?

Thrymr:
Yes, she is. That is why she came to this castle...Isn't that right, my dear? ...However, the night before our wedding banquet,
Would I cautious sniffing around my treasure boat. As punishment, I locked her in a cage of ice. Ha ha ha...

Leafa:
Hey, Kazuto...

Kirito:
Hm?

Leafa:
I know this story...I read it before. Thrymr and Freyja, a stolen treasure, and, something else too...but, what...?

Freyja:
I will not become your wife! These worriers and I are here to put an end to your reign of evil! Return my treasure immediately!

Thrymr:
Yes...! That's the spirit, my lovely! I would expect nothing less from the woman whose beauty and valour renowned throughout the land... And as they say, the more noble the flower, the more satisfying in these to pluck. After I'd snuff the life from these insects, I shall shower you with extra affection...Fu fu fu...Ha ha ha ha...!

Klein:
You...Bastard! Over my dead body, I, lord Klein, won't let you lay a finger on Lady Freyja!

Thrymr:
Fu fu...Listen to the angry little fly, buzzing away! Now then, It is time I began celebrating my conquest of Jötunheimr...I shall start by crushing the life from you!

(Room's luminosity was heightened. A red icon blinked above Thrymr's head. The three layered HP gauge appeared. Meaning the last boss battle began)

Kirito:
Heh...It's on! Listen to Yui, guys! Don't let attack, dodge she says!

Everyone:
You got it[?]!

(With a thunderous footstep, Thrymr thrust down the punch to Kirito)

[The end of episode]
