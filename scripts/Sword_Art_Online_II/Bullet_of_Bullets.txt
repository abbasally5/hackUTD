  (GGO. Governor's office. Kirito is waiting for Bullet of Bullets' main tournament. The information screen shows It's 65 minutes to the game begin. He reminding a talk with Death Gun yesterday)

Death Gun:
Whether you're a fake using his name, or the real guy, someday, I'll kill you.

Kirito:
(In his mind) The first time Death Gun showed up... is after the second Bullet of Bullets. And, both of the murder that he committed happened in front of witnesses. He's been staying under the radar since last killing. Probably leveling up as much as he can. I don't see anyone registered as Death Gun here, but if he wants to stay to the other murder, BoB is perfect. He'll be here. I know it. I've got a find out the name of Death Gun's avatar and stop him.




(Governor's office, the entrance hall. The screen shows it's 36 minutes remain)

Kirito:
Hey. ...Hey, Sinon? ...Hello, anyone home? Come-

Sinon:
Shut up! I've done me to clear I was. Don't talking. God! What do you want from me?

Kirito:
N-Nothing! But now that you mentioned it. Maybe we can swap some info before this starts? I mean... like, you know, for old times... sake?

Sinon:
(Sigh) Fine, whatever... I'll do it. Even know I'm the one who's gonna be giving the info.

Kirito:
But, I got stocked to share too! It's not a lot, but, still...

(The basement. Lots of people waiting the match begin. A famous player Yamikaze is questioned by reporters)

Reporter:
How you feel? If you have gotta shot this time?

(Dyne is chatting with his fellows)

Dyne:
By the time if he sees me, it's too late!

(A tipster is busy shouting his anticipation for his customers)

Kirito:
This is crazy...

Sinon:
Yeah, the final is like one of big party.

Tipster A:
...with ZeXeeD out! Picking winner gotta be tough and ever!

Tipster B:
Only a thousand creds! I can hope you up with top secret info of all the top players!

Spectator A:
Here goes... All I'm on Yamkaze.

Spectator B:
I wonder what Huuka's odds are.

Tipster C:
Come on! Dyne, sure he has good gear and solid skills, but that dude is old on hell, you know? The best he comes in fifteenth today. If you wanna go with a long shot, go with Richie. (Someone taps his shoulder) Huh?

Dyne:
(Chuckle)

Tipster C:
Ah!

Dyne:
So, you think I'm too old to get it on?

Tipster C:
N-No, I was just saying...

Dyne:
Ha ha... This old dog's got some...

Spectator C:
Hey, look! It's Kirito!

Spectator D:
She hacks a people good with that photon sword!

Spectator E:
Oww... Hot berserker with blade!

Spectator D:
Sinon too, a my type, brother.

Spectator C:
I wouldn't mind getting a bullet from Sinon.

Spectator D:
Roger that!

Spectator E:
Shit! I'd rather get slashed!

Spectator C:
And go play in ALO with fairies!

(Kirito felt slight grudge against them. He bumped into the other man)

Kirito:
Oh! Sorry.

Man A:
Oh!

Man A and B(near by Man A):
You're Kirito! S-s-sorry!

(Kirito waked through between them with nothing a word, then, suddenly stopped)

Man A and B:
eek...

Kirito:
Hey, guys...
OK all! root for me! (With a very cute manner)

(All men in there were taken by his cuteness)

Man A:
Yeah! You' got it! Good luck out there!

Man B:
I'll bet my all savings on you!

Sinon:
Oh god. What mess with them...

(The information screen shows the main tournament will begin after 20 minutes. Kirito and Sinon are in the booth)

Kirito:
Um... OK. So, thirty players get dropped, randomly across the same map. An then... and then, you go around, shooting whoever you find, and the winner is the last one standing?

Sinon:
Oh, man... I knew it. You are gonna make these explain in the whole damn thing to you after all... Don't you have email? The admins sent the rules out, so should be said in your in-box.

Kirito:
Yeah, I did scan through, but, it's like... I wanted to make sure I understood. There was a lot of info to absorb...

Sinon:
Ha! absorb? ...Basically, pretty much got the just of it. This thing's a battle royale between thirty players on the same map. Start points are random, and players are dropped by a thousand meters away from each other.

Kirito:
Wow, thousand! That's gonna be one insanely huge map...

Sinon:
...Honestly, you didn't read your email, did you!?
It's multi-stage arena, ten kilo-meters in diameter. It's got mountain, forest, and deserts. The start time is afternoon, so there's no advantage and disadvantage in terms on gear and skills.

Kirito:
How can you find anyone in the field with that big?

Sinon:
That makes a challenging. It's a game with gunfights, remember? Anyway, players get an item to track other players. It's called satellite scan terminal.

Kirito:
There's a satellite? Like a spy drama or something?

Sinon:
Yup. It works just like in real life. It passes over ahead every fifteen minutes. It scans the arena, and then, transmits the coordinates of all the players directly to your terminal. Neat, huh?

Kirito:
Hmm... So, basically, you can only hide in one spot for fifteen minutes.

Sinon:
You catch on quick.

Kirito:
But, then, doesn't all that moving around put a sniper at disadvantage?

Sinon:
Fifteen minutes is more than enough time for a sniper to do their job. I fire. I kill my target. I move on.

Kirito:
Oh... yeah, I guess...

Sinon:
So, we good here? Great. Next time we see each other you can bet your odds...

Kirito:
No! Wait! Hold it! Hold on!

Sinon:
...Is there something else?

Kirito:
Uh-huh. It's what I really wanna talk about...

Sinon:
(Sigh) huh.

Kirito:
Hang on... Could you take a look this list real quick? It'll be all of the BoB contestants. Are there any first timers whose names you don't recognize?

Sinon:
OK. That's weird.

Sinon:
Please, just look at them and tell me. It's important.

Sinon:
Well... If that's all you wanna know, I guess it's cool.
The first time as I don't know... Besides a certain looser with photon sword, are three names.

Kirito:
That's great! Who? Point them out!

Sinon:
Ugh...hmm... Jushi X, Pale Rider, and... this guy... Sterben?

Kirito:
(In his mind) Is one of them Death Gun...?

Sinon:
You're gonna tell me what this is about? Are you gonna keep me in the dark.

Kirito:
Eh...

Sinon:
Get and ready to blow with you is over here...

Kirito:
Eh...

Sinon:
Speak up! I swear if you trying to make me messed up today by piss me off, I'm gonna...

Kirito:
No! That's not it! It's just a...

Sinon:
Does it have anything to do with by you were acting weird yesterday? You know, after the prelims...?

Kirito:
...Uh-huh, it does. Yesterday, this person I want to play against in other VRMMO came up to me. I'm pretty sure one of the names you pointed out is him.

Sinon:
Is he a friend of yours?

Kirito:
No, an enemy. I can't remember his name, though. And, I think we tried to kill each other.

Sinon:
Kill each other? for real? was it... like an argument with someone in your party? something like that?

Kirito:
No way. It wasn't that. It don't kill someone with an argument. He and his group did horrible things. Things like... murder. They were too far gone. And, only way to stop them by force. I don't regret what I did, but still, I've avoided taking responsibility for it. I force myself to forget it even happen. ...For me, there's no more running away. And, this time, I have to face what I did, head-on.
Sorry to an odd like that. Just forget it.

Sinon:
...Do you think you could still pull the trigger, though?

Kirito:
!

(In the last match on prelims. When Kirito talked to Sinon)
Kirito:
Could you shoot a player in here, if you knew in the real world, that player would die from it? And, what if you had to kill that player, 'cause if you didn't, your someone in love will die instead. If you had that power, could you still pull that trigger?

Sinon:
Kirito. What's the name of the game you met this guy in? ...Sorry, never mind. That's personal.

Kirito:
No, that's OK.

Sinon:
...Kirito. I... mm...

Kirito:
Sinon?

Sinon:
huh... We should start heading over to the waiting dome now. We have to check our gear, and get ourselves psyched up for this battle.

Kirito:
Y-yeah. Sure. Lead the way...

(In an elevator, Kirito and Sinon are waiting it reaches the floor they headed for)

Sinon:
I get you've got reasons you for being here. Just like me. But, it's got nothing to do with our promise we've made. I've gotta pay you back for what happened in yesterday's final. Got it? You owe me a fight, so you better stay alive.

Kirito:
Roger that. I promise I'll survive. And, give you the fight you want.

Sinon:
...Thanks.

(Then, the elevator have reached B20 floor. Its doors open)

Moderator:
If you're a battle junkie who loves a smell of gun oil and gun smoke! Then, Get ready! Raise your mask! 'Cos we're about to start!
Now, are you guys ready to find out who's the strongest player in Gun Gale Online, the hardest game in town!?

Spectators:
(Roaring)

Moderator:
As usual, MMO Stream will be broadcasting the battle, live, uncensored!

Spectators:
(Roaring)

Moderator:
Alright! Help me out with a count down guys!

(Some spectators are stomping their guns. Time remaining to the main tournament are about 10 seconds)

Moderator & Spectators:
Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! One!

Moderator:
The Third Bullet of Bullets, Has Began!

Spectators:
Yyeeeaaahhh!

(A fanfare rings around everywhere in GGO. Fireworks goes off)

Keith:
Nngh!

(In the game, Lion King Richie cornered Keith with his Gatling gun from the edge of the mesa. In forest, two men are shooting each other, but Dyne hits both of them from above the tree)

Dyne:
Hmph.

(Sinon is aiming at her opponent, and shoot through a grenade dangling the opponent's waist)

Sinon:
Bingo.

(The grenade detonated. Sinon won a kill)

Spectators:
Yeah!

Spectator C:
Alright!

Spectator D:
Yeah! You go go!

(Sinon opens the map and receive the coordinates of other players from the satellite)

Sinon:
(In her mind) Twenty-one survivors left on play...
Looks like Dyne's on run. Richie's gotta heavy machine gun, so he'll sit tight. He likes as prey coming to him. I'll go after Dyne and Pale Rider... Wonder how he's doing up there...? Ah! What the hell do I care!?

(The satellite left from the area, so the whereabouts of the other players are disappeared from the map)

Dyne:
Damn! This guy's freaking persistent!
Come on! I gotta mag for the round with your name on!

Sinon:
You've forgot to check your six again, Dyne. See you later. (gasp)! Who is there!

(Sinon draws out her handgun, but Kirito slaps it. Her hands and her gun were pressed against the ground)

Kirito:
Shh! Keep it down! I need a favor!

Sinon:
Are you kidding? It's too late for any more favors...! One of us dies in right now!

Kirito:
Stop it! I don't want to those guys know we're here!

Sinon:
What do you up to?

Kirito:
I wanna watch what happens on that bridge. So, don't shoot okay?

Sinon:
Okay...? Then, what?

Kirito:
That depends, but I'm not here for you. I'll leave after. Promise.

Sinon:
I'm meaning, you turned your back, I'll blow you away!

Kirito:
If that what you want, then, fine. But, for now, just stay quiet!

Sinon:
Alright. But after they are turned down there, let's see you and me.

Kirito:
Okay.

(Sinon is her hand off her gun. Kirito frees Sinon and positions himself to watch the bridge)

Sinon:
um...Your stealth skills are pretty pathetic.
I'm not them leave the area alive. If you make some move, I'll take them shot.

Kirito:
He's all yours. Wait. Company...?

(Pale Rider is slowly walking through the bridge, straight toward where Dyne waiting)

Dyne:
Huh? Son of a... hmph.

(Dyne began firing his machine gun. Pale Rider dodged his shots without any difficulty)

Dyne:
Damn!

Sinon:
(In her mind) Wow! He's fast! He boosted Three-Dimensional mobility by killing rider gear!

Dyne:
Ugh...!

Sinon:
His acrobatic skills are up on the roof!

Dyne:
Bastard! ...Gah!

(Pale Rider's shotgun shot hit Dyne. Dyne dropped his knees. Pale Rider rearmed his ammo, then aimed Dyne's forehead at point-blank range)

Dyne:
N-No...!

(Pale Rider shot Dyne. a "DEAD" marker popped up on Dyne's body)

Sinon:
If only he had time to switch mags... he could have shot from the hip and killed him easy)

Kirito:
That pale guy... He's quick, and powerful. Maybe he is the one in the cloak.

(Flashback)
Kirito:
An enemy. I think we tried to kill each other once before.

Sinon:
I'm taking him out.

Kirito:
Okay... But it won't be easy if he's who I think.

Sinon:
Oh, please. He can't dodge my bullet at this range.

(Then, somebody shot Pale Rider at his right shoulder)

Sinon:
!... Did you hear a gun shot?

Kirito:
There wasn't one... 'the hell's going on...?

Sinon:
Two possibilities... It could be a laser rifle with a massive blast, or maybe a live ammo gun with a silencer. Either way, it wasn't a kill shot. So, why isn't he moving?

Kirito:
I think the shot came from the forest.

Sinon:
Uh-uh. He was sniped from farther away than that. I did scan the map not too long ago. There was no one with him one kilo-meter from here. Ah, another one is the subject. You mind tell me where you came from?

Kirito:
Eh... I was just in after that Pale Rider guy. ...Hang on. Oh, no way!

Sinon:
What's up?

Kirito:
When the satellite scanning the area, I was swimming in that river. I guess my location didn't registered on the map, because I was under water.

Sinon:
With all that gear? You should've drown.

Kirito:
Nah. To get them off before I dove in, stocked in my item storage.

Sinon:
I never knew we can use that to cover from the satellite. Thanks for the tip. I'll keep it in mind.

Kirito:
Sinon, check out the shoulder. There's a weird light there.

Sinon:
A stun bullet!?

Kirito:
...Ah!

(At the foot of the bridge, there is Death Gun standing still. His red eyes glow under his cloak)

Kirito:
How long has he been there...?

Sinon:
He's gotta Silent Assassin!

Kirito:
Is that what as the rifle's code?

Sinon:
Yeah, it's a high-end sniper rifle that's got a bad-ass silencer on it. I've heard rumors about the being one in GGO. But, I've never seen it before... If he can handle that gun, he must be some player...!

(Death Gun walks slowly closing the distance between Pale Rider. He pulled out his hand gun and aims at Pale Rider laying ground on his back)

Sinon:
Why would he use a handgun to finish him off...?

Kirito:
Sinon... Shoot.

Sinon:
Huh? Which one?

Kirito:
It's the guy in the cloak! There's no time! Shoot him! Hurry! Don't let him fire that gun!
