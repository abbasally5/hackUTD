  (Kirito's buggy boisterously stopped at the front of the entrance of the governor's office)

Kirito:
Five minutes to go!

Sinon:
We have to hurry! This way!



(Kirito and Sinon entered into the building. The big screen runs the motion poster of ongoing Bullet of Bullets event)

Kirito:
Wow...

Sinon:
Hey, Come on!

Kirito:
(In his mind) I wonder if one of these guys is Death Gun...

Sinon:
Here we are. This is where we have to sign up to the tourney. It's the typical run-of-the-mill touch panel interface. Think you can handle it? Or you want some help?

Kirito:
No, I can figured it out.

Sinon:
Cool. I will be over the next terminal. So, if you get stack, call her.

Kirito:
Okay. Thanks a lot.
Hmm... (In his mind) We are supposed to enter a real life info...?

Sinon:
You've done yet?

Kirito:
Y-Yes! I've all done. Thank you so much for all your help today. Sorry for the trouble.

Sinon:
No worries. That crazy ride on the buggy is more than made up for it. Anyway, which block did you end up with for prelims.

Kirito:
Urm... F, I guess. F-37.

Sinon:
Oh...really. I'm in F too. Number twelve. That's kind of a cool coincidence, huh. When do we meet though... Oh, good. We are not gonna meet up again til the finals.

Kirito:
I'm not sure what you mean. Why's that good?

Sinon:
If a player makes up a final bracket of the prelims, it won't matter they lose. They are automatically advanced to the battle royal. That means, we both have a shot advancing in the battle royal, as long as we make it to the last bracket.

Kirito:
Oh.

Sinon:
But... If we do meet in the final bracket in the prelims... I'll be playing to win.

Kirito:
Oh, ...I get it. Alright. If we both make it, no holding back.

(Kirito and Sinon are walking around the entrance hall)

Kirito:
Wow, I'm impressed. The Japanese translation of this terminal is pretty good. The official site was English only.

Sinon:
Well, Zaskar, the company that developed and runs the game, is American. They probably have Japanese staff to run Japan server. Oh, and get this, I don't know if you knew, but GGO operates some legal gray zone here, and in the U.S.

Kirito:
'Cause its cash conversion system, right?

Sinon:
You won't find anything on company's home page except most basic information. And, it's for managing character, or accessing of e--money account to convert what you earned. Any and all game related procedure is have to be done in the game.

Kirito:
...It's amazing. Shady, but amazing.

Sinon:
It is... The game's practically independent of the real world. Maybe that's why the person I am in here and real me, feel like two different people. ...Sorry, I don't know why I went there. We should start heading over to the preliminary area now. You are ready to go?

Kirito:
Sure.

Sinon:
That way. It's in the basement.



(Kirito and Sinon are in the basement. Tough looking guys are glaring at them)

Sinon:
...Something wrong?

Kirito:
Ah...! No, nothing.

Sinon:
Good. Let's go to a waiting room first. You're gonna need some privacy to change into your combat suits.

Kirito:
Right.

Sinon:
Agh... I swear, what a bunch of dumb asses...

Kirito:
Huh? Who do you mean? Those tough looking guys outside?

Sinon:
Yeah, them. It's a half hour before the match in allow to show off their main weapons. It's like to ask in you come up the kind of measure.

Kirito:
Oh, yeah. That is silly.

Sinon:
Piece of advice, don't equip your photon sword in five seven until just before your match starts.

Kirito:
Uh-huh. ...eh.

Sinon:
Huh? Don't you stand there. Hurry up and change already.

Kirito:
Eh...Yes! I mean, I can't! I mean! I can't change now! I-I mean... I... I'M SORRY!

Sinon:
Why?

Kirito:
I haven't introduced myself... This is who I really am!

Sinon:
Okay...?
Kirito... huh, well, it's an interesting name? I'll give you that... Wait!? Male!?
Bu, ah, you... you are... You kidding! No way! You are a guy!? With that avatar?

Kirito:
He he...

Sinon:
Why, you...!

(Kirito and Sinon are back to the basement. They changed into their combat suits)

Sinon:
...Stop following me.

Kirito:
But I'm not sure what I supposed to do after this...

Sinon:
STOP FOLLOWING ME.

Kirito:
eh... Okay, but I... don't know anyone else here...

Sinon:
Stop following me!

Kirito:
But, but I...

Sinon:
(Inhaling, as if she is about to raise a loud screech)

Kirito:
Eh...!

Sinon:
Huh...(She breathed a big sigh)

(Kirito and Sinon are siting in a booth)

Kirito:
Um... eh... um...

Sinon:
(sigh) I'll explain it. But just for your minimum and that's it. After that, you and me, are enemies.

Kirito:
Thanks! I appreciated it!

Sinon:
Yeah, well, just we were clear. This doesn't mean I'll forgive you. ...You see that clock up there? When it hits zero, every one here will be automatically transferred to the battle field. Along with whoever their first round opponents gonna be. You keep with me so far?

Kirito:
Y-Yeah.

Sinon:
The field is a square, each sizes a kilo-meter. The weather, terrain, and time are all randomly generated. Your opponent's placed five hundred meters away from you. Whoever wins the match get transferred back here. The losers transfer to the first floor hall. And, you don't get penalized for losing your match. There are sixty-four people in block F, so, five wins will take you to the final and and you'll be allegeable for the battle royal. That's it. No more questions? I've done helping you.

Kirito:
I think I've got a just of it. And, thanks again.

Sinon:
Hmph, you better reach the finals. 'Cause even after everything I've told you today, there's one thing you left to learn.

Kirito:
Yeah, what?

Sinon:
...The taste of the bullet that beats you.

Kirito:
...Oh, I look forward to it. What about you, though. You think you can make it to the finals?

Sinon:
Ha, I'll retired if I get knocked out in the prelims. But I won't. Not this time. This time, I'll kill all strong players...

(Sinon's face wares a daring smile)

Kirito:
...

Sinon:
Since this is the last time we'll be chatting like this, you should know my name. There it is. The name of the person who's gonna beat you.

Kinon:
Sinon...
I'm Kirito. Nice to meet'ya. (He offered his hand)

Sinon:
Tsk.

Spiegel(Shinkawa):
Hey! About time you showed up. I couldn't find you anywhere. I was worried you weren't gonna make it.

Sinon:
Sorry about that Spiegel, I totally lost track of time, thanks to unexpected chore. ...Hey, hung on. you said you weren't competing. Did you change your mind?

Spiegel:
Well, Even know I know how much a bugs you, I thought that you weren't in the sidelines. I've already picked a spot in a jumbo screen and everything. What was that unexpected chore you're talking about?

Sinon:
Oh. Nothing. I was just giving this person some sort of orientation.

Kirito:
That'd be me. Hi. How's it going?

Spiegel:
Oh, Hi, it's a... Nice to meet you. So, ah, are you a...am, a friend of Sinon's?

Sinon:
Hate to tell ya, but she is a dude.

Spiegel:
Ugh...

Kirito:
Yeah, my name's Kirito. I'm a dude.

Spiegel:
Eh, a-A guy!? Then, then it said me these are... Is that your...?

Kirito:
He-he, not even. Hey Sinon. Thanks showing me a good time. It was a great for stay,

Sinon:
't the hell are you sayin'!? It wasn't the time. It wasn't a date! It was a mistake. So, forget my name. Forget we've met!

Kirito:
Oh, come on! Don't be so heartless.

Sinon:
Heartless my ass! I don't even know you!

Kirito:
But... we spent a whole day together, picking out all of my gear.

Sinon:
Yeah! But, only because you are a...!

(Announcement):
Thank you for your patients, players. I hope you're ready, because the Third Bullet of Bullets' preliminary tournament is about to begin. When the count down clock reaches zero, all competing players automatically transported to respective first round field maps. Good luck to you all.

(GGO players in the basement are all psyched up. Some of them shoot their gun to the air)

Sinon:
You better make it to the final 'cause I'm looking for into blowing your head off!

Kirito:
I accept your invitation. But, don't keep me waiting too long.

Sinon:
...! Why you...!

Kirito:
Hmph.

Sinon:
Grrrr!

Kirito:
(In his mind) Maybe I went little too far there...
Oh?



(Kirito transported to the empty space. There, he is waiting the first match begin. He ruminating Sinon's last mentioning, and her daring smile)

Sinon(In Kirito's rumination):
This time, I'll kill all strong players...

Kirito:
(In his mind) Is that possible...? Could she be Death Gun...? I saw two sides of her... But, which is real Sinon?
I won't find out standing in here. Thinking about it. But if we crossed swords, I mean, traded shots, I'm sure I'll find the answer.

(Kirito transported to The Ancient Temple, the battle field for his first match. The battle begun)

Kirito:
...! I can't dodge all those bullets! eh... Whoa! ...At this rate, I'll never get to close to him. ...Maybe, if I could use the sword to deflect the bullets, I can get closer. The fires dumb fast though... There's no way I can predict the trajectory of each bullets. ...Ah.
...No. I can do this. The bullet lines tell me exactly what path the bullets for traveling.

(The opponent pauses firing. Kirito concentrates his attention to the sound of his surroundings. He heard somebody crawling along, who is slowly changing his position)

Kirito:
...Now!

Opponent Player:
Eh!?

(The opponent player noticed Kirito running closer to him. He stood and begin to fire his machine gun. But, Kirito cut off and dodged all bullets the machine gun shot)

Opponent Player:
H-Holy clap!

Kirito:
Just a little farther!

(Kirito shot his handgun several times to assist him getting close to his opponent. Kirito's sword reached opponent's body, stuck deep into his chest. Opponent's HP dwindles rapidly. Eventually, the opponent became scattering thousand of light shards and vanished. Kirito won. He was spinning his sword, then place it to his back, as his habit. There's no sheath for the photon sword, though)

Kirito:
Ah, damn it.

(He switched off his sword)

Kirito:
...Oh, lame.

(He fell down as if he spent all of his energy. A fanfare sounded loud to congratulate his win)

Kirito:
I can't believe I have to do this four more times... (sigh)




(Kirito returned back to the basement. He noticed Spiegel watching screen)

Kirito:
I wonder where Sinon is...?

(He was looking around. Then, an ominous man was standing right behind Kirito. We know the man is Death Gun)

Death Gun:
Are you... the real deal?

Kirito:
Uwah!
...The real deal? What do you mean by that? Who are you?

Death Gun:
I saw you... a match. You took him out with a sword.

Kirito:
Yeah? so what? It's not against the rule, isn't it?

Death Gun:
I'll ask you again. Are You The Real Deal?

Kirito:
(In his mind) Wait... Does he know me...? No way! We have met before... We've been face to face like this... But, where...? Where do I know him from...!?

(Death Gun operates his touch panel. He displayed F-block bracket, selected the match, and showed it to Kirito. The name on the panel was "Kirito")

Death Gun:
With that name, and your sword skills... Are you the real deal, or what?

Kirito:
... (In his mind) If he knows me, I should know him...! That's it! He's an SAO survivor! ...Who is he? And, where did we meet in SAO?

(Death Gun closed the panel. He lowered his right hand. Kirito noticed the ominous character's arm has a tattoo that Kirito have watched sometime before. The design was a symbol of Laughing Coffin. Kirito knows where the man came from. He stood still)
