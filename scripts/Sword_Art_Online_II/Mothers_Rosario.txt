  (ALO. Asuna, Yuuki, and all friends of them gathered and having a barbecue party)

Asuna:
Um...Okay everyone.
A toast to this gathering of friends new and old.
To us!

Everyone:
To us!

(General Eugene of the Salamanders patted Yuuki's shoulder, but Sakuya and Alicia got in the way to them become intimate. Klein and Jun were exchanging some easy talks. Leafa chatted with Tecchi, behind them, Recon burned his jealousy storm. Chrysheight and Agil brought foods to Talken, who surfeited himself. Around twenty people were there at the Forrest House K4. Weather's fine, but a small amount of snow still remained around the house)

Silica:
Is everyone here?
Big and amazing party...

Jun:
Yeah, it would.
I know, we should raid the boss of floor twenty three[?]!

Klein:
I'm down with that!

Jun:
Then let's go get him!

Klein:
Yeah!

(Jun and Klein clang their cups together. Next moment, they were actually in the boss battle. Yuuki and Jun running in the front, slashes mob monsters countering them)

Yuuki, Jun:
Daaaaah!

Klen, Kirito, and Yui:
You're going down!

(They slew the boss monster. Yuuki and Asuna bumped their fists)



(The real world, class 3-1 of the school where Asuna went. Yuuki in the apparatus stayed on Asuna's right shoulder, attending the Japanese literature class. After the class, Kazuto was adjusting the settings of the apparatus. Leafa, Jun, and some other girls were racing in the sky in ALO. Leafa was the first to cross the goal line. Silica was last so Sinon patted to console her. Asuna was having peaceful time with her parents and her older brother in her real home. At the Black Iron Palace, names of the members of Sleeping Nights and Asuna's were inscribed as the winner defeating the floor 29's boss. On MMO Stream, "ALO Duel Tournament," the match between Kirito "the blacky" and "Zekken" Yuuki was broadcasted. Yuuki parried Kirito's sword skill, and thrust him with her eleven hit combo. Kirito tried to give her counter blow, but the time of the match upped, Yuuki won the game. Members of the Sleeping Nights ran to gather to Yuuki and celebrated her win. Yuuki showed her grades in her school to her mother. Her scores were almost perfect, and her mother sighed and gave up. JR Kyoto station, Rika, Asuna, Suguha and Keiko stood at the front of the station building. Yuuki was also there on Asuna's shoulder. As their graduation trip or something, they went to Kiyomizu-dera, Arasi-yama, and Entoku-in)



(Asuna's room in the real world. When Asuna entered into her room, her phone rang. She opened her phone cover. An e-mail from Dr. Kurahashi noticed her that Yuuki's condition changed. He summoned her to the hospital. Asuna ran out of the house. When she arrived at the hospital, there were Dr. Kurahashi, two nurses standing beside Yuuki's bed. Dr. Kurahashi beckoned Asuna to Yuuki's bed side. Yuuki wasn't attached to the Medicuboid. Asuna saw Yooki's thin arms, neck, face and her unhealthily sunken eyes)

Kurahashi:
Thank goodness. You made it.
About forty minutes ago, her heart stopped.
But, only for a moment.
We gotta go on with defibrillation and meds, but if it happens again...

Asuna:
Why now...?
Why is this happening!?
She seems fine!

(The doctor shook his head)

Kurahashi:
I'm sorry. The truth is that ever since January, when you fist came to visit her, her condition's been touch and go.
And, for these last three month, we've all been stunned by how Yuuki managed to hang in there.
She can't be this, but she keeps fighting.
...She keeps on fighting.
For fifteen years, Yuuki spent on this planet, had been one long battle.
The HIV is only part of it.
She's also been fighting the harsh reality of her situation more on treatment.
There's no doubt the clinical trials with the Medicuboid caused her unimaginable amount of pain.
And still, somehow Yuuki keeps hanging on.
Well, anyway, we should let her get some rest now.

Asuna:
Come on, Yuuki...
You can't lose.
I mean, you're Zekken...The ultimate swordswoman.

(Yuuki quietly opened her eyes. She tried to move her right arm)

Kurahashi:
Take her hand.
It's OK. That's what she wants.

(Asuna held Yuuki's right hand. Yuuki moved her lips, but she couldn't make any voice. Asuna raised her face)

Asuna:
Doctor! Can she use the Medicuboid now?

Kurahashi:
But...well...wouldn't she wanna spend her last moments here?

Asuna:
No.
She wants to go back one last time.
Please, doctor, let her use the Medicuboid again.

(After the doctor considering it for a short while, he nodded to Asuna)

Kuharashi:
...Nn.

(The doctor set the Medicuboid on Yuuki's head, started setting up the machine)

Kuharashi:
It's going to take up a minute to boot up. Then what?

Asuna:
I'm going next door, log in with the Amusphere.

(Asuna stood up)

Asuna:
Wait for me, Yuuki.
I'm coming!



(ALO, the island on 24th floor. Asuna flew to the island. Yuuki stood at the side of the large tree, turned back to face Asuna)

Yuuki:
Thanks, Asuna.
I'm glad I got to see you again, because I got something for ya.
I can't believe, I almost forgot about it.

Asuna:
Really?
What is that you want it to give me?

Yuuki:
Oh, um...
I'm still gonna make it.
Hang on a sec...

(Yuuki opened her window, tapped it several times. She turned around to the tree, drew out her sword. Yuuki waited to wind stopped, the she began making consecutive sword thrusts, five along to vertical, five along to horizontal. And the most powerful thrust hit at the center of the cross, the prequel thrusts made. The whole island rumbled by the shock of her sword. When she finished her motion, the scroll holding the emblem of sword was made at the tip of Yuuki's blade. Yuuki took it, and she fell to the ground)

Asuna:
Yuuki!

(Asuna knelt and held Yuuki)

Yuuki:
That's weird.
I feel so weak all of a sudden...
And I'm not in any pain or anything, though.

Asuna:
It's okay.
You're just too little tired is all.
You'll be better if you rest.

Yuuki:
Yeah...maybe.
Listen, Asuna, take this.
It's my original sword skill.

Asuna:
No. Yuuki, I, I couldn't.

Yuuki:
Oh, come on. I want you to have it.
Open the window.

(Asuna nodded, and opened her skill window. Yuuki placed the scroll into it. The message "ACCEPTED" displayed on the window)

Yuuki:
Nn....
I gave it a cool name, "Mother's Rosario."
I---It'll keep you safe...when you need it.

(Tears dropped from Asuna to Yuuki's breastplate)

Asuna:
Thank you, Yuuki.
I promise...I'll take good care of it.
And someday, when I leave this world, I'll make sure to pass it on to someone before I go.
Your sword will live on, until the end of time.

Yuuki:
...Thank you.

(Then, Nori, Jun, Talken, Tecchi, and Siune landed to the island, ran to Yuuki's side)

Yuuki:
Oh, guys, come on. We talked about this.
You promised, no good-byes.

Jun:
No, you gotta wrong.
We're all here to cheer you up!

(Jun held Yuuki's hand)

Jun:
When you get to the other side, wait for us. OK?
We won't take too long. Promise.

Yuuki:
What are you talking about...?
If you get there too soon, I'll be pissed.

Nori:
Tsk tsk, you know the deal?
You're hopeless without us!
So, don't even try to argue.
Just sit tight and wait...ever...for us...

(Nori burst into tears, and she no more could speak anything)

Siune:
Please, Nori, don't cry.
We've promised...we've been strong...

(Siune, Talken and Tecchi held Yuuki's hand too. Their faces were all crumpled in tears)

Yuuki:
...I give up. You win.
I'll wait for ya. But, take your time. You got it?

Everyone:
Uh-huh!

(Kirito, Leafa, Lisbeth, Silica, Sinon, and Klein arrived at the island. And each of them paid their honor to Yuuki. After that, the swarm of fairies of the the Sylphs, Cait Siths, all the races of fairies gathered to the island's sky)

Yuuki:
Wow...look at all those fairies...

Asuna:
I'm sorry, I had to let them know.
I hope you are not mad at me?

Yuuki:
Are you kidding? Why would I be mad?
There's so many of them. It's like a dream.
Wh-why are they here?

Asuna:
Because of you!
You're the strongest, most powerful swordswoman in this world's ever seen!
There will never be anyone else like you again.
We can't let you go without saying good-bye. It's not right!
We're all praying for you...that your next journey...will be to a place as wonderful as this!

Yuuki:
I'm happy. I'm so happy.
Hah...you know, this whole time I've thought, if I was borne to die...
What the heck is the point of me even been born...?
I never made anything, or, give anything to anyone...
All I did was waste drugs, and, hook that machine...
And, cause trouble for everyone...
If all I get to do with suffer...and disappeared in the end.
It'd be better to just disappear right now.
I used to always think...
Why am I live? Why'd I sick around for...this long?
I...you know what? After all this time, I think I know why now.
I might not have done much...but I'm glad got to live.
Because after everything, these last few moments, there's a best ever...
I'm surrounded by all my friends.
And I got to end my journey...in the arms of someone I love.

Asuna:
Yuuki, I promise. I will see you again someday...and some other place, some other world!
I don't know how, but I will find you.
And then, we can sit and talk. And you can tell me where you've been...

(Asuna's tear dropped to Yuuki's eyelid. In Yuuki's blurred sights, she saw a woman with straight, black long hair. Maybe the woman was her mother, or maybe her older sister. Yuuki made a string of tears, a smile on her face)

Yuuki:
I gave this live...everything I had!
I was alive!

(Yuuki closed her eyes)



(In the real world, a signboard stood at the gate of the church. It announced the schedules of Yuuki Konno's wake service and her memorial service. Considering to Yuuki's life, the number of people participating the service is pretty large. Most of them seemed young. At the bench outside the church's building, Asuna sat alone quietly. She noticed a piece of cherry blossom's flower petal on her right shoulder, and picked it. Wind blew, and the flower petal flew away to the sky. Asuna heard Yuuki's voice in her ear)

Yuuki:
I've never made anything, or...give anything to anyone.

(Asuna closed her left hand)

Asuna:
You gave me something...
You curbed it deep into my heart.
And, you're always be there.

(Asuna noticed someone approaching to her. She looked the person. In black mourning dress, pale skinned woman stopped in front of Asuna, bowed to her. Asuna return a bow to her, too)

Si-eun:
Hello, Asuna. How are you?

Asuna:
...Wait, is that you, Siune?

Si-eun:
Yes. In the flesh.
it's nice to finally meet you in the real world. I'm Si-eun An.

(Asuna jolted to stand up, and returned her salutation to Si-eun)

Asuna:
Oh! I-It's nice to see you too! I'm Asuna Yuuki.
...Like, meeting the first time, huh?

(Asuna stretched her arm to gesture offering Si-eun her seat. They sat on the bench)

Asuna:
But...

Si-eun:
No, it's OK.
Just less mouth, I got all clear from my doctor.
And, discharged from the hospital.

Asuna:
Then...you're doing better?

Si-eun:
Yes.
...The type of disease I have is called Acute Lymphatic Leukaemia.
And, it was about three years ago, when I developed it.
The side effects from the medicine so horrible, I wanna to die rather than keep suffering...
But, whenever I saw Yuuki, I thought, "here's this kid! And, she's handling her situation, better than I'm handling mine!"
Around February, they started cutting back on the meds I was on.
I thought, "This is it!" And braced myself for the end...
And then, a week ago, the day after Yuuki died, my doctor came in, and said..."Congratulations! You're in complete remission!"
Next thing I knew, I was being discharged.
...I barely had the chance to process the news.
And, the truth is, it's still hasn't sunken yet.
It's like...I should feel awful.
It doesn't seem fair that I'm still here and Yuuki's waiting...
Yuuki and Ran...Clovis and Merida...We promised we'd stick together forever...And, I...I'm here...

Asuna:
Siune, you know, our lives are like vessels.
And, we carry the teachings of the one's past in them.
For the longest time, I was so scared...scared of telling someone how I really felt.
And scared of finding out of they felt.
But I learned from Yuuki, that I was no way for me to live.
If I didn't even try to reach out, nothing will ever change.
She told me how to be strong.
And I wanna share that with others.
As long as I'm alive...I'll pass on what I learned from her to everyone I meet.
And then, someday, when I see her again, I wanna tell her about all the people she's helped.
That's how I'll pay her back.

Si-eun:
Thank you, Asuna.
...You know, we're all so grateful for what you've done.
I've been so worried about Yuuki.
She was carrying a heavy burden on those little shoulders of hers.
But then, you showed up. And, something in her changed.
When you were together, Yuuki seemed like she was really having fun.
She was like a forgetful bird...who remembered how to fly.
And she flew up, and up...and now, she's out of our reach.
...Anyway, Jun's also doing great.
The medication he's on seems to be working.
It's like...I don't know, to me, it feels like Yuuki's telling all of us it's still too soon to join her.
I guess, that mean, it's going for a while yet, before the Sleeping Knights get back together.

Asuna:
Just remember, next time, you're taking me as a member.
And, I don't wanna hear any arguments!

(They chuckled. Then Kazuto and Dr Kurahashi appeared)

Kazuto:
Hey.
I...hoped we're not interrupting anything?

(Si-eun and Asuna stood from the bench)

Asuna:
No. But...wait, do you guys know each other?

Kurahashi:
Sort of.

Kazuto:
He's trying to steal my ideas about that communications part that I made.

Kurahashi:
No, he's lying. I'm interested in its possibilities and full-dive medical tech.
So, we've been e-mail in back and forth.

Asuna:
That's great both of you.
Oh...what about the Medicuboid?
Are you going to phase it out with trial successful?

Kurahashi:
Glad you asked.
They were extremely successful, and now we have enough data to proceed to the next phase.
Soon, patients all over the country will have...er, I am so sorry about that.
I can't believe I didn't say this first.
Ms An, congratulation on your recovery.
I know Yuuki would be thrilled with that news, too.

Si-eun:
Thank you for saying so.
And, congratulations on the trials.
It's good to know what learned Yuuki will be used to help others...that makes me happy.

Kurahashi:
Me too.
Yuuki was the first person to test the Medicuboid.
And her name will always be remembered.
If she were here, she'd get award for her help.
Along with the benefactor who made it all possible.

Si-eun:
Knowing Yuuki, she wouldn't be too thrilled that getting in award!
She'd say, "what the point of having it if I can't eat it!"

(They all chuckled)

Asuna:
Um...er, Doctor?
You just mentioned the Medicuboid has some kind of benefactor...?
I thought you said the government was paying for it.

Kurahashi:
Oh, well, yes, they are.
But, initial design were giving to us for free from someone else.
If I remember that correctly, I think her name was Dr. Rinko Koujiro.

(Asuna and Si-eun looked each other. They seemed don't know the name. But, Kazuto immediately stiffened his face expression, seemed he get much shock from hearing the name)

Asuna:
Wh-what's wrong, Kirito!?

Kazuto:
I...I know her.

Asuna:
How?

Kazuto:
I met her once.
...Yeah, in fact, she was taking care of Heathcliff's body while he was diving!
She was his head researcher...She helped him developed full-dive technology...
You see? The Medicuboid's design...You know who invented it?

Asuna:
No way...
It was Kayaba!?

(Sudden gust flew up flower petals of cherry blossom trees. The large amount of them flew and floated in the spring blue sky)



(Tokyo, perhaps Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden. Kazuto and his friends gathered to have cherry blossom looking party)

Andrew:
Need I help unpack all this stuff?

Suguha:
Sure! But only if you're not busy.

Ryoutarou:
You seriously! Ain't she cute!?

(Ryoutarou showed his smartphone to Rika and Keiko to see the picture)

Rika, Keiko:
Eww...

Suguha:
I got you a little gift!

Shino:
No way! You shouldn't have!

(While everyone's busy preparing the party or chatting each other, Kazuto and Asuna sat on lawn, took little distance from others)

Asuna:
Are you having fun hanging around with everyone?

Yui:
Yes! And, cherry blossoms are pretty!

Kazuto:
Yeah. It's too bad they are almost gone.

Asuna:
Oh, please. There's plenty left. It spoils for it!
Anyway, we're here with Yui. That's the important thing.

Kazuto:
I still can't believe we've made it happen that fast.

Yui:
Thank you so much for this, daddy!

Asuna:
Yeah. Kirito, thank you.

Kazuto:
Nah. If you wanna thanks someone, thank Yuuki for helping me develop it.

Asuna:
Nn.

(Asuna nodded. The wind blew, and petals of cherry blossoms were blown up)

Yui:
Wow...!

Kazuto:
...The real world and the virtual, I thought the closer they came together, the better the future would be.

Asuna:
Hm?

Kazuto:
It's like...more the lines between these world blur, the more everyone get sucked into its darkness.

Asuna:
...Yeah, but, a lot of people have been helped by it, too.

Kazuto:
If anything, I wish I knew Kayaba's master plan was...
I don't know, maybe it's our job as survivor's of SAO to find out?

Asuna:
I think you're overthinking things?

Kazuto:
Yeah, I guess...
Still, I wanna find out more than ever now.
Even after everything that's happened, my curious this got me hooked.
Although, a part of me thinks some being ply it here. That's kind of annoying.
...Whatever, I don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow...All I know is, I-I wanna be with you...forever.
And, I want you to be with me.

Asuna:
(Chuckle) I'll stick by you even if you move halfway across the planet!

Kazuto:
Who said anything about moving!?

Yui:
Don't forget to take me along!

(Then, Rika shouted to Kazuto and Asuna)

Rika:
Hey~ love birds! Quit making out!
We wanna take a photo!

Ryoutarou:
Get over here, guys!

Kazuto:
Well, shall we?

Asuna:
Nn-huh.

(Kazuto offered his hand, and Asuna took it)

Yui:
Okay, daddy!

(They ran to everyone with holding their hands)

[The end]
