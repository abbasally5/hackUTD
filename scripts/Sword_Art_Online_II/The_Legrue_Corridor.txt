Oss náða nótt lysa auga.

Leafa:
Wow... Everything look brighter now. So, this is "Night Vision Magic." I guess, Spriggans are good for something, after all.

Kirito:
I don't know that was a compliment or dis.

Leafa:
Hee hee, you're practicing the magic you can use. That's the important thing. And, projecting illusions is one of your specialties.

Kirito:
Illusions?

Leafa:
Yeah, the trick people with. It's cool, but it's not gonna help anyone much in combat. But, you never know, in a life or death situation, your lame Spriggan magic might actually come in handy. Hee hee hee...

Kirito:
Urg... now, that was a dis.



Kirito:
Saiar wratts ar no...noto?

Leafa:
No, you just memorize in the words. You have to learn the words power mean first, then match them with effect of the magic. That's how memorize spells.

Kirito:
Haa... I never thought I've been in a game, I have to memorize words from the different language.

Leafa:
Oh, and, just so you know, the higher rank spells have about twenty words.

Kirito:
Holy crap... I'll to stick to fighting, then.

Leafa:
Would you quit complaining? Oh, ah... Someone's messaging me. Sorry, I have to get this.

Kirito:
Sure.

Leafa:
It's Recon again... It's probably nothing, but I'll check anyway. It says "I was right. Be careful. s." That's it. What's that mean? "s"? Sa... si... su... oh.

Kirito:
What's wrong?

Leafa:
Oh... nothing.

Yui:
Daddy! I'm picking a movement behind us!

Kirito:
Are they monsters?

Yu:
Na-uh. They're players. A lot. Twelve, total.

Leafa:
You're kidding. um... I've got a bad feeling about this. We better take cover.

Kirito:
Okay, but, where?

Leafa:
Ha! Just leave everything to me.

Kirito:
Hey, easy...

Leafa:
Mm-huh. Þik sér óvíss grœnn lopt. ...We can talk, but we have to be really quiet about it. Anything louder than whisper, and it's gonna break down the spell.

Kirito:
OK.

Yui:
They'll be coming into view, soon.

Kirito:
What is that? You see it?

Leafa:
Huh? No, I can't see anything.

Kirito:
I can tell it's not a player. It's got red eyes. Kind like a bat.

Leafa:
...! Ah!

Kirito:
Why do you break a cover?!

Leafa:
Because that thing out there is a high level tracing searcher. We have to destroy it! Ek skýt tuttugu smár striða! C'mon! We gotta go!

Kirito:
Uh, can't we just hide behind on your spells again?

Leafa:
They already know we're here. That tracer had us pegged. Hiding's not gonna us any good. Besides, that bat is a fire element familia. That can only mean the ones tracking us are...

Kirito:
The Salamanders!

Leafa:
What the party of Salamanders are doing way down here?!

Kirito:
Wow! Check out the lake! ...Looks like we're gonna get away!

Leafa:
Watch for you're going or you'll fall in! ...Ah? Oh, crap!

Kirito:
Um, damn! Rah! Ug...

Leafa:
That won't work.

Kirito:
Why didn't you tell me that before?

Leafa:
Oh, right, like, it's my fault to you in a hurry. It's an earth magic barrier. You can bash on it all day, an it won't destroy it.

Kirito:
Can we jump in the lake and swim around it?

Leafa:
Nope. At least, not unless you wanna be lunch. The water's filled with high level monsters. The Undine, they're the only one who can take those kind of things on.

Kirito:
Then, I guess the only option left is to fight.

Leafa:
I'm not gonna argue with that. But it won't be easy. If the Salamanders have high level earth magic, it can only mean one thing. They have powerful mage on their side.

Kirito:
Leafa, I know you're good with a sword. So, don't take this to wrong way. But, could you back me up from here on in?

Leafa:
Eh...?

Kirito:
I need you to stay behind, and focus on healing me. That way, I can fight harder, and not worry about my HP.

Leafa:
Um...

Kirito:
Oooaaah! Ha!

Leafa:
Ah?! They're targeting him with everything they've got!

Healers:

Kirito:
Ah? ...Heh.

Tanks:
Uh-oh.

Kirito:
Ugh...!

Leafa:
...brott svalr bani! ...What' we do? He's gonna run out HP some point! That's enough, Kirito! If we lose, it'll just mean a couple of extra hours for flying! Let's give up when we can!

Kirito:
No way!

Leafa:
Huh?

Kirito:
As long as I'm alive, I'm not gonna anyone in my party die! I won't let that happen again!

Leafa:
...

Kirito:
OOOOAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!

Tank A:
What the hell?! What's he doing?

Yui:
Hurry! This is our only chance!

Leafa:
What do you mean?

Yui:
You have to use all of your mana you have! Hurry and focus on shooting them for the next magic attack!

Leafa:
Er... Okay...? But I don't think it's gonna help.

Mages:
Ek verpa einn brandr muspilli, kalla bresta...

Leafa:
Nn. Þú sér lind ásynja, burt eimi og...

Yui:
Do it now! Daddy!

Kirito:
Þeír hræða nótt dýpt...

Leafa:
He's using an illusion magic...? But all that's gonna do is make him look like a giant monster!

Kirito:
renn helvegr!

Monster:
Fu fu, Hah ha ha hah...

Leafa:
Is that... Kirito?!

Monster:
Grrraaaah!

Tank B:
Ugh!

Tanks:
Oh... my god!

Mage Leader:
Idiots! Don't break formation! It's not real! Don't be afraid! It can't hurt us if we stick to the plan and stay in formation!

Monster:
Grooaaah!

Tank C:
Hyaaah!

Tank A:
Ah!

Mage Leader:
A-anyone, the "Explosion Spell!"

Mages:
Hyee! Ugh! Gyaa!

Mage Leader:
Eek... Dah! ...Arrggh!

Monster:
Groooaahhh...

Mage B:
Ah... Stop it!

Leafa:
Ah...! Wait, Kirito! Hold on. Don't kill him!

Mage B:
Ug...

Yui:
Isn't my daddy amazing?!

Mage B:
Oh... my... er?

Leafa:
OK, if you wanna live, you better tell me who sent you us half assed after us?

Mage B:
...Never! Kill me if you want!

Leafa:
You got it.

Kirito:
Oh, man! Now, that was cool. That was an awesome fight!

Mage B:
Huh...?

Kirito:
You plan was shabby either! If I was alone, I wouldn't last a minute against you dorks!

Leafa:
What are you telling that for?!

Kirito:
...Let me handle this. Listen up, I wanna see if you and me can make a deal. Check it out. Those all are the items and Yuld I won after beating you asses. All you have to do is answer my questions, then it could be yours. Sounds good?

Mage B:
Eh...seriously?

Kirito:
Totally.

Mage B:
Er...heh heh...

Kirito:
heh heh heh...

Leafa:
Ah, man...

Yui:
It's like they forget we'er even here...

...

Mage B:
...Earlier this evening, I got the urgent text from Gtacs, he's the leader of the mage squad I worked on used to be. Any way, I got this text telling us so we meet him here. And, when we showed up, he said he needed twelve of us to go a hunt for two players. At first, I thought it was over kill, but, well, he said you guys took out Kagemune, so it made sense.

Kirito:
Who's this Kagemune guy?

Mage B:
He's the leader of the lancer squad. And he's known for hunting Sylphs. Yesterday, he got creamed in fight and retreat. That was you guys, wasn't it?

Leafa:
Wait. Why's Gtacs so interested getting us out of the way?

Mage B:
The order came from the top. Something about you... interfering with... plan.

Kirito:
Yeah? What plan?

Mage B:
Heh, hey, I'm just a grunt. They don't tell me anything. But, I'm pretty sure something really big's about to go down. When I logged on today, I saw this big ass swarm of Salamander troops heading up north.

Leafa:
No way... They are gonna go clear The World Tree, aren't they?

Mage B:
I doubt that. Someone figured that. To take the tree, the whole army would need ancient weapon class equipment. We can't afford that stuff.

Leafa:
Hmm...

Mage B:
That's everything I know. I promise.
...You weren't lying about you enter the deal, were you?

Kirito:
No! I'm a man of my word, partner!

Leafa:
Ugh...

...

Leafa:
Hey, that big ugly monster that was tearing everything up. Was that you or an illusion?

Kirito:
Yeah... I don't remember.

Leafa:
Wait, you don't know?

Kirito:
Not really. I just happen sometimes... In the heat of battle or snap, I can't remember things after...

Leafa:
Whoa... scary.

Kirito:
I think I remember most of what happens this last time, though. Like, I know I use that spell Yui suggested.

(Reminiscence)
Yui:
Do it, now!

Kirito:
I also remember getting huge. That was cool. I remember losing my sword, and then... grabbing people.

Yui:
And you were chomping down on them. Remember that?

Kirito:
Oh, yeah. I totally felt like a monster! I ate you people and everything.

Leafa:
So, eh... what are they taste like...?

Kirito:
Kind like grilled meat, just before gets burnt. Oh, crispy and...

Leafa:
OK! Good! Sorry I asked!

Kirito:
Hee hee... Munch!

Leafa:
Eeek! (Spank)

Kirito:
Ugh!



Leafa:
Wow... So, this is Legrue.

Kirito:
Aw... That hurt.

Yui:
Then, you shouldn't be biting people.

Leafa:
I'll say it.

Kirito:
Why's everyone ganging up on me? I was trying to break the tension with stupid joke, is all.

Leafa:
Bite me again, and I'll cut you in half.

Kirito:
Oh... Yes, ma'am.

Leafa:
Eww... Oh, look!

Kirito:
Hey, um, I just remembered something.

Leafa:
Hmm?

Kirito:
Right before those Salamanders attacked us, you gotta message from your friend.

Leafa:
Oh! I totally forgot! ...Recon's not online. Maybe he's asleep.

Kirito:
OK, well, why don't you log out and get him a call?

Leafa:
Hmm... yeah, I think I better checking with him. I'll only be gone for a sec. Wait for me here, OK? ...Yui, would you please keep an eye on my avatar?

Yui:
Me?

Leafa:
Yeah, I need to make sure your dad isn't mess around with while I 'm out.

Yui:
Copy that, ma'am!

Kirito:
You gotta be kidding...



Suguha:
Umm... Huh?! ...Hey, Nagata. What's with all those calls? And what do you want?!

Nagata:
You picked up! Finally! Where were you, Suguha?!

Suguha:
Urm... I was dealing with some in-game stuff.

Nagata:
W-we got trouble, like, like big trouble! Sigurd's coming after us, and, and that's not all! He betrayed Sakuya, the Sylph commander!

Suguha:
Betrayed her?! How? Start from the beginning, and tell me everything what happened.

Nagata:
Erm... But we're running out of time! ...OK! Remember when the Salamanders ambushed us in ancient forest? uh, Didn't that whole set up seems little... weird to you?

Suguha:
I don't know, not really. Why do you think it was weird?

Nagata:
Remember, how Sigurd said he'd be a decoy, and running more three of them away?

Suguha:
Yeah, now that you mention it.

Nagata:
That's a thing out of his character. I mean, usually he makes someone else do it, right?

Suguha:
Yeah, I guess. I mean, you right. It's weird. But what your point?

Nagata:
Okay, here it is. I found out he's been working as spy for Salamanders. Probably for a while now.

Suguha:
What?! Do you have proof? Or, did you just hear about it?

Nagata:
Remember how I said something is bugging me. Well, I used a transparency spell, and I've been following Sigurd all day. ...T tracked to him back alley, and I saw him and couple of others put on invisibility cloaks. They were up to something. That's for sure. I followed them down into the sewers, where there's two skeptic guys were waiting for him. I couldn't believe it. They were Salamanders! They were little ways away from me, so I couldn't hear everything. But I heard the Salamanders said they put a tracer on you...

Suguha:
...Keep going. Then what?

Nagata:
The Salamanders caught me. I'm still in the sewers, paralyzed by the poison allow.

Suguha:
Now, I know why you kept calling me IRL...

Nagata:
There's something else. Sakuya is supposed to form an alliance with Cait Sith today. The meeting in the neutral territory. And she's heading up right now, in secret. Sigurd knows about it, too. He's gonna show up on the signing ceremony with his squad and attack it!



Kirito:
Arng...

Leafa:
We have to hurry!

Kirito:
Ug! ...Hey, welcome back, Leafa.

Yui:
Yeah, welcome back!

Leafa:
Kirito, I have to leave.

Kirito:
Why?

Leafa:
Sorry, but there is something I have to take care of right away. If I had time to explain, believe me I would... but I can't. And, I don't think I'll be coming back here either.

Kirito:
Then, I guess you'll just after explain it to me on the way.

Leafa:
Huh?

Kirito:
It'll take a while to get out of here because we can't fly. That's enough time, right?

Leafa:
Eh... Yeah, right.

Leafa:
Forty minutes from now, in the valley of the butterflies, the leaders of Sylph's and Cait Sith's are gonna have a meeting.

Kirito:
Mind if I ask a couple of questions before we get there?

Leafa:
Go ahead.

Kirito:
If the Salamanders attack the Sylphs and the Cait Siths, what are they gonna get out of it?

Leafa:
The one, they stop the alliance from happening. And, if the Cait Siths find out their leader died because by the Sylph turned to traitor, they'd be pretty pissed, wouldn't they?

Kirito:
Super pissed.

Leafa:
It's a good way to start a war between Cait Siths and Sylphs. That's for sure. It's also a good way to get rich. If you take out the leader of the territory, you'll get thirty percent of its money. You can invade its home town for ten days, and charge whatever tax you want.

Kirito:
No way... Really?

Leafa:
Seriously! Why'd I lie to you? ...This isn't your problem, Kirito. It's a Sylph's problem. You don't have any reason to get involved to risk your life for over it. If we go to the meeting, chances are we won't make it back alive. And probably after start over from Swilvane again... But, those could work for you... You wanna get to the top of the World Tree, so... you might be better off working with the Salamanders.

Kirito:
Hm?

Leafa:
If they can pull this off, it'll give them powers and resources they need to make attempt to the World Tree. And, since you're a Spriggan, they might hire you as mercenary. So, if you wanted to kill me, you could. ...I wouldn't hold it against you.

Kirito:
It's just a game in the end. Anything goes, right? If you wanna kill, you kill. If you wanna steal, you steal. ...A lot of people think like that. More than I cared to know. And, in a way, I get it. Even I used to think like that. But, non of it's true. In a virtual world, there's thing you have to protect because it's a virtual world. Someone special told me that.
If you give into your impulses in here, it's gonna change who you are in the real world. The player and character are the one and the same. Leafa, you are a good person. And, I wanna be your friend. So, it doesn't matter what the reason is, there's no way in hell I'd ever attack a friend from my own benefit. I couldn't live with myself.

Leafa:
um... Kirito, I... er... thank you.

Kirito:
Oh, whoa, I sounded pretentious, didn't I? Sorry about that.

Leafa:
Uh-uh, that was pretty cool.

Kirito:
Um... Oh clap! We're wasting time standing here! We gotta go! Yui, lead the way.

Yui:
You got it, daddy!

Kirito:
Here, give me your hand.

Leafa:
Okay? but... eh...

Kirito:
Come on!

Leafa:
Whoooaaaahhahhh?! ...ah? The monsters! Ahhh!

Kirito:
There's the exit!
