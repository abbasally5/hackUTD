  (ALO, A bar. Asuna and her company watching Bullet of Bullets displayed on the screen)

Leafa:
Hmm... Where's Kazuto? He should've shown up by now...

Silica:
Maybe, they don't have a battle up on the field yet. I mean, knowing Kirito, they should have seen him running around, guns blazing from the start.

Klein:
I don't know. he's one of the clappiest player I've ever met. He's probably leaned low somewhere, waiting for the competition to kill each other off.

Asuna:
Oh, please. You and I both know he doesn't play like that. Isn't that right, Yui?

Yui:
Absolutely! Besides, daddy's so fast, I doubt he even shown up on camera. He'll sneak up and strike before the enemy knows what's happening!

Lisbeth:
Ha ha ha! He can't do it any other way! I mean, it's a game with guns, and he's using a sword! What do I do bet!?

Everyone:
(Laughter)

Lisbeth:
Ah, (Whistle) That one guy is unbelievable!

Asuna:
Huh? You mean, the one on one?

(On the screen, Pale Rider's shotgun shot Dyne. Dyne dropped his knees. Pale Rider rearmed his ammo, then aimed at Dyne's forehead at point-blank range)

Dyne:
N-No...!

(Pale Rider shot Dyne. The "DEAD" marker popped up on Dyne's body)

Everyone:
Huh...

Silica:
He's super fast...

Lisbeth:
Yeah...
That guy's sick. I bet he's gonna win this thing...

(Then, somebody shot Pale Rider at his right shoulder)

Everyone:
Ah...

Klein:
Looks like your voice pull out suck this?

Lisbeth:
Shut up! He's not out of it yet.

Silica:
What happen to him...? It's some kind of paralyses attack... Most likely temporarily.

Leafa:
It's like he was hit what that wind spell, thunder whip...

(Somebody entered into the screen. It's Death Gun)



(Death Gun pulled out his hand gun and aims at Pale Rider laying on the ground on his back)

Kirito:
Sinon... Shoot.

Sinon:
Huh? Which one?

Kirito:
It's the guy in the cloak! There's no time! Shoot him! Hurry! Don't let him fire that gun!

(Sinon shot Death Gun. But it was missed. Looks like he could managed to dodge the bullet)

Sinon:
Uh... Oh, crap! He know I was here!

Kirito:
How could he?

Sinon:
Maybe, he spotted me earlier... Got my position from last scan.

(Death Gun restored his pose, shot Pale Rider. It wasn't give him a fatal damage. Right at the time Pale Rider's paralysis effect no longer bound him, he stood up and tried to shoot Death Gun with his shotgun. But he collapsed to the ground again. His left hand grabbed his own chest. His right hand wriggled in the air. As if he got suffocated or got heart failure. Then, he disappeared from the game. There was "DISCONNECTION" mark where Pale Rider was before)

Sinon:
Jesus. What was that...?

(Death Gun trampled the mark under his foot. Began speaking)

Death Gun:
Death Gun is my name, and the name of my gun. One day, I'll pay you all a visit to. And bring real death... with this gun. You've seen my power. It is real. This isn't over... not yet. I'm just getting started. It's showtime.

Asuna:
(In her mind) I have met this person before... But, where? There's only one place I could of...Aincrad!

(Klein dropped his grass to the floor. He was dumbfounded)

Lisbeth:
Wait! You scared the hell on everyone!

Klein:
Y-You've gotta be kidding me... No way... It can't be...

Asuna:
You know him too? Do you remember his name?

Klein:
N-no... I forget the handle he used... But it's him... There's no doubt. He was in Laughing Coffin.

Asuna:
...! Laughing Coffin... Was he their leader? You know, the knife wielder?

Klein:
No, pretty sure it's not PoH. Something about the way this guy talks in accent is different. Separate that "showtime" line, though. PoH is only one who said that. But, this guy, he was close to PoH. I'm talking him right hand man close.

Asuna:
Kirito...

(In GGO, Kirito is watching the scene through his binocular)

Kirito:
It's him. Alright. Yeah. That's Death Gun.

Sinon:
Death Gun? You're joking. You mean those rumors about players getting shot and disappearing? those are all true?

Kirito:
Yeah, they are. I don't know how he does it yet. But he's been killing the players in the real world.

Sinon:
That's insane!

Kirito:
It's not. Two people have been found dead.

Sinon:
...

Kirito:
Where'd he go?

(Sinon's watch alarm a sound, notified it was about the time next satellite arrival)

Sinon:
Kirito, watch the bridge for a sec. I'm on a check on the scan and see what the names is going by.

Kirito:
Yeah, you've got it.

(Sinon left from the edge, opened her map, and received information from the satellite)

Sinon:
(In her mind)...Huh? Where is he? Could he have moved that fast? ...No.
This is our chance.

Kirito:
For what?

Sinon:
Your pal in the cloak hasn't shown up on the terminal. My guess is, he jumped into the river. If I'm right, then he had disables his gear like you did.

Kirito:
What about his handgun? He can still move under water with that equipped, right?

Sinon:
Even if he could, it's just a little hand gun. I can take him out easy with my Hecate...

Kirito:
You can't! ...You saw what happened? He used that little gun to kill Pale Rider. Only take his one shot! Get it!? One shot, you're dead for real!

Sinon:
Um... Yeah... well... I'm not buying it... How's it even possible...? I mean, a player killing people. I allow?

Kirito:
I know it sounds crazy. But it's the truth. This Death Gun guy killed a lot of people at VRMMO I was in. When he used his sword on someone, he knew he was really killing them. And... so, did I.

Sinon:
There's a killer... a murderer in GGO?

(That triggered Sinon's blood current adverse. She was trapped in panic attack. The laughter of the man she killed suffocated her mind)

Kirito:
Sinon... Sinon!

Sinon:
Ah!? ...Ah, I'm alright. Just a little freaked out. Anyway, I'm still not convinced what you told me possible. But, I don't think you are lying about it either.

Kirito:
That's good enough. I can't ask for more.

Sinon:
Yeah, well... We better get out the area ASAP. The others know we're here by now. They think we're busy fighting each other so, they'll be closing in soon.

Kirito:
You've got a point. We spread of here, then.

Sinon:
Wait. What are you gonna do?

Kirito:
I'm going after Death Gun. Alone. What ever you do, stay away from him.

Sinon:
But...

Kirito:
I'll keep my promise. Next time we see each other, I'll give you the fight I owe you. ...Oh, and one more thing. Thanks for hearing me just now instead shooting me.

Sinon:
Huh? ...Hey! Uggh!
Wait for me!

Kirito:
...!

Sinon:
I'm coming with you.

Kirito:
What...?

Sinon:
That Death Gun guy seems pretty tough. And, if he kills you, you won't be able to fight me.

Kirito:
I don't think you get out...

Sinon:
Look. I'm not fun to teaming up either, but I think we stand better chance on knock him out of the game if we work together.

Kirito:
No, I'm not down with it. It's too dangerous.

Sinon:
We don't have any idea where he'll pop up next. So, it'll be dangerous by that we're together or not.

Kirito:
Hmm...

(Kirito slightly nodded. Then, suddenly, he pulled out his photon sword and turned it on. The other player in BoB fired his machine gun to them. Kirito maneuvered to cut all the bullet down)

Player A:
Huh?

Kirito:
We better take care of this joker. I'll block his bullets. You aim for opening.

(Sinon spaced out, but quickly recovered and recognize what Kirito said)

Sinon:
Roger that.

(The man changed his magazine, resumed his attack. Sinon stared Kirito's maneuvering in amazement. He was rolling his sword and not a one bullet penetrate the barrier field he'd made)

Kirito:
He's all yours!

(Sinon fired her sniper rifle. Her shot pierced the opponents body)

Player A:
No way...

(His body teared into two pieces. The "DEAD" marker popped up)

Sinon:
(Took deep breath)

Kirito:
Death Gun's probably heading North at the river. I wanna be there one in circuses. I don't know where him stop. Got any idea Sinon?

Sinon:
Eh? ...I don't know if he's got any other special skills, but from what I've seen, he's a sniper. He's gonna avoid open spaces, look for a place with cover. If I were him, I'd set myself up in the ruins at that city.

Kirito:
Good. And that's you and me are gonna go.

Sinon:
eh... On your six.



(ALO, a bar. Asuna and the others are all in silent. They look doleful)

Klein:
In SAO... we have a code. Never let another player's HP hit zero. No matter what. We knew, if it dropped to nothing, the player would die. ...Laughing Coffin didn't care. They killed dozens...no, hundreds of people. The assault team were stepped in. It put the party together hunt them down, and capture them.

Leafa:
And, Kazuto was there with you?

Klein:
Yeah, he was up front going toe-to-toe... Everything went to hell pretty fast.

Leafa:
Oh, man... That's why Kazuto's been acted so weird lately... Now I'm more read. Maybe he's trying settles some grudge or something...

Lisbeth:
Grudge!? Is it supposed to be a part-time job!?

Asuna:
n...! Sorry, I'm logging off for a bit.

Leafa:
Why!?

Asuna:
I have to get in touch with Kirito's client.

Silica:
Wait. He's gotta client?

Asuna:
Mm-hm. He's the one who got Kirito to dive in the GGO. I bet he knows what's going on. ...Oh, and Yui, I'm going to need your help while I'm gone. Find out anything you can in GGO.

Yui:
You can count on me, mommy!

Asuna:
I'll be back in a little while. Wish me luck.



(GGO. Kirito and Sinon are running through a desert. They reached a ruined city)

Sinon:
Where the heck did he go? You think we might past him on the way over here?

Kirito:
No, we didn't past him. I was keeping an eye on the river whole time when we were running.

Sinon:
Oh, where the river dead end is here. I guess he must be lurking around somewhere in the city now.

Kirito:
Okay, listen. When his location pops up on the next scan. We'll rush him before he can kill anyone else.

Sinon:
I'm done with that. But there's one problem. How will we know who Death Gun is? I mean, that's not his avatars handle, remember?

Kirito:
eh. Oh yeah... right. Then... Let's start with what we know. You said you didn't recognized the names of three new players. It's not Pale Rider, that's for sure. At least as two names in play can be Death Gun, Jushi X and Sterben.

Sinon:
If they're both in the city, we can't afford to picked the wrong one. Wait a sec, I just thought a something. In Japanese, the "Shi" in Jushi means "Death", get it? And the "X" could mean "Cross". Like, nicking the sign of cross. You think? ...or, maybe it's too obvious?

Kirito:
Hmm... Maybe not. Aren't avatar names usually simple and obvious? Mine's abbreviation in the real name. And yours?

Sinon:
...Yeah, same here.

(Kirito and Sinon both chuckle)

Kirito:
Well... If they both here we'll go after Jushi X first. Oh, and if I get paralyzed like Pale Rider, don't panic. Get in the position and wait.

Sinon:
Huh?

Kirito:
Death Gun's probably hiding somewhere close. When he comes out to finishing me off, that's when you shoot him.

Sinon:
...Aren't you worried I shoot you too?

Kirito:
Are you kidding? You are the last person I'd expect to play like that. Let's go, partner. I'm counting on you.

(Kirito tapped Sinon's arm. Sinon shows complicated feelings on her face)

Sinon:
Umm...! Okay, but once we get him off, that's we're off.

(They entered into the city. Sinon checked her watch, and expanded the location map. It receives the coordinates of the other players in the city)

Sinon:
Kirito, check the north side of the map.

(They tapped several icons to check the names. Among them, there's also a location of Jushi X)

Sinon:
It's him. He's the only one in the city. I guess he's a man, huh?

Kirito:
Yeah... I don't see Sterben around. That settles it. Jushi X and Death Gun are one and the same. That means he's going after... him.

(Kirito pointed at Rikoko's icon, moving around in the city on the map)

Sinon:
We better move fast. Rikoko's almost in his range.

Kirito:
Yeah. Are you ready for this?

Sinon:
Yup.

(Sinon put away the map. They started moving. When they reached near the stadium, where Jushi X supposed to be hiding, Sinon used her special skill. Perhaps it's her sniping specialty related one, her sight was magnified several times, and she could locate where Jushi X hiding at)

Sinon:
Run down. Up there.

Kirito:
He's probably waiting for Rikoko to walk right up into sights. I'll attack Jushi X from behind when I got a chance. That building in front of the stadium might be a good place for you to get in the position.

Sinon:
No, I'm coming with you.

Kirito:
Not this time. I can fight way better known you've got my back. We're a team, remember?

Sinon:
...Mm-hm.(She's nodding, but she looks she's not entirely agreed on him)

Kirito:
All I'm gonna need is thirty seconds to get up there. I'll be ready to take him out. Is that enough time for you?

Sinon:
Mm-hm, plenty.

Kirito:
Cool. See you in a bit.

(They were apart. Sinon was on her way. Black ravens alighted on poles were croaking, as it were, a premonition something bad happen)

Sinon:
(In her mind) As soon as Death Gun's gone, we'll be enemies again. I'll shoot him? Beat him? And then... forget him. Whatever, it's not like I'll ever see him again after this...

(Sinon was shot from somewhere. A thorn just alike paralyzed Pale Rider were stuck Sinon's right arm. She lost consciousness. A bit later, she opened her eyes. She laid on the ground on her stomach. Her body was paralyzed. She then knew what was happening)

Sinon:
What!? But... Death Gun supposed to be in the stadium...
eh?

(He appeared from nowhere. Death Gun was there)

Sinon:
...!

Death Gun:
Kirito... Wherever you are, it's time I found out if you're the real deal, or fake. I remember how you fought like then, all fury, and rage... If I killed this, friend of yours, and you go to berserk I remember. I'll know it's really you.

Sinon:
He's gotta... kill me?

Death Gun:
Come on, Kirito. Show me. Let's see your fury, your rage... your insane sword. Show me... for old time sake.

(Death Gun made the sign of the cross. While then Sinon was desperately trying to reach her gun on her waist. After the ritual, Death Gun abruptly pulled out his gun. A hand gun he named it Death Gun, When Sinon looked at it, she began shuddering knowing what the model of the gun is)

Sinon:
A type... 54, "Black Star"...!?

(Sinon flashed back the scene the bank robber. The scene when she picked up the gun, and killed the robber)

Sinon:
It's the gun... Why...? Why him...? Why did he have that gun...!?

(Sinon dropped her gun. Death Gun racked the slide of his pistol, then he aimed at her. Sinon saw the robber in the Death Gun's red eye. She felt her blood beginning flowing backward. She was panicked)

Bang.

(The sound of the gun shot echoed in the pitch black darkness)
