  Kirito:
Hey, Yui. See if this will work.

Yui:
...I'm transferring the code!
We're gonna teleport! Daddy, give me your hand!



Yui:
Daddy...?
Daddy!

Kirito:
Yui...?
Where are we?

Yui:
I don't know.
There's no mapping data available.

Kirito:
Then, do you know where Asuna is?

Yui:
Yes.
...She's close.
Very close, in fact.
...Ah!
This way!

Kirito:
...Is this it?
Is this the top of the world tree?
Er...There supposed to be a floating city up here.
There was never any grand quest!
The whole damn things are lie!
He's gonna pay for this...!

Yui:
Nn...

Kirito:
Yeah, I know.
We gotta get Asuna out first here, right?

Yui:
Nn-huh.

Kirito:
Eh...!




Yui:
Mommy!
...Mommy!

Asuna:
Oh...!

Yui:
Mommy!

Asuna:
Yui!

Yui:
Mommy!

Asuna:
Yui...

Yui:
Mommy...Mommy!

Asuna:
Kirito...

Kirito:
Asuna...
Hey, sorry I took so long.

Asuna:
Nn-nh, no, it's OK.
Really, I always knew you'd save me...

Kirito:
Well, ready to go home?

Asuna:
Nn-huh...

Kirito:
Hey, Yui.
Can you log out Asuna from here?

Yui:
Uh-uh...Her status is locked by complicated code that I don't access to.
We need to find a system console to bypass them.

Asuna:
I saw a console in a laboratory!
I, I can---
What's that?!

Kirito:
Ugh...
Yui! What's happening...?!

Yui:
Daddy! Mommy!
Be careful!
Something...something bad's coming!

Kirito, Asuna:
Yui!

Kirito:
Ugg...Asuna...!

Oberon:
What a surprise...
The last thing that I expected to find was a cockroach in my little birds cage.

Kirito:
You got...kidding!
It's Sugo!

Oberon:
Nn-nh...I prefer you didn't call me that name in this world.
You should address me as highness, the Fairy King...Oberon!

Asuna:
Kirito!

Oberon:
How do you like it?
Why don't know why you can't move?
It's a little something called Gravity Magic.
Coming out a next update.
You think the players go for it?

Asuna:
Leave him alone...you coward!

Oberon:
Tell me something, Kirigaya...or, should I call you Kirito instead?
How did you manage to get all the way up here?
I saw strange program running...is that how?

Kirito:
I flew up here...with my wings!

Oberon:
Ha!
Suit yourself.
If you don't want to tell me, that's fine.
I just go ask your mind instead.

Kirito:
What...?

Oberon:
Oh, please...
You don't really think I went all that trouble, setting this whole thing up just for a fun, did you?
I have three hundred former players of SAO under my thumb.
And now, thanks for their dedicated cooperation, the technology I developed for a totally control of emotions and thoughts is eighty percent of complete!
I'm about to achieve what no one else has!
The total control of the human soul!
The power of the god!
It's so close I can almost taste it...
Seriously, thank god for virtual reality, er...?
Uhe hee hee hee hee...Ah ha ha ha ha ha...!

Kirito:
Sugo...!

Asuna:
You never can get away with this...
You hear...?
You're a monster!

Oberon:
Urm, who do you think's going stop me?
Oh...maybe a god?
But, sadly, there's none in this world...except yours truly!

Asuna:
Uu...

Oberon:
I know! Before I start tinkling with your little souls, why don't we have ourselves a little fun?!

Asuna:
Huh...?

Kirito:
You bastard!
Leave her alone!

Oberon:
Ahh...hee hee...
Ha ha...Yes!
Ha ha...! Great! Ha!
That's what I was hoping for!
You can't get NPC girls to make faces like that...
Ahh...you smell lovely...
Figuring out how to replicate the way you smell in real life...was a challenge.
And donning even get me started on her...hard it to get an analyzer in your hospital room and detect it...

Kirito:
Get away from her!
...Su...go...!

Oberon:
Tsk!
Give me a break...
Why don't you stay down on a globe like a good little dog?!

Kirito:
Ugh!

Oberon:
Ah ha ha ha...
Urah!

Asuna:
Kirito!

Oberon:
System command!
Change the pain observer!
From level 10...to level 8.

Kirito:
Ughaaah!

Oberon:
Hee hee hee hee!
Hurt, doesn't it?
Got increased the pain, glad to me give you something look forward to...
By the way, once it drop to low level 3, it'll start affecting your body in the real world.
As, for you...hmm huu huu hmm...

Kirito:
Stop it...Sugo...!

Asuna:
It's OK, Kirito...What ever he does, he's not really hurting me...

Oberon:
Ha ha ha ha...!
I was hoping you'd say that.
But I wonder how long your pride's going to last?
Thirty minutes...?
Or, and hour...?!
Why don't we see how long you can hang on through it!
...Nn, fu fu...Now that, that's out of the way.
Would you like to know what I'm thinking...?
Once we had a fun here...I'm going to pay you a visit at the hospital...
I'll set up big monitor, and play back recording of this...
And we can enjoy yourselves all over again...
But this time...with your real body...

Asuna:
Huh...!

Oberon:
Ha ha ha ha ha....
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha...!
Er...
Yummy! How sweet!

Kirito:
Sugo!
Ugg...Bastard!
...YOU BASTARD!

Oberon:
Hee hee hee hee...Haa haa haa haa!

Kirito:
I'll kill you...!
You hear!
I'm gonna kill you!




Kirito:
...Why is this happening...?
Am I being punished thinking I was some kind a hero...?
For thinking I was the only one who could save Asuna...?
For thinking I was strong enough...?
Even though I'm not...

Unknown:
Are you giving up?
...Are you giving up?

Kirito:
...No.
I'm facing reality.

Unknown:
Then you are giving up.
To the power of the system you want to fight.

Kirito:
What choice do I have...?
I'm just a player...
And, he's the GM...

Unknown:
Then, our battle was...what?
A joke?
...Do you remember how you showed me the power of the human will?
Were superior to the system.
How you showed me the possibilities of the future?

Kirito:
You are...?!

Unknown:
Get up, Kirito.
Get up!




Kirito:
Your...attack's so weak.
The braids in SAO hit...way harder!
...And, they were way more...

Oberon:
Unbelievable...
I've gotta few bugs after deal with.

Kirito:
System log in...
ID: "Heathcliff"

Oberon:
Wh...what?!
Who's ID you're using...?!

Kirito:
System command: "enable administrative privileges"
"set id:'Oberon' to level 1"

Oberon:
An ID that outranks mine?
That's impossible!
This is my world...I'm the creator!
I'm it's ruler...It's king! It's god!

Kirito:
No...I don't think so.
You stole everything in this world.
Everything! Including it's people!
You're nothing but a king of thieves, who sitting alone on your throne!

Oberon:
You...little punk!
You dare...!
You date talk to me like that?!
Ugg...System command!: "generate object ID:'Excalibur'"...!
...Do as I say! You piece of crap!
System! You god is ordering you to comply!

Kirito:
Think you can get little longer...?
This only take a sec.

Asuna:
Nn-huh...

Kirito:
System command!: "generate object ID:'Excalibur'"...!
...Oh, simple command someone's legendary weapon...who knew?
It's time to settle the score.
The King of Thieves...versus the Gilded Hero!
System command: "set pain observer to 0"

Oberon:
No...not that!

Kirito:
Did you just flinch?
Cause the other guy never flinch, no matter how bad thing's gone.
You know him, "Akihiko Kayaba"!

Oberon:
Oh my god...!
Kayaba...?!
Oh, I get it...That was his ID!
Why...you supposed to be dead. Why are you still getting in my way?!
You were always doing this...!
Acting all how almighty...like some big shot!
Taking everything that was right in my mind!

Kirito:
Sugo.
In a way, I give where you coming from.
I lost him, too.
And then I outwork for him.
But, whatever happened, I never want to be him...unlike you.

Oberon:
Damn you...God damn you!
...Eww!

Kirito:
Hurts, doesn't it?
But it's nothing like the pain you made Asuna feel...
NOT EVEN CLOSE!

Oberon:
Aaahhhg!
My hand! My hand...my hand!
...Aaaahhhhggg!
Aaaaaaah!

Kirito:
...

Asuna:
I had faith in you...
I have faith in you.
Always have, always will...
And, I know you always save me...because you are my hero.

Kirito:
I...I don't have any power...
I'm not a hero...
Hah...but...I'll do my best, to be one.

Asuna:
Nn-huh.

Kirito:
Come on, let's go home...
It's gotta be night time already back there, but I'll see you at the hospital as soon as I can.

Asuna:
I'll be waiting for you.
I want you to be the first person I see when I wake up.
...It's finally over, isn't it?
We're going home.
Back to the real world...

Kirito:
That's right.
But a lot's change, so try not to freak out.

Asuna:
Let's go places and do fun things, just the two of us.
Sound good?

Kirito:
Yeah, real good.
...That's it.
Game over.
Or is it...what do you think? Heathcliff?

Kayaba's echo:
Good to see you again, Kirito.

Kirito:
So, you are alive...

Kayaba's echo:
You could say I'm alive...in a way.
Ultimately, I'm after image of the mind that was Akihiko Kayaba...An echo.

Kirito:
And...as usual, I have no idea what you talking about.
I guess, I thank you though.

Kayaba's echo:
That's not necessary.

Kirito:
What do you mean?

Kayaba's echo:
We're not exactly friends, so we shouldn't expect favors from each other.
There's always a price.
Always.

Kirito:
Okay, what do you want me to do?
...What's this?

Kayaba's echo:
The beginnings of the new world.
I called it "the Seed."
...Once it sprouts, you'll know what it is.
What you do it is up to you.
You can even delete it if you want.
However, if you still have a tiny bit of fondness left on virtual world, you'll take care of it.
I should get going now.
I do hope we meet again, Kirito.




Kirito:
Yui, are you okay?
Where are you?!

Yui:
Daddy!

Kirito:
Thank god...you're safe.

Yui:
Uh-huh.
I hid myself inside the local memory of your Nerve Gear rig.
...Where's mommy?

Kirito:
Don't worry, she's safe.
She's back home now.

Yui:
Mommy's back?!
Thank goodness...I'm so happy...Really!

Kirito:
I promised we'll be back to visit soon.
Although, I don't know how much longer this world will gonna be around.

Yui:
It doesn't matter because my code program's inside your Nerve Gear now.
So, we'll always be together!

Kirito:
Nn. Alright, I better head out.
I'm gonna see mommy.

Yui:
OK, daddy.
...I love you!




Suguha:
Oh...Ah!
I, I'm sorry...!
When you didn't log out right away, I got worried then, I---uh...

Kazuto:
Sorry I took so long to come back.

Suguha:
I-Is it really over now...?

Kazuto:
Yeah...it is.
It's all over.

Suguha:
Oh...that's awesome!

Kazuto:
Hey, Sugu---Thank you for all the help you gave me.
I couldn't have done it on my own.
You're the reason I was able to finish it.

Suguha:
No...
You don't have to thank me for a thing.
I'm just happy I gotta chance to help my big brother and his world.
...Huh...nn...
What happen with Asuna?
Did you get her back?

Kazuto:
Uh-huh. Finally.
She's back in the real world.
Sugu...I, er...

Suguha:
Uh-uh, you get going.
She's gotta be wondering where her up by now.




Kazuto:
Oh...It's cold!

Suguha:
Look...snow.

Kazuto:
Huh...

Suguha:
Be careful out there!
And, say hi to Asuna for me.

Kazuto:
You got it!
I can't wait you guys to meet for real!
