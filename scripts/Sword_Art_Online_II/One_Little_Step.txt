  (Shino's house. Shino ran to the door to get out of the house, turned a door lock, and pulled a door chain. Then, Shinkawa caught Shino)

Shinkawa:
A...Asada...!

Shino:
No! Let go of me! No!

(Shinkawa mounted on Shino. He repeatedly shouted Shino's surname)

Shinkawa:
Asada! Asada! Asada! Asada! Asada! Asada...!

(Then, someone barged into Shino's house. He kicked up Shinkawa's face, and he and Shinkawa started to scuffle with)

(Unknown):
Run Sinon!

(Shino glanced his profile. She realized the boy who barged in was Kirito when he was in the real world)

Shino:
Kirito...!?

Shinkawa:
Ugg...! What the hell! Get off me! Bastard... It's all your fault! She's mine... She's mine! Damn it! Stay away from her!

(Shinkawa gave his fist to Kazuto(Kirito) without a break. Kazuto could do nothing but guard his face. Shinkawa pulled out the syringe that could stop people's lung and heart)

Shino:
Kirito!

(Shinkawa push the syringe against Kazuto's chest, put the drug contained in the syringe off. Shino ran into the room, grabbed a stereo boombox that sit on the small table, threw it on Shinkawa's head. Shinkawa knocked out. The empty syringe rolled down on the floor)

Shino:
Kirito...

Kazuto(Kirito):
He got me... It happened so fast... Didn't even see the needle...

Shino:
I know! I'm gonna take a look, OK!?

(Shino opened Kazuto's jacket. She saw some liquid wet Kazuto's shirt around his chest)

Shino:
Hang on! I'm not gonna let you die like this!

(Shino turned up Kazuto's shirt. There is some attachment stuck on his chest)

Shino:
Eh...?

(Shino got a piece of tissue paper, and drained the liquid carefully from his chest. Shino touched her hand on Kazuto's chest. She felt his heart's still beating)

Shino:
Um... hey... you've got this weird... thing, on your chest.

Kazuto:
...Huh?

(Kazuto, who almost got unconscious to fear of death, opened his eye, looked down on his chest)

Kazuto:
um... Please tell me that were hit me with the needle...?

Shino:
It looks like that I guess... What is that thing anyway?

Kazuto:
Ah... It's one of the electrodes from this heart monitor I was hooked up to...

Shino:
Heart... monitor!?

Kazuto:
Never mind. You know, you scared the hell out of me.

Shino:
I scared you!? How do you think I feel! I thought you were gonna die just now! You dumb-ass!

Kazuto:
Ugh! Hey! Easy...!

(Shino lost her strength. Kirito tried to support Shino's shoulder, but she refrained it. Shino took deep breath. Then, she looked at Shinkawa who lay on the floor)

Kazuto:
He's not... dead, is he?

(Shino put her finger on Shinkawa's wrist to check his pulse)

Shino:
Nah, he's still got a pulse.

(Shino was watching Shinkawa for a while. Silence filled the room)

Shino:
You're crazy. But thank you for coming over.

Kazuto:
No, thank you for clocking him, you did. I'm sorry I couldn't get you sooner...

(Shino looked at Kazuto's face over again. She saw Kirito's face as in GGO on his)

Kazuto:
Er... You okay?

Shino:
Mm-hm...

(Shino lowered her face, began crying. Kazuto place his hand on Shino's shoulder)




(High school, backyard. Shino looked up at the sky. The clouds were moving fast in the fine blue sky. Three girls, who tried to shake down from Shino before, appeared. Shino lifted up her muffler)

Shino:
Next time you wanna meet, be on time.

Girl A:
eh...Seriously? Ha... Girl, you've been acting way too cocky lately.

Girl B:
She's right, we should teach you a lesson.

Girl C:
No, you guys, it's cool. We're friends here, right? It's good to have friends. They come in real handy, especially when you need a loan.

Girl A and B:
(Chuckles)

Girl C:
Speaking of, I need 20k, buddy.

(Shino lifted her shaking hand, put her glasses off)

Shino:
I told you before, I'm not lending you guys any money.

Girl C:
...You'll change your mind after I show you what my brother gave me.

Shino:
I doubt it.

Girl C:
Humph.

(Girl C pulled out a handgun from her school bag. She aimed at Shino with her gun)

Girl C:
Get this. He told me not to point this of anyone, but what is he know? I mean, you've seen one before. So, it doesn't bug you, right? Or, does it, Asada...?

(Shino felt her blood flowing backward. She was about getting panicked)

Girl C:
Get on your knees, and say you're sorry!

(Shino gazed the gun's round muzzle hole. Girl A and B mocked Shino as if she'd thrown up)

Girl A an B:
Wheeah!

(Shino's blood current continued flowing backward. She had flashback of the robber's dying face, the pool of blood of his. Girl C tried to pull the trigger, but she failed)

Girl C:
...? Crap, it's not working! Urg...

(Girl C struggled to make her gun shoot. Watching it Shino sighed and grabbed Girl C's wrist, snatched the gun from her)

Girl C:
Aw!

Shino:
...Government-issue M1911. Your brother has good taste. It's not really my style, though. In for future reference, it only fires when the safety's off.

Girl A and B:
er...?

(Shino aimed a can on the bucket, the distance was about ten meters from her, shot. The BB sized plastic projectile hit the can. The can flew from the top of the bucket. Shino turned herself to Girl C)

Girl C:
H-hey... Wow.

Shino:
Your brother's right. You shouldn't point this at people.

(After she locked again it's safety, Shino handed the gun back to Girl C)

Shino:
Here.

Girl C:
Eh...?

(Girl C fell down on the ground. Girl A and B took care of Girl C while Shino was leaving from the site)

Girl A and B:
Oh my god, are you OK...?
Come on... get up, Endo...?

Shino:
See you around.

(After Shino left from the girls, she put her hand on the wall, panted, crouched herself)

Shino:
...I say, the first step is always the hardest.

(Shino took her step, walked to out of the school. At the entrance gate of the school, Kazuto waited with his motor bike. A half dozen girls from the school gathered around, kept distance from him. They were muttering)

Shino:
Huh...?

Girl D:
Hey, Asada! Do you know that guy?

Girl E:
Is he your boy friend?

(Shino silently walked to Kazuto)

Girl D and E:
Oh~!?

(Kazuto looked up at the sky. Shino soliloquized)

Shino:
Really? When I said I meet you, I didn't think you park yourself in front of my school...!

Kazuto:
Hm? Oh! What's up, Sinon?

Shino:
Umm...



(Tokyo, Ginza. Somewhere fancy cafe. Kazuto and Shino were invited by Kikuoka. Kikuoka bowed to them for the contribution to the resolution of the incident. Followings are Kazuto's narration)

Kazuto:
Kyoji Shinkawa, and his older brother Shoichi, were arrested. During interrogation, it came out another person was involved. This third Death Gun, Atsushi Kanamoto, he's still out there. But, Kikuoka says they'll catch him soon enough. They got the idea creating Death Gun character when Shoichi got the invisibility cloak through real money trade. Using cloak with some binoculars, Shoichi started stealing the real world info of the other players. Meanwhile, his little brother Kyoji was having issues with his avatar, Spiegel...

(The scene changed to GGO, XeXeeD spoke in MMO stream)
XeXeeD:
These players who think it's all about agility... Heh, man! They are living in a dream!

Kazuto:
Spiegel was an AGI type. Which XeXeeD used to recommend. But XeXeeD shifted his status to STR-VIT combo, and that pissed Kyoji off. When Shoichi found out, he gave Kyoji XeXeeD's name, and address IRL. Then, they started talking about how to kill. They say, they wasn't serious about it first. But, day after day, the more they talked about it, the more it seemed they could get away with it.
For their plan to work, they needed two things from their dad's hospital. A master key card used to open doors of emergencies, and the lethal drug for the deed. They researched their victims carefully, nailed on the list down to the ones who lived alone and low security apartments.
Using the key card, Shoichi broke in to the first victim's place. Shigemura, a.k.a. XeXeeD. The brother's worked out exact time he was supposed to die, when Kyoji logged in with his brother's avatar, Sterben, and announced himself as Death Gun, and shot XeXeeD. The second victim, Usushio Tarako, was killed the same way.
But instead of being scared of Death Gun, the other players in GGO treated it like some kind of joke. Shoichi and his partners were furious. So, they decided to kill some players during the BoB final. They found three who met the same criteria as XeXeeD and Tarako. Pale Rider, Garrett, and Sinon.

(Cafe. Shino was flabbergasted from the explanation, maybe given by Kikuoka. Kazuto lowered his coffee cup and placed it on the saucer)

Kazuto:
Killing three people was gonna make things hard for just the two of them, though.

Kikuoka:
Yeah... To be in think with Death Gun, the person do in the real world killing had to make sure they'd be each target's house on time.

Kazuto:
So, they recruited that Kanamoto guy you told me about to be "the Third Death Gun." Where'd they find him, though?

Kikuoka:
Simple, Kanamoto was an old friend of Shoichi's. They were both part of Laughing Coffin in SAO. We found out that his handle was Johnny Black. That sound familiar?

Kazuto:
...Yeah, he worked with XaXa. I think his weapon of choice was a poison knife.

Kikuoka:
They put Kanamoto on Pale Rider and Garrett. Because he lived in nearby. Sinon, on the other hand, was Kyoji's. Shi-, Shoichi was the one who usually did the killing, but for this one job, Kyoji insisted on being a one to do it.

Shino:
Um...

Kikuoka:
Hm?

Shino:
Is that he wanted? for real? Did Shinka-, I mean, Kyoji say that?

Kikuoka:
No, his brother was the one who gave us all the detail of the plan. Kyoji still refused to talk.

Shino:
He does, huh...

(Kikuoka pulled out his tablet computer from his bag)

Kikuoka:
Speaking of, we found out little more about Shoichi. Healthwise, he's been sickly since child hood. His father pretty much gave up on him, so he decided early on to hand hospital over to Kyoji.

(Shino reminded Shinkawa saluted to her in cafe the other time)
Shinkawa(Kyoji):
Stay in sharp! Ma'am! Rocked and loaded!

Shino:
...

Kikuoka:
Even so, the brothers seems to be close growing up. But Shoichi got obsessed with MMORPGs, and... 2022, he'd got trapped in Sword Art Online.

Kazuto:
...

Kikuoka:
After he got out, Shoichi only spoke to Kyoji about it. He bragged about how in that world, he was a real mass murderer, and how he was feared. In Kyoji's eyes, his big brother was a hero. As for Shoichi, he's sticking with the stories everything about the Death Gun concept, including the murders, was just part of the game. But the actions here, like gathering intel on victim's, prepping for the murders, and committing them, were no different in SAO.

Kazuto:
The dark side of VRMMOs. ...That's what it is. His reality, got lot less real.

Kikuoka:
Yeah, good point. And, how are you handling yours?

Kazuto:
I feel like I left the part of me back in SAO. So right now, there's less of me here isn't I was before... I don't know.

Kikuoka:
You don't know? ...Do you wanna go back?

Kazuto:
Seriously? How could you ask me that?

Shino:
Um... Wait a sec. You're kind contradicting like you told me the other day.

Kazuto:
What?

Shino:
You said, there's no such thing a virtual world, remember? That like wherever you were, that's your reality. Where I am right now, here. This world is my reality. And even if you told me this was a virtual world, if it still be reality to me. ...You see what I mean?

Kazuto:
I guess... Yeah, you're right. I got a hand it to you Sinon, what you said just now might be the only good thing to come out of this nightmare.

Shino:
No, put a sock in it! ...er.

Kikuoka:
...Sorry, I'm with Kirito on this one. Well, I told you pretty much all we found out so far. Do you have any questions before I go?

Shino:
I do. Has that in any word on what's gonna happen to Kyoji yet?

Kikuoka:
Umm... Based on brother's confession, and their behavior, they'll almost likely be sent to a medical detention center. I doubt he's a one knows what the reality is anymore.

Shino:
No. I don't think that's true.

Kikuoka:
Hm?

Shino:
I don't know anything about Kyoji's brother. I never met him. But I've known Kyoji a long time, and, well... I think his reality was Gun Gale Online. He pretty much give him up on this world. There was nothing left for him other than GGO, so he made that his reality. He'd spent hours in it. Grinding away, boosting his exp, and trying to be the best. I guess, the stress got to be too much for him.

Kikuoka:
From playing a game? I know you can lose track of time but, reality?

Shino:
Sure! It's some point, Kyoji just swapped out the one for the other, his real life, for the virtual one.

Kikuoka:
Okay... But, why?

Shino:
I don't know... But I wish I did... Kirito, why do you think he did it?

Kazuto:
...To get stronger.

Shino:
You're right. I guess, I was the same way. When it comes down to, it maybe all us VRMMO players are the same. All we want is to get stronger... Mr Kikuoka? I'd like to go see him, is that all right? There's so much I wanna tell him, like what we were just talking about, and other stuff I've been thinking... If it's OK!

Kikuoka:
Nn(Nod), you're strong person they want to. And, I for one, think it's a great idea. He cannot have visitors yet, but when he can, I'll let you know. Oh, I have to get back to the office now.

Kazuto:
Okay. Thanks for taking the time.

Shino:
Yes, thank you for talking to us.

Kikuoka:
Don even mention it. You guys risked your lives and god-knows how many you've saved. It's the least I could do.

(Kikuoka stood from the chair)

Kikuoka:
Oh? By the way, Kirito.

Kazuto:
Um?

Kikuoka:
Death Gun... or, Shoichi Shinkawa, or "Red-Eyed" XaXa ...whatever you want to call him, asked me to give you a message. If you don't wanna hear it, said no word and I'll tear it up.

Kazuto:
...I'll hear it.

Kikuoka:
You've got it.

(Kikuoka read aloud the message Shoichi Shinkawa wrote)

Kikuoka:
Here, ahem, "If you think this is over, it's not. You don't have what it takes to end this. Sooner or later, you'll realize that. It's show time." ...That's it.



(Outside of the cafe. Over an intersection, Kikuoka waived his arm to say good bye. Shino bowed to him to thank his treatment)

Kazuto:
Hey! Er...Sinon?

Shino:
Hm? What's up?

Kazuto:
Are you...free, right now?

(Shino gave Kazuto dubious look)

Shino:
What do you mean, "free?" Free for what?



(Dicey Cafe, where Agil running cafe/bar)

Shino:
So...this is where you've taken me?

Kazuto:
Yap, there is someone inside I want you to meet.

(Kazuto opened the entrance door. Inside the cafe, there are Asuna, Rika(Lizbeth). And Agil was behind the counter)

Rika:
Well, it's about time. You made us wait so during long, I wouldn't had two slices of apple pie! If I get fat, it's all your fault!

Kazuto:
How's that my fault? geez...

Asuna:
Come on, Kirito. Are you gonna introduce her or what?

Kazuto:
huh? Oh, right, sorry. This is Shino Asada, a.k.a. Sinon. Gun Gale Online's third super champ.

Shino:
Oh...Don't say that.

(Asuna and Rika seemed peevish)

Kazuto:
Um? ...Ahem. These, are my friends for my time in SAO. Rika, a.k.a. Liz, Black Smith and swindler.

Rika:
Huh!? What The Hell Do You Call Me!?

(Rika sprung on Kirito, but Kirito effortlessly dodged it)

Kazuto:
And, that's Asuna, the berserk healer. Real name, Asuna Yuki.

Asuna:
Eh...Berserk?

Shino:
Urm...

Kazuto:
Do you wanna grab a seat and get something to drink?

(They got their seat. Two glasses of lemonade or something were front of them)

Shino:
That's what Star- er, I mean, Sterben means? A term hospital so use for death... What was he thinking giving his avatar in name like that.

Asuna:
If I were you, I wouldn't try to find some deeper meaning of the name he gave his avatar. A lot of times, that boils down to whatever the player think sounds cool.

Rika:
Oh, that explains it. This all time, I thought you gave your avatar your name, because your lacked imagination.

Asuna:
Said this!

Rika:
Ouch!

(Asuna hit Rika with her elbow. Rika seemed she got hurt)

Asuna:
I do so have imagination! Lots of it!

Rika:
Okay, jeez...

Asuna:
What ever...

(Shino smiled. Perhaps, this is her first smile since she came into the cafe. Asuna and Rika recognized her smile. Asuna smiled back to her)

Shino:
Er...

Rika:
So! Anyway, I'm super stoked you here! It's always cool to meet another girl VRMMO player.

Asuna:
You said it! I hope we can be great friends, Asada.

Shino:
Eh...um...

(Shino became silent. They could hear the sound which from Agil wiping the glass with cloth. Asuna glanced Kazuto, and nodded)

Asuna:
...Listen, Asada. ...Shino. There's another reason for asking you to come here today.

Shino:
W-what is it?

Kazuto:
Sinon, I'm sorry to put you on the spot like this. I, er...I told Asuna and Liz about what happened to you when you were younger.

Shino:
Wha---!?

Kazuto:
I...didn't have a choice. I-I needed their help.

Shino:
H-huh...?

Asuna:
I'll explain. We wanted to help you. So, we paid visit to the town you used to live.

Shino:
...! How could you... Why would you do that!

(Shino outraged, stood from the seat and tried to leave. Kazuto held her arm cloth)

Kazuto:
Wait, Sinon. They found someone who wants to meet you. I can't let you leave to you hear what they have to say. It might hurt, and, I'm sorry. But I can't stand by if there's a chance what they say helps.

Shino:
Wh-who is this person...? Wha-what are they wanna tell me...?

(Kazuto sent a signal to Risa. She opened the door back in the room, and welcomed someone waiting behind it. A woman and a little girl entered into the room. Shino sat back the chair. The woman and the girl sat across the table from Sinon. The woman would be the girl's mother. She bowed to Shino, and the girl watching it imitated what the woman did)

Shino:
Sorry...do I know you?

Sachie:
Sachie Osawa. You're Shino... Asada, aren't you? I would like to introduce you to my daughter. Her name's Mizue. She's five years old. I don't know if you remember, but I used to work at the post office.

Shino:
...!

(Shino reminded the scene at the post office, when the robber pointed his gun of a woman. She recollected her face)

Shino:
...Ah...!

Sachie:
I'm sorry. This is really hard...see, I...I should've done this ages ago. I'm so sorry took this long. I never apologized, or thank you for what you did...

(Sachie dropped tears while she talked to Shino. She reached her hand to her daughter's head, stroking girls head)

Sachie:
I was pregnant with her the day that man came and try to rob us. What you did, it wasn't just my life you saved. You saved my little girl, too. Thank you so much... If there weren't you, she wouldn't be here.

Shino:
I saved...your daughter?

Kazuto:
Sinon, time to let go. You've been blaming yourself way too long, beating yourself up of what happened. I'm not saying you're wrong to do that, but...It's just, whatever guilt you feel about what you did, you've got a right to consider the lives you saved, too. You've got the right...to think about those people and forgive yourself. That's it. That's I wanted you to know.

Shino:
...

(Mizue, the young girl who wear her kinder garden uniform for looking herself more formal, stood from the chair, approaching to Shino. Mizue pulled out a picture she drew herself with her crayon from her school bag, gave it to Shino. In the picture, there's a letters wrote. It could read "To big sis Shino")

Shino:
Ah...

Muzue:
I made it for you. Thank you for saving mommy. And, for saving me! We love you! Hee hee!

(Perhaps, Mizue had prepared and rehearsed several times to say those lines for today. Her speaking was sometimes lispy, but Shino's tears run down her face. Mizue placed her hand on Shino's. She smiled, and Shino smiled back to her. In the scene, Sinon stood with her backward-facing, armed. She placed, stood her rifle on the ground, then released it from her hand. Shino instead held Mizue's hands with both her hands)

[The end of episode]

(The following is a translation of the ending theme, Startear. Translator unknown yet)

Much stronger.
I wish to become stronger.
To overcome this sadness.

Countless times, I've turned my back
on the past I couldn't change.
I can't show this to anyone.
So I hid it at all times.

This overflowing pain,
I carry it all by myself.
If this warmth is to disappear one day,
then I don't need any.

Much stronger.
I wish to become stronger.
Like the lonely star,
which flies trough the darkness.

I suppressed it deep down in my heart.
My weak and fragile self.
I can't put it into words.
Neither can I convey it.

Surely, I'm hiding so no one will find me.
While waiting for that light.
