  Leafa:
Wooooaaaaaahhhh!

Kirito:
We see exit!

Leafa:
Woaaah!? Wow! Ah! Haa...
Are you trying to kill me?!

Kirito:
No, just trying to save us some time.

Leafa:
You're in shortcuts...Eh?

Kirito:
Er, Wait a sec. Do you whether know where's this meeting happening?

Leafa:
Yeah, I'll check...Urm...Northwest, inside that mountain.

Kirito:
How much time we've got?

Leafa:
Twenty minutes.

Kirito:
I'm not going fast enough.




Kirito:
I wish we can go faster, because this rate, we're not gonna make it for the Salamanders.

Leafa:
I know. Even if we can one, it doesn't make commanders out in time. We might just end up dying with them all in battle.

Kirito:
...

Yui:
I've got player readings! Sixty-eight of them flying in formation! For what I can tell, It could be the Salamander's attack squad!
There are fourteen more players on platform. Most likely, they are the diplomats of Sylph's, and Cait Sith's. The two groups of players will make contact in fifty seconds.

Leafa:
We didn't make it after all... Thanks for trying, Kirito. But this is far enough. I'm getting try and save Sakuya. Get out of here and head for the World Tree. We didn't get hand out for a long, but it was fun. Hope we'd make it again someday.

Kirito:
...Sorry, but running away from fight is not really my style.

Leafa:
Huh...?




Guards of Sylph's or Cait Sith's:
Oh...Why are these Salamanders here...?

Kirito:
Salamanders! Stand out!

Salamander's squad:
Er...
Who's that...?

Leafa:
Sakuya!

Sakuya:
Leafa! What are you doing here?!

Leafa:
It's too complicated get into now... But you see that guy out there, believe it or not, the fates of our races depend on his next move.

Sakuya:
You have got to be kidding...

Kirito:
I wanna talk to your commander!

Eugene:
...What the hell is Spriggan like you doing here? I'm gonna kill you no matter what your answer. But, since your brave enough to face me I might as well hear you out.

Kirito:
My name is Kirito. I'm an ambassador of the Spriggan-Undine alliance. Since you're on offensive today, I'm assuming you wanna way to for on war between all our races.

Sakuya & Alicia:
Huh? Urm...

Leafa:
Er...?! Nn nn nn...!

Eugene:
The Undines allied with the Spriggans, huh? And, you're supposed be their ambassador, but you've come here without a guard?

Kirito:
Yeah! That's right! So what?! I was sent here for negotiate trade term with the Sylph and the Cait Sith. But if you interrupt our talks, you're gonna get to fear some serious hard. All of our races are gonna team up, and will bring the fight straight to the Salamanders!

Eugene:
You're kidding me, right? You are all alone, and you've got crappy gear. So there's no way you could be anyone ambassador...If you can survive my attacks for thirty seconds, then I'll believe you what you say you are.

Kirito:
Gee, thanks. That's quite a generous.

Sakuya:
This is bad...

Leafa:
Why?

Sakuya:
Do you see that Salamander's sword? It's the Demon Sword Gram. You need a two handed sword skill of nine fifty to equip it.

Leafa:
N-nine-hundred fifty?!

Sakuya:
Yes. And, there's only one person I know who can use it. General Eugene. Have you heard of him?

Leafa:
Yeah...I know the name.

Sakuya:
He's the younger brother of Mortimer, the leader of the Salamanders. They're brothers in real life, too. Mortimer's a brilliant strategist, but in terms of sheer power, they say Eugene's the game's strongest player.

Leafa:
Oh no...he is the strongest player...? Kirito...

Eugene:
Haaah!

Leafa:
Ah! ...But what was that?!

Alicia:
"The Ethereal Shift," The sword's bonus skill! Whenever someone tries to block with a shield or a sword, the Demonic Sword Gram can phase through it!

Leafa:
Really?! No way!

Kirito:
Ooooa!

Eugene:
Ha ha...I can't believe you're not dead!

Kirito:
What the hell kind of attack was that!

Eugene:
Hoom!

Kirito:
Damn, he's good... Hey big red, I think that thirty sec's were up by now?

Eugene:
I've changed my mind. I decided to kill you, anyway. Now you after survive until I do.

Kirito:
Yeah, that figures. But I won't go down that easy!

Sakuya:
This won't end well...They both seem equally skilled fighters. But Eugene's weapon is far superior.

Leafa:
He can do it...Kirito can beat him, and I know it!

Kirito:
Ug...Rah!

Eugene:
...?!

Kirito:
I need to borrow this for a sec.

Leafa:
Wow! ...Ki-kirito? ...Oh?!

Eugene:
...A few seconds, that's all you for!

Alicia:
Hey! Where did he go?!

Guard of Cait Sith's:
Do you think...He ran away?!

Leafa:
Of course he didn't!

Kirito:
As long as I'm alive, I'm not gonna let anyone in my party die. I won't let that happen again!

Leafa:
Kirito would never run away and leave us...

Eugene:
Umm...?!

Leafa:
Ah...Kirito!

Eugene:
Tsch...! Raah!

Kirito:
Ooooohhh...!

Eugene:
Gwah! ...Dieeee! Ugh...!

Kirito:
Wraaaah!

Sakuya:
Splendid! Marvelous!

Alicia:
That was the most amazing fight ever!

Sakuya:
Nicely done Spriggan!

Salamander's squad:
...Whoa...
...That was good!
...Yes, seriously...

Leafa:
Oh...Ah!



Sakuya:
Um...

Eugene:
Urm... You're an excellent fighter. In fact, you're the most powerful player I've ever seen. Well done.

Kirito:
You're not so bad yourself.

Eugene:
I didn't know the Spriggan had someone like you in their ranks. This world's a bigger place than I thought.

Kirito:
All we cool, then? Will you withdraw?

Eugene:
Hmm...

Kagemune:
Eugene! May I have a word?

Eugene:
Kagemune, what is it?

Leafa:
Uhh! Him again...!

Kagemune:
Ah...Then, next time, I'll make sure to bring more friends along...

Kagemune:
You might find this interesting. You know how my party was wiped out yesterday?

Eugene:
So?

Kagemune:
Well, this Spriggan, he's the same guy who took everyone out. And, he was traveling with Undine...

Eugene:
Hmm...Interesting. Then, I guess I have to believe you...But just for the record, the last thing our leader and I want to go to war with the Spriggans and the Undines. We withdraw for now, but I'm gonna be looking forward to fighting you again.

Kirito:
Then, that makes two of us.



Kirito:
I guess, some Salamanders can be cool, after all. Who knew?

Leafa:
You really are insane. You know that?

Kirito:
Yeah, I get that a lot.

Leafa:
Ah ha ha...

Sakuya:
Ahem...excuse me, but could either of you explain what's going on?

...

Sakuya:
I see. I could tell there's something off about Sigurd's attitude recently... He seems so irritated.

Leafa:
Irritated...? About what?

Sakuya:
My guess, he was dissatisfied about status things. That in terms of power, he couldn't accept he follow behind Salamanders. Power's very important to the man like Sigurd. And, not just his ability and his character status, but as also as a player. He craves power.

Leafa:
Yeah...But even so, why would he turn to be spy for Salamanders?

Sakuya:
It must have something to do what the 5.0 update that's going to be released soon. I heard the rumor that will be putting a reincarnation system.

Leafa:
...! No way.

Sakuya:
I'm sure Mortimer made him offer "Bring me the head of your leader and reincarnate you as a Salamander."

Leafa:
So, now what..? What will you do, Sakuya...?

Sakuya:
Hmm... Rue, have you raised your dark magic skill yet?

Alicia:
Mm-hm.

Sakuya:
Open a Moon Light Mirror to Sigurd.



Sigurd:
Hmm...fu fu fu...

Sakuya:
Sigurd!

Sigurd:
! Sa-Sakuya!

Sakuya:
Nice to see you, too. Unfortunately, I'm still alive.

Sigurd:
How...er, I-I mean, wh-what happened at the meeting?

Sakuya:
It went very well. There's still a matter signing a treaty, though...

Sigurd:
e-er...

Sakuya:
By the way, we had an unexpected guest.

Sigurd:
Wh-what guest...?

Sakuya:
His name is General Eugene. And, he send his regards...

Sigurd:
Ah...!? Leafa... So, that's it! ...Those incompetent lizards! ...Well, it's your move now, Sakuya. But you are gonna fire me? Or, maybe you wanna take away of my command? If so, remember, without me running your military, your rule won't last very long...

Sakuya:
Actually, I was thinking of granting the request you made them, since you can't stand being Sylph, you're free to go.

Sigurd:
Wait, what!? ...Hold on, are you crazy!? Me...? You-you're vanishing me!?

Sakuya:
I'm letting you live to wander the neutral territory as a renegade. With any luck, you'll find something better to occupy your precious time.

Sigurd:
Ugg...You bit---

Leafa:
Sakuya...?

Sakuya:
Thank you for saving us, Leafa. You've known idea how grateful I am having you around.

Leafa:
Oh...wow, I didn't do anything. If you wanna thank someone, thank Kirito.

Sakuya:
She's right. Whoever you are, you have my thanks.

Alicia:
Hey, handsome? About the Spriggan-Undene ambassador business, you aren't, are you?

Leafa:
Urm...

Kirito:
Yeah, that was a big fat lie! I was bluffing, cunning, you know? Negotiating!

Alicia and Sakuya:
Huh?

Sakuya:
Oh god, you must be insane... You have to be it'll make that stuff of at the last minute?

Kirito:
Yeah, but it did work, didn't it? Whenever I dealt with bad hand, I always raise the pot.

Alicia:
You know? For a big fat liar, you're pretty freakin' strong, handsome! You're like MVP of Spriggans! Are you their secret weapon?

Kirito:
No, of course not. Oh, I am just your friendly neighborhood mercenary.

Alicia:
Nya~ha ha ha ha...! I like the wondering type. Have you ever thought about being a merc for Cait Sith? You'll get three meals a day, plus snacks, and nap!

Leafa:
Huh!?

Sakuya:
So, Kirito... I was thinking... How about we get to know each other little better? I know a cute little pub in Swilvane. My treat...?

Leafa:
Wai---

Alicia:
Ohh, come on, Sakuya! That's not fair! You're totally seducing him with those things...

Sakuya:
I'm seducing him. If you were any closer to him, he'd be wearing you!

Kirito:
Um...heh heh...

Leafa:
Would you guys chill out!? For your information, he's my...urm...I mean, he's um...er...

Kirito:
What?

Leafa:
He's my...eh, never mind...um...

Kirito:
Look, I appreciate the offer really. But the thing is...she promised to take me to the World Tree, so, sorry.

Sakuya:
Really? Oh, well...That is a shame. Are you going there for little sight seeing, Leafa? Or, what?

Leafa:
I'm leaving the Sylphs...or planning on it anyway. But I wanna return to Swilvane some point. I just don't know when that's gonna be...

Sakuya:
Not a problem. I understand. Just make sure you'll come back, OK? And, bring your friend.

Alicia:
On the way back, stop by my place! We'll throw your party!

Leafa:
Mm-hm.

...

Sakuya:
Thank you so muck for coming today. Leafa, Kirito, if you haven't been stop them, the Salamanders become even more powerful than ever. I'd like to pay you back somehow...

Kirito:
Oh no, it was nothing.

Leafa:
Hey, Sakuya, Alicia. Wasn't the point of you guys getting together to make the try for the World Tree?

Sakuya:
Ultimately, yes. That was our goal.

Leafa:
If you okay with it, and it's no trouble, we'd like to go with you. We're kind of hurry to get there, though.

Sakuya and Alicia:
Hmm...

Sakuya:
Well, I can't see why not. In fact, the truth is, we'd be grateful to have you along. But, why are you such a hurry to be get there?

Leafa:
Um...

Kirito:
She's not in a hurry. I'm one who ask to get the top of the tree. I think someone I know is up there...waiting for me.

Sakuya:
Hmm...is it Oberon, the Fairy King?

Kirito:
No, it's not him...It's someone I can't reach in real life. But, in here, I might be able to.

Alicia:
We wanna help, but storming the tree is gonna take some time to set up. We gotta gear up the raiding party and stuff. And, that take us way more than the few days...

Kirito:
I see... Never mind, then. I don't wanna raid the tree like you. I just wanna get the base as soon as possible. So, it's cool. We figured it out. Oh, by the way, maybe this will help you guys get some new gear for your raid.

Alicia:
Um...whoa! ...Wow! Sakuya, look! Checked it out!

Sakuya:
Hmm? Ah!? A hundred thousand pieces of medal of Yrd! ...You don't want it? You could build a castle on prime land with this.

Kirito:
Nah, it's yours. I don't need it anymore.

Alicia:
You are so awesome. With this bag of loot, we've got just about enough for new gear!

Sakuya:
We'll get ready as fast as we can. When we set to go, we'll message you, OK?

Kirito:
Yeah, you got it.

...

Alicia:
Thanks guys! We'll be seeing ya!

Leafa:
...I don't know about you, but I can't believe you pulled that off. ...hm.

Yui:
Oh, honestly! I thought I told you no more flirting, daddy!

Leafa:
Ug...!

Kirito:
I-I wasn't flirting with anyone!

Yui:
When they were close, were clinging to you, I noticed your heartbeat increased.

Kirito:
I'm a guy! That's what happen them grows to get too close!

Yui:
Seriously...!

Leafa:
What about me? I'm a girl... Isn't that a problem?

Yui:
No...you seem pretty safe to me, Leafa.

Leafa:
What are you mean "safe!?"

Kirito and Yui:
Hmm....

Kirito:
I think what she means is, most of the time, you don't really see much like a girl.

Leafa:
O-okay...wow! Say that again, I dare you!

Kirito:
No! ...like, like you easy to get along with. I meant it in good way. heh... yeah!

Leafa:
Ah...

Kirito:
Come on! We soon get ways to go before we get to Alne. The sun starting to go down!

Leafa:
Okay! I'm coming! Wait up! ...heh heh.




Asuna:
Um...Eight, one, one, three, two, three, two, nine.
...Kirito, I promise you. I won't give up.
