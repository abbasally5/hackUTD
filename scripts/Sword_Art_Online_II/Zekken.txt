  (ALfheim Online, Forest House K4. The house was surrounded by newly fallen snow. Asuna and others were in the house)

Asuna:
So, Zekken shows up 3 o'clock on this island on floor twenty four.

Lisbeth:
Mm-hm.

Asuna:
Then, I'll see you guys tomorrow at 2:30.

Leafa, Lisbeth:
Okay.
You got it.

Silica:
I can't wait! This will be so much fun!

Leafa:
Yeah, it will!

Lisbeth:
Oh yeah! The berserk healer's gonna get them reached!

Asuna:
Heh...uh?

(While everyone excited toward next day's bout, Kirito was sitting calmly on the chair, speaking with Yui)

Yui:
Daddy, you have something on your face!

Kirito:
Huh, for real!?

Yui:
Yes, it's covered by ink.

Kirito:
You're kidding!

Yui:
Ha ha ha!

Asuna:
...See you guys tomorrow!

Lisbeth:
Yeah, see ya!

(Asuna opened her console, tapped logout button. She disappeared from ALO, and she in real life regained her consciousness)



(Vvvvmmm...the sound from the machine tapered out. Asuna opened her eyes. She laid on her bed. She turned on a power button on the room's control panel. It displayed room's temperature, 15 Celsius. Asuna exhaled white breath. She opened her closet to change her cloths to attend dinner. Again, she exhaled white breath, looked like heaving sigh this time)



(Asuna was out of her room, walking down stairs. Her outfit was changed from sweat suit to cream colored blouse, long wine red skirt. In the middle of the staircase, she noticed someone at the entrance hall)

Asuna:
Good night Ms. Sada. Thank you for coming. I'm sorry you had to work so late.

Sada:
Not at all, really. Just doing my job, miss.

Asuna:
Do you know if my mother and brother are home yet?

Sada:
Koichiro phoned to say he won't be until late tonight. And your mother is waiting in the dining room.

Asuna:
Oh, thank you. Er, have a good night, Ms. Sada.

(Sada bowed to Asuna, and she leaved home. The sound of opening and closing door slightly echoed around quiet house, maybe this indicated the largeness of the house. Asuna walked a passage to the dining room. Opened its door, entered the room. In the room, Asuna's mother was sitting at a dining table alone, reading some book)

Mother:
You're late.

(A clock on the wall indicated it was 6:30)

Mother:
Next time, I want you here five minutes early.

Asuna:
...Yes, ma'am.

(The mother closed her book, unfolded her napkin and placed it on her lap. On the dining table, there are dishes of fish meuni√®re, green colored potage, salad, and two slices of bread for each)

Asuna:
It looks good.

(Outside of the house, suddenly heavy rain began to pour. In the house, Asuna and her mother ate dinner. Despite of the noise from downpour out home, the sounds from using knives, forks were distinctive. No other sonance generated from the space)

Mother:
I assumed you're using that thing again?

Asuna:
Yes, my friends and I were doing our homework together.

Mother:
Unless you actually, physically do your homework, you won't learn a thing.

Asuna:
But, we live so far away from each other, it's more convenient for us to meet in game.

Mother:
It hard to qualified as meeting, if you using that toy. Besides, doing a homework is not a team activity. If you're with your friends, you'll just fool around.
Asuna, you don't have time to play around anymore. You're two years behind from everyone else. You should be studying as hard as you can to make up for all that lost time.

Asuna:
But, I'm studying hard. Didn't you see my grades for second semester? I left them on your desk.

Mother:
Yes, I saw them. But grades from a school like that are suspect at best.

Asuna:
They're not...suspect.

Mother:
Yes, well...for your next trimester, I decided to hire your tutor. And, not on of those virtual ones everyone's going on about, someone who come to their house.

Asuna:
But...don't! I get to have any saying it?

Mother:
Have a look at this.

(The mother turned on, passed a tablet computer to Asuna. On it, there is a high school information site shown, a guide for the admission exam for its third year class)

Asuna:
The transfer exam...study guide?

Mother:
I know someone on the board of directors there, after some discussion, I convince them to that you taking exam to transfer into their senior class. It's a proper high school. Not some makeshift study hall. And since it's credit based, I'm sure you'll be able to graduate after the first trimester. If you do, you'll be back on track for college.

Asuna:
Wait...hold on! You can't just make a decision like this without me! I-I happen to like this school, I mean. The teachers there are great. I-I can learn there just as much as anywhere! I don't have to change schools!

(The mother heaved ostentatious sigh)

Mother:
I've done my research, you know? And believe me, that place you attending can hardly be called a school. The curriculum is slapdash, and classes are joke. Even the faculty sub-standard, they are bunch of losers, with no real credential to speak of.

Asuna:
...Don't say that.

Mother:
They claimed they're helping their students from behind because of that accident. It's all a lie. They all just want children who spent last two years killing each other in one convenient place, so then can monitor them...It's more like an asylum than a school.

Asuna:
...Did you forget, mother? I spent two years killing other kids, too.

(The mother stared Asuna, as if she scolding her child with doing so. Asuna muted her voice)

Mother:
...All the friends you had back in junior high are studying to get into college this year. They're leaving you behind. Doesn't that bother you?

Asuna:
Not at all. If it takes an extra year, to have won't make much of difference. Besides, I might not wanna go to college.

Mother:
Ridiculous! I won't attain such talk. You far too gifted, and your father and I have gone to great length to know see your talents! I hope you appreciate that.

Asuna:
I do! But, shouldn't I get to have a saying my own future!? Sure, I might not what kind of career I want right now, but I'm close to find it out! If I stay in my school for another year, it will help me make that decision!

(The mother heave a sigh)

Mother:
No matter how long you stay at the place like that, it'll just limit your options. Look, try to understand, I don't want you make a wrong turn now, and regret it later! I just want you have a good life and find yourself a good career you can be proud of.

Asuna:
So, that boy you forced me to meet a new year stay, that was you trying help me with my career? You should've heard him! He was talking like we were already engaged or something...You're the one who is limiting my options! Not me, and not my school!

(The mother tried to sip her wine, but she stopped to do that)

Mother:
Marriage is part of your career. If you marry beneath you, or marry poor, I guarantee you'll regret it. You won't have the means to pursue whatever as you really want to do. That's why I think Yuya would be an excellent choice. His family on the small regional bank, those are much more stable than some mega bank run by a board of directors.

Asuna:
...Your last choice wasn't very good. Did you forget how he made me, I don't know how many others suffer? Nobuyuki Sugo nearly bankrupted RCT. He was your choice, mother.

Mother:
Enough, young lady! I don't want to hear about him in this house again! ...And you're wrong. It wasn't my choice, it was your father's. He suggested that crook marry into this family. He's never been a good judge of character...! But, don't worry. Yuya might not initiative, but he seem stable. And stability is the corner stone of marriage.

Asuna:
I don't care. I have no intention to date or marry him. I chose who I marry.

Mother:
Fine, as long as man you choose as from a good family, and worthy of you...However, a boy like that, your little friend from school, is not worthy.

Asuna:
Huh...!?

(Asuna puzzled for a second, and noticed who is implied here)

Asuna:
You---you had him investigated...?

Mother:
Of course I did. Try to under stand, your father and I only want to best for your life. You have the potential to do whatever you want, as long as you make the right choices.

(Asuna stood from the chair, leaving from dining room)

Asuna:
I need time to think about transferring...

Mother:
Keep in mind, the deadline's next week. Don't forget. And, after you fill out a form, make three copies, and leave them in my office on my desk.

Asuna:
Mother...

Mother:
What is it?

Asuna:
Even though they're gone, you're still ashamed of grand-ma and grand-pa, aren't you? You're angry you aren't bone into a rich, important family.

(The mother, kept calm demeanor until then, instantly gnarled her face with anger)

Mother:
Asuna! Come back here right now! ...Asuna!

(Asuna shut the dining room door. And, she left from her mother. Immediately Asuna returned her room, she threw herself on her bed. Her room was remained dark)

Asuna:
Kirito...

(Asuna turned on her smartphone. On the screen, the picture of Asuna along with Kazuto displayed. The picture was the one which taken when they went to Imperial Palace last year. She remembered a talk about their future at that place)

Asuna:
Hey, about the questionnaire, have you figured it out what you wanna do yet?

Kazuto:
I guess...if anything I wanna go from playing game is to being a creator.

Asuna:
A creator? What? For games?

Kazuto:
No, not for games. I wanna make a human-machine interface to replace full-dive tech we use now. I've been going to all these tech-forums to learn more about it, but it's a heck of lot of information to absorb...

(Asuna was watching her phone screen. The light emitted from the phone projected her pensive face)

Asuna:
I wanna be with Kirito...And, go after the same dream. But now...

Kirito:
You sure strong...way stronger than I am.

Asuna:
I'm not strong at all...! In that world, I was a warrior. But, here... I'd been "Flash" Asuna, of the Knights of the Blood's. She's gone... In the real world, I have none of any real power...

(The downpour continued out of the house)



(ALO, 24th floor. The floor mainly occupied by water, and there are many small islands floating. Islands were connected each other by wooden floating bridges. The weather was fine. Kirito slept on one of the island that covered glasses, and sparse low tree. Asuna flew, descended to Kirito)

Kirito:
Hey.

Asuna:
It's rare for you to be so punctual, don't you think?

Kirito:
It happen sometimes.

(Kirito raised up to sit. Asuna sit down by him side by side, and leaned herself to Kirito's arm. Yui slept in Kirito's chest pocket. Asuna looked wishing to talk to Kirito, but she refrain to do so. Behind them, in the bush, something made rustling sound)

Kirito:
Uh...?

(A rabbit-like creature appeared from the bush. It was sniffing around short while, then jumping away)

Asuna:
Hey, you remember? You know that one day you came to my place in Selmburg, and I made you dinner?

Kirito:
Hate to say, but my memories about as good as punctuality...

Asuna:
What's!?

Kirito:
Yeah, I remember that day like it was yesterday.

Asuna:
Really?

Kirito:
Of course! Let's see...That's the day I gotta super rare food item, right? And, you made an awesome stew out of it. Ahh...that was some tasting meat... I'll never forget that day...!

Asuna:
Umm...! You don't remember anything except that stupid dinner!?

(Asuna punched Kirito)

Kirito:
Ah ha ha ha...

Asuna:
Nn...heh heh heh...

Kirito:
Er...?

(Above sky, several fairly parties flew toward somewhere)

Asuna:
It's almost time. I better get over there...

Kirito:
Asuna...Be careful with Zekken.

Asuna:
Huh?

Kirito:
Well...It's like, Zekken's really strong. Just saying.

Asuna:
Don't you worry. There seem the others already told me everything. Hm...Yup, they even told me how you lost. I still can't believe it. ...Oh, by the way, Leafa said in the middle of duel, Zekken and you stopped fighting to talk. What did you talk about?

Kirito:
Well...actually, I asked the question.

Asuna:
Hmm? What about?

Kirito:
I got weird vibe so I asked...

(Kirito remembered the deal with Zekken)

Kirito:
"You're full time in this world, aren't you, Zekken?" And then, for an answer, I gotta slight grin and a mega-fast attack. I've never seen anything with that fast...

Asuna:
What did you mean "full-time" in this world? Is that the same thing as being heavy-user?

(Kirito shook his head)

Kirito:
Uh-uh. Zekken's way different than average everyday hard-core gamer. It felt like...like they were a sort of product of the full-dive environment itself.

Asuna:
I have no idea what are you talking about...

Kirito:
Umm...In a way, it's probably better you don't. The best way to explain it, it's you do experience it.

(Kirito patted Asuna's head)

Asuna:
Uh...?

Lisbeth:
A-hem! Ahem! Ahem! Ahem! Every time we turn around you always behind on each other.

Kirito:
Er...

Lisbeth:
Sorry to interrupt your little love feast, but there's a duel supposed to be happening!

Leafa, Silica:
Yeah?

(Three girls looks intimidating)

Kirito:
Heh heh heh...

Asuna:
Er, I know. I was on my way...



(The island. The large tree stood behind the circular space. Asuna and others heard clanking sound someones' weapons were hitting each other. Soon later, a spear wielding man fall from the tree)

Man A:
Ahhhg!

(He hit hard on the ground, filing up soil dust. Somehow, the man could stand up by himself, but he waved her both arms)

Man A:
Ugg...Damn you! I quit! Resign!

(Large "RESIGN" mark appeared above man's head. Everyone around the space excited, and cheered the winner)

Man B:
Oh, yeah! That's sixty-seven wins in a row!

Man C:
Zekken's unbeatified!

(From the up on the tree, a figure descended to the ground, and made a polite bow to the audiences. They all cheered the figure again. Then, the girl paused V-shaped sign. She was Zekken)

Girl:
Hamph!

Asuna:
Er...huh...?

(In Asuna's mind, the tough looking guy in the heavy armor disappeared, the armor clattered down to the ground)

Asuna:
Excuse me, Lis...

Lisbeth:
What?

Asuna:
You didn't say Zekken's a girl!?

Lisbeth:
Er...I didn't? I gotta thought I did...?

Asuna:
You didn't! ...er, And you!

(Asuna turned to Kirito. Now she had threatening expression on her face. Blue frame burned in her eye)

Asuna:
...I have a feeling I know why you lost now (Stare!)

Kirito:
Nn-nn-nn, N-No! You're wrong! I didn't go easy because she's a girl! I was going full out! I swear! ...Halfway through a duel, anyway.

Asuna:
Whatever!

Lisbeth:
Hee hee hee...

Girl:
So, er...Is there anyone else up there want to take me on today!?

Lisbeth:
You're up! Go on, get her!

(Lisbeth nudged Asuna with her elbow)

Asuna:
Wait, really, that gotta psyche myself up first...

Lisbeth:
Oh, please! Once you cross swords with her, believe me, you'll get psyched up! Go on, get in there!

(Lisbeth pushed Asuna to the center of the center of the space)

Asuna:
Wow! ...ug.

Girl:
Hey! What's up? You next?

Asuna:
Oh-uh...hey, I-er-I guess, I am?

Girl:
Awesome!

(The girl slapped her fingers. And she beckoned Asuna with right hand. Asuna took deep breath, walk to the girl)

Asuna:
So, er...Does anything go this duel?

Girl:
Of course! You can use magic, or items, whatever you want! ...I'm only gonna use my sword, though.

(Asuna got provoked slightly)

Girl:
Oh...wait. Almost forgot. You wanna fight on the ground, or in the air?

Asuna:
...Is either okay?

Girl:
Mm~hm.

Asuna:
Hmm...Let's duel on the ground, then,

Girl:
You got it. Jumping's allowed, but no using your wings, OK?

(The girl tapped her windows with a practiced hand, offer a duel to Asuna. "Do you accept the duel?" a dialog box popped up in front of Asuna. There's the girls name)

Asuna:
Yuuki...

(Asuna accepted the duel, with "full-finish" mode. 10 seconds count down started. Asuna and Yuuki both drew their swords, readied to fight. All counts consumed, the battle began. With a "START" sign appeared, Asuna rushed to Yuuki with astonishing speed)

Asuna:
Ya! ...Haaa!

(Asuna attacked Yuuki with rain of thrusts of her rapier. Yuuki maneuvered to dodge all of the Asuna's attack, sometimes parried it. Apparently she's still seeing Asuna's move, however, Yuuki even appeared light smile on her face. Next moment, Yuuki stepped into closest distance to Asuna. Asuna broke her balance, stumbled to fall backward. Yuuki seized the opportunity to slash Asuna. But Asuna was able to manage to avert getting herself full-slash damage, using backward force came from stumbling, she got only graze from Yuuki's sword tip. One, two, Asuna took back flips two times to kill the moment from dodging, and to keep distance from Yuuki. They stopped, to wait and see opponent's next move, to seize the opportunity to attack their opponents. All spectators watching their fight, gasping, so absorbed that they couldn't take breathe themselves)

Yuuki:
Nn-fu-fu!

Asuna:
Haa...haa...Hmph...!
She is storong...But if I gave up now, I'd ruin my reputation as a swordswoman!
"In that world, I was a warrior! But here...!" ...Huh!

(Asuna was spaced out for seconds, reminded last night's agony. She looked behind Yuuki, Kirito watched a fight without much enthusiasm, Lisbeth and Silica looked anxious. That made Asuna uneasy a little. However, after she took one deep breath, closed her eyes to gain concentration, and opened her eyes again, her looking was completely different)

Yuuki:
Er...?

(Yuuki noticed Asuna readied to fight again, and this time, she sensed that Asuna had changed with different mind set toward the battle. So, she also carefully readied to Asuna's next move. After a second moment still, they both dashed toward each other, began crossing their sword. Yuuki thrust her sword, Asuna parried it with overwhelming force so Yuuki knocked back and shock wave reached Kirito and others standing around circular space. Yuuki restored her posture, and rushed again. They cut each other for a while. When they had locking their sword, Asuna gave a punch to Yuuki's solar plexus. And, when Yuuki took back to recover from her shock, Asuna seized a chance, activating her thrusting sword skill)

Asuna:
Got it!

(Asuna released her sword skill, but Yuuki could parried off all of those attacks. That made Asuna astonished)

Asuna:
She saw my "Quadruple Pain!?"

(And, while Asuna caught by motion lag, Yuuki countered to Asuna with her sword skill)

Yuuki:
Wraaah!

(Yuuki scored several clean hit to Asuna. Yuuki continued rushing to Asuna)

Asuna:
No way...I won't lose!

(This time, Asuna struck Yuuki with counter attack. Blue light dust exploded. But, covered by the dust smoke, Yuuki suddenly appeared, and she readied to fire some sword skill. Asuna could do nothing but watching the attack coming to her)

Asuna:
Is this...her eleven hit combo...!? Her original sword skill...! I'm going to lose... It might as well beaten something as awesome as that!

(Yuuki's sword skill caused explosion. It's blast reached over perimeter of the island, the water around the island waved violently. But, Yuuki's last attack wasn't actually reached to Asuna, Yuuki intently stopped her sword an inch from her)

Asuna:
...Huh?

(Yuuki lowered her sword, reached her left hand to puzzling Asuna's shoulder)

Yuuki:
...That was an awesome fight, girl! You're definitely the one!

Asuna:
Er...what?

Yuuki:
Heh heh...

Asuna:
Are---are we gonna finish the duel?

Yuuki:
I've totally seen enough to know you got what it takes! But, if you want, we can keep going!

Asuna:
...Nn-nh.

(Asuna shook her head)

Yuuki:
Hee-hee...I've looking for someone who can go the distance! At last, I found ya.

(Yuuki put her sword to the sheath, offered her right hand to Asuna. And, Asuna went after Yuuki, put back her sword, grabbed Yuuki's hand. Yuuki suddenly become winged, flew away with Asuna)

Asuna:
Wha---Wow!

Yui:
Mommy!

Lisbeth:
Asuna! Where are you going!?

Silica and Leafa:
Asuna!

Asuna:
Um...

(Yuuki flew away enough they could not see other spectators anymore, they were out of Aincrad, floating castle. Then, Yuuki stopped in the air, released Asuna's hand. They faced each other in the sky)

Yuuki:
I picked ya, 'cos you're the only one who can help us!

(Yuuki bowed to Asuna)

Asuna:
Help...with what?
