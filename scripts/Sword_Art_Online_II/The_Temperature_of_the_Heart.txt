  Liz:
Here you go. All done.

Asuna:
You're the best, Liz. Thanks.

Liz:
Sure, anytime!
Hey. Aren't you supposed to be out hunting with the guild today?

Asuna:
Yeah, I had to take the day off 'cause... I sort of have this little meeting with someone.

Liz:
Oh... Huh?
I bet you have a little meeting, eh?

Asuna:
No, it's not like that!
Oh, I have to get going!

Liz:
I bet he must be pretty special, whoever he is.

Asuna:
Huh? Did you say something?

Liz:
Uh-uh.
Get going! It's rude to keep your date waiting!

Asuna:
It's not like that. I... Whatever. See you!

Liz:
I wonder if I'll ever find someone special?



Liz:
Hmm... Good enough, I guess.
I better get ready for the customers.
Mm, perfect!
Welcome to Lizbeth's Blacksmith Shop!

Kirito:
Oh, hi.
I-I was wondering if you do custom orders.

Liz:
He doesn't look like he has that much money.
I can. The thing is, metal prices are kind of high these days.

Kirito:
Oh, well, I'm not worried about the cost.
I just want the best sword you can make as soon as possible.

Liz:
Well, I make a lot of different swords.
But if you have any idea of the quality of sword you want, I can make it.

Kirito:
Uh, sure. One sec.
So, I'm looking for something either the same quality or better than this.

Liz:
Oh...
[An] Elucidator?!
This is a notorious magic sword a person can get from a monster drop.

Kirito:
What do you think?

Liz:
How about this?
It's the best sword I've ever forged.
I call it my masterpiece!

Kirito:
I don't know. It's a little light.

Liz:
It should be. I used speed-type metal to forge it.

Kirito:
I'd like to test it if it's cool.

Liz:
Test it, how?

Kirito:
You know, its durability.

Liz:
What the heck are you doing?
If you break your sword, I'm not responsible.

Kirito:
If it breaks then, that's too bad!

Liz:
Eeek!
You broke my masterpiece...
What the hell were you thinking?!

Kirito:
I'm sorry!
I didn't think your sword was gonna break so easy, honest.

Liz:
Are you saying my sword, my masterpiece of swords was lamer than you thought?!

Kirito:
Yeah... something like that.

Liz:
For your information, if I had the right materials, I could make a buck load of swords that would shatter yours into a million tiny little pieces.
You got that?

Kirito:
Oh, yeah.
That sounds like the kind of sword I'm looking for, as long as it can shatter mine then.

Liz:
Okay, smarty-pants, but you have to help me make it every step of the way!

Kirito:
Seriously?

Liz:
Absolutely. We'll start by getting the metal for it.

Kirito:
I think I can handle that myself.
I'd rather not have you slow me down.

Liz:
Don't you dare insult me?
Believe it or not, I'm an expert mace user.

Kirito:
Suit yourself.
So, where do we find the metal?

Liz:
Floor 55, on the Western Mountain.
There's a dragon there that eats crystals.
According to the legends, it's supposed to store rare metal in its body.

Kirito:
Floor 55, huh?
Yeah, I should go alone...

Liz:
And... they say that in order to get the metal, you need to bring a master smith along.
Still think going alone's a good idea?

Kirito:
I...

Liz:
Hmm...

Kirito:
Fine. Just keep quiet and stay out the way.

Liz:
What? Keep quiet and...

Kirito:
By the way, my name's Kirito.
Looks like we're a party until you make that sword.

Liz:
Yeah, whatever, Kirito.

Kirito:
Well, if you're gonna be like that, I can roll with it.
Lis-beth.

Liz:
Pht!



Liz:
Achoo!
It's cold...

Kirito:
Well, you should've brought a coat or something.

Liz:
I didn't know Floor 55 was going to be this freaking cold.
Are you going to be okay without this?

Kirito:
You don't feel cold if you're disciplined.

Liz:
If you're trying to piss me off, it's working.
It's warm though.
I can't believe I'm out here all alone with this guy.
This is getting weird.

Kirito:
What's wrong, Lisbeth?
Giving up already?

Liz:
Not on your life!
And if you're gonna be a jerk about it, you might as well call me Liz.

Kirito:
Okay, okay.
Got it, Liz.

Liz:
Yeah well, don't wear it out!



Liz:
It's beautiful!
Ugh, what's your problem?!

Kirito:
You should get your teleport crystal ready.

Liz:
I know, I know, I'm doing it.

Kirito:
And I'm handling this part on my own.
Once the dragon appears, you're gonna hide under one of those crystals over there.
Don't come out, no matter what.

Liz:
Oh, come on! I'm not a noob.
But if I wanna help you or--

Kirito:
Do what what say!
Good. Okay, let's get going.
Hurry up and take cover!

Liz:
Okay.
Watch out! It's the breath attack!
Wow... With that skinny sword... Who is he?
Come on! Stop playing with it and finish it off already!

Kirito:
Dammit! Don't come out yet!

Liz:
What's the big deal? You've got a right while you...

Kirito:
Liz!
Hang on to me, Liz!



Kirito:
Are we still alive?

Liz:
Yeah, looks like it.

Kirito:
Drink one of these just in case.

Liz:
Thank you..., you know, for... for saving me.

Kirito:
It's a little early to be thanking anyone.
We have to find a way to get out of here first.

Liz:
Huh? Can't we just teleport out?
Teleport: Lindas!
No way!

Kirito:
Well, if we can't use crystals, that means there should be another way out.

Liz:
How can you be so sure there is?
I mean, maybe this is some kind of trap that would kill anyone who falls into it.

Kirito:
Good point. Maybe it is.

Liz:
What? Could you at least try to cheer me up?!

Kirito:
I think I have an idea.

Liz:
Really?

Kirito:
Yeah. We can try running up the wall.

Liz:
You're insane.

Kirito:
Maybe, that's all I got for ideas right now.

Liz:
No way...

Kirito:
Ugh, ahhhh!
If I had more of running start, I probably would've made it.

Liz:
Yeah, I don't think so.



Liz:
This is kind of weird, isn't it?
This wouldn't happen in real life.
You know, going to strange places, meeting a total stranger, and then sleeping next to them.
I mean, you actually tried running up that wall.
You really are a weirdo, you know that?

Kirito:
Well, excuse me.

Liz:
Kirito... Can I ask you something?

Kirito:
Ask away. I'm all ears.

Liz:
Why did you risk your life like that to save me?

Kirito:
I can't just sit back and watch someone die.
I'd rather die along side of them than do nothing.
Especially if that someone's a girl like you, Liz.

Liz:
Ah, you really are an idiot.
You're the only person who thinks like that.
Hey... Hold my hand.

Kirito:
'Kay...

Liz:
It's so warm...

Kirito:
Huh?

Liz:
Even though you and me are just these ones and zeros in a virtual world...

Kirito:
I know...



Liz:
What the...?
What're you doing?

Kirito:
Hm? Here, look!

Liz:
Is this... ore I think, it is?

Kirito:
Uh-huh.
It's that special metal we came all this way for.
Like you said, the dragon eats crystals and they turn this in its stomach.
No wonder it's hard to find.

Liz:
Yeah, but you found it.
What's it doing down here though?

Kirito:
This hole isn't a trap like we thought.
It's the dragon's nest.

Liz:
R-Really?

Kirito:
Uh-huh.
And that's not just an ingot. That's dragon's excrement.
You know, poop?

Liz:
Huh? Oh... Ah!

Kirito:
Well, I guess this means we've got all we came for.
Still stuck though.

Liz:
Wait. This is supposed to be a dragon's nest, right?

Kirito:
Yup.

Liz:
'Cause dragons are nocturnal, so it won't be long before it comes...
It's here!
Wha-what are you doing?!

Kirito:
Hang on to me, Liz!
Almost there!

Liz:
Wow, look at that!
Kirito! You know what?

Kirito:
Know what?!

Liz:
Don't freak out!
But I'm falling in love with you!

Kirito:
I can't hear a thing! What did you just say?!
Oops!

Liz:
Never mind!



Liz:
A one-handed long sword, right?

Kirito:
Yup! Make it awesome.

Liz:
I didn't imagine it, the warmth of Kirito's hands... the way I feel...
As soon as I made the best sword I can... I'll tell him.

Kirito:
Whoa...

Liz:
The sword is called Dark Repulsor.
One of a kind.
And it's not even in the info brokers' directory.
Go on, try it.

Kirito:
Okay.

Liz:
Good? Bad?

Kirito:
It's real heavy. It's a good sword!

Liz:
Yay!

Kirito:
It feels like you forged your soul into it.
Okay, you held up your end on the deal.
It's time for me to pay up.
So, how much?

Liz:
Um, well... I don't really need any... money...
I-Instead, I'd like to be your exclusive blacksmith from now on.

Kirito;
What do you mean exclusive?
What's wrong?

Liz:
I mean... anytime you get back from the field, stop by and let me do maintenance on your gear, every day, from now to the end!

Kirito:
Liz, I...

Liz:
Kirito... I just... I...

Asuna:
Liz! I was so worried!

Liz:
Asuna?

Asuna:
Liz! Where were you last night?
I tried messaging you but you didn't answer and I couldn't track you on the map!

Liz:
Sorry. I kind of got stuck in a dungeon

Asuna:
A dungeon?! You went all by yourself?

Liz:
Uh-uh. I went with him.

Asuna:
Huh? Ki-Kirito!?

Kirito:
Hey, Asuna. Long time no see.
It's been a while like... two days?

Asuna:
Oh, this is a surprise.
I didn't know you wanted to check this place out.
I wish you've told me, I could've come with you.

Liz:
I'm sort of confused. Do you know each other?

Kirito:
Yeah, both of us are on the Assault Team, so...

Asuna:
He said he was looking to get a more power sword, so I told him about you and your shop.

Liz:
Oh...

Asuna:
Why is she acting like that?
I swear, if you did anything weird to her...

Kirito:
I-I didn't do anything!

Asuna:
Then, why did you stutter just now, huh?

Kirito:
You know, you could try to show a little more compassion.
I almost got killed!

Asuna:
Like that's my fault!
Don't I always tell you not to fight solo?!

Liz:
Right. I get it now...

Asuna:
If this guy said anything rude, you tell me, right?
Liz?

Liz:
If you wanna talk about rude, try this!
The first thing he does is when he comes in and shatters my best sword.

Asuna:
What?! I'm sorry!

Liz:
Oh, come on! You don't have to apologize for anything.
He might be a little weird, but he's not such a bad guy.
Don't screw this up, Asuna. He's a keeper.

Asuna:
But I told you, it's not like that!
Liz?

Liz:
Sorry, I have to go pick up some supplies.
I'll be right back!

Asuna:
But, you're gonna leave the store?

Liz:
Hold down the fort for me. Later!

Asuna:
What? No, wait, Liz!



Kirito:
Lisbeth...

Liz:
I almost got away with it.
A couple of more minutes, and I would've gone back to my usual cheerful self.

Kirito:
Liz, I...

Liz:
How'd you know I was here?

Kirito:
I scanned the whole town for you from up there.

Liz:
Figures. You do something crazy like that.
Sorry if I worried you. I'm fine now.
Must feel all the excitement, I'm not used to having adventures.
Anyway...
Come just forget everything... I said... Okay?

Kirito:
Liz, I... I just wanted to thank you.
See I... I don't know... I always thought dying was better than surviving day after day... living with a guild.

Liz:
Kirito.

Kirito:
But then, we got stuck in that hole, and I was really happy we were still alive.
I realized that even here our lives are real and have meaning.
Thank you for helping me see that, Liz.
I guess it's what I've been looking for this whole time.

Liz:
Yeah, me too.
I know what you mean.
I was also looking for something, something real, hoping I find it.
The warmth of your hand... and me... that was real.
Do me a favor, okay? Tell Asuna what you told me.

Kirito:
Liz...

Liz:
I'm fine, really.
The "getting over it" part, that's gonna take a while.
Until I do, promise me... promise me you put an end to this world.
Till then, I'll keep doing what I do best.

Kirito:
I promise I will.
I swear I'll beat the game.

Liz:
If you ever need your weapons or gear repaired, my door is always open.

Kirito:
Sure.

Liz:
Don't forget now, you'll always be welcome at my shop!
