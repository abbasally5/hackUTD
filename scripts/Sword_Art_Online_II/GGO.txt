  Kirito:
(In his mind) I'm ninety-nine percent sure that Death Gun stories are hoax. Probably someone trolleyed. You can't kill someone in the real world from the virtual anymore. I know that's impossible...
But there's still that one percent chance it could be true. That's why I'm here.
Link start!

(Kirito logged in to GGO, Gun Gale Online. He is looking around at the town in the game)

Kirito:
(In his mind) It's a lot different than ALO... Go figure... Killing people is a point here... alright, then...? Huh?



Kirito:
Ho... Holy Crap!

(Kirito looks at himself which is reflected in a window. He has long hair, looks more young, feminine than his real figure. He is examining his appearance)

Kirito:
mm... umm... nn... I wish I looked more soldier-ish... sigh.

Man:
Holy bazongas! That's the F1300 model, isn't it!? That avatar is so rare I've only heard about till now! I want it! I'll give two mega credits you for that account! Come! Lady? What do you say?

Kirito:
La...Lady?

(Kirito's touching around his chest. There are no bulges of woman's. He sighs in relieve)

Man:
Um?

Kirito:
Urm... Hate to break it to you guy, but I'm a guy too.

Man:
Holy crap! Then, that means you've got M9000 model! I'll give you four... No! five for it! Sell it to me! Come on! Sell it to me!

Kirito:
Sorry, but this is a default avatar, it's a converted one... I can't exchange for cash...

Man:
Oh? That sucks...

Kirito:
Sigh, yeah, well, later.

Man:
Hey! If you ever change your mind, give me the first ping!

Kirito:
Ugh...

(Kirito is walking through smoggy town. The street is noisy and messy. Above in the air, there are several hovering panels showing advertisements)

Kirito:
(In his mind) If I wanna give Death Gun's attention, I have to make a name for myself first...

Town's people:
Phew!
You're hot!
Come for me!

(Kirito hastily leave the situation. He walks around the town. The town is skyscrapers. To and fro, he's hit on by guys)

Kirito:
Um... I'm totally lost. Some shortcut this turned out to be...

(Sinon happens walking across Kirito's view of field. He decided to ask her the way)

Kirito:
Eh, excuse me? Can you tell me where...
(In his mind) Ah-oh... She thinks I'm hitting on the...?

Sinon:
Yeah? What?

Kirito:
eh...

(Sinon scrutinizes Kirito's figure)

Sinon:
You are a first time on the game, huh?

(Sinon smiles friendly at Kirito)

Kirito:
I, I am... (In his mind) Oh my god... She thinks I'm a girl too.

Sinon:
Where do you wanna go?

Kirito:
Er, I, eh...he he... (He thinks deeply) Umm... urg...
(With feminine voice, with his left hand covering his cheek, in a cute manner) Yes, it's my first time. I'm looking for a place to buy a cheap gun. Oh, and I also need to find out governor's offices. Ha ha...

Sinon:
Oh, sure. I can show you.

Kirito:
(In his mind) It's no cool... But I'll let her keep thinking I'm a girl for a while...

Sinon:
By the way, why do you want to go a governor's office?

Kirito:
Eh... I want to sign myself up for an event called Bullet of Bullets.

Sinon:
BoB! Okay, but... you just started playing today, right?

Kirito:
Yes.

Sinon:
Yeah, I don't know, your stats may behind enough for that...

Kirito:
Oh, well, I converted. So, all my skills are transferred from another game.

Sinon:
If you say so...
So, anyway, you picked a heck of a game to play? So grimy and stinks of oil?

Kirito:
Um, well, I've only played fantasy games up to now. They're fun, but I thought to try a cyber game for a once, oh? (A floating advertizing board, which can read gun shop, go through nearby their side) I was also interested to see what gun battles would like.

Sinon:
Really? It takes guts to wanna start with BoB, right off the butt, like that? Let's keep up with the gun then, I know this great market. It's down here.

Kirito:
OK.



(Kirito and Sinon are in the large gun shop)

Kirito:
Wow, this place looks like it has everything.

Sinon:
Yeah, well, there are two types of weapons they are most used in GGO. Optical guns, and ammo guns.

Kirito:
Huh.

Sinon:
And, optical guns are light and more accurate, but it has drawbacks. If your opponent equipped a defense shield, it only does half the damage. For one on one tourney like BoB, it might be the ammo gun's the best bet.

Kirito:
Oh, OK.

Sinon:
Alright. Let's start with your stats.

Kirito:
Uhm... I guess my strength is the highest. And speed after that.

Sinon:
You are an STR-AGI type. Huh? OK, you've got two choices for your main weapon either having solid rifle or large caliber machine gun.

Kirito:
Ugh...

Sinon:
Which ever one you choose, you also gonna need a handgun for a backup weapon...

Kirito:
Uh, urg...

Sinon:
Wait a sec, you said you just converted over, didn't you? Do you have any credits?

Kirito:
Yeah, I should. Let's see... It says I have a thousand credits.

Sinon:
Everybody gets that on the day start.

Kirito:
Oh? hehehe...

Sinon:
Hmm... If that's all you have, the most you gonna for it's gonna be a small ray gun, not for a live ammo gun. That thousand will get used revolver. Listen, If you want, I could loan you the money to buy a gun.

Kirito:
Th-That's really sweet of you, but I couldn't! eh, I know! Does this game have anything in it for a new player like me could go on some money?

Sinon:
Well, I don't recommend them, but there ARE like casinos and gambling games. Like that one.

(Sinon's pointing at the signboard. It says "Let's Challenge")



(The puppet, wearing a cowboy hat, being armed with a revolver gun, opens and closes his mouse)

Puppet:
Hey! Chicken! Come on!

Kiroto:
How do you play?

Sinon:
You enter through that gate into dummy alley dodging NPC's bullets. The idea is to get as close as you can to a [not to get his] shot. If you can touch them, you'll win all the cash everyone sunken to it. Since so, last time with be.

(The signboard displays the amount of the reward cash)

Kirito:
A-All of it!?

Sinon:
Three-hundred thousand change.

Kirito:
Now, that is a heck of a lot of money.

Sinon:
Well, no one's beaten it. Once he get eight meters away from the game player, he switched to as wicked fast as quick draw mode. At the time you see the bullet lines, it's too late.

Kirito:
The bullet lines?

Sinon:
Look. Another sucker step up to add to the jackpot.

Man A:
Today's a day! Man!

Man B:
Yeah, you got this!

Man C:
Here goes nothing!

(Man C touches his hand to the virtual console to pay for the challenge. The sound welcoming the new challenger rung)

Puppet:
I'm gonna blast you from here to the moon! You're varmint!

Man C:
What's be clear this be urchin! Nothing from!

Man B:
Jackpot's yours!

Man C:
Yeah! You know it!

(The info panel counts down three, then shows on it "GO!" Man C start to dash)

Man C:
Uraah! ... Ha!

(Man C suddenly stopped, then posed in a weird way)

Kirito:
Why's he doing that? Oh.

(Kirito noticed the man pose for dodging bullets of the puppet's shots)

Kirito:
Was that a bullet line?

Sinon:
Yup. It's defense system's assist. We all have it. Except for sniper's first shot, bullet prediction lines always show up in the target's field of vision.

Puppet:
I'll kill you!

Man C:
Whatever! Ha ha ha...

Man B:
Run! Man!

Man A:
You've so got this!

Puppet!
You loser!

(Man C fell down on his butt. The puppet shot him three times)

Puppet:
Game over! Horse!

(The reward money rose up to 302,000)

Spectator A:
What's that?

Spectator B:
It like I'd never chance.

Sinon:
See? the alley so narrow, you can't move too far either side. And you force to charge the gun sling to straight on. That's as far as every one's gotten.

Kirito:
Ah, I get it. If I wait to see bullet lines, it'll be too late.

Sinon:
Eh? Hey! Where are you going!?

(Kirito touches his hand to the console. The welcoming sound rings)

Man C:
Ten creds for the newbie gives up on the gate.

Spectator B:
Wow! That's the cutest target I've ever seen!

Spectator A:
Let's stick around to watch her get pawn.

(The info panel counts down three, then shows on it "GO!" Kirito start to dash)

Puppet:
I'll kill you!

(The puppet shoots Kirito. Prediction lines are pointing at Kirito's head, left shoulder, left knee. Kirito stepped aside, and dodged all bullets that went through along the bullet lines)

Puppet:
You loser!

(Again, the puppet shoots Kirito. But he dodges all of them)

Sinon:
You're kidding...!

Man C:
She passed ten meter mark!

Man B:
That is the one fast kid!

Puppet:
Die! you're varmint!
I'll blast you to the hell!

(The puppet continues to shoot Kirito, but the shots all missed)

Kirito:
Looks like someone out of the bullets!

Sinon:
Ah!

(Suddenly, the puppet's pistol changed it's function to an optical gun. Kirito jumps up to dodge the blasters. He touches the puppet's body)

Puppet:
Noooooo!

(The puppet knelt down. A copious amount of gold coins gush out from the building windows. A fanfare rung out. All spectators are silent in astonishment. Kirito opens up his virtual console, receive the reward. The mound of gold coins disappeared. The puppet regain it's original posture. It's ready to the next challenge)

Puppet:
Hey! Chicken! Come on!

Spectator B:
... What the hell is that!?

Spectator A:
Who is that kid?

Sinon:
Oh my god. I've never seen reflexes like that! I mean, at the end, you dodged those lasers from about two meters away! At that range, the time between you've seen the bullet lines and shots fired, well, that's it, you shouldn't have any time between them.

Kirito:
Oh, eh... really?

Sinon:
(nods)

Kirito:
um, well, since the game is dodging bullets, I just predicted the bullet lines. You know, predict to predictions?

Sinon:
You... you predicted the predictions...?




Kirito:
Umm... I'm confused about specs of assault rifle... I mean, this things ginormous. So, why is the caliber of the bullet it fired more than sub machine guns?

Sinon:
I'm confused about how someone like you can dodge the bullet like a ghost don't know that. You've converted from another game. What did you play before this one?

Kirito:
Nothing special. Just one of those be called fantasy games is all.

Sinon:
Hmm... Yeah, so you said. Well, during the BoB prelims, I'll can get the idea what you can really do.

Kiroto:
He he...

Sinon:
As for the assault rifle, you wanna know why it uses small caliber?

Kirito:
Sure.

Sinon:
It all goes back to the M16 in the U.S. They designed it to precision and penetrating power. But, using a fast small caliber round...
... You don't need to know that stuff, though.
Not a cheap that 300K, you can buy pretty much every gun you want. It all comes down that you want. So, what do you think what works the best for you?

Kirito:
What does work for me...? Ah! ...Hey, ah, what are these?

Sinon:
Oh, those are photon swords.

Kirito:
Photon...?

Sinon:
It's the beam of light, that's a way in a particle. Photon sword is an official name, but people called them laser blades, beam savers, and something else I can't remember...

Kirito:
Oh, cool! You can use the sword here!?

Sinon:
Yeah, if you want. But, nobody really uses them.

Kirito:
Why don't they?

Sinon:
Well, I mean, because, you can't use it unless you close to your target. And if you are not crazy enough to get that close, you'll get shots full of holes.

Kirito:
So, basically it's good as long as you get close enough.

Sinon:
Yeah, I guess, but even if your skill at dodging... If you are at full of gun firing, eh... Oh.

(Kirito operates the console panel to buy a photon sword. Instantly, a little shop clerk robot appeared)

Robot:
Welcome, player!

(Kirito touches the virtual console that appeared above the robot. The robot materialized a hilt of photon sword. Kirito grabs it)

Kirito:
Thank you.

Robot:
Thank you for your purchase! Have a nice day!

Sinon:
Oh, well. I guess, where it comes to combat, everyone's got their own style.

Kirito:
The way I've seen it, if this place sells something, it must be okay for battle, even this.

(Kirito turns on his photon sword. It emits a pink-purple colored blade of light)

Kirito:
Wow...

(It's buzzing sound emphasized synchronizing its move. Kirito lowered his body, as if he's ready for battle with someone)

Sinon:
(In her mind) Huh, she looks like she knows what's she doing...

Kirito:
Hah! Yah!

(Kirito cut through the air)

Sinon:
Oh...(Sinon craps her hands) Wow, those are your fantasy game skills? Not bad.

Kirito:
I know a couple of moves. ...It sure is light.

(Kirito swings the sword once more, and he places it his back so he put the blade back into its sheath)

Sinon:
Huh?

(Kirito noticed that photon sword have no sheath, so he did an unnecessary move)

Kirito:
Uh...umm...(He turned off his weapon)

Sinon:
Well, looks like you'd set up that as you main weapon. But you should have a sub-machine gun or handgun in your inventory too. It will distract your enemy so you can get closer.

Kirito:
Oh, okay.

Sinon:
How much do you have left?

Kirito:
About 150K.

Sinon:
Wow! Those photon things are expensive! You've gotta 150k, huh...? You still need to get protective gears, some kind of weapon, and ammo for it... What's cheap a good...?

Kirito:
I'll trust you a judgement with all that.

Sinon:
For BoB... A live ammo weapon is your best bet. If I were you, I go for accuracy over stomping power. Hmm... Ah! You've spent most of your credits on it, but this one's good. The FN Five Seven.

Kirito:
...What's five seven?

Sinon:
The bullet caliber. Five point seven millimeters. They are smaller than 9mm Parabellum bullet, but they still pack a punch. They are similar in shape to rifle bullets, so they've got a precision ans stomping power.

Kirito:
Huh...

Sinon:
Hey, are you even listening?

Kirito:
Huh? Oh...Yeah! I guess I'll buy that, then. Is... that it? Or do I need anything else?

Sinon:
Yeah, you do. You are gonna need a holster, some extra mags, protective gear, and you should also get yourself some defense field. ...And range time.

Kirito:
What's that?

Sinon:
You've never fired a gun before, have you?

Kirito:
Uh-huh. Never.

Sinon:
Let's change that.



tatatatata...
blum, blum...

(Kirito and Sinon are in the shooting range. There are several people testing their guns. Loud sounds are echoing in the room)

Sinon:
If you buy a gun from the shop, you can test it here.

(Kirito is at the lane)

Sinon:
Know how to hold it?

Kirito:
I guess... It's lighter than I thought.

Sinon:
That's cause that model's made of reinforced plastic. The recoil isn't too bad on it, still, you should equip it both your hands. And, keep your left eye open.

Kirito:
eh...Oh, okay.

Sinon:
So, right now, you should be seeing a green circle in your field of vision.

Kirito:
Is it supposed being shrinking and expanding like that?

Sinon:
Yup. It's called the bullet circle. Your offensive assist system. Your bullet will hit the target at random inside the circle.

Kirito:
How do I boost my accuracy?

Sinon:
I guess, the easiest way is to get closed to your target.

Kirito:
What else?

Sinon:
Try to stay calm. The faster your heartbeats, the more the circle expands.

Kirito:
This is harder than I thought...

(Kirito tries concentrate to shrink his bullet circle. It's gradually getting smaller. Circle looks small enough to capture the target, Kirito triggers his pistol)

Kirito:
Whoa! eh...

(Sinon pushes some switch. The target board moves close to Kirito)


Kirito:
No way. I missed...?

Sinon:
What did you expect? That's your first time!



(Kirito and Sinon are right outside of the market building entrance)

Kirito:
Thank you for going out of your way for me. I'm really appreciated it.

Sinon:
Nn-hnn. I was happy to help. There aren't any girl players here. I wasn't doing anything, so it was a great way to kill some time before prelims.

Kirito:
Wait. You're gonna competing in BoB too?

Sinon:
Uh-huh. I was on my way to sign up before...

(Sinon looks at the clock hanging over the entrance of the market. It shows 14:50)

Sinon:
Oh my god! They're closing soon!

Kirito:
R-Really!? I'm so sorry! It's my fault if you're late.

Sinon:
No, it's mine. For not keeping track of the time. Whatever. Let's hurry!

(They start to dash)

Kirito:
We're never gonna make it! Can we just teleport over there?

Sinon:
I wish! That only happens when you re-spawned at revival point after you die! And, we can't suicide ourselves to get there either because, in town, our HP never goes down! The governor's office is three kilo-meters away... It's gonna take up five minutes to sign up, so we have to get there in three...! Don't close... Don't close we can at there...!

(Kirito looking for something while he run. He finds out there are rental buggies ahead of them)

Kirito:
That's it!

(He grabs Sinon's hand, and run for the one of those parked buggies)

Sinon:
Yikes!

(They ride on the buggy. Kirito opened its virtual console panel, and placed his hand to pay. He ignites it's engine, rocket to run so the buggy lifts its front wheel)

Sinon:
Whoah!

Kirito:
Better hang on!

Sinon:
Wait a sec! These are supposed to be ridiculously hard to drive! I don't know anyone who can handle them. So, the heck of you can!?

Kirito:
Oh, well... I used to play a lot of racing games back in the day.

(Kirito abruptly changed the driving lane so he could pass a bus running in front of them)

Sinon:
Eek!

Kirito:
Are you OK?

Sinon:
He he...Ha ha ha! Yeah, fine! This is great! ...Go on. Punch it. The faster, the better!

Kirito:
Okay!

(Kirito shifs the gear up. They are running on a highway)
