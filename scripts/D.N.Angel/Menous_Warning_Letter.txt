  Menou:
I thought so.

Grandpa:
She was so small and frail. The way she smiled fulfilled me in ways stealing never could. Making her laugh gave my life the meaning I was searching for. In the end, I think she was the one who had come to save me. I wanted to give her something, something that would show her what her smile meant to me. So one evening when I found her locked away in her room sleeping soundly in her bed, I placed the Agate Links on her window where she would find it in the morning. As fate would have it, she died the next day.

Dark:
I think that it would be for the best if I kept this for a while. It appears to have quite a... But hold on you.

Menou:
I've been waiting for so long... For the one who gave it to me to return. But this was my last day. Bye-bye. I won't wait any longer.

Daisuke:
Wait. We can't let it end this way, Dark. After she's waited for so long. It's... broken now. But I think... that you should continue to hold onto it.

Menou:
You've come back. You've come. After all this time. You've come back. And now I can finally thank you.

Daisuke:
Um, I'm not...

Grandpa:
So she's finally gone...

Daisuke:
She waited a long time to say thank you, didn't she? Grandpa, I don't think she was caught in the spell of Agate Links. She just wanted to thank you.

Grandpa:
I see.

Daisuke:
I don't understand why you didn't go to see her one last time, Grandpa.

Grandpa:
No. I couldn't. She was waiting for the young man from her memories. I could never be the 14-year old boy she remembered.

Daisuke:
But it was a lie...

Grandpa:
Listen, Daisuke. A phantom thief doesn't just steal things.The phantom thief is an idea that lives in people's dreams. And it's our job to fulfill those dreams. The legend is bigger than any of us. Sometimes the only way to live up to him is by sleight of hand.

Daisuke:
For a brief moment I wondered if phantom Dark wasn't a curse, but a possibility. I yearned to see him the way others saw him. As a legendary figure zipping across the night sky on black wings.
