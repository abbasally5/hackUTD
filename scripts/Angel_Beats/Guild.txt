-- Opening: My Soul, Your Beats! --

Yuri:
Takamatsu, present your report.

Takamatsu:
All right.
According to our weapons supply, our stockpile of gunpowder is mostly depleted.
We should stock up before our next battle.

Ooyama:
Hey. Wait a minute.
With the new guy here, don't we need another gun?

Yuri:
Indeed.
Very well, today's operation will be "Operation Guild Parachute Drop".

Otonashi:
Op..., Operation Parachute?

Hinata
What's wrong, Otonashi?

Otonashi:
I'm sorry. I'm not a real big fan of heights.

Yuri:
We aren't parachuting from the sky.
We are parachuting down underground.

Otonashi:
Oh, underground. Why did... underground?!

Yuri:
Part of our rebellion, we call it the "Guild". It's hidden deep underground.
That's where our friends make all our weapons.

Otonashi:
Is it there so Angel won't find it?

Yuri:
Yup,if she overtook the Guild, we'd lose our weapon supplies, we'd lose all hope of winning.

Guild staff:
Hey!

Yuri:
It's me. We're headed down there tonight. I need you to disarm all of the traps.

Guild staff:
Roger, it's tonight, right? We'll be waiting.

Yuri:
Perfect.
All right. All of you are going in.


Ooyama:
Huh? Hey, what about Noda?

Hinata:
That stupid idiot's probably off doing his own things.

TK:
Right! Let's go!

Matsushita:
Heave-ho!

Fujimaki:
Okay, let's go!

Hinata:
C'mon, don't just stand there.

Otonashi:
It's... It's in there?
So, this is the entrance?

Ooyama:
It's been ages since we visited the Guild last.

Otonashi:
It's really dark.

Fujimaki:
Hey, there's someone here!

Hinata:
It's the moron.


-- Episode title: Angel Beats EPISODE.02, "Guild" --


Noda:
You're Otonashi, ain't ya ?
I haven't accepted you as one of us.

Hinata:
Oh good grief. I don't see why he is waiting to ambush him here.

Ooyama:
Looks like Noda is taking this situation seriously.

Yuri:
It doesn't make any sense.

Otonashi:
Don't care if you accept me.

Noda:
Punk, care to die a thousand times...

Yuri:
Battle formation!

Fujimaki:
Weren't the traps disarmed?

Otonashi:
What's going on?!

Hinata:
Just what it looks like.
There are several anti-Angel instant death traps from here to the Guild.
It would seem all of them are still activated.

Otonashi:
Meaning what?

Ooyama:
They forgot to disarm them?

Fujimaki:
Don't tell me they're trying to kill us!

Yuri:
No, the Guild must've decided to reactivate the traps.

Matsushita:
But why?!

Yuri:
There's only one explanation: Angel is here.

Matsushita:
Down here?!

TK:
Just wild Heaven, man.

Shiina:
We screwed up.

Otonashi:
Hold on. So the Guild knew we were coming and reactivated them anyway?

Takamatsu:
It looks like you still don't understand.
No matter what happens, we cannot die.
It's just insanely painful.

Otonashi:
That's not cool...

Takamatsu:
But if she locates the Guild and topples it, we won't be able to get more bullets or repair broken weapons.
How would we fight against Angel then?

Yuri:
The Guild's decision was correct.

Hinata:
Should we pursue Angel?

Fujimaki:
Are you crazy?
The traps aren't deactivated!

Otonashi:
Those traps will take care of Angel, right? Let's leave.

Yuri:
I'm afraid these traps will only stop her temporarily.
We're going! About march!

Otonashi:
So tell me, what type of traps are there?

Hinata:
Every kind you can think of. Just keep your eyes peeled.

Shiina:
Crap! It's coming!!

Otonashi:
Huh? What is?

Shiina:
Move it!
This way! Hurry!

Hinata:
That's Takamatsu's voice.
He's a goner.

Yuri:
Looks like everyone but Takamatsu is okay.
Let's head out!

Otonashi:
Head out? Shouldn't we save him?

Hinata:
He's not going to die.
Don't worry. He'll break free and make it back to the surface.

Otonashi:
Are you sure?

Hinata:
C'mon.

Otonashi:
Oh, thanks. You're a life-saver.

Hinata:
It's no biggie.
To be honest with you, I'm actually pretty fond of you, man.

Otonashi:
Are you gay?

Hinata:
Hell no!

Yuri:
Will it open?

Fujimaki:
Of course not.

Ooyama:
Oh no, I'm sorry. I forgot! This trap locks its victims inside.

Otonashi:
Don't forget important details like that.

Shiina:
This is so stupid.

Yuri:
This is when things get sticky.

Fujimaki:
Dodge it!

Yuri:
Get down.

Otonashi:
What the...
What happens if that touches you?

Hinata:
Holy smoke, man. That laser's so sharp it'll cut you in half.

Fujimaki:
Coming back round two!

Otonashi:
What should I do.

Yuri:
Lay flat!

Fujimaki:
Now for round three!

Yuri:
What do you mean round three?

Fujimaki:
It's an X.

Otonashi:
How are we supposed to dodge that?!

Yuri:
Each man for himself.

Matsushita:
Hurry! Open the door!

Hinata:
Don't look. You shouldn't look, man.

Otonashi:
Wh..What happened?

Fujimaki:
It's open! Hurry up!

Yuri:
We lost Matsushita this time, not surprising considering his size.

Fujimaki:
Well, he's needed to go on a diet !

Hinata:
I bet he saw something nasty... right up close and personal.
I'm just so happy that you're still alive.
Oh, for the record, after getting shred to bits, he'll pull himself back together.

Shiina:
The trap's been activated!

Ooyama:
Crap, I forgot! Er, this is the trap where the ceiling falls.

Otonashi:
Don't forget the important details like that!

All:
TK!

TK:
Hurry up! [It's so make a chance/You can still make it, dicks]. Giive my love to Jesus, man.

Yuri:
Good man.

Fujimaki:
Later.

Hinata:
Take care!

Otonashi:
Sorry...

Yuri:
Even TK got sacrificed...

Otonashi:
It's all your fault, you know.

Hinata:
No, c'mon, he'll be all right. He's fine, just fine.

Yuri:
We can't let his sacrifice be in vain. Let's go.

Hinata:
What's wrong?

Yuri:
Something...

Ooyama:
Crap, I forgot! This is the trap... Well, I guess you know now...

Otonashi:
Qu...Quit forgetting stuff!

Yuri:
You're too heavy! I can't hold on!

Hinata:
Want Otonashi and I to fall?

Otonashi:
This isn't an option.

Shiina:
Wouldn't be wise to lose our remaining forces here.

Yuri:
I know! Hurry climb up!

Hinata:
Otonashi, can you do it?

Otonashi:
I don't have a choice!

Hinata:
Oh man, take it easy, will you?

Otonashi:
Oh Jeez, quit reading anything into this.

Yuri:
What are you doing? Stop resting and get climbing.

Otonashi:
But where should I grab onto you?

Yuri:
It doesn't matter. Grab anywhere you can!

Otonashi:
Okay...

Yuri:
Hurry up!

Otonashi:
All right...

Yuri:
You'll fall like that!

Otonashi:
You're right...
And she really smells good. Stop it! Focus! Just climb!
OK. Why do you have to be facing me like this?

Yuri:
All like I planed it this way. Get your butt in gear!

Otonashi:
R..Right...

Yuri:
Don't you grab me there!

Hinata:
Ahhhh you bitch!

Otonashi:
Where's Hinata?

Yuri:
He was a noble sacrifice.

Otonashi:
Oh..

Yuri:
Now we're down to just four members.

Fujimaki:
Kind of impressive that a newb like you has made it this far.

Otonashi:
I guess.

Fujimaki:
Oh, you'll be the next to go.


Yuri:
It's a water trap.

Otonashi:
I didn't know that poor bustard couldn't swim.

Shiina:
We have this way. Follow me.

Otonashi:
Here.

Yuri:
Thanks.

Shiina:
Yuri, over here!

Yuri:
Shiina? Let's go.

Otonashi:
What's that doing there?

Yuri:
Hey, that's...

Shiina:
Oh no! The puppy's getting carried away! I'm coming, coming!

Yuri:
Shiina, don't!

Shiina:
Oh good grief. It's just a toy.

Yuri:
Even Shiina fell victim to a trap.

Otonashi:
That's an anti-Angel trap? She should've realized quicker!

Yuri:
She misidentifies cute things as real animals.

Otonashi:
That's surprisingly cute for her. But she'll be all right, won't she?

Yuri:
You're the only one left.

Otonashi:
Sure looks that way.

Yuri:
If this was a real army, everyone would have died. I'm a horrible leader.

Otonashi:
It couldn't be helped.
They were anti-Angel traps.
They're useless if they're not effective.
Oh... Ah...
Care to take a breather?

Yuri:
Sure, I'd like to dry my clothes anyway.

Otonashi:
I have to say I'm kind of amazed you're able to lead everyone.
Why were you chosen to be their leader?

Yuri:
I was the first to fight back.
That's the only reason.

Otonashi:
Against Angel?

Yuri:
Right.
I used to have siblings.
I'm talking about my memories, something you lack.

Otonashi:
You mean before you came here, when you were alive?

Yuri:
That's right.
There were four of us altogether.
I was the oldest, with two little sisters and a little brother.
Our parents’ work was going well, so we lived in a very nice house.
It was like living in a mansion the way it was surrounded by nature.
It was summer break.
One afternoon while our parents were out, some strange men broke into the house.
All of a sudden, they came into the house wearing ski masks.
Not exactly summer attire, so I knew something was very wrong.
I thought because I was the oldest, I had to protect my brother and sisters.
But I didn't stand a chance, you know?
Naturally, they were after money, but they couldn't find any.
They got angry started breaking the windows and TV.
They shattered everything they could lay their hands on.
And then, they thought up the worst possible idea to find the money.
Something so cruel, so sick!

Masked robber:
You're the oldest. Don't you know where your parents keep important things?
Things your parents told you to always take care of, real good.
Or things to give robbers to make them leave?
They told you about stuff like that, right?

Young Yuri:
I don't know...
I don't know what that is!

Masked robber:
Now, go look for it.
If I don't like what you show me, I'm afraid I'll have to take your siblings from you one by one.
One dies every ten minutes unless you bring me something.

Yuri:
I was desperate as I searched the house.
My head hurt terribly.
I felt nauseated.
I was ready to pass out!
Their fates were in my hands.
I just had to find something.
But I had no idea what they'd consider valuable.

Young Yuri:
It's time!
I have to hurry!
I have to hurry!
I'll give them the biggest vase we have!
It's heavy!
It's gotta be valuable for it to be so heavy!
Ahhhh!

Yuri:
The police came 30 minutes later..
I was the only one still alive..
I don't care if I become a water flea!
I just want to defy this high and almighty God if he actually exists anyway.
I mean, it's just too unfair..
We never did anything wrong, we were just kids..
We were just kids...
I was confident I was the cool big sister up until that day, but I lost everything I wanted to protect in 30 minutes...
That's too unfair..
How could I ever forgive god for that?..

Otonashi:
You’re strong Yuri.
I'd probably want to get obliterated right away, If those were the kind of memories I had I mean.
But you’re fighting back.

Yuri:
You bet.

Otonashi:
Hey, can I ask you something?

Yuri:
Whats that?

Otonashi:
How did you die?

Yuri:
Huh?..
Moron! I didn't commit suicide! Some one who kills themselves wouldn't fight back like I do. For your information none of us killed themselves.
Now lets go! I'll make sure nothing happens to you.

Otonashi:
This is the Guild?!

Guild Workers:
It's Yurippe!
She's here!
She's okay!
It's Yurippe!

Otonashi:
Holy Smoke! So they actually make weapons here?

Guild Worker:
I can't believe you made it through all those traps. You're amazing as always!

Yuri:
What's the status on Angel?

Guild Worker:
It seems that her advances has stopped for a while but recently resumed.
She fell for another one.

Otonashi:
She's close.

Guild Worker:
Uhh Yurippe...

Yuri:
We're scrapping this place.

Guild Workers:
Huh?
What?
No way!

Guild Worker:
Yea he's right! Don't you need this place for us to make weapons?

Yuri:
What's important isn't the location or the equipment but your memories, or have you forgotten?

Guild Worker:
No..

Otonashi:
What do you mean, Yuri?

Yuri:
Something with life cannot be reborn into this world.
But we can manufacture objects.
As long as you know the mechanics and how to replicate them, you don't need any real materials.
You can make it from dirt.

Char:
But somewhere along the line, we prioritized efficiency and grew accustomed to making replicas in this factory.

Otonashi:
Is he really a high schooler?

Yuri:
We've all been using our collective memories to give life to things that were once just simple objects.

Char:
Then, let's move to the old Guild.
We abandoned it a long time ago.
There's nothing there but dirt, we can return to the surface from there.
Everybody! Get ready for evac!

Guild Worker:
And this place?

Char:
Blow it up. We can't have Angel follow us to the old Guild. That's about the only place we have left to go back to.

Guild Worker:
But we.

She's right above us!

Char:
All you need to take are your memories and your pride as good technicians. That's all you need
All right! Are you with me?

Guild Workers:
With you!

Char:
Excellent! Now set up the explosives.
Show me your team work!

Guild Workers:
Yea!!

Char:
There aren't any traps left, hurry!

Otonashi:
Uhh.. Yuri! where are you going?!

Yuri:
To buy time!

Oh you came? Are you scared?

Otonashi:
Not like I can help anyone down there.
Here she comes.

Yuri:
Let's do it!

Angel:
Guard Skill: Distortion.

Yuri:
She's responding too quickly!

Otonashi:
She can stand on her own in a close range fight..

Guild Worker 1:
Load her up!

Guild Worker 2:
You sure it wise to fire her here?

Guild Worker 1:
Just do it!

Guild Worker 3:
Listen up where'd all your brute strength go! C'mon!

Angel:
Guard Skill: Delay

Otonashi:
Stand still dammit!

Yuri:
Otonashi!

Guild Worker:
Get out of the way!

Yuri:
Guys your amazing when you want to be!
It's not easy to make something like that!
Otonashi! Over here!

Guild Worker 1:
Let's go!

Guild Worker: 2
Outta the way!

Fire!

Everyone:
Gaahhhhhhh!

Yuri:
Did it work?

Guild Worker 1:
The cannon exploded!

Guild Worker 2:
Oh well I guess we can't created things we don't know about.

Yuri:
Oh jeeze! Ya think!!

Otonashi:
Angel's getting up!

Char:
Guys! Hold her off with these!

Guild Worker 1:
Hurry and retreat!

Guild Worker 2:
Everyone has evacuated the area!

Char:
Great blow up the Guild!
You sure?

Yuri:
Do it!

Char:
Here it goes!

I haven't been here in years! There's truly nothing here.
Hahahaha what a joke!

Yuri:
One good nudge and you'll have all the dirt you need to rebuild.

Char:
It'a a horrible hideout.

Yuri:
Looks like I'll still be counting on you.

Char:
Yea. Ok let’s get to work you guys!

Guild Workers:
Yea!
Alright!
Whooooo!
C'mon guys. Let's go!

Yuri:
Hey morons are you up yet?
We abandoned the Guild and blew it up with Angel. Attention everyone! Report to the old Guild. We will quickly restock our supplies here. Report to the old Guild before Angel recovers. I repeat hurry you idiots! Yuri out.

Otonashi:
I can't believe I saved her.
What was I thinking?

Yuri:
I just want to defy this high and almighty God if he actually exists anyway...
I mean it's just too unfair..
We never did anything wrong. We were just kids.

Otonashi:
You're amazing.
No wonder everyone follows you.
You make a great leader.
