  Angel Beats!>14.OVA

-- Opening: My Soul, Your Beats --

Yuri:
I had everyone converge here for one reason.
We shall hereby begin Operation: High Tension Syndrome!

Otonashi:
Huh?! Why the lack of reaction?!

Takamastu:
I'm sorry this is the first I've heard of this Operation.

Yuri:
That's because I just came up with it.

Noda:
Yurippe, what exactly is the Operation?

Yuri:
It's quite simple actually. You only need to maintain high tension in everything you do all day, that's all.

Everyone:
Huh?

Yuri:
Be hyped about everything you do in your day. When you go somewhere, run fast. When you drink something guzzle it, If you talk, scream your head off. And remember to show your best smile.
Maintain maximum high tension with every single activity. And pretend that every one of you is enjoying the best high school life possible.

Everyone:
Huh?

Fujimaki:
So what exactly do we get out of this? Besides won’t we vanish if we actually enjoy ourselves?

Hinata:
No we won’t vanish...
Being in an operation, we must constantly feign being hyped up... It's like a horrible penalty game...
I can't believe she’s making us doing this!

Fujimaki:
Huh!? Are you serious?!

Shiina:
This is so stupid.

Yuri:
Exactly. At first it might feel like we're enduring penance, but Angel is such a goody-goody, she'll look at us and wonder why we haven't vanished. Even though we're enjoying school life more then any of use ever have. How do you think Angel will react?
Answer me! It isn't a rhetorical question!
