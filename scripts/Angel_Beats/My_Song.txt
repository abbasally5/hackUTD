  Angel Beats!>03.My Song

-- Opening: My Soul, Your Beats --

Yuri:
Why is your new song a ballad?

Iwasawa:
Is that a problem?

Yuri:
As a diversion? Yes.

Otonashi:
Uhhh what do you mean as a diversion?

Yuri:
Didn't you hear her during Tornado? She has a school rock band that's popular with the normal students. We don't do anything to directly hurt the Students. But sometimes we use them or clear them out of an area if they're in the way. It's just one of the necessary tactics in our Battle arsenal. That's when she creates a diversion.

Otonashi:
They're fans even though they're NPCs?

Hinata:
That's just goes to show how skilled and enchanting her band is.

Otonashi:
Ohhh.. Yeah..

Iwasawa:
So is it a no go?

Yuri:
Yea.. And because it's a ballad.. We won't be able to go all out and fight if everyone's is listening to some love song.

Iwasawa:
I see. Then I’ll trash it.

Otonashi:
Hmm..

Yuri:
I have an announcement to make everyone feel better. Otonashi, close the curtains.
This next Operation is going to be another attempt to infiltrate Angel's domain. The Operation is in three days.

Takamastu:
We're trying that again? But last time…

Yuri:
Yes but this time we got him with us.

Takeyama:
Hello there.

Ooyama:
He was behind your chair!

Takamatsu:
He wears glasses..

Noda:
Yurippe this isn't funny..

Fujimaki:
How is that menson member supposed to help us?

Yuri:
Now now don't be like that.

Noda:
Hah!
Fine then!
Let's see what he's got!

Otonashi:
You don't have friends do you?

Takeyama:
Hmm.. 3.14159265359 (and so on..)

Noda:
Ahhhhhhhhh!!
No please! stop it! I can't take it! Stop!

Mastushita:
Holy Math nerd, is all that Pie!?

Ooyama:
Make him stop! He's a moron!

Yuri:
Exactly.. Our weakness is that we're morons.

Otonashi:
Umm, a leader shouldn't say that.

Yuri:
The last time we tried to infiltrate our lack of intelligence was made apparent. However! This time we are bringing a genius hacker with us. Code name "Takeyama" will be on the team. Be sure to fully investigate the area. Don't miss a thing.

Takamastu:
Wasn't that his real name?

Takeyama:
Yes but I'd appreciate it if you called me Christ!

Fujimaki:
See? She ruined a cool code name. That's our Yurippe for ya.

Otonashi:
So what is Angel’s domain?

Hinata:
It’s Angel's lair.

Otonashi:
What do you mean Angel's lair? I.. I wonder what type of place she lives in. Wait why do we need to bring a hacker?

Hinata:
The core system is controlled by a computer.

Otonashi:
Huh?! So it's mechanical?!

Yuri:
She has a way to contact God in there somewhere.

Ooyama:
This operation is crazy!!

Yuri:
It'll be our second try. Angel should be in higher alert than before. I'll need Grldemo to go wild. Is that understood?

Iwasawa:
Understood.

T.K:
Goodbye! Good luck!

-- MY SONG --

Otonashi:
Perfect! I'm doing great.
Oh? I get the feeling I’m starting to fit in.
Well, guess they aren't as bad as I first thought.

So this is going to be their wild diversion?

Yui:
Ahh!

Otonashi:
Oh sorry. Di-did I scare you?

Yui:
Oh it's you!

Otonashi:
Uhhmm do you know me?

Yui:
Yep! The upperclassman who always carries around the big ax warned me to be careful ‘cause you’re a jinx. That's what I heard, uh-huh!

Otonashi:
That jerk...
But will it be okay for them to do this in the gym?

Yui:
Of cours not! It's totally unheard-of. They're publicly announcing it instead of holding a guerrilla performance. The teachers won’t let this thing slide so who knows what'll happen? But I heard it's important to gather a bunch of people despite the risk! And I listen to what I hear ya know.

Otonashi:
Girls Dead Monster eh?
But the way this looks it's kinda.

Yui:
Yui! I'm still a flunky with the diversion team. But even so I’m happy! I mean com'on! I get to work with Grldemo! Have you heard of them? Girls Dead Monster is amazing!! It's Grldemo for short! They're a powerful girls only band above all else the vocalist and guitarist, Iwasawa is incredible!! She writes the song and the lyrics!! My favorite song is Crow Song! The eloquence of simplicity is just too cool! Those lyrics match Iwasawa perfectly!! The song that really pumps me up is Alchemy! Alchemy is the most beautiful―Hey, I’m not done yet! Alchemy is!―Alchemy is!―

Otonashi:
This isn't the time to be goofing off! You should be working your butt off for your beloved Grldemo!

Yui:
Uh! Oh! You're right! Later. Seeya!

Hisako:
Oops!
Sorry I'll restring it right away.

Iwasawa:
Then let's take five.
Huh?

Otonashi:
You are so passionate.
I can see why the regular students go nuts over you.
I was mesmerized.

Iwasawa:
Thanks a lot.
I hear.. You've lost your memories.

Otonashi:
Pretty much..

Iwasawa:
That's a blessing for ya.

Otonashi:
Are your memories also uhh..

Iwasawa:
Did you hear about someone’s memories?

Otonashi:
Yea Yuri's

Iwasawa:
Yuri's huh?
Hers are the worst
Mine aren't as bad as hers.

Otonashi:
Not as bad?

Iwasawa:
It's nothing impressive.
I couldn't sing my beloved songs.
That's all..

My parents were always fighting..
I didn't have a bedroom. So I would always curl up in a corner and plug my ears up when they started screaming..
I had to close myself up in my own shell.
There was nowhere for me to rest..
That's when I found a band called Sad Machine.
The vocalist was from a bad home environment.. Like me.
When ever things got rough.
He would cover his ears with earphones and escape into the world of music.
I started doing the same.
I felt like my problems were blown away.
The vocalist was screaming out for me!
He was pleading for me!
The kids acting like everything is normal are wrong.
And the kids crying are right.
Those of us who are lonely are true humans.
He screamed out to the unfairness of the world as he rashed out and shattered it!
He.. Saved me..

I found this one rainy day in the trash.
That's when I started singing.
I had music when I thought I had nothing.

Teacher:
Are you serious? With your grades you could go anywhere!

Young Iwasawa:
I.. I don't wanna rely on my parents anymore..

Iwasawa:
I got a part time job started saving up money.
I was constantly auditioning at Recording Studios.
I was gonna leave that house when I graduated, move to Tokyo and then... I was gonna live off my music..
Or so I thought..

Young Iwasawa:
I.. I guess I must be tired..
Can't play my guitar like this..
I should cancel my street performance tonight and rest...

Iwasawa:
When I awoke next.
I was unable to speak. A head trauma had caused a cerebral stroke, inducing aphasia.
A blow from one of my parents fights caused it..
I cursed my fate.
There was nowhere to run..
That was how my life.. came to an end..

Hisako:
Iwasawa?

Iwasawa:
Oh Hisako? Everything okay?

Hisako:
We're getting bored in here!

Iwasawa:
Mr. Amnesia!

Otonashi:
Whaa?

Iwasawa:
You can have that!

Otonashi:
Heheh..
Just now..
Those are the eyes of somebody who curses the unfairness of life..
She had a terrible life, too...
It's not like everyone's afraid of becoming a water flea..
The people here all of them.. Are trying to defy God..
They were given such unfair lives..
So they're fighting back..

Yusa:
Angel has made an appearance.

Yuri:
Got it!
Takeyama.

Takeyama:
I'm going to be using a program that can quickly decrypt the password. It'll be done soon, also, can you please call me Christ?
Excellent it we're in!

Yuri:
Very well done Takeyama now copy all of the data!

Takeyama:
That will take entirely to long! I'm afraid I would need at least a half an hour and would you please call me- Aaarghhhh!

Hinata:
Why don't we steal the hard drive?

Yuri:
She'll know we were here!

Takeyama:
Now what?

Yuri:
Now I want you to show me any suspicious looking data on her hard drive!

Takeyama:
I'm Christ!

Hinata:
A list of the students?

Yuri:
It's just NPC's no wait we're there to.

Otonashi:
It's a dumb roster of a bunch of students! It's not any suspicious data! Your all just braking the law! Your criminals!

Noda:
Shut up!

Yusa:
The diversion unit has been suppressed. Angels going back..

Yuri:

Hinata:

Yuri:
Let's fall back.

Student No. 3:

-- My Song Starts To Play --

Teachers:
Huh?

Yui:
A new song?

Yuri:
Takeyama!

Takeyama:
I'm on it! But call me Christ!

Iwasawa:
This is my life..
I wanted to sing like this..
This is why I was born..
I wanna save someone..
Just as I was saved..
I finally..
Finally found it..

-- End Of My Song --

Hisako:
Iwasawa?..

Hinata:
Alright can you please give us the down low on what we found.

Yuri:
Hmm Angel has been developing her own abilities.
She's using the same method we are to make our weapons.

Ooyama:
What does that mean?

Yuri:
I'm not sure..
I can't say anything for curtain..

Fujimaki:
Why not? Your being a little too vague Yurippe.

Yuri:
For her to do the same things we do..
It could mean the worst possible scenario for us..
It would mean there is no god..
If she's an Angel then, why doesn't she get her powers from god? Why does she have to develop them for her self? It just doesn't make any sense..

Takeyama:
And here's another problem..
Where did Iwasawa go?

Noda:
Didn't Angel obliterate her?

Hinata:
During her performance?

Noda:
Then what do you think happened?

Ooyama:
So who do you think kidnapped Iwasawa and-

Yuri:
No one did.
She accepted her fate..
That's all there is to it..

Otonashi:
Well I learned one thing.
Obeying Angel and enjoying school life wasn't the only way to get obliterated..
