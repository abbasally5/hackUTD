  Angel Beats!>04.Day Game

Noda:
You want her to replace Iwasawa?

Fujimaki:
No way!

Hinata:
Huh?

Yui:
The name's Yui! Nice to meet ya!

Hinata:
Who is she?

Otonashi:
Weren't you listening at all?
She's the candidate for Grldemo's new vocalist.

Takamastu:
Hey kid, Girls Dead Monster is a rock band. Aren't you confusing it with a pop group?

Yui:
No! I can sing it right! Listen to me sing before you judge me!

Noda:
Well, at least she's got the look down pat.

-- Opening: My Soul, Your Beats (Grldemo Version) --

Yui:
Yaaay!! Everyone, thanks for coming today! Yaahoooooo!

-- Day Game Angel Beats Episode 04 --

Everyone:
HUH!?

Ooyama:
Is this part of her performance?

TK:
Oh dude...

Hinata:
Is this death metal?!

TK:
Maybe...

Yui:
I'm- I'm- Dying..

Otonashi:
No I think that was an accident.

Yuri:
She's awfully bubbly.
She's the exact opposite of Iwasawa's cool beauty.

Takamastu:
I have doubts about letting her be the lead vocalist for Girls Dead Monster.

Mastushita:
Should we look for someone else?

Hinata:
Sounds good!

Yui:
Hey! I sing it great! I'm a huge fan of Iwasawa... I can sing all her songs!

Hinata:
Sorry, but you didn't touch my heart.

Takamastu:
Not in the least.

Fujimaki:
Nope.

Yui:
Hey! Don't dash a promising starlet's hopes with such vague reviews--and you call yourselves upperclassmen!
How dare you!

Hinata:
She sure is noisy!

Noda:
And we already have issues with her behavior.

Ooyama:
So what now?

Yuri:
Uhhh well at least she's motivated.

Fujimaki:
She's just a groupie.

Yuri:
We'll let the band members take over from here.

Yui:
Seriously!?
Sweeeeeeeeeet!!
I get to team up with the guitarist, Hisako! Hisako's murderous riff is absolutely killer! She can burn the house down! And I'd help!

Hinata:
You'll get fired.

Yui:
What!?

Takamastu:
They'll fire you.

Yui:
Did I say something wrong?! Seriously, you aren't giving me a chance here! I mean, don't you know that-- (Talks while Yuri is talking)

Yuri:
(sigh) We can't hold any big operations during the ball tournament with the band like this.

Otonashi:
A ball tournament? So we actually hold one?

Yuri:
Of course we do. This is a normal high school.

Hinata:
Are we going to sit and watch?

Yuri:
Naturally, we'll be participating.

Otonashi:
But wait! Won't we get obliterated?

Yuri:
It’ll be guerrilla warfare, of course. Alright, now listen up you guys! First step I want you to do is I want you to gather up some members and make your own teams--lose to the normal students and it's a penalty death game.

Everyone:
What!?

Yui:
Why don't people pay attention to me!? I don't know what-- (Talks while they're talking)

Otonashi:
She's pissed off that we fail at everything, isn't she?

Hinata:
It's our job to train every day. She's checking the results. Otonashi, I really need you, man.

Otonashi:
Sure you’re not gay?

Hinata:
Noo! I-I need you for the team!
Let's team up, Otonashi! We're doomed if we lose. Yurippe is serious!

Otonashi:
Do you have anyone else in mind for the team?

Hinata:
Haha, just leave it to me!
I’ve survived off my popularity.
We’ll make a kick-butt team.

Huuuh? So you’re on Takamatsu’s team?

Hisako:
Yep!

Hinata:
Oh man! I don’t get it! Why didn’t you wait for me?!

Hisako:
Waiting for your invitation makes no sense whatsoever.
I had to accept his invitation.

Hinata:
…And here she’s great at athletics.
This sucks!

Otonashi:
So much for your popularity.

Hinata:
I’ve got no choice now.
It’s unfair to the others, but let’s invite Class Captain Matsushita the Fifth.

Otonashi:
I bet he's already taken.

Hinata:
Don’t worry.
He’s waited for me.
You see, we’re like bosom buddies.
Hehe, that’s kind of embarrassing.

Matsushita:
About that, I’m already on Takeyama’s team.

Hinata:
Why?!

Matsushita:
I didn't have a reason to turn him down.

Hinata:
Woah Woah hold on just a darn minute! Why'd you do it?! I believed in you so much man!

Mastushita:
Well he said he'd give me all the beef udon tickets he gets from now on.

Hinata:
...Meat?

Otonashi:
Earlier he said "We're like bosom buddies," quickly followed by "That's kinda embarrassing."

Hinata:
Noo! don't tell him that!

Dammit. Alright then, next up is TK. C'mon TK don't let me down.

Otonashi:
Come to think of it, why does everyone call him TK anyway?

Hinata:
He calls himself TK. No one knows why. No one knows his real name. He's shrouded in mystery, but knowing TK I have a gut feeling that he won't let me down.

Hinata:
God damn it!

Otonashi:
So much for TK’s loyalty to you.

So, what type of ball game are we talking about here anyway?

Hinata:
It’s baseball.

Otonashi:
So, we need seven more teammates…
Isn’t that impossible?

Yui:
Looks like you’re in a bind.
Hinata&Otonashi:
Huh?

Yui:
Hahaha.

Hinata:
My, if it isn’t the death metal girl with a killer performance!

Yui:
Do I look like I’d perform like that?!

Hinata:
You most certainly do.
So? What do you want anyway?

Yui:
You need more teammates, right?
I’d be a big asset?

Hinata:
An asset?
No, wait, if a ball hit you dead in the face, the pitcher would get disqualified.
You’re a big hitter!
Perfect! You’re in!

Yui:
You sure your brain didn’t melt and ooze outta your nose?!

Hinata:
Are you little! I’m your upperclassman!

Yui:
Excuse me, what I meant to ask "Did your brain melt and slip out through your nose?"

Hinata:
Hell no!

Yui:
Sir, that hurt!

Hinata:
Quit complaining! I’m hurtin’ too!

Otonashi:
But it looks like she has good reflexes than me.

Hinata:
Otonashi, what’s gotten into you?!
I don’t want people to think we’re friends with this screwball.

Yui:
That hurt…

Otonashi:
I hate to break it to you, but we aren't getting anyone you had your heart set on.

Yui:
Yeah, yeah, I saw the while thing.
That’s why I’ve come to offer my help, mew.

Hinata:
I dare you to say that again.

Yui:
My help, mew!

Hinata:
I don’t do that [xxx] for it [xxxxx].

Yui:
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!

Otonashi:
[xxxx] Please get going.

Hinata:
Shiina, where are you? C'mon out! Shiina! Huh?!

Shiina:
What is it?

Hinata:
I was looking for you.
You've got great reflexes, right?

Shiina:
I wouldn't know about all that.

Hinata:
I know you'd be great for the team.
It's baseball! Let's play baseball!!

Shiina:
Ever since that day... I keep running it over and over in my head how I coulda lost to that newbie.

Hinata:
Are you talking about Operation Parachute to the Guild?
Otonashi's become a legend because he was the only survivor.

Otonashi:
Oh, c'mon. I was just lucky.

Shiina:
I just don't get it. I should be stringer than you in every possible way.

Otonashi:
I bet.

Shiina:
But if I was inferior to you in any way, it would be in concentration.

Otonashi:
Nah, I think you have way better concentration than me.

Shiina:
Ever since that day... I've been balancing this stupid bloom on the tip of my finger.

Yui:
She's a morn.

Hinata:
Yeah, but she's a powerful moron.

Shiina:
It's perfect timing. Let's fight, kid.

Otonashi:
How can fight when you're holding a broom?

Hinata:
Through baseball, of course!
Just see who gets voted most valuable player or something.
But you guys just can't fight one-on-one!

Shiina:
Humph. Very well, then.

Otonashi:
I don't have to balance a broom, do I?

Shiina:
Of course not, this will make the gap in our concentration levels obvious.

Hinata:
Okay, then it's settled!

Yui:
It means we're recruiting nothing but morons!

Otonashi:
We're up to four players.

Hinata:
No, darn, I guess we're gonna have invite him any way.

No one will will invite him to their team.
He's impulsive and only obeys orders from Yurippe.

Yuri:
Bluntly put, he's another moron.

Hinata:
But you can use morons!
And look, no one compares with him when it comes to swinging around sticks.

Noda:
Humpf, so you've finally come.
It's time to finish our fight!

Hinata:
Yeah,yeah, yeah, but first preliminary.
We need to see which of you has superior athletic ability at the ball game. 

Noda:
Oh yeah.

Hinata:
Strength alone isn't enough to grab Yurippe's attention.

Noda:
Humpf, very well.

Yui:
Moron! He doesn't even realize he's being used.

Battlefront member:
Sorry.

Otonashi:
All the Battlefront members have been recruited by other teams.

Shiina:
There's just five of us. What now?
