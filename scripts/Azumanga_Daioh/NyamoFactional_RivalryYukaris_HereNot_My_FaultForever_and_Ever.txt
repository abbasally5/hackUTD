 Chiyo:
 Hi! Excuse me.
 Did you want something, Miss Kurosawa?

Nyamo:
 Oh, Chiyo-chan.
 I'm sorry but I had to call you in today.
 I just received this in the mail.
 Here, your swimsuit.

Chiyo:
 Ah, thank you very much.

Nyamo:
 Now I can special order swimsuits,
 but not the pool, which will be deeper than you're used to.
 I want you to be extra careful, okay?

Chiyo:
 I will.

Yukari:
 Nyamo!
 What do you say we go drinking after school is let out today.
 Right now, the bar Yotchan in front of the train station is having a major special on those draft beers you like so much.
 And two-for-one you call it 'cause it's ladies' night.

Nyamo:
 I'm trying to have a serious conversation here so I'd appreciate it if you quit bugging me.

Yukari:
 You shouldn't be so serious, Nyamo.
 It's bad for your health.

Nyamo:
 Oh, shut up!

Chiyo:
 Excuse me.
 What exactly is Nyomo?

Yukari:
 Oh, it's short for Minamo.
 It was a nickname from our school days.

Chiyo:
 Oh.

Nyamo:
 I told you, stop using that nickname at school.

Yukari:
 Come on! Who cares, huh?

Nyamo:
 What you do with your stuff in private is one thing,
 but you should tidy up when you're at school
 I mean, can't you do something about your desk?

Yukari:
 Look, "Mom", all this stuff here is organized in its own special way.
 I know perfectly well where everything is.

Nyamo:
 Okay, then give me back the dictionary I lent you.

Yukari:
 All right, sorry.
 Let's see. Dictionary, dictionary.
 Right here, huh?

Chiyo:
 Watch out!

Yukari, Nyamo:
 Whoa.

Chiyo:
 Don't just sit there watching! Help!
 Ah!

Nyamo:
 Chiyo-chan!
 Are you okay?

Chiyo:
 Miss Yukari, please say you'll clean up, please tidy up!

Yukari:
 Yeah, yeah, I know.

Chiyo:
 Ah!

Yukari:
 Chiyo-chan!

Osaka:
 Wow.
 You're saying Miss Kurosawa and Miss Yukari both went to high school together?

Chiyo:
 That's right.
 Not only that, they are alumni at this very school.

Tomo:
 If we're taking about being in school together, we outrank them easy.

Osaka:
 What do you mean "outrank"?

Tomo:
 See, the truth of the matter is Yomi and I have been together since I started grade school.

Chiyo:
 Wow, that's really incredible, Tomo.
 I don't have anyone that's been with me since I was in grade school.

Yomi:
 Yeah, I bet you don't.

Tomo:
 Uh-huh.

Tomo:
 So, I know lots of secrets about Yomi that you guys don't.
 All kinds of good stuff.
 Things like ...

Yomi:
 Hold it!
 Just what are you gonna say?

Tomo:
 The terror of the moldy bread.

Osaka:
 Moldy?

Chiyo:
 Bread?

Tomo:
 Back in our grade school days, Yomi left some bread in her desk overnight and it grew moldy and developed into something terrible!
 On top of that, the mold grew cognizant and our troubles thus began!
 There we were holed up in the science preparation room.
 But with a single alcohol lamp, we held the swarm of mold at bay!

Osaka:
 Whoa.

Yomi:
 Chiyo-chan, let's go.

Tomo:
 That's when I had a brilliant flash of inspiration!
 If we got the mold remover from the bathroom, then we'd be able to defeat them.

Osaka:
 Oh.

Osaka:
 Oh, I see.
 The story 'bout the mold aliens was all made up!

Yomi:
 Why would you think it was real?

Osaka:
 There was a real sense of reality to it.

Tomo:
 Of course there was.
 It was based on a true story.

Yomi:
 No, it was not!

Chiyo:
 Oh, it's Miss Kurosawa.

Tomo:
 Yo, Miss Kurosawa.

Nyamo:
 What is it?

Tomo:
 Hey, we just heard you and Yukari were classmates back when you two were in high school?

Nyamo:
 Mm-hm, we were.

Osaka:
 Can you tell us what kind of student Miss Yukari was back then?

Nyamo:
 Let's see, there's a lot of stories for me to choose from.

Yukari:
 Love letter! Love letter, la-la-lovey, lovey letter, love letter! Love letter, lovey-dovey-dovey-dovey-dovey love letter! La-la-la-la-la-la-la, love letter, love letter......

Nyamo:
 Hmmmmm!
 But most of them are pretty boring.
 N-Not much to say...
 Hmmmmm!

Yomi:
 Whoa, Yukari must have something on her.

 Student1:
Hey, who do you think is the cooler teacher?
Miss Kurosawa or Miss Yukari?

Student2:
Come on, that's a no-brainer.
Miss Yukari, of course.

Student1:
Hahahaha!
What are you, a comedian or something?
Kurosawa is way more...
Aw!

Yukari:
 Hahahaha!

Student3:
I have an idea: why don't you talk to Miss Kurosawa and she tells you?

Student4:
Yeah, I think I will.
Miss Kurosawa just might understand.

Yukari:
 Anyone over here need a teacher that you can easily talk to?
 Come on! Don't be shy!

Yukari:
 I swear, that Nyamo.
 What is it that makes her so popular?
 Hm?

Nyamo:
 Here we go!

Students:
Okay!

Yukari:
 Ah-ha, I see.

Yukari:
 Basketball!

Students:
Huh?

Yukari:
 Now is the Basketball era!
 Come sweat with your teacher and live your youth to its fullest potential.
 I want everybody together inside the gymnasium!

Yukari:
 Assemble now!

Yukari:
 We're Team Yukari!

Tomo, Yomi:
 Yay.

Osaka:
 We're Team Sea Slug!

Chiyo, Kaorin:
 Huh?

Chiyo:
 But, why?

Kaorin:
Sea slugs are so...

Osaka:
 Go Team Sea Slug!

Chiyo, Kaorin:
 Yay.

Yukari:
 Okay, we'll say whoever wins one game is the ultimate victor.
 Also the losers get to buy the winners juice.
 You got that?

Students:
What?

Kaorin:
We're making a bet?

Osaka:
 Is a teacher allowed to make bets?

Yukari:
 It won't be exciting unless we're betting.
 Besides, like hell I'm gonna be exercising with no incentive or reward in sight.

Nyamo:
 Huh?

Tomo:
 All right! Yukari scores!

Chiyo:
 Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

Yukari:
 Come on!
 Here you go!
 Jump up!
 Come on!
 Get up there.
 Oh...
 Too bad.
 Heh heh.

Nyamo:
 Yukari!

Yukari:
 Wha-What, Nyamo?

Nyamo:
 Chiyo-chan, you wanna trade places?

Chiyo:
 Yeah!

Yukari:
 Hey, hey! No fair adding a teacher!

Nyamo:
 You're a teacher too, aren't you?

Yukari:
 What are you talking about?
 You're a P.E. teacher.
 It's different.

Nyamo:
 Ha!

Yukari:
 What the... Hey!

Tomo:
 You're not getting past us!

Yomi:
 We're gonna stop you!

Kaorin:
Amazing.

Yukari:
 No way! Not so fast!

Nyamo:
 Ha!

Tomo:
 Sweet shot!

Chiyo:
 Miss Kurosawa, you're totally awesome!

Osaka:
 That's a P.E. teacher for ya.

Yukari:
 I just played a little in high school.

Yomi:
 Wow, well, it sure makes a difference when you've played seriously.

Yukari:
 Yeah, but the thing is, I only joined the team part-time when they were short on people.

Chiyo:
 That's so impressive!

Osaka:
 You moved so fast, I could hardly see you.

Tomo:
 Yeah, no kidding! But she is a P.E. teacher.

Yukari:
 Aaaahhhhh!

Tomo:
 Whoa, Yukari's lost it!
 Come on, Yukari, stop it, please!

Yukari:
 You said you wanted cola, right, Nyamo?

Nyamo:
 Thanks, Yukari, I appreciate it.

Student:
Miss Kurosawa, can I talk to you for a sec?

Nyamo:
 Sure.

Yukari:
 Hehehehe.

Nyamo:
 I'm really sorry, Yukari.
 But something urgent just came up.
 You can have that cola if you want it.
 Bye!

Yukari:
 Oh, what? But Nyamo...
 Arghhhh!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:4:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Nyamo:
 Yes?

Yukari:
 I'm here!

Nyamo:
 Yeah, yeah.

Yukari:
 Yo, Nyamo!

Nyamo:
 You know, it's pretty rare that you pay me a visit like this.

Yukari:
 Oh, really? Is it that rare?

Nyamo:
 Well, either way, come on in.

Yukari:
 The thing is, there's been all kinds of construction going on since this morning.
 You wouldn't believe how noisy it's gotten lately.

Nyamo:
 Really?

Yukari:
 Well, good night, Nyamo.

Nyamo:
 You're gonna sleep?!
 I don't believe this.

Yukari:
 Argh! Nyamo!

Nyamo:
 Yes, What is it?

Yukari:
 What the heck is that?!

Nyamo:
 That?

Yukari:
 This! This thing! It's all squishy!

Nyamo:
 Oh, I just bought that pillow the other day.

Yukari:
 How much did it cost?

Nyamo:
 About 10,000 yen.

Yukari:
 You damn bourgeois!
 Get out!

Nyamo:
 And go where?

Yukari:
 I'm not sure what to make of it.
 This strangely rich, smooth, and springy texture is so...

Nyamo:
 Comfy?
 It helps you sleep really well.

Yukari:
 It's French, isn't it?

Nyamo:
 Actually, I think it was made in Denmark.

Yukari:
 Huh.

Yukari:
 You're absolutely right.

Nyamo:
 You can tell?

Yukari:
 All right, let's put you to the test to see how well you'll help me, Dutch boy.

Nyamo:
 Dutch?

Nyamo:
 Um, you've flipped the pillow upside down.


Nyamo:
 Hello.

Delivery man:
I have a package for you.
It's from a Mr. Yamazaki in Hokkaido.
Here you go.

Nyamo:
 Oh, it's from my uncle.

Yukari:
 Hokkaido!

Nyamo:
 Hey, wait a sec, Yukari!

Yukari:
 When you think of Hokkaido, your mind automatically goes to fresh crabs, sea urchins, and delicious salmon stew.
 What the hell?!

Nyamo:
 I guess it wasn't food.
 Imagine that.

Nyamo:
 Hey, what do you think you are doing?

Yukari:
 I'm calling this Yamazaki bastard to tell him we need to switch this with a fresh order of crabs.

Nyamo:
 Huh?

Nyamo:
 Yes, Hello?
 Is this the Yamazaki residence by any chance?

Yukari:
 Stop it!
 You can't make demands about gifts, especially when they aren't yours!
 Please pardon me, got the wrong number.

Yukari:
 What the hell are you gonna do with this stupid bear?!

Nyamo:
 I don't know.
 Maybe display it by the front door...

Yukari:
 You could display crabs too!

Nyamo:
 You don't display crabs.

Yukari:
 I got it. Return to sender!

Nyamo:
 What?
 Hey, Wait!

Nyamo:
 Could you knock it off already?

Yukari:
 Jeez, Nyamo, you're always so worried about appearances!
 That's why you can't find a boyfriend.

Nyamo:
 Tha... That has nothing to do with it!

Yukari:
 Even in college, you were worried about it.
 And while you dragged and dragged and dragged your feet,
 one of our juniors went right under your nose...

Nyamo:
 Argh!

Yukari:
 What are you doing?
 It's all true, isn't it?

Nyamo:
 Some things you're allowed to say and some things you aren't.

Yukari:
 You're always.... no...

Nyamo:
 What are you talking about? You're just as bad! At least I know how...

Delivery man:
Excuse me, I need one of you to sign for the package.

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:6:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Yukari:
 You wanna go out for drinks?

Nyamo:
 Yes, sure.

Nyamo:
 So where to? Somewhere close?
 Or do you wanna go all the way to the station?

Yukari:
 Hmmm.
 I guess I'll leave this decision up to the sponsor this time around.

Nyamo:
 Just who are you calling the sponsor?

Yukari:
 I'm simply stating that it's your turn to treat me today.

Nyamo:
 You mind telling me what kind of nonsense you're talking about this time?!

Yukari:
 Nonsense?
 It's very simple.
 You'll take my part of the bill and then...

Nyamo:
 Shut up! I don't wanna hear it!

Yukari:
 Now, now.
 I'll treat you next time we go out, okay?

Nyamo:
 That's a lie!
 It's a certifiable falsehood.

Yukari:
 Oh, come off it!
 When have I ever lied to you?

Nyamo:
 Ah! Do me a favor! Stay right there!

Yukari:
 What? Where are you going?

Foreigner:
Excuse me.

Nyamo:
 Whoa.

Foreigner:
Blah, blah..

Nyamo:
 Um, yes! <Spanish>Uno momento<Spanish>, Mr. Blah Blah.
 I get friend... I get my friend, she speak your language.

Foreigner:
Oh?

Nyamo:
 Oh man, where the heck did Yukari run off to at a crucial time like...Huh?
 Ah! Hey, what do you think you're doing hiding here and watching?!

Yukari:
 Well, it was too funny to pass up.

Nyamo:
 You're the language expert!
 Do something!

Yukari:
 Hi! Hola Mr. Foreigner.
 Blah, blah, blah...
 Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...

Foreigner:
Oh! Blah, blah.

Yukari:
 Blah, blah, blah, blah, biddy, blah, blah, biddy, blah, blah.

Foreigner:
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Nyamo:
 Wow, it's almost like you're not stupid.

Yukari:
 What did you say, you, you P.E. teacher?

Yukari:
 Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Foreigner:
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Yukari:
 Blah, biddy, blah, blah, biddy, blah.

Yukari, Foreigner:
 Hahahahaha...

Nyamo:
 Why. Hey, what's so funny? Tell me.

Yukari:
 He told me that P.E. teachers are stupid where he comes from, too.
 How about that?

Nyamo:
 Shut up! You liar!


Yomi:
 Hey, isn't that Osaka?

Tomo:
 Yeah, you're right.
 Osaka!
 Hey, Osaka!

Osaka:
 Tomo 'n' Yomi, I just want you to know that I'll never forget you two.

Tomo:
 Wow, where did that come from?

Yomi:
 Are you transferring again or something?

Osaka:
 No, not that.
 It's 'cause it's "one life, one meetin'."

Tomo:
 What... is she talking about?

Yomi:
 It means when you meet people you're supposed to treat the occasion as if you'll never see them again.

Tomo:
 Yeah. So what about it?

Osaka:
 Well, I don't really understand it.
 But you just gotta cherish these "one life, one meetin'"s as they come to you.

Tomo:
 Oh, now I see.
 It's like that "Shame on the road is written off."

Yomi:
 What?!

Osaka:
 Oh, yeah, that could be a lot of fun.

Tomo:
 Yeah! Let's sing at the tops of our lungs right here!

Osaka:
 You know what I wanna do?
 I've always wanted to try slipping on a banana peel!

Tomo:
 One life, one meeting!

Osaka:
 One life, one meetin'!

Tomo:
 One life, one meeting!

Osaka:
 One life, one meetin'!


Nyamo:
 What the hell is wrong with you!
 You didn't even know if a tomato was a fruit till you got into college!

Yukari:
 And you were secretly taking commemorative photos in front of Senior Takeda's home!

Nyamo:
 That's ancient history!

Yukari:
 Oh, but I enjoy digging up people's pasts!

Nyamo:
 No! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

Tomo:
 Well, going home?

Osaka:
 I think so.

Yomi:
 Wait. What happened to the singing?
 You know "Shame on the road is written off," and all that kind of stuff?

Tomo:
 I was thinking, just 'cause "you can write it off" doesn't mean "go out of your way and do something stupid."

Yomi:
 A wise decision.

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:8:&lt;h1&gt; 
 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:10:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Yukari:
 Yummy!
 My friend, "shame on the road is written off," so there, my friend.

Nyamo:
 What do you mean, "on the road"?
 This is most definitely in our neighborhood.

Yukari:
 <French>Au contraire!<French>
 Neighborhood means as far as you can walk in flip-flops and not kill your feet.

Nyamo:
 Fine, fine, I really don't care either way.

Yukari:
 All right! Well, since it seems I've won, you get to pick up today's tab.

Nyamo:
 Wait, why do I have to...

Yukari:
 Oh, don't worry, don't worry.
 You shouldn't sweat the small stuff so much, you know.
 Hey...

Yukari:
 Here, you little...

Nyamo:
 I've been meaning to tell you this for a long time,
 Um, you don't hold your chopsticks the right way.

Yukari:
 What's that?
 What about my chopsticks?

Nyamo:
 Huh, see the way you've got them set up, your chopsticks are running parallel to each other.
 You gotta hold them so they open up in the back.

Yukari:
 So, like this?

Nyamo:
 No, no, no. Look here.

Yukari:
 All right then, let's try it.
 Like this?

Nyamo:
 No, uh-uh.

Yukari:
 Like this?

Nyamo:
 Would you mind not breaking apart the croquettes?
 Like I said, you won't pick up anything doing that.
 Here, like this.

Yukari:
 Oh.

Nyamo:
 Pretty simple, isn't it?
 Just like this.
 And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this...

Yukari:
 Argh!

Yukari:
 Ah, yummy!
 And that, my friend, is why I'm the chicken!

Nyamo:
 Don't you think you've had a bit too much today?
 I mean really.

Yukari:
 I will be fine, Madam Captain!
 I must continue until the end!

Nyamo:
 Continue until what end?

Yukari:
 Education!
 In other words, it's like this yakitori!
 I'm the meat and you're the green onions.
 You get me?!

Nyamo:
 No, not at all.

Yukari:
 That's why you're the stupid one.

Nyamo:
 What did you say, you...

Yukari:
 Yukari is a language teacher, so she'll marry and get richer.

Nyamo:
 Huh?

Yukari:
 I'm in my happy place...

Nyamo:
 He... hey! What are you... Yukari!
 Oh, man! You know what happens when you pass out.

Yukari:
 Sleep barfing?

Nyamo:
 You better not! I'm not your maid.
 Hey, don't you fall asleep!

Yukari:
 Look, you're the one bought that pillow, remember?!

Nyamo:
 Oh, what am I supposed to do with you?

Nyamo:
 Come on, walk straight!

Yukari:
 I don't feel...

Nyamo:
 What?!

Yukari:
 <Barfing>
 I'm in a bit of a pinch here...

Nyamo:
 Yeah, you sure are.
 You're always knocking 'em back.
 and each time, it's the same thing.
 All right, let's go.

Yukari:
 Believe in yourself!

Nyamo:
 You do that.

Yukari:
 Oh my god...

Nyamo:
 Honestly!
 I'm gonna get us a taxi.
 Let's get to the street.

Yukari:
 Fire the engines!
 Damn the torpedoes!

Nyamo:
 Stop it!!!

Tomo:
Next up is summer, swimsuits, and pool, pool, pool!

Yomi:
Hey, isn't it still spring?
I think you're getting a little ahead of yourself?

Kimura:
The pool is very nice.

Tomo:
Our uniforms'll change to short sleeves too!

Yomi:
Well, long sleeves would get hot.

Kimura:
Yes. Wearing your gym clothes...
No, no, no no.
Your swimsuits to class would be nice too.

Everyone:
Next time, summer's in full swing!
Azumanga Daioh! Look forward to it!

Kimura:
It'll be better if you're wet.

Everyone:
Shut up!
