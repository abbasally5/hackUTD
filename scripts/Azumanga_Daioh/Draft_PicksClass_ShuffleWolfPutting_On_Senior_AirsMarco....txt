 Yukari:
 That's it.
 Third semester is over!
 You may all move up to second year!

Everyone:
Yeah!

Chiyo:
 Rise!
 Attention!
 Bow!


Osaka:
 Uh...

Chiyo:
 Miss Osaka!

Osaka:
 Oh, hey, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
 Huh?
 Hey, don't tear up, why don't you cheer up, Miss Osaka?

Osaka:
 I know...

Chiyo:
 Miss Osaka?

Osaka:
 It won't be too long now, we're gonna be second years, huh.

Chiyo:
 That's right, we're gonna become second year students.

Osaka:
 Becomin' second years means the class is gonna get shuffled...

Chiyo:
 Oh, I guess that's true!

Osaka:
 It'd be nice if I could be in the same class with you again, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
 We can! Not just can, We will be!

Osaka:
 And Tomo and Yomi and Miss Sakaki too.
 It'd be nice if we could be in the same class with them again.

Chiyo:
 We can be!
 I know we can be in the same class again!

Osaka:
 It'd also be nice if Miss Yukari was our homeroom teacher again.

Chiyo:
 She can be! She can be!
 We'll all be together just like first year.
 Huh...

Yukari:
 Oh, you don't have to worry about that.

Chiyo, Osaka:
 Huh?

Chiyo:
 Mi-Miss Yukari?

Yukari:
 I'm your homeroom teacher for next year too.

Chiyo:
 Huh... Y-You are? Really?

Yukari:
 Hey, our class could sure use your fighting power, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
 Yay! Thank you, Miss Yukari!
 All right! All right! Woohoo! Yay! Yay!
 Hurray! Hurray!
 All right! All right!
 Hip hip hurray!


Kaorin:
I'll get to be in the same class with Miss Sakaki next year.
I won't be in the same class.
I will. I won't. I will. I won't. I will.
I-I-I...
Huh?

Yukari, Kaorin:
 You will. I will.
 You won't. I won't.
 You will. I will.
 You won't. I won't.
 You will. I will.
 You won't. I won't.

Kaorin:
I... I won... won... I... won... won... I...

Yukari:
 Huh?

Kaorin:
Huh?

Kimura:
We could be together, Kaorin.

Kaorin:
Why'd you guess? Go away!


 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:2:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Tomo:
 Woohoo! It's a new school year!
 Haaa!
 Viva, I like Class Shuffle.
 Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

Kaorin:
Mm...

Chiyo:
 It'll be great if we're all together.
 Just like how Tomo and Yomi were in the same class since grade school.
Yomi:
 Uh.

Chiyo:
 I don't have anyone that I've been with since grade school, so I really envy you two.

Tomo:
 You being sarcastic?

Chiyo:
 Huh?


Chiyo:
 I made it!
 Look, look, I'm in Miss Yukari's class!

Tomo:
 Hey, me too!

Yomi:
 Yeah, no way.

Sakaki:
 I am too.

Osaka:
 Not here...

Chiyo:
 We're all here together!

Osaka:
 'Cept me.
 I ain't here.


Kimura:
Kaorin!


Osaka:
 ......

Tomo:
 It's like she gave you a notice, huh?
 Man, Yukari sure is harsh.

Osaka:
 Chiyo-chan...

Chiyo:
 Don't worry.
 You'll make some new friends right away!

Yomi:
 Wait a minute.

Tomo:
 Spirit in...

Yomi:
 I said "wait!"
 Wouldn't this Osaka be you?

Osaka
 Uh...

Everyone:
Uh...

Osaka:
 Wait, do you mean that "Osaka" is me?


Kaorin:
Ah...
Miss Sakaki!

Kaorin:
Miss Sakaki, good morning!
We got to be in the same class again.

Sakaki:
 Really.

Kaorin:
I'm so exhausted.
Ah, it's her!
Miss Kagura, the all-star sports girl!

Kagura:
 Yo.
 Guess we're in the same class now.
 You know, I've been wanting to have a proper chat with you for some time.
 I heard people saying we have a lot in common.
 Not that we need anyone to tell us, I'm sure you feel it too...

Sakaki:
 ...

Kagura:
 Huh? Um...
 Don't tell me...
 You... you don't remember me?

Sakaki:
 Mm.

Kagura:
 I... I see.
 Pht.
 Come on, we competed in the sports fest, the marathon, and the other games we played.
 You know the one with the ball.
 Don't you remember?

Sakaki:
 ...

Kagura:
 You don't remember?
 You really don't remember?

Sakaki:
Mm.

Kagura:
 Oh, anyway, we're rivals!
 I'll be seeing ya!

Sakaki:
 Okay.

Kaorin:
Miss Yukari's planning for the sports fest!


 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:4:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Yukari:
 Starting today, you are all second year students.
 And I'm your homeroom teacher, Yukari Tanizaki.
 I hope we have a good year.
 Now that I'm looking around, I see that there are quite a few of you here from my first year class.
 I wonder why?

Kagura:
 Why?

Osaka:
 This is my year.
 Get it together. Get it together. Get it together.

Yukari:
 How could that be?
 It's very strange, don't you think?
 But just to be clear, it's nothing to do with how remembering new names would be a big pain in the butt.
 It's nothing like that, and I also hope everyone keep that in mind.

Oh, and don't change your assigned seats, that goes for the class representatives as well.

 Right, now that that's done, class rep, say hello.

Tomo, Chiyo:
 Yes, ma'am!

Tomo:
 Huh?

Chiyo:
 Huh?

Yukari:
 Come on, come on, don't worry about it and just come up to the front.

Chiyo:
 Yes, ma'am.

Osaka:
 Get it together. Get it together. ...

Kagura:
 That Chiyo-chan really is cute.
 And she isn't well-known for nothing.
 Which is more than I can say for our school's well-known wildcat idiot.

Tomo:
 Hi, I'm our school's well-known...
 Who's an idiot?!
 Why you... you a bit of...
 You eternally-running-behind-Miss-Sakaki girl!

Kagura:
 Yeah, so what?!
 There's more brains in that behinds than you have in your head.

Tomo:
 How's that? I thought you stuffed them all in your boobs!

Yomi:
 Huh... wildcat idiot is right.

Kagura:
 At least I have boobs!

Tomo:
 You all are boobs!
Oh, check it out!
 Come on!

Yukari:
 Okay, okay, everyone, let's be nice to each other.
 You're all a vital part of our forces.
 Okay, now, settle down!

Osaka:
 Get it together. Get it together.
 Get it together. Get it together.

Kagura:
 Hey, Sakaki!
 I don't have swimming practice today, so how about you and me walk home together!

Kagura:
 Say, Sakaki, I've been wanting to ask you something.
 Do you usually play sports and stuff?

Sakaki:
 Not really.

Kagura:
 Huh.
 And you were still that awesome at the sports fest, marathon, and the other games we competed together?
 That's amazing.

 Are you thinking about joining a club or anything?
 I bet the sports things wanna have a few words with you.

Girl1:
Hey, Miss Sakaki!

Girl2:
For you, please!

Girl3:
Join our club, this year!

Sakaki:
 Sports clubs aren't my kinda thing.

Kagura:
 Wow, classic Sakaki.

Sakaki:
 Classic?

Boy1:
Hey there, Miss Sakaki!

Boy2:
Please, on you!

Boy3:
Join our club, this year!

Kagura:
 So, Sakaki, how would you feel about maybe joining the swim team?

 Well, I guess it is true what they say then.
 That you're a silent lone wolf, who doesn't like to hang around big crowds.

Sakaki:
 Wolf?

Everyone:
Wow...
Miss Sakaki, please say you'll join our club!


Kagura:
 Oh, man, Sakaki, you're playing this way too cool.

Sakaki:
 Wolf...

Kagura:
 Damn, what am I gonna tell to the swim team's seniors tomorrow?
 Hm?
 Oh, it's a cat.

 Stupid furball!
 Ahahaha...
 That was great!

Sakaki:
Uh...

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:6:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Chiyo:
 No one understands!

Sakaki:
 So, some first years said you were cute?

Chiyo:
 Yes!
 Miss Osaka and I were walking in the hallway, we were surrounded by first year students.

Girl1:
You must be the famous Chiyo-chan!

Girl2:
You're so small!

Girl3:
And cute!

Chiyo, Osaka:
 Uh...

Chiyo:
 It was so rude!
 I'm a second year student!
 And when I told Miss Yomi about it.

Yomi:
 Hahaha, of course the first years are gonna be surprised when they see you.

Kagura:
 It's okay, Chiyo-chan, all you have to be is cute.

Osaka:
 Hehehe...

Tomo:
 If you hate it that much, you wanna pin a sign to your chest that says "I'm a second year"?
 There!

Chiyo:
 None of them know what it's like!
 I don't want first year students telling me that I'm cute or that I'm small or that I'm a kid.

Sakaki:
 I see.

Chiyo:
 Miss Sakaki, you understand how I feel, don't you?

Sakaki:
 Hm...

Girls:
That girl with long hair!
She's just so cool!

Girl1:
She's a second year!

Girl2:
And she's in Class 3!

Girl3:
She's tall!
She totally broke 170!

Girls:
Miss Sakaki is the coolest!

Sakaki:
 Huh...

Chiyo:
 Miss Sakaki, you know how I feel, right?

Sakaki:
 Sorry, but I'm afraid not.

Chiyo:
 No one understands me after all!

Boy:
Huh? What's a kid doing here?
Um...

Chiyo:
 You are new to this school, aren't you?

Boy:
Um, well, yeah...

Chiyo:
 I am Chiyo Mihama, a second year student.

Boy:
What?

Chiyo:
 Senior Mihama to you!

Boy:
Um, okay, Senior Mihama...

Chiyo:
 That's right.

Boy:
Uh... S-Senior, huh?


Yomi:
 Man, I'm hungry.

Tomo:
 Hey.

Yomi:
 Yeah?

Tomo:
 It never really clicked with me before, but we were first year students until just the other day, right?

Yomi:
 Never mind that, just copy the homework.

Tomo:
 Oh, we're finally second years.
 I feel like I gotta do something second year-ish, you know.

Yomi:
 Yeah, yeah, actually done copying.

Tomo:
 Ah...

Yomi:
 Whoa! Eating early?!
 It seems so cheap and petty, but that curry...

Tomo:
 When you earned your places as second year high school students, eating lunch early is one of those things that goes way beyond general common knowledge.
 It's like the basic of the basics, see?

Tomo:
 Thanks for the food!

Chiyo:
 Tomo, class is going to start in a minute.

Tomo:
 Hah, you can't eat lunch early if you're afraid of class!
 Well, of course, perhaps it simply isn't a feat that a mere child could aspire to.
 Come on, come on.
 Hey, hey, hey, how do you like that?
 It's a full hour before lunch period!
 Who among you can resist temptation in this world of early lunches galore?


Kimura:
Huh?
Oh, pardon me, I didn't realize it was lunch.

Kimura:
Huh? Huh?
Eleven o'clock?
Ding-dong!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:8:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Yukari:
 Damn! Almost everybody's gone home!

Chiyo:
 Oh, Miss Yukari.

Yukari:
 Whatever.
 You guys, come here for a second!

Tomo:
 Huh?

Yukari:
 You know, I just had to pick this stupid thing up.

Tomo:
 Is it gonna explode when we open it?

Yomi:
 I don't know if we should open it.
 I mean things you pick up off the street can be dangerous.

Yukari:
 Well, dangerous would've been better.
 Look.

Chiyo:
 Haa!

Everyone:
It's a kitten!

Chiyo:
 He's so tiny!

Osaka:
 He's sleepin'.

Yomi:
 Look at the pink nose.

Osaka:
 What a tiny bundle.

Tomo:
 He's got nasty crud on his eyes!

Yokari:
 Okay, one of you have to take this cat home.

Sakaki:
 I can see him.

Tomo:
 What? He's not gonna stay with you?

Yukari:
 No way, I'm too busy, come on!
 Look, a tiny kitten like this can't survive all on his own.
 Don't you feel sorry for him?

Tomo:
 You found him, so you should keep him!

Yukari:
 I told you, I'm busy!

Kagura:
 What's going on?

Yukari:
 Listen, kittens are...
 Someone just take him!

Yomi:
 That's easy for you to say, but...

Osaka:
 I can't do it.

Yomi:
 And neither can I.

Tomo:
 Yeah, my family's got a dog.

Kagura:
What are we...

Chiyo:
 I have Mr. Tadakichi...

Kagura:
 Oh, so it's a cat?

Yomi:
 Sakaki?

Sakaki:
 No, I can't, either.

Yomi:
 Oh, man...

Sakaki:
 He's curled up into a little ball like a marble, marble, marble calico...
 I know, I'll name him Marco for short.

Kagura:
 Hey, Sakaki.

Sakaki:
 When you think of Marco, there's that story...

Kagura:
 Sakaki?

Sakaki:
 Could he be traveling 3000 leagues in search of his mother?

Kagura:
 Huh?

Sakaki:
 Is he going to journey that 12,000km all by himself?

Kagura:
 Hello?

Sakaki:
 He... he's probably been through a lot of sad and tough times that simply can't be expressed in one or two words.

Kagura:
 O...key...

Sakaki:
 Be strong, Marco.

Kagura:
 Ma... Marco?

Tomo:
 Tama!

Everyone:
Tama, Tama!

Tomo:
 It's time to chime!

Chiyo:
 Oh, what if our class took care of Tama.

Yukari:
 As if.

Osaka:
 Oh, I see what you were saying.
 So, it's someone's duty to take care of him, right?

Sakaki:
 Me.

Kagura:
 Huh?

Osaka:
 That's Chiyo-chan for ya. You're so smart.

Chiyo:
 Well, I'll be the pet keeper if there's no one else.

Sakaki:
 Me.

Yukari:
 No, no! This isn't like keeping goldfish!

Tomo:
 All right! It's up to me to help you out!

Yomi:
 Oh, yeah?

Tomo:
 Yeah, actually I live right next to a pounds.

Yomi:
 That doesn't help.

Osaka:
 Wow, he's super cute!

Chiyo:
 I wanna hold him!

 He's just too cute!

Osaka:
 Oh, me too.
 He's a nice kitty.

Sakaki:
 Me... me...

Tomo:
 I get him next, okay?

Sakaki:
 Careful...

Yomi:
 Jeez, Tomo, watching you hold him makes me nervous.
 Here, you should hold him gently like this.

Tomo:
 Hey, Yomi, no fair.

Yomi:
 Do you wanna hold him, Sakaki?

Sakaki:
 Mm.

Tomo:
 Hey, it's running away!

Yukari:
 Don't worry, I just know he'll make it on his own.

Yomi:
 That's not what you said two minutes ago!


-- Preview --

Tomo:
Hey, Kagura!
I don't care if Miss Sakaki's rival!
Quit challenging her over and over like a stupid on-trick pony!

Kagura:
Who are you calling stupid!

Tomo:
Well, if you're so smart, then try saying "I'm a big stupid idiot," in another language.

Kagura:
What?
Um... Ich bin ein... super... dumb head.

Tomo:
Dumb head is right.

Kagura:
What did you say?!
