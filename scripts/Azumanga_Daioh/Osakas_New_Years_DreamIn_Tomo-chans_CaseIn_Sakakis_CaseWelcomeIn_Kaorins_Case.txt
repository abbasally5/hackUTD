 Miss Sakaki, good morning, Miss Sakaki!

Sakaki:
 Huh?

Chiyo:
 Over here, over here!
 Miss Sakaki, good morning to you!

Sakaki:
 Uh, good morning.

Chiyo:
 I have a cute little cat that I I'd like to give you, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
 But my mother has terrible allergies, so I really couldn't.

Chiyo:
 Oh, please!
 This cat was abandoned by his owner, so he is in a terrible situation right now.

Sakaki:
 Huh?

Chiyo's Dad:
Hello there.

Sakaki:
 Oh.


Chiyo's Dad:
Tell me; do you like cats?

Sakaki:
 Yes.

Chiyo's Dad:
Did you say that knowing that I am a cat?

Sakaki:
 Ah, Yes.


Chiyo's Dad:
Well then, this is goodbye.

Sakaki:
 What?! But why?!

Chiyo's Dad:
The truth is, in spite of my appearance, I am not a cat.
I am Chiyo's father.
Thank you for always being so good to my daughter.

Sakaki:
 Oh, no.
 It was my pleasure.

Chiyo's Dad:
You must go in search of a real cat.
But it will be impossible for you, the way you are now.

Sakaki:
 But wait, what should I do?


Chiyo's Dad:
You cannot ask me.
Goodbye.

Sakaki:
 Please wait!

 Please follow me.
 I'm home!

Sakaki:
 Ah!
 Um...hey, Chiyo-chan, there's a...

Chiyo:
 Oh, I forgot you haven't met our maid.

Sakaki:
 Your maid is a penguin?

Chiyo:
 Uh-huh, she does the cleaning and stuff for us.

 But sometimes she has a brain freeze while she's working.
 Come on, let's get going.

Sakaki:
 O...Okay.


Sakaki:
 Ah!

Chiyo's Dad:
Hello.

Sakaki:
 Okay, now what?

Chiyo's Dad:
A friend of yours?

Chiyo:
 Yes! Her name's Miss Sakaki!

Chiyo's Dad:
Welcome then, I am Chiyo's father.
Thank you for always being so good to her.

Sakaki:
 Oh, not at all.

Chiyo's Dad:
I know, how about joining us for dinner?

Sakaki:
 No, I couldn't.

Chiyo:
 Oh, you don't have to be so polite.

Chiyo's Dad:
There will be some red things included, but please don't stand on ceremony.

Sakaki:
 Red things?

Chiyo:
 Oh!

Chiyo's Dad:
Tell me; what is popular at school these days?

Chiyo:
 Let me think. Jane Romeo, I guess.

Chiyo's Dad:
How is Jane?
Is she still single?

Chiyo:
 Yeah, her boyfriend dumped the other day.

Chiyo's Dad:
Chiyo, eat your tomatoes.

Chiyo:
 Yes, I just love tomatoes!

Chiyo's Dad:
You love or hate isn't the issue.
Eat your tomatoes, Chiyo.

Chiyo:
 Mm-hm.

Chiyo's Dad:
How is it? Is it good? Is the tomato good?

Chiyo:
 Mmm, it's delicious.

Chiyo's Dad:
They are so red and yet, Chiyo says that they are delicious.

Sakaki:
 Oh.

Sakaki:
 Excuse me, that thing we were talking about.
 Where can I go to find a real cat?

Chiyo's Dad:
A real cat?

Sakaki:
Huh?

Chiyo's Dad:
Are you saying that that I am a fake cat?

Sakaki:
 I'm sorry, please forgive me.

Chiyo's Dad:
No, it is not that I am angry. I am not a fake, no.
But do you mean to say that there are cats that are real and ones that are not?!

Sakaki:
 Are you sure you are not angry?

Chiyo:
 Father, guess what.
 It's a visitor!

Chiyo's Dad:
Invite her in, if you would, please.

Chiyo:
 Okay.

But it's more than enough that you've already rescued me...

Sakaki:
 I do anything for you, Kaorin.


Kaorin:
Um... Listen, Miss Sakaki, instead of using the name all my friend use, do you think maybe you can just call me "Kaori"?

Sakaki:
 Sure, I understand.

Kaorin:
Uh...

Kaorin,s Mom:
Kaori.
Kaori.
Kaori!

 Oh, it's too bad, but I didn't get to have a New Year's dream this year.
 I wished I had though.

 Hey, in speaking of dreams, you showed up in mine, Chiyo-chan.

Osaka:
 I had the same thing happen.
