 Chiyo:
 The culture fest will be coming up soon.
 So, what should we do for this year's culture fest?

Student1:
A cafe!

Student2:
A haunted house!

Chiyo:
 Those things again? Um...
 Well... Um...

Yukari:
 Okay, I'm fine with whatever.
 You know, that whole respecting the students' independence thingy.

Student:
School's out!

Yomi:
 Back to the comment box, huh?

Chiyo:
 The only ideas so far are for the cafe and the haunted house, so...

Yomi:
 No 5-yen coins this time.

Tomo:
 Oh, I know!
 How about we combine the two and do a haunted house cafe?!
 When people are having tea and stuff, we'll go "Boo!" and scare them.
 A cafe where you can't have tea in peace.
 This could be it!
 A breakthrough idea?!

Yomi:
 It sounds like lunch time in grade school.

Osaka:
 Well, it just might be a good idea.

Tomo:
 Wahoo!

Osaka:
 Maybe.

Yomi:
 Really, now?

Osaka:
 Huh... surprise!
 Here ya are, drinkin' coffee, when you discover a cockroach inside.
 Whoa! Hey, lady, what's goin' on here?!

Yomi:
 That's not really what a haunted house is about.

Chiyo:
 What if the waitresses are all dressed up as different kinds of monsters?

Tomo:
 Yeah, that would fit the theme, but you are never gonna scare anyone.

Chiyo:
 Is it no good if people don't get scared?

Tomo:
 Not really.

Osaka:
 Chiyo-chan, you'll be a plaster wall.

Chiyo:
 A plaster wall? Why, Miss Osaka?

Osaka:
 Do it.

Yomi, Tomo:
 It might be cute.

Chiyo:
 Here, one milk tea coming right up.

Osaka:
 Uh...

Tomo:
 What other monsters are there?

Yomi:
 Let's see...
 That umbrella one?

Osaka:
 No good!
 I see a major structural flaw with the haunted house cafe!

Tomo:
 What?!

Osaka:
 Oh, I got it! I sure belt a home run!

Tomo:
 Huh?

Osaka:
 Instead of a cafe that's like a haunted house, how 'bout we do a haunted house that's like a cafe?

Tomo:
 See... Um... that would be...

Chiyo:
 A home run?

Yomi:
 Well, this is the culture festival, so I'd like to do something that'll set us apart from other classes.

Tomo:
 Yes, that's it!
 Let's do something the other classes could never hope to imitate.
 Something we have that nobody else does...

Osaka:
 Huh...

Yomi:
 Something this class has that nobody else does, huh?
 You mean something like Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
 Huh?

Tomo:
 Hm... Oh! Ooh! Hah!

Yomi:
 So did you think of something?

Tomo:
 The Chiyo-chan Show!
 All of us will become Chiyo-chan!

Yomi:
 Become Chiyo-chan?!

Tomo:
 Exactly!
 We could put up our hair like this...
 Hi, my name is Chiyo. I'm a little genius.
 I always make hundreds.
 And I'm really rich too.

Yomi:
 Oh, she's getting pissed off now.

Tomo:
 Oh, yeah?
 My name is Chiyo.

Chiyo:
 No, I am not like that, no way!

Tomo:
 Not like that, no way?

Kagura:
 A culture fest project?

Osaka:
 You know I've always wanted a chance at doing a cafe.

Kagura:
 But aren't there usually a whole lot of classes that wanna do the cafe thing?

Osaka:
 Yeah, that's right.
 From what I hear, there's a whole lot of haunted houses and cafes.
 And that's why we gotta come up with a really good plan.

Kagura:
 Uh-huh.
 Oh! How about we put the two together and make a haunted cafe, huh?!
 That would be a killer idea!

Osaka:
 Ooh, the same wavelength.

Tomo:
 Uh...

Kagura:
 Same as what?


 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:2:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Kagura:
 Hey, hey, didn't your class had that fanciful cute thing going on last year?

Chiyo:
 Yes, it was very well received.

Kagura:
 Yeah, that was pretty good, so why don't we combine that with something?

Chiyo:
 Oh, I see what you mean.

Osaka:
 I get it.
 We'll have a cute haunted house.

Kagura:
 No, not like that.

Yomi:
 A stuffed animal cafe?

Chiyo:
 We could improve on what we learned from last year and come up with something good.

Osaka:
 Come-from-behind home-run!

Yomi:
 Not again!

Osaka:
 We can just lump all of it together and set up a cafe with like scary monsters of cute animals.

Yomi:
 Okay, I don't even know what you're saying anymore.

Chiyo:
 And it's not a come-from-behind home-run, you know.

Osaka:
 In other words, let me explain it.

Yomi:
 I didn't ask.

Osaka:
 Well, you see there'll be lots of cats and dogs inside the cafe...
 And they'll all be dead.

Everyone:
Uh...

Osaka:
 It'll be good to keep it all together.
 Or we still might use this right away, so maybe puttin' it over here will be better.
 Although at the same time, if there's just one in a separate spot, it might be forgotten.
 Oh, but the simple convenience of havin' it over here might actually end up being more advantageous in the long run.

Yomi:
 Hey, what's the deal with all the useless activity going on over here?

Osaka:
 Huh?

Student:
What should I do here?!

Chiyo:
 Please put that chair all the way to the far side!
 That desk needs to be in front of the wall!
 Oh, please hold on that!
 Go borrow a panel from somebody first, okay!
 No, not there!
 Please put it in the hallway!
 You need to cut the paper for the menu to a uniform size!
 Please transport the foodstuffs according to the type of food!
 Oh! We're not gonna make it!
 Somebody, turn back the clock before it's too late!

Osaka:
 Oh, I can't quite reach it.

Chiyo:
 Miss Osaka, please do some work!

Tomo:
 What are you doing?

Sakaki:
 Designing.

Tomo:
 Here, let me borrow it for a second.

Sakaki:
 Uh...

Chiyo:
 Is this the box?
 No, it's not.

Kaorin:
Huh?

Chihiro:
What's the matter, Kaorin?

Chiyo:
 Oh, we might not make it in time!

Kaorin:
Um, Miss Sakaki, is there anything that I can help you with?

Sakaki:
 Hm?

Kaorin:
Oh, you're drawing a design?
So, what is it then, huh?

Sakaki:
 A hat.

Tomo:
 Hey, Miss Sakaki! Come here for a sec!

Sakaki:
 Excuse me.

Kaorin:
Go right ahead.
Oh, well...

Chihiro:
What are you doing, Kaorin?

Kaorin:
I was just talking to Miss Sakaki!

Chihiro:
What's this?

Kaorin:
It's a hat.

Chiyo:
 Ah, we're gonna run out of time!

Tomo:
 I cannot let you take the Earth, you villain!
 Hiss!
 Hiss, hiss, hiss, hiss! Whoosh!
 Whoa! You have the power to fly?!
 Then I shall fly too!
 All right, let the battle begin! Dadadadadada.
 Yowl!
 Rarrr!
 Whoosh!
 What? Running away?!
 Chomp! Chomp!
 Ah-ah! It seems you're unable to bite me!
 Oh, really?

 What's that you want?
 You want me to stop?

Sakaki:
 Background.

Tomo:
 So, what's this?
 Oh, something you drew huh?
 It's kinda too peaceful for the background on the ultimate battle to save the Earth.
 But I guess it's gonna help set the mood a little better.

 Meow! Meow! Hiss!
 I won't let you have your way!
 Give it up! I have won!
 I will never give in!
 Ha-ha-ha-ha...
 Ha-ha-ha-ha...

Chiyo:
 Please you guys, get to work!
 The culture fest is happening tomorrow!

Tomo:
 Yeah, yeah, okay.

Chiyo:
 Oh, we're never gonna make it at this rate!

Student:
Chiyo-chan!

Chiyo:
 Yes!

Student:
Class Rep!

Chiyo:
 Yes!

Student:
What about this?!

Student:
Take a look at this!

Tomo:
 Huh? Did that Kagura run out on us?

Yomi:
 She's helping with the swim team's preparations!

Tomo:
 Ah, I don't know what I should do now!

Chiyo:
 Tomo, please take care of this!


 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:4:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Chiyo:
 Just in time!

Yukari:
 Yo, is everyone over here ready?
 They just opened the doors.
 Are you ready yet?

Osaka:
 I am, but just barely.

Yukari:
 Wow! What's that? It's cute!

Osaka:
 This is a father hat.
 And it's our uniform.

Yukari:
 Father hat?

Osaka:
 Miss Sakaki started callin' it that for some reason.

Yukari:
 Why is that?

Osaka:
 Only Miss Sakaki would know.

Yukari:
 Oh...

Yukari:
 Ah!

Tomo:
 Practice bringing out coffee quickly!

Yukari:
 What do you have on your head?

Sakaki:
 Neco Coneco.

Kagura:
 Practice bringing out iced coffee...

Sakaki:
 Neco Coneco.

Yukari:
 Well, I know what that is, but...

Osaka:
 The explanation for that is that we couldn't make enough hats for everyone in time, so we decided to do this for people who don't have one.

Yukari:
 I... I see...
 Well, that's fine, but...

Yukari:
 Hiya... anyone seen Chiyo-chan?

Yomi:
 Oh, Chiyo-chan just left to go changing into a special costume.

Yukari:
 Special?

Kaorin:
Yes, for I, Kaorin,

Chihiro:
And I, Chihiro...

Kaorin, Chihiro:
Combined our abilities together and specially made the "Special Costume"!

Yukari:
 Special?

Chiyo:
 I'm back.

Yukari:
 Huh?

Chiyo:
 Oh, grab on this.
 I got it open!

Yukari:
 Whoa!

Chiyo:
 How is it, Miss Yukari?

Yukari:
 Oh...

Chiyo:
 Miss Yukari!
 Miss Yukari.

Yukari:
 Wow, it's so cute! I can just...

Chiyo:
 What did you do that for?!

Yukari:
 Oh, I just sorta felt like it.

Tomo:
 Huh?

Chiyo:
 What was that all about?!

Tomo:
 Whoa! Chiyo-chan, you're so cute!
 I won't be fooled.
 Do you hear me?
 You can try to fool me all you want with that evil cuteness!

Chiyo:
 Really, Tomo, you always say such mean things, pht!
 I shouldn't listen to her.

Tomo:
 Oh, so cute.

Yomi:
 Okay, let's let the customers in!

Everyone:
Yeah!

Chiyo:
 All right, let's get to it!
 But I'm still a little nervous.
 Will the customers enjoy our stuffed animal cafe?

 That kind of attitude just won't do!
 Do not give into the pressure and let's enjoy the once-a-year culture fest to the fullest possible extent!
 Some exercise might be a good idea.
 One, two, three, four.
 One, two, three, four.
 One, two, three, four, ah...
 I fell over!
 It's really hard for me to get up!

Everyone:
It's so cute.

Osaka:
 In the end, I think this tree is gonna look better over...

Tomo:
 Hey, Osaka!

Osaka:
 Hm?

Tomo:
 Did you see it?!
 Did you see that?!

Osaka:
 Hm? See what?

Tomo:
 Chiyo-chan and her penguin exercises!

Osaka:
 I didn't see nothin'.

Tomo:
 You idiot!

Osaka:
 Huh? Why?


 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:6:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Student:
Balloon fishing!
You gotta do balloon fishing at a festival!
Check it out! Year 2, Class 4!

Osaka:
 Oh, Miss Kurosawa.
 How 'bout a nice cup of tea?

Nyamo:
 Ooh, you're doing a cafe, aren't you?

Osaka:
 It's very cute.
 So cute, you'll be like, how could this be?

Nyamo:
 Oh, really, now?
 I have to be careful, since it's something you guys put together.

Osaka:
 You don't have to worry.
 There ain't any dead cats or anythin'.

Nyamo:
 Huh?

Osaka:
 This table over here is free.

Nyamo:
 Okay, I'll sit here, then.

Osaka:
 It's a window seat.

Nyamo:
 I think I'll have a coffee.

Osaka:
 Right!
 One coffee!

Yomi:
 Okay!

Nyamo:
 Hmm, that's some attention to detail.

Yomi:
 Deliver this for me, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
 Okay!

Yomi:
 Here you are. I appreciate it.

Chiyo:
 Sure!

Nyamo:
 Huh? Ah!

Chiyo:
 Here's your coffee. There.

Nyamo:
 She's so adorable...

Chiyo:
 Here's your cream.

Nyamo:
 Okay.

Chiyo:
 Enjoy.

Nyamo:
 Uh, are you okay, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
 I'm... okay...

Nyamo:
 Brilliant.

Yukari:
 How about it?

Nyamo:
 Huh?

Yukari:
 Incredible, isn't it?
 Well, I guess there's no match else who could compete with that kind of sheer cuteness, huh!

Nyamo:
 I agree with you, but what reason do you have to be all proud of it?

Yukari:
 Huh? You don't know?
 I happen to be Chiyo-chan's homeroom teacher.
 I bet you would've liked to have a kid like that in your class, wouldn't ya?
 I know you would have!

Nyamo:
 But, somehow I still feel sorry for all those kids.

Student:
Oh, welcome.

Student:
Welcome.

Kimura:
Ah!

Student:
What can I get you, sir?

Kimura:
Uh... Uh... Uh...

Kimura:
Excuse me, Miss Waitress, I'd like to order now, please.

Kagura:
 What?
 So what can I get you?

Kimura:
I want that?

Kagura:
 What?

Kimura:
Would you lend me one of those hats?

Kagura:
 Um, here you go.

Kimura:
I'm ready.

Stuffed Animal Cafe!
It's really cute!
Stuffed Animal Cafe!
Why don't you come on over!
Is really cute!
I'm telling you!

Kagura:
 We don't need any help attracting customers!

Kimura:
Huh?

Kagura:
 You got it?

Kagura:
 I'm Kagura!
 The fact that I'm 156cm tall has nothing to do with the culture fest!

Sakaki:
 Oh. Sakaki. Um...

Kimura:
Is really really cute, come on!


 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:8:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Student:
Man, that was cute, really cute.

Yomi:
 Thank you so much for stopping by.

Tomo:
 Hold it, Kaorin, those aren't regulation kitty ears.

Kaorin:
 Oh, I was wearing the other kind before but...

Kagura:
 Oh! Wait a minute!
 You mean the one I let Kimura borrow?!
 It hasn't come back yet?

Tomo:
 Okay!
 It's time to go and retrieve Kaorin's father hat!

Yomi:
 Oh, no, you've been wandering around school all this time.
 So you don't need to go anywhere.

Tomo:
 Huh...

Yomi:
 Oh, hey, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
 Yes, what?

Yomi:
 Well, the crowd's died down a bit, so why don't we start taking breaks in shifts, okay?

Chiyo:
 That's a good idea.

Tomo:
 In that case, I should go first...
 Ouch!

Yomi:
 No, Chiyo-chan and Osaka will take a first break.

Chiyo:
 Sure it's okay?

Osaka:
 Hurrah! Chiyo-chan, are you ready?
 Let's go and pig out on lots of snacks.

Chihiro:
Wait a minute, Chiyo-chan!
If you're going to walk around the school anyway, we can advertise while you're at it!

Chiyo:
 Oh, that's a good idea!

Chiyo:
 See you later!

Osaka:
 We'll go enjoy the culture fest!

Tomo:
 I get to go next.

Yomi:
 You're on hold, Tomo.

Chiyo:
 Look, Miss Osaka, they have fried octopus ball!

Osaka:
 You're right!
 Chiyo-chan, fried octopus ball is somethin' ya always gotta get when ya go visit a culture fest.
 Let's go get some.

Chiyo:
 Yes!

Student:
Thanks for waiting!

Chiyo:
 It looks really delicious.
 My arms don't reach, so I can't eat it.

Osaka:
 Now we can't be having any of that.
 Okay, open up your mouth and say "Ah", Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
 Uh... Ah!

Osaka:
 Here you go!

Osaka:
 Sounds like it's good.
 I'm glad for ya, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
 It's very delicious!

Osaka:
 Chiyo-chan, do you like octopus balls?

Chiyo:
 Oh yes, I love them!

 Miss Osaka!
 These people have taiyaki pastries.
 What will we do?

Osaka:
 'Course, ya always gotta have taiyaki pastries at a culture fest, don't ya?

Osaka, Chiyo:
 We would like a taiyaki pastry each!

 Yay, let's get started!

Chiyo:
 Ah!

Osaka:
 Oh, oh yeah.
 You know how some people eat taiyaki pastries startin' from the head and some people start from the tail?
 So which end do you like to start eatin' from?
 Oh...
 Okay, Chiyo-chan, say "Ah" for me.

Chiyo:
Ah!

Osaka:
 One more thing, Chiyo-chan.
 You wanna start with the head or with the tail?

Chiyo:
 Head first, please, Miss Osaka.

Osaka:
 I got ya. Dig in.

Chiyo:
 It's delicious!

Osaka:
 Chiyo-chan, do ya like taiyaki pastries?

Chiyo:
 High school is so nice because we get to do the culture fest.

Osaka:
 I hear ya.
 Like me? It's like I can be happy the rest of the year simply because there's the culture fest.

Chiyo:
 That's incredible.

 Hey everyone, we came back!

Osaka:
 We had a really good time!

Yomi:
 Just what kind of advertising did you do?!

Kagura:
 It's been way too effective!

Tomo:
 There's no time for breaks!

Chiyo:
 Oh, gosh...

Student1:
Man, we sure sold a lot!

Student2:
I'm so tired!

Student3:
It was a huge hit!

Tomo:
 Chiyo-chan!

Chiyo:
 Yeah.

Tomo:
 We're doing a toast with the leftover juice!

Chiyo:
 Okay!

Sakaki:
 Hm...
 Oh.
 Mm-hm.


-- Preview --

Osaka:
Christmas is comin' up.
It's almost the season for Santa to come.

Tomo:
Does Santa even really exist?
Besides, what does Santa do for you anyway?
Isn't it kind of suspicious for a stranger to be giving you presents?!

Osaka:
It sure is a mystery.
He's in cahoots with reindeer and he's got a big bag too.

Tomo:
What in the world does he have inside the bag?!

Osaka, Tomo:
Ooh!

Yomi:
Presents, okay?!
