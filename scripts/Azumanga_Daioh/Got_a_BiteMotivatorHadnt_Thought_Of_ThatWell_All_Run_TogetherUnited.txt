 Kagura, Tomo:
 Let's eat!

Kagura:
 Many thanks for the food!

Tomo:
 Many thanks for the...

Kagura:
 I won!

Tomo:
 I lost.

Tomo:
 What gives, Osaka?
 Are you really still eating?

Kagura:
 Man, You're slow.

Yomi:
 No, it's you guys that are too fast.

Osaka:
 Mm-hm.

Chiyo:
 Oh, hey, everyone!

Everyone:
Huh?

Chiyo:
 Look I have the printouts for the sports fest here.
 And it looks like they completely change the events for this year.

Osaka:
 Ah!

Chiyo:
 Ah!

Tomo:
 O... Osa...

Osaka:
 Brea..!
 Bread... eatin'... con!
 Bread eatin' con! Bread eatin' con! Bread eatin' con!
 Bread eatin' con! Bread eatin' con!

Yomi:
 Oh.

Tomo:
 Bean paste...

Osaka:
 Is there a bread eatin' contest?!

Chiyo:
 Oh... Bread eating contest?
 Oh! There is! There really is a bread eating contest!
 You see.

Osaka:
 There's a bread eatin' contest!
 I better start practicin' for it right away.
 And I gotta a sweet bean bun right here!

 Oh, shoot, there's no string.

Yomi:
 Really, now...

Osaka:
 Ahhhh.

 Huh...

Chiyo:
 Hm...

Osaka:
 Ah...

Chiyo:
 Hm...

Kagura:
 What're you guys doing?

Chiyo:
 Oh, Miss Kagura.

Osaka:
 After my first failure, I came prepared this time.
 A sweet bean bun and a big ball of string.

Kagura:
 Right.

Osaka:
 But you know...
 Uh...
 How are you supposed to hang up the bread?

Chiyo:
 Do you just tie it around the bun?

Kagura:
 No. Isn't it more like... more like bait?
 You know, with a fish hook?

Osaka:
 Ah!

 I had no idea it was so dangerous!

Kagura:
 Nah, I guess not.

Chiyo:
 Oh!

Tomo:
 Oh, Yukari!
 If we win this year, you treat us to juice!

Yukari:
 Do you honestly love juice that much, Tomo?

Tomo:
 Uh...
 If you're asking if I want it that badly, then no, not really, but...
 Who cares?!
 You're making a bet!
 You're gonna turn a profit, right?!

Yukari:
 Even when I profit, it's not like it's for real.

Tomo:
 Huh? What are you saying then?

Yukari:
 To put it simply...

Osaka:
 Huh?

Yukari:
 Osaka, come here for a sec.
 Osaka will be Mr. Yukichi.

Osaka:
 Mr. Yukichi?

Yukari:
 Mr. Yukichi.

Osaka:
 Mr. Yukichi.

Yukari:
 If we win the sports fest, I get Osaka!

Tomo:
 Huh?

Yomi:
 I don't really get it, but whatever.

Yukari:
 Victory! I got Osaka!

Osaka:
 I've been got.

Yukari:
 But soon after, Osaka would leave to be with Nyamo.
 Bye-bye.

Osaka:
 Bye-bye.

Yukari:
 See?!
 Now, isn't that the lonely?

Tomo:
 So... so, in other words,

Yukari:
 Oh...

 Kagura:
 All right!
 The sports fest is tomorrow!

Tomo:
 Wow! You're fired up!

Kagura:
 Oh, yeah! Sports are my specialty!
 Just leave it to me!

Tomo:
 I've got high hopes for you!

Kagura:
 All this talk is getting me fired up!
 I'm gonna do it this year!

Yomi:
 Getting fired up is fine, but give us a hand, would ya?
 We won't make it in time if we don't all help out.

Tomo:
 Ooh, a tent?

Kagura:
 A tent! A tent!

Tomo:
 Okay, what should I do?!

Kagura:
 And me, what about me?

Chiyo:
 Tomo, please support that pole and Miss Kagura, please take hold of this side.

Tomo:
 Right! let's go!

Kagura:
 It's on now!

Yomi:
 Okay, let's raise it up!

Chiyo:
 Yeah.

Tomo:
 Boom! Boom! Boom!

Kagura:
 You wanna fight?!

Yomi:
 Hey, quit goofing off!

Kagura:
 Attack!

Chiyo:
 Ah!

Yomi:
 Uwa...

Chiyo:
 Just when we thought we finally got it set up...

Kagura:
 I'm sorry. We were fooling...

Tomo:
 Oh, Kagura, she wrecked the tent!
 Wrecked the tent, Wrecked the tent! Lalala...
 Everybody was working so hard at it and Kagura had to go and mess it all up!

Kagura:
Oh...
 Boo-hoo...

Tomo:
 Uh, what's wrong?
 Hey, Kagura...

Kagura:
 Chiyo-chan, I'm sorry.
 You were all working on it and I just...

Chiyo:
 Oh, oh no, it's okay.

Kagura:
 Why am I such a lousy no-good bumbling idiot?
 I'll take care of the rest of it by myself.

Tomo:
 Tha... That isn't how it goes!
 You're supposed to take a jab at me!
 You know, say something like "It was totally Tomo's fault!"
 Not go off getting all serious and stuff!

Chiyo:
 Miss Kagura.

Kagura:
 Huh?

Chiyo:
 Why don't we all set it up together?
 Preparing for the sports fest ought to be fun.

Kagura:
 Thanks, Chiyo-chan.

Yomi:
 Let's do this.

Chiyo:
 Ready when you are!

Tomo:
 Yeah, let's have some fun!

Kagura:
 All right!

Tomo:
 Yah... Boom!

Kagura:
 What's wrong with you?!

Tomo:
 All right!
 There you go!

Yomi:
 You go! You're in the way!

Kagura:
 Man, I'm hungry.
 I had to skip breakfast 'cause I woke up so late this morning.

Osaka:
 That's too bad.

Kagura:
 Ta-da!
 Pork cutlet, rice and a big noodle bowl.

Yomi:
 You'll gain weight.

Kagura:
 Oh, I'm not too worried about that.
 You see, I'm the type who never gains weight no matter how much I eat.
 In fact, if I don't eat, I don't have any energy, so it's bad.

Yomi:
 Oh yeah, is that so?!
 Then why don't you go eat a hundred bowls of pork cutlet?!

Kagura:
 What're you so mad about?

Osaka:
 You're amazin'.
 You know, I could never eat as much as you do.

Kagura:
 Really?
 So you think this is a lot?

Osaka:
 Half of that...
 Even a third of it would fill me up completely.

Yomi:
 Oh, how very happy for you!

Osaka:
 What'cha so mad for?

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:4:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Kagura:
 Right, guess we'll give it a go!

Chiyo:
 Yeah!

Tomo:
 The anticipation is making me shake!

Osaka:
 The bread eatin' contest!

Kaorin:
Please do your best!
I'm not in your class, but I'll cheer for you!

Sakaki:
 Um... Oh, thank you.

Yomi:
 Okay, what's with bloomers?
 Why do they still make us wear these?

Kimura:
Hurray!
Hurray!
Hurray!
Hurray!
Hurray!

I love those pants very very much.
<Latin?>Ego amo te<Latin>

Kagura:
 Hey?!

Kimura
Ah!

Man:
Ready?!

Announce:
Next up is the costume race.

Kagura:
 I think Tomo and Chiyo-chan are pairing up for the costume race, aren't they?
 So what is Tomo gonna be?

Osaka:
 The bread eatin' contest is comin' up.
 Get it together.

Yomi:
 A policewoman, I think?

Tomo:
 Ding, ding, ding!
 You're right!

Kagura:
 Wow, you could practically join the ICPO right now!
 So, where's Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
 Heya, lady.
 It's nice to meetcha.

Tomo:
 Here she is, the perp!

Kagura:
 Huh?

Man:
Ready?!

Tomo:
 Okay, let us through!
 Make way!
 Move it, move it!
 Come on, make way! I said, move it!
 You're in the way, damn it!
 Hey, I said, make way!

Kagura:
 Is pushing allowed?

Tomo:
 Move it, move it, move it, move it!
 Go, go, go,

Osaka:
 Say...
 I wonder what crime Chiyo-chan musta committed?

Tomo:
 Make way! Let us through already!
 Move it! Come on, I told you to make way!
 All right! Number one!

Osaka:
 Hey, they won.


Announce:
Next up is the bread eating contest.
Participants, please gather in front of the entrance gate.

Osaka:
 Now, my turn.

Chiyo:
 Miss Osaka, please do your best!

Man:
Take your places!

Announce:
For this bread eating contest, going in order by lane, we've hung up sweet bean paste bread, cream bread, jam bread, curry bread, and melon bread.
Please go for whichever one you like.

Osaka:
 Huh?
 What the heck?!

Man:
Ready?!

Osaka:
 Sweet bean paste, cream, curry, jam and melon, huh...?
 Lemme think...

 Shoot, I've only practiced with a sweet bean paste bread.
 But if we're talkin' sweet, the jam or cream bread would be good, too.
 Come to think of it, why's a cream bread have that lumpy shape?
 I don't see any reason it couldn't be round.
 Oh, I found one that doesn't belong.
 Curry breads are fried.
 Do they gotta fry it no matter what?
 No, that's not it. So, sweet bean paste breads are round, cream breads are lumpy, and jam breads have pieces in 'em...
 Oh, I don't know anymore.
 I came in last.
 I got the melon bread.
 Ah...

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:6:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Yomi:
 Right, right, left, left, front, down, jump!

Kaorin:
Oh, Yomi.

Yomi:
 What's up?

Kaorin:
Yomi, the cheerleader, huh?

Yomi:
 Something like that.

Kaorin:
Wow...
You just look so cute!

Yomi:
 R-Really?

Kaorin:
Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
 Right, right, left, left, front, down, jump!

Kaorin:
You're so cute!

Tomo:
 I found a spy!
 So what could this someone from another class be up to?

Kaorin:
Oh, a boy's uniform?!

Tomo:
 Yup! Me, Kagura, even Sakaki's wearing a boy's uniform!

Kaorin:
Ah!

Tomo:
 Sakaki's wearing a boy's uniform!
 Sakaki's wearing a boy's uniform!
 Sakaki's wearing a boy's uniform!

Tomo:
 Take that, and that, how's that?
 Pretty cool, don't you think?

Kaorin:
Show me!
Ah...
Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah!

Osaka:
 Last up is the relay!
 Class versus class with everyone!

Tomo:
 It's here, it's here, it's here!

Yomi:
 Hey, don't get so worked up that you trip.

Kagura:
 All right, now for the climax!

Sakaki:
 Mm.

Chiyo:
 I... I have to do my best. I just have to!
 But what if I end up dragging everybody down again?

Sakaki:
 Don't worry.

Chiyo:
 Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
 Don't worry.

Yomi:
 That's right.
 After all, we've got Sakaki and Kagura in our class.
 So it's okay.

Kagura:
 You see, so you can just relax, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
 Right!

Tomo:
 You've got me too!

Yomi:
 Yeah for us.

Tomo:
 What was that?!
 Just watch!
 We'll get first place!

Yomi:
 Where do you get that confidence of yours?

Osaka:
 Chiyo-chan, I'm gonna teach ya a great tactic!

Chiyo:
 A great tactic?

Osaka:
 Ka-ching!
 If you run with your hands out like this, it'll be hard for people to pass ya.

Chiyo:
 You... you think so?

Osaka:
 You're not passin' me!

Chiyo:
 You... you really think so?

Announce:
At last, it's time for the class versus class 4000-meter relay.

Tomo:
 Number one!
 Number one runner!
 Lots of expectations! Huge expectations!
 Vital! Vital!
 There's no way I'm not gonna lose this race to anyone!
 Yomi, I'll hand you the baton as the number one runner!
 Just you wait! Yeah! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

Yomi:
 She's gonna use up all her energy before it starts.

Man:
Ready?!

Yomi:
 What?

Kagura:
 What a start! Wow.

Tomo:
 Move it, move it, move it, move it, move it, move it!!

Chiyo:
 Amazing! Tomo's in the lead!

Kagura:
 All right, Tomo! Go!

Yomi:
 I better not start slacking either.

Tomo:
 Uh...

Yomi:
 I told you not to get too worked up before the start!
 Arh!

Chiyo:
 Are you okay?!

Tomo:
 Yomi, run! It's a diet!

Yomi:
 Shut up, moron!

Yukari:
 Go! Leave them in the dust!
 Come on! I'm telling you to pass them!
 Oh, what are they doing?!
 Come on, pass them there!
 And there! And there! And there!
 All right!

Girl:
Osaka!

Osaka:
 Gotcha!
 Ka-ching!

Chiyo:
 Look out! They're passing you, they're passing you!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:8:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Yomi:
 Oh, wow.

Tomo:
 She's fast.

Osaka:
 That's Kagura.

Yomi:
 All right!

Tomo:
 One more person!

Osaka:
 You'll be in the lead!

Yukari:
 Kagura! Hurry up and pass them, right now!

Kagura:
 Chiyo-chan!
 Damn!

Yomi:
 Go for it, Chiyo-chan!

Tomo:
 Don't you lose!

Osaka:
 Come on!

Chiyo:
 I have to do my best!
 I've run every night, practicing just for this day!
 I want to at least... at least get it to Miss Sakaki without being passed!

Girl:
I feel like I'm doing something bad.

Boy:
Ahaha, what're you doing, walking?!
Are you sure you wanna win?!
Huh, Class 3?!
There you go, hang in there!
Don't cry!

Chiyo:
 Mi... Miss Sakaki...
 I'm... I'm sorry!

Sakaki:
 Don't worry!

Kagura:
 You did great, Chiyo-chan!

Chiyo:
 But I got passed by so many people!

Yomi:
 Don't worry! Sakaki will win it back!
 But... but.. but the other classes have boys and track and field people...

Tomo:
 Hang on, Chiyo, take a look at that!

Chiyo:
 Miss Sakaki! Go! Go! Go! Go for it!
 You can keep it up!

 Amazing! She passed everyone out there!

Tomo:
 Good job, Sakaki! First place!

Yukari:
 Now, Sakaki, you just leave the rest to me!

Tomo:
 Shoot! Our anchor is our homeroom teacher!
 Go Yukari! Take it and run!

Nyamo:
 Not so fast!
 I'm coming for you!

Tomo:
 Whoa, Nyamo's got speed!

Chiyo:
 Go for it!
 Miss Yukari, go for it!
 Miss Yukari!

Everyone:
Oh...


Tomo:
 Oh, man!
 Yukari just had to go and ruin the whole thing.
 And we didn't get any juice.

Yomi:
 Honestly now, do you really like juice that much, Tomo?

Chiyo:
 I think it was still a whole lot of fun though.

Everyone:
Huh?

Chiyo:
 What?
 Is something the matter?

Kagura:
But we did come in last place.

Tomo:
 And we didn't get treated to juice either.

Yomi:
 Yeah, enough about the juice already.

Chiyo:
 But it really was a lot of fun!
 Wasn't it, Miss Sakaki?

Sakaki:
 What? Oh, yeah, right.

Chiyo:
 See, it really was a lot of fun!

Osaka:
 Chiyo-chan, you shouldn't be talkin' sour grapes.

Chiyo:
 This isn't sour grapes!

Kagura:
 Oh, no, it's sour grapes, all right.

Yomi:
 After all, Chiyo-chan really hates to lose.

Chiyo:
 That's not it!
 Please tell them, Miss Sakaki!

Sakaki:
 Oh, yeah.

Tomo:
 All right, we'll just say that we had fun and leave it at that!

Chiyo:
 I'm not lying!
 It really and truly was a lot of fun!


-- Preview --

Chiyo:
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow!
Miss Sakaki, you like cats, don't you?

Sakaki:
Yeah.

Chiyo:
But you can't keep cats at home, can you?

Sakaki:
If I live alone, maybe...

Osaka:
Hey, Sakaki, you're goin' to get a cat?
One like pikanyaa?

Chiyo:
That's yamapikaryaa.
We met one on Iriomote Island.

Sakaki:
Ma-Mayaa!

Osaka:
You can see the continuation next time.
