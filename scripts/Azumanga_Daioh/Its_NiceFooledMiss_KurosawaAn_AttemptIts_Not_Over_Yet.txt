 Osaka:
 Summer's here.

Kagura:
 Hm? Wha-What?

Osaka:
 You're tanned.
 When you're tanned through and through like that, it's hard to tell just how tanned you are.

Kagura:
 Oh, in that case, then here. See?

Osaka:
 That imprint in your swimsuit.
 You know, with that, you could go to the pool wearin' nothin' and no one would even notice that something was missing.

Kagura:
 Uh...

Yomi:
 Kagura, don't listen to her!


Yukari:
 It's hot! It's summer!

Tomo:
 Summer means...

Yukari:
 Starting tomorrow is happy summer break.

Everyone:
Yay! Yay!

Tomo:
 All right! It's summer time!
 I'm keeping with our summer custom.

Chiyo:
 Huh?

Tomo:
 So can we take another trip to your summer home this year?

Chiyo:
 That's fine, but won't everyone be studying for entrance exams now?

Yukari:
 Hm?

Tomo:
 Then, let's make it an exams study camp all right?
 Let's get away from the din of the city and focus on our studies somewhere quiet!

Chiyo:
 Oh, that's a great idea!

Yomi:
 Don't let her fool you, Chiyo-chan.

Yukari:
 Ha ha ha ha...


Kagura, Tomo, Osaka:
 Hey, there!

Chiyo:
 Hey, you guys, we've been waiting for you!

Tomo:
 And joining us for the first time, here's Kaorin!
 Huh?

Kaorin:
Um...

I hope we'll get along!

Sakaki:
 Mm-hm.

Kaorin:
Even though I'm not worthy!

Sakaki:
 Uh-huh.

Nyamo:
 All right then, we have a total of nine people.
 And we'll be splitting up into two cars.

Yomi:
 There's nine of us?
 Two cars?
 No, no way...

 Yu... Yukari-mobile...

Kaorin:
What are you talking about?

Kagura:
 That's the car that psychologically scarred Chiyo-chan two years ago.

Kaorin:
Ah! Psychologically scarred?!

Osaka:
 Ah! Chiyo-chan already made it safe to Miss Nyamo's car!

Kaorin:
What kind of driving are we talking about?

Kagura:
 So, what now?

Osaka:
 Which of us is gonna have to ride with Miss Yukari in her car?

Yomi:
 Well, um, I guess Chiyo-chan's excused...

Kaorin:
I... I don't handle riding in cars well, so could I...

Sakaki:
 Fine, I'll ride with her.

Kaorin:
Ahhh.
I hope I'll go too.

Osaka:
 Y'all are so cool.

Tomo:
 All right! Go, Yukari!

Yukari:
 Yeah!

Kaorin:
Wha... What just happened here?!

Yukari:
 Okay, that was really weird.
 Oh?

Kaorin:
What is it?

Yukari:
 Sorry, I must've been in reverse, huh.

Tomo:
 Man, you're so bad, Yukari!

 Go, Yukari!

Yukari:
 Yeah!

Tomo:
 Come on! Pass the Nyamo-mobile!

Osaka:
 It sounds funny.
 Huh?

Tomo:
 Hey! What did you stop for?!

Yukari, Tomo:
 Looser! Looser!

Kaorin:
It's red! Ahhh!

Osaka:
 Ooh, they're flyin'.
 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:2:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Yukari:
 Safe arrival!

Tomo:
 Yay! We are here.

Yomi:
 Yeah, yeah, we are here.

Sakaki:
 Are you okay?

Kaorin:
The nice thing about roller coasters is they don't get into collisions...

Yukari:
 Huh?
 The side mirror was in the whole time.

Kaorin:
Ah!

Osaka:
 Lazy, lazy.

Kaorin:
I had no idea going to the beach would involve such suffering.

Tomo:
 Yay! We're here, we're really here!

Yomi:
 Yes, yes, we get it.

Chiyo:
 Everyone, once we've rested, let's get right on down...

Tomo:
 To the beach!

Chiyo:
 The beach already?!

Yomi:
 You're not in grade school.
 Don't wear your swimsuit under your clothes.

Chiyo:
 Isn't this trip supposed to be a study camp?

Tomo:
 I lied!

Chiyo:
 What?! So bluntly?!

Yukari,Nyamo:
 Uh...

Tomo:
 No dice?


Tomo:
 Whee!
 Yay! The ocean, the ocean!

Yomi:
 Yeah, yeah, it's the ocean.

Tomo:
 Huh?

Yomi, Kagura, Chiyo, Sakaki:
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

Kaorin:
I had no idea not being able to swim because motion sickness would be such a hardship...

Osaka:
 Ha-ha-ha-ha...
 Hot, hot! Hot, hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot!
 It's just too hot.

Sakaki:
 You might get burns on your feet today if you don't wear your sandals.

Tomo:
 Yay! Watermelon, watermelon!

Osaka:
 So nice...

Sakaki:
 Mm...

Tomo:
 Totally, I'd sure like to know those measurements.
 Though, I've also been growing quite a bit lately.

Osaka:
 What? Aren't you one of us?

Tomo:
 Oh, I am one of you!

Chiyo:
I got you! I got you, got you guys!

Yomi:
Take that! And that!

Kagura:
 But is it really okay for us to be goofing off like this instead of studying?

Tomo:
 C'mon! You're way too serious, Kagura!
 Of course, you shouldn't goof off!
 But let's goof off!

Kagura:
 You're amazing.

Nyamo:
 Just keep the two apart.
 Focus on studying when you study, focus on fun when you're on a break.

Tomo:
 You heard her?
 This camp is going be for goofing off only.

Nyamo:
 No, it's not!

Yukari:
 Sure, it is. Keep goofing off.

Tomo:
 See? It's got our teacher's stamp of approval!

Yukari:
 Even if you did study, you wouldn't be ready in time for the entrance exams anyway, so...

Kagura, Tomo:
 Huh?

Tomo:
 Really?
 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:4:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Everyone:
The food was great!

Osaka:
 Oh, yeah, lazy, lazy.

Chiyo:
 Okay, everyone, now that we've all had dinner, why don't we...

Tomo:
 Yay! It's bed time, bed time!

Yukari:
 Yes, by all means, go to bed!

Tomo:
 Really?

Yukari:
 If there's anything you don't get, don't hesitate to ask someone.

Everyone:
Yes, ma'am!

Kaorin:
Um, Excuse me, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
 Um...

Kaorin:
Um...

Kagura:
 Oh, yay. Study, study...

Kagura:
 I gotta be ready. Please let me be ready!

Yomi:
 You two are both so noisy.
 Why don't you take a cue from Osaka.

Chiyo:
 Miss Osaka is incredibly focused today, isn't she?

Osaka:
 Chiyo-chan, explain this part to me.

Chiyo:
 O-Okay.

Osaka:
 Hey, Yomi, explain this part to me.

Yomi:
 S-Sure.

Osaka:
 Miss Yukari, explain this...

Yukari:
 Are you really thinking at all?

Chiyo:
 Miss Osaka, if you stay down there, you're going to fall asleep again.

Osaka:
 Hehehe...

Yukari:
 If there's anything you don't get, don't hesitate to ask someone.

Everyone:
Yes, ma'am!

Kagura:
 Hey, did you get this part at all?

Tomo:
 Oh, yay. Study, study.

Kagura:
 Yukari, explain this part to me.

Yukari:
 If you don't get it, don't hesitate to ask someone.

Kagura:
 Coach, explain this part to me!

Nyamo:
 Huh? Me explain?!

Nyamo:
 Ma... Math... Well... um...
 Uh, let me think...
 What to say... What to say...

Osaka:
 Ya got it wrong.

Nyamo:
 Give me a second!

Nyamo:
 I... wrong... yet...
 It...It's just taking me a while to find the words... yeah, yeah, the words.
 So, you understand, I... I-I mean I could do it back in school!
 It's sure, it really is! I'm telling you the truth, I promise!

Kagura:
 So you really don't get it, huh?

Nyamo:
 Well, I...
 That is to say...
 I really don't get it at all.

Yukari:
 Come on, be nice to your poor dumb P.E. teacher,

Yukari:
 I'm not dumb! Listen, Yukari!

Yukari:
 Regarding shame, in a cultural idiosyncratic way, most Japanese treat this issue.
 I have to say, unlike my coward, I am not gripped by it, but merely fascinated.

Nyamo:
 Everyone, don't let her fool you!
 Just 'cause she's a teacher of language, it doesn't make her great or anything!

Kagura:
 Yukari is so much more...
 Much greater...

Nyamo:
 No, girls, don't be fooled by her words! Don't let her fool you!

 Hey, isn't it time for break now?
 Look, look, do you girls know how to juggle?

Chiyo:
 Ah!

Yukari:
 What are you interfering with their studies for?!

Nyamo:
 Ahhh!

Chiyo:
 Um, uh, would you please teach me how to juggle?

Nyamo:
 It's okay, you don't have to be so nice.

Chiyo:
 Ye... Yes, ma'am.

Nyamo:
 It's cold...
 Is it morning?
 Hm? Where'd this blanket...? Huh?
 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:6:&lt;h1&gt; 

Chiyo:
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
 One, two, three...

Nyamo:
 Honestly, I don't know if she's like a child or an old man.

Kaorin:
Oh, Chiyo-chan, what's that?

Chiyo:
 A stamp book.
 Miss Kurosawa made it special for me.
 She said she'll stamp it for me every morning that I do radio warm-ups.

Kaorin:
Lucky you!

Sakaki:
 Radio warm-ups?

Chiyo:
 Huh? Ah!

Sakaki:
 A stamp every morning...
 Huh?

Kaorin:
Taking a snapshot! Please act normal!

Sakaki:
 Uh, sure...

Kaorin
Please relax, relax!

Sakaki:
 Uh...

Kaorin:
Say cheese!

Kaorin:
Damn it!

Tomo:
 Oh...

Chiyo, Sakaki:
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
 One, two...

Kaorin:
I had no idea getting up this early could be such a wonderful thing.

Tomo:
 Cheese!

Kaorin:
Damn it!

Tomo:
 Wow!

Osaka:
 Whoa! She's flyin'.


Chiyo:
 Oh, Miss Osaka, you're awake.

Osaka:
 Yeah...

Chiyo:
 Now, the only one still sleeping is Miss Yukari.

Yomi:
 But I have a feeling she'll get mad so I can't bring myself to wake her.

Osaka:
 Uh...
 Then, you just let me handle it for you, okay?
 It's been my dream...
 I've always wanted to try wakin' someone with a fryin' pan.

Yomi:
 Hm? Ah!

Yukari:
 Oh, it's you, Osaka.

Kagura:
 Oh, man, you splattered everywhere!

Yukari:
 Wha... What?

Osaka:
 Ya woke up yourself...
 Then I failed...

Chiyo:
 Mi-Miss Osaka, what in the world are you carrying around?!

Osaka:
 Huh? Wh-What? I was holdin' a fryin' pan just a minute ago.
 Where'd it go?

Chiyo:
 Ah, Miss Osaka, please don't swing it this way!

Osaka:
 Do you know what happened, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
 Please don't swing it around! Ahh!

Yukari:
 Kni... knife flying...

 Osaka:
 Once again, summer break is over.

 It's autumn.

Kagura:
 Autumn?

Osaka:
 And autumn means chestnut rice.

Kagura:
 Huh?

Osaka:
 Broiled saury is good too.
 Do you have char marks like a broiled saury?

Kagura:
 Huh?
 What? Are you kidding?
 Don' be silly!

Osaka:
 Saury with rice, two big course.

Yomi:
 Kagura, don't listen to her!

Chiyo:
 Tomo, what's the matter?
 Your eyes look so dead.

Tomo:
 Today is a summer service day.
 Today is a summer service day.

 It ain't a summer service day.

Tomo:
 Today is a summer service day.
 Today is a summer service day.
 Today is a summer service day.
 Today is a summer service day.

 We're still in the middle of summer break, you know?
 Let's all go together to the blue, blue sea.

Osaka, Tomo:
 Today is a summer service day.
 Today is a summer service day.
 Today is a summer service day.

Chiyo:
 No, you're wrong!

Osaka, Tomo:
 Chiyo-chan, please cast a charm on us that'll get us motivated.

Chiyo:
 Ca... Cast a charm?

Chiyo:
 Huh...

Kagura:
We're finally in our third year!
The last sports fest in high school!
All right, let's do it again this year!

Osaka:
What're we doin' for our third year?
Is there gonna be some conspicuous distinction?

Kagura:
Distinction?
But we're gonna be doing the same thing!

Osaka:
Which scene should we keep our eye on?

Kagura:
Um, the bread eating contest, I guess.

Osaka:
Then, which one should we keep our ear on, our mouth, and our nose?

Kagura:
I have no idea what you are talking about.
Anyway, let's get fired up!
