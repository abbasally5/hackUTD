 Mihke:
Mew.

Girl:
Mihke!
I'm so happy.
I'm so glad, you see.

Mother:
Did you have fun?

Girl:
Yeah, I liked it, even though I cried a little bit.

Boy:
Hey, Mommy, you know what?

Mother:
No, what?

Boy:
The big girl behind us was crying lots and lots, too.
She cried through the whole movie.

Mother:
The big girl behind us?

Sakaki:
 Oh.
 Mr. Kitty Cat...

Chihiro:
Wow, they're so cute!

Kaorin:
Aren't they?
And this one playing with a ball of yarn is totally adorable.

Chiyo:
 I think they are all adorable.

Osaka:
 Uh-huh.
 They look so fluffy and soft, it's like they're just two balls of fur.

Chihiro:
 I know, I look how peacefully they sleep.

Kaorin:
Oh, Miss Sakaki. Here, you take a look.

Sakaki:
 Hm?

Kaorin:
Our cat had kittens.

Sakaki:
 Um, if I wanna order copies, do I write it in the back?

Kaorin:
Huh? Do you like cats too, Miss Sakaki?

Sakaki:
 Um... a little.

Chiyo:
 So, do you have any cats of your own?

Sakaki:
 Oh, no. My parents can't handle cats or anything like that.

Kaorin:
Oh, I see then. That's really too bad.


Woman:
Will these photos be all right for you, ma'am?

Sakaki:
 I guess.

Woman:
Thank you, please come again!

Sakaki:
 Huh!

Chiyo:
 Oh....uh...

Sakaki:
 Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
 Oh, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
 Hey, where did you get that?

Chiyo:
 Well, you see, I won it in a lottery in the shopping district.
 Wait a minute while I take it off.
 Okay, let me see here...
 Uahh.....

 I'm sorry for making you carry the costume all this way.

Sakaki:
 No, it's okay.

 Yomi:
 Huh?

Tomo:
 Like for real?

Osaka:
 I had no idea.

Chiyo:
 Uh-huh, that's right, it really is.

Sakaki:
 Morning.

Chiyo:
 Oh, hello, Miss Sakaki.
 A very good morning to you too!

Tomo:
 Good morning.

Yomi:
 Good morning.

Osaka:
 Good Mornin'.

Sakaki:
 You look cheerful.

Yomi:
 Oh, we were talking about Chiyo-chan just now.
 She has a birthday coming up real soon.

Sakaki:
 Your birthday, huh?

Chiyo:
 Uh-huh, it's this coming Sunday.
 And I'll finally be turning eleven years old.
 That means I'll be a little more grown up now!

Sakaki:
 Eleven years old...

Tomo:
 But just looking at her, you'd swear she was a lot younger than eleven years old, huh.

Chiyo:
 Even when I was in grade school, if we were lined up by height, I was always to the front.

 Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
 Huh?

Chiyo:
 Miss Sakaki, please tell me, how did you get to be so tall?

Sakaki:
 How... what?

Chiyo:
 I wish I could get taller just like you.

Sakaki:
 No, being short is better. You're cuter that way.

Chiyo:
 Yeah? But being tall makes you like that much cooler.

Sakaki:
 Tall is cooler?

Chiyo:
 Uh-huh.

Sakaki:
 Being cute rather than cool is...

Chiyo:
 Huh?

Sakaki:
 It's... stronger.

Chiyo:
 Stronger?

Tomo:
 Speaking of tall, are you still growing, Miss Sakaki?

Sakaki:
 Looks that way.

Tomo:
 Thought so!
 You're even taller than you were this spring, aren't you?
 Did you break 170 yet?

Sakaki:
 I broke it.

Osaka:
 Uah... Uah... Uah...
 Chiyo-chan!
 That's it.
 Miss Sakaki must be suckin' it all away.

Chiyo:
 Miss Sakaki?
 Have you been taking all my height away from me?

Sakaki:
 No...

Chiyo:
 You took it, didn't you?
 You took it, didn't you?
 You took it, didn't you?
 You took it, didn't you?
 You took it, didn't you?!

Sakaki:
 Um... no...

Chiyo:
 Give it back! Please give it back!

Sakaki:
 I didn't...

Chiyo:
 Give it back! Give it back!

Sakaki:
 I...

Chiyo:
 Give it back! Give it back!

Sakaki:
I'm sorry...

Chiyo:
 Please give it back!
 Give it back! Give it back! Give it back!

Tomo:
 Ooh, Miss Sakaki does not have a clue what to do.

Osaka:
 Way to go, Chiyo-chan.
 Guess that's an eleven-year-old for ya.

Yomi:
 Say, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
 Yes?

Yomi:
 You wanna have a party this Sunday?
 For your birthday?

Chiyo:
 Huh?

Yomi:
 We can all get together at your place for the party.
 How's that?

Tomo:
 I'm in!

Osaka:
 Uh-huh, me too.

Sakaki:
 Mm-hm, I'll go.

Chiyo:
 Really, all of you?
 I'm so excited!

Osaka:
 We've gotta get presents and stuff and set it all up!

Tomo:
 Oh, yeah!

Yomi:
 While we're on the subject, what did you get last year?

Chiyo:
 Oh, I got ribbons.

Sakaki:
 Uh... Ribbons...

Osaka:
 Hey, what's the matter, Miss Sakaki?

Sakaki:
 Uh, nothing.
 Huh...

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:4:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Sakaki:
 Uh...

Girl:
Wow, it's so cute!

Sakaki:
 Oh...


Woman:
Here you are. That'll be 1,500 yen.

Children:
These are fun!
Can I get one?

Girl:
Here, I've got you one.

Boy:
Thank you.

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:6:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Everyone:
Hello!

Chiyo:
 Hello, welcome, everyone.

Everyone:
Thank you for having us over!

Tomo:
 Happy birthday, Chiyo-chan!

Osaka:
 Happy birthday.

Yomi:
 Hi, Chiyo-chan, we brought some presents with us.

Chiyo:
 Wow, thank you all so very much!
 Well, anyway, please come up to my room.
 Oh, hold on. Miss Sakaki?

 Miss Sakaki! Miss Sakaki!

Sakaki:
 Hm?


Tomo:
 All right, ladies, let's begin the super awesome present contest!

Everyone:
Yay!

Tomo:
 At the top of the lineup is me.
 Here you go.

Chiyo:
 Thank you very much.
 I can't wait!

 What's it supposed to be?

Tomo:
 It's my feeling!

 What?
 You guys didn't like that?
 I guess that means I failed, huh.
 Fine, have it your way.
 Here. This one's the real present I got for you.

Chiyo:
 But, what is it?

Tomo:
 It's a magic wand!
 If you use it, you'll be able to grow tall just like Miss Sakaki!

Chiyo:
 Even I'm old enough that I don't believe that stuff anymore.

Tomo:
 Oh, come on, come on.

Yomi:
 Here you are.
 This present is from me.

Chiyo:
 Thank you very much, Yomi.
 I'm sure I'll love it!

Sakaki:
 This one's from me. Here.

Chiyo:
 Oh my goodness,
 You brought a little stuffed kitten for me?
 It's so cute!
 Thank you so much, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
 You're welcome.

Chiyo:
 I wonder what name I should give to it?

Sakaki:
 It's Mon Petit.

Chiyo:
 Oh, I see, so it already has a name.
 I'll take good care of it.

Sakaki:
 Now, I want you to give her a good home.

Chiyo:
 I'm a little surprised though.
 I had no idea you named your stuffed animals too, Miss Sakaki.
 It's nice to meet you, Mon Petit.

Sakaki:
 Mon Petit...

Chiyo:
 Huh?

Sakaki:
 Mon Petit is the younger sister.
 And she has an older sister.

Chiyo:
 Uh...

Osaka:
 Speakin' of names, not too long ago, I discovered that a lot of racehorses have real cute-sounded names.

Yomi:
 Huh, really?

Osaka:
 Yeah, they do.
 If I remember a lot, I think some of the names were like "Princess Winy" or "Esprit Ja-ja".

Yomi:
 You call those cute?

Osaka:
 Why don't you give her a cute name like that?

Chiyo, Sakaki:
 Uh...

Sakaki:
 No way.

Osaka:
 What? But...

Sakaki:
 No way.

Osaka:
 Oh, well, whatever.
 My present is a stuffed animal too.
 Here you go.

Chiyo:
 Thank you very much, Miss Osaka.
 Oh.

Sakaki:
 Ah!
 That's...

Chiyo:
 What?
 What's wrong, Miss Sakaki?

Sakaki:
 The father...

Chiyo:
 Huh?

Sakaki:
 This here is the father...

Chiyo:
 Do you mean, her father?

Sakaki:
 No, yours.

Chiyo:
 Mine?

Tomo:
 Fine.
 So whatever my present didn't make anyone happy or stir up any interesting conversation, it's not like I care.

 Oh, Chiyo-chan, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
 Huh? Yes?
 What is it, Tomo?

Tomo:
 Chiyo-chan, you're a Giants fan?

Chiyo:
 Oh, yeah, this year, the Giants is going all the way.

Tomo:
 No way, the Giants are hopeless.
 This year is going to Hanshins.

Chiyo:
 The Giants!

Tomo:
 Hanshins!

Chiyo:
 The Giants!

Tomo:
 Hanshins!

Chiyo:
 The Giants!

Tomo:
 No, Hanshins!

Chiyo:
 The Giants!

Tomo:
 Hanshins!

Chiyo:
 The Giants are going to win for sure!

Tomo:
 Hanshins!

Umpire
Strike!

Tomo:
 You know that's what the Giants say every year and every year they keep losing again.
 It'll be the same things this year.
 Ah, well, I mean...

Sakaki:
 Don't worry.

Chiyo, Tomo:
 Huh?

Sakaki:
 You have your father.

Chiyo, Tomo:
 Huh?

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:8:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Yomi:
 Well, we're going now.

Osaka:
 It was real fun.

Chiyo:
 Oh, I'll come too.

Yomi:
 What?

Chiyo:
 I'll go with you part of the way.
 I have to walk Mr. Tadakichi anyway.

Tomo:
 Okay. Then, let's all go together.

Chiyo:
 All right.

 Oh!
 It's a shortcut if we turn here and go down that way.
Tomo:
 Why did you stop?

Osaka:
 Wow...

Chiyo:
 Wow!

Yomi:
 Wow, it's so...

Tomo:
 So big.

Chiyo:
 It's really pretty.

Osaka:
 I almost feel like it's drawing me into it.


Chiyo:
 Oh, wait!

 Wait for me!

 Look out!

 Miss Sakaki!

Yomi:
 See you tomorrow at school!

Osaka:
 So long.

Tomo:
 Later.

Kagura:
I'm Kagura.
I showed up a couple of times, like in the pool and sports fest episodes.
But next time is the second year class shuffle.
With me and Sakaki's class, you can bet there's gonna be some competition.
All right, Sakaki! Now is the time for us to fight it out!
I challenge you!

Sakaki:
What? Who?

Kagura:
Hey, wait!
Sakaki, wait up, damn it!

Sakaki:
I'm not waiting.
