It's Azumanga Dai....

Yukari:
 Oh my god,
 Is it that late already?

Yukari:
 Huh?
 Okay, what just happened here?
 Oh, what's the deal?


Student:
Oh crap, I'm gonna be late.
I am gonna be so freakin` late for... Hm?

Student:
Oh hey, Miss Yukari?
What's wrong with your bike?

Yukari:
 There's just no way.
 This is perfect. Hm!
 I'm sure the vice principal's got a nice long earful waiting if I'm late on the first day of school!

Student:
Miss Yukari?

Yukari:
 "Tanizaki, how many times have you been late now?
 Keep it up and you'll never set a good example for the students.
 They're at a very impressionable age, you know?"

 Impressionable, yeah right, whatever.
 Baloney!

Student:
Miss Yukari?

Yukari:
 Oh man! Just thinking about it pisses me off.
 Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, Argh!

Student:
Miss Yukari?

Yukari:
What!? You think you're gonna mess with me?

Student:
Miss Yukari! You're gonna break it!
Come on! Miss Yukari! Miss Yukari!

Student:
Let's see here, ah, looks like your chain just came off.
This'll be a cinch.
Man, did I luck out.
If I'm with a teacher, they've got to excuse the tardy.

Student:
Hey, Miss Yukari, today I... huh?
Hey! Give me back my bike!

Yukari:
 Man, just in time.
 Damn that frigging bike chain.
 You're gonna get yours, you just wait!

Yukari:
 Good morning, class!
 Hi, everyone!
 Okay, I'm Ms.Tanizaki, homeroom teacher for class three.
 If there's anything you don't get, just ask me.

Student:
Um... Miss Tanizaki.

Yukari:
 I know I said anything.
 Hu hu hu hu.
 But my measurements are well-kept secret, okay?
 That's just so we're clear, it's not because I don't have a good figure
 'cause I'm embarrassed or something.
 I don't mean to brag, but my measurements are pretty amazing.
 Oh, Geez, look what you made me say on the first day,
 you cheeky little boy.

Student:
No I wanted to tell you your class is next door, ma'am.

Yukari:
 Huh?

Student:
This is class four.


Tomo:
 Huh?

Yomi:
 Hm?

Yukari:
 Okay, starting today, I'll be your homeroom teacher name is Tanizaki.
 Nice to meet you all.
 Huh?

Chiyo:
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

Yukari:
 Oh yeah, I forgot.
 Moving right along, let me introduce our new transfer student, Chiyo Mihama.

Chiyo:
 I'm Chiyo Mihama.
 Thank you for having me in your class.

Yukari:
 Chiyo-chan is only ten years old.
 But because of her unique gift,
 It`s been decided to allow her admission to high school.

Students:
Whoa!

Yukari:
 And none of you'd better pick on the little brat, just because she is smart for her age.

Students:
Whoa.

Student:
Hang in there, Chiyo-chan!

Student:
We're rooting for you!

Chiyo:
 Uh, thank you.


Chiyo:
 Cooking is so fun, cooking is so fun.
 Now it's time to take a break and see what we have done.
 Yay, it's ready!

Chiyo:
 Cooking is so fun, cooking is so fun.
 Now it's time to take a break and see what we have done.
 Yay, it's ready!
 Wait a second.
 What we were doing isn't cooking at all, is it?
 Ahahaha.


 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:2:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Chiyo:
 Yeah, that's it.

Yukari:
 Very good, Chiyo-chan.
 I see you are getting help already.
 Fine! Fantastic! Wunderbar! Â¡Muy excelente, muchacha!
 If you're stuck, just ask one of your classmates for help, okay?

Chiyo:
 Okay.

Chihiro:
The truth is.... Well, you see....
The truth is.... You see....
The truth is that I was the one getting help.
Am I just stupid.

Chiyo:
 What's wrong?
 We're classmates, right?

Kaorin:
All right.
Finally, it's lunch time.

Student:
There, there, don't cry.

Kaorin:
Hey Chiyo-chan!
You wanna sit and have lunch with us?

Chiyo:
 Okay, sure.
 They made us lunches in the elementary school, so it's kind of fun bringing my lunch with me.

Kaorin:
Really?

Chiyo:
 Yeah but, it's hard getting up so early to make it.

Kaorin:
What!
She makes her lunch all by herself?

Chiyo:
 Before, I only got to bring my lunch when I was at a sports fest or a nature walk.

Kaorin:
And it looks very good, too!

Kaorin:
What is she?
Miss Perfect Super-woman?

Chiyo:
 Ah ha! The bridge to the palace.

Yomi:
 Wow, Chiyo.
 You're like good at everything you do, aren't you?
 There's nothing you're not good at.

Chiyo:
 Um... not true. There are some things.
 Uh, let me see...
 Oh, I'm really bad at tongue twisters.

Yomi:
 Tongue twisters?

Chiyo:
 Okay, here I go.
 GAS BLAST GUST BUST GLASS ..... CUSTARD
 Ahahaha.

Yomi:
 Dang!
 How can one girl be so totally adorable, huh?


Teacher:
Anyone who didn't do the homework, raise your hand.

Teacher:
That's it!
You're not getting away with it today!
All right. Line up at the front.

Chiyo:
 ......

Teacher:
I'd better see finished assignments from now on.

Student:
Yes, sir.

Teacher:
Hm?

Chiyo:
 Uh, well....
 I guess....
 I was ..... maybe a little bit careless and I was really planning on doing it at all.
 I was...
 But I just forgot to.


Chiyo:
 Cooking is so fun, cooking is so fun.
 Now it's time to take a break and see what we have done.
 Yay, it's ready!

Chiyo:
 Cooking is so fun, cooking is so fun.
 Now it's time to take a break and see what we have done.
 Yay, it's ready!
 This time was a big success.
 Let's all sit together and ...
 No, stop!
 We have to wait!
 You can't eat it yet!

Chiyo:
 Hi! Excuse me.
 Have you turned in your career questionnaire yet?

Student:
Oh, that.... Sorry.
Can you hold on one second?

Chiyo:
 Okay.

Chiyo:
 Hi, I'm here to collect your career questionnaire.
 Is it ready?

Student:
Yeah, here.
Thank you, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
 That's everyone but... Oh?

Chiyo:
 Excuse me.

Sakaki:
Huh?


Chiyo:
Excuse me.
 I'm collecting everyone's career preference sheets.

Sakaki:
 Um... Mm-hm.

Chiyo:
 Thank you very much.

Chiyo:
 She seems like a pretty scary person.
 Huh?
 Veterinarian, Florist, Stuffed Animal boutique owner, huh?
 Maybe she's a nice person after all.

Student:
Hey hey, isn't Miss Sakaki just the coolest?

Kaorin:
Mm-hm, she's the best.
Way better than most of the boys around here.

Student:
Yeah, I know.
And I love how she's a woman of few words.

Student:
Is something the matter?

Kaorin:
I thought, I...
Just now, two seconds ago, I thought I caught a glimpse of something really cute.

Kaorin:
Miss Sakaki.
I was wondering, do you belong to any clubs or anything?

Sakaki:
 Uh, no.
 Can't say I do.

Kaorin:
Well, you see,
I belong to the Astronomy club and...

Sakaki:
 Astronomy club?

Kaorin:
Y... yeah, that's right.
We do research on stars, talk about things like outer space.
And sometimes we go stargazing.
So, um, if you'd like, of course, would you be....

Sakaki:
Would I what?

Kaorin:
Ah, sorry!
If you're just not interested in that kind of thing, I understand, it's okay, really.
So please forget everything I just told you.
I'll see you around!

Sakaki:
 I wish she'd invited me.


Sakaki:
 Hm? A cat.

Chiyo:
 Miss Sakaki. Miss Sakaki.
 What's the matter?
 Why's your hand all wrapped up?

Sakaki:
 Oh, my hand.

Chiyo:
 Hm?

Sakaki:
 Maybe he was in a bad mood.

Chiyo:
 Did Miss Sakaki get into a fight?

Sakaki:
 Pretty sure it was here.
 The cat from this morning!
 Oh, he's coming.
 He's coming toward me.
 Seems he's in a good mood this time.

 Oh, no! Yukari's here, already?!

 As punishment, I'm gonna stand right out here in the hallway.

Yukari:
 I couldn't care less, you know.

Tomo:
 Hahaha.
 I always wanted to give this a shot.
 Oh, yeah,
 'cause hey, let's face it.
 They just don't send you out into the hall that often these days.
 All right, Tomo.
 Let's set a new record for this and surprise everyone.

Tomo:
 Hahaha.
 Piece of cake, piece of cake.

Chiyo:
 Well, I, um... I can't.

Tomo:
 Hey!

Yukaru:
 Hm? Okay, Miss Takino.

Tomo:
 I don't know the answer either.
 Mm-hm.
 Now we're tied, Chiyo-chan!
 Oh, yeah.

Tomo:
 Yes, lunch time!
 Today they've got bread, and bread's what I'm getting!
 Okay, I'm on a bread-run.

Yomi:
 Hey, count me in!

Chihiro:
Get me one too, please.

 Gotcha!

Yomi:
 Well, at least you can count on her when it's something like this

Chihiro:
I know what you mean.

Tomo:
 And it's goal!

Yomi:
 Y... you already picked them up?

Chihiro:
That was really fast.

Tomo:
 So, what was my time, Yomi?

Yomi:

Tomo:
 You and me, 100 meter dash, Miss Sakaki!

Kaorin:

Come on! Do your best!

Tomo:
 Okay, here we go.

Sakaki:
 But why?

Kaorin:
Tomo versus Miss Sakaki? But Miss Sakaki is really athletic, isn't she?
Do you think Tomo has some kind of secret plan for beating her in this race?

Yomi:
 Uh-uh.


Kaorin:
Huh...

Chiyo:
 On your mark! Get set!

Tomo:
 Hold it!
 Miss Sakaki, your boobs have eight centimeters on mine,
 so please step back eight centimeters.

Sakaki:
 Oh.

Kaorin:
What's up with that?
That's not fair!

Yomi:
 Did she say eight?

Chiyo:
 Hey, this time we`re going for real, okay?
 On your mark! Get set! Go!

Kaorin:
Oh no! Tomo's taken the lead now.

Yomi:
 Just a matter of time.

Kaorin:
Miss Sakaki!
You were really amazing!
Here you go.

Sakaki:
 Oh, thank you.

 Yukari:
 Well class, it seems we're getting a fresh new transfer student (in) today.

Students:
Huh?

Yukari:
 This new addition to our force hails from Osaka.
 And it was no small trick getting her.

Tomo:
 An Osakan gal, huh?
 All I can think of is....

Narration:
Hey, you make any money?
It's coming along.

Tomo:
 She'll be my new archrival!
 I bet she's a girl equipped with all kinds of incredible comebacks!
 Yomi, take a dig at me! Say: "Why in the heck?"

Yomi:
 Huh?

Tomo:
 Come on!

Yomi:
 Why in the heck?

Tomo:
 Argh! Argh! Argh!

Tomo:
 Okay so, think I should do that once she takes a stab at me?

Yomi:
 Why the heck would you?


Yukari:
 Well then, now that we've straightened all our desks,
 allow me to introduce you to your new classmate.
 Miss Kasuga.

Yukari:
 Hi there.
 Tell us about yourself.

Osaka:
 Yes ma'am.
 I'm Ayumu Kasuga.
 And I come from Osaka.
 It's pleasure to meet all of you.

Yukari:
 No, no, no, no.
 It's very sweet of you to be so considerate and try to speak like we do.
 But you can just say, "Darn pleased ta meetcha! "

Osaka:
 But, but even in Osaka... I...

Yukari:
 Go on!

Osaka:
 Um... darn pleased ta meetcha, um, y'all.


Chihiro:
Hey, tell me if this is true or not:
do people in Osaka cross the street even when the light's red?

Osaka:
 I don't know, I mean, I don't.
 I don't like crowded places much.

Yomi:
 I have to say, you don't really seem like the typical Osakan, Kasuga.
 I was expecting someone a little more rowdy than you.

Osaka:
 Well, it's not like all us Osaka folk are rowdy, you know.

Tomo:
 Aha, Imposter!

Osaka:
 Imposter? I'm an imposter?
 You say I'm a fake but...

Tomo:
 Okay, then show me your lunch box.
 As they say, the proof is in the pudding, or in the case of the true Osakan, and the fried octopus balls they always pack.

Osaka:
 Um, but the thing is .. just 'cause I'm from Osaka...

Tomo:
 What?

Osaka:
 Huh. Hey, why in the heck?

Tomo:
 All right!


Yukari:
 I was too busy to complete the work.

Osaka:
 People back in Osaka used to tell me all the time how spaced out I was.
 But I really ought to take this transfer as a chance to get it together once and for all.
 Get it together.
 Get it together.
 Get it together.

Yukari:
 Miss Kasuga.

Osaka:
 Get it together.
 Get it together.

Yukari:
 Miss Kasuga.

Osaka:
 Uh?

Yukari:
 Miss Kasuga.
 Were you listening?

Osaka:
 Uh, no.

Yukari:
 Come on!
 Get it together, will ya?
 Okay, Mr. Ohyama.

Ohyama:
Yes, ma'am.

Osaka:
 Get it together.
 Get it together.
 Get it together.

Yukari:
 Oh, the bell already?
 All right.
 Teacher's done for the day.
 Well, adios!

Osaka:
 It's finally over.
 I'll get it together tomorrow.
 Get it together.
 Get it together.

Tomo:
 Osaka! Osaka!

Osaka:
 Hm?

Tomo:
 Hey, Osaka.
 Japanese Pizza meals, do they really exist?

Osaka:
 Um, Osaka?

Tomo:
 Oh, yeah.
 Kansai people are totally wack.
 Eating a full bowl of rice with a Japanese Pizza.
 Do you do that, too, Osaka?

Osaka:
 Osaka?
 Do you mean me?

Tomo:
 Yeah, it's like your new nickname.
 Osaka, 'cause you're from Osaka.
 Get it?

Osaka:
 Huh?
 Wait! You mean just like that?

Tomo:
 Did everybody hear me?
 Miss Kasuga is now Osaka.

Osaka:
 Say what?

Yomi:
 Okay, Sure thing.

Kaorin:
Okay.

Chiyo:
 All right. I understand you.

Chihiro:
Yep, that's a roger.

Tomo:
 All right.
 Then it's set.
 You're officially Osaka.
 So welcome to class three, classmate.

Osaka:
 And just like that, before I knew it, I was nicknamed Osaka.
 Wah.


-- Preview --

Osaka:
Azumanga Daioh. That's Great King Azumanga, right?

Yomi:
Where'd that come from?

Osaka:
So, where's Prince Azumanga?

Tomo:
The prince is the king's kid, so it's gotta be whichever shows airing before us.

Yomi:
No, it's the one after.
Ever hear of succession?

Chiyo:
I think it's kinda weird to be calling it Great King in the first place.

Osaka:
I got it. The culprit is with us right here.

Yomi:
What do you mean, culprit?

Osaka:
This preview is Prince Azumanga!

Everyone:
Oh.
