 Chiyo:
Huh?
Good morning, Mr. Tadakichi.
This is Mr. Tadakichi.
He is always by my side.
He's been living with us since I was five years old.
When we first met, he and I were about the same size.
But Mr. Tadakichi grew and grew, and finally passed me.
Hm. Smile.
My day begins with preparing my lunch for school.
Asparagus with bacon, salad, and a small omelet to top it all.
Then, I wake up my mother and father.
It's morning!
And eat breakfast.

See you later!
I'm off to school.

It feels good when the weather is nice.
Oh, but my parents bought me a new umbrella, so little rain might not be so bad, either.

Yuka:
Chiyo-chan!

Chiyo:
Uh.

Yuka:
Chiyo-chan!
Long time no see!

Chiyo:
Ah, Miruchi! Yuka!

These are my classmates from grade school, Miruchi and Yuka.

Long time no see.

Yuka:
Wow, is that your high school uniform?

Miruchi:
It's the first time I've seen the summer one.

Chiyo:
It's really cute, huh?
Although, the skirt length is the same for winter as it is for the summer time.

They're in 6th grade, but I'm a second year student in high school.
It's because I skipped forward to the first year of high school when I was in 5th grade.

Oh, yeah! So what's really popular at school right now?

Yuka:
Jump rope!
It's gotten really popular again.

Miruchi:
Mm, and it's pretty fun too. Right?

Yuka:
And everyone can play too.

Chiyo:
Wow, jumping rope! Brings back memories.

Yuka:
What's popular in high school?

Chiyo:
Huh?

Miruchi:
Yuka, Chiyo-chan's in high school now, so she doesn't play anymore.

Yuka:
Oh, you're right.

Chiyo:
We play around in high school too...
But I guess we don't do jump rope.

Sakaki:
Oh.

Chiyo:
See you around.

Miruchi:
Later.

Yuka:
Bye-bye.

Chiyo:
Miruchi and Yuka attend elementary school.
I was attending the same school just a while ago too, but...

Girl1:
We've got swimming today!

Girl2:
Yeah, swimming!

Girl3:
Oh, wait for me!
Wait!

Chiyo:
But... But I am... I am a high school student.

Sakaki:
Morning.

Chiyo:
Oh, good morning, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
Those your friends?

Chiyo:
Oh, yes.
They're my classmates from back in grade school.

If we go straight down this road, we get to my high school.


 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:2:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Chiyo:
They said jump rope is really popular right now in elementary school.

Sakaki:
Oh yeah, jump rope.
It's been a while.

Chiyo:
This is Miss Sakaki from my class.
Miss Sakaki lives in my neighborhood, so I see her a lot on my way to school.

So, did you jump rope too?
Actually, I used to be quite good at it.

Sakaki:
Yeah.
Huh!

Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki is big, but quiet.
She really listens to what I say.

Speaking of which, swimming starts today,
I just can't wait.
I want to swim as well as you do, Miss Sakaki...
Huh?!

But every so often, she suddenly disappears.
It's a mystery.

Tomo:
Morning!
How goes it, my friends?

Chiyo:
Good morning.

Tomo:
Hey, Chiyo-chan! Good morning, Yomi!

Chiyo:
This is Tomo and Miss Yomi. Um...

Yomi:
Tomo.

Tomo:
Huh?

Yomi:
Did you catch that show yesterday?
The one I asked you to record.

Tomo:
Oh, shoot! I forgot.

Yomi:
Oh... I knew it.
I was stupid for even asking you.

Tomo:
Stupid! Stupid!
Stupid! Stupid!
Stupid! Stu...

Chiyo:
This is the kind of people they are.

Yomi:
You're the stupid one!

Teacher:
Let's move it!
Slacking off is only gonna hurt you.

Kimura:
Um, "shitari" is a form of the sa-column irregular verb, "su."
However, it can sometimes be used as a noun as well,...

Boy:
She still hasn't shown up.

Girl:
Yukari sure likes coming in late.

Boy:
Gotta be a new record.

Tomo:
Is there something going on today?

Yomi:
Who knows? The thing is it's Miss Yukari, she probably just overslept.

Tomo:
No, if I know my Yukari, I'll bet you anything today's the release date of the limited edition box for some video game.

Yomi:
There's a dumb theory.

Tomo:
Yeah, because you're the dumb one, aren't ya?

Sakaki:
How could I...
Huh, if I become one of them...
Oh...

Chiyo:
I'm a kitty cat!

Yukari:
This is not study hall!

Chiyo:
This is our homeroom teacher, Miss Yukari.
She teaches language and grammar.

Yukari:
I just can't believe it!
I was gonna make a quick stop at the gaming store on my way here, but there was this huge line on a weekday!
Probably a bunch of college kids with all kinds of free time.
Honestly! Well, you know I'm late because of them!

Chiyo:
She is a rather unconventional teacher.

Teacher:
Okay! That'd be sure to drink plenty of fluids!

Chiyo:
High school classes are more fun than grade school was.

Yukari:
Now, for this...
Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Yes, ma'am.

Yukari:
Good. Impressive as always.

Chiyo:
Aha.

Chiyo, Yukari:
Huh?

Osaka:
Huh? Um...

Oh, brother.

Yukari:
So, did you sleep well?

Chiyo:
Aha.

Osaka:
No, not very.
Ah! No, that's...
That's not what I...

Chiyo:
Miss Osaka often sleeps during class.
Could she be a night owl?

 Kagura:
"At times, he appeared young and energetic,"

Chiyo:
Unlike grade school, in high school, we have a different teacher for every subject.
So, we have all sorts of teachers.

Kagura:
......
"Truly, what one would call a monster passing by."

Kimura:
Okay, you can stop there.
Um, all right, who would be reading next?
Anyone?
Oh, yeah. The other day, I had an opportunity to speak with a teacher from a girls' high school.
If they have P.E. in first hour...
Then they... they apparently don't care whether they wear their P.E. clothes to homeroom too!
And when they have swimming...
Swimsuits!

Boy:
He's serious.

Girl:
He's crying for real.

Chiyo:
We really have all sorts of teachers.

Yes?

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan, here.

Chiyo:
Thank you.

Some things haven't changed since grade school.

Yukari:
This time for sure!

Chiyo:
Unlike grade school, there is no school lunch in high school.
So, we either bring our lunch, buy bread at the co-op, or eat at the school cafeteria.

Osaka:
Like the post-war...

Yomi:
We are in the post-war.

Tomo:
Here you go, thanks for waiting!

Osaka:
Welcome back.

Tomo:
Fried noodle's subs all around!

Chiyo:
Wow! Tomo, you're the best!

Tomo:
Here, that's yours, Osaka.

Osaka:
Melon bread...

Tomo:
Huh?

Osaka:
I asked you to get some melon bread...

Tomo:
Hey! Who cares?
Fried noodle's subs are harder to come by.

Chiyo:
Harder to come by?

Yukari:
I forgot my wallet!

Tomo:
They left it open.

Yomi:
Probably because it lets the breeze through.

Chiyo:
Wow...

Chiyo:
The weather is so nice and the breeze feels great too.

Osaka:
Yeah, it does.
Feels like you could fly away if ya just jumped off from the top of here?
Huh? Hm?

Chiyo:
I feel like Miss Osaka might really do things like that.

Tomo:
Hey! Let's eat over here, okay!

Yukari:
Ahhh!!

Damn it, they sold out!

Chiyo:
Eating our lunch on the roof was a perfect idea.

Tomo:
It just tastes better when you eat somewhere up high.

Osaka:
Huh?
What is it?

Chiyo:
Nothing.

Yomi:
Tomo.

Tomo:
Hm?

Yomi:
That sub looks really good.
Why don't you give me a bite?

Tomo:
What?!

Yomi:
Come on now, I always let you look at my homework.

Tomo:
You idiot!
That's my line!

Yomi:
The line belongs to me!

Tomo:
Ha!

Yomi:
Was it good?

Tomo:
Oh, yeah! Really good!

Osaka:
They sure have a lot of energies.

Chiyo:
Tomo and Miss Yomi have been together since grade school, so they always seem to have fun together.
The rooftop feels great.

Yomi:
You are so...

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:6:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Nyamo:
Okay, that's it for warm-ups!
Gather around!

Chiyo:
Fourth hour is P.E.
Today, we have swimming.

Nyamo:
Today, we'll swim four 25-meter laps.
And those of you who can't swim can use a kick board, okay?

Everyone:
Yes, ma'am!

Yomi:
So, what are you doing?
You're using a kick board?

Chiyo:
No! Today, I will swim all the way to the middle without one!

Kagura:
You go for it, Chiyo-chan!

Chiyo:
Right!

Chiyo:
That's Miss Kagura.

Yomi:
Now, the middle of the pool is a bit deeper, so be careful, okay?

Chiyo:
Right.

Tomo:
Got two!

Kimura:
Uh...

Tomo:
Give it back, now!

Yomi:
You don't need two!

Tomo:
Yes I do too!

Chiyo:
Miss Kagura is a member of the swim team, so she's the best swimmer in the class.
She can even hold her own against the boys.

Wow.

Yomi:
You can do it, go Chiyo!

Chiyo:
Yes! Okay, here I go!

Chiyo:
I've become able to go for about ten meters, freestyle.
In order to go further, I think I'll have to master breathing to the side.
Ah!

Tomo:
Hey, I think I just hit something.

Nyamo:
Ahhh!

Tomo:
Man, sorry about that.
You're so small, I couldn't even see you.

Kagura:
Hey, hey, be more careful.
Chiyo-chan's feet can't reach the bottom.
There is always a risk of death when you go swimming.

Chiyo:
Death?!
I can't wait 'til I grow tall!

Chiyo:
Finally, there's cleaning.
I like cleaning, because everything gets nice and tidy.

Tomo, you can't sweep like that.

I wish she would be more serious.

Huh?
Miss Osaka is serious about cleaning, but she's not very good with a dustpan.

And then, we leave school.
Today was certainly another busy day.

Osaka, Chiyo:
Bye-bye.

Chiyo:
I'm home!

Unlike grade school, high school lets out late.
So, by the time I finish my homework, it's already evening.

Let's go, Mr. Tadakichi.
In the evening, I go for a walk with Mr. Tadakichi.

Oh!

Lately, Miss Sakaki has been joining us on our walks.
It seems Miss Sakaki also likes Mr. Tadakichi.
Taking these walks with the three of us sure is fun.

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:8:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Chiyo:
I know, let's go through the park.

Sakaki:
Mm.

Girl:
Here goes!

Girls:
Ready. One. Two. Three.

Girl:
Four.

Girl:
Oh, Mimi, you messed up!

Girl:
Time to switch.

Girl:
Okay.

Girl:
Oh, it's 5:30 already!

Girl:
I'm gonna be late for cram school!

Girl:
I'll see you later!

Girls:
Bye-bye!

Sakaki:
We're in the middle of our walk, but...

Chiyo:
Huh?

Sakaki:
You wanna play, just for a little bit?

Chiyo:
What?

Sakaki:
Here.

Sakaki, Chiyo:
Little missy, come on in.
Rock, paper, scissors, nobody wins.
If you lose, then go outside.
Little missy, come on in.
Rock, paper, scissors...

Tomo:
And we're tied!

Hey, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
To... Tomo?!

Yomi:
Jump rope, huh?
Brings back memories.

Chiyo:
Huh?

Osaka:
Especially since we don't even get to do it in P.E. anymore.

Chiyo:
Miss Yomi! Miss Osaka!

Osaka:
Know what? I'm here to look for some Tokyo earthworms.

Yomi:
Um, uh, well, I'm not.
Um, I just happened to run into her.

Tomo:
All right! I challenge you!

Yomi:
What do you mean?
You lost already!

Tomo:
It's okay.
You always gotta do three rounds for these kind of things, Yomi.

Yomi:
Is that so?

Tomo:
Here, you take this end.

Yomi:
Okay, okay, fine.

Tomo:
Osaka, hold that end!

Osaka:
What are we singin'?

Yomi:
Whatever Chiyo-chan knows.

Tomo:
Master Chiyo, I challenge you!

Chiyo:
I accept your challenge!


Chiyo:
At night, I get sleepy very quickly.
When I hear everyone talking about late night TV or radio, I envy them a little.
Late nights are no problem once you grow older.
I can't wait to be a grownup.
Mr. Tadakichi, have a good night.

Tomo:
Ahahaha...

Osaka:
Ha...

Kagura:
Hahaha...
Oh...

Chiyo:
Well... Good night.


-- Preview --

Oksaka:
Our version of the great lord of terror is approachin'.
And that is...

Tomo:
Tests! It's tests! Whoa, scary!

Kagura:
Don't worry!
If we work together, there is no summit or summary we can't make.

Osaka:
That's right.
We gotta all work hard together!

Kagura:
Okay! Everyone, fall in step! Here goes!

Knuckleheads:
Tell us what's gonna be on the tests!

Yomi:
Idiots.
