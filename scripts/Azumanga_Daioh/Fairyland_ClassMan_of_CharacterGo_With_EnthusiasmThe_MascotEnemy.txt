 Chiyo:
 During today's homeroom hour, I would like to decide what we should do for the culture fest.
 Does anybody have any ideas they'd like to share with us?

Student:
How about a haunted house?

Chiyo:
 Okay.

Tomo:
 Okay.
 That's one haunted house.
 Got it.

Chiyo:
 So any other ideas?

Chihiro:
I know.
How about a cafe?

Chiyo:
 Okay.

Tomo:
 All right, cafe.

Chiyo:
 Well, does anyone else have an idea?
 Any more ideas besides a haunted house or a cafe?
 The vote's still open.

Tomo:
 Ugh...

Chiyo:
 Hm?

Tomo:
 Horizontal or vertical...
 I... I... I don't know?
 What's the first stroke?

Chiyo:
 Oh.
 Like this.

Chiyo:
 If no one has any more ideas, we will take a vote now, okay?
 You can vote for either the cafe or the haunted...

Yukari:
 No, no.
 Going with the standard and orthodox is the death of intellect, Chiyo.
 Why not try something out of the ordinary?
 For example, you could... Uh... Um...
 A cafe is a great idea.

Osaka:
 A comment box...

Yomi:
I'm hoping that maybe we'll get some different project ideas by putting the box up.

Osaka:
 Different project ideas...
 How about just our class setting things up for our very own personal sports fest?

Yomi:
 Did you hear what you just said?

Tomo:
 Ah, looky here!
 The comment box is hungry!

Yomi:
 Why don't you stop admiring it and put something in?

Tomo:
 Um...

Yomi:
 Huh?
 Hold on!
 What did you just put in there?

Tomo:
Five yen.

Yomi:
 You're supposed to put in project ideas.

Tomo:
 According to the legend of this comment box...

Yomi:
 It doesn't have a legend!

Chiyo:
 All right then, now, I would like to discuss our project for the culture fest one more time.
 First, we take a look inside the comment box.

Chiyo:
 Oh...
 Is nothing else in here?
 Ah! A piece of paper.

Tomo:
 Hm?

Chiyo:
 Let's see...
 Oh, this idea might be a really good one.
 It says, "A Stuffed Animal Exhibit."
 "We can put on an exhibit by collecting all the stuffed animals that everyone has and bringing them to school."
 "I think this would make the stuffed animals happy as well because they will get to make lots of new friends."
 And now you have it.
 How does that sound?

Students:
That sounds like a great idea.
That's so cute.
That would be wonderful, wouldn't it?
I can bring ones I won at arcades.

Kaorin:
Hey, hey, who's the one who came up with the idea?

Chiyo:
 Let's see...
 The person wishes to remain anonymous.

Osaka:
 Hey, I know, how 'bout we make some fanciful uniforms and wear 'em at the culture fest?

Kimura:
As a matter of fact, I have a suggestion concerning the very issue.
The key here is the fluffy...

Tomo:
 No, thank you!

Chiyo:
 We should make a class mascot as well.

Yomi:
 How about one big enough to wear?

Tomo:
 Good! Good idea!
 Let's get together at Chiyo-chan's place and make it!

Kimura:
Oh, also, as you can see, there is this foamy part.
What, that's not the least of it. Furthermore...

Yukari:
 Okay, Mr. Kimura, you can leave now!

Kimura:
Wait, please, wait a minute!
Just! Just listen to me for one minute! And I think... Ah!
 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:2:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Kaorin:
Okay, all set.

Osaka:
 You sure my size will fit everybody?

Yomi:
 Trust me, it'll be fine.

Chiyo:
 I'm going to the store because we're out of juice, okay?

Kaorin:
Sorry for the trouble.

Yomi:
 Thank you, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
 Come on, Mr. Tadakichi, it's time to go.

Chiyo:
 Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
 Ah, oh...

Chiyo:
 Everyone's been waiting a while for you.

Sakaki:
 Oh, sorry I was late, Chiyo.
 I picked this up.

Chiyo:
 Oh, did you bring us juice?
 I was just on my way to get some from the store.
 Thank you so much, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
 Hm.

Chiyo:
 Huh?
 Oh!
 My friend here is Mr. Tadakichi.

Sakaki:
 Mr. Tadakichi?

Chiyo:
 Uh-huh, he's our family's pet dog.

Sakaki:
 Is... is it okay for me to pet him?

Chiyo:
 Of course!
 Mr. Tadakichi is a man of character, so he never gets angry.

Sakaki:
 But he's so big, if he did bite it, it'd be no laughing matter.

Chiyo:
 Oh, he's perfectly safe.

 It's all right, you can go ahead.

 Maybe... we should head back.

Sakaki:
Oh, right.

Sakaki:
 Although, with him being so big, you could almost ride him.

Chiyo:
 Oh, well, actually I can!
 See?

Sakaki:
 Ah, oh...

Chiyo:
 Come on, everyone's waiting, so let's get back.

Sakaki:
 O...okay.
 So lucky...
 Mr. Tadakichi...
 So lucky...

 Nyamo:
 Well, culture fest season has come once again.
 Been a while since ours, but it sure brings back memories, huh?

Yukari:
 Hm... Hahaha.

Nyamo:
 You don't remember?
 At all?

Chiyo:
 We had a good turnout.

Chihiro:
Okay, everyone, I need you to put these on.

Kaorin:
Miss Sakaki, you look wonderful.

Sakaki:
 You... you think so?

Chiyo:
 Uh-huh.
 It suits you quite nicely.

Osaka:
 Hey, how do I look?

Chihiro:
Wow, it's really cute!

Chiyo:
 It's incredible!

Tomo:
 I don't know!
 Well, it's not like it's bad or anything...
 But I just don't think you're wearing it that well.

Osaka:
 Wearin' it well?

Tomo:
 C'mon, let's switch.

Osaka:
 Here you go, Tomo.

Tomo:
 Got it.

Tomo:
 All right, now here I go!
 Off, off, off and away 
Whee!

Student:
What the?!

Nyamo:
 Good morning.
 Huh?

 What?
 What was that?

Yomi:
 Hm?
 What the...?
 Is that...? What tha...? What the...? Is that...? What? What? What?!

Tomo:
 Hey, I'm back.
 Hah...
 I'm so tired.

Chiyo:
 Where did you go, Tomo?

Tomo:
 Advertising.
 I was sprinkling cuteness all over school.

Yomi:
 Tough to top of the nice heavy dash of scary.

Tomo:
 Ehe.

Student:
Come see the swim team!
We have all kinds of drinks for sale!
You know you're thirsty.

Nyamo:
 All right, good work.

Student:
Oh, Miss Kurosawa.

Nyamo:
 Tell me, how's it holding up?

Student:
Um, well, the thing is...

Nyamo:
 Huh?

Kimura:
What is going on here?

Kagura:
 Going on?
 What do you mean?

Kimura:
This is inexcusable!

Nyamo:
 Something wrong?

Kagura:
 Yeah, this guy...

Kimura:
Oh, Miss Kurosawa, I'm so glad you are here.

Nyamo:
 Okay.

Kimura:
Please talk to your girls, Miss Kurosawa.
I mean, don't you find it rather odd?
This is a swim team's booth and no one's in a swimsuit!

Kagura, Nyamo:
 Um...

Kimura:
Okay, I'll let the swimsuits go.

Nyamo:
 Yes, sir.

Kimura:
I think I would like a glass of pool water.

Kagura:
 Sir?

Kimura:
Pool water!
As the water from the pool that you girls were swimming in!

Kagura:
 What?
 We don't have any of that!

Kimura:
Uh...

Nyamo:
 Uh...

 The Mascot


Osaka:
 Welcome to fairyland!
 Come over and take a look!

Osaka:
 Welcome to fairyland!

Woman:
Wow, they're adorable!
Huh?
Um, excuse me, but what are these things?

Sakaki:
 That one there is a dog and that one's a cat.
 Or is it the other way around?

Woman:
Um... so then, this would be...

Osaka:
 That would be Tsutenkaku tower.

Woman:
Tsutenkaku...

Osaka:
 That's right.

Woman:
Then what's the small one in the corner?

Osaka:
 Oh, that's Hanshin.

Woman:
Uh... Hanshin?

Osaka:
 That's right.

Woman:
Uh...

Osaka:
 Hanshin.


Kaorin:
Welcome!
It's the Fairyland Class!
Welcome!

Chiyo:
 Sorry for making you wait.
 It's time for the next person's turn.

Kaorin:
Okay.
Hm, oh...
It really is hot inside this thing.

Yomi:
 Good job, Kaorin.

Kaorin:
Oh, thank you.

Yomi:
 Well, then, I guess it's my turn.

Chiyo:
 Oh, may I try wearing the costume too?

Kaorin:
All right, you and me trade.

Chiyo:
 Okay!

Chiyo:
 Uh.. uh... uh..

Kaorin:
It's... it's kinda scary.

Yomi:
 Oh, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
 What is it?

Yomi, Kaorin:
 Ah!

Chiyo:
 Did someone call me?

Yomi, Kaorin:
 Ahhh!

Chiyo:
 Uh.. uh... uh..

Yomi, Kaorin:
 Ahhhhhh!

Student:
Oh, wow, it's cute and weird at the same time

Student2:
You're right about the weird part.

Student:
Excuse me, I'd like this one.

Sakaki:
 Okay.
 Huh?

Sakaki:
 You... you wanna buy it?

Student:
Uh-huh.

Sakaki:
 You want just the one?

Student:
Yeah, this one.

Sakaki:
Won't you take the cat with you as well?

Student:
Huh?

Sakaki:
 No way... the dog?

Sakaki:
 I wish you happiness.

Chiyo:
 Oh, hi, Miss Sakaki.
 I'm sorry, but would you please take a quick picture for me?

Sakaki:
 Okay, sure thing.

Chiyo:
 Okay, thank you.

Sakaki:
 Mm-hm.
 Okay, Chiyo, say cheese.

Chiyo:
 Thank you very much, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
 Oh, since we're...

Chiyo:
 Huh?

Sakaki:
 Since we're here, could I also...

Chiyo:
 Oh, yeah, of course you can!
 Is everybody ready then? Okay, say cheese.

Chiyo:
 Okay, I got a photo.

Sakaki:
 Thank you, Chiyo.

Chiyo:
 Come to think of it, do you have any idea who's in the costume right now?

Sakaki:
 Hm?

Kimura:
Hello.

Sakaki:
 It's not true!

Chiyo:
 Ah, Miss Sakaki!

 Osaka:
 Welcome to fairyland!
 Welcome to fairyland!
Nyamo:
 Now that I think of it, that culture fest we had back when we were in high school, didn't we...

Nyamo:
 Have you finally remembered?

Yukari:
 <French> Au de cafe <French>.

Nyamo:
 You see that, you do remember.

Yukari:
 Uh, I got it right.

Nyamo:
 Dummy, it's not like this is some kind of quiz.

Yukari:
 I don't remember what my students did last year, let alone what I did way back then.

Nyamo:
 Don't brag about it.
 It's depressing.

Yukari:
 Do not be a slave to your past!
 You must live in here, the now, this moment!

Nyamo:
 Don't go getting drunk on orange juice.

Yukari:
 Drunk on youth!

Nyamo:
 Yeah, whatever.


Sakaki:
 Ah!
 Hey, you know what?
 I made that kitty myself.

Child:
Huh?

Sakaki:
 If you want, you can have it.

Child:
Um...
I don't want it.


Chiyo:
 All right, everyone, let's have a toast with juice to celebrate the successful completion of the culture fest!

Tomo:
 Here, here!

Everyone:
Here, here!

Yukari:
 Good job, people!
 Yes, great work, everyone!
 Now... let's take... these stuffed animals... and burn them all!

Everyone:
Huh?

Yukari:
What?
You're not gonna burn the animals as a memorial?

Yomi:
 Memorial for what?

Tomo:
 It looks like we had quite a few visitors.

Chiyo:
 Uh-huh, we got a lot of surveys back too.
 Plus we sold a bunch of stuffed animals.

Osaka:
 No doubt about it.
 The stuffed animal exhibit was a huge hit.

Tomo:
 Something wrong?
 What's up with that sigh there ,Yomi?

Chiyo:
 Are you really tired?

Yomi:
 Oh, no, it's the end of the day.
 Um, well, I sorta felt a twinge of sadness, you know.

Osaka:
 I know what you mean.
 I wish tomorrow was a culture fest.

Yomi:
 I somehow don't think that would be possible, though.

Tomo:
 All right, let's have a victory parade!

Osaka:
 Yeah!

Chiyo:
 Uh...

Yomi:
 What's the victory?


Chiyo:
 Uh... Mr. Tadakichi...


-- Preview --

Chiyo:
The next Azumanga Daioh is all about New Year's dreams.
I wonder what kind of dreams everyone is having?
I like dreams where there's hopping and jumping for joy.
I hope I'll get to have a happy dream.
What? Something red?
