 Chiyo:
 Let's see...
 Oh, Um... There's nothing I need to bring today.

 I'm heading out!
 Mr. Tadakichi, good morning.
 Hey, you know what?
 Today is the graduation ceremony.
 This will be the first time I've ever graduated.
 Okay, I'll see you later.

Sakaki:
 Oh.
 I'm sorry for always trying to pet you against your will.

Kamineko:
Meow!

Sakaki:
 Huh?
 Well, okay... May I pet you then?
 Ow...

Chiyo:
 Good morning, everybody!

Tomo:
 Whoa!
 "Female College Graduate Employment Rate At An All Time Low!" it says.
 You know, at this rate, it might be useless even if you do get in.

Yomi:
 I am getting in!

Tomo:
 Okay, I admit I heard this from the cafeteria lady, but she said if you go to college, your marrying age gets pushed back!
 Great news, how's Yomi?

Yomi:
 I said, I'm getting in, damn it!

Osaka:
 Mornin', Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
 Miss Osaka, good morni...
 What do you have there? Some tissues?

Osaka:
 Ah-ah, they aren't ordinary tissues.
 These ones are high class for real.

Chiyo:
 I see. So, why do you have them?

Osaka:
 I'll reveal the secret.
 And there ya have it.

Chiyo:
 Ah! Oh, you have hay fever?

Osaka:
 That's right, hay fever.
 But I'm covered.
 I've got eye drops too.
 Although I'm one of those people who can't apply 'em unless I lie down.

Kagura:
 So, what are you doing?

Chiyo:
 Miss Osaka is using eye drops...

Kagura:
 Eye drops, huh?

Osaka:
 That's right, I've got hay fever.
 Achoo...

Kagura:
 Huh? Was that a sneeze?
 Ha-ha-ha. That was really great!

Osaka:
 What're you sayin'? There's nothin' great about it.
 Achoo...

Tomo:
 Hay fever looks like fun.

Yomi:
 No, it isn't!

 Announcement:
Those graduating will now enter.
And now, a speech from our principal.

Principal:
To those of you who are graduating, congratulations.
To our guests, to our visiting and to the guardians of the students, we...

Osaka:
 Achoo.

Principal:
We wish to extend our sincere gratitu...

Osaka:
 Achoo.

Principal:
We wish to extend our sincere gratitude to you for coming today.

Student:
What was that?

Student:
No clue.

Principal:
Now, for those of you who are graduating...

Announcement:
Presentation of diploma.
Representing the graduating class, Masaaki Ohyama.

Tomo:
 Hey, why is that that I'm not the one representing the graduating class?

Yomi:
 You have to ask?
 You sure your brain hasn't melted or something?

Tomo:
 Why do I ask? Maybe because I'm the strongest?

Yomi:
 Huh?

Tomo:
 Ha!

Announcement:
And now, to the student who achieved the highest grades this academic year, we'll present the Kinran Award.

Yomi:
 It isn't you. So, sit down.
 I'm telling you. Sit down.

Announcement:
This year's Kinran Award goes to Miss Chiyo Mihama, a Year 3, Class 3!

Yomi:
 Like I SAID, it isn't you!

Announcement:
Miss Chiyo Mihama, please come forward.

Osaka:
 Chiyo-chan, they're callin' you, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
 Huh?
 Are they talking about me?

Principal:
Excellent work, Miss Chiyo Mihama.

Chiyo:
 Yes, sir!

Tomo:
 Bravo!
 Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

Student:
Should we stand?

Student:
Dunno.

Everyone:
♪あおげばとおとし(よく分からんところが多いので、後回し)

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:4:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Tomo:
 Hm?

Chiyo:
 Mi... Miss Yukari!

Yukari:
 I lost my wallet!

Chiyo:
 What?

Yukari:
 Oh, I don't care anymore.
 Presenting the diplomas...

Tomo:
 Hey, you're wrecking the mood!

Yukari:
 Kagura.

Kagura:
 Yes.

Yukari:
 Osaka.

Osaka:
 Yes.

Yukari:
 Tomo.

Tomo:
 Yeah.

Yukari:
 Argh!
 I don't need your cheap sympathy!

Tomo:
 Hey, that's mean!

Yukari:
 My 10,000 yen bill! My 10,000 yen bill!
 I knew I had one in there!
 Okay, time for final words.
 Well, goodbye, everybody.

Tomo:
 You're wrecking the mood!

Nyamo:
 Um... hey, Miss Tanizaki.

Yukari:
 What is it? Oh, Nyamo.

Nyamo:
 Someone who found this picked it up and turned it in.
 Isn't it yours, Yukari? This wallet.

Yukari:
 Everyone, congratulations on graduating!

Nyamo:
 I'm sorry, everyone.
 Didn't mean to be late.

Students:
Thank you for everything, Miss Kurosawa!

Students:
We've been waiting for you!
Goodbye, Miss Kurosawa!
It was fun!

Nyamo:
 Now, now, it's not over yet.
 There might not be diplomas for everyone here, you know.

Students:
What?!

Kimura:
However, the three years that I have spent together with all of you in my class have been very rewarding and meaningful for me as well.
This wonderful time that we have shared will be ending as of today and...

Kaorin:
Mr. Kimura...

Kimura:
But!
Kaorin and I will be together forever!

Yukari:
 And so, that's all I have to say.
 Everyone, rise!
 Bow!

Kagura:
 Well, Miss Yukari, this is from everyone.

Yukari:
 What a huge bouquet!

Kagura:
 It's one flower from each of us.

Yukari:
 They're wonderful.
 I wonder whose will first wilt and die?!

Everyone:
Uh...

Chiyo:
 Oh, Miss Yukari...

 What did you do that for?!

Yukari:
 I just had to.

Chiyo:
 I guess... I guess high school really is over now, isn't it?

Yukari:
 Well, yeah.

Chiyo:
 We won't get to see each other every day anymore, will we?

Tomo:
 Hey, wait!
 Hey! Hey!

Osaka:
 Ow! Ow!

Yukari:
 Well, when all's said and done, that's all there is to it.
 You guys should be just fine, but no guarantees.

Chiyo:
 Huh?

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:6:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Tomo:
 You ready?

Osaka:
 Uh.

Tomo:
 Okay, now let's do one more!

Kaorin:
Miss Sakaki... right!
Uh... Miss Sakaki, how about we take a picture together?!

Sakaki:
 Mm.

Kaorin:
Tomo, take a picture of us too!

Tomo:
 Sure! That'll be 1,000 yen.

Kaorin:
Uh...

Tomo:
 No, I was just joking.

 Is everybody ready?
 There, got it!

Kaorin:
No, you don't! Got it! You tilted the camera down!

Tomo:
 Okay, fine, whatever.

Kaorin:
Take it right!

Tomo:
 Here goes.

Kaorin:
Send me that when you get it developed, okay?

Tomo:
 Yeah, yeah.
 Hey, Osaka!

Kaorin:
Are you listening to me?!
Please send it!
Postage due is fine.

Tomo:
 O-Okay...

Yukari:
 Hm? Hey, Kagura, what's wrong?

Kagura:
 Miss Yukari.

Yukari:
 What's up? You forget something?

Kagura:
 Say, Miss Yukari,
 I've been thinking, would it... be bad if I took a chair or desk home?

Yukari:
 Yeah, it would be bad.

Kagura:
 I was thinking of taking something back as a keepsake, but, oh well...

Yukari:
 Hm? Well, don't worry, you're already taking something back with you.

Kagura:
 Uh...

Yukari:
 That's right. Your precious memories of everyone.

Kagura:
 Oh... Thank you, Miss Yukari!

Yukari:
 What? Okay?

Chiyo:
 Then, for our graduation trip, why don't we all go to Magical Land.
 Since Miss Yomi couldn't come last time.

Yomi:
 O-Okay.

Tomo:
 We'll do it before Yomi's school makes a posting.

Chiyo:
 What?

Tomo:
 'Cause it'd be a real downer if she doesn't make it in.

Yomi:
 I am getting in! We'll do it after!

Tomo:
 Yeah, you're right! You'll get in.
 You've just gotta believe it.

Yomi:
 Ah! You piss me off so much!

Osaka:
 That's right, you know.
 It'd be great if Yomi gets in too.

Yomi:
Huh?

Osaka:
 Lemme see the charm that Chiyo-chan gave you for a sec.
 You have it, right?

Yomi:
 Yeah. Here.
 Wh-What are you gonna do?

Osaka:
 Yah!

Yomi:
 Uh... What are you doing?

Osaka:
 I'm puttin' my powers into it.

Yomi:
 That's unnecessary!

Yukari:
 Huh? What's the holdup? Hurry up and go home already.

Tomo:
 Okay.

Sakaki:
 All right then. Shall we go?

Chiyo:
 Yes.

Yukari:
 See ya. Be careful on your way home.

Tomo:
 You, too, Yukari.

Yukari:
 Sure thing!

Tomo:
 Let's do another trip this summer!

Yukari:
 Sure, if I feel like it.
 See you guys around.

Chiyo:
 Ah, Oh, right.

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:8:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Yomi:
 Hm, 3661, huh?
 Okay, but I can't really say whether this number is lucky or not.

Osaka:
 Sure turned out to be a nice day.

Chiyo:
 It certainly has.

Tomo:
 Do you think this one's open today?

Kagura:
 This looks like fun too.

Tomo:
 Oh, yeah, what about that one?

Osaka:
 Chiyo-chan, are you excited?

Chiyo:
 Yes! Let's ride that big roller coaster we rode on last time!

Tomo:
 All right!

Osaka:
 Y'all are brave.

Yomi:
 Hey!

Tomo:
 Oh, Yomi, didn't know you were here.

Yomi:
 So you were serious about going to Magical Land immediately after the announcement was made?!

Kagura:
 We didn't have a choice.
 This is the only time that worked for everyone.

Tomo:
 Don't worry, we've already thought of what to say to comfort you.
 Right?

Osaka:
 Oh, yeah, did you make sure to bring that good luck charm?

Yomi:
 Yeah.

Osaka:
 Lemme see it for a sec.
 I'll put my power into it one last time...

Yomi:
 Chiyo-chan, please imbue this with the power that got even Tomo into college!

Chiyo:
 Yes!

Tomo:
 Yomi, I looked but I didn't see your number.

Yomi:
 No!
 She's still in the middle of imbuing it with her power!
 You weren't supposed to...
 You weren't supposed to look!

 Huh? What's the...?
 It's there.

 It's there!
 It's there, it's there!
 It's there!
 It's there! It's there! It's there!

Chiyo:
 Congratulations! Miss Yomi!

Osaka:
 Happy day!

Kagura:
 Good job, Yomi!

Sakaki:
 I knew it.

Yomi:
 Thank you so much.
 Thank you, everyone.

Tomo:
 Yomi!
 You did awesome!
 Argh...

Kagura:
 Let's hoist her!

Tomo:
 Good idea!

Yomi:
 Tha-That's okay.

Tomo:
 Yeah!

Tomo:
 No! Yomi's too heavy, so let's do Chiyo-chan!

Yomi, Chiyo:
 What?!

Everyone:
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!

Tomo:
 Okay, who's ready to have some fun now?!

Chiyo:
 Won't this be great, Miss Sakaki?

Sakaki:
 Yeah.

Kagura:
 We're gonna have fun today!

Tomo:
 Off we go!

Osaka:
 Hey, wait! How're we gettin' there?

Kagura:
 We've gotta head to the train station first, right?
 Hey, Sakaki, let's have a race to the station?

Sakaki:
 No, I... uh...

Yomi:
 I think I'm gonna ride a roller coaster first thing.

Tomo:
 Oh? You'll probably pee your pants, Yomi.

Yomi:
 I'll be fine.

Tomo:
 Sure if you say so?

Kagura:
 Hey, I heard they've built a brand-new ride.

Everyone:
Yeah.

Osaka:
 Ain't it supposed to be scary though?

Tomo:
 Woohoo!

Kagura:
 All right, we're riding that one!

Tomo:
Is it really that scary?

Chiyo:
 I see...
 Even when we've graduated... we'll still be together.

Osaka:
 Chiyo-chan!
 Come on, Chiyo-chan! It's time to go.

Chiyo:
 Okay!
