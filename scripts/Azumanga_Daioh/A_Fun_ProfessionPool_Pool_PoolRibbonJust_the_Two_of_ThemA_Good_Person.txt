Kimura:
Okay, what does this mean
"on a great road, sheep are lost at the forks."
"Forks" refer to forks in the road.
"On a large road, there are always several forks,
and therefore you lose sight of the sheep that escaped."

Osaka:
 Oh, I was wrong.

Kimura:
Basically, it's saying, there are many forks in the road of life
and it's very easy to get lost down one of them even if you don't mean to.
Thus, living your life by setting goals for yourself is the lesson of the proverb for today.
It is important for each of you to give some serious thought to the career paths you would like to follow.

Tomo:
 Question!
 Mr. Kimura, why did you decide to become a high school teacher?

Kimura:
'Cause I like high school girls, that's why!!

Tomo:
 Hey, what was up with Kimura just now?

Yomi:
 Yeah, how could he be so blunt like that?

Students:
No!

Student1:
We boys were very moved by Mr. Kimura!
He responded to us students with such whole-hearted honesty!

Yomi:
 Yeah, no doubt.

Osaka:
 It could turn into a real problem if we got more teachers like Mr. Kimura working here.

Tomo:
 Having one is enough of a problem already.

Osaka:
 Oh...

Yomi:
 That's very true.
 In fact, I'm surprised there hasn't been any trouble so far.

Tomo:
 Maybe the school's involved in some kind of huge cover-up.

Osaka:
 A suspense story, huh?

Yomi:
 I don't think that's quite it.

Chiyo:
 Excuse me, next hour is swimming.
 If we don't go and get changed soon, then we'll be late.

Chiyo:
 That's right.
 I asked Miss Kurosawa if she could specially order it for me and she did.

Yomi:
 Really?
 How nice.

Tomo:
 Ha, I'm already wearing mine under my uniform.

Yomi:
 Oh, really?
 How very grade school of you.

Osaka:
 Oh, My!

Sakaki:
 Hm?

Osaka:
 An American!
 There's an American among us!
 Wow...

Tomo:
 Ooh, she is right!
 I can't believe you were in middle school just a year ago.

Sakaki:
 ...

Tomo:
 Yeah, what?

Osaka:
 You're Japanese.

Tomo:
 What was that?
 Well, yeah, I am Japanese, but I find it hard to accept that.

Osaka:
 Nothin' wrong with bein' Japanese.

Tomo:
 Um, okay, what about Yomi?

Osaka:
 Um... Hawaii.

Tomo:
 Hawaii?

Yomi:
 Yeah, it's part of America.
 Well, okay, we can split it up into three categories.
 First, we have Miss Sakaki's group.

Tomo, Osaka:
 Uh-huh.

Yomi:
 Then, there's Kaorin and Chihiro's group.

Kaorin, Chihiro:
Huh?

Tomo, Osaka:
 Uh-huh.

Osaka:
 Is that where we will fall?

Yomi:
 If anything, you would be...
 in Chiyo-chan's group.

Tomo:
 What?!

Chiyo:
 Can I help you?

Osaka:
 Chiyo-chan, let's work real hard.

Yomi:
 Well, all things considered,
 Chiyo-chan will probably be in your group for only a couple more years.

Osaka:
 Oh, no way.

Kaorin:
That's right.
Who knows?
You just might turn out to be like Miss Sakaki.

Tomo, Osaka:
 What?!

Chiyo:
 What is it? What is it, you guys, huh?!
 Tell me!

Osaka:
 You traitor!

Chiyo:
 Huh?

Tomo:
 That's right, you big traitor!

Osaka:
 Traitor!...

Tomo:
 Traitor!...


Yomi:
 That's enough already.
 We're leaving you behind.

Yomi:
 Argh!

Kimura:
So, how'd it go?

Yomi:
 Huh?
 How... how did what go?

Kimura:
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, diiiiiiiiing!

Yomi:
 What the heck was that?

Sakaki:
 A bell?

Yomi:
 Like when you get the right answer on a game show?
 I don't get it.

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:2:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Tomo:
 Oh, yeah, play hard, study hard!
 There's nothing like relaxing in the pool after studying your butt off.

Yomi:
 Except you haven't actually studied.

Tomo:
 Shut up, that has nothing to do with it.

Nyamo:
 Okay, everyone, line up!

Nyamo:
 Looks like everyone's here.
 So we can now...

Kimura:
...now go straight to the gym and play some basketball.

Nyamo:
 Ah!

Kimura:
Oh, but it would be better if you were wet...
Shoot, what to do?

Nyamo:
 Excuse me, Mr. Kimura, and...

Kimura:
I got it!
Let's take a little dip first, then we... we can go to the gym, okay?

Nyamo:
 Not a chance!

Kimura:
Would volleyball be better?

Osaka:
 Excuse me.

Everyone:
Huh?

Osaka:
 Do you think that maybe we could play water polo?

Kimura:
Um... great.
But what does that leave me?

Nyamo:
 Mr. Kimura, what about your class?

Kimura:
I had Mr. Gotoh substitute for me.

Nyamo:
 You went that far...
 Fine, I don't care if you want to observe, just please be quiet.

Kimura:
I understand.
It is the first day after all.

Nyamo:
 Huh? What? The first day?
 You mean, you plan to keep coming?

Chihiro:
One, two, three, four!

Everyone:
Five, six, seven, eight!

Chihiro:
One, two, three, four!

Everyone:
Five, six, seven, eight!

Chihiro:
One, two, three, four!

Everyone:
Five, six, seven, eight!

Chihiro:
One, two, three, four!

Everyone:
Five, six, seven, eight!

Chihiro:
One, two, three, four!

Everyone:
Five, six, seven, eight!

Chihiro:
Next! Stretching!

Tomo:
 Yah...

Yomi:
 What?
 Don't tell me that's your limit, Osaka.

Osaka:
 Mm-hm.

Yomi:
 You've got some really stiff joints, you know that?
 This is how you're supposed to stretch.

Osaka:
 Octopus!

Tomo:
 Uh-huh.
 Yomi's crazy flexible 'cause her body's made of almost nothing but fat!

Yomi:
 Double Chop!
 Quit being so damn rude!

Tomo:
 But it's the truth!

Yomi:
 It is not true!

Tomo:
 Jiggle, jiggle.

Yomi:
Cut it out!

Tomo:
 Hey, you made a jiggling noise!

Yomi:
 You better shut up!

Nyamo:
 Come on, you two, quit goofing off and do your stretches!

Kimura:
Several of the water pipes that run through my house have been leaking quite a bit lately.

Nyamo:
 Oh...

Kimura:
The rubber packing has probably grown very brittle and dried out.
It tends to do that when it gets old, you know.

Nyamo:
 Sure, I guess so.

Kimura:
Have you grown brittle and dry?

Nyamo:
 That's it!
 Get out of here!

Nyamo:
 Please go back to your class, Mr. Kimura.
 I am in charge of P.E.

Kimura:
Then you and I should trade classes.
I'll teach P.E. during the summer, and you can teach classical lit!
What do you say, Nyamo?

Nyamo:
 No, thank you.

Kimura:
Uh...

Nyamo:
 All right, let's continue.

Everyone:
Yes, ma'am!

Kimura:
I just wanted to be at the pool...
The damp feeling...

Yomi:
 He's crying.

Tomo:
 Yeah, he's crying for real.
 It's kind of amazing in a way.

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:4:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Nyamo:
 Okay, now! Everyone, get in the water!

Tomo:
 Fire one!

Chiyo:
 Fire two!

Chiyo:
 Thank you for saving me.

Sakaki:
 It's okay.

Yomi:
 I'm guessing you can't swim, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
 Well, I can sort of do a doggy paddle, but...

Osaka:
 Now that you mention it, dogs swim using doggy paddle, right?
 But just what do cats do then?

Tomo:
 Oh, that's easy, they kitty paddle.

Sakaki:
 Uh...
 Kitty paddle...

Osaka:
 If that's the case, then wouldn't it have to be Chiyo-chan paddling for Chiyo-chan?

Tomo:
 Yeah, I see!

Osaka:
 But, Yomi would be Yomi stroke.
 She practices her Kanji even in the pool.

Tomo:
 What?!
 So you're this desperate to get good grades, huh?!

Yomi:
 Moron.

Tomo:
 What did you say?!
 You really wanna study that badly?!

Chiyo:
 Miss Sakaki?

Tomo:
 What's with you?!

Nyamo:
 Hey, you girls keep it down over there!

Yukari:
 Pool, p-pool, p-pool, pool!

Osaka:
 Say, Miss Kurosawa?
 Could you teach me the trick to gettin' faster at freestyle?

Nyamo:
 The trick, huh?
 Well, there's your form and then getting the timing right...

Osaka:
 Oh, hang on.
 First, you better tell me how to float.

Nyamo:
 Huh?

Osaka:
 I just always end up sinking somehow.

Tomo:
 It's called not being able to swim.

Osaka:
 No, I can swim, I just keep on sinking, yep.

Tomo:
 What's with that?
 I mean, seriously, people are lighter than water, so you should float even if you don't do anything at all.

Osaka:
 Really?
 Okay, but if that's true, then nobody would ever drown and die.

Tomo:
 Well, the bodies of drowned people always float.

Osaka:
 Oh.
 I see, I gotta be a dead body.

Chiyo:
 Hey, what's the matter?

Osaka:
 I'm masterin' the secret to floatin' in water.

Chiyo:
 That's amazing!
 Can you tell me how?

Osaka:
 Well, you'll see...

Yukari:
 Like this!

Yukari:
 It's a fact if you start drowning, your body will learn to swim real quick.

Nyamo:
 Huh?

Nyamo:
 Yukari, what happened to your class?!

Yukari:
 Oh, I made it into a study hall.

Nyamo:
 You shouldn't do that!

Yukari:
 Who cares?
 It made the little brats happy.
 But forget that.
 Let's you and me race.
 Teacher versus teacher in a Steak Cup Relay!

Nyamo:
 Oh, C'mon, Yukari.

Yukari:
 Tell me,why is it that we get paid the same, but you get to be at the pool while I'm stuck in the lousy classroom, huh?!

Nyamo:
 Because I am a P.E. teacher and you are a language teacher, remember?

Yukari:
 Then I quit being a language teacher!
 Starting today, I'm a P.E. teacher!

Nyamo:
 Don't be absurd!

Kimura:
Then, let us do this.
Classical lit and language classes, starting today, will be held right here in this pool.

Nyamo:
 Mr. Kimura, do you mind telling me how you got in here?!
 You too for that matter!

Yukari:
 Me? I used an extra key.

Nyamo:
 Extra key?
 Where did you get that?

Yukari:
 It was in your drawer, Nyamo.

Nyamo:
 How dare you go in my drawer!

Kimura:
Also, bikinis should be mandatory attire for all female... students...

Yukari:
 ... I'm collecting my debt!

Nyamo:
 Yukari!
 That was back in high school!

Yukari:
 Yeah, so what?
 It's accumulated a lot of interest!
 Pay up!

Nyamo:
 Yukari!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:6:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Sakaki:
 You okay?

Chiyo:
 Yeah, thanks for all the times you helped me out.

Sakaki:
 Oh.

Osaka:
 But you're amazin', Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
 Why do you say that?

Osaka:
 'Cause you mastered the secret already.

Chiyo:
 What? You really think so?

Osaka:
 Yeah, you're really somethin'.
 But how come you're still alive?

Sakaki:
 There.

Chiyo:
 Huh?


Student:
Come on, Yukari!

Student:
Don't lose, Nyamo!

Student:
Go for it, Yukari!

Student:
Come on, show your best!
You can do it!

Kimura:
Uhh...

Chiyo:
 All right, we'll hereby commence the very first teacher versus teacher's Steak Cup Relay!

Tomo:
 Come on! Kick her ass, Nyamo!

Chihiro:
Score a win, Miss Yukari!

Kaorin:
Go for it!

Chiyo:
 Get ready!
 Go!

Chihiro:
Ow, that hurt.

Yomi:
 She's fast!

Tomo:
 That's our Nyamo!

Yukari:
 Damn P.E. teacher!
 All right then...
 Let's see how she likes this!
 Interference!

Yukari:
 Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
 I got a cramp! I got a cramp in my leg! Argh!

Nyamo:
 Honestly, Yukari!

Yukari:
 Ow, ow, could you be more gentle?

Nyamo:
 You brought it on yourself.
 Deal with it.

Yukari:
 You're hurting me!

Chiyo:
 Miss Yukari and Miss Kurosawa will serve as the anchors and compete one more time, so we'll start over with the second person in line.
 Is everyone clear?

Everyone:
Yes!

Nyamo:
 I should have just left you there.

Yukari:
 Nyamo, you're too soft when you have a chance to make checkmate.
 That's why, when it comes to men...
 Argh!

Chiyo:
 Are you both ready?

Tomo:
 Yeah!

Chiyo:
 Then here we go again!
 Get set!
 Go!

Chiyo:
 All right!
 Let's go!
 All right! Paddle, paddle, paddle!

Osaka:
 Tomo's got a lot of energy.

Chiyo:
 That may be true, but it looks like she's all splash and no speed.

Kagura:
 Ha!

Osaka:
 You can do it!

Yomi:
 Go for it!

Nyamo:
 Go for the gold!

Yukari:
 Go for the steak!

Kaorin:
You can do it, Chiyo!

Tomo:
 Osaka, what are you doing?!

Yukari:
 How about we play fair this time, okay?

Nyamo:
 Look who's talking!

Yukari:
 See ya!

Chiyo:
 Team Miss Kurosawa wins the race.

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:8:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Yomi:
 Hey, is that a book on swimming?

Chiyo:
 Yes. I borrowed it from the library during the lunch break.
 We'll be sure to win the relay race next time!

Yomi:
 I see you were on Team Yukari, huh, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
 Next time, we'll win Miss Yukari her steak dinner for sure.

Yomi:
 Uh, yeah...

Tomo:
 Ha!
 You can try all you want, but we're gonna win no matter what, so there!

Chiyo:
 Oh yeah, like you were a real big part of the victory!
 Why should I listen to you?

Tomo:
 Haha, as long as we win in the end, it doesn't matter!
 Ha ha, loser team, loser team!
 I know it was a Steak Cup Relay Race,
 but I'm gonna let you off if you buy me some soft serve ice cream.
 Hahaha, are you gonna cry? Hahaha...

Yomi:
 What are we, in grade school?


Yukari:
 Man, I don't know what's got into me today.

Kimura:
I'm leaving now, bye.

Nyamo:
 See you tomorrow.

Nyamo:
 Come on, Yukari, ready to go?

Yukari:
 Go where?

Nyamo:
 "Steak Cup Relay Race"? I won, remember?
 You are going to treat me, right?

Yukari:
 No, no, that's not what I meant at all.
 I was simply naming it in honor of all the steak you and I have eaten over the years.
 It's kinda like the Japan Cup that way.

Nyamo:
 You're such a liar...

Yukari:
 Okay, okay, since you insist on being a royal pain, we can bet a steak dinner for the second Steak Cup Relay Race.

Nyamo:
 There's no second time!

Osaka:
 Oh!

Yomi:
 What is it?

Chiyo:
 Oh, it's Mr. Kimura.

Yomi:
 What is he doing there?

Tomo:
 Uh...

Chiyo:
 It seems like he's looking for something.

Tomo:
 Think he lost his wallet or something?

Yomi:
 Or maybe his pet?

Osaka:
 Oh!
 I know, he's probably lookin' for the entrance.

Everyone:
Entrance to what?

Tomo:
 But don't you think it's pretty suspicious?
 It smells like some kind of plot.

Yomi:
 Like what kind?

Tomo:
 Oh, you know... like maybe he buried something under that tree.

Yomi:
 What do you mean?
 Like money?

Tomo:
 Uh-uh, like a body.

Chiyo:
 Um... You, you mean murder?

Tomo:
 Yeah.

Yomi:
 Uh, I see.
 Then, that bag he had on him must be holding the weapon that he committed the crime with.

Tomo:
 Mmm-hmmm.

Osaka:
 It's a real mystery.

Chiyo:
 What?
 But we don't know whether the story is even true or not.

Osaka:
 Chiyo-chan, you better be careful, or you might get buried too.
 We should all be careful and stay on the lookout.

Osaka:
 There goes the suspect, now.

Kimura:
You there.

Man:
Oh! Oh, thank you very much, as always.

Tomo:
 No way!

Osaka:
 That was 10,000 yen.

Kimura:
Oh, hello girls.

Yomi:
 Mr. Kimura, he said, always?

Kimura:
Of course, it's my duty as a teacher.

Osaka:
 Mr. Kimura, what's in that bag you got there?

Kimura:
Oh, these are empty cans.
You should properly dispose of trash in a receptacle.
And you should sort it accordingly.

Everyone:
Huh?

Kimura:
Good-bye.

Everyone:
Oh...

Chiyo:
 You see that?
 Mr. Kimura really did turn out to be a normal person after all.

Yomi:
 Just one of those easily misunderstood types, huh?

Osaka:
 Oh.

Kimura:
Man, what I wouldn't give to watch them changing.

Everyone:
Uhh...

Tomo:
 Misunderstood, huh?

Yomi:
 Let's try not to think too hard about it.


-- Preview --

Osaka:
Durin' summer break, I like to just sleep and do nothin'.
Just sit and space out in a room with air conditionin'.

Chiyo:
Miss Osaka, you should do your homework over the break too!
If you'd like, you can come to our summer home and...

Everyone:
Summer home?!

Osaka:
Next Azumanga Daioh, we'll get to watch me spend just such a day...

Everyone:
Summer home?!

Osaka:
If you tell summer night horror stories, how many stairs does each story have?
