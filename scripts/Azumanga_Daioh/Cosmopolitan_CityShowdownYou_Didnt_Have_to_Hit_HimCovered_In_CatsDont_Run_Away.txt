 Kagura:
 Huh?
 Hey, need any help with your luggage?
 Hey!

 Shoot! He's a foreigner!
 Let's see...
 <Spanish?> El helpo lifto... va moi baggo? <Spanish?>

Foreigner:
Eh?

Kagura:
 <Spanish?> Me word no comprende? <Spanish?>
 <German?> Helfen? Das Help. <German?>
 <Spanish?> Helpa mio! <Spanish?>

Boy:
And then, and then, and then...

Foreigner:
<Spanish> xxxxx, Muchas gracias <Spanish>

Kagura:
 Huh? Um... Yahoo!

Foreigner:
Uh...

Kagura:
 How embarrassing.

Yukari:
 I saw you.

Kagura:
 Ah!

Yukari:
 You did a great job there.
 Yahoo! Yeah.

Kagura:
 I... I wasn't able to tell what language he spoke.

Yukari:
 Well, now, if you'd pay better attention in my class, you could identify and speak with people better.

Kagura:
 What would you have done?

Yukari:
 Well, ah, the perfect target.
 Watch this!

Kagura:
 Oh, no way!

Kagura:
 Hey!

Yukari:
 It's no good! He's German!

Kagura:
 Huh?
 So, you're just gonna run away?!

Kagura:
 So, that's basically what happened yesterday.
 It was pretty rough.

Tomo:
 Hey, your story reminded me of something.

Kagura:
 Oh, yeah, what is that?

Tomo:
 Just how very stupid you are, Kagura.

Kagura:
 Excuse me!

Sakaki:
 Huh?

Tomo:
 I didn't know your conversation skill was so lame.
 I guess your big chest gets in the way.

Kagura:
 My chest has nothing to do with it!
 Bit, you could perform under pressure?

Tomo:
 Better than you did.

Kagura:
 Uh-huh,
 Then, how about if I quiz you!

Tomo:
 Sure, ask me anything.

Kagura:
 What's "I.T." stand for?

Kagura:
 Don't look the other way!

Tomo:
 It's... it's that thingy.
 It's... like e-mail and... homepages and stuff.

Kagura:
 Look, I get the general idea.
 So, tell me what "I.T." stands for?!

Tomo:
 Don't worry about it.

Kagura:
 See?! You can't answer!

Tomo:
 So... so does that mean that you know the answer?

Kagura:
 I'm asking you because I don't know!

Tomo:
 Yomi! You tell her what it stands for!

Yomi:
 Eh...

Yomi:
 In... in...

Kagura, Tomo:
 In...?!

Yomi:
 Interne... um...
 Internet technique...

Kagura, Tomo:
 Ooh, I'm convinced.

Yomi:
 Really?

Chiyo:
 "I.T." is actually short for "Information Technology".
 In Japanese, that phrase would be translated as "jouhou gijutsu".
 But, I don't know if asking about "IT" is such a good test for judging your communication skills.

Kagura:
 Um...

Chiyo:
 Yes?

Kagura:
 Where do you learn about things like that?

Chiyo:
 Huh? Um, well...
 Where... what do you...

 Kagura:
 Morning, Sakaki!

Sakaki:
 Mm.

Kagura:
 So, what I want most right now out of anything is a mountain bike, you know.
 But I'm having a lot of trouble picking out what kind of color and all that stuff.
 What is it?

Sakaki:
 It's blooming.

Kagura:
 Flowers?
 Oh, it's a hibiscus.

Sakaki:
 Pomegranate.

Kagura:
 Man, I totally don't know anything about flowers.
 Sunflowers, morning glories, and that's all.

I know, lilies!

Sakaki:
 No, gardenias.

Kagura:
 Oh, violets!

Sakaki:
 Azaleas.

Kagura:
 Oh, well, who cares about flowers?
 So, anyways, back to that mountain bike.
 Huh?

Sakaki:
Hm?

Kagura:
 Just now, was that... a contest?!

Sakaki:
 What?

Kagura:
 A contest for guessing the names of flowers.

Sakaki:
 No.

Kagura:
 All right.

Kagura:
 So, there are a couple of colors I'm leaning toward right now...

Sakaki:
 Yeah?


Kagura:
 Hey, Sakaki! Let's compete!
 Let's have a competition!
 This time, the event would be speed-eating lunch.

Sakaki:
 Huh?

Kagura:
 Okay, ready, set and go!

 Huh?
 Come on, what're you eating so slow for?

Sakaki:
 You should chew your food thoroughly whenever you're eating, you know.

Kagura:
 Uh...


Nyamo:
 All right, everyone, please split up into teams!

Everyone:
Yes, ma'am!

Kagura:
 Okay, Sakaki
 Time for us to compete in softball!

Kaorin:
 Go for it, Miss Sakaki!

Osaka:
 Hit it outta the park!
 Home run all the way!

 Um...
 How many points is a home run?

Yomi:
 Huh?

Kagura:
 Here it comes, Sakaki!

Kagura:
 Fly ball to the right!

Chiyo:
 I got it! I got it!

Kagura:
 Ah!

Chiyo:
 Aw...

Kagura:
 Chiyo-chan!
 Chiyo-chan!

Sakaki:
 You okay?

Kagura:
 Chiyo-chan, hang in there! Chiyo-chan!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:4:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Tomo:
 All right!
 We're taking physical measurements today!
 I'm going with spirit!

Chihiro:
I wonder why Tomo's always so energetic?

Yomi:
 Beats me.

Tomo:
 My boobs rock!
 3 more centimeters, uuuh... all right!

Chihiro:
I'm happy for you, but saying that in public.

Tomo:
 But, there's still Miss Sakaki out there to be!
 I gotta work hard!

Chihiro:
H-Hey...

Kagura:
 Hm?

Kimura:
So, how'd it go?

Kagura:
 None... none of your business.

Kimura:
Well, I better be getting to my class now.

Osaka:
 Huh?

Tomo:
 Hey, it looks like your turn is coming up.
 Doesn't it just make you nervous?
 After all, what's the one thing you dread preparing for the very most.




Yomi:

I do not prepare for it.

Tomo:
 Hm...
 A sign for skipping breakfast.
 But that's a given.
 Eh?

Kagura:
 Man, this one's really nice.
 Oh, ooh, this one's nice too.

Sakaki:
 Ah...

Kagura:
 I saved up my New Year's allowance and I've done quite a few part time jobs, so I do have the money.
 But it's just that... when it comes down to the buying, decisions are hard to make.
 Like color and the shape of it.
 The ones I think look nice are expensive.
 But I couldn't see myself getting the cheap one.

NecoKoneco:
Meow.

Sakaki:
 Just what are you doing?

Kagura:
 What? Oh, this?

 Hmm... nothing.
 I just felt like it.
 Although, doesn't it look pretty cool?
 Oh, I know.
 I'll make this part more like... this!


Sakaki:
 It's that cat.

Sakaki:
 Ahhhh!

Kagura:
 Hey you!
 You shouldn't bite people!

Kagura:
 Hey, are you okay?

Sakaki:
 Huh?
 Yeah...

Kagura:
 Really? Cats like that need to be disciplined.
 You just gotta hit 'em and make 'em understand.

Sakaki:
 Yeah, but if...

Kagura:
 Huh?

Sakaki:
 They'll listen if you just talk.

Kagura:
 Yeah right, like hell they will.

 Chiyo:
 Oh, Miss Sakaki!
 Are you going somewhere?

Sakaki:
 Yes, I am.

Chiyo:
 Uh... Well, um...
 See you later then.

Sakaki:
 See you later.


Kagura:
 Huh?
 Awesome. She's got some crazy energy.


Kagura:
 Oh, you saw her too?
 Yeah, Sakaki was going all out, she was putting all her energy into it that I've ever seen from her.
 She was... oh,
 Hey, Sakaki.

Chiyo:
 Huh?
 Oh, Miss Sakaki, welcome back from your... Ah!

Sakaki:
 All at once.

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:8:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Sakaki:
 Oh...

Kagura:
 What are you doing, Sakaki?

 Sakaki:
 Aw, aw, aw...

Kagura:
 Wow, so do you like get bitten by cats all the time, or just with me?
 But you know, I wonder if your hand smells like fish or something?

Sakaki:
 Uh.

Kagura:
 Okay, I know!
 I'll shoo away any cat dumb enough to come near you!

Sakaki:
 Uh!

Kagura:
 Hey, there's one!

 Garrr! Garrr! Garrr!
 Haha.

 Garrr!
 Garrr!
 Garrr!
 Garrr! Garrr! Garrr!

Sakaki:
 Hey, stop it...

Kagura:
 Garrr! Garrr!
 Garrr! Garrr!

 What?
 Is something wrong?

Sakaki:
 Oh, well, I um... you see...

Kagura:
 Huh?

Sakaki:
 I can't just keep on... running away.

Kagura:
 Uh...

Sakaki:
 I have to face it, and then overcome it.

Kagura:
 Oh, Sakaki!
 Those were great words!
 You're so right! Mm-hm.

 Oh, there!
 Right, now go, Sakaki!

Sakaki:
 Aw!

Kagura:
 Ah...
 Hiya, are you.... are you all right?

 She's okay with that?


Girl:
Yeah, it was a real surprise for me.

Kaorin:
Huh?

Girl:
What's up?

Kaorin:
Over there.

Miss Sakaki.
Hey, do you like to play games and things too?

Sakaki:
 Ah, yeah.

Kaorin:
So, I guess you play a lot of those one-on-one combat tournament games and high speed racing games, huh?

Sakaki:
 Oh, well, sort of.

Kaorin:
Wow, you're amazing, Miss Sakaki.
I'm totally no good at those.
I'd love it if you'd maybe teach me sometime.

Sakaki:
 Sure.

Kaorin:
Well, until then.

Sakaki:
 Oh.

Yomi:
Next week is a biography of Chiyo-chan.
Through various people's testimonies, we'll take a look at Chiyo-chan's life, full of ups and downs.

Chiyo:
I've still only lived for eleven years, though.

Yomi:
Eleven years is an epoch.
In order to survive such a trying era, you have to face this society with...

Chiyo:
Um, next time, we'll look at a day in my life...

Yomi:
Rome was not built in one day.
The current Japan is...

Chiyo:
Miss Yomi, what's gotten into you?

Yomi:
Please look forward to it!
