 Yukari:
 Your fun summer break will be starting tomorrow!
 So, who's got fun plans? Anyone?

Student:
Me! My family's going to New Zealand.

Yukari:
 Oh my, sounds great.

Kaorin:
Um, I'm going to Astronomy camp.

Yukari:
 Oh my, sounds great.

Chiyo:
 Um... Will you be going on vacation too?

Yukari:
 Why, of course! I'm flying to Neptune.

Yukari:
 Okay, time to pass out report cards!

Student:
Hey, what's up with this stuff?

Yukari:
 All right!
 Those of you who got drills with your report cards will stay here until you finish them! Chop chop!


Sakaki:
 I wonder if he gets hot sitting there with the sun beating down on him.

Yukari:
 Good morning.

Nyamo:
 It's early evening, you know.
 What?
 Have you turned into a night owl since the break started?

Yukari:
 Night owl?


Nyamo:
 I don't believe you.
 Come and sit down here!

Yukari:
 What?

Nyamo:
 I'm telling you to sit!

Yukari:
 Oh, would you just shut up?

Yukari:
 What do you wanna do so early in the morning?

Nyamo:
 I told you, it's early evening!
 Set up a daily schedule!
 You shouldn't be so lazy just because it's summer break!

Yukari:
 What's your deal?
 Are you some kind of school teacher?

Nyamo:
 We both are.

Yukari:
 I can't write anything with you watching me!

Nyamo:
 Fine, fine.

Nyamo:
 Done yet?

Yukari:
 I got it!

Nyamo:
 Show me.

Nyamo:
 What is this?
 You have no drive.

Yukari:
 No, I certainly don't.

Nyamo:
 Summer break is a great opportunity; don't you wanna spend some of your time productively?
 Read a book or plan your lessons for the next semester or something?!

Yukari:
 Jeez, would you put a lid on already... Oh!

Nyamo:
 What is it?

Yukari:
 Let's go have fun somewhere tomorrow!

Nyamo:
 Have fun, huh?

Yukari:
 What the hell is your problem, Nyamo? It's better than being lazy, isn't it?!

Nyamo:
 I can't.

Yukari:
 Oh, you can't.

Nyamo:
 Look, I can't help it.
 I've got swimming tomorrow!

Yukari:
 "I can't help it.
 I've got swimming."
 Swimming?!

Nyamo:
 What?

Yukari:
 The pool, right?! I'm coming with you!

Nyamo:
 It's the school pool!
 I'm the advisor for the swim team.

Yukari:
 Hold on a second.
 The school pool would be free, right?

Nyamo:
 I'm telling you, I'm not going there to have fun!

Yukari:
 What do you want from me?
 It's better than being lazy, isn't it?!
 It's better than that!

Nyamo:
 I can't help it, I'm the teacher.

Yukari:
 I'm a teacher too.

Nyamo:
 Yes, of course you are.

Yukari:
 Hey, I know.

Nyamo:
 You know...
 You still have no motivation.

Yukari:
 Uh... score two for Nyamo...


Yukari:
 You've gotta be in a swimsuit for the summer!
 I'm going for a little more fanservice this year!
 Check it out!
 Two times as much!

Yukari:
 Ta-da!
 Check out my awesome shark!

Kagura:
 Miss Kurosawa, that woman in Lane 8 is in a world by herself.

Nyamo:
 Don't let her bother you.

Kagura:
 But I can't help it. She does bother me.

 Tomo:
 Summer Break Special, Home Inspections!
 We're going to Chiyo-chan's today!
 Yay!

Tomo:
 Hey, hey, where are you going, Yomi?!

Yomi:
 Your shouting in front of the train station is embarrassing.

Tomo:
 Oh, give it a rest.
 Don't be such a stick in the mud.
 You know what they say: "Three makes a rowdy bunch", right?

Yomi:
 Yeah, and I want no part of that.

Osaka:
 Are we a rowdy bunch, Mister?

Tomo:
 Ah! I get it, I get it! Okay?

Osaka:
 So, so I...

Man:
Eh?

Tomo:
 Let's see...
 Summer Break Special, Home Inspections!
 We're going to Chiyo-chan's today!
 Yay!

Tomo:
 Hey, hey, Yomi, where are you going?!

Yomi:
 Your simple presence is killing my ears.

Tomo:
 Hey c'mon, I can't help it. Give me a break.
 So, our presence is a little rowdy, so what?

Yomi:
 Don't be lumping me in the same group as you.

Osaka:
 Hey, Mister, would you say our simple presence is too rowdy for ya?

Tomo:
 Ah! I get it already!
 Once we're at Chiyo-chan's, I'm not gonna let you make copies with me, Osaka.

Osaka:
 Make copies?

Tomo:
 That's right!
 So, we don't wastefully wile away our happy summer break.
 I've made shrewd and daring plans to copy Chiyo-chan's homework!

Yomi:
 Oh, I see. So that's the real reason why...

Tomo:
 Hey!

Osaka:
 Oh, I'm just not shrewd that way.

Tomo:
 Ha! And I'm not gonna let you copy mine!

Yomi:
 I don't want it.

Tomo:
 Why not?!

Yomi:
 I'll do it myself.

Tomo:
 Well, isn't that great, Miss Smarty Pants.
 Must be nice having your figure too.
 Look at me and get carried away with my oh-so-cool summer style.

Osaka:
 But do y'all have boyfriends to show off your style too?

Yomi:
 I'm gonna buy some cake so we have a gift for Chiyo-chan.

Tomo:
 Yay! Cake!
 I can't believe we're having cake!
 Yomi, you're the greatest!

Osaka:
 Cake! Yay!


Everyone:
Wow...

Tomo:
 Hey, shouldn't we be getting there soon?

Yomi:
 Yeah, we're in the right neighborhood for the address.

Tomo:
 Wow... do you think this is really the place?

Yomi:
 The nameplate says it's Chiyo-chan's house.

Osaka:
 Amazin'...

Tomo:
 It won't self-destruct, will it?

Yomi:
 Not likely.

Yomi:
 There's no need to sprint off!

Chiyo:
 Hi!
 Come on in!
 I've been expecting you.

Yomi:
 I-I said there's no need to sprint off!

Tomo:
 Wow, I think maybe we should've splurged and bought 'er a melon.

Yomi:
 I think we'll be okay keeping it simple.

Chiyo:
 Hello and welcome to my home, everybody!
 This is the first time my high school friends are visiting, so I'm very happy!
 Now, please don't be so formal; come on in!

Tomo:
 Um, uh, thank you for having us.

Chiyo:
 We have lots of rooms, but this one is mine!

Tomo:
 Wow!

Osaka:
 It's huge.

Tomo:
 Man, Chiyo-chan, this is one awesome place you got here.

Chiyo:
 Oh, it's not that great.

Yomi:
 Trust me, it's pretty great.

Tomo:
 Well, yeah, it's like you've practically won already.

Chiyo:
 Huh?

Tomo:
 Right, Osaka?

Osaka:
 Huh? Yeah, let's all go have fun somewhere.

Everyone:
Huh?

Yomi:
 If we coulda, then we woulda.

Osaka:
 So, why doncha?

Tomo:
 Ugh... the money...

Yomi:
 Huh...

Chiyo:
 Hey, I know, we can all go to my summer home!
 What do you say?

Yomi, Tomo:
 Su... Summer home?!

Osaka:
 Summer home?


 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:4:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Tomo:
 Summer break special! Home inspections!
 Today we're going to Chiyo-chan's summer home!
 Yay!

Osaka:
 Sure turned out to be a nice day.
 It's a perfect day for goin' to a summer home.

Tomo:
 Well, yeah, maybe it is and maybe it isn't, but...
 Chiyo-chan, you invited Miss Sakaki, right?

Chiyo:
 Yes!
 I saw her at the library, so I asked her.
 Was that wrong?

Tomo:
 What do you think?!
 It's A-Okay! Good job! Yay!

Chiyo:
 Yay!

Tomo:
 However!
 These guys, who invited these guys?!

Yukari:
 Don't call us "these guys"!
 Thanks to us, you're getting car rides!
 Free transportation, kids! Free!

Tomo:
 Okay, sure, that's true, but...

Yukari:
 I see. Miss Takino, you're taking the train, ehhhh?

Tomo:
 What?!
 Yay! Car trip! Car trip! We're goin' on a car trip! Wooo!

Yukari:
 Now that that's settled.
 Let's split up into groups!
 Who wants to go in my car!
 My, I mean my parents' car costs more, FYI!

Osaka:
 Miss Yukari?

Yukari:
 Yeah, what?

Osaka:
 Whatever it might have cost, this car's got dents all over the place.

Yukari:
 Don't worry about it.
 You can't live a full life if all you do is worry.

Osaka:
 But...

Nyamo:
 Well... I guess I'll take three and Yukari'll take two.

Chiyo:
 Excuse me, but Miss Yukari's car looks a lot roomier than yours, so shouldn't she be the one to take three people with her?

Nyamo:
 The fewer fatalities, the better, right?

Everyone:
Aaaaaaaah!!
Rock, paper...

Yukari:
 Wow, that's a nice looking summer home!
 Fresh air and a great location by the seaside!

Yomi:
 I saw everything.

Osaka:
 We, we ain't, we ain't afraid of roller coasters no more.

Tomo:
 Wow! It's the ocean, the ocean, the ocean!
 Yeah, we're at the ocean... Let's go!
 Melon time!

Yomi:
 Yes, melon smashing is a common pastime, but don't we need a stick or a bat or something?

Tomo:
 Huh? Any bats on the ground?! Any bats?! Huh? Huh, huh?

Yomi:
 No...

Osaka:
 Melon smashin', huh?

Chiyo:
 Oh...

Sakaki:
 So, what's up?

Chiyo:
 What do you have to do to get to be big like that?

Tomo:
 Ha, we don't need a bat!
 Spirit all the way!


Osaka:
 So, hemorrhoids...

Sakaki:
 Hm?

Osaka:
 Let's say you're writin' the word "hemorrhoids" in hiragana, you put the dots on the "chi," don't ya?
 Not like you normally do with "shi."

Sakaki:
 Uh, yeah.

Osaka:
 But when I was lookin' it up in the dictionary, I was real surprised 'cause it was written with a dotted "shi."

Sakaki:
 Oh, really?

Osaka:
 You know seals, right?

Sakaki:
 Huh?

Osaka:
 It's "sea" plus "leopard" in kanji.

Sakaki:
 Is... is that a fact?

Osaka:
 I guess they must be pretty ferocious.
 But they look awful cuddly.

Sakaki:
 Oh...
 You're fairly... knowledgeable.

Osaka:
 You think so?

Osaka:
 Speakin' of the sea,
 I think I'd like to ride a dolphin.

Sakaki:
 That'd be nice.

Osaka:
 Wouldn't it?

Osaka:
 Okay, so, you know how we write "dolphins" as "sea pig"?

Sakaki:
 Uh-huh.

Osaka:
 But we use the same character for "pig" in "river pig", and somehow it comes out as "puffer fish", but they live in the sea.

Sakaki:
 Uh-huh.

Yomi:
 What are you two up to?

Osaka:
 Oh, thinkin' about hemorrhoids.

Sakaki:
 No, we weren't!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:6:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Osaka:
 Summer break special.
 How to fully enjoy summer nights.
 It ain't a summer night unless you tell horror stories.

Yomi:
 Well, that may be pretty standard, but do you know any really scary ones?

Osaka:
 No, I don't know any.

Yomi:
 Then, who cares.

Chiyo:
 Oh, that reminds me!
 This is a story about another summer home.

Yomi:
 Oh. Yeah? Yeah? Go on!

Chiyo:
 It seems they had an enormous outbreak of cockroaches one summer.

Yomi:
 Then? Then what?

Chiyo:
 Giant cockroaches crawling everywhere all over the...

Tomo:
 Ya!
 Summer nights are for dirty tales!

Osaka:
 Dirty tales?

Tomo:
 Oh, yeah!
 So, let's take this moment to get the two adults here to tell us stories that we can really learn from!

Yukari:
 Huh?

Tomo:
 Come on, tell us a story from your vast store of adult experiences,
 starting with Miss Yukari!

Yukari:
 Who, me?

Tomo:
 Yup!

Yukari, Nyamo:
 Um...

Chiyo:
 Please, no dirty stories, please no!

Yomi:
 Lay off, they're too stunned to answer.

Tomo:
 We're all waiting on you!

Tomo:
 Yukari, a word!

Yukari:
 Uh... being as a single woman really isn't that bad.

Tomo:
 Huh...
 That doesn't help us at all.

Osaka:
 Hey, Miss Kurosawa, you look popular.

Nyamo:
 Huh?

Tomo:
 Now, please, Miss Kurosawa!
 We're waiting!

Nyamo:
 Um... Well, you see...
 Um... I'm single too, so... I don't have any stories like that.
 Sorry, seems I failed you girls.

Tomo:
 Uh... darn...

Yukari:
 Maybe, but you weren't single last summer, Nyamo.

Tomo:
 What?

Nyamo:
 .....

Chiyo:
 Huh?

Tomo:
 Oh, I think that killed the mood right there.

Osaka:
 Oh, I know.

Tomo:
 Yeah, what's that?
 Horror stories again?

Osaka:
 Sometimes, you get serial killings with this kinda situation in a drama.

Yomi:
 Yeah, that's true.

Osaka:
 First one, then another...
 You think that you haven't seen somebody for a while, but actually...

Tomo:
 Ooh, creepy...
 So, so then what?

Osaka:
 Victim number one would be Tomo.
 Then, one by one, y'all get killed...
 So you see...

Tomo:
 What? See what?

Osaka:
 I am the murderer.

Yomi:
 So, you're the murderer?

Tomo:
 Oh, man, that story was lame.
 Oh, I know!
 I'll tell you what summer nights are for.

Osaka:
 Haha...


Yukari:
 There! There! Go! Go! Go!

Nyamo:
 Oh, yeah. She's excited about them now, since she didn't have to pay for them.

Chiyo:
 You're real good with sparklers, Miss Sakaki.


Sakaki:
 Huh, this place is great.
 I wish we could stay here and didn't have to go home.

Chiyo:
 Oh, yes.
 But...

Sakaki:
 But?

Chiyo:
 I really like to make it home alive.

Sakaki:
 The Yukari-mobile...

Chiyo:
 I'm not good at rock-paper-scissors!


Sakaki:
 And today was the last day of summer break, too.

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:8:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Tomo:
 Good morning!
 Hey, how've you guys been?
 I brought all the photos from our trip over summer break!

Kaorin:
Let me see! Let me see!

Chiyo:
 Me too!

Kaorin:
I really wish I could've come.
If only it hadn't been at the same time as my club's camp.
Then I would've...
Ah... Mi-i-i-i... M... Mi-i-i-iss Sakaki went with you too?!

Tomo:
 Well, yeah.

Kaorin:
Well then, why on earth didn't I go?!

Tomo:
 You said yourself you had camp.

Kaorin:
Huh? Noooooooo!!!

Tomo:
 Oh, that?
 I guess I toss and turn a lot in my sleep.

Kaorin:
But why?!

Tomo:
 Um, no real reason...

Kaorin:
Uh? What's this?

Tomo:
 Oh! That's the Yukari-mobile.

Kaorin:
Ah, so this is it...
I heard you had a rough time, Chiyo-chan.
Chiyo-chan?

Tomo:
 Chiyo!

Chiyo:
 Will you please stop the car?
 Miss Yukari, please stop.
 Please stop.
 Please be more careful...
 I'm sorry.
 Oh, don't. We're going to die.
 Grandpa...
 Look out!
 Mister grandpa!
 Mister grandpa!
 Look out!
 Run away!
 Run away!


Tomo:
 Miss Sakaki, I've got some photos for you.

Sakaki:
 Photos from my very first trip with friends...
 Thanks, Tomo.

Tomo:
 Hey, check that out.
 If you look real close, you can see a ghost face behind you.

Sakaki:
 Oh!

Yomi:
 Oh, you're right.

Chiyo:
 Huh?
 Oh wow, you're so lucky to have a photo like that.

Osaka:
 Huh? Hey, that's my neighbor Mr. Horikoshi from back when I was in Osaka.

 Well, probably.


Yukari:
 That's right.
 Today starts the second semester!
 Let's all make sure we study hard!
 So, summer break is officially over now.
 Did everyone go somewhere and have lots of fun?

Student:
All sorts of stuff happened, so we didn't go anywhere.

Yukari:
 Oh, my. Isn't that just too bad?

Kaorin:
The only thing I did was Astronomy camp.

Yukari:
 Oh, my. Isn't that just too bad?

Yukari:
 All right!
 Listen up now!
 The more fun your summer break was, the worse your summer break hangover it's gonna be.
 Is everyone in class clear on this matter?

Tomo:
 Then you must be in the worst shape of all of us!

Yukari:
 Bingo! Just like you say!
 Oh, man.
 When's winter break again?


-- Preview --

Yukari:
The theme of the next episode of Azumang Daioh is "victory"!
Hold the word "victory" dear to your heart, put your spirit into it and win!

Osaka:
Miss Yukari, you're really into this.
You've got your heart set on this Sports Fest, huh?

Yukari:
When I say win, I mean against Class 5! Nyamo's class!

Yomi:
You wouldn't happen to have your heart set on something more?

Yukari:
If we win, I'll treat you!
