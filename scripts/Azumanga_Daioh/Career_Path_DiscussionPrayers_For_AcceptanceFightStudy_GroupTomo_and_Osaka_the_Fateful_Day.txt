 Tomo:
 You are all working so hard at it.

Yomi:
 You talk as if you were not even a part of it.
 You've got exams too, don't you?

Tomo:
 Ahahaha! No need to worry!
 The truth is I came up with an absolutely splendid idea!

Chiyo:
 Idea?

Tomo:
 Uh-huh, since you're going abroad, you're not taking entrance exams, right?

Chiyo:
 Uh, yeah...

Tomo:
 So, if I go study abroad, I won't have to take entrance exams either!
 I'm the smartest person ever!

Yomi:
 Then, you do that.

Tomo:
 Oh, vocab.
 Huh, here, let me quiz you, guys.

Yomi:
 This is sudden.

Tomo:
 Um... the summer fruit you eat before you go swimming?

Yomi:
 Huh? What the heck is this?

Chiyo:
 Oh, that would have to be watermelon.

Tomo:
 Noooo!
 The answer's persimmon!
 It's for swimming!

Chiyo:
 Ah... Oh!

Tomo:
 I don't know if it's good that you're so impressed...
 Okay, tell me who's always banging up cars?

Chiyo:
 Ah, Miss Yukari?

Tomo:
 Yeah, I know where you're coming from, but no.

Chiyo:
 Someone who works in a scrap-yard?

Tomo:
 Noooo!
 No, it's the dentist!

Chiyo:
 Uh... Ah!

Osaka:
 Oh, hey, whatcha doin'?

Tomo:
 I was quizzing Chiyo-chan about some stuff.

Osaka:
 Really? Like what?

Tomo:
 What kind of bird doesn't get along with police?!

Osaka:
 A rook?

Tomo:
 Oh! So quickly!

Chiyo:
 That was amazing!

Osaka:
 It is?

Tomo:
 Okay, who built Osaka Castle?

Osaka:
 The mason.

Tomo:
 "Nihongo" is Japanese.
 What then is "Eigo"?

Osaka:
 Still Japanese.

Tomo:
 A truck with pumpkins, eggplants and tomatoes hit a sharp turn, what fell off?

Osaka:
 Would it be speed?

Tomo:
 A-Amazing! What is with her?!

Osaka:
 What? Was I right?
 Oh, Chiyo-chan, there's somethin' I wanna discuss.

Chiyo:
 Yes? What is it?

Osaka:
 Tell me, can you think what kind of job I might be suited for?

Chiyo:
 Huh? Hmm, let me think...
 Oh, have you thought about becoming a school teacher?

Osaka:
 Ooh...

Chiyo:
 I bet you would raise students who were flexible thinkers!

Osaka:
 Ah!

Yomi:
 I don't know.

Osaka:
 Miss Yukari.

Yukari:
 Oh, Osaka.
 You're the only one who hasn't turned in your school choice.
 Hurry up and make up your mind, all right?

Osaka:
 Yeah, well, about that...
 See, I'm gonna become a school teacher.

Yukari:
What?! Are you out of your mind?!

Osaka:
 Not really.
 Chiyo-chan said I'd be well suited for it.

Yukari:
 What did you say?!

Osaka:
 Huh?

Yukari:
Look here, Miss Chiyo!
 You think I'm an idiot, don't you?

Yukari:
 You probably think being a teacher is a job even stupid people can do!
 I'm right, aren't I?!
 If being a prodigy is going to your head, I'll be happy to knock that right out!


Osaka:
 Hello!

Tomo:
 Help us study!

Chiyo:
 Miss Sakaki is here too.

Tomo:
 Oh, I didn't know that.

Tomo:
 All right, let's get cracking!

Osaka:
 But this table's dangerous.
 It's like I'm falling asleep.

Chiyo:
 Yeah, you're right.

Osaka:
 Hah!

Chiyo:
 Hm? Uh...

 Like you're falling asleep?

Yomi:
 Hey there!

Kagura:
 Help us study!

Yomi:
 Oh? So are Tomo and the others here?

Chiyo:
 They are.
 They're all studying with Miss Sakaki.

Yomi:
 Studying, huh?

Chiyo:
 Y-Yes...

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:2:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Tomo:
 The New Year!

Everybody:
Happy New Year!
May your new year be blessed.

Yomi:
 A long-sleeved kimono, huh?

Osaka:
 It looks real good on ya.

Chiyo:
 Oh, my. There're so many people.

Osaka:
 Not good. At this rate, all of us are gonna get separated.

Tomo:
 Well, then let's pick our rally points.
 Everyone, if you get lost, meet up at Sakaki!

Yomi:
 Okay, got it!

Kagura:
 Yep, that's a roger!

Sakaki:
 Hmm...

Chiyo:
 You seem rather sleepy today.

Yomi:
 Yep, I was up so late studying I heard the watch night bell sound.

Chiyo:
 Oh, that's right, isn't it?
 I forgot that the center exam is coming up.
 Okay, then, I understand!
 Since I'm not taking exams, I will pray for all of you as well!

Tomo:
 Oh! Imbue my being with your prodigy power so that I too may pass.

Yomi:
 Your being?

Osaka:
 Oh, I better get the money offerin' ready soon.

Yomi:
 Okay, I'm gonna be generous.

Osaka:
 That's a 500 yen coin!
 Oh, I can't let that beat me out!

Yomi:
 No way!
 You're doing paper bills?!

Osaka:
 This is it!

Yomi:
 A ten yen coin, Osaka?
 That's pretty lame. You'll fail at this rate.

Osaka:
 No, you're wrong!
 This coin is the chosen one among ten yen coins!

Yomi:
 It's what?

Tomo:
 Now that you mentioned it, I can almost see it!

Chiyo:
 Why is this coin the chosen one?

Osaka:
 This ten yen coin here always came back no matter which machine I put it in.

Yomi:
 You sure that's a good thing?

Chiyo:
 Finally, our turn is coming up, huh?

Osaka:
 Gonna pray good and proper.

Chiyo:
 May everyone pass their tests together.
 Miss Osaka...

Kagura:
 Hey, let's draw sacred lots!

Tomo:
 Yes, I accept your challenge!

Kagura:
 Number 8!

Tomo:
 Number 15!

Kagura:
 Small blessing!

Tomo:
 Strife!
 What?!

Kagura:
 You mean...

Yomi:
 Bad luck?

Chiyo:
 You... you got bad luck?

Tomo:
 Yeah, bad luck.

Yomi:
 Wow, you're right, Tomo.
 They have those, huh? That's incredible.

Osaka:
 It's just too good to be true.

Tomo:
 Bad luck. Wh-What should I do?
 J-Just what am I supposed to do with this?
 Tie it to a tree?

Chiyo:
 I believe there was someone that I heard if you tie a sacred lot, then it'll become cleansed and bad things will be banished.

Tomo:
 Then, I gotta tie it!

Chiyo:
 But I also heard people say if you tie it, the stuff written on it will come true.

Tomo:
 What?! Am I just doomed?!
 What should I do?! What should I do?!
 Please tell me you're gonna help me here?

Yomi:
 Yeah, you're probably just doomed, Tomo.

Tomo:
 Ah! No way!

Kagura:
 All right, how about we get something to eat on the way home?

Yomi:
 You know there's a really good sweets shop up ahead.

Osaka:
 Ain't ya on a diet, Yomi?

Yomi:
 Actually, a moderate amount of sugar is needed to stimulate the brain.

Kagura:
 We got teachers ahead.

Nyamo:
 Huh?

Yukari:
 Oh, shoot!

Tomo:
 Yukari, New Year's allowance!
 Give us a New Year's money!

Kagura:
 Gimme, gimme!

Osaka:
 Please, Miss Yukari!

Yukari:
 What was that? I can't hear what you're saying!

Tomo:
 Cheapskate!

Kagura:
 Cheapskate!

Osaka:
 Cheapskate!

Yukari:
 What did you call me?!

Tomo:
 Run away!

Chiyo:
 Miss Kurosawa, Happy New Year.
 May your year be blessed.

Nyamo:
 Happy New Year.
 Have you made your first shrine visit yet?

Yomi:
 We did. At the shrine back there.

Yukari:
 Hey, hold on, you guys didn't know?

Tomo:
 Huh? We didn't know what?

Yukari:
 Know that the son of that shrine went and failed to get into college.
 They won't help you.

Everyone:
What?!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:4:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Tomo:
 All right, it's time for the center exam!
 Let's take this chance to do it together and get terrible scores!

Kagura, Yomi:
 Uh...

Tomo:
 We're done for.

Osaka, Kagura:
 Yeah...

Chiyo:
 Uh, you guys...

Osaka:
 Do not worry.
 I'll be teaching ya a good charm.

Tomo:
 A charm, huh?

Yomi:
 They're just chopsticks?

Osaka:
 Did I give one to everybody?
 Then, please listen to me.
 If you can split these neatly, then the test will go well.

Everyone:
Wh-What?!

Kagura:
 Wow, I had no idea. Never heard of this charm before.

Osaka:
 I developed it.

Kagura,Tomo:
 Ah!

Osaka:
 Do not worry. It will work.

Kagura:
 You can't just make charms up!

Osaka:
 Y'all are just too skeptical.
 Look here, I'm gonna show you how to do it.

Everyone:
Uh...

Osaka:
 See now, that didn't count.

Yomi:
 Huh, no good.

Chiyo:
 Hey, um, I've been meaning to mention this for a while.
 With disposable chopsticks, if you hold the ends and split them slowly...
 See? Nice and neat.

Osaka:
 No way?! I-I didn't know there was a trick to it!

 Ah... It's... it's so beautiful... A perfect break...
 If I use this, college will be just...

 Hey, everyone, lemme show you one more time.
 Just like this and...
 Tomo, what'd you do?

Tomo:
 Huh?

Osaka:
 You didn't make a proper split!

Tomo:
 What? Oh...

Osaka:
 Hah, you weren't holding the ends, were ya?

Tomo:
 Nuh-uh?

Osaka:
 We said it. You gotta hold 'em by the ends!
 It's no good! Listen to what people tell ya!
 Argh!

Tomo:
 I... I'm sorry then.
 Hey, why am I being scolded?

Osaka:
 There's no hope. There's no more hope for ya, Tomo.

Tomo:
 What?! No way!

Chiyo:
 Oh, so um...
 Anyway, I brought some good luck charms to hand out to everyone.

Tomo:
 What?

Yomi:
 More charms, again?

Chiyo:
 I thought about buying them on our shrine visit but I ended up making them myself.

Kagura:
 So, these are for us?

Chiyo:
 Correct. I have one charm for each of you.

Yomi:
 Wow.

Chiyo:
 Here, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
 Thanks, Chiyo-chan.

Tomo:
 Wow...

Kagura:
 Here we go. Now this looks like it'll work!

Yomi:
 It's almost time for it.

Tomo:
 Yeah.

Kagura:
 We've done all we can.
 Let's get in there and do our best!

Osaka:
 I agree.

Sakaki:
 Mm.

Chiyo:
 All right, you guys, I'll be praying that all goes well for everybody.

Yomi:
 Well, then, shall we go?!

Tomo:
 Let's go!

Chiyo:
 Um...

Everyone:
Huh?

Chiyo:
 Best of luck!

Everybody:
Ha-ha.

Chiyo:
 Oh, wow, you look like you're tired. So, how did it go? Oh...

Tomo:
 Who cares! It doesn't matter!

Chiyo:
 Ah? Was it really that bad?

Tomo:
 There were a lot of stupid questions where I could only narrow the answer down to two...

Chiyo:
 These questions are kind of boring.
 Miss Yukari's tests are more interesting than this.
 Your intelligence cannot be measured by these problems.
 Please don't let it discourage you!

Tomo:
 Okay.

Osaka:
 Hey, Chiyo-chan,
 Some of the stuff you taught me came up on the test.

Chiyo:
 Oh, how lucky for you.

Osaka:
 Uh-huh, I was lucky.

Tomo:
 Osaka, did you get some tutoring from Chiyo-chan?

Osaka:
 A little on non-school days recently.

Tomo:
 Oh, yeah, so you were perfectly ready, huh?

Osaka:
 Well, it was kinda like what Chiyo-chan just told ya.

Tomo:
 Huh?

Osaka:
 My intelligence simply cannot solve these kinds of problems.

Chiyo, Tomo:
 Uh...

 Chiyo-papa:
Hello there, everymeow.
<Spanish> Como estas? Bien gracious.<Spanish>

Osaka:
 Oh, my god!

Chiyo-papa:
There are some times when I wish I were a bird.

Osaka:
 Wait, whatcha saying things like that for?

Chiyo-papa:
My daughter is flying to America.

Osaka:
 But if you were a bird?

Chiyo-papa:
I am not a bird. Can you not see that I am a cat!
If I were not, what would you say I am?

Osaka:
 Hold on, I know, you look like that American guy.
 You know, like Bill Clinton.

Chiyo-papa:
Oh...

Osaka:
 Oh, no, I'm so sorry!

Chiyo-papa:
Hm? Are you the real cat? The true cat?
I have a cat's tongue and hate hot food.
But what of you? O cat?

Osaka:
 Oh, I've got a cat's tongue too!

Chiyo-papa:
Then I shall yank that tongue right out of your head there!

Osaka:
 What?! Why?!
 Uh...

Yomi:
 Good morning.

Osaka:
 I wasn't sleepin'. I was studyin' honestly.
 Huh? Hang on, this looks just like Chiyo-chan's place.

Yomi:
 Good morning.

Sakaki:
 Uh.

Chiyo:
 Okay, time to take a snack break!
 Today, we have millefeuille.

Kagura:
 Ooh.

Tomo:
 Yes, finally!

Yomi:
 Sugar is necessary to keep your mind working, isn't it?

Osaka:
 Uh-huh.

Yomi:
 So, it should be okay if I eat them, right?

Osaka:
 It's okay.

Chiyo:
 Hello, Miss Sakaki, what are you doing over there?

Sakaki:
 I'm kinda stuck here in this spot.

Chiyo:
 Here, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
 Huh?

Chiyo:
 I brought you a snack.

Sakaki:
 Oh, thanks very much.
 Ah...

Chiyo:
 No, no, there's none for you.

Sakaki:
 Oh. Is he not allowed to have cake then?

Chiyo:
 Uh-uh, we try our best not to feed him sweets or anything like that.

Osaka:
 Oh, that was delicious. Thanks, Chiyo-chan.

Yomi:
 See, you really do need sugar to keep your mind working.

Osaka:
 Yeah, I see.

Yomi:
 Yeah, I was right, I was so right.

Kagura:
 Okay, doing my best on the homestretch!

Tomo:
 But you're not gonna beat me!

Chiyo:
 Hm...

Tomo:
 Huh?
 What's wrong, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
 Oh, I was just thinking that we'll graduate soon.

Kagura:
 Yeah, that's right.
 I completely forgot because of the exams coming up.

Sakaki:
 Hm.

Tomo:
 Well, assuming nothing happens when we do get to graduate.

Yomi:
 You say that so cheerfully.

Chiyo:
 Although, it's already been three years since we all first met.

Kagura:
 I've only been around since the second year, but man, a lot has happened.

Osaka:
 Yeah for real. Three years go by in no time at all.
 Chiyo-chan's grown quite a bit!
 You have.

Chiyo:
 Do you think so?

Osaka:
 Sakaki's breasts've grown too!

Sakaki:
 Uh...

Osaka:
 I've gotten it together much better.
 And Tomo...

Yomi:
 Hey, hey...
 Don't think I'm gonna buy into that!

Chiyo:
 Everyone's individual entrance exams have finally begun.
 All I can do now is pray for my friends.
 Please do your best!

 Nyamo:
 Hey, I hear Kagura is getting her results back today, isn't she.

Yukari:
 Is she, really?

Nyamo:
 That's your answer?
 She's your student, you really should remember these things, you know.

Yukari:
 Yes, ma'am, you're so right.

Kagura:
 Miss Yukari, I made it! I made it in!

Yukari:
 What?!

Nyamo:
 I'm proud of you!

Yukari:
 Yeah, well, I had faith that you'd get accepted, Kagura.

Kagura:
 But you just screamed "What?!", when I told you.

Tomo:
 Incredible! So Kagura made it in?!

Chiyo:
 Congratulations! I'm really glad for you!

Kagura:
 Thanks, Chiyo-chan.
 It's all because of the good luck charm you gave me.

Chiyo:
 Oh, no! It was your own abilities, Miss Kagura!

Tomo:
 So bright!

Kagura:
 Huh?

Tomo:
 You are shining so brightly now!

Kagura:
 So did they not accept you?

Tomo:
 Uh... it was thin.
 The envelope I got was thin and the piece of paper inside it said "No."

Chiyo:
 Don't you worry! We still have the announcement board left, remember?
 Your number will be there!

Tomo:
 Really? You stake your life on it?

Chiyo:
 I sure will!

Kagura:
 What?

Osaka:
 Hey, everyone!

Chiyo:
 Oh, Miss Osaka.

Osaka:
 Okay, well, the results from my first school came back.
 But I haven't looked at it yet.
 Chiyo-chan, you've really been there for me through the exams.
 So I wanted you here for this too.

Chiyo:
 Oh, I see.

Osaka:
 So, what's it gonna be?

Tomo:
 Oh, it's thin!

Osaka, Chiyo:
 Ah!

Kagura:
 Don't be discouraged!
 You still got others, right?!

Osaka:
 But this school, this was supposed to be my safety net.

Kagura:
 Oh.

Chiyo:
 Don't you worry! It'll be just fine!

Osaka:
 For real?

Chiyo:
 I'll stake my life!

Kagura:
 Don't be in such a hurry to die.

Osaka:
 Say, Sakaki, did you get your results?

Sakaki:
 Oh, yeah, I got into the first one.
 But I haven't heard from my main choice.

Osaka:
 Wow, that's really something.
 It's a university for vets, right?

Sakaki:
 That's right.

Osaka:
 Say, veterinarians, do they...

Sakaki:
 Huh?

Osaka:
 Do they take care of beetles as well?

Sakaki:
 What? Well, Um...

Tomo:
 All right, the time has finally arrived!
 The crucial moments!

Osaka:
 Crucial.

Chiyo:
 Mm!

Tomo:
 So, will it be life or death?!

Osaka:
 Death?

Tomo:
 Okay! Before I go look at the announcement board, recharge this with your uncanny exams passing prayer power!

Chiyo:
 Yes, right away!

Chiyo:
 Uuuuum, Yah!
 All right! You should be just fine now!

Tomo:
 O... Okay.

Osaka:
 Oh, oh, do mine too!

Tomo:
 Okay, let's have a look!

Osaka:
 I'm ready.

Chiyo:
 But Miss Yomi tried for two places and both fell through.

Tomo:
 Oh, the book just fell... oops...

Osaka:
 Oh, hey, guess what? The graduation trip...

Tomo:
 Shh! Stop it! We can't talk about it yet!

Osaka:
 Uh...

Tomo:
 Osaka, We're fine, but...

Yomi:
 Yeah, but what?! You have something you wanna say?!

Tomo:
 Hey, don't worry! You'll get into the next one.

Yomi:
 I don't need your sympathy.
 I've still got my main choice left!
 And don't worry. I'm gonna be accepted there.
 Then I'm gonna have lots of fun!
 With everyone!

Chiyo:
 That's right. We'll all go together!

Tomo:
 Definitely. It'll be great if we're all together.

Yomi:
 Somehow, it just doesn't sound right when you say it!
 So, what if I'm the only one who hasn't gotten in.
 Ha-ha-ha.

Tomo:
 Yomi's, Yomi's a goner!

Chiyo:
 Please hang in there!


-- Preview --

Yukari:
Okay, it's the end, the end!
Good riddance.

Tomo:
What?
What do you mean, the end?!
Are you saying it's the final episode?!

Yukari:
Yeah, you guys are graduating, remember?

Tomo:
So once we graduate, that's gonna be it for the show?!

Osaka:
We're gonna die after that?

Yukari:
Don't worry.
All of you will continue to live on forever in everyone's hearts.

Everyone:
Miss Yukari!
