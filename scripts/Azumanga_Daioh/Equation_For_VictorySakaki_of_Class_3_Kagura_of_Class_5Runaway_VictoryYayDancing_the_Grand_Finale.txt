 Kimura:
Yes, that's right.
The sports fest is coming up.

Tomo:
 Hm?

Chiyo Osaka:
 Huh?

Yomi:
 Huh?

Kimura:
I feel that, for P.E. uniforms, it's better to tuck your shirt into your bloomers.

Student:
Mr. Kimura, for the guys' uniforms, which is better? Tuck or don't tuck?

Kimura:
Uh, what on earth are you talking about?
We're in the middle of class.

Student:
Huh?


Osaka:
 The sports fest is comin'.
 A Tokyo sports fest.

Yomi, Kaorin:
 Hm?

Osaka:
 Well, I've never done a sports fest in Tokyo before, so I'm lookin' forward to it.

Yomi:
 Is there some difference between Tokyo and Osaka?

Osaka:
 Oh, yeah. It's real different.

Kaorin:
So, how's it different?

Osaka:
 In Osakan sports fest, first place wins you fried octopus balls.

 Sorry. I lied.

Tomo:
 When it comes to sports fest, the spotlight is gonna shine on me!
 Ooh, I'm pants! I'm on fire!

Osaka:
 Spotlight?

Yomi:
 For what?

Tomo:
 Short sprint, medium sprint, marathons, long jump, high jump, basket scramble, cavalry battle.
 I'm aiming to win the top prize in every event!

Yomi:
 Well, it's easy enough for anyone to aim to win.

Tomo:
 Hahaha.

Kaorin:
Heh, you got no hope, Tomo.

Tomo:
 What?!

Kaorin:
Because you have to beat Miss Sakaki.
Miss Sakaki is good at any and every sport.
There's no way you can win.
Oh, I just know she's going to be totally cool out there!

Tomo:
 Huh, then I'll just have to compete with my cuteness!

Yomi, Kaorin:
Huh?

Tomo:
 I'll make an appeal to everyone based on how cute I am.
 We'll pick me or Miss Sakaki in a massive school wide vote.
 And then, the victory will be mine!

Kaorin:
What are you talking about?!
Being cool is better than being cute!
Way better!

Tomo:
 Oh, yeah? I say it's being cute!

Kaorin:
No, being cool!

Tomo:
 Being cute!

Tomo:
 Hey, Yomi, which one do you think is better?

Yomi:
 I really couldn't care less.


Yukari:
 Listen up, everyone!
 I have one word that I wanna say to all of you!
 And that word... is first place!

Everyone:
Huh?

Osaka:
 What's first place?

Yukari:
 Put all your fighting spirit into the sports fest!
 And we'll be sure to win!
 We have to win against Class 5!

Osaka:
 So, what's wrong with Class 5?

Kaorin:
You know, Miss Kurosawa's homeroom class.

Osaka:
 Oh.

Yukari:
 In any case, think about winning, no matter what!
 You're free to use whatever means you feel necessary!

Yomi:
 Whatever means necessary?

Tomo:
 Hey, if we win, you should treat us all to a can of juice!

Yukari:
 Juice, huh?
 Let's see, if we're looking at 120 yen a can...
 Okay! If you guys win, I'll treat you all!

Yomi:
 Just how much did you bet on this?


Osaka:
 I hope it's gonna be clear tomorrow.

Chiyo:
 I'll put up a tell-weather-doll for luck.

Osaka:
 Better yet I'll do something right now.

Chiyo:
 Huh?

Osaka:
 Let's see what side of mine's on.

Chiyo:
 Oh, that way we can predict the weather.

Osaka:
 There.
 Uh...


Sakaki:
 Aw, Aw, Aw...

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:2:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Kaorin:
Hey, Chihiro, what events are you in?

Chihiro:
Relay and cavalry battle.

Tomo:
 Too bad, Miss chunky pony can't ride!

Yomi:
 Shut up.

Chiyo:
 It's a clear day.

Osaka:
 I guess that shoe must have landed right side up.

Yomi:
 Y-You will?

Tomo:

Yomi:

Yukari:
 We're not gonna lose to your class!

Nyamo:
 I wouldn't be so sure now.

Yukari:
 Why shouldn't I?
 My class has Sakaki.
 There's no way we'll lose so... yeah.

Nyamo:
 Hey, my class has a star athlete too.

Yukari:
 What?! No fair!
 That's cheating!
 You big such a cheater!

Nyamo:
 Yeah, how's that?

Yukari:
 All right!

Yukari:
 Hey, hey.
 The star athlete from Class 5?
 Do you know her?

Chihiro:
From Class 5?

Kaorin:
Oh, that would have to be Miss Kagura.

Yukari:
 Kagura?

Kaorin:
That's her over there.

Kaorin:
She belongs to Miss Kurosawa's swim team.
Rumor has it that she's good at all sports, not just swimming.

Yukari:
 Huh...

Yukari:
 Miss Kagura?
 Say, would you like a sweet bun?

Kagura:
 Huh?

Yukari:
 Here you go.

 Well, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
 Yes?

Tomo:
 How about a word of encouragement to everyone.

Chiyo:
 Oh...

 Well, Um...
 You do your best... But if I...

Everyone:
Huh?

Chiyo:
If... if I start dragging everyone down and we end up losing all because of me...

Yomi:
 It's okay, Chiyo-chan, don't worry.
 The sports fest is just a game.
 So, just do what you can.

Yukari:
 Okay, everyone!

Everyone:
Huh?

Yukari:
 Now, listen up!
 We win today, no matter what!
 Don't get any soft ideas that the sports fest is just a game and drag everyone down!

 Chiyo:
 Oh...

 Yukari:
 Is that clear?

Chiyo:
 Um... Excuse me...

Yukari:
 Hurray, everyone!
 Let's see some spirit!

Everyone:
Yeah!

Yukari:

Tomo:
 Oh, yeah, but, look.

Yomi:
 Hm, we're still a little behind Class 5.

 That's because I'm a burden, right?

 You know that's not true.
