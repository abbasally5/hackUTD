 Yukari:
Well that's gonna be it for today's lessons.
But has everybody prepared yet?
Midterms are coming up soon.
It's a tough time for everyone, right?
But even so, it'll be a cinch to get through for the serious boys and girls who've been seriously doing their homework and stuff on a daily basis.

Tomo:
Huh?

Yukari:
But for someone like our Tomo, who copies whole cells from Chiyo, not a chance.

Tomo:
Some of the parts are Yomi.

Yukari:
Shut up, you moron!

Student:
It's so hot again, don't you wish we could have some shaved ice?

Student:
Yeah.

Tomo:
Yomi!

Yomi:
Huh?

Tomo:
We have math this afternoon, right?
I need to see your homework.

Yomi:
Again? Are you serious?
But you just got a warning from Miss Yukari already today.

Tomo:
That's why I decided to ask you instead of Chiyo-chan this time, get it?

Yomi:
Phew...
How about doing your own work sometime?

Tomo:
It's just I didn't catch the assignment.
I really do want to, I swear I do.

Yomi:
Yeah, sure you do.

Tomo:
Here! Next time, as a favor, I'll do your homework as well.

Yomi:
Right.
It'll be riddled with mistakes.
I'll just do it myself.

Tomo:
Then, my only choice is to see yours.

Yomi:
Why don't you just do your own!

Tomo:
It's no big deal. Come on, Yomi, lighten up!
Don't be so uptight about it.
This is you and me, right?

Yomi:
Uh, really.
Well, here.

Tomo:
Ooh, let me have it.
Let me have it now, okay?
Huh?

Yomi:
"Thank you so very much."
Come on!

Tomo:
Huh?
What's that about?
Are you an idiot or what?

Yomi:
The real idiot is you!

Chiyo:
Uh, both of you please, please calm down!

Yomi:
Really.

Chiyo:
Hm.

Tomo:
Idiot.

Chiyo:
Both of you, stop it! Stop!
Please stop fighting!
I said please stop!

Tomo:
It's because Yomi's being stingy.

Yomi:
That is so not the issue here.

Chiyo:
Now, now.
You know...

Tomo:
Hm?

Chiyo:
What Miss Yomi is saying is very true.
You really should try harder.
At least, try before the test date.

Tomo:
It's okay. It's okay. Don't worry.

Chiyo:
What?

Tomo:
I've done nothing this whole time, so there's no point this late in the game.
What will be will be!

Yomi:
That's the kind of person she is, Chiyo-chan.
You're wasting your time even worrying about her.

Chiyo:
Really.

Tomo:
Really, such a problem, isn't it?

Yomi:
We're talking about you, Tomo.

Tomo:
Heh, he, he.

Yomi:
What?

Tomo:
You're really good at taking digs at people.
For real, I'm just no match for ya.
The fruit next door is a fruit that beats on families.
Come on, won't take a dig at me, will you?

Chiyo:
Ah!

Tomo:
You... good job... hitting me with... your left uppercut... uh...

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:2:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Tomo:
Hey, Yomi!

Yomi:
No!

Tomo:
What the heck?
I haven't even said anything yet.

Yomi:
You're asking me for another favor.
Homework for example?

Tomo:
It's not that.

Yomi:
Then, what is it?

Tomo:
Tell me the scope of the upcoming grammar test.
That's all.

Yomi:
It is a favor.

Tomo:
What can I say?
I forgot what was gonna be on it.

Yomi:
I'll never telling you!
A lazy person like you can just keep forgetting for the rest of her life!

Tomo:
Bu... But Yomi, it just slipped my mind.
I mean...

Osaka:
Forgettin'?
I'll give ya a run for your money any day.

Tomo:
You too, Osaka?
Good job!

Kagura:
Hold it, right there.
Can't have you forgetting about me now, can we?

Tomo:
Ooh, Kagura too!

So, there you have it.
Now please extend your loving help to us three!

Kagura:
Like me for example, I've forgotten the scope of the tests in every single subject, mm-hm.

Tomo:
Ooh, that's quite a dummy.

Osaka:
Oh yeah, by the way...
When is these tests supposed to start again?

Tomo:
Wow! you've even forgotten the schedule?

Kagura:
Oh, man, she is know as the great queen of forgetfulness for nothing.

Yomi:
How can they be so...

Tomo:
So, in conclusion...

Yomi:
What?

Tomo, Kagura, Osaka:
Tell us the scope of the next test, right now!

Yomi:
Hm!

Kagura:
Tell us!

Osaka:
Tell us!

Tomo:
Tell us!

Kagura:
The scope of the tests!

Osaka:
Yomi!

Tomo:
Tell us!

Kagura:
Please!

Osaka:
Help us!

Tomo:
Yomi!

Kagura:
The tests!

Osaka:
The tests!

Tomo:
You have to!

Kagura:
Please!

Yomi:
Think again, like hell I'm gonna tell some knuckleheads like you?!

Tomo:
Knu.... knuckleheads?! What?!

Tomo:
Hm?
Hey, what are you guys acting so cool for?

Kagura, Osaka:
Huh?

Tomo:
Come on, you two, say something back at her.

Kagura, Osaka:
Huh?
Knucklehead.

Tomo:
Knucklehead"S"!

Kagura, Osaka:
Oh!
Who're you calling knuckleheads?!

Yomi:
Hm, phew.

Tomo:
Fine, then!
If you wanna go that far, then we just won't ask you.
If we can't find out the scope, then we'll just have to study everything.
That's right.
We three will work together.
Just you watch!
We'll get the last laugh.

Tomo, Kagura, Osaka:
On our honor as knuckleheads!

Kagura:
I don't get this part.

Osaka:
What could it mean?

Tomo:
We can't lose hearts.
We'll figure it out if we work together.


Kagura:
Hey, why don't we make a sincerely apology to Yomi and get her to tell us the scope of the exams.

Tomo:
If we lose, we'll have lost!

Kagura:
Uh...

Osaka:
Say.

Kagura:
Huh?

Osaka:
Like for "Blue Three", would that mean that "Blue" is his last name?

Kagura:
That was random.

Tomo:
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Osaka, that's so dumb!
"Blue Three" is a foreigner, isn't he?

Osaka:
Mm-hm.

Tomo:
That means his last name's gotta be "Three."

Kagura:
Uh...

Kagura, Osaka:
Ooh!

Kagura:
I never knew that!
You're awesome, Tomo!

Tomo:
Yeah, I know.

Osaka:
Okay, but I wonder what happened to "One" and "Two."

Osaka:
You know, I guess that means "Blue Five" or thereabouts would be Jackie Chan, huh?

Tomo, Kagura:
Oh!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:4:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Kagura:
I understand that it's no use if there're just us knuckleheads now.

Sakaki:
What?

Kagura:
I know there's a big test coming up tomorrow.
And I also know I'd better do something about it.
But unfortunately, I never managed to take any notes in class and I'm in pain for it.
So, here's the thing, Sakaki.
Please, oh, please, can I take a quick little peek at your notes?

Wow, thank you!
Looks like having a rival can come in pretty handy, huh?
Thanks a million!

Kagura:
All right, now which should I copy first from this thing?

Don't get it...
Don't get it...
Don't get it.

Don't get it...
Umm, don't get it.
Don't get it!

Don't get it. Don't get it. Don't get it.

Hm?
What the heck is this?
One of Sakaki's doodles?
Not much of an artist, is she.

Hey, Sakaki.
Thanks a lot.
Though just looking at it, it didn't tell me as much as I thought it would, you know?
Later.

Sakaki:
Ah.

Osaka:
Miss Yukari.

Yukari:
Huh?
What is it, Osaka?

Osaka:
I've got a question.

Yukari:
Oh, wow. I guess when tests roll around, even Osaka has an interest in studying.
All right, ask me anything.

Osaka:
Well, in America...

Yukari:
Yeah.

Osaka:
Like with American homes...

Yukari:
Yeah?

Osaka:
You can go inside with your shoes on?

Yukari:
Yeah.

Osaka:
Okay, so, what if you...
...you stepped in dog poop like out there in the street,

Yukari:
Ugh..

Osaka:
...and then you just went in home without realizin' it...

Yukari:
Ughhh..

Osaka:
And then on top of that, if the American father and mother and eldest son and eldest daughter all stepped on poop themselves and they went in home without realizin' it...

Yomi:
You're rather relaxed?

Tomo:
Huh?

Yomi:
Isn't there something you should be doing, Tomo?
The test is tomorrow, you know.

Tomo:
Ha. Hm. Ahahahaha.
I have a secret plan!
Feast your eyes!

Yomi:
What are those?

Tomo:
Hmm... my picks.

Yomi:
Your picks?

Tomo:
I've covered the whole board.

Yomi:
This is your plan?

Tomo:
As they say, there's no telling how the future will turn out.

Yomi:
Is that so?

Tomo:
I'm not gonna let myself get worked up about it anymore, 'cause I've got it all covered now.

Yomi:
I'm glad to hear it.

Tomo:
Of course, you are.
And is everyone else gonna be okay?

Oh, my, here's someone putting up a futile resistance.
Oh, what to do?
Cramming for the night before?
Can you memorize it all in time?

Student:
Shut up! You're gonna make me forget!

Tomo:
Yeah, yeah, don't take it out on me.

I bring glad tidings for everyone.
Tomo's prediction of "what's on the test!"

Like for example, the text on page 32, we're gonna be translating for sure.
Don't forget to memorize it all!

Yukari:
All right, everyone, you may begin.

Students:
It's not on here!

Yukari:
What? What?

Yomi:
Huh....

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:6:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Kagura:
Hm... 30 points, huh?
Well. this test was pretty hard.
Looks like it's gonna shape up to be a really low-scoring competition.
Hm?

Kagura:
Hey, Saka...

Sakaki:
Hm?

Kagura:
Oh, wha...
Never mind. It was nothing.

Kagura:
I had no idea Sakaki was that smart.
I guess it really must've been a lucky day or something.
That's it! That's gotta be the reason why!

Chihiro:
Kaorin, how many points did you get on the test?

Kaorin:
This time I got 85.

Chihiro:
That's good, I only got 80 points.

Kaorin:
But it seems like this test was pretty easy though.

Chihiro:
I know, I'll bet the average score's gonna be pretty high.
That kinda sucks.

Kaorin:
Yeah.

Kagura:
This test was pretty easy...
High average score...
That means everyone got good scores...
So, this could... possibly be... really bad, huh?

Tomo:
Hey, Osaka!
How'd you do?

Osaka:
Oh, not so good.

Tomo:
Yeah, well. There was no way it was gonna be.

Osaka:
Hah...

Tomo:
All right, ready? One, two...

Tomo, Osaka:
Three!

Tomo:
Oh, man, I lost with 31 points!

Osaka:
I did it! 42 points!

Tomo:
Damn, to think I'd lose to Osaka...

Osaka:
That's good, huh.

Kagura:
Yay! Go, knuckleheads!

Tomo:
What are you calling yourself a knucklehead for?

Kagura:
Yeah, well...

Tomo:
So?

Kagura:
Yes?

Tomo:
So, how many points did you get, huh?
Don't tell me you're gonna brag to us how good you did?

Kagura:
30 points here.

Tomo:
That's just insane.
What's up with that?! It's worse than my score!
I got, what was it, 31 points, right.
Yeah, that's right.

Kagura:
Wow, I lost! Well, damn it!

Tomo:
That just pissed me off for some reason.

Kagura:
Yeah, really?

Osaka:
Hey, wait!
Does that mean, then now I'm the leader of the Knuckleheads 'cause I got the highest score out of all of us.

Tomo:
I'm not quite sure you're leader material.

Kagura:
And that doesn't make me envy you.

Osaka:
What? Really?

Tomo:
Hey, besides, in Knuckleheads, wouldn't you think the lower score would be like greater anyway?

Osaka:
Oh.

Kagura:
What... what's with that look?!

Osaka:
Our leader!

Tomo:
We'll follow you for the rest of our lives!

Kagura:
H-H-Hey, now, wait a minute. I don't wanna do this, okay?!

Osaka, Tomo:
Our leader!

Kagura:
Besides, 30 points, 31 points, I mean, how much of difference is there?

Tomo:
Hah-hah! A win is a win, even by one point.

Kagura:
Oh, man, that is so not cute!

Tomo:
Oh, well, I'm confident that I'm at least cuter than you are.

Kagura:
You're really pissing me off.

Tomo:
Oh, am I?

Yomi:
Oh, hey, how many points did you get, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
So, tell me how did you do, Miss Yomi?

Yomi:
Oh, I guess I did all right.

Chiyo:
Well, then, let's show each other on the count of three.

Yomi:
Okay. Ready, one, two, three!

Chiyo:
Hahaha...

Yomi:
Wow! A hundred!
I'm no match.
Not with my measly 92 points.
Damn it. I really thought that I had you this time, well...

Chiyo:
I think it just went really well for me this time around.

Hmm? Uh... Uh-oh...

Osaka:
42 points!

Kagura:
30 points!

Tomo:
31 points!

Kagura, Tomo, Osaka:
By our three scores combined, we have 103!
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
The Knuckleheads win!
We ain't knuckleheads no more!

Yomi:
Whatever...


 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:8:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Tomo:
I realize this is sudden, but the knuckleheads will be disbanded as of today!
Why you ask? It's very simple.
I will no longer be knucklehead one.

Everyone:
Huh?

Tomo:
Yes, I have found a way to do it.
Hahaha...
And that is... to steal the abilities of Chiyo-chan and Miss Sakaki!

Chiyo:
Huh?

Tomo:
Yes! I'll take Miss Sakaki's athletic power and Chiyo-chan's abilities as a prodigy!
It'll be perfect!
No one will call me a knucklehead after that!

Yomi:
Wow, I don't know where to start poking fun.

Osaka:
You... you know what?

Tomo:
Huh?

Osaka:
While you're at it, you can have my ability to be late and my ability to forget everything.

Tomo:
No! I've gained extra, unnecessary abilities!

Chiyo:
Wait, so what happens then, huh?

Tomo:
Well, I'll tell you.

Yukari:
And so, in this situation, the construction after the "if"...

Tomo:
Good morning! Hello, Miss Yukari.
I'm late! And I'm very sorry!

Yukari:
Oh, well, just get to your seat.

Tomo:
Right! Hah!

Chiyo:
Ah!

Yomi:
Ah!

Kagura:
Ah!

Osaka:
Ah!

Tomo:
The answer to that part is "a delightful little breeze"!
Oops, I'm sorry, I forgot my textbook!

Tomo:
That's what'll happen.
See what I mean?
It got all screwed up because of the Osaka abilities.
And I was going pretty good until then too.

Osaka:
Oh, sorry about that.

Yomi:
Well, you know, if you don't fix your tendency of relying on other people, you're never gonna get anywhere.
And it won't just be tests like this one.
We're taking entrance exams next year.

Tomo:
I don't know.

Yomi:
I do!

Tomo:
Well, I'm sure it'll work out. Hahahaha...

Kagura:
Seriously, Tomo.
I really wonder how you got into this school.

Tomo:
Huh? I'm not quite sure I understand exactly what you mean by that, Kagura.

Kagura:
Really?

Tomo:
Maybe you should try another language, like French.
<French>Oui, oui!<French>

Kagura:
Um...
<French> Tu es... <French> um...
<French?> Tu es... stupid <French?>

Tomo:
<French> Pardonnez moi? <French>

Kagura:
How did you even get in this school when you're so stupid!

Tomo:
Stupid, huh?
You can't even say school in French.
Besides, that goes for you as well.
Or if Miss France prefers "tu"... "also"...

Yomi:
You mean <French> aussi <French>.

Kagura:
I hate to say it, but you're exactly right!

Tomo:
Yes, I am.
And that's what makes you my rival.

Kagura:
Huh?

Yomi:
Hello?

Tomo:
Which pretty much means that even though we both've been saddled with a big disadvantage, fact is, we're still here anyway.
So could that mean we'll get through the entrance exams if we just keep doing what we're doing?

Chiyo:
Uh...

Yomi:
Hm?

Kagura:
Oh!

Yomi:
Tomo was like that all the way through the second year of middle school.
But in the third year, she suddenly decided to take up studying.

Tomo:
Yup! Up until then, I hadn't done any studying whatsoever!
All my textbooks were as good as new.

Yomi:
Oh, that's impressive.

Tomo:
And you got into our school? That's amazing.
I guess you can do stuff if you try.

Tomo:
Something like that.
It was when I heard Yomi was trying to get in.

Chiyo:
You did it because you wanted to go to the same school as her?

Yomi:
No, that wasn't it.

Tomo:
See, the thing is, when I said I'd try to,
Yomi said... "Hah! With your grades, it'll be impossible, Tomo."
So, I studied like a maniac after that.
When the results came back and Yomi learned I'd gotten in and you should've seen the look on her face!
It was great!
So, if I really feel like doing something, I can totally do it.
Now, everyone, shower me with your lavish admiration!
Huh?

Kagura:
Hey, why do you always work so hard at doing things that other people don't like?

Tomo:
What do you mean?

Yomi:
Well, that's just how she is.
She's been like that since grade school.

Tomo:
You... you make it sound like I did something bad!

Yomi:
Get a clue.

Tomo:
What?!


-- Preview --


Yukari:
Okay, everyone, time to study!
We're having a big study group meeting at Chiyo-chan's summer home!

Tomo:
What? Study?
I'm gonna smash watermelons on the beach again!

Yukari:
This time, I was thinking of having Miss Minamo Kurosawa as a guest speaker to give an adult lecture.

Osaka:
An adult lecture?

Chiyo:
What kind of lecture is that?

Yukari:
Nyamo, I'll leave the rest to you.

Nyamo:
What? What am I giving a lecture on!

Everyone:
Ooh! Tell us now!
