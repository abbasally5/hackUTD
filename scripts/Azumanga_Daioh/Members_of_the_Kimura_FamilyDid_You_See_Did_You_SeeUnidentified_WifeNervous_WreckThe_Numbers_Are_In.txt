 Yukari:
 The time is once again upon us!
 The sports fest is tomorrow!
 We must beat Class 2 no matter what!

Kagura:
 Class 2?

Tomo:
 So, that's Nyamo's class, right?

Osaka:
 Oh...

Kagura:
 So...

Yukari:
 Work hard, do your best, and seize the victory.
 Is that not a beautiful goal?
 That's 10,000 yen worth of beauty! It'll be precise.

Tomo:
 Oh! Oh!
 If we beat Class 2, we should get juice even if we are not first place!

Yukari:
 Non, non, non. Such lowly ambitions simply will not do.
 Aim for victory!
 If you are victorious, I'll buy drinks for everyone.
 Maybe some steak.

Osaka:
 That'd be nice
 Some steak.

Kagura:
 What?

Osaka:
 But super spicy sauce is no good.
 I can't handle spicy food.

Kagura:
 I see.
 So, what does steak have to do with the sports fest?

Osaka:
 Cayenne is actually a type of red chili pepper.
 Did you know that?

Yukari:
 Hey, you two slackers!
 Do you guys have the will to win?!
 Especially you, Kagura!

Kagura:
 Huh?

Yukari:
 Do you know why you're sitting in this class right now?!

Yomi, Kaorin:
 So, that really was the reason...

Yukari:
 Now, let's see you put some spirit into it!
 Down with Class 2!
 To victory! Go Class 3!

Everyone:
Go Class 3...

Yukari:
 Not enough spirit!
 One more time! Go Class 3!

Everyone:
Go Class 3!

Nyamo:
 Well, I'll take attendance now.


Yomi:
 She's really into this.
 So, steak again, is it?

Osaka:
 Well, that's if we win, right?

Chiyo:
 With Miss Kagura and Miss Sakaki, our class will be really strong this year,

Tomo:
 We've also got some people that drag us down.

Yomi:
 You're the one who drags us down!

Tomo:
 What do you mean?
 Didn't you see my many accomplishments last year?!

Yomi:
 Yeah, I did.
 I saw you trip magnificently at the finish line and take out the runners behind you.
 That great accomplishment that made such a great big mess.

Tomo:
 So what?!
 Can't you at the very least appreciate my fantastic showmanship?!

Chiyo:
 Uh, um, please sign me up for fewer events this year.

Osaka:
 And why are we doing 10km marathon, anyway?
 Couldn't there be a bread-eatin' contest?

Tomo:
 It's true!
 I tripped on purpose, okay?!

Yomi:
 Don't worry. Chiyo-chan.
 You're definitely a vital part of our team.
 What kind of outfit do you think we should make for the cheering contest?

Kimura:
Well, I have a suggestion concerning that.

Everyone:
Ah!

Osaka:
 Oh!

Kimura:
This time, this wonderful baton is the key point so I...

Yomi:
 Hm!

Kimura:
Ah...

Tomo:
 Huh? What's this?
 It's a photo of a woman.

Osaka:
 She's a real pretty lady.

Tomo:
 Who is it?

Kimura:
My wife.

Everyone:
No way!

Tomo:
 Someone like that...
 This is a joke, right?
 Uh...

Kimura:
What are you talking about?
I have a photo of all of us together.

Tomo:
 So, uh, who's the little girl?

Kimura:
That's my daughter.

Tomo:
 She seems like a very intelligent child...

Yomi:
 Weird.

Osaka:
 Yeah.

Tomo:
 Any way you look at it, that wife for Kimura is just plain weird!

Yomi:
 Definitely.

Chiyo:
 Hey, you guys, that's terrible!
 It's true that he's an odd teacher, but...

Osaka:
 I smell some sorta conspiracy.

Tomo:
 Yeah, there's insufficient motive for her to have chosen Kimura.

Chiyo:
 That's probably just her taste in men...

Osaka:
 That wife's got awful taste.

Tomo:
 Oh, I know!
 Maybe his wife's got a real bad personality.
 And that's the reason why...

Yukari:
 No! Believe it or not, his wife is supposedly so kind, she can tolerate THAT.

Tomo:
 Does... does that mean that she's an angel?

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:2:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Osaka:
 It did turn out clear today.

Yomi:
 What's the matter?
 You don't look too happy.
 I thought you were looking forward to running in the obstacle course race this year.

Osaka:
 Oh, that's fine.
 But it ain't the issue at hand.

Chiyo:
 Issue at hand?

Osaka:
 Yeah, it's a real big issue too.
 When it comes to marathons, I'm no good.

Chiyo:
 You mean that 10km marathon we have to do?
 I've been despairing over that one as well.

Yomi:
 Not good at it?
 Then, is there anything you are good at, Osaka?

Osaka:
 Um... Yeah, puzzles...

Yomi, Chiyo:
 Huh...

Osaka:
 I lied. I'm no good at puzzles either.

Yomi:
 Don't tell half-baked jokes like that.

Osaka:
 Oh, I hate it.

Yomi:
 Why not try and think of it as like a diet.

Osaka:
 Oh, maybe that would work.

Yomi:
 Say for example, you never go running long distances on your own.
 Well, this is your chance.

Osaka:
 That's a good point, but I'm not fat.

Yomi:
 Wait, you only said that you weren't?

Osaka:
 Uh...
 Just thinkin' 'bout the obstacle course, I can't wait!

Kagura:
 Yeah, I'm gonna do my best today!

Tomo:
 That's right.
 Do your best. Do your very best!

Kagura:
 What's with the attitude, huh?!

Tomo:
 It's quite simple, Kagura.
 The harder you work and the faster you run, the more likely Yukari is treating me to juice, right?
 So, you just go out there and do your best for me!
 Hahaha.

Kagura:
 Damn it...

Yomi:
 They're so incredibly simple.


Kimura:
FIRST PLACE! Hurray!

Announce:
And that was the message from the Executive Sports Fest Committee Chairman.

Announce:
We will now be starting the basket scramble.

Chiyo:
 I didn't get a single ball in last year, but I will get one today.

Tomo:
 I didn't get any in last year either, but I'm gonna get three this time!

 Chiyo:
Ooh.

Osaka:
 Hey, I wasn't able to score any baskets either last year, but this year, I'll put in five!

Chiyo, Tomo:
 Ooh!

Tomo:
 Well, in that case, I'll get three more for a total of six!

Chiyo:
 I wanna get in at least two as well.

Kagura:
 We can't count on these guys.
 So, let's do our best, okay?

Nyamo:
 Ready?!

Tomo:
 Take that!

Osaka:
 Take that!

Chiyo:
 There!

Tomo:
 Take that!

Osaka:
 Take that!

Chiyo:
 There!

Tomo:
 Take that!

Osaka:
 Take that!

Chiyo:
 There!

 Ah, I did it! I did it!
The ball went in! My ball went in the basket just now!
 Did you see?! Did you see, you guys?!

Tomo:
 Take that!

Osaka:
 Take that!

Tomo:
 There!

Osaka:
 Take that!

Tomo:
 And that!

Osaka:
 Take that!

Tomo:
 And that!

Chiyo:
 There!


Announce:
Next up is ball rolling.

Tomo:
 Tomo-Chiyo pair, let's go all the way!

Chiyo:
 Yeah!

Nyamo:
 Ready?!

Announce:
Next up is the obstacle course race.

Osaka:
 I'll go do my best for y'all!

Tomo:
 Isn't having Osaka do the obstacle course race a really bad case of miscasting?

Nyamo:
 Ready?!

Yomi:
 Well, she kept saying how she just really wanted to do it, so...
 You know where you stick your face in the flour to get the candy?
 She said she wanted to do that.

Tomo:
 Huh?

Osaka:
 Here goes!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:4:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Chiyo:
 Here, Miss Osaka.
 Please wipe your face.

Yomi:
 So why's that gotta be the four of us now?

Osaka:
 Hahaha.

Announce:
Next up is the girls' cavalry race.

Tomo:
 Rock, paper...

Everyone:
Scissors!

Osaka:
 Scissors.

Tomo:
 All right!
 Tomo takes the victory!

Yomi:
 That round should've been called invalid 'cause somebody was late.

Tomo:
 Come on!
 Who on earth puts in late just to lose?
 Right, Osaka?

Osaka:
 You are good at rock-paper-scissors, Tomo.

Yomi:
 It's the worst possible setup!

Tomo:
 All right! Crush the enemy!

Chiyo:
 Tomo, please quit moving!

Nyamo:
 Ready?!

Tomo:
 A varsity scally ranks, raise the anchor!
 We're taking the field too!

Yomi:
 Chiyo-chan, are you okay?

Chiyo:
 I... I'm okay... F-Fine...

Tomo:
 Okay, go right!
 Move to the right! The right! The right!

Osaka:
 Right?

Yomi:
 The hand you hold your chopsticks in!

Osaka:
 Um... let's see...
 So, it's this one, huh?

Yomi:
 If you've figured it out, put your hands back!
 Chiyo-chan won't last long!

Chiyo:
 I can't hold on...

Tomo:
 Idiot Chiyo!
 Where's your spirit?!

Yomi:
 You're the idiot!

Tomo:
 What?! Taking-digs four-eyes!
 I'm the captain!
 Anyone who dares to defy me can leave this ship now!

Yomi:
 How is it you want me to?

Girl1:
So what now?

Girl2:
I kinda feel sorry for them, you know?

Girl3:
Yeah.

Tomo:
 Why aren't you freaking moving?!

Girl4:
And they're... a little scary.

Girl1:
Do you guys wanna go somewhere else?

Girls:
Oh!

Yomi:
 Chiyo-chan, are you okay?

Chiyo:
 Oh, more or less

Tomo:
 Ah! You... you're drinking juice!

Yomi:
 You have to replenish the fluid you've lost.

Tomo:
 The juice is for when we win and Yukari treats us to, you Moron!

Yomi:
 We have to drink something.
 We can't hold off until the sports fest is over, you know.

Tomo:
 Water!
 You can drink water until then!

Yomi:
 You can do that.

Tomo:
 Damn it!

Yomi:
 What's the matter?
 Was the tap water not so good?

Yomi
 That's mine, you know!

Tomo:
 Now, hold on.
 Take a look at that.

Yomi:
 At that?

Tomo:
 Uh-huh.

Yomi:
 Wait, that... could be... Kimura's wife?

Tomo:
 Yeah.

Yomi:
 She really exists...

Tomo:
 Let's see just how good a person she is.

Yomi:
 What are you doing?

Tomo:
 Doing this.

Kimura's wife:
What's that?
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear, ow!

Tomo:
 Whoa!
 She's like a super good person!

Kimura's wife:
Hahaha.

Tomo, Yomi, Chiyo:
 Uh...

Chiyo:
 Oh, she's coming towards us.

Yomi:
 Yeah...

Kimura's wife:
Oh, my goodness!
You must be Chiyo-chan.
Wow, you are such a cute one!

Chiyo:
 Um, how did you know who I am?

Kimura's wife:
Oh, I'm sorry.
My husband's one of the teachers.
And he'd told me that there's this cute, tiny, little girl who goes to school here.

Chiyo:
 I... I didn't know he'd mention me.

Tomo:
 So, did you come today to watch the sports fest?

Kimura's wife:
Yes, I had intent on coming in earlier, but I was working so hard at making this lunch, so I came in late.

Tomo:
 A lunch from a loving wife!

Kimura's wife:
Oh, stop it.
Though, you know, he likes to call it his "love wife lunch box".

Yomi:
 Love wife?!

Tomo:
 Why that?!
 It just sounds so wrong!

Tomo:
 So, what about Ki... um, Mr. Kimura do you like, huh?

Chiyo:
 Ah!

 Kimura's wife:
Um... let's see... I think he's cool.

Everyone:
Huh?

Tomo:
 She has no eye for character!

Kimura's wife:
Well, it's true he isn't really the type that's in fashion these days.
But you know what?
It's a little like how 70s clothing has been making a comeback.
He sort of cycles around again like that.
Maybe I'm just outta touch with the present days.

Tomo:
 Yeah, right!
 It doesn't matter how many cycles we go through, Kimura's turn is never gonna come up!


 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:6:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Announce:
Next up is the scavenger race.

Nyamo
 Ready!

Osaka:
 You can do it, Chiyo-chan! Yeah!

Yukari:
 Do for steak!

Osaka:
 Chiyo-chan, hang in there!

Tomo:
 Beat them up!
 Make it so they'll never be able to get up again!

Yomi:
 What in a scavenger race?
 Beat up who?

Tomo:
 Go!

Osaka:
 Uh, here she comes.

Chiyo:
 O-Okay...

Yomi:
 Glasses again?

Chiyo:
 N-No, um, well, well...

Tomo:
 Oh!
 Is it bloomers?!
 You want mine?

Chiyo:
 Oh!

Yomi:
 I kinda doubt it.

Chiyo:
 You come with me!

Tomo:
 Gotcha!

Yomi:
 What? Tomo...
 No way!

Osaka:
 Yeah, it was bloomers.

Yomi:
 Chiyo-chan sure has guts pulling that moo.

Tomo:
 Goal!

Tomo:
 Hey, Chiyo, so, what were you supposed to pick up?
 A beautiful lady?
 Or maybe someone you admire?
 Or your best friend?
 Oh, I'm turning red!

Chiyo:
 Ah... Ah!

Tomo:
 What the heck?


Kaorin:
What?!
Chihiro just twisted her ankle?!

Yomi:
 Yeah, she's at the nurse's office now.

Kaorin:
What am I gonna do?
She and I are doing the three-legged race.

Yukari:
 What's that?
 Are we short someone?

Kaorin:
Yeah, I'm missing my partner for the three-legged race...

Yukari:
 Well, then, it'd be nice to get someone strong to replace her.

Tomo:
 Me!

Yukari:
 Hey, Sakaki!
 Come and be in the three-legged race.

Kaorin:
Oh...
B-But, for Miss Sakaki to take part in such a dull event...

Sakaki:
 No, not at all.
 Really,
 I've always wanted to try out the three-legged race.
 It looks kinda fun.

Kaorin:
Ah, honestly?
Are you sure?

Sakaki:
 Let's do this.

Kaorin:
Yeah, let's do our best together!

Chihiro:
Kaorin! Kaorin!
If you want I can actually run with you.
The nurse told me it wasn't that bad!

Kaorin:
Agrh!

Chihiro:
Um...

Kaorin:
Agrh!

Chihiro:
Good... good luck, okay?

Announce:
Next up is the three-legged race.

Kaorin:
Um, well, um... I'll do my best, okay?

Sakaki:
 Right.

Kaorin:
And I'll die doing my best if I have to.

Sakaki:
 Uh, okay.

Kaorin:
I'll die! I'll just die!

Nyamo:
 Ready?!

Sakaki:
 Right, let's do our best.

Kaorin:
Yes!

Sakaki, Kaorin:
 One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two.
 One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two.
 One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two.
 One, two. One, two. One, two...

Kaorin:
One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two.
One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two...

Sakaki:
 One, two. One, two. One, two, One, two.
 One, two. One...

Kaorin:
Ah! Hahaha!

We did it! Miss Sakaki!
We got first place!

Sakaki:
 Yeah.

Kaorin:
Of course, please take this flag as a thank you, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
 No, that's okay.

Kaorin:
Then what should I... um...
Oh, I know!
What do you think of... uh, uh, uh...

Sakaki:
 Well, it's very... um...

 It's too tied.

Kaorin:
If you can't untie it then, maybe we shouldn't try to force it.

Sakaki:
 Well, we can't exactly leave it.

Kaorin:
Oh, if it's about me, please don't worry.

Sakaki:
 Huh?

Kaorin:
I-I'll be fine. Honest.

Sakaki:
 You'll be fine, huh?
 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:8:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Announce:
The final event will be the school wide 10k marathon.

Tomo:
 All right!
 I'll see our big victory with this!

Chiyo:
 I'll aim to finish the race.

Tomo:
 Idiot Chiyo!
 Such a lowly ambition is no good!

Chiyo:
 What? It's no good?

Tomo:
 That's right!
 Now, watch how I run!
 How I live on, Chiyo-chan!

Osaka:
 Oh, I guess the dreaded hour has finally come 'round, hasn't it?
 The time I spent out on that fun obstacle course race is now but a distant memory of the damp and cloudy past.
 No! Super fun obstacle course race, please come back!
 Come back! You've gotta come back! I miss you obstacle course!

Yomi:
 Please let me lose the extra weight from this month's taiyaki pastries.
 I will lose it!

Kimura's wife:
Good luck, everybody!

Nyamo:
 Ready?!

Tomo:
 Full stretch! Oh, yeah!

Kagura:
 Huh?
 What the?

Yukari:
 Go, Tomo!
 Freak-away victory!
 That steak will be mine.

Girl:
Hang in there, everyone!
Good luck!

Osaka:
 Oh, it's Tomo.

Tomo:
 If I can't finish first anyway, I figured I'd at least be first towards the beginning.
 So, I was totally in the lead at the 1 km mark.
 And I did get to shine for that one brief moment, so there.

Chiyo:
 Th-That's so cool, Tomo.
 So, that's how you live, huh?!
 Okay, me, too!

Osaka:
 Chiyo-chan!

Tome:
 Well, hey there, welcome back, Chiyo-chan!

Chiyo:
 I... I cannot follow this way of life...

Tomo:
 I whole-heartedly agree.

Chiyo:
 I came in last.

Osaka:
 Second to last.

Chiyo:
 Oh, thank you very much.
 So, Miss Sakaki, what place did you get?
 I bet you came in first, huh?

Sakaki:
 Oh, No, I'm not good at distance, so I came in sixth.

Chiyo:
 Oh, but sixth is still really good!

Kagura:
 Hey, ask me what my place was!

Chiyo:
 Okay, where did you place, Miss Kagura?

Kagura:
 It was this!

Osaka:
 Flat?

Kagura:
 Fifth! Dummy!

Tomo:
 Fifth, huh? And sixth?
 I beat you all on the first kilometer!
 This contest here is a tie!

Osaka:
 Oh, I see.

Kagura:
 There's nothing to see!

Announce:
The scores have been tallied for the final event, the marathon.

Kimura:
Attention!
The first place goes to...

Everyone:
Yeah!

Tomo:
 Yukari, juice me!

Yukari:
 Nyamo...
 Victory!

Nyamo:
 It's too bad.
 But everyone you've worked really hard.

Yukari:
 First place!

Nyamo:
 Okay, for your efforts, I'm treating you all!

Students:
Yeah!

Yukari:
 What's with you?
 Acting so happy when you lost.
 Ah! Loser team!
 Look at me, losers!

Everyone:
Uh...

Yukari:
 Loser team!
 Aren't you ashamed?!
 I'll bet you are!
 You people are on the loser team!
 Losers! Losers!
 Loser team! Loser team!

Tomo:
 My juice.

Yomi:
 You still want it?

Tomo:
 No...


Yomi:
 Damn it!



-- Preview --


Tomo:
Next week is the culture fest!

Kaorin:
There's lots of cosplay, lots of fan service!

Chihiro:
Special costumes one after the other.
120 percent cuteness!

Osaka:
There'll be lots of 'em, like the plaster wall and bamboo umbrella monsters.

Tomo:
That's not exactly what you'd call cosplay...

Osaka:
Then how 'bout octopus ball and Japanese pizzas?

Tomo:
I think you're even further off than before.

Osaka:
In that case, homerun!

Tomo:
Say what?
