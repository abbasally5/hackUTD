 Tomo:
Ahhhh!

Chiyo:
Wow, that's a strange dream.

Osaka:
Uh-huh.
Even weirder than last year.
You know what I mean?

Yomi:
Hello there, all my good friends.
Happy New Year.

Chiyo:
Oh, Happy New Year to you.

Osaka:
Happy New Year.

Sakaki:
Happy New Year.

Yomi:
So, everyone, how was your break?

Chiyo:
I relaxed at the warm heated table.

Osaka:
Uh... I was just meltin'...

Sakaki:
Mine was good.
Pretty quiet overall.

Chiyo:
What about you?

Tomo:
Hold on!

Chiyo:
Miss Yomi?

Tomo:
Wait, wait!
No, don't ask her!

Chiyo:
How was your break, Miss Yomi?

Yomi:
Actually, I took a little trip to Hokkaido.

Chiyo:
Wow!

Tomo:
Ugh!

Yomi:
Oh, by the way, have any of you ever been on an airplane?

Osaka:
Oh, no I haven't.

Sakaki:
Me, neither. Never.

Tomo:
Um, No!

Chiyo:
I have though!

Yomi:
Hehehe.
Chiyo-chan, let's go over here for a little chat?

Tomo:
It was still your first time, you know!

Yomi:
Here, a souvenir.

Chiyo:
Yay!

Osaka:
Thank you, Yomi.
Hm?
"White Friend, Black"?

Osaka, Chiyo:
Huh?

Yomi:
Sakaki.

Sakaki:
Huh?

Yomi:
Here.
I heard you liked bears and things, so...
It's made with bear.
Cool, huh?

Sakaki:
Argh...

Osaka:
Wow, lucky you.
Ain't that great, Miss Sakaki?

Tomo:
Oh! Yomi!

Yomi:
Huh?

Tomo:
Over... New Year's... did you... gain some weight?!
Ahahaha.
A bull's-eye?
Did you loosen up in Hokkaido and eat too much?!
Is that it, Yomi?
Ahahaha.
So, was it rice cakes or sweet bean soup?!

Yomi:
C-Crabs...

Tomo:
Huh? Say that again? Huh?

Yomi:
Crab... you dope...

Tomo:
Ah!

Yomi:
It was all you can eat, so...

Tomo:
Ah!
All you can eat, crab?! Idiot!
No fair!
I'm gonna go tell Miss Yukari!

Yukari:
In Hokkaido?!
Snow crab?!
All you can eat?!

Tomo:
Yomi, it was all Yomi...

Yomi:
What?! You really got her!

Yukari:
Was it good? Was it good?! It was good, wasn't it?!

Yomi:
Yes...

Yukari:
You had more than just crabs, didn't you?
What else did you eat?!

Yomi:
Genghis Khan, I guess.

Yukari:
Genghis Khan?!

Yukari:
What was Genghis Khan again?

Tomo:
I don't know, my lady.

Yukari:
We'll ask Chiyo-chan.

Yukari, Tomo:
Just you wait!

Chiyo:
It's a Hokkaido specialty.
Genghis Khan is mutton that is cooked in a slightly different kind of pan than usual.

Yukari:
Oh...

Tomo:
So, is that good?

Chiyo:
Yes, it's delicious.

Yukari:
What else?!
You had other kinds of fun too, didn't you?!
Oh! You went to a hot spring, right?!

Yomi:
Well, an open-air bath...

Tomo:
Oh, my good!

Yukari:
What outdoors?! In the nude?!

Tomo:
Pervert!

Yomi:
What are you talking about, huh?!

Yukari:
So, which hot spring was it?

Yomi:
Noboribetsu.

Yukari:
Noboribetsu?
Noboribetsu Karls!
Oh, I know! It's that white bath salt!
I've bathed in that before!
Noboribetsu is great, isn't it?!
After all, it's exceptional, you know?!
Probably the best spring...

Tomo:
Wow!
She thinks they have something in common just 'cause there's the bath salt?!

Yukari:
I hear the bears in the area all bathe there too!
Hurray for hot springs! Hurray!
Viva the hot springs!

Yomi:
I'm gonna quit bragging from now on.
Especially to these guys.


 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:2:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Tomo:
So, which one should I get?
Hm, this one!

Tomo:
Hm? Oh, the cup!
My-My milk tea!
Stop it! Stop it!

Chiyo:
Ah!

Osaka:
What a disaster!

Tomo:
Uh....

Chiyo:
Oh...

Tomo:
I... I trusted you...

Chiyo:
Um, would you like some?

Tomo:
I'm afraid I'll never be able to use this vending machine again.

Osaka:
Trust in you has just plummeted, my friend.

Yomi:
Hey, what are you doing?

Osaka:
Well, you see...

Tomo:
Oh, dear Koyomi, buy some juice, will you?

Yomi:
You don't need to tell me, that's what I came for.
I'll take a milk tea.

Yomi:
Hey, it... came out with two cups.

Tomo:
Ahahaaan.

Yomi:
Huh?

Tomo:
It... It can't be!

Yomi:
What?
What's wrong?
Did I do something?

Chiyo, Osaka:
Huh...


Yomi:
So, I got to ski too.
The snow was powdery, not packed at all.

Chiyo:
Was it really?
Wow!

Osaka:
Wow, thick noodles with curry?
I didn't think of that.

Tomo:
Curry noodles!

Everyone:
Huh?

Tomo:
Danger!
Everyone run!
This stuff's gonna splatter!

Yomi:
Don't you worry, I'll be careful.

Tomo:
Ah! Being careful is useless!
It'll splatter no matter what!
And in the end, you'll be covered in curry!
Finally, Yomi has a miserable food experience too!
Aaahhhh....

Osaka:
Wow, you're really good.
You haven't splattered at all yet.
You certainly are somethin' else.

Chiyo:
That's amazing.

Yomi:
Well, I have loved thick noodles ever since I was small.

Tomo:
That's... it... damn you!
I am hated!

Yomi:
What on earth has gotten into you?!

What is with you today?!

Tomo:
Come back, you, right on!

Chiyo:
Oh, Tomo!

Yomi:
Whoa, whoa, stay away from me!

Tomo:
Stop right there!

Osaka:
The town's in an uproar!

Ow... that hurt!

Yomi:
Whoa...

Tomo:
Hahaha...

Yomi:
We can talk it over.

Tomo:
My grudge over the milk tea...
No, that's not all.
My grudge over the crab and the Genghis Khan too!
I won't let you have all the fun, you hear me!

Yomi:
Why me?!

Yomi:
Huh?

Yomi:
It's all soggy now.
 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:4:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Girl1:
If you don't hurry, I'm leaving.

Girl2:
Wait for me!

Chiyo:
Miss Osaka, let's go home.

Yomi:
What are you reading?

Osaka:
Huh? Information pamphlets.
Hearin' all about Yomi's stories of Hokkaido, well it, it made me feel like I wanted to get up and go somewhere too.
And I found someplace that looks interestin'.

Chiyo:
Oh, that's Magical Land, isn't it?!

Yomi:
What's Magical Land?

Chiyo:
Oh, it's a theme park that opened just the other day.
I've really been wanting to go there.

Yomi:
Wow.

Chiyo:
I know!
Why don't we take a trip there... like maybe this coming weekend?

Yomi:
Oh.

Osaka:
Yeah.

Tomo:
I agree!
If it's plans like that, let me in!
I'm in! I want in! How could I not?! Yay! Yay! Yay!

Chiyo:
You're really energetic.

Tomo:
A theme park! A theme park!

Yomi:
Such a child.

Tomo:
What did you say?!
Are you saying you aren't looking forward to it?!
Is that it?

Yomi:
Not so much that I'd get as excited as you are.

Tomo:
Hah! Acting all mature!
And thus, your eyes had lost the glimmer of childhood that sparked beautiful energy!

Yomi:
What's that even mean?

Osaka:
Yomi, Yomi, I've got some big news!

Yomi:
Huh?

Osaka:
The roller-coaster they got there is the best in Japan!

Yomi:
Wow.

Tomo:
"Best in Japan", huh?
Cool!

Chiyo:
They say it's absolutely terrifying.

Osaka:
They seem to have a lot of people who start cryin' too.

Chiyo:
And this other attraction next to it looks like it'll be really fun too.

Yomi:
Huh.

Tomo:
See?
Even stuffy old grown-up Miss Yomi is beginning to get excited.
Oh, I can just see it. I can just see it!
Yomi running around like a little kid, dancing in all the way.
Oh, uh-oh, she tripped.
Oh, don't cry.

Yomi:
Quit seeing weird things!

Tomo:
Huh?


Chiyo:
Oh, Miss Yomi!

Yomi:
Oh! Hi, Chiyo-chan!

Chiyo:
So, are you out shopping?

Yomi:
Well, yeah, kind of.

Chiyo:
Me too.
I came put here so I could buy the guidebook for Magical Land.
After all, it's tomorrow.
I'm so excited!

Yomi:
Oh, are you?

Chiyo:
What did you end up buying, Miss Yomi?

Yomi:
Oh, well, I uh... I bought a reference book.
That's all.
Oh, my mom asked me to go do some shopping.
I'll see you later, Chiyo-chan!

Chiyo:
Okay.

Yomi:
See you tomorrow!

Chiyo:
Bye!

Yomi:
Hehehe.

Achoo!
Oh, no...
Achoo!
Not good. Did I catch a chill?

This one... maybe not...
This too...
Oh, we definitely have to check this one out.
Huh? Oh! We have to try this ride, even if we have to wait almost an hour.
What? It could be more than an hour?
Huh, what should we do?
We could...
But Tomo wanna wait that long?
Hmm... No way, these are linked! Then we gotta...


 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:6:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Tomo:
There we go!
Uh-huh.
Yup?
Oh, what's up, Yomi?
Huh? You can't?! But why?
Fever?!

Chiyo:
Huh?
Miss Yomi has a fever?!

Tomo:
She said she got it this morning.

Kagura:
Oh, man, that really sucks for Yomi.

Chiyo:
Then, we should cancel today's trip and go visit Miss Yomi.

Tomo:
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Yes?

Tomo:
Chiyo-chan, you really are such a child.

Chiyo:
Huh?

Tomo:
Listen, if we did that, Yomi might feel all guilty.

Chiyo:
Uh...

Tomo:
Therefore, the right thing to do is leave Yomi alone and have all the fun we can!

Chiyo:
What? Uh, is... it... really?

Tomo:
All right, then I guess it's settled, off we go!

Everyone:
Yay!

Chiyo:
Running on stairs is dangerous, you guys!

Being rowdy on the train platform is dangerous, too!

Tomo:
Let's go!


Yomi:
By now, everyone'll be...
Oh, but maybe they'll come by and try to surprise me with their visit.

Yomi's Mom:
Koyomi, you have a phone call from Miss Takino.

Yomi:
Hello?

Tomo:
Hello? Oh, Yomi?
We're getting on a roller-coaster now!
I'm gonna broadcast it to you live!

Yomi:
Hm!

Yomi:
Okay.

Yomi's Mom:
Koyomi, you have a phone call from Chiyo-chan.

Yomi:
Yes?

Chiyo:
Oh, Miss Yomi, are you okay?
Has your fever gone down?

Yomi:
Yeah, quite a bit.

Chiyo:
You really shouldn't get carried away and fall asleep naked.
Bad girl!

Yomi:
Wha... Wait a sec!
Who told you that?!
Tomo?! Did Tomo say that?!

Chiyo:
What? Um...

Yomi:
Get her on the phone right now!

Chiyo:
All, all right, I'll hand her the phone, please wait one minute.

Yomi:
Sure.

Tomo:
Whoa!

Chiyo:
Um, Tomo...

Tomo:
Hahaha. Man, that was fun!

Chiyo:
Um...

Osaka:
Oh, what's that thing?

Chiyo:
The phone...
Please wait!

Kagura:
What? That thing over there!

Chiyo:
Miss Yomi is on the phone!

Kagura:
Wow, awesome! Did you see that?

Chiyo:
Hello?

Osaka:
That'll kill ya. Just kill ya.

Chiyo:
Hello?

Tomo:
Let's go on that next! Go! Go!


Yomi:
Good morning!

Girl:
Morning, Yomi.

Chiyo:
Good morning.
Miss Yomi, I guess you're better now.
It's too bad about yesterday.

Yomi:
Hm... Well, thanks, Chiyo.
So, did you guys have fun there?

Chiyo:
Ah! Should I tell her honestly that I had a good time? Or should I...

Tomo:
Man, it was the best!
Every attraction they had there was just totally awesome!

Kagura:
Yeah! But there were so many people in line!

Osaka:
Oh, yeah, the crowd was so gigantic and we got tired just from that.

Kagura:
But no matter how much we had to wait, every ride we got on was worth it.

Tomo:
Really, Miss Kagura, ain't that the truth?

Osaka:
Hey, Tomo, where're ya from again?

Come to think of it, Tomo sure was noisy on that one ride.

Tomo:
Oh, that?
The guy in front has been really obnoxious.

Kagura:
Yeah, yeah, and on top of that...
That thing came flying.

Tomo:
Yeah, it had me sweating in the middle of winter.

Hey, It's no laughing... matter!

Kagura:
Now, now.
If we didn't enjoy life as much as we do, you couldn't have laughed it off, even if you wanted to.

Osaka:
You're exactly right.

Tomo:
So, there you go.
You were not coming, it was a really good thing
Huh?

Chiyo:
Ah...

Tomo:
Aaah! Ah!
Yomi's gone mad!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:8:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Chiyo:
Um, Miss Yomi.
About, earlier...

Yomi:
Oh, you don't need to apologize, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Well, um...
This here is the real souvenir.

Yomi:
Thank you, Chiyo.
Wow.

Chiyo:
That creature inside, he is the official mascot of Magical Land.

Yomi:
Oh...
Thank you so much, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Miss Yomi.
Let's all go together next time.
Okay?

Yomi:
Yeah.

Osaka:
Wow.
No wonder it's so cold.

Yomi:
Snow?

Chiyo:
Wow, it is snowing!

Osaka:
Real pretty, isn't it?

I hope it'll pile up.

Yomi:
Yeah.


Tomo:
Wow, so white!

Kagura:
It's awesome...

Osaka:
Huh.

Chiyo:
It's so pretty!

Tomo:
Let's do something! Let's do something! Let's do something!

Kagura:
Snowball fight!

Kagura, Tomo:
Yeah!

Tomo:
Great idea!

Osaka, Chiyo:
Yay! Ah!

Osaka:
Doesn't hurt, even if ya fall.
Aw!

Tomo:
Don't you let your guard down!
Aw!

Kagura:
Exactly!

Tomo:
Now you've done it!

Osaka:
Bombs away!

Chiyo:
It's cold!

Osaka:
I can't hit anyone at all.

Tomo:
Ha! Ha! Ha!

Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki, you're amazing!

Sakaki:
Not really...

Tomo:
Here goes!
Hey!

Yomi:
Hahahaha...
Did you forget?
I've been to Hokkaido!

Tomo:
Oh, really?

Osaka:
Here goes! Hah!

Kagura:
Wow, that was cool!

Chiyo:
Tomo, that's not fair!

Yomi:
Achoo! Achoo!

Chiyo:
What?


Yomi:
Stupid...

Chiyo:
Miss Osaka, what do you wanna do when you grow up?

Osaka:
I haven't really given it much thought.
I'm still living in my youth.
But ya know how they call youth the blue spring?
Are there such things as red springs or yellow springs?
What will they be?

Chiyo:
I don't really know.

Osaka:
Green springs, purple springs, orange springs, light-blue springs...
