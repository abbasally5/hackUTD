 Yomi:
 Hey, Tomo!
 You're not in grade school anymore, so knock it off!

Tomo:
 Hah, hah, but you can't catch me!


Sakaki:
 Ah!

Osaka:
 Oh! What'cha doin', Sakaki?
 Say, looks like you're on the internet.
 Ah!
 Which means you're on the internet. Forget I asked ya.

Chiyo:
 Then, why did you ask?

Osaka:
 Hm?

Chiyo:
 Miss Osaka...

Osaka:
 Oh, there's a dead pikanyaa.

Chiyo:
 No, that's yamapikaryaa, or yamamayaa.
 Did a car...?
 Because I heard traffic accidents were one of the biggest threats to yamamayaa.

Osaka:
 Poor, poor pikanyaa.

Chiyo:
 What's the matter?

Sakaki:
 This cat...
 I have a feeling it's that mother cat.

Chiyo, Osaka:
 Oh!

Chiyo:
 When did the accident happen?

Sakaki:
 The day after our school trip.

Chiyo:
 But I can't tell whether or not it's her, though.

Osaka:
 Poor thing.
 It'd be good if it wasn't her...
 But it's still not good.

Chiyo:
 It's so sad...

Sakaki:
 I wonder if he's okay?


Chiyo:
 Mr. Tadakichi was half asleep this morning.

Sakaki:
 Really?
 Oh, look. The name plate's gone.

Chiyo:
 Uh-huh, the people who lived here moved away.

Sakaki:
 I didn't know.
 Remember there used to be a big cat living here.

Chiyo:
 That's right. Maru.
 He was a big and peculiar cat, wasn't he?

Sakaki:
 Yeah, he was the boss around here.

Chiyo:
 Well, they'll have a changing of the guard!

Sakaki:
 Hm.

Chiyo:
 There are a lot of cats in this area.
 It must be tough to be the boss.

Sakaki:
 Yeah.


Chiyo:
 Timetable time, timetable time. Get it ready early and you'll never have to worry.
 Oh...
 Please promise you be careful around cars and things, okay?
 What? Is something the matter?
 Aw!
 Yeah, you're right. Sorry about that, Mr. Tadakichi.
 I'm the one who needs to be more careful, huh.

 A work sheet. I almost forgot.

Sakaki:
 I wanna go here.
 Although it would be pretty hard to commute to, I guess I'd be living on my own.

 No, wait!
 If that's the case, then having a pet...
 Mm!
 Yeah.
 Mm-hm.

 Kagura:
 I see, so you wanna be an animal doctor, huh, Sakaki?

Sakaki:
 Yeah, but there aren't that many veterinary universities.
 How about you?

Kagura:
 I'm planning to apply somewhere with strong sports program.
 I wanna keep up my swimming after highschool.

Sakaki:
 So do you wanna be a P.E. teacher?

Kagura:
 Haven't really thought much about it, but that's one way to go.

Chiyo:
 Miss Sakaki!
 I brought that cat catalog you wanted.

Sakaki:
 Uh...

Chiyo:
 Here.

Kagura:
 Huh?

Sakaki:
 Thanks, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
 Sure.

Kagura:
 What's this? Are you getting a cat?

Sakaki:
 No, my parents can't handle them. I'm just looking.

Kagura:
 Ooh, so are they cat haters?

Sakaki:
 No, it's my mother. She's allergic to cats, so we can't get one.

Kagura:
 Allergies, huh? I guess it can't be helped then.
 Well, no big deal!
 No cat you got would ever like you!

Chiyo:
 Ah!

Kagura:
 Think positive! Positive!
 Right?!

Sakaki:
 Positive?

Chiyo:
 I'm sure that's not true, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
 When I graduate and go to college, I'm gonna live by myself and get my very own cat.

Chiyo, Kagura:
 Wow...

Kagura:
 But, Sakaki, cats really just hate you.

Chiyo:
 Argh!

Kagura:
 How could you keep one?

Sakaki:
 That's the problem.

Chiyo:
 Miss Sakaki, think positive! Think positive!

Osaka:
 Speakin' of career path, you're goin' to America, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
 Uh-huh.

Osaka:
 Then, what's gonna happen to Mr. Tadakichi?

Chiyo:
 Well, right now, it looks like I'm gonna end up living at a friend's place over there.
 And they said Mr. Tadakichi is welcome to stay.

Osaka:
 Really? Well, that's good.

 The French Mr. Tadakichi, and the Japanese Chiyo-chan, goin' to America...
 It's hard to say who's the foreigner there.

Chiyo:
 Oh...
 Miss Osaka sure is interesting.

Osaka:
 See you tomorrow!

Chiyo:
 Bye-bye now!

Sakaki:
 Bye.

Chiyo:
 Miss Sakaki, you're going to a veterinary university, right?

Sakaki:
 Yeah.

Chiyo:
 You know, it'll be nice if you get to live with a cat too.

Sakaki:
 Yeah... Oh.

Chiyo:
 O-Oh...

Sakaki:
 It's a cat.

Chiyo:
 Wow, it's like there're just so many of them!

Sakaki:
 Uh...

Chiyo:
 Yeah...

Sakaki:
 Um...

Chiyo:
 They're all... so angry, something's wrong!

Sakaki:
 Uh!
 Kamineko!
 I don't really know why, but that cat is always hostile towards me.

Chiyo:
 What?!

 Ah! Cat claws have lots of germs.
 Grandma's hand got scratched, and it swelled out!

Sakaki:
 Chiyo, get back.

 Yamamayaa?!

Chiyo:
 Huh?

 Incredible! He chased them away!

Sakaki:
 Yamamayaa, how did... What are you doing here?
 Ah, are you okay?!

Chiyo:
 He may be weakened or even sick!
 The vet that Mr. Tadakichi goes to is nearby! Let's go there!

Sakaki:
 Right!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:4:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Chiyo:
 Miss Sakaki, in here.
 Doctor!
 Doctor! Dr. Ishihara!

Woman:
Oh, Miss Chiyo Mihama.

Chiyo:
 Oh, please ma'am, this is an emergency!
 We've got to see him right away!

Woman:
The doctor went for a snack...

Doctor:
What's all the ruckus out here?

Chiyo:
 Doctor!

Doctor:
 Ah, Chiyo-chan, you sure have grown.
 You'll break two meters one day.

Chiyo:
 Yes, thanks for the compliments.
 But there's a patient who needs your help.

Doctor:
Oh? Hm...

Chiyo:
 Let's wait here.
 It'll be fine now that Dr. Ishihara is on it, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
 Mm.

Chiyo:
 It's thanks to Dr. Ishihara that Mr. Tadakichi is always so healthy.
 Let's have a seat.

Sakaki:
 Mm.

Chiyo:
 Is that cat really...

Sakaki:
 It is him.
 I'm certain it's the yamamayaa that we met out there on our school trip.

Chiyo:
 That's what I thought.
 Although I'm surprised he was able to find you, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
 Mm.
 That's it. The yamamayaa came to see me.

Doctor:
Oh, Chiyo-chan, you've grown since I last saw you.

Chiyo:
 Yes, sir, thank you very much.

Sakaki:
 How is he?

Chiyo:
 He'll be okay, right?!

Doctor:
Well... he's physically weakened, but he'll be perfectly fine.
Your friend will recover as long as he eats well and gets plenty of rest.

Chiyo,Sakaki:
 Uh.

Doctor:
By the way, that's a strange cat you've got.

Chiyo,Sakaki:
 Uh...

Doctor:
I've been a vet for quite some time, but never seen anyone like him.
He's almost like a... an iriomote...

Sakaki:
 He's a mixed breed.

Doctor:
Hm?

Sakaki:
 Yeah, a mixed breed.

Doctor:
I see.
Mixed, eh?

Sakaki:
 Mixed breed. A Mix. He's a mixed breed.

Doctor:
Is that right, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
 Oh, yes! He's a mixed breed.

Doctor:
I see. Well, go on and take him home.
Take good care of him.

Chiyo, Sakaki:
 Yes.

Chiyo:
 Thanks, Dr. Ishihara!

Sakaki:
 Thank you very much, Doctor.

Chiyo:
 Isn't it great that he's okay?

Sakaki:
 Yeah.

Chiyo:
 So then what now?
 What will you do with him?

Sakaki:
 I'm not sure I really know what the right thing to do is.
 But you know...
 I think he risked his life to come here because he believed in me.
 I think it... must have been really hard.
 I feel like I have to do everything I can, not to let him down.

Chiyo:
 Absolutely.
 But at your place, with your mother...

Sakaki:
 Yeah.

Chiyo:
 I know! Hey, why don't I house him until springtime?

Sakaki:
 What?

Chiyo:
 That way, when you find a place to live on your own, you can come and take him.

Sakaki:
 Are you sure?

Chiyo:
 Yes!

Sakaki:
 Is that okay, yamamayaa?

Yamamayaa:
Meow.

Chiyo:
 Oh, he answered!

Sakaki:
 I know! Mayaa.
 His name's gonna be Mayaa.

Chiyo:
 I wonder if Mayaa will get along with Mr. Tadakichi?

Sakaki:
 I know I can.


Tomo:
 Wow! The yamamayaa came here?! Wow!

Chiyo:
 We've been keeping him in my house for now, right?

Sakaki:
 Mm-hm.

Tomo:
 Sweet! Awesome! Yamamayaa!
 Awesome! Awesome! Yamamayaa!
 Yay! Wow!

Yomi:
 It's awesome, but you're going overboard.

Osaka:
 Then, why don't we go and pay him a visit.
 'Cause you know, it's been a long time.

Tomo:
 Yay! It's Chiyo-chan's, we go!

Osaka:
 Yeah!

Tomo:
 You come too, won't ya?

Yomi:
 Yeah, yeah.

Kagura:
 Yeah, no practice today.

Chiyo:
 So, then it's the six of us.

 Huh? Huh?
 Where's Miss Sakaki?

Osaka:
 Maybe, the bathroom.

Chiyo:
 Outside?! Already?!

Tomo:
 Wow!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:6:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Tomo:
 I guess this is what they call "trooping along", huh.

Kagura:
 Is it hard to take care of him and stuff?

Sakaki:
 Mm-hm. I've read some books for research.

Kagura:
 Wow.

 I see... Hmm...
 The ecology of Nishihyou Island is...

Tomo:
 That's "Iriomote"!

Kagura:
 I did that on purpose!
 I know that!
 It slipped out!

Tomo:
 Which is it?

Osaka:
 The pikanyaa came a long way.

Chiyo:
 I keep telling you it's not pikanyaa.

Osaka:
 Really?
 Pika...
 Pika...
 Pi?
 Pika...
 Pika...
 Pi...

Chiyo:
 Shall we just say that pikanyaa is okay too?

Yomi:
 No, that'll just spoil her.

Tomo:
 Oh!
 Chiyo-chan, will Mr. Tadakichi be okay?!
 He just might get eaten up!

Chiyo:
 Oh, he'll be fine. He's way too big to get eaten.

Kagura:
 Iriomote cats are sometimes even known to hunt and eat full-grown wild boars.

Chiyo:
 Ahhhh!
 We've got to hurry home!
 Hurry, you guys!

Osaka:
 Wait! I'm sure he's gonna be fine!

Tomo:
 Maybe it's too late already!

Kagura:
 All right! The race is on!

Chiyo:
 Don't leave me!
 Come on, you guys, wait for me!
 Wait...

Tomo:
 Is Chiyo-chan coming yet?
 Hm?

 Ah... Oh, no! We didn't make it!

Chiyo:
 Mr. Tadakichi!

Sakaki:
 Mayaa!

Tadakichi:
...

Sakaki:
 Mayaa.

Chiyo:
 Thank goodness you're... Ah!
 Mr. Tada...

Narration:
Azumanga Daioh!

Chiyo:
 Please, come on in.

Osaka:
 Wow, how nice.
 It's a big heated table.
 Can I sit at the heated table?

Kagura:
 I used your bathroom.

Chiyo:
 Please, go ahead.

Tomo:
 Hey, she's already there.

Osaka:
 It's nice. This heated table is nice.
 Oh, hello there, pi... ka...
 Pika... nyaa?

Chiyo:
 Sure, you can call him pikanyaa.

Tadakichi:
...

Tomo:
 Tadakichi, I'm gonna eat you!
 Come on, come on, what are you gonna do? Meow.

Yomi:
 You might wanna stop that.
 Mayaa's gonna get mad at you.

Tomo:
 Huh?
 Ha-ha-ha-ha...

Osaka:
 It's really very comfortable, this heated table sure is nice.

Tomo:
 I am a great iriomote cat!
 Roar! Roar, roar, roar!

Yomi:
 Give it a rest, huh!

Tomo:
 Ah!

Yomi:
 Hm?

Tomo:
 It hurts!

Yomi:
 Wah!

Tomo:
 It hurts! It hurts me!

Chiyo:
 Blood! There's so much blood! Blood!

Yomi:
 See?! what did I tell you?!

Kagura:
 Call an ambulance now!

Sakaki:
 Hey, you can't scratch people.

Yomi:
 No! It's okay!
 Good work!

Kagura:
This is for getting carried away!

Yomi:
 Well, see you tomorrow at school.

Osaka:
 Till we heat again.

Yomi:
 Sakaki?

Sakaki:
 I'm going to stay for a little bit.

Chiyo:
 Tomo, are you okay?

Tomo:
 I hate that cat.

Yomi:
 It's your own fault.
 For once you suffer the consequence.

Kagura:
 Yeah, she is right!

Osaka:
 Well, see ya.

Chiyo:
 Oh, yes, good-bye.

Tomo:
 It hurts.

Yomi:
 It's a good lesson. Learn something from it.

Kagura:
 Yeah, really.

Yomi:
 Moron.

Kagura:
 Moron.

Chiyo:
 That's some scolding just for getting hurt.

Osaka:
 Till we heat again.


 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:8:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Chiyo:
 Miss Sakaki, why don't you stay over tonight?

Sakaki:
 Is that okay?

Chiyo:
 Yes, it's okay.
 Mayya will sleep better if you are here with him.

Sakaki:
 Sure.

Chiyo:
 Then, Miss Sakaki, please go ahead on back to the room, okay?
 I'll make coffee or something.
 Cooking is so fun, cooking is so fun.
 Now it's time to take a break and see what we have done.

Sakaki:
 Soon we'll be together everyday, won't we?
 Mayaa?
 Mayaa.
 Mayaa, you're so cute!

Chiyo:
 Okay, thanks for waiting.
 Um, coffee is ready...

Sakaki:
 Thank you.

Chiyo:
 Uh...

Osaka:
 Chiyo-chan's heated table was nice.

Tomo:
 Damn it, my hand hurts so much.

Yomi:
 And whose fault is that?

Tomo:
 Like hell I'll ever trust an animal again!

Kagura:
 You started it.
 Mayaa didn't like what you were doing to him.

Yomi:
 Look, if you had been nice to him, he wouldn't have scratched you.

Osaka:
 Hey, look. It's a cat.

Tomo, Yomi, Kagura:
 Huh?

Osaka:
 Kitty-nyaa.

Yomi:
 Good, an example! Tomo, come on!

Tomo:
 Huh?

Yomi:
 Here, come on.
 See? Nothing to be afraid of.

Kamineko:
Garrrr.

Yomi:
 Huh?
 Nothing to fear.

Kamineko:
Garrrr.

Tomo:
 What the?!

Yomi:
 That's odd.

Osaka:
 Kitty-nyaa ran away.

Tomo:
 Why the heck were you using my hand?

Yomi:
 I didn't wanna get bitten.

Tomo:
 Uh...

Kagura:
 It's good to have a fear put into you once in a while.

Chiyo:
 Get Mayaa clean, get Mayaa clean,

Sakaki:
 That's a good boy.
 Almost done.

Chiyo:
 He's certainly very well-behaved around you.

Sakaki:
 Huh?

Chiyo:
 You know, I tried to wash him yesterday, but he really fought up a storm.

Sakaki:
 Is that right?
 Here comes rinse.
 Okay, you're all clean now.

Chiyo:
 Are you ready, Miss Sakaki?

Sakaki:
 Mm-hm.

Chiyo:
 Okay, lights out.

Sakaki:
 Mayaa.

Chiyo:
 Miss Sakaki, I guess you really love animals, don't you?

Sakaki:
 I like cute things.
 Because I've always been big, even when I was younger, and I was never cute.

Chiyo:
 That's not true at all.

Sakaki:
 Huh?

Chiyo:
 Earlier when I saw you playing with Mayaa, you were actually very cute.

Sakaki:
 Uh.
 You... think?

Chiyo:
 Yes, you were both very cute, tee-hee.

Sakaki:
 Uh?

Chiyo:
 You know, I think Mayaa thinks of you as his mother.

Sakaki:
 Good night, Mayaa.

Kagura:
It's the entrance exams!

Tomo:

Osaka:
Wow, Tomo, how much did you give?

Tomo:
Five yen!

Everyone:
Oh, God! Please show us your love!

Osaka:
Speakin' of which, are we gonna get to graduate?
