 Osaka:
 What? Goin' to your summer home again this year?

Chiyo:
 Yeah. So, I thought I would invite everybody to come to the house with me.

Osaka:
 That sounds great! I'll go.

Yomi:
 That's next week, right? Okay, got it.

Chiyo:
 There's gonna be a festival going on over there, so please bring your summer kimono with you.

Kagura:
 If it's next week, the team's taking a break, so I can go.

Kaorin:
Next week is the week of the Astronomy Club camp...

Chiyo:
 That's too bad.
 I'll invite you again some other time.

Sakaki:
 You invited me to come along with you?

Chiyo:
 Yes, please, please, please, please say you'll come!

Tomo:
 What?! You're hitting your beach house again this year?!

Chiyo:
 Yes. So, I thought we could all go together like last time...

Tomo:
 Are you bragging?! You're bragging, aren't you?!
 Oh, classic!
 Maybe you're thinking of enjoying a nice bourgeois summer all by yourself, but I'm not gonna let you, damn it!
 Take me with you! Come on! Take me with you!

Chiyo:
 W-Well, that's why I was calling you in the first place, Tomo.

Tomo:
 Oh, then that's fine.

Chiyo:
 All right, let's see, I think I've called everyone now.

Chiyo:
 Yes, Mihama residence.

Yukari:
 Hello? Hey, it's me.

Chiyo:
 Ah, M-Miss Yukari!

Yukari:
 So, we're all getting together at your place, right?
 9:30 sharp. Don't be late, okay?

Chiyo:
 Uh...
 How did she know about it?


Chiyo:
 Oh.

Osaka:
 Hey, Chiyo-chan, where're you goin'?

Chiyo:
 Shopping, to get ready for the trip to our summer home.

Osaka:
 Oh, that's a good idea.
 Think I can come shopping with you then?

Chiyo:
 Certainly. You wanna hop on?

Osaka:
 Sure.

Chiyo:
 Well, here we go.

Osaka:
 Go ahead.

Osaka:
 Maybe I should drive this time.

Chiyo:
 That might be good.

Osaka:
 Here we go.

Chiyo:
 Okay.

 It seems riding in tandem really isn't safe.

Osaka:
 It sure isn't.

Tomo:
 Yo! What's up you two? You're out shopping?

Chiyo:
 Yes, actually we are.

Tomo:
 Yeah, I'm buying too! A super cool swimsuit!

Osaka:
 For your upcomin' beach house trip?

Tomo:
 Yeah.

Osaka:
 So, what kind?

Tomo:
 Hm, one-pieces are nice, but I think I'll have to go with a bikini.
 A really sexy one!
 And for the color I'll... What's the... Um...

Osaka:
 Oh, man, my hands are really full and I can't keep up!

Tomo:
 You don't have to take every single one.

Osaka:
 You say that, but it's kinda hard to refuse them.

Chiyo:
 Yeah, almost impossible.

Tomo:
 You just have to ignore them.
 Keep from making eye contact and...
 I said, don't take any!

Osaka:
 But they are all just so polite.

Tomo:
 How many are you gonna accept?
 I mean you're never gonna use all of that anyway so...
 You're giving them away now?!

 I'm off to the swimsuits.

Chiyo:
 Well, shall we go on over to the outdoor goods section and see what we can find there?

Osaka:
 Yeah, let's go.

 Good. Oh, no good...
 Okay, this time...
 Oh, no way...
 Right, one more time...

Chiyo:
 Miss Osaka!
 Miss Osaka, are you okay?!
 Wha? Wha?

Osaka:
 This is an escalator.

Chiyo:
 This way, it'll be easy to get on, right?

Osaka:
 This is an es... um... elevator.

Chiyo:
 Huh?

Osaka:
 I get mixed up sometimes.
 Elevator and escalator. Escalator and elevator?

Chiyo:
 Oh, really?

Osaka:
 I know it! I do know which one is which, Chiyo-chan!
 Don't you make fun of me.
 So, the box-shaped one is an escalator.
 But that's where I get all mixed up and...
 Um... lemme think...

Chiyo:
 Well, the box-shaped one is an elevator.

Osaka:
 Yeah, yeah, I know that!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:2:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Chiyo:
 Wow!
 It's the perfect weather for going on a trip!
 I better get ready before they start arriving.
 Oh, coming!

Sakaki:
 Morning.

Chiyo:
 Oh, Miss Sakaki, you're here already?
 There's still another hour before everyone's supposed to get here.

Sakaki:
 Yeah. I'll just wait. With Mr. Tadakichi.

Yomi:
 Hey, Chiyo-chan, I finally made it.

Chiyo:
 Oh, okay!

Osaka:
 I didn't get lost this time.

Chiyo:
 I'm so glad!

Yukari:
 Oh, look, hey you guys!

Nyamo
 Is everyone here?

Chiyo:
 Tomo and Miss Kagura should be coming too.

Sakaki:
 Hah... what bliss.

Tomo:
 Morning! I'm here and I'm not late!

Chiyo:
 Hey, welcome you two!

Kagura:
 Man, your house is something else, Chiyo-chan.
 I guess you'd call it a mansion?

Tomo:
 How about it?! Isn't it awesome?!

Kagura:
 Yeah, it is pretty awesome.

Tomo:
 Isn't it? Yeah, I know.

Kagura:
 Just what exactly are you so proud of?

Osaka:
 Hey, Kagura, you've gotten totally tanned.

Kagura:
 Yeah, it's 'cause I'm on the swim team.

Osaka:
 It makes you look like someone who plays it real loose.
 Like some kinda playgirl.

Kagura:
 I-I really look like that?

Chiyo:
 I suppose so.
 There was a group of boys back in grade school who looked like that and played outside all the time.

Osaka:
 Nah, it's a different kinda playin' than that kind.(xxx)

Chiyo:
 Huh?


Yukari:
 Ooh! So, this is our ride for this year's trip!
 Chiyo-chan, you are so thoughtful.
 You went ahead and got a car ready that can fit everybody.

Chiyo:
 I asked my father and he would rent it for us.

Yukari:
 I'm impressed. What a good girl.

Nyamo:
 Yukari, come here a sec.

Yukari:
 Sure thing.

Yomi:
 A countermeasure for the Yukari-mobile?
 Way to go, Chiyo-chan.

Tomo:
 Yukari really is clueless, huh.

Kagura:
 So, what is this "Yukari-mobile" thing?

Tomo:
 See, Chiyo-chan rode in it last year and was deeply psychologically scared for life.

Kagura:
 Mmm... Was it that bad, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
 Oh, no. Nyaow'm(now I'm) completely fine.

Kagura:
 Nyaow?
 Does... does she speed or something?

Chiyo:
 She doesn't speed that much, but there're times she goes too fast and other times, incredibly slow.
 Miss Yukari really should check her sides more often, and her behind.
 Please Miss Yukari, Please look behind you too.
 And sometimes, I get the feeling she doesn't even see the traffic lights or pedestrians.

Kagura:
 So, basically she's totally no good at it?

Yomi, Tomo:
 Mm-hm.

Yukari:
 All right!

Yomi, Tomo:
 Huh?

Yukari:
 I'm driving!
 Everyone, hop on board!

Yomi, Tomo:
 What?!

Yukari:
 Uh...


Kaorin:
If only there weren't any club activities, I could be at the beach with Miss Sakaki right now...

Kimura:
But I'm here!

Kaorin:
Why on earth are you here?!


Chiyo:
 We're here!

Kagura:
 Hey, so this is Chiyo-chan's summer home, huh?
 Not bad, not bad at all.

Tomo:
 Isn't it? Isn't it?!

Kagura:
 Okay, but why are you so proud of it?
 That's what I wanna know.

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:4:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Chiyo:
 Okay, then, I'll open the door now.
 If I were to lose this key right now, we wouldn't be able to get inside the house!

Tomo:
 Iyaaahhh!

Everyone:
Uhhhh...

Tomo:
 I did it.

Yomi:
 But what the hell for?!

Tomo:
 When you hear things like that, it just makes you wanna do it, you know?

Yomi:
 You still should not throw a key, Tomo.

Osaka:
 I don't see it.

Chiyo:
 So many mosquitoes here.

Yukari:
 Sheesh, haven't you guys found it yet?
 What's the deal?

Nyamo:
 Hey, you should be helping out too!

Tomo:
 Hey, you know...

Yomi:
 What is it?

Tomo:
 If I like to find the key and threw it again, it'd be totally hilarious!

Yomi:
 No, it would not!

Osaka:
 Don't see it...

Chiyo:
 All right, I found it!

Yomi:
 Sakaki!

Tomo:
 Ah!

Yomi:
 Now! Go and unlock the door!

Chiyo:
 Yes!

Tomo:
 Damn you! No fair!
 Taking me on three-to-one!

Yomi:
 I need you to shut up!

Chiyo:
 Oh, I'm worried about the rest of the trip.

Osaka:
 Hah... Here at last.

Kagura:
 Wow, it's nice inside too.

Tomo:
 Now that we're inside after all that hard work, it feels especially good, huh?

Yomi:
 Would you please keep your mouth shut?

Chiyo:
 All right, after we get a little rest, let's go out to the ocean!

Everyone:
Yeah!

Girl:
There!

Boy:
Got it!

Girl:
Hahaha.

Boy:
All right!

Girl:
Take that!

Tomo:
 The ocean!
And just like last year, that means watermelon smashing!

Chiyo:
 And we were able to bring a bat this year.

Tomo:
 Just you wait!
 This year, with this lethal right hand, the despicable watermelon will be...
 Huh? Ah!

Kagura:
 I did it!
 Split right in half!
 Huh?

Tomo:
 What have you done?

Kagura:
 What?

Tomo:
 I was gonna smash it...
 Hey, I was gonna freaking smash it!

Kagura:
 Man, don't cry.

Yomi:
 I'm gonna go buy juice.
 Any takers?

Chiyo:
 Me! Cola, please!

Yukari:
 Beer, please!

Nyamo:
 Don't ask for that!

Osaka:
 Oh, yeah, me too!
 I want orange juice!

Sakaki:
 Oolong tea.

Yomi:
 Okay, I'll be back in a bit.

Yomi:
 Thanks for waiting.
 Now, who wanted the orange juice again?


Yukari:
 Say.

Nyamo:
 What?

Yukari:
 The raw ham with a melon, it's one of those tie-in products, right?

Nyamo:
 Better than the sweet and sour pork with pineapple?

Yukari:
 Oh, that's true.

Chiyo:
 Wow, so, what is that you're making?

Sakaki:
 Neco Coneco.

Chiyo:
 Oh...

Sakaki:
Do you think the ears are a little too small?

Osaka:
 I'm back!

Yomi:
 Hey, Osaka, the orange juice is yours, right?

Osaka:
 Oh, that's right.

Sakaki:
 Sorry...

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:6:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Tomo:
 Night time!
 Night time is the right time to party!
 We'll drink and we'll sing!

Chiyo:
 No, no, we have the summer festival before that.
 I told you there'd be one nearby.
 Don't you remember?

Tomo:
 You know what?
 I think she's right!
 Yeah, it's goldfish time!
 I'll catch all of them and release them into the sea!

Sakaki:
 That... That would...

Nyamo:
 Okay, girls, get your summer kimonos.
 We all set?

Everyone:
Yeah!

Osaka:
 Miss Kurosawa, how do we put these on?

Nyamo:
 Huh?
 Um... um...

Chiyo:
 Oh, I can put kimonos on!

Sakaki:
 So can I.

Nyamo:
 Oh, well then, could you maybe teach the rest of us?

Yukari:
 You're useless, Nyamo.
 An adult who asked to learn how to put on a kimono from a kid?

Nyamo:
 Hey, you don't know, either!

Yomi:
 But it's a little unexpected.

Tomo:
 Yeah, Yukari whatever, but I figured Nyamo could hack it.

Nyamo:
 Nyamo, is it?

Yukari:
 Well, it is true.
 It isn't very like Miss Kurosawa, who is so good at putting ties on other people, wouldn't you say?

Nyamo:
 Hm!

Everyone:
What?!

Tomo:
 Wouldn't you learn to do that, Nyamo?!

Yukari:
 Long ago, back when Nyamo was all lovey-dovey, this woman used to practice on me every day knotting and straightening neckties!
 Oh, yes.

Everyone:
Wow.

Nyamo:
 Who... who cares?!
 It was a long time ago!

Yukari:
 Well, it ended up that the fruit of those practice sessions were never put to good use.
 However, she moved onto a new ambition!

Nyamo:
 Ah! Stop!
 What is with you?!
 Maybe you've forgotten what happened that summer three years ago!

Yukari:
 With that Nyamo, can I tell them all about that one thing you hid in your closet four years ago?!

Nyamo:
 Say what....?

Tomo:
 Ooh, they're hitting at each other's old wounds!

Chiyo:
 Okay, is everyone ready?

Everyone:
Yeah!

Chiyo:
 Then, let's go!

Kagura:
 I haven't worn a summer kimono in like, a really long time.

Chiyo:
 Really, Miss Kagura?
 So, is that kimono you're wearing a new one?

Kagura:
 Yeah. I asked my parents if they had any summer kimonos and my dad got real happy and then he bought me this one.

Tomo:
 Hey, hey, hey, did you do that thing, where you pull the sash and twirl around, huh?

Tomo:
 Oh, come on! Come on! Come on!
 Oh, please little lady.

Chiyo:
 You mustn't, Lord Magistrate!

Tomo:
 I call it the "Oh Please Little Lady Game."

Kagura:
 Um, I don't think so.

Tomo:
 Huh?
 That's what I did when I got my summer kimono.

Kagura:
 What's sort of family?

Tomo:
 Octopus balls, fried squids, candied apples!
 I'm gonna eat, eat, eat everything I can!
 I'll even try that lot drawing you can never win!
 Ooh, I wanna do the useless yo-yo balloon fishing, too!

Yomi:
 Don't try to do it all just because you see it.

Chiyo:
 Oh.

Osaka:
 Oh, it's turtle scooping.

Chiyo:
 They're cute, aren't they?

Man:
300 yen a pop!

Chiyo:
 Oh, what do you think I should do?

Osaka:
 Well, when you think 'bout it rationally, you don't really need turtles, huh.

Man:
Uh...

Osaka:
 Sure are cute though.

Chiyo:
 Yes, they are.

Man:
Uh...

Woman:
It's ten shots for 200 yen.

Kagura:
 Oh, do it, Sakaki! Fire!
 Oh, a little more to the right!
 Ooh, so close!
 Hey, you hit it!

Woman:
Here you go. Congratulations.

Kagura:
 Awesome, you did it, Sakaki!
 You totally shot down the Neco Coneco!

Sakaki:
 Huh?

Kagura
 You hunter, you! You crazy sniper!

Sakaki:
 It's not dead, it's not dead!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:8:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Nyamo:
 Okay, listen everyone, it's almost time for lights out, all right.

Tomo:
 What are you talking about?
 The night's still young!

Yomi:
 No, at times like this, if you go to sleep early and get up early, the day will feel longer and it'll feel more like you've profited.

Tomo:
 Ooh, looks like Four-Eyes might actually have a point there!

Yomi:
 Four-Eyes, huh?

Tomo:
 But they do say that getting staying up late is the best part of traveling and...
 Oh, she's plotting to sleep early, so she alone can profit from it!
 Unforgivable!

Yomi:
 No, Tomo, she is 11 years old.

Tomo:
 Shut your mouth!
 I'll handle this!

Chiyo:
 Ah, ah!

Tomo:
 Hahahaha...

Kagura:
 Man, You're mean.

Nyamo:
 Okay, let's everyone go to sleep now, shall we?

Yukari:
 Now, now, wait a minute, Nyamo.
 What's wrong with letting them have one day of freedom?

Tomo:
 That's our Yukarin!
 You sure are understanding!

Nyamo:
 Well, I suppose.
 It'll be okay.

Tomo:
 Yeah! Hurray for Nyamo!
 Now, let's have a toast!

Yukari:
 You're not allowed to have that!
 Honestly, Tomo, where the heck did you get this?
 Well, what's done is done.
 I guess I'll just have to dispose of it all myself.

Nyamo:
 No, you will not!

Yukari:
 Hey!
 Oh, that's okay.
 I actually brought some sake with me!

Nyamo:
You shouldn't be doing that!

Nyamo:
 If I let Yukari drink it all, it'll be a big mess...
 I'll have to take it upon myself and drink it!

Everyone:
Cheers!

Nyamo:
 Ahaha...
 I mean, like who cares about guys?!
 What's wrong with being single?!

Yukari:
 Oh jeez, it's gotten to her.

Tomo:
 Well, this seems like fun in its own way.

Nyamo:
 In the end, being single is the best!
 Hahaha.

Kagura:
 Um, really?

Osaka:
 I wonder if she's okay?

Chiyo:
 I don't think so.

Nyamo:
 Shut up! I'm an adult, you know.

Tomo:
 I have a question.

Nyamo:
 What is it, Tomo?

Tomo:
 When it comes to adult relationships, is it all like pervy and stuff?

Nyamo:
 Yeah, it's pervy and then some!

Tomo:
 Ooh! Like what?!

Nyamo:
 Well, for example...

Chiyo:
 What? Hey, um...
 What did that just mean?

Osaka:
 Shh.
 Be quiet and listen.
 You'll understand it when you grow up.

Chiyo:
 Uh...

Nyamo:
 My head hurts. But why on earth...?
 Oh, Miss Sakaki, good morning... huh?

Chiyo:
 Oh, good morning.
 Are you all right, Miss Kurosawa?

Nyamo:
 Wh-What do you mean?

Chiyo:
 Oh, um, Miss Kurosawa, I have a question for you.

Nyamo:
 Wh-What is it?

Nyamo:
 Mmm... Ah...

Chiyo:
 I don't get it.
 Could you explain it to me?

Nyamo:
 Chiyo-chan, where on earth did you learn about all that?!

Yukari:
 You. From you. Uh-huh.

Everyone:
Oh! Miss Kurosawa, good morning to you!

Nyamo:
 Huh?

Yomi:
 I really wanted to thank you for last night.

Tomo:
 It was extremely educational!

Osaka:
 Miss Kurosawa, I admire you.

Kagura:
 I can't thank you enough, Coach.

Nyamo:
 What? What's this all about, huh?
 Yukari.

Yukari:
 Haha.

Nyamo:
 Huh...
 Hey! What in the world did I do last night?!
 Come on, tell me!


-- Preview --

Yukari:
It's coming up on the second year for the sports fest!
We'll win this year, too!
We'll win, no matter what!

Tomo:
Yukari, you only care about winning against Class 2, right?

Yukari:
Your dreams should be big and boundless.
Our ultimate goal is victory.
Victory, I tell you.

Yomi:
Ooh, she sounds awfully serious this year.

Tomo:
Please tell me, there's food involved?

Yukari:
Ahaha.
You'll have to wait until after you've won to find out!
Watch us against next time!

Yomi:
I knew it.
