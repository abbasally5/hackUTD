 Yukari:
 Now, on next month's schedule is the long awaited school trip.
 Are you looking forward to it, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
 Hahaha...

Yukari:
 Well, that's too bad, because the trip's been cancelled.

Chiyo:
 Ahh!

Yukari:
 I'm kidding, that was a lie.
 She looks so happy, I just couldn't help myself.

Tomo:
 Ma'am! I understand.

Yukari:
 All right, I've got a guidebook for school trips here.
 Let me read a little to you.
 Um, "The school trip is not simply an excuse to have fun."
 "Be fully aware that it is an important supplement to your studies."
 It says that, but we know better right?

Yomi, Tomo:
 Mm-hm.

Yukari:
 But don't think it's gonna be easy!
 Having fun in a town you don't know in a short amount of time may be harder than you realize.
 Some of you are sure to end your trip with regrets.
 But you can't say I didn't warn you!
 Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha....

Chiyo:
 Finally, it's our class's school trip!
 This will be my first school trip ever!

Yomi:
 Oh, that's right.
 You left before you finished grade school, didn't you?

Chiyo:
 Uh-huh.

Tomo:
 Very well.
 Then, I will teach you the rules of going on school trips.

Chiyo:
 What rules?

Tomo:
 You must buy a wooden sword as a souvenir.

Chiyo:
 A wooden sword?!

Tomo:
 And a Shinsen(gumi) livery coat to go with it.

Chiyo:
 A coat?!
 A coat...

Yomi:
 Chiyo-chan...

Osaka:
 Hey, we gotta make a decision on our group.

Chiyo:
 Huh! She said it was six people to a group, right?

Osaka:
 Mm-hm.

Yomi:
 Then, that's me, Chiyo-chan and Osaka...

Chiyo:
 Yes!

Yomi:
 Sakaki and Kagura...

Kagura:
 Hm?

Yomi:
 We can have one group with just five people, can't we?

Tomo:
 Hey, hey, that's harsh, senor.

Yomi:
 Do you wanna take a look at the guidebook?

Chiyo:
 Okay!
 Wow!
 Oh, I can't wait till we get there!

Osaka:
 Uh-huh, I bet it'll be tons of fun.

Chiyo:
 Yup, it sure will!

Tomo:
 At that time, they never would've dreamed it would turn out to be such a miserable trip.
 Or something.

Yomi:
 Enough with the narration!

Chiyo:
 So excited, so excited! One month to go!

Tomo:
 Yeah, what?

Yomi:
 Hello?

Tomo:
 Yomi?

Yomi:
 Tomo, it's almost time for Okinawa.

Tomo:
 Ah!

Yukari:
 So, is everyone here?!
 If you're not, raise your hand!
 Ahaha, Just kidding!

Tomo:
 Me! I'm not here, ma'am!

Yukari:
 But you are!
 Now, I know that our destination is Okinawa.
 But the trip is from now till we get home!

Tomo:
 Ooh! Airport souvenirs!

Yomi:
 Whoa, you're buying already?!

Nyamo:
 Slow down, huh.


Kagura:
 Oh...
 I'm starting to get a little nervous.

Tomo:
 Hm, with this many people, we might not be able to get off the ground.

Tomo, Kagura:
 Ah!

Kagura:
 It's gonna take off!

Tomo:
 Captain?!

Tomo, Kagura:
 Wow! Ahhhh!

Kagura:
 Incredible power!

Tomo:
 This maybe can fly! We can fly!

Tomo, Kagura:
 Ahhhh!

Yomi:
 Shut up.

Tomo:
 Okinawa...
 Okinawa!
 Ahhh!
 The sky's so blue!
 Ahhh!
 Let's move it!

Yukari:
 Just stay cool.

Chiyo:
 Haisai!
 Hahaha...

Osaka:
 Oh, that's Okinawan, huh.

Chiyo:
 Haisai!

Osaka:
 That means "Hello," doesn't it?

Chiyo:
 Ow!
 Yes, what?

Tomo:
 What do you say in Okinawan in times like that?

Chiyo:
 Times like that?

Tomo:
 Yeah.

Chiyo:
 Ow, ow!
 I believe they say "Agaa!"

Tomo:
 Hmm...

Chiyo:
 Ow!


Kagura:
 Ooh, so this is the Shureimon Gate.

Tomo:
 Yeah, I bet money on it.

Chiyo:
 It is the gate.

Kagura:
 Oh, wow! A 2,000 yen bill!
 Cool...

Yomi:
 Wow.

Osaka:
 You're right, it looks exactly like it.

Chiyo:
 The Shureimon Gate is also in the watermark.

Kagura:
 Huh?

Chiyo:
 It is!

Everyone:
Oh...

Osaka:
 Oh, they got shiisaa here!
 Hey, Chiyo-chan, how would you ask someone in Okinawan.
 Is that a shiisaa?

Chiyo:
 "A-re shiisaa yaibiimi?", yeah.

Osaka:
 Shiisaa yaibiimi?

Chiyo:
 Uree shiisaa yaibiin.

Chiyo:
 Six high school students, please!

Tomo:
 Yeah! Let's go!
 Okinawa! Okinawa! Okinawa!
 Boom, boom!

Osaka:
 Wow...
 They got shiisaa lined up here too.
 Let's see, um...
 Shiisaa yaibiin.
 Shiisaa yaibiin.
 Shiisaa yaibiimi?

Chiyo:
 A-re shiisaa aibiran!

Everyone:
Okinawa! Okinawa! Okinawa! Okinawa!
Okinawa! Okinawa! Okinawa! Okinawa!
Okinawa! Okinawa! Okinawa! Okinawa!

Yomi:
 Shut up.

Tomo:
 It's the hotel!

Kagura:
 Yeah!

Tomo:
 It's dinner time!

Osaka, Chiyo:
 Yeah!

Tomo:
 Buffet!
 It's a Buffet!

Yomi:
 Limiter override!

Tomo:
 Oh, it's on!

Yomi:
I'm gonna eat this. And I'm gonna eat this too!

Tomo:
 There! And there, and there, and there!

Osaka:
 Ooh, this is all champloo, right?

Chiyo:
 Right.
 We're in Okinawa, so this is required eating!

Osaka:
 Yeah.
 Bitter melon champloo.
 Wheat-gluten bread champloo.
 Fine noodle champloo.
 Let's see, let's see, let's see...

Chiyo:
 Hm?

Osaka:
 Let's see, let's see...
 Champloo!
 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:4:&lt;h1&gt; 

Yomi:
 First, Shurijo Castle, now Manzamou.
 I sure am glad we're getting to hit all the highlights.

Kagura:
 Yahoo!

Chiyo:
 The cliffs and the sea...
 It's just so terrifying!

Tomo:
 Chiyo-chan!

Chiyo:
 Uh...

Tomo:
 Up we go!

Yomi:
 Tomo, cut it out!

Kagura:
 Chiyo-chan!

Osaka:
 Chiyo-chan!

Kagura:
 Moron!

Tomo:
 Man, that was terrifying!

Yomi:
 Chill out, Osaka, it's over.

Osaka:
 Huh?

Yukari:
 Your attention please!
 Recreational diving is up next!
 For this activity, I'll be joining for it with your group, okay?

Everyone:
Yeah!

Yukari:
 This is my first time!
 I'm super stoked!
 How about you, huh?

Chiyo:
 Oh, I've actually done it before, but you know...

Yukari:
 Come on, let's toss this brat into the sea!
 And a one, and a two...

Yukari, Tomo:
 The ocean, the ocean, the ocean,
 ocean, ocean, ocean!

Kagura:
 Wow, that was really fun!

Sakaki:
 Yeah.

Tomo:
 Yeah! It was like super fun!

Kagura:
 Are you kidding?!
 "Super" can't even start to describe it!
 No, the word is... awesome...

Chiyo:
 Huh?

Kagura:
 It was awesome fun!


Tomo:
 What should I get for a souvenir?

Tomo:
 Chinsuko!

Yomi:
 Huh?

Tomo:
 It's chinsuko!

Yomi:
 Are you gonna buy it?

Tomo:
 It's chinsuko!
 It's chinsuko!
 Chinsuko!
 See, chinsuko!
 Chinsuko!

Yomi:
 Just shut up...

Sakaki:
 Hm...

Chiyo:
 Oh, these little shiisaa are so cute!

Sakaki:
 Huh!
 Those ARE really nice.

Chiyo:
 Each of their faces is just a little bit different, so they really have that handmade feel.

Sakaki:
 This one. No way, this one?

Chiyo:
 I'm gonna get this one!

Sakaki:
 Huh!

Osaka:
 Shiisaa yaibiin.

Chiyo:
 Huh?
 Miss Osaka! Miss Kagura!

Kagura:
 Yo.

Osaka:
 Hey, Chiyo-chan!


Yomi:
 Hey, what's the matter?

Tomo:
 It smells good.

Yomi:
 Huh?

Tomo:
 Sniff, sniff, sniff...

Yomi:
 What are you doing now?

Tomo:
 Oh!

Chiyo:
 Tomo!

Kagura:
 Yo!

Osaka:
 Hahaha...

Tomo:
 Ooh, what's that? Something sweet?!

Osaka:
 Saataa andagii.

Tomo:
 Candy?!

Chiyo:
 I'm sorry, we didn't buy any for you two...

Osaka:
 Saataa andagii.

Tomo:
 How much was it?

Chiyo:
 100 yen.

Osaka:
 Saataa andagii.

Tomo:
 Where did you get it?

Osaka:
 Saataa andagii.

Tomo:
 Oh, shut up! Man!

Osaka:
 Saataa andagii.

Tomo:
 So, like I said!

Osaka:
 Saataa andagii.

Kagura:
 What's that?

Yomi:
 Oh, this is...

Tomo, Osaka:
 Saataa andagii!

Yomi:
 No, it's not!

 Kaorin:
Miss Sakaki!
Hey, good morning!

Sakaki:
 Morning.

Kaorin:
So, which island are you going to for the day trip?
We're going to Miyakojima Island.

Sakaki:
 I'm going... to Iriomote cat!

Kaorin:
Huh? Oh, Iriomote Island.
I hope you enjoy it!

Sakaki:
 I will.
 Ah...

Kaorin:
Uh... What?

Sakaki:
 That t-shirt...

Kaorin:
Oh, I bought it at a shop over there.

Sakaki:
 No, no, look there...

Kaorin:
Huh?

Kimura:
Uh...

Kaorin:
I'm gonna go change!

Sakaki:
 Uh...


Tomo:
 Oh, wow! I see it! I see it!

Chiyo:
 I'll go over the plan one more time, okay?

Yomi:
 Sure.

Chiyo:
 We'll take a walk from Ohara Harbor, go to the Wildlife Center, go all the way around to get on a tour boat, go down to Urauchigawa River, and see the Mariyudo Waterfall.
 After that, we'll buy souvenirs at Uebara and go home.

Yomi:
 Well, in any case, let's be careful not to miss the boat back to the main island.

Chiyo:
 Yes, of course.

Osaka:
 Wow, so that's it...
 the island...

Tomo:
 Iriomote!

Yomi:
 Everyone, ready?

Chiyo:
 I'll take one with you.

Yomi:
 Wildcat...
 Wildcat...

Tomo:
 "Wildcat area. Please take care and slow down."
 Hear that? Wildcats!

Kagura:
 Oh, that's awesome!

Osaka:
 Well, then, we better do what it says and slow down too.

Yomi:
 You should be fine...

Tomo:
 You think we'll see an iriomote cat?!

Sakaki:
 Uh-uh, it's probably impossible.

Tomo:
 Hm?

Sakaki:
 I know I really shouldn't be getting my hopes up.
 Not to mention these are wildcats.
 I might not get off so easy.

Chiyo:
 Let's hope they have some cute wildcat stuff at a gift shop.

Sakaki:
 Yes.

Tomo:
 Oh, man, so we're not gonna get to see any?

Kagura:
 Well, with Sakaki here, we might be able to get one to bite if she stuck her hand out.

Sakaki:
 Like this?

 Hm! Ah...

Osaka:
 Sakaki is just like a frog bein' stared down by a snake.

Tomo:
 Well, you know the drill, Kagura!

Kagura:
 Roar!

Chiyo:
 No, wait you guys!

Everyone:
Huh?

Chiyo:
 Those somewhat tiger-like features!
 The short legs and a thick tail!
 Those two rounded ears!
 And the mottled pattern on its fur!
 Yamapikaryaa!
 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:8:&lt;h1&gt; 
 Yomi:
 Yamapikaryaa?

Chiyo:
 Yes.
 Yamapikaryaa is how they refer to iriomote cats in the local language!

Osaka:
 Yamapikaryaa?

Chiyo:
 Mm-hm.

Yomi:
 Huh...

Kagura:
 What the...?

Sakaki:
 Ah!

Chiyo:
 Oh, he's taken a liking to Miss Sakaki!

Everyone:
Wow!

Kagura:
 Hey, you can pet him!

Tomo:
 All right, Sakaki, go for it!

Kagura:
 Yeah, pick him up! Big hug!

Kagura, Tomo:
 Go!

Chiyo:
 He's so cute! He's still a kitten, isn't he?

Sakaki:
 Yamamayaa.
 Yamamayaa!

Chiyo:
 Yamamayaa also means wildcat!

Osaka:
 Uh-huh.

Osaka:
 Yamapikaryaa!
 Yamapikaryaa!

Chiyo:
 I guess he'll look like that when he grows up too, huh.

Sakaki:
 Mm-hm.

Osaka:
 And then, look like that.

Chiyo:
 Ah....

Osaka:
 Well, talk about all bony.

Kagura:
 Oh, there's a snake swimming!

Tomo:
 Oh, no way!

Tomo, Kagura:
 Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!


Chiyo:
 I guess it's goodbye.

Sakaki:
 In the end, I know we really shouldn't take him home with us.
 I can't keep cats at home, so...
 Not to mention the fact that you're a special national monument.
 You can't come with us!

Chiyo:
 Miss Sakaki...

Sakaki:
 The mother cat?


Tomo:
 Huh? Airport souvenir...

 Spice Tea! Turmeric!
 Spice Tea, spice Tea, spice Tea, spice Tea, spice Tea, spice Tea!

Yomi:
 Shut up!

Chiyo:
 Okinawa certainly was fun!

Osaka:
 It sure was, wasn't it?

Chiyo:
 Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
 Hm?

Chiyo:
 Wouldn't it be nice to come back, tee-hee?

Sakaki:
 Yeah.
 One day, I will.

Yukari:
It's coming, it's coming. It's creeping up.
Look, it's almost here.

Osaka:
Huh? What? Something's comin'?

Yukari:
What do you think?!
Entrance exams! College entrance exams!

Osaka:
Where? Where's it comin'?

Tomo:

This time will be an entrance exam study camp!
We'll swim! We'll have fun!
We'll smash watermelons!
