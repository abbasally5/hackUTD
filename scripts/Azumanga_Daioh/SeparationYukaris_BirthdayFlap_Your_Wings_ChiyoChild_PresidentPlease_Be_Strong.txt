 Osaka:
I can't get it off...

Chiyo:
Hello, Miss Osaka, good... good morning.

Osaka:
Oh, Chiyo-chan, you just saved me.

Chiyo:
Today, we're finally third year students.
Let's go do our best!

Osaka:
Oh, yeah!
Our best for sure.

Osaka:
Uh...

Chiyo:
Huh?

Osaka:
Not good.
Havin' to go to the third floor everyday, I'm gonna lose heart.

Chiyo:
Boy, that was quick.

Chiyo:
Good morning, everyone!

Osaka:
Mornin' y'all.

Yomi:
Hey, you two!

Osaka:
I guess we're all together again.

Chiyo:
Wait, where are Tomo and Kaorin?

Yomi:
Tomo's coming.
Kaorin went to another class.

Chiyo:
Oh, I see then.
That's too bad.

Tome:
Hey, hey, everyone, good Morning!

Osaka:
Oh!

Chiyo:
Tomo, you cut your hair?

Tomo:
Yup, Just yesterday,
What?
Are the spring fairies themselves bewailed by my graceful new charm?

Chiyo:
Uh...

Tomo:
After all, I've become a third year now.

Chiyo:
But it's like she's reverted to being a first year.

Chiyo:
Oh, did you get dumped by... uh...

Yomi:
Hahaha.
No way, no way!

Chiyo:
I didn't think so.

Chiyo:
Why did you cut all of it off?

Tomo:
Something about this bugs me, but oh well.
Last year, I was growing it out, kinda going for a sexy look, you know.
Basically, I was aiming for the Fujiko look.

Yomi:
Huh?

Chiyo:
Fujiko?

Kagura:
Aim for her look?
But you're not anything like her to begin with.

Tomo:
Well, except for my bust size, I came pretty damn close.

Kagura:
How so?

Tomo:
Lupin!

Everyone:
Ah....

Tomo:
Tha.. that's why I gave up trying to go the Fujiko route!

Kagura:
Yeah.

Tomo:
But at least I could try to shoot for Ayu.

Chiyo;
At least?

Yomi:
Chiyo-chan, it's okay to be angry with her.


Yukari:
I'm Yukari Tanizaki, Class 3 homeroom teacher.
This year, all of you are now studying for entrance exams.
I'm sure it'll be a rough stressful time for you.

Tomo:
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

Yukari:
But it's even rougher on people in the work force.
Don't come looking for pity.



Classmates:
Sigh...



Yukari:
And don't you dare act like you're some tragic victims of the modern education system!

Osaka:
What's her to you?
She seems a little riled up today.

Chiyo:
Really?

Yukari:
I mean, look, if you don't wanna study, then don't go to college.
It's pretty freaking simple.
Huh...

Tomo:
Hey, so did you go to college because you wanted to study?

Yukari:
Hah! You're right like hell.

Osaka:
I wonder if maybe she's got some deep psychological scar.

Chiyo:
Isn't she always like this, though?

Yukari:
Listen up.
You guys have only your own entrance exams to worry about and that's it.
I, on the other hand, have to think about the entrance exams of several dozen people!

Osaka:
I wonder if Yukari is really suited to be a teacher.

Kagura:
Say that and you've left her no hope.

Yukari:
Maybe I just won't think about them...

Chiyo:
Now what were we talking about at the beginning of class...?


Kimura:
I'm Kimura, and I'm the homeroom teacher of Class 4 for this year.

Boy:
Congratulations!

Yukari:
Hm?

Students:
Happy birthday!

Nyamo:
What? Really?! Oh, thank you!

Girl
Please will you open it, ma'am.

Nyamo:
Sure.
Uh.

Yukari:
Kurosawa!
What did they get you?

Nyamo:
Handbag...

Yukari:
Wow...
Yeah, well, I've got some handbags of my own!

Nyamo:
I'm sure.

Yukari:
You know, you're better off not having handbags anyway!

Nyamo:
Why is that?

Yukari:
She is a bad person!

Nyamo:
Huh?

Yukari:
I'm an adult, you hear me!
There's nothing fun about birthdays!

Yomi:
Man, even through the wall...

Chiyo:
Now that I think of it, last year was the same.

Yomi:
We didn't get her a gift.

Osaka:
Nyamo, she got somethin' last year too.

Yukari:
What is it, Nyamo?
You're all smiles.

Nyamo:
Huh?
Hang on. See these?
The kids in my class all fetched and gave them to me as a birthday present.
Sometimes I worried that they feel like it's something they have to do.
But it still makes me happy.
What's wrong?

Yukari:
What the hell is with you?!
Do you think you've become the teacher in some youth drama?!

Nyamo:
What are you so mad about?

Osaka:
Yukari's actin' kinda weird today, don't you think.

Kagura:
Yeah, she's never this quiet...

Yukari:
Oh, that's right.
Miss Kurosawa, who teaches next door, apparently got a birthday present from the kids in her class.

Chiyo:
Miss Yukari, so, when is your birthday coming up,

Yukari:
It's already passed.

Tomo:
So, what now?
Yukari's birthday always falls during spring break.

Kagura:
Well, let's get her something, even if it's late.

Yukari:
Who the hell needs presents anyway?!

Everyone:
We're sorry.


Kimura:
Happy birthday, huh?


Yukari:
Good morning.

Chiyo:
Excuse me, Miss Yukari.

Yukari:
Huh?

Chiyo:
We know it's late, but this is a birthday present from all of us in the class.

Yukari:
Huh?
Are, are, are you...
Are you telling me to go give this to Nyamo?!

Chiyo:
No! This is for you, Miss Yukari!

Yukari:
This is a present... for me?

Chiyo:
Mm-hm.

Yukari:
Happy, happy birthday, baby oh,
Happy birthday to me!
Happy, happy birthday, dear Yukari,
Happy freaking birthday to me!

Chiyo:
She is happy, right?

Yomi:
Mm-hm.

Chiyo:
Huh?

Yukari:
Oh, so it's a handbag.
I'm gonna go out for a bit!

Kagura:
She's gone to show it off to Class 2.

Osaka:
Well, you know, it's really great that she's happy 'bout it.


Yukari:
Hm!

Kimura:
It's a happy birthday.
Happy happy birthday.
Oh, happy birthday, Kimurin!

Yukari:
Kimurin?

Kimura:
You look really pretty today.

Yukari:
Okay?
 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:4:&lt;h1&gt; 

Tomo:
Ooh, what's that?
Career paths?

Chiyo:
Yes. We are third years, after all.

Kagura:
Mm-hm.
And that is why we're studying for entrance exams.
/That's right, we're students studying for entrance exams now.

Tomo:
Exams?

Kagura:
Yeah, so what about it?

Tomo:
Oh, you're hoping for a sports scholarship?

Kagura:
Shut up!
What are you gonna do for your career?!

Tomo:
Huh? Who me? The ICPO.

Kagura:
The ICPO?

Tomo:
Duh like Interpol!

Kagura
Whoa!

Tomo:
International police!

Kagura:
Whoa, that's crazy!
Are you like a kid or something?!
But does such a thing really exist?
I always thought it was just a movie.

Tomo:
It's not real?!

Chiyo:
Actually, there is an ICPO.

Tomo:
See? It really does exist!

Kagura:
So, how do you go about joining them?

Tomo:
Dunno!

Chiyo:
I wonder though, do you become a police officer first and then you get chosen from there?

Tomo:
What?! Is that how it's supposed to work?!

Chiyo:
I don't know for certain.

Kagura:
For someone, who wants to be a part of it, you should have known much.

Osaka:
I see, Tomo's gonna be a police officer, huh.

Tomo:
Didn't you hear me?
I said, ICPO.

Osaka:
Oh, yeah! Speakin' of police, there's somethin' I've been wonderin' about for long time.

Tomo:
Listen when I'm talking.

Osaka:
Just what do they have written in their police pocketbook?!

Does it have an address book or memo notebook attached to the back or something?

Tomo:
Hey, now that you mention it...

Osaka:
I know it's got the suspect's address and phone number.

Tomo:
Wow, awesome!

Kagura:
Yeah, whatever, dream on!

Tomo:
Well, then...
Maybe it's got a photo of the person they like in there?

Osaka:
A photo of the policewoman they like or print club stickers.

Tomo:
What? A policewoman?!

Osaka:
It'll be rough if a policeman ends up falling for ya.

Tomo,Kagura,Chiyo:
Huh?

Osaka:
You know, they tail people and stuff like that.

Tomo:
That wouldn't be good.

Yomi:
Hey, whatever happened to the ICPO?


Kagura:
Chiyo-chan, you've got a university you like?

Osaka:
Tokyo University?

Chiyo:
Well, actually, I was thinking about flying overseas somewhere.

Kagura:
What? Overseas?

Chiyo:
Yes, I hear that American schools are used to accepting children who have skipped some grades.

Kagura:
Awesome!
You're gonna study abroad, huh?
Sasaki, Ichiro, and next up batter is Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
I say that's a little bit different.

Kagura:
Chiyo-chan's studying abroad.
Amazing?

Tomo:
Mm-hm, Amazing.

Chiyo:
No, really,

Tomo:
She's gonna die.

Osaka:
Hm.

Chiyo:
Ah!

Osaka:
You know, 'cause your family's rich and you're so tiny.
And you're easy to catch.

Kagura:
When you put it that way...

Chiyo:
But if it ever comes to that, Mr. Tadakichi will protect me!

Osaka:
Bang!
Mr. Tadakichi's been shot.

Chiyo:
Ah?!
Then what am I supposed to do after that?

Osaka:
Oh, put your genius to good use like they would in the television drama, make one last futile stand, and then you get killed.

Chiyo:
What?!

Sakaki:
Don't worry.
If it ever comes to that, you can count on your father.

Chiyo:
My father?

Chiyo:
Somebody save me!

Chiyo Papa:
Halt, I say!

Sakaki:
I know he'll fly to your rescue.

Chiyo:
You really think so?

Osaka:
Bang!

Chiyo:
What?! My father too?!

Sakaki:
Don't worry, he deflected the bullets!

Osaka, Chiyo:
What?!

 Yomi:
But going to study abroad in America?
Have you asked your parents if it's okay?

Chiyo:
Yes. They said it would be good for me to see more of the world.

Osaka:
Let your darlin' children go travel.

Chiyo:
Hm?

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan, you're darlin'.
Travel's okay!

Chiyo:
Hahaha...

Tomo:
All right, since you're doing this, let's make you president!

Chiyo:
That's not possible.

Tomo:
We'll make America Chiyo-chan's country!
When you are Pres. give me Hawaii.

Chiyo:
Like I said, it's not possible.

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan's own country, huh?
I'd wanna visit some time.

Yomi:
I bet she's thinking something weird again.
Uh?

Osaka:
Uh, so, this is America!

Chiyo:
Hello!
Hello there! Hello there! Hello there! Hello there!
Welcome to our country!
Welcome!

Osaka:
I just can't believe how cute all the little bitty Chiyo-chans are.

Chiyo:
We'll carry your luggage!
We will! We will!

Osaka:
Are you sure?
Thanks a whole lot!

Chiyo:
Let's be on our way!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

Osaka:
That'd be nice...


Chiyo:
Oh, was it okay for us to let Miss Osaka go like that?

Yomi:
She probably won't be back for a while.

Tomo:
Mm-hm.

Chiyo:
Oh, their pork buns are supposed to be delicious!

Yomi, Tomo:
Huh?

Yomi:
Well, if anyone knows about good food.

Tomo:
What about pizza buns or gratin buns?

Chiyo:
They only sell pork buns!

Tomo:
Yes! I think I'll buy a snack for the trip home!
Wow, that was fast!

Tomo:
Hey...

Yomi:
What do you want?

Tomo:
Oh, nothing, nothing.

Yomi:
They don't use sugar or stuff in pork buns, so it's okay.

Tomo:
Well, well, how convenient for you, huh.

Oh, yummy!

Chiyo:
It sure is delicious!

Tomo:
It's gotta be 100% beef all the way!

Yomi:
Pork, dummy!

Chiyo:
That was really tasty.

Yomi:
You just can't beat a good pork bun.

Tomo:
Yeah, well, I couldn't live without octopus buns.

Chiyo:
I've never had that kind of bun.
Do they actually have those?

Tomo:
These days, they have everything.
So, what's your favourite food, Chiyo-chan? Shark fins?
They have shark fin buns.

Chiyo:
Let's see...

Oh, I like meatballs!

Tomo:
Uh-oh, we've got a kid here!

Chiyo:
I am not a kid!

Tomo:
You're a kid, you're a kid! You're a real little kid!

Chiyo:
Then, what kind of food do you like?!

Tomo:
Hm?
Ah, bananas, I guess.

Yomi:
Whoa, there's a moron here!

Tomo:
Why... Why do you say that?!

Miruchi, Yuka:
Chiyo-chan!

Chiyo:
Huh?
Miruchi! Yuka!

Yomi:
Who are they?

Chiyo:
My classmates from back in grade school.

Miruchi, Yuka:
Good afternoon.

Yomi:
Wow, so, you would be in middle school already.

Chiyo:
What are you saying?
I'm a high school student.

Miruchi:
Guess what?
Now, we've got our own sailor uniforms to wear.

Chiyo:
Wow! I never got to wear those.
You're so lucky.

Yuka:
But I'll never get to wear the uniform you're wearing either because your school is tough to get in.

Miruchi:
You really must be very good at school.

Tomo:
Mm-hm.

Yomi, Chiyo:
Wha..?!

Yomi:
Our school allows for quite a bit of freedom, so we do get people who skip classes and fail out too.

Yuka:
Yeah?

Tomo:
Hey, don't look at me.

Yomi:
Some even get into Tokyo University, and another can't get in anywhere.

Tomo:
Hey, don't look at me.

Chiyo:
Hm...

Miruchi
Bye-bye!

Yuka:
See you later!

Chiyo:
Bye-bye!

Thanks for waiting.

Tomo:
You weren't talking about...

Yomi:
I was.

 Kimura:
Now, for this part...
Um... you Kaorin,

Kaorin:
Would you please not call me that?

Kimura:
But that's what everyone calls you...

Kaorin:
Then why am I the only one in class being called by a nickname?!

Kimura:
Um... okay, from now on, you may call me Kimurin.
How's that?

Kaorin:
That's not my point!

Yomi:
Just like that you became the class Rep?

Kaorin:
More like I was made to than really became...

Yomi:
What? Like bullying?

Kaorin:
No, I think... just the opposite.

Yomi:
Huh?

Boy:
Well, since we still don't have any candidates so far, we should go ahead make nominations.
So, can anybody think of someone they'd like to nominate?

Kimura:
Me! I think Kaorin would do a great job!

Any more nominees?

Kaorin:
You see, Kimura likes me!

Yomi:
It's worse than I thought!

Kaorin:
So, I'm stuck with him for the entire year...
Huh?
Miss Sakaki still is cool as ever!

But why? Why am I the only one who's in a different class?!

Sakaki:
I got to see you again today.
I'm so happy.

Kaorin:
Why? Why am I the only one who's in a different class?!
Everybody...

Kimura's wife:
Excuse me...

Kaorin:
Huh? Ah!

Kimura's wife:
I'm sorry.
Could you please give me directions to the faculty office?

Kaorin:
It's Kimura's wife.

Kimura's wife:
I apologise, see the thing is, my husband left his lunch at home again.
I guess he's rather absentminded.

Kaorin:
The "love wife lunch"!

Kimura's wife:
I've come here before, but I always seem to forget no matter how hard I try.

Kaorin:
To get to the faculty office, go in there, go up the stairs, and it's at the back of the second floor.

Kimura's wife:
Thank you.

Kaorin:
Mm-hm.

Kimura's wife:
Aw!

Kaorin:
Such a good person.
Yes, that's right.
If he has a good person like her for a wife, then Mr. Kimura must have his good points too.

Kaorin:
I've got a whole year with him as my homeroom teacher, so I'm gonna find those good points!
Huh?

Kaorin:
Tending a garden?
He's never shown a side like that before.
Hm?

Kimura:
Oh, hello there, Kaorin.

Kaorin:
Ah, hi!
So, you like gardening, Mr. Kimura?
What kind of flower...
Ah!

Kaorin:
Good points...
Good points...
Like hell I'm gonna find any!
