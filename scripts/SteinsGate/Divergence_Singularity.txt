  Cursed be these hands... what granted you life!
Now honor our sulphurous contract... writ in blood!
Let the ebon flames burn black!
Fullfill my wish, O beast!

Ahhhhh!
How'm I gonna heat up my chicken tenders now?!

You can expect this level of disregard for your things.
You might wanna run for it.

Don't be a butthead!
You should say that you're sorry, then go out and buy me a new microwave!

Surely not in this economy?
No photographs! I was very clear on that!

A keepsake.

Huh?

Shining Finger!

Check it, ladies, the upgrade is complete!
Phone Wave Mark II Version 1.03 is ready to rock your world!
Thanks to the heroic efforts of yours truly, we can now shuttle D-mail to any number we feel like!

Excellent work, my friend!

We should get back to the experiment, then.

Is it really a.. time machine?

You're not to breath a word of it to anyone.

I sure do hope Mr. Praun doesn't get mad at us again..

Part-time girl!

Hello down there!

Hi!

Too-too-roo!

This is no time for too-too-!
Where's Mr. Braun?

Who's that?

Daddy's name isn't Mr. Braun..

Oh, you're talking 'bout the big boss-man.
I think he's been out on a house-call for most of the afternoon.

House call?

Why you think I'm fiddling with my bike?

Now, Mayuri.

It's real.

Hey... what was that?

I betcha some juicy chicken tenders would go really well with all this.

Huh? Hold on! Where's the bag with my soda?!

Sorry. Sold out.

The you beat a path from store to store till you find it!

I wouldn't have to explain this to an assistant worth her salt!

I'm not gonna schlep all over town just to get you soda!
Here.

Hand it over.
I'm a mad scientist, not some shriveled octogenarian mewling about his fiber intake.
Let the round table now assemble!

Just a sec, man.. I'm gettin' the sweats.

What in the nine hells do you think you're doing?
You want the Organization to hear this?
Why not invite them in?

Yeah, whatever.

Starting now, Operation Wyrd goes into the second phase of experimentation, which will allow us to gauge D-mail's effect.

Barley tea's so good in the summer!
You want some, Moeka?

Okay, so what kind of experiments are you thinkin' of?

We are going to change the past.

No way. We are not taking that kind of risk!
What if it results in a time paradox?

Then so be it!
Any true mad scientist would absolutely kill to know if D-mails can really alter the past.
You disappoint me, Assistant.

I... I just think..

How are you gonna prove it, Okarin?

Thank you so much for asking.
By virtue of a single event, the occurrence of which will brook no doubt.

Picking the winning numbers in the lottery!

Okarin... I'm disappointed in you.

Dude, sick! I'm totally rolllin' up to the curb at Queen May's in the earthbound equivalent of a Star Destroyer!

Instead of being Greedy Gus'es, wouldn't it be a lot nicer if we tried to make world peace happen?
We could give everyone on Earth an oopa cushion!

Seriously, man... Way to be a total jackass.

I'm trying to see if I can alter the blasted pat, woman!
We need a quantifiable change!

And that's the first thing you could think of?

Quiet, Little Miss Moneybags!

'Moneybags'..? What the hell?!

Well that's what you really are.
Lounging in some opulent hotel room your parents are paying for.
"Let them ear cake!" eh there, Antoinette!?

Don't you have a lotto to fix?

Makise's right. We should figure that out.
Which one should we win, though?

Which one, indeed...

What's the matter?

Not sure...
Where is Double-O Five?

Donno.

What're you doing?!

There ya go.

Can't take my eyes off of you for a second, can I?

I texted... You never replied.

Dude, smoking hot aside, what a space-cadet.

Christina! You are hereby tasked with preventing her from wandering off!

Huh? Hey! I'm not your guard god.

Poor Moeka, stuck on the couch.
Would you like me to give you the grand tour of the lab?
It really is a whole lot of fun!

If you don't believe me, just ask Kurisu!
Hmmm... now where to start...

How 'bout the Lotto 6? It looks juicy.

They've just announced this week's winning numbers.
So now we send them into the past... and see what happend.

You're really going to do this?

If you've better idead, speak up.

The numbers're right here, so we can do it whenever.
Looks like the current jackpot's at... Two-hundred million!

Two-hundred million?

Whoa, Daru! Hold on!

That's a little much, yeah?

Say wha?

Well... hitting a jackpot of that size would only server to... draw unwanted attention to ourselv--

What a total chicken.

Second prize?

Oh, good call. Only twenty-three million.

What's third?!

Seven-hundred thousand.

Perfect-that-one-yes!

Good form there, fearless leader.

This from the girl who's quailing in her boots at the thought of--

This is an oopa cushion!
if you ever feel oogy and you need to some cheering up... just-give-'em a big hug!

Next stop! The lab refrigerator!

What's inside you today?

May I?

Time to earn your keep, Double-O Five.
Here's your very first Future Gadget Lab assignment.

Oh! This is exciting!

I would like you to compose the D-mail message.
Some thing that will convince the ignorant me of a week ago to buy a ticket with the number we've provided.

Seven days is... 168hours. Cool if I round up?
That'll do.

Short and sweet.

Okay. Ready when you are.

Stein's gate will finally swing open to admit me!

Not that again. Give the crazy day off.

You're remarkably close-minded for a scientist!

You look like your were... both having fun.

Fun?

Dealing with this nut-case?

They're the OTP in the fan-fic I call my life.

We are not OTP!

Oh! So you know the jargon of the fan-fic community!

Huh!? I don't know what you're talking about!

It rolled off your tongue so naturally.

Look. If we're gonna do this, let's do it!

'Kay, everybody. I'm getting ready to fire up the Phone Wave!

(We are not taking that kind of risk!)

(What if it results in a time paradox?)

Come on! Fortune favors the bold!

El... Psy... Congroo!

Okarin... Okarin! Hey, are you in there?
Are you okay?

I... I don't know...

How long... how long have I just been standing here?

Um... about 30 seconds, I guess.

I actually lost half minute?

You don't remember anything?
We are talking about what D-mail we should send to see if it would really alter the world line.
The all of a sudden...

You rushed over to the Phone Wave and you went, "hahhauah" all breathy-like.

Hey Mayushii, do that breathy thing again, yeah?

Oh give it a rest, Daru!

Sorry.
It arrived...

Are you sure you're feeling okay?

What about the money? From the lotto ticket!
Did we win the third prize, Christina? Tell me!

Stop calling me that! Wait... what ticket?

You really don't know what I'm talking about?

I'm confused.

For the lottery!
Our experiment to change the past!
Sending back a D-mail!

Stop acting like such a spaz!

We haven't come up with a message to send back yet!

What?

Wouldn't it be nice if we tried to make world peace happen?
We could give everyone on Earth an oopa cushion!

They really don't... remember it at all...

It's open!

Oh! Hey, Ruka! Come on in!

I hope you can forgive me, Kyouma!
What? Why?

Here...

Oh-two and twelve... eighteen...
an' all the rest... Rukako!
How'd you come up with these numbers?

Um... well I... tried to buy a lottery ticket using the numbers you gave me.

Come again?

You said I should play those numbers because they were lucky or something, so I tried...

That... was when?

Guess it's benn about a week now?

Omigosh, is your brain psychic, Okarin?

So, are we winner-winner-chicken-dinner or what?

That's the thing...

I got one of the numbers all turned around in my head.

Huh?

Aw, you were so close, dude!
Man, that sucks!

Okabe... did you use the Phone Wave to do this?

(Where's the bag with my soda?)

(I'm not gonna schlep all over town just to get you soda!)

There's no doubt in my mind that I sent it.

Nothing like it never existed.
Perhaps... my action have rewritten the past.
They've no memory of the experiment.
We discussed it and carried it out together.
No one else remember it.
I'm the only one.
This feels just like the day.
Come one... think!

Whatcha looking at?

Something important to me.

You okay?
You look like, you've been brainwashed.

I look that rough? Hell... Maybe I was.
A bit of brainwashed would certainly explain whatever's going on... What the hell?

You haven't been chipped.

Uhhh...

Whatever it is, nobody's brainwashed you.

Good... to know?

Hey, how do you wash your brain?

Well...

A mad scientist like yours truly would be happy to explain it.

Maybe we'll hold off 'til she's a little less afraid of you.

There's something I have to know.

Tremor huh?
There was one a while back, I know that.
