Kotomi:


Tomoya:
Gah!

Kotomi:
Simply divine!

Tomoya:
K-Kotomi, it's you!

Kotomi:


Tomoya:
Not good!

Kotomi:
But, what is it? Well what's the matter?

Tomoya:
Look, I was minding my own business, having a nice snooze...

Kotomi:
And that's exactly why I played a lullaby for you, Tomoya.

Tomoya:
The shock almost destroyed me!

Boy:
Okazaki, who is she?

Kotomi:


Tomoya:


Kotomi:


Boy:
My eardrum!

Tomoya:
We have a victim right here!

Kyou:
Hey Kotomi! What do you think you're doing?

Ryou:
Oh no, Kotomi!

Nagisa:


Kotomi:


Kyou:
No, no. Not hello!

Kotomi:
How about bonjour?

Kyou:
No!!

Kotomi:
Bon... jour?

Kyou:
Ugggh! I can't communicate with her!

Nagisa:

Tomoya:
Yeah, we don't want to see her getting riled up, you know.

Kyou:


Kotomi:
I'm just playing the violin, Kyou. 

Kyou:
Wait a minute. Isn't that the same violin that's from the music room?

Kotomi:


Tomoya:
Remind me to thank them for that.

Kotomi:
Let me play one more...

Group:
No, thank you!

Kotomi:
...huh?


-OP-


Tomoya:
Hello?

Kotomi:


Tomoya:
Well, not even if you said it sadly with your eyes avoiding me.

Kyou:


Tomoya:
What exactly were you guys talking about?

Kotomi:
Why is that? Why is that...

Kyou:
Shh! I have to keep her occupied before she starts playing the violin again.

Ryou:
Well, hello there.

Kotomi:
What a pleasant surprise! It's you, Ryou.

Nagisa:
My goodness gracious, you're all here!

Kotomi:
And look! Nagisa's here to see me too!

Kyou:


Tomoya:
How about you just try it one more time?

Kotomi:


Nagisa:
Well as I love and breathe, you're here too, Kotomi!

Kotomi:


Kyou:
Yes. And let's leave it at that, shall we?


第11回放課後の狂想曲


Kotomi:
So many unusual things...

Nagisa:
This is the first time I've ever even opened this box. 

Ryou:
So tell me, have you gotten new members for the Drama Club?

Nagisa:
Not yet. But I hope to have more members by the school festival.

Kotomi:
But what is this thing? Do you know what it could be? 

Nagisa:
It looks like a magic wand to me.

Kotomi:
It's a magic wand? Really?

Ryou:


Kotomi:
(Chanting...)

Ryou:
It doesn't look like anything's happening.

Kotomi:
Maybe I didn't pronounce every word in the spell like I should have?

Nagisa:


Kyou:
They've become such good friends, haven't they?

Tomoya:
Why are you sitting here with me? Go join them.

Kyou:


Tomoya:
Well...

Kyou:


Tomoya:
Hahahaha!

Kyou:
How about I punch you 'til you cry?

Tomoya:


Nagisa:


Kyou:


Nagisa:

Kotomi:
But I want... want lots and lots of people to hear me play the violin, all day long.

Nagisa:
No, you really don't...

Tomoya:


Kotomi:


Ryou:
Sis, I think you and I should do something for her.

Kyou:


Kotomi:
My violin debut?

Kyou:


Kotomi:


Nagisa:
Would you mind if I joined you?

Ryou:
Me too. 

Tomoya:
Okay, then I'll... ah!

Kyou:
He and I need to discuss the details of the concert. 

Ryou:
Then we'll just go by ourselves. You stay here.

Kotomi:


Tomoya:
What could you and I possibly have to discuss? 

Kyou:


Tomoya:
Yeah, you're probably right I guess. 

Kyou:


Tomoya:
I'm tired. I'm going to take a nap...

Kyou:


Tomoya:
Don't attack me while I'm sleeping.


Tomoya:
I wonder if they'll be okay by themselves?

Kyou:


Tomoya:
It's because those two are together that I'm worried. 

Kyou:
?

Tomoya:
Wha... what's with you all of a sudden?

Kyou:
Just answer!

Tomoya:


Kyou:
.

Tomoya:
Are you saying that Sunohara appeals to honor students, too?

Kyou:



Tomoya:


Kotomi:
Oh, hello Tomoya. How are you?

Tomoya:


Kotomi:
Haunt? Are you saying I'm bewitching?

Tomoya:
Don't say another word!

Kotomi:
So are you a bully, like all the others?

Tomoya:
No, it's just that line was so tacky I had to stop you.

Kotomi:


Tomoya:
I got it. It wasn't that advanced a retort.

Kotomi:
Isn't it at least intermediate?

Tomoya:
To put it very bluntly, your reply was really low-level in every aspect!

Kotomi:
You really are a bully, aren't you?

Tomoya:
An honorary library monitor?

Kotomi:


Tomoya:
So that's why you're in the library on a Sunday?

Kotomi:


Tomoya:
What is that? Your bento lunch box?

Kotomi:


Tomoya:
Yeah, but what if I didn't come here after all?

Kotomi:
e.

Tomoya:
Now that's the real McCoy!

Kotomi:


Tomoya:
?

Kotomi:
Um, does it taste bad?

Tomoya:


Kotomi:
Um, is it really good? Really, truly?

Tomoya:
Yes, it was really good.

Kotomi:


Tomoya:
Kotomi?




're going to continue practicing?

Kotomi:


Tomoya:


Kotomi:
Really?

Tomoya:


Kotomi:
Me?

Tomoya:


Kotomi:


Tomoya:
No. Somehow, I really don't think that plan will work.

Kotomi:
It's a dicussion of violins. 

Tomoya:
Huh? Dango Family...?

Nagisa:


Ryou:


Tomoya:
How can you tell something like that through fortune-telling?

Ryou:
Well, that kind of reaction is typical of schizophrenia.

Tomoya:
Huh?!

Kyou:
No, little sister. I'm afraid he is my patient.

Tomoya:
You know, somehow I just knew that you would be showing up soon.

Kyou:
The aroma of baking bread makes the mental state of a person unhealthy.

Tomoya:
That makes no sense.

Kyou:
Oh yes it does. And it's all due to the aroma from baking bread.

Kotomi:


Tomoya:
I was having the weirdest dream just now.

Kotomi:
Was it a scary dream?

Tomoya:
More like mixed up and very disturbing.



Kotomi:
Okay, Tomoya. I'll see you tomorrow!

Tomoya:
Yeah. See you tomorrow.

Kotomi:
Um... Tomoya?

Tomoya:
Yeah, what is it?

Kotomi:


Tomoya:
I don't see how. I was sleeping most of the time.

Kotomi:


Tomoya:


Nagisa:
Yes. Kyou asked me to draw one for the concert.

Kyou:


Ryou:
I'm sure it will have a full house. 

Nagisa:


Kyou:


Tomoya:


Nagisa:
You're probably right.

Kyou:
Alright! Invite every single person until school lets out!

Tomoya:
Thanks for coming.

Yukine:


Tomoya:


Boy:
What should we do?

Boy:
I skipped cleaning duty the day before yesterday!

Boy:
All I did was forget my daily guide printout at home.
And this is my punishment?

Tomoya:


Youhei:


Tomoya:
So you came here not knowing a thing?

Youhei:


Tomoya:
I see, then. I wish you all the luck in the world.

Youhei:


Tomoya:
r.

Tomoya:
Misae, you came too?

Misae:


Tomoyo:


Tomoya:
Legendary student president? Practically famous? 

Misae:


Tomoyo:


Misae:


Boy:
Hey, Misae! 

Misae:
If you'll excuse me!

Tomoya:
Hard to think Misae was a student council president. 

Tomoyo:


Sanae:
Okazaki!

Tomoya:


Nagisa:
Uh, I invited them, Okazaki!

Akio:
I had to come here since my daughter invited me.

Sanae:


Tomoya:
You sure about this? Kotomi's performance is kinda...

Nagisa:


Sanae:
She's so cute! 

Akio:
Not as cute as my daughter, though!

Kyou:


Boy:
Would you look at this! Just look at what she made me buy!

Boy:
Me too. It costs 300 yen!

Tomoya:
Now this makes sense. Kyou was making money!

Kyou:


Ryou:


Kotomi:


Kyou:


Akio:
Well I have to say, that's a nice introduction. 

Sanae:
I do recall, that you and I have met them somewhere before this.

Nagisa:


Akio:
Bring them over some day. We'll show them our hospitality.

Nagisa:
All right!

Kyou:
Here's the first number.

Tomoya:
You call this proficient? Are you crazy?!

Youhei:
Aahh!

Tomoyo:
Don't get carried away! Cut it out!

Tomoya:
Botan! What are you doing here again?

Misae:
You call this a performance?

Sanae:


Akio:



Ryou:
It ended nicely, somehow!

Kyou:
The audience was gasping for breath, though.

Nagisa:


Kotomi:
I'm so glad! I'm so happy!

Tomoya:


Kyou:


Ryou:


Kyou:
You're such a nice person. Isn't she supposed to be your rival in love?

Tomoya:
Hey, what "rival in love"? What are you talking about?

Ryou:
Nothing! Nothing at all!

Kyou:
Hey? What's that?

Tomoya:
Nagisa!

Nagisa:
Okazaki!

Ryou:
Kotomi!

Gentleman:
I need to talk to her!

Tomoya:
What's going on?

Kyou:


Gentleman:


Tomoya:
So who was that guy?

Kotomi:

Tomoya:
What?

Kotomi:
A very bad man!
