Okazaki!
Tomoya:
Oh, hey! Good Morning.
Kyou:
Hope you're hungry. 
Tomoya:
Wow, thanks.
Kyou:
Don't tell me you stayed up all night working?

第14回 Theory of Everything


Kyou:
All right. Guess I'll see you tomorrow!
Ryou:
You have to promise me you two won't push yourselves too hard, okay?
Tomoya:
All right, I promise.
Nagisa:
You have a safe trip home!
Nagisa:
Do you really think we'll be able to finish the yard work by tomorrow?
Tomoya:

Nagisa:
Tomoya:
No way.
Nagisa:
But I haven't even said anything yet!
Tomoya:

Nagisa:

Tomoya:
I'll be fine. It's nothing compared to what the basketball team put me through.
Nagisa:



Tomoya:

Gentleman:


Tomoya:
A hidden world, he says?
Tomoya:



Kotomi:

Tomoya:
Oh man, where am I?
Kotomi:

Tomoya:

Kotomi:

Kotomi's Mother:
Oh, Kotomi!
Who's your cute little friend?

Tomoya:

Kotomi:
Well, shall we eat?
Tomoya:
It'd be my pleasure.
Kotomi:

Tomoya:
Wow!
Kotomi's Mother:
Kotomi, it's such a nice day.
Why don't the two of you play outside instead?

Kotomi:
But this is outside!
Kotomi's Mother:
No, sweetie. Outside is on the other side of those hedges.
There are all sorts of exciting places to explore out there and
all sorts of new things to see!

Kotomi:
I don't wanna! It's scary!


Kotomi:

Tomoya:

Tomoya:

Kid:
Huh? A birthday party for some girl I don't even know?
Kid:
Yeah, and I don't know if I wanna be seen going to a girl's birthday party.

Tomoya:


Tomoya:

Tomoya:
Huh?
Kotomi:
Whaaa-haa-haa!
Tomoya:
Kotomi-chan!
Kotomi:

Gentleman:
You didn't burn the thesis.
It's all right. You don't have to cry now.
That folder was for you, not for your parents' research.

Tomoya:



Kotomi:

Tomoya:
I don't know. It feels like I might still be dreaming.
Kotomi:

Tomoya:
Kotomi!
Kotomi:

Tomoya:


Kotomi:
The sky. It's so beautiful!
Tomoya:
Yeah.


Nagisa:
There she is!
Kyou:
Good morning, Kotomi!
Ryou:
We all missed you!
Nagisa:
Welcome back, Kotomi!
Tomoya:
Good morning, Kotomi.
Kotomi:

Kyou:
Of course!

Kotomi:

Kyou:

Kotomi:
Violin gift certificate?

Ryou:

Kyou:

Kotomi:
Thanks, you guys!
Teacher:
Ichinose!
Oh, it's good to see you!
I'm glad you're feeling up to coming back to school!

Kotomi:

Teacher:
Good morning.
Oh, by the way, your guardian called and said he's stopping by today to pay you a visit.
I think he has something important to give to you.

Tomoya:

Kyou:

Nagisa:

Kotomi:
Okay.


Gentleman:
Hello, Kotomi.

Tomoya:
Thanks for coming. I'm sorry if you had to go out of your way.
Gentleman:
Please, think nothing of it. I'm happy to be here.

Kotomi:




Gentleman:
It arrived late last night at the research laboratory.
It belonged to Dr. Ichinose, without a doubt.
I opened it myself to confirm it.
Once I saw what was inside, I knew I had to bring it to you as soon as possible.

Kotomi:
Do you mean you found the thesis?
Gentleman:
Open it and see.

Tomoya:
It's all right. We're here for you, Kotomi.
Kyou:

Kotomi:
Huh!
Kyou:
So, do you know what it says?
Tomoya:
You think I can read English?
Ryou:
Let me see. It says something like, if you find this suitcase...
Kotomi:

Gentleman:
In this case, "K" and "M" are the initials of Kotaro Ichinose and Mizue Ichinose.
In other words, Kotomi's parents.

Kotomi:

Gentleman:
It must have gotten lost at sea after the plane crash.
Who knows how long it drifted out there.
It may have taken years for it to wash ashore.
Eventually, I imagine someone found it, read the letter and passed it on to someone else.
It probably continued like this for quite some time.
Passing from hand to hand, from country to country...
That suitcase has gone on a long journey to arrive here today.
Even the bear looks like it's been handled quite a bit.
Who knows how many people have taken care of it over the years.
You probably still don't know what was in that envelope you burned, do you?
I'm sure you would be relieved to know the truth. 

Kotomi:
You mean, it wasn't Mother and Father's thesis?
Gentleman:
The truth is, a secondary copy of that thesis never existed.
Your father was making revisions up until the very last minute.
I'm sure he didn't have time to make a copy before the trip.

Kotomi:
Then what was inside the envelope I burned?
Gentleman:
The truth is, it was a catalog of stuffed animals,
so they could pick out the perfect teddy bear for your birthday.
Until today, you'd probably wouldn't have believed me even if I had told you.
With this bear here, doesn't seem so far-fetched.
I still remember what he said to me:
"For the first time, my little daughter told me what she wanted for her birthday.
It was something so simple."
But when he said that, his face lit up with joy.

Kotomi:

Gentleman:
You have it right there.

Kotomi:

Gentleman:
Although this suitcase may have held their thesis at some point,
somewhere along the way, your mother and father decided to replace it
with something they thought was more important.
Your parents were striving to find the purest and most beautiful way to
describe how this world was formed.
I like to believe that what you see before you is their answer.
And to be honest, never before have I seen words as beautiful and eloquent as
those written in that letter.
Until the very end, your parents thought only of your happiness.
And cherished nothing greater than your love.

Kotomi:

Tomoya:

Kotomi's Father:
If you find this suitcase, please take it to our daughter. 
Kotomi's Father:


Kotomi's Mother:

Mother and Father:



Kotomi:

Everyone:
It's our pleasure!

Tomoya:

Nagisa:
I hope you don't mind, but I went ahead and invited my mom and dad too.
Ryou:
Once everyone else shows up, we can open presents and stuff like that.
Kotomi:
Sounds good. I made some dessert for us too!
Tomoya:
And knowing you, you probably made too much again.
Kyou:

Tomoya:

Kotomi:

Tomoya:
Basketball's lucky, huh?
Youhei:

Tomoya:
All right. I'll tell you the truth.
Nagisa:
I'm sorry, I was trying not to cry!
Tomoya:
Sunohara...
