  Nagisa:
Mr. Koumura would be advisor to both clubs?

Sugisaka:
Yes. We were thinking...
I mean, we watched yesterday's match with intensity.
And then after the match, the three of us got together and talked it over.

Rie:
That's when we thought our two clubs could share an advisor.
I don't think Mr. Koumura would be opposed to the idea - if it's all right with you?

Tomoya:
This is great, Nagisa.

Ryou:
Now we can finally revive the Drama Club!

Nagisa:
Yeah!

Nagisa:
It's not gonna work.

Tomoya:
What?! Why not?!

Ryou:
We have everything we need, don't we?

Nagisa:
They said that the school doesn't allow concurrent advisors.
There's a rule that we can't have club activities without an advisor present.
And since Mr. Koumura is already busy with the Choir Club, we would have to alternate days.

Tomoya:
Did you tell them you'd be okay with that?

Nagisa:
I tried, but they... they said there was no precedent so...

Kyou:
Ahh!
I swear, the student council at this school is nothing but a bunch of stuck-up bureaucrats!

Tomoya, Kotomi:
Nagisa!

Ryou, Kyou:
Nagisa?

Tomoya:
Nagisa! What's wrong, Nagisa?


--- OP ----


Sanae:
Thanks for taking care of her.
We appreciate it.

Kyou:
It's fine. She's our friend after all.

Ryou:
Her parents seemed really nice, didn't they?

Kotomi:
They said Nagisa will have to stay home from school for a while.
I'm really worried about her.

Kyou:
Even if we do get an advisor, without a manager, the Drama Club will have to go on hiatus.

Akio:
You know, this is the second time you've helped Nagisa out like this.
Thanks.

Tomoya:
No, I just... I... didn't do anything...



第17回 不在の空間 (An Empty Space)



Tomoyo:
Okazaki, it's morning.
You're gonna be late!
Good morning, Okazaki.

Tomoya:
Whoa! Tomoyo!
What are you doing here?

Tomoyo:
I stopped by to wake you up, so you won't be late for school, of course.

Tomoya:
But you came all the way to my house?

Tomoyo:
It's on the way to school so it's not like it's any trouble.
Besides, if I can help a friend make it to class on time, then it's worth it.
I couldn't tell you yesterday so I just stopped by.
Did I really surprise you?

Tomoya:
Damn straight you did!
You can't just barge into someone's house unannounced.

Tomoyo:
I did nothing of the sort.
I got permission from your father before I came in.

Tomoya:
Are you saying you met my dad?

Tomoyo:
That's right.
What? Is there something wrong with that?

Tomoya:
It's nothing.
Forget I mentioned it.


Tomoya:
Let go of my arm!

Tomoyo:
No way! If I let go, you'll run away.

Tomoya:
Why are you picking on me?
Lots of other guys are late to school too, you know.

Tomoyo:
Oh yeah. Like who?

Youhei:
What do you want?
What do you want?

Tomoyo:
Actually, I'm just here at Okazaki's request.

Tomoya:
I thought you'd like to share in the joy of being woken up by a pretty girl, that's all.

Tomoyo:
He keeps his room pretty neat, huh.
Hm?
Oh, what's this?

Youhei:
Ah! Don't look!
Leave my stuff alone!

Tomoyo:
A porno mag.
Well, you're a guy, so it's no surprise.

Youhei:
I hate you!

Tomoya:
No need to be embarrassed.
It's a natural part of adolescence.

Youhei:
Shut up! I don't wanna hear it!


Tomoyo:
We made it in time after all.
See you later.

Kyou:
Let's have lunch together again.
Don't forget, okay?

Tomoya:
Wow, this is pretty fancy for a box lunch.

Ryou:
My sister put it all together this morning.
It almost looks too beautiful to eat, doesn't it?

Tomoya:
It's good!

Kyou:
Hah.

Ryou:
I knew you'd think so.
My sister's cooking is in a class of its own!

Kyou:
Here's yours, Botan. Eat it up!

Botan:
Puhi~! Puhi~!

Kyou:
Hey, come on you two, squeeze in closer.
We need to make room for the food, you know.

Kyou:
Hey.

Kyou:
Now that I look at it, you two actually make a pretty cute couple.
Right Botan?

Botan:
Puhi~! Puhi~!

Ryou:
Ha...

Boy:
I swear to you here and now...

Tomoya:
Future plans?

Kyou:
Yeah, like what are you planing to do after graduation?
Oh, come on, you're kidding me, right?
You're a senior and you haven't even thought about this?

Tomoya:
Come back to me later.
What about you two?

Kyou:
It might sound strange, but I was thinking of becoming a kindergarten teacher.

Ryou:
As for me, I was considering nursing school.

Tomoya:
Huh.


Tomoya:
See you later!
Thanks for lunch.

Kyou:
Don't forget. Tomorrow is Ryou's turn to make lunch for us.
So look forward to it, okay?

What are you doing just standing there.
Hurry up and follow him!

Ryou:
Hey, are you sure about this?

Kyou:
About what?

Ryou:
I don't know.
I just... I feel bad for Nagisa.

Kyou:
Listen, Tomoya said himself that he and Nagisa weren't going out or anything.
There's no reason for you to hold back

Ryou:
Hmm...

Kyou:
If you keep hesitating like that, you're gonna end up losing him to that Tomoyo girl.
Are you okay with that?

Ryou:
Hmm...

Kyou:
I gotta go. See ya!

Ryou:
Uh, Kyou, I...
I'm sorry.


Youhei:
So Nagisa couldn't make it, huh?
Feels lonely without her.
You're gonna go visit her today, right?
Let me come along too.

Tomoya:
She might not want me there every day.
I don't wanna wear out my welcome.
I'd rather just give her some time to rest.

Youhei:
Okazaki, tell me the truth.
Do you and Nagisa have a thing going on or not?

Tomoya:
How many times do I have to tell you?
I'm not looking for a girlfriend.

Tomoyo:
Oh? Why not?

Youhei, Tomoya:
Whoa!

Tomoya:
Wait! Why not what?

Tomoyo:
Why don't you wanna a girlfriend, of course?
You don't make a decision like that unless you have a good reason.

Tomoya:
You should know you've seen my dad.
I'm a good-for-nothing delinquent
And on top of that, my home situation is a total mess.
As things are now, I'm not fit to have a girlfriend.


Tomoyo:
If you say so, but your dad looked nice to me.
Whatever, now that we've met up, we might as well walk home together.

Tomoya:
You don't trust me to walk home by myself?

Youhei:
S-sounds great!
Let me tag along too!

Tomoyo:
I don't remember inviting you.

Youhei:
I hate to break it to you, but when you invite Okazaki, you invite me too.
I have to make a stop on the way back, so keep me company, okay?

Kyou:
Damn it! She beat us to it this time.


Tomoya:
Why do we have to come to a place like this.

Youhei:
You'll find out soon enough.

Boy:
Ha ha ha...
It gets better.

Boy:
Ah, Sakagami!

Boy:
What are you doing here?!

Boy:
Oh, damn, run!

Tomoyo:
Well, now you know. They hate me here.
They all treat me like some kind of monster.

Tomoya:
So the rumor that you used to beat up trouble makers turned out to be true after all.

Tomoyo:
That was ages ago.

Boy:
Oh no! It's Sakagami!

Tomoya:
That was a dirty trick.

Youhei:
Those guys are always harassing me.
I couldn't let this chance go to waste.
That was great. It was totally worth it!

Tomoyo:
Sunohara, will you hurry and finish up whatever you need to do here?
I'm ready to leave now.

Tomoya:
Actually this isn't the place we needed to go.
We just happened to pass through here on the way to someplace else.

Youhei:
Huh?

Tomoya:
Keep your mouth shut!
And just play along or I'll tell her why you really dragged her out here.

Youhei:
Anything but that!

Tomoyo:
I see, so you just wanted to come to this coffee shop?

Tomoya:
And guess what?
And all of this is Sunohara's treat.
See, he's not such a bad friend after all!

Tomoyo:
Mm-hm.
And from now on, you can consider me a friend too, okay, Sunohara?

Youhei:
Yeah, it will be my pleasure.

Tomoya:
You know, it's always been his dream to bring a girl to this place.

Tomoyo:
Really?

Tomoyo:
Thanks for earlier...

Tomoya:
For what?

Tomoyo:
You know I didn't wanna stay there, so you said something to bail me out, right?

Tomoya:
Not really. I wasn't too keen on staying there myself.

Tomoyo:
Okazaki...?

Tomoya:
Hm?

Tomoyo:
Unlike before, I've made a lot of good friends at school this year.
And today, I really enjoyed being with you and Sunohara too.
Or rather, I really enjoyed being with you, I mean.

Tomoyo:
Glad I didn't disappoint.

Tomoyo:
See you tomorrow.


Tomoyo:
Good morning, Okazaki!

Tomoya:
Yeah...

Tomoyo:
Looks like you're still half-asleep.
You're making a pretty funny face.
I know. How about I do this to make it even funnier?

Tomoya:
What the hell are you doing?

Tomoyo:
I'm waking you up. You should be grateful!

Tomoya:
Don't tell me you plan on doing this every day?

Tomoyo:
Of course. Aren't you happy?


Youhei:
To tell you the truth, it's more of an imposition.

Tomoya:
Hey, no need to be shy, we're all friends here.

Tomoyo:
I wasn't planning on coming.
But Okazaki insisted that I'd wake you too.
I hope you'd be grateful.

Youhei:
An underclassman wakes up an upperclassman from his peaceful slumbering and expects gratitude for it?

Tomoyo:
You're a real stickler for social ranking, huh.

Youhei:
You think some half-assed apology will get you off, huh?

Tomoyo:
Who said I was apologizing?

Youhei:
You know, up close, you've got a pretty nice body. I can dig it!

Tomoyo:
This guy's doomed to be the sidekick for the rest of his life.

Tomoyo:
So you're interested in my body, are you?
If you beg me on your hands and knees, then maybe I'll let you touch it.

Youhei:
For real?! Ooh!!

Tomoyo:
So, what's it gonna be?

Youhei:
I'm begging you!

Tomoya:
That's too pathetic.

Tomoyo:
Good boy. Now get your reward.

Youhei:
What's this?

Tomoyo:
The hand's an important part of the body, right?

Youhei:
All right, that's it.
You pissed me off for the last time.
I'm gonna die...

Tomoyo:
Is it just me or did he say something while I was kicking him?

Tomoya:
He said "Awesome."

Tomoyo:
Hm. I should've known, what a freak.


Botan:
Puhi~! Puhi~!

Kyou:
Wow, you actually came!

Tomoya:
Yeah, of course!
I promised, didn't I?

Ryou:
I made the box lunches for us today.
Ah, of course, Kyou gave me some pointers.

Kyou:
She's really outdid herself so savor the flavor, okay?

Tomoya:
I'll do my best.
Anyway, I appreciate it.

Botan:
Puhi~!

Kyou:
Hey, Botan, watch your manners!

Botan:
Puhi~!

Tomoya:
Ah...

Ryou:
I'm sorry.
I should have tasted it first.
I don't know what I was thinking.

Tomoya:
Hey, don't worry about it.
If nothing else, I thought the spring rolls were great.

Ryou:
Do you really mean it?
I was so worried!

Botan:
Puhi~

Tomoya:
Huh?

Kyou:
Thanks goodness, you're all right.
Well, guys,
I'm going to the front gate to take Botan outside.
See ya!

Ryou:
Kyou, wait!


Yukine:
Is something troubling you?

Tomoya:
Hm? I don't know if I would say "troubling."

Yukine:
Just the other day, I was reading a spell book that has just the solution you might be looking for.
Would you like to try it?

Tomoya:
There, got it.
What's next?

Yukine:
Let's see. Now you put another ten yen coin on top of that one...

Tomoya:
Are you kidding? There's no way!

Yukine:
The book says you have to, otherwise the spell won't work.

Tomoya:
Huh? I did it!

Yukine:
After you've stacked all the coins, chant, "Bita funi kousoku iita" three times.

Tomoya:
Bita funi kousoku iita.
Bita funi kousoku iita.
Bita funi kousoku iita.
What's this supposed to do, anyway?

Yukine:
It's a spell to get locked in the gym storage with a girl. Just the two of you, that is.
Think of someone and it will come true.

Tomoya:
I would say Nagisa, but she's absent, so that won't work.
Kyou?
Hmm... I guess Kyou would be okay.
Ah!
Whatever, it's not like this is for real or anything.

Yukine:
If you change your mind, there's a way to break the spell.
All you have to do is take off your shirt and chant, "Noroi nante henoheno kappa" three times.

Tomoya:
Not interested.
Come on, you've got all these books, can't you teach me something useful?

Yukine:
I'd be more than happy to give you a bit of advice, but you have to tell me what your problem is first.

Tomoya:
When you put it that way, I'm not sure where to start.
Oh, I know...
What do you think about our student council?

Yukine:
I think they're very devoted to their work.
But as a result, I feel they can be a bit unreasonable at times.

Tomoya:
Yeah, I agree.
I don't see why they can't approve this whole advisor thing?

Yukine:
But on the bright side, the policies will probably change once the new officers are chosen.
The student council elections are right around the corner, you know.

Tomoya:
Right! The elections!
That's right!
If Tomoyo is elected the student council president, the problem will be solved!
Come on, Nagisa. Get well soon!
I have got good news for you.

Tomoya:
Hm?

Kyou:
Ah, Tomoya!
Grab that ball for me, will you?
P.E. class ran long today, so other students took off in a hurry.
Since they're all gone, it's my job to clean up.

Tomoya:
That's fine, but why do I have to help?

Kyou:
This is the least you can do.
You shouldn't complain to the girl who feeds you every day.

Girl:
Looks like someone left the storage room open.

Kyou, Tomoya:
Huh?

Kyou:
Ah, h-hey!

Tomoya:
What's wrong?

Kyou:
The door won't open!
It locks automatically when it closes, so we're stuck.

Tomoya:
Ahh! Forgive me!

Kyou:
What are you apologizing for?
Ah! Did you plan this?!

Tomoya:
Huh?

Kyou:
What's the big idea?
L-Listen, you'd better not try anything funny!
You hear me?!

Tomoya:
I can't believe you're saying that!

Kyou:
Ah, ahh!

Tomoya:
Hey!

Kyou:
Oh... We can't...
How can I put this?
I-I mean, it's not like we're even going out or anything.
Besides, what about Ryou...

Tomoya:
Just stop right there! Listen!

Kyou:
Please, just think this over for a second.
I know you're a guy so you probably wanna do these kind of things.
But you can't just force yourself on someone.
The feelings have to be mutual.
I-I can't betray Ryou...

Tomoya:
I said hold on, damn it!
This was an accident.
I didn't think the stupid spell would actually work.

Kyou:
Huh?

Tomoya:
I'm talking about the spell that locked the two of us in the gym. It really worked.

Kyou:
Uh-huh.

Tomoya:
Don't look at me like I'm crazy!

Kyou:
Even if it did work, who would come up with such a ridiculous spell?!

Tomoya:
Don't ask me!
I feel the same way!

Kyou:
Wait a sec, why would you pick me to be locked up with?

Tomoya:
You just came to mind, I wasn't thinking.

Kyou:
I see...
So what you're saying is, if you had to be locked up with someone, I'm your first choice?

Tomoya:
Huh?

Damn, I don't like where this is headed.

Kyou:
You must know. It's obvious, isn't it?
Why I keep inviting you to have lunch with Ryou, I mean?
It's not 'cause I just wanna hang out...

Tomoya:
Well, I have an idea.

Kyou:
And yet you still chose me?

Tomoya:
Yeah, but I didn't mean it like that.

Tomoya:
Don't just stand there, say something!
I didn't mean anything by picking you, I promise.

Kyou:
Tomoya, would you rather Ryou just... leave you alone?

Tomoya:
N-No, I wouldn't say that.

Kyou:
Well, in that case...

Tomoya:
That's it!

Kyou:
What is it?!

Tomoya:
Don't think about anything else, just leave this to me!

Kyou:
Tomoya, wait! Y-You aren't serious?

Tomoya:
I'm dead serious!
I don't need to think this over!

Kyou:
But, what about Ryou?
And besides, I-I really don't know how this kind of stuff works.
This is my first time.

Tomoya:
It's my first time too.
But leave everything to me.

Kyou:
D-Don't give me such a serious look, I... I...

Tomoya:
Turn around for a sec.
I need to take off my shirt, okay?

Kyou:
Oh... O-Okay.

Tomoya:
Noroi nante henoheno kappa.
Noroi nante henoheno kappa.
Noroi nante henoheno kappa!
Ah!

Girl:
Kyou, are you in here?
The teacher's been calling for you.
Wait, what are you doing?

Kyou:
Um... Nothing...

Tomoya:
I'm glad we finally got out.

Kyou:
Ha ha ha.
To tell you the truth, I was starting to get worried there for a second.
But anyway, I'm really sorry.
I guess I was starting to act a little strange in there?
Ah, let's pretend this never happened, okay?

Tomoya:
No, don't feel bad.
I'm the one to blame here.

Girl:
Kyou!

Kyou:
Guess I'd better get going.
I'll see you tomorrow!

Tomoya:
See you.

Tomoyo:
Okazaki!
You wanna walk home together?

Tomoyo:
You didn't have to look so surprised. It was just me.

Tomoya:
I wanted to ask you...
How's the big campaign for student council coming along?

Tomoyo:
Why are you so curious suddenly?

Tomoya:
Actually, if you were elected student council president, I was hoping I could ask you for a favor.
Ah, what's going on?
The guys from before!

Boy:
Just 'cause you took us out before doesn't give you the right to come strutting around our turf.

Boy:
But if you're looking for a fight, then you got one!

Tomoyo:
Okazaki, you better stay back.

Tomoya:
No way!
If you get in a fight in front of the school, you'll blow your chances in the election!
Tomoyo, don't!

Tomoya:
You can't reason with these people.

Fuko:
Fuko has arrived!

Finally, the time has come to unleash the invisible power of the Starfish Heat!
Ready! Starfish Heat!
Prepare yourself!
For I, the great Fuko, have hidden adorable little starfish wood carvings all throughout the school.
Now, now. I made more than enough for everyone, so there's no need to panic just yet.
However, the truly devoted starfish collectors had better be prepared to search hard!
The starfish carvings with my autograph are especially well-hidden.
That being said... Starfish Heat, go!
You see, now their minds will be filled with thoughts of the starfish.
They'll be so obsessed with finding them that they'll forget all about you.
Huh?
They don't want... the Starfish at all?
The plan failed!?
So, um, is it okay if I leave now?

Tomoya:
Go ahead.

Fuko:
Excuse me.

Tomoya:
What was that all about?

Tomoyo:
Feels like I've seen her somewhere before.

Youhei:
Wow. In a situation this desperate, even a cat's help would be welcome.

Tomoya:
Desperate enough for a cat, huh?

Tomoyo:
Actually, I prefer the cat to him.

Youhei:
Don't say that.
After all, yesterday's rival can become tomorrow's friend.

Tomoya:
Actually, you're more like a punching bag than a rival.

Youhei:
Hey, I hold my own against Tomoyo!

Tomoyo:
Okay, fine. So, what were you saying?

Youhei:
As I was saying, Tomoyo and I may be bitter rivals most of the time.

Tomoya:
Yeah, we got that part now.
Hurry up and get to the point.

Youhei:
But when a challenger comes from another school, we become comrades-in-arms.

Tomoyo:
You'll just get in the way.

Youhei:
I promise I won't be a burden, just humor me!

Guy:
Do you assholes want to fight, or just do comedy all day!
Screw this. Let's murder those punks!

Guys:
Ahh!

Youhei:
All right, leave the rest to me!
Ahh!

Tomoyo:
Hah!

Youhei:
Hey, I'm on your side, remember?

Tomoyo:
I couldn't tell you apart. Sorry!

Guy:
She... She's so hardcore, she even beats up her friends!

Guy:
This is looking bad.
We better bail!

Tomoya:
Tomoyo!

Teacher:
Hey!

Tomoyo:
Huh?

Guy:
Oh, crap, run away!

Teacher:
What the hell's going on here?!
Okazaki, you again, huh?

Tomoyo:
No sir, the truth is I'm...

Tomoya:
That's right.
I'm the one who started it.
The girl there had nothing at all to do with this.

Teacher:
You got a bad record already.
This time, you'll probably be suspended.
Be prepared for that!

Tomoyo:
Okazaki...
