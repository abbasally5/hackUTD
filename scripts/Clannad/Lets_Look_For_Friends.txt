  Tomoya:
How did it go?

Nagisa:
I'm at a loss for words.

Tomoya:
What did they tell you?

Nagisa:
All recruitment for potential new members is forbidden.

Tomoya:
Why in the world would they...?

Nagisa:
The Drama Club is currently on hiatus, so club activities are suspended as well.
Therefore, they cannot approve the posting of recruitment posters.

Tomoya:
That's ridiculous, not to mention unfair!
 They can't do that! Did you just tell them, "okay, I understand"?

Nagisa:
I did my best to convince them.
 But all they would say were rules are rules and they can't be bent.

Tomoya:
I don't want you to give up.
 There just has to be a way to get what you want.

Nagisa:
You really think so?

Tomoya:
We'll just have to start one up on our own.
 It's not right you would have to give up your dream because of this.

Nagisa:
Oh, Okazaki!

Girl:
Is that so?

Youhei:
Hmm...


-OP-

Youhei:
So tell me. Are you seeing that Drama Club girl?

Tomoya:
What?

Youhei:
I thought it was odd that you should get involved with the club,
but if you're just doin' it to be with her, then I can understand.

Tomoya:
Actually, her family runs a little shop - a bakery.

Youhei:
Huh?

Tomoya:
The pastries her mother makes are really good.
 If you taste it once, you'll be hooked.
 If you're friends with her, you can eat all the pastries you like.

Youhei:
Huh?
 Are you serious?

Tomoya:
If not, I wouldn't be involved with the Drama Club, would I?

Youhei:
Well, it's true I don't really think that she's your type.
 She's plain and seems so earnest and goody-goody.

Tomoya:
You just go on thinking about getting revenge on Tomoyo Sakagami.
 Right?

Tomoyo:
You really are persistent.

Tomoya:
Yeah, I think so too.

Youhei:
I just came because I wanted to see you.
 You're so beautiful, you know.

Tomoyo:
I can't believe anything you say.

Youhei:
Aah!! Oh no! I'd forgotten the fake breasts needed for my next class!
 Tomoyo, would you please lend me your breasts, will ya?

Tomoyo:
Why?

Youhei:
I did it! I caught you!
 See that? Did you see that?

Tomoya:
What are you trying to say, exactly?

Youhei:
Her asking "why?" means she can lend her breasts to me, right?
 Then that...that means her breasts aren't real - they're removable!

Tomoyo:
Of course they aren't removable.

Youhei:
See, there?

Tomoyo:
In the first place...

Youhei:
In the first place?


Youhei:
I'll get her next time.

Tomoya:
You intend to continue this?

Youhei:
Of course!
 Just watch me, I'll get her next time!

Fuko:
Wait a minute.
 There's the weird guy!

Tomoya:
I'm not a weird guy, so it has nothing to do with me.

Fuko:
Wait. Weird guy!

Tomoya:
Huh, are you talking to me?

Fuko:
It's only natural. There's no one around here as weird as you.
Someone weird like you appears once in ten years.
 I don't think it's an exaggeration to say something like that.
 No! I know for sure it's not an exaggeration!

Tomoya:
Thank you very much.

Fuko:
You don't need to thank me.

Tomoya:
I'm Tomoya Okazaki of 3-D and this is my friend, Youhei.

Youhei:
Who is this little kid?
 Is she someone you know?

Fuko:
Ah, it looks like it's double weird guys!

Youhei:
Huh? And just what is weird about me?

Fuko:
Your hair is an impossible color!

Youhei:
Our first meeting?
 That's a rude thing to say.

Fuko:
I just want to talk to weird guy number one.
 I want to speak privately, so come with me!

Fuko:
This is far enough.
 What I wanted to talk about...

Tomoya/Youhei:
What?

Fuko:
Oh no! It's double weird guys!

Tomoya/Youhei:
You told us to come with you.

Fuko:
But I only want to talk to you!

Youhei:
Hey, you said I was a weird guy too, or have you forgotten?

Fuko:
That's because you have weird hair!
 But you, your whole existence in life is weird.

Youhei:
This kid is definitely pickin' a fight.

Tomoya:
She says my whole existence is weird.
 You're lucky she says only a part of you is weird.

Youhei:
Don't worry, I let it go this time little girl.

Fuko:
Okay now, weird guy.

Tomoya:
I told you, stop calling me that!

Fuko:
I forgot your name.

Tomoya:
I told you I'm Tomoya Okazaki.

Fuko:
All right, Okazaki.
 Don't you have something that you want to say to me?

Tomoya:
Something to say?

Fuko:
Yes.

Tomoya:
One, two! One, two!...

Fuko:
Oh, please stop that!
 It's about the present I gave you.

Tomoya:
Are you saying that was a present?

Fuko:
Yes, it was.

Tomoya:
Oh, well, thank you.
 See you later.

Fuko:
Please wait! My one and only big sister is getting married very soon.

Tomoya:
Is that so?

Fuko:
She's marrying someone named Yusuke.
 Won't you please congratulate the both of them?

Tomoya:
Fuko's sister, congratulations then. See ya.

Fuko:
That's not it!

Tomoya:
What is it? I congratulated her.

Fuko:
I want you to congratulate her on her wedding day - where it happens!

Tomoya:
So in other words,
 you gave me a present and you want me to attend your sister's wedding with you.
 Is that it?

Fuko:
That's it.

Tomoya:
Why me?
 In the first place, I don't even know you very well.

Fuko:
Well, you see.
 My sister was the art teacher at this school until three years ago.
 I want more than anything for everyone to come to my sister's wedding.
 So I'm giving out these gifts as invitations.

Tomoya:
To every single student at this school?

Fuko:
Yes.
 If they receive something as cute as this, they should all be deeply moved.
 It's so cute!
 Ah-ha-ha...

Tomoya:
Hey?

Fuko:
Ah-ha-ha...
 ...uh-ha~!
 My nose felt funny just now.

Tomoya:
Darn!
 She didn't drink any.
 You know, I think it's impossible.

Fuko:
What is?

Tomoya:
Well, I mean if you said that your sister worked here about three years ago,
 then she... she wouldn't have known any of the students that are here now.
 And they wouldn't know your sister, so I doubt that they would come to a stranger's wedding.

Fuko:
Do you really think so?

Tomoya:
Yeah. I mean, the seniors are busy with entrance exams.

Fuko:
But, I'll do my very best. I want everyone to celebrate, and rejoice in my big sister's wedding!


Tomoyo:
I may not appear so, but I'm very busy.

Tomoya:
 I have to say I don't have much time for this, either.

Youhei:
 Well, I think that this time I'll take a different approach. 

Tomoyo:
But you're always claiming that you'll do that.

Youhei:
This time I swear, I'm really different!
 Ahh!

Tomoyo:
 Oh my goodness! Are you allright?


Youhei:
That was a good kick, I'll give you that.
 But after any fight always comes a reconciliation.
 Come with me.

Tomoyo:
What is it now?

Youhei:
Come on, never mind it's not far!
 Ahhh!!

Tomoyo:
What are you guys trying to do?
 Trying to get me into the boys bathroom!
 My gosh, there's no limit to the harassment you give me!

Tomoya:
He just wants to watch you go to the bathroom and make sure you're really a girl.
 That's all.

Tomoyo:
What?

Tomoya:
You're too strong, so he suspects that you may actually be a guy in girls clothing.
 Are you going to get mad?

Tomoyo:
More than that, I'm shocked!
 All this time I was under the impression that I was finally acting like a girl
 and not some bully at this school.

Tomoya:
You're very sensitive about it.

Tomoyo:
Even at this, I'm trying very hard to change.

Youhei:
Don't you worry, I'm not letting it end like this!


Tomoya:
Show a little more spirit, will you?

Nagisa:
I'd like to, but I don't think I can think of any good ideas.

Tomoya:
 Instead of putting up posters, how about handing out flyers directly? 

Nagisa:
I asked about doing that, but they told me I couldn't.

Tomoya:
Then I don't think that collecting signatures for a petition would go well.

Youhei:
I heard all about what you're doing!

C L A N N A D


Tomoya:
...help us attract club members?

Youhei:
Yeah. Besides I'm tired of school pastries.

Nagisa:
What? What pastries?

Youhei:
Never mind. It has nothing to do with you.
 What I heard is that the student council is blocking your gathering members, right?
 This is gonna be easy.

Nagisa:
 So, do you have a good idea on how to help? 

Youhei:
Call the student council chairman out behind the school, and everybody beat him up! 

Nagisa:
But you musn't do that.
 That would be mean! It's not the student council's fault!

Youhei:
 Well, that's the quickest way to fix this, isn't it? 

Nagisa:
 In any case, violence in not a solution.

Youhei:
Then, negotiation?
 I'm afraid that isn't my forte.

Tomoya:
We have a great difference in values, then.

Nagisa:
But thank you for your concern.
 Can you help us non-violently?

Youhei:
Okay then. You guys just leave it to me!

Tomoya:
 If this were a role-playing game...

Game Voice-Over:
 Youhei Sunohara wants to join you.
 What will you do?

Youhei:
 Ahh! Why is there no choice to let me join?

Tomoya:
 That would make things too simple.

Youhei:
 You know, I have to say it really doesn't make any sense to think only amongst yourselves.
 Don't you both think it's better to confer with someone like maybe...

Nagisa:
 You may have a pretty good point there.

Tomoya:
 Do you have someone in mind?

Youhei:
 Of course! If I didn't, I wouldn't mention it. 


Botan:
Puhi~! Puhi~!
Puhi~!!

 Kyou:
 Botan, you came again?

Ryou:
 What a problem! We still have a whole day of classes. 

Kyou:
 We'll catch Tomoya or Youhei and make them watch her.
 I'm sure they won't mind at all. 

Tomoya:
 If I'm not mistaken, I think they're talking about us.

Youhei:
 Hmm. You would think the class leader would know the rules about bringing pets to school.
 But she is with her sister.

Tomoya:
 Okay, I want you to go and bring the younger sister over here.
 If you tell her there's someone who wants to confess his love, the older sister will probably stay away.

Youhei:
 Ah, great idea!
 Good job, man.

Nagisa:
 What were you and Youhei talking about just now?

Tomoya:
 You think of what you're going to ask. 


Ryou:
 Yes? What do you want?

Tomoya:
 The one who wanted to see you is... her.

Ryou:
 What? Wha... what!?

Nagisa:
 I'm Nagisa Furukawa of 3-B.
 I'm sorry for calling you out suddenly. I didn't mean to startle you!

Ryou:
 Ah, that's all right!
 I'm Ryou Fujibayashi of D class.

Nagisa:
 You're the class leader, aren't you?

Ryou:
 Ye... yes.

Nagisa:
 That's terrific.
 It's not something I could ever do.
 I really admire you. 

Ryou:
 Oh, no. It's not such a great thing. 

Nagisa:
 I have something to ask you.
 Will you listen to me, please? 

Ryou:
 Yes?!

Tomoya:
 I want you to answer as honestly as possible.
 She's being completely honest with you, Ryou.

Ryou:
 Please, if you'd wait a minute.
 I, uh... I didn't think it was a girl, and I...


 Youhei:
 Sex really doesn't matter, does it?
 The important thing is what's in the deepest part of your heart. 

Tomoya:
 Sometimes you're a lot smarter than you look, you know?

Youhei:
 I get a bad rap, but I'm essentially a good guy!

Nagisa:
 Is it strange that I'm a girl?

Ryou:
 No, you're very cute.
 But with me, uh... what can I say? I'm flattered. 

Nagisa:
I've been a little troubled by it, but I've decided to be brave and embrace it. 

Ryou:
 So you were that troubled by it? 

Youhei:
 This is kind of exciting! 

Nagisa:
 I have to be honest that I don't know what to do anymore.
 If you would please just hear me out!

Ryou:
 I do understand.
 I will listen to you seriously. 

Nagisa:
 Oh please. Pretty please?

Youhei:
 Ow.

Nagisa:
 If you would please help me form my own school theatrical drama club!

Ryou:
 Okay. Huh? 
 Kyou!

Youhei:
 Kyou!

Kyou:
 How dare you ridicule my sister!


Kyou:
If that's the case, why didn't you say so in the first place?

Tomoya:
It's all his fault.

Youhei:
And what about you?!

Nagisa:
I'm sorry.
 I'm not very good at explaining things.

Ryou
It made my heart beat so fast!
 It's okay.

Kyou
Don't tell me that these are the only friends you have?

Nagisa:
My friends?
 Oh, no. They're... they're just helping me restart this school's Drama Club.

Kyou:
Hmm. They must have an ulterior motive.
 Why don't you give up these guys and be friends with us?
 We're a lot more fun to be around!

Nagisa:
Huh? Well, I...

Kyou:
You think so too, don't you Botan?

Botan:
Puhi~!

Youhei:
Such a terrible way to put it.

Tomoya:
Getting pastries is your motive, isn't it?

Nagisa:
Hey. I appreciate your thinking about me, but they've been helping me
 and it wouldn't be right to abandon them like that.
 Okazaki and Sunohara are really nice guys. 

Kyou:
It looks like we've managed to reconcile.
 You wouldn't by any chance be after this little red head, would you?

Tomoya:
No, of course I'm not

Ryou:
In order for any student to reactivate a suspended club, first you need members.
 For club activities, you need at least three and an advisor.
 That's the rule. 

Kyou:
Well, you're right about that.

Nagisa:
Three, then! 

Tomoya:
But it's the recruitment of those members that they're not allowing.

Youhei:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Kyou:
You already have the head count. 

Youhei:
I do?

Kyou:
This girl. And you, and you.

Youhei/Tomoya
No, no, no



Youhei:
Give me a break! I mean, we're not interested in doing theatrics, are we?
 Well?

Tomoya:
We might not be able to use posters and flyers to recruit, but there's no rule against inviting people.
 Is there?

Youhei:
Ohh. Interesting idea, man.
 So do you seriously need to help her?

Tomoya:
Well, yeah. Because if I don't, I can't get any of those delicious pastries.

Youhei:
Maybe I'll do my best to help Nagisa earnestly, too.
 She seems like a genuinely nice girl to me.
 School might be fun if I'm friends with her.
 Okay, tomorrow I'll make a homerun with Tomoyo!

Tomoya:
It's a beautiful world you live in.



Youhei:
A homerun!

Tomoyo:
Well, that's kinda out of the blue!

Youhei:
I was just talking to myself.

Tomoyo:
Exactly how long is this squabble going to go on?

Youhei:
I'm truly different today.
 My perspective about your identity has changed at last!

Tomoyo:
What do you mean?

Tomoya:
First, complement what she's wearing.

Youhei:
What you have on your hair looks good on you!

Tomoyo:
Thanks, I guess.

Youhei:
I accept that Tomoyo is a girl.
 Since that's the case, I think I should simply take advantage of that. 

Tomoya:
Okay, you do realize she actually can't stand you at all, right?

Youhei:
And that is precisely why I need your help!
 I mean, you seem to get along with Tomoyo.

Tomoya:
Yeah, well, better than you.

Youhei:
So? Teach me how to talk to her - to get her to like me!
 You're better at dating than I am...
The uniform looks good on you, too!

Tomoyo:
You are so creepy!

Youhei:
Is it going well?

Tomoya:
Yeah, it's going great!
 Next, I want you to give it a long stretch and tell her,
 "You're so pretty, you must be the most popular girl in the whole school!"
 You got it?

Youhei:
You're so pretty, you must be the most popular girl in the whole school!

Tomoya:
He's really saying it!
Youhei:
Is this working?

Tomoya:
You're doing fine.
 Next I want you to say,
 "Oh man, do I really want a pretty girlfriend really really bad!"
 while doing hindu squats.

Youhei:
I... want a pretty girlfriend really really bad!
 That's totally unnatural!

Tomoya:
You're doing fine.
 Next, I want you to make like you're rolling a bowling ball and say,
 "Please make my breakfast every morning for me, sweet cheeks!"

Youhei:
Tomoyo... please make my breakfast every morning for me, sweet cheeks! Haha...
 Is there any meaning to these poses?

Tomoya:
Not especially.

Youhei:
Then don't make me do them!

Tomoyo:
So he was teasing me with these complements, after all?

Youhei:
If that's the case, the first move means victory!
Ahhh!!

Tomoya:
Sorry, man! I unconciously kicked you back.

Youhei:
Ouch!

Tomoyo:
Please make this the last time you talk to me.

Tomoya:
Uh, wait a minute, Tomoyo. Do you have any interest in drama?

Tomoyo:
In drama?

Tomoya:
We're recruiting members. You can wear feminine clothes. 

Tomoyo:
I'm a little interested, but it's probably impossible.
 It's almost time for student council chairman elections.
 I have no time for club activites.

Tomoya:
Student council chairman?

Tomoyo:
I'm going to be very busy, very soon. Find someone else.

Tomoya:
Student council chairman...



Tomoya:
Hey, Ichinose! Ichinose!
 So fast... that's a genius for you.
 Hey, Kotomi Ichinose.
 Kotomi. Hey, Kotomi!
 Kotomi!

Kotomi:
Huh?

Tomoya:
I'm Tomoya Okazaki of 3-D. You're Ichinose of 3-A, right?

Kotomi:
Umm, why yes as a matter of fact I am.

Tomoya:
You're Kotomi Ichinose. I hear you're famous.

Kotomi:
You can call me Kotomi-chan.

Tomoya:
At least let me drop the 'chan', will ya?

Kotomi:
Perhaps you would like to come and read with me?

Tomoya:
I didn't come to read. 

Kotomi:
Would you like to eat lunch with me?

Tomoya:
I came to recruit you for a club.
 Do you have any interest in acting?

Kotomi:
Acting?

Tomoya:
I'm looking for some new members.
 If I can just use your name maybe to get others.

Kotomi:
My name?
 I have to be honest, it's such a strange request!
 Tomoya... kun.

Tomoya:
No, you don't have to put a pause there for no reason... 
I'll come back some other time. Will you please think about it?

Kotomi:
Tomoya-kun?

Tomoya:
What?

Kotomi:
See you again!






Tomoya:
You had no luck either?

Nagisa:
No. I asked a number of students, but unfortunately no one's interested.

Tomoya:
When you think about it, no one was interested, so the club was suspended.
 I thought it would be easy, but it looks like it'll take a lot of work.

Nagisa:
The seniors have college exams.
 The sophomores might be interested because they're so new to this school,
 but I don't know a lot of them.

Tomoya:
The sophomores, yeah...




Tomoya:
Hey! You're still here.

Fuko:
Oh, weird guy.

Nagisa:
Well, how do you do? My name is Nagisa Furukawa of 3-B.

Fuko:
How do you do.

Nagisa:
Fuko, do you happen to have any interest in acting?

Fuko:
Interest in acting?

Tomoya:
The Drama Club is recruiting members, and you're a sophomore.
 You haven't joined a club yet, have you?

Fuko:
I'm very busy. I don't have time for school club activities.

Tomoya:
Oh, come on Fuko. Don't say that.
 You're not making those things all day and all night, are you?

Fuko:
I do this from morning to night - right through, right here!

Tomoya:
You say that, but you go home, don't you?

Fuko:
No, I never go home.
 I'm always in school. 

Nagisa:
Oh?

Tomoya:
 Oh that's not possible.
 You have to go home sometime, you know.

Fuko:
But I'm not lying!
 I don't go home. I'm always at school!

Tomoya:
From morning to night?
Fuko:
That's right.

Tomoya:
You don't go home at all?!

Fuko:
That's right.
 There's no reason to go home.

Tomoya:
Did you by chance run away from home?

Fuko:
To be honest with you, I can't really tell you why I'm here.
 On the way home from the school entrance ceremony, I was almost hit by a car.
 And before I knew it, I was here at this school.

Tomoya:
Hit by a car?

Nagisa:
If I may ask you, what would your last name be, Fuko?

Fuko:
It's Ibuki. I'm Fuko Ibuki.

Nagisa:
Fuko... Ibuki. Miss Ibuki's younger sister?

Fuko:
Okazaki! This girl is someone who knows my big sister!

Tomoya:
Oh, yeah. Come to think of it, you're a repeater.

Nagisa:
Yes, and Miss Ibuki was my art teacher in my first year. But...
 ...her sister got into an accident and has been hospitalized all this time.
She came to buy pastries at the bakery yesterday,
 saying she was on her way home from visiting her sister.
 Okazaki, have you ever heard about the ghost of the girl who died in a car accident?

Tomoya:
It couldn't be!
