  Kotomi:
Thank you for letting me use the violin.

Tomoya:
And we're terribly sorry that we kept it for a whole week.

Rie:
Well, actually, this isn't officially school property, you see.
A student who graduated several years ago left it behind when she went to college.
The music teacher asked me to test it and see if it plays properly.
It's a very old violin, after all.


Kotomi:
It may be an old violin.
And I can see that the strings are a little worn and the wood does look a little warped to me.
But I still think it's a wonderful violin.
So, please don't throw it away!

Rie:
Oh, yes. That's what I intend to tell the teacher.

Kotomi:
What a relief!
Oh no, there's something I forgot.
Why, hello there. How do you do?
I'm Kotomi Ichinose of 3-A.
I love reading.
If you and I could be friends, I would be so very happy!

Tomoya:
If I'm not mistaken, she's been introduced already. But let's just clarify who you are, shall we?

Rie:
Oh, yes. My name is Rie Nishina.
I'm very happy to meet both of you.

I'll see you again.

Tomoya:
Yes, see you around.

Tomoya:
Looks like you're making lots of friends here.

Kotomi:
Uh-huh.

Tomoya:
Sure would be nice if you could keep meeting people like this.

Kotomi:
Uh-huh.


- OP -


Nagisa:
Kotomi doesn't go to the library anymore these days.
Instead, she's attending classes.

Tomoya:
Yeah, how about we go take a little peek?

Girl:
Say, Ichinose, about problem three here...

Kotomi:
This is "x = cos(θ)" and when you solve it, then the result is "π/9."
[This is 'X' equals cosine theta. And when you solve it, then the result is pi over nine.]

Girl:
So, that's it! Thank you!

Girl:
Oh, my goodness, Ichinose, you're so smart!

Girl:
I just realized that was you performing at the violin concert!
That was amazing!

Girl:
What? You play the violin?

Girl:
You should've told us! We'd have gone to see you.

Girl:
Well, I passed by, and I don't know whether you could really call that playing.

Girl:
What do you mean by that, Kei(?) ?

Girl:
Almost like, "Never mind, I'll play!"

Kotomi:
I have to say it's a little bit embarrassing.


第12回 かくされた世界 (Hidden World)


Kyou:
You're too naive!
The world of comedy doesn't tolerate anyone who is subpar!
That's why you can see the rejects, with their silly neckties far beyond the horizon!
So, if you flub your lines or sound unnatural...
Do you know what will happen?

Kotomi:
What will happen?

Kyou:
Why?!
Are you stupid?!

Ryou:
Ugh!

Kyou:
Snap out of it!

Tomoya:
Out of what?

Kyou:
Oh, just forget it!
Can't you see?!
Don't you see that everyone will attack you with severe backhand chops?!
And that's just how things are in the real world.

Kotomi:
I think retorts can be very scary.

Kyou:
In any case, even if you're reborn a million times, you won't make it as a comedian.

Ryou:
S-Sister, that's a bit too harsh, don't you think?

Nagisa:
I-I agree!
I mean, if we all work together, then I'm sure...

Kyou:
It's useless!
No matter how many zeros you have, they always add up to zero.

Tomoya:
You're being really mean to those girls, you know that?

Kotomi:
I believe this calls for a last resort.
I'm going to have to deliver an amazing gag!

Kyou:
I can only hope it's not another moldy old joke of yours.

Kotomi:
I just learned it on television.
It's very fresh.
Okay, here I go!
This bends like this.
He he he...

Kyou:
That's a gag?

Tomoya:
Look, don't ask me.

Kotomi:
And then, this part comes off.

Kyou:
It is a gag!

Tomoya:
Don't cry!

Everyone:
Wow!

Tomoya:
You made so much food for us.

Kotomi:
That's because I wanted everyone to have some.

Ryou:
So, tell me Kotomi.
What do you do when there's no school?

Kotomi:
Oh, I always read all of my books.

Tomoya:
And me? I usually just hang around at Sunohara's place.

Nagisa:
I just basically stay at home too.

Kyou:
How hopeless!
Every one of us are at the peak of our youth.
And all of you are doing nothing but wasting away your time and bodies!

Tomoya:
So you're saying you have a lot of things to do?

Kyou:
Not a thing!

Tomoya:
Figured as much.

Kyou:
But just now, I came up with a really good plan.
Everyone meet at 9 AM tomorrow in front of the station!
We have a group date!
A really really exciting group activity.
It would be the perfect symbol of our innocent and proper youth!


Tomoya:
I'm the only guy?
Sunohara would have come if you asked.

Kyou:
I rejected him!
One fool is plenty enough.

Tomoya:
Fool? You talking about yourself?

Kyou:
Don't make me laugh.
I mean you, who else?

Tomoya:
Oh, really. Well, you're a pretty big fool yourself.

Ryou:
Kyou, Kotomi's birthday is coming up soon.

Kotomi:
Yes, this Saturday.

Kyou:
All right! I'll think of the perfect birthday present!


Tomoya:
No way.

Kyou:
Ooh! It didn't even budge an inch!
Hey, you there!
The position of this machine is all wrong!
No one has a chance with this!

Clerk:
Not again?
Why don't you give it up already?

Guy:
She's gonna try again?!

Tomoya:
This is what she meant by the "perfect present"?

Ryou:
I've never seen a stuffed animal that's that enormous.

Nagisa:
Could it be possible that this stuffed version is bigger than the real animal?

Clerk:
Here you go.

Kyou:
Thank you!
Now, this will be my thirty-fourth consecutive attempt at success.

Tomoya:
Okay, listen to me. This is your last try!
You've cleaned me out. I'm flat broke.

Kyou:
Next is your turn, Ryou!

Ryou:
No, no, I have no confidence!
I failed the last time.

Kyou:
Then you, Nagisa!
Nagisa:
No, ask someone else, because I'll just be a waste of Okazaki's hard-earned money.

Tomoya:
Well then, maybe you shou...

Kyou:
You're so hopeless!
Isn't there anyone brave enough to step forward and say, "I can do it"?

Fuko:
Fuko-chan at your service!

Kyou:
Okay, who are you?

Fuko:
You seem to be having difficulties, so I have rushed here with the sole purpose of being of service.
Please leave this to Fuko!

Nagisa:
Hey, haven't you and I met somewhere before?

Fuko:
Don't worry about it.
You don't have to remember now.
The day is sure to come when we cross paths again.

Tomoya:
Wait a minute! Are you sure about this?

Fuko:
In my neighborhood, people say that if you put me in a crane, there isn't a thing I can't grab.
I am a certifiable master at this little carnival game.

Tomoya:
What kind of neighborhood is that?
Hey, wait. I've had this conversation before.
The one you're after is that big one right there.
You understand?

Fuko:
This is it!
Here I go!
My hand moved on its own, drawn by the shape of this precious object.

Tomoya:
All right.
You were aware that is a star, not a starfish, aren't you?

Fuko:
I wasn't able to be of service this time.
But I would like to appear again one day!
Well then.

Kyou:
Oh... who was that girl?

Tomoya:
And why did I say it was a starfish?

Nagisa:
I wonder...

Kyou:
And after all that, we ended up with no present.

Tomoya:
There's still time to try again.
Let's just put a little more thought into it.

Ryou:
Oh! A vapor trail!

Nagisa:
Oh, it's so pretty!

Tomoya:
Huh? So what's the matter with you, Kotomi?


Nagisa:
Um, we're going to go this way.

Kotomi:
Nagisa, Kyou, Ryou. See you tomorrow!

Ryou:
Goodnight.

Nagisa:
Yes!

Kyou:
Bye-bye.

Kotomi:
Thank you so very much, Tomoya.

Tomoya:
Huh?

Kotomi:
If I had never met you, I would never have felt this much joy with wonderful people.

Tomoya:
I didn't do anything.
It was all Nagisa, Kyou and Fujibayashi's idea to go out together.
They really like you. That's all.

Kotomi:
If that's true, then I'm a really happy girl.
Listen, Tomoya.
There's a little something that I would like you to have.
I honestly think you would really like it.
You can have it because I have already memorized everything that's in there.

Tomoya:
So, what, do you want me to read it or something?

Kotomi:
Oh, no. You don't have to read it.
Just hang on to it for a while for me.
Ahh!

Tomoya:
What's the matter?
Hey, wait a minute. Isn't that that guy?

Kotomi:
It's the bad man!

Tomoya:
H-Hey!

Tomoya:
He's gone.
Just who is that guy, anyway?
And what does he want with you?


Tomoya:
Uh!

I've been having some bad dreams lately.
Ah!

Kotomi:
Tomoya, guess who!

Tomoya:
Hey, wait a minute!
I can feel your boobs!

Kotomi:
Icanfeelyourboobs?
Yourboobs?

Tomoya:
Stop talking like a Russian gymnast!
Kotomi, you're standing so close to me that I can feel your boobs are pressed against my back!

Kotomi:
Oh. My heart is beating so fast!

Tomoya:
Who's the weirdo who put you up to doing this embarrassing trick?!

Kyou:
I'm afraid I did!

Tomoya:
You'll stop, will you?
Quit making Kotomi do sick tricks!
She's a sweet girl.

Kyou:
What's wrong with it?
It's not gonna make them smaller.

Nagisa:
Kyou!

Kyou:
Huh?

Tomoya:
What's up, Nagisa?
Where's the fire?

Nagisa:
Kyou, Ryou commutes to school by taking a bus, doesn't she?

Kyou:
Everyday.
So, why do you wanna know so bad?
Nagisa:
So, Ryou's always on the bus around this time, isn't she?

Kyou:
What's wrong?
Why do you wanna know about Ryou's method of transport?

Nagisa:
There's been a bus accident over at the intersection!
And a crowd has gathered to see the carnage.
It seems like a serious accident.
Oh, what if Ryou...

Kyou:
Ah! There's no way!
That's not just possible!
There's no way I wouldn't sense it if something happened to my own sister!

Tomoya:
Kyou!


C L A N N A D
- クラナド -


Man:
Oh man! I've never seen a bus turned over like that!

Man:
That's a bad intersection.

Man:
There could be a lot of casualties in this one.

Kyou:
Oh, Ryou!

Ryou:
Sis?

Nagisa:
Ryou!

Tomoya:
Fujibayashi, are you all right?!
Are you hurt at all?

Kyou:
Wait a minute, Ryou.
Weren't you on that bus this morning?

Ryou:
No, I took the next one.
The roads were really crowded--so crowded that I was late getting the bus stop on time.
That bus wasn't in service, so there were no passengers.
The bus driver and the driver of the other car are over there.

Bus driver:
You're the one who went into the light, you blind nitwit!


Man:
It was yellow, so I just stepped on it a little!
It's your fault for not looking!

Man:
Okay, okay, that's enough!
I'll hear you out over there.

Nagisa:
I'm just so happy that no one was hurt in a terrible bus accident.

Kyou:
Oh...

Ryou:
I-It's okay, sister...

Nagisa:
I'm so sorry that I over-reacted to the situation, Kyou.

Tomoya:
Well, I'm just relieved that no one was hurt at least.

What's the matter? Are you okay?

Nagisa:
Oh, Kotomi, Ryou is okay.
Isn't that great?
Kotomi?
Kotomi?

Kotomi:
Whaaah-ha-ha!

Nagisa:
Kotomi!

Kyou:
Kotomi? What's the matter with you?

Tomoya:
Hey, Kotomi! Kotomi, hey!

Kotomi:
I'll be good...

Tomoya:
What?

Kotomi:
I'll be a good girl! I'll be good, I will...

Nagisa:
Kotomi!

Ryou:
Kotomi, don't cry!

Kyou:
The hospital! An ambulance!
Let's take her to the infirmary!


Tomoya:
You mean she left?

Kyou:
Yes, apparently she left all by herself in the middle of first period.

Nagisa:
At least, that's what the physician on call said at the infirmary.

Tomoya:
She was suffering so much.
Do you guys really think that it's okay to leave her alone like that?

Nagisa:
That's what we were worried about, so we asked him the same thing.

Ryou:
But he said it's a personal matter, and wasn't able to tell us any more than that.

Tomoya:
Something personal, eh?

Kyou:
I think we should go to the teachers' office.
The teacher in charge should know what happened to her.

Teacher:
She came to tell me herself.
She wasn't feeling well, so she wanted to leave and to go home alone.

Kyou:
But exactly what happened to Ichinose?
What is this personal matter of hers?

Teacher:
Well, I can't tell you because it's private.
You should wait until she's ready to tell you herself.

Tomoya:
I don't mean to pry, but do you think it would be okay for us to visit her at home?

Teacher:
I think you should let her be for now.
But I'll give you her address.
Just don't force yourself on her.
Here you go.


Ryou:
Kotomi thought I had been seriously hurt and went into shock.

Nagisa:
Oh, this is all my fault!
If I hadn't blurted out that there had been an accident...

Tomoya:
What happened today was no one's fault.
Don't worry.

Nagisa:
Are you serious, really?

Kyou:
Maybe all of us haven't really become friends yet?

Tomoya:
Hmm...

Kyou:
She's not home?

Nagisa:
Or maybe she could just be resting in bed.

Tomoya:
Hm?

Kyou:
Why don't we call it a day and come back tomorrow?

Nagisa:
Okazaki?
Okazaki, is something the matter?

Tomoya:
Uh, it's nothing.


Nagisa:
Okazaki?

Tomoya:
Huh?
Yeah, what is it, Nagisa?

Nagisa:
It seems like you've been in a daze since earlier today.

Tomoya:
That house we saw today...
I feel there's something familiar about it.
But I can't figure out what it is.
It's strange...

Nagisa:
What's the matter with you?

Tomoya:
You guys just go on home, and I'll see you tomorrow!

Nagisa:
Hey, wait up!


Tomoya:
Hey, you! What are you doing sneaking around like this?

Gentleman:
You're that boy who was with...

Tomoya:
What kind of business do you have with this house?

Gentleman:
Look, kid, I'm sorry.
I guess that my behavior is bound to arouse more than a little suspicion around here.
I rang the bell, but no one answered.
So, I went around the back and was looking around.

Tomoya:
So, tell me who you are exactly.

Gentleman:
Actually, I'm just an old work acquaintance of Kotomi's parents.
I was one of the members of their science research team.
And I've known Kotomi Ichinose ever since she was little.

Tomoya:
Wait a sec. Are you saying you came to see Kotomi's parents?

Gentleman:
Oh? I see. So you must not be aware of it.

Tomoya:
What?

Gentleman:
Well, she hasn't told you about it, and I'm afraid it's not my place to say.
It's a personal matter I shouldn't discuss.

Tomoya:
That's what the teacher said.
Kotomi's parents are really important scientists, isn't that correct?
Are they both famous for any scientific experiment that they're doing?

Gentleman:
The universe is not just that which we can see.
When this world was developing its ideal shape and form, a microscopic dimension was sealed away.
A hidden world exists.
The Ichinoses were the first to ascertain that.
Or perhaps it's more correct to say, they were supposed to have ascertained that.

Tomoya:
Well, all that sounds awfully complex to a kid like me.

Gentleman:
I can say that for those of us who assisted this revolutionary research, it was the honor of a lifetime.
However... I'm afraid that's about all I can say regarding this matter.
Let me ask you something.
Did Kotomi say anything about me?

Tomoya:
She said that you were a bad man.

Gentleman:
I guess to Kotomi, every one of us are still very bad.
Tell me, are you a classmate of hers by any chance?

Tomoya:
She and I are in different classes, but we're friends all the same.

Gentleman:
I see.
If you have a chance, would you please give her a message for me.
None of us really expect her to be forgiving, but there's not a member of the team that doesn't regret what happened back then.

Tomoya:
What happened then?

Gentleman:
That's all.
Now, excuse me.


Tomoya:
I've seen this place before.
No, I've never rang through the front door. Somewhere else...

Kotomi:
The day before yesterday, I saw a rabbit.

Tomoya:
Ah...

Kotomi:
The day before yesterday, I saw a rabbit.
Yesterday, it was a deer.
And today, it's you.

Tomoya:
You and I did meet - we met when we were children.
