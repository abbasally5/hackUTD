  Tomoya:
Don't you need to tell Sanae and your old man that you're going to school?


-OP-


Nagisa:
Those pictures...

Tomoya:
Yeah?

Nagisa:
My father used to be an actor.
I had no idea.
He was really popular in student theater back when he was in high school.
Apparently, he won a bunch of competitions too.
They never said a word to me.
I knew my mother used to be a middle school teacher, but that's all they told me.

I couldn't help but notice how happy my parents looked in all those photos.
But of course they were happy.
They were living out their dreams.

Tomoya:
Nagisa...

Nagisa:
Not only that, it was a happiness that could have lasted forever.
If only I... was never born...

Tomoya:
That's not true!
Besides, don't you think they're still happy now?

Nagisa:
But they still had to give up on their dreams!
Am I wrong?

And look at me. All this time, I've been trying to live out my dream without ever thinking that they had to sacrifice theirs.
And I did the same thing to you, too.
I'm so ungrateful.
I've been such a terrible daughter to them.
I was so set on my dream, I've made everyone else suffer for it.
I've wasted all their time.

Tomoya:
It's not a waste--we wanted to help.
But if you get discouraged and give up now, then all the work that everyone's done will be for nothing.
We all gave it our best to make it this far.
We can't give up


第22回 影二つ (Two Shadows)


Youhei:
I could really go for a nap.

Kyou:
You're not nervous at all, are you?

Ryou:
Nagisa, what's wrong?

Nagisa:
Huh?

Tomoya:
She's just a little stressed out about the show, that's all.
Tell them.

Nagisa:
Uh, yeah.

Youhei:
What's going on?
She's acting kinda strange.

Tomoya:
It's kind of a long story.
Just try to act normal, okay?

Youhei:
Huh...
Nagisa, let me show you a little trick for good luck.
Write the character for person on your hand three times.
Person, person, person...

Kotomi:
That's the character for "enter," not "person."

Youhei:
Who cares?! Just let me finish!

Kyou:
If you can't write the kanji, then the trick isn't gonna work!

Youhei:
It's the thought that counts, okay?

Kyou:
Oh, give me a break!

Youhei:
What does it matter to you, anyway?

Tomoya:
Our performance isn't till later.
You wanna walk around for a little bit?

Youhei:
Oh, yeah. I should probably show Mei around.

Kyou:
Then we'll just do our own thing until the performance, okay?

Tomoya:
So, what do you wanna check out?
Nagisa?

Nagisa:
Oh, uh. Wait, what was that?
I'm sorry.
I know I need to keep it together for the performance today.
But I still have a lot of stuff on my mind.
But I took what you said earlier to heart - the thing about us all working on the play together, I mean.
It wouldn't be fair to everyone else if I ruin the show just 'cause I was upset.

Tomoya:
That's right. Just hang in there!

Nagisa:
Right.


Nagisa:
Okazaki?

Tomoya:
Now where the heck did she run off to?
Ah, Sanae!

Sanae:
Oh hello, Okazaki.

Tomoya:
Wait, didn't you bring the old man with you?

Sanae:
Akio? No, he told me to go ahead on my own for now.

Tomoya:
You think he'll actually come?

Sanae:
Don't worry about it.
He wouldn't miss Nagisa's performance for the world.
I'm sure of it.

Akio:
So she knows everything now, huh?

Tomoya:
By the time I found her, it was already too late.

Nagisa:
What's Nagisa doing right now?

Tomoya:
I don't know. We got separated.

Sanae:
I see.

Isogai:
Mrs. Furukawa?

Sanae:
Oh, Mrs. Isogai!
Well, I'll see you later, Okazaki.
I'm sure Nagisa's nervous, so please take care of her, okay?


Nagisa:
Excuse me.

Yukine:
Oh, Furukawa.
And what brings you here today?

Nagisa:
Well, I uh...
I'm looking for something Okazaki mentioned to me a while back.
You have a lot of materials from old high school plays here, right?

Yukine:
Do you need to use something as a reference for your show?

Nagisa:
Yes.

Yukine:
I'm looking forward to seeing you perform this afternoon.
Break a leg out there, okay?

Nagisa:
Right.

Yukine:
I'm sorry, but I need to step out for a bit.
Still feel free to look through anything you like while I'm gone.

Nagisa:
Okay, thank you very much.

Tomoya:
Miyazawa!

Yukine:
Oh hi, Okazaki.

Tomoya:
Have you seen Nagisa anywhere?

Yukine:
Oh, she's looking through some materials from the old High School Theater in the second library.

Tomoya:
Ha...


Tomoya:
Nagisa!

Video:
...who released me from the cruel shackle and rescued me from death, may that man die!
It was a thankless act. Had I perished then, I would have not come to kill my father and then
would not see me as the husband of the woman who gave birth to me!

Tomoya:
This is your dad's...

Nagisa:
It's a video of Dad acting in a play back when he was in high school.
He won an award for this performance in the drama competition that year.

Video:
What is there for me to see, my friends?
With such days upon me, could I look into your eyes?
Apollo brought upon me these awful things I suffer.
But the hand that stabs out my eyes...

Nagisa:
He's really good.
When this was filmed, he was a senior just like me.
There's a world of difference.
You can't even compare us.

Woman:
Now, let's have Furukawa, the president of the Drama Club, say a few words about their win.
Go ahead.

Akio:
I love being an actor!
Yeah!
I'm gonna keep doing theater for the rest of my life!
Not only that, one day I'm gonna become a professional actor!
Ha ha. This is just the beginning!

Woman:
Well, that certainly is a nice aspiration, but could you please give us a few words as club president?

Akio:
Live theater is the best!

Tomoya:
You're you, Nagisa.
You just have to do what you can do and nothing else.
Am I right?

Announcer:
And that concludes our performance from the Choir Club.
Next is a solo play, written and performed by Nagisa Furukawa, and presented by the Drama Club.
Please stand by while the stage is being set.

Kyou:
Nagisa!

Youhei:
It's time for your big debut!

Ryou:
Don't be nervous!
I'm sure you're going to be a big hit!

Kotomi:
Just do it like you did in the dress rehearsal, and you'll be fine.

Kyou:
Don't freak out, okay?
Let's just have fun!

Botan:
Puhi~! Puhi~!

Announcer:
Thanks for waiting.
The Drama Club will now present "Fantasia Story."

Tomoya:
Nagisa, here we go!


Nagisa:
That's what I'm trying to find out.
That way, I can apologize.

Sanae:
No problem. Leave it to me!

Youhei:
Nagisa?

Akio:
Oh, I rented a video you guys might like. Here!

Kyou:
Something's wrong.

Akio:
Ah, good to see you.
You're the fruit of our love after all.

Sanae:
Ah...

Girl:
What's wrong with her?

Girl:
Stage fright, maybe?

Tomoyo:
Come on! You can do this!

Kotomi:
Nagisa's acting strange.

Ryou:
Do you think she's just nervous?

Youhei:
What now, Okazaki?

Kyou:
Should we drop the curtains?

Tomoya:
It'll be fine.
She can do this, I know it.

Akio:
I love being an actor!
Yeah!
I love being an actor!
Yeah!
I'm gonna keep doing theater for the rest of my life!
I'm gonna keep doing theater for the rest of my life!
Not only that, one day I'm gonna become a professional actor!
Not only that, one day I'm gonna become a professional actor!
Not only that, one day I'm gonna become a professional actor!
Live theater is the best!
Live theater is the best!
Live theater is the best!

Guy:
Is this part of the play?

Guy:
It looks she is crying for real!

Youhei:
This is bad! Drop the curtain!

Kyou:
Tomoya!

Akio:
Make your dream come true, Nagisa!!

Kyou:
What the...?

Tomoya:
Old man?!

Akio:
Nagisa!
Are you stupid or what?!
A child's dream IS their parents' dream.
You can make it come true for us!
Don't you realize that our dream is to watch you live out your dream?!
Your mom and I didn't give up our dreams at all!
You get it, Nagisa?
You ARE our dream!
That's what being parents is all about!
That's what being a family is all about!
Since then... ever since that day, we've been baking our bread... waiting, longing for today to come!
If you get discouraged and give up now, then all our dreams die.
You got that?!
This is your responsibility now, get it?!
Sanae! You're here, aren't you?
You tell her, too!

Sanae:
You can do it, Nagisa!

Kyou:
What... What's going on?
Tomoya!

Tomoya:
The same goes for us too, Nagisa!
What you're trying to make happen right now is what Sunohara and I couldn't do.
All of our failures and frustrations are resting on your shoulders now!


Nagisa:
If you'd like...
If you'd like, shall I take you... to the place in town where wishes come true?

Tomoya:
Take us there, Nagisa!
Take all of us.

Nagisa:
This is a world that has come to an end - an empty and still world where no one exists but I.
There's a small table and chair in this room.
But outside the window, there is nothing but an empty plain; stretching into an endless horizon.
This building is old; I don't know how long ago it was built.
I live here alone, passing time in solitude.
Sometimes I venture outside, picking up little odds and ends that I might need.
Of course, there is no one outside, either.
But under the fading sun, a sea of a tiny lights are fluttering about.
Amidst those lights, I picked up wood scraps, nails and many other things.
My purpose was to create a friend.
But now, even as I construct him, I wonder if anyone would be happy to be born into a world like this?
At every turn, those feelings of doubt still haunt me.

"I":
This world has come to an end.
It will not give birth to another life.
This girl is the only living creature that remains.
Some time long ago, or perhaps in the distant future, I was in a different world.
It was a world full of life.
But I can no longer return to that place, because now I exist inside this body that she made for me.

The girl:
What's the matter?
Should I make another?
But why? It won't be able to move.
We can't do it. We can't make friends.
But you don't want me to make a friend this time?
Something else?

"I":
I don't know what, but we have to make something.
She can create something new from junk parts--just like she created me.
We can't let that special gift of hers go to waste.

The girl:
Yeah, you're right.
If we try hard enough, with time, we may be able to make something truly wonderful.
Well, what shall we make then?

"I":
Something that will make my heart leap!
She'll make it, and I can help her.
That, in itself, is a wonderful thing!
I'll stay by her side, doing whatever I can.
We'll be together forever.
And one day, the two of us will leave this place.
Then we'll travel to the warm and beautiful world that I once lived in.


Nagisa:
I remembered the rest!

Tomoya:
Hm?

Nagisa:
The rest of the story, I mean.
Eventually, the girl and the little doll decide to leave that sad and empty world behind.
'Cause the little doll knew that somewhere, far far away, there was another world for them to live in - one full of warm and life.

Tomoya:
So, what happens then?

Nagisa:
They set out on a long long journey, and at the end...

Tomoya:
And at the end?

Nagisa:
They sing a song.

Tomoya:
Ugh. You serious?

Nagisa:
Of course, I am.
They sing a song at the end of the journey, so I sang a song at the end of the play.
Why else do you think I would do something like that?

Tomoya:
All right, I'll give you that.
But I doubt she would have sang the "Big Dango Family" song.

Nagisa:
Well, no. That part was just me!

Tomoya:
I know everyone applauded and all, but I think they were a little confused by the ending.
That song kind of ruined the whole emotional build-up.

Nagisa:
I just really wanted to sing it, that's all.

Tomoya:
Well, whatever.
Other than the song, the play was great!

Nagisa:
Do you really mean it?

Tomoya:
I never flatter people.
You know that!

Nagisa:
Yeah, I do.
That's why I was surprised to hear you say that.

Nagisa, Tomoya:
Huh?

Nagisa:
I'm glad to see you came.

Naoyuki:
I got an invitation after all.

Tomoya:
Uh...

Nagisa:
I'm sorry if I was out of line by telling him.
But I thought he should know what was going on at least.

Naoyuki:
I saw the play this afternoon.
It was a wonderful story.

Nagisa:
Thank you very much!

Naoyuki:
It made me think a lot about the past, in a good way.

Well, I suppose I should be going now.

Nagisa:
Okay.

Tomoya:
Don't drink too much, all right?

Nagisa:
Hey, Okazaki?

Tomoya:
Listen, you wanna go somewhere with me tomorrow?

Nagisa:
Huh?

Tomoya:
It's a three-day weekend, right?
It'd be nice if it was just us two.
There's something I wanna talk about.

Nagisa:
Talk about?

Kyou:
Ah ha! So there you are!
Everyone's waiting in the club room.
We can't start the party without the director and the big star!

Tomoya:
Sorry about that.
Let's go.

Nagisa:
Okay!


Nagisa:
Don't we need to get permission to go inside the school like this?

Tomoya:
Whatever.
We're students here, so I'm sure it's fine.

Nagisa:
I guess you're right.

Tomoya:
You know, lately...

Nagisa:
Hm?

Tomoya:
Lately, I've been starting to feel like this school isn't so bad after all.

Nagisa:
Well, is that so?
I'm happy to hear you say that.
Huh? I'm the class monitor? Since when?

Tomoya:
Oh, yeah. I put that up there as a joke when you were absent.
Forgot about that.

Nagisa:
And all this time, I never noticed it.
Hmm...

There, we're even now! Heh he.

Tomoya:
Ah!
I said before that we had something to talk about.

Nagisa:
Yeah, is something on you mind?

Tomoya:
Well, uh...
I'm not sure how to say this...

Nagisa:
Hm?

Tomoya:
Uh...
Wouldn't it be funny if we woke up tomorrow and we were boyfriend and girlfriend?

Nagisa:
Huh?

Tomoya:
Will you go out with me, Nagisa?
I love you, Nagisa.
So I... I wanna spend every day of my life together with you!
