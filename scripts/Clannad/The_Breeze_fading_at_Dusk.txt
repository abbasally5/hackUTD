  Nagisa:
Okazaki? Okazaki?

Tomoya:
Huh?
Oh, sorry. What is it, Furukawa?

Nagisa:
I have to say you've been acting weird ever since this morning.

Fuko:
So, it appears to me you've returned to being a weird guy once again.

Tomoya:
You're the only one who says I'm weird!

Nagisa:
I forgot to tell you about Miss Ibuki.
She called me just last night on my cell, and told me that the wedding will be next Sunday.

Tomoya:
Is that so?
Then, Mr. Koumura must have gotten the approval of the vice-principal.

Nagisa:
Soon all of your hard efforts will bear good fruit, Fu-chan!

Fuko:
Yes!

Tomoya:
Hm...


- OP -


Fuko:
Please accept this!

Hey there, would you please accept this?!

Nagisa:
It's starting to seem to me that more and more people are not accepting them.
And it's not just that they're not accepting them, but it's like they somehow don't notice Fu-chan at all.

Youhei:
And that's not all.
I don't think people are remembering her.

Tomoya:
It's just his imagination.

Tomoyo:
You're not with Sunohara today?

Tomoya:
He said he was going to cut class right now.

Nagisa:
Hi, Tomoyo. It's been a little while!

Tomoyo:
Wait a minute. You're...

Nagisa:
I'm Nagisa Furukawa.
We met at the Founder's Festival, remember?
And my dear friend Fu-chan gave you the sculpture.

Tomoyo:
Sculpture?

Tomoya:
Hey, this little thing.

Tomoyo:
Ah...

Nagisa:
Tomoyo?

Tomoyo:
I remember...
That's right, I received a lovely little sculpture from her.
To forget after receiving a present was rude of me.
Hey, wait just a minute...
But that's so strange...
How could I forget that sweet little girl?

Nagisa:
Okazaki...


第8回 黄昏に消える風 (The Breeze Fading at Dusk)


Fuko:
Today, there are a lot of starfish left.

Tomoya:
Don't worry about it.
There are days like this.

Nagisa:
That's right. We'll work harder tomorrow to make up for today.

Tomoya:
There she goes again.

Wow, you returned to yourself awfully quickly today.

Fuko:
My body warned me all of sudden.
It said "Run away, this guy's dangerous!"

Tomoya:
You must be imagining it.

Nagisa:
It's not her imagination.
Remember how you're always playing such dirty tricks on her?
Moving her to a different place and making her embrace Sunohara's head.

Fuko:
So, it was your doing after all!
That's the mini-worst thing I've ever seen!

Tomoya:
And what exactly do you mean by saying "mini-worst"?

Fuko:
You seem to be hurt when I say the worst, so I made it up for you.
Even if you're called that, I think it's cute.
It might just be the most adorable thing ever.
How about it?

Tomoya:
It doesn't do any good unless you stop using the word "worst"!

Fuko:
I can't change that!
If anything, I'll change the "mini" part!

Tomoya:
Fine!
Then, change "mini" to "I am," will ya!

Fuko:
I am the worst!
Oh, no, no. That makes me the worst!

Tomoya:
No good?

Nagisa:
You two are on good terms after all!

Tomoya:
Hm.
Hey, Mitsui!

Mitsui:
Oh, from the other day...
I'm sorry, I can't remember who you two were again.

Fuko, Nagisa:
Huh?

Tomoya:
What do you mean "who were we"?
You received one from Fuko too, didn't you?
One that looks like this.

Mitsui:
Do you mean this little star thing?

Nagisa:
Mitsui, you accepted one, remember?
And you said you'd attend Fu-chan's sister's wedding.

Mitsui:
I'm so sorry, I don't know what all of this is about.

Tomoya:
Fuko, it's about Fuko!
She's right in front of your eyes!

Mitsui:
Her?

Tomoya:
No, not her!
Can't you see there's another person there?

Mitsui:
There is no one over there.
Is this some kind of little joke or something?
Excuse me.

Nagisa:
Fu-chan...

Tomoya:
Fuko!

Nagisa:
Okazaki, this is so weird.

Tomoya:
She's being forgotten by everyone she knows.

Nagisa:
What?

Tomoya:
It may be because her condition has changed.
Everyone's losing their memory of her.
It may be that her very existence is beginning to fade.

Nagisa:
But that's...


Tomoya:
Hey, Fuko. Don't let it bother you.
Mitsui was just joking around with you, that's all.
And if she wasn't, she must have misunderstood.

Nagisa:
Yeah, she probably just didn't remember
You know how the seniors are so busy with entrance exams.

Tomoya:
Don't you worry about it.
Furukawa and I are with you all the way.
Besides, tomorrow, Sunohara should be there for you as well.
And don't forget your legion of many ardent fans too.
Come on, don't lose your momentum! Cheer up a little!

Fuko:
Yes, I promise I'll do my best.

Nagisa:
Ah...


Akio:
Hmm...
I think I'm getting better at this starfish business.

Sanae:
The starfish pastries are quite popular, you know.
We have those who buy them regularly.

Tomoya:
Are you serious?

Fuko:
If no one else thinks so, I think they're a great hit!

Sanae:
I'm so glad!

Then I'll make a special starfish pastry just for you.

Fuko:
Really? You will? I'm so thrilled!

Akio:
Nagisa, you're awfully quiet today.

Nagisa
Yes, I was engrossed in carving the starfish.
He he...

Woman:
Excuse me!
Anyone here?

Fuko:
You have a customer in your store.

Akio:
Don't talk to me! I'm doing a difficult part.

Fuko:
Ah!

Woman:
Isn't there someone working?

Tomoya:
Shouldn't you go and see what she wants?

Akio:
It's okay, just pretend that we're out.

Sanae:
Shame on you!
Besides, with all the noise we're making, there's no use pretending that.

Akio:
Ugh, oh no!

Tomoya:
Something's different after all...

Akio:
All that griping is getting on my nerves you little brat!
Argh!

Sanae:
Oh, dear!
I've got the first-aid kit, my darling!

Akio:
Sanae, it's all over for me...

Sanae:
Get a hold of yourself, my dearest darling!

Nagisa:
Don't worry, Mom.
I'll take good care of the bakery.

Akio:
I leave the rest to you, dear daughter...

Nagisa:
Thank you very much for coming!

Akio:
No! Intense pain!
More gently [please / ???]!

Tomoya:
I have to say I'm very relieved that your family is still the same.

Sanae:
Akio, I can't treat the wound if you're moving so violently.
Fuko, hold him down!

Fuko:
I understand!

Tomoya:
Furukawa...

Nagisa:
I know, I'm sorry.
I was holding it back, but...

What's going to happen now?
Will everyone just steadily forget Fu-chan?
It could be that you and I will too.

Tomoya:
There's no way that would ever happen.
Besides, the wedding is right around the corner.
You and I will do our best to support Fuko in her project.

Yes, until her dream ends.


Tomoya:
Ugh!

Misae:
I've had it you guys!

Tomoya:
Well, tell me. What did they all do this time?

Misae:
They're all so darn picky about their food!
I was going to give them all a piece of my mind.
They're not in grade school, you know.


Tomoya:
I told you, Misae, you're too easy on them.
If they don't eat what you serve, do your special move on them, no questions asked.
Then, I bet the entire team will have a change of heart.

Misae:
So, is that the way it is with you guys?

Tomoya:
Yeah.
Oh, I almost forgot. Misae, here.

Misae:
Huh?
What is this?

Tomoya:
Kouko Ibuki, a former teacher here is getting married.
That's in place of an invitation.
We'd really like you to come.

Misae:
Hmm...

Tomoya:
What were you doing yesterday and today?
Fuko was waiting, you know?

Youhei:
Fuko-chan?
I skipped a few of my classes and did some research... on the girl named Fuko Ibuki.

Tomoya:
Uh...
Why did you do something like that?

Youhei:
The woman getting married on Sunday is named Ibuki, isn't she?
Then, Fuko's last name is Ibuki after all.
Fuko Isogai is a lie.
But Fuko Ibuki is in the hospital.
Then, who is this girl with us?
I mean, do you even know who this girl really is?
For all we know, she could be faking her identity!
If she's a fake, then that's okay too, I guess.
But I don't think she is.
I have a hunch that she's...
Okazaki...
Is it okay if I verify her ID?

Tomoya:
Do what?

Youhei:
I was thinking about going to the nearby town and have myself have a good hard look at Fuko Ibuki.

Tomoya:
That's stupid! Don't do it!

Youhei:
And, why not?

Tomoya:
I think if he sees the hospitalized Fuko, he'll forget Fuko too.

Youhei:
Okazaki.
You're not telling me something, aren't you?
About Fuko Ibuki.
If you don't wanna tell me, I won't force you.
But I have to check it out or I won't be satisfied.

Fuko:
Excuse me, little boy!
Here you go.
Excuse me...

Tomoya:
That guy was even a more ardent fan than the others.

Nagisa:
There are even more people passing her by than yesterday.

Youhei:
Good morning, Nagisa!
And you too, Okazaki.

Tomoya:
Morning? It's lunch time already.

Nagisa:
Sunohara, did you just arrive at school?

Youhei:
A strange thing happened...
Is that what amnesia's like?
A little while ago, when I came to, I was walking out of a hospital in the neighboring town.
I honestly don't remember at all why I went all the way over there.
I mean, why did I go to a hospital?
Maybe I was half asleep and in a daze.

Tomoya:
Sunohara, don't you want one of Fuko's starfish?

Youhei:
A starfish?

Tomoya:
You haven't received one yet, have you?

Fuko:
Will you please accept this?

Youhei:
Huh?

Kyou:
Hey, Youhei!

Youhei:
Kyou!

Kyou:
You were late again today, weren't you?
Remember that if you don't have enough attendance days, don't look at me!

Youhei:
So, tell me why you're so concerned about my attendance all of a sudden?

Kyou:
When you cut classes, the teacher scolds my sister, the class leader.
And that is not cool with me!

Nagisa:
Fu-chan...

Kyou:
Huh? What's that?

Ryou:
It looks like a star.

Kyou:
Why are you guys holding on to those things?

Ryou:
Sis, doesn't it remind you of something?

Kyou:
I kind of feel that way too.

Nagisa:
But this is Fu-chan!
Don't you remember?
We all had a pretend class together.

Tomoya:
Can't you see her?
She's right here! Look at her!

Kyou:
Hmm..

Tomoya:
Look, you should have one like it at home!
I know you took one. You have to remember it.
Please, Kyou! You simply have to remember!

Kyou:
No good. I can't remember.
Oh! It's so irritating!

Ryou:
Sis, calm down.

Nagisa:
Oh Fu-chan...


Tomoya:
So, the forgetting starts with those who didn't know her well.
Someday, I too...

Nagisa:
I-I don't wanna forget, Fu-chan.
If I forget Fu-chan, well, we won't be friends anymore!
We spent time together at school and ate together.
Forgetting all that is too sad!

Tomoya:
You were always by Fuko's side and thought of her more than anyone.
Even if I should forget, you won't forget.
I know that in my heart.

Nagisa:
Do you really think so?


Fuko:
Excuse me, little boy. Here!

W-W-Would you please accept this?
Excuse me, will you please accept this?
Take this!
Please?

Youhei:
Hey, the two of you!
You wanna go eat?

Tomoya:
No, go on by yourself. We're a little busy here.

Youhei:
Nagisa, being alone with this guy is boring, isn't it?
Let's go to the cafeteria and talk of love!

Nagisa:
Uh... W-Well, we...

Tomoya:
Stop it, will ya?!

Youhei:
Chut! Why are you acting so irritated?
Hey, Fuko, will you say something to him already?

Tomoya:
Ah...

Nagisa:
Huh?

Youhei:
Uh-oh. I just said something really strange, didn't I?

Tomoya:
A person's name...
You just said a girl's name, didn't you?!

Nagisa:
Sunohara, please! You have to remember!

Youhei:
N-No, I can't.
I can't remember anymore.
But there's a feeling left, like there was someone like that.
It's kind of hard to explain it.

Fuko:
Here. Take this.

Youhei:
So, why do I have something like this little thing?
What is this exactly?
Some kind of star? Is it a shuriken?
I don't understand.
Okazaki, Nagisa, please listen.
I didn't... I didn't dislike her.
I honestly didn't...
That's what I think at least.

Nagisa:
It's Fu-chan, Sunohara.
It's Fuko!

Youhei:
Fuko-chan?

Tomoya:
It's all right, that's enough.
Thanks so much. You're a good friend.

Nagisa:
He's such a kind person.

Tomoya:
No, he's an idiot.
He didn't even try to be close friends with Fuko when he could see her, and that just wasn't cool.

Nagisa:
He is going to come to Miss Ibuki's wedding.
Don't you forget about that, Okazaki.


Tomoya:
Are you going to the wedding in that outfit?

Fuko:
If I go home, I have other clothes.

Tomoya:
We can't go get them, can we?

Nagisa:
The wedding will be held at school, so isn't the uniform still appropriate?

Tomoya:
That's true, but shall we buy some accessories?

Fuko:
I don't have any money.

Tomoya:
If it's not anything extravagant, I'll buy it for you.
When is your birthday?

Fuko:
July.

Nagisa:
If it's in July, then it's a little early for her birthday present.

Tomoya:
I'll do it to commemorate your promise never to say "the worst" again.

Fuko:
I'll keep on saying it.

Tomoya:
Then, to commemorate your graduation from starfish.

Fuko:
I'll walk with the starfish forever!

Nagisa:
No, come on, Okazaki.
I think that our desire to purchase our friend Fu-chan a present is good enough, don't you?

Tomoya:
I guess so.

Tomoya:
Ha ha! It doesn't match her!

Nagisa:
Okazaki, stop!

Fuko:
That was very insulting!

Tomoya:
Oh, this is your kind of stuff.

Nagisa:
It's a birthday party set.

Fuko:
Aaaaah...

Tomoya:
Fuko!

Nagisa:
Fu-chan?

Fuko:
I'm sorry, I imagined myself wearing that.

Tomoya:
So, I take it that you really want this thing?

Fuko:
I don't want it!

Tomoya:
Then, let's go.

Fuko:
Ugh...

Tomoya:
You are such a little child.

Fuko:
Oh, no.
I can't get it out of my head!
It's so very enticing.
I can't stop thinking about it!
If Nagisa and I weren't here, Okazaki, you'd buy it for me in a second.
I know you would!

Tomoya:
I would never.


Fuko:
I'm so very, very happy!

Tomoya:
Oh, just as long as you're happy.

Fuko:
I have to say that I'm starting to feel that you're not such a bad sort, Okazaki.

Tomoya:
That's weird, because you've thought of me as a bad person up until now.

Fuko:
I like you better than a sea slug.

Tomoya:
Really? Great!
But I have no idea what level that would be.
I like the sea slug fairly well, so you should be glad.

Nagisa:
Don't you think that's nice, Okazaki?

Tomoya:
Right now, Fuko thinks...
Hey!
I really don't wanna be sandwiched between those things.

Nagisa:
Okazaki just has a sharp tongue.
He's really a warm person on the inside.

Tomoya:
Furukawa,
I'm surprised you can say such embarrassing things out loud like that.

Nagisa:
Is it embarrassing to you?

Tomoya:
I'm leaving.

Nagisa:
Okazaki!
Look, Okazaki, a fountain!

Fu-chan, look over here!
A pretty fountain!


Tomoya:
Hello?
Fuko:
We're all home!

Akio:
Huh?

Nagisa:
Is something wrong? What's the matter, Dad?

Akio:
Oh, no, no. That's nothing wrong.
I thought there was a girl standing between the two of you.
Been like this all day.
I don't know, it feels like I've forgotten to do something very important.
Like I might even eat Sanae's pastries by mistake.
For times like this, this is the only remedy.
I'll be hitting some balls with the kids.
Come on!

Nagisa:
Dad's having a hard time with it.

Tomoya:
He hasn't forgotten completely, like Sunohara and Kyou.

Fuko:
I know.

Tomoya:
Akio likes you too.
That's why he's suffering so.

Fuko:
Then, I'm happy.

Nagisa:
Uh... Mother?

Sanae:
Welcome home.
My darling Nagisa, and to you Mr. Okazaki, and you Fuko.

Fuko:
Glad to be here.

Nagisa:
We're all home now!

Sanae:
Did you have fun at school today?
Perhaps, maybe the three of us can take a hot bath together.
Little Fuko?
And my little daughter Nagisa as well?

Nagisa:
Mother...

Sanae:
I can't see Fuko!
Today, I went to the hospital.
I heard about Miss Ibuki's marriage and thought Fuko might be Miss Ibuki's sister.
So I went to verify it.

Tomoya:
Sanae...

Sanae:
Since then, I've been just like Akio.
Our dear little Fuko is disappearing from our minds.
But she... Fuko's still here, isn't she?
Tell me she's still here!

Nagisa:
Yes, she is. She's right here.
She's right here.

Sanae:
Dear Fuko...
You can stay here forever if you want to.
Akio, Nagisa and I... all think of you as family!


Tomoya:
This moment really comes.

Nagisa:
So, it seems that my own mother and father already forgot...

Tomoya:
So, tell me. Do you want to go to school, Fuko?

My dad's gonna be at my house all night and I don't think I have time to take you Sunohara's place.
