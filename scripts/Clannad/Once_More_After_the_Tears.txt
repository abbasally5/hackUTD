第03回 涙のあとにもう一度 (Once More After the Tears)


Akio:


Tomoya:
Sorry, but I'm not here to buy anything.

Akio:


Tomoya:
How's Nagisa? Is there any change in her condition?

Akio:


Tomoya:
I didn't ask you if she was calling my name.

Akio:


Tomoya:


Sanae:


Tomoya:
Yes. I heard that she's bedridden.

Sanae:


Tomoya:
Is that right?

Akio:


Tomoya:
No, it was really the least I could do.

Akio:
Here's a bag of Sanae's pastries. Take 'em.

Tomoya:
Huh?

Akio:
Consider them a thank-you gift for all your kindness.

Tomoya:


Akio:


Sanae:
My homemade pastries...

Akio:
Agh! I love 'em baby, of course!

Tomoya:
Well, judging from that, I guess there's nothing to worry about now, is there?

Kouko:
Excuse me. Where are the owners?

Tomoya:


Kouko:
Are you sure it's all right?

Tomoya:
Yes, I got them for free of charge, actually.

Kouko:


Tomoya:
She's really pretty...

Tomoya:


Man:
You, you! You there! C-come with me a minute!
Just look at that dent, will ya?!
I know that some construction tool caused this.
And I'm gonna need you to be my witness!

Tomoya:
Be your witness?

Yusuke:
I don't think it's a good idea to get someone who's not involved.

Man:
But without a witness, you'll just drive off, right?!

Yusuke:


Man:
And why should I believe you?!

Yusuke:
If you want me pay for repairs, I'll do it.

Man:
Ha-hah! So you admit it!

Yusuke:


Man:
What the hell is this guy talking about?

Tomoya:
Don't ask me. I think he's nuts.

Yusuke:


Man:
Uh, yeah, I guess I can.

Yusuke:


Tomoya:
Boy, this guy can say such hammy lines with such conviction.

Tomoya:
Say!

Man:
Hm?

Tomoya:
I think it was a cat.

Man:
A cat?!

Tomoya:
If you look at it from this angle, see there?

Man:
Huh! Yeah, you're right.
...

Tomoya:


Cat:
Rawr! Arwww!

Yusuke:


Tomoya:


Yusuke:



Youhei:
What did he say to you?

Tomoya:


Youhei:


Tomoya:
So you know this guy?

Youhei:


Tomoya:
Really?

Youhei:


Tomoya:
Just a minute. You have a younger sister?

Youhei:
I do. Didn't I tell ya that?

Tomoya:


Youhei:


Tomoya:
Yeah, what is it?

Youhei:


Tomoya:
Uh?

Youhei:


Tomoya:
Are you being serious, dude?

Youhei:

Tomoya:
At that moment, Sunohara didn't realize yet, that he was beginning his life as a pervert.

Youhei:
I can hear what you're saying, you know.


Tomoyo:
Haven't you learned your lesson?

Youhei:


Tomoya:
Just listen to what he has to say, will you?

Youhei:


Tomoyo:
Your character seems to have changed a little.

Youhei:


Tomoyo:
I see.

Youhei:
I hate to ask you, but could you lend me your razor?

Tomoyo:
And why exactly should I have to lend you my razor?

Youhei:


Tomoya:
Well, I did, but...

Tomoyo:
What is he so excited about?

Youhei:


Tomoyo:


Youhei:
In the first place?

Tomoyo:
Don't you know it's rude to ask a girl something like that?!

Youhei:


Tomoyo:
So long!


Nagisa:


Tomoya:


Nagisa:


Tomoya:
Well yeah, you may be just a little silly. But I think it's kinda sweet.

Nagisa:
Really, you do?

Tomoya:


Nagisa:
Huh?

Tomoya:


Nagisa:
Okay, if I feel like I'm about to cry, I'll call you.

Tomoya:
Uh...?

Nagisa:
Huh?

Tomoya:
What are you doing to me?

Fuko:
I'm looking... for my knife!

Nagisa:
Your knife?

Tomoya:
Oh. You mean this?

Fuko:
Give it back to me!

Tomoya:
How are your hands?

Fuko:
They don't hurt anymore! I'm fine!

Tomoya:
Shake!

Fuko:
Okay!

Tomoya:
It hurts, doesn't it?

Fuko:
No, it doesn't!

Nagisa:
It seems like it'd be painful.

Tomoya:
High five me!

Fuko:
Dribble... dribble... dribble... and shoot!

Tomoya:
From there again?

Fuko:
I win it!

Tomoya:


Fuko:
It doesn't hurt!

Nagisa:
It does look painful.

Tomoya:


Fuko:
Uh...

Nagisa:
I don't know about this.

Tomoya:


Fuko:
Yeah, I got it.

Tomoya:


Fuko:
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two.

Tomoya:
How long are you going to keep that up?

Fuko:
Oh.

Tomoya:
It's the first bell, let's go.

Nagisa:
Uh, okay!

Fuko:
Um, you can have this.

Tomoya:





Tomoya:


Youhei:
Class is over?

Tomoya:
Yeah, around a hundred years ago, actually.

Youhei:


Tomoya:
Right. I'm not me, I'm a hologram.

Youhei:
Are you serious?

Tomoya:


Youhei:


Tomoya:
Total chaos.

Youhei:


Tomoya:
Come on. Get up, will you?

Youhei:


Tomoya:

Youhei:
Then, what you said about the world falling into ruins?

Tomoya:
It's true.

Youhei:


Tomoya:
You'd believe anything, wouldn't you?

Youhei:
Huh? You mean that was a lie?!

Tomoya:
You actually believed it?

Youhei:


Youhei:
Are you looking for something?

Botan:
Puhi~! Puhi~! Puhi~!



Tomoya:
Yeah, there's something about him that's missing in a dog or a cat.

Youhei:
So, what is it?

Tomoya:
I don't know.

Youhei:


Kyou:
Hey!

Youhei:
Huh? Argh!!

Tomoya:
Sunohara! So, how did that compare with Tomoyo's kick?

Youhei:


Kyou:
You pervert!

Youhei:
Ahhh!

Botan:
Puhi~!

Kyou:
How dare you! What were you trying to do with my baby?!

Tomoya:
So, what is that thing, your pet?

Kyou:


Tomoya:
Did it come to meet you?

Kyou:


Tomoya:
That's a very tasty sounding name!

Kyou:
Hm? What was that?

Tomoya:
Nothing.

Kyou:



Nagisa:
Practice the briefing session?

Tomoya:


Nagisa:
Do you think we'll find something here?

Yukine:


Tomoya:
So, how about a cup of coffee?

Nagisa:
Oh, I love coffee.

Yukine:

Nagisa:
Oh, thank you very much.

Tomoya:
It's good.

Yukine:


Nagisa:
Yes. How do you do?

Tomoya:
So, are you the one who's overseeing this room then?

Yukine:


Nagisa:
If I remember, this used to be the library room, wasn't it?

Yukine:


Tomoya:


Yukine:


Tomoya:
Oh, no, I was just thinking there are some really unique characters in this school.

Yukine:
Oh?

Tomoya:
No, in this town I'd say.


Tomoya:


Nagisa:


Tomoya:
Keep it up! What's next?

Nagisa:
Uh... let me tell you the reason I decided to revive the drama club is... is...

Tomoya:


Nagisa:


Tomoya:


Nagisa:
What sort of plays?

Tomoya:


Nagisa:
Are there that many?

Tomoya:
I'm leaving.

Nagisa:
Wait! No, don't go!

Tomoya:


Nagisa:
Well, it's... it's a very very amusing play.

Tomoya:


Nagisa:
No, it's actually a whole lot more than just a comedy.

Tomoya:
So, it's a comedy that's really touching?

Nagisa:
Well, it might bring you to tears, but it's really quite funny too.

Tomoya:
Will it make you laugh or cry? Which is it?

Nagisa:
Ah, it's about half and half.

Tomoya:


Nagisa:
All right, now please ask me the next question.

Tomoya:
Can you tell me what were those pictures on the poster?

Nagisa:
It's the Big Dango Family!

Tomoya:
A quick answer!

Nagisa:


Tomoya:


Nagisa:
I don't mean to be.

Tomoya:


Nagisa:


Tomoya:
The future looks bleak to me.

Nagisa:
Yeah, I kinda think so too.

Tomoya:


Nagisa:
Because I like it.

Tomoya:
What do you like about it?

Nagisa:


Tomoya:
I think that's fine.

Nagisa:
Huh?

Tomoya:


Nagisa:
Do you think so?

Tomoya:
I'm the type of guy who says exactly what he thinks.

Nagisa:


Tomoya:


Nagisa:
'Kay.

Tomoya:


Nagisa:
I will!

Nagisa:
I wonder if people will come to my briefing.

Tomoya:


Nagisa:
Yes, I'm positive.

Yukine:


Nagisa:


Yukine:


Tomoya:
Then that means, that all the other posters we put up...

PA Announcement:
