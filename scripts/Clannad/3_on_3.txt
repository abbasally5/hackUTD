  Mei:
I knew it would be bad, but I didn't think it would be this bad!

Nagisa:


Tomoya:
I think you'd better quit while you're ahead.

Mei:



-OP-


Tomoya:
Wow. Just like that, it's already clean!

Nagisa:


Mei:


Misae:
Be my guest, it's over here.

Mei:
Thanks, I appreciate it!

Tomoya:
She's on top of things.

Nagisa:


Tomoya:
What truth?

Nagisa:


Tomoya:
Huh?

Mei:


Nagisa:


Mei:
Oh, my heart...

Nagisa:


Tomoya:


Mei:

Tomoya:


Mei:
Huh?

Nagisa:
Yeah I know, I'd give anything to have a little sister like you, Mei.

Youhei:


Nagisa:
Oh no, that's not it at all!

Tomoya:


Youhei:
What?! Yahoo!

Mei:

Youhei:


Mei:


Youhei:
You called me?

Tomoya:
Ah, I guess I've got a lot of explaining to do, huh?


第16回 3 on 3


Youhei:
So, in short, you've been spreading lies and playing tricks on everyone here.

Tomoya:
One thing just led to another.

Nagisa:


Mei:


Youhei:
Are you kidding?!


Youhei:
Nagisa, are you sure about this?

Nagisa:
Yeah, I'm sure Mei is no trouble at all and I'd love to spend some more time with her.

Misae:


Mei:
Yeah!

Youhei:


Tomoya:
Huh?


Nagisa:
Hey guys, I'm home!

Tomoya:
I'm here too.

Sanae:


Mei:
Uh, excuse me, you're very pretty, ma'am.

Sanae:
It's sweet of you to say that.

Mei:
You must be Nagisa's older sister, right?

Sanae:
Actually, I'm her mom.

Mei:
I never have guessed!

Akio:


Nagisa:
Please, Father and Mother, I have an important favor to ask.

Akio:


Nagisa:


Akio:


Nagisa:


Sanae:
You sure know the right buttons to press with her, don't you?

Akio:
Should've had a son instead of a daughter.

Nagisa:


Sanae:


Nagisa:


Akio:


Mei:
You guys are really close, aren't you?

Tomoya:


Nagisa:


Mei:
I'm Mei Sunohara, it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

Sanae:
I'm Sanae, and of course we would be more than happy to have you, Mei.

Akio:


Mei:


Akio:


Tomoya:
You don't have that kind of money.

Mei:
Youhei's gonna play in a basketball game?

Nagisa:


Mei:


Sanae:
I don't have a problem with it, but what about school?

Mei:

Nagisa:


Tomoya:
Looks like I have no choice but to play now.


Tomoya:
Hm? Tomoyo!

Tomoyo:
Oh. Hi, Okazaki.

Tomoya:


Tomoyo:
If I'm going to be late, won't you be late too?

Tomoya:
Yeah, but I'm delinquent, so it's fine.

Tomoyo:


Tomoya:



Kyou:
Don't tell me another girl likes him now?!

Youhei:
What? My sister wants to come watch the game?

Tomoya:


Youhei:


Kyou:
Okay!

Youhei:
Whoa!

Kyou:

Youhei:


Tomoya:
Not too reassuring, is he?

Kyou:


Youhei:


Kyou:


Youhei:
And who made you the team captain, huh?

Tomoya:
Sunohara...

Youhei:


Tomoya:
I'll take a coffee with milk...

Youhei:
Is our friendship a hierarchy, too?

Tomoya, Kyou:
Isn't it obvious?

Youhei:


Kyou:


Tomoya:
Like what?

Kyou:



Youhei:
You're not going to the club room for lunch today?

Tomoya:
No, Kyou told me to wait in the classroom for some reason.

Youhei:
Ahh!

Tomoyo:
What? Did you think I was dead?

Tomoya:
We just weren't expecting you.

Tomoyo:


Youhei:
You little...

Tomoyo:


Youhei:
Who do you think you are, coming in here and messing up our lunch?!

Tomoyo:
But I didn't do anything to you.

Youhei:

Boy:
Look at them. Asking an underclassman to come eat lunch in our room, give me a break!

Girl:
I can't figure it out.
Which one do you think she's going out with?

Tomoyo:


Youhei:
Excuse me for being "someone like Sunohara."

Tomoyo:


Kyou:


Tomoyo:
I don't recall there being a rule that says you can't eat in other people's classroom during break.

Kyou:


Tomoyo:


Kyou:


Tomoyo:
So does that mean you're going out with someone right now or what?

Tomoya:
No way! Why are you asking me this?

Tomoyo:


Kyou:


Tomoya:
I didn't know meeting you at lunch meant you wanted to eat together!

Kyou:
Well, it did!

Tomoyo:


Youhei:
Wait a sec, are you doing this 'cause you're interested in Okazaki?

Tomoyo:



Tomoya:
Hey, what's going on here?

Kyou:


Ryou:
Um, if it's too much trouble, we don't wanna force you.

Tomoya:
No, that's fine. It's no trouble, really.

Ryou:
Oh, good. I was worried.

Kyou:
By the way, you said something interesting back in the classroom.

Tomoya:
Me? Sunohara and Tomoyo were the interesting ones.

Kyou:


Tomoya:
Come on, Kyou, what are you getting at here?

Kyou:
Oh, nothing. You'll just have to wait and see!

Tomoya:
Hm?

Ryou:
Ah!


Youhei:
Did Mei really say she was gonna come watch the basketball game?

Tomoya:


Youhei:

She probably couldn't care less about her big brother.

Tomoya:
What, are you sulking 'cause she's ignoring you?

Youhei:


Tomoya:
I wouldn't really call this the city.

Youhei:



Tomoya:


Mei:
Hi there!

Tomoya:
Speak of the devil.

Youhei:


Mei:


Tomoya:
Who me?

Mei:


Youhei:
Oh yeah, what's up?

Mei:


Youhei:
Argh! This is too much! Too much!


Kyou:
Right!
Now we're gonna win this game, got it?!

Tomoya:
You're fired up all of a sudden.

Youhei:
Did something happen?

Ryou:
Someone from the basketball team said something rude to her.
So I think she's looking for revenge now.

Kyou:
Yup! He said I was degrading myself by teaming up with a bunch of low-lives, or something like that.
God, that pisses me off!
Tomoya, is it a foul to slam the ball into someone's face?

Tomoya:
Oh, ah yeah, I'm afraid so...

Kyou:
Tsk!

Kotomi:
Kyou's really intense today, isn't she?

Tomoya:
We'll never hear the end of this if we lose.

Youhei:
I'm starting to think we picked the wrong person after all.

Nagisa:
Um...

Tomoya:
Hm?

Nagisa:
Just make sure you don't get hurt out there, okay?

Tomoya:
Don't worry about it. I'll be fine.

Boy:
I don't get it.
Why's the basketball team playing the drama club?

Boy:
Who knows? But it might be fun to watch.

Girl:
I don't get it.
Why do we have to watch a basketball game, Rie?

Girl:
I don't care what Sunohara told you. Even if they win, it still has nothing to do with us.

Rie:
I suppose it doesn't.
But Sunohara insisted we come no matter what.

Youhei:
What grade are you in?

Captain:
They're all freshmen, of course.

Youhei:
What? You mean we're playing a bunch of rookies?

Captain:
What did you expect?
It wouldn't much of a game if you play our A-team.

Youhei:
We'll see how long that confidence of yours holds up.

Captain:
The game will be played 3-on-3 for twenty minutes.
There will be no timeouts.
All other basketball rules apply.
Got it?

Tomoya:
Ohgami's your advisor, right?
If he finds out about this, there's gonna be hell to pay.

Captain:
It's worth the risk to see you play again.

Mei:
Um, Nagisa?

Nagisa:
What's up? Is something wrong?

Mei:
Are you sure it's okay for me to be at your school?

Nagisa:
I'm sure it's fine.
And even if it's not, I doubt anyone will notice since they'll all be focusing on the basketball game.

Ryou:
Sorry, I don't think I caught your name.

Mei:
I'm Youhei Sunohara's younger sister, Mei.
Thanks for being friends with my bro.

Ryou:
Oh, uh sure. It's nothing really.

Kotomi:
My name's Kotomi.
It's nice to meet you.

Nagisa:
Hey guys, we might wanna watch. It looks like the game's starting now.

Mei, Ryou, Kotomi:
Oh...


Boy:
Damn, he's fast!

Tomoya:
Sunohara!

Youhei:
Kyou!

Kyou:
All right!

Tomoya:
Nice shot!

Youhei:
She gets lots of practice from throwing all those dictionaries at me every day.

Captain:
Come on, flip the scoreboard already!

Boy:
Oh, right!

Ryou:
Wait, that was worth three points?

Kotomi:
Normally a shot is only worth two points. But if a player makes it from more than twenty feet away, it's worth three points.

Nagisa:
I guess I don't know much about basketball.

Boy:
That... that was luck.
Damn it, I can't shake her off!

Boy:
Come on!

Tomoya:
Sunohara!

Youhei:
Kyou!

Kyou, Youhei, Tomoya:
All right!

Youhei:
Nice shot, Kyou!

Boy:
In that case...
We'll just have to keep her covered!

Tomoya:
You think I wasn't expecting that?

Youhei:
Sunohara, here!

Boy:
Come on, shoot. I dare you!

Youhei:
Hmpf!

Boy:
Huh?

Youhei:
All right!

Tomoya:
Nice, Sunohara!

Captain:
Come on, wake up!
You guys can't hold back against them!
Show 'em what you're made of!

Boys:
Uh... right!

Tomoya:
At this rate, he'll probably bring in the regular members soon.
If we wanna win this, we'll have to get a big lead before then.

Youhei:
Ah!

Girls:
Wow!

Kyou:
Ah!

Mei:
Yay!

Boy:
There!

Girls:
Oh...

Tomoya:
Stay cool!

Youhei, Kyou:
Right!

Girl:
They're really great!
I can't believe it!

Youhei:
Come on, let's go!
Kyou, !

Rie:
And they are playing the basketball team, too.

Tomoya:
Kyou!

Kyou:
Thanks, Tomoya!

Tomoya:
Okay, now!

Youhei:
Kyou, shoot!

Kyou:
Ah!
Yes!

Girls:
Kyou! We love you!

Tomoya:
Who are they?

Kyou:
Don't ask me why, but for some reason, I'm really popular with the underclassmen girls.

Captain:
Okazaki still can't raise his right arm much higher than his shoulder.
He can still make lay-ups from the left side of the court.
If we keep an eye out for that, he shouldn't be a real problem.
Just make sure to keep the pressure on Sunohara and Fujibayashi so they don't have any room to take a good shot at the basket.

Kyou:
All right!

Captain:
Changing players.
All freshmen, off the court.

Boy:
I'm sorry.

Captain:
Don't worry about it. Just leave it us.

Tomoya:
Looks like they're breaking out the big guns now.

Youhei:
Good! That's what I was waiting for.

Tomoya:
You gonna make it?
You don't look so good.

Youhei:
What? Are you kidding?
I'm just now getting warmed up!

Nagisa:
Five more minutes.

Tomoya:
Up by eleven points...

Tomoya:
Ah, damn it!

Youhei:
Stop right there!
Ah!

Kyou:
Ah!

Captain:
Take it!

Kyou:
Argh, come on!

Boy:
They're catching up fast!
Boy:
Guess they can't stand up to the real players.

Mei:
How much time do they have left?

Nagisa:
About one minute and twenty seconds to go.

Kotomi:
They're about to catch up!

Mei:
It's a one point difference!

Ryou:
Sunohara's out of breath!

Kotomi:
They've taken the lead!

Nagisa:
Only twenty seconds left!

Mei:
Come on guys, you can do it!

Tomoya:
I can't keep this up!
I'm running on empty.
Come to think of it, why am I trying so hard, anyway?

Tomoya:
Nice pass!
Here goes nothing.

Captain:
Not so fast!

Tomoya:
Who am I kidding?
We can't win this.
These guys practice every day.
And what about me?
I spent the last two years wasting my life away.
I knew how this was gonna end.
This is stupid.
I shouldn't have agreed to this.
It just makes me feel miserable.
So miserable...

Nagisa:
Okazaki, shoot the ball!

Tomoya:
But still...
Now there's a place that even someone like me wants to fight for.

Girls:
Wow!

Girl:
That was really amazing!

Rei:
Th-They did it.

Girl:
I can't believe they really won.

Ohgami:
Hey!
What the hell's going on in here?!

Youhei:
It's Ohgami!

Tomoya:
Run for it!

Captain:
Hey!

Tomoya:
Huh?

Captain:
You had that look in your eye.
Maybe you can still play after all.

Tomoya:
You kidding me?


Mei:
Thanks for taking care of me.
I had a great time!

Tomoya:
We wish you could've stayed longer.
I hate to see you go.

Nagisa:
Mom and Dad said you're welcome anytime, so please come visit us again, okay?

Youhei:
Your big brother was pretty cool out there today, huh?

Mei:
Well...
You were kind of running out of steam at the end there.
But yeah, you were pretty cool.

Youhei:
Oh, yeah.

Mei:
I'm sorry I have to leave so quickly this time, but I hope I can come back for a longer visit some time soon.
See you later!

Youhei:
Be careful going home!

Mei:
'Kay!

Youhei:
There she goes.
Time sure flies, huh?

Nagisa:
It's all right.
You'll see her again soon.
She said she wanted to come back, didn't she?

Youhei:
I wonder if the Choir Club will really hand over Mr. Koumura after all.

Tomoya:
Well, whatever happens, happens.

Nagisa:
So, ready to go?
Kyou and the others planned a party in celebration of your win over the basketball team.

Youhei:
Really? Where?

Tomoya:
In your room.

Youhei:
Why is it in my room?!

Nagisa:
You mean, nobody told you about it?

Youhei:
Nobody said a thing!
