--- OP ---


Tomoya:
Hey, Nagisa. Is the script coming along all right?

Nagisa:
Yeah, it's fine!
I don't remember the whole story, but I've been piecing it together bit by bit.
If I don't hit any snags, I should be done tomorrow.

Kyou:
Ryou and Kotomi will do sound.
Youhei and I will handle the lighting.
Tomoya will act as producer and stage director, okay?

Nagisa:
Great!
And that leaves me to act everything out!

Ryou:
We're starting to look more and more like a real Drama Club.

Kotomi:
You're right.
But there are still a lot of things left to decide on, like costumes and music.

Ryou:
How are we going to put the costumes together?

Youhei:
Well, are any of you good at sewing?

Kyou:
I guess I might be able to do it if I tried.

Ryou:
I've never even picked up a needle before.

Tomoya:
In that case...


第21回 学園祭にむけて (Preparing for the School Festival)


Sanae:
No problem. Leave it to me.

Tomoya:
See? Aren't you glad we asked her after all?

Nagisa:
I guess, but aren't you busy, Mom?

Sanae:
I'll be fine!
I'll just work on it a little bit at a time in between chores.

Nagisa:
I don't know, I still feel bad for asking her.

Tomoya:
But we don't have a choice.
There isn't anyone else who can do it.

Nagisa:
I just don't wanna trouble her.

Akio:
So, you've returned!
My lovely daughter who has inherited my superb genes, and Mr. Nobody from nowhere.

Tomoya:
Why am I Mr. Nobody?

Nagisa:
Hi, Dad!

Akio:
Oh, I rented a video you guys might like.
There!

Nagisa:
Huh?

Actor:
Hold on, what is this place?
Where are we?

Actor:
Worry not!
All is well, my friend.
Look! Is this view not beautiful?

Actor:
Incredible!

Actress:
It is a perfect world created only for you.

Tomoya:
A video of a play, huh?
Yeah, I guess that would be helpful, wouldn't it?

Nagisa:
Yeah, it's a good reference since I've never actually seen a play before.

Akio:
Argh!

Tomoya:
What?! You've never seen a play before?!

Nagisa:
No, not a single one.
In fact, I was sick the day of my elementary school play, so I didn't even get to see that!

Tomoya:
And our leader drops another bombshell on us. Wow...

Tomoya:
Hey, you can't do research crying like that.

Nagisa:
I know, but I can't help it.
It was really touching.
I never realized how amazing theater could be.
But compared to something wonderful like this, what we're doing is just child's play.

Tomoya:
Even if it is, who cares?
As long as you give it your best, I'm sure you'll be able to touch the hearts of the audience.

Nagisa:
I guess you're right.
I just have to give it my best.

Akio:
What do we have here?
Still getting cozy with Nagisa at this hour?

Tomoya:
We were watching that video you got her, that's all.

Akio:
Huh.
Perfect timing. Come with me, kid.

Tomoya:
Huh?

Akio:
You're still looking for something, aren't you?
Operation Training Potty will now enter phase one.

Tomoya:
I told you it's not a training potty!

Akio:
I can't find it.
You sure this picture book or fairy tale whatever is really in our house?

Tomoya:
Mm, it may be a play after all.

Akio:
Huh?

Tomoya:
Maybe Nagisa actually did see a play in the past.
She just forgot about it, and that's why she doesn't remember the story.

Akio:
Nope, not a chance.
If she saw a play like that when she was younger, I'm sure I would have remembered it.
But if I don't remember it, then it didn't happen.
I can't say where she heard the story, but I can say it's not a play.

Tomoya:
I see...

Akio:
Oh...?

Tomoya:
Huh, did you find it?!

Akio:
No, this is something else.

Hey!

Tomoya:
Now did you find it?!

Akio:
It's Nagisa's old training potty!

Tomoya:
Why are you so obsessed with that thing?

Akio:
Hey, shut up!
You were the one looking for it, not me, dumb-ass!

Sanae:
Keep it down, you two!
You're going to bother the neighbors.

Akio:
You got us into trouble.
You happy now?

Tomoya:
Why is it my fault?


Nagisa:
I got a great idea for the play when I was watching that video last night.

Tomoya:
What is it?

Nagisa:
A song!
If we add a powerful song at the climax of the play, I'm sure it'll liven things up!

Tomoya:
Are you good at singing?
I never knew.

Nagisa:
Actually, I've only sung during music class.
But I really really think it would make the play better if we added a song!
Do you think it's a bad idea?

Tomoya:
It's not that it's a bad idea.
I just think you shouldn't overexert yourself trying to make everything perfect.
You're doing enough already.

Nagisa:
You really think so?

Tomoya:
Yeah, it's not commercial theater or anything, right?
Just do what you want.
It'll work out fine.
You're the one making it.
So it's your play and your stage.

Nagisa:
My play and my stage.
You're right!
If I wanna sing a song on stage, then that's what I wanna do!

Tomoya:
I say as long as you're doing what you want, then you're doing the right thing.

Nagisa:
Right!


Kyou:
"This is a world that has come to an end."
"An empty and still world where no one exists but I."
"There's a small table and chair in this room."
"But outside the window, there is nothing but an empty plain; stretching into an endless horizon."
Hmm. It's interesting. I like it.

Nagisa:
Yeah, that's why I've been trying to remember the rest.

Kotomi:
We tried to do research on the story as well.
But we couldn't come up with the name no matter where we looked.

Ryou:
But as it's written, it isn't finished yet, right?

Nagisa:
Right.

Tomoya:
What do you think?
Can you come up with any songs that would be good as background music?

Sugisaka:
What's the verdict, Rie?

Rie:
I think I'm starting to get it now.
All you have to do is put yourself in the girl's shoes.

Nagisa:
Put yourself in her shoes?

Rie:
It's not like being alone at home or school -- you're really completely alone in the world.
It's a very oppressive sadness.
Don't you think?

Nagisa:
Yes, it's very lonely and sad.

Rie:
Then I think music with a sort of melancholy tone would work well.

Kyou:
Hm? Oh, wow!

Kotomi:
Are all of these CDs yours, Nishina?

Sugisaka:
Well, Rie is a music lover after all.

Rie:
How about we try this one?

It's a piece called "Ma Mere L'Oye" by Ravel.

Kyou:
"Ma Mere..." what now?

Rie:
"Ma Mere L'Oye."
It's French for Mother Goose.
Since Nagisa's play takes place in a sort of fairy tale fantasy setting,
I thought this might be a good match.
Ravel composed a number of fantasy theme pieces like this.
This one in particular was based on several nursery rhymes and fairy tales.

Nagisa:
It's beautiful!
It's amazing how well it fits the play!

Rie:
Great! I'm glad you thought so too.

Tomoyo:
Sure is lively in here.

Nagisa:
Sakagami! Nice to see you.

Tomoya:
Wait, why are you wearing glasses?
It's weird.

Tomoyo:
Because my vision's bad, why do you think?

Youhei:
Then why haven't I seen you wear them before?

Tomoyo:
I try to avoid wearing them because I don't like the way they look on me.

Ryou:
If you don't like glasses, then why don't you try contacts?

Tomoyo:
I'm scared of those.

Kyou:
Ugh...

Kotomi:
I can relate. They are scary, aren't they?

Tomoyo:
Enough about the glasses already.
How's the club doing?

Tomoya:
As you can see, things are moving along quite nicely.

Nagisa:
But we still have a lot to do.
The real work starts now.

Tomoyo:
As they say, the road goes on and on.
Let's both give it our best!
Make it a promise.

Nagisa:
Sure!

Tomoyo:
I thought so. You're a good girl, aren't you?
I'm so glad it was you.

Youhei:
She's pretty cool for a junior, I guess.

Nagisa:
Now that we picked out a song, I'm gonna try acting with the music, okay?
Why don't you tell me what you think?

Tomoya:
At one time, this room was empty.
But now all of these people have gathered here and filled it up with life.
We all spend time together.
We all work together.
We all believe in Nagisa's dream.
We share her sorrows and we share her joy.
You're really amazing, Nagisa!


C L A N N A D
－クラナド－


Nagisa:
All right, we're off to school.

Tomoya:
See you guys later.

Sanae:
Tomorrow's finally the School Festival, isn't it?

Akio:
Give it all you got at today's rehearsal, okay?

Nagisa:
Yeah, all I've got and more!

Tomoya:
No reason to get so stressed out.
Today's just the rehearsal, remember?
The real show isn't until tomorrow.
Besides, you've been practicing so much that I bet your body will just start moving on its own when you're on the stage.

Nagisa:
You're probably right.

Tomoya:
You sure are cute, you know.

Nagisa:
I'm sorry but can we wait till later to talk?

Tomoya:
Whoa, hey!
Man, she's really in her own world.


Guy:
Watch it, that row's getting crooked!

Girl:
Bring some sheets over here too!

Kotomi:
This is a lot more complicated than I thought it would be.

Ryou:
Yeah, I know.

Youhei:
My arms are getting tired.

Kyou:
Stay right there, okay, Nagisa?
If you move around too much, we won't know your mark.

Tomoya:
Just a little bit higher! Good!
The lights should hit the center of the stage.
Okay now, try turning them on.

Nagisa:
Ah... Now I'm starting to get nervous!

Guy:
Now hold on just a minute. This is something my son asked me to get for him.
I'm sorry, but I can't just hand it over like that.
You can't find something like this anywhere, you know.

Ryou:
It gets pretty dark back here, doesn't it?

Tomoya:
Yeah, I'll have to remember to bring a flashlight tomorrow.

Nagisa:
Oh, my heart's gonna beat out of my chest!

Kyou:
Relax, relax. Just don't think of the audience as people and you won't be so nervous anymore.

Nagisa:
Then what should I think of them as?

Kotomi:
Well, you know, if they're not people, then they must be invaders from outer space.

Tomoya:
What kind of messed up logic is that?

Youhei:
At any rate, since the aliens are here to invade the Earth, they don't have any interest in what Nagisa's doing.

Nagisa:
I don't want them to be totally uninterested.
I want them to watch a little!

Youhei:
Okay, then in that case, your acting will determine the fate of Earth at the hand of the invaders.
If you perform well, they'll leave us in peace.
But if you perform poorly, the human race will be wiped out.

Nagisa:
No, that's way too much pressure!

Tomoya:
Hey, come on.
She's seriously stressed out here, so don't say anything that's gonna make her feel worse.

Nagisa:
But for some reason, I'm starting to calm down.

Tomoya:
What, seriously?

Nagisa:
Mm-hm.

Tomoyo:
All right, next up is the Drama Club.
Is everyone ready?

Nagisa:
Uh, yeah. We're ready to go!

Tomoyo:
Great! Give it your best!

Nagisa:
I think I'm starting to get nervous again.

Kyou:
You kidding?
You said you were calming down a second ago.

Nagisa:
I know, I know. But everyone worked so hard to make this happen.
You're going out of your way to help me, so I don't wanna let you down.

Tomoya:
We're not just doing this for you.
All of us care about the play too.
We're just trying to liven up the Festival, right?

Nagisa:
I guess so...

Tomoya:
Everyone has a part in the School Festival.
You don't have to feel the pressure all by yourself.

Nagisa:
Yeah, I guess I never thought of it that way.

Tomoyo:
Drama Club! If you're ready, go ahead and start.

Nagisa:
O-Okay!

Youhei:
We can do this, guys!

Kyou:
Hey, I saw this thing on TV where everyone puts their hands together and does a big cheer.
You wanna try it?

Ryou:
Oh yeah, I've seen that too.
It looked like fun.

Kotomi:
I'd like to give it a try too.

Tomoya:
Okay, everyone. Hands in!

Youhei:
He he. I used to do this stuff like this on the soccer team all the time.

Tomoya:
Let's go, Drama Club!

Everyone:
Yeah!

Tomoya:
All right. Go for it, Nagisa!

Nagisa:
Okay!

Ryou:
Everyone, take your positions!

Kotomi:
Right.

Kyou:
Let's go, Youhei.

Youhei:
Now I'm starting to get nervous too!

Nagisa:
Thank you so much, everyone.
I'll do my best.


Nagisa:
I'm home!

Tomoya:
How's it going?

Sanae:
Welcome back!

Akio:
Ah, good to see you!
You're the fruit of our love after all.
By the way, I'm not talking about you.

Tomoya:
Yeah, I kinda figured.

Sanae:
So, Nagisa, how did the dress rehearsal go?

Nagisa:
Well, uh, what did you think?

Tomoya:
Just like every other practice.
It went without a hitch.

Sanae:
I'm glad everything worked out!

Akio:
I'd expect no less of our daughter.
By tomorrow, every talent agency in Japan will be callin' her!

Tomoya:
I don't know. I wouldn't go that far.

Akio:
Come on, kid.
Just smile and agree with me, damn it!

Nagisa:
Dad, Okazaki doesn't like to flatter people.

Akio:
Yeah, I know. That's why you can count on him, right?

Sanae:
Nagisa, you'll give your mother an autograph, won't you?

Tomoya:
Talk about doting parents.

Akio:
Just wait. One day when you have a daughter, you'll be the same way we are.

Tomoya:
Yeah, right. Are you kidding me?

Nagisa:
Oh, I don't know, I think he's right, Okazaki.
You guys are a lot alike.

Akio:
Huh? No way! Me and him?

Akio:
My own daughter...

Nagisa:
Yes, sir.

Akio:
What a shock!
What a betrayal!

Tomoya:
Come on, you're like two inches from my face!


Tomoya:
Come in!

Nagisa:
Are you about to go to sleep, Okazaki?

Tomoya:
No, not yet at least.

Nagisa:
Then, do you mind if I come in?

Tomoya:
No.

Nagisa:
Can I sit next to you?

Tomoya:
Yeah.
Is something bothering you?

Nagisa:
Uh, no. Or well, nothing in particular at least.

Tomoya:
Are you too nervous to sleep?

Nagisa:
Is it that obvious?

Tomoya:
With you, I'd be a lot more surprised if you COULD sleep, actually.

Nagisa:
I'm a nervous wreck. I'm trying not to worry, but I can't help it.

Tomoya:
It's your first performance.
I don't blame you.
But if you get all the nervous out tonight, you'll be fine tomorrow.

Nagisa:
That's a good idea.
I'll try to be as nervous as I can right now.

Tomoya:
By the way, your mom and dad are coming to watch the play tomorrow too, aren't they?

Nagisa:
Yeah,

Tomoya:
Is something wrong?

Nagisa:
No. Actually, I'm more grateful than anything.
I realized today just how much my mom and dad really care for me, that's all.

Tomoya:
I know what you mean.
It's hard to find parents like them.

Nagisa:
But it makes me feel kinda guilty too.
I still wish I knew what happened when I was young.

Tomoya:
Oh, that.
You mean how you think you did something bad to your parents when you were a kid?

Nagisa:
Yeah.

Akio:
'Cause knowing her, she'll think it was her fault.
She'll think she's the reason why Sanae and I had to give up our dreams.

Nagisa:
Okazaki, did I say something weird?

Tomoya:
Oh, no.
Listen, Nagisa.

Nagisa:
Yes?

Tomoya:
Sometimes you can be way too sensitive about that kind of stuff.
You have this bad habit of blaming everything on yourself.
So, don't get caught up on this.
You're probably just imagining things.
Right now, the only thing you need to focus on is the play.
You can worry about the other stuff later.

Nagisa:
I guess... you're right.
I'll take your advice.
I'm sure it's nothing.
Good-night, Okazaki.

Tomoya:
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

Nagisa:
Okazaki, um...
Thank you for listening to me.
I should be able to sleep now, I think.

Tomoya:
Check to make sure you have everything you need for the play.

Nagisa:
Okay!


Nagisa:
My costume, my towel...
Oh, that's right. I need a flashlight for backstage.

Nagisa:
Oops.


Tomoya:
Nagisa?

Nagisa:
Okazaki, it's you...

Tomoya:
Those pictures...

Nagisa:
I found a bunch of old photo albums and diaries.
I can't believe it. I had no idea at all, Okazaki!
Dad used to be an actor when he was younger.
He gave it up because of me, didn't he?
They both gave up their dreams for me.

Tomoya:
Nagisa, forget about this, all right?
Just try to get some rest for now!
I'll clean things up here.
You just try to get as much sleep as you can, okay?

Sanae:
After picking Nagisa up from kindergarten, we took a walk down to the river together.
I'm so happy I get to spend time with her every day.
Although I miss teaching sometimes, if I hadn't quit, I never would have experienced so much happiness.

Akio:
I messed up, huh?
This is the worst time for this to happen.
Damn it all.
