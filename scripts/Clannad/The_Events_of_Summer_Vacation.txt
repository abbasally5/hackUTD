  Tomoya:
Nice weather, huh?

Nagisa:
Yeah.

Tomoya:
Seems like a waste to go to class.
Why don't we skip and go to the beach?

Nagisa:
Give it up already, Okazaki!
You say that every day.

Tomoya:
Of course! 'Cause these supplementary classes are a waste of time.
If I'm not going to college, then there's no point.

Nagisa:
It doesn't matter.
You made a commitment, so you have to honor it.
Besides, it still goes on your school record.

Tomoya:
You sure like to worry about me, don't you?

Nagisa:
Well, what do you expect?
I mean, because you're... um... you're very special to me, Okazaki.

Tomoya:
Uh... eh...
Hey, Nagisa!

Nagisa:
Ah...uh-huh?! Yeah?

Tomoya:
You... um... wanna hold hands?

Nagisa:
Huh?

Tomoya:
Just try it!

Nagisa:
I-I don't know.
I mean, we're in public. What if someone sees us?

Tomoya:
There's nobody around. Don't worry about it.
Besides, we're going out, aren't we?
What's wrong with holding hands once in a while?

Nagisa:
I-I guess you have a point.
No harm in trying.

Kyou:
Good morning! Coming through!
Lovey-dovey first thing in the morning?
Wait! Don't tell me, you were about to kiss before I interrupted!

Tomoya:
Come on, don't be stupid!
Of course not!

Nagisa:
Yeah, what he said! We haven't started kissing yet, we were just trying to hold han...

Tomoya:
Hey, shut up!

Kyou:
He he.

- OP -

Tomoya:
The school festival is over, we're finished with exams, and summer vacation is finally here.
Still, not much has changed and I'm still freeloading at Nagisa's house.

Teacher:
Thus, the price of rice rose steadily and in Toyama Prefecture...

Tomoya:
Even though it's summer vacation, seniors like me still have supplementary classes.
But I'm toughing it out for Nagisa's sake at least.

Teacher:
...are there any other questions before I move on?


番外編 夏休みの出来事 (It happened During Summer Vacation)


Kyou:
Every day, nothing but study, study, study!
I'm so sick of all this.
It's the last summer vacation of our lives, and we're stuck indoors reading books all day.

Kotomi:
You might think it's boring, but I'm actually happy to be studying with everyone for once.

Ryou:
And on the bright side, we still get to eat lunch together everyday, right?

Kyou:
That reminds me. What the heck are you doing lurking around here?

Tomoyo:
As Student Council President, I'm required to come to school.

Kyou:
I know that!
I'm asking why you're hanging out with us everyday when you're not even in the Drama Club?

Tomoyo:
Where's Okazaki? I haven't seen him.

Nagisa:
Oh!
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
Okazaki said he was going over to Sunohara's.

Tomoyo:
Ugh...

Nagisa:
Ah, is something wrong?

Tomoyo:
I just noticed that you still call him Okazaki.

Nagisa:
Yes, is something wrong with that?

Kotomi:
I wouldn't say it's wrong.
But since Tomoya calls you Nagisa, it does seem a bit odd.

Tomoyo:
If you two are going out, then shouldn't you be on a first name basis?

Nagisa:
Oh. Now that you mention it, I seem to remember someone telling me the same thing before.

Kyou:
So, let's hear it. How far have you two gone, anyway?

Nagisa:
Huh?
Well, actually...


Youhei:
What? You haven't even held hands yet?!
What are you, in grade school?!
Next you're gonna tell me you're afraid she's gonna give you cooties!

Tomoya:
Shut up!
When the moment comes, it can be really nerve-wracking.

Youhei:
Aww. I can't believe Nagisa's wasting her time with someone who won't even hold her hand.
She should get with me, so I can teach her the true meaning of love!

Misae:
Sunohara, you have a visitor.

Youhei:
Huh? Me?

Misae:
Yeah and she's really cute too.
She can't wait to see you!

Youhei:
What? For real?!
Yeeahoow!
Sorry to keep you waitin', baby!

Mei:
Youhei, hi!

Tomoya:
Mei, it's you.

Mei:
It's been a while, huh, Okazaki? Nice to see you.

Mei:
I called and told you I was coming over today, didn't I?
Why are you surprised?

Youhei:
Sorry, I forgot.

Mei:
Oh, you're hopeless, Youhei. Give me a break.

Tomoya:
When we're finished cleaning up in here, why don't we go say hi to Nagisa's mom and dad?

Mei:
Okay!


Everyone:
Thanks for the food!

Sanae:
You're always so polite and well-mannered, Mei.
It's a pleasure to have you.

Tomoya:
When you put it that way, it's hard to believe she's Sunohara's sister.

Nagisa:
You shouldn't say things like that.
I think Sunohara is a very nice person.

Akio:
Mei, if you're looking for a place to stay, I hope you know you're welcome here.

Mei:
Oh, really? You don't mind?

Akio:
Of course not! It's our pleasure!

Tomoya:
This family sure loves company, don't they?

Akio:
We should all take a bath after this!

Sanae:
Oh, count me in too!

Akio:
Hmm. Seem to be enjoying themselves.
If I asked, do you think they'll let me join in maybe?


Mei:
Oh, good morning, Okazaki!
Now everyone's up.

Nagisa:
Morning, Okazaki.

Tomoya:
Morning, you two.
Didn't get much sleep?

Mei:
Not really.
Since we were up all night talking in bed, you were the big topic of discussion by the way.

Tomoya:
Am I that interesting?

Mei:
Hey, Nagisa. Why don't you go back to sleep for a little while?

Nagisa:
Nah, I'll be fine once I get going.
Besides, my classes are over, so I'm off from school.

Tomoya:
So, you're on vacation and you spend it working?

Nagisa:
You don't have to put it that way.
I just wanted to let Mom and Dad take some time off for a change.

Mei:
I don't think of it as work. I'm happy to help!

Nagisa:
I know this probably isn't your idea of a vacation, but maybe we can do something tomorrow instead?

Tomoya:
Ugh.. ah!

Akio:
Just think of this as a way to pay your rent.

Tomoya:
Yeah, and what are you gonna do?

Akio:
My lovely daughter was kind enough to give me this time off.
So, I'm gonna play!
So long.

Mei:
Isn't it wonderful that he's still a child at heart after all these years?

Sanae:
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I was busy baking this.

Mei:
Ah!
Wow! That must be your special recipe, huh?!

Sanae:
Yes. If you'd like to try some, help yourself!

Mei:
Yay!

Sanae:
How do you like it?

Mei:
It's cute!
I really like the rainbow colors.

Sanae:
I'm happy to hear it.
Still I wonder if we'll be able to sell them all?

Mei:
Oh, I'm sure you will!

Tomoya:
Cute, she says. Very clever.

Nagisa:
I'll have to use that next time.

Sanae:
Sorry to leave so soon, but I have a neighborhood board meeting to attend.
The shop's in your hands, so good luck!

Nagisa:
See you later, Mom!


Announcement:
Please listen to the following announcement.
Today we are collecting electronic recyclables from all houses in this neighborhood.
If you have any such items that you are not using, such as television sets, refrigerators, computers, motorcycles or...

Tomoya:
Sure is slow...

Mei:
You guys had a lot of more customers the last time I came to visit.

Nagisa:
A lot of students come here for lunch during the school year, but things slow down on the summer break.

Woman:
Ah, hello!

Mei:
Hi! Welcome to the store!
Here, take one.

Tomoya:
Damn, she's fast!

Woman:
Thank you.
Oh, look at that! Such cute girls are watching the shop today!

Mei:
I know! Nagisa's adorable, isn't she?

Nagisa:
Actually, I think she's talking about you.

Woman:
Oh, no. I think both of you are cute.

Nagisa:
Oh, thank you. That's nice of you to say.

Mei, Nagisa, Tomoya:
Thank you, please come again!

Mei:
You weren't helpful at all, Okazaki.
You need to step up your game plan.

Tomoya:
It would've been overkill with all three of us.
Any way you look at it, I'm the third wheel.

Nagisa:
That's not true at all! Don't say that!
Even if you're not much help, I'm still happy to be working with you.

Mei:
Don't worry, Okazaki.
You just take care of the register while I go outside and find some new customers.

Tomoya:
Find customers?
Wait, Mei!

Mei:
Welcome to the store!

Tomoya:
Welcome to the store!

Woman:
Oh, my! That's odd--Akio and Sanae aren't here today?

Nagisa:
No, we're watching over the shop for today.

Guy:
Wait a sec, this place is a bake shop?

Nagisa:
That's right! Come on in!

Guy:
I see.
That's not quite what I expected, I guess.
I knew it was some kind of shop, but I wasn't thinking bakery.

Woman:
Their bread is really good.
You should try some.

Guy:
Okay. Since I'm here, I guess I might as well buy something.

Tomoya, Nagisa:
Welcome to the store!

Guy:
Wait a sec, this place is a bake shop?

Guy:
See, didn't I tell you?

Guy:
But, hey! Look, the girl inside really is cute!

Nagisa:
Wait, what's going on here?

Tomoya:
Watch the register!
There she is! Mei!

Mei:
Yes?

Tomoya:
Hey, what the heck are you telling these people?

Mei:
A cute girl works here!

Tomoya:
Yeah, but people aren't coming there for the bread!

Mei:
But as long as they come, it doesn't matter, right?
Hee hee hee!

Nagisa:
Okazaki, it's getting busy!
Can you come and help me?

Tomoya:
B-Be right there!

Mei:
Oh, there's a cute girl in there.
Don't you wanna go check it out?


Akio:
Holy crap.
We haven't sold this much since our grand opening, and that was years ago!

Tomoya:
Then try working for a change.

Mei:
Some of the customers even came back two or three times.

Tomoya:
In case you were wondering, Sanae's bread sold out too.

Akio:
That's the biggest surprise of all.

Sanae:
Akio dear, when you put it like that, you make it sound like my bread never sells.

Akio:
Sanae, I love you!

Sanae:
Although I don't know what that has to do with selling bread, I love you too, Akio.

Mei:
Isn't there something you wanna say, Okazaki?

Tomoya:
Like what?

Mei:
Nagisa, I love you!

Tomoya:
Ugh!

Nagisa:
Huh?

Tomoya:
I-I can't say that out loud! Geez.

Nagisa:
I..I'm gonna start cooking dinner, okay?

Tomoya:
I'm gonna sweep the front of the store.

Mei:
Hmm...


C L A N N A D
－クラナド－


Youhei:
Go figure.
Today, she's having fun with Nagisa again?
What's that girl thinking? Ignoring her brother like this.

Tomoya:
Quit sulking. It's getting on my nerves.
I'm sure she'll stop by eventually.

Youhei:
I wonder about that...

Mei:
Hello!

Tomoya:
See that? There she is now.

Youhei:
Well, if she insists, I guess I'll humor her.

Tomoya:
Sure is predictable, isn't he?

Mei:
I had a feeling I could find you here.

Tomoya:
You came to see me?

Mei:
Uh-huh.
Ah, Youhei,
I need to talk to Okazaki in private for a sec.
Do you think you could wait outside?
Come on! Hurry up! You're in the way!

Youhei:
Ahhh!

Mei:
What's he crying about?
Well, whatever. I know this is kind of sudden.
But I think it's time for me to step in and play cupid.

Tomoya:
Play cupid?

Mei:
Yup!

Tomoya:
I see, so you were worried after all, huh?
I'm glad to hear it.

Mei:
Yeah, of course I worry.

Tomoya:
But there's no one really special at the moment.

Mei:
What are you talking about?
She's right in front of you.

Tomoya:
What? Sunohara and Mei?!
But... that's incest!

Mei:
Hey, Youhei...?

Youhei:
Yeah, what is it, Mei?

Mei:
Ever since you moved away, I had these thoughts about you that I can't get out of my head.

Youhei:
Huh? What kind of thoughts?

Mei:
Thoughts I've never had before.
Ones that didn't cross my mind when we were together.

Youhei:
You mean you have a little more respect for me now?

Mei:
No, it's not that.
It's something... more naughty.

Youhei:
Mei?
You naughty girl...

Mei:
Oh, Youhei! Hold me...

Tomoya:
Oh! Man, that's getting me worked up!

Mei:
Will you get your mind out of the gutter for a second?

Tomoya:
Come on, it's you and Sunohara.
What do you expect?

Mei:
Please don't involve me in your perverse incest fantasies.
Besides, I said I'm playing cupid, not that I'm in love with someone!

Tomoya:
Hold on a second!
You mean you're talking about me?

Mei:
Yes!

Tomoya:
Hey, Sunohara...?

Youhei:
What is it, Okazaki?

Tomoya:
Lately, I've had these thoughts about you that I just can't get out of my head.

Youhei:
Huh? What kind of thoughts?

Tomoya:
Thoughts I've never had before.
Ones that I don't think about other guys.

Youhei:
Are you saying you're proud to call me your friend now?

Tomoya:
No, it's something a little different.
I mean... I wanna run to school with you, wearing matching boxer shorts and not much else...

Youhei:
Tomoya...

Tomoya:
Hurry up and catch me! I'm right here!

Youhei:
Stop teasing me! It's not fair!

Tomoya:
Ha ha, come and get me!

Youhei:
Here I come!

Tomoya:
Oh man, what's wrong with me?

Mei:
So, can I continue now or what?

Tomoya:
Sorry, I think Akio's been rubbing off on me lately.

Mei:
What I've been trying to say is that I'm worried about you and Nagisa!

Tomoya:
Huh?

Mei:
To be blunt, I don't think you two have been open with each other.
You guys have been serious about each other for weeks, and you're still acting like this?

Tomoya:
I can't believe I'm being lectured about romance by a middle schooler.

Mei:
Here's a question for you.
If you could change one thing about Nagisa, what would it be?

Tomoya:
What would I change?
Let me see...
Well, she tends to be critical of herself a lot. So I guess if it was my choice, I'd like her to have more confidence.

Mei:
That's exactly what I was thinking too!
This is great!
My plan may work after all!

Tomoya:
Plan? What plan?

Nagisa:
Excuse me, Okazaki?

Mei:
Wow, speaking of the devil! There she is now!
What a coincidence!

Tomoya:
Coincidence, huh?

Mei:
Well, looks like I'm in the way.
I guess I'll be going.

Tomoya:
Wait a sec, I thought you two were supposed to be hanging out today.

Nagisa:
Huh? Oh, uh... oh yeah, I guess I forgot about that.
Hey, Tomoya?

Tomoya:
Ah, I'm Tomoya now?

Nagisa:
Tomoya, are you busy right now?

Tomoya:
Uh, no, I'm totally free.

Nagisa:
Oh, that's good.
Then, what do you say the two of us go for a little walk?

Tomoya:
What's with you all of a sudden?

Nagisa:
I-I just thought it would be nice to take a walk, that's all.
It's not a problem, is it?

Tomoya:
No problem at all.

Nagisa:
You know...
You're... really... lucky, Tomoya!

Tomoya:
Why's that?

Nagisa:
B-Because you get to go on a walk with a sort-of-cute girl like me.

Tomoya:
Ahh!

Nagisa:
I... I, uh... I said cute, but just sort of cute.

Tomoya:
Sure, whatever.
But where are we going?

Nagisa:
Oh, that's right.
I guess we... should go back home.

Tomoya:
Ahh! Already?!
But we just left!

Nagisa:
But if we don't go back, then the plan won't work.

Tomoya:
What plan?

Nagisa:
Oh. No, it's nothing. Never mind!

Nagisa:
Good afternoon!

Akio:
Welcome! Ah... oh, it's just you.

Tomoya:
Why would you say good afternoon like that in your own house?

Nagisa:
Because I'm a customer right now.
I came to buy bread.

Akio:
You don't have to buy it, just take it for free.
It's not like we're gonna sell out.

Nagisa:
That's not good at all! It's cheating!
I'll pay like anyone else does.

Akio:
Okay, okay, fine.
I know you get pretty stubborn sometimes.
Do whatever you want!
But... watch out for land mines.

Nagisa:
Land mines? What do you mean?

Akio:
You tell her, kid!
You know what I'm saying.

Tomoya:
Actually, I don't...

Akio:
Ugh! You liar! You just don't wanna say it!

Tomoya:
Yeah...

Akio:
You little coward!
All right then, I'll just have to tell her myself!
By land mine... what I'm talking about... is Sanae's bread!
Ah, oh!

Sanae:
Are you saying... my bread is nothing but a death trap?!

Akio:
No, wait! I love it! Sanae!

Tomoya:
So, now what?

Nagisa:
Well, even if no one's here, I'd still like to leave some money for them.

Um... would you mind paying for me, Tomoya?

Tomoya:
What's wrong? You don't have any cash?

Nagisa:
I do... but I'd like you to pay if that's all right.
Um, do you mind?

Tomoya:
Nope! Don't mind at all.
How much?

Nagisa:
It's 120 yen.

Tomoya:
Here.

Nagisa:
Perfect! Thank you very much!
Oh, how nice of you to treat me, Tomoya!

Tomoya:
What are you talking about? You made me pay.

Nagisa:
But it's okay because I know you won't be upset about it.

Tomoya:
And why's that?

Nagisa:
Well... because it's for me, right?

Tomoya:
Huh?
Hold on a sec! You mind repeating that for me?

Nagisa:
I can. But I really don't want to.

Tomoya:
No, I really didn't understand you.

Nagisa:
Oh, I see.
Well, in that case, I guess I have no choice but to say it again.
Listen closely this time.

Tomoya:
Okay.

Nagisa:
What I said was "I know you won't be upset because you're buying the bread for me!"
I said it pretty loud.
You heard me that time, right?

Tomoya:
Uh, yeah, I heard you.

Nagisa:
Good. I was afraid I had to say it out louder.

Tomoya:
So, is it good?

Nagisa:
I'm so nervous right now, I can't even taste it.

Tomoya:
What's there to be nervous about?

Nagisa:
Oh, I forgot to say my line!
Let's see. Since you bought it for me, it's, uh, even more delicious than usual!

Tomoya:
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

Nagisa:
You're supposed to ask for a bite, Tomoya.

Tomoya:
It doesn't really work when you tell me what I want.

Nagisa:
Okay, then I'll try to make it like a question.
Tomoya, would you like to have a bite?

Tomoya:
Not really.

Nagisa:
You're really making this tough on me.

Tomoya:
So, I'm supposed to say "Yes I get it."

Nagisa:
Would you like to have a bite?

Tomoya:
Yeah, I really want a bite!

Nagisa:
Really? For real?
Sorry, but you can't have any!

Tomoya:
Ooh!

Nagisa:
Oh, are you okay, Tomoya?! What's wrong?

Tomoya:
Why can't I have any?

Nagisa:
Because... because I don't have enough to share.

Tomoya:
Fine, just forget about it.

Nagisa:
That won't do at all!
We'll just have to come up with a way for you to enjoy it without eating it!

Tomoya:
Well, whatever makes you happy.

Nagisa:
Okay. Then, try turning your head toward me.

Tomoya:
You mean like this?

Nagisa:
Perfect!

Tomoya:
Uh...?

Nagisa:
Hah...
Um... how was that?
You were supposed to get a nice whiff of my cinnamon roll.
Tomoya, don't just stare. Say something!
If you keep looking at me like that, I'm gonna cry.

Tomoya:
Hey, Mei! I see you!

Mei:
Heh he...

Tomoya:
You can't trick me. I knew this was your idea!

Mei:
You figured it out, huh?

Tomoya:
Of course, I did!
No matter how you look at it, it was way too forced!

Mei:
Operation Date is complete!
Mei signing off!

Tomoya:
Come back here, you brat!

Nagisa:
Okazaki!

Tomoya:
That little punk!
I don't get it.
Was Mei blackmailing you or something? Is that it?

Nagisa:
Oh, no. It's nothing like that.
I just...

Tomoya:
Did she say something to you?

Nagisa:
She said... you were self-conscious about being a delinquent, so you didn't wanna force yourself on me.
And since I'm older than you are, I should be taking the initiative in our relationship.

Tomoya:
Yeah, I figured it was something like that.

Nagisa:
I was trying to follow the plan that Mei wrote, but I kept messing it up!
I'm sorry, this was really dumb of me.

Tomoya:
Yeah, I agree.

Nagisa:
After all that, I wouldn't blame you if you hated me.

Tomoya:
I wouldn't hate you for all the bad dates in the world.
Besides, even if her methods were off, I think Mei was right in a way.
You know the day's not over just yet.
You have a sec?

Nagisa:
Uh, well, I guess I might have a little more time before dinner.

Tomoya:
In that case, why don't you and I take a little walk to work up our appetite.
Where do you wanna go?

Nagisa:
Uh... anywhere's okay with me.
I mean, as long as I'm with you.

Tomoya:
Glad to hear it.

Nagisa:
Then, uh...
Let's stay together forever.
