  Kouko :
And that's exactly why I was relieved to see the two of you.
Your shining faces!

Tomoya:
Huh?

Nagisa :
The two of us?

Tomoya :
She's right here.
You can talk to her, talk about the feelings you've held in for two years.

Kouko :
What's wrong?
Is something the matter?
Nagisa? Okazaki?

Tomoya :
Is this possible?



Kouko :
Have you heard this rumor?

Tomoya :
What rumor?

Kouko :
That Fuuko is here at this school, that she's healthy and running around with her friends?

Nagisa :
Oh, Miss Ibuki!

Kouko :
Of course, I know that's not possible.
It's just not possible.
After all, I see her sleeping figure every day... in the hospital.
Even if only in her dreams, I'm glad if she's surrounded by lots of friends, good friends, close friends.
If she can only dream, then I just hope that she is always with her friends.
If she were ever to wake up, and then come back to this school, will the two of you make a solemn vow to me that you will be her very best friends?

Nagisa :
Of course, we will.

Tomoya :
I'm sure your sister would be one of the most adorable girls in school. We try, but we just couldn't leave her alone.
She's so fun to be with.

Kouko :
Even just that would be a great comfort because she wasn't very sociable and had very few close friends.
So please, keep her company... until the end of her dream.

Tomoya :
Kouko, if I may, it's not my place to say so, but you should marry your fiance.

Kouko:
Huh?!

Tomoya:
I'm sure that's what your sister wants.
She only wants you to be happy.

Nagisa :
Yes, I think so, too, Miss Ibuki.

Tomoya ;
If she knew you were reconsidering your engagement just because of her,
I know that she would be very sad inside.
For your little sister's sake as well, please marry him.

Nagisa :
Yes, and she would think that your happiness is her happiness.
I just know she would.

Kouko :
I can't explain it, but I feel like your words have a strange power.
I feel like that child really thinks that.
Up until just now,
I have to confess I wasn't able to think that way.
Leaving Fuuko all alone in a coma and becoming happy myself.

Tomoya :
Pardon me for saying so, but thinking that way is quite selfish.

Kouko :
I have to say you could very well be right about that. But still, I do want to be happy. *chuckles*

Tomoya :
I just know... Kouko, I know your sister will awaken one day, won't she?

Kouko :
I hope so.
I really do hope so.



Botan:
Puhi~! Puhi~!

Fuuko :
So you like it? You like it?!

Botan:
Puhi~!!

Fuuko:
If you would like to, I would very much like you to come to my sister's upcoming wedding.

Botan:
Puhi~!

Fuuko:
So you'll say you'll come?
Thank you very much.
I didn't know that my sister was hesitating to get married.

Botan:
Puhi Puhi Puhi Puhi~!!



Tomoya (voice over):
But it's a good thing Fuuko's finally decided.

Nagisa (voice over):
Yes, thanks to you.
I'll work harder and increase the number of people attending.
I know I can.
I can help her.

Tomoya :
Yeah, let's pass out starfish throughout the school.
She's such a strong person.

Nagisa :
Hm, What I did was hurtful to Fuuko...

Tomoya :
It's not your fault at all, Nagisa.
If anyone, I'm the one who should be blamed. I just couldn't believe that it was all true.
I wanted her to meet Kouko and verify her existence.

In the end, you were the one who was right, not me.

Fuuko :
Here.

Student:
Uh...?


Fuuko:
Please accept this.

Student:
Ah...well...

Fuuko:
Here you go!

Nagisa :
Fuu-chan is working even harder than before.

Tomoya :
If only she would come out of her coma, it would be a happy ending for everyone.

Nagisa :
Surely, it will be soon.
Then she can attend Miss Ibuki's wedding and join her on her very special day.

Fuuko :
Please accept this.

Tomoya :
She ignored her totally.

Nagisa :
It was like she didn't even see Fuu-chan.

Tomoya :
Hey, wait a minute.
I just remembered there's one more person who might accept one.


Tomoya:
Kotomi, Kotomi~! Kotomi~!!
Hey, notice us.

Kotomi-chan~!

Kotomi :
Huh?
Tomoya...

Tomoya :
So that's all it takes for you to notice us?

Fuuko :
What is your relationship with her?

Tomoya :
This is our relationship.
There's nothing else.

Kotomi :
And who is this?

Fuuko :
I came here explicitly to give this to you.
Please accept this gift.

Kotomi :
Is she a bully?

Tomoya :
She's not harassing you, Kotomi.
She says she wants to give you a present.
That's all.

Kotomi :
A present for me?

Fuuko :
Yes, if you will, please attend my sister's upcoming wedding to her precious fiance.

Kotomi :
A star?

Tomoya :
No, it's a starfish.

Kotomi :
A starfish?
Starfish, scientific name is asterias amurensis -- an invertebrate.
Echinodermata, or in English, starfish.
Other encyclopedia citations call the creature a sea star.
While appearing dorsal, it is actually carnivorous.
That starfish?

Fuuko :
Terrific~!
This starfish-person is more knowledgeable about starfish than even I am!

Tomoya :
Yeah, just as you'd expect from a genius.

Kotomi :
Actually, I am not very well-versed about animals.

Fuuko :
That's not true, smarty-girl.
I would especially like someone as smart as you to accept one. You must please come to it.

Kotomi :
A present for me?
Thank you very much.

Fuuko :
I'm glad she liked my present.

Tomoya :
You two should get along really well.
You're both kind of dazed and seem a little awkward.

Fuuko :
I am not awkward,
you critical monster meanie!
I am much more skillful than you, and much smarter than you.
So there!

Tomoya :
Oh yeah, well you've done it now.
I think you and I should go ahead and compete in a tongue twister's face off!

Fuuko :
I accept your challenge...

Tomoya :
Kris Kringle carefully crunched on multi-colored crimson candy canes while climbing the catacombs!
Yes...!

Fuuko :
For your information it was, "spelunking".

Tomoya :
Who would bite their words that way?!
You're one pretty crafty tongue twister player.

Fuuko :
Crafty?

Tomoya :
It means that you're dishonest.

Fuuko :
I am not dishonest!
I am very fair.
The neighbors all said I was one of the fairest girls on the block.

Tomoya :
And what kind of neighborhood is that?

Fuuko :
Here goes.
Tokyo Tokkyo Kyokakyoku! Tokyo Tokkyo Kyokakyoku!! Tokyo Tokkyo Kyokakyoku!!

How about that?

Tomoya :
Don't stand there and make a face like you did it perfectly.

Fuuko :
Okazaki, you are a very rude person!

Tomoya :
You're the one who's rude.

Sunohara :
Hi, there.
You two are getting along as usual.

Fuuko :
We do not get along at all~!

Tomoya :
Yeah, we're right in the middle of a tongue twister fight.

Sunohara:
Hm.

Fuuko :
Okazaki and you, Sunohara, had better not do anything that will trouble me or upset me in the least. Or else something very bad will happen to you both.

Sunohara :
Oh hoo, why don't you tell me what will happen?
Come on. Come on. Tell me.

(Fuuko's silent whistle)

Sunohara:
Gah? Huh?
Wah?!

Fuuko Fan-Club:
WE'RE ALL HERE TO PROTECT FUUKOOooo~!!

Sunohara:
OOuuu~!!

Tomoya :
So where did your fans take him?

Fuuko :
I don't know.

Tomoya:
Hm.

Nagisa :
You gave out a lot of invitations today.

Fuuko :
Yes, I'll make tomorrow's batch when I go home.

Tomoya :
Hey, Fuuko, would you mind terribly going home alone again today?
Nagisa and I have something we need to do.

Nagisa:
Huh?

Tomoya :
Excuse me.

Nagisa :
Hello, Miss Ibuki.

Kouko :
Oh, hello.
Welcome to you both.
And what are you here for today?

Tomoya :
There was something I wanted to ask you.
I was wondering, you haven't by any chance changed your mind about getting married, have you Kouko?

Kouko :
Are you saying that you were worried about that and came to verify it?
Oh don't you worry.
My fiance and I have already discussed the situation.

Nagisa :
Is that so?

Kouko :
Except we can't get a reservation at a Wedding Hall.
It looks like it'll be a while before we can have a ceremony.
There are a lot of happy people in the world, it seems.

Tomoya:
A Wedding Hall?

Kouko:
Actually, to be honest, I wanted to get married at the school -
at the high school where I taught those many wonderful students.

Nagisa :
You mean at our school?

Kouko :
I thought it would be so meaningful to be married surrounded by my students, and the teachers and dear friends... with my sister there.

(Nagisa sniffles)
Tomoya :
Don't start crying again.

Nagisa :
Okay I'll try to stop.

Tomoya :
If I could, can I ask you something about your sister?

Kouko :
Yes?

Tomoya :
I remember that you said that Fuko was a little shy and awkward around people and not good at making friends, didn't you?
What kind of girl was she? Before the accident.

C L A N N A D
- クラナド -

Kouko (voice over):
That first summer after I became a teacher, we went to the beach with relatives.
There were other children Fuu-chan's age, but she all but hid behind me.
Even when people talked to her, she wasn't able to greet them.
She sat on the beach playing with a starfish the whole time, all alone.
I realized for the first time then Fuu-chan wouldn't go near anyone.
She graduated junior high like that.

Student 1:
We're going that way too,
would you like to walk with us?

Student 2:
She doesn't talk very much does she?

Student 1:
Oh well...
bye!

Kouko:
But I knew that she couldn't go on like that.
As we went in to spring break, I tried to keep my distance from her.
It was very difficult, but I kept up a front that I was very busy.
I think Fuu-chan is very lonely but I hope that her loneliness would spur her to make friends at the new school.
And on the morning of the entrance ceremony, she said she'd work on making friends.
It was a very nice morning that day.
I remember it so clearly.
The sun... shining... as bright as her smile.

(Nagisa sniffles)

Tomoya :
And on the way home after the ceremony, she had the accident.

Kouko :
But it seems so strange.
Why are you two so interested in her?
If I'm not mistaken, you two have never even met my sister.
Yet you care so much.

Tomoya :
To be honest, it may be because both Furukawa and I... we're kind of awkward around people like your sister is in some way or another.

Fuuko :
Here you go.
Please accept this present.

Tomoya :
It's only until Fuuko opens her eyes. When she's discharged and returns to school,
Kouko will realize that she has lots of friends.
She's not shy or awkward at all.

Nagisa :
Yes...

Tomoya :
It is true that more and more people are accepting our starfish gifts.
It's because everyone believes Fuuko has been discharged from the hospital and the rumors about a ghost are gone.

Sunohara :
A discharge? What are you talking about?

Tomoya :
You lost the match, remember?
What are you even doing here?

Sunohare :
Stop being so rigid.
I only wanted to spend time with my lovely Nagisa.

Nagisa :
Oh!
Thank you very much. But I think you will meet some nice girl who'll be a little more suited to your personality, Sunohara.

Sunohara :
I've been rejected in an instant!

Tomoya :
There are still a lot of students of all ages in this school who ignore Fuuko, so I was thinking we might wanna consider handing out some other kind of present to them.

Fuuko :
Well I don't think that's necessary
Every one of the kids who accepted them were glad to have them.

Sunohare :
Oh, they're just saying they're happy.
No one in this school would be happy getting something like a shuriken.

Tomoya :
Shuriken?

Sunohara :
This thing is a shuriken. It is, isn't it?

Fuuko :
This is a starfish~!

Sunohara :
Starfish?!
I thought it was a shuriken all this time!

Fuuko :
Really! Okazaki and Sunohara, you are both so rude.

Nagisa :
But it's true that most of the people who accepted the invitations don't know that it's a starfish.

Tomoya :
It's not necessary to tell them, is it?

Fuuko :
You know that someday very soon, I'd like to tell all of those who look like they'd appreciate it, that it's a starfish.

(Fuuko whispers)
Actually it's a starfish...

Student:
Uaaa!

Tomoya :
That's out-and-out harrasment if you ask me.

Fuuko :
And then, after I've given one to everyone in the whole student body, I'll make a public announcement.
"Actually it's a starfish!"

Tomoya :
I'd love to see the whole student body fall flat on their faces but...

Fuuko :
They won't fall flat. They'll have a festival!
It'll become a school event, just like Founder's Festival~!
It'll be so much fun!

(Students cheer)

Tomoya :
I could go to my grave without seeing that.

Sunohara :
We should probably distribute something cuter than that.

Nagisa :
Then what about...

Tomoya :
Rejected!

Nagisa :
But I haven't said anything yet.

Tomoya :
Believe me you don't have to.
You're gonna bring up the Big Dango Family.

Nagisa :
Yes, but I...

Sunohara :
Hey, don't just brush off Nagisa's ideas like they were nothing!

Tomoya :
Then tell me.
Do you think the Big Dango Family is cute?
Are they as adorable as all get-out?

Sunohara :
Well, there must be some situations sometimes where someone could call them cute and adorable.

Nagisa :
Not sometimes, the Big Dango Family is always cute, don't you know?

Fuuko :
Excuse me, I'm very sorry Nagisa, but I think starfish are cuter than the Big Dango Family any day of the week.

Tomoya :
Oh, so an outbreak a war between starfish and dango?

Nagisa :
Of course starfish are cute, but the Big Dango Family is a heck of a lot cuter and everyone knows it.

Fuuko :
I get the appeal of the Big Dango Family, but I don't care. I want to give out starfish to everyone!

Sunohara :
I've never seen Nagisa so passionate.

Tomoya :
They'll never give in on this one.

Nagisa :
Starfish don't have a theme song, but dangos have a really cute theme song they sing.
And I'm gonna sing it.
"Dango dango... dango dango... dango- Dango Family."

Fuuko :
Starfish can do as much as they can.
I'm going to sing.
"Starfish... starfish..."

Nagisa :
That's plagiarism~!

Sunohara :
So how long you think this competition will last?

Tomoya :
How would I know.
At this point no one will ever be able to stop them.

Nagisa :
Okay, then starfish and dango are both number one!

Fuuko :
Yeah~!!

Nagisa:
Huh?

Tomoya :
Let's just cool off and start the whole thing from the beginning.

Fuuko :
After all that, I still want to stay with the idea of giving starfish.
If we change now, I feel like we'll lose the momentum we've gained.

Tomoya :
What exactly are you two fighting with anyway?

Fuuko :
Well, look at how cute these little buggers are!

(Fuuko daydreams)

Tomoya :
Again, Sunohara.
Can you do me a favor and just put your face down on this table?

Sunohara :
On the table?

Tomoya :
Please, man, believe me your handsome face is the only way to help her.

Sunohara :
Well okay, if you put it that way.

Tomoya :
How easy to manipulate...

Nagisa :
Okazaki, what are you...?

Fuuko :
Eeh?!
I guess that while I was poking the starfish I got too relaxed.

Tomoya :
It's okay.
Poke around all you like.

Fuuko :
You don't have to tell me.
I'll poke away!

(Sunohara bites Fuuko's finger)

Fuuko:
Eh?!
Aaaah~!!

Tomoya :
That looks painful, very painful.



Tomoya :
Furukawa, come with me.
We're going to see Komura.



Komura:
I must say... it's quite unusual for you to ask me for help.

Tomoya:
You do remember Ibuki, the art teacher who use to work here?

Komura:
Ibuki...?
I remember well!
An uncommonly hairy chested guy... *chuckles*

Tomoya:
No! No! No!
Not that guy!
Kouko Ibuki the popular Art Teacher who quit 3 years ago.

Komura:
Oh! That's right.
Recently I fear I'm finding I'm getting so forgetful.

Tomoya:
She's suppose to be getting married really soon.

Komura:
Well, congratulations!
(grabs Tomoya's hands)

Tomoya:
Not to me Komura...

Komura:
...please don't use such ambiguous speech.

Tomoya:
It's not ambiguous speech by any stretch, good grief where does the seriousness begin with you Pops?

Komura:
(sips tea)
Oh, if I understand correctly your request is to allow them to have their wedding here at school is that right?

Nagisa:
Huh? Wait a minute, how did you know about that?

Komura:
Why yes, Miss Ibuki might have might have mentioned it to me once or twice while she was teaching here with me. We were very close friends so we use to chat a great deal.

Tomoya:
What exactly is the forgetful part?

Nagisa:
Well how about it?
Could you please allow us to have the wedding here?

Komura:
I'll try talking to the Principal about the matter.
I don't want you to worry about it.
All our Teachers and Administrative Staff here were always so very fond of Miss Ibuki.

Nagisa:
Oh...



Kouko:
Have our wedding at the school?

Nagisa:
Oh yes, Mr. Komura is going to arrange everything for us.

Tomoya:
You don't have to wait months for an opening at a Wedding Hall.

Nagisa:
You can get married right away!

Kouko:
Thank you both very much, it's just so sweet of you to arrange it-
But I have bad news... I'm afraid Fuuko's condition has gotten worse.

Tomoya:
Hn?



Kouko (voice over):
The other day, the Doctor told me she probably won't awaken again...

Kouko:
But I... still believe that Fuu-chan will open her eyes someday.



(Nagisa cries)

Kouko (voice over):
But I don't know if it will be... next week or ten years from now...
after I get married I plan to move to the next town near her hospital, then I will be able to be with her longer.
And maybe be there... when she opens those eyes...

(Tomoya cries)



Tomoya:
I wonder if Fuuko knew... that's why she did the only thing she could; increase the number of guests at the wedding.

Sunohara:
Hey...
you look really depressed, did something happen to you today?

Tomoya:
Happen to me, what about you?
You seemed pretty out of it too.

Sunohara:
I gotta tell ya, after you left with Nagisa , this strange thing happened.

(Flash back)

Fuuko:
Please accept this...

Fuuko:
Please accept this!
Would you uh, please accept this?
Eh...?

Sunohara:
Wah!?

Sunohara:
Hey wait a minute!

Student 1:
Yeah what do you want?
What's wrong with you?

Sunohara:
Don't act dumb with me!
An Underclassman just called out to you guys, why did you ignored her?

Student 2:
Underclassman? What are you talking about?

Sunohara:
Don't give me that! Just now a girl called out to you!
She handed you a sculpture and asked you to accept it!

(Both Students look to where Sunohara is pointing)

Student 1:
What is wrong with you?
Who did what?

Sunohara:
What am I-

Student 2:
I don't see any girl...

Sunohara:
Ung...

(Flash Back ends)

Sunohara:
It wasn't some kind of joke.
I'm serious, these guys couldn't even see Fuuko there.

Okazaki, who is this girl "Fuuko"?

Tomoya:
What do you mean Sunohara?

Sunohara:
I heard of Fuuko Ibuki...
on the day of her Entrance Ceremony the poor girl had a terrible accident and she's been hospitalized in a coma ever since.

Tomoya:
But her name is Fuuko Isogai...

Sunohara:
I asked all the Sophomores participating in the various clubs on campus.
And not one them ever known a "Fuuko Isogai".
And that's not all, I don't think people are remembering her.

Tomoya:
Are you saying she's being forgotten?

Sunohara:
Even the people who received sculptures are forgetting her
they don't even remember receiving a sculpture! It's like they never got one.

Tomoya:
Uh...

Sunohara:
Okazaki... what in the World is happening here?
Why don't they remember Fuuko?

Tomoya:
Uh...

Sunohara:
Okazaki?
Are you listening!?


Next Episode

Fuuko:
You know, I'm kind of starting to feel that you're not such a bad soul, Okazaki.

Tomoya:
So you thought of me as bad person up till now?

Fuuko:
Right now I like you better than a sea slug!

Tomoya:
Really? Great!
I have absolutely no idea what that level is.



Tomoya:
I'm leaving...

It's begining to start with those who didn't know her well.

Sanae:
Welcome home Fuuko!
