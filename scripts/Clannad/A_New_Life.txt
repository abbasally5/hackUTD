  Tomoyo:
Those in agreement, raise your hands.
Then it's settled.
As decided by majority rule, both the Drama and Choir clubs will have Mr. Koumura as their advisor, and are hereby sanctioned for club activities.

Kyou:
You finally pulled it off! Nice work!

Nagisa:
Thanks.

Ryou:
Congratulations on the revival of the club, Nagisa.

Kotomi:
I made plenty of food so we could all celebrate together.

Nagisa:
Thank you so much for your help, everyone.
I couldn't have done without you.

Youhei:
I have to admit, I did help out a lot, didn't I?

Kyou:
And what exactly did you do?

Youhei:
You don't remember the basketball game?
And I helped Tomoyo with her election, too!
That was all me!

Nagisa:
I'm so lucky to have good friends like you to support me.
Without your help, I couldn't have accomplished anything.
I really can't thank you enough.
You guys are the best!

Tomoya:
Anyway, we can't sit back and relax now.
We still have the school festival before summer break.
That was the whole reason we were doing this, right?

Nagisa:
You don't think it's too late for that now?

Tomoya:
We've come this far, why hesitate now?

Nagisa:
Okazaki...

Tomoya:
You said that was your dream, right?
And now you can make it come true.
This is no time to give up!
You have to stand up and seize this opportunity while you can!

Everyone:
Mm!

Nagisa:
That's true, isn't it?
I have to give it my best, no matter what!


--- OP ---


Tomoya:
Home visit?

Teacher:
Yes. I'm going to see your father today to discuss your future.

Tomoya:
It's all right, really.

Teacher:
No, this is important, especially considering your recent suspension.
Your father should be home right now, correct?

Tomoya:
Well, it's kinda hard to say.
Sometimes he's in, and sometimes he isn't.

Teacher:
That's all right with me.
I'm willing to take a chance.
Wait here for a minute while I get ready.

Nagisa:
What's up, Okazaki?

Tomoya:
Ah!

Nagisa:
Is there something wrong?

Tomoya:
Never mind me.
What are you doing here?

Nagisa:
I thought maybe I could get some advice from Mr. Koumura about the club.
Now we gotta practice non-stop!
Why don't you come join us?
I'm sure everyone will be happy to see you.

Tomoya:
Sorry, but I don't care about that kind of stuff.
I'll catch you tomorrow, okay?

Nagisa:
Oh... W-Wait!
What about all those things you said back in the club room?!
You said to seize the opportunity and make my dreams come true!
Y-You really gave me a lot of confidence.
Don't tell me you didn't mean it!

Tomoya:
We can talk some other time, okay?

Nagisa:
Okazaki, wait!

Tomoya:
Why are you following me?!

Nagisa:
Because I'm worried and I wanna know where you're going!

Announcer:
Tomoya Okazaki of Class 3-B! Tomoya Okazaki, come to the office immediately!

Tomoya:
I'm not gonna run away, so stop pulling me, all right?

Nagisa:
No way!

Tomoya:
Give me a break, Nagisa.
Don't you trust me?

Nagisa:
Nope!

Tomoya:
You didn't have to think about that one much!

Nagisa:
I'm sorry, Okazaki.
But you have a tendency to lie.



第19回 新しい生活 (A New Life)

Teacher:
Aha ha ha ha.
Now that's a funny picture, isn't it?
Never thought I'd see you getting ordered around by a girl!

Tomoya:
It sounds a lot worse when you put it like that.

Nagisa:
It's a bit strange, since he's usually ordering me around.

Teacher:
Hmm, Okazaki's pretty mellow now that you are here.
Hey, listen. Would you mind coming with us?
So Okazaki doesn't run away...

Nagisa:
Sure, I'd love to help out in any way I can!

Tomoya:
B-But I thought you said you needed to talk to Mr. Koumura about the club?

Nagisa:
Oh, I forgot.
I guess that's important too.

Tomoya:
Jeez, slackin' off already, huh?

Teacher:
I can't believe the way he talks to you!
How can you put up with that?

Nagisa:
Heh! You get used to it after a while!


Teacher:
So it's just been you and your dad living together since you were really young, you said?

Tomoya:
Yeah.

Teacher:
Wow, that must have been hard on him.
Raising a little troublemaker like you all by himself, I mean.

Tomoya:
Yeah...

Tomoya:
Too bad. Looks like he's out.

Teacher:
Hmm...
Well, what can you do?
Guess I'll just have to wait inside.

Tomoya:
But, wait!

Teacher:
It's part of being a teacher.
I'll wait here till tomorrow morning if I have to.

Tomoya:
I-I'll go look for my dad, okay?

Teacher:
Hey! Okazaki, wait!

Tomoya:
Maybe I can hide out at Sunohara's.

Nagisa:
Okazaki!
You ran away, didn't you?

Tomoya:
Uh, aren't you supposed to be at practice?

Nagisa:
It turned out that Mr. Koumura couldn't make it, so we all decided to call it a day early.
You left your bag in the club room, so I was going to your house to return it.

Tomoya:
Hah...

Nagisa:
Stay close to me. I'm keeping an eye on you!

Naoyuki:
...I'm not sure, really.
What did Tomoya have to say?

Teacher:
Uh, I believe there's been a misunderstanding.
I haven't spoken to Tomoya yet.
Of course, I'm going to discuss the matter with him as well.
But I wanted to speak to you about it first.

Naoyuki:
I understand, but I'm afraid that's not my decision to make.
Tomoya is Tomoya, after all.
He can decide on his own.

Teacher:
But he's still just a student, Mr. Okazaki.
For now at least, his guardian should also be...

Naoyuki:
No, Tomoya is Tomoya.
My opinion on the issue doesn't matter.


Tomoya:
Well, now you know what he's like.
As far as he's concerned, I'm not even his son anymore.
I told you what happened, right?
We got in a big fight and I hurt my shoulder.
That's why I can't play basketball anymore.
After that, everything changed.
We're like strangers.
We stopped being family ages ago.
We may live under the same roof, but our lives are completely separate - completely unconnected.
He still keeps a smile on his face, but I know he's all alone in the world.

Nagisa:
Um, I have an idea.

Tomoya:
Hm?

Nagisa:
Would you like to stay at my house for a while?

Tomoya:
Huh?

Nagisa:
Uh, I mean... only if it's not any trouble or anything.

Tomoya:
Ah, no. No trouble at all.

Nagisa:
I thought, for a while at least. It might be better to put some space between you and your dad.
No matter what happens, you're still family.
If you're apart, I know you'll miss each other.
Then, bit by bit, you'll remember the things you loved about each other.
And the next time you meet, you'll be able to talk things out, without all the bitterness.
But still... I'm worried about your dad.

Tomoya:
I'm sure he'll be fine.
Even if it doesn't look like it, he's been living alone for a long time now.

Nagisa:
Oh, I see.
But you... should visit once in a while.

Tomoya:
Yeah, once in a while, I guess.


Tomoya:
This was the house I always returned to.
But it's different now.
This time, I may never come back.
Or maybe... some day, I can return here for good.

TV:
Imagine finding dishes made with such fresh ingredients so close to home.
This restaurant truly is a treasure.
And not only is the food a treat to eat, the owner is rather charming as well.
Even if you're only stopping in for an appetizer, having a chance to meet her is well worth the trip, I assure you.
I'm coming back during summer break with my family.

Tomoya:
Huh...?

Naoyuki:
Tomoya, are you going somewhere again?

Tomoya:
Just to a friend's house.

Naoyuki:
That's an awfully big bag.

Tomoya:
They're putting me up for a while.
I haven't decided when I'll be back.

Naoyuki:
I see.
It'll be lonely without you.
Even if we didn't speak much, I was always happy to have you around.

Tomoya:
Sorry, but I have my reasons for this.
Try to understand.

Naoyuki:
I'll do my best.

Tomoya:
Well, see you later.

Goodbye, Dad. So long.


Tomoya:
Hello?

Akio:
What do you want barging in at this time of night?

Tomoya:
Huh?

Wait, didn't Nagisa tell her parents yet?

Akio:
If you ain't got business here, get out.
I got a lot of work to do.

Tomoya:
Is Nagisa here?

Sanae:
Hi, Okazaki.
Come on in.
From today on, you'll be part of the family.

Tomoya:
I'll try my best.
Thanks for having me.

Akio:
Thanks for having you?
What's he talking about?

Sanae:
Tomoya has some things he needs to work out, so he'll be staying here with us for a while.

Akio:
Oh, is that so?

Sanae:
Nagisa told us about it earlier.
Don't you remember?

Akio:
Of course, I do.

Tomoya:
Ahh...
You knew all along?

Akio:
That's right.
But you know... this is no good.

Sanae:
Oh? What do you mean?

Akio:
I won't be the only man in the house anymore.
I just wanna feel special, that's all!

Sanae:
Don't mind him, Tomoya.
He just gets worked up sometimes.
Go on upstairs.

Tomoya:
Yes, ma'am.

Akio:
Don't get too comfortable around here, you little punk!

Sanae:
There, there.
Let's calm down and get back to work, okay?

Nagisa:
Welcome home, Okazaki.
I've been waiting for you.


Tomoya:
Are you sure I can stay in such a nice room?

Nagisa:
It's our guest room - that's what it's for!
The bedding is here in the closet.
If you're not used to sleeping on a futon,
I can lay it out and make it up for you.

Tomoya:
No, it's all right, really.
I can do that much.

Nagisa:
Just don't leave them on the floor all day.

Tomoya:
Wow, you're quite the busybody, aren't you?
I never knew.

Nagisa:
No way! I am not!
I have my own problems to worry about.

Tomoya:
Yeah, but that doesn't stop you from worrying about other people's problems too.

Nagisa:
Well, yeah. I guess...


Akio:
Seconds please, Sanae!

Sanae:
Sure!

Tomoya:
Uh, thanks for the bath.

Akio:
Sure. Bet it felt nice, huh?

Sanae:
Would you like to have some tea with us?

Tomoya:
Uh, yeah. Thank you.

Tomoya:
For some reason, I still can't calm down.
Guess I'll get used to it.


Nagisa:
We're leaving now.
See you later!

Sanae:
All right, have a nice day at school.

Nagisa:
You have to tell her goodbye too, Okazaki.

Tomoya:
Huh? Really?

Nagisa:
Yup!

Tomoya:
Okay, I'll see you later.

Sanae:
Have a nice day at school.

Nagisa:
Dad, I'm going to school.

Akio:
All right. Be careful, okay?

Nagisa:
'Kay.
Now, it's your turn.

Tomoya:
Oh, okay.
I'm... going to school now.

Akio:
Right! You go get 'em, kid!

Tomoya:
Get what?

Tomoya:
That was kind of embarrassing.
But your parents were so natural about it, so I guess I shouldn't feel too bad.

Nagisa:
It's fun walking to school together.
I'm used to being alone.

Tomoya:
Right now, I'm still too embarrassed.

Nagisa:
To be honest, I'm a little embarrassed myself!
But since I met you, I've grown more confident about a lot of things, so a little embarrassment doesn't bother me so much anymore.
Starting today, I'm gonna give it my all and make sure the school festival turns out great.

Tomoya:
All right. That's the spirit!

Nagisa:
You bet!

－クラナド－


Koumura:
The art crew will be responsible for the costumes and props.
The sound crew will handle the music and sound effects.
And last but not least, the light crew will handle the stage lighting.

Kotomi:
It sounds complicated, really complicated.

Ryou:
I guess we'd better assign tasks to everyone.

Kyou:
Why don't you handle the sound, Ryou?
After all, you were the sounding board for Kotomi's jokes, right?

Tomoyo:
Looks like this will be a big undertaking.

Youhei:
Now remind me, what are you doing here again?

Tomoyo:
I was worried about the drama club, of course.
What did you expect?
It's my job as student council president.

Koumura:
When it comes to the lightning and sound, the level of difficulty will depend on the play you choose.
For example, if there's a lot of fast-paced action going on, then operating the switches might be a bit more complicated.
As for sound effects, our keyboard should be fine.

Ryou:
This keyboard here?
Suspense!

Youhei:
Oh, that's awesome!

Kyou:
Give me a break. This isn't a game, you know.

Youhei:
Oh, come on, I just wanna try one.
Oh, what's that you say, Nagisa?

Nagisa:
Huh? What do you mean?

Youhei:
Is it true?
You like me more than Okazaki?!

Nagisa:
Wait! Wait! What?

Youhei:
All right, I understand.
Let us live together deep in the forest where no one can find us.
And so the fated lovers join hands and run into the misty sea of trees.
But! Standing behind them was Okazaki crazed with anger!

Tomoya:
Ha.

Youhei:
And... standing before them,
bearing their fangs were a pair of vicious harpies: Kyou and Tomoyo!
Argh!

Youhei:
It was just a joke.
They didn't have to punch me.

Kotomi:
Don't cry.
I thought your little solo performance was a lot of fun, Sunohara.

Tomoya:
Nagisa.

Nagisa:
Yes?

Tomoya:
A long time ago, you said there was some play you wanted to do.
What's it like?
Or can you tell me the name at least?

Nagisa:
Actually, I'm not exactly sure.


Tomoya:
Let me get this straight.
You know what play you wanna do for the festival, but you don't remember the title and that's why you couldn't tell me what it is?

Nagisa:
Right.

Nagisa:
Hi guys, I'm home from school!

Tomoya:
I'm home too!

Tomoya:
What's all this?

Nagisa:
These kids are students of the Furukawa Tutorial School.

Tomoya:
The Furukawa what?

Boy:
Who's that?
He's not our teacher.

Tomoya:
Hey! Don't mess with my stuff!

Nachan:
Oh!

Boy:
Uh-oh, Nachan's in trouble!

Tomoya:
Argh!

Nachan:
Oh, my...

Nagisa:
Oh, no!

Sanae:
All right, everyone. Let's begin class!

Kids:
Okay!

Sanae:
Sorry, Tomoya, but I'm afraid this was the only room I could use.

Tomoya:
So I guess this means you hold an after-school tutoring class?

Sanae:
Yes.

Boy:
Come on, Ms Furukawa. Forget about that loser already and let's start class.

Tomoya:
What did you just call me, punk?!

Nagisa:
Okazaki!

Sanae:
Everyone, you should treat your elders with respect and never call them losers.

Kids:
Yes, ma'am!


Akio:
Hey, punk!
If you got free time, then help out in the shop.
Or rather, why don't you take care of the shop, so I can have some free time?
It's always busy in the mornings and evenings.
The bread I bake is pretty popular, you know.

Tomoya:
But what about Sanae? Is she okay?

Akio:
I doubt she'll ever improve, but we still have some kind-hearted customers who will buy her bread out of pity.

Tomoya:
I don't mean her bread, I mean her class.
Handling kids can be really tough.

Akio:
It's nothing to worry about, really.
That's what she was trained in, after all.
A while back, she even used to teach in a middle school.

Tomoya:
No kidding?
Huh. Well then why'd she stop teaching?

Akio:
You know, things just happen sometimes.

Tomoya:
Man, I'm exhausted.

Nagisa:
Can I come in?

Tomoya:
Sure, go ahead!
Do you need something?

Nagisa:
Oh no. I just wanted to say hi.
It feels kind of strange having you staying in my house like this.
It's gonna take a little getting used to.
But I'm glad I can stop by like this.

Tomoya:
Yeah, but you guys are used to having guests staying over, aren't you?
I mean, Mei was just here.

Nagisa:
Sure, I guess so.
But at the same time, there's something special about you.
Sorry. I could go away if I'm getting on your nerves.

Tomoya:
No, I'm happy to have you.
Just, how do I put this? It feels kind of strange to me too.

Nagisa:
Strange? In what way?

Tomoya:
Uh, well, for almost as far back as I can remember, I've never had a mom around the house.
On top of that, you've seen how my dad is like.
Suddenly being part of a close-knit family feels kind of strange, that's all.

Nagisa:
Yeah, I understand.
My mom and dad dote on me so much, that it makes me feel a bit guilty sometimes.
Still, after all these years, I haven't been able to apologize to them.

Tomoya:
I don't get it.
Did you do something wrong?

Nagisa:
Actually, I'm not sure.
But somehow, I have this really bad feeling - like something happened when I was little.
It might not be my fault, but I feel like I must've done something really bad to them.

Tomoya:
I'm sure it's just your imagination.

Nagisa:
But Mom and Dad both say the same thing about it.
I bring it up and they alway change the subject.
And no matter what they say, I know they're hiding something.
Because whenever I mention it, Dad gets really nice all of a sudden.
They have to be hiding something.
And whatever it is, I feel like it must be something I need to apologize for.

Tomoya:
Something you need to apologize for?
Like what?

Nagisa:
That's what I'm trying to figure out.
That way, I can apologize.
I don't know, it's always on my mind.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't bother you with all this stuff.
It's not really your problem.

Tomoya:
Don't worry about it.
We're friends, aren't we?

Nagisa:
Right!

Sanae:
Okazaki, the bath is ready!

Tomoya:
Thank you, but I think I'm gonna take my bath a bit later.
You go ahead and take yours first.
If you don't mind, I think I'm gonna go see how Sunohara's doing.
He gets lonely if I don't stop by to visit every once in a while.

Nagisa:
Oh, I see.
In that case, say hi for me, and try not come back too late.


Tomoya:
I don't think there's any place in the world where I feel more at ease.
Tea, please!

Youhei:
Yeah right, you wish.
But what about dinner?
You didn't bring anything to eat this time.

Tomoya:
Nope. I actually had a real dinner this time.

Youhei:
Huh? Uh-huh, you mean at Nagisa's house?

Tomoya:
Yeah, how'd you know about that?

Youhei:
You're one lucky little bastard, you know that?

Tomoya:
Well you might think so, but it's kind of uncomfortable, really.
Don't get me wrong, I'm glad they're putting me up.
But for some reason, I just can't feel at home there.

Youhei:
Hold on a second!
Are you trying to tell me that you're living with Nagisa?!

Tomoya:
Oops, uh-oh...

Youhei:
I can't even look at you.

Tomoya:
It's not like that!
I'm just staying at their house.
Nagisa knows I don't get along with my old man, so she was just being considerate when she invited me.

Youhei:
You're living with her.
What kind of idea did you expect me to get?
You have her parents' approval.

Tomoya:
Come on!
I told you it's not like that!
They're just doing me a favor!

Youhei:
Yeah, you've got some nerve.
How can you still be talking like that even now?

Tomoya:
I don't know what you're getting at here.

Youhei:
Oh, man. What a shame!
I really feel sorry for Nagisa.

"I":
One day, I gathered together a bunch of odds and ends, and tried to make a another doll like me.

The girl:
I see.
So you want a friend?
That only makes sense.
You must be lonely all by yourself, right?
I'm sorry.

"I":
That's not quite it.
It's not so much that I'm lonely, really.
It's just that I thought it might be more fun if there were more like me.

The girl:
Then, let's try... even if it's impossible!
