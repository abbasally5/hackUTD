  Tomoyo:
It's morning, Okazaki. Wake up!

Tomoya:
What are you doing here?

Tomoyo:
What do you think?
I'm here to wake you up, of course!


--- OP ---

Tomoya:
Where's my dad?

Tomoyo:
I'm not sure.
He wasn't here when I showed up.

Tomoya:
Sorry you ended up making me breakfast.
I'm sure it was a pain.

Tomoyo:
I'm the one who should be sorry.
If I'd been more careful, then you wouldn't be in trouble right now.

Tomoya:
Don't say that.

Tomoyo:
I know it was your choice.
But I should have been suspended, not you.
Honestly, I'm still torn up about all this.
I appreciate what you did, but I can't help but feel like I should go to the office and tell them the truth.

Tomoya:
That's the last thing you should do.
Like I said, no matter what else happens, you have to be elected student council president.

Tomoyo:
For the Drama Club, right?
But still, even if I would...
Oh...

Naoyuki:
Oh, what have we here?

Tomoyo:
Oh, good morning, sir!
Why don't you sit down and have breakfast with us?

Naoyuki:
That would be nice.
We haven't had a real breakfast like this in quite a while.
Thank you very much.
Here, I'll sit down next to Tomoya.

Tomoya:
Thanks for the food.
It was good.

Tomoyo:
Okazaki, wait! What's wrong?



第18回 逆転の秘策 (The Secret Plan of Reversal)



Youhei:
You punks...

Tomoya:
Sunohara, wake up!

Youhei:
What do you want?
It's too early.

Tomoya:
A girl's here to confess her love to you.

Youhei:
Are you for real?
Woohoo!
Blast off!

Guy:
Hey, what the hell is that on your head?

Youhei:
Huh?

Tomoya:
The Rugby Club?

Guy:
What? Are you a panty thief?
Wait, those are boxers.
You freaking pervert!

Youhei:
Argh!

Tomoya:
Chance can be a scary thing.

Youhei:
So, is that your idea of fun?

Tomoya:
Pretty much.
Well, if nothing else, at least it woke you up.

Youhei:
Woke me up?
Are you kidding? That guy knocked me out!
Anyway, I'm about to head off to school.
You gonna stay here all day?

Tomoya:
Yeah, say hi to Kyou and the others for me.


Ryou:
I see. So he took the blame for Sakagami and was suspended.

Kyou:
Tomoya, why can't you take care of yourself?

Ryou:
Do you think Tomoya will be okay?
I mean, will he still be able to graduate after all this?

Kotomi:
I don't know, but I'm really worried.

Kyou:
The club leader's absent and Tomoya's suspended.
At this rate, how are we supposed to be in the school festival?

Tomoya:
It's already been three days.
Why is she the only thing I can think about?

Kyou:
Hi there! Have you been lonely without us?

Ryou:
I heard about what happened.
It's a real shame.

Tomoya:
I wasn't expecting you guys.

Kyou:
What does that mean?
Who were you expecting?

Tomoya:
Oh, no one, really.

Kyou:
You're under suspension.
Can you really go out like this?
Aren't you supposed to be staying at home?

Tomoya:
You say that, and yet you were the one who invited me in the first place.

Ryou:
By the way Kyou, where are we going?

Kyou:
It's a... good question.

Tomoya:
Wow, this thing's pretty cool.

Kyou:
Well, there's nothing else Ryou can get her fortune-telling fix.

Tomoya:
Here, now you enter your name.

Ryou:
Uh okay. Um, how do I...?

Tomoya:
Use this thing right here.

Ryou:
Ah, right!

Tomoya:
Wait, that's the symbol for male.

Ryou, Tomoya:
Ah.

Ryou:
What's our relationship?

Tomoya:
Well, let's see...

Ryou:
U-Um...

Kyou:
Come on, hurry it up!

Ryou:
Kyou, what are you...?

Kyou:
It says you're supposed to put your hands together when you play.

Ryou:
Sorry about this.

Tomoya:
It's all right, I don't mind.

Okay, there.

Ryou:
Ah...

Kyou:
Uh.
Come on! What's wrong with you?!

Tomoya:
Whoa! Hold on!
Damn it, Kyou! That hurt!

Kyou:
Oh, oh yeah?
Well that's what you get for ruining the mood!
You're supposed to pick "lover" not "friend."
Otherwise, it's not any fun.
Everyone knows that!

Kyou:
"A kind female and a male with a strong sense of responsibility."
"You will be very compatible friends."
"However, whether it develops beyond this is up to each individual."

Can't get any more generic than that, can you?

Tomoya:
Aren't all fortunes like that?
What'd you expect?

Ryou:
But still, I'm glad it didn't say we were totally imcompatible.
Hey, Kyou?

Kyou:
I have an errand to run, so I'm leaving.
Tomoya, make sure Ryou gets home safe?

Tomoya:
Hey!

Tomoya:
You're really into that fortune-telling stuff, huh?

Ryou:
I think girls are genetically predisposed to be interested in fortune-telling.

Tomoya:
Yeah, too bad your fortune-telling is so...
No, I mean...

Ryou:
He he. It's okay.
I know I'm bad at it.

Tomoya:
Wait, you know you're bad?

Ryou:
I have to admit, I'm still a little disappointed sometimes.
But in the end, I think it actually works out better this way.

Tomoya:
Why's that?

Ryou:
Mmhm!
If a prediction is right, then it's like you only have one future.
Like that future has been decided.
But if it's wrong, then you have an almost infinite number of possibilities.
And that means that even the tiniest twist of fate can change your future.
I want to believe that I have choices - that the path I walk has many different turns, and many different roads to follow!


Tomoya:
You don't have to come here on Sundays too.

Tomoyo:
If I wanna come here on Sunday, then it's my choice.

Tomoya:
Where's my dad?

Tomoyo:
He went out a little while ago.
I guess you don't get along with him very well, do you?
I'm... I'm sorry, that's none of my business, is it?

Tomoya:
How's the student council campaign going?
It's almost election day, right?

Tomoyo:
It's going well. Don't worry.

Kyou:
Morning, Tomoya!
Thought you might appreciate a little snack!

Botan:
Puhi~! Puhi~!

Tomoya:
Thank you.

Ryou:
I'm sorry, but my sister insisted on coming.

Tomoya:
Oh, yeah, well, whatever.

Tomoyo:
Okazaki, what's going on?
Visitors?

Kyou:
It's you?!

Kotomi:
Tomoya.
Oh, hi Kyou. Hi Ryou.
It's a lovely morning, isn't it?

Ryou:
No offense, Kotomi, but what are you doing here?

Kotomi:
I thought Tomoya must be hungry with no one to cook for him.
So I thought I would stop by and bring him some lunch.

Kyou, Ryou:
Ah...

Kotomi:
Why does everyone looks so gloomy now?

Botan:
Puhi~!

Tomoya:
N-No offense, but there's no way I can eat all this food.

Kyou:
Ryou and I got up at 5 AM to prepare this.
You will eat it now, won't you?

Tomoyo:
Since I'm the reason Okazaki was suspended,
I'm the only one involved.
It's my duty to take care of his food...

Kyou:
What do you mean "only one involved"?
Are you trying to say we have nothing to do with this?

Tomoyo:
To be perfectly blunt, no you don't.
As far as this incident is concerned, you're all outsiders.

Kyou:
We've known Okazaki since his junior year, and are you saying the Drama Club doesn't count for anything?

Tomoyo:
Time and titles don't determine the strength of someone's friendship.

Kyou:
Ugh...

Tomoya:
N-Now, come on, you guys. There's no need to get so riled up.

Kyou, Tomoyo:
It's because you won't make up your mind!

Tomoya:
But that would be even worse!
Fujibayashi, please say something to these two.

Ryou:
Tomoya... I want you to eat my cooking as well!

Tomoya:
Argh!

Botan:
Puhi~!

Tomoya:
Uh, Kotomi...

Kotomi:
Yes, Tomoya?

Tomoya:
Kotomi...

Kotomi:
You know I started prepping last night, so I put a lot of work into cooking all this.

Tomoya:
Ahh...

Fuko:
Fuko has arrived!

Kyou:
Who the hell are you?

Fuko:
I brought my home cooking for you to eat, too.
Leave it to me!
My food will make everything better, Okazaki.

Tomoya:
No, seriously, stop!

Fuko:
Of course, I understand how you must feel.
But unfortunately, my home cooking is the only choice for you, Okazaki!
Starfish pastries! Starfish cupcakes! Starfish cream puffs!

Kyou:
That's gross...

Ryou:
Okazaki, please eat my box lunch. I made it just for you!

Kotomi:
You won't let my work go to waste, will you?

Tomoyo:
Make up your mind already!

Kyou:
Take my food or else!

Botan:
Puhi~! Puhi~!

Fuko:
Mine is the obvious choice, Okazaki!

Botan:
Puhi~!

Fuko:
The obvious choice!

Youhei:
Greetings, Captain!
Congratulations and welcome back!

Tomoya:
Go easy on me, okay?
I ate way too much yesterday and I feel like I'm gonna puke.

Youhei:
Hate to say it, but this is no time to be sitting on your ass and complaining.
Tomoyo's in big trouble right now.

Tomoya:
Huh?

Girl:
Is that true?

Boy:
I don't know, but I heard she was in a gang before she came here.

Boy:
Just the other day, some punks from another school came to pick a fight with her.

Boy:
Are you sure? I thought they were after Okazaki.

Boy:
I wonder...

Boy:
Shut up! He's standing right there.

Youhei:
We have it.
So, what's the plan?


Boy:
Huh? You wanna have a match?

Tomoya:
Yeah, and if we lose, we'll pick up balls for you. Or clean your uniforms, or whatever you like.

Boy:
Just wait here a sec.
I'll see what the team thinks.

Youhei:
You think you can clean up her image with a baseball game?

Tomoya:
If playing basketball works, then why not?
Just trust me on this one.

Tomoyo:
All right, but I'll warn you.
The most I've ever done is play catch.

Tomoya:
Don't worry, okay?
We have an ace up our sleeve.
Our buddy Sunohara there is an athletic wonder!

Tomoyo:
Now I'm really worried.

Boy:
Okazaki!

Tomoyo:
Huh?

Boy:
It's a deal.
We only have one condition:
If you guys lose the game, then Sakagami will have to join the girl's softball team.

Tomoyo:
Then we'll do it.


C L A N N A D
－クラナド－


Tomoya:
Tomoyo! All we need is three outs to take this.
But try to be careful, 'cause if they get a base hit, we're finished.

Tomoyo:
Right! I'll give it my best shot!

Boy:
Come on, give me a pitch!

Boy:
Hey, you okay over there?

Youhei:
This is bad.
Argh, what the hell do you think you're doing, Tomoyo?!

Tomoyo:
Shut up! You're distracting me!

Youhei:
What are you afraid of?!
I might catch the ball or something?
Start throwing strikes!
Watch it guys, pitcher's wild!

Tomoya:
Calm down, Tomoyo.

Tomoyo:
But Sunohara's bugging me and I can't concentrate!

Tomoya:
Then try throwing the ball straight in his annoying little face - like you're gonna smash it and knock his teeth out.

Tomoyo:
Straight at his face?

Youhei:
Come on, you couldn't even pitch a tent!

Tomoyo:
All right, here goes nothing.

Youhei:
I've seen better arms on a bean bag chair!

What? Argh!

Ump:
Eh, uh... strike!

Boy:
Huh?!

Youhei:
Argh! Argh! Argh!

Ump:
Strike! You're out!

Tomoyo:
That felt good!

Tomoya:
That's great, Tomoyo! We won!

Tomoyo:
Huh?

Boy:
Did you hear about what happened with Tomoyo?
She challenged the baseball team to a game and won!

Girl:
Wow, that's awesome!
She's good at everything, isn't she?

Girl:
Look! She's right over there!

Girl:
Tomoyo!


Tomoyo:
Thanks to you, all those nasty rumors about me have finally been cleared up.
I'm grateful.

Tomoya:
Don't mention it.
I'm just doing it for the Drama Club after all.

Tomoyo:
I still appreciate it though.
Now it looks like my dream might actually come true!

Tomoya:
What dream?

Tomoyo:
Oh, yeah. Guess I haven't mentioned it to you yet, huh?
I wanna protect these cherry trees, no matter what.

Tomoya:
Huh?

Tomoyo:
They're planing to cut them all down.
Students who know about it are really sad.
The neighborhood is also opposed to the plan.
If I become the next student council president, then hopefully I can start a movement to save the cherry trees.

Tomoya:
Wait a sec. Are you telling me that was the only reason you transferred to this school?

Tomoyo:
Mm-hm.
This place holds special memories for me.
That's why I have to protect it.
Okazaki, what were you like in the past?

Tomoya:
Average, I guess.

Tomoyo:
I was... a rebel.
Why do we rebel?
Or if you wanna look at it the other way, what is it that stops people from rebelling?

Tomoya:
Hm?
Maybe talent?
'Cause if you're talented, it's obvious what you should do with yourself.
You have a path to follow, you know?

Tomoyo:
Good answer.
But what if you can't find your talent?

Tomoya:
Maybe... love?

Tomoyo:
I see.
I think that one's a good answer too.
But in my case, the answer that I found is family.
For the sake of your family, you try to restrain yourself.

Tomoya:
That might be true for some people.
But what if your family is the reason you rebel in the first place?

Tomoyo:
When I say "family," I don't necessarily mean your real family.
It could be your friends instead.
All that matters is that you have something like a family to support you.
Of course I... I don't expect everyone to feel the same way, but this is the answer I've found for myself at least.
Growing up, my parents never seemed to get along.
There wasn't even an ounce of warmth between them.
There was nothing at all.
They didn't even bother to fight.
Neither of them were to blame.
It's just that as time went on, the whole misunderstandings turned into big grudges and before they realized it, their relationship had fallen apart.
Back then, I used to rebel all the time.
I took out my anger and frustration on anyone I could find.
I was such a weak person.
But finally, someone opened my eyes.
It was my little brother.
He was always quiet and reserved.
But if you got to know him, he was very kind-hearted.
He was a good kid. But I was a bad sister to him.
When I think back on it, I never once seen him smile.
Two years ago, my parents reached their breaking point and decided to get a divorce.
As a result, my brother and I were locked in a bitter custody battle.
I was ready for the whole ordeal to be over, so I didn't carry their way.
But he was still young, and couldn't deal with it.
He put his foot down and refused to go with either of them.
It was the first time he had ever spoken up about the whole situation.
And then...

Tomoya:
...he jumped?

Tomoyo:
Yeah.
He said if my parents were going to get a divorce, he would jump off a bridge.
And he did.
To this day, I can't really say why he did it.
It's not that he wanted to die or anything.
The truth is, I doubt even he understood why he jumped.
But regardless of the reason, because of what he did, we were able to become a real family for the first time.
All the distance that we had put between each other suddenly seemed to disappear.
Fortunately, my brother survived the incident.
And in the spring, he was released from the hospital.
That was when we first walked down this path.
I still remember what he said that day: "I wanna see the cherry blossoms every year as a family!"
Of course, I felt the same way. And so did my parents.
This town is always changing.
But there are still a lot of people here who cherish these cherry trees and don't wanna see them go.
I'm not the only one.
And even if our reasons are different, our feelings are the same.
No matter how cold and distant people may become, on the inside, something warm and precious always remains.
Something that never changes.
To me, that's what family is like.


Kyou:
Nagisa! Wow, welcome back!

Nagisa:
Heh he.

Ryou:
Oh, I'm so happy to see you again.

Kotomi:
I'm so glad you're finally feeling better.

Nagisa:
I'm sorry I made you all worry.
Okazaki?

Tomoya:
Huh? Wh-What's up?

Nagisa:
Sorry about what happened.
I heard about the big fight, and how you let yourself get suspended so Sakagami could win the election.
I... I don't know how to make it up to you.

Tomoya:
Ah, it's fine.
It's not like I did it just for you.
I did it for everyone in the Drama Club.

Kyou:
Geez, when you put it that way, it's like saying you guys really owe me big time.

Tomoya:
Ah... No, I...
Anyway, it's all over now.
But if you wanna take responsibility, you can go help Tomoyo in her match today.

Nagisa:
Oh, right!


Guy:
One-set match.
If I win, then you join the Tennis Club.

Tomoyo:
It's a deal.
Let's do our best.

Youhei:
It'd be hotter if she was playing another girl!

Nagisa:
I'm worried.
Do you think Sakagami will be okay?

Kyou:
Didn't think so many people would come to watch.

Ryou:
Ah! Okazaki...

Tomoya:
Yeah, that's it! Yes!

Ryou:
Kyou, hold on!
Just... wait until the match ends.

Tomoya:
You're looking good.
You can take it.

Tomoyo:
Thanks.

Nagisa:
Um, Sakagami?
I brought some water. Would you like a drink?

Tomoyo:
Not right now. Thanks though.
Wait a sec, we've met before. Haven't we?

Nagisa:
I'm Nagisa Furukawa.
I'm trying to organize the Drama Club.

Tomoyo:
Drama Club?
Oh, I see...
So that's how it is.

Tomoya:
Hm?

Nagisa:
Huh?

Tomoyo:
No, it's nothing.
Here I go!


Tomoya:
Nagisa!

Youhei:
Nagisa!

Ryou:
Huh?

Tomoya:
Are you okay?

Ryou:
Nagisa?

Tomoya:
Are you all right? Nagisa?

Nagisa:
Yeah, I'm okay.
More importantly, Sakagami just won a point, right?
Ow!

Guy:
That looks bad.
Come on, the nurse can...

Tomoyo:
Ah...

Nagisa:
O-Okazaki...?

Tomoya:
Let's go see the nurse.

Nagisa:
Oh, right. Okay.

Tomoya:
Try to take it slow.

Nagisa:
Right.

Kyou:
Well, it's not like we didn't know!

Ryou:
Kyou...

Kyou:
Hm?

Ryou:
Kyou, I... I-I'm sorry.
Thank you... for everything!

Kyou:
No, I...

Ryou:
I'm so sorry...
I'm so sorry...
