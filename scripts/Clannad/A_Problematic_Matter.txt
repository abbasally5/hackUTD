  "I":
Once again, a new light is born.
Some time long ago - or perhaps some time in the distant future - I was in a different world.
That single sensation is all I remember.

The girl:
A different world?
What kind of a place was it?
Do you remember?
Do you think it was a better place than this?

"I":
I think so.

The girl:
Even if the world wasn't empty, did you still feel lonely sometimes?

"I":
Probably.

The girl:
Were you ever as lonely as you are now?

"I":
A girl living alone in a world that has ended.
An empty and still world.
This was a place that had nothing; that was void of all happiness.
Perhaps, that is why I was born.

The girl:
Was this your wish?
Did you want to be born into a world like this?


- OP -


Tomoya:
Lend her your name?

Youhei:
Yeah. All she needs is numbers, right?
I'm not interested in acting, but I don't mind if she puts me down as a member.
I bet Nagisa's gonna be real grateful if I'm helping out.
And one day, that gratitude will turn into love!
Hey, Nagisa! I've got a big surprise for ya!

Kyou:
Guess what?
Ryou and I have decided to lend our names to the Drama Club.
Isn't that great?
To tell you the truth, I'm not really interested in acting.
But I wanna help you guys get the club approved.

Ryou:
Now the club has four members.
That's enough for the student council to offically recognize us.

Nagisa:
I don't know, guys.
Don't you feel kind of guilty for trying to trick the student council like this?

Kyou:
Don't be so uptight!

Tomoya:
Come on, Nagisa. Everyone's trying to help you out.
You're not gonna let all that go to waste, are you?

Kyou:
Now that we've made up our mind, let's get this show on the road!
Forward march!

Tomoya:
Come on, Nagisa! Toughen up a little.

Kyou:
Hurry up, Tomoya!

Tomoya:
Yes, ma'am.

Nagisa:
Okay...


第15回 困った問題 (A Problematic Matter)


Koumura:
Oh, I see.
So, you'd like to start up the Drama Club again?

Kyou:
Yes, we'd like to take part in the School Festival.

Tomoya:
We have enough members.
Now all we need is an advisor and the student council will recognize us as a real club.

Nagisa:
We're desperate.
Will you please be our advisor, sir?

Koumura:
Hmm...
Well, there's a junior at this school named Rie Nishina that you need to settle things with first.

Ryou:
Rie Nishina, huh?

Kotomi:
You mean the same Rie Nishina who lent us the violin?


Rie:
Oh, Ichinose.

Kotomi:
Hello, Nishina. Nice to see you.

Rie:
I haven't seen you in a while.
Do you need something?

Kotomi:
No, I'm fine, actually.
But my friend Nagisa here needs to talk to you.

Nagisa:
Hi, I'm Nagisa Furukawa from class 3-B.
Um... but, to tell you the truth, I'm not exactly sure what's going on either.
Sorry, but if you don't mind, can I talk to her alone for a sec?
I mean, I'm sure Nishina and her friends don't feel comfortable with all these seniors barging in all of a sudden.


Tomoya:
How did it go, Nagisa?

Nagisa:
Oh, well, you see...

Sugisaka:
What are you going to do, Rie?
Remember, we were the ones who approached Mr. Koumura first, so you don't need to back down if you don't want to.

Rie:
Yeah, but Mr. Koumura was originally the advisor to the Drama Club.
Also, this is the last chance for the seniors to form a club before they graduate.

Sugisaka:
Yeah, but what'll happen to the Choir Club?!
Don't tell me you're gonna just give up singing because of something stupid like this!

Rie:
Of course not.
But why don't we try to come up with a solution where everyone can be happy?
Okay?


Kotomi:
Choir Club?

Nagisa:
Yeah. Nishina and her friends said they wanna form a Choir Club, and the problem is they've already asked Mr. Koumura to be their advisor.

Tomoya:
Isn't that kind of weird though?
I mean, isn't the advisor of choir usually a music teacher?

Ryou:
Well, usually. But in this case, I heard the music teacher has her hands full with the brass band.
And unfortunately, Mr. Koumura is the only teacher on campus who isn't already an advisor.

Kyou:
What a pain.
So, what's the plan now?
Come on, don't tell me you're gonna give up without a fight, Nagisa.


Misae:
Is Sunohara here?

Tomoya:
Actually, he hasn't come back yet.

Misae:
Well, he has a call from his little sister.
If you're not busy, you think you could talk to her and pass the message on?

Tomoya:
Oh, that's right.
He does have a little sister, doesn't he?
Well, if she takes after her brother, she's probably like...
"Hi, Youhei, it's me!"
Scary, huh? Like something out of a horror flick.

Misae:
Would you mind not scaring my cat?

Mei:
Wh..What?!

Tomoya:
I guess she speaks human language after all.

Mei:
Hello? Was that you, Youhei?

Tomoya:
Yeah, that's right.
I'm your brother, Youhei Sunohara, the biggest stain in an otherwise picturesque existence.

Mei:
What are you talking about?

Tomoya:
Guess nothing phases her, huh?

Mei:
Anyway, I was thinking about coming to visit you the day after tomorrow if that's okay?


Tomoya:
Sorry, Sis.
But I'm actually in jail right now.
I messed up and got arrested.
Better luck next time.

Mei:
There you go again, trying to avoid me.
I'm coming for sure.
What do you want me to bring you?

Tomoya:
A Dogu statue?

Mei:
Do you really want something like that?

Tomoya:
Yeah, totally.

Mei:
Well, if you're sure that's what you want, then I'll bring you one.

Tomoya:
Wait, hold on a second.
This is fun and all.
But you really can't tell, I'm not your...

Mei:
Ah, Mom's calling, I'd better go!
Remember the day after tomorrow, okay?
See you then!

Tomoya:
Hey, w-wait?! Hello?!
Oh, heck...
Well, what's done is done.


Youhei:
Man! I can't believe you guys had the nerve to go home without me.
When I came to, the school was empty and all the lights were off.
I was hungry so I was about to go home, but then I found out the gate was locked.

Tomoya:
Hm?

Youhei:
Hey, Okazaki, you listening?

Youhei:
Hey, Nagisa! Whatchu reading?
Don't tell me, it's a love letter.
Let's see...
"Forget the Drama Club and quit while you're ahead before you get hurt."

Tomoya:
They sent your threat?

Nagisa:
I came back to class after P.E. and found it stuffed inside my desk.
But I have no idea who put it there.

Youhei:
Well it's gotta be the Choir Club, since they're the ones you're having the whole advisor dispute with.

Nagisa:
No way, you can't just blame it on them when you don't even have any proof!
Nishina wouldn't...
Rie and her friends wouldn't do something like that!
They just wanna be able to sing together, that's all!
They're not bad people at all! I just know it!
I mean, they lent the violin to Kotomi and everything, so they can't be bad.

Youhei:
Guess we'll just have to find out.

Tomoya:
You got something in mind?

Youhei:
I have a way of finding out the truth.
I'll have a report for you by the end of day, so look forward to it, all right?

Tomoya:
Hey, hold on a sec!

Youhei:
Don't worry, I won't rough 'em up or anything.
I don't make it a habit of picking on girls.

Nagisa:
It just doesn't seem right.
You don't think Nishina would do something like that, do you?

Youhei:
Turns out it was someone from the Choir Club, after all.
A girl named Sugisaka.

Tomoya:
Do you have proof that it was her?

Youhei:
One of her classmates caught her in the act.
They said they saw her walk into a senior classroom and put something inside one of the desks.
I wouldn't lie about something like that.

Youhei:
Oh, look! Here's our criminal right now!
Guess she's punctual if nothin' else.
So you came alone! I'm impressed!

Sugisaka:
It was my idea.
I decided to send the letter on my own.
Nishina didn't have anything to do with it.
I take full responsibility

Youhei:
You girls are seriously out of touch with reality, aren't you?
Do you honestly think we're gonna buy the whole selfless sacrifice routine?

Tomoya:
Sunohara, wait!

Nagisa:
Please let me handle this!
I met you yesterday in the music room with Nishina.
Can we please talk this over?

Sugisaka:
You might not have heard, but Nishina's been playing the violin ever since she was a little girl.
She's done recitals, won competitions and everything.
Eventually, people started to recognize her talent.
And she decided she wanted to study abroad.
But then something unthinkable happened.
She had an accident.
After that, her grip got weaker.
She tried to play but she just couldn't do it the way she used to.
It was after that when she came to this school.
She was always so sad.
And that's the reason we formed a Choir Club, because we didn't want her to give up!
Maybe she can't play the violin anymore, but she can still sing!
Nishina's a really great singer too!
I'm begging you, please don't take that away from her!

Nagisa:
I...

Youhei:
Don't listen to that crap, Nagisa!
People who try to get your sympathy with sob stories like that are nothing but cowards!
You think people should just get their way because they have a handicap...
It's not that easy!

Tomoya:
Sunohara...

Youhei:
Handicap my ass! Ugh!

Nagisa:
I don't wanna hurt Nishina and her friends.

Youhei:
But you haven't done anything wrong!
Just forget about what she said and move on!

Nagisa:
I can't!
Because now I know the truth.
The Choir Club isn't like us.
They're actually serious about music and singing.
But the Drama Club is...
Listen, Sugisaka. I'll give up on the Drama Club.

Sugisaka:
Furukawa, I...

Nagisa:
So tell Nishina I want her to make the Choir Club the best she can!

Tomoya:
Sunohara!

Tomoya:
Sunohara is just like me.
He was recruited by a school sports team, but was forced to quit partway through the season.

Nagisa:
He never said anything.

Tomoya:
He used to be on the soccer team.
But after he got a big fight with one of the upperclassmen, the coach forced him to quit the team.
Now he's just like me.
All he and I ever do these days is just sit around and waste time.

Nagisa:
I really had no idea...

Tomoya:
I know how he feels.
It's hard to just give up on something you've wanted for so long.
That's probably why he can't forgive people who take advantage of something like a disability.
Nagisa, are you really sure this is what you want?

Nagisa:
Okazaki?

Tomoya:
What is it?

Nagisa:
Even if this is where it all ends, I had so much fun working together with you.
We may not have been able to start up the Drama Club like we wanted.
But along the way, I feel like I found so many things that are more important than that.
After all, you and I became good friends because of all this.
And now, Kyou and Ryou, Kotomi and Sunohara are all my friends too.
To tell you the truth, I never thought that someone like me could come this far in life.
I owe it all to you, Okazaki.

Tomoya:
Don't say that. I haven't done anything.

Nagisa:
Now you're just being modest.

Tomoya:
No, you've just gotten stronger.
You're not the same girl I met at the bottom of the hill.
You may be a crybaby and you may be clumsy, but you still made it this far.
That's why I think you've gotten stronger.

Nagisa:
But if you weren't here with me, I don't think I could've done anything.

I'm sorry. I was trying not to cry...

Tomoya:
Nagisa...


Kyou:
Hey, you two!
Youhei told me what happened!
You got pulled into some stupid sob story from the Choir Club and gave up Mr. Koumura as an advisor!
Why can't you stand up for yourself for once?!
If you keep giving in to every little demand like that, you'll never make your dreams come true!

Youhei:
This just doesn't seem right to me.
If Nagisa's too kind-hearted, then I'll just have to take out the Choir Club with my own two fists.

Tomoya:
You gotta be kidding me.
You really think doing that will make Nagisa happy?

Youhei:
Ahh! This sucks!
Come on, Okazaki! Let's go blow off some steam!

Tomoya:
Normally, I'd say yes, but I just emptied out my savings trying to fix up Kotomi's yard.


Yukine:
It's good to see you here again, Okazaki.

Youhei:
Hold on a second. What's going on here?

Tomoya:
The coffee taste's great.
It's always nice and quiet and everything's free.
Not a bad hangout, huh?

Yukine:
By the way, my name is Yukine Miyazawa.
I guess you could say I'm the keeper of the second library here at school.

Youhei:
Isn't that kind of pointless?
I mean, why would you wanna have a library full of books nobody reads?

Yukine:
Well, just because people don't read them doesn't mean they aren't interesting.
Take this one for example.
I love reading people's horoscopes.
Why don't you tell me your sign, Sunohara?
Let's see what the stars have in store for you.

Youhei:
If you can use that thing to tell the future, why don't you tell me how to get the advisor from the Choir Club?

Yukine:
It says here that orange is your lucky color.
Your lucky word for this month is basketball.

Tomoya:
Basketball's lucky, huh?

Youhei:
Sounds like you're reading Okazaki fortune instead of mine.

Yukine:
You are a kind person who cares for his friends.
Those around you are touched by the earnestness of your actions.
While you may feel that your efforts are made in vain.
In actuality, many people are moved by your will to challenge the impossible.

Youhei:
Will to challenge the impossible, huh?
Lucky word is basketball?
Ah, that's it!

Tomoya:
Hey, Sunohara!

Youhei:
Later, Okazaki!


Tomoya:
That idiot, what's he up to now?

Tomoyo:
I don't care how many times you ask me!

Girl:
Please don't say that!
Come on, Sakagami. You gotta join the women's Judo Club!

Guy:
As captain of the men's Judo Club, I'd like to second her request.
If you join, then our women's club will become a national contender.

Tomoyo:
I've told you a thousand times, I'm not interested.

Tomoya:
Hi, Tomoyo. Looks like you're as popular as ever.

Tomoyo:
Okazaki, help me out here.
These guys won't leave me alone.

Girl:
Just come and watch us practice, okay?!

Guy:
Just for today, that's all I ask!

Girl:
Please, I'm begging you!

Tomoyo:
I can't! I have things to do!

Tomoya:
Hey...

Fuko:
Fuko-chan at your service!
Sakagami, for coming to my sister's wedding, I owe you a debt of gratitude.
Now allow me to be of service in your time of need.
I have no choice but to summon the power of my ultimate technique, the Starfish Heat.
Prepare yourself!!
But wait! You two from the Judo Club also came to my sister's wedding.
That's no good!
Uh, forgive me.
In a case like this, I can't take either side.
Still I would like to appear again some day!
Until then, thanks a lot.

Tomoyo:
You mind telling me what that was about?

Tomoya:
Your guess is as good as mine.

Girl:
Anyway, please come to our practice!

Guy:
Just give us a chance, you'll see!

Tomoya:
All right, you two. That's enough.

Guy:
Who the heck are you?

Tomoya:
Let's go, Tomoyo.

Tomoyo:
Right.


Tomoyo:
I'm impressed.
When push comes to shove, you don't back down.

Tomoya:
You don't have to make such a big deal out of it.

Tomoyo:
But this is the Judo Club we're talking about, and not just members either.
Those two were the team captains.
You really weren't scared at all?

Tomoya:
I'm used to people hating me.
Don't worry about it.

Tomoyo:
If you hadn't come, they might have kept pestering me until I joined.
The thing is, I don't have any interest in judo. And I'm going to be busy with the student council election soon, anyway.

Tomoya:
In that case, I wish you luck in the election.
If you were president, it'd be a lot easier to reestablish the Drama Club.
Hm? Is something wrong?

Tomoyo:
Oh, no. I was just thinking you were a nice guy, that's all.


Nagisa:
Really, so you haven't seen him since he ran off yesterday?

Tomoya:
Yeah, he didn't come back to the dorm until really late at night.
Knowing him, he was probably up to no good.

Nagisa:
Oh...

Youhei:
About time you showed up!


Nagisa:
Challenge the basketball team?

Tomoya:
Hold on a sec!
What made you come up with a crazy idea like that?
Youhei:
Remember what Yukine told us yesterday?
Many people are moved by my will to challenge the impossible.
And that my lucky word this month is basketball!
In other words, if we play a game of basketball against the school team and win, then I can prove my point to those crybabies from the Choir Club.
I wanna show them that handicaps don't matter.
And then, just like the horoscope said, they'll be so moved by my actions, they'll give up their advisor!

Tomoya:
That kind of harebrained plan might work in an after-school special or something.
But I doubt anyone would actually fall for it.

Youhei:
Listen.
I know you can't shoot, but if you're the point guard you should do fine!
Come on!

Tomoya:
I don't have time for this.
Let's go, Nagisa.

Youhei:
Hey, Okazaki! Wait!


Nagisa:
I feel kind of bad.
Was it okay to leave Sunohara behind like that?

Tomoya:
Don't take it seriously.
He's always freaking out about stuff like this.

Nagisa:
But I feel bad for ignoring him, because he's doing all this for me.

Tomoya:
I guess it's kind out of character for him to help people out.

Youhei:
Okazaki! Let's play basketball!
Hey, Okazaki. Let's play basketball!
Oh, come on, Okazaki!
Let's play!
Come on, let's play?
You know you wanna do it!

Tomoya:
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt, but Sunohara's disrupting my studies.

Youhei:
Ugh!

Youhei:
Wait up, Okazaki!

Nagisa:
Oh, hi, Okazaki.
Let's go to the club...

Tomoya:
Run away!

Nagisa:
Ah!

Tomoya:
Good! He won't be able to find us here.

Nagisa:
Who won't be able to find us?
You aren't running away from Sunohara, are you?

Tomoya:
It's nothing, forget about it.

Nagisa:
But...

Tomoya:
All right, I'll tell you the truth.

Nagisa:
Uh-huh.

Tomoya:
He's just using this whole basketball thing as an excuse to spend time with me.

Nagisa:
An excuse?

Tomoya:
That's right.
I didn't wanna tell you this, but the truth is he really likes me.
He's totally in love with me.

Youhei:
Okazaki...

Nagisa:
Huh?!

Tomoya:
Lately, I've been too wrapped up in other things to pay much attention to him, so he keeps cooking up all these ridiculous plans to bring us closer together.
I guess it's kind of pathetic in a way, if you think about it.

Nagisa:
B-But if he loves you so much, maybe you should consider his feelings.

Tomoya:
It's not his fault.
But unfortunately, I'm just not into guys.
And since I can't return his love, the sooner he gives up on me, the less heartbreak he'll suffer in the end.

Nagisa:
Oh, I see...
That's so nice of you to consider his feelings like that.

Tomoya:
I'm glad you understand.

Tomoya:
Ahh! There he is!

Youhei:
Finally caught up with you!
Okazaki, why are you running away like that?
You're so...

Nagisa:
Um, I'm sorry, but you shouldn't...
I mean, Okazaki doesn't like that, so you have to respect that.

Youhei:
What do you mean?
Okazaki and I are good friends.
What's the big deal?

Nagisa:
Oh, I know.
But even with friends, there's a line you can't cross.
So I'm afraid you're just gonna have to give up!

Youhei:
I can't give up!
I need him more than anything!
If I don't have him, then all of this is pointless!

Nagisa:
No, you can't!
You can't because...
That's right. Because Okazaki is my boyfriend!

Tomoya, Youhei:
Argh!

Nagisa:
Wh-What I mean is, no matter much you care for him, I can't let you take Okazaki from me.
So, um...

Tomoya:
Is she trying to protect me?

Youhei:
So, that's it...
Since when?
How could you!? Argh!

Tomoya:
Ah, uh...
Hey...

Nagisa:
I'm sorry!
I just wanted to protect you, so out of the blue, I told this ridiculous lie.
But I didn't think he would react like that.

Tomoya:
Oh, no, uh...
Actually thanks. That made me happy.

Nagisa:
Huh?

Mei:
Uh, excuse me...
That boy running away. Do you know if that was Youhei Sunohara?

Nagisa:
And who are you?

Mei:
My name's Mei Sunohara.
I'm Youhei's little sister.

Nagisa:
Uh...

Tomoya:
Ah!

Mei:
He he.
