  Tomoya:
Furukawa, won't Sanae and your dad be worried that you're gone this late at night?

Nagisa:
Oh, you don't need to worry, Okazaki.
I told my parents that I was going to be with Fu-chan tonight.

Tomoya:
Really? How did your dad react to that?

Nagisa:
When he heard Fu-chan's name, it looked like he might remember something again.
So I guess that he hasn't forgotten everything about her after all.


- OP -

第9回 夢の最後まで (Until the End of the Dream)


Nagisa:
If we're discovered, we'll be scolded I guess.

Tomoya:
We'll just worry about that when it happens.
Hey, you're being little hasty, aren't you?

Fuko:
But I just can't wait anymore!

Tomoya:
I swear you're such a little kid.

Fuko:
I'm not little, I'm just short.
Inside, I'm more adult than you!

Tomoya:
But I can't believe I'm being told that by someone opening a toy like it's Christmas morning.

Fuko:
Even if my head knows it, I can't control what my hands do!
Uh?! Aaaaah...

Nagisa:
Okazaki?

Fuko:
Oh no... oh no! My hat is gone!
Where did it go?!

Tomoya:
It's over here.

Fuko:
Don't take my super special treasure away from me!

Tomoya:
If you're such an adult, then show some self-control.

Fuko:
I'm an adult, but I'm becoming a child momentarily!

Tomoya:
Oh!

Nagisa:
Fu-chan! Okazaki!

Fuko:
Give it back!

Tomoya:
Okay!

Nagisa:
Are you all right?

Fuko:
I was a child only for just now.
Please forgive me.

Tomoya:
Never mind, just hurry up and get off of me!
You're heavier than you look, you know that?
If you're the same age as me, then act like it.

Fuko:
You're much more of a child than I am.
Besides, if you were really an adult, you could call a close female friend by her first name.

Tomoya:
Please tell me how can you jump so far off the subject?

Fuko:
I'm just saying that Yusuke calls my sister by her first name.
And my big sister always calls him Yu-kun.
They're both very adult people.

Tomoya:
Yeah, yeah. I always call you Fuko, don't I?

Fuko:
I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about Nagisa.

Tomoya, Nagisa:
Huh?

Fuko:
You two seem very close to me, yet you both call each other by your last names a lot of the times.
It seems too distant.
I mean, if you're both adults, you should call each other by your first names.

Tomoya:
That is not very logical argument.

Nagisa:
No, it's not. This is too sudden for me to talk to you that way.

Fuko:
Well, then. It won't kill you if you both just try it, will it?
Okazaki, you use "chan", and Nagisa you can add "kun" to it.
Ready, set, go!

Tomoya:
Nagi... ugh...

Nagisa:
To..Tomoya-kun...

Tomoya:
Nagisa-chan...
How can I say that?!

Nagisa:
Oh, I agree with Okazaki.
This is unbearably embarrassing for me too!

Fuko:
See there?
That just proves that the two of you are more childish than me.

Tomoya:
Wait a minute!
At least let me drop the "chan", will ya?
That's the way I talk to Kyou and Tomoyo.

Fuko:
Then try it, why doncha there?

Tomoya:
Uh... Nagisa... uh...
This is easier.
It was a little bit easier, I guess.

Nagisa:
Yes, the same with me.
But I... I still need a little more time to be totally comfortable talking to you this way.

Fuko:
Let's compromise with that.

Tomoya:
Why are you acting so bossy all of a sudden?

Fuko:
Because I... because I like both you and Nagisa very much,
and I only want you to be very happy together.
Just like my sister and Yusuke are happy together.

Tomoya:
H-Hey...

Fuko:
He he...

Nagisa:
There you go, all done!

Fuko:
Does it look good on me? Does it look good?

Tomoya:
With that party hat on, you're the best in Japan.
No mistake about it!

Nagisa:
You look really adorable, Fu-chan.

Fuko:
Oh, you're embarrassing me!
I'm the best in Japan!

Tomoya:
I can't believe that you're in such high spirits already.
The wedding's the day after tomorrow, you know.

Fuko:
I wonder. Can we have an advance celebration?

Tomoya:
Advance celebration?

Nagisa:
You mean, for the wedding?

Tomoya:
The bride and groom aren't here.

Fuko:
Do they have to be here?

Nagisa:
No, I think it will be okay, Fu-chan.
Let's have a little celebration--just the three of us.

Tomoya:
You're right.
There are vending machines on the first floor.
There must be matches in the home economics room.

Fuko:
Wah! This is absolutely wonderful!

Tomoya:
I bet you'd just be happy to sit here all night with that hat on your head, you know that?

Fuko:
No, that's not the only thing that makes me happy!
All together now!
My dear sister, congratulations!

Tomoya:
Kouko, we wish you all the best!

Nagisa:
Miss Ibuki, congratulations on your big day!

Fuko:
Oh, dear. My ears are ringing!

Tomoya:
Fuko, you have tape in your hair.

Nagisa:
Oh, you too, Okazaki!

Tomoya:
Furu... No...
Nagisa, you too!

Nagisa:
Oh, yes...


Tomoya:
What's wrong, Fuko? Are you cold?

Nagisa:
Let's sit close together like oshikuramanju.
That way, it'll be a lot warmer for us.
We'll be the Big Dango Family!

Tomoya:
Sitting like this, we really are like one happy family.

Nagisa:
Yes, we are.

Tomoya:
Oh?

Nagisa:
Ah? Hm...


Tomoya:
Oh, Furukawa?
What's going on?
Why are we sleeping here on the floor?

Nagisa:
Okazaki?
Ah! This is...

Tomoya:
Wait a minute.
Did we spend the entire night here at school?

Nagisa:
It sure seems that way, doesn't it?

Tomoya:
So, I guess we were planning to get the Drama Club up and running again, and we fell asleep?

Nagisa:
Now that you mention it, I think that may be what happened.
But all this... this is strange...


Nagisa:
I'm sorry for staying out without permission!

Tomoya:
We fell a sleep by accident!

Argh!

Akio:
Do you think an excuse like that will pass?

Sanae:
Akio, no!

Nagisa:
Father, stop!

Akio:
I know that's what you told me.
And I really wanna believe you, but it's just so hard to swallow.
It's a little far-fetched.

Sanae:
Me too.

Nagisa:
Huh?

Sanae:
I seem to have heard you had something important to do and wouldn't be home today.
Yes, I distinctly remember.

Tomoya:
I don't suppose you remember what that was by any chance?

Sanae:
Strangely, I don't remember the details of what you two were doing.

Akio:
Argh! I have to say, this is really getting me aggravated!

Tomoya:
I'm not like your father, but I've been feeling hazy.
Like that something I can't remember is very important.

Nagisa:
Okazaki, look at this.

Tomoya:
Hm?
It was in the Drama Club room this morning.

Nagisa:
And there was one in my room as well.
Strangely, I don't remember where I could have received it, but...
When I look at it, I feel calmed.
When you look at it, don't you experience the same kind of feeling?


Kyou:
What are you doing looking so dazed?

Tomoya:
It's because I'm trying to remember something.

Kyou:
Remember something? Like what?

Tomoya:
Beats me. I just don't know what.

Kyou:
Oh.
So, you've got free time?
So why don't you come with me tomorrow?
I'm going shopping with my little sister.
Why not join us? It'll be fun!

Tomoya:
Tomorrow?
I feel like I have plans tomorrow.
But I don't know what they are.

Kyou:
What's with the vague answer?
Just say yes or no!

Tomoya:
I'm not trying to be vague.
But I just can't shake the feeling that there's really something going on tomorrow.
Something very important that I have to do...

- クラナド -


Tomoya:
Is that so?
You too?

Nagisa:
Yes, and I feel like that there's something important happening tomorrow.
But I can't remember what it is.

Tomoya:
There must be something to it.
Let's try to remember.

Nagisa:
Mr. Koumura, what are you doing with that brush and banner?

Koumura:
Can't you see for yourself?

Tomoya:
So, is someone you know getting married?

Koumura:
You sure ask strange things.
Don't tell me your memory is going bad at your age?

Tomoya:
Being told that by you is more than a little depressing.

Koumura:
Look at it closely and remember our discussion.

Tomoya:
I remember!

Nagisa:
Miss Ibuki!

Koumura:
It was because of your request that this wedding will be held at the school.

Tomoya:
That's right.
That's what it is.

Nagisa:
Oh, no!
We forgot something this important!

Tomoya:
Furukawa, I can't remember. Why did you and I wanna celebrate Kouko's marriage?

Koumura:
There you go saying strange things again!
It was because you have that kind of relationship with her, isn't it?

Nagisa:
If I remember correctly, wasn't I the one who introduced you to Miss Ibuki?
But I... somehow I feel like there was one more person who brought us together.
I'm just certain there was somebody else.

Tomoya:
There was another person...

Koumura:
Yes, it was Miss Ibuki's sister, wasn't it?

Tomoya:
Her sister?

Koumura:
Well, if you'll excuse me.

Nagisa:
Wait a minute.
Did he say Miss Ibuki's sister?
Ah!
It's Fuko!

Tomoya:
That's right! It was Fuko!

Nagisa:
Ah!

Tomoya:
You're here!

Nagisa:
Fu-chan!

Tomoya:
So, you... you were beside us all this time?

Fuko:
Yes...

Tomoya:
I'm the worst, aren't I?
I mean, it's the one thing I didn't wanna forget and I forgot it.

Fuko:
You're not the worst, Okazaki.
It's only natural.

Nagisa:
Oh, please Fuko. Don't say anything so sad!

Tomoya:
Oh, Fuko. We wanna be with you always.

Nagisa:
Fu-chan, let's stay together.
Until the wedding, be together always.

Fuko:
Yes!


Man:
It seems having the wedding at the school was the bride's request.

Nagisa:
None of the students are here to celebrate the big occasion.

Fuko:
But Okazaki and you are here to celebrate with me.

Minister:
The shape of the wedding ring has two meanings:
One is eternity. The other is completeness.
These two halves of one circle, forever intertwined, comprise the holy sacrament of marriage.
With the exchanging of the rings, you promise to be loyal to each other for the rest of your lives.
Repeat after me.
With this ring...
Yusuke:
...I pledge my eternal and undying love to you.
From now until death do us part.

Nagisa:
Okazaki, where are we going?

Tomoya:
Let's send them off with louder cheers than anyone!
Right, Fuko?

Fuko:
Yes!

Nagisa:
Okazaki, what is this?


Botan:
Puhi~! Puhi~! Puhi~!
Puhi~! Puhi~!

Tomoya:
Kyou... Fujibayashi...
I thought you told me that you were going shopping this afternoon?

Botan:
Puhi~! Puhi~!

Kyou:
Well, that's what we had planned. But then...

Ryou:
This morning, when we got up and saw this "reminder star," we remembered the wedding.
We felt that we just had to come to congratulate them.

Youhei:
Hey there!

Tomoya:
Sunohara!

Nagisa:
You came after all, didn't you?

Youhei:
Well, I had a little time on my hands.
Looks like all these other guys did too!

Nagisa:
Father! And Mother!

Akio:
Well, look at this!
You're here too! I should've known.

Sanae:
Really! To forget about a beautiful wedding until the very day of it.
I must have been crazy!

Tomoya:
Your thoughts reached them.
They all remembered.
Everyone remembered the wedding.

Fuko:
Oh, I just can't believe it.

Tomoya:
Isn't it super?

Fuko:
Yes!


Fuko:
Okazaki?

Tomoya:
Mm?

Fuko:
That dream about you that I mentioned before...

Tomoya:
Dream?

Fuko:
Do you remember it?
The dream about the Starfish Festival.
As I played alone on the beach, you pulled my hand.
You said, "What are you doing?"
"Today is the Starfish Festival, you know."
Ever since I met you and Nagisa, that's what it's been like.
You always took me to fun places.
Every day was like a festival.
It's been a lot of fun.
Thank you very much.
I had a lot of fun.
The most fun I've ever had in my life.


Kouko:
Okazaki? Nagisa?

Tomoya:
Kouko...

Kouko:
Is something wrong?
You both seem so sad.

Tomoya:
You have to listen my story.
There was someone who waited so long for this day.
Someone who worked so hard just for this day.
She lived and dreamed just for this day and it was all that kept her going
All alone, she gathered blessings for you and your fiance.
We loved her.
Because we truly loved her...

Kouko:
I see it so clearly now.
You and Nagisa were always with her, weren't you, Okazaki?

Tomoya:
It was because she and I enjoyed spending time with her.
We were happy together.
Don't you see, everyone here felt the same way.
So, Miss Kouko, please...
It's all we want, Kouko! To be happy for your sister Fuko!

Kouko:
Yes!

Fuko:
Congratulations, my dear big sister.
Please be happy. Please be happy forever!
Forever and always, be happy in your love!

Kouko:
Oh, my dear Fu-chan...


Kouko:
Fu-chan said, "Congratulations."
"Please be happy forever."
I think... I think that she must have been congratulating me in her dreams.
That thought reached me.
If we continue to be happy, she can be happy too.
I can believe that now.
Believe it with all my heart!


Kyou:
Did you hear?
The rumor about the student who was in a coma after the accident two years ago?

Ryou:
She's the sister of Miss Ibuki who was married the other day.
You remember her, don't you?
I heard that sister is really cute!

Youhei:
What? And who's saying that?

Kyou:
A rumor, just a rumor.
But you know, doesn't it seem sort of real in a way?
I mean, I feel like I know this girl somehow.
And that she's still here always running around the school.

Youhei:
It does kinda seem that way.

Kyou:
Doesn't it?
Say, it's been bothering me, but that carving you have.

Youhei:
You mean this little thing?
I just found it in my dorm room.
But it's funny that I don't remember how I got it exactly.
But wait. Hey, wait a minute!
This is...

Ryou, Nagisa:
It is!

Kyou:
Why yes, I believe it's a...

Ryou, Kyou, Nagisa:
A starfish!

Nagisa:
But how can any of us know that?
How could we?

Kyou:
Hey, wake up you!
Don't just sleep through this. Join in the conversation!
Tomoya!

Tomoya:
That girl student suddenly became the talk of the school.
Pure and earnest, running around the school.
That's the image of the girl.
And then, we all waited, for the day that girl might awaken.
I was definitely one of them.
And that day will someday...

Fuko:
Please! Please be my friend.
Be one of my very best friends with you!
