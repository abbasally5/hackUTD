  Sanae:
Good Morning!
 How are you, Okazaki?
 Look at my newest creations! 

Tomoya:
Wait a second, could this be?

Sanae:
I spent the entire Golden Week developing these yummy pastries.
 I designed every single one of them:
 From cream-filled to jam-filled.
 So tell me, what do you think of my culinary work?

Tomoya:
Actually I think it's the worst.

Sanae:
That's the exact same reaction as Akio's!

Tomoya:
Where is he exactly?

Sanae:
He left the shop just as soon as I had pulled them out of the oven.
 His last words were, "Sanae, you are the cutest woman in the entire world.
 However, the pastries you make are the worst I've ever tasted!"
 I was crying the moment before you came in here.
 But then I thought, I'll just go it alone.
 And then I pulled myself together by my bootstraps.
 So Okazaki, how about tasting just one of them, huh?

Tomoya:
I don't want any.

Sanae:
Akio, it's impossible for me to do it alone without you!

Tomoya:
You're awfully quick to perceive that.


-OP-

第6回 姉と妹の創立者祭


Sanae:
I guess I'll go look for Akio.
 If you want to see Nagisa and Fuko, they're inside.

Nagisa:
Well, good morning to you, Okazaki!
 How are you?

Fuko:
Where did Miss Sanae go to?
 There was a telephone call for her just now.

Tomoya:
She went on a little mission to find Akio.
 What kind of call was it?

Fuko:
He was breathing heavily and laughing a lot.
 And then he kept saying, "I love you, I love you!" over and over.

Tomoya:
Isn't that a crank call?

Fuko:
But he said, "Seriously, please stop making those starfish pastries."

Tomoya:
So it was Akio!

Nagisa:
Yes, and when Fu-chan said his name,
 he started screaming and he cut the phone line.

Tomoya:
Well, he was declaring his undying love to his daughter's friend, after all.
 Huh?!
 This is... so this is the barrier that imprisons Fuko!

Nagisa:
What are you talking about?

Tomoya:
Look!
 Every time she recovers, her eyes greet this countless number of starfish.
 They send her back into her fantasy.
 At this rate, it would be difficult to ever bring her back to this reality!
 And...


Tomoya:
After several hundred years,
 when a more evolved humanity controls mankind,
 a lone traveler approaches the Furukawa home - fallen into ruins.
 Legendary Starfish Tamer, lend us humans your power.
 Appear! Fuko!


Tomoya:
Not likely to sell.

Nagisa:
No, I think that was very interesting!
 I wanna hear more of that story.

Tomoya:
It's a joke!
 But looking at it from this perspective, it won't be a joke for long.
 Oh...

Nagisa:
Okazaki, wha~?

Tomoya:
I'll pay for it later.

Nagisa:
No, it's not like that...

Tomoya:
I messed up last time.
 This is my revenge.

Fuko:
Umf!
 My nose felt funny just now!

Tomoya:
Is that so?
 That's strange...

Fuko:
And my throat is all wet for some reason.

Tomoya:
I finally did it! Success at last!

Nagisa:
Okazaki, stop!



Fuko:
Here! It's a present - please accept it!

Tomoya:
Day after day, I'm amazed she can keep on doing it.

Nagisa:
She must have approached at least half the student body with those starfish.

Fuko:
Excuse me.
 Excuse me, sir! Please accept this!

Student:
What is this?

Nagisa:
Okazaki, I would like more than anything for Fu-chan and Miss Ibuki to finally meet.
 Because Fu-chan is working so hard.
 I'll go to the art room and get more pieces of unwanted wood, okay?

Tomoya:
Wait a minute. I'll go with you then.

Nagisa:
No, Okazaki. You stay here and watch over Fu-chan!

Tomoya:
Hey Furukawa, wait! I said I'd go with you...

Fuko:
Ahh!

Tomoya:
What is your problem?

Fuko:
Help me, Okazaki!
 There are lots of people like you chasing after me!
 I'm scared.

Tomoya:


Fuko:
Necessity knows no law!

Tomoya:
What's wrong with you. That's no way to ask for help!

Boys:
Ohh, Fuko!

Boy:
So tell me, are you a friend of Fuko's?

Fuko:
He his not. He's my enemy!

Tomoya:
Don't say things that will complicate matters any further!

Boy:
We want to start a Fuko fanclub, because we just worship Fuko-chan!

Tomoya:
What kind of fanclub?

Boy:
Or maybe we'll start a support group of some kind for us.

Boy:
All of us are simply dumbstruck by Fuko giving her
beautiful hand-carved star carvings to all sorts of kids in our class that she didn't even know!

Boy:
We thought that all of Fuko's avid fans can possibly help bring her new levels of excitement to her sister's wedding!

Tomoya:
Well, what do you think?

Fuko:
I don't want your help!

Boy:
We'll do our best, anyway!

Boy:
To be honest, we didn't expect her to accept us immediately.

Tomoya:
I think all of you are just wasting your time.
 She's not the type to be emotionally moved by something like that.

Fuko:
That's like saying I'm a cold and wild person!
 I'm actually the type that honors kindness.

Tomoya:
I don't know about that, you're pretty unsociable with me.

Boy:
All of us will work our fingers to the bone until the day Fuko trusts all of us!

Boy:
Because we're absolutely infatuated with Fuko!

Boy:
Oh dear brother of Fuko, we seek to beg your pardon.

Tomoya:
They think you and I are siblings... 

Fuko:
That's terrible!

Tomoya:
That's my line!



Tomoya:
It's true that there are more people accepting the starfish.
 But it's only a fraction of the total student body.
 Okay, look here. It's almost Founder's Festival.
 Every year in May we have a mini school festival.
 Right now every club is busy with preparations.
 Everybody's really looking forward to it.
 On the day of the festival, students are happy and there will be outside guests.
 If we distribute them there, there'll be more people who will come to the wedding.

Youhei:
This sales meeting is for which department store?

Fuko:
Oh. It's the guy with the weird hair color!

Youhei:
You're still very rude to me.
 And after I came all this way to help you guys out.

Nagisa:
Wait a minute, are you going to help us, Sunohara?
 Wonderful of you to volunteer!

Tomoya:
Wait a minute, are you serious?

Youhei:
Of course! You know how much I want to get on Nagisa's good side.
 So I'm joining your little group to help you out!

Fuko:
Don't want you!

Tomoya:
Well good bye, Sunohara.

Youhei:
Isn't that just a bit cold-hearted!

Fuko:
Weird people will always do weird things, so there will be problems.
 I know this first-hand from watching Okazaki.

Tomoya:
You're lumping me with him?

Youhei:
Okay!
 Then you have a match with me!

Nagisa:
Stop it!
 You know fighting's not good!

Tomoya:
She's right. You're gonna get kicked right into the trash chute again!

Youhei:
No!! Are you saying it's a sure thing that I'll lose to her?

Nagisa:
You mean a carving contest?
 That conforms to sportsmanship, so I think it's a great idea!

Tomoya:
This is not a sport, you nitwit.

Youhei:
If I carve better than you can carve, you have to let me in.
 If not, I promise I'll give up the idea.
 That's okay with you?
 Okay, the theme is... Nue!

Fuko/Nagisa/Tomoya:
Nue?

Youhei:
The head of a monkey, the body of a badger, the tail of a snake, and the hands and feet look like a tiger. 
A monster!

Fuko:
Let's see... 
The head of a monkey, the body of a dog, the tail of a pigeon(?),and it likes millet dumplings.

Tomoya:
I'm sorry, but there was not one single mention of what it likes.

Youhei:
Oh, never mind!
 Ready? Go!

Nagisa:
Oh, Okazaki. Do you think you and I could see a Nue if we go to the zoo?

Tomoya:
Of course not. It's a beast that only appears in mythology and legend. 

Nagisa:
Oh, is that so?
 I thought that it might actually exist, and I really wanted to see one!

Tomoya:
This is a room full of idiots.

Fuko:
Finished!

Youhei:
That fast!
 No way! What?

Tomoya:
This... this is...

Youhei:
And where exactly is the Nue in this?

Fuko:
This is the best that I could do!

Tomoya:
Good job, Fuko!

Youhei:
If you carve something different from the theme, then you get zero points.
 So the win is mine!

Tomoya:
Sunohara's default. Fuko wins!

Youhei:
You could worry a little bit!

Nagisa:
You should go to the infirmary right away!



Tomoya:
Invite Miss Ibuki to the Founder's Festival?

Nagisa:
Yes, I think we should!
 We should invite Miss Ibuki and arrange for them to meet.

Tomoya:
I see. That may be a great idea.
 Fuko!
 Nagisa and I have something we really have to do.
 How about you go on home and we'll see you a little later?

Nagisa:
We'll return right away.

Tomoya:
Can she go home alone?

Nagisa:
Don't worry, Okazaki.
 I'm sure she'll be all right.
 Fu-chan's a big girl!

Tomoya:
Acutally Nagisa, she's the exact same age as I am.

Nagisa:
 Someone could say you and I are just like Fu-chan's father and mother, aren't we?
 ...never mind! Forget I said that, please?
 Please, please?



Tomoya:
Yusuke Yoshino?

Nagisa:
Are you saying that you know him?

Tomoya:
Wait a minute, hold on there!
 Don't tell me that you're actually the guy who's Kouko's fiance?

Yusuke:
So, her student. Is that what you're telling me?

Nagisa:
Yes. In my first year, she was a great help to me

Tomoya:
We came here today because we both wanted to invite Kouko to the Founder's Festival.
 There's something we want to show her.

Nagisa:
It will surely be a terrific day full of fun and festivities.

Yusuke:
Hmm. That's a very good idea.

Nagisa:
Are you saying you'll come, then?

Yusuke:
Whether she goes or not is up to her.
 But somehow I think that just hearing about it will greatly lift her little spirits.
 Good luck!



Kouko:
You want me to go to the festival?
 But I quit teaching at that school three years ago.
 And now the only student I know there is you, Nagisa.

Tomoya:
But, you know some of the teachers there,
 and besides, there'll be lots of really great games, ands food stands, and refreshments.

Nagisa:
Oh please come, you must!

Kouko:
Yes, well...
All right, I will!
 Before the accident, I promised my sister...
 ...made a solemn promise to her that I would go to the Founder's Festival after she entered this school.
 Yes! I'll walk around and see all the wonderful sites there.
 Then I'll go tell my dear sister about them!

Nagisa:
I'm... I'm sure she'll be happy!

Tomoya:
Nagisa, what is wrong with you?

Nagisa:
I'm sorry. Please excuse me!

Kouko:
Whatever is the matter with you, Nagisa?

Tomoya:
She probably just needs to go to the toilet very badly!

Kouko:
Oh my goodness, dear!
 Would you like maybe to use my toilet, then?

Nagisa:
I beg your pardon...




Tomoya:
That was very unnatural.

Nagisa:
I'm sorry, I couldn't hold it in.
 The fiance seems to be a kind person.

Tomoya:
Yeah. Getting Fuko and Miss Ibuki to meet will clarify their relationship.

Fuko:
I wonder if my sister will ever be able to hear my voice?



 C L A N N A D




Nagisa:
Finally, today is the day!

Tomoya:
Whatever, she's working too hard on this.

Nagisa:
Fuko worked all through the wee hours of the night.

Tomoya:
And now we're forcing her awake to take her...
 ...in the end, this is our only choice, I guess.

Akio:
Quit your bellyaching, kid.
 If you were any kind of real man, you should be able to juggle a girl or two without a sweat.

Tomoya:
Don't be absurd!

Sanae:
Please just do your best, will you?

Nagisa:
We will.

Tomoya:
Well, we'll be going now.

Nagisa:
Fu-chan looks very comfortable to me!

Tomoya:
She may look that way, but I think she'll say this is the worst ever as soon as she gets up.

Nagisa:
Okazaki, Fu-chan doesn't really hate you that much, I promise you.
 She actually seems to enjoy herself quite a bit whenever you're around.

Tomoya:
If you ask me, she should let her guard down more with other people.
 She always seems to have her guard up like a friendly little animal. 

Nagisa:
I think Fu-chan is doing the best she can.
 And I'm just certain that Miss Ibuki will be happy when she sees Fu-chan working so hard!

Tomoya:
I bet you're right.

Nagisa:
And let's make sure we all give our congratulations for her wedding.

Tomoya:
We will.
 Oh, so you're up!
 Good morning.

Nagisa:
Okazaki carried you all the way here on his back without ever complaining.

Fuko:
Well I think that's just terrible!

Tomoya:
See, there. I told you she'd say something like that.

Nagisa:
No, Okazaki. Fuko said, "I think."
 So it's not really that insulting to you at all.

Tomoya:
That's a doubtful follow-up!



Fuko:
 I'm sorry. I reflexively said something rude to you.

Tomoya:
I think going through the trouble of saying "somehow" 
means that you didn't really mean to say it that way on purpose.

Fuko:
It must be because you were carrying me on your back that caused me to have a strange dream.

Tomoya:
It's about a starfish, I bet.

Fuko:
Yes, as a matter of fact I was playing with a starfish on a pretty beach...

Tomoya:
Hey, Fu-chan!
 Ya-hooo!
 Check it out! Okazaki's the best!

Fuko:
Then you grabbed my hand.

Tomoya:
What are you doing all alone?
 Today is the Starfish Festival, you know?

Fuko:
So what is the Starfish Festival?

Tomoya:
How would I know?

Nagisa:
But it sure seems like fun!



Tomoya:
I think that's the exact spot where you should stand at the school festival.

Nagisa:
I agree.

Fuko:
Here you go.

Nagisa:
Hmm...? Hm.
 Thank you very much for that. It's so sweet!



Nagisa:
This is...?
 Uh, did you make all of this?

Boy:
Of course! Because all of us wanted to support Fuko no matter what!

Boy:
Everyone who buys something from our booth will get an impassioned exposé about Fuko's sister's wedding day.

Tomoya:
If you ask me, your senses are on par with Sanae's.

Nagisa:
Oh, Fu-chan?

Tomoya:
Stupid kid.

Fuko:
Uh? Huh?

Kyou:
Hey, wake up!

Ryou:
Fuko, that outfit looks so beautiful on you!

Fuko:
Why am I dressed this way?
 And come to think of it, when did I come to this world?

Tomoya:
You were in a daze, so we brought you here.

Nagisa:
You look so cute in that uniform, Fu-chan!

Kyou:
This is a joint project between B and D classes.
 The class chairmen are twins, so they volunteered to do this.
 Wasn't that sweet of them both?

Ryou:
Fuko, I bet if you presented them to the customers,
 they're sure to accept them without a second thought!

Nagisa:
I don't mind helping as well.
 It seems to me that you don't have enough help.

Fuko:
Are you short of starfish?!

Tomoya:
Argh, that's not what she means!

Ryou:
Sorry to keep you waiting!

Student:
Ah, thank you.

Fuko:
Here. Here you go.

Student:
What's this? A coaster?
Is this a coaster?

Fuko:
No! It's not a coaster!

Nagisa:
Look how hard Fu-chan is working.

Tomoya:
You look like the real thing, too.

Nagisa:
Thank you.
 I think that waiting on my fellow students can be quite a lot of fun!

Fuko:
Here!

Girl:
That girl's name is Fuko, right?

Girl:
She seems to be working hard for her sister.

Girl:
She looked so cute working, didn't she?

Youhei:
Looks like everything's fine today.

Tomoya:
Yeah. Seems she became a big school celebrity before we knew it.

Nagisa:
After all, she's been doing it everyday.
 I have learned something very vaulable from Fuko.
 I'm going to look for new Drama Club members with just as much dedication.
 And I won't ever give up!
 Then we'll participate in the school festival, too.

Youhei:
Perhaps you'll be kind enough to let me help you, my dear Nagisa!

Nagisa:
Huh?

Tomoya:
What are you doing slipping that in there like that?

Youhei
My feelings for you are very real, Nagisa!

Tomoya:
Sunohara, that girl looks like she's not doing anything.

Youhei:
Where? Where? Where?
 H-Hey! Hey you!
 Shall I show you around?

Tomoya:
Seems like his intentions to you were short-lived.

Girl:
No, it's okay. That's not necessary!

Youhei:
Aww, I don't mind. So tell me, baby, what school are ya from?
 Hey watch it!
 Get out of my way! She's getting away!
 If you don't get out of my way, I'll use force.
 Oh, you're in for it now...
 Out of my way!
 Ow! Ahhh!!

Tomoya:
That kick. It must be Tomoyo!

Nagisa:
That's Tomoyo? The girl who got rid of the bikers in the schoolyard?

Tomoyo:
I volunteered to patrol.


Tomoya:
So what's with the costume?

Tomoyo:
I'm actually kind of famous in some parts.
 If I show my face, there are some who would try to pick a fight with me.

Fuko:
Excuse me. Will you accept this, please?

Tomoyo:
For me?

Fuko:
Yes, it's a present for you.

Tomoyo:
I have to say, I don't usually accept presents from strangers.
 But this looks like it's hand-made.
 I receive a lot of gifts from girls, but they're not usually hand-made.
 I'll accept it gratefully. Thank you so much!

Fuko:
She's a very kind person.

Nagisa:
Okazaki, what about Sunohara?

Tomoya:
Oh, I wouldn't worry about him.
 He's probably recovered and chasing another girl.

Fuko:
Ah. Mitsui?

Mitsui:
So have you been doing that all this time?

Fuko:
Please accept one from me.

Mitsui:
So tell me, what is the exact date of your sister's wedding?

Fuko:
The date isn't set just yet.

Mitsui:
Is that so? If it's not before an exam, I may be able to go.
 Well, I'll see you.
 Please do your best!

Nagisa:
Wasn't that nice of her?
 I thought it was.

Fuko:
Yes... 
Yes!

Nagisa:
I just realized that it's almost time for Miss Ibuki to get here.

Tomoya:
Yeah.

Nagisa:
Miss Ibuki, over here!

Tomoya:
Well, it's nice to see you, Kouko. 

Nagisa:
We can't thank you enough for coming, Miss Ibuki!

Kouko:
Well hello there, Nagisa! And you, Okazaki!
 I'm so terribly sorry. Was I a little bit late.

Nagisa:
Oh, no.

Kouko:
It's been a while since I've been here. I was a little nervous!
 The place hasn't changed, but it is like a different school.
 Silly me, it must be because I don't know any of the students.
 Oh, my goodness gracious me, I'm so silly!
 That's why I was relieved to see the two of you.

Nagisa:
Um, the two of us?

Kouko:
Yes!

Fuko:
Because I just can't... because my sister isn't able to hear me from here.
 I think that's why I'm here...

Kouko:
What's wrong?
 Is there something the matter?
 Nagisa? Okazaki?

次回予告


Fuko:
 If you would like to, I would very much like you to come to my sister's upcoming wedding!
 A starfish can do that much?
 Ahhhaha!

Youhei:
 I gotta tell ya. After you left with Nagisa, a strange thing happened.

Kotomi:
 I'm sorry to say that I'm not very versed on animals.

Fuko:
 I accept your challenge!

Tomoya:
 That's out-and-out harassment if you ask me!
