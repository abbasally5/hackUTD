  Ataru:
Whoa!
Where am I? What have I been doing?

Mendou:
So you finally woke up.
How you can snore so loudly in this cold weather, is beyond me.

Ataru:
I get it...
I fell asleep on the way to get take-out food for midnight snacks!
So that town and that Mujaki guy were all a dream.
But it sure seemed terribly realistic, didn't it...

Mendou:
Ha. Well, dreams are highly realistic while you're dreaming.
If you think about it, there's no guarantee that you and I talking like this as we drive, in this instant, isn't a dream.

Ataru:
Heh Heh... That's ridiculous.

Mujaki:
Nothing ridiculous about it.
I told you I wouldn't let you go.
You're the only one who will never escape!

Ataru:
Look out!
It's a red light, you idiot!

Mujaki:
Huh?

Ataru:
Now I knock us out again and escape!
My head was harder than his...


Ataru's Mom:
Ataru! Ataru, wake up, Ataru!
You don't have time to be unconscious!
Ataru! Ataru!

Ataru:
Uh.. Whoa!

Reporter:
Moroboshi is awake! The indomitable Ataru Moroboshi!
He fights again for the fate of Earth, but there are only ten minutes left!
Can he grab the horns of Lum the devil-girl and save mankind?

Shinobu:
Hang in there, Ataru, if you want to marry me!

Ataru:
Yes, anything goes, if it means that we can be married, Shinobu!
Hey, Lum! See this?

Lum:
Hey! That's my only top!
Give it back!

Ataru:
I win...!
Ho... hold it!
This all started when I grabbed her horns!

Reporter:
Oh! Time has run out! Time has run out! This is terrible!
What were you thinking, Ataru Moroboshi, enemy of Earth!?
You flaming moron!


Megane:
I've done it! Success at last!

Chibi:
Congratulations, Doctor!

Ataru:
My name is Franken-Ataru.
After a period of unconsciousness, cause unknown I returned to life as a man-made golem.
It was indeed fortunate that for some reason, I was resistant to high-voltage electricity.
Fortunate?
All that awaited me in this world were stares filled with hate.
People hated me, and none would come near me, let alone talk to me.

Mujaki:
Hey! What are you doing to that girl!
Keep your hands off!

Ataru:
Hey! You stupid moron!
Enough with the stupid tricks!
I'm going back to reality!

Narration:
"The two approached one another with the speed of a gust of wind heading for the point where life and death meet."

Mujaki:
I... won...


Ataru's Dad:
Are you awake, Ataru?
It may surprise you, but listen to what I have to say.
Your mother and I probably won't be alive when you hear this tape.
We made every effort to find some way to awaken you and Lum from your mysterious sleep.
But present-day science, not just that of Earth, but of Lum's planet as well couldn't revive the two of you.
Forgive us.
We've staked our last hopes, and your fates, on the future.
We thought that science a few centuries from now might have a chance of awakening you.
Ataru, you're strong enough to live anywhere, anytime.
Lum's parents said to tell you to take good care of her.
That's all there is to say...
Oh, yes, we had to take out a 500-year loan in your name to pay the cold-sleep fees!

Ataru:
Huh?
An emergency 400 years ago?!
Nooo!
Wow! It was a stage set!

Mujaki:
Hey you! You're not supposed to exit this dream before I've got the next one ready, you idiot!


Mujaki:
That one sure struck home.
I bet you're glad it was a dream, huh?
Good thing it wasn't reality.
You can do it over because it was a dream.
You can repeat it any number of times.
Hey, you know this story?
A man who dreamed he was a butterfly woke up and couldn't tell which was real and which was the dream.
Maybe the real "he" is in the butterfly's dream.
See, whether you call something reality or a dream, you ultimately think of it in the same way.
That being the case, isn't it better to live a fun life in a dream?
Even you: if you don't ask for anything outrageous, I'll make you tons of good dreams.
The dreams I make are the same as reality.
Therefore, they are reality!
I won't do anything bad.
So trust me.
I'll be waiting up above.
Come up and see me when you're ready.
Oh, yeah, all you have to do is climb this stairway.
Well, I'll be waiting!

Girl:
Do you really want to go back?

Ataru:
Well, you see, I wanna be free from a girl, because I want to keep loving her.
You probably don't understand, seeing as how you're a girl too...

Girl:
Want me to tell you how?

Ataru:
What!
You mean you know how I can get back to reality?

Girl:
Everyone knows how.
They just forget when they wake up.
You jump off from here, like this.
And before you hit bottom and wake up, you call out the name of the person you really want to see.
If you can't say that one special name, then you don't really want to wake up.

Ataru:
Oh, that will be easy.
There are lots of girls I wanna see.

Girl:
Then will you promise me something?

Ataru:
Hm?

Girl:
Do the right thing!

Ataru:
Ahhhh!
Ran! Oyuki! Benten! Shinobu! Miss Sakura!
Ryoko! Otama! Ryuu! Tsuyuko!
Kintaro's Nanny! The Flower Shop Girl! Kaede!
The Dolphin Girl! Mother!
Lum!
You don't know what I've been through!
Wake up, you jerk!

Lum:
Oh, Darling...
Darling, I had such a dream.
There was you, Ten, your mother and your father and Megane and...

Ataru:
Lum, that was a dream.
It was only a dream.

Huh?

Lum:
Oh, keep going...

Ataru:
D-Don't be ridiculous!
I can't do something so embarrassing in front of all these people!

Lum:
Why not? Why not?
Why can't you do it in front of people?
You can if you love me. Well?

Ataru:
When did I ever say that I loved you?

Lum:
What! You still act like this?
I can't stand it!

Ataru:
H-Hey, stop it! Stop it!

Man A:
Hey, they're at it again.

Man B:
I swear, they'll never learn, and they'll never change.
They'll do that for the rest of their lives.

Mujaki:
Too true.
Keeping up with those two takes more effort than normal.
Shall we go?
