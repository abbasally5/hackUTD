Perm:
But do you really think anyone'll come to a place that looks like this, Megane?

Chibi:
Maybe we should've gone for that Hot Babes Coffee Shop like Ataru suggested.
Lum gave it her okay too, after all.

Megane:
I won't have Lum acting like a bimbo.
Besides, do you know how hard it was to collect money from everyone in class to open this place?
I'll be shot before I let it be operated according to Ataru's weird tastes.

Perm:
Weird tastes, he says...

Mendou:
Speaking of whom, where's our fearless leader goofing off now?

Chibi:
Lum just went looking for him, so he should be back soon.

Mendou:
I swear...

Ryuunosuke:
Hey, I'm sorry, guys, but I gotta split soon.
I have to get the Hama Teashop ready for the Festival as well.

Mendou:
Okay, thanks for your help.

Perm:
Oh brother. Looks like we'll be staying here again tonight.

Chibi:
We've got a real manpower shortage here.
No wonder, considering how unpopular Ataru is.

Kakugari:
Hey, you guys still goofing around?
When the eternity is your shop gonna be ready, morons?

Perm:
So, don't goof around, work! Got it?

Kakugari:
What the...?


Megane:
Hey! We have tons of things to do before tomorrow's opening.
So quit slacking off, and get...

Perm:
Huh?

Shinobu:
Oh?

Kakugari:
Hm? What's wrong with you?
Isn't this a great idea?
If I go out looking like this, and really toady up to the crowd, you'll have a stampede of customers.
Aahhh!

Onsen:
What's that?
Toadying up to the crowd, looking like that?
Moroboshi! Get out here now!

Mendou:
Sir, could you avoid causing any unnecessary shocks?
Even with the options removed to make it lighter, this Leopard still weights about forty tons.
And I won't be held responsible for it if it drops through the floor.

Onsen:
What did you say?
Hey, Mendou! I don't know if this is an exhibit or what.
But I didn't give any permission to bring a tank in here!

Mendou:
So you say, but there's nothing to be done as it's already here.
Or maybe you would prefer to just confiscate it?

Boys:
Confiscate! Confiscate! Confiscate!

Onsen:
Shut up!

Onsen:
Damn... How'd he get it in here, anyway?

Ataru:
Ahahaha...
That was terrific!

Onsen:
Hmmh...
That disgusting laugh...

Megane:
Ataru!

Perm:
Where are you?
Get out here!

Ataru:
I love you, Ran!

Mendou:
Huh? In here?

Ataru:
You come here too, right, Ryoko.
Hurry up!

Mendou:
Ryoko? Are you in there, Ryoko?

Onsen:
Hey! Moroboshi!
What are you doing in there?
Come out!

Megane:
That idiot!

Mendou:
Moroboshi
What have you done to my sister?

Ataru:
Okay, come on, Oyuki. Kurama, Shinobu.
Yes, yes, I won't run away!
Oh, Sakura, don't do that...
Oh, no...

Ryuunosuke:
Aw, shut your stupid mouth, you jerk!

Boys:
Whoa!

Onsen:
Whoa...!

Mendou:
I'm claustrophobic!
I'm scared of the dark!

Ryuunosuke:
Let go, you idiot!

Onsen:
Whoa...!
Save me! Somebody, please save me!

Sakura:
Pathetic fools...

Onsen:
My arms are going numb!
My... My teeth are falling out!

Lum:
What are you doing, sir?

Onsen:
Lum, save me!

Lum:
Sure, but first, do you know where my daring is, sir?

Onsen:
Moroboshi is in this tank.
Now, help me, hurry!

Lum:
In here?

Ataru:
Come on!

Ryuunosuke:
Let go, you jerk!

Ataru:
Come on, Ryuu!

Ryuunosuke:
Cut it out!
Stay away from me!

Ataru:
Ryuu!

Ryuunosuke:
Stupid!

Ataru:
Ryuu!

Lum:
Darling!
Come out of there before I count to three!
One!

Ryuunosuke:
Jerk!

Mendou:
I'm scared of the dark!

Lum:
Two!

Mendou:
I'm scared!

Lum:
Three!
Divine retribution!


Principal:
Well, since this is the annual school festival, student self-management is to be encouraged.
There's no point in me, the principal, saying anything now.
But as Shinran said, the road to heaven is harder for the pious than the profane.
Man travels alone walking without either looking back or crying.
And who would know that true heart of the water's deep beneath the earth?
We all go through times of agony, pain and wrong-doing... and become fine adults in spite of it.
And Momotaro can go to Manchuria and become Genghis Khan.
As the great Goethe said, "pass through agony and reach the great pleasure."
Thus anyway, the important thing is that all are safe; no one was injured.
Please keep in mind that safety always comes first.
Thank you.
My, do we have mice?

Shinobu:
Oh, man!
I can't stand the Principal's long speeches.
Oh, Miss Sakura.

Sakura:
Hmmh? What are you two girls still doing here?
Wasn't it decided that girls had to leave school by ten o'clock?

Shinobu:
Well, there was a little fuss.

Sakura:
Moroboshi again, right?

Shinobu:
What about you, Miss Sakura?

Sakura:
I can't keep up with all the fools who hammer on their own fingers or nail their own feet to the floor.
So I'm staying tonight too.

Shinobu:
Oh...

Shinobu:
I can't take this!
Every night another stupid disaster!
Then we spend all night cleaning up.
When I call my mom, she keeps complaining that girls my age shouldn't stay away from home so much.
I've had it!

Lum:
Really?
I like it because it's like camping out every night.

Shinobu:
Unlike aliens, humans can't deal with this kind of things all the time!
And why do I have to be here anyway?
I'm not even a committee member.

Lum:
What do you mean?

Shinobu:
Well, let's say Person A is staying here out of concern for Person B.
In my case, I'm staying because I'm care about this Person A.
But the Person B that the Person A is concerned about doesn't know this.
Did you understand that?

Lum:
No, not at all.

Shinobu:
No, I suppose you wouldn't.
Anyway that's why I'm tired of it all.
How can I compete with you when you haven't a clue?

Sakura:
Hehehe...

Shinobu:
Huh?

Sakura:
Oh, I'm sorry.
But I never get tiered of watching you kids.

Shinobu:
Lum, I've been meaning to ask you.
Just what do you see in Ataru?
Even I wonder sometimes.
I mean he's such a typical male: good-for-nothing, lazy, mean, lustful, perverted, fickle and egotistical.
Though I'll admit he is a good natured sort of guy.

Lum:
Hm, not so different from Shutaro!

Shinobu:
At least, Shutaro's good-looking.
That's a big difference.

Sakura:
I swear young girls these days...

Shinobu:
Oh, yeah?
Good-looks seems to be your fiance's saving grace too!

Sakura:
Who asked you?

Lum:
I love Darling.
I want to live happily ever after with Darling, his mom and dad, Ten, Shutaro, and Megane and all his friends.
That's my dream.

Shinobu:
What? That's basically just like it is now!

Lum:
Yup. That's why I'm so happy now.

Shinobu:
Oh...
Well, if you're gonna be so blunt, I guess there's nothing more to say.

Sakura:
Make sure you turn off the stove, okay?
And hey, you two girls hang in there, all right?
There's only tonight left, tomorrow is the school festival's opening day.


Ataru:
Hey, sorry to hold you up!

Mendou:
Okay, go!

Ataru:
Aaah!
Hey! What's the matter, Mendou?
Are you still mad at me?

Mendou:
Naturally!
You made me an innocent victim of an electric shock.
The tank's electronic components were completely reduced to scrap.
Our nearly-complete coffee shop was wiped out.
And it's all your fault!

Ataru:
So, I apologized, didn't I?
You sure like to hold a grudge.
Still, it was such a good dream...

Mendou:
Stop dragging people into your disgusting dreams!

Ataru:
Excuse me!

Ataru:
Still, you know...

Mendou:
What now?

Ataru:
We've been staying overnight at school every night lately and we only get out at times like this, when we go to get food, right?

Mendou:
So what's your point?

Ataru:
Maybe that's the reason.
But I wonder if the town is usually this quiet at night?

Ataru:
Since when did Special-Sale Bands start working the night shift?

Mendou:
How should I know?

Announce:
This is a message from the Festival Committee: Will the leaders of all classes and clubs please come to the music room immediately.
Repeat: Will the leaders of all classes and clubs please come to the music room immediately.

Perm:
Oh, I'm so sleepy...

Kakugari:
Another day at hard labor gets underway.

Chibi:
Say, how long have we been doing this?

Megane:
I dunno. It's been so long, I forgot.

Lum:
This is the final stretch. So, let's all hang in there!

Ataru:
You're really tough... Huh?

Ataru:
Hey!

Everyone:
Hmmh?

Perm:
Hey, isn't that Onsen?
He's still alive? Now that's tough.

Kakugari:
But look at his face!

Chibi:
He's really wasted!

Megan:
Well, it's not surprising.
He keeps a hard schedule.
Every day's been nothing but chaos.
He's mentally and physically exhausted.


Chibi:
On top of which, there's a forty-ton tank creaking over the principal's head which could come crashing down at any time, no kidding.

Perm:
He looks like a walking bundle of stress.

Sakura:
Overwork, lack of sleep, malnutrition, nervous system imbalance and your face is ugly.
In short, you are mentally and physically exhausted.
You're a walking bundle of stress.
Anyway, the best thing to do is get away from here and get some rest.
I insist you go back to your boarding house and sleep until evening.
If you can't sleep because of your nerves, take these tranquilizers!

Principal:
Ah, thank you, Miss Sakura.
Keep your chin up, Onsen.
Just one more day.
Tomorrow is the school festival's opening day.


Perm:
Hey, is it noon already?

Chibi:
Hey, yeah, I'm hungry.

Megane:
Idiot! That clock's been out of order for ages.
You're such dweebs.
You see it every day but you still haven't noticed!
Hold out until the ten o'clock break!

Shinobu:
What are you talking about?
You just had lunch at the Hama Teashop!

Perm:
I did?

Mendou:
Enough about that.
Where's Moroboshi gone to? Where is he?

Boys:
Pull! Pull as hard as you can!
Put your backs into it!

Heave-ho! One-two! Heave-ho! One-two! Heave-ho! One-two!
Heave-ho! One-two! Heave-ho! One-two!

Announce:
This is a message from the Festival Committee: Will the student who took the electric foot warmer from the Principal's Office please turn yourself in at once.
Repeat: Will the student who took the electric foot warmer from the Principal's Office please turn yourself in at once.

Sakura:
You just ate too much, you idiot!

Boy:
Ouch!

Sakura:
Super high-potency laxative.
Take half a tablet and beat it. Next!

Boy:
Tranquilizers?

Sakura:
Hm? What was that? That can't be...
Then that means, what I gave Onsen-mark was...
Oops!

Sakura:
I hope I'm in time...
It's me, Sakura!
Turns out the medicine I gave you was...
Urgh...

TV:
I love you, Madam!
Oh, Naoyuki, we mustn't!

Sakura:
Oops!


Sakura:
Still, it's a strange story.
You leave your apartment for several days, and when you finally come back, the inside is covered with dust and mushrooms, as if it were in ruins.
Rather like "Rip Van Winkle."
Playing around in a Dragon Palace called Tomobiki High School in a dream, while years pass by.
Did you rescue a turtle by any chance?

Onsen:
Well, lately, something's really been bothering me.
You know the feeling you get sometimes, when you walk through a town you've never been to before, and you encounter a scene that feels like you'd seen it before?
Or you feel that what you're doing now is something you've been doing over and over, repeating events exactly.

Sakura:
Sounds like "deja vu."
False experiences that a person's mind creates when it gets exhausted.

Onsen:
I thought so too -- that I was exhausted... that that was why I was thinking such strange things... until I saw my apartment today.

Sakura:
What are you talking about?

Onsen:
The Principal was saying it earlier.
"Just one more day. Tomorrow is the School Festival's opening day."
I feel like I heard those lines before...

Sakura:
You're exhausted.
And because you're so tired you're making up memories of things that you've never even done.
It's only natural, putting up with those awful brats day in and day out.
But, well, after today, that'll be over.
Tomorrow is the School Festival...

Onsen:
I started thinking about it.
And for the first time, I realized that I can't clearly remember things to an extent that surprises even me.
Yesterday, the days before, even these past few hours, if I'm not careful, I forget them all.
When, where, who I met, what I did.
Tell me, how long have we been staying at school? Three days? Four?

Sakura:
I dunno... It's been hectic, you know...

Onsen:
Was it long enough ago that you could've forgotten?

Sakura:
What in blazes are you thinking?
Just say it!

Onsen:
It's only a hypothesis.
And it might be better if it were merely a delusion created by my deranged mind, of course.
But this is what I've been thinking: What if, since yesterday, the day before or even further back we can't recall, we've been repeating the same actions.
The same "day before the School Festival."
And that tomorrow will be the same too.

Sakura:
That's ridiculous! You're exhausted.
You're exhausted, and your mind is mixed up, that's all!
You just take it easy today, and then when tomorrow comes...

Onsen:
When tomorrow comes, then what?
Are you saying that it will be a day truly different from today?
I can't even remember a yesterday that was different from today.

Sakura:
Suppose, just suppose, that what you say is true.
Then why isn't anyone else going crazy?
If the students didn't go home for such a long time, their parents would get worried.

Onsen:
What if it's not just Tomobiki High School repeating the same day over and over and over?
What if it's the whole town, or even the whole world that's repeating the same day, over and over?

Sakura:
Enough of your ramblings!
What you're saying doesn't make any sense at all.
It's a delusion.
It's all just in your imagination!

Onsen:
Miss Sakura! I've been trying desperately, but for the life of me I can't remember!
Just what is today's date?
Can you tell me?
As I've been wearing these clothes for days now, being dressed like this might mean that it's winter.
But why am I sweating?
Is it because I'm nervous?
Or is it just because it's warm?
And this sound, which I've been hearing recently...
Am I imagining it, too?

Urashima Taro spent dreamlike days at the Dragon Palace and when he returned to his beloved hometown, he found that hundreds of years had already passed there.
What if, instead of just Taro alone everyone in the village had rescued that turtle?
What if everyone in the village had gone to the Dragon Palace?
You have spiritual power, Miss Sakura.
You would've noticed right away if something strange was happening to someone somewhere in town.
But what if something strange happened to the whole town, or the whole world including you?

Sakura:
Will you cut it out!
This is all just a hypothesis.
It's no more than conjecture.
Where's the proof?

Onsen:
What if, tomorrow, we can't remember us talking like this?

Sakura:
I said, cut it out!

Kakugari:
Argh!
Help! Help! Somebody save me!
