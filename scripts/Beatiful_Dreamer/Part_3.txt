  Sakura:
"I should like to speak with you, with no one else around about this pitiful world."
"I have an idea regarding the life we should live."
"I will wait for you this evening in the Tomobiki High School Clock Tower."
"Sakura."

Ataru:
Sakura! Sorry to keep you waiting...!

Mendou:
Nice of you to come, Moroboshi!

Ataru:
Huh? Ah! What the...?
Huh? Mendou, what are you doing here?

Sakura:
I sent for him.

Ataru:
Then all that about you and I and nobody else around was...

Sakura:
A lie.

Ataru:
I'm leaving.

Mendou:
Leaving? Where would you go, Moroboshi?

Sakura:
I really do have something to talk to you about.
You don't mind just listening for a bit, do you, Moroboshi?

Ataru:
Uh, no...

Mendou:
Listen, Moroboshi. I wasn't driving my tank around just for fun while the rest of you slumbered and partied in this screwed-up world.
Miss Sakura and I were examining the structure of this place and working out a plan to somehow return to our original home.

Ataru:
That sounds like a lot of trouble to me.

Mendou:
Can you imagine how hard those days were?
I wanted to forget everything and spend happy days with Lum too!

Ataru:
Well, I guess you shouldn't have acted so weird.

Mendou:
What! How dare you, feeling no concern for the situation you've been left in and just getting roly-poly fat...!

Sakura:
Stop it! Calm down, Mendou, and get to the point.

Mendou:
Oh, excuse me, I just...
Because you are so stupid, I'll explain this logically and systematically.
Now, this table represents our world, riding on that giant turtle.
In other words, this is Tomobiki Town.
You saw it too, right?

Ataru:
Yeah, I saw it.

Mendou:
Then this is your house.
Using the range of the Leopard's cannon as a ruler, I determined that it is at the center of this roughly two-km diameter circular world.
It is literally the center of the world.
It's unusual enough that such a world is flying through the sky on a turtle.
The real problem is something else.
Why do gas, water, and electricity continue to be supplied only to the house of the Moroboshi's?
Or rather, from where are they supplied?
Have there been any bills?

Ataru:
No, not a one.

Mendou:
Why hasn't the convenience store where you, Megane and the rest pig out ever run out of food?
Going back further, where did all the town's inhabitants disappear to?
And in one night at that! Why? Huh? Why?

Ataru:
How should I know?

Mendou:
Other than those, our lives are without inconvenience... But that's not all!
In order to make things convenient for us this world has been turned totally upside down and made more nonsensical than words can describe.
The existence of a world like this is physically impossible.
Since it does exist, then...

Ataru:
It's only in a dream, right?

Mendou:
Moroboshi! What are you saying?! You mean, you...

Ataru:
I figured it out a long time ago.
Not just me, but Megane and the others, too.
We just didn't talk much about it, as it was too obvious a solution.

Mendou:
Argh...

Ataru:
Looks like you went to all that trouble for nothing after all, Mendou.
Hmm?

Mendou:
If you know so much, why did you play your days away?
Your attitude infuriates me!

Ataru:
Right now, there's nothing else to do but play!
We don't even know whose dream it is!

Mendou:
Oh, you don't know? Oh, I see!
You really don't know?!
It serves you right!
You wouldn't know.
I'm drowning in waves of laughter!
Because I know!

You see, Moroboshi, it's a simple process of elimination.
It's obviously not me, Miss Sakura, or the missing Shinobu or Ryuunosuke.
We exclude Mr. and Mrs. Moroboshi because having so many people in their house inconveniences them.
Clearly, it's not you, either, Moroboshi.
If it were, this world would be full of women.

Ataru:
You got that right.

Mendou:
When we exclude Ten, his pet piglet and Ryuunosuke's father, who's now without his only "son" we are left with five people.
Megane and Company are enjoying living under the same roof with Lum but the problem is that all four of them are together.
If this was one of their dreams, each would think only of himself.
None of them are so philanthropic as to consider the other three.
Which leaves...

Ataru:
Lum?! I wonder...

Mendou:
What's that?
Are you saying that my reasoning is flawed?

Ataru:
I don't know about the rest, why would she eliminate Shinobu and Ryuu?
She's not the kind of girl who'd do something like that.
We've been together long enough for me to know that much about her.

Mendou:
Ahh!
Blast your impudence, Moroboshi!

Sakura:
No, I agree with him on that point.
So far, you've been on the mark with the main points of this discussion.
But even if Lum is the Princess, it is the turtle who invites her to Dragon Palace!
We're forgetting the possibility of a third person, who created all of this to make Lum's wish come true!

Ataru:
Oh, yeah, that's right!

Sakura:
What are you so pleased about?
I'm talking about you, Moroboshi.

Ataru:
Huh? Uh, what do you mean by that?

Sakura:
I'm saying that you're the turtle!

Ataru:
Huh?
Oh, come on, Sakura!
Are you kidding?
Are you saying that I created this world?

Sakura:
Precisely.

Ataru:
Sakura.
A mere high school student could not possibly do something like this!

Sakura:
That mere high school student is over there.
Come on out!

Ataru:
Hey! Hold it, hold it.
The star makes his entrance.
Thank you, thank you.

Ataru(Mujaki):
What the hell is that?

Sakura:
The schemer is out-schemed!
It's as if, in setting a trap, you got caught in one.
Did you think, upon receiving my letter, that he would wait until dark?

Ataru:
I went to see Sakura right after I got it... at noon!

Sakura:
This time won't be like last time.
Let's see you escape this enclosure!
It's all over!

Mujaki:
Aha, so I've been found out.
Shame on you two.

Mendou:
You! Monster! Prepare to... Huh?!

Sakura:
Stay back. You can't handle this one, Mendou.
You look like Mujaki; am I correct?

Mujaki:
Yes, indeed, I am Mujaki.
How do you do?
But I'm surprised that you know me, Miss.

Sakura:
Why shouldn't I?
You are the Dream Demon, known as Mujaki.
As your name says, you are an evil demon who delights in manipulating dreams, and planting seeds of evil in people.
The underbelly of bloody history...
It is there, in that darkness, that your form is constantly lurking.
Who was it that turned a shy art student into a crazed dictator?
Why did an emperor known for his love of poetry and of good government become a bloody tyrant, and set his capital afire?
A devoted disciple betrayed his lord and an honorable man turned his sword on a close friend!

Caesar:
Et tu, Brute?

Sakura:
The temptation in Buddha's mind when he was harvesting the tree of knowledge, Adam and Eve eating the forbidden fruit all because they lost themselves in twisted dreams you inspired them with!

Mujaki:
Hey, hey, wait a minute, Lady.
What authority are you citing here, huh?

Sakura:
Authority?
It's all right here in the Encyclopedia of Evil Spirits in the indispensable reference of all 100,000 Japanese sorceresses!
No more excuses!
I don't know what you're using Lum's dream for, but having revealed your true self, we have now thwarted your scheme.
Release us from this dream world at once, and BEGONE!

Mujaki:
Listening to her talk makes me seem like the very Devil himself.

Sakura:
That's what you are, Mujaki!

Mujaki:
Don't be ridiculous!
Sure, I know a little magic, unlike you ordinary humans.
And I might have lived a little longer than you types as well.
But still...
Oh, I see. My long lifespan makes me seem evil, doesn't it.
Yeah, I've made a lot of different people dream.
I've even given dreams to some of those you mentioned, it's true.
But don't get me wrong.
The dreams I make are only those that they desire.
So if a dream turns out evil, it's because that person has evil desires.

Sakura:
"Whether something is used for good or evil depends on human minds."
A bit of sophistry often used by scientists.

Mujaki:
There were a lot of good dreams, too.
But they never last very long.
They all get out of hand and become nightmares.
Until finally that good-for-nothing comes and eats them all up.
When that happens, I look for a fragment of yet another dream running here, there and everywhere.
But it's always the same thing over again.
I got sick and tired of it.
It got so I was thinking; If I quit making people dream, and just disappeared, maybe that would make people happier than if I stayed around.
That was when I met her...!
It was at some aquarium somewhere...

Ahh!
Oh, I knew right away that she'd been born under a very unusual star.

Sakura:
Well, she came from a different one.

Mujaki:
Excuse me, but do you like watching fish?

Lum:
Not particularly.

Mujaki:
Then you must have had a fight with your boyfriend, right?
Pretty girls like you don't normally come to places like this, all alone.
Oh, Please let me introduce myself.

Lum:
Mr.... Mujaki? I'm Lum.

Mujaki:
Miss I'm Lum. I mean, Miss Lum.
A nice name, sort of sweet, eh, sort of bitter.

That was our first meeting...

Lum:
Dreams?

Mujaki:
Yes, making dreams is my work.
Happy dreams, sad dreams, scary dreams, all kinds.
Yeah, but lately, I've become tired.
I'm thinking of retiring.
I've been having trouble dealing with people...
Maybe I'm just too nervous.
I don't know.
Hey! Why not let me make your dream for my last job?
On the house, of course.
What do you say?

Lum:
My dream?

Mujaki:
I've been searching for a long time...
I've always wanted to make an eternal dream out of a pure dream, a dream that wouldn't turn into a nightmare along the way.
With you, it's possible. I know it is.
Now, tell me your dream.

Lum:
Okay... my dream is to live happily ever after with Darling and Mr. and Mrs. Moroboshi and Ten and Shutaro and Megane and his friends.
That's my dream.

Mujaki:
And thank you for listening.
For one so young, you're quite something, Miss.
I wondered for a moment what I was going to do.
But it's checkmate, and your youth has betrayed you.
After all, I've been around as long as the history of mankind's dreams so you were actually no threat.
Well, take it easy.
Oh, I'll tell you this, for the sake of Miss Lum's and my integrity: That story was true.
Just so you know.
Well, pleasant dreams!
The shadows of the people who vanished hold up the dream town, and in return, they all get the dreams they wanted.
How's that for service?
This, too, is a token of my sentiment.
Conscientious, aren't I.
Still, from now on this dream will be peaceful too.
All that's left in it are the small fry and the idiots, after all.
Naturally, I'll personally take that fool Ataru's place.
You have to have steady nerves to take care of dreams.
They're so delicate... as delicate as... as... as...
What...?! What are you doing here?
And how did you get out?

Ataru:
When you made your advance to Lum,
I jumped from the veranda planning to trash you... and I fell into the water.
I just now crawled out.

Mujaki:
Okay, I see! I'll put you back.
Just hold still, now.

Ataru:
Don't be so pushy, Old Man.
What say we make a deal? Hm?

Mujaki:
Don't be silly!
What possible benefit would I get from making a deal with you?

Ataru:
Sakura gave me this for self-defense, but...

Mujaki:
What was that deal, son, huh?

Ataru:
This is great!
My eternal dream has come true at last!
Okay, okay, one at a time. Yes, I know.

Mujaki:
Well, if this'll take care of everything, fine, but it's not my style.
But now that I think about it, this was bound to happen.
This was a pointless deal.
How stupid...

Ataru:
Hey, Old Man!

Mujaki:
Huh? Now what?

Ataru:
I've looked and looked, and I don't see Lum anywhere.
Where is she?

Mujaki:
Wh-What?!
What did you just say?

Ataru:
Lum's not here.
Why isn't she here? Huh?

Mujaki:
Oh... Brother.

Ataru:
Hey, what's the matter?

Mujaki:
I can't believe you!
You were trying so hard to get away from her!

Ataru:
Oh, I get it now.
Long life does not always make one wiser.
Okay, listen up! I'm in love with Lum, just like all the other girls.
But when I try and see another girl, she interferes, which is why I run away.
You got that?!
If so, bring her here.
A harem without Lum is an imperfect dream!
It's a beef-bowl without the beef!
I'll wreck it, and go back to reality!
Bring Lum here now!

Mujaki:
I've had it with you, do you hear?!
Quit fooling around!
I dare you to do it!

Ataru:
Ow!
What's this?

Mujaki:
Oh! No, no, no, no, no!
Give it back, please!
That precious thing calls Baku... Oops!

Ataru:
Baku?
Oh, yeah, Sakura mentioned him once.
The legendary creature that feeds on nightmares, right? Aha!
Ooh, Baku...

Mujaki:
Not again. Not again.
Why do humans have to be like this?

Ataru:
What's it gonna be, Old Man?
You're gonna produce Lum or not?

Mujaki:
Blockhead! I can't do it.
This world is part of her dream to begin with!

Ataru:
Then I'll use the horn to wreck this dream and return to reality.
Is that what you want?

Mujaki:
No! I'm going to protect her pure dream!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

Ataru:
Pure? You shanghaied us without our knowledge!
You egotist!
I'm blowing this horn!

Mujaki:
Stop! Stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop!
Do you have any idea what'll happen if you do that?

Ataru:
You're just like Lum.
Don't you understand yet that I do things without thinking of the consequences?
And now, back to reality!

Wha... what's all that noise?!

Mujaki:
It's him!
That good-for-nothing is running amuck!
He's wrecking my precious dream!

Stupid! Idiot! Moron! Spoilsport!

Ataru:
Oh, calm down, it's just a dream.
You can always just make more!

Mujaki:
You don't understand at all!
What's the difference between reality and the dreams I make?
I've been making and living in other people's dreams since I was born!
Can't I have a dream of my own, just this once?
Oh, why do they always have to be destroyed?

Cherry:
Well, if it isn't the unlucky young man!

Ataru:
Cherry! Where've you been hiding, you good-for-nothing monk?
Do something about all this!

Cherry:
"Existence is Nothingness."
"Nothingness is Existence."
This world is nothing but dreams and illusions.
If you open your eyes, all will be solved!

Mujaki:
You, I won't let go!
