Yuna: Once upon a time, there lived a brave and powerful Hero. He was on a journey to convince the Demon King to stop tormenting the people. Finally, he arrived at the Demon King's castle!
I am here to see you, Demon King. Come out! You must leave the villagers alone!

Fu: I have done nothing! The villagers fear me because I am different. Now they say I am evil!

Yuna: Still, you should not torment them. Can't we talk this through?

Fu: Talking to you won't stop them from calling me evil!

Yuna: I won't treat you as evil, I swear it!
... sorry 'bout that.

Fu: Well, xxx was no one was hurt. What should we do now?

Yuna: Hero Kick!

Fu: What?! Why, that sure was a dirty trick for a Hero! You are just pretending you want to talk everything out with me!

Yuna: No, I was just...

Fu: ... Demon King Drill Head Butt!

Itsuki: Did we rehearse this? What should I...

Fu: Itsuki, music now!

Itsuki: Which cue are we on? That will.

Yuna: What? The Demon King's theme now?

Fu: Ahahahaha! This music will take you to your grave!

Yuna: The Demon King is too powerful! What do I do?!

Togo: Looks like we need to rally these children for going to have any chance to save our Hero.
Kids, the Hero needs everyone's help! Pump your fists and send power to the Hero. Go, Hero! Go, Hero!

Kids: Go, Hero! Go, Hero! Go, Hero! Go, Hero! ...

Fu: The cheers of the children have drained me of my power!

Itsuki: Oh, nice improv there, big sis!

Yuna: Here it comes! Hero Punch!

Fu: Oh, no!

Yuna: So, what'd ya say for yourself now, Demon King? Can we all just be friends?

Fu: End scene, end scene!

Togo: So, all ended well. The people came together to save their country, and they made peace with the Demon King.

Yuna: It's all thanks to you! Yea!

Kids: Yea!

Yuna: We try to make the most of things by having fun through extracurricular activities. Fu Inubozaki is a third-year student and our club president. She is the one who came up with the story for this play. Itsuki is her young sister. She's in a first-year here and absolutely adores her big sis. And last but not least is my dear friend, Togo. She moved in next door to me last year. Even though we're best friends, she still insists that I call her by her last name. Our club volunteers to do anything, just as long as it helps people out. Together, we're known as the Sanshu Middle School Hero Club!

----------<Title>----------

Yuna: Rise. Bow. And to the Shinju-sama. Again.

Teacher: Good. Class dismissed.

Students: Good bye, ma'am.

Classmate: Yuna.

Yuna: Hmm?

Classmate: We could really use your help. Our next match looks like a mighty and tough one.

Yuna: Okay. I'll be there.

Classmate: What are you two up to right now? More club work?

Yuna: I wouldn't call it work.

Togo: Yeah, it's the Hero Club.

Classmate: I'xxx never get used to that name. It's so weird.

Yuna: Maybe. But I think it sounds awesome. Later!
Anyone here? It's us, Yuna and Togo, reporting in.

Togo: Hi, Itsuki.

Itsuki: Hi, Yuna. Hi, Togo.

Fu: Hey, come on back.

Yuna: Our puppet show yesterday was quite a success, don't you think?

Fu: What? Are you kidding? It was nearly a complete disaster.

Yuna: The keyword is "nearly." You made it through and everyone loved it.

Togo: Yuna's got some great improv skills.

Fu: Her improv was what got us in trouble in the first place.

Yuna: A Hero can never spend time on regretting.

Itsuki: You're always so positive, Yuna.

Fu: Okay, enough backslapping. Are we ready to get started?

Yuna, Itsuki &Togo: Ready!

Yuna: Uh, so cute!

Fu: Adorable, but we have a lot of requests, so stay focused.

Itsuki: All of those kitties need homes?

Fu: That's right. And we are going to find those homes. We'll start a schoolwide campaign and we won't stop until every kitty gets cozy.

Yuna: Oh, right!

Togo: Getting our school involved is a strong grass-roots idea. That's wise.

Fu: Uh, well, thank you. But in order to reach as many people as we possibly can, I've been thinking that maybe we should upgrade our website. Togo, you're up for that?

Togo: Yup. I'll put together a mobile version that people can access from their phones.

Yuna: It's so cool that you can do that!

Itsuki: What about me?

Fu: Uh? Well, uh, the two of you should just keep working. But just try a little harder!

Itsuki: You'll make a great politician someday.

Yuna: Hey, I know, you're going to the coast cleanup, right?

Itsuki: Yeah.

Yuna: There will be lots of pet lovers there. We should ask around.

Itsuki: Uh, that's a great idea.

Togo: Operation Website Upgrade is now complete.

Fu, Yuna & Itsuki: What? Seriously?

Yuna: It's touchscreen perfection!

Fu: Whoa.

Here we go.

Fuu: Great.

yuna: How many is that?

Fu: The third bawl gives you girl power.

Itsuki: Togo the web site looks so much better now.

Fuu: And you finished it so fast too.

Yuna: She is a pro.

Togo: Thank you Fuu. You want my tempura?

Fuu: I don't mind if I do. Keep this up Togo, and you'll be the next president some day.

Togo: Thank you but I'm already busy enough.

Yuna: So, what was that you wanted to talk about, Fuu?

Fuu: Yummy. What should we do for the cultural festival?

Itsuki: huh? [xxx April?]

Yuna: [xxx]

Fuu: Yeah, I think we should map out some of our plans before the summer break.

Togo: Good idea. It's always better to be over prepared rather than be under prepared.

Yuna:Why didn't you say something last year.

Togo: Last year, schedule was so busy, we didn't have time to prepare, remember?

Fuu: Well, this year we have another pair of hands.

Itsuki: You mean, me?

Yuuna: Hm, I think we should make [next xxx xxx] always remember forever.

Togo: But we also wanna do things that can be fun and appealing to everyone.

Itsuki: Oh so what should we do then?

Fuu: Well, that's why we are going to think about. And that is our homework for tonight. Everyone need to meet come up with one idea.

Yuuna, Togo and Itsuki: Okay!

Fuu: And I have one more bowl here please.

Yuna: Another bowl?

Yuna: see you later.

Fuu: Okay, seeya.

Fuu: So tell me, Itsuki. What [xxx] dinner tonight.

Itsuki: What's? Are you still hungry?

Fuu: You don't have much [xxx] appetite.

Itsuki: You [xxx xxx before] just noodles and soup.

Itsuki: Is something wrong, big sis?

Fuu: No, It's nothing.

Fuu: Hey Itsuki.

Itsuki: yeah?

Fuu: What would you say if I told you I had a big secret.

Itsuki: Well, I don't know. What kind of big secret?

Fuu: For example, if I was in big battle of Koshu-Katsunuma with no reinforcements, but [had to tell my army?] to fight.

Itsuki: I don't get it.

Fuu: Isami Kondo.

Itsuki: [xxx] all right?

Fuu: Yeah I'm fine.

Itsuki: I follow you in the battle no matter what. Dose that surprise you? You are the [xxx] I have.

Fuu: Thanks Itsuki.

Teacher: I want you to take the sentences on the board [xxxx] each one of [xxx] individual phrases.

Yuna: What can the hero club do for the cultural festival? I'm [stumped here].

Yuna: It's nothing.

Teacher: Miss Yuki?

Yuna: Yes ma'am.

Teacher: "It's nothing" is not correct.

Fuu, you know something about this place don't you.

So well, where are we then?

Fuu: Be calm, and promise me a listen.

Togo: So then, do you have some special purpose here.

Itsuki: We've always been together. Why don't you ever tell me any of this.

Fuu: [????], I was hoping that I wouldn't ever have to bring it up.

Itsuki: Why not?

Fuu: I didn't wanna say anything. But my Sansyu middle school hero club is [met to become it].

Itsuki: What's 'it'?

Fuu: This world [to see is a type of barrier]. Everything made by the Shinju-sama.

Togo: the Shinju-sama?

Yuna: Well, then that means this place isn't a bad, right?

Fuu: No, the place itself is not bad. But it is where the Shinju-sama has chosen for us to fight enemies.

Itsuki: Enemies? What do you mean 'fight'?

Yuna: Hey, [what ???] this dot? It seems like it's getting closer to us.

Fuu: It's coming.

There it is. At least it looks like a slow one.

Togo: What is it?

Fuu: That's a Vertex. It's enemy of all mankind. And it's here to destroy the world.

Itsuki: What do you mean destroy?

Fuu: The Vertex has one objective. To reach our world's natural treasure, the Shinju-sama.
And when it does that, our world will perish.

Yuna: According to this, we are the only people [in] here.

Togo: But why? Why is it us?

Fuu: The Taish determined we are the most qualified to fight based on [a test course].

Togo: But I can't. There is no way I can fight that thing.

Togo: Yuna, please. Save yourself. You've gotta get out of here!

Yuna: Are you crazy? You are my best friend!
