Yuna: No way, it healed up! How are we supposed to even beat this monster, Fu?! What do we do?

Fu: Vertexes can regenerate after they've been damaged. In order to defeat him, we have to go through all the steps of the Sealing Ritual.

Itsuki: And what exactly are those steps, Fu?

Fu: I'll explain as we evade its attacks. Pay attention and dodge! Here it comes!

Itsuki: Again? It's too hard for me!

Togo: Yuna... My friends... No, I... I can't. Please forgive me. I just can't.

---------- <OP> ----------

Yuna: Step one of sealing the enemy: First, we surround them. Nice try! I'm in position.

Itsuki: Me, too, Fu. I'm ready.

Fu: All right, begin the Sealing Ritual. Just like I taught you.

Yuna: Right, got it.

Itsuki: Okay.

Fu: Hurry, now's our chance!

Yuna: Right, uh, Step two is to commence your citing the prayer that will suppress the enemy's power. I have to say all these prayers?!

Itsuki: Okay, let's say. Master of the Afterlife, please take pity on us...

Yuna: Grant us your blessings, protect our fortune, and bring us joy...

Fu: That's enough!

Yuna & Itsuki: What, you mean that's it?!
