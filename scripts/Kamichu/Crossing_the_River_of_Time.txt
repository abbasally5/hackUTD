-- OP --

Boy: Stand up! And bow!

Everyone in the class: See you tomorrow.

Teacher: Go straight home, okay?

Kenji: Later, guys!

Mitsue: Kenji’s sure in a hurry.

Yurie: Uh-huh.

Matsuri: Oh yeah, he’s meeting someone.

Yurie: Oh… huh!?

Old Gen: Well, that’s no good. Kenji!

Kenji: Yeah!

Old Gen: Don’t you “yeah” me, say “yes"!

Kenji: Yes!

Old Gen: All these shingles need to go. Catch ’em as I toss 'em down.

Kenji: Okay, Mr. Gen.

Mitsue: So Kenji’s big date is with Old Mr. Gen?

Matsuri: He’s always hanging out with old folks.

Old Gen: I said “catch ’em,” you idiot!

Keji: Sorry.

Yurie: Must be fun. He looks really happy.

Matsuri: Feeling better now?

Yurie: Um, yeah…

Matsuri: Okay, c’mon you guys. Why don’t we go over to my place and write up some fortune slips?

Old Gen: Aaaah!

Kenji: Mr. Gen!

Old Gen: Damn it! Agh!

Kenji: Mr. Gen, are you all right?!

Mitsue: Did you hurt yourself?

Matsuri: Are you all right, Mr. Gen?

Yurie: Oh no!

Kenji: Mr. Gen, maybe you should see a doctor.

Old Gen: Quiet, you! Just a little back pain. I’ll be as good as new tomorrow.
Impressive, ain’t she?

Yurie: Huh?

Old Gen: That picture up there. That’s the Yamato.

Mitsue: The Yamato?

Matsuri: What is it?

Old Gen: Only the biggest battleship ever built!--and I was a member of his crew.

Yurie: I see.

Old Gen: It was 1942. They took me on as a member of the 15th engineering department. I was 22 years old. We sailed around Southeast Asia and the Pacific. That ship was beautiful. I felt like I should take off my shoes before I boarded that first time, you know? We had some scares during our voyage, but my pride in being a member of that crew never a-wavered. November 1944, I got injured. When the Yamato returned to the port of Kure, I had to leave. Four months later, the Yamato went down. I wish I could’ve stayed with the ship, but at least I’ve got my memories. Serving on the Yamato was the best part of my life. That picture's as important to me as all the other ones put together.

Kenji: I see. I hope Mr. Gen feels better soon.

Matsuri: I guess you really like old people, huh, Kenji?

Kenji: Well, we should be kind to our elders. Besides, it’s fun to hear all their stories.

Matsuri: Yeah, I guess so.

Mitsue: Isn’t it more fun to talk to girls--like a certain girl in your class maybe?

Kenji: I don’t know. I mean, I don’t really follow what’s popular. They'd probably just think I was boring.

Yurie: They wouldn’t think that! ...Um, ‘cause I don’t.

Kenji: Hey, thanks.

Yurie: Uh-huh.

Matsuri: Okay, c’mon.

Yurie: Huh? Wait up!

Mitsuba-maru: I found her.

Yurie: Morning, Mom.

Yurie’s mother: Good morning. It’s about time, sleepyhead. Everyone else finished breakfast already.

Yurie: But I like sleeping in on Sundays.

Yurie’s mother: Don’t forget to clean up when you’re done.

Yurie: Okay.

Yurie: Thanks Mom.

Mitsuba-maru: Yurie! Agh! Oh, oh! I’m finally here. My name is Mitsuba-maru. I came all the way from Okinawa to ask for a favor.

Yurie: A favor?

Mitsuba-maru: Yes! Yurie, can you help the Yamato get back to his hometown?

Yurie: Huh?

Mitsuba-maru: The Yamato sank off the coast of Okinawa, latitude: 30° 43′, longitude: 128° 4′, depth: 344 m. He’s been down there a long time. He gives advice to the ships that went down more recently, like me. We all respect him. But.. over the last few years, he’s been talking a lot about the old days--especially about Kure, his home port.

Tama: Man, that brings back memories--reminds me of how I bummed around Japan right after the war.

Yurie: You're that old, Poverty God?

Tama ‘Course I am. (Sighs.) But then the economy started to pick back up, and after that I wasn’t welcome anywhere. Yep, had me some good times.

Mitsuba-maru: I know how the Yamato must feel. We all wanna go back to our home port no matter where we sank: that’s how ships are. The Yamato wants to return to Kure. So all the ships prayed to the god who was in charge of our area to let him go home, or send his soul back to port at least.

Yurie: But the god didn’t let him go home?

Mitsuba-maru: Uh-uh. Having the Yamato in his district made him feel like a big shot. He wanted the Yamato to stay put. Yeah, but then they replaced our district god after that big typhoon came through.

Yurie: Oh, yeah…

Mitsuba-maru: That’s when I decided to come all the way here and ask for my favor. I can hop from body to body of water if they’re both close enough.

Tama: It must've taken you months to get this far.

Yurie: Yeah, you’re right.

Mitsuba-maru: It wasn’t smooth sailing. This one guy drank me before I could get away. And the water froze once, and I got really drunk in some beer. (Whimpers.) Please grant my wish, Yurie.

Yurie: I’d like to make your wish come true... but I’m not sure what to do.

Ino, Shika, and Chou: Care for some help?

Yurie: When did you get here?

Chou: When wishes are made, we’re not far behind.

Ino: Bringing the Yamato back to his hometown is gonna be tough.

Shika: Or downright impossible.

Chou: Yurie, you have the ability to make Mitsuba-maru’s wish come true, if you want to.

Mitsuba-maru: Really?

Chou: But you might want to ask the Yamato how he feels about it first.

Yurie: How do I ask the Yamato?

????: Go ahead.

Yurie: We can talk through this?

????: Uh-huh.

Yurie: Okay… hello, my name’s Yurie. Um, Mr. Yamato?

Yamato: Yes? Yamato speaking.
Oh, I see. Mitsuba-maru said that? You know, I wondered where he’d been lately.

Yurie: Well, Mr. Yamato... do you wanna go back to your hometown? If there’s anything I can do to help, I’d like to. But... it’s up to you, sir.

Yamato: I do dream about Kure from time to time. After all, it’s the place where I was born.

Yurie: So…

Yamato: That said, it would be shameful for me to go back there looking like this. The people of Kure put a lot of effort into building me and they sent me out with high hopes. And now... I’ve been down here so long, I don’t even remember what I used to look like. I can’t limp into port like the shipwreck I am. It’s disgraceful. And I have a lot of friends in the ocean. Maybe it would be better for everyone if I stay put and slowly rust away… into nothing.

Mitsuba-maru: It’s not disgraceful! I mean you're only a shipwreck because you were responsible and doing your duty! Nobody thinks badly of you. You’re a hero to all of us, Yamato! We're proud of you! Please Mr. Yamato, sir! Please, tell us what you want!

Yurie: Um, Mr Yamato? There are so many people here in Japan who have never forgotten about you. Some of them are proud, because they got be a part of your crew. Coming home wouldn't just make you happy, Mr. Yamato. It would make everyone else happy, too. So I‘d really like to help you, Mr. Yamato, if you'll let me.

Yamato: You would... do that?

Yurie: Yes, Mr. Yamato! I would love to!

Ino: The Yamato's getting his wish!

Shika: Oh, this is gonna take a lot of work.

Ino: Quiet you!

Yashima: Your idea--it will take some work, but it’s not impossible. Since you’ll be returning the Yamato’s soul to Kure, and not his actual body, you'll need to try and connect with his mind.

Yurie: (Sighs in relief.) Just his soul. So, how am I supposed to connect with the Yamato’s mind?

Yashima: Well, first of all, it’s important for you to know what kind of a ship the Yamato was. How big, what he weighed, the size of his crew, why they built him. The more you know about him, the easier it'll be to connect with his mind.

Yurie: Right! Then it’s time for me to start learning about the Yamato.

Yurie: The battleship Yamato’s keel was laid in 1937. I don’t even know what a keel is.

Mitsue: What are you doing in here?

Matsuri: The Yamato?

Mitsue: From the picture at Mr. Gen’s house?

Yurie: Yeah. Hey, wanna help me out?

Mitsue: ...51, 52, 53, 154. This is about 100 meters, Yurie!

Yurie: Thank you.

Matsuri: And how long was the Yamato?

Yurie: Two hundred and sixty-three meters!

Matsuri: So it’s two and a half times longer than that.

Yurie: I can’t imagine something that big.

Matsuri: Total crew capacity: about 3000 people.

Yurie: That’s seven times more people than our school.
Um, I’m doing research on the Yamato. Could I borrow some books?

Prime Minister: Well, actually those documents are confidential. But I suppose I do owe you a bit of favor. I’ll make some calls. Yeah, it’s me. Get me the National Library.

Yurie: Guess what? The Yamato even had its very own soda fountain.

Mitsue: A soda fountain?

Yurie: Yeah, I read about it. They made soda for the crew because they’d been sailing for so long.

Mitsue: You’re kidding.

Yurie: I’m not kidding.

Mitsue: Really?

Yurie: I wouldn’t lie about soda.

Tama: Hey, Yurie… are you drawing a picture or something?

Yurie: Pretty good, huh?

Tama: Yeah, it looks just like him. Meow! I don’t think the flag said that.

Everyone: All right!

Yurie: Aww, why?
What am I reading...?

Tama Yurie! This is 260 meters!

Yurie: It was really that big?!

Yashima: So you looked up its dimensions?

Yurie: Yeah.

Yashima: It’s good to have facts and figures. But the Yamato’s feelings are the key. We need to find someone who knew him personally.

Yurie: I know someone who’d be happy to help.

Old Gen: Every now and again, we'd get a chance to fish. There'd be two, three hundred of us there, sitting on the deck, dipping our fishing lines into the water. Sardines for bait, nails for hooks. Yeah, it was something to see.

Yurie: Wow!

Old Gen:
Sometimes we'd get these tropical storms. We'd all run out onto the deck with our towels and our bars of soap and start lathering up in the rain. And just when we got ourselves covered in soap, the rain would end.

Matsuri: Sounds like a comedy.

Kenji: I must’ve heard that story a hundred times.

Yurie: I didn’t see that in any of the books I read.

Mitsue: They don’t include that stuff.

Old Gen: I tell you, even though it was meant as a weapon of war, it was still a great ship. I’m glad I got to spend part of my youth on the Yamato. (Sniffles.) I wish I could see it again.

Yurie: All right. Time to go!

Mitsue: Okinawa, huh? Cool.

Matsuri: Hey, bring me some souki soba, okay?

Yurie: I’m not going shopping.

Ino: Good luck, Yurie!

Shika: Try not to drown.

Chou: We’ll all miss you. So hurry back.

Yurie: It’s perfectly safe, I think…

Yashima: Have a safe trip.

Yurie: Thank you.

Mitsuba-maru: Ready to go?

Yurie: Kaa-mii-chuuu!

????: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Aah!

Mitsue: You know those little gods that hang out with Yurie?

Matsuri: Yeah?

Mitsue: Well, I wonder if they’re here right now.

Matsuri: Um, probably…

Ino, Shika, and Chou: But of course!

Mitsuba-maru: Hey, Yurie!

Yurie: Huh? Mitsuba-maru! You’re so much bigger than before.

Mitsuba-maru: Forgot I was a real ship, didn’t ya? Well then, all aboard! You okay?

Yurie: Mmhmm. Mr. Yamato!

Yamato: It’s a pleasure to meet you, Yurie.

Yurie: Oh, you too.

Yamato: Welcome home, Mitsuba-maru.

Mitsuba-maru: It’s good to be back.

Yurie: You’re so big.

Yamato: Bigger than you thought?

Yurie: No sir, I already knew. Wow! Now, I’m gonna float my way back up to the surface. If you’re ready, Mr. Yamato, let’s go together.

Yamato: Thank you.

Yurie: Okay, all clear up there. Yamato, rise.

Yamato: Aye-aye.

Yurie: (Giggles.) Yamato, surfacing completed!

Yamato: Ah, the wind feels exquisite!

Mitsuba-maru: Mr. Yamato!

Yamato: I owe you, Mitsuba-maru.

Mitsuba-maru: My pleasure!

Yamato: Please take care of this ocean after I’m gone.

Mitsuba-maru: What do you mean?! No way can I watch over things as well as you do! I’m just a puny fishing boat.

Yamato: You’re an excellent ship, Mitsuba-maru. You set out with a goal in mind. You reached your destination and you came home safely.

????: You’re an excellent ship! Yeah, what he said! You can do it! Don’t give up!

Mitsuba-maru: Okay!

Yamato: They’re right. Shall we, Yurie?

Yurie: Yeah, to Hiroshima and your home port, Kure. All right! Let’s go!

Yamato: Aye-aye!

Mitsuba-maru and his friends: Good-bye! See you again! Take care! Good luck! Good-bye! Please be careful!

Mitsuba-maru: Good-bye. Mr. Yamato.

Yamato: Thank you. Thank you all so much.

Yurie: Mr. Yamato, may I ask for a favor?

Old Gen: Well now, what are you doing here?

Kenji: Hey, Mr. Gen. Matsuri asked me to come.

Matsuri: I’m just the messenger. This all was Yurie’s idea. She wants to show you both something.

Old Gen: Wants to show us both something? Ow, my back!

Mitsue: Oh yeah, are you okay?

Kenji: Don’t push yourself.

Old Gen: Oh, I’m fine!

Mitsue: You'll want one of these.

Kenji: Awesome...

Old Gen: What is all this?

????: Did you feel that?

Chou: It’s him!

Mitsue: Wow!

Yurie: Ahoooy!

Kenji: It’s Hitotsubashi.

Matsuri: What is that?

Mitsue: No way…

Yurie: Why everyone’s laughing? Sorry, Mr. Yamato

Yamato: Don’t be sorry. I think it suits me.

Yurie: Oh, thank you.

Yamato: Say, is that Gen sitting over there?.

Yurie: You still remember it?

Yamato: He face rings a bell. It helps if you and I are synchronized. That boy sitting next to him, is he the one you like?

Yurie: Mr. Yamtao, that’s top secret information.

Yamato: Ha ha ha ha.
This is so much fun. It’s just like the old days.

Old Gen: Yamato, you really are one hell of a great ship.

Yamato: Good-bye, everybody. Yamato, heading home.

Old Gen: Hey, go get me the nails!

Kenji: Yeah!

Matsuri: Mr. Gen!

Old Gen: Huh?

Matsuri: So back to work?

Old Gen: Of course, I am. If I survived the Yamato, I can survive anything.

Mitsue: I guess everything else would be easy.

Kenji: Nails here.

Old Gen: Look.

Kenji: Oh, Hitotsubashi.

Yurie: Uh, yeah...

Kenji: You know, you showed us something really amazing the other day. It inspired my writing. Thank you.

Yurie: Oh, no. It was nothing.

Old Gen: Hey, are you two sweet on each other?

Yurie: Huh?

Kenji: Oh no. We’re just friends. That’s all.

Old Gen: Just as well, a man should focus on his work. Yeah, give me that board.

Kenji: Rgiht!

Mitsue: SS Yurie, please report your current status.

Matsuri: I think she is going down for the count. Over.
