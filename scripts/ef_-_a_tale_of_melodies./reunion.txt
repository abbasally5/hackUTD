  Yuko:
Hello there, young lady.

Nagi:
lt still needs some work.
My little brother can do a better job than that.

Yu:
Are you kidding? He's in elementary school.

Nagi:
honestly, would l lie to you?

yu:
All right.
My landscapes aren't bad, though. . .

Nagi:
lf you want to major in design, you're gonna have to cover all the genres.

Yu:
Drawing busts are hard. 
l don't know if they're portraits or still lifes.

Nagi:
lf you're tired of drawing busts, do you want to try a nude sketch?

Yu:
No! l'll stick to busts.

Nagi:
Make up your mind.
Idiot.

Yu:
Sorry, Nagi.

Nagi:
For what?

Yu:
After everything that's happened, l'm in no position to ask you for help.

Nagi:
l really don't like to dwell on the dumb things that get me down.
l'd rather just enjoy teaching you about art and making you a real first-class artist.

Yu:
Thank you.

Nagi:
Then you'd better hurry up and polish your skills.
Or else l'll make you sketch nudes of me.

Yu:
No.

Yu:
l'm home.

Yuko:
Welcome home, Yu-kun. I've got dinner already.

Yu:
Um, this is good.

Yuko:
Thank you, the landlord gave me some extra eggs he had.

Yu:
The landlord?

Yuko:
He said they were extra because his chickens laid so many of them.

Yu:
l see. We'll have to thank him for them.

Yuko:
He had his twin granddaughters deliver them to us.
Kei and Chihiro. 
They're identical and completely adorable! 
l hope that we can have kids like them one day.

Yu:
They're only cute when they're young.
They'll become intolerable soon enough.
Trust me on this one.

Yuko:
You're so insensitive.

Yu:
You don't need sensitivity to make a living.

Yuko:
But sensitivity is becoming more and more important in the workplace everyday.

Yu:
Huh?

Yuko:
That's what my supervisor at work told me.
It's not good to be insensitive.

Yu:
Well, I'll have you know, this insensitive employee was just offered a position after l graduate.

Yuko:
Really? That's wonderful!

Yu:
But l told him l'd have to think about it.

Yuko:
l see. You're always aiming so high, Yu-kun.

Yu:
l've stopped aiming high.

Yuko:
What?

Yu:
l'm not looking up anymore. l'm looking...forward.

Yuko:
Forward . . .?

Yu:
Yuko, are you happy?

Yuko:
Why do you ask that?

Yu:
l want to know.

Yuko:
l'm happy now.
l'm free from suffering and l'm living with someone l've always admired.
l'm not saying my past wasn't painful, but you accepted everything about me.
So, yes, I'm happy.
You saved me, you saved my life.

Yu:
Yuko. . .

Yuko:
Thank you for everything, Yu-kun.

Yu:
l just want to protect what we have now.

Yuko:
Now?

Yu:
Yeah, l want to protect you and your happiness now.
That's why l'm not aiming high or low.
lt's not a matter of "win or lose".
l want to walk forward by your side.

Yuko:
Yu-kun. . .

Yu:
Will you come with me?

Yuko:
Yes!

Yu:
Who's back there?
A child?

Yuko:
What are you doing out here so late?

Yu:
Are you from the orphanage?

Yuko:
What's your name?
My name is Yuko.
Yuko Amamiya. What's your name, little girl?

Miki:
Miki.

Yuko:
Miki?

Miki:
lt means "the future."
Miki.

Yuko:
l see.
What happened, Miki? lt's very late.

Yu:
l'll go call someone. You watch her, Yuko.

Miki:
No!
No! Don't come near me!

Yu:
They said it's typical of new kids at the orphanage. 
lt's hard to adjust.

Yuko:
l don't think it's that.
The lady at the orphanage said she arrived six months ago.
So that should be enough time for her to adjust.

Yu:
Oh, I see.

Yuko:
Miki's parents tried to commit suicide and take her with them.
She was almost killed by her own parents.
She doesn't trust anyone.
She's been avoiding human contact ever since.
She doesn't go out.
She can't even eat unless she's alone.
No one will adopt her.
She's isolated herself from everyone.

Yu:
That's so sad.

Yuko:
l guess what you said is right, maybe there's no God.
That's why there's so much pain and suffering in this world.
lf there was a god, l'd want him to make this world a more beautiful place.
The suffering would disappear.
Everyone would be kind. No more loneliness anymore.

Yu:
You're right.

Yuko:
Yu-kun?

Yu:
l wish the world could...be more...like that, like you said.
I wish there was some way I could create a world like that. 

Nagi:
Wow, Did something happen, Yu?

Yu:
No. Why do you ask?

Nagi:
Your lines are completely different.

Yu:
Something different? ln a good sense or a bad sense?

Nagi:
The doubt is gone. lt's an improvement.

Yu:
You think so?

Nagi:
You bet.
But it's still a long way from What I'll call perfect, though.

Yu:
Oh, Nagi.

Nagi:
What is it?

Yu:
Do rough sketches improve the more you practice them?

Nagi:
Not really, but it is something you should continue practicing.

Yu:
Is that so?
Hmm. Nagi, will you pose for me?

Nagi:
No way.

Yu:
Why not?

Nagi:
lt's embarrassing when you ask so formally like that.

Yu:
What the heck?

Nagi:
But l'll lend you this if you want me to.

Yu:
This is a mirror?

Nagi:
Your model doesn't need to be a woman.
You can do a self-portrait.
This is perfect, because l want to sketch, too.
Go ahead and strip down. 
No one cares that much anyway.

Yu:
I-l care!

Yuko:
Miki-chan.
Wait!
Miki-chan, l have a favor to ask you.
Would you mind helping me?
Please?

Miki:
What do you want?

Yuko:
l'm really lonely.
And all by myself right now.
l have someone that l care about, but he's at work now.
l can't be with him until he comes home at night. l'm so lonely today.

Miki:
You, weakling.
Why are you lonely if he's coming home?

Yuko:
Well, You're really strong, Miki.
And l'm not, but l'm pretty lonely right now.
Will you mind staying with me for just a little while?

Miki:
Uh-hum.

Yuko:
Thank you so much, Miki-chan.
Do you have any friends?

Miki:
No.

Yuko:
Why not?

Miki:
l don't need any.

Yuko:
But it would be fun.

Miki:
l said I don't need any.

Yuko:
l see. That makes me sad.

Miki:
Why?

Yuko:
Oh , actually, l thought we could be friends, Miki-chan.
Can we?

Miki:
I-I guess we can.

Yuko:
Really?

Miki:
Yeah.

Yuko:
Good.
Let's shake on it then.

Miki:
Eh?

Yuko:
Okay?
Please help me, Miki!
Thank you.

Miki:
Are you all better now, lady?

Yuko:
Emm, l'm not lonely anymore.

Yu:
Yuko.
You're here again.

Yuko:
Sh! She fell asleep while we were talking.

Yu:
You'll catch a cold.

Yuko:
l don't want to wake her up.
You may as well put your coat over Miki-chan ,it will help to keep her warm.

Yu:
l don't feel like it.

Yuko:
You don't need to get cranky.
Miki-chan?

Miki:
l'm scared.
My dreams. . . are very scary.

Yuko:
You're going to be fine. l'm right here beside you.

Miki:
I'm glad.

Yuko:
Good night.

Yuko:
Yu-kun, are you still awake?

Yu:
Yeah.

Yuko:
Do you mind if l join you?

Yu:
Yeah.

Yuko:
Why do you turn away from me?

Yu:
lt's warmer when we're sleeping back to back.

Yuko:
You're right. lt's warm.

Yu:
l used to sleep this way with Akane when I was a little kid.
Our house was pretty cold back then.

Yuko:
l bet it was.
Yu-kun, I heard something strange.
Did you know that Christmas is during the summer in Australia?

Yu:
lt's in the southern hemisphere.
But it's winter in July.

Yuko:
A warm sunny Christmas. l wonder what that would be like.
l'd love to see it for myself some day.

Yu:
We could decorate a tree when it's warm outside.

Yuko:
l wish a miracle would turn our Christmas into a nice warm summer.

Yu:
There's no such thing as miracles.
There's only coincidence and the inevitable and what we do.

Yuko:
You're just not a dreamer.

Yu:
Go to sleep if you want to dream.

Yuko:
Oh, Jeez.

Yu:
Good night.

Yuko:
Good night, Yu-kun.

Yuko:
Hello there, Miki-chan.

Miki:
Yuko!

Yuko:
A Dream?

Miki:
l always see them. . . but not the day that l met you.

Yuko:
Really?

Miki:
Um-hum.

Yuko:
l see. Maybe that's because you were holding my hand.

Miki:
Holding hands?

Yuko:
Do you want to try it?
How is it?

Miki:
It's so Warm.

Yuko:
You're going to be fine now.

Miki:
How about tomorrow?
Will you hold my hand tomorrow?

Yuko:
Um-hum.

Miki:
Um-hum.

Yuko:
I have the courage to live, the future l'll embrace. . .

Miki:
What're you singing?

Yuko:
It's a song that my friend played for me.
He played it when l was going through a very hard time.
l hated the world, but l heard this song.
lt was so beautiful. . .
it made me think that maybe l could love --- it moved me so much.
lt was difficult then, but l've been saved.
l can listen to this song now with a pure heart.

Miki:
Yuko. . .

Yuko:
l made the lyrics myself. But l'm not done with it.

Miki:
Sing it to me again!

Yuko:
l only have part of it.

Miki:
I don't mind.

Yuko:
Okay.
I have the courage to live. . .

Miki:
I have the courage to live. . .

Yuko:
The future l'll embrace. . .

Miki:
The future I'll embrace. . .

Yuko:
Your face has given me all of the strength. . .

Miki:
Your face has given me all of the strength. . .

Yuko:
To again believe in love. . .

Miki:
To again believe in love. . .

Yu:
You're with that kid again?

Miki:
l'm not just a kid. My name is Miki.

Yuko:
Yu-kun, I want you to hold out your hand.

Yu:
Why.

Miki:
Here!

Yuko:
Aren't you lucky? With both of us holding your hands, you'll be fine.

Miki:
Yeah!

Yuko:
No more crying?

Miki:
l don't know.

Yuko:
I think little girls should be cheerful all the time.

Miki:
Why?

Yuko:
lf you look sad because you're feeling down, then you'll really be sad.
But if you smile, it starts to take over and you'll discover eventually that all the sadness disappears.

Miki:
Really?

Yuko:
Um-hum.
So why don't we try to smile for a bit.

Miki:
Okay! l won't cry.

Yu:
l want to build a beautiful town.
Not just cover up the rubble with a nice facade, but a truly beautiful town. . .where people are kind and there's no loneliness.
A happy town with a future.

Yuko:
Yu-kun. . .
I know you can.
You'll do it someday.

Yuko:
l'm glad that we were albe to cheer Miki-chan up.

Yu:
lt's from Kuze in Germany.

Yuko:
Kuze-san? What did he say?

Yu:
German girls are the best.
And he'll be home for Christmas.

Yuko:
For Christmas?

Yu:
But he'll be busy with his girlfriends and it's more than likely he won't have time for us.

Yuko:
yu-kun, do we have any plans for Christmas?
I was thinking, lf you were free, we. . .

Yu:
l work all day on Christmas. 
l have to leave earlier than usual to set up.

Yuko:
Oh, l see. . .

Yu:
But l asked them if they mind it, then they're gonna let me off early.
Do you wanna go somewhere?

Yuko:
Yes!

Yu:
We could meet at that old church.
l'll go there straight from work.
You shouldn't take me too long.

yuko:
Good! l'll be there first and wait for you.
And I hope you won't be late.

Nagi:
Well, look at that.
Spending Christmas with Yuko-chan, lover boy?

Yu:
Nagi.

Nagi:
Flowers, huh? 
I have to tell you, it doesn't suit you at all.

Yu:
Mind your own business.

Nagi:
But I do think, Yuko-chan will get a kick out of it.

Yu:
Do you Really think so?

Nagi:
Yeah. Flowers are pretty much her style.

Shuichi:
Can l help you, young lady?

Miki:
That song . . .

Shuichi:
Did you like it?

Miki:
Um-hum.

Shuichi:
Good.
There! You look even cuter that way, kiddo.

Miki:
Really?

Shuichi:
Um-hum.

Miki:
Thank you!

Yuko:
Did I get here too early?
Oh. . .Look.

Yu:
Do you plan on following me forever?

Nagi:
l want to hear what you're going to say when you give her the flowers.
I think I would be funny.

Yu:
That's mean.

Nagi:
l'm joking. l wouldn't dream of interfering or making fun.

Yu:
Honestly. . .
Miki! What's wrong?

Miki:
Look up there!

Nagi:
Angel's stairs.

Yu:
Angel's stairs?

Nagi:
They say angels go up and down those shafts of light, traveling between heaven and earth.

Yuko:
There's so much more l want to say. . .
l want you to know more...more about me...Yu-kun.
I have the courage to live. . . the future l'll embrace. . .
Your face has given me all of the strength. . .to again believe in love. . .
l want to see you one more time. . .


Love, l've got to feel it
lf you put your trust in me
l know what my life would be
Oh, you are all l ever need
l try to hear what you say
So l pray
But you're fading away
Don't go and break my fragile heart
We won't fall apart
'Cause you're my only star
l wonder why my tears come at night
Calling you, so like a little child
All the things you have in mind
l wish l could see your insides
My love, you've got to feel it
And if we put our trust in you and me
You know what our lives would be
Oh, you are the one l believe

Yuko:
lt feels like our reunion happened ages ago.
At least it feels that way to me.

Yu:
Yes, it does.

Yuko:
And soon, it will be eons ago.

Yu:
No, it won't.

Yuko:
l'd really like you to hold onto this for me from now on.

Yu:
Me?

Yuko:
This was a place for me to be alone and feel safe.
No one would see me if l was sad or cried.
But l'm not alone anymore and l won't cry ever again.

Yu:
Yuko. . .

Yuko:
l want to get rid of it, so I won't ever be turned to look back on that sadness.
And this way I'm giving it to someone who really needs it.

Yu:
Okay. l'll hold onto it.

l hope my wish reaches him. . .

Can you hear the melody of truth?
