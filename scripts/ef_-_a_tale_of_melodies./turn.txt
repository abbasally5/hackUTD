Shuuichi:
I survived.

Mizuki:
You’re still alive. Please!
Ah, it’s hot!
Can I have a reward?

Shuuichi:
The second movement.

Hiro:
Crap! I don’t have any choice. It’s my last resort.



Why… why does everyone have to die?

Shuuichi:
A cold?

Renji:
Yea. Mizuki’s been feverish all morning.

Shuuichi:
I see. Well, I brought over some ice cream with me. I never really intended it to be a get-well treat. There’s enough for all of us if you’d like some.

Renji:
Thank you, I’d love some.

Shuuichi:
So how’s Mizuki-chan doing?

Renji:
Oh she’s going to be fine. She was just feeling a little under the weather.
She took some medicine so she’s sleeping right now.

Shuuichi:
I see. Well then I’ll just look in on her and I’ll be heading home.
I’m so sorry. Get some rest today.

Mizuki:
Help- help me.

Shuuichi:
Mizuki-chan?

Mizuki:
Help me. Please.

Shuuichi:
Good morning, my princess.

Mizuki:
Kuze-san?

Shuuichi:
Are you okay?

Mizuki:
Yes. An angel’s smiling down on me.

Shuuichi:
Your Renji will find out.

Mizuki:
It’s just artificial respiration.

Shuuichi:
Artificial respiration?

Mizuki:
Of course. Yesterday’s kiss was a reward, this is just artificial respiration.



Yuuko:
Himura-senpai. Sorry to keep you waiting.

Yuu:
You’re late.

Yuuko:
I’m so sorry. I overslept. I was so nervous I couldn’t sleep.
I finally managed a little this morning. Maybe I was just nervous.
Kind of endearing, wouldn’t you say so?

Yuu:
Alright, c’mon. Let’s go. I don’t wanna waste any more time today on your nonsense.

Yuuko:
Okay. Where do you think we should go for lunch?

Yuu:
Huh? We’re going shoe-shopping. Who said anything about us having lunch together?

Yuuko:
Well then why do you think I would want to meet up with you at noon?

Yuu:
I’m sorry but I don’t usually eat lunch.

Yuuko:
You may not but I sure do.



Yuuko:
I always wanted to come here. Don’t you just love the atmosphere?

Yuu:
Yea I guess so.

Yuuko:
Well you don’t have to act all angry about it. Is it not your kind of place?

Yuu:
I’m not mad. I just don’t have any interest in eating out anywhere.

Yuuko:
There has to be some reason that you don’t want to eat out.

Yuu:
It’s expensive.

Yuuko:
Oh I see. Well don’t worry. This will be my treat. I don’t mind.

Yuu:
Don’t be ridiculous.
Look. It’s not that I don’t ever eat out. I'd just rather save all my money for tuition.

Yuuko:
Tuition? Are you planning to go to college?

Yuu:
Yea, I want to, now that all my bridges are burned. I’m scraping the bottom, but there’s nowhere to go from here but up.

Yuuko:
You’re really amazing. You know that, Himura-senpai? You never seem to give up no matter what.

Yuu:
It’s not like that. Not like I have anything to lose. So I don’t have to waste all my time worrying about things like failing. That’s all there is to it.

Yuuko:
So does that mean you think you’re not drawing any more then?

Yuu:
Huh? Wait a minute. Are you conspiring with Amamiya?

Yuuko:
No way. That’s not why I’m asking.

Yuu:
No matter what anyone says, I have no intention of drawing.

Yuuko:
That wasn’t my intention at all.
I just- I always love your drawing. That’s what I meant to say.

Yuu:
That was just child’s play. I can’t make a living off of it.

Yuuko:
I see then. Okay, are you ready to go?

Yuu:
What about lunch?

Yuuko:
I think that I’ll skip lunch too.

Yuu:
Wait. Why should you skip lunch?

Yuuko:
Well, if you’re not going to have lunch, then I just don’t think I feel like eating either.

Yuu:
Talk about wasting money.



Yuuko:
I love my new shoes.

Yuu:
After all that, you bought the same ones as before.

Yuuko:
These are my new favorites.

Yuu:
They’re pretty cheap.

Yuuko:
But they may end up being trashed again.

Yuu:
Are you sure you don’t want me to trash those bullies?

Yuuko:
If you scare them, then they’ll be traumatized for life, Himura-senpai.

Yuu:
I’m feeling the urge to trash you.

Yuuko:
Wahhhh! Noooo! Oh now are you going to bully me too, Himura-senpai?

Yuu:
Yuuko, is that how you wanna live?

Yuuko:
Huh?

Yuu:
Laughing off hardship like it’s some kind of a joke.
You do realize you’ll only wind up fooling yourself in the end, you know. Are you okay with that?

Yuuko:
I’m having fun right now and that’s good enough for me.
Besides, thanks to them, I was able to go on my first date with you.

Yuu:
But that’s just living for the moment. Hey, wait a minute! This isn’t a date.

Yuuko:
Too late to say that. I’ve decided that this is a date for me.

Yuu:
Just stop saying that.

Yuuko:
I want to know something. Is it your first date for you too, senpai?

Yuu:
Uhmm…

Yuuko:
So it is your first time.

Yuu:
I haven’t said anything.

Yuuko:
That makes me happy. I’m so glad.

Yuu:
Wait. Stop!

Yuuko:
The first time for both of us. That will make it so much more memorable.

Yuu:
Argh. Say whatever you want.

Yuuko:
Himura-senpai.

Yuu:
What is it?

Yuuko:
One more thing. There’s some place that I would really like for us to go and see.



Yuuko:
Wow, this place hasn’t changed at all.
Hey, did I- say something to upset you again?

Yuu:
You forced me to come here after all these years. What did you expect?

Yuuko:
I’ve always wanted to come back here.

Yuu:
This must belong to the orphanage. The kids were probably playing out here.

Yuuko:
I guess there’ll always be kids who don’t listen to the teacher.

Yuu:
What are you insinuating?

Yuuko:
You used to be a little boy here who always kept trying to run away from the orphanage.

Yuu:
If my memory serves, that kid was always accompanied by another runaway.

Yuuko:
A pair of cute fugitives.

Yuu:
The interior hasn’t changed either. Huh?

Akira:
Hello there.

Yuuko:
Brother.

Yuu:
Amamiya-sensei. What are you doing here?

Akira:
Yuuko so rarely goes out and I was wondering what she was up to. Now I know.

Yuu:
You’ve got it all wrong. This’s been a misunderstanding.

Akira:
Ah, to once again be young…

Yuu:
Are you here to worship? I’m actually surprised to find out you’re a Christian. I wouldn’t think you were.

Akira:
Oh, not me. But my sister definitely is.

Yuu:
Your sister?

Akira:
Yuuko, catch!

Yuuko:
Ah, geez.

Akira:
Himura-kun, I’d love to know if you and Yuuko have already had sex.

Yuu:
Urg… what are you talking about?

Akira:
A small word of warning to you.

Yuu:
I swear we haven’t.

Akira:
If you want Yuuko, I feel it’s only fair to warn you that you better be prepared.

Yuu:
Prepared?

Akira:
If you touch her without being prepared, I have no doubt that you’ll regret it.

Yuu:
That’s not my intention.

Akira:
Well, whatever your intention is, it looks like you’re already crossing the line.

Yuuko:
Hey, what was he talking about?

Yuu:
Oh, just his usual nonsense. Hey, I didn’t know you were a Christian.

Yuuko:
Oh I’m not.

Yuu:
But he just said that his sister is a Christian.

Yuuko:
Well, he’s not talking about me. My brother and you are very similar, Himura-senpai.
He doesn’t talk about it, but he lost his sister in the earthquake too.

Yuu:
Him too?

Yuuko:
It’s so sad. He’s a very lonely person.



Yuu:
What is this? An ambush?

Nagi:
“Ambush” is not a very nice word to use.

Yuu:
Why are you wearing your uniform on your day off?

Nagi:
Oh I hardly ever change out of this thing.

Yuu:
Not even at home?

Nagi:
I can’t be bothered.

Yuu:
What about after you take a bath?

Nagi:
I don’t wear anything. I’m only going to sleep.

Yuu:
But you have a brother who lives at home.

Nagi:
I have a brother and a father at the house. It doesn’t matter. They’re both artists.

Yuu:
Artists are so eccentric.

Nagi:
Guess what? Amamiya-sensei was just over at my house.

Yuu:
Amamiya?

Nagi:
He studied art under my father. So he comes over to our house sometimes. He really doesn’t draw any more.

Yuu:
But he’s an art teacher.

Nagi:
I know, but he just really hasn’t been able to draw anything since the earthquake.

Yuu:
I see. So he’s a stubborn idiot as well.
What’s wrong?

Nagi:
He told me something strange. He said that he saw you and Yuuko on a date today.
Is that true? You didn’t have to tell me, but I didn’t like hearing something like that from him.
I mean we are friends after all. And I would think that you could come tell me something like that.
Why would you wanna hide things from me like that? I don’t understand why you’re doing this.
I think you should tell me how you feel, and all this time…

Yuu:
Wait. Slow down a second.

Nagi:
Oh sorry.

Yuu:
I just went shopping with her. It’s just like you dragging me around. It’s not a date.
Why would something silly like that bother you anyway, Nagi?
What’s wrong with you?

Nagi:
I’m starting to hate you right now.

Yuu:
Huh? What’s with her?



Shuuichi:
Me lecturing you or you lecturing me, which do you think is more like old times, my friend?

Yuu:
I have no interest in playing game with you.
I didn’t do anything. You’re the one who led Mizuki on.

Shuuichi:
I didn’t lead her on.

Yuu:
But you instigated it.

Shuuichi:
She made her own decision. I just provided guidance like a good older brother.

Yuu:
Let’s go. Your results come out today.



Nagi:
What do you want me to start working on next?

Hiro:
You finished already?

Nagi:
You’re too slow, baby brother. Is this what you want me to do?

Hiro:
No, not that. I’m gonna draw the people.

Nagi:
Think you’ll make your deadline that way?

Hiro:
My pride’s at stake.

Nagi:

If you have time to complain, get to working or else I’ll draw all of it for you.

Hiro:
I’ll pay you an assistant’s fee.

Nagi:
No thanks. I make more money than you anyway.

Hiro:
I’ll recognize you under this Special Thanks then.

Nagi:
No need. I’m just tracing your wimpy lines.
If people thought it was my work, I’d be sick to my stomach.

Hiro:
I’m the one who feels sick here.

Nagi:
Never mind. Just keep drawing. I need to go to Australia soon anyway.
Hiro, you went ahead and quit school without even consulting me.
You decided on your own to become a manga artist, and that’s all there is to it.

Hiro:
I’m sorry.

Nagi:
I’m not blaming you. I applaud you.

Hiro:
You do?

Nagi:
Yes, but you have to be accountable for your own decisions. I’ll help you any time you need.
But it’s your job to toil. So toil away, kiddo.

Hiro:
That girl.

Miyako:
Aw, it’s the same response again?
That boy is so unoriginal. So then, I wonder what I should make that boy for dinner today.

Yuuko:
So you’re fine now?

Miyako:
I can’t say that I don’t feel lonely from time to time.
But now I have to support Hiro and that makes things better.
I feel like I belong.

Yuuko:
You’ve gotten stronger.

Miyako:
It’s because I have somewhere to go home to.
But when I had nothing, I thought I was stronger because I had nothing to lose.
Maybe I don’t need this any more.



Yuu:
Is this the one you want, Akane?

Akane:
No. I’m just looking at it.

Yuu:
Akane?

Akane:
It’s cold all by myself.

Yuu:
Take it off when you go to sleep.

Akane:
No.

Yuu:
You like it that much?

Akane:
Yes. You wanted to buy pinks, didn’t you?

Yuu:
No way.

Akane:
Liar.

Yuu:
I’m not.

Akane:
Thank you. I’ll take good care of it. Good night.

Yuu:
Good night.
Earthquake! Akane, where are you?

Akane:
Brother- brother…

Yuu:
Akane- Akane…

Akane:
Brother, where are you?



Shuuichi:
Thanks for coming with me today.

Yuu:
Not a problem. You want a drink?

Shuuichi:
No. You need to go home and try to get some rest.
Chihiro-chan is waiting for you, isn’t she?

Yuu:
I guess I should. Do you need anything?

Shuuichi:
Yes. Get me a calendar.

Yuu:
A calendar?
Hey Kuze, are you scared?

Shuuichi:
You really wanna ask me that now?

Yuu:
Yea. I’m asking you now.

Shuuichi:
Of course I’m scared.



Mizuki:
Sorry I was sleeping most of the day yesterday.

Shuuichi:
I’m the one who should be saying “I’m sorry.” I made you catch a cold.

Mizuki:
What did you spend your day doing?

Shuuichi:
Spent the entire day thinking about you.

Mizuki:
Guh, how can you say that with such a straight face?

Shuuichi:
There’s nothing else I’d rather think about right now.
Wait a minute. I need to send this to be repaired.

Mizuki:
I’m feeling very victorious as a woman right about now.

Shuuichi:
I’m sure it would irritate some people if they saw us together like this.

Mizuki:
I thought musicians were supposed to be romantic.

Shuuichi:
I’m a retired musician.

Mizuki:
Then I think that maybe you should try acting a little bit more like a lover.

Shuuichi:
We’re not lovers.

Mizuki:
[Can’t/Could] we… become lovers?

Shuuichi:
Mizuki-chan, I wasn’t joking when I told you I was dying.

Mizuki:
I know.

Shuuichi:
We won’t be able to keep doing this for much longer.

Mizuki:
Are you going to be hospitalized?

Shuuichi:
Eventually. That’s why I’m settling my accounts now.

Mizuki:
Settling accounts?

Shuuichi:
Starting with all of my relationships, then there’s all the paperwork that I need to take care of.
That violin was the last item.

Mizuki:
Can I ask you a kind of personal question?

Shuuichi:
Go ahead.

Mizuki:
I’m afraid to ask, but I’d like to know if you were seeing someone.

Shuuichi:
Yes. I loved her and she loved me. We were engaged. That’s why I broke it off.

Mizuki:
I’m so sorry.

Shuuichi:
It’s a sunshower.



Nagi:
Hey, Miya-chan.

Miyako:
Here’s dinner. Um…where’s Hiro?

Nagi:
He just finished his manuscript and completely collapsed.

Miyako:
Then give him this when he wakes up. I made enough for you too.

Nagi:
Thanks. You don’t wanna eat with us?

Miyako:
Oh just let him sleep. He’ll be making it up to me for the rest of his life. I’m sure!

Nagi:
I’m sure he will. I’ll make sure and give him a hard time for you if you want me to.

Miyako:
Uh-huh.



Yuu:
I’m shocked. I’ve never seen him with his guard down like this.

Mizuki:
Himura-san.

Yuu:
I assume you’ve heard about his condition.

Mizuki:
Yes.

Yuu:
If you go on like this, it’s going to be difficult.

Mizuki:
You’re right, but I can handle it.

Yuu:
Humans are the only creatures who can mark the day they’re going to die on a calendar.

Mizuki:
Huh?

Yuu:
I don’t know if it’s better than losing him suddenly or if it’s all a bad joke.

Mizuki:
Himura-san. I don’t understand how you can be so calm about it.

Yuu:
Believe me. I’m well acquainted with what death can do to a person.

Mizuki:
Was it the earthquake?
Are you unafraid because you’re used to it?

Yuu:
Just the opposite. I’m petrified. I know how it feels so if I don’t make light of it, I’ll suffocate.
But I’ve seen people, even towns. They’ve clawed their way out of the rubble.
This’s been much harder for you than I expected. I’m terribly sorry. Forgive me.

Mizuki:
It’s alright, but thank you, I appreciate it.

Yuu:
You can punch me out if you change your mind.

Mizuki:
Hmm… Himura-san.

Yuu:
What’s that?

Mizuki:
Will you- will you do that thing for me? "May God bless you," and then you say…

Yuu:
I’m not a pastor or a priest.

Mizuki:
But you look good doing it.

Yuu:
May the Force be with you always.

Mizuki:
Is that some kind of a good thing?

Yuu:
It’s…. better than God.



Shuuichi:
Mizuki-chan? Mizuki-chan?
Are you up?

Mizuki:
Huh? When did I fall asleep?
I guess that means there are no more sunshowers.

Shuuichi:
Huh?

Mizuki:


Shuuichi:
I’ll just pretend I didn’t notice.
Mizuki-chan, what do you want to be in the future?

Mizuki:
Huh? Well, I haven’t decided but I do know I want to be totally happy.

Shuuichi:
I see. I have feelings for you too.
That’s why I can’t allow this to go on any longer.
Just go, leave me alone. I don’t ever want to see you or hear from you again.

----- Ending -----

Fine.

Words of atonement. Hearts intertwined.
