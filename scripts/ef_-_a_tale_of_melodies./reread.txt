  Yu:
I hope that you can cry in my place.

Nagi:
This is. . .

Yu:
Where everything started and ended.

--opening--
Love, l've got to feel it
lf you put your trust in me
l know what my life would be
Oh, you are all l ever need
No one can stand in your way
Here l say
There'll be another day
Won't cry and get rid of scars
Always in my heart
Gotta find a way to start
l wonder why my tears come at night
Calling you, so like a child
All the things you have in mind
l wish l could see your insides
My love, you've got to feel it
And if we put our trust in you and me
You know what our lives would be
Oh, you are the one l believe

Shuichi:
This is so childish. . .
So why do l feel so relieved?
l discarded her. Settled my accounts.
What am l expecting?
Where's the Kuze that never loses?
He never existed.
lf you go, you'll hurt her.
lf you hurt her, you'll hurt yourself.
You know this.
l can't ignore it if l want to live.
You're going to die soon.
But l'm still alive.
You're going there to lose? To hurt her?
You'll hurt everyone in the end.
Even so. . . l . . . l . . .
Get out!
Get out of my sight!
l want. . .I want to see her!
I'm going.

Mizuki:
Welcome back.
Take that!

Shuichi:
What the hell was that all about?

Mizuki:
l sent you a declaration of challenge.

Shuichi:
Huh?

Mizuki:
And so now, you've already died once.

Shuichi:
Huh?

Mizuki:
They say, "even death won't cure a fool."
But I hope it [wasn't for] you.
So how did it feel to die?
Greetings to the new and reborn Shuichi Kuze-san.
And I think you already know who I am.
Kuze-san, you were wrong when you said falling in love is for losers.

Shuichi:
Huh?

Mizuki:
In real life, experiencing love makes you a winner.
And now, I've got my answers for you prepare today.

Shuichi:
Answers?

Mizuki:
You asked me lots of questions.
But l'm ready to answer them today.

Shuichi:
Why are you standing in front of me?

Mizuki:
That's simple.
l'm standing in front of you because l love you.

Shuichi:
Why are you talking to me?

Mizuki:
Again, l'm talking to you because l love you.
l follow you around because l love you.
l care about you because l love you.
l won't leave you alone because l love you.
l smile because l love you.
l meddle in your business because l love you.
l'm cheerful because l love you.
l'm not crying because l love you.
I'm forgiving because l love you.
I care because l love you.
l'm contented because l love you.
I'm happy, and upbeat, and elated, and joyful, all because l love you.
It's because I love you so much.
l may hurt you and confuse you at times.
l may trouble you or even make you suffer now and then.
But all of that is only because l love you.
lt's all, all, all because l love you so much.
And that's my answer to you.

Shuichi:
l'm going to die.

Mizuki:
l know.

Shuichi:
My body will deteriorate.

Mizuki:
l know.

Shuichi:
l won't be able to make you happy.

Mizuki:
You're wrong.
l will be happy if I'm with you.
And then, when the time finally comes, l'll make sure that you die happy.
So, please take the chance and come with me.

Shuichi:
Mizuki-chan. . .

Mizuki:
People and things don't last forever, no matter how precious they are to us.
Relationships, feelings, memories, souls and even life.
Nothing lasts forever.
Everything breaks eventually.
Happiness is fake --- it's a sham, a farce.
It's like a bad joke in the end.
And that's why. . .that's why...

Shuichi:
That's the reason l tried to settle my accounts.

Mizuki:
No, silly, that's why we should treasure it.
So there are no regrets when we face the inevitable.
lt's bound to break, so we should handle it with great care.

Shuichi:
Why?
Why me?

Mizuki:
That's easy, it's because you're you!
To be honest, you should feel lucky l fell in love with you.
So just give in and be happy already!

Shuichi:
l see then. 
Okay, I will.

Mizuki:
Kuze-san!

Shuichi:
Come here.

Mizuki:
Owww!

Shuichi:
That was for what you did to me earlier.

Mizuki:
You're so mean! This was supposed to be a "tender kiss" moment!
Kuze-san. . .?
Kuze-san!

Mizuki:
How is he?

Yu:
He's going to make it.
But he's definitely not out of danger.
The next attack will probably be his last.

Mizuki:
But. . . isn't there anything they can do?
Like surgery or something?

Yu:
lf that was an option, he would've done it already.

Nagi:
The chances of a successful operation are very slim.
He could even die on the table.

Yu:
And even if he makes it, the 3-year survival rate is less than 50%.
The risk is too high considering the prognosis.

Mizuki:
Oh, No. . .

Mizuki:
l won't cry. l won't cry.
No matter what, I can't.
l made a promise to Yuko.
Hello?

Hiro:
hey, is it Hayama?

Mizuki:
Hiro-senpai?

Hiro:
Yeah, it's me, l heard from Kei.
Are you all right?

Mizuki:
Of course!
You know me, l'm always full of energy!

Hiro:
That's good. l'm a Shuichi Kuze fan, too.
Please give him my regards.

Mizuki:
Okay. Will do.

Hiro:
And . . . well. . . how should l put this?
You...Hang in there too, okay?

Mizuki:
Okay, thank you very much, Hiro-senpai.

Hiro:
Okay, Bye.

Kei:
Mizuki!

Mizuki:
Kei! Chihiro!

Kei:
Are you all right?

Chihiro:
lt must be so hard for you, but try not to be depressed.

Mizuki:
l'm gonna be fine. 
Every time l'm feel a little bit down, someone always turns up to support me and make me happy again.
Like I know, l just got a big charge of energy from the two of you, so you see, l'm gonna be fine!

Kei:
That's good.

Mizuki:
Yeah, it is!

Kei:
There was someone who gave me a lift when l was down, too.

Mizuki:
Tsutsumi-senpai, right?

Kei:
Are you kidding? No! A woman with long hair.
She was beautiful.
Tsutsumi-senpai told me later that she had spoken to him too.
Because of her and that conversation, l decided to keep running.

Tsutsumi:
Because of her and what she told me, I found something precious.

Miyako:
Because of her, I found a home, a place to call my own.

Shuichi:
How much time...l wonder how much longer l have left.

Mizuki:
Kuze-san. . .

Shuichi:
l'm sorry about everything.
Victory is meaningless, if you've known all along you're going to win.
That's why l was able to discard everything so easily.

Mizuki:
Kuze-san. . .

Shuichi:
l finally realized it's okay to lose.
And if something can be gained by it,
it's even more valuable than victory.
And that's something I learnt from you, Mizuki.

Mizuki:
Kuze-san. . .

Shuichi:
l'll take the risk.
l mean, the surgery.

Mizuki:
But it's. . .

Shuichi:
The odds are against me.
Even if l win, my life won't be prolonged by much.
But if it will buy me one more second with you, it's worth the fight.

Mizuki:
Kuze-san. . .

Shuichi:
This is the first time l'm taking on a losing battle.

Mizuki:
Kuze-san, in order to make a dream come true, you have to set out by having a dream of your own first.
lf you give up,then nothing will happen.
So you have to keep on believing.
That's the first step towards achieving your dream.

Shuichi:
Those words. . .

Mizuki:
l love these words.
As long as you keep believing and never give up, your dreams will come true.

Shuichi:
Okay. l'll keep on believing.

Mizuki:
Great!

Miyako:
lt's you!

Hiro:
lt's been a while. 
Do you remember me?
Was it last Christmas when we first met?
You said you were waiting here for someone.
Did he ever show up to meet you?
l see.

Miyako:
ls there anything that we can do for you?
We'd like to repay you someway if we could.

Hiro:
You helped us.

Miyako:
You changed our lives.

Hiro:
we made our decision, thanks to your advice.

Miyako:
We've moved forward, and it's all thanks to you.

Hiro & Miyako:
Thank you.
Thank you.

Hiro:
My name is Hiro Hirono.

Miyako:
And my name is Miyako Miyamura.

Hiro:
What's your name?

Yuko:
Yuko.
Yuko Amamiya.

Shuichi:
Himura, Nagi, let's go have a drink when this is over.

Nagi:
Year round.

Yu:
I look forward to it.
But you are the one treating.

Renji:
Kuze-san, you can do it.

Shuichi:
There are no such things as miracles.
There's only the inevitable and accidental. And what we do.
So l'll just have to make a miracle inevitable.

Renji:
Kuze-san.

Mizuki:
Kuze-san, here.

Shuichi:
Don't worry, l'll be coming back.

Mizuki:
I know.
You'll be fine.

Shuichi:
Thank you.

Seasons recur. Will my thoughts reach you?
ef: a tale of melodies -- forever.
Can you hear the melody of truth?
