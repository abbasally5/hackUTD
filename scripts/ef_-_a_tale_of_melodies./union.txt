Yuu:
Again?
She’s an idiot!

Akira:
Well, Himura-kun.

Yuu:
Amamiya-sensei.

Akira:
Now why would you have such a grim look on a beautiful morning like this?
I know. Why don’t you find something to help turn that youthful frustration of yours into creative energy?
Running into you here is a good opportunity.

Yuu:
I have no interest in joining the art department.

Akira:
You’re so [stubborn/stern]. I just want your artistic talents to blossom and grow as they should.

Yuu:
How many times do I have to tell you? I have no interest in art at all.
I’m in a rush. Excuse me.

Yuuko:
Oh it’s you, brother.
I didn’t expect to find you standing here, brother.

Yuu:
Why do you keep insisting on calling me brother?

Akira:
Oh it’s good to see you, Yuuko.
I’m just trying my hardest to awaken a dormant vein of gold here.

Yuuko:
A vein of gold? Are you talking about Yuu-kun, brother?

Yuu:
You mean Amamiya-sensei’s your brother?

Yuuko:
Didn’t I mention that to you already? My last name is Amamiya. Yuuko Amamiya is my full name.

Yuu:
It’s Yuuko… Amamiya?

Akira:
It’s fascinating that the two of you know each other.
I’m very interested in the extent of your relationship, but I guess I’ll have to just wait for another time.
Okay, students. It’s time for classes. Study hard.

Yuuko:
Well, you’re the one who need to study hard, Mr. Scholarship.

Yuu:
Alright, that’s enough.
Hey Yuuko.

Yuuko:
What is it?

Yuu:
What happened to your indoor shoes?

Yuuko:
I’m not sure. I found out that they were missing when I got to school this morning.
I guess it really can’t be helped.

Yuu:
Hey.

Yuuko:
Yes?

Yuu:
Go ask in the teacher’s office. They’ll lend you slippers.

Yuuko:
Thank you. You’re so kind to me, Yuu-kun.

Yuu:
Just wait here.
Here you go. You can wear these.

Yuuko:
Oh, you didn’t have to go to so much trouble for me.

Yuu:
If you walk around barefoot, you’ll end up hurting yourself and I’ll feel bad about it.

Yuuko:
Really? That’s nice of you to do that for me.
Thank you very much, Yuu-kun.



Mizuki:
Kuze-san, are you in?
It’s Sumire from next door. Are you in there, Kuze-san?



Yuu:
Excuse me.

Akira:
Oh Himura-kun, do you mind if I finish this cigarette? I just lit it and I hate to waste it.

Yuu:
No, it’s not a problem.

Akira:
There’s nowhere else I can smoke in peace any more.

Yuu:
What do you want from me?
I won’t join the art department no matter what you say to me.

Akira:
No. This is about Yuuko.
Before we adopted her, she was at a church-run orphanage. Were you at the same facility?

Yuu:
Yes.

Akira:
She seems very close to you. Were the two of you childhood friends, so to speak?

Yuu:
I wouldn’t say that we were that close. She left the orphanage fast.
Not long after the earthquake.

Akira:
Um… well, this is the real reason I called you in here.
I’d like you to ask Hirono not to pose in the nude in the art room any more.
It’s becoming something of a problem.
A complaint’s come to me. You see, while I could demand it, I think she’ll listen to you more readily,
If you follow what I’m saying.

Yuu:
I’ll be going.

Akira:
Wait a minute, Himura-kun.



Mizuki:
This looks exactly like the one in Japan.
You’ll be scolded for sitting up there.

Yuu:
By whom?

Mizuki:
Um… God?

Yuu:
There’s no such thing.

Mizuki:
Then what are you doing in a church?

Yuu:
Adults have issues.

Mizuki:
And you make it sound like young people don’t have any at all.

Yuu:
You’re right. I’m sure that I had more issues when I was a young person.

Mizuki:
Don’t you remember?

Yuu:
No. I forgot.
But adults, after all, are just grown-up children in my experience.
So you’re Renji’s cousin.

Mizuki:
How did you know?

Yuu:
I know just about everything in this town.

Mizuki:
You really do?

Yuu:
Yes.

Mizuki:
Then do you happen to know the musician named Kuze?

Yuu:
I do.

Mizuki;
Really? That’s wonderful.
I was supposed to meet him today but he didn’t answer his door.
But I don’t know where he could’ve gone off to. Anyway, I’m looking for him.
Do you know where he went?

Yuu:
I’m not Kuze’s keeper, young lady.

Mizuki:
But you said you knew everything, didn’t you?

Yuu:
Let me give you a word of warning.
Don’t get involved with him, but if you do, be prepared.



Yuu:
Hey Kuze, you pretty much know all the girls at our school right?

Shuuichi:
What are you implying?
I know plenty of girls outside the school as well.

Yuu:
Do you happen to know any freshman? Preferably one who has a little discretion.

Shuuichi:
It wouldn’t be all that bad to have you in my debt before I leave.

Yuu:
I’m not talking about being in your debt, Kuze.

Shuuichi:
I’m not following you then. What’s the problem?

Yuu:
Something’s been bothering me for a while.

Nagi:
What are you two troublemakers up to?

Yuu:
Huh? Nagi. What are you doing here?

Nagi:
I saw you guys from the art room. Both of you, out of view, and looking like you were up to no good.

Yuu:
How rude. We were just hanging out here cementing our friendship. It’s what friends do, right?

Nagi:
Well, then why don’t you include me in that circle?
Don’t worry, I’m very discreet, if I do say so myself.

Yuu:
Or in your case, it might be that you have no friends to gossip with.
I’m sorry, that was uncalled for.

Nagi:
You’re forgiven.

Yuu:
You’re so quick to forgive.

Nagi:
Well, you know me. I always hate dragging things on unnecessarily

Shuuichi:
So basically, what you’re asking me to do is to spy on Yuuko during her classes. Correct?

Yuu:
Try to do it discreetly.

Shuuichi:
No problem. I’m happy to. No one will steal her shoes with me watching out for her.

Nagi:
Hmm. I get it.

Yuu:
Huh, what’s wrong, Nagi? Hey, wait up. Where are you going, Nagi? Come back.
What is it, Nagi?

Nagi:
That’s what you’re looking for?
Yuu, give me a boost up there.
Just move a little bit more to the right.

Yuu:
Hey Nagi. What are you doing without any shoes on?

Nagi:
Use your head, idiot. I was upstairs in the art room sketching just now.

Yuu:
You came down without shoes?

Nagi:
I was kind of in a rush. I just threw on this lab coat.

Yuu:
Get off. Right now. Get down.

Nagi:
Stand still. I almost got them.
They’re probably Yako’s.

Shuuichi:
It’s Yuuko with a long u.

Nagi:
Names over two syllables are just awkward.

Yuu:
How did you know that they were up there?

Nagi:
Believe it or not. I’ve had similar experiences on more than one occasion.

Yuu:
Really?

Nagi:
I can tell you one thing for sure. No one does that without malice.
She should be very careful and watch out for herself.

Shuuichi:
And I can tell you one more thing, my friend. You should really hurry up and deliver those shoes to her.



Chihiro:
I’m sorry. Trains don’t stop here any more.

Mizuki:
It’s been a while.

Chihiro:
Huh?

Mizuki:
You’re Chihiro-senpai, right?

Chihiro:
Oh yes, my name is Chihiro Shindou.

Mizuki:
I’m Mizuki Hayama. I used to play with Kei-senpai back when we were little.
I’m pretty sure we’ve met. Do you remember me?

Chihiro:
Mizuki-chan?

Mizuki:
That’s me! I’m Mizuki-chan.

Chihiro:
Wow, you’ve got so big.

Mizuki:
Huh? Oh yeah. I’m not sure how that happened. I just kind of grew, I guess.

Chihiro:
I can’t believe it. Time has passed so quickly.

Mizuki:
But Chihiro-senpai, you’ve grown up a lot too.
You’re so pretty. You have a really mysterious aura that just makes me want to completely melt.

Chihiro:
Completely melt?

Mizuki:
In other words, you’re beautiful.

Chihiro:
Stop it. I’m not pretty.

Mizuki:
Don’t be so modest. I have a question. Can I please give you a hug?
Think of it as a celebratory reunion hug.

Chihiro:
Okay.

Mizuki:
Yay. You’re so soft and you smell nice. Your energy is recharging me. I’m so happy.
I think I’m getting a nose bleed.

Chihiro:
What?

Mizuki:
Urrgg… I simply can’t believe that Renji got you. How dare he do something like that.
You’re way too good for my cousin.

Chihiro:
Oh no, you’re wrong. I’m the one that’s a burden to him. Not the other way around.

Mizuki:
I’m little devastated. I mean, after all, both you and Kei-senpai have regular boyfriends.
It’s almost like a double heartbreak for me. It’s just not fair.
All that aside, I know Renji’s a good guy.

Chihiro:
Mizuki-chan, did someone break your heart?

Mizuki:
No. It’s not as dramatic as that. I just couldn’t find someone I wanted to see.

Chihiro:
Oh, now I understand. When you can’t find the person you want to see, well, it feels like you can’t breathe at all.

Mizuki:
I wish I knew where you’ve gone, Kuze-san.
Maybe he’s avoiding me. Maybe I spoke up too quickly.
I may have done myself in.

Chihiro:
Wait a minute, please.

Mizuki:
That’s cute. Is that your diary?

Chihiro:
Yes. Everything important is recorded in here.
Kuze-san is… oh here it is. I knew it.

Mizuki:
What’s wrong?

Chihiro:
No. It’s nothing. Don’t worry about it.

Mizuki:
Well, I think I might need to worry about it, judging from your face.
Is it a secret, off-the-record, something you’re not allowed to tell anyone about or you’ll be in big trouble?

Chihiro:
No, it’s not that.

Mizuki:
Then just tell me what it is.

Chihiro:
You have to tell me, are you in love with Kuze-san?

Mizuki:
Huh? Well I… when asked point-blank, it’s hard to say.

Chihiro:
Falling in love with someone means losing total control of yourself. Please answer me.
Are you losing control of yourself?

Mizuki:
Uh…. I don’t think it’s gotten to that point yet, but it’s getting there very quickly and that scares me.

Chihiro:
I understand. I’m sorry then. I don’t have a choice.
This is about Kuze-san.



Yuu:
You look terrible. You know that, Kuze?

Shuuichi:
I know. It’s the pits.

Yuu:
She was just here and she’s looking for you.

Shuuichi:
I see.

Yuu:
Is that why you look so terrible?

Shuuichi:
You know how it is, old friend. I’m not supposed to hear the words “I love you” from anyone ever again.

Yuu:
Did she say that to you?

Shuuichi:
Yes. Now my nightmares are even worse. I’ll settle it tonight.

Yuu:
You’re going to do it?

Shuuichi:
Yea. It’s the last thing left to do.

Yuu:
I see.

Shuuichi:
I have to settle the score. All of it.
Reset everything in my life back to zero, because I’m going to die. See ya.

Yuu:
Gute Reise, Kuze.
(German for “Have a good trip”)



Mizuki:
Is this for real?
You mean Kuze-san is dying?

Renji:
He’s got a very rare heart condition.

Mizuki:
Uh. Renji?

Renji:
He had a heart attack during a concert six months ago. Let’s say, it’s beyond treatment.

Mizuki:
Is it true? Please tell me this is a joke.

Chihiro:
No. I’m sorry. It’s not.

Renji:
He doesn’t want anyone’s pity.

Chihiro:
He needs to be treated just like a normal person.

Renji:
That’s what he said he wants.

Mizuki:
Kuze-san… and to think he was spending time with me, I never even realized….

Renji:
We all thought it was better for you not to know about his condition.

Mizuki:
But why?

Chihiro:
Mizuki-chan, you must accept that there are certain limits to what people can do.
It’s one way to live and survive.



Yuuko:
Hi there, I didn’t expect to see you here, Himura-senpai.

Yuu:
What are you doing here all alone?
Here.

Yuuko:
These are my shoes. Where did you find them?

Yuu:
I found them by accident.

Yuuko:
Thank you very much.
Perfect fit. Now all I have to do is find and marry my Prince Charming.

Yuu:
Why did you have to stay after class?
Hey.

Yuuko:
Interesting, isn’t it?

Yuu:
Those assholes.

Yuuko:
You sure do swear a lot.

Yuu:
How can you be so calm about all of this?

Yuuko:
I don’t understand. Why are you getting so mad?

Yuu:
Huh?

Yuuko:
Is it maybe because you’re in love with me?

Yuu:
This is nothing for you to be joking about right now.

Yuuko:
How can I not joke about it? It happens to me all the time. I’m used to it.

Yuu:
What do you mean, all the time?

Yuuko:
It’s not that bad. I grade it a medium on the bully scale.

Yuu:
There’s no medium or well-done for bullying people.

Yuuko:
I’m pretty sure that they have issues too. They probably just need to relieve stress.
They don’t know me that well. Plus I’m an orphan who doesn’t have any family.
They more than likely see me as an ideal punching bag.



Shuuichi:
I’m sorry, but it’s broken forever.

Mizuki:
He’s a liar.

Chihiro:
Mizuki-chan.

Mizuki:
Chihiro-senpai.

Chihiro:
I have a message from Himura-san.

Mizuki:
Himura-san? The man at the church?

Chihiro:
Himura-san, he said you should go to the beach if you wanna hear Kuze-san play violin.
Himura-san usually doesn’t interfere in other people’s business, but he thought you should know.
He said this may be your last chance to hear him play it.

Mizuki:
Kuze-san.

Shuuichi:
It’s unsightly.

Mizuki:
Nooooo!

Shuuichi:
Mizuki. Mizuki-chan.
Stop it. It’s no good. Mizuki? Mizuki-chan?

Mizuki:
I did it, Kuze-san!

Shuuichi:
Show me your hands. Show them to me.

Mizuki:
Uh-uh.

Shuuichi:
Have you lost your mind?

Mizuki:
I’m sorry. But you can’t. You can’t give up. Not yet. Because you’re still alive.
Please don’t do this.

Shuuichi:
It’s fine. It’s going to be fine.

----- Ending -----

Yuuko:
So bullying is not really that bad after all.

Yuu:
What do you mean?

Yuuko:
You’re walking home with me, Yuu-kun, even after you told me to stay away.

Yuu:
You just reminded me. You should stay away.

Yuuko:
What?

Yuu:
I’m joking. Let’s go.
What’s wrong, Yuuko? What are you doing?

Yuuko:
Oh, this is sad. I just must have bad luck with shoes.

Yuu:
Let’s go.

Yuuko:
To where?

Yuu:
You said they need to relieve stress. That means you have an idea of who they are.

Yuuko:
You really don’t miss a thing, do you? Let’s leave it alone. I don’t care.

Yuu:
We can’t. It’s gone too far.

Yuuko:
It’s not something that should upset you. Why does it bother you so much?

Yuu:
Because it’s just playing dirty.

Yuuko:
Don’t worry about it. This is nothing.

Yuu:
What do you mean nothing?
What in the hell are you basing this on, Yuuko?

Yuuko:
Well I think this is just how humans behave.

Tattered emotions, indelible sins.
Ef – a tale of melodies. Turn. Can you hear the melody of truth?
