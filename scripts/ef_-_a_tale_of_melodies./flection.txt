  Yu:
Yuko. . .

Yuko:
Yu-kun, you‘re sure that you truly want to know?

You're so good.

Yu:
Don't look.

Yuko:
Don't be so stingy. What's the harm in looking?

Yu:
If you look at it, you'll keep on talking.

Yuko:
I think you never had a girlfriend because you're so cold.

Yu:
Mind your own business.

Yuko:
Well, I guess you're stuck with me now.
So you took up drawing again.

Yu:
Just for a breather.
Studying all the time is not all that effective.

Yuko:
You have a reason for everything.
Smart people are good at ad-libbing.

Yu:
Wait a minute.
Are you making fun of me?

Yuko:
No. l love you.

Yu:
I can't believe, you just say that so lightly.

Yuko:
You just don't take me seriously.
l love you, Himura-senpai.
Just coming here and seeing your face every day gives me the strength to go on.

Yu:
Have you been sleeping?

Yuko:
Not much.

Yu:
You've got to get some sleep.
You need to rest.
I'm not joking around.
Have you been studying late?

Yuko:
Good night.

Yu:
Not again. . .
Hey, Nagi! Stop writing on my. . .

Nagi:
l can't draw anymore.
I said I can’t draw anymore.

Yu:
Nagi. . .

Nagi:
Everything comes out warped.
lt's not even my work.
l did it over and over, but it's the same every time.
l don't know if my drawings are warped or if l'm the one that’s warped . . .
or maybe the world we live in is warped.
Just holding the brush makes me feel nauseous.
Something is wrong with me.

Yu:
ls it a slump?

Nagi:
l was told it's not something that can be defined by such a simple term.

Yu:
By whom?

Nagi:
The artist inside me is warning me that l may never ever be able to paint again.

Yu:
I’m not following you, you’re warning yourself?

Nagi:
The artist in me is giving the warning.
lt's talking to. . .Just get out.
l said, get out now!

Yu:
lt's talking to the woman in me.

Shuuichi:
Hey, Himura. You're coming tomorrow, you do remember right?

Yu:
Tomorrow?

Shuuichi:
My farewell party, idiot.

Yu:
Oh. l'd forgotten it.

Shuuichi:
You're so cold.
And you call yourself my best friend?

Yu:
I’m sorry.

Shuuichi:
lt can't be helped.
I know that you're going through a lot right now.
l guess l can't keep it from you, but you might not want to hear what I have to say.

Yu:
What is it?

Shuuichi:
Well, you told me to keep an eye on Yuko-chan.

Yu:
Yeah.

Shuuichi:
l heard something from one of her classmates.
It’s kind of unsettling.
She said there's something all of them have noticed, it’s something unnerving about Yuko's eyes.
Maybe it’s the other girls in her class who are really the ones that feel threatened.
l'm sure you feel it too.
Something about her isn't real.
l think she's hiding something.
You're probably the only one who can help her.

Yuko:
Himura-senpai, tell me something.
Do you believe in God?

Yu:
I’m starting to think that if there was a God, he’s not here anymore.
He just can’t be up there.

Yuko:
Why?

Yu:
The world is full of people who despise their fate.
They would have killed him by now.

Yuko:
You're right.
lf he were alive, l think I would have a few complaints myself.

Yu:
l've never seen you mad.

Yuko:
l'm not smiling all the time.
Everyone of us has our faces.

Yu:
Faces?

Yuko:
Yes. Or should l say masks?

Yu:
Are you hiding behind some kind of mask of your own?

Yuko:
Of course l am.
You know that.
Girls will always have their little secrets.
Do you honestly want to know my secret?

Yu:
So you're hiding something after all.

Yuko:
Someday l may be able to show you.
No, l do want to show you. . . the "real" me.
l agree with you.
There is no god.
That's why there's so much pain and suffering.
lf there was a god, l'd want him to make this world a more beautiful place.
The suffering would disappear.
Everyone would be kind.
No more loneliness.
Everyone will be loved.

Yu:
There's no such place as heaven.
Never has and never will.

Yuko:
l know that silly.
That's why l wish there was a place like that.
l'm still alive.
l don't mind showing him.
No, l want him to see.
Yu-kun. . .

Yu:
So you're still here, Nagi?
I thought you’d be there by now.

Nagi:
Oh, Hi, Yu.

Yu:
Kuze's farewell party is starting soon.

Nagi:
l just thought about something.
Yu, if we put our names together, it means "evening calm."

Yu:
What are you talking about?

Nagi:
"Yu-nagi" is that time of evening when the breeze is still.
No land breeze or sea breeze. lt's just still.
But in time, the wind has to pass through at some point.

Yu:
What’s the matter? You still can't draw?

Nagi:
Oh, l'd completely forgotten that l can't draw anymore.

Yu:
You act so indifferent.

Nagi:
l know the reason why I do though.

Yu:
Well, I think you need to resolve it then.
lt's the only real talent you have you know.

Nagi:
l hope that's not all l have to remember my youth by.

Yu:
Nagi. . .

Nagi:
You see l was feeling completely lonely.
Because both you and Kuze are starting to drift away.

Yu:
l'm not going anywhere.

Nagi:
Please tell me you’re joking.
You're so hurtful. Or are you just pretending to be dense?
No, l guess I was the one who was being dense.
l didn't even realize how l felt about you.

Yu:
Nagi. . .

Nagi:
l just thought "now" would last forever for us.
But I see now, that's impossible.
l realized it too late.

Yu:
I’m so sorry, Nagi.

Nagi:
Don't apologize!
l couldn't draw because l wasn't seeing my real self.
l may be able to now.
Go on. Yuko-chan is waiting for you.

Yu:
What is this? Where’s the party? Nobody else showed up?

Shuichi:
No, l only invited you three to be here in the first place.
This isn't a farewell party.
I like. lt's Shuuichi Kuze’s world class violin recital.

Yu:
Recital?

Shuichi:
You've never heard me play, so l'm gonna play a concert for you.
You should be eternally grateful.
Now be quiet and listen.

Yuko:
You make it sound like you're only playing the concert for Himura-senpai.

Shuichi:
Oh, excuse me.
l'm playing today for my best friends Yu Himura and the beautiful Yuko Amamiya.
lt will be my final and greatest performance here. . . in this place full of memories.

Yu:
Yuko?
Yuko!

Yuko:
l'm sorry, Himura-senpai.
l couldn't help but cry.
To play like that. . . His soul must be so pure.
lt was so beautiful and free of distortion.
He must have grown up surrounded by love.
That's how he produces such a beautiful sound.
lt was too pure for me. l couldn't stand it.
This world still may be worth something.
That's what it made me think. l couldn't believe it.

Yu:
You can believe it.
You should learn to accept your feelings for what they are.

Yuko:
Senpai. . .

Yu:
Or do you truly believe this world is worthless?
Yuko, what is this secret that you’re hiding?

Yuko:
Nothing . . .

Yu:
You're lying !

Yuko:
l'm not.

Yu:
You are!
You never say what you mean.
You don't listen to what you don't want to hear.
You don't answer my questions.
Either you're silent or you laugh it off.
l don't know what's the truth and what's not.
Do you really love me, or not?
ls it the truth, or not?
Yuko, tell me.

Yuko:
Tell you what?

Yu:
l'm sick of this! l want an answer!

Yuko:
You're so arrogant.

Yu:
l don't care. Tell me.

Yuko:
Why are you so stubborn?

Yu:
Because the truth is l love you.
That's why l want to know you, all of you.

Yuko:
ls that the truth?

Yu:
Yes.

Yuko:
Do you really love me?

Yu:
I do.

Yuko:
Do you really want to know me?

Yu:
Of course.

Yuko:
Are you willing to listen to all of it, Yu-kun?

Yu:
Yes.

Yuko:
You did. You finally said it.
l wanted to hear you say it so badly.
l wanted so much for you to want me.
Tell me one thing.

Yu:
What?

Yuko:
At the orphanage, l always followed you around.
I was always watching you.

Yu:
Yeah.

Yuko:
Why wouldn't you be my brother?
lf you had, l . . . l . . . could have remained pure.
Yu-kun, l want you to know who l really am.
Where did l go wrong? l've always wondered, but l still don't know.
Or is it this world that's warped?
My brother was kind.
He played with me and read me books.
He was like a real brother to me.
But as time passed, he must have realized . . . that l wasn't his real sister.
He wanted me to be a substitute for the sister he lost in the earthquake.
But l wasn't her. His sister was gone forever.
l was just some stranger there in her place.
When he realized that, he hated me with a passion.
A dark rage had been brewing in his heart ever since he lost his sister.
And he was looking for an outlet for his hatred . . . And there l was.
At first, he just hit me and threw things at me.
But he also took care of me, apologizing every time.
Then two Christmases ago, he. . . he took my virginity from me on Christmas Eve. lsn't that nice?
l wanted my first time to be with someone l loved.
l wanted to be treated gently, like a princess.
But my dreams were shattered.
l was all dressed up for Christmas.
l guess l was still hoping . . . that my brother would praise me if l looked pretty.
But after he hit me, l fell and my skirt rode up.
When l tried to pull it down, he grabbed my hand and . . .

Yu:
Stop. . .

Yuko:
lt was such a cute dress.

Yu:
Stop it.

Yuko:
Afterwards, he hit me again.

Yu:
Please don’t!

Yuko:
He kept on, even if l cried.

Yu:
Yuko, don’t!

Yuko:
That Christmas Eve, I…l became damaged goods.

Yu:
Be quiet!

Yuko:
l wish you were my first.
lt would have been gentle, like that kiss.
What a tragedy. l have nothing left.
No precious past, no dreams for the future.
l'm just a tool - a receptacle for his hatred.
l couldn't even be a surrogate doll for his sister.

Yu:
No! You're not a tool or a doll!
Don't say you don't have a future!
There is a future - and happiness!
Forget about your painful past!
lf you believe, you can change your future!
Don't ever say you have no future!
You have to believe that, Yuko…Please!

Yuko:
You're so naive.
This is from yesterday. And the day before.
This is healing from last week, while you were studying at home, maybe.
lt's been continuing every night... lt may have even gotten worse since l met you.
This is from the night we met again.
This is from the time l saw you and Nagi-san.
This is from the night l called you out onto the roof.
This is from the night you found my postcard. And when we went to buy shoes.
When he's unhappy, it’s worse.
And if l pretend to be obedient, it's even worse.
Did l do something wrong?
What did l do to deserve this?
l racked my brain, but couldn't find an answer.
Then, l stopped caring.
l began to wait for the day l…I would just disappear.
Waiting was agony.
lt hurt, it burned. l suffered.
lt was sad and painful. l cried.
l couldn't stand it, but l couldn't escape.
l was helpless. lt was endless.
l wanted to scream for it to end.
l wanted to squirm and vomit.
l wanted it to stop.
l wanted to transfer schools.
l wanted to lash back. My stomach hurt.
l wanted to escape, hide, avoid, and burrow into a hole.
l wanted to shun him, bite him, shove him, throw him off me.
But he cornered me, trapped me, blamed me, controlled me, wouldn't forgive me, gagged me, shoved me,forced himself on me, tore me, threw me to the ground, and forced me.
l wanted to cry and scream, and go crazy.l couldn't take it.
But he'd catch me, hit me, break me, kick me, cut me, reject me, disgrace me, destroy me,mock me, play with me, step all over me, and get bored with me, discard me .
l would faint, grow so numb, and my heart would be so broken...
l hated it. Hated it. Hated it. Hated it...
This is the "real" me that you never know existed.
This is the girl that you've abandoned.

Yuko:
Senpai, do you remember that day?

Yu:
What day?

Yuko:
The day l asked you. . . if you wanted a little sister.
l told you a distant relative found me and may adopt me.
But the decision was up to me.
Back then, you were the only one l could confide in.
lf you had just said you wanted me. . .
But you shook my hand away.
Why didn't you say you wanted a sister?
Why didn't you tell me not to go?
Why didn't you tell me to stay?
Why didn't you protect me?
Why?

Yu:
l didn't want a substitute.
l couldn't make you a surrogate for my real sister, like he did . . .

Yuko:
You liar.
Did you know that you blink a lot when you're lying?
Don’t worry, most people do.
But when you said that you loved me ---you did it without blinking.
You're ten years too late.

Will we confront courage. . . or. . .?
ef: a tale of melodies -- reflection.
Can you hear the melody of truth?
