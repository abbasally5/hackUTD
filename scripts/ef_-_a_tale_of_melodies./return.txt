Love, l've got to feel it
lf you put your trust in me
l know what my life would be
Oh, you are all l ever need
l try to hear what you say
So l pray
But you're fading away
Don't go and break my fragile heart
We won't fall apart
'Cause you're my only star
l wonder why my tears come at night
Calling you, so like a little child
All the things you have in mind
l wish l could see your insides
My love, you've got to feel it
And if we put our trust in you and me
You know what our lives would be
Oh, you are the one l believe

Nagi:
Yuko-chan.
Do you know where Yu is?

Yuko:
Himura-senpai?
No I don't.

Nagi:
He's been out of school for a while.
He's not at home, either.

Yuko:
l see. . .

Nagi:
l thought that you might know something about it.

Yuko:
No, I'm sorry, l don't know anything.

Nagi:
But you were absent too, Yuko-chan.

Yuko:
Yes.

Nagi:
On the same day Yu disappeared.
Do you know where Yu is?

Yuko:
No.
ls there something else?

Nagi:
l won't beat around the bush, l'll be straight with you.
You'd better not make Yu unhappy.
You're the only one who can do that.

Yuko:
Don't make him unhappy?
That's exactly what l wanted.
That's what l planned to do from the beginning.
So. . . why?
Why am I...

Yu:
l couldn't take Yuko as my sister.

Yuko:
l wanted revenge.
I thought Himura-senpai deserved it.

Yu:
l decided it would be better to live alone.

Yuko:
Because he chose to live alone, l wanted to share my pain 

with him.

Yu:
l couldn't draw Yuko no matter how hard I tried. . . because 

l couldn't forget about my own sister.

Yuko:
l envied him.

Yu:
lt was a minor incident, but it ruined Yuko's life.

Yuko:
lt was a minor incident, but it made me hate him so much.

Yu:
lt was a huge mistake.

Yuko:
Why didn't l realize it was a huge mistake?

Yu:
How can l make it up to her?

Yuko:
l shouldn't have hurt him.

Yu:
How can l save her?

Yuko:
l shouldn't have gone near him.

Yu:
I should have realized sooner how l felt. . .
lf l had just admitted sooner that l loved her.

Yuko:
I should have been honest from the start. . .
and told him l loved him, not as a brother. . .
l didn't know that l'd love him so much.
Why?

l'm home, brother.

Akira:
Welcome home, Yuko.
How did you get those scars?
l don't recognize them.
Did you do it yourself?
What do you think you're doing?
Were you punishing yourself?
Because you feel guilty about that boy?

Yuko:
l'm sorry. . .

Akira:
He's exact the same as me.
You don't need to feel guilty about anything.
Do you understand me? 

Yuko:
Yes.

Akira:
I'm so sorry, it's not your fault.
lt was that earthquake.
lt took my sister away from me.
lt took everything.
Why are you still alive?
You look just like her.
Why did she die and you survive?
Why is that? Why? Why?

Yu:
She was unlucky.

Yuko:
Himura-senpai!

Yu:
lt was just bad luck.
For your sister and mine.
We both have to face that.

Akira:
I'm very well aware of that, boy.
But. . .is that something you can live with?

Yu:
No!
But l have to accept it.

Akira:
l can't.
You and l have to drag the guilt of their deaths around for 

the rest of our natural lives.

Yu:
You can, but l won't do that!
But l will bear the memory of my sister forever!

Akira:
Go home.

Yuko:
Please, Stop, Big Brother!

Akira:
You and l are two birds of a feather.

Yu:
No!

Akira:
What's wrong?
Are you still not fighting back?

Yuko:
Stop there, right now!

Akira:
You finally found the nerve to use that?

Yu:
Stop, Yuko!

Yuko:
But. . . l . . .

Akira:
Hm? Well now, l thought you stopped drawing.
it's amusing, people can never stop themselves from doing 

the things they truely love.
Your drawing and my actions are no exceptions.
You truely love it, don't you?
What's going on?
How could you draw her?
This is my...
This is it...this is it...this is it
why-Why now?

Yu:
Could this be. . .

Yuko:
Yes. His [dead] sister.

Akira:
This is it.
Her face! Her expression!
It's all here.
Why couldn't l remember it?
Why couldn't l draw it?
Why? Why?

Yu:
All these paintings.
These are Amamiya's sister?

Akira:
Don't touch her!
Get out! Get out of here! Right now!

Yu:
l thought your brother didn't paint anymore.

Yuko:
lt's not that he didn't paint.
It was he couldn't.
Ever since that earthquake, he found he couldn't draw her 

face anymore.
so he just stopped painting anything ever again.

Yuko:
He's always in his studio trying to paint her, and he can 

never draw her face.
And when he fails, he just cries.

Yu:
He cries?

Yuko:
He's a lonely person.

Yu:
Why now?
I just don't understand it.

Yuko:
Senpai. . .
What did you draw in that sketch book?
Who is your drawing of?

Akira:
l missed you. . . l missed you so much!
You must have been so lonely.
And l'm so sorry for leaving you alone.
But everything's going to be okay now.
We'll be together forever.

Yu:
Amamiya!

Yuko:
Brother!

Yu:
What are you doing, Amamiya?
You'll be burned alive!
Amamiya!

Shuichi:
Everything has been settled. Everything.
When l die, nothing will be left.
No one will be sad, no one will cry. . .
No one will care.
l'll just disappear quietly from everyone's memory.
That's exactly how l wanted it.
l can't make anyone happy.
l know l'm going to lose, so l won't even try.
All l have to do is wait for the end.
No one can wind the spring.
But they can't make the pendulum swing faster, either.
lt's just a little while longer, but it seems like an 

eternity.

Mizuki:
Huh? Wait a minute, this song is the singing. . .
I have the courage to live. . .
These are the lyrics...that belong to. . .

Chihiro:
Um. . . Mizuki-chan?
Excuse...

Mizuki:
Senpai!

Chihiro:
lt must be hard.

Kei:
Are you all right?
It must be really painful.

Chihiro:
Yes, very painful.

Kei:
I guess lt would almost be easier if he said he hated you.

Chihiro:
But he couldn't do that.

Kei:
Huh?

Chihiro:
l couldn't say "l hate you" to Renji-kun either.
That was one lie l couldn't tell him.

Kei:
l see. . .

Chihiro & Kei:
Mizuki-chan?

Mizuki:
Yes! You're exactly right.

Kei:
We're kinda worried about you.

Mizuki:
l just thought of something.

Chihiro:
Mizuki, l don't know if it will help, but l want to give you 

this.
In order to make your dreams come true,
you have to have a dream in the first place.

Mizuki:
A dream in the first place?

Chihiro:
lf you give up, then nothing will happen.
So you have to keep on believing.
That's the first step in making your dreams come true.
lt's something l tell myself every single morning when I 

wake up.

Mizuki:
What is this?

Chihiro:
A spare key to the roof of Otowa Academy.
Himura-san gave it to me for good luck, but l'll give it to 

you right now.

Mizuki:
Are you really sure?

Chihiro:
Oh, Yes!
Renji-kun and l have already seen the benefits of having 

this key with us.

Kei:
Wait a minute.

Mizuki:
Huh?

Kei:
ls that the same as this one?

Mizuki:
Kei-senpai, How did you get it?

Kei:
lt's the spare key to the roof of Otowa in Japan.
It's Kyosuke, he gave it to me for good luck.

Mizuki:
Huh? You have one too?

Kei:
l'm fine now, too, so l'll give it to you.
Seems like you could use it now.

Mizuki:
Are these the kind of things that would be a typical good 

luck charm for someone?

Chihiro:
I don't know.
But l'm sure that by carrying them you'll have double the 

luck.

Kei:
Both of Them may be a little used already, but I'm sure 

there's power in them.

Mizuki:
l'm not sure about all this, but I want to thank you both 

anyway!
Oh, yeah! Can l ask you one more favor? 
I really need something.
Chihiro-senpai, can l have a blank page from your diary?

Shuichi:
What's wrong with me?
Why am l so scared now?
Everything's fine.
You wanted to settle your accounts, right?
And they're all settled.
What are you scared of?
Do l have to take this medicine to prolong my life?
To prolong my agony?
ls that what l want?
No, l don't. That's not what l want!
l'm scared . . . of dying . . .
What's wrong with me?
What am l afraid of?
Why am l so scared?
l ran away from anything l couldn't do.
Nothing will come after me now.
No one will bother me now.
Did you really think you could run away?
Did you really think you couldn't lose?
Did you honestly think there was a "win or lose" in this 

sort of life?
Thinking in those terms already is a sign of defeat?
That's not it. That's not it!
Are you sad because you honestly love that girl?
Or did you drive her away so you wouldn't be sad?
Will you be hurt if you fall in love?
lf you don't, will you never be hurt?
Yes!
And what's wrong with it?
l was happy living like that!
Everything was going fine! l didn't hurt anyone!
No one hurt me! I was fine!
So why?
Why is this so hard?
I don't understand this.
What happened? Did l lose?
l ran away to a place where no one knew me.
Did l still lose?
l'm scared . . . l'm all alone.
There's nothing for me.
l don't have my violin, or anyone to love. . .
l don't have anything ! No one!
l'm scared ! l'm all alone!
There's nothing left.
Is this what I wanted?

Yu:
What's wrong?

Mizuki:
l came to ask for some courage.

Yu:
Courage? From whom?

Mizuki:
Not anyone that you would remember.

Yu:
You're mistaken, l know everyone in this town.

Mizuki:
But she isn't really here now.
But I do know her.
They're for a frind of mine named Yuko Amamiya.
I actually think the 25th would be better then.

Yu:
You. . .Then you are...
