Shuuichi:
I see. I have feelings for you too.
That’s why I can’t allow this to go on any longer.
Just go, leave me alone. I don’t ever want to see you or hear from you again.
Do you understand?

Mizuki:
Chihiro-senpai?

Kei:
Hey!

Mizuki:
Kei-senpai!

Emi:
You’re so obnoxious. I hope you realize that.
You know, you’ve got some nerve, Kyosuke.

Kyosuke:
Why is that?

Emi:
Kyosuke, I’m your ex-girlfriend or have you forgotten that?

Kyosuke:
Yeah, so?

Emi:
Then why are you making me edit this footage of your new girlfriend?

Kyosuke:
Well, that would probably be because you’re the best film editor I’ve ever met.

Emi:
I guess good film-makers are good even if they do happen to be terrible rotten idiots.

Kyosuke:
Is that an insult or a compliment?

Emi:
50/50.
What is that anyways?

Kyosuke:
It’s a good-luck charm for love. A classmate gave it to me to keep.
But I don’t need any luck in that area.

Emi:
I take it back. It’s 70/30 and you’re a jerk.
It’s finished. Are you satisfied now? You better help me with our new project in return.

Kyosuke:
In case you forgot, I’m not in the film club any more.

Emi:
I haven’t accepted your letter of resignation.

Kyosuke:
Are you serious?

Emi:
Do you honestly think I’d let good talent go that easily?
Work is work. Personal is personal.

Kyosuke:
And sex is sex. If you know what I mean.

Emi:
And how is she?

Kyosuke:
Well, uh…

Emi:
You’re so annoying.





Yuuko:
Still having trouble walking on your own?

Kei:
Nah. As long as I can stand. I’m going to run as hard as I can. And for as long as I can.

Yuuko:
And what happens if you stumble?

Kei:
No problem. Even if I fall, I have someone to support me.
I have to keep on running. No matter what, you know.

Yuuko:
For your sister?

Kei:
In a way. Because I always have to be her cool older sister.

Yuuko:
Sometimes you have to rest so that wounds can heal.

Kei:
Some wounds never heal.

Yuuko:
Are you honestly sure about that?

Kei:
It’s been five years.
Have you eaten dinner?

Chihiro:
Yes, Shrimps and walnut spaghetti. Eight points. How about you?

Kei:
Convenience store food. Four points. How’s Renji-kun?

Chihiro:
We’re good.

Kei:
I’d love to meet him.

Chihiro:
I really would like for you to meet him.

Kei:
I want to spend time with you too.

Chihiro:
I want to see you too.

Kei:
Chihiro said that the Otowa town in Australia’s exactly like this one.

Kyosuke:
The seasons're reversed, but the climate’s similar and there’s no time difference.

Kei:
Twin cities on opposite sides of the world? It’s just like me and Chihiro.

Kyosuke:
So hmm… do you want to go see Chihiro?

Kei:
Sure.

Kyosuke:
Why don’t you go see her then?

Kei:
It’s not that easy. It’s on the other side of the globe.

Kyosuke:
C’mon. Mizuki’s on vacation there.

Kei:
Yeah, but….

Kyosuke:
If she can do it, then it can’t be all that difficult.

Kei:
Of course it is. I don’t know if I could face her after everything that happened, you know.

Kyosuke:
I think that you can decide that when you see her.
Are you still scared?
You’re scared to see her, right?

Kei:
Yea.

Kyosuke:
Even if I’m here.
I don’t know how it’ll turn out, but no matter what, I’ll be here for you.
Is that enough? Say yes.

Kei:
Yeah.

Kyosuke:
Okay! That’s the Kei-chan I know.

Kei:
Don’t treat me like a kid. Stop it.

Kyosuke:
I’ll be fine. I’m not scared any more.

Nagi:
Well, then I think we should all go together.

Kei:
Big sister Nagi!

Nagi:
This urban project is completely meaningless unless people connect with each other.
Do you have a passport, Kei-chan? I was just about to head out for Down Under myself.
Let’s go see Chihiro-chan together.





Yuuko:
Do you want a little sister, Yuu-kun?
Don’t you want a sister?

Yuu:
I don’t want a sister, any more.
I’m sick of it. Stop asking.

Yuuko:
Brother…

Yuu:
Don’t call me brother. Go away.



Yuuko:
Ah, I’m still alive.

Shuuichi:
Hey, Himura. Good morning.

Yuu:
Oh, good morning, Kuze.

Shuuichi:
Here you go, my friend.
I have a gift for you.

Yuu:
Prodigious Violinist Shuuichi Kuze’s Farewell Party?

Shuuichi:
I have one for you too, Nagi.
I’d really appreciate it if both of you could come.

Yuu:
A farewell party. That’s not your style. But I’ll show my face if I can.

Shuuichi:
You’re so cold, as usual.
Oh yeah, there’s one more person I’d like to invite if you two don’t mind.
Himura, I’m gonna need you to help me out with this.

Yuu:
Me?

Shuuichi:
I’d really like if Yuuko Amamiya could come as well.

Yuu:
Ah-ah...
C’mon, do you really like her that much?

Shuuchi:
Tch. Not for me, crazy. For you!

Yuu:
Huh?

Shuuichi:
If my instincts are correct, and they are more often than not, I can tell you she’s the perfect girl for you.

Yuu:
You honestly don’t know what you’re talking about.

Shuuichi:
From what I can see, the two of you get along together pretty well.

Yuu:
She just hangs around me. That’s all.

Shuuichi:
That’s not what it looks like to me, old friend.

Yuu:
Ridiculous!
If you don’t cut it out, I definitely won’t show.

Shuuichi:
Well, well, don’t get so emotional, buddy.

Girls:
AAAHHHH!

Yuu:
It’s Yuuko.

Yuuko:
Huh? Well good morning, Himura-senpai.

Yuu:
What just happened, Yuuko?

Yuuko:
What do you mean what happened?

Yuu:
Stop playing dumb. Are you being bullied?
Urgh, who did this!? Which one of you!?

Shuuichi:
Himura, calm down.



Akira:
Himura-kun, have you finally decided to join us in the art department?

Yuu:
I’m not in the mood and don’t have time for your jokes right now.

Akira:
Is it about Yuuko?

Yuu:
Yes.

Akira:
I heard it was quite a scene.

Yuu:
She’s your own sister. Don’t you care?

Akira:
It’s nothing to get riled up about. I heard that Yuuko instigated it.
They just reacted. She wasn’t hurt so I sent her home.
She’s probably writing a letter of apology right about now.

Yuu:
That’s not true.

Akira:
What?

Yuu:
Yes. Yuuko was hurt. Her shoulder was cut up.

Akira:
Oh, is that right? I wonder why she didn’t say anything to me about it.

Yuu:
Amamiya-sensei, did you even know that Yuuko is being bullied here at school?

Akira:
Bullied?

Yuu:
Yes. This’s gone on for too long and it’s getting worse.
We have to do something right now before it escalates any more.

Akira:
Himura-kun, this is nothing to worry about. You should leave it alone.
This is Yuuko’s problem, not yours.

Yuu:
Are you kidding me? Don’t you care what’s happening to her?
Even if the two of you are not related, she’s still your sister.

Akira:
Yes, she is, which in essence means it’s none of your business, Himura-kun.
Isn’t that right?



Yuu:
I thought you went home. What are you doing up here?

Yuuko:
In fooling your enemy, it is first necessary to deceive your ally.

Yuu:
Who’s your enemy, and who’s your ally?

Yuuko:
I’d like to think that you’re my ally, aren’t you?

Yuu:
I don’t know, maybe.

Yuuko:
You’re so sweet to me.

Yuu:
Stop talking nonsense.
Did you go to the nurse’s office?

Yuuko:
What?

Yuu:
You’re injured. You have to take care of it.

Yuuko:
I told you. You’re my sweet ally and you already know it, Himura-senpai.

Yuu:
I told you already. Stop talking like that.
I thought you were going to ignore it.
Laugh off your hardship and act like everything is just fine.
After all, fighting obviously isn’t your style. You only end up getting hurt more.

Yuuko:
But I thought they might enjoy a different reaction every now and again.

Yuu:
You mean that you….

Yuuko:
To tell you the truth, that was the first time I ever hit someone in my life.
It hurt more than I thought.

Yuu:
What happened?

Yuuko:
I caught one of my classmates going through my bag.

Yuu:
Your bag?

Yuuko:
I don’t know what happened. I got angry and I just lost it.

Yuu:
I see.

Yuuko:
I’m sorry.
I’m sorry, Himura-senpai.

Yuu:
Why are you apologizing?

Yuuko:
Why would I not apologize? Because I made the one I love the most worry about me.

Yuu:
But why?

Yuuko:
What?

Yuu:
It’s only been a few days since we met again. I don’t understand how you can just say that.

Yuuko:
I’ve always fantasized about this.

Yuu:
Fantasize?

Yuuko:
Of how you would be when you grew up. Of all the devastated children who had lost their families in the earthquake, you were always the one alone. But you were strong. You loved to draw and always looked forward. I always wondered what kind of man you’d become. You turned out exactly how I dreamed it’d be.

Yuu:
And exactly what kind of man is that?

Yuuko:
It’s a secret. I can’t say.



Shuuichi:
You know, I’m starting to think that I should hold a farewell party before my clock stops ticking.
Or maybe not.



Kei:
It’s cool. This is just like the Otowa in Japan.

Mizuki:
Yeah, I was shocked when I first saw it myself.

Kei:
It’s winter in Japan, but hot over here.

Mizuki:
It’s so strange. But the fact that you’re here is even stranger to me.
It made me so excited. Really, it’s miracle!

Kei:
I never thought I’d be here either, you know.

Mizuki:
I could really use your energy to recharge myself right now. May I please, senpai?

Kei:
Stop it. It’s really too hot for that. Mizuki?

Mizuki:
What is it?

Kei:
Did something happen?

Mizuki:
Yes, it did.

Kei:
Do you wanna talk about it?

Mizuki:
I might need your help.

Kei:
You always overdo it.

Mizuki:
I got that from you.

Kei:
I don’t overdo it.

Mizuki:
Ah, your saying that is definite proof that you do.

Kei:
Eh, I guess you got me.

Mizuki:
Kei-senpai, what made you come all the way over here?

Kei:
Well, I guess you could call it homework.

Mizuki:
Homework?

Kei:
Yes. Five long years’ worth.

Chihiro:
Sister…. Kei.­

Kei:
Huh? Chihiro…

Chihiro:
Sister Kei!

Kei:
Chihiro!
I missed you.

Chihiro:
Me too.
I have something that I need to tell you.
I missed you much. [I’ve been meaning/Needed] to tell you this for a long time.

Kei:
It’s okay. It’s going to be okay.

Chihiro:
I can remember the accident like it was yesterday. And I just wanna tell you how I feel right now.

Kei:
Never mind. Let’s forget about it.

Chihiro:
I’m so sorry, Kei.

Kei:
You have nothing to feel sorry about. I’m the one who should be sorry.

Chihiro:
It’s all my fault. I brought it upon myself.
I knew you liked Hiro but I took him away from you.

Kei:
Oh, you have it all wrong. It’s all my fault.

Chihiro:
That’s why all this happened because of me. I’m sorry.

Kei:
It’s not your fault. 

Nagi:
Same old story. Those two always end up blaming themselves and hurting each other.
Can’t be helped. When each one of them blame themselves, they only end up hurting the other even more. Even if they reconcile and forgive one another, once Chihiro-chan’s memory fades, everything is reset to zero and it starts all over again. It goes on and on forever. That’s why we had to keep the two of them apart. But I’m thinking we may not have to worry about that any more.

Mizuki:
What?

Chihiro:
You’ve been through a lot. I’m so glad you’re here right now.

Kei:
The only reason I was able to come here to see you is because of Tsutsumi-senpai.
I’d really like for you to meet him.

Chihiro:
Okay.

Kei:
You’ve overcome some obstacles too, I see.

Chihiro:
I don’t feel sad all the time any more. And it’s because of Renji-kun.

Kei:
You’ve gotten strong.

Chihiro:
It’s because I want to be like you, sister.

Kei:
You know what I think?
I think there are times that it would be better if I were more like you.

Chihiro:
You know in the end, both of us ended up with people other than Hiro and he got someone else.
It’s kind of funny, isn’t it?

Kei:
You’re right.
Chihiro, are you happy?

Chihiro:
Yes, How about you?

Kei:
Of course I am.
I’m glad I came. Just to see you smile.

Chihiro:
I am, too.

Nagi:
Now they can both walk on their own. Now they have the strength to get back up.
There’s nothing to worry about, not any more.
Those two are gonna be just fine now. It’s gonna be all right.

Mizuki:
Excuse me.

Nagi:
Hm?

Mizuki:
Please tell me how I could become more like you?
I hurt myself so I wouldn’t hurt the person that I love, but that hurt him even more.
I tried to stay away from him, but that only made him suffer even more.
No matter what I try to do, one of us seems to end up getting hurt.
How do I end this cycle? Both of us keep getting hurt and I don’t want that.
I don’t know what to do.

Nagi:
Wait a second. I see. You’re the girl.

Mizuki:
What?

Nagi:
You’re the little girl hanging around Kuze. You need to stop right now.
It’s annoying.

Mizuki:
What do you mean? Why are you saying that?

Nagi:
Well, young lady, probably because I’m dating Kuze.

----- Ending -----

Akira:
Could I have a word with you, Yuuko?

Yuuko:
Big brother.

Akira:
What exactly happened today?

Yuuko:
A classmate was going through my bag.

Akira:
Oh really?

Yuuko:
It’s still inside my bag.

Akira:
That’s a good thing. I guess I can overlook it this time.
I do have a reputation to uphold.

Yuuko:
I had no idea that you cared.

Akira:
You’re right. I don’t. By the way, did you show him your arm?

Yuuko:
No.

Akira:
I can attest to this. That boy’s greatest fear is abandoning you.
That fool. He should just be worrying about saving himself.

Yuuko:
You can’t apologize to someone who’s dead.

Akira:
You’re the one carrying it around.

Yuuko:
You gave it to me as a good-luck charm.

Akira:
What are you going to do?

Yuuko:
Nothing. I just wanna see how it plays out.

Akira:
That’s exactly how people make stupid mistakes.

Yuuko:
I’ve been mistaken for a long time already.

Akira:
I see. You’re right.

Feelings that reached you, and feelings that didn’t.
