There are two towns named Otowa:
The real one built upon the charred remains of the rubbles from a natural disaster,
And the false one casting its shadow over a tranquil, beautiful land.
Consumed by a tragic past, founded on misfortune,
Here life goes on day after day, blanketing itself in the light of humans.
A real town shadowed in lies.
The real me lives in this false town.
Recurring feelings, desire that lie beyond time and space.
What are they?

█████01. 

Yuu:
You really shouldn't be up there. It's dangerous you know.

Yuuko:
Is that so? How kind of you, Yuu Himura.

Yuu:
Huh? Who are you?

Yuuko:
My name is Yuuko.

Yuu:
Yuuko?

Yuuko:
If-If you've forgotten, then don't say another word.
Just pretend that nothing's happened. And I'll say good-bye right now.
Yuu Himura, I hate you! Even now. So put me out of your mind forever.



Shuuichi:
Hey Himura!

Yuu:
Should you even be here, Kuze?

Shuuichi:
It's nice and cool in the evening so it's ok.
How's the princess doing?

Yuu:
She's fast asleep. How about you?

Shuuichi:
I'm doing the same as usual.
Are you reminiscing about the past again, old friend?

Yuu:
Are you kidding? I forgot all about the past.

Shuuichi:
If that's the case, I'll be sure to tell her that you send your regards

Yuu:
You've gotta be kidding me.

Shuuichi:
Himura, I'd like for you to come to my concert tomorrow night.

Yuu:
A concert?

Shuuichi:
Yea. It's a recital for you and her.
Then after that I'll be done, with everything.

Yuu:
Your fermata.

Shuuchi:
Something like that.

Yuu:
Fermata is the classical term.

Shuuchi:
Wait a minute. How would you even know that term?

Yuu:
You taught me.

Shuuchi:
Yea. I suppose I did.

Shuuchi:
Yes. Fermata is the appropriate term, especially for my life at this moment.

Yuu:
Oh, by the way, I heard Renji and his mother have a girl visiting.

Shuuichi:
A girl?

Yuu:
Surprising you didn't know.

Shuuchi:
I haven't seen either one of them lately.

Yuu:
They live right next door to you.

Shuuichi:
Physical proximity isn't everything, my friend.
A girlfriend sitting next to me isn't necessarily closer to me than a girlfriend sitting in the next classroom. Am I right?

Yuu:
Wouldn't the fact that you have two girlfriends be the real problem?

Shuuichi:
Not as long as they aren't the only ones.

Yuu:
Huh?

Shuuichi:
Two girlfriends will only end up fighting with each other.
But twenty girlfriends will become competitive.
And the target of their rage will be directed toward each other, not me.
Always works for me.

Yuu:
You're such a cad.

Shuuchi:
Rivalry between girls can sometimes lead to great friendship. So see, it's not all that bad.

Yuu:
You do realize your ability to justify everything makes you seem even worse.

Shuuichi:
Oh I know. But that's what the ladies love about me.

Yuu:
You never change.

Shuuichi:
Nope and I never will.
People don't ever change that easily. And that would include you, wouldn't it, Himura?

Yuu:
You got a point. Maybe I haven't changed at all since then.



Yuu:
That idiot.

Shuuichi:
Hey Himura.
You goin' to work?

Yuu:
Yes I am.

Shuuichi:
Could you give me a little hand first before you start to head out?
I'm trying to hold a sort of a flea market.

Yuu:
Flea market? For what?

Shuuichi:
I'm trying to get rid of some of the things I don't need and sell the stuff off before I leave Japan.

Yuu:
I'm sorry, but I'm busy.

Shuuichi:
Is that so?
Well, I'll let you off the hook if it's a girl you're busy with.

Yuu:
Oh it's a girl all right. But it's her.

Shuuichi:
Huh! In that case please go right ahead.

Akira:
Hello there, Himura-kun. Are you finally looking for the art department?

Yuu:
Amamiya-sensei. You know smoking is prohibited here.

Akira:
If there's no smoke, there's never any fire.

Yuu:
Then uh... What are you doing with the cigarette?

Akira:
In my experience people drive satisfaction from substitutes.
That aside, I'm glad you finally decided to set foot in the art room.
I see you've come around so it was worth pursuing you.

Yuu:
I've told you before. I have no intention of joining the art department.

Akira:
You shouldn't play so hard to get.
You have talent. It's such a shame to let it go to waste.

Yuu:
I've told you a hundred times already.
I don't have any interest in joining the art department. Now if you'll excuse me.

Akira:
Looking for Hirono?

Yuu:
Yeah.

Akira:
Poor little thing.
Art is all-consuming. It swallows everything in its path, even innocent bystanders.
Remember Himura-kun, it's better to consume than to be the one consumed.

Yuu:
I'll keep that in mind.



Yuu:
Excuse me. What exactly do you think you're doing?

Nagi:
You're more than a little late, Yuu.
I got tired of waiting, so I started working on a sketch.
Sorry you don't mind waiting a little bit longer, do you?
That way I can reach a good stopping point at least.

Yuu:
Ugh, why do you have to sketch in the nude?
Could you at least put on some clothes?

Nagi:
You don't have to be so bossy.
I'm doing a rough sketch. No big deal.

Yuu:
A rough sketch doesn't mean sketching in the raw, you know.
Put some clothes on, Nagi.

Nagi:
Oh my god, Yuu. This is the first time you've actually tried to make a joke.

Yuu:
It's not a joke. Please cover yourself up.

Nagi:
Tell me something. Are you always this uptight?

Yuu:
Uh.. uh... Shut up!

Nagi:
You may not know this, but a rough sketch is the basic foundation of all great art.

Yuu:
But who the hell ever heard of posing nude while you're painting yourself.

Nagi:
A self-portrait is also a very basic exercise in art.

Yuu:
Well I've never seen completely naked self-portraits by people like van Gogh or Picasso.

Nagi:
That's because they're both men. They would never do nude sketches of themselves.
You're not the brightest crayon in the box, you know.

Yuu:
I can't decide who's worse, you or Kuze. I just don't understand artists at all.

Nagi:
Are you honestly putting me in the same category as Kuze?

Yuu:
He might be right. It may be better to consume than being consumed.

Nagi:
What was that?



Nagi:
This should be enough for a while.

Yuu:
I just want to know, when do you think you'll be able to do your shopping by yourself?

Nagi:
I have no idea. Don't ask me.

Yuu:
Well then who do you think I should ask.

Nagi:
I don't understand how anyone could go into a store and shop by themselves.
I don't get how everyone, including you, can be so insensitive.

Yuu:
You know, you really are one to talk.

Nagi:
Oh wait, I want to give you a token of my appreciation. Here, this one is for you.

Yuu:
I don't need that.

Akira:
Arg, come on! It was a freebie. Don't worry about it.

Yuu:
I'm not worried. I just don't want it.

Akira:
You're so ungrateful. I let you see me naked, and you can't even reciprocate?

Yuu:
Your logic is flawed. You owe me and I never asked to see you naked.

Nagi:
You men are so self-centered.

Yuu:
Argh... what?

Nagi:
By the way, Yuu. Did you happen to do something to incur someone's wrath?

Yuu:
Huh?

Nagi:
In case you're too dense and blind to notice, someone's been following you ever since we left school.

Yuuko:
Well hello again.

Nagi:
Who are you?

Yuuko:
I'm Yuuko Amamiya. I'm a freshman.

Nagi:
Do you know this girl?

Yuuko:
He doesn't. But I've known him for a very long time.
Himura-senpai doesn't seem to remember anything about me at all. *giggle*

Nagi:
Hmmp!
I'm leaving.

Yuu:
Hey Nagi! Hey what's wrong? Why are you... Ouch!
Just what the hell was that all about?



Yuuko:
Actually she's very cute.

Yuu:
Are you kidding me? She's a total pain in the ass.

Yuuko:
She's an honest, good girl. I admire her. Are the two of you going out?

Yuu:
No way. She just drags me around behind her all the time.

Yuuko:
You haven't changed at all. Your attitude is still sarcastic.
But you don't remember anything, do you?

Yuu:
You're wrong. I remember. I remember everything.

Yuuko:
I see.

Yuu:
It's been a long time, Yuuko.

Yuuko:
Yes it has, Yuu-kun.

Yuu:
Have you been well?

Yuuko:
Yes. I'm glad to see you're well too.

Yuu:
It's been ten years. Time really flies.

Yuuko:
But not for me. It seems like I've waited an eternity.

Yuu:
How are you?

Yuuko:
I'm surviving. I live with a new brother now.

Yuu:
I see.

Yuuko:
But I have to tell you. I'm so glad to see you again, brother.

Yuu:
Just stop it.
Don't call me that.

Yuuko:
I'm sorry. I forgot

Yuu:
Things have changed.

Yuuko:
What do you mean?

Yuu:
I'll be blunt. Stay away from me. Please, don't make me remember.

----- Opening -----

Miki!
Miki!

Renji:
Mizuki! Mizuki!
Hey you need to get up. It's almost time for breakfast.

Mizuki:
Huh... oh...

Renji:
Are you awake?

Mizuki:
Probably.

Renji:
Probably?

Mizuki:
Where am I?

Renji:
Australia of course.

Mizuki:
Huh?
What are you doing here, Renji?

Renji:
What do you mean why I'm doing here? You came to visit me, remember?

Mizuki:
What for?

Renji:
What for! Are you kidding me?
You were accepted to Otowa, and had some time to kill so you came out here.

Mizuki:
Oh I think I remember that happening.

Renji:
Are you sure you're not still dreaming?

Mizuki:
Hehehe... so then what are you doing here?

Renji:
I told you. You're here visiting us, Mizuki.

Asou:
Oh my, you two have gotten close.
Maybe I should tell Chihiro about this.

Renji:
No! No! It's not like that at all.

Asou:
Hehe. I made Spanish omelets for breakfast. Hurry now, you two.

Mizuki:
Okay.
Hey, do you have any idea why I'm holding onto your arm?

Renji:
I was gonna ask you. Were you having a nightmare or something?
You were tossing and turning around, and reaching out like you needed some help.

Mizuki:
Okay. I'm going to change out of my pijamas now Renji. Wanna watch?

Renji:
Ah? No. Wait. I'll go.

Mizuki:
It's the same.

Renji:
Huh?

Mizuki:
Every night I have the same dream.

Renji:
The same dream?

Mizuki:
Yes. I do. About beautiful flowers.



Renji:
A violin?

Mizuki:
Yeah, a violin.
I was walking by the church yesterday and I heard this really beautiful music.
The melody seemed to come from everywhere and filled the evening sky like a sea of sounds.
It was so amazing.

Renji:
That would probably be Kuze-san then.

Mizuki:
Kuze-san?

Asou:
He lives right next door to us.
He's a world-renowned violinist.

Mizuki:
Wow!

Renji:
That's great. That means Kuze-san is playing again.

Mizuki:
I can't tell you how beautiful it was.

Renji:
Kuze-san used to play for the two of us all the time. It's so much better to hear him live than recorded.

Mizuki:
Hey, Renji. Would you introduce me?

Renji:
Introduce you to who?

Mizuki:
Kuze-san of course. I want to meet him.
So how about it?

Renji:
You see, uh... Kuze-san is... uh...

Mizuki:
Is there some sort of problem?

Renji:
A problem. No. Um, well actually. See, the thing is he's kinda a real womanizer.

Mizuki:
Huh?

Renji:
He's a little different, kind of weird actually. I think you'd better not.

Mizuki:
That is totally for me to decide. I'm not asking him to be my boyfriend.
So who cares if he's a weird womanizer? Urrg, you're so rude.
I don't care what he's like. My heart belongs to Kei-senpai completely.
Even if a playboy were to approach me, my feelings would never waver one little bit.
Well then, I guess you'll be running around with me for my entire break?

Renji:
Mizuki, you know I can't. I'm studying for my exams!

Mizuki:
I guess you should've thought about that and started your studying earlier.

Renji:
That's so unreasonable!
Come on, Mom! Back me up here.

Asou:
Well I guess if you really wanted to, I'd be happy to introduce you.

Mizuki:
Really?

Renji:
Mom, what are you doing?

Asou:
Kuze-san is probably busy. We should ask about his schedule.



Mizuki:
It looks like he's not in right now.

Asou:
That seems a little strange. It's Sumire Asou from next door.
Are you home, Kuze-san? I wanted to talk to you, but I guess I'll have to come back another time.

Shuuichi:
What can I do for you, Sumire-san?

Asou:
Well, good morning, Kuze-san.
Would you mind terribly if I came in for a couple of minutes?

Shuuichi:
Are you trying to ask me out on a date?

Asou:
I'd like to deepen our relationship. I'm asking you a little favor.

Shuuichi:
Have I honestly ever turned you down? For you, anything.

Mizuki:
Ugh. I've seen womanizers before but this guy is good.

Shuuichi:
Well, who is this young lady?

Mizuki:
How do you do, sir?
My full name is Mizuki Hayama. Mi- zu- ki!
It's written in katakana.

Asou:
She's my niece.

Shuuichi:
I see. How do you do. I'm Shuuichi Kuze.

Mizuki:
Nice to meet you.



Asou:
Renji has his exams and I'm so busy with work. There's no one to show Mizuki around.

Shuuichi:
I see then. It's not a problem. I'd be happy too.

Asou:
That's wonderful. Then you don't mind keeping Mizuki company while she's visiting?

Shuuichi:
Sure. It'd be my honor and privilege.

Asou:
That's wonderful. Isn't it, Mizuki?

Mizuki:
Yes! Thank you very much, sir.

Shuuichi:
It's not a problem for me at all.
You know, I've never been one to complain about being in a company of a beautiful young lady.

Mizuki:
Beautiful young lady?

Shuuichi:
You know. Sumire-san has always been there to help me out.
I'm more than excited to have an opportunity like this to return the favor while I can.

Asou:
What do you mean by that, Kuze-san? While you can?

Shuuichi:
Oh... please excuse me. That didn't come off the way I meant it to. Please just ignore what I said.

Asou:
Okay then.



Mizuki:
Kuze-san, I have a question. Did you just move in here?

Shuuichi:
No. I've lived here for quite a while. Why do you ask?

Mizuki:
You hardly have any furniture.

Shuuichi:
I know. I disposed of most of it.

Mizuki:
Disposed?

Shuuchi:
Yep! For a change of pace.

Mizuki:
You got rid of all your furniture for a change of pace?

Shuuchi:
Yea. My furniture, my clothes. All of it.
Nice and spacious.

Mizuki:
Yes I guess. Wow, this guy's a little bit weird.

Shuuichi:
Feel free. You're welcome to come here and visit me anytime you feel like it.

Mizuki:
Do you really mean that?

Shuuichi:
Sure. I have a lot of extra space. This place is way too big for just one person.

Mizuki:
Wow, thank you very much, Kuze-san.
I have my own room at home, but it feels so cramped because it's full, floor to ceiling, with my favorite manga. I just love great big spacious rooms.

Shuuichi:
Wait! Don't touch-

Mizuki:
These are?

Shuuchi:
Don't misunderstand. These aren't for me. I don't wear them.
They're just hanging in here because I'm planning to get rid of these eventually.

Mizuki:
Get rid of all of them?

Shuuichi:
Yeah.

Mizuki:
No you can't. You can't dispose of them.



Shuuichi:
So. You already got accepted to school. You must be a pretty smart young lady then.

Mizuki:
Not really. I just wanted to get into this school in Otowa so bad.
This is a violin, right?

Shuuichi:
Yea, that's what it is.

Mizuki:
Kuze-san, could I ask you for a little tiny favor?

Shuuichi:
What is it?

Mizuki:
Would you please play a violin for me?
I heard that you're a professional violinist, right? I really love to hear you play live.
Kuze-san?

Shuuichi:
Oh I'm sorry. I can't play for you today. My violin's broken right now.

Mizuki:
What?

Shuuichi:
I hate to disappoint you, but it won't play.

Mizuki:
I won't say I'm not devastated. I really wanted to hear you play it for me.
It's so much better to hear live music.

Shuuichi:
I really hate having to fake it. I do.

Mizuki:
Huh?

Shuuichi:
How about you got a rain check for later?

Mizuki:
Okay.

Shuuichi:
Hey, I have some CDs if you'd like.
Let's see, how about this one?

Mizuki:
Wow, it's really you on the cover. You look so cool and so young, too.

Shuuichi:
You can have it if you want.

Mizuki:
Thank you very much. I do.
What's that?

Shuuichi:
It's just an alarm for my stomach. Would you like something to drink?

Mizuki:
Yea. I'd love something.

Shuuichi:
There's a lot in there, so please help yourself.

Mizuki:
Thanks.
Are juice and liquor the only things you keep in your refrigerator?

Shuuichi:
Of course it's not. See, there's ice in there too.

Mizuki:
Hmm...
Ahh, this is exactly what I needed.
You know what I think? This apartment is kind of lovely.

Shuuichi:
Lovely?

Mizuki:
Yea. I can go rolling from one end to the other with no problem at all.

Shuuichi:
Rolling?

Mizuki:
Yup. Right. Rolling!



Mizuki:
Ah, this feels absolutely wonderful.

Shuuichi:
It sure does.

Mizuki:
I don't have this view of space when I roll around the floor at home.
It's just manga, and manga, and manga, and bed. So it all looks the same.

Shuuichi:
Heh, I see. Huh!

Mizuki:
It's nice not having anything at all.

Shuuichi:
What?

Mizuki:
I don't have classes or homework, or anything that I have to do.
Lying here with nothing to do feels wonderful. I want to lie around here forever.
It feels so nice. Thank you, Kuze-san. I hope you're enjoying yourself too.

Shuuichi:
I've never actually had much of an opportunity to roll on the ground for a good time before.

Mizuki:
You're speaking formally again.

Shuuichi:
Huh?

Mizuki:
You keep changing back and forth from formal to informal speech. Just be yourself. It's alright.

Shuuichi:
I am being myself. I just have to watch how I speak in front of the distinguished people in my line of work.
There's a time, place and occasion for everything.

Mizuki:
Let's talk informally, not in work mode for now. I get tired of formal conversation.

Shuuichi:
I'm not following you.

Mizuki:
Girls have to put on a great big act too. I hate being formal.

Shuuichi:
Ah! I'm following now. This is easier for me too.

Mizuki:
Haha, it's like you flipped a switch.

Shuuichi:
When you get older, you'll find that the masks that you wear will become a part of the person you really are.

Mizuki:
Masks?

Shuuichi:
Yes, indeed. People have many masks. As you get older, and you meet more people, you need more masks too.
I guess that's just one of life toppings that comes with being human.

Mizuki:
Well, if you really have to wear something, then I think cat ears are way cuter.

Shuuichi:
A guy in cat ears? That's really kinda creepy.

Mizuki:
I guess you're right.
Kuze-san. You're much more attractive without any mask.
Yes, please flip on your natural switch when you're with me from now on.
It was fun talking with you today.

Shuuichi:
I'm glad you had a good time.

Mizuki:
Okay then. I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

Shuuichi:
See you tomorrow.



Shuuichi:
Masks, huh?
I have to hold out a little longer. Just a little bit. But how much?

Overtures of meetings and reunions. Ef - a tale of melodies. Read. Can you hear the melody of truth?
