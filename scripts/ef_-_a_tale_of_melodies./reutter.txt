  Yu:
Yuko, it's me.

Yuko:
What is it, Himura-senpai?

Yu:
Let's run away together.
l can't stand the thought of you there for another second.

Yuko:
That's selfish of you.

Yu:
Let's start over somewhere far away from him.
Will you come?
Come with me.

Yuko:
You're so demanding.
Fine with me, if that's what you want, I will go.

--opening--
Love, l've got to feel it
lf you put your trust in me
l know what my life would be
Oh, you are all l ever need
l try to hear what you say
So l pray
But you're fading away
Don't go and break my fragile heart
We won't fall apart
'Cause you're my only star
l wonder why my tears come at night
Calling you, so like a little child
All the things you have in mind
l wish l could see your insides
My love, you've got to feel it
And if we put our trust in you and me
You know what our lives would be
Oh, you are the one l believe

Yu:
Kuze. . . Kuze!
Kuze, you all right?
Still alive?

Shuichi:
I open my eyes and see the two of you sitting here looking

at me.
I thought it might be a dream but it's probably hell.

Nagi:
Shall we call 1 -1 -9?

Shuichi:
lt's 0-0-0 here.
l'm fine. No need.
It's done. l just settled things with Mizuki-chan.
The way it ended, she'll never want to see me again. . .
Just the same as my last girlfriend.

Yu:
ldiot!

Shuichi:
Not gonna punch me out?

Yu:
l'm too old for that.
Settling accounts is all fine, but at this rate, you won't

have any memories left.

Shuichi:
There aren't any memories l want to hang on to.

Yu:
Were some good times.

Shuichi:
How about you? Old friend.

Yu:
Who knows? l forgot.

The weather is nice here.
We've gotten pretty far, don't you think?
What shall we do now?

Yuko:
Don't you have a plan?

Yu:
Maybe we should eat first.
First we should look for a realtor and find a place to live.
Then l'll find some kind of job.
What's wrong? Not hungry?

Yuko:
l thought that you didn't eat lunch.

Yu:
l'm not going to have to be so thrifty anymore.

Yuko:
Are you really okay with this?

Yu:
With what?

Yuko:
Weren't you aspiring towards your goal?

Yu:
Don't worry about it.

Yuko:
There's no benefit at all.
And throwing your life and your future away, just to be with

me.

Yu:
Really?

Yuko:
One thing is for sure, you'll end up regreting it.

Yu:
l already did once.
And you know something, l don't want to do it again.
You said you fell in love with me when we met at the

orphanage.

Yuko:
Yes.

Yu:
And now you're saying that you are still in love with me,

right?

Yuko:
Yes.

Yu:
After everything that's happened?

Guest:
Thank you.

Shop owner:
No problem.

Yu:
You usually answer so quickly.
You have to trust when I say I love you.
Even now I feel it.
lt's not a lie.
Yuko. . .

Yuko:
What is it?

Yu:
lt's hard not to blink, but I'm trying.

Guest:
Can you believe that?

Yu:
Damn it! What the hell?

Yuko:
You can't blame them for not wanting to rent
to two young people with dubious backgrounds.

Yu:
What's so dubious?
We're a couple of runaway students.

Yuko:
That's exactly what's so "dubious."

Yu:
This is bad.
lf we can't rent a place, we might have to sleep out in the

cold tonight.

Yuko:
l thought you'd be more organized.

Yu:
This isn't normal. Who plans for this?

Yuko:
l guess it can't be helped.
Could we stay at a hotel tonight?

Yu:
A hotel?

Yuko:
You were thinking dirty thoughts just now, weren't you?

Yu:
N-No! You must be kidding !
Stop-Stop talking nonsense.

Yuko:
You're right about that.
I guess it is nonsense.

Yu:
We'll try one more place.

Yuko:
Okay.

Yuko:
No luck today.

Yu:
Yeah.

Yuko:
We'll have better luck tomorrow.

Yu:
If you say so.

Yuko:
We're not staying at a hotel?
l see.

Yu:
I'm Sorry. lt's not just that.
l want to save money until l find a job.
But without an address, l can't even work.
Things aren't as easy as I wanted them to be.

Yuko:
You're right.

Yu:
l thought you were Christian.

Yuko:
lt's still a god.

Yu:
l don't get it.

Yuko:
Please let us stay the night.

Yu:
We're lucky it's summer.
We'd freeze to death in the winter.

Yuko:
lt's cold at night, even now.
But it's so warm here next to you.
ls it okay?

Yu:
What?

Yuko:
l'm unclean. I need a bath.

Yu:
That doesn't change who you are one little bit.
No matter what you look like, my feelings for you will never

change.

Yuko:
Senpai. . .

Yu:
A tiny studio in a 20 year old building with a communal

kitchen and bathroom.
I can't believe the rent for this dump is higher than my old

place.

Yuko:
Well there's no deposit, immediate occupancy and and they

didn't want to do a background check.
We should consider ourselves lucky.

Yu:
l guess it's an apartment for riffraffs.
We'd better lock up really good.

Yuko:
You don't even have a cell phone.
What could they take?

Yu:
You're right about that.

Yuko:
What do you have there?

Yu:
Akane's keepsake. A red watch l bought her at Christmas.

Yuko:
It's the only thing you have left from your late sister?

Yu:
This is more valuable than you can imagine.

Yuko:
Your sketchbook.

Yu:
ln case l need to kill a little time.

Yuko:
This is. . .

Yu:
Your paper airplane.

Yuko:
I see know.
That's the way it is.
It's clear now.
l'm leaving.

Yu:
Yuko!

Yuko:
ls it sympathy? Pity? No! That's not what l want, or why I

came with you.

Yu:
Wait, Yuko!

Yuko:
No! Don't! Just leave me alone!
I have to go!

Yu:
Yuko!
Wait, Yuko!

Yuko:
Let me go.

Yu:
Calm down!

Yuko:
l was stupid to believe, even for a second.
I'm not important to you.
You only see me as a tool for your own satisfaction.
You don't care how l feel at all.
You're just like Big Brother Akira!

Yu:
Sorry.
Yuko. Maybe you're right.
l am just like Amamiya.
l still regret not being able to protect Akane.
But it's not sympathy.
lt's not pity.
You're not a substitute.
l want to protect you now, Yuko!
Please, Yuko, you've got to believe in me.

Yuko:
Senpai. . .

Yu:
You have to know this, l'll never leave you.

l'm home.

Yuko:
Welcome home, Yu-kun. And how was work today?

Yu:
l'm still training. lt's not work yet.

Yuko:
I've got dinner already. Let's eat while it's hot.

Yu:
Okay.
This looks really nice.

Yuko:
Thank you very much.

Yu:
The light is on.

Yuko:
Of course it is. Even poor people need to have some

electricity.

Yu:
It's not that, when l lived alone, l always came home to a

dark room.
It was sort of depression.
lt's nice to have someone that I can come home to.

Yuko:
Really? But if you ever come home late, l'll turn it off.

Yu:
Huh?

Yuko:
And l'll lock the door on you.

Yu:
Hey.

Yuko:
You won't get in even if you cry.

Yu:
Wait a minute.

Yuko:
So come home early.
Your home is my home.
This is my home, too.
We're sharing our lives.
I'm so happy, this is the life I've always dreamed about.

Yu:
Yeah.

Yuko:
Are you sure it's all right?

Yu:
What?

Yuko:
l know, but l'm a burden to you.

Yu:
Why?

Yuko:
You had to throw away everything you've worked for.
Your education, your home, every thing.

Yu:
l'll get it all back.
Don't worry.

Yuko:
Yu-kun. . .

Yu:
Let's start fresh.

Yuko:
Yu-kun. . .

Yu:
What is it?

Yuko:
I'd like for you to draw me.

Yu:
Yuko?
l'm not good at portraits, but l'll give it a try.

yuko:
Okay.

Shuichi:
When l told her about my ex-girlfriend,
she cried for me.
l didn't even cry.
l don't know why, but l feel like crying now.
I told her off, and she just stood there, looking at me.

Nagi:
Kuze. . .

Shuichi:
l never failed because l always ran away before it could

happen.
It was always so simple.
And now this...
Why make me take on a fight l can't run away from?
Why make me take on a fight l can't win?
Why is this happening to me.

Yu:
Kuze. . .

Shuichi:
My heart. . . Mizuki. . . What am l supposed to do when l

know l'm going to die?
What more can l do?
Just tell me!

Yu:
Kuze, l understand how you feel, but. . .

Shuichi:
How can you understand?
l'm broken and you're not.
How can you understand?

Nagi:
But wallowing in this kind of despair won't do you any good.

Shuichi:
What good will anything do when l'm going to die?

Yu:
Nothing will happen if you just lie down and give up.

Shuichi:
You are the good one to bring that out.
Pathetic man who's dragging out a pointless battle from the

past that's gone on for far too long.

Nagi:
Kuze! Stop!

Yu:
lt's not over yet.

Shuichi:
You must be joking.
You'll never see her again.
You know it's true.
You'll never see Yuko Amamiya again.

Akira:
You are going home?

Yu:
Amamiya. . .

Akira:
Are you earning enough to support my sister?
No one wants to hire a drop-out.

Yu:
What are you doing here?

Akira:
Oh, just came to buy cigarettes.

Yu:
l won't give Yuko back.

Akira:
That's not really up to you now, is it?

Yu:
What?

Akira:
Of course it's actually not up to me, either.

Yu:
Do you think Yuko will go back to you?

Akira:
Maybe. lf the poor girl has nowhere else to go.
You honestly can't be her "home" now, can you?

Yu:
What?

Akira:
You're a place to run away to.
Not a place to go home to.
That's because you're still running away yourself.

Yu:
l'm not running away!

Akira:
But you did. On the day of the earthquake.
You abandoned your little sister.
Ever since that day, you've ceased to fight and continue to

run.
That's why you abandoned Yuko, too.
You stopped drawing, discarded your colors and you ran away

from me.
Threw away everything you built up and fled.

Yu:
No! That's not true.

Akira:
Are you still running?
ln the end, all you do is run.

Yu:
What else could l have done?

Akira:
You know the answer, don't you?
Don't be so careless.
You really should buy a good lock.
What you could have done was the honorable thing and die at

your sister side in the earthquake that took her life.
l know because l wanted to do the same thing.
You had the opportunity, I didn't.
You were right there with her.
But I wasn't with my sister that day.
l'm envious of you, but...l also hate you.
You were with your sister that day, yet you abandoned her.
You didn't even help her, you ran.
You didn't die with her, you ran.
You loved your sister, but you ran.
She was terrified, calling out for you, but you ran.
You could have died with her, but you ran.
lt's a fate l could only hope for, but you ran.
Have you made it up to her?
Has she forgiven you?
Are you in a position to be happy?
It's very easy to see the [joy] running again.
And because of that, you will lose your own place to return

to.

Yuko:
He's gone again. . .

Yu:
Am I running away? Am I running away again?

Yuko:
Yu-kun. . . Yu-kun. . .?
Yu-kun, where are you?
Come home, Senpai.
Where have you gone?
Senpai? Himura-senpai?
Where are you, Senpai? Where are you?
Senpai?
Brother! Brother! Where are you?
Senpai! Brother!
It's you, brother. . .

Akira:
Welcome home.
Are you ready to go?

Nagi:
Yu!

Yu:
You wanted me to punch you.
Are you satisfied?

Shuichi:
It's true.
You'll never see Yuko Amamiya again.

Nagi:
Kuze!

Shuichi:
l'll regret it if l don't say it.
You need to stop dragging your past around and settle

things, Yu.

Nagi:
Kuze. There are some things that should never be said.

Shuichi:
Oh? Speaking of "things not said", tell me, have you settled your feelings for him now, Nagi?

Nagi:
Just leave him alone.

Shuichi:
Why do you exist?

Mizuki:
l haven't had that dream in a really long time.

Renji's Mother:
Mizuki-chan, a package just came for you.

Mizuki:
A package for me?
This is Kuze-san's. . .
The delivery man must have made a mistake.

Renji's Mother:
But it was delivered to this address and it's your name on the [lable], Mizuki-chan.

Mizuki:
Kuze-san was the one. . .that was broken.

Nagi:
Salt water isn't good for violins.

Mizuki:
It's you.

Nagi:
Tears aren't good for them either.

Mizuki:
I'm not ashamed to admit it, l was devastated when you said
you were his girlfriend.

Nagi:
Physical separation doesn't necessarily mean that everything

has been settled . . . if you still care.

Mizuki:
Settled . . .?

Nagi:
"lf you fall in love, you're the one who's the loser.
Make them fall in love with you first."
That was Kuze's motto.

Mizuki:
lt sounds like him.

Nagi:
But not this time.
You're in love with him, but he's the loser.

Mizuki:
l doubt it.
l was totally defeated.
I don't know what to do.
l want to cry.

Nagi:
But. . .you won't back down.
He's never fought a losing battle before.
so he could never beat someone who keeps coming back, even

if they've lost.
You need to know this, you're the only one who can save him now.

An unexpected fate breaks my heart. . .

Can you hear the melody of truth?
