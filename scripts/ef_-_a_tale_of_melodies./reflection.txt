Love, l've got to feel it
lf you put your trust in me
l know what my life would be
Oh, you are all l ever need
l try to hear what you say
So l pray
But you're fading away
Don't go and break my fragile heart
We won't fall apart
'Cause you're my only star
l wonder why my tears come at night
Calling you, so like a little child
All the things you have in mind
l wish l could see your insides
My love, you've got to feel it
And if we put our trust in you and me
You know what our lives would be
Oh, you are the one l believe

Yu:
No . . . l . . . I can't believe.
I...l let go of her hand !

Yuko:
That's right. lt's your fault, Yu-kun.

Yu:
Did l abandon you? Again?

Shuichi:
lf it's attainable,l'll get it.
lf it's not,l don't want it.
l'll only take on a fight l can win.
lf not, l won't even try.
To do otherwise is fear.
It's funny if l stop to think about it, that's how l've lived my life, day in and day out.

Nagi:
Hey, l just sorted those.

Shuichi:
Entropy always increases.

Nagi:
Decreasing in order to increase is kind of meaningless.

Shuichi:
l agree.
And you know whatelse is meaningless?
Meeting someone you'll have to part with.
Wait, does that mean living in order to die is meaningless, too?

Nagi:
Kuze, are you sure you did the right thing with that girl?

Shuichi:
Yes, of course. Danke, Nagi.
Now l can spend what time l have left in peace.

Mizuki:
I just know it, l'm going to have that dream again. . .

Yuko:
What is it you want, senpai?

Yu:
Are you going back home?
Back to Amamiya?

Yuko:
Of course. lt's where I live.

Yu:
Don't!

Yuko:
Why is that?

Yu:
lf you go back, is only. . .

Yuko:
I know, but lt's the only home that l have.

Yu:
l won't let you go back to him!

Yuko:
Please let go.

Yu:
You really want to go back and let this continue?
I won't let you.

Yuko:
You're too late.

Nagi:
Since when did you take up weeding as a hobby, Yu?

Yu:
Nagi. . .
l heard. When did you become Kuze's fiancee?

Nagi:
lt was really the best way for things to be handled.

Yu:
lt's such a farce.

Nagi:
That's kind of irrelevant. Kuze got results.
He just wanted Mizuki-chan to stay away from him.
The word "fiancee" is meaningless.
The label is completely unimportant.
The truth is what lies inside.

Yu:
Then why does kuze feel he has to hide the truth?

Nagi:
Kuze liked me back when we were in high school.
Didn't you know?

Yu:
No. l didn't.

Nagi:
Kuze always knew that l had feelings for you.
That's why he never said anything.

Yu:
l see. l'm surprised that a womanizer like him would choose friendship over love.

Nagi:
That's not the reason.
He never takes on a fight he can't win.
He was just like me, back in those days.

Yu:
Nagi. . .

Nagi:
Yu, are you still trying to fight that old battle?

Yu:
Who knows? l forgot.

Nagi:
You're looking backwards.

Yu:
l have eyes in the back of my head. And . . .
My battle is far from over.

Why are you telling me this now?

Yuko:
Telling you what?

Yu:
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

Yuko:
You're asking the impossible.
Would anything have changed?
Would you have done something?
Tell me this, would you. . . still have fallen in love with a damaged person like me?

Yu:
That's. . .

Yuko:
You're so cruel.
This is revenge. . . for you abandoning me.
It was my small act of revenge toward you.
But what did l expect?
Even in the depths of despair at that orphanage, you were always so independent.
You resolved everything on your own, from beginning to end.
There was no room for me.
But l wanted to share a portion of my pain with you.
So that you would know the suffering I have endured.
I knew it wasn't very nice, so I knew what I had to do.
So l approached you and tried to get you to fall in love with me.
l cut up my own shoes with this.

Yu:
So. . . the bullying . . .

Yuko:
The bullying was real. l knew it would appeal to your sense of justice so l used it.
"lf you hate me, just kill me."
That's what my brother said when he gave me this on that Christmas eve.
lt's my good luck charm.
As long as l have it, l know that l can end my misery anytime that l want.
lt's the only real comfort that l have in my life.

Mizuki:
could you please tell me about Kuze-san?

Yu:
Ask him yourself.

Mizuki:
l would if l could.

Yu:
You're going to have to try, young lady, lt's called "making an effort."

Mizuki:
l already thought about it and concluded that asking you would be the quickest way to find out about him.

Yu:
So you confessed your love and were rejected . . .
You're lucky that's all the pain you'll have to suffer. He's an adult.

Mizuki:
l'm not a little child !

Yu:
lt must be hard with two such forward thinking people.

Mizuki:
l think Kuze-san is looking backwards right now.

Yu:
He has eyes in the back of his head.
lf you really want to confront Kuze, you should remember one thing.
You can rely on him, but you can't trust him.

Mizuki:
Why is that?

Yu:
Because he's a liar.

Mizuki:
A liar?

Yu:
That's all you need to know.

Mizuki:
You're wrong about him, Kuze-san is not a liar.
lf he was a liar, he could have easily said that he didn't like me.
He's so honest, it only looks like he's lying.

Kei:
That's all the information that's disclosed.

Mizuki:
l see. . .

Kei:
Hiro was shocked when l told him about Kuze-san.

Mizuki:
I didn't realize Hiro-senpai knows who Kuze-san is.

Kei:
He's a big fan of Shuichi Kuze.
That's all he listens to when he's working.

Mizuki:
Oh, l see.

Kei:
Hiro says he sees colors in Kuze-san's music.

Mizuki:
Colors?

Kei:
He says that all the colors in the world are packed into that man's music.
l don't get it, though.

Mizuki:
l do.
I totally understand.
It's Kuze-san's violin, it is so brilliant and deep.
His tone is so clear and beautiful.
But the last time that l heard him play it, something was missing.
It was like some colors were missing.

Kei:
Wait just a minute.
"ls he doubting himself?"
"lt may not be the same for everyone, but self-doubt causes colors to fade."
"Maybe his colors were missing because something is troubling him."

Mizuki:
Hiro-senpai sure sounds like a know-it-all.

Kei:
lt's Miyamura-senpai.
Miyamura-senpai and Hiro were searching for their missing colors, too.
And so was l.
l'm no expert, but l'm sure anyone facing their own mortality would struggle with self-doubt.
Maybe that's why he's been letting some things go.
I would think knowing that you're going to die would make that doubt even worse.

Mizuki:
you mean, he's letting things go because of self-doubt?

Kei:
Sometimes it's hard to hold on to the things that you love.

Akira:
What is it. . .Himura-kun?
l see then. lt's about Yuko.

Yu:
Yes.

Akira:
So she finally got up the nerve to tell you?
l never told the poor girl to keep it a secret.
I wonder What took her so long?

Yu:
Hey.

Akira:
Hm? You have no idea why you are here, do you, boy?

Yu:
What are you talking about?
Do you know what you've done?

Akira:
Did you come here to avenge her violated on her?
That's just fine with me. Come on, Kill me.
Please. Be my guest.
But what happens then?
You're an ambitious student on your own scholarship, If I'm not mistaken.
l'm joking. You wouldn't consider such trivial matters...would you?
Did Yuko ake you to come here and kill me?

Yu:
Yuko would never do that.

Akira:
So then, you are saying you want to kill me?

Yu:
That's not it.

Akira:
Please don't tell me that you're doing this for Yuko.
Dear God. You're such a child.

Yu:
What?

Akira:
Tell me something, do you see colors?
Your assumptions will end up making Yuko miserable.
Yuko is scared to death of being alone. . .
Ever since you rejected her as a little girl at that orphanage.
How can you deprive her of a place to come home to?

Yu:
This is no home for Yuko!

Akira:
l see. So is that your decision?
Then go ahead, do as you like.
Why do you think it might be, that little Yuko hasn't gone to the school, police or anyone else?
She is a young girl, after all.
How can she tell anyone about the things that have happened to her?
lf l die, everything that happened would come out in the open. Every single thing.
You will expose Yuko's shame to the world and humiliate her beyond your widest imagination.
What's wrong? Chickening out?
Aren't you going to kill me?
This is why you're here, right?
Do it.
You don't even have the guts to kill a fly!
You're just a pathetic kid with a keen sense of justice!
You could do it if you were serious!
Don't hesitate!
Get mad !
Hate me!
Kill me, if you're serious!
l told you. lf you want Yuko, then you need to be prepared.
I did warn you.
Next time, boy, you'd better be serious. . . or else l'll kill you dead.

Shuichi:
Hey, Nagi. Did you get me cigarettes?

Mizuki:
Good evening, Kuze-san.

Shuichi:
A violinist was hiking in the mountains.
He knew the roads well, but for one moment he let down his guard, and the poor musician slipped and fell.
As a violinist, he did everything he could to protect his hand.
As a result, he hit his head and died.
l told you l never wanted to see you again.

Mizuki:
l just wanted to talk to you. . .

Shuichi:
We have nothing to talk about.

Mizuki:
Fine we can just go get some ice cream or something.
It will be my treat!

Shuichi:
Get out of my sight.

Mizuki:
What should l do?

Shuichi:
About what?

Mizuki:
I don't want things to be this way.
l can't leave you.

Shuichi:
Mizuki-chan, do you love me?

Mizuki:
Yes.

Shuichi:
Really?

Mizuki:
Yes.

Shuichi:
Why?

Mizuki:
Why?

Shuichi:
Why are you standing there?
How can you be so shameless?
Why are you looking at my eyes?
Why are you listening to my voice?
Why are you here?
Why are you talking to me?
Why are you bothering me?
Why are you interfering?
Why won't you leave me alone?
Why did we meet?
Why did you get to know me?
Why did you come into my life?
Why do you hang around?
Why are you smiling?
Why do you care?
Why are you happy?
Why are you cheerful?
Why aren't you crying?
Why are you so upbeat?
Why are you having fun?
Why do you watch everything?
Why do you know everything?
Why are you so forgiving?
Why does everything delight you?
Why do you make me doubt?
Why do you unnerve me?
Why do you confuse me?
Why do you hurt me?
Why do you make me suffer?
Why do you corner me?
Why do you bully me?
Why do you step all over me?
Why do you torture me?
Why do you break me?
Why do you tear me apart?
Why are you beating me up?
Why won't you let me be?
Why don't you understand me?
Why do you give me hope?
Why do you make me despair?
Why do you force yourself on me?
Why do you bind me?
Why do you disturb me?
Why do you love me?
Why? Why? Why? Why?

Mizuki:
Uh. . . um. . .

Shuichi:
Why are you trying to answer?

Mizuki:
Because. . .

Shuichi:
Why do you act like you know me?
Why aren't you gone?
Why are you still here?
Why. . .do you exist?
Why? Why is this happening?
Why? lt's so useless.
Why? lt's so idiotic. . .
Why? l can't die yet...die yet.
There are still things l want to do...places l want to see.. .I don't want to die.
l still want to...l still want to play...violin...my music.
l'll live, even if l die. l'll live. . .
l want to live. . . l still want to. . .
l don't want to die! Mizuki!
l want to live!

Akira:
Welcome back, Yuko.

Yuko:
l'm home.

Akira:
You'll catch a cold. Go change.

Yuko:
Yes, brother.
Why?
Why now?
