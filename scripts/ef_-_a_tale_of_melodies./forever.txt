  Yu:
l'm going to work on the project.
l won't be back for a while.
Your dream. . . may become a reality.
Okay. l'm going, Yuko.

Chihiro:
Renji-kun, time to get up, Renji-kun!

Renji:
Well, Good morning . . .

Chihiro:
Merry Christmas, Renji-kun!
Renji-kun!

Renji:
M-Merry Christmas. . . Chihiro.

Chihiro:
l just went to wake Renji-kun up for you.

Renji's mother:
Thank you very much.
It's not to bad if I do say so.
How is it, Chihiro-chan?

Chihiro:
It tests delicious!

Renji's mother:
lt's nice and sunny today.
A beautiful day for Christmas!

Hiro:
Finished at last!
Good morning, Miyako.

Miyako:
That's not the greeting today.
It's Christmas morning, Hiro-kun.

Hiro:
There's no such thing as Christmas or New Year's for manga artists.

Miyako:
Couldn't you try and have a normal life with me every once in a while?

Hiro:
But I still have New Year's deadlines I have to get on!

Miyako:
That's not romantic at all.

Hiro:
Come on in. lt's cold outside.

Miyako:
Okay.

Kyosuke:
Wow! Look at all this snow!

Kei:
lt's a white Christmas.

Kyosuke:
lt looks like an entirely different world right now.

Kei:
lt's so white and so beautiful.

Kyosuke's ex-girlfriend:
I really wish the two of you would stop talking and help me.
This won't put themselves up.
Now hurry or you'll miss the opening.

Kyosuke:
Okay! l'll be back in just a little bit.

Kei:
Kyosuke, l want to help, too.

Kyosuke:
Why don't you take it easy?

Kei:
lt's too cold to stay still.

Kyosuke:
Okay, then come with us, Kei-chan.

Kyosuke's ex-girlfriend:
How annoying.

Mizuki:
Which one should l wear?
l like this one, but this one's pretty, too. . .
Or what about this new one?
Which one should l wear, Shuichi?

Nagi:
Hey.

Yu:
Nagi. lt's been a while. When did you arrive?

Nagi:
Just a little while ago. l left Japan yesterday.
Wow! Your landscapes are still amazing.

Yu:
One thing is for sure, my portraits haven't improved.

Nagi:
You're artistically gifted. 
But your basics still need work.

Yu:
But basics are the foundation of everything.

Nagi:
Technically speaking, yes.
But a work of art with passion trumps technique.

Yu:
You're still lecturing me about art, nothing changes.

Nagi:
l'm your art master, until l decide to excommunicate you,
so at that rate, you'll be my disciple forever.

Yu:
I couldn't think of a better artist to follow.

Nagi:
How's Kuze doing?

Yu:
He has to take it easy, but he's fine.
And . . .

Nagi:
l see. l figured.

Yu:
Where are you staying while you are in town?

Nagi:
Well, since you asking, l thought l'd stay with you for a while.

Yu:
You can't.

Nagi:
Why not?

Yu:
We finished the first phase of the project.
l'm returning to Japan soon.
l decided to leave Chihiro in Renji's care.

Nagi:
l see.

Yu:
Go stay with Kuze. 
I'm sure he'd welcome the company.

Nagi:
He sure has changed.

Yu:
Good for him.

Nagi:
Hey, Yu.

Yu:
What?

Nagi:
Are you still thinking about...Yuko?
You can tell me if you are.

Yu:
Who knows? l've forgotten.

Nagi:
Well, l don't know if l should tell you this. . .

Yu:
What is it?

Yu:
Shouldn't you take it easy?
You must be tired.

Shuichi:
Exercise in moderation.
lf it will help me live one minute longer,l'll believe whatever the doctors tell me.
"Faith can make anything holy" l guess.
Results are the only thing that matter now.
I'm glad, l'm alive to see another Christmas with friend.

Yu:
Are you satisfied?

Shuichi:
This world is worse than l ever imagined...
and better than l ever expected.

Yu:
l guess you'll be fine without me.

Shuichi:
She'll be an adult soon.

Yu:
Yeah.

Shuichi:
She'll really blossom a year from now.

Yu:
It's true.

Shuichi:
And even more so the year after.

Yu:
Yeah, you're right.

Shuichi:
l do wonder how long l would be able to watch her blossom.

Yu:
lf you want to find out, live a long life.

Shuichi:
l will. lf l have to cling on.

Yu:
You and Chihiro are going to be fine.
l guess my job is over.
l have to say good-bye for a while.

Shuichi:
Good-bye?

Yu:
l'm going back to the real Otowa.
lt's a little early, but l want to get there by Christmas.

Shuichi:
Did something happen?

Yu:
l don't know. l'm going to find out.

Shuichi:
lt's cold over there. Bring some warm clothes.
A bon voyage gift.

Yu:
This is. . .

Shuichi:
Where it all started.
lt's some miracle worker.
You may not believe it, but it worked for me.

Yu:
Danke, Kuze.

Shuichi:
Gute reise, old friend.

Nagi:
Well...l don't know if l should tell you this. . .but

Yu:
What is it?

Nagi:
When l went back home to Japan, my brother said something really strange.

Yu:
Hiro?

Nagi:
Yeah. He claims that he met her in that church.

Yu:
Who are you talking about?

Nagi:
Yuko.

Yu:
What?

Nagi:
Hiro said that he met Yuko Amamiya.

Yuko:
l'm sorry to tell you this, but the mass is already over.

Yu:
l'm not a religious person.
There's someone l have to meet. And you?

Yuko:
Me? l'm. . . just waiting for someone.

Yu:
l made you wait for such a long time.

Yuko:
Yes. l waited . . . but just a little while.

Yu:
l'm terribly sorry, Yuko.

Yuko:
lt's been quite a while, Yu-kun. 
But you remembered and you came back here.

Yu:
l haven't forgotten for one second.
This is the Christmas present l never got to give you.

Yuko:
Thank you. 
But l don't have anything that I can give you in return.

Yu:
You...already gave me your gift.

Yuko:
You got it.
Merry Christmas.

Yu:
Merry Christmas.

Yuko:
lt's so quiet tonight.

Yu:
As if we're the only two people in the world.

Yuko:
Just you and me. lt sounds like fun.

Yu:
Yes.

Yuko:
But knowing you, you'll only start to bully me since no one's around watching us, you know.

Yu:
That's so rude.

Yuko:
I'm sorry, but l really hope no one disturbs us tonight while we have this time together.

Yu:
Me, too. l was finally able to fulfill my promise to you.

Yuko:
lt took a long time. l suppose Miki's all grown up now, isn't she?

Yu:
She's enjoying a sunny Christmas with Kuze.

Yuko:
A sunny Christmas?

Yu:
Don't you remember?
Do you want to go to Australia?

Yuko:
No, it's okay. As long as Miki is enjoying it, I'm content with that.

Yu:
l see.

Yuko:
l still can't believe that we're reunited.

Yu:
The love created by every life we touched...formed a bond that brought us together.
That's how l feel.

Yuko:
That's very romantic. It's really unlike you.

Yu:
There's no such thing as miracles.
Only the inevitable and accidental. And what we do.
l always believed that.

Yuko:
That's exactly how it should be.
You should now by now that miracles don't happen to those who wait.
God helps those who strive to make miracles happen.
I guess we both prove of that.

Yuko:
You should understand that l was given a mission here.

Yu:
What kind of a mission?

Yuko:
To remain kind. 
To be kind to as many people as possible.
My job was to serve others.
It's the mission I was given, so it was what l have to do.
It was what I told to do.

Yu:
By whom?

Yuko:
Who knows?
I think that maybe it was God.

Yu:
God?

Yuko:
You used to say that there is no god.
Do you remember?

Yu:
Yeah.

Yuko:
Do you still believe that?

Yu:
Don't know, but l'll continue to believe in myself and those around me.
l only know how to be me.

Yuko:
That is so like you.

Yu:
Yuko, let's go somewhere.

Yuko:
Eh?

Yu:
To where you and l began.

Yuko:
Yes!

Yuko:
l always wanted to do this.

Yu:
Yeah.

Yuko:
My dream has finally come true.

Yu:
Yuko, there's something l wanted to say to you.
I love you.
l love you...Yuko.

Yuko:
Yu-kun. . .

Yu:
l love you, Yuko. l'm sorry l was never able to say it.

Yuko:
You're mistaken.

Yu:
What?

Yuko:
You mean, you "loved" me.

Yu:
Yuko. . .

Yuko:
l was so very happy. Truly happy that l met you and that you loved me.Thank you for loving me.
And thank you for making me so happy.

Yu:
That should be my line.

Yuko:
l think that my job here has finally come to the end.

Yu:
So. . . you're leaving now?

Yuko:
l'm sorry. You have the power to decide your own destiny, so please follow your dream.

Yu:
Okay. l'll move forward.

Yuko:
l'm really sorry.

Yu:
Don't apologize. l'll be just fine.

Yuko:
Yu-kun!

Yu:
l'm not so lonely anymore. l can move forward, go on my own now.
l'll be fine. Don't worry.

Yuko:
That's the Yu-kun l know and love.
Please share the happiness you gave me with the people around you.
That way, the love and happiness gives back to everyone and then it will come full circle one day.

Yu:
lt will. lt will reach us wherever we are, no matter how far.

Yuko:
Today was wonderful. lt was like a dream.

Yu:
lt's not a dream.

Yuko:
Memories are so precious, but l want you to always look forward.
And don't look back anymore.
Please don't look back. Be happy. That's my wish.
That was always my wish for you.

Yu:
Okay.

Yuko:
Good-bye, Yu-kun.
l always loved you.
And I always [?].

Yu:
She's really something else. . .
Even angels need to rest sometimes.

Mizuki:
What exactly are you, Himura-san?

Yu:
An architect. My job is to make sure the residents here are happy.
And that it's a beautiful place to live.

Mizuki:
lt looks just like Otowa in Japan.
lt's like we're living in some sort of beautiful dream.

Yu:
Everything begins with a dream.
The desire to fly, see the bottom of the ocean,
explore space, reach a distant star.

Mizuki:
Keep believing in your dream.
That's the first step in making your dream come true.

Yu:
l wanted to create a beautiful town.
Where people are kind, and there's no loneliness.
A happy town with a future.

Mizuki:
lt's a wonderful dream.

Yu:
My dream became reality in two forms.
Two towns named Otowa.
The real one built upon the charred remains of rubble. . .
and a false one casting its shadow over a tranquil, beautiful land.

Mizuki:
But it's not false.
lt's all, all, all real! The town and the people.
Everything about it is real.
That's because a white lie isn't really a lie at all, is it?
The town we built together
--- for the people that we love,
it's dedicated to those we love.
Both towns are filled with real love and happiness.

Yu:
You know something, l guess you're right.

Mizuki:
l'm sorry. lt's a bad habit of mine.

Yu:
l don't need to hold your hand?

Mizuki:
Not at all. l'm not a little kid anymore.

Yu:
Are you sure?

Mizuki:
You've always been like a father to me, Himura-san.

Yu:
l wouldn't mind . . . Do you still have scary dreams?

Mizuki:
No, not anymore.

Yu:
You know, l never asked your real name.

Mizuki:
Mizuki Hayama.
But you know, l was called Miki when l was still a little kid.
lt means "the future."

Yu:
l see.
That's a good name.


The wind blows through the town.

The wind would be cold and may stop you in your tracks, but. . .

When it does, just keep moving forward, one step at a time.

You'll reach your destination one day.

Even if you're sad, you'll be okay. lf you just reach out your hand...

Someone will be there to share their warmth with you.

A path no matter how difficult can be crossed, as long as you keep holding on to that hand.

So Please, never give up. There's happiness at the end of the long, long journey.
And that happiness will grow, bring warmth to the people around you.

And l hope that you will realize one day. . .
That you were the happiness in someone else's darkness.

Don't forget that you're not alone.
You'll leave your footprints, they'll reach beyond time and you'll look up into the heavens.

And realize, you can go there, even if you don't have wings. . .

To that brilliant and shining tomorrow.

To tomorrow of our dreams.

---The end---
