Yuu:
Yuuko and I met as children in a church-run orphanage. There were so many abandoned children there. And Yuuko and I were among them. Then Yuuko was adopted by a family, and I, however, remained at the orphanage. That was the full extent of our interaction.

Akane:
Brother, please!

Why did I have to remember?

Shuuichi:
Step right up! Come closer and take a look! I got plenty of stuff here for the discriminating buyer.
It may be out of season, but this sweater is not your ordinary sweater.

Yuu:
How is it different?

Shuuichi:
Hey, Himura! You wanna buy this sweater?

Yuu:
I’m not interested in your hand-me-downs, Kuze.

Shuuichi:
You are so cold.

Yuu:
What’s going on? I thought they said you didn’t have to come to school any more.

Shuuichi:
Well, look around! I still have a lot of stuff to clear out.

Yuu:
You mean girls?

Shuuichi:
I disposed of them, first.

Yuu:
That’s so typical of you.

Yuuko:
Excuse me, how much is this?

Shuuichi:
Oh, you’ve got a great eye, young lady.
Present for your boyfriend?

Yuuko:
I’d like to hope so. Right, Himura-senpai?



Yuuko:
Himura-senpai?

Yuu:
What do you want?

Yuuko:
Do I have to want something to talk to you?

Yuu:
Did you forget I told you to stay away from me?

Yuuko:
Oh, I remember very well.

Yuu:
Then why?

Yuuko:
How you react to things is not something I can control.
But my actions are solely up to me and they’re not yours to choose.

Yuu:
Huh?

Yuuko:
You have a couple of minutes?



Yuu:
Yuuko, didn’t you say the astrology club was disbanded?

Yuuko:
Yeah.

Yuu:
So why do you still have the key to the roof?
You shouldn’t have access to it.

Yuuko:
It was just a small little club with a very long history.
I guess that it was probably an upperclassman.

Yuu:
They made a spare key without permission?

Yuuko:
It’s been passed down from one student to another.
I got it when they decided to disband the club.
 School life is always much more interesting with a little intrigue thrown in, don’t you think?

Yuu:
Not for me. I just want my school life to be as uneventful as possible.

Yuuko:
Look at you, acting so mature and all.

Yuu:
I can’t afford to cause any problems.

Yuuko:
Himura-senpai?

Yuu:
What?

Yuuko:
Will you tell me what happened to you after I left the orphanage?

Yuu:
What good would that do?
I stayed at that orphanage a long time and then I left when I was accepted into this school.
And that’s it. That’s my story.

Yuuko:
You had to stay there… all that time?

Yuu:
There was no one crazy enough to adopt me.
I worked hard to become completely independent.
And that way I wouldn’t have to rely on anyone for anything ever again.

Yuuko:
How are you… Otowa’s tuition isn’t cheap?

Yuu:
I’m a special case.
They waived my entrance fee and tuition.
I can’t afford to jeopardize it.
I’m doing everything I can just to survive in this world.
Yuuko.

Yuuko:
Yes?

Yuu:
I’ll say this one more time. Don’t come near me again.
Don’t make me remember the past.

Yuuko:
You should just forget everything.
And you should completely forget about that old red watch.

Yuu:
How do you know about…

Yuuko:
You still dream about those things every night, don’t you?



Shuuichi:
That's perfect timing.

Mizuki:
Good morning, Kuze-san. How are you?

Shuuichi:
Morning. I’m fine, Mizuki.
You sure you don’t have anywhere you want to go?
I mean you came all the way to Australia. It’d be a shame if you didn’t do anything special while you’re here.

Mizuki:
But this town is supposed to be exactly the same as Otowa in Japan, isn’t it?

Shuuichi:
Yea, I suppose so.

Mizuki:
Plus, doing laundry and spending time with you is something special for me.

Shuuichi:
Laundry on your vacation?

Mizuki:
Everyday is special for me. Vacation or not. It’s all about the attitude you have.

Shuuichi:
You’re so positive.

Mizuki:
People tell me that all the time, but life is more fun that way.



Renji:
Oh. Kuze-san. What are you guys doing here?

Shuuichi:
Good morning, Renji. How’s the studying going so far?

Renji:
Ugh… I’m totally screwed, seriously.

Shuuichi:
Oh, well, continue to suffer away, young man.

Mizuki:
Kuze-san and I are doing laundry. So I need you to give me your dirty clothes, right now.

Renji:
Huh? Thanks, but I can do it by myself.

Mizuki:
We’re doing it anyway, so hand them over!

Renji:
I said don’t worry about it. I need to focus on studying so leave me alone.

Mizuki:
Well I see then. So if that’s how you feel, I’ll just have to take them by force.

Renji:
Eh? Hey Mizuki, wait!

Mizuki:
Take it off.

Renji:
This is completely ridiculous.

Mizuki:
Hey, you have a towel?
That’s just one more thing for me to wash.
Hand it over right now.

Renji:
Eh, no! Give me a break.

Mizuki:
He’s acting like some innocent little girl. There’s no need for him to be embarrassed.

Shuuichi:
Well, he’s at a sensitive age.
So, is there anything I can help you with over there?

Mizuki:
Oh, I’m just sorting colors from whites.

Shuuichi:
I could sort Sumire’s underwear for you.

Mizuki:
Hmph, I’ve sorted them already.

Shuuichi:
Then what on earth am I doing here in the first place?

Mizuki:
Tsk. Tsk. Tsk.
The best part of laundry is hanging stuff up to dry.
I love this smell of freshly washed sheets. Doesn’t it smell wonderful?

Shuuichi:
Umm…

Mizuki:
Kuze-san, tell me something. What made you start playing the violin?

Shuuichi:
Well, let me think. Maybe it was meeting Johann Maelzel’s daughter in the music room. That was it.

Mizuki:
Johann Maelzel’s daughter?

Shuuichi:
She was serious, and subdued, and she was always there, but always treated everyone fairly and equally.
She was my first love.
She taught me so many things that still apply today.
Justice, order, the harsh reality of life. I finally figured it out.
She was born in 1815.

Mizuki:
1815? But that was over two hundred years ago.
I thought that she was your music teacher.

Shuuichi:
She’s actually my greatest music teacher.
I believe you might’ve heard of her. Her name is Metronome.

Mizuki:
You’re terrible.

Shuuichi:
Are you mad?

Mizuki:
Do you want me to be?

Shuuichi:
Well I have to admit you are cuter when you’re a little bit mad.

Mizuki:
I’m what?
The- The washing machine is done. But please help me hang the clothes to dry.

Shuuichi:
Ha-ha-ha.

Mizuki:
Kuze-san? Kuze-san?
What’s wrong, Kuze-san? Ambulance, I need an ambulance!
Why isn’t anyone answering?

Shuuichi:
Sumire-san…

Mizuki:
I can’t just leave him laying there like this, can I?
I didn’t mean any harm.
I guess this is the best that I can do.
Kuze-san? Are you doing okay, Kuze-san?

Shuuichi:
If an angel smiles down on me.

Mizuki:
I guess that means you’re fine.

Shuuichi:
This is a dream?

Mizuki:
I wonder sometimes.

Shuuichi:
I can’t sleep.
I have nightmares when I’m by myself.

Mizuki:
You’ll be fine.
I’m right here beside you.
Sweet dreams.

Shuuichi:
Huh, why am I here?

Mizuki:
Oh, you are up, Kuze-san?

Shuuchi:
Mizuki. Was I sleeping?

Mizuki:
Yes, very deeply.

Shuuichi:
Sorry, Mizuki. It seems like a waste of your whole day.

Mizuki:
It’s fine. A relaxing day like this is a nice change of pace every once in a while.

Shuuichi:
Well then I promise I’ll make it up to you tomorrow.

Mizuki:
I’m counting on it.
What’s that?

Shuuichi:
Oh, it’s nothing.



Yuu:
What are you doing?

Shuuichi:
Parting with the sweet memories.

Yuu:
An old girlfriend?

Shuuichi:
It was returned undeliverable. I’m guessing that she must’ve moved.

Yuu:
So that’s it?

Shuuichi:
What other choice is there?
I thought I disposed of everything. Why did this come back?
It reminds me of the past. Why now? Especially now.

Yuu:
Especially now?

Shuuchi:
Uh… It’s nothing.

Yuu:
So it would seem her letter wasn’t the only thing that came back.

Shuuichi:
I thought I had discarded all of my former relationships. Why is it happening now?
Wow, how unusual! A letter from Nagi. I wonder how she is.

Yuu:
And what does Nagi have to say?

Shuuichi:
Who knows?

Yuu:
So tell me this. What are you going to do now?

Shuuichi:
What else?
I’m discarding everything. That’s all.





Yuu:
Akane.

Akane:
Brother!

Yuuko:
Brother?

Yuu:
Akane?

Yuuko:
Let’s go play!
What’s wrong? Brother, brother!
Wow, you’re drawing. That’s great. brother Yuu!

Yuu:
I said stop calling me brother.

Yuuko:
But why?

Yuu:
Just don’t do it.
I’m not your brother and you’re not my sister.

Yuuko:
Wh-What should I call you then?

Yuu;
Who cares?

Yuuko:
How about Yuu-kun?

Yuu:
Hmm.

Yuuko:
Do you really like drawing, Yuu-kun?

Yuu:
Kind of.

Yuuko:
You’re really good at it, Yuu-kun.

Yuu:
Thank you. What do you want?

Yuuko:
Yuu-kun.

Yuu:
What?

Yuuko:
Nothing.
Will you please draw me next, Yuu-kun?
Pretty please?

Yuu:
Yea, I guess so.

Yuuko:
What’s wrong, Yuu-kun?

Yuu:
I can’t do it.

Yuuko:
Why not?

Yuu:
It’s a waste of paper.

Yuuko:
That’s really mean. You’re so stingy.

Yuu:
I don’t have much paper left.

Yuuko:
That’s okay then.

Yuu:
That was quick. You changed your mind fast.

Yuuko:
But since you don’t have enough paper to draw me, you have to show me everything else you do.
I want to see every single thing that you draw from now on.

Yuu:
Okay.


Yuuko:
Yuu-kun.

Yuu:
What?

Yuuko:
Yuu-kun, do you want a little sister?
Don’t you want a sister?

Yuu:
Why would… Why are you asking me that?

Yuuko:
I want to know.
Yuu-kun, Yuu-kun?

Yuu:
I don’t want one.
I don’t want a sister. I can’t stand it any more.

Yuuko:
Brother Yuu.

Yuu:
Don’t call me brother.
My sister died. She’s dead.

Yuuko:
Okay then.

Yuu:
Several days later, Yuuko was adopted by relatives and she left the orphanage.
In the end everyone was alone. Whether you’re family or not, everyone is separated in the end.
That’s why I won’t depend on anyone ever again. I won’t meddle in anyone’s life.
That’s how I learned to live without relying on anyone else for anything.

Yuu:
Tell me something. Why do you always hang around me?

Yuuko:
I wonder why.
Senpai. I’m so glad I finally get to see you again.
And do you know why that is?

Yuu:
No idea.

Yuuko:
You’re so dense sometimes.
I can see that you haven’t changed at all.

Yuu:
Are you trying to pick a fight?

Yuuko:
I guess you can’t help it.
I’ll tell you then.
Well, Himura-senpai, you should know that you were my first love.
And you know something else? My first love hasn’t ended yet, Yuu-kun.
I’ll make you forget. I will.
I’ll erase all the painful memories that you have.



Shuuichi:
Metronome marking. 60. Largo.
Normal syncopation.

Normal, nice and gentle.
Kuze-kun, you’re a little bit slow today.
Is your metronome really the heartbeat of a musician?
Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
The spring is coming loose.
Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
The rhythm measures the time remaining.



Mizuki:
Kuze-san?

Shuuichi:
Mizuki, what are you doing up so late at night?

Mizuki:
I just couldn’t get to sleep. I came out to cool off.

Shuuichi:
I see

Mizuki:
Ah, Kuze-san. Your violin!
Have you got it fixed already?

Shuuchi:
Fix it?
Oh yeah. No. It’s still broken.

Mizuki:
Oh, that’s really disappointing. That stinks.

Shuuichi:
I’m sorry, but it’s broken forever.

Mizuki:
I listened to the CD you gave me. It was really good.
I hardly ever listened to classical music.
It was amazing to hear you play.
I think the subdued songs are so beautiful.
And then there are the ones that are knockouts.
Those were so cool, I got goosebumps.

Shuuichi:
Knockouts?

Mizuki:
But well, my biggest shock was now I think that classical music is really sexy.

Shuuichi:
It’s sexy?

Mizuki:
There’re no lyrics, but I felt like someone was whispering in my ear, like they were right beside me and they were saying “I love you.” It made my heart flutter.

Shuuichi:
You know they say that masterpieces are very often inspired by love or heartbreak.

Mizuki:
I was thinking about that. Then I started thinking about you performing your music, just for me.
Kuze-san, this might be a little sudden.

Shuuichi:
What?

Mizuki:
I think that I’ve already started to fall in love with you.
See you tomorrow. Good night.

Shuuichi:
I can’t believe this.
