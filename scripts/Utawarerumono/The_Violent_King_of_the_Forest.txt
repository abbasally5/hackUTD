Tuskuru:
No guesses. It's awful.

Teoro:
I guess we could fix it, but it’ll be quicker to just start over and make a new one.

Masked man:
Why had someone done such a thing?

Villagers:
I don’t know, but how about we discuss that somewhere else.

Really. Mutikapa could jump out at any moment.

Teoro:
So what are you boys backing out on us?

Villagers:
Well, we’d kinda like to.

Yeah. Look what she did all those people in Hita village.

Tuskuru:
Mutikapa sleeps during the daylight hours, so we should be fine.

Masked man:
Nocturnal, that's good.

Teoro:
See? No worries! She's up somewhere getting a beauty rest!

Tuskuru:
Unless you wake her up, with all your rough mouth before [xxx].

Eluluu:
Um, are you sure this isn't going to strain you too much?

Teoro:
She's right, son. You'll just end up aggravating those injuries. You should head back.

Masked man:
I'm feeling much better. And I'd be honored if you'd allow me to assist.

Teoro:
That's a nice notion, but still...

Masked man:
I'll help you any way I can.

Teoro:
Excellent! So you're saying we can count on you?

Masked man:
Yes.

Tuskuru:
(Praying)

Villagers:
Okay.

I just hope it'll be enough to pacify Mutikapa.

Masked man:
What was those words she was speaking just now?

Eluluu:
A [xxx] prayer of thanks to Yahnaun.

Masked man:
Thanks for what?

Eluluu:
Because we rely on the abundance of the forest for food, medicine and so many other important things. We're grateful.

Masked man:
Grateful... Even though you live in constant fear of this vengeful goddess?

Eluluu:
Why would someone have done this?

Teoro:
Hey, careful there, little one. You three should get inside before it gets dark out.

Eluluu:
And make sure you lock the doors and stay quiet.

Sopoku:
Thanks for all your hard work today, Chief.

Tuskuru:
My pleasure. So there were no incidents here?

Sopoku:
No, everything was just fine.

Teoro:
Honey, I'm dying of starvation!

Sopoku:
There's a crisis going on and all you could think of about your lousy crow?!

Tuskuru:
You boys should be going home as well. Your families are probably worried about you.

Villagers:
Right.

Teoro:
All right, kid. You take good care of your girls, okay?
Times like these, it's good to have a strong male presence in the house.
And Aruruu, you'll be sure and do what the kid here says, all right?

Eluluu:
Aruruu!

Aruruu:
No!

Eluluu:
Where are you going? Can you at least try and show some manners?

Aruruu:
No!

Masked man:
Looks like she'll never change her mind.

Sopoku:
I wouldn't be so sure.

Teoro:
Look, she knows [some] we don't!

Tuskuru:
Our efforts must've failed.

Eluluu:
Grandmother...

Tuskuru:
Just be quiet and remain calm, my darlings.

Eluluu:
If you go out there, you'll be killed, too!

Masked man:
I must.

Tuskuru:
So you can foolishly give your life for some nonsense of honor?!
The goddess' invasion is not to be taken lightly!

Masked man:
But I cannot simply stand idle and watch.

Tuskuru:
Instead you will join the lengths of the decease, then leave the helpless behind to be slaughtered?!

Eluluu:
But why is she still angry even after we fixed the shrine?

Tuskuru:
Hmm... When I was about Aruruu's age, my older sister ventured into the forest.
She went there alone to make a sacrifice to the goddess.

Masked man:
Sacrifice?!

Aruruu:
Older... sister?

Tuskuru:
As a priestess, my sister was well revered for her influence and powers.
It's thanks to her that we have been free of incidents until now.
We'll make it through this if we just stick together, my darlings.
Where are you going?

Masked man:
I need to look outside. Silence can be deceptive.

Tuskuru:
That idiot!

Eluluu:
No! Let me help you.

Masked man:
It's too late! Run!

Eluluu:
Just get up!

Masked man:
Get out of here, Eluluu!

Eluluu:
No!

Masked man:
Go ahead. Make your move.
I guess we've been spared, for now.
It's all right. Looks like something scared her away.
I believe we're safe now.
We were lucky this time, but you should have run.

Eluluu:
You boy...

Masked man:
I'm sorry.

Tuskuru:
I see. The entire Kirikuri family...

Villagers:
Even though wife and child... Completely [xxx]...

She was just a baby...

How can we protect our families?

Masked man:
I'd like to show you something.

Teoro:
What is it?

Masked man:
These hairs. They belong to Mutikapa.
Apparently it was the rain that drew her away.
She becomes formidable if her fur gets wet.

Teoro:
Oh what do you know, kid? You did back your life on the line for nothing after all.

Eluluu:
Even so, that was reckless. You really should be more careful.

Tuskuru:
So... What are you thinking? Do you have a plan?

Masked man:
I think so. I just hope I'm right about this.

Teoro:
You think we can go after her?

Masked man:
Yes.

Teoro:
I'm not so sure. Even if we band together, it'll still be pretty dangerous.

Villagers:
He wants us... to kill her?

The goddess...?

Masked man:
Whether she is a goddess or not, there's no reason for all of you to go on living in fear like this.

Villagers:
But what if your plan doesn't work?

Then what...

Yeah...

Masked man:
Only I will be at risk. I'll lure her into the open.

Eluluu:
It's too dangerous to lure her out! Why would you do that?

Masked man:
As an outsider, I'm the most logical candidate.

Eluluu:
That's not logical! It's ridiculous! Why do you insist on putting your life at risk?

Masked man:
There's nobody here who'd grieve for loss if I died.

Eluluu:
How can you say something like that?
We consider you a member of the family.
But you don't even feel the same way about us?

Masked man:
Of course I do.

Eluluu:
I already lost my father. I don't want to lose anyone else.

Masked man:
I'm sorry. I'll be careful. But it's something I must do.

Eluluu:
Okay.

Masked man:
I'll be fine. As long as you're willing to be my family, I promise I'll return without fail.

- - - - - - - - - - -

Masked man:
The best place to lay our trap is right here. On this marsh.

Teoro:
Then we should camouflage areas so she doesn't suspect anything.

Masked man:
And after I've drawn Mutikapa out into the open, cut the rope.

Teoro:
You sure?

Masked man:
Don't worry. I should get to safety in time.

Villagers:
But... you sure we should kill her?

Yeah, we could be cursed.

Masked man:
Would you rather continue to wait until its belly is full?
Spending night after night huddle together in fear?

Villager:
But still...

Teoro:
He does have a point. Nobody wants to see any more kids get eaten up.

Sopoku:
Exactly.

Villagers:
Yeah, I agree.

We have no choice.

Teoro:
All right! Then it's decided! So what's the rest of your plan?

Aruruu:
Mutikapa...

Tuskuru:
It's kind of you to be concerned.
However, we cannot surrender our lives to satisfy her vengeful will.

Villagers:
That should be good.

All right, I got it's set up.

Okay, I'll cut the rope. The rest of you head back.
What are you waiting for? It's too dangerous here.

We're not gonna leave you all alone.

If anything happens, we're safer as a group.

You guys...

Yeah, we can't let the new kid be the only one putting himself in harm's way.

Right.

Masked man:
Well, from here on, I should be fine on my own.

Teoro:
No, I'm going with ya. The men of Yamayura Village will look like cowards when letting an injured guy go alone.

Masked man:
But Teoro...

Teoro:
It feels kinda strange being called by my real name.
Normally, all the villagers call me "Pops".
And now that you become one of us, you might as well call me Pops like the rest of all of you.

Masked man:
You're hardly old enough for that.

Teoro:
It's more 'cause people look up to me, 'cause I'm reliable and trustworthy.
But I shouldn't toot my own horn.
Hey, kid.

Masked man:
Yes?

Teoro:
Why would you wanna put yourself in danger. You do always for us.

Masked man:
The only memories I have are here. This place is all I've got.

Teoro:
So you are already such a respectable member of our village.

Masked man:
I hope I prove worthy in the place.

Teoro:
Come on, kid! It's me, Pops!
It's okay to let your guard down and just thank me for the compliment.
This is it?

Masked man:
I'm going in.

Teoro:
Okay.

Tuskuru:
So it's begun.

Teoro:
[That's like] her sizes falling her down!

Masked man:
But she could still get ground on us!

Teoro:
Okay, where'd she just appear to? Kid, no!

Masked man:
What's this?

Tuskuru:
A charm with protective powers. Keep it with you.

Teoro:
Oh, that thing is tough.

Masked man:
Let's go!

Teoro:
Right.

Villagers:
Hear that? It's her.

She's coming.

All right, come on.

Masked man:
Go ahead!

Villager:
Got her!

Teoro:
Take this!

Villager:
Mutikapa... Oh, no...

Sopoku:
Welcome home, darling.

Tuskuru:
We owe our thanks.

Masked man:
Ma'am. This saved my life.

Tuskuru:
It belongs with you now, my son. Keep it with you.

Eluluu:
Grandmother!

Tuskuru:
What happened?

Eluluu:
I can't find Aruruu anywhere!

Villagers:
Aruruu, where are you?

It looks like she just disappeared.

Yeah, there's no sign of her.

Eluluu:
I'm really starting to worry.

Masked man:
It'll be all right. Now that Mutikapa's gone. I'm sure that she's safe.

Eluluu:
I hope so.

Aruruu:
Umm...

Eluluu:
Aruruu!
Aruruu, stop! Why did you have to go and scare us like that?!
Hey, what are you hiding there?

Aruruu:
A baby.

Eluluu:
What?

Aruruu:
It's Aruruu's baby.

Eluluu:
Huh?! That's impossible!

Tuskuru:
Come on, child. That's really [under there.] Huh?

Eluluu:
Aruruu, show me! You have to let me see! What's in there?

Aruruu:
Aruruu's baby.

Eluluu:
Oh, it's so cute.

Villagers:
It has the same hair. Could it be... the Mutikapa?

[It had an] offspring?

But still, how did Aruruu get?

Tuskuru:
Tell us, what happened, Aruruu? Now don't be afraid.

Aruruu:
Well, I... promised.

Eluluu:
Promised?

Villagers:
Well, it's whole new problem.

It does?

Think about it, now that its mother's dead, there's no way we'll be able to keep it alive.

And if the thing did live, it would attack us.

Teoro:
After all, it is a possibility, right?

Masked man:
I have no part. Anymore killer.
New born life is pure, without guilt.
So let us protect this young one.

Teoro:
Let's do it.

Eluluu:
This burned fire celebration is an honor of Mutikapa.
It isn't much for that all we can do now is offer prayers and wish her well.

Masked man:
You're its mother now. Take it.

Aruruu:
Father... Father...

Masked man:
Do you mean me?

Aruruu:
Father!

Eluluu:
Um, sorry if she made you feel uncomfortable by saying that.

Masked man:
No, I appreciated the compliment. It maybe feel... very happy.

Teoro:
There you go! Move [xxx] up and say thanks for a compliment!

Eluluu:
Teoro! Look at you, you're drunk!

Teoro:
The nights are good, I just celebrate.

Eluluu:
But you celebrate every night, don't you?

Teoro:
It's the new guy of Yamayura!

Eluluu:
Yeah.

Villagers:
I have no idea how you ended up here, but I [xxx] what you did.

If it hadn't been for the new kid, who knows what might have happened all of us.

Masked man:
Tuskuru.

Tuskuru:
It's not right for you to go around without a real name.
From now on, you will be known to us as "Hakuoro".

Hakuoro:
Hakuoro...

Eluluu:
That was... my father's name.
