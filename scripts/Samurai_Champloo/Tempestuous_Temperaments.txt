Man: Vagrant Mugen! Vagrant and ronin Jin! These two will here by be executed by decapitation, and their heads put on display!

Matsunosuke: Are you ready to apologize? Are you ready to grovel at my feet and beg for forgiveness?

Mugen: If living means bowing down to the likes of you bastards, I'd rather die on my feet with my head held high!

Jin: Well said. I agree with him.

Matsunosuke: Very well, then. I'll grant your wish and send you straight to the afterlife.

疾風怒濤
Tempestuous Temperaments



Man: Hey, where are my dumplings? Aren't they ready yet?

Fuu: Yes, sir! Coming right up!

Man: Hey, baby, let's have some fun!

Woman: Oh...

Man: C'mon, don't give me that frown...

Woman: Stop it.

Fuu: Sorry to keep you waiting!

Man: So, what kept you, idiot?

Fuu: Please forgive me...

Man: Where are my dumplings?!

Fuu: Coming!

Tomonoshin: I'm bored to death...

Man: Yeah, me, too.

Tomonoshin: Isn't there anything fun to do around here?

Fuu: Geez, what's with these customers today?

Kikuzo: : Now, now, Fuu, just keep smiling.

Fuu: But they're...

Ogin: Careful, Fuu. That blond boy is the son of the prefectural governor.

Ryujiro: Check it out, brand new!

Man: Hey, nice!

Ryujiro: Some blade, huh? Can't wait to do a test cut. What are you looking at? Hey! Talkin' to you, old man!

Old Man: It's hot!

Man: Hahaha! You got him! Hahaha!

Fuu: You guys are a bunch--


Man: Oh, please, governor! I beg you, sir! If I lose this construction job, it will be the death of my whole family! Please, sir! Please!

Matsunosuke: You dare give me this?

Man: Uh, I, well, I just...

Matsunosuke: Your spare change!?

Matsunosuke: You men! Kill this insolent peasant for me at once.

Man: Don't. You might not like it, but just let it go. Look, see those samurai close to the governor? They're his bodyguards. They're famous fighters from Edo, considered top-notch even among the Yagyu. They're in a different league. Even the governor's samurai wouldn't stand a chance against those guys. Understand?


Fuu: Good afternoon, sir! Huh?

Mugen: Water.

Fuu: Water?

Mugen: Yeah, water.

Fuu: Well, um, we only serve paying customers, so you have to order more than water. If you're broke, go somewhere else. Hmm?

Mugen: 50 dumplings. Is it a deal?

Fuu: Huh?

Mugen: You feed me, and I'll take care of those guys for you.

Fuu: But, um...

Mugen: But what?

Fuu: Maybe for 20.

Mugen: Are you kidding me? I'm not goin' one dumpling lower.

Tomonoshin: Hey, where's my tea?!

Fuu: Yes, sir, it's coming right up!

Tomonoshin: What's with you?

Fuu: Uh, I'm really sorry. It was an accident.

Tomonoshin: I don't wanna hear it. All I wanna know is how you're gonna make it up to me.

Fuu: I, uh...

Tomonoshin: One finger or two. Well, I suppose one ought to be enough.

Man: C'mon, hold still...

Fuu: H-Hey, what're you doing? Cut it out! Let go of me!

Ryujiro: Master, let me take care of this. I wanted to give the blade a test cut anyway, and she'll do just fine.

Fuu: Somebody... Help me...

Ryujiro: Stop struggling, or you'll lose more than just a finger. Well, now, what'll it be? Your nose, maybe? Or how about an ear? Or perhaps your little...


Matsunosuke: Hmph. It isn't much, but the way you're going that's all you need. You know what they say, it's only six mon to cross the River Styx. Mmmmwahahaha.

Man: You bastard...

Jin: Move it, will you? You're blocking the road.

Yagyu Swordsman: Is that so? Who the hell are you?

Yagyu Swordsman: Don't try to interfere.

Jin: To serve your lord and do his bidding... Is that honorable?

Yagyu Swordsman: Hmph. Of course it is.

Jin: Even if that lord is an unimportant piece of shit?

Yagyu Swordsman: Say what?!

Yagyu Swordsman: Hey, you better watch that mouth of yours!

Jin: Cutting down a man who's done nothing wrong... Is that what you spent all those years honing your skills for?

Yagyu Swordsman: Why, I ought to...

Jin: In my opinion, you're worthless.

Yagyu Swordsman: Screw you!

Yagyu Swordsman: Say your prayers!


Fuu: O-O-O-One hundred dumplings!

Mugen: Well, boys. Your lives ain't worth squat, are they?

Ryujiro: Excuse me?

Mugen: Do the math. A hundred dumplings for all you guys? What's that work out to, five dumplings a pop?

Ogin: His math's way off.

Ryujiro: You have guts, you little punk. But if you don't shut that big mouth, you're gonna piss me off. Watch your ass, or I'll try out my new sword on you someday.

Mugen: Why not right now?

Mugen: Forget all that formal crap 'bout coming at me one at a time. I'll take all bitches on!

Man: Oh, yeah?

Man: Get him!


Mugen: C'mon!

Fuu: Oh, crap!

Mugen: C'mon, bring it, boys!

Tomonoshin: Are you some kinda moron? You just don't get it. You just don't get it at all, do you, pal?

Mugen: Huh?

Tomonoshin: My old man's the governor around here. So, folks who mess with me pay for it -- big time. Hell, fact is, they don't live long enough to see the next sunrise. You starting to get it? This isn't the damn Civil War. In this day and age, acting like a loose cannon, going around, swinging a sword is totally passe.

Tomonoshin: Do you understand what I just said?

Mugen: No, not at all.

Tomonoshin: C'mon! Why not?! It's common sense! That's just the way the world is today!

Mugen: I don't give a rat's ass about your "common sense."

Tomonoshin: Huh...?

Mugen: 'Cause I come from Ryukyu, pal.


Matsunosuke: Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Wait just a minute! You want money, is that it?! You can have you as much as you want, okay?! How 'bout it?

Man: You...

Jin: I'll take these.

Matsunosuke: You... bastard! Somebody stop that man! You miserable, good-for-nothing cowards!


Tomonoshin: Listen, my old man... has three Yagyu badasses guarding him around the clock.

Mugen: Mmm?

Tomonoshin: Mmm? Hehehe. What's the matter? You scared? You pee your pants?

Mugen: Hehehe.

Tomonoshin: Ugh, sorry!

Mugen: Hey, gimme your hand.

Tomonoshin: Hmm?

Mugen: Listen up, morons! Here's the deal! You guys ain't worth bothering with! You're gonna leave, and I'm gonna count to ten. You got that long to get those badasses over here. I'll count with his fingers until you get back.

Mugen: This is one... [CRACK]

Tomonoshin: Aaaaaaaaaugh!! Ugh...

Mugen: And two... [CRACK]

Tomonoshin: Aaaaughaaaaaugh!!

Mugen: And three! [CRACK]

Tomonoshin: Aaaaaaughaughaaahah... ugh...

Mugen: And four! How boring. What the hell, let's do 'em all!

Tomonoshin: No, wait... Hold on a minute!

Tomonoshin: Ah... you one of them...? A Yagyu swordsman...?

Jin: You're in the middle of something. Pardon me.

Mugen: Hey. Are you one of those so-called badasses?

Jin: You've got the wrong guy. And don't bother waiting for the Yagyus, they're all gone.

Mugen: They're gone?

Jin: I killed all three.

Mugen: Better yet!


Kikuzo: Uh... Mr. Ryujiro?

Ryujiro: Hehehe... Burn it all... Burn it to the ground!

Mugen: I can't imagine a more perfect setting.

Jin: Aren't you going to run?

Mugen: Nah, but go ahead. Don't stay on my account.



SAMURAI CHAMPLOO - 01



Mugen: W-Waaaagh! Damn, that's cold! Huh?

Mugen: What in the hell... is going on here?

Jin: Don't you remember?

Mugen: I remember a dream. There was a fire all around me.

Jin: It wasn't a dream.

Mugen: Oh, yeah. So you were in a bathtub with your thing hanging out?

Jin: Now, that was a dream.

Matsunosuke: Too bad it wasn't a dream. My son burned to death in that fire. And now you're both going to pay for that. Fortunately, it wasn't long ago this place was called "the torture department store." You're gonna be well taken care of till your execution tomorrow.


Kikuzo: Fuu.

Fuu: Huh?

Kikuzo: I guess this must be awfully tough for you.

Fuu: Nah, it's really no big deal.

Ogin: Well, since you have no family, you'll be welcome to come with us if you like.

Fuu: No, I'll be okay. This thing has forced me to make up my mind.

Kikuzo and Ogin: Huh?


Jin: You're the lowest of the low...

Mugen: What'd you say...?

Jin: Your stance leaves you wide open, and your movements are totally inefficient. All in all, your fighting style is a mess.

Mugen: You son of a...

Jin: I swear, you are the most undisciplined fighter I've ever known...

Mugen: Shut your damn mouth.

Jin: And the only one I wasn't able to kill.

Mugen: Mugen is the name, pal. You got that?

Jin: Mugen.

Mugen: That's right.

Jin: My name is Jin. You should remember it.


Fuu: Please, sir!

Guard: Forget it. The prisoners aren't allowed to have any visitors.

Fuu: Can't you bend the rules? For a minute? Oh, please, sir. Do it for me! Pretty please!

Guard: No way!

Fuu: I'm begging you! I'll do anything!

Guard: Anything?

Fuu: Uh...

Guard: You mean, you...

Fuu: I, uh...

Guard: You know, have se--

Fuu: Anything but that.

Guard: What is this?! You said anything, you lying little bitch!

Fuu: Not with you, baldy! No way!

Guard: I'm not bald! This is a hairstyle!

Fuu: Hey, cut it out!

Fuu: Hey, take this! Thanks for the help, Momo!


Fuu: Oh, wow... From the looks of things, they really put you two through the wringer.

Mugen: You're that chick...

Jin: The one from the teahouse.

Fuu: Well, don't you want to know why I'm here?

Mugen: No.

Fuu: Okay, see ya.

Mugen: Wait, I was just kidding.

Fuu: Listen, if you promise you'll do me just one little favor, I'll help you escape. Do we have a deal?

Mugen: You serious?


Man: And?

Guard: She said she was going to visit the prisoners...

Man: Find her!

Man: Yes, sir!


Fuu: It's not working...

Mugen: So, what's the deal with this favor of yours?

Fuu: There's someone I want you to find -- a samurai who smells of sunflowers.

Mugen: Sunflowers?

Man: Find her! Look over there!

Jin: Hurry up!

Fuu: Oops!

Mugen: What is it?

Fuu: The key broke in half...

Man: She's over there!

Fuu: Uh-oh! Gotta go!

Man: Hold it!

Mugen: Stupid chick. What the hell'd she even come here for anyway?


Man: What's it say?

Man: A public execution?

Man: It says, at sunset today...

Fuu: What am I gonna do?


Merchant: Forget about it! I can't sell this stuff to an amateur like you!

Merchant: I must be the biggest sucker in Edo! Take 'em, you little thief!

Fuu: Really?! Oh, thank you! Thank you so much!


Fuu: Gotta borrow this for a minute!

Man: Hey!


Jin: You at peace with yourself?

Mugen: Hell, every freakin' day I have to ask myself -- will this day be the last day I lie in sun?

Man: Vagrant Mugen! Vagrant and ronin Jin! These two will here by be executed by decapitation, and their heads put on display!

Matsunosuke: Are you ready to apologize? Are you ready to grovel at my feet and beg for forgiveness?

Mugen: If living means bowing down to the likes of you bastards, I'd rather die on my feet with my head held high!

Jin: Well said. I agree with him.

Matsunosuke: Very well, then. I'll grant your wish and send you straight to the afterlife.

Matsunosuke: What the...?

Mugen: Yo. We put our fight on hold until we get outta here. Agreed?

Jin: You intend to kill them all, don't you? I swear, you really are the lowest of the low...

Matsunosuke: You fools! Don't even think about making it out of here alive!

Fuu: Oh! I need a light! Anyone got a light?

Man: Hey, you! Here, take this!

Man: Come back here!

Man: Up there! Hey, don't let him get away!

Man: Hold it! Stay right there...

Matsunosuke: What are you waiting for?! Kill them! Kill them both!

Matsunosuke: Now, w-wait a minute! I-Is it money you're after? I'll... I'll give you as much as you want!

Jin: May the saints forgive you... because I won't!

Mugen: Damn, these cockroaches keep coming. So annoying...

Jin: Hey, look.

Mugen: Hmm? Is that the...?


Mugen: Okay... it's your turn now, pal.

Jin: All right.

Fuu: Just hold on, you two! You guys made me a promise, remember? You haven't forgotten, have you?

Jin: No, I haven't, but this comes first.

Mugen: Yeah, first on my list, too.

Fuu: Now, wait a minute! A promise is a promise! And if you two end up killing each other, there won't be anyone left to help me! What good is your promise, then? All right. We'll decide this by tossing this coin. If it's heads, you'll fight each other. But if it comes up tails, you forget about the fight and you both come with me. Are we clear on this?

Mugen: Gimme that.

Fuu: Think you might've tossed it a little too far?

Jin: He doesn't know the meaning of restraint.

Mugen: Kiss my ass.

Fuu: Where is it? It should've landed by now, but I don't see it.

Pursuers: There they are! Don't let them escape! Go get 'em! After them!

Mugen: Shit.

Fuu: Hey, look! I won!
