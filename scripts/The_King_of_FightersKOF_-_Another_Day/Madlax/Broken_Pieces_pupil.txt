Lady Quanzitta:
A fork in the path of the destiny mankind has woven together. The point where the era changes; the door of the truth.
Many have come this place and found the unexpected. They tried to open the door of the era; yet they failed as it is buried within the truth.

Some of them desire suffering; some of them are blinded by doubt; and yet the others seek only divine peace. I'm the one known as Quanzitta Marison. I am the onlooker watching the eras. Only in existence. Whose task is to witness and hand down the story of time.

Laetitia:
She's finally seen the truth.

Lady Quanzitta:
The era is changing.

Laetitia:
It's coming.

Lady Quanzitta:
Even if absolute devastation awaits.

Laetitia:
That's correct. And even if my own existence suddenly disappears.


Madlax:
Twelve years ago, our father heard you chant mystique words from those books.

Friday:
Yes. He awakened to the true within him.

Madlax:
As the result of hearing your words, he lost control and tried to murder his own daughter.

Friday:
That's the Essence he kept buried inside his soul. I merely gave him the means by which to release his urges.

Madlax:
Margaret was desperate and picked up a gun to defend herself. Then... well, then it happened.

Margaret:
I...I didn't... I didn't want to.

Madlax:
I know. I know that you didn't want to kill him. But you didn't wanna die either. Even if it meant killing your own father.

Margaret:
I just wanted to stay alive.

Madlax:
I am a crime that Margaret Burton committed.

Margaret:
That's all I ever wanted.

Madlax:
I am Margaret Burton’s urges.

Margaret:
The missing part of me?

Madlax:
I am nothing more than a shard of Margaret Burton’s broken heart.

Margaret:
Shard of my heart, broken free.

Laetitia:
I'm the innocence lost in that painful that you split into two. I remained here waiting for you acknowledgment. I'm the one called Laetitia. The tie of truth that binds the two of you together. Margaret Burton, are you finally willing to accept your truth?

Margaret:
Laetitia...

Friday:
Congratulations, my dear Margaret. The two facets that you were being discarded twelve years ago have returned once again. It's time for you all to become one. Once you become whole, you'll be closer to the Essence.

Madlax:
This is none of your business.

Acts like this weigh heavily on my conscience. Such acts can not be forgiven. I am a killer.

Margaret:
I'm so sorry.

Madlax:
Margaret, please decide. Will you accept me as part of you, or will you choose to live without me? Laetitia and I need to know.

Margaret:
But... What's going to happen if we go back to being one again?

Laetitia:
You will be complete and you will be able to open the Door of the Era.

Margaret:
The “Door of the Era”?

Laetitia:
Once you open the door, whatever you desire will come to pass.

Margaret:
Desire?

Madlax:
Margaret, make a decision.

Margaret:
But this is... It's all so sudden.

Laetitia:
Please decide.

Margaret:
I don't want to. It scares me. I mean, if we do reunite, I'll go back to being a person who killed father. I don't know what kind of person I will become.

Laetitia:
Please Margaret, help me. Because of your indecision and fear, I have been imprisoned in this place. I have been trapped here for twelve years. Now even Poupée is gone. Please, I don't wanna be alone anymore.
Madlax:
Choose what you will. If you're afraid, then go ahead and shoot. Erase that memory. You don't have to accept your truth.
Margaret:
But why?
Madlax:
For your existence, Vanessa asked me to protect you, and I will do that. For both, Vanessa and Elenore.

Vanessa:
Margaret.

Elenore:
Miss.

Madlax:
You don't have to face the truth, Margaret. It's okay. Just let it go.

Margaret:
But if, if I do that then you'll disappear. If I do it you'll be gone.

Madlax:
Don't worry. I have people who care about me and they won't forget. You see, as long as my memory survives, so will I.

Limelda:
It will, Madlax.
Madlax:
I will exist within her. She will never forget me. It's okay. I don't mind disappearing.

Margaret:
I'm so confused.

Please Madlax, become one with me.

Madlax:
Margaret....

Margaret:
Because you are an important part of me.

Madlax:
If we do become whole again, you will have sin in your conscience. You'll have to live with it for the rest of your life.

Margaret:
I'm tired of running. Because of my running, I lost Vanessa, and I lost poor Elenore. Madlax I need to face the truth.

Madlax:
You know that I am a killer.

Margaret:
You are more than that, Madlax.

Madlax:
And realize my existence carries twelve years of pain.

Margaret:
I don't want you to have to bear that sorrow by yourself anymore. Without pain, my life has been incomplete. Please make me whole again.
Laetitia, I apologize for leaving you. I'm sorry that you've been trapped in this place all because of me. Will you become one with me?

Laetitia:
If that's what you truly desire then I have no reason to refuse.

Margaret:
I thank you.

Lady Quanzitta:
It is done. The Door of the Era will now be opened.

Friday:
Wonderful! Magnificence! You are finally awakened, Margaret Burton. How does it feel to have your Essence return to you.
Margaret:
What are you talking about?
Friday:
Twelve years, you lived without it. But now you become whole and finally realized your truth.

Margaret:
I knew, I knew the truth all along. I knew he, that father tried to kill me the day. He tried. So I, I had to pull the trigger.

Friday:
My dear Margaret, you have done nothing wrong. You acted with you instinct when the Essence within you surfaced. The distorted world affected your father's reason. That's all. It's not your fault that most people are unaware of this power.

Margaret:
I didn't do anything wrong?
Friday:
That's right, my dear. You just did what your instinct told you to do. You who touched pure essence of humanity, you alone have the power to enlighten the bewildered people of this world.

Margaret:
So, none of them know about it?
Friday:
It's not that they don't know about it. It's that they refuse to realize it.

Margaret:
Then I should help the people realize it. Don't you think so, Laetitia?

Friday:
That's right. Exactly. Yes, everyone deserves to touch the Essence. Now tell me, Margaret Burton. Did you take your father's life twelve years ago?

Margaret:
I did. I killed my father. I did it because I wanted to stay alive. Is that okay? Anybody would've done the same thing, right? And some people wouldn't even have to use [like this]. There are people in this world who have the ability to kill using nothing but words.
Friday:
Enlighten the poor world with wealth of your experience, my dear Margaret.
Margaret:
Yes, I will. I will share what I've learned.

I've learned the world is warped. Just like the morals of its people. We don't need to feel bad for acting on instinct. Yes. I'll share what I've learned. I'll tell Madlax.



Friday:
So you've chosen to point the gun with me. Is that what your Essence truly desire?

Margaret:
Yes. This is the Essence of Margaret Burton.

Friday:
How can you be sure your Essence desires to kill me. Isn't it possible you simply despise humanity itself, my dear? Either way, you are incredibly close to touching the Essence. This is exactly what I hoped you to become.

Margaret:
You're a stupid person.
Friday:
What's that?

Margaret:
We all know this world is warped. And every living being has malice inside of them. And we all are completely aware that's there. But it has nothing to do with the Essence. They already know. You don't have to tell them. However there's one person who never understood that fact. And I will tell her. I will tell Madlax not to have any regrets. I want to let her know that she doesn't have to be so kind. There is one way I can help her overcome her sorrow; If I search within myself, I can use the malice inside of me for the strength to kill you. Then I'll have a crime in my conscience as well.

Friday:
A crime? What's criminal about it? The very word “crime” is nothing but an illusion, was fabricated by human morality. Don't be led astray by these fraudulent morals. You are exceptional just as you are.

Margaret:
My mother and my father, Vanessa, and Elenore.... The people I loved are dead because of you. I don't wanna listen to your lies anymore. I despise you. So I'm going to kill you. Now it would be my crime.

Friday:
Margaret! What happened to you. You were ideal but you've lost sight of Essence. How dare you lose your vision just because of antiquated conscience and insincere kindness. You only need to look to the Essence, my dear.
Margaret:
I am looking at it.

Friday:
You bitch!
Margaret.
One thing I couldn't do twelve years ago. The act I ran away from. I'm not afraid anymore. I no longer afraid this is the malice in my heart. And with her kindness I'm now able to kill you.

Friday:
Margaret!

Margaret:
I'm a bad little girl, Friday Monday.

Friday:
Why? She was so close to my ideal. Why did she do this? When they became one, Madlax must have changed her. What? How? You're no longer supposed to exist. Tell me, why are you here!
Madlax:
You don't remember, Friday? I told you I was going to kill you.

Friday:
Impossible! You shoulda already assimilated into Margaret Burton.

Madlax:
That's true. But you can't deny I'm here right now.

Friday:
This cannot be.
Madlax:
All your desire for the human essence has rendered nothing. All that matters is what I must do now; end your existence.

Friday:
Madlax, you cannot stop me! You won't get in my way again.
Madlax:
Such cruelty, not quite my style. But otherwise we seem to have a lot in common, don't we, Friday? Don't you think? I am here to protect Margaret Burton, because I love her.

Friday:
The one who cut you out and threw you away.

Madlax:
I'm the kind killer, Madlax. I'm the sorrow of the moment when we touched the truth.
Friday:
What? Is this the Essence? Is this what I sought all these years. The truth is a vicious lie.
Madlax:
It's not. It's just reality.

Friday:
Everything I sought for twelve long years, everything... This world's collapsing. It's false morals and fake sympathies. Why can't they see it? Why don't the people of this world want to learn the truth? When it's, it's right here, in front of you...

Lady Quanzitta:
Friday Monday. I have witnessed such audacity for generations. I've heard the tales of existences like yours from my predecessors. Existences that disappear into history. Soon a new era would be here. And the Door of the Era shall be opened by the girl who stopped you from achieving your goal.
Please allow me to watch over you a little longer. Please Margaret Burton.
Margaret:
This is the Door of the Era. What do I want? What's my desire?
Vanessa:
Hello, Margaret. I just thought I'd stop by. I guess you're going have to feed me dinner again.

Elenore:
Miss Margaret. I'm afraid the two of us will have less to eat now.

Carrossea:
Well, Miss Margaret Burton. This flowers are very beautiful, don't you think?
Margaret:
What I desire from the era, the one thing I want most of all. That's easy. I already know...
Madlax, are you okay?

Madlax:
Margaret Burton.... But why?

Margaret:
When we became one, I understood. You never enjoyed killing, but there were no other options. You had no choice but protect yourself from the malevolence of this world. When you killed, you were stricken with sorrow. Every time you suffered more, you pain [on your] kindness. You're a kind killer.

There is no need for us to become one anymore. The time you spent living as Madlax; that was your truth and it wouldn’t be fair of me to take it away. Not after everything the two of us have been through together, I don't mind facing my truth. Knowing my crime and feeling that painful memory. I finally know and I've learned from it. I know that this world is warped and distorted. And I know I have both good and evil inside of me. You see, I really wanna take a chance on living like everyone else.

Madlax:
So then, you remember?

Margaret:
Hum.

Madlax:
It hurts, doesn't it?

Margaret:
Oh, Madlax, thank you for everything.

You wanna come with me?

Laetitia:
Come with you?

Margaret:
I always wanted a little sister.

Laetitia:
Really? Do you mean it?

Margaret:
I would like you more than anything.

Laetitia:
Sure.

Nakhl:
Lady Quanzitta...

Limelda:
I'm going to be keeping an eye on you.

Madlax:
You stupid.
Limelda:
Huh?

Madlax:
I said you're stupid.

Limelda:
So what are we supposed to do from now on?

Madlax:
Well, I'm not too sure. But I do know one thing.

Limelda:
And what is that?

Madlax:
I know that I'd like to eat some pasta soon. Yeah, pasta.

Margaret:
Let's go eat.

SSS:
Madlax, I'll get straight to the point. I've got a lucrative job for you.

Madlax:
It's been ages since we last spoke an' you wanna get straight to the business?

SSS:
Madlax, it's always business. I didn’t think we had that kind of connection.

Madlax:
Yes, we do. You know, because deep down, there's a part of me inside you. And well, there always has been.
