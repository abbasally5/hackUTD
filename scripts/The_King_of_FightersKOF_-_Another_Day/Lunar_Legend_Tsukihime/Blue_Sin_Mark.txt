  Kohaku & Hisui:
Have a good day.

Shiki:
I didn't think you'd be interested in going to the amusement park.

Akiha:
I hate noisy places.

Shiki:
Well then, why?

Akiha:
If I take my eyes off of you for a minute, I never know what you are going to do. That's why I'm going.

Shiki:
I think the light's turning green.

Akiha:
Welcome home, brother.

Shiki:
Ah.

Akiha:
I'm very disappointed in you, Shiki. I never thought that you'd go out at night and then lie about it. You sweet-talked Hisui, didn't you?

Shiki:
Don't blame her. It wasn't her fault.

Akiha:


Shiki:
It's a very complicated situation.

Akiha:
It must be. To make you forget your conscious.

Shiki:
I'm sorry.

Akiha:


Shiki:
What! Why? Why would you wanna do something like that?

Akiha:
Because I'm worried. I'm worried that something bad might happen to you. Is that reason enough for you or would you like more?


Satsuki:
He's late.

Ciel:
Yeah, I know.

Arihiko:
I just hope that he hasn't forgotten.

Ciel:
Oh, there he is now.

Arihiko:
Hey! You're late! What the heck you took so long anyway? Oh?

Satsuki:
Huh?

Akiha:
I'm sorry we're late. It was my fault.

Arihiko:
Er... No problem! Don't worry about it! So who is the gorgeous babe?

Shiki:
This is my sister, Akiha.

Arihiko:
Oh! So you're Akiha. You dog! You never told us you [had] such a beautiful sister.

Akiha:
That's nice. But, just who are you?

Arihiko:
Oh, sorry. Arihiko Inui.

Akiha:
Inui, huh? So are you the man who called the other day?

Arihiko:
Yeah, yeah, that was me all right!

Akiha:
I'm pleased to meet you. Thank you very much for taking care of my brother that day.

Arihiko:
No, no, this guy right here is the one who's been taking care of me. Isn't that right, little buddy?

Akiha:
And they are?

Shiki:
Ah, well, this is one of my classmates, Yumitsuka.

Satsuki:
Good morning.

Akiha:
Hello, how are you?

Shiki:
And this is Ciel.

Satsuki:
Ah...

Ciel:
What's wrong?

Shiki:
Akiha, what is it?

Akiha:
This woman and I will never get along. I'm certain of it.

Shiki:
That's rude, Akiha!

Akiha:
I can't help it. It's the way I feel. She and I are definitely incompatible. And that's all there is to it.

Shiki:
But Akiha...

Akiha:
And you feel the same, right?

Ciel:
Oh, I don't see there's a big problem. But that's because I know how to control my feelings.

Shiki & Arihiko:
Ah...

Satsuki:
Ah, Sempai, Ah.

Ciel:
I'm a little surprised, Tohno. I didn't think someone like you would have a sister like Akiha.

Shiki:
I don't know. I guess I thought I told you before.

Ciel:
Yeah. I think you may have mentioned it. It's just, the two of you don't look anything alike.

Akiha:
I must admit I'm surprised, too. I never would have imagined that you would make friends with someone like her.

Shiki:
Geez! What do you expect? We do go to the same school, after all.

Akiha:
Even so, it's not natural for a man like you to have anything to do with a woman like Ciel.

Arihiko:
Oh, man, that is harsh.

Shiki:
All right, that's enough, Akiha.

Ciel:
Don't worry about it. She is not capable of controlling herself like I am.

Satsuki:
haah...(sigh)

Shiki:
Why are you acting this way? You're being incredibly rude.

Akiha:
I'm aware of that. But it's instinctive. There is not a thing I can do about it.I can't control the way I feel.

Arihiko:
I bet I know what's going on. You're probably just shy around strangers, aren't you?

Akiha:
I don't think that's it.

Arihiko:
Well, maybe you just think that you can't get along with her. Give it some time.Who knows? You might open up.

Akiha:
I'm afraid that when it comes to her, that's impossible.

Arihiko:
You're a stubborn one, aren't you, Akiha?

Shiki:
If she were here, it would have been even worse.

Arcueid:
Hey, Shiki.

Shiki:
Yeah?

Arcueid:
Why don't we go out on a date? I'd like to experience dating.

Shiki:
I can't tomorrow. Sorry, but I've already got plans.

Arcueid:
Ah... hun...

Shiki:
Ah...?

Arcueid:
Yahoo! Where have you been, Shiki? You're late.

Shiki:
What, but how did you...

Arihiko:
Oh, yeah, that's right. I forgot to tell you. She stopped by my house last night.

Shiki:
Huh?

Arihiko:
You don't mind her joining us, do you?

Shiki:
Arcueid.

Akiha:
Excuse me, but who is she?

Shiki:
Oh, well, ah,...

Arcueid:
You must be a sister. It's so nice to meet you. I'm Arcueid.

Akiha:
And what exactly is your relationship to my brother?

Shiki:
What do you mean relationship?

Arcueid:
You don't need to hide it. I just borrow Shiki from time to time.

Akiha:
Then I should thank you for taking care of him.

Arcueid:
You're very welcome. Right, Shiki?

Akiha:
Oh, brother.

Shiki:
Huh?

Akiha:
I think you and I had better have a long talk later.

Arihiko:
All right, then. Enough of this standing around and talking. Why don't we all go inside?

Ciel:
What did you come here for?

Arcueid:
I came to have fun.

Ciel:
I thought I made it clear when I warned you before. But you don't seem to be getting the message.

Arcueid:
I don't take orders from you. That much is clear.

Arihiko:
What should we ride?

Arcueid:
How about that one?

Ciel:
The one over there looks like it would be more fun.

Arcueid:
Don't quibble.

Ciel:
Then don't accuse me of things I haven't done.

Arihiko:
Well, why don't we ride both of them.

Ciel:
Good idea.

Arihiko:
All right. It's settled, then.

Shiki:
It's a screamer.

Arihiko:
You're big idiot! We finally got things settled. Don't get them started again.

Shiki:
Yeah, right.

Boy:
Oh, that was awsome. I love riding screamers.

Girl:
Me too.

Boy:
Can you believe how fast it was?

Akiha:
Are you all right, my brother?

Shiki:
Yeah, I'm feeling much better now.

Akiha:
That's good.

Arihiko:
Was that a little too much excitement for ya? You gotta train your body for that stuff.

Shiki:
Yeah, you're right.

Satsuki:
Maybe you should just take it easy for a little while longer.

Shiki:
No, really, you guys. I think I'm all right now.

Arcueid:
Good. Then let's go on that one.




Arcueid:
Good. Then let's go on that one.

Arcueid:
Looks like it's a two-seater.

Arihiko:


All:
Scissors!

Ciel:
We're not very lucky, are we?

Arcueid:
You're right for once.

Satsuki:
You had a [big luck].

Arihiko:
Sorry about that.

Ciel:
But on the other hand, this might be a good opportunity for us to talk.

Arcueid:
That's true.

Ciel:
So what do you think about her?

Arcueid:
She is not what you call normal, is she?

Ciel:
You're right there.

Arcueid:
An insensitive woman like you picked up on that?

Ciel:
Insensitive? Was that really necessary?

Arcueid:
I just state the facts as I see them.

Ciel:
Why do you feel like you always have to talk that way? It's not very attractive, you know.

Arcueid:
The same goes for you.

Akiha:
I'm a little surprised.

Shiki:
Huh?

Akiha:
I'm talking about your taste in women.

Shiki:
What do you mean?

Akiha:
They are all the complete opposite of me. I suppose you wanted to get away from your nagging sister and take a break.

Shiki:
No, it's not like that at all.

Akiha:
Then why?

Shiki:
I told you. It's not something that I can talk about. But you have to believe me it's not because I hate you.

Akiha:
You really mean that?

Shiki:
Of course I do.

Akiha:
Then, do you think you could grant me one selfish request?

Shiki:
Sure.

Akiha:
Promise me that you won't see her ever again.

Shiki:
Uh.

Arihiko:
Are you ok with all this, Yumitsuka?

Satsuki:
Huh?

Arihiko:
'Cause you like Tohno, too. Don't you?

Satsuki:
I don't know. He has a girlfriend.

Arihiko:
Wish I can help you out. The guy has no idea what's going on. But if you don't speak up, he is never gonna notice you.

Satsuki:
Hmm.

Girl:
That was so scary.

Arihiko:
Wow! His box lunches look incredible. They're amazing, aren't they? Oh man, look at all this. I don't know where to start.

Satsuki:
It's delicious.

Arihiko:
Incredible!

Ciel:
It really is.

Arihiko:
I can't believe how lucky you are. You eat food like this every day, don't you?

Shiki:
Our maid does all our cooking for us.

Arihiko:
Huh?

Akiha:
I get the feeling my brother doesn't appreciate it the way you do.

Shiki:
What?

Arihiko:
Then he has gotta be nuts. Everything here is amazing.

Shiki:
I never said I didn't like it.

Akiha:
Oh, is that right. I thought I heard you say you like being normal. You hate living at home, don't you? Why not just admit it.

Arihiko:
No kid. Is that right, Tohno? Hey, if you don't mind, I'll take your place anytime. What do you say, Akiha?

Akiha:
No, thank you.

Shiki:
Listen, Akiha.

Arcueid:
Hey, Shiki. What are we going to ride next?

Akiha:
That is incredibly rude! Can't you see that my brother is tired?

Arcueid:
You feel all right, don't you, Shiki.

Shiki:
Ah, yeah.

Akiha:
I don't want you to follow my brother around anymore.

Arcueid:
What do you mean, follow him around?

Akiha:
Exactly what I said.

Ciel:
She's right. And I'm willing to bet Tohno is in trouble, isn't he?

Arcueid:
What are you saying? He is not in trouble.

Ciel:
So now I suppose you think you know everything about him.

Arcueid:
That's not it! And you know it!

(Arihiko:)
(Wow, these vegetables look great. I wonder how they are.)

Ciel:
You need to start cancel self-centered and think about someone else once in a while.

(Arihiko:)
(Wow, they are really good. You should try these seasoning... )

Akiha:
Would you please be quiet! My brother doesn't feel well. Why can't you see that?!

Shiki:
Really I'm all right now. You don't need to worry.

Akiha:
You're not all right. In the first place, when you're near these two, they're causing you to be this way!

(Arihiko:)
(Hey, how about these sandwiches, huh? I think I smell a little...)

Arcueid:
You make a lot of noise. You know that?

Akiha:
What?

Shiki:
Hmm...

Akiha:
Brother?

Arcueid:
Shiki?

Arihiko:
What's wrong? Does your stomach hurt?

Shiki:
No, it's not that.

Arihiko:
Well, what is it, then.

Akiha:
I told you all before. It's obvious that my brother is tired!

Arcueid:
For maybe it's all the noise you're making.

Ciel:
She is right.

Akiha:
What do you mean?

Arcueid:
She means you are responsible, too.

Satsuki:
Enough is enough! The way you're acting! It is no wonder he is dizzy!

Ciel:
Yumitsuka is right. We all came here to have fun, not to argue.

Arihiko:
Of course she is right! So now that we finally got that settled. Why don't we all go hit the hot spring?

Arcueid:
The hot spring?

Arihiko:
Yeah, that's the ticket! Let's all get naked and have some fun!

Akiha:
Thanks for asking, but no.

Shiki:
It's all right, Akiha.

Arcueid:
In that case, you probably don't want to go, either.

Arihiko:
I've had enough. I can't take it.

Shiki:
I know. What is it? I don't see why the girls can't just get along.

Arihiko:
What do you think? It's because of you.

Shiki:
Ah...? What?

Arihiko:
I guess I shouldn't be surprised you don't see it. Your insensitivity acts as a self-defence mechanism.

Shiki:
Self-defence mechanism.

Arihiko:
Hey, sorry. I wasn't tryna stir up bad memories.

Shiki:
Don't worry. Maybe you are right.

Shiki:
I'm sorry.

Arihiko:
It's all right. I'm used to it.

Arcueid:
I've never been in a hot spring before.

Satsuki:
Really?

Arcueid:
It feels good, doesn't it?

Satsuki:


Arcueid:


Satsuki:
He doesn't think of me as anything special. We're just good friends. That's all.

Arcueid:
Are you sure? You may not realize this, but you're very important to Shiki.

Satsuki:
Tohno's always been kind to everyone. I really don't think I'm anything special to him. I have to admit that I'm a little jealous of you, Miss Arcueid.

Arcueid:
What?

Satsuki:
You are his girlfriend, aren't you?

Arcueid:
I don't think I am.

Satsuki:
Huh?

Arcueid:
I really don't think that's what Shiki has in mind. He doesn't think of me that way.

Satsuki:
But Miss Arcueid, you're so beautiful, and sophisticated.

Arcueid:
Those things don't seem to matter.

Satsuki:
What?

Arcueid:
Maybe... Maybe if I were human.

Satsuki:
Miss Arcueid, you're very funny. Did you know that?

Arcueid:
Really?

Satsuki:
Yes.

Ciel:
Do you mind if I talk to you about something?

Akiha:
As long as you make it short.

Ciel:
I heard that Tohno had some kind of accident eight years ago.

Akiha:
Yes.

Ciel:
He doesn't seem to have any memory of what happened to him.

Akiha:
The shock of the accident caused him to black things out.

Ciel:
Is that true?

Akiha:
What do you mean?

Ciel:
It's worked out rather conveniently for you, hasn't it?

Akiha:
I don't know what you're talking about. Get to the point.

Ciel:
Your family seems to be hiding some kind of secret.

Akiha:
You're wrong. We don't have any secrets.

Ciel:
Is that so? Still, something bothers me.

Akiha:
And just what would that be?!

Ciel:
I detect an odor on you that's something other than human.

Akiha:
How dare you...! This conversation is over. I have nothing more to say. Please tell my brother that I've gone home early.

Staff:
Watch your step getting out.
Whaaaaaa

Arihiko:
That was great, wasn't it?

Ciel:
Yeah, it was.

Satsuki:
But I have to admit I'm a little tired.

Arihiko:
Oh, by the way, does anyone know why Akiha went home?

Shiki:
You were with her, Ciel. Did she say anything about it?

Ciel:
No, she didn't say why she was leaving. She just asked me to tell you that she would see you at home later.

Arihiko:
I wonder where they're going in such a hurry.





Arcueid:


Shiki:
Tell me. This family has some secret, doesn't it?
