  Shiki:

Arcueid:
A decision?
Shiki:
I have to do this because I took his place.
Arcueid:
I See.
Shiki:
Ah?
Ciel:
Do you have a death wish or something?
Shiki:
Ciel.
Ciel:

Shiki:

Ciel:

Shiki:
Yeah.
Ciel:
Then why?
Shiki:

Ciel:

Shiki:
What does that mean?
Ciel:
It means she doesn't stand a chance against him now.
Arcueid:
Ah!
Ciel:
No matter how hard they try any person who Roa possesses is unable to suppress the growing hatred within them.
Roa:
Hun.

Ciel:
I know because I tried.
Shiki:
Ah, sempai.
Ciel:
It's best if we spread up from here on. It's not a good idea to fight Roa head on. He is very cunning.
Shiki:
I understand.
Ciel:
I wish you the best of luck.
Shiki:
You too.
Shiki:

Roa:
Have you gone completely mad, princess of true ancestors?
How dare you show pity for a mere human?

Shiki:
Don't do anything foolish, Arcueid.
Roa:
What in ugly sight. What happened to my beautiful proud princess?
Where did she go?

Arcueid:
No matter what, I won't let you kill Shiki.
Roa:
Uh...

Shiki:
Stop right there. You don't want her. Your target is really me, isn't it?
Roa:
Hmm... No need to rush. Besides, I'm not your enemy.

Shiki:
Arcueid, what's wrong?
Roa:
Why are you so surprised? Come on, Arcueid. You should know better than anyone that the body doesn't mean anything to me.
Hun.

Arcueid:
Uh!
Shiki:
Please! No! Arcueid!
Roa:
Enjoy your final farewell together. Go on!
I will allow you just enough time to take care of that.

Shiki:

Arcueid:
Shiki, you finally saw the ugly side of me. Are you all right?
Shiki:

Roa:
Hahahahahaha.

Shiki:
Why are you waiting? Why don't you just get it over with?
Arcueid:
I guess I don't like imaginary things after all.
Shiki:

Roa:
Huhuhuhuhuhuhu.
What a disappointing ending.

Shiki:
You'll pay for this.
Roa:
I'm afraid it's your turn now.



Roa:
Hun!

Shiki:
So you can see them after all.
Roa:
Yes, ever since that day.

Akiha:
My brother.
Roa:
Everything I ever had, you took away from me.
Now it's my turn to take back what's rightfully mine.
That day you had failed to die.
When I look at you, I see someone who should have died eight years ago.
That's what your vision tells you? Is that all?

Shiki:
I've known now. There is a difference in what you and I can see.
Roa:
Where are you hiding?
Shiki.

Shiki:

Ciel:

Shiki:
That doesn't really make sense.
Ciel:
Things don't always have to make sense.
Shiki:
Ah...
Ciel:

Shiki:
Akiha? Are you all right?
Akiha:
I'm fine.
Shiki:
I see.
Akiha:
What about yourself?
Shiki:
It's OK. Everything is over now.
Akiha:

Aoko:
Shiki? Were you able to protect what was important to you?
Shiki:
I don't know.
Aoko:
I see.
Shiki:
Hey.
Aoko:
Yes?
Shiki:
I haven't asked you your name, have I?
Aoko:
My name?
Shiki:
Don't you think it's kind of strange for me to call you Miss Wizard?
Aoko:
Aoko. It's Aoko Aozaki.
Shiki:
You're like a teacher to me.
Aoko:
You think so?
Shiki:

Aoko:
You can't come here anymore.
Shiki:

Hisui:
Welcome back home.
Shiki:
Thanks.
Kohaku:
I'm glad you return Mr. Shiki.
Shiki:
Me too.
Kohaku:
What kind of breakfast would you like this morning?
Shiki:
I'll have Japanese.
Kohaku:
Right away, sir.
Akiha:
I didn't think.
Shiki:
Hm?
Akiha:
I never expected that you come back to the house ever again.
Shiki:
What are you tryna do, kick out your older brother?
Akiha:
Look. Fall's almost over.
Shiki:
Well, what do you know?
Hisui:
Have a good day at school, Master Shiki.
Kiyono:
Good afternoon welcome to TVS news xxx...

Shiki:
Hey.
Arihiko & Satsuki:
Huh?
Shiki:
What happened to Ciel sempai?
Satsuki:
Who's Ciel sempai?
Arihiko:
Yeah, who the heck is that?
Satsuki:
Does she go to school here with us?
Arihiko:
I don't think I'd forget someone with a name like that.
Satsuki:
Tohno?
Shiki:
Hmm?
Arihiko:

Satsuki:
Arihiko.
Arihiko:
Finally told him, didn't you?
Satsuki:
Uh!
Arihiko:
It's a nice day, huh?
Shiki:
Arihiko.
Arcueid:
Aren't you going to go home? Or is there someone that you're waiting for?
Shiki:
I'm here because I made a promise.
Arcueid:
I'm sorry. I couldn't keep the promise I made you.
Shiki:
I couldn't either. I wasn't able to protect you.
Arcueid:
So it's about time you forget about me.
Shiki:
What are you saying?
Arcueid:
You see? The fact is you really did keep your promise to me.
Shiki:
No. It's not fair. All I wanted was for you to...
Arcueid:
I'm sorry, Shiki. Bye-bye, Shiki.
Shiki:
No! Please wait! Arcueid!
Shiki:

Arcueid:
It's a promise.
