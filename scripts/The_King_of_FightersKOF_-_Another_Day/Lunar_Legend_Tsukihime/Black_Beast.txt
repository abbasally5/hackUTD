  Arcueid:
I found you.

Arcueid:
Good afternoon.

Arcueid:
I want to thank you for yesterday.

Shiki:
But... I didn't...

Arcueid:


Shiki:
Ah...

Man:
Hey! Watch it!

Arcueid:
Umm...

Ciel:
Oh...

Shiki:
I'm... Sorry.

Ciel:


Shiki:


Arihiko:
Hey.

Shiki:
Ah.

Arihiko:
Wow what's the matter with you?

Shiki:


Arihiko:
Geez I should be telling you the same thing.

Satsuki:


Shiki:
No. Nothing.

Arihiko:


Shiki:


Arihiko:
What do you mean, "someone weird?"

Satsuki:
You think this is something we should report to the school?

Arihiko:


Satsuki:
You're right.

Shiki:
Hey, Yumitsuka.

Satsuki:
Yeah?

Shiki:


Satsuki:
But Tohno.

Shiki:


Arcueid:
Good afternoon.

Arcueid:
You cut me into seventeen pieces of meat in no time at all.

Kunifuji:
It's your responsibility.

Shiki:
Ah.

Kunifuji:
Why are you so rattled?
You're responsible for yesterday's review.

Shiki:
Ah, yes. I'm sorry, sir.

Kunifuji:
Start paying attention.
OK. Sato, you answer this.

Sato:
Yes, sir.

Arihiko:
Umm...

Satsuki:
What's the matter, Tohno?

Shiki:
Ah..?

Arihiko:
You really are acting a little strange.

Shiki:
You think?

Arihiko:
Like, maybe there is a little something going on at home?

Shiki:
What?

Arihiko:


Shiki:
Stressing out huh.

Ciel:


Arihiko:
We were just saying he is acting kind of bizarre.

Ciel:
Is that right?

Shiki:
Ciel sempai, are you into wearing costumes.

Ciel:
I don't spend my time like that.

Shiki:
Sorry, I was just asking.

Ciel:
Ah...

Arihiko:
Umm...

Shiki:
It was a dream after all.

Arihiko:
Hello.

Satsuki:
Ah.

Shiki:
Hi, what's going on, Yumitsuka?

Satsuki:


Shiki:
Happy birthday.

Satsuki:


Shiki:
Really.

Satsuki:
The Italian restaurant in this hotel is famous.

Shiki:
Oh, yeah?

Satsuki:
It must be very tough on you.

Shiki:
Huh?

Satsuki:
I mean you haven't been living in that house for eight years.

Shiki:
Yeah. It does kind of feel like a stranger's house.

Satsuki:
But I am glad.

Shiki:
About what?

Satsuki:


Shiki:
Umm?

Satsuki:
It was the winter at eighth grade.

Shiki:
Eighth grade.

Satsuki:


Shiki:
Anyone in there?

Satsuki:


Shiki:
Just a minute.

Satsuki:
Ah.

Satsuki:
Huh?

Satsuki:
You were the one who helped me that day, weren't you?

Shiki:
Did that really happen?

Satsuki:


Shiki:
Someone like me?

Satsuki:
Someone who looks a little spacey most of the time.

Shiki:
You're saying I look spacey?

Satsuki:


Shiki:
Huh?

Satsuki:
If I'm ever in a trouble again, I know that you'll be the one to rescue me.

Shiki:
I'm not such a reliable person.

Satsuki:
Oh. I think that you are.

Shiki:
Sorry. Did you say something?

Satsuki:
No. I'm headed off in this direction.

Shiki:
OK.

Satsuki:
See you tomorrow.

Shiki:


Hisui:
Ah.

Arcueid:



Arcueid:


Shiki:
Ahhh.

Arcueid:


Shiki:
Ahhh.

Arcueid:


Shiki:
Stay away.

Arcueid:
How can you say such a thing after you murdered me?

Shiki:
I... you're wrong, I never murdered anyone.

Arcueid:
But I may be able to forgive you.

Shiki:
Huh?

Arcueid:


Shiki:
Come back to life?

Arcueid:
That's right.

Shiki:
Don't be ridiculous.

Arcueid:
I'm not. Because I am not a human.

Arcueid:
Trust me. I don't have time to go into the details right now.

Arcueid:
Huh...

Shiki:
Wha.. what the heck were those?

Arcueid:
Servants of the enemy.

Shiki:
Did they hurt you?

Arcueid:


Arcueid:
I could just go ahead and kill you here.

Kohaku:
Master Shiki is late, isn't he?

Akiha:
Yes, he is.

Kohaku:
Hisui.

Hisui:
What is it?

Kohaku:
You haven't heard anything from Master Shiki, have you?

Hisui:
Master Shiki came back a little after four o'clock, and immediately, went out again with a young lady.

Shiki:
To look at you, you're just an ordinary girl.

Shiki:
What do you mean, "you're not human?"

Arcueid:
Well... I don't care for the label... but, maybe you'll understand if I say that I'm a vampire?

Shiki:


Arcueid:
Then how would you explain the fact that I'm standing here after you killed me?

Shiki:
I already told you I didn't kill anyone.

Arcueid:


Shiki:
I'm just a student in high school.

Arcueid:


Shiki:
Your shield?

Arcueid:


Shiki:


Arcueid:
Vampires.

Shiki:


Arcueid:
You've heard about the recent crimes happening in this town, I imagine.

Shiki:
You mean all those bizarre serial murders?

Arcueid:
The one I am looking for commits them.

Shiki:


Arcueid:
I've never had to kill an ordinary high school student before.

Shiki:
Uh.

Arcueid:
You don't have a choice.

Shiki:


Arcueid:
Hmm.

Shiki:
What the hell was that?

Arcueid:


Shiki:
Having a meal?

Arcueid:


Shiki:


Shiki:
Ahhhhh.


Arcueid:


Nero:
huhuhu
Finally, I've found you.
Arcueid Brunestud.
Princess of true ancestor.

Arcueid:
Nero?

Nero:
Indeed.

Shiki:


Shiki:
Hurry!

Shiki:


Arcueid:


Shiki:
Chaos?

Arcueid:


Shiki:
Can you beat him?

Arcueid:
Well... I can't do it now.

Shiki:
Then, what are you going to do?

Shiki:


Arcueid:



Arcueid:


Shiki:
I can see them. The lines.
