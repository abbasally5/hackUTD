  Arcueid:
Are you all right?

Arcueid:
You humans are so fragile.

Shiki:
I'm certainly not like you.

 Uh...
Arcueid:
You did well.

Shiki:
Come in.

Hisui:
Good morning, Master Shiki.

Shiki:
Morning.

Hisui:
How are you feeling today?

Shiki:
Ah... Actually, pretty good. Huh?
 Ah... Thanks. That's nice of you.

Hisui:
Don't you remember, sir?
 My sister took care of you, last night.

Shiki:
Huh? Your sister? You mean Miss Kohaku?

Hisui:
That's right. You see, Kohaku is my twin sister. We're identical.

Shiki:
Really? I didn't know that.

Hisui:
I must apologize for not telling you. I should've done so before.

Shiki:
Oh. There is no need to apologize to me for that. Really.
 I have to admit. Miss Kohaku really did a great job on it.
 It was a pretty bad cut. But it doesn't hurt that much now.

Hisui:
Master Shiki.

Shiki:
Huh.

Hisui:
Sorry. Please change and come to the dining room.
 Miss Akiha is waiting for you.

Shiki:
Ah... Of course.

Hisui:
Then I must be going now.

Shiki:
Akiha.

Kohaku:
Good morning to you, Master Shiki.

Shiki:
Oh. Good morning.

Kohaku:
Would you care for a Japanese or Western style breakfast today?

Shiki:
Japanese, thanks.

Kohaku:
How are you feeling today, Master Shiki?

Shiki:
Thank you. I seem to be all right now.

Kohaku:
I'm happy to hear that.

Akiha:
Alright. Would you like to explain?

Shiki:
Huh? Explain what?

Akiha:
Are you playing dumb with me, Shiki?

Shiki:
Playing dumb? No.

Akiha:
If that's the case, then tell me.
 Where exactly did you go last night?

Shiki:
Well I ah...

Akiha:
Can't you answer me?

Shiki:
I was out with... I was out with a friend of mine.

Akiha:
Was there some reason you weren't able to call?

Shiki:
Well, I was kind of... busy.

Akiha:
Busy? I guess you must've been too busy to go to school.
 I received a call from a fellow name Mr. Inui.

Shiki:
Arihiko called here?

Akiha:
I don't suppose this Mr. Inui is the friend you were with?

Shiki:
Ah... No.

Akiha:
How very odd.
 When Mr. Inui called, he said that the two of you had spent the entire day together yesterday.

Shiki:
Uh...

Akiha:
Mr. Inui must be a very good friend to say something like that.
 Time for the truth, brother.
 Weren't you with a woman?

Shiki:
Ah...

Akiha:
Hisui saw you. She told me.
 I never thought you were the kind of boy to spend a night with a woman and then lie about it to your sister.

Shiki:
What? Spend a night with? It's not what you think.

Akiha:
No? Then please explain.

Shiki:
Well...

Akiha:
That injury has me very concerned.

Shiki:
Ah.

Akiha:
And it's not only me who worries. Both Kohaku and Hisui have been very concerned about your safety.

Shiki:
Ah... I'm sorry.

Kohaku:
That's right.
 Why don't we have a welcome party tonight?

Akiha:
A welcome party?

Kohaku:
A party to welcome young Master Shiki back home again.
 How's your schedule? Are you free, Master Shiki?

Shiki:
Ah... Yeah sure.

Kohaku:
Miss Akiha, Master Shiki is very sorry that he caused us all to worry.
 Perhaps, we can end this discussion.

Akiha:
Alright.

Kohaku:
Then let's get going.
 Let's get ready.
 Hisui, would you come and help me please.

Hisui:
Yes.

Hisui:
You're leaving early today, Master Shiki.

Shiki:
Yeah. There is some place I wanna stop by on my way to school.

Hisui:
Oh, I see. Remember the party.

Shiki:
Yes. I know.
 I'll definitely make sure I'm back by six.

Hisui:
Also, I want to say that I'm sorry.

Shiki:
What are you sorry about?

Hisui:
Master Shiki, it was not necessary to say that I saw you with a woman.

Shiki:
Mm-hm.. It's all right. It was the truth.

Hisui:
I know but...

Shiki:
There was something extremely important I had to do.

Hisui:
Something extremely important? Ah...

Shiki:
But I took care of it. And it's over now. Don't worry.

Hisui:
Alright.

Shiki:
It is over, isn't it?

Kohaku:
When I finally found you, Master Shiki, you were lying in the park.
 Is it possible you had a dream?

Shiki:
Dah...

Arihiko:
Hey.

Shiki:
Arihiko.

Arihiko:
Come on. What's the matter? Why the gloomy face?

Shiki:
Nothing is wrong.

Arihiko:
So there is nothing to matter?

Shiki:
Cut it out! Stop!

Satsuki:
Morning.
 Tohno, Are you all right?
 I was worried because yesterday you didn't make it into school.

Shiki:
Yumitsuka, what are you... I thought you were...

Satsuki:
Uh?

Ciel:
What? You mean to tell me you were supposed to go to that hotel, Yumitsuka?

Arihiko:
Pretty scary, huh? She came down with a fever at the last minute and they stayed home.

Ciel:
Wow I'm really glad you did.

Satsuki:
Me too.

Arihiko:
Yeah. But that's just so you, isn't it? I mean, catching a cold on your birthday.

Satsuki:
Hmm...

Arihiko:
But seriously, this town seems so dangerous these days, doesn't it?

Satsuki:
Yeah. You're right.

Ciel:
Both of you, please be careful.

Arihiko:
Well, I'll be all right.

Ciel:
I'm serious. You keep your guard up.

Shiki:
There won't be another incident like that.

Arihiko:
Now why do you say that? How can you be so sure?

Shiki:
What?

Satsuki:
Do you know something you're not telling us, Tohno?

Shiki:
No. I just have a hunch.
 Wow.

Arihiko:
Alright. Now you're gonna tell us where you went yesterday.

Shiki:
Where I...

Arihiko:
I called your house and they told me you never made it home last night.

Ciel:
Yeah what happened? We were worried. We didn't know where you were.
 We thought that maybe you'd have some kind of accident.

Shiki:
Hey. I'm sorry. OK?

Arihiko:
Don't try to tell me you spent a night with some woman.

Shiki:
Ah..

Arihiko:
You didn't, right? Yes, you did?

Ciel:
Is that the truth, Tohno?
 Did you really?

Shiki:
No, I didn't. Of course not.

Arihiko:
You were making out while we were worried about you?

Shiki:
Look you guys I'm telling you I didn't.

Arihiko:
It just looks kind of suspicious when you get so uptight.

Shiki:
Like you'd know.

Ciel:
Listen to me.
 You mustn't go out at night.

Shiki:
Uh...

Ciel:
Wait a minute, Tohno.

Arihiko:
That coward. Now he's gonna run away.
 I nail that one. It was actually pretty easy to figure out.
 I bet you anything he's involved with some wicked older woman.

Ciel:
You really think so?

Arihiko:
No doubt about it.


Akiha:
Thanks to both of you. Please have a seat.

Kohaku & Hisui:
Yes, ma'am.

Akiha:
Welcome home again, big brother.

Kohaku & Hisui:
Welcome back home, Master Shiki.

Shiki:
It's good to be back.

Shiki:
Delicious.

Akiha:
Yes, Kohaku is an excellent chef. We're fortunate to have her.

Kohaku:
If you're ever in the mood for something special, you only need to tell me.

Shiki:
Thanks. I will.

Kohaku:
It's true I am good at cooking.
 But Hisui, what she is really good at is laundry and cleaning.

Shiki:
Huh, even though you two are twins, you're completely different.

Kohaku:
Yes, that's right.

Akiha:
And Hisui has a very methodical personality.
 That's why she is the perfect match up for a young man like you.

Shiki:
You could be right.

Akiha:
Besides, a long time ago, the two of you used to be playmates together.

Shiki:
Ah?

Kohaku:
Had you forgotten?
 We've been under the care of this family ever since we were very young children.

Shiki:
Ah?
 Wasn't there a boy with us too?

Akiha:
Well.. Do either of you know about that?

Kohaku:
No, Miss.

Shiki:
That's weird. I'm sure.

Akiha:
We used to entertain guests all the time.
 I'm sure you remember that.
 Maybe you mistook him for someone else.

Shiki:
Yeah. You think so?

Kohaku:
Ah.. What is it you need, Master Shiki?

Shiki:
Oh, I'm just thirsty.

Kohaku:
You could ask Hisui to bring you something.

Shiki:
I can do this much for myself.
 Hey, look.

Kohaku:
Is something wrong, Master Shiki?

Shiki:
Can you please, not call me that?

Kohaku:
But, why?

Shiki:
It just makes me uncomfortable.

Kohaku:
I understand. What if I call you Mr. Shiki?

Shiki:
Yeah. I like that better.
 I asked Hisui, if she'd do it too, but well...

Kohaku:
My sister can be a little stubborn sometimes.
 Miss Akiha really looked happy tonight, don't you think?

Shiki:
You think so?

Kohaku:
Oh, yes. It's been eight years since I saw Miss Akiha looked that happy.

Shiki:
No kidding.

Kohaku:
Wanna know something?

Shiki:
What?

Kohaku:
Miss Akiha didn't sleep at all last night.
 She was up all night taking care of you.
 I don't know if you know this. But you are the single most precious person in Miss Akiha's life.

Shiki:
Akiha.

Akiha:
Oh, Shiki.

Shiki:
It's so quiet here. That's nice.

Akiha:
I've always found this place to be the perfect environment for studying.
 But then again, I suppose you might think of that is more of a burden.

Shiki:
Speaking of studying, I thought you were going to a boarding school.
 What happened with that?

Akiha:
I received a special waiver so that I can commute from home.
 Since our father died, the responsibility to protect this house has fallen on my shoulders as head of the household.

Shiki:
I see.
 I'm sorry.

Akiha:
Huh?

Shiki:
For eight years, I didn't contact you.
 Aunt and Uncle Arima tried so hard. I really felt sorry for them.
 Besides, I think it was pretty obvious that our father was just as happy if he didn't have to see me around.

Akiha:
Shiki, that's not it.

Shiki:
Huh, it's all right.
 But I.. I never stopped worrying about you Akiha. Believe me.
 All of the sudden, you're left alone.
 I worried you might feel helpless and lonely.
 And then to become the head of the household.

Akiha:
That was my fate when I was born into this family.

Shiki:
You have become strong, Akiha.

Akiha:
Aha.. I'm not a child anymore.

Shiki:
No, you are not.
 You become quite beautiful.

Akiha:
Ah.. You should probably think about going to bed pretty soon, OK?
 The evening wind isn't good for you.
 If you get sick again, then Hisui, Kohaku and I won't know what to do.

Shiki:
You're right. I think I will.
 Akiha.

Akiha:
Yes?

Shiki:
That day I came back to the house, I was wondering...
 Akiha, did you...

Kohaku:
I don't know if you know this. But you are the single most precious person in Miss Akiha's life.

Shiki:
No. Forget about it.
 Good night, Akiha.

Akiha:
Good night to you, my brother.

Shiki:
Ah..? What are you..? Arcueid?
 Huh!? Wha.. What are you doing?
 Why are you here anyway?

Arcueid:
I'm here because you wanted to see me, Shiki.

Shiki:
No... No, I didn't.

Arcueid:
You are a liar.

Shiki:
What are you doing?
 Wha..

Arcueid:
I want you... your blood.
 Hahhh.

Shiki:
Wohhh.

Shiki:
Why.. Why would I have a dream like that?

Kiyomi:
Good afternoon everyone. It's time for the TVS afternoon news.
At WWB feather weight title match held in Los Angels yesterday...

Arihiko:
You are going too, aren't you?

Shiki:
Huh? Going? Going where?

Satsuki:
To the amusement park.

Arihiko:
Remember? We were talking about going there on Sunday.

Shiki:
Sunday?

Arihiko:
Come on now. Don't try to tell me you have a date.

Shiki:
No, I don't.

Ciel:
Then that settles it.

Satsuki:
I heard they recently renovated the entire amusement park.

Arihiko:
Hey, and I've heard they got a new water ride.

Ciel:
Sure sounds like fun.

Announcer:
Another body has been found and the police are linking it to the recent serial murder case. The victim...

Arihiko:
Not again.

Satsuki:
How scary.

Announcer:
...currently the police are examining the scene as before the blood of the victim's body has been drained.

Kiyomi:
Nor have investigators had any [luck] with the mass disappearance case at the Century Hotel the other day.
Police are asking the residents to go home early...

Arihiko:
Tohno.

Kiyomi:
.. and to avoid...

Arihiko:
What's the matter?

Kiyomi:
... going out at night unless absolutely necessary.

Arihiko:
Hey, Tohno.

Satsuki:
Tohno?

Arihiko:
What's the matter?
 You got so quiet all of a sudden.

Boy A:
Hey, who is she?

Boy B:
She is gorgeous.

Arihiko:
What is it? What's going on?
 Oh.. Check her out. She is not from around here.
 What do you think, Tohno?

Satsuki:
Are you all right?

Shiki:
Why...? Why is she here?

Arcueid:
Ah, Shiki.

Arihiko:
Shiki!?
 Hey, you got some explaining to do

Satsuki:
She sure acts like she knows you, Tohno.


Shiki:
Reincarnation of Akasha's snakes.
 Silver stake that rips the night sky into pieces.
 Trembling eyes. Thirst for red blood.


Arcueid:
I drink no blood.
 Because I hate blood.
