Watch your step getting out.
Whaaaaaa

Kiyono:
Good afternoon and welcome to the TVS news afternoon edition.

Announcer:
Topic today's headline is the bizzar serial murder...

Satsuki:
I was so surprised to hear that.

Arihiko:


Shiki:
Yeah.

Ciel:
That means whoever did this could have been very close to us.

Satsuki:
That's scary.

Ciel:
I know you're right.

Arihiko:


Satsuki:
Huhuhu

Ciel:
Huhuhu
Is your sister all right, Tohno?

Shiki:
Huh?

Arihiko:
Yeah. Did you ever find out why she took off by herself and went home early?

Shiki:
I'm not really sure. She's been acting kind of strange since then.

Announcer:
... the victim is Tomomi Ando was a resident of Kanagawa. Around seven p.m. yesterday, she separated from her friends
She seemed to have got onto the Ferris wheel alone but...

Shiki:
Ciel, do you know anything about it?

Ciel:
No, nothing.

Shiki:
I see.

Akiha:
Un?

Shiki:


Akiha:
Uh... It's nothing.

Shiki:


Akiha:
I didn't have an appetite. That's all.

Shiki:
Is something wrong with your health?

Akiha:
I'm fine.

Shiki:
You've been acting a little strange ever since you came home from the amusement park.

Akiha:
It's nothing. I just don't feel well.

Shiki:
Did something happen between Ciel and...?

Akiha:
No. Nothing happened. Now please leave me alone.

Shiki:
Akiha?

Shiki:
Akiha!

Kohaku:
Miss Akiha.

Shiki:
What's wrong?

Kohaku:
What is it? What happened Miss Akiha?

Shiki:
Are you all right?

Kohaku:
Miss Akiha, are you all right?

Shiki:
[xxx] Akiha.

Kohaku:
Miss Akiha.

Shiki:
Akiha.

Shiki:
I don't know. Are you sure we don't need to call a doctor?

Kohaku:


Shiki:
Yeah, but.

Kohaku:


Akiha:
No, Shiki. Please don't.

Shiki:
But...

Akiha:


Shiki:


Kohaku:
Perhaps, all of this was brought on mentally.

Shiki:
What? So you think this could all be mental?

Kohaku:


Shiki:
I was right. It's all my fault.

Kohaku:
It's not. You can't blame yourself. You've been home for sometime now. And Miss Akiha's been fine.

Shiki:
I know. But I've made her worry a lot since I came back.

Kohaku:


Shiki:
Hmm.

Akiha:
Big brother, big brother? Where are you? Brother?

Shiki:
I'm here.

Akiha:
Where?

Shiki:
Right here. Akiha.

Akiha:
Thank you, big brother. Hmm

Akiha:
Huh...

Shiki:
Akiha? How do you feel?

Akiha:
I'm all right. As a matter of fact, I feel quite rested.

Shiki:
That's good.

Akiha:
I.. was dreaming. It was so real.

Shiki:
A dream, huh?

Akiha:


Shiki:
You should get some more rest. I'll stay right here with you [in case you] need me.

Akiha:
OK.

Akiha:


Shiki:


Akiha:
Be sure to eat some breakfast before you leave.

Shiki:
I will. You too. And make sure you stay in bed today.

Akiha:
I will.

Arcueid:
Hun...

Arcueid:
What happened last night? I waited for you for a long time.

Shiki:
I'm sorry. It was Akiha. She wasn't feeling well.

Arcueid:
Your sister, right?

Shiki:
Yeah.

Arcueid:
Hmm.

Shiki:
What about you?

Arcueid:
No luck I'm afraid.

Shiki:
I see. I'm sorry, but I can't go out for a while. Just for a few days.

Arcueid:
Really. So what you're saying is it doesn't matter to you if Roa kills me.

Shiki:
No, I didn't say that.

Arcueid:
You are indifferent now. You don't care anymore.

Ciel:
Tohno.

Shiki:
Huh?

Ciel:
What is it? Did something happen?

Shiki:
Well... Yeah, quite a bit.

Ciel:
Tohno.

Shiki:
Yeah?

Ciel:
I was just wondering. Would you like to come and have tea with me?

Shiki:
Ah... Sure.

Ciel:
I see. How was Miss Akiha?

Shiki:
Well... Actually she's sick in bed.

Ciel:
I thought so.

Shiki:
Ah...?

Ciel:
Ah.

Shiki:
What did you mean?

Ciel:
Oh... Nothing. Please.

Shiki:
I um...

Ciel:
Yes?

Shiki:


Ciel:
I'm the person you know. There is nothing more to me than that.

Shiki:
I was just wondering, that's all.

Ciel:
Do you think that I'm not telling you the truth? You think I would do that?

Shiki:
Ah... No. I didn't mean that.

Ciel:
Everyone carries around some kind of secret. You probably have a secret too, don't you?

Shiki:
Ah...

Ciel:


Shiki:
Ah. Ciel?

Ciel:


Shiki:


Hisui:


Shiki:
Ah...?


Shiki:
So, are you feeling better?

Akiha:
Yes. I'm feeling much better now, thank you.

Shiki:
That's good. I'm glad.

Akiha:
Just knowing that you were there beside me if I needed you helped.

Kohaku:
Is something the matter?

Shiki:
Yesterday, in the early evening.

Kohaku:


Shiki:
Er...

Kohaku:
Is something wrong?

Shiki:
I thought I saw you in Akiha's room last night.

Kohaku:
What? You saw me in her bedroom?

Shiki:
Yeah.

Kohaku:


Shiki:
But...

Arcueid:
Are you feeling all right today?

Shiki:
Yeah.

Arcueid:
How about your sister? Is she feeling better?

Shiki:
Yeah. I have a strange question.

Arcueid:
What is it?

Shiki:
The one that you've been looking for all this time, it is a man, isn't it?

Arcueid:
Do you mean Roa?

Shiki:
Yeah.

Arcueid:


Shiki:
What do you mean? What is it?

Arcueid:
The person always belongs to a special family.

Shiki:
How are they special?

Arcueid:
For example, thier blood has something other than human mixed in.

Shiki:
What the... what's this mean?

Kohaku:
What are you doing, Master Shiki?

Shiki:
Er...

Kohaku:
This is Mr. Makihisa's room is there something you wanted in here?

Shiki:


Kohaku:
Really.

Shiki:
But you see. I always thought this family was normal but it's not.

Kohaku:
I'm not quite sure what you mean.

Shiki:


Kohaku:
Uhu... It's just coincidence.

Shiki:
Come in.

Hisui:


Shiki:
I wanna ask you something.

Hisui:
What is it?

Shiki:
I wanna know what it is you all hiding from me.

Hisui:
Hiding?

Shiki:
About this family, about Akiha and about the past I can't remember.

Hisui:
Master Shiki.

Shiki:
Akiha.

Arcueid:
Thier blood has something other than human mixed in.

Arcueid:
Shiki. Roa has appeared.

Shiki:
He appeared? when?

Arcueid:
From the looks of it, maybe about an hour ago.

Shiki:
I see.

Kohaku:
Miss Akiha.

Arcueid:
I can't find him.

Shiki:
Can't you sense him?

Arcueid:
I usually can, unless the character of the host is very strong and masks him.

Arcueid:
Why were you home?

Shiki:
Uh... well... I was worried about something.

Arcueid:
It's not your sister.

Shiki:
How did you know I was thinking that?

Arcueid:
I think it's safe to assume she is not a normal human.

Shiki:
Well then, what is she?

Arcueid:
Well...

Shiki:
Well, tell me.

Arcueid:


Shiki:
Ah... I think so.

Arcueid:
Really.

Shiki:
Yeah.

Arcueid:
How odd.

Shiki:
What do you mean?

Arcueid:
It's nothing, really.

Shiki:


Arcueid:
Forget it. So we've done enough. Why don't we call a quit for today?

Shiki:
Ah...?

Akiha:
Brother! No!

Shiki:
Who are you?

Shiki:
No. Can he possibly see?

Bandaged Man:
Tell me. Does your wound hurt?
Huhuhu ahahaha.
The meaning of the wound will stay with you forever.
You're the one, aren't you?

Akiha:
Brother.

Shiki:
Ah...

Bandaged Man:
Er...

Akiha:



Arcueid:


Shiki:
Only what you said was true.
