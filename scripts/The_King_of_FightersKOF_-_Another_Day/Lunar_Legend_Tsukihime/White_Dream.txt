  Shiki:
Good morning.

Akiha:
Good morning, my brother. And how are you today?

Kohaku:


Shiki:
I'll just have something to drink, thanks.

Kohaku:


Shiki:
I'm sorry but I don't have time. It would make me late for school.

Akiha:


Kohaku:


Shiki:
Yeah, that's fine.

Kohaku:
Excellent. I'll go and prepare it for you right away.

Shiki:


Akiha:
If you'd like, perhaps we could hire a tutor to help supplement your studies.

Shiki:
Hmm.

Akiha:


Shiki:
You're probably right.

Akiha:
But I must admit I am relieved.

Shiki:
What?

Akiha:
It seems like you're finally beginning to get used to the Tohno family style of life.

Shiki:
I guess.

Hisui:


Shiki:
Thanks, Hisui. I'm sorry to make you worry.

Hisui:


Shiki:
Thanks, I will. I'd better get going now.

Girl A:
Hey, did you hear?

Girl B:
You mean about the eleventh grade boys in class B?

Girl C:
So what happened to them?

Girl A:
I just heard they are missing.

Girl C:
When did that happen? I just saw them in town the other day.

Girl A:
Nobady's seen them since then. It's weird.

Girl B:
You think they just ran away?

Girl A:
Maybe.

Arihiko:
You're kidding. You mean you haven't heard about it?

Shiki:
No.

Arihiko:
You're always such an airhead. I can't believe it.

Shiki:
You think they really ran away?

Arihiko:
I have no idea.

Satsuki:
It doesn't seem safe anymore.

Arihiko:


Ciel:


Shiki:
Er...?

Ciel:
For the amusement park.

Shiki:
Oh...

Satsuki:
Can't you make it?

Shiki:
What?

Satsuki:
I understand. You have a girlfriend now, don't you.

Arihiko:
Oh, that's right. You probably have a date.

Shiki:
No.

Ciel:
You should stay away from that woman.

Satsuki:
Er...

Arihiko:
Er...

Shiki:
Er...

Arihiko:


Shiki:
What?

Ciel:
How about if we all meet tomorrow morning at ten o'clock at the station?

Arihiko:
No problem at all. It sounds perfect. Right? Right?

Ciel:
So then we have your word? You will be there.

Shiki:
Oh... Ah... Yeah.

Arihiko:
Give me a break, will ya?

Shiki:
About what?

Arihiko:


Shiki:
Huh?

Arihiko:
Haa... Thanks to you, the atmosphere between Ciel and Yumitsuka is all messed up

Shiki:
Er...

Arihiko:
It's about time you make it clear.

Shiki:
Make what clear?

Arihiko:
Oh, man I can't believe you.

Shiki:
Oh...

Boy A:
Whoa... Check her out.

Girl A:
Hey, who's that girl?

Girl B:
I don't know. She doesn't look like she belongs in this school.

Boy B:
Go on, ask her out.

Arcueid:
Ufu...

Shiki:
Uh...

Shiki:
What do you think you're doing?

Arcueid:
I've come to pick you up.

Shiki:
I've told you before not to come to the school.

Arcueid:
What do you expect me to do? I was bored.

Shiki:
Ah... Give me a break.

Arcueid:
As long as I'm here, why don't we go see a movie?

Shiki:
I'm not going.

Arcueid:
Why not? It's open during the day, isn't it?

Shiki:


Arcueid:
Too busy doing what?

Shiki:
Well, I have lots of things I need to take care of at home.

Arcueid:
I'll come with you then, and I can help you out.

Shiki:
Huh?

Arcueid:
I wanna go to your house. I've never been inside.

Shiki:
Forget it.

Arcueid:
Well, why not?

Shiki:
You gotta be kidding me. What if she gets the wrong idea?

Arcueid:
Who would get the wrong idea?

Shiki:
My sister would.

Arcueid:


Shiki:
You're just kidding now, alright?

Arcueid:
Are you afraid of your sister?

Shiki:
I don't wanna make her worry. That's all.

Arcueid:
I understand. So we'll see a movie then.

Shiki:


Akiha:
Would you like to tell me what's bothering you, brother?

Shiki:
Er?

Akiha:


Shiki:
No. It's not that. The food is fine.

Shiki:
Thank you for dinner.

Akiha:
Shiki, wait.

Shiki:
Huh?

Akiha:
If you don't have plans, would you consider joining me for a cup of tea?

Shiki:
Er... sure.

Kohaku:
Excellent then. I'll prepare the dessert.

Akiha:


Shiki:
I'm really not sure. You see I don't know all that much about tea.

Akiha:
Huh... Then what about the marron cake? Do you like it?

Shiki:
Oh, yeah. It's delicious.

Akiha:
Kohaku made it from scratch using chestnuts from our garden.

Shiki:
Oh.

Akiha:
Hisui said something.

Shiki:
Er...?

Akiha:
She mentioned that you like a television. Is that right?

Shiki:
Ah... yeah.

Akiha:
If there's anything you need, please don't hesitate to ask me.

Shiki:
Well, yeah but...

Akiha:
I'll have them deliver one tomorrow. Do you want the type that mounts on the wall?

Shiki:
You don't have to, really. I know you don't like noisy things.

Akiha:
That's true. Still, if you really want one, I don't mind making a little compromise this time.

Shiki:
Huhu...

Shiki:
Do you take many private lessons?

Akiha:
Yes. English conversation, piano, violin, tea ceremony and flower arrangement.

Shiki:
Oh...

Akiha:
Although, I've cut back recently. I was taking ballet and calligraphy lessons as well.

Shiki:
Being [an aristocrat / in a xxx club], it's not that easy, is it?

Akiha:


Shiki:
That's a good idea. But I don't think so.

Akiha:
Is something the matter?

Shiki:
What? Oh... I was just thinking maybe I should do some studying soon.

Akiha:
That's a bit unusual for you.

Shiki:
Well, every once in a while. It's because I have some exams comming up.

Akiha:
I guess I should let you go then.

Hisui:
I'm sorry to interrupt, Miss Akiha. But you have a phone call from Mr. Kugamine.

Akiha:
It's all right.

Akiha:
Hisui.

Hisui:
Yes?

Akiha:
Do you know where my brother is?

Hisui:
I believe he's gone to bed, ma'am.

Akiha:
Gone to bed?

Hisui:
Yes, ma'am.

Shiki:
Arcueid.


Shiki:


Shiki:
Did she go on alone because she was mad at me?

Arcueid:


Shiki:
She couldn't have possibly...

Akiha:
Shiki? Are you... Ah...

Man:
This is for you.
Let's do this again.

Arcueid:


Shiki:


Arcueid:
Part time work.

Shiki:


Arcueid:
I never knew that modeling pays so well.

Shiki:
Um...

Arcueid:
Let's go.

Shiki:
Er... Hey, wait a minute.

Arcueid:
What? Is there a problem?

Shiki:
What made you decide to work part time?

Arcueid:
Why do you think? Because I need the money.

Shiki:


Arcueid:


Shiki:
Well, I...

Arcueid:
Why are you so upset?

Shiki:
What's the matter?

Arcueid:
It's the dead.

Shiki:
What?

Girl A:
Hey, did you hear?

Girl B:
You mean about the eleventh grade boys in class B?

Girl C:
So what happened to them?

Girl A:
I just heard they are missing.

Shiki:
It's them.

Dead A:
Uh...

Dead B:
Ugaaaa...

Dead C:
No. Tohno.
Come on. We are friends, right?

Dead B:
Ah...

Arcueid:


Dead C:
Huh.

Arcueid:
Shiki, watch out.

Dead C:
Haaa Uhhhh. Ah...

Arcueid:
Uh...

Shiki:

Uh...

Arcueid:
Shiki. What's wrong?

Arcueid:
Sorry, it took so long.

Shiki:
Ah...

Arcueid:
Are these wrong?

Shiki:
They're fine.

Arcueid:
I have wanted to take you somewhere nice to eat but...

Shiki:
Thank you. I appreciate the thought.

Arcueid:
So, how's it taste?

Shiki:
It's good. I feel much better.

Arcueid:
I was wondering. Was I wrong?

Shiki:
Ah... About what?

Arcueid:
When I first met you, I thought you were simply a murderer.

Shiki:
I told you from the beginning. I'm just a normal human being.

Arcueid:
It's all right if you don't want to.

Shiki:
What do you mean?

Arcueid:
I can do it alone.

Shiki:
What are you trying to say?

Arcueid:
Well, I...

Shiki:
OK, listen. Your wounds haven't healed yet, have they?

Arcueid:
I thought they were all healed but...

Shiki:
But more importantly, I can't leave you alone.

Arcueid:
Eh...

Shiki:
Don't try to be something you're not. All right?

Arcueid:
You really don't want to.

Shiki:
That's true. I'd be lying if I said I did.

Arcueid:
Then why are you?

Shiki:
My decision is made. I've already decided to help you.

Arcueid:
Hey, Shiki. Let's go up there all the way to the top.

Shiki:
Hmm?

Arcueid:
What is that?

Shiki:
That's the train station.

Arcueid:
And what's that, there?

Shiki:
The park.

Arcueid:
So, where is your school then?

Shiki:
I think that it's somewhere over there.

Arcueid:
And where's your house?

Shiki:
It's right up there on that hill.

Arcueid:
Oh... I see.

Shiki:
Don't get any funny ideas.

Arcueid:


Shiki:


Arcueid:
Let's see. I think it was about eight hundred years ago.

Shiki:


Arcueid:


Shiki:
Yeah?

Arcueid:
Why don't we go out on a date? I'd like to experience dating.



Shiki:


Akiha:
I'm worried that something bad might happen to you. Is that reason enough for you or would you like more?
