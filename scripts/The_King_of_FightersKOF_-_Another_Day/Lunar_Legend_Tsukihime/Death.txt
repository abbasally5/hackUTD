  Shiki:
No. Can he possibly see?
Bandaged Man:
Tell me. Does your wound hurt?

Akiha:
My brother.
Mother:
Shiki. Shiki. Shiki. Shiki. Shiki. Shiki. Shiki. This way.

Shiki:
Ah.

Akiha:
Brother, are you all right?

Shiki:
I was dreaming.

Akiha:
Go on. Your dream?

Shiki:


Akiha:
Brother, I want you to tell me.

Shiki:
Ah...

Akiha:
You need to tell me what you've been doing.

Shiki:
I'm sure you are aware of all the weird incidents that have been happening in town lately.

Akiha:
Yes.

Shiki:
Well, I've been out there looking for the suspect.

Akiha:
Uh.

Shiki:


Akiha:
Why would you do something like this?

Shiki:


Akiha:


Shiki:


Akiha:
What exactly are you trying to say?

Shiki:
That night, you called him "brother".

Akiha:
That's totally ridiculous. You are my only brother.

Akiha:
Shiki.

Shiki:
Ah...? Huh?

Kohaku:
Good morning, Mr. Shiki.

Shiki:
Where is Akiha?

Kohaku:
She got up early and has already gone out.

Shiki:
I see.

Kohaku:


Shiki:
There is no need to be concerned anymore.

Kohaku:
Huh?

Shiki:


Kohaku:
This time?

Shiki:
I've had enough of this secret you're keeping.

Kohaku:
We are not keeping any secret.

Shiki:


Kohaku:
No, that's not it.

Shiki:


Kohaku:


Shiki:
A secret?

Kohaku:
It's that the Tohno clan carries blood that's something other than human.

Shiki:
What exactly do you mean?

Kohaku:
No one knows for sure. But I've heard the person who carries the strongest blood has assumed the duty as the head of the household for generations.

Shiki:
Then, Akiha is...

Kohaku:
Ever since Miss Akiha has taken over the head of the household, that's become harder and harder for her to contain the power of the blood by herself.

Shiki:
What happens if she can't contain it.

Kohaku:
I have no idea. Miss Akiha is the only one who knows that depth of the pain and suffering.

Shiki:
No...

Kohaku:


Shiki:


Kohaku:


Kohaku:


Hisui:
Excuse me.

Shiki:
Yes, what is it?

Hisui:


Shiki:
Ah...

Hisui:
If you wanted to find out about something, this might be a good time. There'd be no one to stop you.

Shiki:
So what are you saying?

Hisui:
Well, I can't just come right down and tell you. If I did, I'd loose my job.

Shiki:
Thanks a lot, Hisui.


Shiki:
This place, what is it?

Boy:
Ahaha hahaha...

Akiha:
Brother? Brother? I'm sorry, brother.

Shiki:
Akiha? Why are you apologizing?

Akiha:
Brother?

Boy:
Akiha.

Shiki:
This place.

Akiha:
Brother?

Teacher:
Miss Tohno? What is the matter? Miss Tohno.

Boy:
Hey, don't cry anymore.
Bandaged Man:
The meaning of the wound will stay with you forever.

Shiki:
Did I actually kill him? Then my father...

Shiki:
Uh...? What's going on? Where am I?
Doctor:
You're in a hospital.

Shiki:
A hospital?
Doctor:
You don't remember, do you?
You were involved in a traffic accident.

Shiki:
I was?
Doctor:
That's right. I had to remove a piece of glass that was stuck in your chest.
But we were able to save you. You're going to be all right now.

Shiki:


Arcueid:
Because, you are a bloodthirsty murderer, Shiki. You killed me.

Shiki:
Arcueid.

Staff:
Thank you, enjoy the film.

Arcueid:
Huh... I wonder if Shiki is still upset.

Akiha:


Shiki:
Sorry, Akiha.

Akiha:
Brother.

Akiha:
How many times have I told you? Why did you let my brother...?

Hisui:
I'm very sorry, Miss Akiha.

Akiha:
What will I do? Shiki is going to remember.

Kohaku:
Hisui, why did you let Mr. Shiki...?

Hisui:


Aoko:


Shiki:
I've been wrong. All this time, I've been wrong. Sorry.

Akiha:
Ah... I've reached my limit.

Boy:
Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me.



Shiki:


Arcueid:
If I weren't a vampire, then I wonder what would have happened. I mean between you and me.
