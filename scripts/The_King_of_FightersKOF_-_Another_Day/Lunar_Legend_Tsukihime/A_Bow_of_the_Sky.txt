  Satsuki:
Tohno, wait.

Arihiko:
Ever since he was a kid, he has atracted bad luck like a magnet.

Arcueid:
How have you been, Shiki?

Shiki:
What's going on? What are you doing here anyway?

Boy A:
Hey, lady.
Hey, yahoo.

Arcueid:
Yahoo.

Boy A:
What's going on, huh?

Arcueid:
Hey, hi. Oh.

Shiki:
Come here a minute.

Arcueid:


Shiki:
Just what do you think you are doing back there?

Arcueid:
Huh?

Shiki:
You show up at school like it's nothing.

Arcueid:
Is that wrong?

Shiki:


Arcueid:
I don't know. Why not tell them the truth?

Shiki:


Arcueid:
If you don't trust me, just say so.

Shiki:


Arcueid:
Have you not heard a word I've said?

Shiki:
Huh?

Arcueid:


Shiki:


Arcueid:
Oh, come on now. Of all the vampires, how could you doubt me?

Shiki:
Then, what was Nero?

Arcueid:
Nero was an ordinary assassin.

Shiki:
An assassin?

Arcueid:


Shiki:
I understand.

Arcueid:
Ah...

Shiki:
You want me to help find your enemy.

Arcueid:
Ah... Yes.

Shiki:
So when do we start?

Arcueid:
The park tonight at nine o'clock.

Shiki:
OK, see you then.

Hisui:
Are you going out?

Shiki:
Ah...

Hisui:
Is it important business?

Shiki:
Ah...

Hisui:
The reason you're going out tonight, Master Shiki, is it important business?

Shiki:
Uh huh.

Hisui:


Shiki:
But why?

Hisui:
Simple. Because you are my master, Master Shiki.

Shiki:


Hisui:


Shiki:
Well, I have to get going. Good night, Hisui.

Hisui:
Have a good evening, Master Shiki.

Shiki:
Akasha's snake?

Arcueid:
Some people refer to Roa by that name.

Shiki:
So what is he?

Arcueid:
In Roa's fanatical search for eternal life he's given up the idea clinging to a particular body.

Shiki:
What exactly do you mean?

Arcueid:
I mean he reincarnates.

Shiki:
Are you serious?

Arcueid:


Shiki:
So there is no end. He can go on forever.

Arcueid:
It's possible.

Shiki:
So who did he reincarnate into now?

Arcueid:
I don't know.

Shiki:
And his whereabouts?

Arcueid:
He's become aware that I'm here in this town. And he must have gone into hiding.

Shiki:


Arcueid:
Look at that man.

Shiki:
Huh?

Arcueid:
Quickly.

Shiki:
Ah... Hey, wait.

Dead:
Ahhhhhhhh.

Shiki:
He... He disappeared.

Arcueid:
He is one of the dead.

Shiki:
One of the dead?

Arcueid:
Those people whose blood has been sucked by Roa.

Shiki:
Does that mean they are servants of the dead apostle?

Arcueid:


Shiki:
So the idea is to smoke him out, is that it?

Arcueid:
So why did you decide to help me all of a sudden?

Shiki:
What?

Arcueid:
You didn't wanna get involved. What happened?

Shiki:
To tell you the truth, I still don't wanna get mixed up in all this.

Arcueid:
Then, why are you doing it?

Shiki:
Maybe it's because of the pain.

Arcueid:
I'm not sure what you mean.

Shiki:
When I thought Yumitsuka's been murdered in the hotel that night.

Arcueid:
What's your point?

Shiki:


Arcueid:
That's the reason?

Shiki:
I wonder.

Arcueid:
Maybe.

Shiki:
Huh?

Arcueid:
I was thinking, Shiki, that maybe it's possible for you to beat Roa.

Shiki:
Get serious. Even you have difficulty dealing with him.

Arcueid:
You always do that. Why do you always underestimate yourself, Shiki?

Shiki:
The problem is she overestimates me too much.


Arihiko:
Not enough sleep?

Shiki:
Huh? No, not really.

Arihiko:
So what's been keeping you up so late at night.

Shiki:
What are you talking about anyway?

Arihiko:


Shiki:
No. It's not like that. It's not what you think.

Arihiko:
I'm so jealous. I want a girlfriend too.

Shiki:
She's not my girlfriend.

Ciel:
Tohno.

Shiki:
Ciel Sempai.

Ciel:
I was wondering if you'd like to have a cup of tea.

Shiki:
Yeah.

Ciel:
Please go ahead.

Shiki:
This is very authentic, isn't it?

Ciel:
Well, I am the leader of the tea ceremony club.

Shiki:
Is that right. I didn't know that.

Ciel:
It's not a big deal. You see the club only has one member.

Shiki:
Thank you. It was very good, Sempai.

Ciel:
You are very welcome, Tohno.

Shiki:
By the way, was there some special reason you asked me here for the tea today?

Ciel:
Ah Tohno. Is there anything at all that's been worrying you lately?

Shiki:
Huh?

Ciel:


Shiki:
Uh...

Ciel:
Is it about her?

Shiki:
Who do you mean?

Ciel:
The lady who came to see you at school yesterday.

Shiki:
Uh...

Ciel:


Shiki:
Really? I had no idea. So then you know all about her, Ciel Sempai?

Ciel:
No.

Shiki:
But then how...?

Ciel:
It's just my nature. I can't allow you to hurt yourself.

Shiki:
Ah?

Ciel:
Not a person like you, Tohno.

Arcueid:
Uh?

Arcueid:
You're so late.

Shiki:
What just happened here?

Arcueid:
Huh?

Shiki:
Because this guy, he...

Arcueid:
Oh, him? He just asked me to go out on a date.

Shiki:
What?

Arcueid:


Shiki:
It really is dangerous, isn't it?

Arcueid:
Huh? Did you say something?

Shiki:
No. Nothing.

Shiki:


Arcueid:
What's that right there?

Shiki:


Arcueid:
A video arcade?

Shiki:
Yeah.

Arcueid:
Hmm.

Shiki:
Hold on. Wait up. Where are you going?

Arcueid:
Let's play.

Arcueid:
You're surprisingly clumsy. Did you know that?

Shiki:
Sorry, I'll work on it.

Arcueid:
Hey, what's this?

Shiki:
It's a movie theater.

Arcueid:
Alright, let's go here next.

Shiki:
No.

Arcueid:
Er? Why not?

Shiki:


Arcueid:
Is that so?

Shiki:
You're sure it's all right for us to be doing these things?

Arcueid:
I think it's all right. Otherwise, I would have sensed something.

Shiki:
Still, it seems strange.

Arcueid:
What do you mean?

Shiki:


Arcueid:
Oh, really? You just have to let go of your preconception, Shiki.

Shiki:
Unfortunately, I didn't grow up with a lot of vampires around.

Man A:
Alright then, let's get going.
It'll be my treat today.

Woman A:
What? You don't have to.

Man B:
You're sure about this?

Man A:
Absolutely. I've gotta cover.

Woman A:
That's very nice of you.

Man B:
You feel like going out for drink?

Man A:
Sure. Sounds great.

Arcueid:


Cashier:
There we are. Your total is two thousand three hundred and fifty two yen.

Arcueid:
All right, let's see.

Shiki:
Uh... Ah...

Cashier:
Thank you very much.

Arcueid:
Hey, Shiki.

Shiki:
What you did back there was a crime.

Arcueid:
All I did was make a few copies because I was short.

Shiki:


Arcueid:
I'm sorry. But is that my fault?

Shiki:


Arcueid:


Shiki:
Oh. Guess I must have cut it on something. I was in such a hurry, I didn't notice.

Shiki:
Is something wrong? It's not big deal really. I'm not worried about it.

Arcueid:
Enough.

Shiki:
Huh?

Arcueid:
We've done enough today.

Shiki:


Ciel:
I haven't seen you for a while. Where have you been hiding, Arcueid Brunestud?

Arcueid:
Did you come here so I could kill you again, Ciel?

Ciel:
And how do you plan on doing that since your wound from being killed by Shiki hasn't healed yet?

Arcueid:
What is it that you want then? Your current target should be the same as mine.

Ciel:
I imagine you're right.

Arcueid:
Then why don't you just stay out of my way? You're an eyesore.

Ciel:
No, I can't do that. I can't allow Shiki to fall into a dangerous situation.

Arcueid:
Too bad. Shiki has already accepted that.

Ciel:


Arcueid:
What are you saying?

Ciel:


Arcueid:
And I'll be waiting for you.



Arcueid:


Shiki:
Come to think of it, I've never asked to tell me about yourself.
