  Akiha:
Brother? Are you up yet?
 My brother.

 Arcueid:
Shiki? Shiki. Come on. How long are you gonna lie there?

 Shiki:
Oh, it's you Arcueid. Why are you here anyway?

 Arcueid:
You didn't keep your promise to me. I wanna know what's going on.

 Shiki:
Uh...

 Arcueid:
I waited for you the entire night. I waited so long that it's morning already.
 So I'm just very angry with you right now, OK? Do you understand?

 Shiki:
I'm sorry.

 Arcueid:
Why don't we go out on a date?

 Shiki:
Huh?

 Arcueid:
If you go on a date with me, I'll forgive you.
 What do you say? It's such a beautiful day today.
 It wouldn't be healthy for you to stay inside your room.

 Shiki:
Somehow, I never expected to hear that from a vampire.

 Arcueid:
Is that so?

 Shiki:
You seem to be having fun.

 Arcueid:
That's because I've always wanted to experience dating.

 Shiki:
You were pretty upset just a minute ago.

 Arcueid:
You're right about that. I wonder what made me get so angry at you.

 Shiki:
Shouldn't I be the one asking you that?

 Arcueid:
Maybe it's because you're so kind to just about everybody.

 
Shiki:
 You mean I'm indecisive.

 Arcueid:
But you always seem so indifferent towards me.

 Shiki:
That's because you are a very special person.

 Arcueid:
Really?

 Shiki:
Why are you so happy, all of a sudden?

 Arcueid:
Am I really that special to you?

 Shiki:
That came out differently than what I meant.

 Arcueid:
Hey, let's talk.

 Shiki:
OK. What about?

 Arcueid:
We could talk about anything. There are so many things that I'd like to talk about with you.

 Shiki:
Ah, you are a strange one. That's for sure.

 Ciel:
Tohno still hasn't shown up yet?

 Arihiko:
No sign at the guy.

 Satsuki:
I wonder if he's out on a date with Arcueid somewhere.

 Arihiko:
No there is no way. We're all talking about Shiki here. I'm thinking that maybe the guy just collapsed again.

 Arcueid:
Shiki? Aren't you having any fun?

 Shiki:
Huh? Oh, it's not that.

 Arcueid:
Hmm...

 Shiki:
But do you really think that we should be doing this?
 I mean now that Roa started moving in everything.

 Arcueid:
Relax. We've got nothing to worry about. He only goes into action at night.

 Shiki:
Yeah, I know but...

 Arcueid:
Hey, let's see a movie.

 Shiki:
Huh?

 Shiki:
So, what did you think?

 Arcueid:
Hmm...

 Shiki:
Was it boring?

 Arcueid:
No. It really moved me.

 Shiki:
Huh?

 Arcueid:
There is a big difference between hearing about it and watching it.
 I liked sitting in the dark like that. The sound was pretty loud, but it wasn't too noisy.
 But even beyond all those things, the actual story was really good.

 Shiki:
Oh, really?

 Arcueid:
I was surprised that someone would have the imagination to make up such a wild story like that.
 Really, I was quite impressed.

 Shiki:
You were? Huh.

 Arcueid:
So was it boring for you then, Shiki?

 Shiki:
Umm... It's not that it was boring. It was just ordinary.

 Arcueid:
Liar. Because it really was very good.

 Shiki:
Yeah but there are so many things that are more interesting than that.

 Arcueid:
Are you serious?

 Shiki:
Yeah.

 Arcueid:
I can't believe that there is even more interesting things.
 But I think the reason it was fun is because you were with me.

 Shiki:
Oh, really?

 Arcueid:
Uh huh.

 Arcueid:
What are those?

 Shiki:
They are Four-line Red Snappers. Cool, huh?
 And you can usually find them in shallow coral reef areas. In fact, they always swim together in large schools like this one.

 Arcueid:
What's that?

 Shiki:
That's a White-spotted Eagle Ray.
 They dive to the bottom of the ocean so they can find shells and crabs to eat.

 Arcueid:
Hmm. You sure know a lot, don't you?

 Shiki:
Yeah. Ever since I was a kid, I've liked this stuff.

 Arcueid:
Really? Why?

 Shiki:
It's so mysterious, don't you think?
 Because where else can you meet so many different unimaginable creatures.

 Arcueid:
You're right about that.

 Shiki:
But you know what? It's still not as mysterious as meeting a vampire.

 Arcueid:
That goes for me too. I never thought I'd be killed by a human.

 Shiki:
Sorry. Are those wounds still painful?

 Arcueid:
Not so much that. Instead, I think that I changed.

 Shiki:
I don't get it.

 Arcueid:
I'm not sure I even know myself. When you really think about it, we have a mysterious relationship too, don't we?

 Shiki:
Ah...?

 Arcueid:
Well, if things were different and I weren't a vampire.
 Then I wonder what would have happened, I mean between you and me.

 Shiki:
Don't talk about imaginary things.

 Arcueid:
But I like to. I always have.

 Shiki:
Ah...

 Arcueid:
You know? Make believe?

 Arcueid:
Until now, all I knew of the world was what I learned through my own experiences.
 I wake up from my sleep, gather the necessary information. Then go back to sleep, once my mission is completed.

 Shiki:
Say.

 Arcueid:
Yes.

 Shiki:
Can I ask you something? Would you mind telling me more about yourself?

 Arcueid:
So, does that mean you are interested in me?

 Shiki:
Ah... It's just that I... Well, sometimes I wonder.
 I wonder whether or not you're actually a real vampire.
 Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt your feelings?

 Arcueid:
No. But why?

 Shiki:
Because I see you eating hamburgers and stuff like that.
 I always figured the meal for vampires would be more like...

 Arcueid:
I hate blood I already told you.

 Arcueid:
I'm scared. Would you be able to do it, Shiki?
 Something like that.

 Shiki:
Don't talk about imaginary things.

 Arcueid:
Fine. So where shall we go next?

 Shiki:
What?

 Arcueid:
What's next? You should take me to a place where you wanna go.

 Shiki:
Ar... Sure.



Arcueid:
Alright. So where are we headed?

 Shiki:
Let's see. Where should we go?

 Arcueid:
I know. Why don't we go to your school?

 Shiki:
Huh? Ar... No, we can't.

 Arcueid:
Why not? No one's going to be there at this hour.

 Arcueid:
See? What I tell you.

 Shiki:
Hey, Arcueid?

 Arcueid:
Yeah?

 Shiki:
Why did you wanna come to my school anyway?

 Arcueid:
Well, because this is where you spend most of your time everyday, isn't it?

 Shiki:
That's true.

 Arcueid:
I've always been kind of curious about all the things you do when you are here, you know. And how you spend your time?

 Shiki:
Huh?

 Arcueid:
I wanna know what makes you smile and why you cry, what makes you upset.
 This place, it's full of all these memories of yours that I don't know anything about.

 Shiki:
Arcueid, do you mean that.

 Arcueid:
Besides, think what it would be like if I went to school here.
 Just imagine what it would be like if we've existed in the same time.
 Isn't it fun?

 Shiki:
You're always imagining "what if". You like that, don't you?

 Arcueid:
Uhu.

 Arcueid:
What do you do in this room, Shiki?

 Shiki:
I study.

 Arcueid:
You study?

 Shiki:
Yeah. I study things like history or memorize formulas and a periodic table.

 Arcueid:
What's that for?

 Shiki:
Huh?

 Arcueid:
Why do you do that?

 Shiki:
Uh... Well...

 Arcueid:
Don't you know?

 Shiki:
Not really. It may be useless.

 Arcueid:
Then why do it?

 Shiki:
Huh?

 
Arcueid:
One's time here is short enough as it is. So you shouldn't spend it all doing things like these that don't matter.

 Shiki:
I know life is short. But I'm not a machine. I can't only think in terms of efficiency.

 Arcueid:
It's hard to comprehend. How can you take the little time you have and spend it on something that might be useless?

 Shiki:
Is that really so bad? Can't it be all right to be useless?

 Aoko:
You are alive with the power of those eyes, remember that.
 And because you have this power, there is something that you still need to do.

 Shiki:
It's all right. Just to be alive.
 That's how I felt since the accident eight years ago.

 Arcueid:
It's just never been possible for me to think that way.

 Shiki:
Oh, is that so? What about today? Didn't we do useless things?

 Arcueid:
Ah... I'm not so sure. I hadn't really thought of it that way.
 Maybe this is a sign that I'm broken now.

 Shiki:
Huh? Oh, how are you broken?

 Arcueid:
Excess of emotions like joy and pain. This past few days, I've started feeling them a lot.
 So you see? Maybe that means I'm broken. What do you think? Am I wrong?
 Why do I feel so happy right now? For one thing I've never been awake this long before.
 But who knows? Maybe what's happening is I'm already asleep again and just having a selfish dream.
 And when I finally wake up, you'll be gone.

 Shiki:
Hey. What the heck is going on? What's the matter anyway? This isn't like you at all.

 Arcueid:
Ah...

 Shiki:
It's not that easy. You can't just figure yourself out like that.
 I should know.

 Arcueid:
You're kind, aren't you?

 Shiki:
Hey, listen. I've got an idea.

 Arcueid:
What is it?

 Shiki:
Maybe after all this is over, why don't you and I go out on another date?

 Arcueid:
Ah...

 Shiki:
And then we can share one more useless thing.
 We'll give it our best shot. And there'll be no obligations at all.
 It'll just be a meaningless date.

 Arcueid:
It's a promise. Let's go.

 Shiki:
OK.

 Arcueid:
What is this place?

 Shiki:
It's the tea ceremony club room.

 Arcueid:
Tea ceremony? What kind of club is that?

 Shiki:
To put it kind of simply, it's a manner of serving and drinking tea.

 Arcueid:
Do you belong to the tea ceremony club?

 Shiki:
Not really. I'm not a member of any club. But Ciel sempai treats me a cup of tea here every once in a while.
 Is there anything wrong?

 Arcueid:
Ah...

 Shiki:
Ah...
 Hey, wait. I said wait.
 Geez, what's wrong? Why are you like this all of a sudden?
 Why did you take off like that? Was it something I said?

 Arcueid:
It's Ciel.

 Shiki:
Listen, there is no secret to the fact that you don't get along with her.
 But you don't need to get upset just because I mentioned her name.

 Arcueid:
Ciel is a spy for the Church.

 Shiki:
What's the Church?

 Arcueid:
There are group of people who hate the very sight of us.

 Shiki:
Oh, come on. That's ridiculous. What you're saying is impossible. I've known Ciel for a long time.

 Arcueid:
You only think that because they forced you to think it.

 Ciel:
The next thing I suppose you'll say is that you've forgotten all about me.

 Shiki:
But why would they do something like that?

 Arcueid:
They did it because they believed you were the reincarnation of Roa.
 Because you are a member of the Tohno family.

 Shiki:
Why does Ciel want Roa?

 Arcueid:
Because, Ciel was Roa.

 Shiki:
Ciel was Roa?

 Arcueid:
Ciel was a host of Roa. And it all happened a long time ago. She carried out horrible massacres.
 Till one day, I finally brought it into at all and killed her.

 Shiki:
How could you have? Ciel is alive. You've seen her.

 Arcueid:
She can't really die. Because she is not alive.
 Ever since that time, Ciel has continued to go after Roa and never ending effort to atone for her sins.

 Ciel:
I can't allow you to hurt yourself. Indulge me, Tohno. Just let me enjoy being a nosy coed for a little longer.

 Shiki:
Well, now that I really think about it.

 Arcueid:
What is it? Did something happen?

 Shiki:
Yesterday when I was attacked by the strange guy, Ciel just came out of nowhere and saved me.

 Arcueid:
Ciel did that?

 Shiki:
Uh huh.

 Arcueid:
Well if Ciel showed up, then that might mean.

 Shiki:
The strange guy could be Roa?

 Arcueid:
I can't be sure yet.
 If it really was Roa, then I should have sensed him.

 Shiki:
Couldn't it just be that the character of the host is really strong?

 Arcueid:
What did he look like?

 Shiki:
His face was all covered in bandages, and he...
 Uh... Ah...

 Arcueid:
Shiki. What's the matter?

 Shiki:
The strange guy, the same one from yesterday.
 He knows all about me.
Arcueid:
He knows you?

 Dead:
Gyaaaa

Arcueid:
Ah... Shiki. Are you all right? Ah...

 Shiki:
No, not again.

 Arcueid:
No, I will not do it.
 I can't even be thinking of such a thing.

 Shiki:
What Arcueid?

 Arcueid:
Please stay away from me. Please Shiki, do what I say.

 Shiki:
Why? What's the matter? Hey.

 Arcueid:
Haa...

 Shiki:
Ciel sempai.

 Arcueid:
Her again.

 Ciel:
This is your true nature. Do you see now, Arcueid Brunestud?



Arcueid:
The truth about the white princess.
 The exposed scar.
 There is a part of me that is hungry for revenge and it sneers at myself.


 Shiki:
I can't let you do this alone anymore.
