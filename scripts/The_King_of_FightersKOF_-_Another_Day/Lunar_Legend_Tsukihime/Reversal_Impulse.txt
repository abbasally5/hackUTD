Hey... who drew all these graffiti in here?





I really can see them.

Who are you lady?

I am a mage.
 





Please give my regards to my uncle.



Good morning.



Hey, you dog.

Arihiko!



What are you talking about?





She did everything on her own, huh?

I see you two are getting along as usual.

Yumitsuka.



Oh. I made a new resolution not to go out at night.

You always go out. what's up with the sudden change?

That's my sister. She thinks I should cool it for a while.

Why's that?

Come on, you mean you don't know?

What?

It's because of the latest murder.

Latest murder?



It's a Vampire. I'm telling you a Vampire!

It can't be.

I don't know.

Whatever it is, it's got everyone talking about it.

Hmm





Thank you very much.

Tohno?

Ah?

Hi, what are you doing?

O.. oh... well...

Oh yeah you were in there applying for a change of address, weren't you?

Yeah, that's right.



What? Well yeah but how did you know about that?





So, do you wanna have lunch together today?



Why do you have to move all of the sudden?

Well, my father died, and my sister has asked me to come home.

Do you have any other brothers or sisters?

No. Just her.

If that's the case, that makes you the heir to the family, doesn't it Tohno?



Oh. That's very unusual.

Yeah well. Ever since the accident, I've been having problems with my health.

What accident?





It's not a big deal really. I mean it happened eight years ago.

There you are.

Huh?

I've been looking all over for you.



So, have you had enough sneaking around for one day?

I don't know what the heck you're talking about.

Yeah, what are you talking about?

I was just telling Tohno here how pretty you are today.



It's the truth. I'm not just saying that to be nice.

Hey Ciel sempai, remember? The other day we talked about getting together?

We have a day off coming up soon. How's that?

Sounds great!

Have you been thinking about where you wanna go?

Well. How about an amusement park?

Great idea! Let's do it.

Then it's settled. We'll all go together.

This is so weird. I didn't know you two knew Ciel.

What the heck are you talking about?

What?

We all sat right here and had lunch together yesterday.

I've gotta get going.

Now sempai. Don't forget we have a date.

Alright, I'll talk to you later OK?

Come on, Tohno. We gotta get going now.

Oh.



That story bothers you, doesn't it?

Yeah. it gives me the creeps.

Really? Why's that?

I just wonder what kind of a man could do something like that.

I suppose, it could just be a normal person.

Huh?

The kind of person who blends in anywhere and could be sitting next to you looking completely innocent.

Yeah, right.

Huhuhu... Relax, I'm just kidding.

I suppose, it could just be a normal person.



Oh aw...

Ah. Tohno. Are you all right?








Shiki.

Ah?

Here, these are for you. Put them on.





Something I want to protect. Right.

Huh?
 



Akiha!





It's possible. Because I am Akiha.



That's right. This is your room.





Her?

My name is Kohaku, sir.

Hello.

You must try to be more careful about your health.

What?

When I finally found you Master Shiki, you were lying in the park.

Was I alone? Did you see anyone else there?

No you were alone. There was no one except you Master Shiki.

I understand.

Is something bothering you Shiki?

Huh? No I think I'm still a little tired.



Oh.. Thank you.

What was that? a dream?

Start by using the silver on the outside first.

Huh? Thank you. I wasn't sure.

I find it surprising that the Arima Family taught you absolutely nothing about table manners.

They don't live like this. They're just a normal family.



Ah.. no. I didn't mean anything like that.



Yeah.



Come in.





Is there some reason you're not satisfied with me?

Ah..

Can I ask you something?

Yes, sir.

I haven't seen a television here. Haven't you got one?



Huh... I'll go pick up some magazines later.

It's past curfew tonight.





That's ridiculous. I'm not some little schoolboy.



Ah.. No.

If there is nothing else I say good night, sir.

How is my brother?

When last I checked he seemed to have gone to bed.

Um.









That's odd.

What on earth is her.

Master Shiki. Master Shiki.

Ah.



Eh.

Here you are, ma'am.

Thank you, Kohaku.

Good morning, brother.



Excuse me, why are you being so rude?

Just tell me where the paper is.

It's on the table right in front of you.

Would you like to tell us what's going on?

Can you tell me whether or not the police have arrived yet?

The police?

There was an incident, wasn't there?

What do you mean?

Another one of those murders.

Why? Did you see something in the newspaper?

No. There's nothing about it in the paper.

Is it possible you had a dream?





Ah.

Well, well. Look at that.



Have a good day, Master Shiki.

Excuse me?

Yes?



But, Master Shiki is Master Shiki.

Um...

Please be careful out there.

That's all. Just a dream.

I found you.

Good afternoon.
