  Arcueid:
Ah...
Shiki:
Ciel sempai.
Arcueid:
Her again.
Ciel:
This is your true nature. Do you see now, Arcueid Brunestud?
Ciel:

Shiki:
Stop it.
Ciel:
Why do you protect her? Don't you realize that she tried to suck your blood?
Shiki:

Arcueid:
Ah...
Shiki:
It can't be true. It's impossible.
Arcueid:
I'm sorry.
Shiki:
No, wait, Arcueid.
Ciel:

Shiki:
It's a lie.
Ciel:
Everything I've said is true.
Shiki:
How am I supposed to believe anything you say? You used to be Roa.
Ciel:

Shiki:
Huh? Is it true? Then it must be because of me.
Ciel:
She has reached the end of her limits.
Shiki:
It can't be.
Ciel:

Shiki:
What do you mean?
Ciel:

Ciel:
Maybe that created the opposite of that.
Ciel:
Since then, she sealed herself off in her world coming out and living only for atonement.
Shiki:
Atonement?
Ciel:

Arcueid:

Shiki:
Arcueid.
Arcueid:

Shiki:

Akiha:
I found you at last.
Roa:
Sorry, I didn't realize you were looking for me.

Akiha:

Shiki:
Akiha. Akiha. Come on. Just hang in there.
Akiha:
My brother.
Roa:
Did your wound summon you here?
Well, it's been a long time, Shiki.

Shiki:
So it's true. You know who I am.
Roa:
What a heartless man you become.
We used to play together a long time ago, remember?

Shiki:
Then you're... Shiki.



Shiki:
Shiki.
Roa:
Hahaha.

Shiki:
It can't be. I don't believe it.
Roa:
Do you finally remember me, Shiki?

Shiki:
I... you are...
Roa:
What are you talking about?

Shiki:

Roa:
What do you think you're doing?

Akiha:
I won't allow you to lay a finger on my brother.
Roa:
Why are you protecting a [flow]?

Akiha:
I don't care what you say, you're not my brother.
Roa:
What do you mean?
You yourself let me out of that dark underground jail or have you forgotten?

Roa:
Please Akiha. Do something. Help me. Let me out of here, please.

Akiha:
I'm scared, brother.
Akiha:
You killed my father and it was all because of what I did.
Roa:
I am not responsible. Someone orders me to do it saying, "Kill him! Kill him! Go on and kill him!"

Akiha:
You're completely out of your mind.
Roa:
Uh, Akiha!

Shiki:
Stop Roa.
Akiha:
My brother.
Ciel:

Roa:
Damn you to hell. Why do you interfere like this?
You and I are not all that different, you know that.

Ciel:

Shiki:
Sempai.
Roa:
I'm going to let you live for a little while longer.
Enjoy, because I'll definitely kill you next time.
Hahahahahahaha.

Shiki:
Sempai. Sempai. Ah...
Ciel:
Now you know the truth that I've been hiding.
Shiki:
Then, you knew everything, didn't you?
Akiha:
Yes.
Shiki:
I see now.
Akiha:

Shiki:
Akiha.
Akiha:
I'm sorry. I've been deceiving you this entire time.
Shiki:
What's that?
Akiha:

Makihisa:
February 1st. I finally carried out the long awaited plan.
The raid took place after midnight. I nearly destroyed the entire Nanaya village.
I found one survivor. A child. His name is Shiki.
I'm drawn to him because he has the same name as my son.
I've decided to adopt him.
Nanaya was a clan of demon hunters.
I hope this means that the child would be useful in containing the Tohno blood.
Something has happened to my son, Shiki.

Akiha:
Brother.
Makihisa:
He pointed a knife at his sister, Akiha.
Shiki killed my adopted son who happened to be there.

Shiki:
The one who got killed was...
Makihisa:
Shiki had totally lost control of himself.
Therefore, I had no choice but to punish him.
But I couldn't bring myself to kill Shiki.
I concealed the incident but I must face to the fact that my son is no longer a human.
Akiha gave part of her life to my adopted son.
I decided to switch the identities of my two sons.
But I wasn't prepared for what would come of it.

Akiha:
I don't care what you say, you're not my brother.
Roa:
I am not responsible. Someone orders me to do it saying, "Kill him! Kill him! Go on and kill him!"

Aoko:
Someday, when you really want to protect something, you will need that power.
Kohaku:
Mr. Shiki.
Hisui:
Please forgive us.
Shiki:
Take good care of Akiha for me.
Shiki:
I'm glad to see you, Arcueid.
Arcueid:

Shiki:

Arcueid:
At this moment, I still have to fight the urge to suck your blood.
Shiki:
Arcueid, I'm sorry.
Arcueid:
I'll be all right. I've been doing this all by myself up until now.
Shiki:
But now you don't have the power anymore, do you?
Arcueid:

Shiki:

Arcueid:
But...
Shiki:

Arcueid:
A decision?
Shiki:
We should be doing this together, Arcueid.
Shiki:
Am I just in the way?
Arcueid:
Tell me, Shiki.
Shiki:
Yeah?
Arcueid:
You remember the second time you and I met in the park?
Shiki:
Of course. How could I forget that? The person I had just killed was calmly waiting for me with a smile.
Arcueid:
At that time, everything was so different. I hated you very much, you know.
Shiki:
Huh?
Arcueid:

Shiki:
I understand, Arcueid.
Arcueid:

Shiki:
I see.
Arcueid:
If for some reason, you hadn't killed me on that day we met, I wonder things would have turned out differently.
Shiki:

Shiki:
Arcueid.
Arcueid:
Shiki.
Shiki:
Ar...? Huh? Arcueid.



Shiki:

Arcueid:
I'm here because I made a promise.
