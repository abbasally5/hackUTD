  Arcueid:
Ah.. You're finally awake.

Shiki:
Where am I?

Arcueid:


Shiki:
No.

Arcueid:


Shiki:


Arcueid:


Shiki:


Arcueid:


Shiki:


Arcueid:


Shiki:
I see.

Arcueid:
You haven't told me your name.

Shiki:
Shiki. Shiki Tohno.

Arcueid:


Shiki:
Ah.. something to eat?

Arcueid:


Kohaku:
I wonder what happened to Master Shiki.

Akiha:
I'm sure he'll come home soon enough.

Kohaku:
But, it's not like him to spend the night away with a woman.

Akiha:


Kohaku:
Yes. That's true.

Arcueid:
Here you go. Dig in.

Shiki:
This should be easy. But it isn't.

Arcueid:
What is it? Is there something wrong?

Shiki:
Umm.. Yeah, kind of.

Arcueid:


Shiki:
I didn't have anything to do with him attacking you, did I?

Arcueid:


Shiki:
Yeah but...

Arcueid:
Umm?

Shiki:
If I killed you, then why did you save me?

Arcueid:


Shiki:


Arcueid:


Shiki:
I'm not. I'm just an ordinary high school student.

Arcueid:
And yet you killed me.

Kiyono:
A pleasant afternoon to you.
And welcome to the TVS Super News afternoon edition.

Ciel:
Tohno didn't show up at school today, did he?

Arihiko:
That's kind of unusual. It's not like him to just ditch school without telling anyone about it.

Ciel:
I wonder... Do you think he is all right?

Arihiko:
Yes sure. Although you never know with Tohno, he has been acting kind of weird lately.

Ciel:
Ah.. where is Yumitsuka? I thought she was gonna join us.

Arihiko:
Huh... Come to think of it, she hasn't shown up either.

Announcer:
The United States moves closer to a resolution in the Middle East, as they received the two-thirds vote from the house of the representatives approving the diplomatic mission to negotiate for a cease fire.
Neither side has been willing to give an inch,
as two and a half years have past since these two countries were willing to come to the same table to discuss the possibility of peace...

Shiki:
I can see them, but no one believes me.

Aoko:
I see.

Shiki:
And when the lines get broken, the things get broken too.

Aoko:
I see.

Shiki:
I really can see them.

Aoko:


Announcer:
And now we bring you a special report on the incident that took place at the Century Hotel late last night.

Kiyono:
Mistery shrouds the details of the incident where more than one hundred people including hotel employees and guests disappeared suddenly.
So far, none of the missing people have been found.
Police have identified numerous bloodstains on the floors and walls of the hotel.
As well as hair samples believed to belong to some kind of animal.

Arihiko:
What's with the animal hair?

Kiyono:
... connection between the two.

Announcer:
The police have asked us here in station TVS to read the name of the missing hotel guests and employees.
Family member should contact the nearest police station.
Yuji Osawa, Yoichi Mihara, Junko Kodama, Satsuki Yumitsuka, Masaharu Yumitsuka, Yuko Yumitsuka.

Satsuki:


Shiki:
Yumitsuka.

Satsuki:
If I'm ever in trouble again, I know that you'll be the one to rescue me.

Arcueid:
Is something the matter?

Shiki:
She was there.

Arcueid:
Who was there?

Shiki:
A friend of mine was one of the people at the hotel last night.

Arcueid:


Shiki:



Arcueid:
Are you sure about this?

Shiki:


Arcueid:
He's known as a dead apostle.

Shiki:
What's that?

Arcueid:
Vampires are either true ancestors or dead apostles.

Shiki:
What's the difference between them?

Arcueid:


Shiki:
And dead apostles?

Arcueid:


Shiki:
But you're not like that. You don't drink blood, do you?

Arcueid:
I don't need to. Because I'm a true ancestor.

Shiki:
True ancestors are vampires too, aren't they?

Arcueid:


Shiki:
So basically, it's the true ancestors' fault, isn't it?

Arcueid:


Shiki:
I wish I could tell you.

Arcueid:
What is that you trying to hide?

Shiki:
I'm not hiding anything. it's just... I see them.

Arcueid:
What is it that you see?

Shiki:


Arcueid:


Shiki:
Huh?

Arcueid:
I want to see.

Arcueid:
You have mystic eyes of death perception.

Shiki:
Ah?

Arcueid:


Shiki:
Are you saying that I can see death?

Arcueid:


Shiki:
Eyes of death.

Arcueid:
May I look at those please.

Shiki:


Kohaku:


Akiha:
I'll take it, Kohaku.

Kohaku:
Oh... Yes, ma'am.

Akiha:
Hello? I'm his sister. May I ask what this is regarding?

Arihiko:


Akiha:
Again. What is this regarding?

Arihiko:


Akiha:


Arihiko:


Arihiko:
Uh...

Ciel:
I take it Tohno was not there.

Arihiko:


Kohaku:


Arcueid:


Shiki:
I understand.

Arcueid:
Am I allowed to touch this?

Shiki:
I've been carrying that since I was a little kid.

Arcueid:
It's an unusual pattern.

Nero:
Princess of true ancestor, it's nice to see you again.
Something has changed. You're not the same.
I can't feel the power from you now.

Nero:
There are only two possible explanations I can think of for that.
Either those stupid church men have defeated you or my power has now exceeded yours.

Nero:
It's not important. Because the only thing that matters is that I defeat you.
That will put an end to everything.

Shiki:
Ah.. Arcueid!

Nero:
You've been [rested?] a useless human to help you?
Huh, how far have you fallen?
You sicken me. I can't even bear to look at you.

Nero:
Even in your weakened condition, you're still powerful.
You are the executioner the true ancestors sent after all.

Shiki:
Arcueid, behind you! Look out!

Nero:
Huhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhu

Arcueid:
Uh... ah..

Nero:
Now is the time, the great Arcueid Brunestud. I am going to claim your neck.

Shiki:


Nero:
You stupid human. You really think that you could kill me?
What a conceded blood. I think you deserve to die.

Nero:
I am Nero.
Among the squirming and indestructible, the vampires. I'm also known as chaos the immortal.
You are nearly human.
You dare point your blade at me.
That'll cost you your life.
Ah...?

Nero:
Im-... possible...

Arcueid:


Nero:
Ahhhhhhhh

Shiki:
Hah...

Arcueid:


Shiki:
Of course I'm not all right.

Arcueid:
You humans are so very fragile.

Shiki:
I'm certainly not like you.

Arcueid:



Arcueid:


Shiki:
I have always worried about Akiha.
