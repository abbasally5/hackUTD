Honoka: Hey! That's me. Honoka Kousaka and, I'm a 2nd year at Otonokizaka High. And it's gonna major (bind?) right now. You see... It was started yesterday. When out of nowhere, the school board director announced our impending closure. Huh... no way.

Kotori: What's ( ) mean?

Umi: The notice says that affect next year. Our school will be closing.

Honoka: A...aaahhh...

Umi: Honoka!

Kotori: Are you okay?

Honoka: My high... my career...

Umi: What's wrong? Are you okay?

Kotori: Honokaaa!

Honoka: My high's more career is. It's all gonna go away.


<OP>


Honoka: Eh! Oh no... Oh I was only dreaming. Hi! Morning! Hello! Hi! Good morning ladies. It's not ( ) today.

Hideko: Looks like, she lasts the weirdest time.

Humiko: Been cheerful. Isn't it unusual for her right?

Mika: I don't think she gets a really.

Honoka: How so you mean? Of course, it was a dream. There's absolutely no ( ) It decided to close the... Noooo!!!!

Classmate girl: Hey, Honoka. Are you feeling any better now?

Honoka: It wasn't a dream. Our school is really gonna close.

Kotori: Oh Honoka... Guess she is taking pretty hard. I didn't realize how much she loved here.

Umi: That's not it. I don't think she really understands what's going on.

Kotori: But she is so depressed.

Honoka: What am I gonna do? I haven't been studying at all. If Otonokizaka closes, that means I gotta go somewhere else. I have to go taking an enter exam.

Umi: Good grief!

Kotori: Honoka calm down.

Honoka: You get to be calm. You two will be fine. You already got a grade. But I'm doomed.

Umi: ( ) stop! You're not doomed. The school will close until after we graduate.

Honoka: What?

Kotori: Whenever the school closes, it can't be until after all the current students graduate. So we have at least 3 years.

Honoka: I don't ( ) for that. And now I can enjoy my delicious bread,

Umi: You're going to gain weight.

Kotori: Although if they do make a decision official, we won't meet 1st year students next year. Only 2nd and 3rd years will be here.

Umi: So the current 1st years will never have under class on their own.

Honoka: You're right.

Eli: Hey. You have a second?

Honoka: Yes, we do. Hey who is that?

Umi: The student council president.

Eli: Ms. Minami.

Kotori: Yes?

Eli: If I'm not mistaken, you are the school board director's daughter.

Kotori: Yes, I am.

Eli: So then, did you see anything?

Kotori: No, I only just found out today too.

Eli: Well. thank you then.

Nozomi: Bye.

Honoka: Hey, wait. Is it true? Our school's really closing down?

Eli: It's not something you need to be worrying about.

Honoka: ( ) notice said the school is closing cause we didn't get enough applications from perspective students right? So that means the school won't close if more students would just apply.
So we gotta show off the positive aspects of our school and we will ( ) bunch of applicants.

Umi: Positive aspects? Such as...hmm...

Honoka: We have our histories.

Umi: Ah-huh. What else?

Honoka: What else? Uh...ah...rich traditions.

Umi: That's the same thing.

Honoka: Really? Then, um...then...Kotori help!

Kotori: Ahh...I think maybe you can say that our school has been around for a while?

Umi: Kotori, did you even hear a word we said?

Kotori: Not really, but I did some research. I learned some needs stuff about club activities.

Honoka: Like what?

Kotori: Well, nothing all that's special but pretty interesting anyway. Like this example here. Take a look at most recent prominent club awards. Abacus club. 6th the country region.

Honoka: Yeah, 6th place huh...

Kotori: Choir. Honorable mention at ( )

Umi: Huh...please tell me those more on the list.
