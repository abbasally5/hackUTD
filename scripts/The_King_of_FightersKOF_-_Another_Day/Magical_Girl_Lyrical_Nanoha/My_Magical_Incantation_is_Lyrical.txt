Nanoha:
I'm Nanoha Takamachi, and I was supposed to be an ordinary third grader.
But something happened that changed everything.
I was given a little red gem. And with it, I also got these magical powers.
This coincidence is [what are] the two things in motion: my confusion and the beginning of the story.
I have a feeling it's gonna start getting intense from here on in.
This is the story of how magic changed my ordinary life.
The story of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha is about to start.

Nanoha:
Wh-what's going on? What's happening?

Nanoha:
My Magical Incantation is Lyrical?

Nanoha:
Huh? Where did this come from?

Yuno:
Look out!

Raising Heart:
Protection.

Nanoha:
Wh-what's?

Yuno:
Our powers happen because of magical equations called programs that are embedded into the jewel.
The jewel needs to be able to tap into the spell caster's energy.
It's what gives us the ability to use our magic powers.
That thing back there is a thought entity created by some horrible power.
You can stop it by casting a sealing spell with the staff.
Then it'll turn back into what it was.

Nanoha:
I don't understand any of it. What should I do?

Yuno:
The same thing you did earlier, basic movements such as attacking and defending will happen just by wishing for them. 
But, if you wanna use more powerful magic to stop it, you gonna have to use a spell.

Nanoha:
A spell?

Yuno:
All you have to do, is open your heart. Listen to your heart, and a spell should come to mind.

Raising Heart:
Protection.

Nanoha:
Lyrical Magical!

Yuno:
The thing you need to seal with your spell is called... the Jewel Seed.

Nanoha:
Sealing the Jewel Seed, please.

Raising Heart:
Sealing mode, set up. Standby, ready.

Nanoha:
Lyrical Magical! Jewel Seed, serial twenty one. Seal!

Raising Heart:
Sealing.

Yuno:
That is a Jewel Seed. Touch it with the Raising Heart.

Raising Heart:
Receipt number twenty one.

Nanoha:
So that's it? It's all over now?

Yuno:
Yes. Thanks to you, it's over. Thank you.

Nanoha:
Hey, what's wrong? Are you okay? Hey, wake up!
Oh no. This isn't good. Maybe it would be a good idea if we didn't stick around.
Hey, we gotta get going. I'm really sorry about the mess!

Yuno:
I'm sorry.

Nanoha:
Oh, did I wake you up? I hope I wasn't too rough. Are your wounds still hurting?

Yuno:
No, they're fine actually. In fact, they're almost completely healed.

Nanoha:
Wow, you're right. Your wounds have pretty much disappeared. Amazing...

Yuno:
Because you came to help, I could use the magic I have left to heal myself.

Nanoha:
I don't know but I think I'm starting to understand. Hey, how about I introduce myself?

Yuno:
Sure. All right.

Nanoha:
Ahem, I'm Nanoha Takamachi. And I'm in the third grade.
And my family and friends all call me Nanoha. So you can call me that, too!

Yuno:
My name is Yuno Scrya. Scrya is the name of my clan. But you can call me Yuno.

Nanoha:
Yuno, huh? I think that's a cute name.

Yuno:
Mm-hm... I'm so sorry, Miss Nanoha. 

Nanoha:
Just Nanoha.

Yuno:
I'm really sorry I got you involved in all of this.

Nanoha:
Oh no, you don't... I'm okay, really I am!
Oh, that's right. You're still hurt so maybe this isn't the best place for you. Let's go back to my house.
We'll think about what to do after you've had the chance to heal, okay?

Kyoya:
Welcome back.

Nanoha:
Oh, hey there big brother.

Kyoya:
It's really late, kid. Where did you wander off to?

Nanoha:
Umm... well... I... I am...

Miyuki:
Oh, it's so cute.

Nanoha:
Oh, Sis, you're up, too?

Miyuki:
He doesn't seem too happy though, does he? Were you worried about him or something, Nanoha? Is that why you snuck out like that?

Nanoha:
Well... umm...

Kyoya:
Hang on, Miyuki. I know where we're going with this, but she can't just leave like that without telling anyone.

Miyuki:
Come on, it's all right. Look, she did make it back safe and sound, didn't she?
Besides, Nanoha's a good girl, so she won't ever do this again, right?

Nanoha:
Well... umm... Kyoya, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to make you worry about me.

Kyoya:
Fine.

Miyuki:
Great. We're a happy family again.
Wow, this little guy's cute. In fact, he's so darn cute.
I bet you anything that Mom's gonna flip out when she sees him.

Kyoya:
I won't argue with you then, Miyuki.

Nanoha:
Hi Yuno, good morning.

Yuno:
Ah, good morning.

Nanoha:
By the way, I'm really impressed [that] how you handled yourself last night.

Yuno:
Oh well, the same could be said of you.

Nanoha:
So, last night, when I showed Yuno to Mom and Dad.

Momoko:
Oh, it's so cute! This is just too adorable.

Nanoha:
Mom, be careful!

Shiro:
Huh, I've got to say this is a rather wise-looking weasel.

Miyuki:
It's not a weasel, it's a ferret.

Shiro:
I wonder if this thing knows any [treats/tricks]. Here boy, shake!

Momoko, Shiro:
Oh!

Momoko:
Oh my, the little cutie is so intelligent!

Nanoha:
Well, that got the family in a frenzy of cuteness, and afterwards, we ended up trying to figure out the food situation for Yuno.
So, I didn't get to talk to him much last night.
Hey, you used to calling me by my name yet?

Yuno:
Mm-hm, Nanoha.

Nanoha:
That's pretty much of the conversation we got to have. But, at least he knows my name now and he's talking to me like a friend.
Okay Yuno, sorry I can't stay, but I have to go to school now. When I get back, I want to know all about you, okay?

Yuno:
Oh, that's all right. Just because we're not together doesn't mean we can't talk to each other.

Nanoha:
What?

Yuno:
That's right, Nanoha. You're a mage now.

Nanoha:
Oh, it's like when you were calling for me to come to you.

Yuno:
Right. All you have to do is keep the Raising Heart with you. Then you can talk to me from within.

Nanoha:
Let's see now... like this?

Yuno:
Right! Isn't it easy?

Nanoha:
Ah! It is easy!

Yuno:
Hurry to school now and I'll talk to you later. I'll tell you all about me, about magic, and about the Jewel Seeds.

Nanoha:
Sure.

Nanoha:
Lyrical Nanoha!

Nanoha:
Good morning!

Arisa:
Nanoha, did you hear what happened last night?

Nanoha:
What? Something happened?

Suzuka:
I heard that a car smashed through the veterinary clinic we took the ferret to yesterday.
It drove right through a wall and tore it down.

Arisa:
I'm worried about that little ferret. I hope he is okay.

Suzuka:
Yeah.

Nanoha:
Ah! Yeah, him... ah, you see guys, ah...

Arisa:
Oh, I'm glad he's safe at your place now.

Suzuka:
Yeah, but what a coincidence, Nanoha?
You know, you were super lucky that you found him in the street after he escaped the clinic.

Nanoha:
I'm not lying. I just certified the truth a bit, just a tiny bit.

Arisa&Suzuka:
Huh?

Nanoha:
Oh yeah, and it looks like the ferret didn't belong to anyone either.
We got to keep him and take care of him now. For a while anyway.

Suzuka:
Hey, that's great, Nanoha.

Arisa:
We have to come up with a name for it. You got any in mind?

Nanoha:
Yeah, I decided to call him Yuno.

Arisa:
Yuno?

Nanoha:
Yeah, Yuno.

Arisa&Suzuka:
Oh!

Teacher:
Earlier we learned that kanji is made up of two parts: the foundation and the annex.
By combining these parts, a kanji character can have all sorts of different meanings.
A foundation has its own meaning, and the annex too has its own meaning.
Examples are foundations, or the ninben, which stands for a human.
The sanzui will represent water, and kihen which stands for a tree.
Now, here's a little quiz: what is the annex that fits perfectly with all three of these foundations?

Yuno:
Where I come from, the Jewel Seeds are considered ancient treasures.
They're magic stones that grant the wishes of whoever holds them.
But their power is very unstable. On their own they sometimes go out of control like the one last night.
They destroy everything when they search for a user.
And if someone or something finds them and misuses their power, the stones can turn on them and go berserk.

Nanoha:
Why are dangerous things like that running around my neighborhood?

Yuno:
Hum... It's all my fault. Back where I come from, I'm what you call an archaeologist.
I was on a dig one day and I found something inside a monument.
I sent it off to a team of researchers and asked them to study it.
But the time-space transport that was carrying it had some sort of accident and was destroyed.
And now, twenty one Jewel Seeds have been scattered all over this world.
So far, I've only been able to find two of them.

Nanoha:
Nineteen more to go...

Student:
Stand.

Teacher:
Okay class, I notice that your balsam trees have really grown.
About how tall have they gotten?

Students:
Two centimeters.

No! Three centimeters.

Nanoha:
Wait. Hold on a second, Yuno. You said there was an accident, right?
That's why the Jewel Seeds got scattered. If it was an accident, then it's not really your fault.

Yuno:
But, I was the one who found them in the first place.
Now it's my responsibility to find them and take them back where they belong.

Nanoha:
I guess I think I know how you feel. Well, at least I understand why you're coming from.
You really take things to heart, don't you Yuno?

Yuno:
What?

Teacher:
Oh, that reminds me. Did you all remember to put "Do not touch" signs on your plants?
You wouldn't want someone to come along and pull them out, thinking they were weeds, right?
Oh, and don't forget to write your name and the date that you planted the seed on the sign.

Yuno:
Look. I... I wanna apologize for getting you involved in this. If you hadn't saved me last night...
From here on, I just need some time to rest, and so my powers have returned to their full strength.
Maybe a week, no, five days should be enough. So until then... if I could just...

Nanoha:
What'll you do when your powers come back?

Yuno:
I'll continue searching for the Jewel Seeds alone.

Nanoha:
I can't let you do that.

Yuno:
Wh... what do you mean you can't?

Nanoha:
I won't be able to help you out while I'm at school or during prep school, but after that I can definitely help you.

Yuno:
But you'll be putting yourself in danger just like last night.

Nanoha:
Now that I've gotten to know you and heard your story, I can't let you go by yourself.
I mean, look, if things like that monster start showing up in my neighborhood, that would be trouble for everyone, right?
And another thing, you are all alone, Yuno. You don't have anyone to help you.
It's gotta be lonely all by yourself. So, let me help you, okay?
"The way I see it, if someone needs your help and you have a power to help them out, there shouldn't be a doubt as to what you should do. "
That's something my dad taught me.
You're in trouble, Yuno. But you don't have to do this alone. I can help you with my powers.

Yuno:
Yeah.

Nanoha:
I don't know if I [already] become a real mage. But with your help, I'm sure I'll get the hang of it.
Bye!

Yuno:
But you're already a mage, Nanoha. Actually, I think you have more talent for it than I do.

Nanoha:
R-really? I'm not so sure about that. But please teach me everything you can.
Now walk...

Arisa:
Okay. Bye-bye.

Nanoha:
Bye.
I'll do my best. I promise!

Yuno:
I know. Thank you.

Nanoha:
Just a little bit farther and I'm almost home.
Hey, I was thinking, do you wanna have some snacks when I get back?

Yuno:
Oh, sure. Thanks.

Nanoha:
I wonder what today's snack's gonna be.
Oh, I'm sorry. Yuno, what was that thing?

Yuno:
Another Jewel Seed's been activated. It's really close.

Nanoha:
What should I do?

Yuno:
We should go over there together. Please help me.

Nanoha:
Mm-hm.

Yuno:
Nanoha! The Raising Heart!

Nanoha:
Oh, right.

Yuno:
Look! It's already possessed an animal.

Nanoha:
Wh-what's gonna happen?

Yuno:
Now that it has a body, it'll be harder to fight.

Nanoha:
It'll be okay, I think.

Yuno:
Nanoha! Activate the Raising Heart!

Nanoha:
Huh? Wait, how do I do that again?

Yuno:
Huh?

Nanoha:
Uh! He's coming!

Yuno:
Recite the passwords, say, "I am the one who has been given a mission."

Nanoha:
A what? Wait! What did you say? It's way too long to remember!

Yuno:
Just stay call, repeat after me.

Nanoha:

All right, Raising Heart.

Raising Heart:
Standby ready, set up.

Yuno:
Oh, she activated the Raising Heart without a password! Nanoha! Activate your armor.

Raising Heart:
Barrier Jacket.

Yuno:
Nanoha!

Raising Heart:
Protect condition: all green.

Yuno:
That attack didn't even scratch her. I knew it, the girl is incredibly talented.

Nanoha:
Okay. Guess it didn't hurt as much as I thought it would.
Let's see... I guess I'm supposed to do that sealing thing now.
Okay, Raising Heart, if you would.

Raising Heart:
All right. Sealing mode, set up. Standby ready.

Nanoha:
Lyrical Magical! Jewel Seed, serial sixteen! Seal!

Raising Heart:
Sealing. Receipt number sixteen.

Nanoha:
Huh... So was that good enough, Yuno?

Yuno:
Yes. It couldn't have gone any better than that.

Woman:
What happens? Did I trip and hit my head or something?

Nanoha:
Good job today, I guess.

Yuno:
Yeah, I think so, too.

Nanoha:
The very first day that I, Nanoha Takamachi, became a mage, is finally coming to an end.
And it's sure been a long day. I guess I don't know too much about my new friend, Yuno yet, or about magic, or about anything else that may be coming along.
Yeah, there's a lot of stuff I don't know...
Hey you know what, Yuno? I'm feeling kinda hugnry...
But for now, I think I'm just gonna have to do my best!

Nanoha:
Okay, so now that I, Nanoha Takamachi, have become a mage or a magical girl or a magician.
Whatever I am now, I've got my work cut out for me. In fact, my problems are just beginning,
Next [xxx] something so big, it involves the whole city? Oh, Jeez!
On the next episode of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, it's episode three: The Town's in a Lot of Danger?
Lyrical Magical, I'll do my best!
