Nanoha:
I'm Nanoha Takamachi, and I was supposed to be a normal third grader.
But something happened that changed all that.
I was given a jewel called the Raising Heart, and just like that, I got these magic powers.
Confusing emotions and words that don't connect.
Is fighting the only way to figure all this out? Should I keep fighting?
The story of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha is about to start!

Nanoha:
I'm pretty sure all started with a coincidence.
But if you get a whole bunch of coincidences happening at once, the best you can do is pick one now and follow that path.
Anyway, that's what I've done. In the end, I think that's pretty much how everyone lives their lives.
My new life started with the coincidence. And I wanna keep going.
I wanna believe I made the right choice, as I made it with my own free will, and with my own feelings.

Nanoha:
This is a Town of Hot Water, Uminari Hot Springs!

Nanoha:
Finally, it's the vacation season in Japan! Everyone's taking a break.
Cafe Midoriya's always open, but during vacation time, we pack up and go on a little trip.
And while we're gone, the cafe stays open thanks for our wonderful employees.
This time, we take the road with all of my friends.
Guess what, my big brother and his girlfriend, Shinobu Tsukimura are coming.
The two maids in the Tsukimura house are also coming along. This'll be fun!
We are not going too far from home, but for two nights, we'll get to go soaking in some hot springs.
When we want to relax in vacation, this is pretty much what my family does.

Arisa:
Look, it's so green!

Suzuka:
Isn't it? It's just like the garden back in my house.

Yuno:
Nanoha. Come on, it's a vacation, you're supposed to be relaxing now.

Nanoha:
I know that. I'm okay.
I've been thinking a lot about that mage in black that I met. And the Jewel Seeds, too.
I haven't found any since that night.
I guess I've been thinking about that stuff too much, so Yuno had an idea.
He told me I should go take some time off [in middle] and just rest.

Suzuka:
It's so big!

Nanoha:
For the next two days, I decided I'm gonna act just like any other third grader on vacation would.
And I'm gonna play and have as much fun as I can!

Women:
Oh, sorry.

It's okay.

Shall we go?

Nanoha:
Hey Yuno, have you ever soaked in a hot spring before?

Yuno:
Ah... I-I've been to a public bath before but a...

Nanoha:
A hot spring soak is the best.

Yuno:
Oh, really?

Miyuki:
Stop it!
Got ya!

Yuno:
N-Nanoha, I think I'll just...
Ahhh!

Nanoha:
Why, stay here? Let's take a bath together.

Arisa:
This is fantastic!

Suzuka:
Oh wow! It's so huge!

Shinobu:
This is so amazing.

Miyuki:
I can't wait to get in!

Nanoha:
Oh wow!

Suzuka:
Hey Sis, why don't you let me scrub your back?
I won't scratch you.

Shinobu:
Sure, Suzuka. Thanks.

Nanoha:
I can scrub yours, Miyuki.

Miyuki:
Thank you.

Arisa:
You know what that means, that means I get to give you a bath. Sounds like fun, doesn't it?
Hey, stop struggling. You know, I'm really good at washing things.

Momoko:
Oh, vacations like this are wonderful.

Shiro:
Yeah, they are...

Momoko:
Things are good. Our cafe is in good hands with our employees.

Shiro:
And our kids, huh, they're full of energy.

Momoko:
That they are, and so are you.

Shiro:
You know, I guess I am.
It took a long time, didn't it?

Momoko:
Mm-hm...

Shiro:
Well, one thing's for sure, you and the kids don't have to worry about me anymore.
From now on, I'll just stick to being the owner of Midoriya, I promise.

Momoko:
I know. Thank you, honey.

Noel:
Here you are.

Kyoya:
Thanks, Noel. Aren't you supposed to be on vacation? You shouldn't be working. You should be relaxing.

Noel:
Right. That's what I'm doing right now, I'm relaxing.

Nanoha:
Hey Sis, Shinobu, we're gonna find something else to do. We'll see you later, okay?

Miyuki:
Okay, bye.

Suzuka:
Is it okay if I go with Nanoha and Arisa? They want to go exploring around the inn.

Shinobu:
Sure. Just make sure you stay out of trouble.

Arisa:
Well, looks like you're coming with me, Yuno.

Suzuka:
But really [sounds / so] good.

Arisa:
Yeah.

Suzuka:
Now that we washed off the sweat, how about we go play some ping-pong?

Nanoha:
What? Ping-pong?

Arisa:
Oh, I wanted to see what souvenirs they had in the gift shop.

Nanoha:
Umm... I'm not so good at ping-pong.

Arisa:
What should we do? Where shall we go first?

Suzuka:
How about we play rock-paper-scissors to decide?

Nanoha:
Good idea.

Alf:
Hey kitties. Having fun? Are you the one who did the you-know-what to my girl?

Nanoha:
Umm... what...

Alf:
That's funny because you don't really look all that smart or strong.
If you ask me, you look just like any other kid, don't you?

Arisa:
Nanoha, do you know this lady?

Nanoha:
Ah, no...

Arisa:
You hear that? She said she doesn't know you. So who are you and what do you want?

Alf:
Oh? Ahahahaha...
Sorry, I'm sorry. Looks like I've got the wrong person.
I thought you were someone else, you look just like her.

Nanoha:
Oh, okay. It was all just a misunderstanding then.

Alf:
Aha. Wow, that is such a cute ferret!

Nanoha:
Yeah, isn't he?

Alf:
Hi fuzzy. Scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch...
This is my way of saying hello. Well, I've got your attention. Here's a warning.
Good kids behave and play at home. But bad little girls get bitten. You got that?
Now, I think I'll go take another bath.

Yuno:
Nanoha.

Nanoha:
Yeah.

Suzuka:
Are you okay?

Nanoha:
Yeah, I'm fine.

Arisa:
Hmm! What nerve! Who was that?

Nanoha:
No one, just some really weird person?

Arisa:
Looking around all drunk in the middle of the day! How tacky! That creepy woman!

Suzuka:
Arisa.

Nanoha:
Hold on, Arisa. This is the place where all kinds of people go to relax. She's just relaxing.

Arisa:
Just because you're on vacation doesn't mean you [really] your modesty at the door.

Alf:
Ah... hello, Fate. Alf calling.
I bumped into that girl in white, you know her.

Fate:
Really? How was she? 

Alf:
Hmm... well, she's not much to look at. She's no match for you, Fate.

Fate:
I see. I've been busy, too. I think I've found the location of the next Jewel Seed.

Alf:
Oh?

Fate:
I think we'll be able to capture it tonight.

Alf:
Oh! Nice going, Fate. I wouldn't expect anything less from my master.

Fate:
Yeah, thanks Alf. Let's meet up again tonight.

Alf:
All right. Huh...
Time to get in a little relaxing.
These darn ears...

Alf:
Oh no!

Miyuki:
Hmm... Do you think they'll like it?

Farin:
Happily ever after, the end.

Momoko:
How was [store time / story time], Farin? Have the kids all gone to sleep already?

Farin:
Yes, Miss Takamachi. They're sound asleep.

Momoko:
You didn't have to, thank you, Farin.

Farin:
Not at all, ma'am. I did it 'cause I love hanging out with them.

Nanoha:
Yuno, are you awake?

Yuno:
Yeah.

Nanoha:
Do you think that woman has something to do with the girl in black?

Yuno:
Probably.

Nanoha:
Does that mean she's gonna show up again, like last time?

Yuno:
Most likely...
Nanoha, I've been thinking about it a lot... 
Well, after all that's happened, I really think I should just...

Nanoha:
Stop it! I'll just get mad if you finish that sentence. You wanted to tell me that you're gonna do this alone.
You don't want to get me into any more trouble because of you. That's what you were going to say, right?

Yuno:
Yeah...

Nanoha:
Listen, Yuno. When we started this Jewel Seed collecting thing, I was just helping you out.
But it's different now. I'm doing this because I want to do it, not because I have to.
I'll get mad at you if you leave me behind and try to do this alone, so you can't, okay?

Yuno:
Yeah.

Nanoha:
Come on. Let's get some sleep. You never know, there might be something going on again tonight.

Yuno:
Okay.

Alf:
Bingo, Fate. I think I found it. Hello, Fate?

Yuno:
Nanoha!

Nanoha:
I know, Yuno. It's okay. Let's hurry! Raising Heart, please activate!

Raising Heart:
Standby ready, set up.

Alf:
Oh wow! This one sure looks amazing! So is this what you call the power of the Lost Logia?

Fate:
Yes, it is. Although it's extremely unstable and its power is incomplete.

Alf:
So why does your mom want these things anyway? Not that I'm complaining.

Fate:
Who knows? She never told me, and to be honest, it doesn't really matter.
My mother wants them and if she wants them, I need to get them for her.
Bardiche, wake up!

Bardiche:
Yes, sir.
Sealing form, set up.

Fate:
I'm going to seal it now. Let's go, Alf, we got work to do.

Alf:
You got it.

Nanoha:
Uh! Is that...

Fate:
This makes two...

Alf:
My, my, my, my...
Didn't you understand what I told you about kids' behaving.

Yuno:
Wait a minute! That's a Jewel Seed! Those things are dangerous!
What do you people want with it?

Alf:
Huh, who knows? Besides, ferret, I don't have to tell you anything.
I warned you, I thought I was being nice with our chat.
You remember the part about getting bitten if you didn't behave?

Yuno:
I knew something was off about her, she is the girl's familiar!

Nanoha:
Familiar?

Alf:
The ferret's right. I happen to be a magical being she created.
She gave me life, I live to serve her, to protect her. I'll use all my power if I have to.
You can go home, if you want. I'll be along shortly.

Fate:
Well, okay. But be careful.

Alf:
Okay!

Yuno:
Nanoha! Go after the girl!

Alf:
Do you really think I'd let that happen?

Yuno:
I'll make sure it happens!

Alf:
Oh no... Transportation magic?!

Fate:
A barrier, and a force transfer spell. You have a good familiar.

Nanoha:
You're wrong. Yuno isn't my familiar, he's more than that. He's a really good friend of mine, you got that?

Fate:
Well, what are you going to do?

Nanoha:
Don't you think we can maybe talk about this, instead of fighting?

Fate:
Very well. Let's talk. I have to collect the short of Lost Logia, the Jewel Seeds.
We have the same goal, so we're enemies. 
And the only way for either of us to get what we want is to fight, with the Jewel Seeds as the prize.

Nanoha:
You're kidding me! Look, before we do any fighting around here, I think we really need to talk.
Someone could get hurt if we start jumping to conclusions.

Fate:
Talking won't change anything. At this point, I seriously doubt that words will help.
Talking is over!

Raising Heart:
Flier Fin.

Nanoha:
Stop it! Listen to me!

Fate:
No, you listen. Let's make a bet and whoever wins, gets a Jewel Seed.

Bardiche:
Photon Lancer, get set.

Alf:
Stop running away! You can't escape!

Yuno:
What's a mage who's powerful enough to create familiars doing here?
What does she know about the Jewel Seeds, about the Lost Logia?
Tell me!

Alf:
Shut up, ferret!

Bardiche:
Thunder Smasher.

Raising Heart:
Divine Buster.

Nanoha:
Okay, Raising Heart. When you're ready, please!

Raising Heart:
All right.

Yuno:
Nanoha is so powerful...

Alf:
But she's holding back.

Bardiche:
Scythe Slash.

Yuno:
Nanoha!

Raising Heart:
Pull out.

Nanoha:
Raising Heart, what are you doing?! No, stop!

Fate:
It cares very much about its master.
Let's go home, Alf.

Alf:
That's my master, the best mage ever. I'll be seeing ya, kiddo.

Nanoha:
Wait!

Fate:
If you can help it, try to stay far away from us.
If we meet again, I might not be able to stop myself in time.

Nanoha:
What's your name? At least tell me your name!

Fate:
I'm called Fate. My name is Fate Testarossa.

Nanoha:
Fate... 
My name is...

Alf:
Bye bye.

Arisa:
I think Nanoha is hiding something from us.

Suzuka:
But what can we do? Sometimes there're things you can't even tell your best friends.

Yuno:
Things that happened in the past are slowly being revealed.
What would be the fate of the two magical girls when they meet again?

Nanoha:
Next time on Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, it's episode six: Feelings That Can't Be Understood?
Lyrical Magical, I hope I can reach her.
