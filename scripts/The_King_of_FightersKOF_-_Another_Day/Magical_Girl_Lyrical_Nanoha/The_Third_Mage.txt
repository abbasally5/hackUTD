Nanoha:
I'm Nanoha Takamachi, and I was supposed to be an ordinary third grader.
But something happened to me that changed everything.
I was given a jewel called the Raising Heart and with it, I got these magical powers.
Whatever our difference is, however we felt, it all disappeared inside a big bright light.
Is the path I'm stumbling down the right one? [Every] times when I won't know. And that much, I do know.
But I'm pretty sure that wherever my feet are taking me right now, that's where I'm gonna find my destiny.
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha is about to begin.

Alf:
Fate!

Yuno:
Nanoha!

Fate:
Are you okay? Come back, Bardiche. I need you.

Bardiche:
Yes, sir.

Alf:
Fate!
Fate! Don't! It's dangerous!

Fate:
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

Alf:
Fate!

Yuno:
Normally, the Raising Heart is a device that can tolerate huge amounts of energy.
But for one attack to cause this much damage... 
Maybe that girl and Nanoha's powers were so strong that... 
No.
That isn't enough to explain all of this. The only other thing that could, would be the Jewel Seed.

Nanoha:
Yuno, is Raising Heart all right?

Yuno:
It'll be fine. There was a lot of damage to it, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be okay.
Right now, it's running auto repair function at full speed, so I think it'll be back up by tomorrow.
How about you, are you okay?

Nanoha:
Yeah. All because Raising Heart protected me. I'm so sorry, Raising Heart.

Alf:
I'm so sorry, Fate. I'm almost done, okay?

Fate:
No, I'm okay. Thanks for patching me up, Alf. I have to go back home tomorrow and give my Mom a status report.
I hope I can heal by then. I don't want her to worry about me, but she will if she sees me like this.

Alf:
You really think she'd be worried? I mean it's her.

Fate:
Mom's a little, awkward, you know. That's all. She loves me. I know that she does.

Alf:
Well, if it's only a report, how about I go instead, and you can rest up a bit?

Fate:
I'm sorry, Alf. But you know how Mom is, she doesn't really listen to you.
Thank you for offering though. You're a good, kind girl, Alf.

Alf:
Well, I'm sure you'll be fine tomorrow. I mean you found a Lost Logia pretty quick.
And you did get four of those Jewel Seeds, so...
I'd be surprised if you got scolded.
I'll bet she's got nothing but praise for you.

Fate:
Yeah. You're right, Alf.

Miyuki:
Nanoha! You're up early?

Nanoha:
Yeah, kind of...

Miyuki:
Why are you up so early? Is something wrong?

Nanoha:
Yeah, well... I just kind of woke up so...

Miyuki:
Oh.

Nanoha:
Hey Sis, Is Kyoya up yet?

Miyuki:
Oh, yeah. He and Dad are off on one of their long distance runs today.

Nanoha:
Umm... well, I was sort of wondering, but it'd be all right if I watched your practice?

Miyuki:
It's not gonna be very interesting, but if you want to.
I wouldn't mind the company.

Nanoha:
Thanks, Miyuki.

Yuno:
Nanoha?

Nanoha:
Yuno.

Yuno:
What's wrong? You're up so early today.

Nanoha:
Oh yeah. Well, I just kind of woke up, that's all.
So anyway, Yuno. I've been doing a lot of thinking...

Yuuno:
Oh?

Nanoha:
Yeah. I've been thinking a lot of about that girl, Fate.
Actually, I can't stop thinking about her.

Yuno:
Why is that?

Nanoha:
She seems really strong and appears cold-hearted, but she's got the prettiest, most gentle eyes I've ever seen.
I get the feeling that she's really sad, you know. Anyway, that's what I think.

Yuno:
Hmm...

Nanoha:
I'm sure she's got a good reason for collecting the Jewel Seeds. That's probably why she's sad.
I guess that's why, I want to talk to her. Thing is, though, how am I going to do it!

Fate:
I'm bringing along some souvenirs.

Alf:
Is that a box of sweets? I wonder if there's anything that can make that woman happy.
Oh, well.

Fate:
You never know, but it's the thought that counts. Isn't that right?

Alf:
Uh-huh.

Fate:
Dimensional teleportation. Dimensional coordinates are as follows: 876C-4419-3312-D699-3583-A1460-779-F3125.
Open up, Door of Invitation. Open to the Garden of Time, to the House of Testarossa!

Lindy:
How's everyone today? Are we still on course?

Crew:
Yes. Currently we are cruising steadily at level three speed.
And we should be arriving at the destination dimension in about a hundred and sixty vecsas.

We haven't picked up any new activity, ma'am. At least since that small dimensional tremor.
However, the threat of two seekers creating that kind of instability's still very high.

Lindy:
Hmm... well.

Amy:
Excuse me, Captain Lindy. Your tea's ready.

Lindy:
Thank you very much, Amy.
Indeed, even if it's small, the fact that a dimensional tremor has occurred would be rather troublesome.
If it happens again, you'd best get to the site as fast as you can, okay Chrono?

Chrono:
You don't have to worry. I understand, Captain Lindy.
After all, that's the whole reason why I'm here.

Precia:
Only four? Horrible. I expected more from you.

Fate:
You're right. I'm sorry, Mother.

Precia:
Look here, Fate. You are my daughter. The one and only daughter of the great mage, Precia Testarossa.
And for us, nothing is impossible. And I mean nothing, so with that in mind, you will finish the task at hand.

Fate:
Yes, Mom.

Precia:
You make me wait all this time, and when you finally come, you bring me so little.
Do you want a sleeping for a second that your mother would welcome you with a smile for that?
You understand me, don't you?

Fate:
Yes, I understand.

Precia:
I hope so. I really do. I want you to remember. So you'll never disappoint your mother again, ever.

Alf:
What is this? I don't know what all this does! She's horrible... that woman!
That horrid [wretch], that rotten and wicked abnormal woman, but this isn't the first time she's been clawed to Fate.
I can't stand this anymore! She's taking it too far this time. And those things, those, Lost Logia so Jewel Seeds or whatever they are! 
Are they really that important?

Precia:
The Lost Logias are absolutely essential to me, to everything I've dreamed about. Do you understand?

Fate:
Yes, Mother.

Precia:
The Jewel Seeds, they are more pure and so much more important than any other substance imaginable.
Your kindess is your greatest flaw. Because of it, you hesitate instead of fortune ahead.
But if anything gets in your way, you will crash it no matter what the cost.
Because my daughter, you have the power to do so.
Go now. Bring them to me. My daughter, my cute little Fate.

Fate:
Yes. I'll go right away, Mother.

Precia:
Time for my nap. Then next time you return, I hope that you won't disappoint me, Fate.

Fate:
Yes...

Alf:
Fate! I'm so sorry, Fate. Are you all right?

Fate:
You don't have to apologize to me, Alf. I'm just fine, really I am.

Alf:
But, this is wrong, Fate. And I should have known better.
You brought her the thing she wanted, didn't you? I never thought she'd do something this cruel to you.
If I'd known, I definitely would have stopped you.

Fate:
She isn't being cruel, Alf. My mother is just, she's only thinking about what's best for me.

Alf:
No, she isn't, Fate! No way! That woman's taking her anger on you!

Fate:
It's not like that. Besides, we're family. And we need each other. 
The Jewel Seeds or something that's really important to her.
Mom's been so sad for so long. All I wanna do is find some way to make her happy again. So don't blame her.

Alf:
But, but still...

Fate:
Please Alf, it's all right. Everything is okay. Really.
I'll just come back home with the rest of the Jewel Seeds.
I'm sure that I'll make her happy again, you'll see.
She'll go back to being this sweet and kind Mom she used to be.
She'll be nice to you, too.
So don't worry about it anymore.
Let's go. And this time, we're not going to fail.

Nanoha:
So how did you do on the last test? I didn't do so well.

Fate:
Well, Bardiche. Better?

Bardiche:
Recovery complete.

Fate:
Good. I'm happy to hear it. You're the best.

Alf:
You can feel it. Even I can sense it.

Fate:
I know. There is one that's about to execute. It's really close.

Nanoha:
Raising Heart, you are all better now? I'm so glad.

Raising Heart:
Condition green.

Nanoha:
Well then, ready to get some more Jewel Seeds?

Raising Heart:
All right, my master.

Nanoha:
Thank you.

Yuno:
Time sealing barrier, activate!

Alf:
Argh, putting up barriers. This one's got guts!

Fate:
Indeed. And this one's stronger than the others. Look sharp, that girl is here.

Nanoha:
Get out of there, Yuno!

Raising Heart:
Flier Fin.

Nanoha:
Raising Heart, please fly, high as you can!

Raising Heart:
All right.

Fate:
Arc Saber. Bardiche, come on, let's do this.

Bardiche:
Arc Saber.

Raising Heart:
Shooting mode.

Nanoha:
Let's go, Raising Heart!
Get ready to fire! Divine...!

Raising Heart:
Buster.

Fate:
Lightning, pierce it now!

Bardiche:
Thunder Smasher.

Raising Heart:
Sealing mode, set up.

Bardiche:
Sealing form, set up.

Nanoha:
Jewel Seed, serial seven!

Fate:
Seal it!
Hold on a second. We can't put so much stress on the Jewel Seed.

Nanoha:
Yeah. If something like last night happened again, I'd feel sorry for my Raising Heart, and I'd feel bad if anything happen to your Bardiche, Fate.

Fate:
All right. But I won't yield.

Bardiche:
Device form.

Nanoha:
Wait a minute. All I wanna do is talk to you for a bit, Fate.

Raising Heart:
Device mode.

Nanoha:
I have an idea though. I'm not some spoiled kid, so if you wanna fight, let's fight.
But if I win, will you talk to me?

Chrono:
Stop it now! A battle here is just way too dangerous to allow.
I'm with the Time-Space Administration, Enforcer Chrono Harlaown.
I want you to tell me what this is all about!

Nanoha:
Now that Chrono, the third mage is here, it looks like the truth about the Jewel Seeds will be revealed.
I have a feeling the story's about to get interesting.
And you won't believe it when I tell you, but I just felt something surprising at about Yuno! He's, well he's...!
On the next episode of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, it's episode eight: There's a Really Big Crisis?
Lyrical Magical, I'll do my best!
