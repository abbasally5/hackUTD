Nanoha:
I'm Nanoha Takamachi, and I was supposed to be an ordinary third grader.
But something happened to me that changed everything.
I was given a jewel called the Raising Heart and with it, I got these magic powers.
If you have a broken heart, if your wishes don't come true, don't ever forget the kindness that's been around you.
Someone's always been there for you. And now there's someone else who is waiting for you to smile.
With an honest heart, make a little wish.
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha is about to begin.

Crewman 1:
It's a big one! The magnitude of the dimensional tremor is growing!

Crewman 2:
If this thing gets any bigger, we're gonna have about thirty minutes before it tears a hole in this dimension!
And if that happens, we're doomed!

Amy:
Those reactors Precia's got power in the Garden are the same type of Lost Logias as the Jewel Seeds!
That's what's causing the tremor! She knew they'd become unstable, but she activated them anyway!

Lindy:
Precia always knew this was gonna be a one-way trip.

Nanoha:
Chrono, where are you going?

Chrono:
I'm heading for the site. She won't get away from me.

Nanoha:
I'm going with you.

Yuno:
Me, too.

Chrono:
Okay then.

Yuno:
Do you mind staying here with Fate, Miss Alf?

Alf:
No. I'll stay.

Chrono:
Let's go!

Nanoha:
Right!

Yuno:
Yeah!

Lindy:
Everyone! Now stay sharp, and be careful!
I'll meet the three of you at the site. Your mission is to arrest Precia Testarossa, understood?

Nanoha, Yuno, Chrono:
Roger!

Nanoha:
The Time of the Sealing of Our Fate.

Yuno:
There's tons of them here...

Chrono:
This is only the entrance. There's lots more in the inside.

Nanoha:
Hey Chrono, are there people in those things?

Chrono:
They're machines, programmed to attack anything that gets in their way.

Nanoha:
Good. Then we don't have to hurt anyone.

Chrono:
Don't waste your energy on these things. Let me handle them.

S2U:
Stinger Snipe.

Nanoha:
Oh, so quick!

Chrono:
Come on, Snipe Shot!

S2U:
Break Impulse.

Chrono:
Don't you stand up staring, let's get going!

Nanoha, Yuno:
Okay!

Chrono:
Watch out for those black splotches, they're holes!
They're called Imaginary Planes! They're spaces where magical powers can't be used!
Flying magic won't work either! And if you fall, gravity will pull you straight down!
You won't be able to get out of it!

Nanoha:
Right. I'll be careful.

Chrono:
Okay, we're gonna split up now. The two of you, get to the top floor and seal the reactor!

Nanoha:
Will you be okay?

Chrono:
Yeah. I'm gonna try to find Precia. That's my job, it's what I do.
I'll clear a path for you. Are you ready?

Nanoha:
Yeah.

S2U:
Blaze Cannon.

Nanoha:
Hey Chrono, be careful, okay?

Lindy:
I'm heading down to the site. Try to keep that dimensional tremor from expanding and set up a distortion field in the Garden for me.

Alf:
I'm getting really worried about those kids down there.
I'm gonna go and see if I can help them out for a little bit, okay?
Don't worry, I'll be back in a jiffy. Just hang in there, Fate, 'cause it's almost over.
I don't care how long it takes, just get back to being the Fate I used to know, the Fate I love more than anything else.
Just hang in there for a little while longer, 'cause when this is done, you'll be free to do whatever you want to, okay?

Fate:
All this time, Mother never smiled at me, not once. I just wanted her to accept me. That's all I lived for.
No matter how much she told me I was useless, no matter what horrible thing she did to me, I just wanted her to smile at me. That's all.
And even now that she's thrown me away, I'm still hanging on to her.
Alf... you're the only one who stood by me.
I know I made you sad... because I didn't listen when you were trying to warn me.
And that girl in white... who I fought with all those times. She's the first person whoever looked me straight in the eye and treated me as an equal.
We've met lots of times and fought. And that girl, she always called me by my name... over, and over.
All I wanted was for Mother to accept me. That's the one thing I lived for. I didn't need anything else, I didn't want anything else, ever.
I talked myself into thinking I couldn't live without her love.
But I can't just forget about it. And I can't keep running away from the truth, either, can I?
For me... for us, life hasn't even begun yet, has it?
Isn't that right, Bardiche? Maybe... maybe my life hasn't even begun yet?

Bardiche:
Get set.

Fate:
You've been here all along. Through it all you've been right here by my side the whole time, haven't you Bardiche, haven't you?
You don't want it to end like this, either. Am I right, Bardiche?

Bardiche:
Yes, sir.

Fate:
I'm not sure if I can do this right or not, but let's give it a try.

Bardiche:
Recovery.

Fate:
We have the future ahead of us. And we havenâ€™t even begun to live yet.
Okay. Now I know what I have to do, so that I can finally start living,
I'm done with the past, for good!

Alf:
Damn it! There's so many of them!

Nanoha:
It'd be nice if this is all of them incoming!

Yuno:
I've gotta figure out a different plan!
Nanoha!

Nanoha:
Ah!

Yuno:
Nanoha!

Bardiche:
Thunder Rage.
Get set.

Fate:
Thunder Rage!

Alf:
Fate!?

Fate:
The big ones are tough. They have the stronger shields.

Nanoha:
Okay. But what about that thing on its back?

Fate:
Maybe if we attack together...

Nanoha:
Mm-hm, Mm-hm, Mm-hm!

Fate:
Let's go, Bardiche!

Bardiche:
Get set.

Nanoha:
Us, too! Okay, Raising Heart!

Raising Heart:
Standby ready.

Fate:
Thunder... Smasher!

Nanoha:
Divine... Buster!

Nanoha, Fate:
Here we go!

Precia:
They are coming now. It doesn't matter though, because they're too late. Right, Alicia?
Oh Alicia... my sweet child...

Nanoha:
We did it, Fate!

Alf:
Fate! Fate! Fate, you're okay!
Oh...

Fate:
Hello, Alf. I'm sorry if I made you worry, but things are going to be different now, I promise.
Once I finish things here, I can start living a better life.

Precia:
Just a little bit more, that's all...

Fate:
You can make it up to the reactor room if you take that elevator.

Nanoha:
Mm, okay. What are you gonna do, Fate? Are you gonna go after your mother now?

Fate:
Yeah.

Nanoha:
I... umm... I wanna tell you something. I wish you luck.

Fate:
Thank you...

Yuno:
Chrono set out for the Garden by himself! There's no time, we gotta hurry!

Alf:
Ready for this.

Chrono:
Amy!

Amy:
Nanoha and Yuno have made it. They're at the reactor. And Fate and Alf are headed to the bottom floor.
Looking good. This just might work.

Chrono:
Good.

Yuno:
No, I'll cover you, Nanoha. Just worry about getting that reactor sealed, okay?

Nanoha:
Just like we always do it, right?

Yuno:
Huh?

Nanoha:
You've always been there for me and kept me safe no matter what.
That's the reason why I can do this.

Raising Heart:
Sealing mode.

Nanoha:
That's the reason why I know I can do this. Because I know you've got my back, Yuno.
Let's do this! Divine Shooter Full Power! Shoot!

Lindy:
Precia Testarossa. This is the end. I've got a hold on that little dimensional tremor you've created.
You'll be happy to know that we've almost got the reactor sealed. And there's an Enforcer heading right for you.
You've caused so much pain. And for what? The lost capital of Alhazerd and the secret spell that lie within just a myth.

Precia:
You're mistaken. The path to Alhazerd lies in the gap between dimensions.
When time and space are shattered, when a dimensional rift is caused, the doorway will be revealed.
They will take us straight to Alhazerd!

Lindy:
You've gambled an awful lot on some old legend.
What do you expect to do once you get there, Precia?
Do you think you'll get back what you've lost or erase all the mistakes you've made?

Precia:
Yes... I'm going to get Alicia back! I'm going to change what was and create a brand new future for me and Alicia!
I'll bring everything back... This wasn't how it was supposed to be, not like this!

Chrono:
Nothing's ever the way it's supposed to be! How dare you think you can undo what cannot be undone!
It's been that way since the beginning, for always and for everyone, you included!
You can choose whether or not you want to run away from reality, or you can face it head-on like everyone else who's ever suffered!
What makes you any different, you don't have the right! No one has the right to drag innocent people down into their self-destructive depression!

Fate:
Mother!

Precia:
What did you come here for? Go away... I don't have any use for you anymore.

Fate:
I only came here because I wanted to say something to you.
Listen to me. I-I am not Alicia Testarossa. I know I'm just a doll you created.
Listen, Mother. Hear me out. I'm Fate Testarossa, your daughter.
You gave me life and you raised me. No matter what you say, I'm still your daughter!

Precia:
You little fool. Did you really believe I think of you as my daughter after this?

Fate:
If you wished it, I'd do anything for you. All you'd have to do is ask. If you wished, I'd protect you from anyone who do you harm.
I would protect you from anything that would cause you pain.
I'd do this, not because I'm your daughter. I would do it, because you're my mother!

Precia:
How stupid...

Chrono:
Watch out!

Lindy:
Oh!

Amy:
Captain Lindy, be careful! The Garden's crumbling! You have to get out!
She can't close the dimensional rift anymore. Nanoha sealed the reactor.
Chrono, get everyone out there right now! The entire area's about to collapse!

Chrono:
Roger that! Fate Testarossa! Fate!

Precia:
Nothing can stop me now! I'm going to Alhazerd! I'm going to get everything back!
My past, my future and the only thing that ever made me happy!

Fate:
Mother!

Alf:
Fate, no!

Precia:
We'll go together, Alicia...
This time, we'll never, ever be apart again...

Alf:
Fate!

Amy:
Hurry, everyone! Get out of there while you still can!

Nanoha:
The story's finally come to an end. So I guess now's the time everyone says their goodbyes.
But you know, every ending is the beginning of something new. And that's a good thing, isn't it?
On the next episode of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, it's the last episode: Call My Name.
Lyrical Magical, I'll see you again, right?
