Nanoha:
My name is Nanoha Takamachi. I'm supposed to be an ordinary third grader.
But something happened to me that changed everything.
I was given a jewel called the Raising Heart and just like that I had magical powers.
So are these magical things happening because of coincidence, or is it destiny?
At this point, I have no idea... Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha is about to start!

Fate:
The Lost Logias are here, aren't they?
They've taken the form of blue gems, I believe they're called Jewel Seeds.
Right. I'll have them all in no time.

Nanoha:
A Rival!? Another Magical Girl!

Miyuki:
Come on Yuno. Come on boy, over here.
Yeah. Good boy. You're such a smart ferret, Yuno. Hm?

Kyoya:
Hey Nanoha, are you ready?

Nanoha:
Oh, sorry! Just another sec, okay?

Miyuki:
Hey, are you guys going out somewhere today?

Kyoya:
Yeah. Over to the Tsukimura's house. I guess Suzuka invited Nanoha to come over today for tea or something.

Miyuki:
Oh, okay. Hm. Bet you're going over 'cause you wanna hang out with Shinobu, right?

Kyoya:
Well, I guess since I'm going over there anyway, yeah.

Nanoha:
Okay, I'm ready.

Kyoya:
It's about time. We'd better hurry. The bus won't wait.

Nanoha:
All right. Yuno, come on!

Miyuki:
Have fun and be careful!

Kyoya:
Yep.

Nanoha:
See you later, Sis.

Ah...
Me and Kyoya are going over to Suzuka's house for a tea party.
I really like it when I get to spend a day with Arisa and Suzuka.
And Kyoya's looking forward to it, as he's gonna see Suzuka's older sister Shinobu.

Nothing. Really I swear.

Kyoya:
Yeah, right.

Noel:
Lord Kyoya, and Lady Nanoha, it's good to see you.

Kyoya:
Yeah. Thanks for inviting us over today.

Nanoha:
Hi, Noel.

That's Noel, the head maid of the Tsukimura family.
She doesn't talk much, but she's so beautiful and super cool!

Noel:
Please come in, and make yourselves at home.

Suzuka:
Oh, hi Nanoha, hi Kyoya.

Nanoha:
Hi Suzuka.

Farin:
Hello, Nanoha. How've you been?

Nanoha:
This is Farin. She's Suzuka's personal maid. She's one of the nicest, kindest people I know.

Shinobu:
Kyoya, I'm so glad to see you.

Kyoya:
Yeah...

Nanoha:
My brother and Shinobu met in high school and have been classmates ever since.
I think they like each other... a lot.

Noel:
I'll go make some more tea for everyone. Would you like anything in particular?

Kyoya:
I'll leave it to you.

Noel:
And how about you, Lady Nanoha?

Nanoha:
I'll like anything you make, Noel.

Noel:
As you wish, ma'am. Oh, Farin.

Farin:
Got it. I'll help you get things ready, my sister.

Shinobu:
Umm... we'll be upstairs in my room, okay Noel?

Noel:
Fine. I'll bring it up when it's ready.

Arisa:
Morning, Nanoha.

Suzuka:
Have a great today.

Nanoha:
Good morning. Good morning, Suzuka.

Arisa:
Your sister and her brother is so lovey-dovey.
"We'll be up in my room", I can't believe she said that.

Suzuka:
Yeah. Ever since she got to know Kyoya, she's been happier than I've ever seen her. I think it's great.

Nanoha:
I wonder if Kyoya's happy. He sure looks it.
Anyway, compared to how he was before, I guess he's got in a teeny bit nicer.

Arisa:
Oh really?

Nanoha:
I think he laughs a lot more now.

Arisa:
Good.

Nanoha:
Before I forget, thanks for inviting me and Kyoya over, Suzuka.

Suzuka:
Hm-hm. Don't be silly. You're always welcome. Thank you for stopping by today.

Arisa:
So how are you? You look cheerful today.

Suzuka:
What she means is, for a while now, you seem like you've been kinda down in the dumps.
If you're worried about something, you know you can tell us.
I mean that is what friends are for, right? We're here for you if you need to talk.

Nanoha:
Oh, Suzuka... and Arisa...
Ah, hey Yuno, wait!

Suzuka:
No, Ai, don't!

Farin:
Sorry. This took longer than I thought. I brought you a pot of strawberry milk tea and cream cheese cookies.

Suzuka:
Farin! Look out!

Nanoha:
No!
And safe...

Farin:
Oh no, Suzuka, Nanoha, I'm so sorry!

Shinobu:
She's at it again.

Noel:
That girl is so troublesome.

Arisa:
Amazing. With all these cats running around, it's like cat heaven here.

Nanoha:
I'll say, the kittens are super cute though.

Suzuka:
Yeah. But I'll have to say goodbye to a few of them soon. We found a hope for some of them.

Nanoha:
I see. It'll be kinda lonely.

Suzuka:
Oh well, I'm just happy that the kittens are going to grow up around people that will love them.

Arisa:
Hmm... That’s true.

Nanoha:
Ah!

Yuno:
Nanoha!

Nanoha:
I know. It's really close.

Yuno:
Well.

Nanoha:
Umm...

Yuno:
Got it.

Nanoha:
Yuno, come back!

Arisa:
Uh-oh. Is there something wrong with him?

Nanoha:
No, he probably saw something. I-I'll go find him, he can't have gone far.

Suzuka:
Want us to help you look?

Nanoha:
No, it's okay. Wait here and I'll be back in a bit, I promise.
It's activated!

Yuno:
We'll be seen here. I have to create a barrier.

Nanoha:
What's that?

Yuno:
You were standing in one the night we met.
It stalls the flow of time in normal space, so that we can use our magic without being noticed.
Don't worry. I'm pretty good at it.
I [can't] cut out the space that's too large. But if it's only the house and these woods, I can do it.

Nanoha:
That's a... Is that the...

Yuno:
Umm... most likely, I think that's what I would call a properly granted wish.
The kitten wanted to be bigger and boy, is it big now!

Nanoha:
Yeah, really big...

Yuno:
Come on, then. We still have to change it back before it becomes dangerous.

Nanoha:
Right, yeah that's right. If Suzuka sees it like this, I'm pretty sure she's gonna be freaked out.
It doesn't look like it's gonna attack us. I should hurry up with that sealing spell.
Hey, Raising Heart...

Fate:
All right, Bardiche. Attack it with the Photon Lancer.

Bardiche:
Photon Lancer Full Auto Fire.

Yuno:
What!? Magical light!? Can't be...

Nanoha:
Raising Heart, help me please.

Raising Heart:
Standby ready, set up.
Flier Fin.
Wide Area Protection.

Fate:
Hm? She's a mage?

Yuno:
She's taken to a new power so quickly. Nanoha's skill is amazing. Maybe there's nothing more I can teach her.

Fate:
A mage like me. One that is seeking the Lost Logias?

Yuno:
No doubt about it. She comes from the world that I came from.
And she knows the truth, the truth about the Jewel Seeds!

Fate:
An intelligent device like my Bardiche.

Nanoha:
Bardiche?

Fate:
Lost Logia... Jewel Seed.

Bardiche:
Scythe form, set up.

Fate:
I'm sorry, but I'll be taking this one with me.

Raising Heart:
Evasion. Flier Fin.

Bardiche:
Arc Saber.

Raising Heart:
Protection.

Yuno:
Nanoha!

Nanoha:
Why? Why are you attacking me?

Fate:
You wouldn't understand.... even if I told you.

Bardiche:
Device mode.

Raising Heart:
Shooting mode.
Devine Buster, standby.

Bardiche:
Photon Lancer, get set.

Nanoha:
I'm pretty sure this girl's the same age as me. She's got pretty eyes and pretty hair.
But who is she? Where did she come from?

Fate:
I'm sorry.

Bardiche:
Fire.

Yuno:
Nanoha!

Bardiche:
Sealing form, set up.

Fate:
Capture it.

Bardiche:
Order?

Fate:
All right, Bardiche. Lost Logia Jewel Seed, serial fourteen, seal it.

Bardiche:
Yes, sir.
Sealing.
Captured.

Nanoha:
When I woke up, it was already dusk. The blue sky had changed color to a gentle orange.
Somehow, Yuno got my brother and everyone else to come get me.
I sort of told a lie. I told them I tripped and hit my head while I was looking for Yuno.
It wasn't a big lie though. I bet everyone worried about me a lot before they found me.
I felt so bad. I didn't want that.

Yuno:
That staff, that armor, and the way she used magic.
I think, no, I'm positive that she comes from the same world as I do.

Nanoha:
Yeah... But when I am out collecting Jewel Seeds, I wonder if I'll... if I'll meet her again.
For some reason I wasn't scared about that. But it made me a little sad.
I had a lot of confusing feelings rolling around in me.

Fate:
Yes, I did have a little trouble getting it. Nothing I couldn't handle though.
I got the Jewel Seed, serial fourteen. Who was that girl? I wonder how many of them she has.
It's all right. I won't lose my way. Wait for me, Mom. I promise, I'll be home soon.

Nanoha:
It doesn’t matter if you're a student or if you got a job, everyone needs to take a break some time.
So guess where we are, at a local resort called Uminari Hot Springs.
How great, right when we start relaxing, somebody's causing trouble.
And I really wanna know what that mysterious magical girl in black wants.
Next time on Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, it's episode five: This is a Town of Hot Water, Uminari Hot Springs!
Lyrical Magical, I'll do my best!
