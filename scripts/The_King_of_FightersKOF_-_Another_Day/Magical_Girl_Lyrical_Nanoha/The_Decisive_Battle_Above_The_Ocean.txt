Nanoha:
I'm Nanoha Takamachi, and I was supposed to be an ordinary third grader.
But something happened to me that changed everything.
I was given a jewel called the Raising Heart and with it, I got these magical powers.
Our meetings are all stormy. And for some reason, we can't seem to express our true feelings.
But I still feel like I wanna share all my hopes and fears with you.
And more than anything else, I want you to know something. It's that I've never met anyone like you, ever.
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha is about to begin.

Lindy:
Okay. Listen up, everyone. Starting today, everyone on the crew has a new mission:
To search out and retrieve the Lost Logia, otherwise known as the Jewel Seeds. 
We'll be needing some extra help in this, so we've enlisted the person who discovered the Lost Logia.
He's a mage skilled in the use of barriers.

Yuno:
Hello, my name is Yuno Scrya.

Lindy:
And working with him, is a mage from the world where the Jewel Seeds are located.

Nanoha:
Hi, my name is Nanoha Takamachi.

Lindy:
These two are to be treated as members of the crew until the mission has been completed.

Nanoha, Yuno:
Nice to meet you all.

Nanoha:
The Decisive Battle Above The Ocean.

Lindy:
We'll be able to find the exact locations of the Jewel Seeds from this control room.
When we find one, the two of you will go down to the site.

Nanoha, Yuno:
Right.

Amy:
Captain, here's your tea.

Lindy:
Oh, thank you.
By the way, Miss Nanoha. Are you okay to stay with us for a while?

Nanoha:
Oh yeah. I came up with an excuse and told my family and friends.

Teacher:
Okay, everyone. Due to family circumstances, Miss Takamachi will not be coming to class for a few days.
Now, before everyone starts worrying about her, she's okay.
She's not sick or hurt. She's just taking a couple of days off.
While Miss Takamachi is out, could someone take notes for her and collect any handouts?

Arisa:
Yes, I'll do it!

Teacher:
Okay, Miss Arisa, I'm counting on you.

Arisa:
Sure!

Teacher:
All right, class. Let's begin today's homeroom, shall we?

Student:
Rise!
Bow!
Be seated.

Yuno:
Hey Nanoha, I trapped it!

Raising Heart:
Sealing mode, set up.
Standby ready.

Nanoha:
Lyrical Magical, Jewel Seed serial eight, seal!

Raising Heart:
Sealing.
Receipt number eight.

Crew:
Situation has been settled. Jewel Seed number eight has been captured and secured.
Excellent job, Nanoha, and you too, Yuno.

Nanoha:
Thank you!

Crew:
I'll make you gate. You just wait there.

Lindy:
Oh, those two are amazing, aren't they? Maybe they'll agree to stay after this is done.

Amy:
So this girl in black. You said that her name is Fate?

Chrono:
Fate Testarossa. She has the same family name as a great mage from long ago.

Amy:
Really? What happened?

Chrono:
The story goes back many years ago. A powerful mage used to live in the city of Central Midchilda.
During a magical experiment, the mage created dimensional interference and she was banished for it.

Amy:
You think Fate is related to her?

Chrono:
Who knows? It might not even be her real name.

Amy:
No good. I can't seem to find out Fate'd go anywhere.
She must be using an extremely sophisticated barrier to cloak her location as well.

Chrono:
Her familiar... I'll bet she's the one supporting her.

Amy:
If that's true, then no wonder they were able to steal two of the Jewel Seeds we found so easily.

Chrono:
They are out there somewhere, so keep on searching. All of us are counting on you, Amy.

Amy:
I'm on it.

Nanoha:
It's been a while since we've seen Fate.

Yuno:
Yeah. But she's still out there somewhere looking for the Jewel Seeds, that's for sure.

Nanoha:
Hmm...

Alf:
Fate, it's no good. This isn't working.

Fate:
Yeah.

Alf:
We can't search for the Jewel Seeds and hide from the Bureau at the same time. It's slowing us down.

Fate:
I know, but we have to try.

Nanoha:
It's been ten days since Yuno and I came aboard the Arthra.
Since then, we've been able to get three Jewel Seeds, serial numbers eight, nine, and twelve.
Fate and her familiar have been busy, too. They found Jewel Seeds serial numbers two and five.

Yuno:
There're six more of them to go.

Lindy:
Six Jewel Seeds, huh? I wonder where they could be hiding.

Chrono:
We'd expanded the search area to cover both land and sea. It's possible that Jewel Seeds may have sunk into the ocean.
Amy's scanning for them and she's also keeping an eye out for that girl in black.

Lindy:
I see.

Nanoha:
Guess we didn't find any today.

Yuno:
Yeah. Looks like it's going to take a long time to find all of them. I'm really sorry about all this.

Nanoha:
Huh?

Yuno:
Aren't you lonely?

Nanoha:
Not really. I'm not lonely at all. I mean, I'm here with you.
Besides, I'm used to being by myself. I was alone most of the time when I was little.
Back then, my dad was in a bad accident at work. And for a while there, he couldn't even get out of bed.
We were all worried about him and were scared he wouldn't make it.
He had just opened up the cafe, too. It wasn't enough help behind the counter.
My mom and my brother had to work long hours to keep the place open.
And my sister stayed with Dad at the hospital all the time.
I've been alone at the house pretty much this whole time. Well, up until a little while ago, anyway.
I guess that's why I am kinda used to it.

Yuno:
I see.

Nanoha:
Hey, you know what? You never told me anything about your family, Yuno. What are they like?

Yuno:
Oh well, I've been on my own since I was born.

Nanoha:
You don't have a family?

Yuno:
I didn't have parents like you do. Actually everyone in the clan took care of me.
So I guess you can say that everybody in the Scrya clan is my family.

Nanoha:
Oh, I see.
Yuno, when everything's taken care of, I'd really like to talk to you some more about stuff, okay?

Yuno:
Okay. Let's talk some more then.

Nanoha:
When everything's taken care of, when the Jewel Seeds problem is solved. Yeah, I'm sure that we...

Crew:
Emergency! A large magical event has been spotted above the ocean within the search area.

Amy:
What do those kids think they're doing!?

Fate:
Arukas, Krutas, Eygias... Swift thunder and glimmering lightning, strike at the spot where I command.
Paruel, Zaruel, Browzel...

Alf:
The Jewel Seeds are under the ocean... She's going to unleash the stream of electrical magic into the sea and activate the Seeds to locate them.
That's not a mistake, but... Fate!

Fate:
Lightning stabs, thunder roars, Arukas, Krutas, Eygias!
There they are! The last six!

Alf:
To use this much magic and then try sealing them all at once.
Even though Fate's magic is strong, I don't think she can handle it on her own.

Fate:
Alf, I need you to set up a barrier and support me!

Alf:
Yeah! Right away, Fate.
No matter who shows up, no matter what happens, I'll protect her with my life!

Fate:
Let's do our best, okay Bardiche?

Lindy:
I can't believe she'd be so reckless with her magic!

Chrono:
Unbelievable. She's bound to destroy herself doing that.
She's going way beyond her limits by using that much magical power.

Nanoha:
Fate! I'm here! I'm ready to go to the site!

Chrono:
There's no need for that now. We'll leave her alone till she burns herself out.
Even if she manages to survive, we can take her out when [once] she's used up all her magical power.

Nanoha:
But...

Chrono:
Get ready to capture the Jewel Seeds.

Crew:
Roger.

Alf:
Fate! Fate! Ah!

Lindy:
We must always try to make the best choice depending on the situation at hand.
Our methods may seem cruel, however, it's all we can do.

Nanoha:
Yeah, but...

Yuno:
Go! Nanoha, go! I'll open the gate. Go on and get her.

Nanoha:
But Yuno, the reason I want to go to Fate, well, it's not your problem. I don't wanna get you in trouble.

Yuno:
Whether it's my problem or not, if you need my help, I'll always be there to help you, okay?
Just like how you were there when I needed you, Nanoha.

Chrono:
What are you doing!?

Nanoha:
I'm really sorry, but, I'm going to disobey orders and go get that girl before she kills herself.

Yuno:
I'm transporting you into her barrier.

Nanoha:
Let's go, Raising Heart.
Winds to the sky, stars to the heavens, a bright shining light into these arms, and the unyielding soul to this heart!
Raising Heart, set up!

Raising Heart:
Standby, ready.

Alf:
Don't get in Fate's way!

Yuno:
Hold it right there! We're not here to fight with you, we're here to help her!

Nanoha:
Yuno?

Chrono:
Are you insane? What do you think you're doing!?

Nanoha:
I'm really really sorry about disobeying your orders. But I can't leave her alone like this!
She's all by herself out here. And I know what it's like being alone! I understand what she's feeling!

Yuno:
We have to stop the Jewel Seeds first, or we're going to be in a lot of trouble!
Let's help them out, so that they can finish sealing the Jewel Seeds!

Nanoha:
Let's hurry, Fate!
Come on, you and I can stop the Jewel Seeds together!

Bardiche:
Power charge.

Raising Heart:
Supply complete.

Nanoha:
We can do it if you and I each take three.
Yuno and Alf are holding on to tight for us. Now's our chance, Fate!
When I say ready, we'll seal them in one shot!

Raising Heart:
Shooting mode.

Nanoha:
Whenever I was all by myself and feeling lonely, I didn't want anyone to ask me if I was all right, or act nice to me, ether. I wanted something else.

Bardiche:
Sealing form, set up.

Fate:
Bardiche?

Nanoha:
Divine Buster Full Power... You can do it, right?

Raising Heart:
All right, my master.

Nanoha:
All right, ready!

Fate:
Thunder...

Nanoha:
Divine...

Fate:
Rage!

Nanoha:
Buster!

Amy:
All six of the remaining Jewel Seeds have been sealed away, Captain.

Chrono:
That's so irresponsible!

Lindy:
It was amazing though...

Nanoha:
Someone to share my feelings. Someone with whom I can split the loneliness and sadness in half.
That's it. Now I understand what I want. I want to share my feelings with this girl.
All I want, is to be friends.

Amy:
We're being attacked! We have a dimensional interference caused by a magical attack headed straight for the ship!
Six seconds the impact!

Fate:
It's my mother!

Nanoha:
What's happening!?

Alf:
Get away!
Where's the other three?

Lindy:
We've got to retreat, capture them now!

Crew:
It's no good! The lightning strikes stopped the ××× from functioning!

Twenty five seconds until all functions are restored. We can't keep up with them!

Lindy:
Let's activate the anti-magic barrier. Start preparing for another attack.

Crew:
Right!

Lindy:
Also, let's get Nanoha, Yuno and Chrono back aboard the ship.

Nanoha:
Everything is now coming to a head.

Yuno:
As everyone gathers their strengths and preparation for the final storm.

Nanoha:
And I get to tell Fate how I really feel, too.
On the next episode of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, it's episode ten: Everybody's Separate Heartfelt Vows.
Lyrical Magical, the beginning of the real me.
