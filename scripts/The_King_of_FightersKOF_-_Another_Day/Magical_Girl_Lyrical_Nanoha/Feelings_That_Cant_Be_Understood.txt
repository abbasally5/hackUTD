Nanoha:
I'm Nanoha Takamachi, and I was supposed to be an ordinary third grader.
But something happened to me that changed everything.
I was given a jewel called the Raising Heart and with it, I got these magic powers.
The stronger my beliefs became, the stronger unyielding wishes became as well.
But I don't wanna give up our communicating, because I don't want to end up without understanding of anything.
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha is about to begin.

Nanoha:
I've been thinking for all this time, thinking about that girl.
The girl who, I'm sure, is close to me in age, and had deep, pretty eyes. 
I'm sure that we'll have another clash if we see each other again.
But still...

Nanoha:
Feelings That Can't Be Understood?

Arisa:
Enough is enough! You've been so spaced out.
I mean we talk to you, and it's like you're all somewhere else!

Nanoha:
I-I'm sorry, Arisa...

Arisa:
Oh yeah? Well, don't apologize to me.
If you're that bored with us, you could just sit by yourself and be spaced all you want!
Let's go, Suzuka!

Suzuka:
Arisa! Ah, Nanoha?

Nanoha:
It's all right, Suzuka. She's right, it really was my fault.

Suzuka:
I don't think so. I think Arisa said a lot more than she should have.
I think I'm gonna go talk to her about it.

Nanoha:
Yeah, I'm sorry. I made her mad... Arisa, I'm sorry.

Suzuka:
Arisa! Arisa! Arisa, stop!

Arisa:
What is it?

Suzuka:
I kind of understand why you are so angry. I mean she's been acting strange, but you shouldn't dwell on it.

Arisa:
It just irritates me! It's obvious that she's worried about something, and it's obvious that she's trying to decide on something and that she's in trouble!
But no matter how much we ask her, or offer to help with it, she won't tell us anything.
She's lying straight to our faces about everything!

Suzuka:
No matter how good a friend we are, there are some things that we just can't tell each other.
If there is something in Nanoha's life that she wants to keep a secret, all we can do is wait for her to tell us when she's ready.

Arisa:
I'm telling you that's what irritates me! I want to be able to help her, even if this is only for a little bit!
I don't care what her secret's about, I may not be able to do anything, but at least we can all try to work it out together.

Suzuka:
So when all is said and done, Arisa, you really care about Nanoha a lot.

Arisa:
Of course I care about Nanoha!
Because of her, I was finally able to stop feeling all alone.

Suzuka:
Me, too. I feel the same way. You know, because of Nanoha, you and I were able to become good friends.
See you later, Nanoha. I'm sorry, but we both have lessons we have to get to.

Nanoha:
It goes on until pretty late, right? Well, take care and do your best.

Suzuka:
Arisa? Oh, we'll be all right, okay Nanoha?

Nanoha:
Yeah. I'll see you guys later on.
This is weird. It's been a while since I last walked home by myself.
I think I'll take a different way home. I don't wanna anyone to see how I look right now.

Suzuka:
You remember when we all first met? I used to be much more timid than I am now.
And I couldn't say anything that was on my mind. And no matter what anyone said to me, I could not give back.

Arisa:
I hate to say it, but I think I was the most rotten kid, arrogant, selfish, boastful.
That's why I made fun of my classmates, mocked them, because I really had a weak will.

Suzuka (past):
Oh, wait, that's... Please...

Suzuka:
And because I had a weak will, I couldn't say what I needed to: "That is something very dear to me, so please give it back, Arisa."

Arisa:
Even though people told me to stop it, I wouldn't listen to them.
I felt that I would somehow lose myself if I honestly listened to what someone else had to say.

Suzuka:
What was it that Nanoha asked you back then?

Arisa:
"Is that hurt? Because the heart of someone who got something dear taken away hurts much, much more than that."

Suzuka:
I remember now.

Nanoha:
I think I ended up in a huge fight with Arisa after that.
And the one who stopped us was...

Arisa:
Was the quiet girl that started it all.

Suzuka (past):
Stop it!

Suzuka:
Way back then, I was really desperate, you know.

Arisa:
After that day, we all slowly started to talk to each other and became friends.

Suzuka:
That's right. The three of us.

Arisa:
So, now that you brought up all the stuff from the past, what in the world do you want me to do with it?

Suzuka:
You know fully well what.

Arisa:
Nanoha just doesn't want us to worry about whatever it is that's troubling her, I know that.
I also know that we probably can't be of any help to her, either.
So if the only thing we can do now is to wait, then, I'll [just] stay upset while I'm waiting for her,
for the loneliness of not being able to share our feelings, and for not being able to help my friend!

Suzuka:
You're so stubborn.

Arisa:
Humph!

Yuno:
I see... 
So you guys got in a fight?

Nanoha:
Not really. Arisa just scolded me a little for being so spaced out all the time.

Yuno:
You're close friends, right?

Nanoha:
Yeah. Ever since the first day we entered the school.

Yuno:
Hmm...

Nanoha:
Here. This is your share of the cookie, Yuno.

Yuno:
Oh.

Nanoha:
There's no cram school today, so we can take our time to search for Jewel Seeds until it's time for dinner.
Let's do our best together!

Yuno:
Yeah, let's do our best.

Alf:
The food in this world isn't half bad. Well, I could really get used to this.
Now, time to check on my young lady. Oops, almost forgot!
Oh, you didn't eat your meal again! This isn't good, you have to eat.

Fate:
I ate a little bit. I'm fine.
We'll get going soon. I'm not completely sure, but I think I know where the next Jewel Seed is.
I don't want to make Mom wait too long for it.

Alf:
Well Fate, you are my master and I'm your familiar, so if you say we need to go, we'll go.
It's not my place to question my master's orders.

Fate:
Oh, we can leave after you finish eating that.

Alf:
Oh, th-that's not what I meant! I'm getting really worried about you, Fate.
Wide area search magic takes quite a bit of stamina to pull off, but you've barely been eating and sleeping and it's starting to show.
And that wound doesn't make things any easier!

Fate:
It's all right. I've always been pretty tough.

Alf:
Fate, please...

Fate:
Come on, let's go. Mom is waiting for us.

Nanoha:
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha is back again!

Shinobu:
Hey Kyoya, have you noticed anything strange with Nanoha?

Kyoya:
Huh?

Shinobu:
Do you know if she's been worried about anything lately? She looks like something's on her mind.
Even Suzuka seems to be worried about her.

Kyoya:
Yeah, I've noticed. She tends to go out more often in the afternoons and evenings lately.

Shinobu:
I don't wanna meddle too much, but do you think it would be okay if I try to have a talk with her?

Kyoya:
I think that'll be great, but I seriously doubt she'll tell you anything.

Shinobu:
You don't think I'm capable?

Kyoya:
No, no, that's not what I mean. It's not that she won't tell anything to you personally.
I really don't think she'll be telling anyone.
She gets that way, as far as when she's got something bothering her, [and / or] when she's tried to make a decision about something.

Shinobu:
Oh, I see.

Kyoya:
Well, I don't think it much need to worry about. I'm sure she'll come up with the answer on her own.

Shinobu:
I hope so.

TV:
This new model comes that amazing number of features but still...

Nanoha:
We're all out of time. We need to get back home soon.

Yuno:
It's okay. I'll stick around here and search for a little while longer.

Nanoha:
Mm. Are you gonna be all right by yourself?

Yuno:
I'll be fine, okay? 

Nanoha:
Maybe Arisa and Suzuka are done with their lessons and are on their way home by now.

Fate:
I think it's somewhere around here. But I can only approximate the location.

Alf:
Yeah. When you're in a city this crowded, it's a real chore to find it.

Fate:
I know it's a bit cool, but I'm going to shower the area with magical power to try to force it to execute.

Alf:
Wait, hold on! I'll take care of that.

Fate:
Are you sure, Alf? It's pretty tiring, you know.

Alf:
Humph! Whose familiar do you think I am? I won't even break a sweat.

Fate:
All right, then, go ahead.

Alf:
Here goes!

Yuno:
Forcing an execution in the middle of a city!? Broadband barrier, please make it!

Nanoha:
Raising Heart, please!

Fate:
I found it!

Alf:
But it seems the others are somewhere nearby, too.

Fate:
Let's get this done quickly. Okay, now Bardiche.

Bardiche:
Sealing form, set up.

Yuno:
Nanoha! Can you see the executed Jewel Seed?

Nanoha:
Yeah! It's really close by!

Yuno:
Those other girls are close by, too. You'd better hurry and seal it before that girl does!

Nanoha:
Got it!
Lyrical Magical!

Fate:
Jewel Seed serial nineteen!

Nanoha:
Seal!

Fate:
Seal!

Raising Heart:
Device mode.

Suzuka (past):
Stop it!

Nanoha:
Neither Arisa nor Suzuka were friends with me back when we first met each other.
Because we couldn't talk to each other. Because we couldn't understand each other.
The reason why I made Arisa mad is because I couldn't tell her how I really felt, or what I was really thinking.

Yuno:
All right. Nanoha, hurry up and capture it!

Alf:
You think I'll let you?

Nanoha:
Because we both have an objective, we probably can't help clashing with each other.
But, I still want to know.
I couldn't introduce myself the other day. I'm Nanoha, Nanoha Takamachi!
I'm a third grader at Seishou University Elementary School.

Bardiche:
Scythe form.

Nanoha:
I wonder... why do you have such sad eyes.

Raising Heart:
Flier Fin.

Arisa:
Texting Nanoha?

Suzuka:
Yeah. Now that my lesson is over.

Arisa:
Let's go home.

Suzuka:
Sure. Just hold on a sec!
"I hope that your worries are solved soon so that you can be happy.
Please do your best. I'll always be with you cheering you on. Suzuka."

Raising Heart:
Flash Move.
Divine Shooter.

Bardiche:
Defensor.

Nanoha:
Fate, wait! You said that just talking it out with mere words wouldn't be able to get the points across.
But I'm sure there're things out there that don't make it across unless you talk, unless you put them into words!
We may not be able to avoid clashing with each other, competing with each other for Jewel Seeds.
But I... I don't wanna just keep fighting and fighting with you without knowing anything!
I only started collecting Jewel Seeds because Yuno was looking for them and I wanted to help him out!
Yuno was the one that found the Jewel Seeds in the first place, and Yuno was the one that needs to collect them all and bring them back together, so they can be safe and sound for the rest of time.
Though it was coincidence that I started out just helping him, I'm now collecting the Jewel Seeds on my own will because I want to. 
Because I don't want to see danger falling on to this city where I live, or the people around me! This is my reason!

Fate:
I...

Alf:
Fate! You don't have to answer!
You don't have to tell anything to a stupid little brat that [read the spoiled story about life] around people who are always nice to her no matter what!
Our primary objective is to capture all the Jewel Seeds no matter what it takes!

Yuno:
Nanoha!

Nanoha:
I'm fine!

Arisa:
Suzuka, what's wrong?

Suzuka:
Oh, nothing. I'm sorry.

Arisa:
Suzuka, I'm starving. Let's hurry home.

Suzuka:
Right.

Alf:
Such an explosion, that's just gotta be a bad thing.

Fate:
But, Mom is waiting.

Yuno:
What is the truth behind the Jewel Seeds? And a third magician appears!?

Nanoha:
On the next episode of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, it's episode seven: A Third Mage!?
Lyrical Magical, and hopes that I don't lose!
