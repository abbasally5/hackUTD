Nanoha:
I'm Nanoha Takamachi, and I was supposed to be an ordinary third grader.
But something happened to me that changed everything.
I was given a jewel called the Raising Heart and with it, I got these magic powers.
I understand how you feel because I want to run away, too. But I can't.
I made a decision and I have to stick with it. That's why we're going to have it out once and for all.
We'll risk everything we have on our magic. I already told you why, I just want to see you smile.
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha is about to begin.

Fate:
Mother. My mother. She was always so kind. My mother... When she said my name, it was always so gentle.

Precia:
Well, isn't it pretty, Alicia?

Fate:
Alicia? That's not right, Mother. My name is Fate!

Precia:
Want to try it on, Alicia?
There, you look cute, Alicia.

Fate:
I guess... it's all right.
Because, I love my mother.

Nanoha:
Memories That Lie Beyond Time.

Amy:
Looks like the battle's about to start.

Chrono:
Yeah.

Amy:
It's a pretty unusual tactic for you, though.
Letting Nanoha fight this one on her own is quite a gamble.

Chrono:
Well, it would be better if Nanoha beat Fate.
But in the end, it doesn't really matter whether she wins or loses today, does it?

Amy:
You're right, Chrono.
And while Nanoha buys us some time battling that Fate girl, I was going to set up a tracking system to find out where she lives. Neat, huh?

Chrono:
I'm counting on you, Amy. Don't let her get away.

Amy:
Just leave it to me, Chrono! Huh?
You know, is it really such a good idea to keep Nanoha in the dark, about Precia Testarossa's family and what happened to them?

Chrono:
It's best that Nanoha wins her battle today. Right now, I don't want her worrying about that.

Bardiche:
Photon Lancer.

Raising Heart:
Divine Shooter.

Fate:
Fire!

Nanoha:
Shoot!
Shoot!

Bardiche:
Scythe form.

Raising Heart:
Round Shield.
Flash Move.

Bardiche:
Scythe Slash.
Fire.

Fate:
When I first met her, she was just some kid with strong magical powers. She's changed.
She's tougher, faster. If I don't stay focused, she'll win!

Bardiche:
Phalanx Shift.

Alf:
Lightning Bind!? Oh no, this is bad!

Yuno:
Nanoha, I'll be right there!

Nanoha:
Stay back! Miss Alf, Yuno, please don't interfere!
This fight's one-on-one at full power. It's between me and Fate, so stay back!

Alf:
But she's getting ready to do something that's really bad!

Nanoha:
I'm fine!

Fate:
Arukas, Kurutas, Eygias... Now the spears of thunder, fly straight and through to the target...
Baruel, Zaruel, Browzel... Photon Lancer Phalanx Shift! Destroy target, fire!

Yuno:
Nanoha!

Alf:
Fate!

Nanoha:
When you're tired, I guess that bind thing loses its grip.
This time, it's my turn...

Raising Heart:
Divine...

Nanoha:
Here goes!

Raising Heart:
Buster.

Fate:
A direct hit!? If she can survive one, then I can survive one, too!

Alf:
Fate...

Nanoha:
Try this one, it's a variation of Divine Buster!

Raising Heart:
Starlight Breaker.

Fate:
A bind!?

Nanoha:
Now I'm gonna hit you with everything I've got!
Starlight Breaker!

Chrono:
Wow! That was a lot of power!

Amy:
Oh no, where's Fate? Is she still alive?

Nanoha:
Oh no, Fate!
I got you, Fate. Don't worry, you're safe.
I'm sorry. Are you okay?
Guess I won, didn't I, Fate?

Fate:
Yeah... I guess you have.

Bardiche:
Put out.

Nanoha:
Can you fly?

Chrono:
All right, Nanoha. Secure those Jewel Seeds and bring Fate in.

Amy:
She's here! Look!

Nanoha:
Oh no, Fate!

Amy:
Bingo! I've got you now, Precia.

Chrono:
Right. Hopefully we're ready for whatever she's got in mind. The coordinates!

Amy:
Yep. I'm sending them through right now.

Lindy:
All armed personnel, stand by at the transfer ports!
Your mission is the capture of Precia Testarossa.

Armed personnel:
Yes, ma'am!

Precia:
I can't hold up this dimensional magic much longer. They've figured out my location this time, they'll be here soon.
Fate... you were useless after all. I think it's time. I'll put an end to this.

Crew:
Squadron two has made the jump. Squadron one is moving in on target.

Lindy:
Good job, everyone. Miss Fate, nice to meet you. I'm Captain Lindy.
Nanoha, I'd rather she weren't here to see her mother's arrest.
Could you please take her somewhere else until it's over?

Nanoha:
Ah, okay. Oh hey, Fate. If you want, I'll show you my room...

Crew:
All units are in the throne room and have the target in sight.

Armed personnel:
Precia Testarossa! You are under arrest for violating Time-Space Administrative laws and for attacking the Bureau's flag ship, the Arthra.

Drop any weapons you have and come here.

Cover that side!

Check that door!

W-What the...!?

Precia:
Don't go near my Alicia! Stay away from her!

Armed personnel:
Fire!

Precia:
Be silent...

Lindy:
Get out of there! Look out!
This is bad! Get everyone out of there, right away!

Amy:
Right. I'm working on it, ma'am.

Fate:
Ali...cia...?

Amy:
Coordinates: 012A-503!

Crew:
Locked! Transfer operation, stand by!

Precia:
It's no good... We are all out of time... I only have nine of the Lost Logias...
I don't know if that's enough to get us out of here and take us to Alhazerd.
Well, no matter... it's over... I spent so long grieving over the loss of my poor child...
All that time, I treated a worthless copy of her as my daughter.
Are you listening, Fate? I'm talking about you.
I went through the trouble of giving you Alicia's memories, but you only look like her.
A useless copy... a fake, a cheap toy!

Amy:
Alicia Testarossa was Precia's real daughter. She was killed during that illegal experiment, the one that destroyed Central Midchilda.
The real purpose of Precia's experiments, was to try and create a brand new artificial life form, one that will surpass all other familiars.
She wanted to revive her dead child. So she created a copy of Alicia. The name "Fate" was the code name she had given her experiment.

Precia:
I'm impressed you found out so much about me. Everything you say is true.
Nothing when this planned, it was all total failure. An artificial being is nothing but a fake, isn't it?
They can never take the place of something so special...
Alicia would smile at me more kindly than you ever could!
She could be selfish sometimes, but she always did what I told her to.
She always listened to her mother.

Nanoha:
Stop it...

Precia:
She was kind. Alicia was always so kind to me. Well, Fate. Understand now?
You're just a fake Alicia. I went through all the trouble of giving you her memories.
But you weren't good enough for them.

Nanoha:
Stop it... Stop it!

Precia:
You were just a doll I was using to comfort me, until I can bring my sweet Alicia back to life.
I don't think I'll need you anymore. So you're free to go now, you fake!

Nanoha:
Wait! Stop saying those things!

Precia:
Would you like to know something?
Ever since I made you, all this time that you fumbled around thinking you were my daughter, I hated you so much!

Nanoha:
Wake up, Fate!

Yuno:
Oh no...

Crew:
We've picked up all our agents. They're safe now, ma'am.

Lindy:
Hmm...

Amy:
C-Captain! We got a problem! Take a look, ma'am!
Magical reactions are activating, a lot!

Chrono:
What the... what's going on in there!?

Crew:
I've got a large amount of class A magical activity coming from the garden!

Sixty, no, eighty! There's more coming!

Lindy:
Precia Testarossa... What do you think you're doing in there!?

Precia:
We are leaving this place... Don't try to get in our way, or else!
Come now my dear Alicia! To the forgotten capital, the Alhazerd!

Chrono:
Stop her!

Precia:
With this power, we are leaving. And we'll take it back! We'll take it all back!

Crew:
It's a huge dimensional tremor!

Lindy:
Hurry! Activate the Distortion Shields!

Crew:
Nine Jewel Seeds have been activated! This tremor's going to get even worse, ma'am!

Lindy:
Maintain the transfer radius, but get ready to take evasive action if it gets worse!

Crew:
Roger, ma'am.

I've got multiple hits! This could turn into a dimensional rift!

Amy:
No... Alhazerd...

Chrono:
She's insane!

Amy:
Where are you going?

Chrono:
I have to stop this! Hurry, open the gate!
Alhazerd... the forgotten capital...
The place where all the forbidden spells and secrets are kept hidden.
What does Precia think she's doing!? Does she seriously think she's going to bring back her daughter by going there!?
You can never regain the past you lost, no matter what type of magic you use! It's not possible!

Precia:
Once we reach Alhazerd, Alicia and I are going to turn everything back to how it was!

Yuno:
A dimensional tremor has begun. We're heading for the Garden of Time to try to stop Precia, to save Nanoha's world, all world and countless others.
We must not fail. And Fate, what about her?

Nanoha:
On the next episode of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, it's episode twelve: The Time of the Sealing of Our Fate.
Lyrical Magical, until the very end, I'm sure...
