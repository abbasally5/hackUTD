Nanoha:
Under this great big sky, there are thousands, no, tens of thousands of people.
All kinds of people with all sorts of wishes and feelings hiding inside.
Sometimes, a person's emotions can touch and clash with someone else's.
And there's people whose feelings can bond with another so perfectly, they can talk without saying a word.
Well, this is a story about people like that, and what happens when they eventually meet.
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha is about to start!


Yuno:
Ancient resonance, turn into light! Put the unforgiven inside the ring of sealing! Jewel Seed, sealing!
It got... away. Let's... get... it...
Someone, hear my voice. Lend me your powers. Magical... powers.


Nanoha:
Is This What You Call a Mysterious Encounter?


Nanoha:
Oh my, that was a really strange dream.

I'm Nanoha Takamachi. I'm a third grader at Seishou Elementary, a magnet school for Seishou University.
And in my family, the Takamachi family, I'm the youngest of three children.

Good morning.

Momoko:
Oh, Nanoha, G'morning.

Shiro:
Oh, good morning, Nanoha.

Momoko:
Take this to the table, sweetie.

Nanoha:
Sure!

The people you just saw, they're my mother and father.

Shiro:
You managed to wake up on your own today. That's my girl.

Nanoha:
This is Shiro Takamachi, my father. He owns Midoriya, a cafe across the street from the train station.

Momoko:
Breakfast is almost ready. I hope you're hungry.

Nanoha:
That's my mother, Momoko Takamachi. She does all the baking at Midoriya cafe.
She's so beautiful and kind, I love my mother!
Midoriya sits right in the middle of a block of shops across from the train station.
It prides itself on its cakes, cream puffs and house-roasted coffee.
And, it's a favorite hangout for the schoolgirls, as well as the ladies of the neighborhood.

Where is my big brother and big sister?

Shiro:
Oh, I'll bet they're at the dojo.

Nanoha:
Good morning. It's time for our breakfast, you guys coming?

Kyoya:
Good morning.

Miyuki:
Hey Nanoha, good morning.

Nanoha:
Here!

Miyuki:
Thanks a lot.

Nanoha:
That's my brother and sister. They're older than me.

Kyoya:
Okay Miyuki, I guess that's it for now.

Nanoha:
My big brother, Kyoya Takamachi, he's a freshman in college.
He's just like dad because he's a swordsman, too.
He also coaches my sister.

Miyuki:
Cool. But after I get home from school, I'm gonna wanna practice some more.

Nanoha:
And that's my sister, Miyuki Takamachi. She's in the eleventh grade.

Shiro:
Hmm... It's as tasty as ever today. These scrambled eggs are amazing.

Momoko:
You like it? I mixed in some tomato and cheese, and a little bit of basil to bring out the flavor.

Shiro:
You guys are so lucky. Did you know that your mother's the best chef in the world?
I kid you not, she really is.

Miyuki:
Of course we did, didn't we, Nanoha?

Nanoha:
Yep.

Momoko:
Oh, cut it out, look at what you started, honey.

Nanoha:
Even after all these years, our parents still act like a couple of newlyweds.

Kyoya:
Miyuki, your ribbon's twisted up.

Miyuki:
What? Really?

Kyoya:
Here, let me fix it.

Nanoha:
As you can see, my brother and sister also get along really well.
Even though I realized that everyone in this family loves me just as much, there are times when I can't help feeling like a third wheel.

Good morning.

Suzuka:
Hey, Nanoha.

Arisa:
Nanoha, we're right over here.

Nanoha:
Hey Suzuka. Hey Arisa.

Arisa:
Good morning.

Suzuka:
Good morning, Nanoha.

Nanoha:
Good morning.

My friends, Arisa Bannings and Suzuka Tsukimura, have been in the same class as me since the first grade.
And this year, we're going to the same prep school, too.

Teacher:
Okay class, let's talk about your project. I asked you to research some of the businesses in the city.
Now after observing the folks that worked in these places, hopefully you had a chance to really experience how they function in their various jobs.
There are lots of different things one can do for a living.
And that's the point of this exercise. Was there a particular job you thought was interesting?
It's a good idea to start thinking about your future right now.

Student:
Stand.

Nanoha:
My future... Hey you guys, do either of you have any idea of what you wanna be when you grow up?

Arisa:
Well, since both my mom and dad run their own company in the city, 
I'm gonna have to study a lot, so I can take over when I'm done with school. What are you gonna do?

Suzuka:
Well, I guess... I sort of like machines, so I was thinking I could be a specialist in the field of engineering or something.

Nanoha:
Really? Both of you are so amazing. 

Arisa:
But you're gonna be part-owner of the cafe Midoriya, aren't you?

Nanoha:
Umm... yeah... I guess I could end up doing that. But I've got this feeling that there's something else I should be doing.
Only problem is, I don't know what that would be. I mean, I really don't have any special traits or talents.

Arisa:
You idiot!
Don't ever say that about yourself ever again! You hear!?

Suzuka:
She's right. I'm sure there's something out there that only you can do, Nanoha.

Arisa:

Who says there's nothing special about you now, huh? Huh? Who?

Nanoha:
But my Japanese is horrible. Ah! I'm terrible in gym class!

Suzuka:
Stop it! Stop! Don't do harm.

Nanoha:
Something I can do. Something only I can do.

Arisa:
Hey, wasn't Suzuka totally amazing in dodgeball today?

Nanoha:
Yeah, she was awesome.

Suzuka:
Oh, come on, guys. I wasn't that good.

Woman:
Hey! Stop it!

Arisa:
URUSAI!
Hey, over here guys. We can take the shortcut through the woods, and we'll be there in no time.

Suzuka:
Are you sure about this?

Arisa:
Hmm... yeah, the path is rough, but we'll be fine.

Nanoha:
This is the place I saw in my dream last night.

Suzuka:
Is something wrong?

Arisa:
Nanoha?

Nanoha:
Ah, no! It's nothing. Sorry.

Suzuka:
Are you all right?

Nanoha:
Yeah.

Arisa:
Okay. Then, let's go.

Nanoha:
How strange...

Suzuka:
Nanoha!

Nanoha:
Ah, yeah!

Yuno:
Help me.

Arisa:
Nanoha?

Nanoha:
Did you guys hear something just now? 

Suzuka:
Umm... like what?

Nanoha:
Like someone's voice?

Arisa:
Not really.

Suzuka:
I don't think I heard anything.

Yuno:
Help me!

Arisa:
Nanoha!

Suzuka:
Nanoha, wait!

Nanoha:
I think that the voice came from over here.

Arisa:
What's wrong, Nanoha? Why did you run away like that?

Suzuka:
Look! It's an animal. I think it's hurt.

Nanoha:
Yeah. What should we do?

Arisa:
I don't know. I think we should take it to a hospital or something.

Suzuka:
No, you mean a veterinarian.

Nanoha:
Umm... wait! Is there a veterinarian around here? 

Arisa:
I don't know. Let me think. A vet? Umm...

Suzuka:
Wait. I'll try calling home.


Nanoha:
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha.

Momoko:
Nanoha!

Kyoya:
Nanoha!

Miyuki:
Nanoha!

Shiro:
Hey, Nanoha!

Nanoha:
Yeah, I'll be right there!

Doctor:
Well, girls. His wounds aren't serious. Although the little fellow does seem very weak.
He was probably out there on his own for a while before you found him.

Nanoha:
Thank you so much for all your help, doctor.

Arisa&Suzuka:
Thank you very much.

Doctor:
You're welcome. That's what I'm here for.

Arisa:
Doctor, this poor little thing is a ferret, isn't he? I think maybe he might be somebody's pet.

Doctor:
I've never seen a ferret like that. It's a very strange breed.
Hmm... and this thing hanging off its collar, it looks like some kind of gem.

Suzuka:
Look, it's awake.

Doctor:
Hmm... huh?

Suzuka:
Look.

Arisa:
Nanoha, it's looking at you.

Nanoha:
Huh? Oh, yeah.

Doctor:
It's probably better if we let him sleep for a while. Don't worry, I'll take good care of him until tomorrow, okay?

Nanoha&Arisa&Suzuka:
Sure! Thanks a lot, doctor.

Doctor:
If you wanna check on him tomorrow, just come by any time, okay?

Nanoha&Arisa&Suzuka:
Yes, we will.

Arisa:
Oh no, we're gonna be late for prep school!

Suzuka:
You're right.

Nanoha:
I'm sorry, doctor, but we have to go now. We'll be back tomorrow, promise!

Teacher:
Let's have a look at the last problem from yesterday's lesson. It's at the top of page forty seven in your textbooks.
It's a sample problem. Now, the problem states, we have thirty nine over forty five.
Both the numerator and the denominator can be divided by three. That makes it thirteen over fifteen, right?

Nanoha:
Hmm... my family's business is preparing food. Guess raising a pet's out of the question.

Teacher:
Okay, someone else take a crack at it. Number twenty nine, Miss Takamachi, would you do us the honor?

Nanoha:
Oh, yes sir!

Arisa:
It's problem three on page forty seven.

Nanoha:
Let's see... nine goes in two... and [then] to that... the answer is five over forty-two.

Teacher:
Yes, correct. Okay, here's where it gets interesting, some people stop your thinking in the following...

Suzuka:
Good going.

Arisa:
Nice job.

Nanoha:
And so, that poor thing doesn't have any place else to go and I thought maybe we could take care of it for a while.

Shiro:
Hmm... a ferret, huh? What the heck is a ferret, anyway?

Kyoya:
I think it's kind of like a weasel, Dad.

Miyuki:
Actually, ferrets have been sort of the popular pets to have for quite a while now.

Momoko:
Ferrets are small skinny creatures, aren't they?

Shiro:
You know what ferrets are?

Nanoha:
Umm...well, it's this big.

Momoko:
If it's for a little while then fine. But only if you keep it in a cage and take good care of it, okay Nanoha? Kyoya, Miyuki, sound good?

Kyoya:
Well, I don't have a problem with it.

Miyuki:
Neither do I.

Shiro:
Hmm... so that's that.

Momoko:
Are you happy?

Nanoha:
Yeah! Thank you so much!

Momoko:
Okay, eat up before it gets cold.

All:
Okay.

Shiro:
Momoko, can you pass me the salad?

Momoko:
Sure. Here you go.

Kyoya:
Me too.

Momoko:
Sure.

Nanoha:
"Hey Arisa, hey Suzuka, guess what? I got permission to raise the little guy at our house.
So tomorrow after school, why don't we all go and pick him up from the vet, okay? Nanoha." Send.

Yuno:
Can you hear me? Are you there? Can you hear me?

Nanoha:
It's that voice again. The one from the forest, the one from my dream.

Yuno:
Listen to me. I know you can hear my voice. Please. I need you to lend me some of your power, just a small bit.

Nanoha:
Is that the little one talking to me?

Yuno:
Hurry, please! Come to me. Time is... There's danger. It's here.

Nanoha:
It is...

Yuno:
Please... hear me.

Nanoha:
It's that sound again.
Uh, the little ferret!
Wait! What's happening? What's going on? 

Yuno:
You came. Thank you.

Nanoha:
It talked!
Okay, okay, I don't know what's going on around here. What is that thing? What's going on?

Yuno:
Yes, I knew it. You have lots of talent. Listen, I need you to lend me a little bit of your powers, please.

Nanoha:
What talent?

Yuno:
I've come from a different world. I came here to search for something. But, I... I don't think I have enough power to do it alone.
I really don't wanna cause you any trouble. But I need people with talent to help me out.
You'll be rewarded. I'll make sure of it. But you have to hurry now. I want you to use the powers that I have.
Use my powers... the powers of magic! 

Nanoha:
Magical?

Yuno:
I promise I'll make sure to reward you.

Nanoha:
Can't we talk about rewards and stuff a little bit later?
Oh no, what will I do?

Yuno:
Here.

Nanoha:
It's so warm.

Yuno:
Hold it tight. Close your eyes and open your heart. Now, repeat after me. Okay? Here goes.
I am the one who has been given a mission.

Nanoha:
I am the one who has been given a mission.

Yuno:
Under the contract, release those powers onto me.

Nanoha:
Umm... under the contract, release those powers onto me.

Yuno:
Winds to the sky, stars to the heavens.

Nanoha:
Winds to the sky, stars to the heavens.

Yuno:
And, the unyielding soul...

Nanoha:
And, the unyielding soul....

Nanoha&Yuno:
To this heart! Magic to these hands. Raising Heart, set up!

Raising Heart:
Standby ready, set up.

Nanoha:
What's happening?

Yuno:
What magical power... Calm down, it's okay. 
Draw a picture of a magic wand in your mind. That will control your powers.
Then imagine a suit of armor. That will protect you.

Nanoha:
Well, okay. It's all kind of sudden though. All right then, here we go.
Okay, those will do for now!

Yuno:
You did it.

Nanoha:
What is this? What's happened to me? 

Nanoha:
I'm Nanoha Takamachi. I used to think I was just an ordinary third grader. 
But somehow through dumb luck or some weird destiny, I've been assigned as a magical girl.
I wonder what fate awaits me now. And this ferret, I didn't even get a chance to ask its name.
Is it gonna be okay for me to keep it in the house?
Next time on Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, it's episode two: My Magical Incantation Is Lyrical? 
Lyrical, Magical, I'll do my best!
