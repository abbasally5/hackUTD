Nanoha:
I'm Nanoha Takamachi, and I was supposed to be an ordinary third grader.
But just like that something happened that changed everything.
You see, I was given a little red jewel and with it, I also got these magical powers.
Now that I've met a new friend and had these powers, strange things are starting to happen around me.
But I don't mind. Whatever happens, I'm gonna face it head-on!
The story of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha is about to start!

Nanoha:
Good evening, everyone. I'm Nanoha Takamachi.
Most of the time, I'm just an ordinary third grader.
But these days, all kinds of odd things are going on in my life.

Raising Heart:
Standby, ready.

Nanoha:
Lyrical Magical, Jewel Seed, serial twenty! Seal!

Raising Heart:
Sealing.

Yuno:
Good work, Nanoha. You did it.

Nanoha:
Well, that's my job now. I'm what you'd call a magical girl.

Yuno:
N-Nanoha, are you all right?

Nanoha:
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm just so... little... a little... tired...

Yuno:
N-Nanoha! Nanoha, what's the matter?

Nanoha:
This Town's in a Lot of Danger?

Yuno:
Nanoha, it's morning. You should get up!

Nanoha:
But today's Sunday, just let me sleep for a little bit longer, okay?

Yuno:
Nanoha. Nanoha! Come on! Wake up already! Wake up!

Nanoha:
Hi, Nanoha Takamachi, and I'm in the third grade. I wasn't expecting it, but I met a little ferret named Yuno.
Actually, he's a mage from another world. During the day, I'm just an average grade school girl, but at night, I'm a magical girl.
I help Yuno find and collect these things he's looking for called Jewel Seeds.

Raising Heart:
Confirmation.

Nanoha:
It's been about a week since I met Yuno. And so far, we've collected five Jewel Seeds.
I guess I'm starting to get the hang of all this magical girl stuff, but you know, it's really hard work.

Yuno:
Hey Nanoha, maybe you're right, you should just take it easy today and rest up.

Nanoha:
I guess, but...

Yuno:
We're taking a break. You've already found five of them for me. But you need to rest or you're not going to last.
Besides, you have a promise to keep today.

Nanoha:
Oh, yeah. I forgot.
Okay then, I guess it wouldn't hurt if we took a little break from the Jewel Seeds.

Yuno:
Yeah.

Nanoha:
My dad, Shiro Takamachi, that's him right there! My dad owns and coaches a soccer team called the Midoriya JFC.
They've got a game today. That's why we're here.
Arisa, Suzuka and I promised my dad that we all go watch the game and cheer the players on.

Shiro:
Check out the stand state, they look like [they're] almost full. What do you say we start the ball rolling on this game?

Coarch:
You got it.

Yuno:
So this thing that's going on with a ball is some kind of sport?

Nanoha:
Yep, it's a really fun game called soccer.
You move the ball with your feet and try to get it into the other team's goal to score points.
The only one who can use his hands is the guy in front of the goal.

Yuno:
It looks like a lot of fun.

Arisa:
Wow! He's totally amazing.

Suzuka:
Isn't he, though?

Boy:
Hop field! Get up field!

Nanoha:
Hey Yuno, do you have sports like this on your world?

Yuno:
We do. But I was so busy doing my research and going on digs, I didn't have time to play any of them.

Nanoha:
Yeah... You're just like me. I'm not too good at sports.

Referee:
That's game, everybody! Midoriya JFC wins two to zero!

Shiro:
All right, you guys did a great job today! You see what a little bit of practice can do.

Boys:
Yeah!

Shiro:
We're celebrating today's win with the feast, my treat!

Boys:
Yeah! All right!

Arisa:
Don't you think this little guy's not your normal everyday kind of ferret?
I've never seen one like him before, have you?

Suzuka:
I think you're right.
Do you guys remember what the vet told us? She thought he was different from the average ferret, too.

Nanoha:
Yeah well well, maybe she thought he was different because he's so smart.
Come on Yuno, shake my hand.

Arisa:
Whoa...

Suzuka:
You see that? He's so cute.

Arisa:
Oh, you're so smart, aren't you?

Suzuka:
He's adorable.

Nanoha:
I'm sorry, Yuno.

Yuno:
No, it's okay.

Shiro:
I'll say it again, you guys played a heck of a game today.
Next week, we gotta practice hard though, you guys hear me?
With a little practice, we can win that tournament.

Boys:
Right!

Shiro:
All right team, that's it for today. Be careful on the way home.

Boys:
Thanks again, Coach, see you.

Shiro:
Yep.

Nanoha:
Huh?

Girl:
Good job today.

Boy:
That was a tough game.

Nanoha:
No, it couldn't be...

Arisa:
Hey, Nanoha.

Nanoha:
Huh? Oh no...

Arisa:
Okay, we should probably be getting home now.

Suzuka:
Yeah, I guess she's right.

Nanoha:
Okay, I guess you guys have a lot of things you wanted to do today.

Suzuka:
I'm going some place with my sister.

Arisa:
I'll get to go shopping with Dad!

Nanoha:
Sounds nice. I wanna hear all about it on Monday, okay?

Shiro:
Hey, are you guys calling it a day?

Nanoha:
Oh, hey, Dad.

Arisa:
Thanks for inviting us to the game and for treating us to lunch, Mr. Takamachi.

Suzuka:
Yeah, today's game was so awesome.

Shiro:
I should be the one thanking you for coming and cheering the team on.
Do you guys need a ride home or something?

Suzuka:
Oh, thank you very much. But I'm getting picked up.

Arisa:
Yeah, me too!

Shiro:
Sounds good. What's your plan for today?

Nanoha:
Mmm... I think I wanna go home and relax.

Shiro:
Okay. I'm gonna go home, take a quick bath and head on over to work. You coming?

Nanoha:
Mm!

Arisa&Suzuka:
See you later.

Nanoha:
See you guys tomorrow!

Shiro:
Nanoha, did you grow taller again?

Nanoha:
Oh Jeez Dad, you asked me that just the other day, remember? I'm not growing that fast.

Shiro:
I see.

Yuno:
Nanoha, if you're going to bed, at least change your clothes.

Nanoha:
Maybe you should get some sleep, too, Yuno.

Yuno:
Y-yeah...

Nanoha:
I guess I'll just take a little nap until dinner.

Yuno:
She's so tired. Using magic when you're not used to it can do that. If only I could help her more.

Girl:
You know, I thought you were amazing today.

Boy:
Nah, I just got really lucky, that’s all. It helps to have a good defense like ours. That's for sure.

Girl:
I still think you're awesome, though.

Boy:
Oh, that’s right.

Girl:
What?

Boy:
Here.

Girl:
Wow! It's pretty!

Boy:
I think it's just a plain old rock. But it's so beautiful.

Yuno:
Nanoha!

Nanoha:
Did you feel that?

Shiro:
Hey! What's up, Nanoha? You need to use the bathroom or something?

Nanoha:
No, Dad! I-I just remembered something. I need to go out for a bit, okay?

Shiro:
Okay. Just be careful.

Nanoha:
Okay, Raising Heart. Let's go!

Raising Heart:
Standby ready, set up.

Nanoha:
Oh no...

Yuno:
Looks like a human activated one of the Seeds this time.
When a person wishes hard enough on a Jewel Seed, it uses that to activate.
If you put too much of your heart into it, the Seed releases all its power.

Nanoha:
Huh? Oh no. That boy really did have one. I knew that was one of the Seeds...
I could've stopped him... I could've done something...

Yuno:
Nanoha...
Nanoha?

Nanoha:
What would I do? What am I supposed to do now, Yuno?

Yuno:
What?

Nanoha:
What would I do?

Yuno:
You have to get close to it in order to seal it.
But first, you have to find the place where it sprouted.
It's grown so big though, I don't know where to start looking.

Nanoha:
I have to get to the root of it, right?

Yuno:
Yeah...

Raising Heart:
Area search.

Nanoha:
Lyrical Magical, search for the root of this terrible misfortune!

I've found it!

Yuno:
Really?

Nanoha:
Now, I can seal it away!

Yuno:
It's impossible from here. You have to get closer!

Nanoha:
It's all right. I can do it!
We can do it, can't we, Raising Heart?

Raising Heart:
Shooting mode, set up.

Nanoha:
Go on there and capture the Seed.

Raising Heart:
Standby ready.

Nanoha:
Lyrical Magical, Jewel Seed serial ten... seal it away!

Raising Heart:
Sealing.
Receipt number ten. Mode release.

Nanoha:
Good job, Raising Heart. Thank you very much.

Raising Heart:
Goodbye.

Yuno:
Even I can't do long-range magic. How much magical talent does this girl have?

Nanoha:
I'll bet we bothered a lot of people today, didn't we?

Yuno:
What? Wh-what are you talking about?
Nanoha, you're doing a great job.

Nanoha:
I thought I'd seen him with one. But I wasn't sure.
I thought I was just seeing things.

Yuno:
Nanoha. Please don't be sad. Look, for one thing it's all my fault.
You've just been trying to help me out.
Nanoha, listen to me, you're doing a great job.
Nanoha...

Nanoha:
That was my first mistake since becoming a mage.
It doesn't feel too good when you realize that you are the reason for someone else's suffering.
And when I decided to help Yuno, I knew that, or I thought I did.
From now on, I'll do better than my best. I'll give it everything I've got.
This isn't just for Yuno anymore. This is my decision, my choice.
I'll collect every last one of those Jewel Seeds.
I will make sure that something like this never happens again!

Nanoha:
We get to go to Suzuka's house. Isn't that cool?
She's got a maid and she's got an older sister and she's got lots of kitties, too!
And there's this one kitty that seems a little.. Well, there's something weird about it.
Oh, and another mage shows up. I wonder what she's up to though.
On the next Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, it's episode four: A Rival!? Another Magical Girl!
Lyrical Magical, I'll do my best!
