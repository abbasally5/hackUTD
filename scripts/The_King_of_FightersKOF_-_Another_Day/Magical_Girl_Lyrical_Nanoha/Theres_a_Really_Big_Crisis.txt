Nanoha:
I'm Nanoha Takamachi, and I was supposed to be an ordinary third grader.
But something happened to me that changed everything.
I was given a jewel called the Raising Heart, and with it, I got these magical powers.
Destiny starts to move again, thanks to yet another new introduction.
A small light shining on one's feelings will walk into a forest of hesitation. It's most likely in one's heart.
I decided to believe and move forward, even if I am headed towards the darkening sky.
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha is about to begin.

Crewman:
The battle between the two individuals has already started on site.

The Lost Logia in the center of it is a Class A＋. Its mannerisms are quite unstable, and shows signs of an indiscriminate attack.

Lindy:
A taboo item that meddles with time and space. We must expedite its collection.
Enforcer Chrono Harlaown, are you ready?

Chrono:
I have determined the exact transfer coordinates. I am ready to go at any time. Just give the orders.

Lindy:
Good, Chrono. Go now and stop the battle on site, collect the Lost Logia and get a detailed report from both combatants.

Chrono:
Roger that. Consider it done.

Lindy:
Be careful, Chrono.

Chrono:
Right... I'll be going now.

Nanoha:
There's a Really Big Crisis?

Chrono:
Stop it now! A battle here is just way too dangerous to allow.
I'm Chrono Harlaown, an Enforcer at the Time-Space Administration.
I want you to tell me what this is all about!

Yuno:
Time-Space Administration?

Chrono:
First of all, both of you, withdraw your weapons. If you are going to continue your battle, then...

Alf:
Fate, we're gonna retreat. Step away!
Fate!

Nanoha:
Fate, oh no!
No! Don't! Stop it! Don't shoot, please!

Alf:
We're gonna get out of here, Fate. Hold on tight.

Crewman:
The fighting has stopped. One of the two combatants has escaped.

Lindy:
What about the pursuit?

Crew:
They are fleeing using multiple teleports. We can't keep up.

Lindy:
I see... Well, the battle was stopped quickly, and we finished securing the Lost Logia.
So I'd say this mission was a success. Besides all that, it looks like we'll be able to find out the details.
Chrono, very well done.

Chrono:
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I let one of them get away.

Lindy:
Well, it'll be all right. Don't worry. Now then, I'd like to hear about the circumstances surrounding this incident.
So can you please guide those kids for the Arthra?

Chrono:
Roger that. I'll return immediately.

Nanoha:
Yuno... Yuno, where in the world are we?

Yuno:
Inside a dimensional transporter on by the Time-Space Administration.
Well, to put it simply, it's a ship that can freely move through the many dimensions that exist in this universe.

Nanoha:
Umm... I don't think that's really simple.

Yuno:
Let's see... besides the world that you live in, Nanoha, there are many other worlds.
And the world we live in is one of them.
This ship is used to cross between all the worlds.
And it's the Bureau of Time-Space Administration that controls all the events that affect those respective worlds.

Nanoha:
I see.

Chrono:
Oh, you must be uncomfortable being in that outfit for so long.
You can go ahead and release the barrier jacket and the device.

Nanoha:
What? Oh, I see. Umm... I guess you're right. Well, here goes.

Chrono:
And you. I think it's fine for you to return to your natural form.

Yuno:
Yeah. Come to think of it, that makes sense. I've been in this form for such a long time, I forgot.

Nanoha:
Huh?

Yuno:
I guess it's been quite a while since I've been in this form in front of you, Nanoha?
Nanoha?

Nanoha:
Yuno, Yuno! I mean you're a boy! And I thought you were a ferret! But how! I mean... It can't be!

Chrono:
Excuse me but, is there a difference in opinion between you two?

Yuno:
Nanoha, I don't understand what you upset about.
When we first met and started working together, isn't this the form I was in?

Nanoha:
No! No! You, you were an injured ferret who needed help!

Yuno:
Hmm...
Ah! You're absolutely right! That's true! I'm so sorry. I guess I haven't shown you this form before.

Nanoha:
That's right! You haven't! Y-You surprised me!

Chrono:
Can I have a moment? I'm not really sure of your circumstances, but we're making the Captain wait.
So if at all possible, we'd like to hear your story quickly.

Nanoha:
Umm... Right. Okay.

Yuno:
I'm sorry.

Chrono:
Good then. This way.
Captain, here they are as ordered.

Nanoha:
Huh...!

Lindy:
You must be tired. Please both of you come over here and relax. Let's have a chat.

Chrono:
Please.

Nanoha:
Umm... Thank you.

Lindy:
Oh, I see. So that's what happened. That Lost Logia, you were the one that unearthed the Jewel Seeds, weren't you?

Yuno:
Yeah. That's why I've been trying so hard to collect them.

Lindy:
Admirable.

Chrono:
But at the same time, extremely reckless.

Nanoha:
Pardon me, but what exactly is this Lost Logia?

Lindy:
It's the legacy of the lost world. But you don't understand that, do you? Let's see...
Within the dimensional universe, there are many many worlds. Each world born unto its own, unique.
On rare occasions, worlds are born that evolve too much, too quickly. 
When the pressure of that evolution becomes too great, they tend to destroy themselves through technology and science. 
What's left in the aftermath are dangerous legacies of the lost world's technology.

Chrono:
We generically call such things "Lost Logias". How to control them is unclear, but they are dangerous pieces of technology that depending on their use, can have enough power to destroy an entire world or even the universe itself.

Lindy:
These items need to be collected and stored in suitable places, following proper procedures to prevent misuse.
The Lost Logia you are searching for, the Jewel Seeds, are energy crystals that interact with the various dimensions surrounding it.
If you can collect just a few of them, and execute them in a certain manner, you can create a dimensional tremor within the spatial area.
And in the worst case, create a major severance of dimensions.

Chrono:
That tremor and large explosion that occurred back when you clashed with that black-clad mage, that was a dimensional tremor.
Just one Jewel Seed executing at a very tiny fraction of full strength had that much effect on the world.
The effects of several of them gathered and executed together are impossible to gauge.

Yuno:
I heard about that once. Way back in the year 462, there was a major severance of dimensions.

Chrono:
Yeah. That was a horrible incident.

Lindy:
Many neighboring parallel worlds fell to ruin or worse. It forever altered history.
We won't let it happen again.
Now, with regards to the collection of the Lost Logia, the Jewel Seeds to be exact, the Time-Space Administration will hold all authority.

Chrono:
You guys should just forget this incident, return to your respective worlds, and go back to the lives you had before.

Nanoha:
But why? We can help.

Chrono:
This concerns inner-dimensional interaction. That is far more than any civilian is equipped to handle.

Nanoha:
Yeah, but...

Lindy:
Well, I'm sure you can't sort your feelings when you are told so suddenly. Tonight, take your time and think it over.
The two of you should talk it out, and tomorrow we can discuss it further or answer any questions.

Chrono:
I'll see you out. Is where I found you all right?

Nanoha:
Uh... Yes...
Should we go home for now?

Yuno:
Yeah.

Nanoha:
Umm... So are you about my age?

Yuno:
Yeah, probably. Ah... I bet you're really mad at me, huh.
I really didn't intend to but..., it turned out like I was keeping a secret from you.

Nanoha:
Uh, hmm... I was surprised. But that was about it.

Yuno:
Umm... I'm sorry. And thank you.
Well, anyways... it'll be better for me to be in this form for the everyday stuff.

Nanoha:
Yeah. You're probably right. Let's have dinner, and then really think it out, and decide what to do from here.

Amy:
This is so amazing! Both of them are AAA class mages.

Chrono:
Yeah.

Amy:
This girl in the white outfit is cute. She seems just like your type, Chrono.

Chrono:
Amy! Stop like that really doesn’t matter very much right now.

Amy:
Looking at the average magical power, this girl has 1.27 million. The girl in black has 1.43 million.
The maximum execution power's more than triple that. If we just look at magical power, those two out-power you, Chrono.

Chrono:
Magic is not about the value of your magical power.
You need flexibility to adapt to any situation as well as good decision-making skills.

Amy:
Qualities you possess, which is why I trust you. Chrono, you are the Arthra's trump card, you know that?

Chrono:
Hmm!
Oh, Captain.

Lindy:
Hmm?
Oh, the data for the two girls.

Chrono:
Yes, ma'am.

Lindy:
Indeed, these are amazing girls.

Chrono:
If this much magical power got poured into a Lost Logia, a moderate dimensional tremor would occur.

Lindy:
With this information, I now know the reason why those two children, Nanoha and Yuno, are out collecting the Jewel Seeds.
But the girl dressed in black is still a mystery.

Chrono:
She seemed as though she was rather desperate about it. Perhaps she has a very strong objective driving her.

Lindy:
Objective, huh...
She's still a young child. She has been leading a normal life.
I'm sure she's still young enough to want to be spoiled by her mother.

Alf:
It's not good! If the Time-Space Administration has stepped in, we can't do anything about it.
Let's run away... just the two of us somewhere.

Fate:
No. We can't do that.

Alf:
But, Fate! It would have been fine if he was a weak guy, but that was a first class mage!
If he starts an investigation, we don't know how much time we have before he finds out we're here.
That old hag, your mom I mean, keeps muttering things that make absolutely no sense!
And she keeps doing horrible things to you!

Fate:
Don't say bad things about Mom.

Alf:
I will say them! Because I care about you, I'm worried about you and want you to be happy.
My heart hurts when you're sad, Fate. So much so that it feels like it's been torn apart.
Whenever you're crying, my eyes and the back of my nose start to sting.
It gets hard to breathe and I can't do anything about it.
I don't like it when you're crying or grieving, Fate. It makes me feel so helpless.

Fate:
Though only just a little, our spirits are forever linked together, Alf.
I'm sorry, if it's hurting you. I'll try not to feel sad anymore, and I won't cry anymore.

Alf:
Uh...
All I want for you is the smile, Fate, and to be happy and content, not for me but for you.
Why can't you seem to understand that?

Fate:
Thank you, Alf, my friend. But I want... no, I need to try to fulfill my mother's wishes.
It's not just for Mom, either. I'm sure it's for myself as well.
So, please. Just a little bit longer. We're almost the end of all of this. Will you help me finish what I have to do?

Alf:
Please promise me that you're not just following her orders, that you will be doing your best for yourself, for Fate's sake, and no one else's.
If you can promise that, I will make sure to protect you, Fate.

Fate:
Mm.

Yuno:
And so... both Nanoha and I would like to assist you with your operations.

Chrono:
Assist, huh?

Yuno:
Putting me aside, I believe that Nanoha's magical powers can be a useful tool to help make your goals: collecting the Jewel Seeds, fighting those girls who are after them. In any case, I'm sure we can be very useful to you here on earth.

Lindy:
My, my. It seems you thought this through thoroughly. So then, I guess it would be all right.

Chrono:
M-Mother... I mean Captain.

Lindy:
Let's have them help us.

Chrono:
What!?

Lindy:
It would be good to have our own trump card on this mission. Right, Enforcer Chrono?

Chrono:
Yeah... huh?

Lindy:
I have two conditions: both of you need to be under the control of the Time-Space Administration during this period, that and you must obey every order given to you. Understood?

Yuno:
Yes, understood.
Nanoha, it's been decided.

Nanoha:
Good. Thank you, Yuno.

Shiro:
Now then, Momoko, and Nanoha, we're going out to the hill in the backyard for a little while.

Momoko:
Sure. Are you practicing again?

Kyoya:
Yeah.

Nanoha:
You'll be careful, Dad.

Shiro:
Right. Okay, let's go!

Kyoya:
Sure!

Shiro:
It's been a while, so I'm gonna work you out.

Miyuki:
Hey, wait guys. Hold on a second. I wanna come, too.

Kyoya:
All right. Then, hurry up!

Miyuki:
Yeah, I'll be right there!

Shiro:
Miyuki, it's nice to know you never change.

Momoko:
Well, looks like that's about it.

Nanoha:
Yep!

Momoko:
So, what's this big important thing you said yet to tell me about?

Nanoha:
Right.
What I told Mom was basically everything that's happened, from when I met Yuno until today.
Though I couldn't tell her about the magic, or what Yuno really looks like, I told her what I could.
I also told her that I have to leave the house for a little while to do what I need to do.
I don't know for sure but it might [too] not [to] be something dangerous.
But it's something that I started with the very dear friend! And I wanna stick with it to the very end!

Momoko:
Mm...

Nanoha:
I might make you all worried about me and stuff.

Momoko:
Don't you know? I'm always worried about you. I'm very worried about you, Nanoha. Because I'm your mother, and I love you.
But... if you're still trying to decide on which path to take, I would say that you shouldn't do anything that would take you into danger.
But you've already made up your mind, haven't you?
That you're going to properly finish what you started with your friend, and... that you want to talk things out once more, with that girl you met, with the sad eyes.

Nanoha:
Yeah...

Momoko:
Then, you must go, so that you won't regret it.
I'll talk to your father and older brother, and make them understand what it is you're doing.

Nanoha:
Thanks for understanding, Mom.
I can't turn back now. This is the path I chose for myself. This is what I really want to do!

Precia:
Hurry... You must hurry, Fate. Because the promised land, Alhazerd is waiting for me. My... land of salvation!

Nanoha:
The flag ship of the Time Administration Bureau, the Arthra, has been assigned to take care of me and Yuno.

Yuno:
And abnormal reaction from the Jewel Seeds, never seen before! And the reunion of Nanoha and Fate.

Nanoha:
What is the wish that Fate's mother has?
On the next episode of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, it's episode nine: The Decisive Battle Above the Ocean.
Lyrical Magical, and hopes that I don't lose.
