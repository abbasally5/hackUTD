Nanoha:
I'm Nanoha Takamachi, and I was supposed to be an ordinary third grader.
But something happened to me that changed everything.
I was given a jewel called the Raising Heart, and with it, I got these magic powers.
We've seen each other lots of times. Even so, we still don't really know anything about one another.
I decided to meet her face to face, because I want to hear what she has to say, because I want to be friends with her.
It's time to get rid of all these doubts and believe in the magic that lives in my heart.
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha is about to begin.

Lindy:
I want to see the three of you when you get back.

Chrono:
I understand.

Lindy:
Now then, as for Nanoha and Yuno, I hope you're ready for a very stern lecture from me.

Nanoha:
Everybody's Separate Heartfelt Vows.

Lindy:
When I give you an order, it's important that you follow it to the letter.
It protects you and everyone around you. Neither of you have military experience.
However, your actions today were quite selfish and could have put yourselves and my entire crew in harm's way. 
You understand that, right?

Nanoha, Yuno:
Yes...

Lindy:
Usually I'd assign a severe punishment for this. However, through your actions, we also gained a few things, so...
I think I'll let you off the hook, this time.
However, this will not happen again. Understood?

Nanoha:
Yes, ma'am.

Yuno:
We're terribly sorry.

Lindy:
Then let's move onto the real problem. Chrono, do you have any idea what's behind all of this?

Chrono:
Yes. Amy, please put it up on the monitor.

Amy:
You got it.

Lindy:
Is that...?

Chrono:
Yes. It's the mage, Precia Testarossa. She comes from our home world Midchilda. 
She developed sources of energy for inter-dimensional travel. 
She was a grand mage, too. But after an accident caused by her illegal experiments, she was banished. 
The wavelength of the magical attack that hit us matches similar data we have on her.
And I also found out that the Fate girl is her daughter.

Nanoha:
She's her what? Now I understand what she was saying.

Fate:
It's my mother!

Lindy:
Mother and daughter...

Nanoha:
Umm... I don't know this makes any difference, but she sounded surprised and kind of scared.

Lindy:
Oh, Amy! Would you please pull up some more data on Lady Precia for me?
I need to know where she's been, her family history, anything you can find.

Amy:
Yes, ma'am. I'll get on it right away.

Nanoha:
So this is... Fate's mother...

Precia:
You had them all right in front of you, but all you did was stand there looking stupid!

Fate:
I'm... sorry.

Precia:
You're horrible! I just can't believe you'd want to make your mother so sad.

Nanoha:
All I want, is to be friends.

Amy:
Precia Testarossa...
About twenty six years ago, she was the head of sector three of the Central Technology Development Office.
According to Midchilda record, her goal was to develop an energy matter for dimensional travel called the Hydra.
She was using illegal materials and the experiment failed.
It caused a mid-size dimensional tremor, she was forced to leave central Midchilda, and was relocated to a raw area.
The incidents sparked an inquiry. She argued that the experiment was a success, and that there was nothing illegal about the materials used.
After her relocation, Testarossa was involved in some sorta tech research for a few more years.
Then one day, she just disappeared without a trace. That's all I could find.

Lindy:
Anything more about the research she was doing or about her family?

Amy:
No, ma'am. All the data seems to have been completely wiped from the records.
I've already contacted headquarters to see if they can find out anything else about her.

Lindy:
When will they get back to us?

Amy:
They said it would take at least a couple of days.

Lindy:
I see... We should be careful from here on. After using that much magical power, I'd imagine that both Lady Precia and Fate will need to recharge. 
And as for the Arthra, we'd better get those shields repaired as quickly as possible.
As for the two of you, I think it's best if you rest up for a while.

Nanoha:
Oh, really?

Lindy:
Especially you, Nanoha, I don't think it's good for you to be absent from school for such a long time.
You should go back home for a little while.
I think it's best you see your family and friends and let them know that you're okay.

Nanoha:
Okay.

Alf:
Fate! Fate! Fate... I'm here, Fate.

Precia:
Only nine so far... I can create a dimensional tremor with these, but I won't be able to reach Alhazerd!
Time is running out for me, for me and Alicia...

Alf:
How could you treat your daughter like that!? How could you be so heartless!?
She's always been so good to you, and she's doing her best to make you happy now!
How could you treat her so cruelly!? She doesn't deserve it!

Precia:
Apparently, she can't even make herself a decent familiar.
When she does, she makes them too emotional.

Alf:
The only thing that your daughter ever wanted was for you to be happy again, to be that kind and gentle mother you were before. That's why she...

Precia:
Such a fool... now get out of here!

Alf:
I have to teleport... It doesnâ€™t matter where... I'm sorry, Fate. I'll come back for you.

Precia:
Fate, wake up, Fate.

Fate:
Yes, Mother. I'm awake.

Precia:
You've only been able to bring me nine of the Jewel Seeds so far. But it just isn't enough.
I still need five more, and if you can get more, all the better. Hurry and get them for Mother.

Fate:
I will. 
Oh, where is Alf?

Precia:
Oh... she decided to run away. She got scared and said she was done.
If you need to have another familiar, I can get you a better one. 
But don't you ever forget that the only person you can trust is your mother. Understand, Fate?

Fate:
I do... Mother.

Lindy:
So for the past ten days, that's pretty much the way it's been for us.

Momoko:
Oh, really? It sounds like you had a lot of fun.

Nanoha:
Ms. Lindy, I have to say that's the best story I ever heard, considering it's a lie.

Yuno:
Amazing...

Lindy:
Well, I can't tell your mother the truth. Besides, it's just a tiny lie, I don't want your family to worry.
Seriously though, your Nanoha's such a wonderful little girl. 
And this might sound sort of mean, but I wish Chrono would be more like her.

Momoko:
Oh, come on. You can't mean that.

Lindy:
Oh, you don't know my son, he's not very sociable.

Miyuki:
Nanoha, you are gonna stick around for another couple of days, aren't you?

Nanoha:
Oh, sure.

Kyoya:
You know, Arisa and Suzuka have been worried about you. Did you have a chance to call them yet?

Nanoha:
Mm. I texted them a little while ago.

Arisa:
And sent.

Samejima:
You certainly look happy. Good news, Little Lady Arisa?

Arisa:
Not really. Just ordinary e-mail.
Ah! Samejima, stop the car!
Wow, that's a really big dog.

Samejima:
Stand back, now, My Lady. It's hurt. Those wounds look pretty bad.

Arisa:
But, it's still alive.
Samejima.

Samejima:
Understood, Lady Arisa.

Alf:
Fate...

Nanoha:
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha.

Arisa:
You're awake.

Alf:
I've seen this girl before...

Arisa:
Wow, you're the toughest dog I've ever seen. You were hurt so bad, but everyone kept telling me you're gonna be okay.
Well, I'm glad you're up. I'll take care of you until you get better. Don't worry about a thing.

Alf:
I know. She's that girl's friend.

Arisa:
Eat up. It's soft dog food, so it'll go down easier. I hope you're hungry.
With an appetite like that, you'll be fine in no time.
Eat as much as you want, get some rest and get better, okay?

Suzuka:
Nanoha! I'm so glad that you're okay.

Nanoha:
Oh, yeah. Sorry to make you worry, Suzuka. I didn't mean to make you guys worry, I'm sorry, Arisa.

Arisa:
As long as you're okay, that's all that matters.
Oh, you're gonna leave us again, huh?

Nanoha:
Yeah, I am...

Suzuka:
That must be tough.

Nanoha:
I guess. Oh, well, it'll be okay.

Suzuka:
What about today? Will you have time to play with us after school gets off?

Nanoha:
Oh, yeah. That sounds like fun!

Arisa:
Okay then, let's go to my house. I just got a couple of new video games.

Nanoha:
Really?

Arisa:
Oh, yeah. I almost forgot. Last night, I found a big dog that was injured.

Suzuka:
A dog?

Arisa:
Yeah, that's right.
It's really big and kinda scary looking too. It's got orange fur and there's a little red stone right in the middle of its forehead.

Nanoha:
Miss Alf... it really is you.

Alf:
It's you.

Nanoha:
Those wounds... What happened to you? And what about Fate?

Arisa:
Oh no... she seems to still be really tired. What's wrong? Are you okay?

Suzuka:
Maybe it's in pain. I think we should leave it alone.

Nanoha:
Yeah...

Arisa:
Yuno, watch out! That's dangerous.

Nanoha:
You don't have to worry about him, he's okay.

Yuno:
Nanoha, it's okay. Go inside with the others. I'll talk to her and find out what happened, all right?

Nanoha:
Right.

Arisa:
Let's go have some tea. And we'll have some yummy snacks, too.

Nanoha:
Okay.

Suzuka:
I can't wait.

Nanoha:
Me, too.

Arisa:
I have cookies...

Yuno:
How did you get hurt? Did something happen between you and Fate?

Alf:
The fact you're talking to me means the Time-Space Administration Bureau is watching, right?

Yuno:
Yeah.

Chrono:
This is Chrono Harlaown speaking, I'm from the Bureau.
I know this might be difficult for you, but I need you to tell the truth about what's going on.
I promise nothing will happen to you or to your master Fate. Do we have a deal?

Alf:
Okay... I'll tell you everything. But, first you have to promise me that you'll save Fate.
I swear she hasn't done anything wrong!

Chrono:
You have my word. Amy, start recording.

Amy:
Already rolling.

Alf:
Precia Testarossa... Fate's mother, she's the cause of it all.

Suzuka:
Use that thing you got on the last level. Yeah, that one.

Arisa:
Which one?

Yuno:
Nanoha, did you hear that?

Nanoha:
Yeah... I heard it all.

Chrono:
Everything adds up, with Nanoha's side of the story and Alf's testimony, I can safely say that we finally got into the truth of the matter.
I can't find any contradictions in her story.

Nanoha:
What's going to happen now?

Chrono:
We're going to go capture Precia Testarossa. The fact she attacked the Arthra is reason enough to arrest her, but now we have all the evidence we need.
As soon as we get the go-ahead from the Captain, we'll be changing our mission to focus on the capture and arrest of Precia Testarossa. 
The question now is: what will you do?

Nanoha:
That's easy. I'm going to save Fate, no matter what!
Miss Alf cares about her so much, and I want Fate to be safe, too.
She looks so sad when I see her and somehow, that makes me sad. That's why I'll do it, so that Fate can be happy again.
Besides, I told her I wanted to be her friend, and she hasn't given me an answer yet.

Chrono:
Very well. The Bureau is grateful that we'll have your magical powers on our side, Nanoha Takamachi.
We're going to leave everything concerning Fate Testarossa's rescue to you. Is that all right, Alf?

Alf:
Nanoha, was it? I know I donâ€™t have the right to ask you this, but please... please save her.
She's all alone right now and you're the only one who can help her...

Nanoha:
It'll be all right. Leave it to me.

Arisa:
Nanoha, you're late!

Suzuka:
Hurry, we can't go into this new dungeon we found without you.

Nanoha:
I'm sorry, guys.
Wow, this looks so cool!

Chrono:
You'll be returning to the Arthra tomorrow morning. Hopefully by then, you'll have a plan to deal with Fate...

Nanoha:
That thing totally jumped out and killed me.

Arisa:
That game really sucks me in.

Suzuka:
Stuff like this is way more fun when you're around, Nanoha.

Nanoha:
Thanks, you guys... I'm sure I'll be able to come back real soon, and then it'll be just like it used to be.

Arisa:
Nanoha... Are you over what was bothering you?

Nanoha:
Huh? Umm... I guess so.

Arisa:
'Cause I was worried. All of us were worried about you, did you know that?
I wasn't mad at you because you were keeping secrets, or because you were spacing out all the time, either.
I guess I was mad because you looked sad and confused all the time.
Sometimes, you look like you were getting ready to go somewhere far away.
And I guess I thought you wouldn't come back to see us again.

Nanoha:
Don't worry, I won't do that. You guys are my friends. I'm not going anywhere.

Arisa:
Okay then.

Nanoha:
Don't worry, I won't be gone too long. I promise I'll come back right when I'm done, promise...
It's just that I really need to go take care of something that's really important.
The reason I'm doing this is so that I can figure out who I really am. That's all.
This might be the only chance I have. And I want to take it.

Shiro:
You're looking better. You don't seem worried now.

Nanoha:
Dad? I didn't tell anyone I was worried. How did you know?

Shiro:
Well, I am your father. So of course I'd know if there was something bothering my little girl.
You're going to be leaving us early again tomorrow morning, aren't you?

Nanoha:
Yeah Dad. I'm sorry I couldn't stay longer...

Shiro:
It's okay, Nanoha. I know you're a strong girl. You're going to be fine. There's nothing to worry about.
Just do your best! Okay, kiddo?

Nanoha:
Mm!

Yuno:
Nanoha.

Nanoha:
This place will do, I guess. Come out, Fate. Please come out!

Bardiche:
Scythe form.

Alf:
Fate, let's stop this now... Don't listen to that horrible woman anymore! It's not right!
If you keep going like this, you'll end up being more miserable. Please, Fate!

Fate:
It doesn't matter. I'm her daughter. So I'm doing what must be done.

Nanoha:
We've come too far to throw it out away. And it would be worse if we just walked away from it.
This trouble, started with the Jewel Seeds.
So that'll be the prize. We'll both bet all we have! The winner takes the Jewel Seeds!

Raising Heart:
Put out.

Bardiche:
Put out.

Nanoha:
We'll finish this, and then, we'll be free!
You know, we never even had a chance to get to know each other.
So now, in order to start our new lives free of all this, let's begin... our first and final battle.

Nanoha:
I decided that Fate and I were going to have a duel.
But little did I know that we'd find a connection, between our past and our present.

Yuno:
The Garden of Time begins to move. And what is this Alhazerd that Precia wants?

Nanoha:
On the next episode of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, it's episode eleven: Memories That Lie Beyond Time.
Lyrical Magical, full power all out!
