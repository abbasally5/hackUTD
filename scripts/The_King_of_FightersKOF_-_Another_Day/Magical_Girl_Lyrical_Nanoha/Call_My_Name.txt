Nanoha:
I'm Nanoha Takamachi, and I was supposed to be an ordinary third grader.
But something happened to me that changed everything.
I was given a jewel called the Raising Heart, and with it, I got these magic powers.
I had a tiny feeling about her. And I wish that she would understand.
The beginning of every new journey is always sorta sad. Even though, it's worth it, because I finally got through to her.
Saying goodbye doesnâ€™t mean the end, just the beginning of something new.
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha is about to begin.

Amy:
Please! You have to get out of there!

Alf:
Fate!
Fate!
Ah! Fate, Fate!

Nanoha:
Hurry, Fate!
Fly! Over here!

Nanoha:
Call My Name.

Kyoya:
I think the earthquake's over now.

Miyuki:
Yeah, you're right.

Crewman:
The Garden's destroyed. It's been absorbed into the Imaginary Plane.
The dimensional tremor's over. No dimensional faults to report.

Lindy:
Very good.

Crewman:
Maintaining cruising speed at level three. All systems checked.

Nanoha:
Hey, where's Fate?

Chrono:
She's with Alf, in the brig. Since the two of them are key witnesses to this thing, I'm afraid they're gonna have to stay there for a little while.

Nanoha:
But that's... ow!

Yuno:
Nanoha, hold still!

Chrono:
This was a serious crime. One wrong move on anyone's part, and it would have caused a colossal dimensional fault, seriously.
The Time-Space Administration Bureau has to be very careful about the treatment of everyone involved, you understand?

Nanoha:
Yeah...

Chrono:
Amy, what's with the bow?

Amy:
Ah...

Nanoha:
Well, all kinds of things came to an end that day. Everything from the time I met Yuno till now, it all happened so fast.
The aftershocks from the dimensional tremor hadn't stopped yet, so we spent the next couple of days hanging out on the Arthra.
And then...

Lindy:
As Captain of this ship, I commend you both for your standing efforts on this case.
On behalf of the Bureau, I'd like to present this award to you for your distinguished service.
Nanoha Takamachi and Yuno Scrya. Thank you both.

Nanoha:
Chrono, now that it's over, what's gonna happen to Fate?

Chrono:
Although she had her reasons, as far as the Bureau's concerned, the fact that she was part of the conspiracy to alter dimension's still a crime.
In a case like this, she could get sentence to a few hundred years in prison.

Nanoha:
You're kidding!

Chrono:
However!
Her situation is special. It's obvious that she wasn't willingly part of the dimensional crimes that were committed.
Her mother is to blame for that.
All that's left is to figure out how we're going to get the higher-ups to understand.
But I think I can convince them she's innocent. So you don't have to worry.

Nanoha:
Chrono...

Chrono:
She's gonna be okay. The Time-space Administration Bureau aren't a bunch of cold-hearted people.
We wouldn't go and convict a girl who didn't know any better and just wanted to make her mother happy.

Nanoha:
I can't believe it! I never thought you can be so kind!

Chrono:
W-Wha...!?
I-I'm just doing my job as an Enforcer! It's not like I'm a pushover or anything!

Nanoha:
You don't have to be embarrassed, Chrono.

Chrono:
I'm not embarrassed! What! Don't laugh!

Lindy:
Well, it looks like the aftershocks will be over soon.
I think we just might be able to get you back home by tomorrow, Miss Nanoha, if that's all right with you.

Nanoha:
I'm so glad!

Lindy:
However, it's looking like the route to Midchilda hasn't quite stabilized yet.
It'll take a bit longer for that to clear.

Yuno:
Oh... I understand.

Lindy:
Although, it shouldn't take longer than six months. Believe me if we knew of a faster and safer way to get you there, we wouldn't hesitate.

Yuno:
I guess you're right. Oh well, my clan is full of people who wander all of the place and search of archeological ruins, so... 
I guess there's really no reason for me to hurry back home, is there?
But I feel sort of bad if you going to have to take care of me for a long time.

Nanoha:
You can always come back to my house, just like you've been doing!

Yuno:
Will that be okay?

Nanoha:
Mm-hm! As long as you're okay with you, Yuno!

Yuno:
Then I guess... all right. Thank you, Nanoha.

Chrono:
Jeez! Amy, it's because you slept in!

Amy:
I couldn't help it, I was pulling those all nighters. I'm sleepy...

Lindy:
So the place that she was trying to get to, Alhazerd, you've heard of it before, right, Yuno?

Yuno:
I've heard a few stories about it, yeah.
It's a space that existed in the last century before the days of the old calendar.
The land where all the lost and forbidden spells are stored, or so they say.

Chrono:
They also say that it fell into a dimensional fault a long time ago and is just a bunch of ruins now.

Amy:
Here you go!

Lindy:
I heard that the magic reaches its greatest potential there.
And I also heard that if you use the power of the secret spells of Alhazerd, there isn't a wish that cannot be granted.
There are spells that can turn back time and space, even spells to rewrite the past.
Supposedly, there're even spells there that can resurrect the dead.
That's what Precia wanted...

Nanoha:
Yeah...

Chrono:
Anyone who practices magic knows the story of that place.
And they also know that turning back time and raising the dead or things that can be done.
It's no wonder Precia was trying to get to Alhazerd.
All of her experiments and research were focused on those kind of things.
She wanted a fairy tale to come true.

Lindy:
Don't you think it odd that a mage of her level was searching for it and risking her own life in doing so?
I mean when you think about it, isn't it rather strange that she'd take it that far?
Maybe she really did find it. Of course, we'll never know for sure if she did.
Sorry about that. I got a little carried away with the story. Eat up, before it gets cold.

Chrono:
Well, Nanoha. I guess this'll be your last meal aboard the Arthra.

Nanoha:
Yeah.

Amy:
Well, if you're that sad that she'll go, don't torture yourself, Chrono.
Tell her you want her to stay. Don't be shy about it.

Chrono:
Wow! Hold on!

Amy:
Hey, Nanoha. You can come back and visit us anytime you want, okay?

Nanoha:
Cool! Thanks Amy, I think I will!

Chrono:
Amy! What are you saying!? The Arthra's not a playground!

Lindy:
That sounds like a great idea. We've usually got loads of down time in between missions, so it shouldn't be a problem.

Chrono:
But Captain Lindy!

Nanoha:
The next morning, Yuno and I got to go home.

Lindy:
Thank you again, Nanoha... for everything.

Chrono:
Yes. Thank you for your help.
I'll let you know what happens to Fate once the verdict's been announced.
She'll be fine. I'll make sure nothing bad happens to her.

Nanoha:
Thank you, Chrono.

Lindy:
When you want to go back home, Yuno, please just give us a shout, okay?
I'll even fire up the gate for you.

Yuno:
I will. Thank you, Captain Lindy.

Amy:
Okay. I guess we're ready if you are.

Nanoha, Yuno:
Ready!

Chrono:
See you later.

Nanoha:
Mm-hm. I'll see you later, Chrono and you too, Amy. Bye, Miss Lindy.
Ready to go home now, Yuno?

Yuno:
Yeah.

Nanoha:
I'm home!

Miyuki:
Nanoha! Welcome home!

Nanoha:
And so, I got back to my normal everyday life. It's the same except for all any stuff that's happened to me...
Yeah, life's just a little bit different than before.

Shiro:
Welcome home.

Momoko:
Okay. I'll cook your favorite.

Nanoha:
Yummy!

Suzuka:
Nanoha!

Arisa:
Nanoha!

Nanoha:
Yeah, I'm back. I've returned!
It's funny how when you're caught up in something, when it's over, it seems like time flew by so fast.
But in my heart, I know that all the stuff that happened really happened.
Everyone I met along the way, every time I was in trouble, everything...
Oh, I miss my bed so much! Hey Yuno, are you ready to get some sleeping done?

Yuno:
Yeah.

Nanoha:
Thank you for all your hard work, Raising Heart.

Yuno:
Thanks for everything, Nanoha.

Nanoha:
There's still one thing that I can't stop thinking about though.
It's that girl, the one with the pretty eyes...


Nanoha:
A few days later...
Hello, Nanoha speaking! Oh, really?

Chrono:
Yeah. It was decided a little while ago. Fate'll be transferred to headquarters where she'll be questioned.
Then they'll set up a date for the trial and after that, she'll be done.

Nanoha:
Done!?

Chrono:
Don't worry. Fate'll probably... no, she'll definitely be found innocent.

Amy:
And it's all because Chrono's been working day and night collecting all the evidence to free her.

Chrono:
Amy! She doesn't need to know about that! Jeez!

Nanoha:
Thank you, Chrono!

Chrono:
There's one thing though. The questioning, the trial and everything else will take a bit of time.
So the Bureau thought that...

Nanoha:
Yeah... yeah, aha... I'll be there. Right!

Yuno:
What's up, Nanoha?

Nanoha:
The Bureau's gonna transfer Fate to headquarters for a while.
But you'll never guess, I'm... I'm gonna get to see her for a little bit before she leaves!

Yuno:
Oh wow! That's great!

Nanoha:
I know. And Chrono said she wanted to see me, too!
Fate! I'm here! I made it!

Chrono:
We can't stay here for very long. So have a good talk, okay? We'll just be waiting for you over there.

Nanoha:
Thanks, Chrono.

Fate:
Yeah, thanks, Chrono.

Nanoha:
There were so many things I wanted to talk to you about. It's weird though.
When I saw your face, I totally forgot what I wanted to say.

Fate:
I... I guess I don't know what to say, either.
But I was really happy.

Nanoha:
Huh?

Fate:
I was happy to see you again.

Nanoha:
Mm-hm. I just thought it'd be great if you and I could be friends.
But... I guess you've gotta head out right after this, huh?

Fate:
Yeah, I do. It's gonna be a long trip, too.

Nanoha:
But I can see you again, right?

Fate:
Mm-hm. I'm a little sad about it. But the good thing is I get to start over again now.
I asked to see you because I wanted to give you an answer.
You asked me something before... about wanting to be my friend.

Nanoha:
Yeah, yeah!

Fate:
If you still want to, I mean if it's still okay. How do I say it? I've never done this before...
I think I need you to tell me... how does someone become a friend?

Nanoha:
It's easy... Becoming a friend, it's real easy!
You just say my name. In the beginning, that's all you have to do.
You don't say "Hey, you" or anything like that.
You just look into someone's eyes and then you say the name loud and clear.
My name is Nanoha Takamachi. Call me Nanoha.

Fate:
Nanoha...?

Nanoha:
Yep! That's it!

Fate:
Nanoha...

Nanoha:
Yeah! Yeah!

Fate:
Nanoha!

Nanoha:
Yeah...

Fate:
I thank you, Nanoha.
Nanoha...

Nanoha:
Yeah!

Fate:
Your hands are so warm, Nanoha. You know?
There's something that I think I just learned.
When you see your friend crying, that sort of makes you sad in the same way.

Nanoha:
Oh, Fate!

Fate:
Thank you, Nanoha. Even though we'll be apart, I'm sure we'll see each other soon.
And when we do, can I call you by your name again?
When I want to see you, I'll call your name.
Nanoha, I want you to call my name, too.
And if something's ever bothering you, just remember this.
I will always be there for you.

Alf:
Your girl over there... Nanoha, she really is a good little girl.
I've never seen Fate smile like that before.

Chrono:
It's time. Are you ready?

Nanoha:
Wait! Before you go...
This is the only thing I have to give you as a token of our friendship.

Fate:
Then I've got something for you.
Thank you, Nanoha, for everything.

Nanoha:
You're welcome, Fate.

Fate:
Until we meet again.

Nanoha:
Until we meet again.
Thank you. Take care of yourself, okay Miss Alf?

Alf:
Yeah. And thanks again for everything, Nanoha and Yuno.

Chrono:
I guess I'll be going to.

Nanoha:
I'll see you again, right, Chrono?

Chrono:
Yeah.

Nanoha:
Bye-bye... See you later... Chrono, Miss Alf, Fate...

Yuno:
Nanoha.

Nanoha:
Mm!

Miyuki:
Nanoha!

Nanoha:
Coming!
