  Kyon:
 Something's wrong. That's what it felt like anyway.
 I didn't care about the baseball game on TV, because it was between schools from other town.
 Because I tend to sympathize with underdogs, I ended up rooting for the losing team.
 And it was right about then that I suddenly got a feeling Haruhi was gonna call.

Kyon's sister:
 Your phone's ringing, Kyon.

Kyon:
 I know. You don't have to tell me.

Haruhi:
 Hey, you're free, right? Good!
 Meet us at two o'clock in front of the station.
 And don't be late!

Kyon:
 I didn't even have a chance to say anything.

 Now, what?

Haruhi:
 I forgot to tell you; make sure to bring your swim trunks and some money too.
 Oh, wait, wait. And your bike. Definitely bring your bike.
 That's it, over and out!

Kyon:
 Mmhmm.
 That was weird.
 It was like I knew what Haruhi was gonna say before she even said anything.
 Hang on. Actually, it felt more like we had the exact same conversation before.
 Like deja vu or something.

 Summer's almost over.



Haruhi:
 You're late again, Kyon!
 Where is your motivation!

Kyon:
 Yeah, yeah.
 I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

Mikuru:
 No worries, I just got here too.

Haruhi:
 Now that we're all present and accounted for, we can go!

Kyon:
 Where to?

Haruhi:
 To the public swimming pool! Where do you think?

Kyon:
 That figures, considering the stuff I brought.

Haruhi:
 We've got lots and lots of summer vacation-y things to do during our summer break!
But we've only got so much time because once it's gone, it's gone for good!
 So we're gonna do everything we can while we can during our only summer as tenth graders.
 And for starters, we're riding the bikes to the pool!

Kyon:
 Okay. Did everyone ride their bike today?

Koizumi:
 No, the only bikes we have to ride over are the ones you and I brought.

Kyon:
 Huh?

Haruhi:
 All right, Kyon. Yon can't let Koizumi beat you.
 Come on! Full speed ahead!

Kyon:
 No ESP allowed!


Haruhi:
 Come on, guys. Hurry up and park your bikes.

 Kyon, we're trying to have fun, so stop acting tired.

Kyon:
 And whose fault is that?

Haruhi:
 Hmm! Can you smell the chlorine?
 That really makes it feel like summer!
 Hurry and get in! Come on! The water is warm. It's perfect!

Kyon:
 Can't she see the "No Diving" signs? They're everywhere.

Koizumi:
 Well, that looks like fun, don't you think?
 I mean, seeing her enjoy the day in a normal fashion, it's rather charming sight, isn't it?
 And as long as Miss Suzumiya's having a good time here, we don't have to worry about any Earth shattering events.

Kyon:
 I hope you're right.
 What's wrong?

Koizumi:
 Oh, nothing. It's probably my imagination.
 Come on. Let's go and have some fun, too.


Kyon:
 It's so bitter. May I have another?

 That's weird.
 It's like I've seen this before... Nagato, sitting all alone, looking bored...

Haruhi:
 Kyon!

Kyon:
 Yeah, and then, Haruhi shows up and she says: 

Haruhi:
 So, these two guys are my brigade members.
 They do what I say, so if you want something, you can ask them.
 Time for some fun! Let's play dodge ball in the pool!

Kyon:
 We're coming.

 Oh well, sometimes deja vus happen.



Haruhi:
 I've been thinking of some fun things we could do!
 Check it out!

Kyon:
 What is that?

Haruhi:
 It's a schedule of how we're gonna spend the rest of our summer vacation.
 I realized something, we've only got two more weeks of summer vacation left to go.
 That fact totally blew me away.
 We've done a lot of cool things, but we've only got so much time and there's a bazillion more things left to do.
 So, I say we gotta pick up the pace.

Kyon:
 We've got two weeks to do all that?

Haruhi:
 Mikuru, is there anything else you wanna do?

Mikuru:
 Umm... I think I'd like to try goldfish scooping.

Haruhi:
 Okay! Goldfish scooping it is.

Koizumi:
 Could I see the list you made?
 Hmm... Okay, thanks.

Haruhi:
 We'll start tomorrow!
 Do you guys know if there's a Bon festival happening anywhere or even a fireworks show?

Koizumi:
 I can check around for those.
 I'll call you if I find one.

Haruhi:
 Don't forget about goldfish scooping.
 After all, it's Mikuru's only request.

Koizumi:
 Okay, I'll get right on it.


Haruhi:
 That's it for today. See ya!

Koizumi:
 I'll be going to.

Mikuru:
 Me, too. Bye.


Kyon:
 Nagato!
 Hey sorry, it's nothing important or anything.
 So, how have you been? Is everything okay?

Yuki:
 It is.

Kyon:
 Oh, good.

 What was that all about? Why'd I wanna talk to her?



Announcement:
May I have your attention, please. We have a lost child, Takashi Satou, five years old is xxx Hanshin Tigers...

Kyon:
 A Bon festival, huh? Figures there'd be so crowded.
 Ugh... That tower, those venders...
 I haven't been to a Bon festival in a while, but... it feels like I just went to one.

Haruhi:
 Mikuru! They have goldfish scooping over there, just like you wanted!
 Come on! You're gonna catch a ton!

Mikuru:
 O-Okay...

Koizumi:
 Do you wanna go scoop some fish, too? We could have a contest.

Kyon:
 Think I'll pass.
 How about you, Nagato? You wanna go get some food?
 I didn't know you were into this kind of stuff.
 I got it.

Yuki:
 No.
 That one.

Stallkeeper:
Sure. 800 yen.

Kyon:
 I wish she would've let me buy that for her.
 It's the least I could do after all she's done for us.


Haruhi:
 Thirteen fish! It's like the most unbelievable haul ever!
 But I don't have any place to put 'em all, so I just kept one and I gave another one to Mikuru.
 Go ahead and have one, but only one.

Kyon:
 Thanks.

Haruhi:
 Hey, Yuki. What's up with the mask you got there?

Yuki:
 I bought it.

Haruhi:
 Oh, okay.


Kyon:
 It was summer, and summer vacation.
 I guess that's why I wanted to forget about it.
 Truth was, I couldn't ignore it any longer.

 Haruhi, I don't wanna spoil your fun, but did you finish your homework?

Haruhi:
 Are you kidding? That stuff was totally easy. You can finish it in like three days.

Kyon:
 Three days!?

Haruhi:
 You have to get rid of that junk first, so you can spend the rest of your summer having fun and not worrying about it.

Kyon:
 Why does she have to be so smart?
 The folks upstairs weren't terribly fair when they were divvying up the stats for us.

Haruhi:
 You guys! Tomorrow, we're gonna go catch some bugs!
 And the prize for whoever catches the most bugs is gonna be...
 Umm... I know they get to be Brigade Leader for a whole day!

Kyon:
 No thanks.

Koizumi:
 That sounds like a lot of fun.
 Can we catch just any random bug?

Haruhi:
 Umm, no. Only cicadas!
 In fact, I'm calling it the SOS Brigade's Cicada Catching Contest!



Kyon:
 The next day was beautiful, sunny and bright.
 In fact, it was the perfect day for us to have our SOS Brigade's Cicada Catching Contest.

 That's not a cicada, it... it's Yanbaru long-armed scarab!

 Although everyone caught bugs the best way they knew how, the winner of the contest ended up being, you guessed it, Haruhi.

Haruhi:
 It's important to follow the spirit of catch-and-release with these guys.
 You never know if we let 'em go now, they might come back and return the favor.

Kyon:
 What could a cicada do for me even if it did come back?

Haruhi:
 Hurry! Go back to the mountains!

Kyon:
 I sort of feel like Pandora when she opened her box.



Mikuru:
 W-Welcome to our store!

Kyon:
 We met the next day even though we had absolutely no idea what was going on.
 Our confusion continued as we stood outside the local supermarket wearing frog costumes and handing out balloons.

 Son of a...!

 It's a living.

 I feel like Unit-0 after it got hit by the beam.

Haruhi:
 Hey, guys! Awesome job today!

Kyon:
 What's with that special treatment?

Haruhi:
 You're the best!
 The manager's super grateful for all the hard work.

Kyon:
 Who cares how grateful he is? What about our pay?

Haruhi:
 There it is.

Kyon:
 Huh?

Haruhi:
 I've had my eye on this little guy for a long time now.

Kyon:
 We worked in the sun, sweat pouring down our foreheads, for that?

Haruhi:
 We'll keep him in the clubroom as a souvenir.
 Oh well, Mikuru. You have my permission to wear him whenever you want.
 Help yourself, okay?

Mikuru:
 Sure... uh...

Kyon:
 Yeah, what?

Koizumi:
 Oh, it's nothing.

Kyon:
 Don't stare at me.

Haruhi:
 Come on, Mikuru! You the cutest little froggy ever.
 Put him back on! You know you want to. xxx

Koizumi:
 Watch the popsicle, ladies.

Mikuru:
 Maybe later...



Kyon:
 Later that night, my peaceful slumber was interrupted by a phone call.

 The number you have dialed is no longer...

Mikuru:
 Ahh...

Kyon:
 Aghh! What the heck!?

Mikuru:
 Kyon...

Kyon:
 Miss Asahina? Is that you?

Mikuru:
 Yes, it's me.
 Something really bad... I don't know but...

Kyon:
 What's wrong?

Koizumi:
 Hello, it's Koizumi.

Kyon:
 How about you tell me what you're doing with Miss Asahina in the middle of the night?!

Koizumi:
 We have a situation here.
 Would it be possible for you to come meet us now?


Kyon:
 Miss Asahina! Is everything okay? What happened?

Mikuru:
 Oh, Kyon...
 I... I-I can't go back to the future!


Koizumi:
 I'll explain it the best I can.
 Currently, we're stuck in a time loop that seems to be infinite.

Kyon:
 It's hard to believe you're serious with you sitting there smiling like that.
 I mean, come on, Koizumi. Do you have any idea what you just said?

Koizumi:
 Yes, of course, I do, much more than I want to. Believe me.
 Earlier, I was having a chat with Miss Asahina.

Kyon:
 Next time you guys are chatting, call me!

Koizumi:
 And then suddenly, we came to the conclusion that there was something a little off about the current flow of time.
 But the truth is, Miss Asahina discovered it.
 Thanks to her, my suspicions were confirmed.

Kyon:
 What suspicions?

Koizumi:
 Humph. We're currently stuck in a time loop.
 We're reliving the same period of time over and over again.

Kyon:
 Yeah, you already said that.

Koizumi:
 We've been repeating every day between August the seventeenth through the thirty-first
 We're in the middle of what seems to be an endless summer vacation.

Kyon:
 Well, at least it's summer vacation anyway.

Koizumi:
 It's a never-ending endless summer vacation.
 The future doesn't exist in this world anymore.
 Time stops at September the first.

Kyon:
 And who's gonna believe such a thing?

Koizumi:
 Well, for starters, we were sort of hoping that you would believe it.

Mikuru:
 Umm... I think I can try to explain it. Okay, here goes.
 Because I had to "classified information", I used "classified information" to get in touch with the future.
 The thing is, I haven't gotten any "classified information" for about a week now, and that's kind of weird.
 I was so surprised, I "classified information," I really did.
 But it was "classified information" too... I don't know what to do...


Kyon:
 What about those closed spaces you were talking about before?
 Maybe we're trapped in one of those.

Koizumi:
 No, it's not one of those.
 A section of time has been torn away from time-space.
 At exactly midnight on August the thirty-first, everything will reset.
 Then, time reverts straight back to the morning of August the seventeenth.
 That's the process.

Kyon:
 What about our... No, wait. What about the whole world's memories?

Koizumi:
 Their memories are reset.
 Everyone's memory starts over from the beginning.

Kyon:
 Perfect. Another problem involving time.
 I guess that figures when there's a time traveler around.

Koizumi:
 No, Miss Asahina didn't have anything to do with this.

Kyon:
 Then what's causing it?

Koizumi:
 It's Miss Suzumiya.

Kyon:
 Phew...

Koizumi:
 I'm sure she doesn't even realize it.
 I think subconsciously she wants to have summer vacation last forever.

Kyon:
 You kidding. You're telling me she still hasn't had enough fun?

Koizumi:
 Yeah, that's what I think.
 Perhaps she feels there's something else that needs to happen before our summer vacation can really be over.

Kyon:
 You seem like you're kind of enjoying this. Do you wanna tell me why?

Koizumi:
 Please don't take that the wrong way.
 It's just, this explains the feelings of deja vu I've been having.
 But now that I think about it, those feelings were most likely the residuum of my memories from all the other instances where time had been reset.

Kyon:
 So, are we the only ones, or can other people feel this happening too?

Koizumi:
 It doesn't seem that way. You and I are exceptions to the rule, though.
 The only people who can sense this strangeness are the ones closest to Miss Suzumiya.

Kyon:
 But what about Haruhi? Does she have any idea about the stuff that's been going on?

Koizumi:
 No, I don't think she knows about it. Besides, it would be very bad for us if she did.
 But, there's someone else who was unaffected by the time loop or the feelings of deja vu we've been experiencing.
 This person remembers everything that's happened since this started.

Kyon:
 Is that true?

Yuki:
 It is.

Kyon:
 Then, you remember everything?

Yuki:
 I can.

Kyon:
 Okay then, how many times has this happened so far?

Yuki:
 This would be 15,521 times so far.

Kyon:
 15,521 times? Wait. What do you mean 15,521 times?

 And you being completely serious?

Yuki:
 I am.

Kyon:
 So then, you're saying that we've done the exact same things that many times every single time?

Yuki:
 Not necessarily.
 Throughout 15,521 repetitions, we did not attend a Bon festival the 2,391st time and 11,054th time.
 We went to a Bon festival but did not go to a goldfish scooping booth exactly 437 times.
 We obtained part-time jobs 9,048 times, and performed six different types of jobs.
 In addition to handing out balloons, we worked as movers, cashers, we handed out...

Kyon:
 Okay, I got it.

 15,521 times, that's what Nagato said, okay so, times two weeks, that's, uh... 'bout... 595 years!
 She's the only one who remembers everything we've done.
 And she had to repeat those same things over and over again.
 Nagato, what's it like to relive the same things that many times?

 That's gotta be the craziest story ever.



Haruhi:
 I wonder if they're real.

Kyon:
 What's real?

Haruhi:
 Martians.

Kyon:
 I kind of hope they aren't.

Haruhi:
 I can't see anyone on the surface right now, but I bet they're a reserved race of beings who have to live underground.
 Whenever us humans are finally able to land on Mars, I'm sure that Martians will pop out from wherever they're hiding and say something like "Welcome to Mars!"

Kyon:
 I don't think they should pop out.

Haruhi:
 Uh... this is boring. I'm gonna look for some UFOs now.

Kyon:
 That night, we went stargazing.
 We're on the balcony of Nagato's apartment, since her place had the best view.
 Koizumi brought a telescope.


Kyon:
 I wish I knew what else she wants to do?

Koizumi:
 Well, that's the question, isn't it?
 If we knew the answer, we could solve this thing.
 I have an idea we can try if you want.
 What if someone were to suddenly grab Miss Suzumiya from behind, and then whispered "I love you" right into her ear?

Kyon:
 And who's gonna be doing the whispering?

Koizumi:
 Is there anyone who could play that role other than you?

Kyon:
 Hmm... Yeah, no thanks.

Koizumi:
 All right, then, how about if I do it?
 Of course, I'm kidding. I don't think I can pull that off.
 And besides, it would just confuse Miss Suzumiya in the end.



Kyon:
 Hey, Nagato.
 You knew about this time loop before Miss Asahina figured it out, didn't you?

Yuki:
 I did.

Kyon:
 So then, how come you didn't say anything about it?

Yuki:
 My function is to observe.

Kyon:
 I see.



Kyon:
 We kept chugging along doing all kinds of summer vacation things.
 We went to a real firework show, and we even signed up for a goby fishing tournament.
 We went to the batting cages, we watched some movies, went to the beach, bowling, karaoke. Hm, yeah, we were always doing something.
And the whole time, all I could think was that none of that was going to be enough for Haruhi.
 But what could I do about it? Nothing.
 So, I just bit my lip and watched the last days of our summer... oogh, vacation... went by. Ohh!
 And then, before I knew it, August the thirtieth... was here... oh...


Haruhi:
 That's it. We've done everything on our list.
 Hey, don't mess that up.
 Hmm... but now I'm wondering if we did enough.
 Oh well. Yeah, I guess we did do a lot of stuff... unless there's something else you guys wanna do.
 Oh, okay then. I guess we did pretty much everything we set out to do, so that's good enough.

Kyon:
 No, it's not. You're still not satisfied.

Haruhi:
 That's it, then. We're all done for today.
 I set tomorrow aside just in case, but I guess you can go ahead and take the day off now.
 Okay, I'll see you guys at the clubroom on Monday.

Kyon:
 Wait, Haruhi...!

Haruhi:
 That's it, then. We're all done for today.
 I set tomorrow aside just in case, but I guess you can go ahead and take the day off now.
 Okay, I'll see you guys at the clubroom on Monday.

Kyon:
 I can't let Haruhi leave.
 If I let her walk out the door, we'll end up reliving the past two weeks again and again for a thousand more times.

Haruhi:
 That's it, then. We're all done for today.
 I set tomorrow aside just in case, but I guess you can go ahead and take the day off now.
 Okay, I'll see you guys at the clubroom on Monday.

Kyon:
 What should I do? What should I say?
 There must have been a clue in something Haruhi said.
 But what was it? What's she been saying all this time?
 I don't know. I can't... remember...

Haruhi:
 That's it, then. We're all done for today.
 I set tomorrow aside just in case, but I guess you can go ahead and take the day off now.
 Okay, I'll see you guys at the clubroom on Monday.


Kyon:
 Whatever... doesn't matter.
 It's August the thirty-first.
 And I still haven't touched my homework.
 Who cares? There's no point doing it.
 And we're just gonna keep reliving the last couple of weeks.
 Whatever happens next, whether tomorrow comes or not, a different version of me will have to do with it.
