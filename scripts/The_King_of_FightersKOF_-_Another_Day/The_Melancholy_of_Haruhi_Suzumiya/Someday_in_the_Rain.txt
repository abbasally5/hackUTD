  Kyon:
The arts festival and its chaotic aftermath are over.
The mountain wind's beginning to whip up, and you can just hear the footsteps of winter drawing ever closer.
December is almost upon us.
Now, this old building, also known as the clubroom wing, has been here since the school was built.
And thanks in part to its thin walls, even though you're inside, you could still feel the chill right down to your bones.



Kyon:
The SOS Brigade always seems to get involved with strange things.
Well, actually, I'm the one getting involved with strange things.
But even so, it's not like something weird has to happen to us on a daily basis.
Besides, if life dropped a crazy bomb on me every day, my body wouldn't take it, it would just crumble.
It would be even worse for my mood.
Still, when Haruhi isn't around, it's really quiet--it's kinda nice.
Then again, maybe it's a bit too quiet.
Come to think of it, it's been six months since I first met Haruhi, Miss Asahina and the others.
We've been through a lot together.
And sure, Haruhi's provoked a lot of it, but not necessarily all of it.
Well, either way, one thing's for sure.
It was always at times like this, when we were just kicking back and relaxing, that Haruhi would burst through that door.

Haruhi:
Everyone, listen up! I've got some really good news!

Kyon:
What? Again?
Whenever Haruhi describes something's being good, news or otherwise, rarely has there ever been a case.
And that's especially true for Miss Asahina and myself.

What is it this time?

Haruhi:
I've got everything all set up to get us a heater for this icebox of the room.

Mikuru:
Oh, your tea.

Haruhi:
You know that appliance store that sponsored our movie?
Well, I just got the owner to give us a heater for free!
He called me up and said he had an extra heater he wanted to get rid of.
It's a model from last year, and it's been sitting in storage so long, they forgot they had it.

Kyon:
I just can't believe there's an appliance store owner out there who's both willing and kind enough to call Haruhi and offer her anything.
I'm sure she must have forced the owner somehow.

Haruhi:
Okay, Kyon! I want you to go to the store and pick it up for us right now.

Kyon:
Right now?
Right now-now?

Haruhi:
Right. You, now! Right now!

Kyon:
Let me get this straight.
You want me to go down the mountain, the one I have to climb up and down every morning.
You want me to go down that thing right now to an appliance store that is two whole train stations away, pick up a heater then lug that thing back here?

Haruhi:
That's right.
'Cause if you don't, the guy might change his mind and then we're out of free heater.
Don't complain! Just hurry up and go!
You're bored anyway, aren't ya?

Kyon:
Oh, that's great.
Sitting in this room is enough to label you as being bored.
Nice...

Aren't you bored? Why don't you do it?

Haruhi:
I can't!
There's something important I need to take care of right now.
Koizumi is the deputy chief, and you're just a rank and file member.
That's the deal in every group I know of, the grunts always work their butts up.
Naturally, the SOS Brigade totally supports that policy.

Kyon:
Oh, well...
For once, Haruhi's made a reasonable request.
I gave up.
Besides, I was just thinking how this place'd use a heater anyway.
If she's going to force Miss Asahina or Nagato to go, then I'll go.

Kyon:
All right. I'm going.

Koizumi:
Please do be careful out there.

Mikuru:
Uh, should I go with you?

Haruhi:
That'll be fine at all, Mikuru. Stay here.
Kyon's duty as a Brigade member's to handle all the chores.

Mikuru:
Oh...

Mikuru:
Hold on.
I heard it's going to be chilly today.

Kyon:
Thank you.

Haruhi:
Hurry up and go!
Go on and get going!



Haruhi:
Well, now that he is out of the way...

Mikuru:
Huh?

Haruhi:
Mikuru, I want to take a couple of pictures of you.
Do you mind posing?

Mikuru:
What are those pictures gonna be for?

Haruhi:
It's for the DVD!
I'm gonna make a DVD of "The Adventure of Mikuru Asahina," and I still need to shoot a sexy cover for it.

Mikuru:
Whoa... you mean you're really going to go through with that?
But I thought you said you weren't going to.

Haruhi:
I just said that 'cause Kyon was nagging me about it.
But now that I got rid of him, nothing's gonna stop me!



Kyon:
The first day, I had to climb this hill to get to school, I hated it.
But after walking up and down the thing for the last six months, I've gotten used to it.
I've gotten used to A "hiking to and from school", and B "the SOS Brigade."
Funny how that works.
Hmm... I wonder what Haruhi's doing right now, since I'm not around.
I just hope she's not bored and treating Miss Asahina like some kind of toy or something.



Haruhi:
Koizumi, pull the bounce card for me.

Koizumi:
Right, got it.

Haruhi:
Mikuru, stop spacing out!
Pose! Come on, pose! Pose!

Mikuru:
Uh... okay...

Haruhi:
Come on! Smile like you're flirting with a cute guy!
More seductive, come on!
That's not gonna court for the male fans, get sultry, girl!

Cool! Costume change!
Put this one on.
Come on! Stop squirming!
Mikuru, come on! Let's go!
Put it on!

Mikuru:
No! I can do it myself!

Haruhi:
Like I haven't seen it before.
Here, it's faster if I help!

Mikuru:
No, no, my bra too?

Haruhi:
Well, you're gonna have to take it off anyway.
Mikuru! Wow, those things are even bigger.
You look dynamite, girl!

Mikuru:
It's cold.
Where are you touching...

Koizumi:
Oh, that's not good, my tea's gone cold.

Mikuru:
It's really cold in here.
Could we stop now?
This is so embarrassing.

Haruhi:
Mikuru, you need to have a little more confidence in yourself.
You're the best mascot on campus!
I wouldn't picture you if you didn't have what it takes, right Koizumi?

Koizumi:
It's exactly as you say.

Haruhi:
Okay, next! Try this!

Mikuru:
Huh? Again? No!
I... I can do that myself...

Haruhi:
Hurry up!
We have to finish shooting this stuff today.
Come on!

Put this one on next!

Mikuru:
But, this nurse outfit and that one, um, I don't really remember wearing either one of them in the movie.
Are these pictures we're taking really for the cover of the DVD?

Haruhi:
Yeah, of course they are.
But I just came up with another idea.
With all these photos, we can publish a picture book!
What do you think about that, Koizumi?

Koizumi:
I think it's a great idea.

Haruhi:
No, wait!
The DVD needs a bonus picture section.
We can put these pictures there!
What do think about that idea, Koizumi?

Koizumi:
I think it's a fantastic idea.

Haruhi:
Stick your arm in there, good.
Now turn around, nice.

Koizumi:
Looks like we might be in for a little bit rain today, doesn't it?

Haruhi:
Good, next outfit!

Mikuru:
What? We've got that outfit?

Haruhi:
[Dairy]!

Mikuru:
No, I need that!

Haruhi:
There!
I want a shot of you flashing some panty at us(xxx).
So these have to go! And(xxx) soon!
This is so fun, taking all your clothes off.



Omori:
Well, it's the heater I promised her.
Can you carry it back, okay?

Kyon:
Oh, yeah, I think I can manage.

Omori:
And about the girls, how are those three cutie-pies doing these days?

Kyon:
Pretty good.
But the energetic one's starting to get on my nerves.
The commercial help business any?

Omori:
Honestly, I haven't seen any difference so far.

Kyon:
Figures.
Putting a commercial in the middle of a movie showing at a high school arts festival isn't what you call a stroke of marketing genius.
I'm surprised this guy actually sponsored it.

Omori:
That reminds me, when the energetic one called today, she mentioned something about the sequel.
Is it true?
Are you really going to make another movie?

Kyon:
Well, if she says we're making another movie, we're making another movie.

Omori:
She asked if I wanted to sponsor it and I told her I'd be happy to, so...
So I guess you can consider this heater my donation to your next cinematic wonder.

Kyon:
So, that's how she got it.
Guess I'll head back now.
Thank you very much for the heater.

Omori:
No worries. Take care!



Amoebas are red,a-i-u-e-o.
Little shrimp and floating moss swimming to and fro.
Permission tree, chestnut tree, ka-ki-ku-ke-ko.
A woodpecker pecking at a dead zelkova tree just so.
Pour some vinegar on cowpeas sa-shi-su-se-so.
I stabbed a fish in the stream that was very very shallow.
We all stand up when the trumpet blows, ta-chi-tsu-te-to.
When we stood it flew off with a thunk-thunk-thunk-thunk-boom.
The slug crawls very slow all day, na-ni-nu-ne-no. (Na-ni-nu-ne-no!)

A-ha! So you are the culprit.

Oh, the red player has picked #14. Very well, I wonder how that's going to affect the game today. Next question!

Amazing! Just by showing up she changed the atmosphere on the stage. But she seem completely different, doesn't she? She's not the same as she was a few minutes ago. What a terrifying little girl!

Tanmen noodle set! Fried rice set! Tempure and cold soba set!

Young Man Ace! Middle-aged Ace! Retirement Ace! Nonpromoted Ace! Next-year Ace! Unfortunate Ace! I love it after all, Ace!
Why don't you do your best to beat me? Bring it on!
What you guys have done is snappy, cracky, and totally obvious to us!

He looks like a child, but he's pretty subtle of the inside. A powerful ally all over town.

Bow down, bow down! Can you not see this crest that I hold!

Because I am the queeeeeeeen of the France.

Now that hit a weird spot. You've still got a ways to go.

Domo! We're the Arctic Sea Ice Candies!

Thank.

You know, Yuki. You are sexy as ever.

Where are you looking, pervert. And I call the cops.

Starting with the low blow? I feel like I xxx groping xxx running crowded train.

Yeah, by the way, it's winter now.

Right, it's winter. And speaking of winter...

Baseball's off-season.

xxx pointer, Yuki. xxx WBC are shaking in the xxx

I'm really looking for xxx who gets the pink slip.

That's really dark xxx enjoying it. But okay. Well, you know? It's almost Christmas, isn't it?

I wanna eat a hot pot.

Right! You can do with a hot pot winter.

What do you put in your hot pot?

Let's see. Nappa cabbage, chicken, pork, leek, natto, tofu. Oh, what about you, Yuki?

Brown bear.

Wow! Yuki, you're a hunter? Even matagi will cry and run away!

Yeah. But I think about hunted bear feels, I feel sorry for him xxx

Don't put it in your hot pot to begin with, woman.

I'll play the part of brown bear.

What? You will?

And you play the pot.
Here it comes, folks! The worst comedy xxx history great...



Taniguchi:
Hey Kyon,
What are you lurking around down here for?

Kyon:
It's obvious, isn't it?
I'm carrying stuff around.

Taniguchi:
Ha, you sure are a hard worker.
You're running errands for Suzumiya, aren't you?

Kyon:
I guess six months was all that took for my classmates to fully comprehend this situation that I've got myself into.

Kunikida:
Are you taking that thing back to school?
Oh wow, you're a hard worker.

Kyon:
You're telling me.

Taniguchi:
Well, see you!

Kyon:
Yeah.

Kunikida:
See you tomorrow!

Kyon:
Hm.

Kyon:
Damn, now it's gonna start raining.
The weather forecast said there was only a ten percent chance of rain today.
Yet another thing that can't be trusted.
I hope it doesn't turn into a downpour.

Koizumi:
Oh, it looks like it started raining.

Mikuru:
I wonder if Kyon's all right.

Kyon:
I've never wanted to be in that room more than I do now.
The first thing I'm gonna do is grab myself a cup of Miss Asahina's tea and warm up my body, or warm up my heart.



Tsuruya:
Yahoo, hey, is Mikuru here?
Nagato, are you the only one here?
I wanna see if she'll trade cleaning duties with me tomorrow.
So I came to ask her.
Do you know where she is?

Nagato:
...

Tsuruya:
Oh, she's over there, huh.
Cool, thanks!



Kyon:
Oh brother...

Tsuruya:
Hey Kyon, were you out running errands again?

Kyon:
Miss Tsuruya.

Tsuruya:
That's why.

Kyon:
Huh? What do you mean?

Tsuruya:
No, nothing at all!
You hard worker.
Hmm... you're soaked to the bone.
Hm, here!

Kyon:
Thank you.

Tsuruya:
Well, see ya!
Just give my handkerchief to Mikuru when you'll return her scarf.

Kyon:
I don't think that I'll ever get what's going on in that girl's head.
She's a nice person though, I'd say that.



Kyon:
Oh, Nagato.
You're the only one here?

So, where's Haruhi and the others?



Mikuru:
Ya!

Haruhi:
Yeah, now, that's how you're supposed to land your butt, we got it?
Moving on!

Mikuru:
Ouch!

Haruhi:
I'm in awe of your clumsiness.
Are you doing this on purpose?
Koizumi, take over for me.

This is how you do it. Like this!



Kyon:
I'm a little worried about where the three of them are, and what they are doing right now.
But schlepping the rotten heater up that hill really wore me out.
The worst part is, I'm gonna have to go right back down that hill again when I go home. How nice top is that? (xxx)
Come on, come on, come on.
Man, my hands are so cold.

I'm just tired.

Haruhi:
Uh...

Kyon:
Oh, Haruhi, it's only you.

Haruhi:
Yeah, so?
Is that a problem?

Kyon:
No, I don't have a problem with it.
You didn't go and draw something silly(xxx) on my face this time, did you?

Haruhi:
Of course not.
I'm not a little kid, Kyon.

Kyon:
Hey, where's everybody else?

Haruhi:
It didn't look like you were gonna wake up anytime soon, so they all went home.

Kyon:
But you could've just gone home.
Why did you stay behind?

Haruhi:
I couldn't really help it!
You were still sleeping.
What do you want me to do?
I gotta lock the door before I leave.
Besides, it's still raining out there.

Kyon:
Uh...

Haruhi:
Okay, hand it over.

Kyon:
Huh?

Haruhi:
My cardigan!

Kyon:
Uh, oh...

Okay, so that one belongs to Haruhi.
But, who does the other sweater belong to?
Whoa, that means that Miss Asahina was changing clothes right next to me while I was sleeping.
Damn it! Why did I have to fall asleep?
If I'd pretended to be asleep, I could've seen...

Haruhi:
Well, everyone left school a while ago.
Come on, let's get out of here.

Kyon:
Okay, I'm kinda stuck though.
I didn't bring an umbrella with me today.

Haruhi:
One will be enough for the two of us.



Haruhi:
Ain't that thing over here more.
I'm getting all wet.

Kyon:
But you've got a ton of umbrella over there.
Ah! Oh, nice one, this isn't even yours.
This thing's got "faculty" stenciled on it.

Haruhi:
If it belongs to the school, so there shouldn't be anything wrong with a couple of students using it, right?
What? You wanna go home all sopping wet?
Fine, then I won't let you use it.

Kyon:
Jeez, I went to all the trouble bringing the heater back, and little Miss Brigade leader over there can't even say "thank you."
Typical Haruhi...

Hey, wait up!
