Kyon:
 It was summer.
 But with finals looming, my usually chipper mood was out wandering around Brazil or somewhere, and it wasn't coming back anytime soon.

Haruhi:
 Hey, Kyon. Do you know what today is?

Kyon:
 Is it your birthday?

Haruhi:
Guess again!

Kyon:
 Miss Asahina's birthday?

Haruhi:
Wrong.

Kyon:
 Koizumi or Nagato's birthday?

Haruhi:
I don't even know when those are!

Kyon:
 Since we're on the subject, my birthday is on the...

Haruhi:
Yeah, whatever.
 You have absolutely no idea what an important day today is, do you?

Kyon:
It's just another hot weekday to me, if you wanna know the truth.

Haruhi:
Okay. Tell me what today's date is.

Kyon:
It's the seventh of July...
 Now I get it. You've been talking about Tanabata this whole time, haven't you?

Haruhi:
That's what I'm talking about! Today's Tanabata!
 Come on! You're Japanese, you have to remember this kind of stuff!

Kyon:
My bad.

Haruhi:
Every year, I make it a point to get involved with activities like this.
 But this year, the SOS Brigade will make it the biggest event ever!

Kyon:
Here we go...


Kyon:
Since this spring, whenever Haruhi sank her teeth into something, I found myself aimlessly running around.
 You could say it'll become my daily routine.
 I was getting used to it, and I hated that.

Mikuru:
 Come in.

Kyon:
 Hey guys.

Mikuru:
Oh, hello.

Koizumi:
 Hello. How's your day so far?

Kyon:
A little crazy, just like everyday since I started high school.

Mikuru:
 Here.

Kyon:
 Thanks. I needed that.

Mikuru:
Why, you're very welcome.

Koizumi:
Wanna try something new?

Kyon and Mikuru:
Hm?

Koizumi:
You know, at some point, we're gonna get bored playing othello.

Kyon:
Yeah. Sorry, but I don't know the rules.

Koizumi:
Oh, that's too bad.

Kyon:
You know, who's come up with another harebrained scheme. This is probably our last chance to relax... Ugh...

Haruhi:
Hey ho! I know, I know, I'm sorry I'm so late!

Kyon:
What's with the weird greeting and that thing?

Haruhi:
I found it in the forest.

Kyon:
Then it's considered private property, you bamboo thief.

Haruhi:
Look, I also made tanzaku, so everyone has to write their wishes on 'em!

Mikuru:
Tanzaku?

Koizumi:
That's right. Today is Tanabata, isn't it?

Haruhi:
But first, there're conditions.

Kyon:
What conditions? I don't recall anyone agreeing to anything yet.

Haruhi:
Hey Kyon, I bet you don't know who makes everybody's wishes come true during Tanabata?

Kyon:
 Orihime and Hikoboshi?

Haruhi:
Lucky guess. That's ten points.
 But, do you know which stars represent Orihime and Hikoboshi?

Kyon:
 I don't.

Koizumi:
It's Vega and Altair.

Haruhi:
Correct, sir! That's why you hang your tanzaku to face them! eighty-five points!

Kyon:
 Mind telling us where the other fifteen points went?

Haruhi:
Ahem!
 First of all, according to the theory of relativity, it's not possible to travel faster than the speed of light.
 The distance from the Earth to Vega is twenty-five light years, and to Altair is sixteen.
 That means any information that leaves Earth is going to take at least that much time to reach those stars!

Kyon:
 I can't believe you actually researched this stuff.

Haruhi:
That's why when you make a wish, it'll take such a long time for the gods to make it come true.
 For example, if you wanna have a boyfriend by this Christmas, he won't show up [there] in time.

Kyon:
If it takes that long for a wish to go one way, wouldn't it take fifty or thirty-two years to make it back?

Haruhi:
Yeah, but they're gods, so I'm sure they have a way to get around it--like a half-price summer bargain.

Kyon:
So, what happened to the " theory of relativity?"

Haruhi:
There's a tanzaku for Vega and one for Altair.
 So, the trick is to make wishes you want to come true twenty-five or sixteen years from now!

Kyon:
How can we know what we're doing twenty-five or even sixteen years from now?
 What the heck are we supposed to wish for?
 She's always coming up with these irrational activities for us to do.
 I keep wondering, which part of the universe does she get her idea of "normal" from?

Koizumi:
Don't be so quick to judge.
 Despite her actions, Miss Suzumiya has a firm grasp of what "normal" is.

Kyon:
 How can you be so sure about that?

Koizumi:
Well, for one thing, she wants the world to be a bit more exciting and unusual.
 And she has the power to reshape the world according to her whims.
 Also, the world hasn't lost its rationality yet, has it? That's how I can be so sure.

Haruhi:
Hey! Cut out the whispering!


Kyon:
 I don't know if she's got the hang of this thing.

Koizumi:
I'm afraid mine are a little ordinary.

Haruhi:
Yeah, that's pathetic.

Kyon:
 Shut it.

That settles it, mine are better than yours.

Haruhi:
It's apples and oranges.

Make sure you guys remember the wishes you made today.
 It's only sixteen years to the first batch comes true.
 And then, we're gonna see whose wish Hikoboshi grants first!

Kyon:
 (Sigh)

Haruhi:
sixteen years is a long time though...

Kyon:
 Hm?

After that, Haruhi was strangely quiet, dare I say, a bit melancholy.
 In a way, the fact she was so calm was a little unnerving.
 And the quieter she was, the more worried I became.

Mikuru:
Would you like me to pour you another cup?

Kyon:
Oh sure, I'd love one.
 Huh?

Mikuru:
 Shh.

Kyon:
So cute. Now.
 You know I will.


Haruhi:
I'm going home. The last one out should lock the door.

Koizumi:
I'll be going, too.

Kyon:
Lucky me, lucky me.
 Ah? Hey...

Koizumi:
Well, see you later.

Kyon:
 Okay.

Mikuru:
Thank goodness. I thought they'd never leave us alone.

Kyon:
Why? Is it something you don't want the others to hear?

Mikuru:
Um... yes.
 There's a... a place I sort of wanna take you to.

Kyon:
Sure. Where you wanna go?

Mikuru:
Well, uh... It's three years... ago...

Kyon:
Three...

Mikuru:
I'm sorry, I know it sounds really strange, but...
 Well..., will you go?

Kyon:
So, we'd be time traveling, then?

Mikuru:
Yes, that's right.

Kyon:
I don't have a problem going with you or anything, but why me? What for?

Mikuru:
I can't say now, but when we get there... maybe.
 Please don't ask me anything else, just say you'll go with me!
 Because if you don't go, then I'll... get in trouble.

Kyon:
So cute!
 Well, uh... Okay, sure. I'll go.

Mikuru:
Really? Thank you!

Kyon:


Mikuru:
Uh... Thank goodness...

Kyon:
Come to think of it, my knowledge of Miss Asahina's time traveling was based solely upon her word.
 And the only proof I have was that I met the adult version of her.
 This is my chance to confirm whether she was really a girl from the future, or not.

 Okay, show me the way to your time machine.

Mikuru:
We'll leave from here.

Kyon:
From here?


Mikuru:
Kyon... Sorry.

Kyon:
Uh...



Mikuru:
Oh, you're awake.
 Uh... I was sort of hoping you'd be waking up soon, because my legs are getting numb.

Kyon:
Huh?! Aagh!!
 Uh, why was I sleeping in your lap?

Mikuru:
Sorry about that, but I can't let you see how time travel happens, because it's classified.
 So, er, are you mad?

Kyon:
No, not at all. I mean, if Haruhi tried to do that to me, I'd probably smack her.
 But since it's you, it's no biggy.

Mikuru:
 Thank goodness.

Kyon:
Are you sure that right now's really three years ago?

Mikuru:
July the seventh, three years ago. It's about 9:00 PM.

Kyon:
You sure about that?

Mikuru:
Really sure.

Kyon:
Yeah... Hmm...

 I know this park. It's where Nagato told me to meet her that one time.
 Is this a Mecca for weirdos or something?

 Huh? Miss Asahina? Um...

 Okay, calm down. Should I? Should I not?

Mikuru (adult version):
Hello, Kyon. It's me.

Kyon:
Miss Asahina.

Mikuru (adult version):
So this was how I looked while I was sleeping and everything.
 All she had to do was get you to come to this point and time.
 It's going to be my job now to guide you along from here on.

Kyon:
Okay. But you put her to sleep, how come?

Mikuru (adult version):
When I was here, I didn't meet the adult version of me.
 That's why I couldn't let her see me here, in this time plane anyway.

Kyon:
Huh...

Mikuru (adult version):
If you just follow the railroad tracks, you'll come to a school.
 You're going to have to help the person you'll find at the gates.
 And, you also have to carry that version of me along with you.

Kyon:
This feels like going on a quest in a game.
 After I'm done, do I get something like a reward?

Mikuru (adult version):
A reward, huh? Let's see...
 I'm actually not supposed to give you anything.
 Although, if you really want to, you can give that version of me a kiss.
 But only while she's sleeping, okay?

Kyon:
That's a... little...

 Under the circumstances, this goes completely against my principles.
 Yeah, well, sort of...

Mikuru (adult version):
That's it. It's time for me to go now.
 You're going to have to keep me a secret from her, too, okay?
 Promise me. Let's pinky-swear.

Kyon:
Uh...

Mikuru (adult version):
Now, it's official.
 I'll see you later then, Kyon. Bye-bye.

Kyon:
I wonder how much time have passed for the adult Miss Asahina since the last time I saw her.
 I couldn't really tell if she changed that much, if at all.
 So, now I'm starting to wonder, is this really three years ago?
 I need to confirm this, somehow. Maybe I should call information or something.

 East Junior High. Ugh... Hey!



Haruhi (junior version):
What? Who are you?

Kyon:
Okay. Now I'm sure I've gone back three years.
 That's Haruhi Suzumiya, the seventh grade version.

Haruhi (junior version):
Are you gonna tell me who you are or what? Pervert? Kidnapper?

Kyon:
What do you think you're doing over there?

Haruhi (junior version):
Isn't it obvious? Breaking and entering.

Kyon:
She's committing a crime and announcing it. How am I supposed to react?

Haruhi (junior version):
I don't know who you are, and I really don't care, just gimme a hand.
'Cause if you don't, and I'll call the cops.

Kyon:
Yep, that's Haruhi. No mistake.

Haruhi (junior version):
This way.

Kyon:
Good thing's it's dark out.
 She won't be able to get a good look at me or Miss Asahina.
 Since this, Haruhi from three years ago doesn't remember us.
 I sort of feel I need to keep it that way.

Haruhi (junior version):
I got this from the storage room after school and hid it.
 Pretty smart, huh?

Kyon:
I can handle that thing. You go grab the line marker.

Haruhi (junior version):
Huh? Hm.

Kyon:
Hm?


Kyon:
Well, whatcha gonna do with this thing?

Haruhi (junior version):
You're gonna draw lines where I tell you.

Kyon:
 Who me?

Haruhi (junior version):
Yeah, that's right, you.
 I am the supervisor of this project.

Hey, that line's all crooked! What are you doing!?

Kyon:
Ordering around a high schooler she just met without any hesitation is so very Haruhi.
 Now, if I met this girl back when I was going to junior high, I guarantee I would have thought she was a-hundred percent nuts, no joke.
 So, I ran around and drew white lines on the ground wherever Haruhi told me to draw them.
 I remember Taniguchi telling me about the mysterious message, never dreamed I'd be the one who drew it...


Haruhi (junior version):
Yeah, I guess it'll do.

Kyon:
Whatever...

Haruhi (junior version):
So, do you think aliens are real or not?

Kyon:
That's sort of random?

Haruhi (junior version):
Just answer the question.

Kyon:
I guess they are.

Haruhi (junior version):
And time travelers?

Kyon:
I wouldn't doubt those, either.

Haruhi (junior version):
How about espers?

Kyon:
I'm sure they're lurking around every corner.

Haruhi (junior version):
What about sliders?

Kyon:
 I haven't met any of those guys yet.

Haruhi (junior version):
Hmm... Is that a North High uniform?

Kyon:
 Uh-huh.

Haruhi (junior version):
What's your name, anyway?

Kyon:
It's John Smith.

Haruhi (junior version):
You're such a dork.

Kyon:
Let's just say I wanna remain anonymous.

Haruhi (junior version):
Who's the girl you were carrying?

Kyon:
She's my big sister. And she has these sudden fits of narcolepsy.
 She just falls asleep wherever, so I have to carry her sometimes.

Haruhi (junior version):
 Hmph!

Kyon:
Anyway, what's that thing supposed to be?

Haruhi (junior version):
What do you think it looks like? It's a message.

Kyon:
A message for Orihime or Hikoboshi, right?

Haruhi (junior version):
Okay, how'd you know that?

Kyon:
Well, it is Tanabata. And I remember someone I know doing something similar once.

Haruhi (junior version):
Oh, yeah? I'd love to meet someone like that. Does that person go to North High, too?

Kyon:
Sort of.

Haruhi (junior version):
Hmm... North High...
 I'm done. I'm going home now. See ya.

Kyon:
She didn't even thank me for helping her. Typical.


Kyon:
 Miss Asahina.

Mikuru:
...it's class-fi-... uh...?
 Ah!? W-W-W-Where am I!? What happened and when is it right now!?

Kyon:
Well, um...

Mikuru:
Aw!
 I don't have my TPDD anymore...

Kyon:
 Huh?

Mikuru:
I don't have it... Aaaaah!

Kyon:
What's wrong? What's a "TPDD" anyway?

Mikuru:
It's classified, but it's sort of like a time machine.

Kyon:
 Where do you think it could've gone?

Mikuru:
 I don't know. I should have it, but I've lost it.

Kyon:
 Is there anybody who could come pick us up?

Mikuru:
There isn't...

Kyon:
Okay, so what's gonna happen to us, then?

Mikuru:
We're stuck. We're stuck in this time plane three years in the past with no way of getting home!
 And we can't get back to our time!

Kyon:
 That sounds pretty serious.

Mikuru:
Super serious... Aaagh!

Kyon:
For some reason, I wasn't concerned about our situation.
 That TPDD-thing was probably taken by the adult Miss Asahina.
 In fact, that's probably why she was here... to make sure this version of her actually lost the TPDD-thing and... Uh!

 Everything's gonna be okay.

Mikuru:
Huh?



Kyon:
Does Miss Yuki Nagato live here?
 Uh... I'm not really sure how to say what I'm about to say but...
 What if I told you that I'm an acquaintance of Haruhi Suzumiya?


Kyon:
Howdy?
 Is it okay if we come in?

That's pretty much it. Now you know who we are and why we're here.
 Oh, and the you from three years in the future gave me this.

Yuki:
 Understood.

Kyon:
As far as everything goes, this is the first time you've met the two of us, right?

Yuki:
Yes. I have accessed the memory of the unit in the other time plane.
 And I have downloaded the data from the opposite side of the linked time boundary.
 The unit that exists three years from now and I are the same being.
 As such, we have access to each other's memories--our memories are shared.

Kyon:
 Really? How?

Yuki:
We synced.

Kyon:
Wait. I don't understand.

 Why are you wearing a North High uniform? Have you enrolled already?

Yuki:
Not yet. I am currently in standby mode.

Kyon:
What? So you're gonna be in standby mode for three years?

Yuki:
 Yes.

Kyon:
That's a really long time to be in standby mode.

Yuki:
It is my role.
 There is more than one way to travel through time.
 The TPDD is not the only device that can do it.
 It is imperfect.

Mikuru:
But, um... how is it imperfect?

Yuki:
When an organic life form uses the TPDD, the movement created by the event causes noise.
 We believe it is imperfect and primitive.

Kyon:
 By "we," you mean that Thought Entity thing?

Mikuru:
So Miss Nagato, when you travel through time, you can do it perfectly?

Yuki:
Perfection does not matter, as long as data can travel unobstructed.

Kyon:
Ah!?

Mikuru:
 Eek!?

Kyon:
D-Do you want us to sleep in here? Us? Together?

Yuki:
Yes.

Kyon:
Me and Miss Asahina?

Yuki:
Yes.
 Lie down.

Kyon:
 Just like that?!

Yuki:
Just sleep.

Kyon:
I wouldn't have any other way, however...
 I guess we don't have any other choice, do we?

Mikuru:
Uh-huh...

Kyon:
Ah...!
 Uh! huh?

Mikuru:
 Uh, no way!

Kyon:
Are you okay? What's that? The TPDD?

Mikuru:
No, it's not. It's just my radio wave watch.
 We're back in our time, thank goodness.
 It's just after 9:30, July the seventh, the day we left.

Kyon:
How did you do it?

Yuki:
I suspended the flow of data inside this time-space.
 Then I released it at a predetermined point in the time-space continuum.

Mikuru:
You mean you actually stopped time?

Kyon:
 Huh?

Mikuru:
Miss Nagato's saying she stopped time in this room for the past three years.
 And when today came around, she started time up again, is that right?

Yuki:
Yes.

Mikuru:
 I can't believe it!

Kyon:
If that's true, then that means on the night when I came over and you told me you were an alien and stuff, Miss Asahina and I were sleeping in this room together the whole time?

Yuki:
Yes.

Kyon:
I was always impressed that how amazing you could be, but I didn't know you were omnipotent.

Yuki:
I am not. This was a special case. Emergency mode.
 Seldom activated unless necessary.


Kyon:
 Thank you.

Yuki:
You're welcome.

Kyon and Mikuru:
Hm?

Kyon:
Before we go, could you tell me what this says?

Yuki:
 "I am right here" is what it says.

Kyon:
Hold on a second. Are you telling me that this thing is written in the language used by aliens or something?

 Nagato didn't answer me.


Mikuru:
I'm sorry. It's just that... I don't really know too much.
 I'm just an assistant... No, an intern. Wait, no, I mean I'm kind of like a trainee...

Kyon:
But even so, you get to stay pretty close to Haruhi.

Mikuru:
That's because Miss Suzumiya caught me. I never expected something like that to happen.

 I'm just following the orders given by my superiors.
 Or what's in another term, the people in charge?
 I just follow orders, that's why sometimes I don't understand the things I'm supposed to do.

Kyon:
I wonder if the grownup Miss Asahina is one of her superiors.
 If that's the case, then the adult Miss Asahina knows how things will turn out for us.
 But for some reason, she didn't tell this Miss Asahina anything about it.
 Oh well, I guess people from the future have their own way of doing things.
 Maybe when stuff starts falling into place, someone will explain everything to her.



Kyon:
Of course, the next day was July the eighth.
 And even though I knew it was the next day, in reality, it'd been three years and one day since I'd been back to school.


Kyon:
Hm? What's wrong? You ate a poisonous mushroom or something?

Haruhi:
No, just thinking about some stuff.
 I remembered something about Tanabata from a while ago.

Kyon:
Really...



Kyon:
 Hey, Nagato. Miss Asahina's really from the future, right?

Yuki:
Yes.

Kyon:
Yeah, well, something about the process of time travel and how the past and future link seems a little off to me.

Koizumi:
What do you mean?

Kyon:
Miss Asahina told me once that there's no connection between the past and the future.
 So, I go back three years, bump into Haruhi, and tell her some stuff that I didn't think was important.
 But there's a chance that what I told her is the reason she decided on coming to North High, and why she began looking for people... who weren't normal.
 So, there has to be a link between the past and the future, right?
 Even though it contradicts what Miss Asahina said.

Yuki:
A theory that is contradictory in itself cannot begin to explain the contradictions inherent within it.

Kyon:
 If that was supposed to be an explanation, I didn't understand a word of it.

Yuki:
One day, you will.

Koizumi:
This is what she means.
 Using our game as an example, notice that my king is in check by your rook; "This is terrible. Oh, I think I'll run away!"
 See that? Can you tell me what was contradictory about what I just did?
 Of course, as far as our little group's concerned, the king isn't so important.
 To everyone here, the only thing that really matters is the queen.

Kyon:
Yeah, whatever.
 I don't know what's gonna happen to us next, but whetever it is, I want it to be something that doesn't require as much thinking.

Koizumi:
I'd love it if things stay nice and quiet.
 But you would prefer that something happen?

Kyon:
Hmmm... Jerk!
