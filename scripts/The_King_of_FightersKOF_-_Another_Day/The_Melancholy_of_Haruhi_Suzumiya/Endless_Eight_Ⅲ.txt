  Kyon:
Something's... wrong. That's what it felt like anyway.
 The game on TV was between schools from another town.
 Now I had nothing to do with either school, but because I tend to sympathize with underdogs, I found myself rooting for the losing team.
 And right about then, I suddenly got a feeling Haruhi was gonna call.

Kyon's sister:
Your phone's ringing, Kyon.

Kyon:
I know, I know.

Haruhi:
Hey, you're free, right? Good!
 Meet us at two o'clock in front of the station.
 Don't be late!

Kyon:
I didn't even have a chance to say anything.

 Hm?

Kyon's sister:
It's your phone again.

Kyon:
Yeah, I know.
 Now, what?

Haruhi:
I forgot to tell you: make sure to bring your swim trunks and some money too.
 And your bike. Definitely bring your bike!
 That's it, over and out!

Kyon:
Huh?
 It was like I knew what Haruhi was gonna say before she said it.
 Yeah, no. Actually, it felt like we had the exact same conversation before... like deja vu or something.



Haruhi:
Well, you're late, Kyon!
 Where's your motivation, huh?

Kyon:
Yeah, yeah.
 I'm sorry if I kept you waiting.

Mikuru:
No worries, I just got here too.

Haruhi:
And now that we're all present and accounted for, we can go!

Kyon:
Where?

Haruhi:
To the public pool! Where do you think?

Kyon:
Yeah, that figures.

Haruhi:
We've got lots and lots of summer vacation-y things to do during our break!
 We've only got so much time and once it's gone, it's gone for good!
 So, we're gonna do everything we can while we can during our only summer as tenth graders.
 And for starters, we're gonna ride the bikes to the pool!

Kyon:
Did everyone ride their bike today?

Koizumi:
No, the only bikes we have are the ones you and I brought.


Haruhi:
Okay, you guys. Are you ready?

Kyon:
Is anyone ever ready?

Mikuru:
I'm good to go.

Haruhi:
Don't let Koizumi beat you, okay, Kyon?
 Full speed ahead!

Kyon:
Dammit!


Haruhi:
Kyon, we're trying to have fun, so stop acting tired.
 You're such a slacker.

Kyon:
And whose fault is that, huh?


Haruhi:
Ah... can you smell the chlorine?
 That really makes it feel like summer!
 Come on! It's time for swim!
 I'll race ya!

Kyon:
Can't you see the "No Diving" sign?

Haruhi:
Hurry up and get in!
 Come on! The water's all warm and perfect!

Koizumi:
Well, you do have to admit. That certainly does look like fun.
 I mean, seeing Miss Suzumiya enjoying herself in such a normal way, it's rather charming, don't you think?
 As long as Miss Suzumiya's laughing and just having a good time, we don't have to worry about any Earth shattering events, do we?

Haruhi:
I bet you're a good swimmer!

Kyon:
Hm, I hope you're right.

Koizumi:
Hmm?

Kyon:
Is something wrong? Hey, Koizumi!

Koizumi:
Dunno... Maybe it's just my imagination.
 With everything that's happened since we met, you could say that I've become slightly paranoid.
 Come on, let's go for a swim.

Kyon:
Hey! Hey!


Haruhi:
Take that. 
 Come back!


Kyon:
Geez. Now I know why they call it a public swimming pool--seems like everyone in town's here today.
 Hmm?
 That's weird.
 It's like I've seen this happen once before... with Nagato looking kind of bored like that... and then...

Haruhi:
Kyon!

Kyon:
Uh-huh.
 And then Haruhi shows up and she says:

Haruhi:
These two guys are my brigade members.
 They do what I say, so if you want something, ask them!
 It's time to have some fun!
 Come on! Let's go play water soccer!

Girl:
Yeah!

Girl:
Let's go!

Kyon:
Oh well, sometimes deja vus happen.

Haruhi:
Here I go, Mikuru!

Mikuru:
Okay.
 Aw!

Haruhi:
Sorry!



Kyon:
What's that for?

Haruhi:
I got to thinking about some other fun things we could be doing.
 So I came up with this schedule of how we're gonna spend the rest of our vacation.
 Just think about it, we've only got two more weeks before it's over.
 And even though we've done a lot up to now, it still feels that we've got a lot to do.
 Since we've only got a little bit of time left, I made this list, so we can pick up the pace!

Kyon:
Huh...

Haruhi:
Is there anything you wanna do, Mikuru?

Mikuru:
Umm... I'd like to try goldfish scooping.

Haruhi:
Okay! Goldfish scooping...

Koizumi:
Could I see that?
 Thank you.

Haruhi:
Does anyone know if there's a Bon festival happening close-by or a fireworks show?

Koizumi:
I can check and see if there's anything.

Haruhi:
Oh, don't forget about the goldfish scooping.
 It's Mikuru's only request.

Koizumi:
I'll get right on it, then.

Haruhi:
Okay, Kyon! We're starting tomorrow! 

Kyon:
Hm? Uh...



Kyon:
The next morning, I was waken from my peaceful slumber by a call from Haruhi.
 She said they found a Bon festival.
 It was happening tonight at a park somewhere.


Haruhi:
Mikuru and Yuki said they don't have yukatas.
 So, I decided that we're gonna go out and buy some to wear for tonight.
 I don't have one either, but I found a place in town that sells them in sets for really cheap.
 And you guys, get to come with us!

Kyon:
Hmm...

 So, we went to a clothing outlet.
 Haruhi picked up yukatas for Miss Asahina and Nagato, then marched them straight into the changing rooms.
 After making us wait about an hour or so, insert yawn here, they finally emerged.

 Huh? Excellent!

Koizumi:
The three of you look wonderful in those.

Haruhi:
Of course we do! I picked 'em out myself!
 Especially, Mikuru's.
 Mmm! Look at you, you're so cute! And I'm a genius!

Mikuru:
Uh, Thanks...

Kyon:
Miss Asahina, you look awesome!



Kyon:
Huh...
 It figures there'd be so crowded. Hm?... Agh!
 There it is again... that feeling.
 I haven't been to a Bon festival in a while, but... it feels like I just went to one.
 That tower, those venders... Weird...

Haruhi:
Mikuru! Come on, look!
 They've got goldfish scooping, just like you wanted!
 Over here!

Mikuru:
Uh-oh, uh, okay!

Koizumi:
How about it? Wanna scoop some fish?

Kyon:
No, I think I'll pass.

 Hm? Don't tell me that you're actually into this kind of stuff.
 Which one? It's on me.

Yuki:
No.
 That.

Stallkeeper:
Righty-o.

Kyon:
I wish she would've let me buy that for her.
 It's the least I could do after all she's done for us.


Haruhi:
I caught thirteen fish! It's like the most unbelievable haul ever!
 But I don't have any place to keep 'em all, so I kept one and gave the other to Mikuru.
 Huh? Yuki, what's up? What's up with the mask?

Yuki:
I bought it.

Haruhi:
Okay.

Kyon:
Hm?

Haruhi:
I need your back for a second.

Kyon:
Why?

Haruhi:
Just turn around!

Kyon:
Hey, don't!

Haruhi:
Fireworks! That's what we're gonna do next!
 We'll have a firework show to end the day!

Kyon:
Do you even understand the meaning of the word "moderation"?

 It was summer, and summer vacation.
 And I guess that's why I wanted to forget about it, but the truth was, I couldn't ignore it any longer.

Haruhi:
Okay, everyone. Tomorrow we're gonna go catch some bugs!
 It's the SOS Brigade's Cicada Catching Contest!
 And whoever catches the most bugs tomorrow's gonna get to be Brigade Leader for one whole day!

Kyon:
Haruhi, I don't wanna spoil your fun, but have you finished your homework yet?

Haruhi:
Huh? You're kidding me, right? That stuff's totally easy. You can finish it in like three days.
 You have to get rid of all that junk first, so you can spend the rest of your summer having fun and not worrying about it.
 That's the only way to really get the most out of your vacation.

Mikuru:
Wow!

Kyon:
Why does she have to be so smart?


Kyon:
The next day was beautiful, sunny and bright.
 In fact, it was the perfect day for us to have our SOS Brigade's Cicada Catching Contest.
 And although everyone caught bugs the best way they knew how, the winner of the contest ended up being, you guessed it, Haruhi.



Kyon:
We met the next day, even though we had no idea what was going on.
 Our cluelessness continued as we were made to wear frog costumes and hand balloons out in front of the local supermarket.
 Welcome to our part-time job.

 Ugh! Uh...

Koizumi:
Is everything okay down there?

Kyon:
I thought I was gonna die!

Haruhi:
Thanks for all the hard work. Especially, in this heat.
 The manager's super grateful for everything.

Kyon:
Who the hell cares how grateful he is? What about our pay?

Haruhi:
This is it.
 I've had my eye on this guy for a while.
 The manager gave it to us 'cause Mikuru looks so darn cute in it.

Kyon:
That's what we worked so hard for?

Haruhi:
Mikuru, you have my permission to wear him whenever you want.
 Isn't he awesome?

Kyon:
Ribbit.



Kyon:
Later that night, my peaceful slumber was interrupted by a phone call.

 Dammit.
 Hello?

Mikuru:
Ahh...

Kyon:
Aghh!

Mikuru:
Kyon...

Kyon:
Huh? Uh...
 Is that you, Miss Asahina?

Mikuru:
Yes, it's me.
 Something really bad... I don't know what to do...

Kyon:
What's wrong...? Oh!?

Koizumi:
Hello, it's Koizumi.

Kyon:
Why are you with Miss Asahina in the middle of the night?! 

Koizumi:
We have a situation here.
 Is it possible for you to come meet us right now? 

Kyon:
Of course! I'll be right over! 


Kyon:
Miss Asahina! What happened?

Mikuru:
It's terrible, Kyon...
 I can't go back to the future anymore!

Kyon:
You can't go back, but you... What are you saying?

Koizumi:
I'll explain it the best I can.
 We're currently stuck in a time loop that seems to have no end to it.

Kyon:
Huh? Are what?

Koizumi:
We're currently stuck in a time loop that seems to have no end to it.

Kyon:
Uh...

Koizumi:
We're currently stuck in a time loop that seems to have no end...

Kyon:
Come on, Koizumi. Do you realize what you just said?

Koizumi:
Yes, of course, I do, and much more than I want to. Believe me.
 Earlier, I was having a word with Miss Asahina.

Kyon:
Call me next time!

Koizumi:
And that was when we realized something seemed a little off about the current flow of time.
 Actually, Miss Asahina was the one who discovered it first.
 Thanks to her, my suspicions were confirmed.

Kyon:
Suspicions?

Koizumi:
We've been reliving the same period of time over and over again, stuck in an infinite time loop without any way of getting unstuck. 

Kyon:
I know you already said that. 

Koizumi:
We've been repeating every single day between August the seventeenth through the thirty-first, and have become stuck right in the middle of what seems to be an endless summer vacation. 

Kyon:
Well, we're definitely in the middle of something. 

Koizumi:
It's a never-ending endless summer to be precise.
 The future doesn't exist in this world any longer.
 All time stops at September the first.
 And that's the reason why Miss Asahina can't travel back to the future.
 It's only natural that she can't return to a future that no longer exists.

Kyon:
Are you kidding me? There's nothing natural about the concept like that.
 Who's gonna believe such nonsense?

Koizumi:
For starters, we were sort of hoping you would.

Mikuru:
Hey, guys... I think I can try to explain it. Here I go.
 Because I... had to "classified information", I used "classified information" to get in touch with the future.
 The thing is, I haven't gotten any "classified information" for a week, so I started to think how weird that was.
 I was so surprised, I "classified information," I really did.
 But it was "classified information" too... 

Kyon:
Oh, Miss Asahina.
 Are the "classified information" things you're talking about stuff you can't say on TV?

 So, what about those closed spaces you were talking about before?
 Is it possible we're trapped inside something like that?

Koizumi:
No, it's not one of those.
 A specific section of time has been torn away.
 At exactly midnight on August the thirty-first, everything resets, and then time reverts straight back to the morning of August the seventeenth.
 That's the process.

Kyon:
What about our... Wait!
 What about the whole world's memories?

Koizumi:
Their memory resets as well.
 Everyone's memory starts over from the beginning again.

Kyon:
Perfect. It's another problem involving time.
 Well, I guess I shouldn't be so surprised about that.

Koizumi:
No, Miss Asahina didn't have anything to do with this.

Kyon:
Okay, what does?

Koizumi:
Miss Suzumiya does. 

Kyon:
Mmm... 

Koizumi:
Somewhere deep down inside her, there's a desire to have summer vacation last forever.
 And I'm sure she doesn't even realize it. 

Kyon:
No way! Are you saying she still hasn't had enough fun? 

Koizumi:
That's what it looks like to me.
 Perhaps she feels there's something else that needs to happen before our summer vacation can really be over. 

Kyon:
Oh man, the trouble she gets us into is always galactic in scale.

 You know you're acting like you're enjoying this an awful lot.
 You wanna tell me why?

Koizumi:
Please don't take that the wrong way.
 But this explains the feelings of deja vu I've been having.
 And looking back on it now, there were most likely the residuum of my memories whenever time had been reset.
 You've been feeling them too, haven't you?

Kyon:
Are we the only ones, or can other people feel it too? 

Koizumi:
Uh-uh. It looks like you and I are exceptions to the rule.
 The only people who can sense this strange feeling would be the ones who are the closest to Miss Suzumiya. 

Kyon:
Then what about Haruhi? Does she know this stuff's even happening? 

Koizumi:
No, I don't think she really does. Besides, I think it would be very very bad for us if she did.
 But... there's someone else, someone who's unaffected by the time loop or the feelings of deja vu we've been experiencing.
 They remember it at all.

Kyon:
Uh... Really. And who would that person be? 

Koizumi:
I think you know who it is. 

Kyon:
Nagato, is that the truth? 

Yuki:
It is. 

Kyon:
And you can remember everything? 

Yuki:
I can. 

Kyon:
Then, can you tell me how many times has this happened to us so far? 

Yuki:
This would be 15,499 times. 

Kyon:
15,499? What do you mean 15,499? What're you saying, Nagato?

 Okay, are you being totally serious? 

Yuki:
Yes. 

Kyon:
So, what you're saying is that we've done the exact same things every time that many times? 

Yuki:
Not necessarily.
 Throughout 15,499 repetitions, we did not attend a Bon festival the 2,391st time and 11,054th time.
 We went to a Bon festival but did not go to a goldfish scooping booth 437 times.
 We obtained part-time jobs 9,026 times, and worked six different jobs.
 In addition to handing out balloons, we worked as movers, cashers, we handed out fliers, worked as call... 

Kyon:
I got it. That's enough.

 15,499 times, that's what she said, times two weeks, that's... 594 years!
 She's the only one who remembers everything we did.
 And she had to repeat them over and over again.
 Nagato, what's it like to relive the same things that many times?
 That's gotta be the craziest story ever.



Kyon:
The next night, we went stargazing.
 We were on the balcony of Nagato's apartment, and Koizumi brought a telescope.

Haruhi:
Umm... I'm getting bored. I'm gonna look for UFOs now. 

Kyon:
Hey! Haruhi, you'll break it!
 Wait, stop! Don't spin it like that!

 I wish I knew what else she wants to do? 

Koizumi:
Well now, that's the only important question, isn't it?
 And if we knew the answer, we could solve this problem.
 I've got an idea--how about we try this?
 What if someone were to suddenly grab Miss Suzumiya from behind and then whispered "I love you" right into her ear?

Kyon:
And who's gonna be doing this? 

Koizumi:
Who else could play that role other than you? 

Kyon:
Well, you can count me out, then! 

Koizumi:
All right. How about if I give it a try?
 No, I'm just kidding. I really don't think I can pull it off anyway.
 And besides, it would just end up confusing Miss Suzumiya.



Kyon:
We kept chugging along doing all kinds of summer vacation things.
 We went to the batting cages, to a real firework show, and even signed up for a goby fishing tournament.
 We did the test of courage, watched some movies, went to the beach, bowling and karaoke.
 Yep, we were always doing something.
 And the whole time, all I could think was that none of that was going to be enough for Haruhi.
 What could I do about it? Nothing.
 So, I just bit my lip and watched the last days of our summer vacation went by.
 And then, before I knew it, August the thirtieth was here, again...



Haruhi:
That's it. We've done everything on our list.
 Ah... but now I wonder if we did enough.
 Uh, oh well. I guess we've got to do a lot.
 Hey, does anyone wanna do anything else?

Mikuru:
Oh... 

Haruhi:
Hm, okay.
 I guess that we did everything we set out to do this summer, so that's good enough. 

Kyon:
No, it's not, Haruhi. Not by a long shot, you're still not satisfied. 

Haruhi:
Okay, guys. We're done for today.
 I set tomorrow aside just in case, but I guess you can take the day off now.
 I'll see you all at the clubroom on Monday. 

Kyon:
Uh... W-Wait, Haruhi!
 There's that feeling again, and it's way stronger than all the others.
 I can't let Haruhi leave.
 If I let her walk out that door, we'll end up reliving the past two weeks again and again for a thousand more times.
 But... what should I do? What should I say?
 There must have been a clue in something Haruhi said.
 But... what was it? What's she been saying all this time?
 I don't know... Can't remember... 



Kyon:
It's August the thirty-first.
 I haven't touched my homework.
 Whatever, it doesn't matter.
 There isn't any point doing it.
 We're just gonna keep reliving the last couple of weeks over again.
 Whatever happens next, whether tomorrow comes or not, a different version of me will have to do with it
