  Konata:
 Summer time! Beach time!
 Before we leave, ma'am, I wanna make sure you and my cousin are okay
 with driving and supervising.

Yui, Kuroi:
 Oh, yeah!

Konata:
 That's interesting...
 You guys must have a lot of time on your hands.




Kagami:
 Sorry for taking you away from your day off.

Yui:
 Oh no, it's totally cool.

Kagami:
 Narumi-san, is it true you're a police officer in the traffic safety division?

Yui:
 That's right. I'm the expert when it comes to traffic laws!
 He passed me...

Kagami:
 Huh?

Yui:
 Damn him...

Kagami:
 Hey, wait! Just you're supposed to be a cop!


Konata:
 She goes nuts when she's behind the wheel, she's out of control.
 And we'd just sacrifice Kagami and Tsukasa to her.

Kuroi:
 Oh, come on, now, she's a police officer, right?
 Hm? Hey, that's weird...
 They were there a second ago.

Konata:
 No Teach, you are going down the wrong street!
 It says one-way, look!

Kuroi, Konata:
 Ah! Ah!

Konata:
 I can't believe I got it wrong both times!
 Curses!

Man:
The blue car is amazing. Who's driving it?
Their braking drift on the down was awesome!
It's gaining on the FD!
It's got some serious pickup!
It missed the rail by like that much!

Yui:
 A good point of attack would be, on the 5 hairpin curves
 that're coming up.

Man:
It's speeding up. Did the brakes die?!
No way!

Kagami:
 What's with her <bleep bleep>-D driving?

Konata:
 Nanako-san, you're a good driver. A really good driver.

Kuroi:
 Huh? You think?

Konata:
 It's funny. But I always get motion sickness when I'm riding in cars.
 Today I brought along some medicine that would keep me from getting sick.
 But you see Nanako-san, because you're such a skilled driver,
 I didn't get sick at all.

Kuroi:
 Huh?
 Ah, what am I doing talking to you, we gotta get outa here!

Yui, Kuroi:
 Ah...

Tsukasa, Konata, Kagami:
 Uh...

Kuroi:
 Okay, guess we should find a hotel.




Tsukasa:
 Wow, it's so sunny outside. It's perfect for swimming.

Kagami:
 I swear, yesterday I didn't think we'd ever get here alive.

Konata:
 I'm gonna put my swimsuit on and wear it down to the beach.

 Kagami:
 Sometimes you can be so childish, Konata.
 Ah!
 No way. You can't be serious.
 Hey, aren't you a little old to be wearing your school swimsuit
 in public ?

 Konata:
 Not if you're catering to special interest, Kagamin.

 Kagami:
 Wow, how old is that thing?

 Hey, do you really need one of those tubes?
 I mean you're so athletic, and I know you can swim.

 Konata:
 Just because I know how to swim doesn't mean I have to jump in
 and start swimming marathons.
 There is a thing called leisure, you know.
 Sweet leisure.
 Since I'm trying to meet the needs of folks with special interest,
 I'm using this thing 'cause it completes the outfit.

 Kagami:
 I don't think anyone with special interest would go to the beach.

Konata:
 Hmm... You always see people splitting watermelons
 in manga and anime, but it never happens in real life.

Kagami:
 No, I've seen that happen before.
 Maybe people think it's a waste of food.

Konata:
 You got a point.
 'Cause when you blow up watermelons with a shotgun,
 you get pieces of the watermelon all over you.

Kagami:
 You watch too much anime.

Konata:
 Miyuki-san, you are rich, have you ever split watermelons?

Miyuki:
I can't say I've ever done that.

Konata:
Hm... On second thought, I guess I can't really picture rich people
 doing that kind of stuff.

Kagami:
 Yeah, I guess you're right.

Konata:
 Oh, uh-huh... Hm... Ha!

Konata:
 Hm...That figures, nothing happens in real life
 the way it does in manga.

Miyuki:
 I'm so sorry I disappointed you.

Kuroi:
So it's like, you know, whatever...
 Man, it's so sad, here we are at the beach and we have to babysit.
 We are a couple of lonely single ladies.

Yui:


Kuroi:
 Oh, yeah you can compromise and lug something like that around,
 but that's no fun.
 Give me a bunch of girls, then I'm a happy camper, you know?

Yui:
But I am not...

Kuroi:
 Oh yeah, more and more folks are getting married later in life,
 guess you and I've got all the time in the world.
 Know what I'm saying?

Yui:
You got it wrong, the only reason I'm here is
 because my husband and me have a commuter marriage,
 I'm married, married.

Konota:
 If the beach is a Mecca for picking up girls,
 how come no one's picking us up?

Kagami:
 It's better this way 'cause no one's bothering us.
 Besides, with you in your outfit, the guys probably think we are sisters
 on vacation with the parents.

Tsukasa:
 Yokkoi Shouichi!

Konata:
 What's wrong?

 Tsukasa:
 You know, doesn't it feel kind of gross to sit down
 when you're all sopping-wet?

 Miyuki:
 I know how you feel!

Konata:
 Maybe you should get into an air chair pose.

 Kagami:
 She dosen't need to work out.

 What's wrong?

 Konata:
 My neck's tired.

 Kagami:
 I see.

 Konata:
 Yes. I totally knew it.

 Kagami:
 What are you getting so excited about?

 Konata:
 We've just been served food that's the epitome of the beach house experience.
 Check it out.
 Runny curry!
 That's what I'm talking about.

 Tsukasa:
 You're right.
 Isn't it weird how the things you'd never eat in every day life become amazingly delicious
 when you eat them in a place like this?

Kuroi:
 Woahaa!
Chugging beer at the beach is awesome!
 Who cares if it's lukewarm.
 This stuff's the best.

Yui:
 Yeah, but they're kind of pushing it when they charge you 300 yen for a lousy hot dog.

Konata:
 Yeah, right, and the thing's almost raw, but who cares, you still eat it anyway.

Tsukasa:
 I kinda like how when you order the fried chicken and you get it.
 It's always really greasy and it's got way too many spices.

Miyuki:
 The plain fried noodles also seem to be much more delicious here.

Kagami:
 Hey...
 Does the food here really deserve all the hype?

Konata:
 Uh-huh.
 But it's not as cool as running down to the beach in a loincloth.

Kagami:
 That's supposed to be another anime reference?


Kuroi:
 I was so hammered.
 Looks like we're spending another night here.

Konata:
 Is that okay, Yui-neisan?

Yui:
 I've got another day vacation.
 It's cool, I'm fine!

Kuroi:
 Ahhh!
 The water's really cold!

Konata:
 Oh, come on, ma'am, it can't be that cold.
 You're just exaggerating.
 Argh!

Tsukasa:
 Why does your hair always feel so squeaky after you've been swimming
 in the ocean?

Koanta:
 Scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub...
 Scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub...

Kagami:
 Well, maybe it's got something to do with all the salts in the water.
 Right, Miyuki?

Miyuki:
 That's true.
 It's mostly caused by the salt and also by the ultraviolet rays from the sun.

Kotana:
 But, is that really such a bad thing?
 Your hair's always exposed to UV rays anyway.

Miyuki:
 That's also true.
 But you really want me to explain it, because I'm afraid it's quite involved and lengthy.

Kagami,Tsukasa,Konata:
 Uh-huh.

Miyuki:
 All right.
 Ahem.
 The reason your hair becomes damaged at the beach is due to exposure to UV rays
 as well as salt in seawater and ocean breezes.
 When exposed to these elements, your hair loses moisture.
 Furthermore, if you sunbathe under strong UV rays, the melanin in your hair begins to change,
 causing your hair to lighten.
 Now the salts and impurities such as chlorine from swimming pools remain
 in your hair for any length of time.
 It causes your hair to turn brittle.
 UV rays and impurities are the main cause of molecular damage during the summer season.
 However, the factors I've mentioned also cause significant damage to the hair's cuticles.
 So, when exposed to strong UV rays, the cystine bonds that preserve your hair's strength become...


squeaky : チューチュー鳴く、キーキーいう、きしむ、告げ口する
 chlorine : 《元素》塩素
 for any length of time : 短時間でも、時間は短くても、少し［ちょっと］（の間）でも

Konata:
 Hey, guys, look it!
 Timotei, Timotei, Timotei!

Kagami:
 What the...?

Konata:
 Hm...

Kuroi:
 Sometimes I wonder how the other folks see us, when they see us.

Yui:
 I don't know...

Kuroi, Yui:
 Another short conversation...

Yui:
 I guess they probably think we look like family or something like that.

Kuroi:
 Yeah, I guess.

Yui:
 That's all you've got to say?

Konata:
 Yui-neisan! Look!
 Timotei, Timotei, Timotei!

Yui:
 No way!
 I used to do that too!

Konata:
 Bitchin'!
 That's just the reaction I was looking for!

Kuroi:
 How old are you, kid?

Konata:
 Hm... Mandom.

Kagami:
 Enough with the bad puns, gramps.

Tsukasa:
 What's wrong, Kona-chan?

Konata:
 Looks like I just triggered a flag!

Kagami:
 What are you talking about?

Konata:
 An event scene is gonna happen!
 Remember if you wanna see all your choices at the end, save often!
 I'm going in, girls!

Konata:
 Picture's complete!
 That's perfect! Bring it!

Kagami:
I have no idea...
 You're such a geek, no wonder today it was so totally boring.

Konata:
 What do you mean?

Kagami:
 Did any guys hit on us today?

Kagami:
 Well, it's not like I...
 You are the one who brought it up!
 I wasn't obsessing about it or anything, I was just saying,
 that's why I brought it up...

Konata:
 Oh, now I get it, you wanted someone to hit on you!

Kagami:
 No, no, that's not it...

Miyuki
 Ah!

Konata:
 Oh no, I missed it!

Bitchin' : ≪米俗≫素晴｛すば｝らしい、格好いい、すっごい
 gramps : おじさん、おっさん




Tsukasa:
 What is it?

Kagami:
 Oh, nothing.
 I was just wondering what you did with unwanted hair.

Tsukasa:
 Well, I'm kinda smooth all over, so I don't really do anything.

Kagami:
 Hmm...

Tsukasa:
 What do you do?

Kagami:
 Ah! Who me?
 I guess I'm kinda normal...

Tsukasa:
 Hmmm.

Kagami:
 Hm...

Kagami:
 Actually today was kinda risky for me if you know what I mean.

Tsukasa:
 Oh no, I don't.

Kagami:
 It was almost time... for my...

Tsukasa:
 Ah!

Kagami:
 ...you-know-what to happen.

Tsukasa:
 Oh, I get it.
 But it didn't, so that's good!

Kagami:
 Were you okay with yours today?

Tsukasa:
 Uh-huh, it missed me.
 Mine ended just last week, so I guess you could say it was perfect timing.

Kagami:
 It's such a hassle when you want to go to the beach.

Tsukasa:
 Yeah, I know.
 It sucks when you can't go in the water because of it,
 but you could always use one of those thingies...

Kagami:
 Yeah, right, but you still worry about it.

Tsukasa:
 I've never used one of those things.

Konata:
 Hmm!.

Kagami, Tsukasa:
 Ah!

Konata:
 Someone's having a blunt conversation!

Kagami:
 What if we are?
 It's not like you never...
 Ah! You're kidding!

Konata:
 What are you looking at?

Kagami:
 Oh, nothing...


unwanted hair : 無駄毛、不要な毛




Konata:
 The story I'm about to tell you... really happened...
 A man who worked for a video software wholesaler left work one night
 as he usually did.
 It was especially dark that night as he got on the bus to go home.
 This man lived on the edge of town near where the bus route ended.
 One by one, passengers were dropped off.
 But the man, he was alone and riding through the inky blackness
 on this specially dark night.
 The bus was so empty and so quiet now.
 The driver thought he was alone, but he wasn't.
 And then..., he sang "Danzen! Futari wa _ Cure!" in a very loud voice!

Everybody:
Ahhhh!

Konata:
 Anyhow, that's the way I heard it.

Tsukasa:
 Ah!

Yui:
 Huh?

Tsukasa:
 Oh, wow, wasn't that a scary story?

Yui:
 Ahaha... Yeah, actually I...

Konata:
 Sukekiyo!

Yui:
 Where the hell did you get that thing?!

Yui:
 Good night, sleep well!

Tsukasa:
 'Key then, good night!

Konata:
 Inugami-clan!

Konata:
 I love scaring Tsukasa.

Kagami:
 Go to sleep already!

Kuroi:
 Hey, let's (bail) off!

Tsukasa:
 Oh, okay!

Tsukasa:
 I don't have anything funny to say now.
 I'm Tsukasa... I'm Tsukasa...

Tsukasa:
 Ahhhh!
 Kagami!

Kagami:
 What's wrong?

Tsukasa:
 It was so scary!

Konata:
 I believe the girl has taken another step on the path
 toward womanhood, Kagamin.

Kagami:
 Huh?




Konata:
 Man, this year's Comp-Fest is gonna be huge.

Kagami:
 The Japanese are suckers for "limited edition" stuff.

Konata:
 If labeling stuff as limited edition is enough to boost sales,
 they should slap it on everything.

Kagami:
 Well, if they did that, it wouldn't be limited, would it?


TV:
Though we asked around, and the truth is that if you drink three...

Tadao:
 Don't forget girls.
 Make sure to clean up your rooms before your vacation ends.

Kagami:
 Wow, cool!
 It's my old junior high textbooks!

Tsukasa:
 Hey, Sis, look!
 Check out this old photo album!
 Look at this weird picture of Dad!

Kagami:
 Yeah, when I saw that, it made me wonder what I was saying...

Tadao:
 You guys look like you're having fun, how's the cleaning going?

Kagami, Tsukasa:
 Ah!


Kagami:
 Let's see...

Inori:
 Hey, do you want these clothes?

Kagami:
 Oh, yeah, sure I'll take 'em.

Inori:
 Okay, I'll leave 'em here.

Kagami:
 Hm. Thanks, Sis.

Inori:
 Hey, you want this?

Kagami:
 Hm? Sure if you don't want it.

Inori:
 How about this?

Kagami:
 Ah.

Inori:
 And this?

Kagami:
 Wait! Is she using me as her trash bin or something?!


Kagami:
 You always end up flipping through old photo albums instead.

Konata:
 Yeah, I know, I know.
 When I find an old magazine, I can't help but read it.

Kagami:
 That's just what I mean.

Konata:
 Hey, where's Tsukasa?

Kagami:
 Oh, you know my sister, she has a hard time throwing anything away.
 She's still cleaning.

Konata:
 Yeah, she seems like the type who totally keeps everything.
 Although, you seem to be the type that throws everything away.

Kagami:
 You know, this negative image you have of me
 is really starting to piss me off, girl.

Konata:
 Wow, you kept all of your junior high textbooks?

Kagami:
 What? You mean you didn't keep yours?

Konata:
 Oh, no, I left all of that stuff behind along with my memories.

Kagami:
 No, take 'em home.
 You're causing trouble for the school.

Tsukasa:
 At last, I finished my cleaning.
 Even though they're stuff I know I'll never use again,
 I remembered the times that I did,
 so now I can't throw them out.

Konata:
 Well, that's just the way some people are,
 they wanna keep everything.
 You're that type of person, Tsukasa.

Kagami:
 You seem to be the type who toss(es) stuff that could be useful.
 I mean, you still leave all your textbooks behind.


 sucker for : ～におあつらえ向きの人、～に目が無い
 flip through : ～をパラパラめくる、～をめくって調べる




Yukari:
 Miyuki, you know you really should go and get your teeth checked
 before school starts up again.

Miyuki:
 I know that I should, it's just that... I don't think that I could.

Yukari:
 Well, if that's the case, I'd feel really bad making you head all the way down there.
 If you can't go to the dentist, we'll just have the dentist come here.




Miyuki:
 No, please! Wait a minute!

Akira:
 Hiya, Luckies.
 Time for the sixth episode of Lucky Channel.
 Can you guys believe it?
 I am Akira Kogami.
 And I hope you guys are getting used to this segment.
 'Cause I sure am. Kyalun!

Minoru:
That’s lame. Whoa...!

Akira:
 Did you say something?

 Oh, well, looks like my assistant Minoru Shiraishi still isn’t used to this.
 He must be nervous, ’cause all the people are watching.
 I'd really like it if he'd get used to his job.
 Especially when he’s talking to superiors.
 I mean how many times do we have to remind him before he gets it, you know.
 It’s irritating!
 Anyway, on today’s episode, we’re gonna introduce you to a key character in Lucky Star.
 It’s Konata!

Minoru:
Scared, so scared, what I do now,….

Akira:
 Shut up! You pussy.

Minoru:
Why me? I didn’t ask for this!

Akira:
 Miss Konata Izumi is seventeen. She likes games, anime and manga.

Minoru:
Yes, and according to our sources, she is always watching
the new shows and reading the latest manga.
On weekend she spends her time gaming on line till dawn.

Akira:
 So you say she is an otaku.

Minoru:
 Well, yeah, I guess she is.

Akira:
 Huum.

Minoru:
Harry! Do something.
Y, you know those crazy otaku.
They never leave the house.
They’re always crying or watching "The Dog of Flanders" and stuff.

Akira:
Huh? How dated is your idea of otaku, anyway.
 You do your homework or what?
 Can you handle your job, guy, or what?
 
Minoru:
 Well... um...


 Well, it’s true that both "The Dog of Flanders" and cute moe characters
 both have a healing effect, you know.
 But girls like me are way better than some meaty dog.
 These days the public really wants to see cute innocent girls, right?
 When I look to the right, they look to the right.
 If I look left, they look left.
 They wait in line all night before a concert and don’t take a bath.
 They stink so bad, it makes your eyes water and yet they still want to see me.
 That’s what drive them standing like cattle in the heat burning under the damn sun
 waiting for me, ME!
 Waiting until the bandanas around their heads get so sweaty and it’s all for me!
 Huh... But in the end, I guess they are the customers though,
 even if they insist on telling me their life story at a handshake session.
 And even if they do make a few off-topic comments, you sympathize with them, you know.
 ‘Cause in the end the only reason I’m here is ‘cause the folks like that.
 I gotta do my best to up here, 'cause those people are my fans, you know?

Minoru:
Is that what it's really like for you?

Akira:
 Oh, you'll find out real soon.
 Being an idle's the hardest thing you'll ever do.
 Oh, yeah, once you’ve been through the best and the worst,
 you'll see what it’s all about.
 Some client or fan you hate comes up to you, you gotta smile.
 Oh, that was fun.
 OK, did everybody get a good idea about who Konata-san is? Yeah?
 Good.
 Then I'll see you again in the next episode.
 Bye-nee.


Minoru:
Uh, actually today's show was more about otaku than Konata-san.

Akira:
 Ahh.

Minoru:
A, are you okay?

Akira:
 You do it.

Minoru:
Huh? Oh, sure! At that moment the reporter saw a…

Akira:
 That’s lame.




Konata:
 Yeah! That was awesome. Kage rules.

Kagami:
 Okay, calm down.
 So, Tsukasa, did you pick a song?

Tsukasa:
 Yep, I did.

Miyuki:
 I can’t wait to hear you sing, Tsukasa-san.

Tsukasa:
 I hope I can sing it good.

Kagami:
 Hey, Miyuki, what are YOU gonna sing?

Miyuki:
 Oh, I don’t know that many songs.
 It’s a little embarrassing.

Konata:
 Oh! That’s what she picked on.

Miyuki:
Go for it, Tsukasa-san.

Konata:
 L, O, V, E, lovely, Tsukasa.

Kagami:
 Oh, jeez..

Konata:
 L, O, V, E, lovely, Sayuri.

Kagami:
 Who’s Sayuri!

Konata:
 The name isn’t Sayuri Kuninama.

Kagami:
 Does anyone know who Sayuri is?

Konata:
 What was her membership number again?

Kagami:
 You're ruining the song!




Narration:
On the next episode of Lucky Star...

Kagami:
 Kagami here.
 You know how when you've got a hangnail that's just wriggling around.
 You wanna pull it out.
 You think it's gonna hurt, so you don't.
 But then you do when it comes out and it’s bigger than you thought and it hurts.
 Then there are scabs.
 You try to time it where it doesn't hurt when you peel it off.
 Then when it starts getting itchy and you think
 "Sure, that sucker's ready to rip off. Let's do this!"
 So you go slow peeling from the sides first and then you just rip through the center
 and you end up bleeding anyway.
 And then you're like "That's gonna leave scar".

 Next time, ”Image”.

Narration:
Look forward to it!
