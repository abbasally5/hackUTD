Yui:

Konata:
 Yeah, I know.


Konata:



Sojiro:

Yui:
 Hey there!

Sojiro:
 Ooh, thanks.

Yui:
 Is it true that Konata and Yutaka both caught a cold?

Yui:
 Uh-oh, hey, Yutaka, how are you doing?

Yutaka:
 I haven't had a cold in a while.

Yui:


Konata:
 What's up, Neisan, how's it going?

Yui:


Konata:



Patricia, Hiyori, Minami:
 Hello!

Yui:


Minami:
 Oh, it's okay, really...

Yui:


Patricia, Hiyori, Minami:
 Hello!

Yui:


Minami:
 Oh, it's okay, really...

Yui:


Yutaka:


Hiyori:
 How are you feeling?

Patricia:
 Promise me you'll get well soon, okay?

Yutaka:


Konata:


Yui:


Hiyori:


Konata:
 Yeah, that's right!

Patricia:
 That's right!

Konata:

Patricia:
 I'm being blinded by their aura of confusion!

Hiyori:


Konata:


Hiyori:
 Wow, is that for real?

Minami:
 No, it's not like that...

Yui:
 I heard that if you massaged your boobs, they get bigger.

Konata:
 Yeah, I heard that too!

Hiyori:
 Hm...

Yutaka:
 Um, you sure it's okay, Minami-chan?

Minami:


Yutaka:
 'Kay, here goes.

Minami:
 Um...

Hiyori:


TV:
Isn't that amazing?
Now, let's review.
Chewing gum containing xylitol...
has been proven to destroy the germs that cause cavities.
Because...
when the xylitol...
is absorbed by the germs that cause cavities...
it depletes...
the ATP...
in the bacteria and also...
it dissolves...
the cavity itself.
And...

Miyuki:
 If it's really that good for my teeth, I should try it.

Miyuki:


Konata:
 A pitiful and unlucky Miyuki-san is moe.

Kagami:
 It's okay.


Konata:
 So, that's what poor sweet Miyuki-san was crying about today.

Yutaka:
 Yeah?

Konata:
 Oh, yeah.

Yutaka:
 Oh, um, okay...

Yutaka:
 That's what Oneichan said happened to her.

Minami:
 That's why Miyuki-san seemed so gloomy...

Hiyori:


Hiyori:


Yutaka:
 How do you come up with ideas for manga anyway?

Hiyori:


Yutaka:
 Ah! From... real-life, huh?

Hiyori:
 You read them, didn't you?

Yutaka:
 Um, well, that depends on...

Hiyori:
 Admit it. You did!

Yutaka:
 Well, I...

Hiyori:
 She showed you even after all that begging.

Yutaka:
 I'm... I'm sorry...

Hiyori:
 Those stories weren't from real-life!

Yutaka:
 Anyway, I thought the stories were good and really fun to read.

Hiyori:
 Great... thanks a lot...

Yutaka:


Minami:
 I'd like to read some of her stories too.

Hiyori:


Minami, Yutaka:
 Hm?


Konata:


Kuroi:


Konata:


Kuroi:
 Okay, you could at least lie and tell me you were studying...

Konata:


Kuroi:

Miyuki:
 I can't believe I'm back for another visit.

Dentist:
Let's have ourselves a peek and search, shall we?
Not to worry, we just need to pop the filling back in
and you'll be as right as rain.
Now about that tooth in the back, I believe I've detected some decay.
We should start treatment immediately.

Miyuki:
Ugh!

hang up on :　～との通話中に（一方的に）電話を切る
as right as rain:　(完全に)正常で、健康で

Tsukasa:
 Oh.

Kagami:
 Hm? What's wrong?

Tsukasa:


Kagami:


Tsukasa:
 Huh? Heh, I guess.

Kagami:



Yutaka:


Konata:
 Hey, Yu-chan, good morning.

Sojiro:
 Good morning.

TV:
Here's today's pooch.

Yutaka:
 Wow, look at all the animals!

Konata:
 They're doing some kinda special about pets.

TV:
First, I'd like to introduce you to a Welsh Corgi named Koo!

Yutaka:
 Well, it's a Corgi! He's super cute.

Konata:
 I don't know about the dog, but the owner's pretty darn cute.

Sojiro:


Konata:
 She'd look awesome in a Gothic maid ensemble.

TV:
Next, we have Silviana, a Siberian Husky.

Yutaka:


Konata:


Sojiro:
 Oh, fantastic!

Konata:


Kagami:


Misao:


Misao:


Ayano:

Kagami:



Konata:
 That's a ton of stinky.

Patricia:
 Can something stinky be moe?

Kagami:
 Oh, hey there, Patricia-san.

Patricia:
 How's it going?

Kagami:
 We're seeing you a lot on this side of the school these days.

Konata:


Kagami:


Patricia:


Kagami:


Patricia:


Kagami:
 Wow, you sure do.

Konata:
 That's impressive but all the bands you just named sing anime songs.

Patricia:


Konata:
 And you are only listening to the songs that they did for anime, right?


Patricia:
 Ah, you know, I really need to get myself a maid.

Kagami:
 Huh?

Patricia:
 It'd be nice to get a maid.

Kagami:


Patricia:
 Yup, and the cooking, laundry, manga, and anime keep me busy.

Kagami:


Patricia:
 Oh, no, I don't wanna get a housekeeper, I wanna get a maid.

Kagami:
 Uh... I didn't even know there was a difference.

Patricia:


Kagami:
 Actually, I think you might be getting the wrong idea about Japan.

Minami:


Minami's Mom:


Minami:
 Huh...

Minami's Mom:
 Slow down, girl.

Minami:
 But, now I feel so lonely.


Yutaka:


Miyuki:


Yukari:
 Oh, does she now?

Yukari:
 Minami-chan! Would you take this?!

Minami:
 Ah...

Yukari:
 I have to agree she is rather awesome and cool, isn't she?

Miyuki:
 Yes, why, even Izumi-san thinks so...

Konata:


Miyuki:
 And that's what she said about her.

Yukari:
 Hm?

Cachier:
Oh, I'm sorry, because it's on sale,
we have to limit it to only one per customer.

Minami:
 Oh.

Yukari:
 Oh, my...

Yukari:
 She's cool-headed and a little miss perfect...

Miyuki:
 And here's what Kagami-san and Tsukasa-san have to say about her...

Kagami:


Tsukasa:


Miyuki:


Minami:


Yukari:
 Huh?

Yukari:
 Huh?

Yukari:
 Huh?

Yukari:
 Huuhh?

Yukari:

Kagami:
Hey, you.
 
Tsukasa:
 Hey, girl.

Konata:
 Hey, what's up?

Kagami:
 What're you watching there?
 
Konata:
 It's just some mecha anime series I rented.

Tsukasa:
This looks really cool.

Kagami:
 You sure are into the stuff, aren't you?
 
Konata:
Yeah, but I'm not really that much into mecha or anything.

Kagami:
 What? What do you mean you're not into mecha?
 Why the heck are you watching the show then?

Konata:

 Pretty clever, huh?
 
Kagami:
What's the point in calling a mecha anymore?


Misao:
Got that, Hiiragi?
 I'm counting on you for real, so promise me.
 I wanna hear you say it.
 Go on, say it!

Kagami:
 Yeah, sure, relax.
 I'll take care of it.

Ayano:
Come on, Misa-chan, you heard her.
 She said she'd take care of it.
 I wouldn't bother her too much, if I were you.

Misao:


Kagami:
 She picks the weirdest things to be right about!
Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:
 No, thanks.

Konata:
 Yes, thanks.

Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:
 It's probably because all the things you're looking for are too weird.


Kagami:
 'Kay, what are you gonna get?

Konata:
 Just this. I'm good to go.

Kagami:
 You're watching that one too?

Konata:


Kagami:
 You're talking crazy.

Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:
 Nonbiri shimasho...

Kagami:
 A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, huh?
Konata:
 Achoo!

Kagami:


Konata:
 Well, you know, it's not like you can control your sneezes.

Kagami:


Miyuki:
 Achoo.

Konata:


Kagami:


Misao:
 So, if you go all the way around, it doesn't stink so bad.

Ayano:
 Is it true they stopped doing it?

Kagami:
 You know, you guys get along great.

Misao, Ayano:
 Hm?

Kagami:
 Do you guys ever argue or anything?

Misao:
 All the time!

Misao:


Kagami:
 Yeah, I guess there're some people out there who are like that.

Ayano:
 Oh, come on, leave me alone!

Misao:


Kagami:

Yutaka:


Konata:


Yutaka:


Konata:
 Wow, she totally ignored me, didn't she?


Misao:
 Hey, don't you think so too, Hiiragi?

Kagami:
 Hmm...

Misao:
 Isn't that the funniest thing ever, Hiiragi?

Kagami:
 Hmm...

Misao:
 Know what I'm talking about, Hiiragi?

Kagami:
 Hmm...

Ayano:



Patricia:


Konata:
 Yeah, I know.

Patricia:
 Hey, is that right, as the image corrupted?

Konata:
 Nah, it's supposed to look all blurry and pixelated like that.

Patricia:
 Oh, I kinda like how its blurry and pixelated.

Yui:


Yutaka:
 What's everybody doing?

Konata:
 It's none of your business, Yu-chan!

Yutaka:
 Huh?


Kuroi:

Gottoza-sama:

Akira:
Gloomy..

Minoru:
Umm..

Gottoza-sama:

 You guys still with me? Fantastic!
 Anyway, I heard you losers built this show up from nothing, yeah?

 
Akira:
Unhappy.
 
Minoru:
Umm.

Gottoza-sama
People say I'm a mean bastard.
 And you know I've done things that'd make your hair turn white.

 You awake? Good boy.
 If we don’t get this thing result right freaking now, it's gonna make me look bad.
 And WE don’t want that, do we, Shiraishi?

Minoru:
No, we don’t, Gottoza-sama.

Gottoza-sama:
 Huh, do we?

Minoru:
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

Gottoza-sama:
Umm, you are awfully quiet.
 
Akira:
I'm so very sorry..

Gottoza-sama:

Akira:

Gottoza-sama:

 Okay? Come here, you freak.

Minoru, Akira:

Minoru, Akira:
Yes, ma'am! We are good!

Gottoza-sama:

 Well, I guess I'm gonna be heading out now.



 

Akira:
Na na na na na na nanana...

Minoru:

 No way, they haven't decided!?
