Kagami:
 Okay, that's pretty awesome, but there's no way I'm telling her of that!

Kagami:
 If anyone can figure it out, don't the rare things get snapped up right away?

Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:
 Really?

Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:
 Maybe "big kid shopping method" is a better name?

Kagami:

Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:
 Maybe they boost up the proportion 'cause the culture of otaku is so extreme.

Konata:


Sojiro:
 That's not the point, but I get where you're coming from.

Yutaka:


Konata:
 Why? They suck.

Yutaka:


Konata:
 Yeah, you are right.

Sojiro:
 But it's just my blood.

Konata:


Yutaka:


Sojiro:


Konata:
 No way!

Sojiro:
 Check it out!

Yutaka, Konata:
 Wow!

Sojiro:
 You are already dead.

Konata:
 And you are already bitten, Dad.

Sojiro:
 And if you flex your arm harder, the mosquito explodes.

Yutaka:
 No, stop it, don't do it!

Sojiro:
 Oh, itchy, itchy, itchy...

Konata:
 Maybe it would have been better to whack it after all.
Konata:


Miyuki:


Konata:
 Yeah?

Yutaka:


Minami:



Konata:
 Come on in...

 It is way past noon.


Game:
It's morning, Kona-chan! Rise and shine!
Would you like to have lunch with me, Izumi-kun?
I thought we could walk home together today, Konata-kun...

Kagami:
 Hey, Konata.

Konata:

Kagami:


Konata:


Game:
Oh, come on, you have to do all your homework first!
...that it's not like I'm worried about you or anything.
If that's what you want, Konata, I'll do it...

Kagami:
 Hey, Konata.

Konata:
 Hm?

Kagami:


Konata:

Yui:

Kagami:


Konata:
 Wait, you're saying this kind of stuff happens to you too?

Kagami:

Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:
 Just to find out the rest of the episodes are totally lame.


Yutaka:
 Oneichan, may I please change the channel?

Konata:

 Uh-huh. It's a special show about desserts from all over Japan.

Konata:


Konata:


Yutaka:

Miyuki:
 Huh...

Tsukasa:


Miyuki:
 Unfortunately, I had to go to the dentist yesterday.

Tsukasa:

Miyuki:
 Half way through the procedure, I got to run away.

Dentist:
You'll be sure to tell me if this hurts, won't you?

Miyuki:
 That hurts! That hurts!

Dentist:
It'll be over soon, I promise.

Miyuki:
 Okay...

Miyuki:
 And that's how my appointment went.

Tsukasa:


Konata:


Kagami:


Tsukasa:
 Oh, remember we had all those posters and art projects to do?

Konata:

Tsukasa:


Kagami:
 Oh yeah, I think I remember that one.

Tsukasa:


Kagami:
 If I was him, I would have been pissed.
Haruhi:
The next time you're at the store, pick up a case!

Tsukasa:


Kagami:



Konata:
 No way.

Kagami:


Konata:
 Hah, wake me up when it's over.

Kagami:
 Make yourself at home, why don't you?

Konata:

 Um, can I ask you something?

Konata:


Yutaka:


Girls:


Yutaka:
 Oh, okay.

Kagami:

 Hey Kagami, when's that festival of yours happening?

Kagami:


Konata:

 Hey, how's it going?

Kagami:
 Oh, hey there, Patricia-san.

Patricia:
 Did you guys all come to see the fireworks too?

Tsukasa:
 You look good in a yukata.

Tsukasa:

Konata, Yutaka:
 You're kidding.

Konata:
 Uh, how trippy, Miyuki-san, I didn't know Minami-chan was your neighbor.

Miyuki:
 It is a coincidence!

Yutaka:
 Yeah, I'm really surprised!

Minami:
 Mm-hm.

Yukari:
 Bon appetit!

Everyone:
Thank you, Mrs. Takara.

 But Mom, were you counting yourself along with all the rest of us?

Yukari:

Miyuki:
 Nine.

Yukari:


Konata:
 Awesome...

Everybody:
Thanks for having us over!

Yutaka:
 So this is Minami-chan's house!

Hiyori:
 Wow, big scary dog!

Yutaka:


Hiyori:


Yutaka:
 I guess she's the type who makes doggies growl.
Konata:


Tsukasa:


Kagami:
 Here we go...

Patricia:

Hiyori:
 Yeah, you're right.

Konata:


Miyuki:
 Yes, I suppose so.

Konata:


Minami:
 Oh...

Yutaka:


Kagami:
 Yeah, but...

Minami:


Yutaka:
 Minami-chan!


Miyuki:
 That was wonderful.

Kagami:
 I know this totally felt like a summer vacation!

Konata:


Kagami:
 If you scratch, it's just gonna itch more.

Konata:


Tsukasa:
 Yeah, I know!


Minami:
 Pretty...

Yutaka:


Konata:


Yutaka:


Tsukasa:


Konata:
 Maybe the squitoes didn't wanna ruin the mood over here.
Akira:

Daisuke:
And I'm her assistant, Daisuke Ono, at your service.

Akira:
 Did you know that today is Lucky channel's 20th episode?
 So I guess you are not a crow today?

Daisuke:
And it looks like you are not a dog today.

Akira:

Daisuke:
Ooh, I wonder where our intrepid adventurer, Shiroishi-kun,
is right about now?

Akira:
 Wow, Mt. Fuji is so pretty.
 Well, I guess that'sa lot.
 Okay, good by-nee.

Misao:
Now, Ayano's ignoring me.
