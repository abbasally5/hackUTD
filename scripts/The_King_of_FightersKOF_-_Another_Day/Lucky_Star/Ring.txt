Konata:
Good morning, Kagami.

Kagami:
Oh, hey, you look like you're in a good mood today.

Konata:
You bet I am.
I traded in my old cell phone for a new one. [ Trade in A for B :Aを下取りに出しBを入手する]

Kagami:
Good. It’s about time. The new cell phones are so cool.
You can set up a song as your ringtone and even customize your screen.

Konata:
Oh, I already trick it out with my favorites.

Kagami:
Heck of a ringtone you got there.

Konata:
Yeah, right?
But it kinda sucks 'cause you have to pick up before the chorus starts playing.
And you know what happens if you don’t answer?
It stops in the middle of the song.

Kagami:
I never really got into it. But okay if that’s how it works.


Konata:
If I had to choose, Kagami would be... an orc.

Kagami:
Why do I have to be the only monster?
Ah! Oh, yes, hello? Hiiragi speaking.
Yeah, no, I answer the phone at home that way, yeah…

Konata:
Is it just me or was she super hyper mad a couple of seconds ago?
What's up with that?
How come women are able to switch gears so fast?

Miyuki:
Hmm, that reminds me of what happened the other day.

"Hello, Mother, I'm home."

Yukari:
"Ah! Who is it!? Miyuki!?"
"Oh! Miyuki, you have a phone call. It's Konata-chan."

Konata:
“Did I do something wrong or something?"

Miyuki:
"No, it’s not you."
"You see, my mother is sort of an open book."
"She can’t conceal her anger very well."
"I think she accidentally kicked the corner of her desk."

Konata:
Oh, yeah, but I don’t get how any of that relates to opening books.

Miyuki:
Her personality is exactly what you see.

Yukari:
"You're so smart, Miyuki."
"I can always count on you for answers to things."
"You help me out so much. Do you know that?"

Miyuki:
"Getting a complement from my mother made me so happy
that I got into the habit of looking up the answers to things."

Yukari:
"I can’t believe it, Miyuki. You know more than I do."

Miyuki:
"As a result, learning new things became a joy."

Yukari:
"I guess this means that I did a bang-up job of raising you, doesn’t it?"
[do a bang-up job:最高の仕事をする、非常に良いことをする]

Miyuki:
And that’s what she said.

Konata:
You talk about the loopiest things.
Well, there is one thing I know for sure.
There is absolutely no doubt that you are your mother’s daughter, Miyuki-san.

Miyuki:
Are we that alike?

Konata:
Yep, down to the last pink hair.

Kagami:
Although one thing's for sure, you really do know a lot of stuff, Miyuki.
And not just the things they teach us in school.

Miyuki:
There are so many places to find answers.
That's what ultimately makes learning fun.

Konata:
Bleah!
Sounds like a lot work to me.
I think I'll pass, I’d rather play, and I'll ask for help when I get stuck.

Kagami:
They say selfish people either come from being the oldest childor the only child.
Come to think of it, Miyuki. You are an only child, aren't you?
Never mind. I guess it depends on the person after all.

Miyuki:
Actually there is some truth to that.
You see there’s someone at home whose behavior is,
well, slightly older-sisterish.

Yukari:
"Cleaning's such a chore! Laundry's exhausting! I wanna order takeout."

Kagami:
You know, we’ve got two sisters, so we had to get tough fast.
Everytime we sat down for dinner, it turned into a battle for food.

Tsukasa:
Yay, it’s sukiyaki!

Tadao:
Eat up, every one.

Hiiragis:
Thank you for the food.

Tsukasa:
Kona-chan was saying how when your cell phone isn’t getting reception,
it’s 'cause the density of the something or other particles are high.

Tadao:
Wow, you don't say.

Tsukasa:
Yeah, and she says when the battery goes dead, it means the situation’s silenced.

Tadao:
Boy, you kids are using some strange words these days.

Kagami:
Hey, come on guys, we have to leave some for Tsukasa, you know.
Tsukasa, you can have some of mine, okay.

Tsukasa:
Oh, thank you, Sis.

Inori:
Come on, Kagami, you were wolfing it down just like everyone else.


Konata:
Hum, then having siblings is both good and bad.

Miyuki:
And there’s good and bad things about being an only child as well.

Tsukasa:
Oh, like how you sorta space out every now and then, Yuki-chan?

Miyuki:
Uh, I space out?

Tsukasa:
Yeah, you know like the other day.

Konata:
I don't know about road apples　　　. [road apple: 道に落ちている馬ふん]
I mean if you were an apple, how would you feel?

Miyuki:
Ouch! Hahaha..

Konata:
You okay, there?

Miyuki:
I'm afraid I was deep in thought and not paying enough attention.
And I walked right into the door.

Konata:
Oh, Miyuki-san, you concentrate too hard.

Tsukasa:
That happens to you a lot, huh?

Miyuki:
Yes, and it’s really embarrassing.

Konata:
Hold it.
If you’re doing one thing and then you start thinking about something else
in the middle of doing it, doesn’t it mean that you lack concentration?
Wait! What I just say?

Kagami:
I don’t know, Miyuki, that sounds just like you.

Miyuki:
I know.
Just the other day, I was warming up a drink in the microwave and...

Oh, I forgot all about it.
Silly me.
I'll just warm it up again.
Oh! Oh, I have to do it again.
Oh! Not again.
Oh! Umm..

Yukari:
Oh, Miyuki, you poor thing. You forgot again.

Miyuki:
I’m sorry. I did.

Yukari:
I'll take care of it for you. I’ll bring it over when it’s ready. Okay, hon?

Miyuki:
Thanks, mother, you’re the best.

Yukari:
Potchi-to-na.

I forgot.

Konata:
As I was saying, you are your mother’s daughter.

Miyuki:
I know. It’s so embarrassing.

Konata:
So Miyuki-san, when did you start wearing glasses anyway?

Miyuki:
Huh, let’s see.
I think maybe halfway through elementary school?

Kagami:
Really? If you weren’t born with bad eye sight, why did you have to get glasses?

Miyuki:
When I was little, one of the things I really loved was how my mother used to read books to me in bed.
My mother always fell asleep before I did.
And I wanted to know how the story ended, so I'd keep reading in the dark.
And that’s what happened.

Kagami:
It's good for kids to have a relationship with their parents like Miyuki does with her mom.
There is a reason why the kids today seem so aloof. [aloof: 冷たい、打ち解けない]
If they’d never experienced parents’ love or that kind of intimacy, they eventually end up that way.

Tsukasa:
You know, I can’t remember the last time I got a big hug from mom.
I wonder if that means I’m at risk?

Kagami:
Oh, not even. Come on, don’t you remember?
You were practically attached to mom until the seventh grade.

Tsukasa:
Huh? No, I wasn't.

Kagami:
You were too. That’s why you are such a Goody-Two-Shoes. [Goody-Two-Shoes:　いい子ちゃん]


Konata:
Well, in my family, it’s the other way around.
Dad’s the one who’s super clingy.

Kagami:
Maybe that’s why you never really grew up.
What do you think of that, shorty?

Konata:
Speaking of kids, haven’t there been a lot of cases lately
where young girls get kidnapped, or held captive?

Kagami:
Why are you so fascinated by stuff like that anyway?

Konata:
Because I’m worried about my dad, that’s why.

Kagami:
Wow, that didn’t sound scary at all.

Konata:
I guess if you really wanted to, you could blame behavior like that on games or something. [blame A on B :A をBのせいのする]
But, I wish they’d stop.
'Cause it’s gonna spoil the fun for the other users.

Kagami:
I wouldn’t even begin to know what you are talking about,
'cause none of that stuff is in any of the games I play.

Konata:
Oh, I just remembered that my one-year anniversary’s coming up.

Kagami:
Yeah, for what?

Konata:
For my part-time job. That’s what.
And the guys at work all wanna do something to celebrate.
Isn’t that cool about?

Kagami:
That's right. I haven’t come by to see you yet.
Maybe I'll come visit you while you are working sometime.
It’ll be payback for New Year's.

Konata:
You should come by.

Kagami:
No way! Wouldn’t I be bothering you, if I came by like that?

Konata:
Not even. Getting stared at is part of the job.
So it’s no biggie.

Tsukasa:
Oh, that’s right. It’s a cosplay café.

Konata:
Just let me know ahead of time when you wanna cruise by
and I’ll get you in.
'Cause the place can get kinda busy.

Kagami:
Okay, we will.

Kuroi:
Excuse me, guys, but class has started.


Kagami:
Oh, hey, it's us.
Yeah, we just walked out of the station.
Hum? Yeah, yeah, I'll take 'em up for you. Don't worry.
Sure, bye.

Tsukasa:
Did Kona-chan say it was okay?

Kagami:
Yeah, she said it's cool to come by, but we have to go over there
and pick up this month's Comp"beep" and a Lelou"beep" manga for her first.

Miyuki:
I hope finding them won't be too difficult.

Kagami:
Me too. She also wants me to get the receipts stamped by the cashier.
Man, talk about confusing.

Camera boy A
Excuse me, do you mind? I.. I just wanna take a picture.

Tsukasa:
But I'm not Kamigishi, um, I'm Hiiragi.

Kagami:
Hey! guy, whatthe hell are you doing?

Camera boy B
Hey, over here, can I get a shot, please?

Kagami:
No, cut it out!

Camera boy A
Um, could you please say, "Hiroyuki-chan" for me?

Tsukasa:
Um, Hi..Hiroyuki..

Kagami:
We are going now.

Miyuki:
This is the first time I’ve ever been in a store like this.
It’s so big. It’s overwhelming.

Kagami:
On the phone she said we couldn't miss it once we got inside.


Tsukasa:
I'd get lost if I was in here by myself.
But I bet Kona-chan would be all right at home.

Kagami:
Oh! Here it is.
Okay, where the heck do I find a Lelou”beep”ch manga?

Tsukasa:
It’s not here.

Miyuki:
I can’t find it either.

Kagami:
Excuse me, I'm having a hard time finding a Lelou"beep”ch manga.
Where do you keep it?

Hinata
Oh, we have it right here.
Is this what you are looking for?

Kagami:
What's the Code Gea”beep”ss.
Typical, she could have at least given me the title to make it easier to find.

Kagami:
Can I get the points for this, put on my card the next time I come in?

Hinata
Yeah, just make sure bring your card along with this receipt.

Kagami:
Okay, thanks.

Hinata
Thank you for shopping with us. Please come again.

Kagami:
Now we can go visit Konata at her job.

Hikage
I’m really hungry, Sis.

Hinata
Hang on for a few more minutes.
I’ll be getting off work in a bit.

Kagami:
Huh. How’d she expect us to find it with a map like this?

Miyuki:
Actually, I looked up the location before I left.
According to this, it’s over there.

Tsukasa:
That’s our Yuki-chan.

Kagami:
Leave it to Miyukito save the day once again.
Is this the right place?

Miyuki:
Yes, it’s on the third floor.


Konata:
Welcome back, master. Won’t you come in, please?
Make yourselves comfortable.
Okay, the first hour’s gonna be eight hundred yen
and you get free refills on all soft drinks.
Oh, and the games are all free to play
and the sweets are all-you-can-eat.

Kyon customer:
I think I’ll try the eel bowl.

Nagato waitress:
We are out of eel.

Kyon customer:
Um. Then I guess the shrimp pilaf.

Nagato waitress:
We are not able to do that.

Kyon customer:
Huh? Then how about the spaghetti in meat sauce?

Nagato waitress:
It takes fifteen minutes to prepare.

Kyon customer:
Hm...

Nagato waitress:
May I?

Kyon customer:
Ok, let's do it then.

Kagami:
With service like that, how do they stay in business?

Konata:
Attention, people! You guys wanna order or what?

Kagami:
Yeah, just hang on a second.

Konata:
Come on, hurry up! If you are late, there’s a penalty, penalty!

Kagami:
Is this how you treat all your customers?

Konata:
Yeah, that’s kind of the protocol here.
Have you made up your minds yet?

Tsukasa:
I’ll have the melon soda.

Konata:
Ordinary menu items don’t interest me.

Tsukasa:
Huh?

Miyuki:
I think I’d like to have the milk tea, please.

Konata:
Come on, come on, what do you want?

Kagami:
Chill out, I’m still deciding!

Konata:
For a brigade member, you sure are slow.

Kagami:
I’m not a brigade member.

Konata:
You are, if you are my customer.
Your brigade leader is not in the mood for any of your lip.

Kagami:
You are giving me a headache.
I, I don’t know. An iced coffee, whatever.

Konata:
Your brigade leader orders you to wait here.

Kagami:
Oh, brother!

Kagami:
It hasn't been that stinky in a while.

Konata:
Okay guys, get ready, ‘cause the show’s about to start.


Tsukasa:
Oh, wow!

Miyuki:
That was an amazing performance!

Konata:
Yeah, she’s an exchange student and she’s in tenth grade
and she’s going to our school.

Patricia:
It's really nice to meet you guys.
My name is Patricia Martin. How do you do?

Konata:
And guess what. We’ve also got a CD out. Check it!

Kagami:
You're not seriously trying to sell that, are you?

Miyuki:
Oh, excuse me. May I have some tea, please?

Patricia:
Absolutely! Would you like it hot?

Miyuki:
Yes please, hot would be perfect.

Tsukasa:
Oh, may I please have a melon soda?

Patricia:
Melon soda, coming up.

Kagami:
Let’s see.
What’s in the we-decide-what-juice-we-mix-in-this-drink drink?

Patricia:
Yeah, that's classified.

Konata:
Protocol, baby.

Kagami:
Could this place be any more exhausting?


Yutaka:
Oh, no! I’m so tiny.

Minami:
You'll be fine. You'll see, as you get older, I'm sure you'll grow taller.

Yutaka:
Really, you think so?

Hey, Oneichan!

Konata:
Oh, hey, Yu-chan.

Yutaka:
Ah! And then she comes along and shatters all the hope I had.
Well, I was wondering how much taller have you gotten
since you started high school.

Konata:
Huh? Oh, well, I haven’t seen a difference either vertically or horizontally.
I wouldn’t get my hopes up, if I were you.

Yutaka:
Ahh!?

Konata:
Oh, don’t be sad. There’s a demand out there for you too.


Konata:
I was wondering if either of you guys have ever been to a class reunion.

Miyuki:
Huh, no, I can’t say that I have.

Tsukasa:
Yeah, I haven’t either.
What’s up? Why are you asking?

Konata:
You know how you hear people saying things like
"Oh! You haven’t changed a bit."
In most of the time it’s meant to be a compliment.
But the only people who really wanna hear something like that
are the ones who have changed normally.
If you know what I mean.

Tsukasa:
I know exactly what you mean.

Kuroi:
Well, I know you’re all excited about Golden Week starting up.
But first, I wanna remind you you got tests after the holiday
and those entrance exams that are coming up.
The break’s a good time to prep for that stuff.
Also, since there’s only a couple of days before vacation starts,
there’s no way in hell I'll let you take any sick days.

Shiraishi:
Kamchatka!


Anisawa:
I’d know that aura anywhere.
No doubt about it. It’s the Legendary Girl A.

Sugita:
Is today’s target that new book, or maybe a collectable?

Anisawa:
Think, man.
Did you forget that we’re in the middle of our “Spring AV”,
that’s audio/visual sale?
Not yet!
Leave her be.
Once her guard’s down, pounce her on with a recommendation.
Good, now wait for her to get a little closer, closer.
Now! Go get her!

Sugita:
Going in!
Welcome to the store!
These just came in today!

Konata:
What up, Kagami, yeah, you are outside?
Cool! I’m walking out the door now.

Anisawa, Sugita:
She was just killing time waiting for her friend!


Tsukasa:
The trick to cooking any simmer dish is
to chop all your ingredients into random shapes.

Miyuki:
Oh! I never knew that.

Tsukasa:
Doing it like that increases the surface area
and lets the flavor soak in.

Konata:
Skim the junk off the top and simmer on medium for about ten minutes.
If it cooks too long, it’s no good.
So just stick a toothpick in it to make sure that it’s ready.

Miyuki:
Oh, I see.

Kagami:
You know, I still can't get over the fact
that Miyuki is below average in home ec class. [home ec : home economics, 家政学]


Konata:
I think I'm finally starting to understand how you see us, Kagami.





Ayano:
Hiiragi-chan, if you don’t mind, would you like to meet us
in the library and study for the exams together?

Kagami:
Oh, yeah, sure.

Misao:
Ugh, doesn’t it suck? How before exams,
they cancel the after school stuff and end up with nothing to do.

Kagami:
It's 'cause you're supposed to be studying.
That's why there’s nothing going on.

Misao:
Yeah, I understand why it’s done that way.
It’s just that now that I got all this free time after school,
it’s sorta opening up a whole new world for me, you know.
With that kind of time on my hands, I don’t wanna sit around
and waste my time studying.
I’m gonna get all antsy and stuff. [antsy: そわそわする]

Kagami:
Okay, so this little study session you guys wanna do, yeah,
you’re half the reason we're doing it.
You know that right?


Misao:
I’m tired.

Kagami:
Already!?

Misao:
Come on, let’s take a little break, huh?

Kagami:
Maybe you can’t concentrate,
because you haven’t set a clear goal for yourself.
Don’t you have any dreams for the future?

Misao:
A dream, huh?
It’s not really a dream but around this time of year,
don’t you guys get bored and wish you could like win a lottery
or something and go on living the easy life somewhere?
That would be cool.

Kagami:
Minegishi, do something about that, would you?

Misao:
When I’m studying this hard,
I totally need something sweet to eat or I’ll die.

Ayano:
The other day I baked some cookies and if you want,
after we're done here, I'll bring you some.

Kagami:
Huh, Minegishi, I didn't know you liked baking.

Ayano:
Not as much as that Ajiyoshi-boy.

Misao:
Hers are way more delish than Ajiyoshi's.

Konata:
"Studying is a total drag!"

Tsukasa:
"Hey, Sis, I tried baking some madeleines."

Ayano, Misao:
What's wrong with you?

Kagami:
Oh, well, um... It's not that I’m comparing you to them or anything.
But isn’t it weird how people tend to attract similar types of friends?


TV voice:
I don't see how you could take all this lightly;
I mean you do realize this isn't a canker sore.

Konata:
Can you believe how many medical shows are
on TV these days?

Soujiro
Tell me about it.

Yutaka:
The scary thing is a lot of this stuff could really happen,
especially to me.

Konata:
Hum... When I watch a show like this,
I can't stop thinking about how I'm gonna die someday,
how it's gonna happen. The possibilities are endless.

Soujiro:
Could we change the subject,
'cause it's starting to get depressing?
You have to stay alive, you hear. Live!


Tsukasa:
Hum, oh, hey, Sis, could you help me with this?

Matsuri:
Let’s see. "Curses, like chickens, come home to… roost?"
I got it, yeah.
Chris likes chickens, so when he comes home...
he’s gonna wanna have roast chicken for dinner, see?
I think...
Oh, hey, Sis, could you tell her what the rest of this means?

Inori:
Huh? Wowsers! "When you make the contract…"
Sorry, I’m not good at stuff like this.
 [wowsers：おやおや、やれやれ、うわー等の感嘆を表す、アニメのガジェット警部のお得意のせりふ（らしい）]

Matsuri:
Oh, this totally reminds me.
The other day, I was working at the shrine
and I heard some tourists talking about why the arch’s called a torii.

Inori:
Yeah, what'd they say?

Matsuri:
They say birds, tori, carried the dead
and the arch was the place for them to rest.
So they called it a tori i, birds stay, tori i, tori-i, torii. Get it?
They know more about Japan than we do.

Tsukasa:
It would have been faster if I just asked Kagami about it.

Come on, Nagato, we’re gonna lose the audience like that.
You need to sound more… happy.
You know, like that voice you hear on TV on Sunday nights
around six thirty.
Now try it again. Go!
