  Yui:
 Yutaka! C'mon, we gotta get going.

Yutaka:
 Oops-a-daisy.

Yui:
 Okay, Sis. Get ready for the first day of your new life!
 Let's rock, man!

Yutaka:
 Arghhh...! Ah!



Yui:
 Attention everyone!
 I'm here to announce that Yutaka got accepted!

Sojiro:
 Woohoo, bring her in already.

Yui:
 Come on, Yutaka.

Yutaka:
 Well, I just wanted to say thank you for letting me stay with you.
 And I promise I won't be any trouble.

Konata:
 Just go ahead and make yourself at home here, okay?

Yutaka:
 Oh, thanks!

Konata:
 By the way, congrats on getting accepted.

Yutaka:
 Oh, thank you.

Yui:
 Man, I'm so glad you got accepted.

Konata:
 You'll get to hang out with that handkerchief girl...

Sojiro
 I'm a winner.
 I'm living the dream!



Yutaka:
 Urgh... Phew...

Minami:
 Are you all right?

Yutaka:
 Uh, ah...

Minami:
 Do you want me to take you to the nurse's office?



Yutaka:
 She actually talked to me.
 And then she let me borrow her handkerchief.
 It makes me all happy 'cause I'm gonna have a best friend now.

Yui:
 That's really cool and all.
 But what if she doesn't get accepted?

Yutaka:
 Oh... No!
 People like her always get accepted!
 Always!

Yui:
 I know how you feel, it's just...

Yutaka:
 But she is probably really smart too!

Yui:
 I didn't say she wasn't.
 Thanks for clearing that up, though.

Konata:
 Hang on, Yu-chan...
 What would you have done, if you didn't get accepted?

Yutaka:
 Urgh... I know, I know.
 Don't remind me, uh...

Konata:
 Don't sweat it, Yu-chan,
 I'm sure you're gonna be okay.

Yutaka:
 You're right!
 I'll see her again on the day they announce the names
 of the people who got accepted!

Konata:
 Yeah, maybe...

Yutaka:
 I still have to return the handkerchief to her.

[Notification: Acceptances and rejections will both be notified by mail.]

Yutaka:
 Uh...



Yutaka:
 Excuse me.

Minami:
 Hm...

Yutaka:
 Here...
 I'm really glad to see you again.
 And I've been wanting to give this back to you.

Minami:
 You wanna give it back?

Yutaka:
 Yes.

Minami:
 Sorry, I didn't wanna trouble you.
 I gave it to you, thinking that you would keep it.
 To be honest, I really didn't think I'd ever see you again.

Yutaka:
 You didn't think I'd be accepted here, did you?

Minami:
 No...
 I see. Now, I get it.
 You must be in the same grade as I am.
 I'm sorry. I didn't realize.

Yutaka:
 It's okay.
 I guess you thought I was someone's kid sister.

Minami:
 My family is picking me up today, so...

Yutaka:
 Oh, okay.

Minami:
 Well, good-bye then.

Yutaka:
 Um... I hope that the next year is gonna be awesome for us!

Yutaka:
 I'm so lucky.
 I haven't even started high school
 and I've already got a good friend.
 Oh... I forgot to ask her name...


Konata:
 When you see her again, make sure you ask for her name.

Yutaka:
 Hm!



Konata:
 Hm? How are you feeling?
 Are you sick or something?

Yutaka:
 Oh, yeah... It was the ride over.
 I got a little carsick, I did take some medicine, though.
 Don't worry, I'll be okay in a bit.

Yui:
 Yutaka is such a frail and delicate little girl, ain't she!

Konata:
 Wait! Sure she is.
 But seriously, do you have any idea what your driving's like, Oneisan?
 I mean... even I got a little...

Yutaka:
 I wonder if I'm gonna get along with all my new classmates
 in Ryouou High.
 I mean I'm the only one out of my old school that made it in.
 And if I get sick real easy like today...

Yui:
 Don't worry, Yutaka, you're a good girl, you'll be fine!

Yutaka:
 Oooh, stop treating me like a little kid!

Konata:
 Hm... Thinking... Converting...

Konata:
 If you and Miyuki-san teamed up, that would be
 the most awesomest thing in the history of everything!

Yutaka:
 Huh?



Yutaka:
 Huh? That's right, I'm living in Konata-oneichan's house now...

Yutaka:
 Uh, ah!
 Good morning, oneichan.
 Why are you up so early on a holiday?

Konata:
 Huh? Oh, actually, I was about to jump into bed.
 So I guess it's good-night.
 I was up playing games all night....

Yutaka:
 This place is way different than my house!



Kagami:
 You know how we've got college entrance exams
 coming up next year?
 We've been getting all these calls from cram schools
 and telemarketers selling textbooks.
 Man, they are so annoying.

Miyuki:
 However, if you have Caller ID on your phone,
 you can tell right away if someone like that is calling you.
 On the display, the number shows up as "restricted."

Kagami:
 I'm home!
 Uh... Caller ID, huh...

Miyuki:
 Hello, mother, I'm home!

Yukari:
 Oh, you can't be serious.
 I can't imagine how much trouble that must have been.
 Oh, no, it's the same way in our family.
 Absolutely.
 I'm sorry to cut you off, but my daughter's just come home.
 Yes, yes, we'll talk again soon.
 All right then, have a wonderful day.

Miyuki:
 Who were you talking to?
 It sounded like a lively conversation.

Yukari:
 Oh, that was just a telemarketer.

Miyuki:
 Um, Mother, I'm sorry, but didn't you see it was a telemarketer
 when they were calling?

Yukari:
 Yes, but I was bored.
 So I decided to have a conversation anyway.
 And we ended up talking for more than an hour.



Cashier:
Okay, the total comes to...

Konata:
 What was that about winning the national championship?!

Tsukasa:
 What's wrong, Kona-chan?

Konata:
 Uh... Tsukasa, the world's a war zone,
 you can never show mercy, ever!
 The other day, I saw this thing I wanted to get with my reward-points.
 So I thought "Do I go offense and get it or defense and save my points?"
 So I got it!
 But there is a new thing that just came out,
 I wanna get it before anyone else!
 It's that one over there!
 But I don't have enough points!
 What will I do? What will I do? Aha...

Kagami:
 Someone sure enjoys their life, don't they.

Cashier:
Um, you're gonna pay?



Waitress:
Okay, where would you all like to sit, smoking or non-smoking?

Kagami:
 Uh, yeah, since we're a little on the underage side,
 maybe we'll go with non-smoking.

Waitress:
Come this way, please.

Tsukasa:
 Um, I gotta go to the bathroom first.

Kagami:
 Okay.

Konata:
 Oh, hey, Tsukasa, we're over here, over here!

Kagami:
 Took you long enough.

Tsukasa:
 I know, uh sorry.
 I have to say this 'cause I think about it a lot.
 But you know, when you go to a restaurant and need to use the bathroom,
 how come it's always by the smoking section?

Konata:
 Yeah, right.

Kagami:
 Especially since we went out of our way to get non-smoking.

Tsukasa:
 Hm...

Kagami:
 Seriously though, I wonder why they have it like that.

Konata:
 Well, if someone starts a fire, they got a place close by
 where they can get their hands on some water.
 They can fill up buckets there and hook up a hose.

Kagami:
 Oh, I didn't know they had a hose back there...

Konata:
 Of course they do.
 You didn't know they had a hose?
 Huh, that's right, someone's never worked a single day out
 in the real world.
 No, she hasn't. No, not at all.

Kagami:
 Okay, shut up!

Tsukasa:
 A one covers the stink of the other, maybe?

Kagami:
 We're gonna eat, so stop talking about toilets and stinks.
 It's kinda gross, okay?



Newscaster:
And another news, a number of incidents have occurred recently,
where girls on their way to elementary school
have been approached from behind and harassed by a stranger...

Konata:
 We're starting to see a lot of stuff like that happening to kids lately.
 You'd better be careful when you go out, Yu-chan.

Yutaka:
 Uh... Yeah, I will.

Sojiro:
 Unacceptable!
 But I can understand how he's probably feeling.

Konata:
 Do you understand 'em?

Sojiro:
 They talk about this guy on the news every day,
 making a big deal out of him.
 It's amazing to think that there's someone out there
 harassing little girls like that.
 And if I had the chance I'd tell him, "Aren't you jealous of me?"

Konata:
 I'm a little worried about your thinking, Dad.
 Just please don't do anything that Yui-neisan can arrest you for,
 okay?

Yutaka:
 Huh?



Konata:
 Is anybody home?!

Tsukasa:
 Yes!

Konata:
 Yoohoo! Hello!

Tsukasa:
 Come on in!

Konata:
 Where's Kagami? What's she up to?

Tsukasa:
 Oh, she's hanging out with the couple of her friends from class.

Konata:
 Oh, yeah...?
 It's just... I don't know...
 It feels like something's missing and it's frustrating...

Tsukasa:
 Maybe 'cause you miss her.




Konata:
 Ah, is it to me or it's gotten super warm out lately.

Tsukasa:
 Yeah, it has.

Konata:
 Isn't it peaceful now that we are on spring break
 and don't have any homework to do?

Tsukasa:
 Yeah, it is.

Kagami:
 Yes, it is.
 And I think that line's reserved for those who actually do their homework,
 as opposed to copying it.



Game:
Don't hit any strange places!
That's impossible!

Tsukasa:
 Oh.

Kagami:
 So, when you're playing robot games like this,
 do you really know who all the characters are and stuff?

Konata:
 Yeah, I guess you could say I do.

Kagami:
 Hm, really...
 'Cause I remember you said that your taste in anime and manga
 was all because of your dad.

Konata:
 Yup.

Kagami:
 Oh, yeah? So when you were younger, did you have a hard time
 keeping up with the girls when they started talking girls' stuff?

Konata:
 Hm? I didn't have a hard time keeping up with anything.
 I got to see way more of that kinda stuff than they ever did.

Kagami:
 Eh, uh? Yeah... Okay...



Chairman:
Is that your final answer?

Answerer:
It's my final answer!

Everyone:
Uh..... Whew...

Matsuri:
 Man, that big all pause he takes kills me every time.

Kagami:
 And his face is so big. It's scary.

Tsukasa:
 Oh, it looks like the show is about to end.
 I guess she got the question wrong.

Kagami:
 Oh, c'mon!
 You're guessing if they got the question right by looking at
 how much time the show's got left before the commercial.

Tsukasa:
 Yeah, but I can't stand this suspense of not-knowing.
 They drag it out too long.

Kagami:
 But the show is all about enjoying that part of it!

Matsuri:
 Yup, that's our Tsukasa.



Kagami:
 He-hey, you!

Konata:
 Hey you two!
 Well, here she is, my cousin, Yu-chan.
 C'mon, say "Hi."

Yutaka:
 It's nice to meet you.
 I'm Yutaka Kobayakawa.

Konata:
 And these are my best friends, Kagami and Tsukasa.

Yutaka:
 Yeah, I know you are the ones oneichan always talks about.

Kagami:
 Oh? What kinda stuff has she been saying about us?

Yutaka:
 Um...

Kagami:
 What in the hell have you been telling this girl?
 The way she looked just now, I wonder...

Konata:
 See? You see? What I tell ya.



Tsukasa:
 So, did you already have your graduation ceremony?

Yutaka:
 Oh, yes, the other day.

Kagami:
 Wow, graduation!
 What memories huh, guys?

Konata:
 I don't really remember my graduation ceremony.

Kagami:
 So, did you get a button from any of the guys in your class,
 Yutaka-chan?

Yutaka:
 Oh, no, I didn't.
 At my old junior high, our uniform was a blazer.

Kagami:
 That's right.
 I guess a lot of schools are like that these days.
 Although, maybe it's because there's not a whole lot of that
 "getting something from your crush" stuff going on anymore.

Tsukasa:
 You really think so?
 That sounds kinda sad.
 But I guess I never did it myself.

Konata:
Every now and then, I read a blog where someone's talking about that stuff.
 So it's sorta still going on.

Kagami:
 Huh.

Konata:
 Wait a minute, it's all about getting something from someone you like, right?

Tsukasa:
 Isn't that the whole point of doing it?

Konata:
 But then you totally out yourself as having a crush on a guy
 when you go get the button, why don't you ask the guy out
 and get the whole guy instead of just a button.
"I got you, man!"

Tsukasa:
 Ideally, yeah, I guess that's what you'd wanna have it happened.
 So, Yutaka-chan, did you have someone that you had a crush on
 or something?

Yutaka:
 Oh, not me.
 I had to stay home a lot 'cause I felt sick.
 Even when I went to class I'd start feeling ill.
 I think I kinda made everyone around me depressed.
 And there's the fact that I'm really short and frail
 and I kinda look like a little kid.
 Everyone was always making fun of me.
 Why would anybody fall in love with me, you know?

Konata:
 You'll be fine, Yu-chan!
 There's definitely a need for girls like you as long as you aren't picky.

Yutaka:
 Huh? Picky?



Konata:
 Po-cky.
Konata:
 Hey, Yu-chan, can I take a look at your yearbook?

Tsukasa:
 Me, too! I wanna see your yearbook!

Yutaka:
 Well, it's a little embarrassing.
 There's not a lot of pictures of me or anything.

Konata:
 Hmm... So what class were you in again?

Yutaka:
 Wait a second!
 Were you checking the absentee list for my name just now?
 You were, weren't you?

Konata:
 Oh, was I being that obvious?

Yutaka:
 Hmm!



Kagami:
 You wanna know the difference between junior high and high school?

Yutaka:
 Uh-huh.

Tsukasa:
 I know, for one thing, they don't make you join an extracurricular club.

Kagami:
 I don't know, doesn't that depend on the school?
 Well, one difference is that we're a prep school, so our curriculum is
 bigger and faster pace than the one you had in junior high.
 And I guess you'll need more stamina than in junior high
 'cause the commute to school is really long.

Konata:
 One difference I've noticed is that from elementary school
 through high school, the time you spend sleeping
 at your desk gets longer and longer, specially during hard classes!

Tsukasa:
 Yeah, that's totally true!
 Like when you start drifting off 'cause the teacher's talking
 that what's been said sounds like another language.

Kagami:
 No matter what you do, do not end up like them, okay?

Yutaka:
 Um, okay...



Kagami:
 Hey, Yu-chan,
 I see you kept your old junior high uniform?

Yutaka:
 Yeah, I thought maybe I could wear it as my street clothes
 without anyone noticing.
 It looks plain enough, don't you think?

Konata:
 Yeah, I guess.
 Hey, Kagami, what did you guys do with your uniforms?

Kagami:
 Oh, we gave ours to a couple of younger girls in our neighborhood.
 What about you?

Konata:
 What about me?

Kagami:
 You probably couldn't find anyone tiny enough to give it to.

Konata:
 Two things, Kagami, you're rude and shut up.
 Anyway, I did what Yu-chan did.
 I kept mine for cosplay purposes.

Yutaka:
 Co... Cos...?!

Kagami:
 Yeah, when you put it that way, it sounds really bad,
 like really bad.

Konata:
 It's just cosplay, man.



Kagami:
 Talking about it sure brings back memories...
 Sometimes I think it'd be cool to go back to my elementary school
 and junior high, see my old teachers and say hi and stuff...

Konata:
 But there's been all the stuff about people trespassing at schools.
 If you went back, chances are, you get funny looks from everyone.

Kagami:
 Yeah, and if you went back, you would fit right in.
 It would be like you never left.

Konata:
 I'm pretty sure you weren't trying to compliment me there, were you?



Tsukasa:
 Our vacation went by fast this time, didn't it?

Kagami:
 I hear that.
 It's like before you know it, school's about to start all over again.

Konata:
 And now that spring's here, we've got all those physical exams and fitness tests.
 Oh, man, what a pain.

Tsukasa:
 But you are lucky, Kona-chan, your motor nerves are so good.

Konata:
 Hey, Tsukasa...
 Which nerves are supposed to be the motor nerves, anyway?



Yui:
Hello, everybody! How's it going? Sorry I'm late!
 And congrats on the graduating, Yutaka!

Konata:
 Hey, neisan, come on in.

Yui:
 'Cause we're celebrating a graduation,
 how about we all go out drinking together!
 It's my treat!
 Uncle Sojiro's going!
Yutaka:
 Ahhhh, what are you saying...!?

Konata:
 Wow!

Kagami:
 Excuse me, Officer, we're underage...

Yutaka:
 Oneichan, I don't think they'll leave and let us through the door.
 You should know better than that!

Yui:
 Wahahaha...
 They won't notice if you walk in like you're supposed to be there.
 When I was a student, I did it all the time.
 And I've never got caught, man, not even once!

Konata:
 Hurray!

Kagami:
 Uh-uh, your two little relatives would totally blow our cover.



Sojiro:
 Hm, really...

Yutaka:
 Huh!

Konata:
 You'll live.



Sojiro:
 I was thinking it might be nice if we all went out
 to the amusement park or something.
 It's still vacation.

Konata:
 Ooh!

Yutaka:
 Um... That sounds like fun and everything, but you don't have to.
 I don't wanna be your burden.
 I'd feel bad if you go to all that trouble for me.
 Besides, I went there on a field trip with my class the other day.

Konata:
 Hey, I just remembered I went there on a field trip with my class too!
 How about it though, were you okay there?

Yutaka:
 Uh-huh, I didn't get sick the whole time I was there.
 And I got to hang out with my friends.

Konata:
 No, I meant were you okay with the height restrictions on the rides.

Yutaka:
 What are you talking about?! I was fine!
 I'm in high school now, okay?



Yutaka:
 You know, I was watching this school drama show and I got to thinking;
 junior high and high school are totally different, aren't they?

Konata:
 Hm? Oh, well, yeah.

Yutaka:
 And I heard that the lunches aren't given out like in junior high.

Konata:
 Yeah, I guess not.
 Either you bring your own lunch, or you gotta buy one in the cafeteria.
 Or you could buy lunch and bring it.

Yutaka:
 Do you make a lunch to take to school every day, oneichan?

Konata:
 Ugh... Y-yeah, sure...

Yutaka:
 Wow, you're cool!

Konata:
 Uh-oh, this isn't good...

Yutaka:
 She's really good at games.
 She can communicate all kinds of ways.
 And she cooks and does chores!

Konata:
 So, yeah, I think I'm getting an idea of the pressure you feel as an old sister.
 When she looks at me with those big eyes, I feel like I gotta do my best,
 you know.

Kagami:
 Huh?



Yui:
 Uh!

Konata:
 Yui-neisan drives like a maniac.

Yui:
 Woo-ha! What's up?!
 How ya doin'?!

Konata:
 Yui-neisan gets drunk and crashes at our place.

Yui:
 Homework, huh?
 Uh, as long as you keep it vague,
 put down wherever you want.

Konata:
 Yui-neisan says irresponsible things.

Konata:
 But then again, I wonder if it depends on the person.

Kagami:
 I have no idea what you are talking about.





Akira:
My final answer...
 is my ass, buddy.
 I am not doing this any more.
 Uh-uh, there I am, thinking I'd finally got a shot in some screen time,
 and when I watched the damn thing, where did I go!?

Minoru:
And she's mad again.
Shall I do it?
I'm gonna do it.
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna do it

Akira:
 You hear my voice, but you can't see my face!
 I mean what were they thinking when they made the show.
 How could are you wanna get in hosed and xxx those xxx xxx me no talent...

Minoru:
Umm, Akira-sama, you forgot to call out the title, the title!

Akira:
Huh?

Minoru:
Ah, please call out the title, please.
Tiny eyes!?

Akira:
Hiiya, luckies.
 What, and even matters.
 What a frigging clock.
 Right now, I am so disgusted, man.
 All I get are voice, can hear me, just my voice.
 What they xxx do?

Minoru:
Well, they didn't give me any screen time either, so...

Akira:
 Who cares, I wasn't talking about you!

Minoru:
Windy.

Akira:
 Well, sunshine, did anyone ask about you just now, huh?
 At anytime during the conversation,
 was your flipping name ever brought up?

Minoru:
Ah, no, I guess nobody said anything about me.

Akira:
Then why the hell are you butting in like that?
 You just come sliding out with your big fat head.
 What are you, stupid or something?
 Always cutting me off with your me-me-me thing.
 Looks like someone's self-centered, eh, Shiraishi?
 (? Oh the thing is mainly the film in my mouth.)
 Listen up peaches, the problem's that I, Akira Kogami,
 was not shown on screen in the main segment.
 Let me ask you something, I'm an idol right? I am.
 Well, and idols' faces are No.1 asset.
 It needs to be on screen, or am I wrong?

Minoru:
Yes..., I mean no, I mean you are absolutely right.

Akira:
 Huh!? I did not hear you.

Minoru:
What the staff did to you was completely inexcusable
and unprofessional.
May I ask what you're writing over there?

Akira:
Okay, guys, Akira needs your help.
 I need all your support so that I, Akira Kogami, can show up
 in the main segment of the show.
 So make sure you send in whasotever request for it.

Minoru:
What?

Akira:
 I don't care how you get the message out, they'll just push hard for me, okay?
 I really want you guys to see how good an actor I am.
 I really, really want it.
 And just between us, compared to my charm, the other cast members got nothing.
 It's really too sad.
 Yep, it's sorta like you compared an Oscar winning Hollywood actress in a movie
 to a bunch of kindergarteners putting on a skit.
 He-he, my acting's on a higher level. It's pretty. It's gorgeous.
 You wanna see more!
 So here's your chance to do something good, write a letter, leave a comment on this site.
 (? Your voices will count for something.)
 All your wishes will come true, if you guys get me on-camera-role in Lucky Star.
 So when the show's over, I want you all to go get your postcards or go to your little computer then...

Minoru:
Something's wrong?
What? Stop her? Really?
Ah... hey Akira-sama...

Akira:
Shut the hell up!
 What's with all that chitchat when my career's at stake!?
 How many times I gotta tell you, when I'm talking you'd better shut your stupid...
 You're kidding. Oh, I was just getting the part where I tell you how fabulous I am.
 Or maybe I could show you guys just how awesome I am
 in the main segment of the next episode.
 Just kidding.

Minoru:
Yeah, we'll see you all in the next episode.

Akira:
 Bye-nee.
 That was so freaking painful.
 Go get me the producer. Chop-chop!

Minoru:
What? Who? me?

Akira:
 You're awake?

Minoru:
Yeah.

Akira:
 This is supposed to be a revised script, yeah?

Minoru:
Yes.

Akira:
 So what in the hell is the title of our segment?

Minoru:
Well, it's "Lucky Channel".

Akira:
 Yes, script says "Lucky Paradise".

Minoru:
Well, I...

Akira:
 Shut up!

Minoru:
Sorry.

Akira:
 And another thing, they've got some nerve treating me like that.
 Hi, I'm a producer, I worked out the show that was a hit,
 so that means I could be a totally ass now!
 C'mon producer, you mean right now...

Minoru:
No what are you saying!? Stop it!
You can't talk to him like that.





Yutaka:
 On the next episode of Lucky Star.

Minami:
 I'm Minami Iwasaki.

Yutaka:
And I'm Yutaka Kobayakawa.
 I guess they want the two of us
 to introduce the next episode, right?
 But do you know what it's about?

Minami:
 No, I'm sorry, I don't.

Yutaka:
 What, really, oh, that's not good.
 I don't know anything about it either.
 Oh, well, I guess, I'll just wrap it up.
 Next time "I Can't Suddenly Change".
 I hope no one minds we didn’t say anything.

Minami:
 Look forward to it.
