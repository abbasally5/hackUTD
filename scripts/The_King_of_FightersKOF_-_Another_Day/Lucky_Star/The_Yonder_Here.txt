  Konata:
Thanks for that awesome meal.

Yui:
 You got it! I should take you guys out more often!

Yutaka:
 That was really, really good!

Konata:
 Yeah, I know!

Yutaka:
I get happy inside when the eggs are yummy like that.

Yui:
 Ah! Gas is two yen more today than it was yesterday.
 I should have filled up when I had a chance...


Konata:
 Why do people who are generous with their money
 care about gas prices going up a yen or two?

Kagami:
 So you know that book I let you borrow the other day?
 I heard they're turning it into a game now.
 What do you think about that?

Konata:
Jeez, Kagami, that's old news!
 I went and pre-ordered the limited edition the second they announced it.
 Then I bought the box set of the anime and a bunch of other related stuff.

Kagami:
Wow, you've got more hooked than me.

Konata:
If someone recommends something, the person they recommend it to
 usually becomes a bigger fan than the person doing the recommending.
 That’s how Yui-neisan bought her car.

Kagami:
No way!

Konata:
 Yup! Right after I loaned her a manga with a car racing theme.
 When I found out, I was like, "Whoa!"


Kagami:
Having a hobby can be a scary thing.

Konata:
 I guess last night makes three in a row, huh?

Kuroi:
Yeah, talk about a miracle, right?
 If they keep up this winning streak, they can make it to the playoffs,
 and maybe in Japan Series too…

Tsukasa:
What's she talking about?

Miyuki:
I think she's talking about professional baseball.
 Apparently she's a fan.
 And speaking of baseball, I seem to recall that the famous poet
 Shiki Masaoka was quite fond of it.
 In fact I heard he played on a team as catcher
 until tuberculosis forced him to stop.
 He loved the game so much he took his childhood nickname of Noboru
 and changed it to No-boru which means "no-ball".

Konata:
Anyway, you said Japan Series just now, and I realized something.
 In Major League Baseball, don’t they call the winning team World Champions?

Kuroi:
 Hm. Yeah, well, that’s something that only applies to North American teams.
 I mean if they wanna start talking "world anything", they should come over here
 and beat our team some time, you know! CHIBA ALL THE WORLD, BABY!


Konata:
 She is really into baseball, isn't she?


Kagami:
 It was totally stinky.

Miyuki:
 It was, wasn't it?

Konata:
Oh, hey, I was looking all over for you guys.

Kagami:
 Hey, Konata.

Konata:
 Can either of you show me how to do this problem?

Kagami:
 Hmm, I can't believe you're asking about your studies.
 Sure you don’t wanna just copy it?

Miyuki:
You know, looking at these problems, some of them look very difficult.

Kagami:
 Huh?

Konata:
Oh, yeah, that’s ‘cause they're for this quiz game I'm playing at the arcade.
 I’m not too good at figuring out basic academic questions.

Kagami:
Oh, boy, here we go again.
 Maybe you should try studying sometime.
 Entrance exams are right around the corner.

Konata:
Ha-ha-ha. This is the way I am when I’m at school.
 But at the arcade they call me a sage.

Kagami:
 Huh. Well, then, go and roll yourself on that whatever-Academy game of yours.

Konata:
 I wish I got more sleep last night.

Kagami:
Playing games all night, huh?

Konata:
 Hey, Miyuki-san, is it true that you always go to sleep by eleven?

Miyuki:
Yes.

Konata:
That's way too early.
Whoa! Oh, I get it.

Konata:
 That was what flashed in my head when I was looking at Miyuki-san.
 But you get lots of sleep and you’re still teeny-tiny.
Yutaka:
 Ohh!

Yutaka:
 Can you believe she said that to me?
 Like I needed that.


Yutaka:
 Hello, is this the Iwasaki residence?
 Sorry to call so late, my name is Yutaka Kobayakawa.
I'd like to speak with Minami-chan.
Oh, she’s in bed already?
 Does she always go to sleep this early?


Yutaka:
Pittan la la moji pittan...

Konata:
Okay, that sounds like a happy little song.





Kagami:
Oh, yeah, absolutely. No, it’s okay.
 Uh-huh, right, I’ll make sure my father knows about it.
 I’ll tell him right after the ground breaking ceremony, okay?
 Yes, right after. Oh, no, it’s nothing like that, really.
 Besides I’m not even old enough yet.
 So there's no way he'd let me.
 Well that's not how it is but thanks for saying so, haha.
 Okay, I’ll let my dad know, okay, bye.

Konata:
You’re funny.

Kagami:
 Hm?

Konata:
They can't see those gestures you’re making.

Kagami:
I know, I know, I can't help it. So what?

Konata:
 Whenever I'm on the phone, talking to someone, I have to stop playing my game,
 'cause I can't concentrate on the conversation.
 But then my other hand starts getting lonely, 'cause it’s got nothing to do.

Kagami:
 Yeah, I know what you mean.

Konata:
Anyway, I was on the phone the other day, cleaning the floor
 with one of those roller thingies that picks up lint and stuff.
 And I just kept rolling and rolling.

Kagami:
And isn't it weird how if you're doing something like that
 or if you're doodling, you just keep doing it over and over?

Konata:
 Yeah, I guess so. But the second you get off the phone,
 you lose your motivation to keep cleaning.
 And then you look around and you get all sad,
 'cause the floor’s only clean where you were sitting and rollering.

Kagami:
You could just keep rollering.

Konata:
My passion to keep cleaning ends withthe conversation.

Kagami:
 Then you just give up.



Kagami:
That guy's super stinky, isn’t he? It's fine once in a while, but...

Misao:
 Ha-ha, look! It's a po"cky", "po"cky. Get it?

Kagami:
Come on, we used to do that back in elementary school.
 Seriously that's a little kid thing you're doing there.
 Ah-huh, cute.
 Anyway, do you guys remember some of the stuff you used to do
 when you were young?
 Like when you'd stir up your yogurt, and yelled “bread factory”!

Ayano:
Bread factory?

Kagami:
Yeah, didn’t you?

Ayano:
 Uh-uh.

Kagami:
Uh...


Misao:
 Heh, so, yeah, bread factory, huh?
 Go on, say it, come on, don’t be shy.

Kagami:
Shut up, okay?


Kagami:
You know that game you borrowed a while ago?
 I need it back, 'cause someone else wants to play it now.

Misao:
 Is that someone "shorty Mc-blue hair"?

Kagami:
Yup!
 Actually I loaned a couple of games to her too.
 I should probably get those back.

Misao:
Here's something else, Hiiragi, you know that?

Kagami:
 What do you mean?

Misao:
 I think it’s cool you remember that stuff.
 The other day I found some games I borrowed from someone
 but now I can’t remember who it was.

Kagami:
 You’re kidding.

Misao:
 And there's a couple of games I loaned out
 but I can’t remember who's got 'em.

Kagami:
Sounds pretty careless.

Misao:
Nuh-uh! It’s a universal truth.
 In fact, they call it the law of forgetting the lender or something.
Kagami:
 You made that up.

Kagami:
 Huh? Hello, this is Kagami.

Misao:
Hey, Hiiragi, it's me, Misao.

Kagami:
Oh, hey, how's it going...

Misao:
Ahaa... Damn it. [I stacked / Nice job, Potemkin].


Kagami:
What the heck are you doing? Are you okay?

Misao:
Oh, yeah, I'm fine, no worry.

Kagami:
 So what’s up? Why did you call?

Misao:
 Oh, yeah...
 Why did I call you?

Kagami:
 How should I know?

Misao:
 It was something really important too.

Kagami:
Then don't forget it.


Sojiro
I just looked up the winning numbers for the autumn jumbo lottery
 but I didn't win.
 Guess getting a winning ticket’s pretty rare.

Konata:
I sent in a ton of postcards for something and I didn’t win anything either.

 Sojiro:
 I guess it sucks for both of us, huh.

Sojiro, Konata:
 Huh...


Konata:
But if it's this hard to win, maybe it’s because the people
 who run these lotteries and giveaways are cheating
 and don’t want anyone to win.

Sojiro:
It isn't nice to say things like that about people, Konata.


Tsukasa:
I can't do this.
 I should go to sleep.
 I'd better go to the bathroom first.
 They say I talk to myself too much, but that doesn’t matter at all.
 Oh! Why did saying a dumb joke like that wake me up?
 I was so sleepy before.

 Oh, I’m done.
 I don't have to use the bathroom, so I better hop into bed while I’m sleepy.
 Cold! I was so sleepy too.
 Why does my futon have to be so cold when I get in?
 It totally woke me up.

 Maybe 'cause it’s warm tonight, I'll get to sleep faster.
 Now my feet are hot and I can't get to sleep.
 Why? Why? Does this stuff only happen to me?

Kagami:
 Roasted sweet potatoes taste the best this time of year.

Konata:
Yeah, but you know, Kagamin.

Kagami:
 I already know what you're gonna say, so don't say it, all right?
 Here, you want some?

Konata:
Thanks, but no thanks.
 That stuff makes you fat.

Kagami:
And she says it anyway.
 Look! I couldn’t help it, okay?
 I, I made eye contact with the vender.
 I, I mean you can't just walk away without buying anything after that.
 He, he looked at me like I was gonna hurt his feelings
 if I didn’t buy something!

Konata:
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.
 At Comiket it’s hard to put the book down after eye contact.

Kagami:
 No one understands what you’re talking about
 and you don’t really care, do you?

Konata:
 What do you mean?
 That’s what it’s like when you are checking up the tables in the artist alley.
 If you pick up a book and the seller standing right in front of you,
 you feel bad about going to anther table without buying it.

Kagami:
But in the end you don’t buy it, do you?


Konata:
 They are turning a lot of light novels into anime lately, aren't they?

Kagami:
 Yeah, I noticed.
 The one I let you borrow the other day’s been turned into an amine three times so far.
 They are also gonna release a new volume soon.

Konata:
Yeah, I saw the anime version of it, but I still haven’t got around to the book yet.
 All those words kinda wear me out.

Kagami:
 Here we go again.
 Look, those games you play have way more words in them, don’t they?

Konata:
 Yeah, I guess so.
 But wouldn't it be really awesome if they released all those books as dating sims?
 Now that’s what I’m talking about.

Kagami:
 Hey!

Konata:
 Yeah, I know. Anyway I wonder when season four's gonna start.

Kagami:
Wait!

Konata:
What?

Kagami:
 Is that like product placement or something?

Konata:
 Hey, Yu-chan, you okay, over there? You need some help?

Yutaka:
 It’s this lid. Every time I try to close it, it ends up crooked.

Konata:
Oh, it's okay. It's no big deal.
 This kind of stuff happens to everybody.

Yutaka:
 But I keep doing it.

Konata:
Here you go.
 I think it's cute how you and Miyuki-san
 have a whole clumsy thing going on.

Yutaka:
You are so awesome, oneichan.
 Thanks a bunch for helping me out.
 Oh! No, what do I do? It won't open.

Konata:
Uh-oh, my bad. I'm always doing stuff like that.
 I guess I don't know my own strength.


Konata:
Is that bag givin' you trouble?
 Come on, hand it over.

Yutaka:
Thanks, oneichan, you are the best.

Konata:
Uh, hey, what the... Open! Rotten bag!

Yutaka:
Why don't you try tearing it from the jagged edge of the bag?

Konata:
Hang on. I'm gonna open this thing up proper or else!
 Um… Fire…

Yutaka:
 Hey, oneichan, maybe you should use a pair of scissors on it.

Konata:
No! If I use scissors, it’d be like I let the thing beat me or something.


Yutaka:
 Is that a mosquito?

Konata:
 Yup! Even if it hasn't launched a full-on attack, it pisses me off
 just knowing it's around here somewhere.
 But now that I know it’s here I'm gonna make sure it goes down hard.
 Look out! My hunter instincts're about to kick in!

Konata:
 Hey, Dad, wanna know what I was just thinking?

Sojiro:
Huh?

Konata:
If Yu-chan was asked out by a guy form her class and I was asked out
 by a guy from my class, does that mean those guys have Lolita complexes?

Sojiro:
Oh, boy. I guess that the guys are in the same grade as you,
 it's safe to say he doesn't have one.
 Then again both you girls look younger than you really are,
 so I guess there's that.
 Huh, if a girl's thirty years old, but she looks like she's in elementary school.
 If that's the case, you could say the guy prefers older women.
 That's a good question, hon.

 I don't know if there's an easy answer for it though.

Konata:
It's so cool I can ask you stuff like that.
 If I asked Kagami, she'd say something like "I don't care."

Konata:
 How about you, Dad? Are you like that?

Sojiro:
Huh?

Konata:
 Well, you loved Mom and she looked young.
 And I know you love having me for a daughter.
 Does that mean you have a Lolita complex?

Sojiro:
Whoa, whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa.
 That’s not exactly what your old man's about.
 "I also have a Lolita complex" is a better way of puttin' it.
 I mean, sure I like young girls but I also like normal girls.
 I don’t discriminate.

Konata:
 Either way, that's still pretty creepy, Dad.
 Look, you've always been super clingy with me.
 But I was wondering if I was a boy instead of a girl,
 would you still be all clingy with me?

Sojiro:
......, Yeah, sure, of course I would.

Konata:
 I totally get where you are coming from.
 I bet you're glad I turned out to be a girl.

Sojiro:
Um… Yeah, I guess.
 Hey, Yu-chan, I know you wanted to take a bath,
 so how about you go first, okay?

Yutaka:
 Thanks, I won't take long.

Konata:
"He's feeling weird about her hearing this."

Konata:
 Hey, Dad, you know what?

Sojiro:
 Huh?

Konata:
 I’ve been thinking about Mom.
 How she knew you all her life and how she was petit and stuff.
 She was kinda like a character in a dating sim.

Sojiro:
When she was a little kid, Kanata sure was a cutie pie.

Konata:
I know you were always head-over-heels in love with her.
 But I was wondering why did she wanna marry you?

Sojiro:
Well, I made her feel guilty.
 I told her it was her fault I turned into a dating-sim-loving maniac,
 'cause she always ignored me.

Konata:
 I’m being serious, Dad.

Sojiro:
 But it’s the truth.

Konata:
 You guilted her into marrying you?

Sojiro:
No, of course not. I'm kidding, honey, you know that.
 When you were born, your mom and me were the happiest people
 in the world.


Kanata:
 Her little mole looks just like yours.

Sojiro:
 Yeah, but she's got your eyes, Kanata.
 No doubt about it. She is our daughter.

Kanata:
 I'm worried though.
 I hope she doesn't grow up to be like either of us.
 I don’t want her to be short like me or a waiving geek like you.

Sojiro:
 Thanks a lot, honey.

Sojiro:
 What got you thinking about your mom all of a sudden?
Konata:
Well, I guess I just don't know all that much about her.
 That's all.

Sojiro:
 Konata, are you lonely, 'cause your mother's not around?

Konata:
 No, not really, I mean Yu-chan's here now and you can be such a spaz.

 It's almost like having two people around.

Sojiro:
 I guess.
 You see her, Kanata?
 She's turned out pretty good, hasn't she?
 She might not be as normal as you wanted. But she's a good girl.
 Hey, Konata.

Konata:
Huh?

Sojiro:
 You gotta promise me something, honeybunny.
 Don’t die before I do, okay?

Konata:
 Okay. I wasn’t really planning on it or anything.

Sojiro:
Thanks, kid.
 Kanata was really young when she passed away.
 She was laughing and talking about how happy she was right up to the end.
 I get sad sometimes thinking about her.
 But when my time comes I hope I go out like that.

Konata:
What're you talking about, Dad?
 You wanna die laughing?

Sojiro:
Hum, I wanna get moe to death.

Konata:
 Come on, be serious, Dad!
 You’re never gonna die a proper death!

Sojiro:
Ha-ha-ha, I'm kidding.
 Anyway I bought a new camera for work today.
 You wanna help me test it out?

Kanata:  Ah, it's been so long since I was here.

Konata:
No, Dad, stop!

Sojiro:
Oh, come on, just one more.

 Konata:
I'm in the middle of the game.

Kanata:
 I wonder what they're up to.
 Sounds like they are having fun.

Sojiro:
 Say cheese!

Konata:
 Dad, you said... um...

Sojiro:
 Ha-ha. Cool! Get ready for another.

Konata:
Come on, Dad, you got enough shots and you're hanging on all over me.

Sojiro:
 Oh, come on, honey, what's the big deal?
 I just wanna get a few pictures of us with my new camera.

Konata:
 I thought you said you got it for work.

Sojiro:
Oh, come on, don't be...
 Wait, one more shot.

Kanata:
 You're the same as always.
 You still like making people do everything you wanna do,
 even if they don't.

Konata:
But I don't want to.
 (?Stop xx)

Sojiro:
Why are you being so mean to me, Konata?

Konata:
Yah!

Kanata:
He hasn’t changed a bit, has he?

Sojiro:
You know something.
 Whenever I hug you, you feel just like how Kanata felt
 and I really like it.

Kanata, Konata:
 Ugh! You shouldn’t say creepy things like that. Ever!

Konata:
 Eh, I bet Mom had her hands full with you.

Sojiro:
What do you mean?

Kanata:
Yeah, sort of.
 But your dad's a good person, so listen to what he says, okay?

Sojiro:
Oh, you know that game you were playing the other day?
 After you figure it out, you think you could tell me how to finish it?

Konata:
 Sure. You got it.

Sojiro:
 That thing is way harder than I thought it was gonna be.

Kanata:
 It's nice to see that they play games together.
 I guess they're doing okay after all.

Sojiro:
But I can't get to the sex scene of this one character.

Kanata:
Whoa! What kind of games you're playing with our daughter anyway?
 Oh, boy, I hope she is okay.
 You'd better not be teaching her anything bad, So-kun.

Konata:
 Hey, why do you think Mom chose to marry YOU anyway?

Sojiro, Kanata:
Huh?

Konata:
I mean you're a pervy old geek with a Lolita complex.
 Why would anyone pick you?

Sojiro, Kanata:
I can't believe you said that.

Sojiro:
I think pervy old geek is a little bit harsh.

Kanata:
Super harsh.

Sojiro:
 Anyway let's get back to your mom. I don’t think I'm ..

Kanata:
 She is right, though.
 You were always like this.
 And sometimes I almost forget why you were the one...

Sojiro:
 ... I was a loser...

Kanata:
 ... I wanted to be with.

Sojiro:
There was one thing I was absolutely sure of.

Kanata:
 Huh?

Konata:
 Why did you stop? What was it? What were you so sure of?

Sojiro:
 Huh? Ha-ha-ha, um, I'm sure that no one else could ever love Kanata
 as much as I did.

Kanata:
 Oh, there it is. Yeah, that’s it. You can’t beat that.

 He accepts all the good in me along with all the bad.
 He shares everything with me. The good and the bad.
 I felt so safe and happy with you.
 It was the only place I ever felt so safe and happy.

Sojiro:
 Know what I mean? Ha-ha-ha.
 Since we're in such a good mood now, I think this calls for a picture.
 We should get Yu-chan down here for...

Konata;
(?But you’ve taken way more than one.)

Kanata:
 I feel kind of sad I can't be there with the two of you right now.

Sojiro:
Oh, yeah!

Konata:
Jeez, Dad, that camera's not for work, is it? Man!

Sojiro:
What? I'm just trying to get used to it.
 I don't wanna be figuring this out when I'm on assignment.

Konata:
Ever...

Kanata:
 But, you and Konata are always with me.
 And as long as the two of you keep me alive inside your hearts,
 we’ll always be together.

Sojiro:
Look, it's flashing. It's flashing. Come on, say cheese.

Kanata:
You gave me so much happiness.
 May your lives be blessed with this much joy as mine was.

Sojiro:
 Cheese!
Kanata:
 I wonder what they'll say.
Konata:
 Ugh, Dad, look it, this picture.

Sojiro:
 Huh? Ah!

Konata:
Whose shadow is that in the background?

Sojiro:
I think it’s a gh, ghost.

Kanata:
 Huh? Wh, what?

Yutaka:
 Okay, I'm all done with...

Konata, Sojoro:
Yu, Yu, Yu, Yu-chan!

Kanata:
 W, wait!

Konata:
 Look, look at this picture!

Yutaka:
 What's wrong? Ahaa!

Konata:
We gotta delete it. It’s cursed. Quick, delete it.

Kanata:
No, stop! Don’t delete it.

Sojiro:
No, deleting it won’t work.
 We have to burn it in a holy bonfire.

Kanata:
 Don't you dare burn that camera!

Hiyori:
After talking to her a bit more and stuff,
 I could see she’s not the person I thought she was.
 But Minamin is still pretty darn scary.

Yutaka:
She's not scary. She's sweet.
 Oh, look. There she is.

Yutaka:
Hi, Minami-chan.

Minami:
 Hi, Yutaka.

Yutaka:
 Are you in charge of the class log?

Minami:
 Yes.

Yutaka:
I think our teacher’s still in the lounge.

Hiyori:
Wow, those two sure are close.
 Yeah, close.

Minami:
"Yutaka, your tie is crooked."

Yutaka:
"O,oneisama!"

Hiyori
Aah! I'm fantasizing about my friends again.
Oh, god, I'm all pent-up.

Minami, Yutaka:
 Huh?

Director:
In three, two, one, we're live.

Producer:
 Well, where are they?
 What do you mean they are gone?
 Where the hell are they?
 Call their managers!
 Whatever, they're all getting fired.
 Never liked this stupid show anyway.

Director:
 Um, we're live.

Producer:
 I knew something like thiswould happen.

Director:
Hey!

Producer:
 You know, I turned this gig down. Yeah, turned it down.
 But I had to do it anyway.
 Politics, man. Gotta be grownup about it.

Director:
Hey, we are rolling!

Producer:
 Huh? What's rolling? Me? You? The earth? Na-ha-ha-ha.

Director:
No, we're rolling.
Producer:
 Huh?
Director:
The camera's rolling.
Producer:
 Holy crap! Cut, cut!


Kanata:
On the next episode of Lucky Star.

Sojiro:
Sojiro here.

Kanata:
 Kanata here.
 Well, So-kun, I'd better get going.

Sojiro:
You're leaving now?

Kanata:
Uh-huh.

Sojiro:
Take me with you.
 I know, I can't separate my sprit from my body.
 But I can learn.

Kanata:
So-kun, if you are going to talk about anime and manga,
 I'm leaving. Bye.

Sojiro:
No, Kanata!

Next time, "Delicate Line".

Kanata:
 So-kun, Ican't fly well in all this turbulence.

Sojiro:
 Oh, brother!
