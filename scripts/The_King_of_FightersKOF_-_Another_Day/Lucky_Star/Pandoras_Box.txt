Kagami:
 Hey, you.

Tsukasa:
 Good morning!

Kagami:
 Wow, you remembered to wear your winter uniform.

Konata:
 Yeah, who do you think I am, Tsukasa?

Tsukasa:
 Ah?!

Konata:


Tsukasa:
 Yeah!

Kagami:



Kagami:


Miyuki:
 Right, I've heard about that happening.

Kagami:
 Does your dad check upon you that way?

Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:
 So you went to Comiket after all.

Tsukasa:
 Comiket... Ah, ah...!

Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:


Tsukasa:
 Yeah, you're right, it is.

Miyuki:


Konata:


Kagami:
 Yeah, Tsukasa does the exact same thing but only because she's lazy.

Tsukasa:
 Ugh!

Konata:


Kagami:
 Wait! You mean you guys look like the kanji for river?

Konata:
 No, 'cause Dad always props himself down between us like this.

Kagami:


hemorrhage : 大金を浪費する、大量に出血する
be bound to : する運命になっている、しなければならない
Yui:


Yutaka:
 Oh, hey, oneichan.

Yui:
 Hello, what's your name?

Yutaka:

Yui:


Yutaka:
 Oneichan!

Minami:
 Knowing these two share the same DNA makes me a little... envious.

Yutaka:
 Hm?

Yui:


Yutaka:
 Want something to drink?

Yui:
 Yeah, beer!

Yutaka:
 But you can't! You drove over here.

Yui:


Minami:
 Of course, one sister absorbs the traits of the other. Absorbs...
Tsukasa:


Tsukasa:


Kagami:


Tsukasa:


Tsukasa:
 I'll wake up early tomorrow, and do my best!

Tsukasa:


Tsukasa:


Kagami:
 You have to want to wake up early.

Tsukasa:
 Maybe it's better if I just tried harder to stay up late and kept studying.

Kagami:


Miki:
 Okay, I'll make sure to wake you up tomorrow morning.

Tsukasa:
 This is totally gonna work and it's all thanks to my super smart Sis.

Tsukasa:
 Mom! You were supposed to wake me up!

Miki:


Tsukasa:
 Wait, [I/you] did?

Kagami:
 Hmm...

Miki:
 Don't you remember?

Tsukasa:
 Oh...

Kagami:
 Huh...

Yutaka:
 Huh? Oh, no, Konata forgot to take her lunch.

Konata:
 Uh, thank you!

Yutaka:


Konata:


Yutaka:
 Huh?

Konata:
Yutaka:


Konata:


Yutaka:


Konata:

Tsukasa:
 
Patricia:
 Oh, hey, guys, what's up?

Konata:
 Are you heading off to work right now?

Patricia:


Konata:
 Mm-hm.

Kagami:
 Are you guys still working together at the cafe?

Konata:
 Yeah. Believe it or not, we're starting to get pretty popular.

Patricia:
 Yeah, the A-boys get all moe-moe for us!

Kagami:
 What the heck's an A-Boy?

Patricia:


Konata:
 That girl has definitely gotten used to Japan.

Kagami:

Hiyori:


Hiyori:


Hiyori:


Hiyori:


Hiyori:


Kuroi:


Konata:
 But isn't the bus gonna be stopping at all the cool places anyway?

Kuroi:


Konata:
 And there goes my comeback.


Konata:
 Oh... Iris crashed here...

Tsukasa:
 Hm?

Guide:
About 1300 years ago, Nara was the capital of Japan.
But then in the year 710, the capital was relocated to Heijou-kyo.
So please sit back, relax and enjoy the ride as I nar(a)-row down
Nara's history for you.

Shiraishi:


Konata:
 Is that supposed to be funny?


Kagami:
 Thanks for waiting!

Konata:


Kagami:
 You ever hear of divine punishment?

Tsukasa:


Miyuki:
Oh...

Tsukasa:


Konata:
 Come on, girl, cookie!

Kagami:
 You, keep it up, shorty!


Indian:
Please do snap snap, okay?

Tsukasa:
 What?

Konata:
 I bet he wants you to take a picture of him and his buddies.

Tsukasa:


Konata:
 Here's what you find out just how good a person studies.

Kagami:
 Yeah, look who's talking.

Indians:
Aha!

Tsukasa:


Kagami:


Konata:
 Uh-huh, we are not so smart after all, are we?

Miyuki:
 Isn't English understood by the majority of the population in India?

Kagami:


Tsukasa:


Kagami:


Konata:
 That's probably why these things are so popular with everyone.

Miyuki:


Kagami:
 They think it's now or never.

Miyuki:


Tsukasa:


Konata:

Guide:
Okay, everyone, we'll be arriving at Kiyomizu Temple any minute now.
Here's something you might find interesting, the hill leading up to the temple
is called "Sannen-zaka", and if you trip and fall here,
it's said you'll die in three years' time.
The Sannen-zaka becomes the Zannen-zaka, get it?

Shiraishi:
 Hahaha!

Konata:
 What if he'll die laughing?

Kuroi:



Kagami:
 I don't think we should.

Konata:


Everybody:
Wow...

Tsukasa:
 It's so high up!

Kagami:


Konata:
 Kagamin, you're way too realistic!

Tsukasa:
 Oh look, it's a god of romance.

Miyuki:
 Apparently, this spot is famous for bringing lovers together.

Konata:
 Yeah, I can see why.

Tsukasa:


Konata:
 Yeah, come on, let's do it!

Konata:


Kagami:
 I think they do that on purpose.

Konata:


Tsukasa:


Miyuki:
 Oh, mine just says fortunate.

Kagami:


Tsukasa:
 Well, maybe it means that you're half-blessed.

Konata:
 Or, maybe it means you're half cursed.

Kagami:
 Nobody takes these love fortunes seriously anyway.
Tsukasa:
 Oh, how cute!

Kagami:
 Oh, you picked a good one.

Konata:
 I don't know, Kagami, that's more your style.

Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:
 I'm not buying that!

Konata:
 How about this flavor?

Kagami:
 No!


Kagami:
 Watch out! You're gonna trip!

Konata:
 Hm, this one says "Konata's my wife."


Kuroi:


Konata:


Kuroi:
 W-What?!

Shiraishi:
 This is just like what happened to me in Hokkaido.

Konata:
 Hey, say "M___tel" for me!

Kuroi:


Kagami:


Boy:
Yeah, you're right. Hurry on!

Konata:
 How come Kinkaku Temple is gold, but Ginkaku Temple isn't silver?

Miyuki:


Konata:


Miyuki:
 Nice shot!


Tsukasa:
 I forgot tell you our shrine was in the news.

Miyuki:
 Can you believe we only have one day left?

Tsukasa:
 And it's our day off, so we're gonna have lots of fun!

Konata:


Kagami:
 Yeah...

Konata:
 Huh?


Kagami:


Boy:
I-I hope you weren't waiting too long.

Kagami:
 So, what did you wanna talk to me about?

Boy:
Well, I-I don't know how to say this, but I...

Kagami:
 Um.....

Boy:
I was wondering if I could have that doll!

Kagami:
 You want a doll?

Boy:
Yeah, you know, it's the one that you bought back at that shop
in Kiyomizu Temple.
The little Yatsuhashi doll.

Kagami:
 Yatsuhashi-kun...

Boy:
Right, that's him!
I'd love that little guy!
And I really want one but..., but I was afraid what the guys would say
if they saw me buy it so...
Could I have yours?!
Please!

Kagami:
 Oh, sure...

Boy:
Thanks a lot, Hiiragi!
I owe you one, man!
Aha!
Don't tell anyone about this, 'kay?
Later!

Kagami:
 Uh...


Tsukasa:


Miyuki:


Tsukasa:


Konata:
 Uh-huh, she's showing up again.

Konata:
 I figured out the directions to get there.

Tsukasa:
 And you're sure it's okay to go?

Konata:
 Oh, yeah, besides, we're just looking at the building from the street.

Kagami:
 I don't see why we have to go to all this trouble just 'cause we're in Kyoto.

Konata:


Kagami:
 And I don't ever wanna get it.

Kagami:
 There's nothing even here.

Konata:
 That's a good thing 'cause they need to concentrate on their work.

Kagami:
 Their building looks pretty normal.

Konata:
 It's perfect 'cause they keep their focus on a small number of titles.

Kagami:
 Did you have to come all the way to Kyoto to buy that stuff?

Kagami:

Konata:
 Come on, it'll be an awesome memory of today!

Tsukasa:
 Yeah, Sis, I want a picture with you.

Miyuki:


Konata:
 This is cool 'cause we got it in Kyoto.

Kagami:
 There's nothing Kyoto about it.


Kagami:


Konata:
 I thought you'd be in bed too, you know sulking or something.

Kagami:
Konata:
Kagami:
 No, it's totally embarrassing.

Kagami:
