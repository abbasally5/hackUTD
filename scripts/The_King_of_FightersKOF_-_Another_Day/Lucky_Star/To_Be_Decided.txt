  Tsukasa:
The arts festival's here.
 Can you guys believe it's that time again?
 
Konata:
Time for exams, too.


Kagami:
like that?


Patricia:
 That sign says Opening Ceremony.
 Do you guys know what that's about?

Minami:
 It's a tradition for this school's Outou Festival.


Patricia:
Aha! I just had an awesome idea.


Minoru:
All right.
I guess it's unanimous.
We'll have a room where people can get their fortunes told.
So before next homeroom everyone needs to decide
what type of fortunes they wanna tell.

Konata:
Patricia:

 
Minami:
 For what?

Patricia:



Hiyori:
Yeah, it's over-the-top, but it's kinda cool.

Patricia:
I know.
 And everyone here's gonna love the show we put on.

Hiyori:
 When you said, "we", wait... Ah! 
 Don't tell me you've already signed us up for it.

Patricia:

 
Minami, Hiyori:
Ugh!

Patricia:
Huh? Oh.
 Er, oh, so how about it, Yutaka?

Yutaka:
Oh, I, uh...
 
Hiyori:
But, Yu-chan, wouldn't it be a little too physical for you?

Yutaka:
Maybe, or maybe not.
If it isn't any trouble, I think I'd like to try it, I think.

Patricia:
It's no trouble.
 None of us could imagine doing it without you.
 So welcome to the team.

Hiyori:
 Are you sure about this?

Yutaka:
It sounds like it’s gonna be a lot of work and stuff.
 And I don't wanna slow anyone down or anything.
 But I think it could be a really good challenge for me.
 
Patricia:
 Yay!

 So how about it, guys? You in?
 
Minami:
Okay, then count me in.

Hiyori:
Yeah, I guess if you are all gonna do it.

Patricia:
 You guys are the best. You are awesome.




Kagami:
 Really? Fortune-telling?
 Here's a question. Do you even know how to tell a fortune?

Konata:
 Uh-uh. Not at all.

Tsukasa:

 
Kagami:
Jeez, wasn't it your idea?

Konata:
.

Tsukasa:


Kagami:
Well, we're sorta doing the typical haunted house thing.
 
Tsukasa:
 Cool.

Konata:
 Hmm.How typical.

Kagami:
 Well, no one in class came up with anything better, so...
 Ugh, yeah, what?

Konata:
Oh, nothing.
 Sounds perfect if you ask me.
 
Kagami:
 What's that supposed to mean?

Konata:
 Whoa, don't get the monster angry.

Kagami:
 I totally knew you would say that.
 

Yutaka:
 Patty-chan told us she wanted to do a cheerleading routine.
 
Konata:
 Yeah?

Yutaka:
And then I thought it might be fun, if I tried helping out, too.

Konata:
 Yeah? Ugh, wait. Why now?

Yutaka:

 But lately I've been feeling a lot better.

 So maybe it’s a sign I should do it or something.

Konata:
Humm, I don't know, it sounds like it could be tough for you.

Yutaka:
 I know it does. So Patty-chan was wondering if you’d help out.
 If you were there, I know I'd feel better.
 Please, please, please.

Konata:
I don't know about this.

Yutaka:
But you're really athletic and everything.


Konata:
 You really want me there and Patty's asking too.
 Oh, I gotta think about this. Hmm... Hm?

Konata:
 Izumi residence.

Patricia:
Good evening, Konata.

Konata:


Patricia:
 Pan pan pan pan!
 Time for a little quiz.
 Right now, I'm holding in my hand a certain ticket to something.
 Can you tell me what upcoming event this ticket’s for?

Konata:
 Hmm? Ugh! Wait, you're kidding!

Patricia:
Oh, Konata, I heard you loved her last concert.
 Don't you wanna shake Haruhi's hand? I know you do.
 
Konata:
Yes, I wanna shake her hand!
 I do, I do, I do, I wanna go, I wanna see Aya!!!

Patricia:
Well, what were you gonna say before I interrupted you?

Konata:

 Let's go have some fun!
Yutaka:
 Oh, okay.



Konata:
So anyway, if you aren't a cheerleader, then you're not cool.
 
Kagami:
 What are you talking about?

Konata:

 
Kagami:
 Oh, yeah, I can totally see her doing that.

Konata:
I know, and it’s been decided you and Tsukasa are doing it, too.

 
Kagami:
Whoa, hang on a sec.
 Could you at least give us a minute to think about it?

Tsukasa:
Idon't even think I can do anything like that.
 
Konata:
What? Come on, you'll never get another chance to do this.
 It’s a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

 I mean the more the merrier, right?

Tsukasa:
 Yeah, I guess.

Kagami:
Ugh!

Tsukasa:
Yeah, count me in.

Kagami:
Huh. You’re a total pushover, you know that?
 Sorry, but I can't.
 I got a ton of stuff to do for my class.

Konata:


Kagami:

 
Konata:
 Yu-chan even volunteered and she’s really excited about it.

Kagami:
 She did? Is she gonna be okay up there?

Konata:
I tried to get her to change her mind but I couldn't talk her out of it.


Kagami:
Oh, really?
 
Konata:
 Really, but they're having a hard time finding people to help out.
 That's why they came to us to see if we wanted to do it.

 That was totally unfair and Idon't blame you for not willing to help us.
 
Kagami:
 I’ll do it.

Konata:
 Huh? Wait, you what?

Kagami:
 I'll do it. I said, "I'll do it", okay?

Tsukasa:
Really, Sis?

Konata:
Really? You will?

Kagami:

 It's not like I had a choice.

Konata:
 "Kagami's so cute when she acts like that.”


Miyuki:
 Ch, cheerleading?
 I honestly don't think I'd be very good at it.

Konata:

 "Especially in the volume department."


Miyuki:
You really think so? Oh, all right.
 If you think I can help, I'd love to give it a shot.
Konata:
 Oh, awesome! You're the breas..., uh, thank you.

Nanako:
 And there's no slacking off,or else...
Konata:

 
Kagami:
 Hey, what's up?

Konata:
 Huh?

Kagami:
 What's happening with the cheerleading?
 'Cause I haven't heard anything yet.

Miyuki:
 Does anyone even know?
 
Konata:

Patricia:

Konata:
... before exams started.
 But, I haven't heard anything since.
 
Kagami:
 Ugh! Well, that figures!

 Do we even have time to practice?
 
Konata:
 I don't know. Ask her.
 
Patricia:
Sorry. I haven't had a chance to figure out the choreography yet.
 
Kagami:
 You gotta be kidding me.
 What are we gonna do?

Patricia:
No wait! It took longer than I thoughtI would to find the right song.
 It didn't help that I was looking for something with a Hare Hare feel.
 
Kagami:
Yeah, whatever. Huh.

 This cheerleader thing was your idea.
 So it's your responsibility to organize it.
 
Patricia:
 I can't hear you, la-la-la-la-lala.

Kagami:
 Don't play that game with me!
 Suck it up and get to work!
 If we're gonna do this thing, we need to get organized right now!

 Youbetter have some of the movesfigured out by then!
 Don't worry about the rough spots, we'll fix those in rehearsal!
 And next time you need help, ask somebody!!

Konata:
 Er, yeah, so, Kagamin.

Kagami:
 What?!

Konata:
 A little while ago, you didn't sound like you wanted to help out.
 So how come you're all gung-ho about it now?

Kagami:
 Ugh. Shut up!


Konata:
What's your thing gonna be, Miyuki-san?

Miyuki:
 I'm going to tell fortunes with tarot cards.

Konata:
 And what's yours?

Tsukasa:
Um, I haven't decided what I'm doing yet.

 
Miyuki:
Let me see, perhaps you could give shape-readings to people?

Tsukasa:
Uh, uh... uh...
 
Kagami:
Tsukasa, you don't know what you are talking about, do you?

Tsukasa:
 What, what the heck!


Kagami:
 You, you're kidding me. We're supposed to learn how to do that?

Patricia:
 Don't you think it's cool?

Miyuki:
 It's not that we don't like it.

Minami:
But it looks very difficult.

Misao:

 
Konata:
We are so gonna die.

Patricia:


Kagami:
 Put a sock in it!


Ayano:
Uh-oh, we've run out of masking tape.
 
Misao:
I needed a break anyway.
 Come on, we'll go buy some more.

Boy A:
If you're going, we need some markers.

Girl A:
And more blades for the cutter.

Boy B:
And boxes.

Boy C:
Play boy.

Girl B:
Glue.

Misao:
Aha, okay, somebody threw something weird in there.
 Why's everybody messing around?!
 If we ran out of supplies, get off your ass and go get some!

Boy D:
Do you guys know what the yakisoba's supposed to be called?

Girl C:
We're callingthat one “Spring's Fragrant Breath”.

Boy E:
What's this thing we're calling “The Fallen Drop of Sun's Dew”?

Girl C:
Oh, that's okonomi-yaki.

Boy D:
This menu's totallyinsane, man.
How's anyonegonna know what they're ordering?

Patricia:
 Hum, Japanese culture is so interesting.

Minami:



Konata:
 Yoo-hoo!
 So, what are you guys gonna do for the arts festival?

Yutaka:
 Er, it's called a Zuka café.

Konata:
 Ah! ugh. A what?

Hiyori:



Minami:
 Cross-dressing?
 
Hiyori:
 Wa! It's perfect.
 Yu-chan and Minami-chan are gonna be our most popular servers.
 It's a kaleidoscope of beauty.

Minami:
 Who decided we'd be doing this?
 
Yutaka:
Now I'm scared. I can do the cheerleading, but this?
 

Konata, Hiyori:
Whoa!

Konata:
Those guys are amazing, aren't they?

Hiyori:
Yeah, I know. They are totally in synch with each other.
 
Konata:
So tell me something.


Hiyori:
Yeah, good point.

 Let's watch.

Konata:
 Sure, what the heck, right?
 
Kagami:


Hiyori:
 The cheerleading outfits are here!
 
Girls:
Wow!

Miyuki:
They turned out wonderfully, but I don't think I can wear it.
 
Konata:

 
Hiyori:
You know it.
 The outfit was chosen by a hardcore fan of all things cheerleadery.

Konata:
 Right, I heard stories about him. 
 Your big brother sounds like a cool guy.
 
Hiyori:
 Then, the Zuka costumes are gonna drive you crazy.
 

Yui:
 I heard you guys are gonna be doing a cheerleader routine.

Soujiro:


Konata:
As long as you promise to behave yourself.
 
Soujiro:
 Ugh! I'll behave myself.
 
Konata:
Well, we haven't got the moves down yet.
 So I doubt if we're gonna be able to pull this off.

Yui:
 Don't worry guys!
 I'll give you a dose of Yui-power and you'll be great!
 
Konata:

 

Kagami:

 
Inori:
Arts festival, huh?
I can't even remember what my class did for the one we had.

Tadao:
You know, our class did something like that too.
I think it's what you guys call a manga café.

Miki:
Right, I remember.
All the boys in class brought their manga in that day.

Matsuri:
You guys were way ahead of your time.

Tadao:
These days you can bring that stuff to school and it's no big deal.
But they had strict rules aboutit when I was a kid.
Festivals were the only time we could have them.

Kagami:

 

Yukari:
 Oh, are you really going to tell fortunes?

 
Miyuki:
 Well, that really isn't fortune telling.
 Oh, I've been meaning to ask.
 What did you do for your school's arts festival?

Yukari:
Uh, I think I remember every class and club
doing their own separate projects.
But, you know, in the end they were all rather typical things
like haunted houses and placesthat serve okonomi-yaki.

Miyuki:

 For example, did you have an exhibit that focused on something cultural? 
 Like "the history and craft of paulownia wardrobe making"?
 
Yukari:
Seriously? Oh, honey, that sounds like it wouldn't be any fun at all.

Miyuki:


Kagami:
Okay, guys, let's take a break.
 
Patricia:
 We're gonna be so amazing.
 I can't wait to see everyone's faces.

Kagami:
We still have a lot of work to do before we are ready.


Misao:

 
Kagami:


Konata, Misao:
Awww!

Kagami:


Hinata:
 Oh, no, really?
 Sorry about that, I didn't know.
 
Teacher:
No worries.

Hinata:
 He said today is the rehearsal day for the students only.
 I guess they are still getting things ready.

Hikage:
And?

Hinata:

 
Hikage:

 
Hinata:
 I know you did, but I heard that Akira-chan was going to be here today.
 I'm sorry.
 
Hikage:
Oh, jeez, what a total waste of train fare.



Konata:

 
Kagami:
Very funny.
 What's with that outfit?
 You're really gonna walk around like that?

Konata:
 I'm walking out for our fortune-telling thing.
 
Tsukasa:
Well, I think Kona-chan's costume is really cute.
 
Konata:
It's important to have the right outfit.
 I'm gonna tell a bunch of fortunes today.
 "You will buy soft-serve ice-cream 5 minutes and 15 seconds from now.
 You will drop it 5 minutes and 28 seconds from now.
 You will hit your head on a sign 7 minutes and 6 seconds from now."

Miyuki:
You're telling fortunes, not predicting the future.

Kagami:
 Cut it out!

Hiyori:

 It was cutting it close, but they got finished just in time.


Tsukasa:
 That's so cute.
 
Miyuki:
Those costumes are wonderful.

Yutaka:
It's a little embarrassing walking around school in this outfit.

Kagami:
 Yeah, I can see why.

Yutaka, Minami:
Ugh!

Kagami:
 I mean, you guys are super cute.

Hiyori:
Senpai, it's almost time for Akira Kogami's show to start.
 
Konata:


Akira:
My name is Akira Kogami.
 It's great to meet you, ma'am.
 I'm gonna do the best I can to entertain everyone today.
 
Hikaru:
Yeah, good, I'm Sakuraba.

 Thanks, oh, and "break a leg".
 Introduce yourself, Shiraishi.

Minoru:
Oh, sure, I'm Shiraishi, chairman of the arts festival committee.
It's a pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

Hikaru:
He's gonna take it from here.
 If you need anything, ask him, okay? Great, see you.

Akira:


Akira:
You're gonna say something, or you're just gonna stand there?

Minoru:
Huh? Shouldn't you be at the monster's meeting?

Akira:
 What the...!

Hikaru:
Is there a problem here?

Akira:
 No, everything's just great.

Akira, Minoru:
Hm!

Minoru:
You're an important guest for the school, Akira-sama.
And I'm gonna make damn sure you're treated like one.

Akira:
 Now what?
Minoru:
If you're gonna sing 'Misoji Misaki" in the Lucky Channel
segment tomorrow, you'll need to do a mike check.
And after the show tomorrow, you're doing some kind of panel.
Akira:
Great, that sounds like a piece of cake.

Minoru:
Then, please head on over to the stage, thank you.

Akira:
Yeah, right, you, son of a...

Akira:
 Nice sign.
 Hiya, luckies!
 I wanna thank everyone for coming out today to see little oldme.
 Are you guys ready to have bunches of fun today? I know you are!

Minoru:
When will she get to feel the arms of the man she loves caressing her?
She wanders the land alone now.
His last words, her only companion.
Searching for the things she can never find.
Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Akira Kogami,
with her version of "Misoji Misaki".

Akira:
Hitori...

Minoru:
Okay, cut it!

Akira:
Let me finish singing, damn it!
 
Minoru:
It's only a mike check! Besides we are out of time!

Akira:
 Who cares!?

Minoru:
I can't hear you, la-la-la-lala..

Akira:
 ... freaking ass, you stupid wannabe!

Kagami:
Okay, guys, you ready?
 This is our last rehearsal.
 So let's get it right.

Patricia:



 
[Cheerleading rehearsal]
Girls:
All right!


Nanako:
 What's up, you guys?
 Why are you all still hanging around here?

Miyuki:
We were practicing our cheerleading routine.

Nanako:
Oh, is it coming along okay?
 Guess it's gonna be awesome then.

Konata:
 How about you buy us a round, ma'am?
 
Nanako:
Huh? Okay, sure.


Konata:
 Yes! You're the best.
 
Miyuki:
You really don't mind?

Nanako:
Of course, I don't.
 It's my treat, 'cause today is the special day for you.
 But I want you to get that crowd pumped up for the festival.
 You all got that?

Girls:
Yeah!


Konata:
What's wrong, Tsukasa?

Tsukasa:
Huh? Nothing is wrong.
 It's just.... Well, doesn't everything feel sort of weird right now?

Miyuki:
Yes it does, doesn't it? I'm beginning to feel a little sad myself.


Misao:
 I guess tomorrow's gonna be the real deal,huh, guys.

Ayano:
 Yeah, it is.
 This is the last time we'll get to stay here late, working on projects together.

Kagami:
 Kind of makes you feel sad, if you start thinking about it that way, doesn't it?

Yutaka:
Ta,Tamura-san, you don't look so good.
Hiyori:
It's nothing, just a little... nauseous.

Konata:
 Tsukasa, relax, you're all stiff.
 
Kagami:

 
Patricia:

 
Ayano:
 Oh, I don't think I'm so nervous right now. I'm frozen.

Minoru:
Check, check.
Okay, folks, the Outo Festival is about to start.
The opening act is something our exchange student,
Patricia-san, came up with.
It's a cheerleading routine by her and friends.
So put your hands together and...

Ringtone:
Min-Min-Miracle, Mino-run-run...

Minoru:
Could the person with the cell-phone...,
Whoa, it's mine! St, stop xxx

Girls:
A-ha-ha-ha...!

Patricia:
I knew something was gonna go wrong!

Yutaka:
If I came something like this, I'm gonna pass out!

Tsukasa:
That was perfect timing!

Misao:
 Time to get a better ringtone!

Miyuki:
 Ah, I feel so bad for him.

Kagami:
Well, I guess I shouldn't be surprised this happened to us.
 
Konata:
 I know, that was totally random, wasn't it?

Minoru:
...and for my next trick...
Sorry about that, folks.
What? Yeah, here we go, let's try it again.
Here's Patty and her friends, and their performance of,
"Motteke! Sailor Fuku"!
