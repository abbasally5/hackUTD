Kagami:
 But our finals come right before that.

Konata:

Kagami:


Konata:
 The other day, I took a trip to Asakusa.

Kagami:
 Yeah, when did you go out there?

Konata:
 Well, don't you guys get sleepy riding in the train in winter?

Kagami, Tsukasa:

Tsukasa:
 Um... Wait... Isn't that in the opposite direction?

Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:
 You shouldn't be taking little vacations during exams.

Konata:


Kagami:

Konata:
 Besides, they say the kids who sleep a lot grow more.

Kagami:
 Yeah, right, surely.

Konata:


Tsukasa:
 Wow.

Konata:

Kagami:


Tsukasa:


Konata:


Kagami:

Konata:
 It's the one that gauges your candy intake.

Kagami:
 Shut up!

Tsukasa:


Konata:


Kagami:

Tsukasa:

Kagami:
 I tried waking her up on the ride home the other day...

Kagami:
 Hey, come on, wake up, we're here!

Tsukasa:
 Yeah, give me five minutes... Just five more...

Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:

Tsukasa:
 Eh! No, I'm not!

Konata:
 Why do we ask for five more minutes?

Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:
 Yeah, I guess.

Konata:


Tsukasa:
 Yeah, you're right.

Kagami:


Konata:

Tsukasa:


Kagami:
 Or when it's some old person with the sticky face leaning on you, huh?

Konata:
 Sometimes, I'm all leaned that way,

Kagami:
 I know, I know, isn't that weird?

Tsukasa:


Konata:
 Maybe everyone's got a particular side they like leaning on or something.

Miyuki:


Konata:

Miyuki:
 What? You mean they're not?

Konata:
 See ya!

Tsukasa, Kagami:
 Bye-nee!

Miyuki:
 Good-bye.

Konata:

Tsukasa:
 Yeah.

Konata:


Tsukasa:
 That sounds just like Yuki-chan.

Miyuki:
 No, it's not like that.

Konata:
 All right, young ladies, I'd better bust a move back to shanty town!

Konata:

Kagami:

Konata:
 Yo!

Kagami:
 Oh, for some reason, I couldn't study at all last night.

Konata:


Miyuki:

Konata:
 A whole four hours!

Kagami:
 Only four hours.

Konata, Kagami:
 What the...

Konata:
 Kagami, you do everything perfect, you know that?

Kagami:


Konata:

Kagami:


Konata:
 But, does it even matter with Tsukasa? I mean where is the challenge?

Kagami:
 Um, well yeah, I guess there isn't any.

Tsukasa:
 Damn you, Kona-chan!
Tsukasa:
 Christmas is almost here.

Konata:
 I wonder what kind of present I'm gonna get this year.

Tsukasa:


Konata:
 Huh? You mean there's no such thing as Santa Claus?

Tsukasa:
 For real?

Tsukasa:


Kagami:

Misao:

Kagami:
 Oh, hey.

Boy:
Hiiragi-san, I have yesterday's printout.

Kagami:
 Oh, yeah, sure.

Ayano:
 It's like that, Hiiragi-chan.

Kagami:
 Hahaha...

Boy:
Wait, Hiiragi, you dropped your pencil.

Kagami:
 Oh, thanks a lot.

Konata:
 Hiya, Kagami!

Kagami:
 Oh, hey.

Miyuki:
 Kagami-san, here's yesterday's printout.

Kagami:
 Oh, yeah, sure.

Tsukasa:
 Sebastian's stinky, isn't it?

Kagami:
 Hahaha...

Shiraishi:
 Hey, Kagami, you dropped your handkerchief.

Kagami:
 Jeez, I guess I hang out in Tsukasa's class more than I thought.

Tsukasa:
 You know, my cavity's been hurting a lot lately.

Miyuki:

Tsukasa:


Miyuki:


Tsukasa:
 She's all cute when she says it, but that's totally nuts!

Kagami:

Konata:
 Oh, sorry , but I've already got plans for Christmas.

Kagami:
 Really, do these plans involve a guy?

Konata:
 Well, you could say that.

Kagami:


Konata:
 Hm, good try, but I did tell him that I'd be coming home late that night.

Kagami:


Konata:
 Sorry to burst your bubble, girls, but I got a part-time job, remember?

Kagami:
 Phew...

Konata:
Kagami:

Tsukasa:
 Yeah, so did I!

Konata:

Kagami:
 You really do like that kind of stuff, don't ya?

Konata:


Kagami:
 Do not call it cosplay.

Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:
 Huh?

Kagami:

Konata:

Konata:
 Come to think of it, are you guys even allowed to celebrate Christmas?

Tsukasa:

Kagami:


Tsukasa, Kagami:

Konata:
 Wow, you guys are so well rounded.

Kagami:

Konata:
 Whoa, hang on, sounds like it's gonna get complicated.

Yui:

Konata:

Yui:
 What're you watching, huh?

Konata:
 Just one of those detective drama shows.

Yui:

Konata:


Detective1:
That's it, I got it! That guy did it!

Detective2:
One moment please, detective!
Don't you think there's something strange about this case?

Detective1:
Of course not! This solves it! Who are you, anyway?
This ain't your business!

Yui:
 Oh, brother, that's the perfect example of why the cops are such morons.

Konata:
 But, aren't you one of those cops?

Konata:

Yui:
 How do you know that?

Konata:
 Look!

Detective:
So, I guess you are the one who did it.

Culprit:
Yeah, whatever, I give up.

Yui:
?

Konata:



Yui:
 Yu-hoo! Hey, how's it going?

Konata:

Yui:
 So, what are you watching tonight?

Konata:

Detective:
The case isn't here in the boardroom!
It's out there, at the crime scene!

Yui:

Konata:
 You sound pretty passionate.

Yui:

Konata:
 You're talking about the show, right?

Sojiro:


Yui:
 Of course not. Everyone knows most of that stuff's made-up.

Sojiro:


Yui:


Sojiro:


Konata:

Kagami:

Miyuki:
 It's so horrible.

Konata:


Kagami:

Konata:

Kagami:


Konata:
 Aw, that's not very nice!

Konata:

Kagami:
 Cool!

Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:
Tsukasa:

Konata:

Kagami:
 Of course.

Tsukasa:
 You should come and pick your fortune!

Konata:


Tsukasa:
 That's why they say that "Middle blessings" are the best to get.

Kuroi:
Tsukasa:
 How'd you do, Kona-chan?

Konata:

Kuroi:

Tsukasa:

Miyuki:

Konata:
 I wonder what happens to all the leftover cakes after Christmas ends.

Miyuki:

Tsukasa:
 If nobody wants to take them home, then they'll throw out the extra cake.

Konata:


Tsukasa:
 Like it's over after 25?

Konata:


Tsukasa:


Miyuki:


Konata, Tsukasa:
 Huh!

Konata:
 Oh...

Miyuki:
 Uh...

Konata:


Konata:
 Whoa...

Tsukasa:

Konata:

Tsukasa:


Konata:



Konata:


Konata:
 Not yet?

Konata:
 Oh, it feels like an eternity. This is the longest three minutes ever.

Konata:
 I'll pass the time by reading my manga.

Konata:
 And then your noodles end up all soggy and everything, you know?

Tsukasa:

Kagami:
 Give me a break.
Sojiro:


Konata:
 I'm home!

Sojiro:


Konata:


Sojiro:


Konata:
 Yeah! You know it!

Sojiro:
 I'm so happy, I think I could die now.


Yui:


Sojiro, Konata:
 Urgh!

Konata:
 You totally reek. You didn't drive, did you?

Yui:

Konata:

Kiyotaka:
Yui? Oh, hey, it's me.
I was gonna surprise you tonight, but, yeah, door's locked.
Are you with your parents?

Yui:

Konata:
 Don't go breaking any laws in your condition there, tiger

Sojiro:


Konata:

Konata:
 Hey, Teach's on line.

Konata:

Cashier:
Just a minute please.

Kuroi:



Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:
 Uh-uh, I don't use any of them.

Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:
 A-okay..., if that's how you feel about it.
Kagami:
 Oh!

Tsukasa:
 Oh!

Miyuki:
 Oh!

Kagami:
 No!

Konata:
 Yes.

Tsukasa:

Konata:
 Uh-uh.

Tsukasa:
 Why didn't you?

Kagami:

Miyuki:

Kagami:

Tsukasa, Kagami:
 Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

Konata:
 Maybe these guys don't like each other after all, for real.

Sojiro:
 Argh! Hmm...

Konata:
 What the heck are you doing?

Sojiro:
 I just wanted to try it again!

Sojiro:
 Whoa! Stronger!
Akira:
Hiya, luckies.
 I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami.
 It's already the 11th episode, guys.
 Can you believe it?

 Now then, in the next episode, I, Akira Kogami...

Minoru:
Yeah, um…
She is ignoring me as she goes on.
Hi, guys I’m Minoru Shiraishi, the assistant of Aki…Au!
I need to introduce myself.

Akira:
Shut the hell up!
 I'm going to make an appearance in the show!

 Oh! And everyone else, thank you, thank you.

Minoru:
Whoa, you got cast too, Akira-sama?

Akira:
Hum? Yeah, what's with the attitude l
 What’s up with that?

Minoru:
No, that’s not it.
I swear I’m totally honored that I'll be acting in the show with you,
Akira-sama.
Believe me.

Akira:

 Oh, how you dream about making it in the industry,
 but you're totally expendable and you could disappear like that.
 Keep that in mind, and maybe you'll stick around a bit longer.

Minoru:
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

Akira:


Minoru:
Everyone's trembling. No, naked and trembling waiting to see it.

Akira:
 We can't tease the fans like this.
 Come on, you guys, let's give them what they want.
 All we need's a 30-minute block to do it.
 We can steal a 30 from the next show, right guys?

Minoru:
I don’t think they can do that on short notice.

Akira:

Minoru:
By-nee.


Akira:


Minoru:
I heard that.
I've seen that happened before.
The main character's friend who's the bad guy,
basically whoever isn’t the main character,
they end up being more popular.
 ...............
A, Akira-sama, what’s wrong?

Akira:
So, you are taking about yourself?
 You're taking about you.
 You've got a big fat head out,
 'cause you are the popular one!
 They're gonna make an actor's figure out of you.


Minoru:
No, it's not like that.
No, no, they are not..
What are you talking about?
I've never said…
Hang on a second.
Please stop it and hear me ou…

Konata:


Tsukasa:
 Yuki-chan, let's go sing up front.
 
Miyuki:
 Uh, sure.
 
Kagami

 
Konata:
 Oh, I know a whole lot of songs, all types too.


Kagami:
Konata:
When you need to pick a song in a hurry, anime songs are the way to go.

Kagami:Narration:
On the next episode of Lucky Star.

Tsukasa:

Narration:
Look forward to it.
