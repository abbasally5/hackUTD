Kagami:
 Wow, that's unusual.

Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:
 No, library wouldn't really carry that big a selection of manga.

Kagami:

Konata:
 Naah, I just can't concentrate.

Konata:
Ummm, sa sa saa, basa basa...

Konata:



Tsukasa:


Kagami:
 Sure, we can study together.

Kagami:


Tsukasa:


Kagami:
 I see. Are you gonna watch it then?

Tsukasa:
 Hmm, it's okay. I'm recording it.

Tsukasa:


Kagami:
Oh...

Kagami:
 Boink...

Tsukasa:


Kagami:

Tsukasa:


Kagami:



Konata:


Miyuki:
 Oh, you say you'd like some tips for studying?

Konata:
 Yup, I was sort of wondering if you had any advice for me.

Miyuki:

Konata:


Kagami:

Tsukasa:
 Oh, you mean even if it's really, really cute?

Konata:


Miyuki:
 My! I didn't realize they could be so utterly frightening.

Kagami:

All:
Huh?

Konata:

Kagami:

Konata:

Tsukasa:


Kagami:

Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:
 Hm?

Konata:


Kagami:
 Yeah.

Konata:

Kagami:


Konata:


Tsukasa:
 Ah!

Konata:
 Well, I'm not gonna worry too much about blowing the test this time.

Kagami:


Konata:
 Hmm...

Kagami:

Kagami:


Konata:
 I think Miyuki-san is very sensible, she's definitely a type A person.

Miyuki:


Kagami:
 Really, O? You don't look it.

Miyuki:
 Well, actually...

Miyuki:


Konata:


Kagami:
 Aren't you a type A person?

Konata:
 Yeah, although a lot of people mistake me for a type B person.

Kagami:


Konata:
 I'm a really caring and sensitive person, don't you know?

Kagami:
 Only about the things you're interested in.

Konata:
 I'm gentle and kind and love everyone!

Kagami:
 Only when you need to copy homework.

Konata:

Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:
 Got a problem with it?

Konata:

Tsukasa:
 Huh?

Kagami:
 Why do you say that?

Tsukasa:
 Yeah, why?

Konata:

Kagami:


Konata:
 Oh, yeah, that's right, my bad.

Kagami:


Miyuki:


Konata:
 Sushi?

Konata:
 Here is what Miyuki-san is...

Kagami:
 Ooh, Miyuki is Ikura, huh?

Miyuki:
 Even her sushi is classy.

Miyuki:
 Goody, I just love Ikura.

Kagami:
 So, how about me and Tsukasa?

Kagami, Tsukasa:
 Hmm...

Tsukasa:
 Cucumber roll...

Konata:

Kagami:

Konata:
 I wonder...

Konata:

Kagami:


Konata:
 Don't be dissing* the ginger!

Miyuki:

Tsukasa:
 Yeah, Miyuki is right.

Kagami:
 Cucumber rolls are more like sushi than ginger...

Konata:
 Hmm!
American slang for "Disrespecting (disrespect)"不遜 /
Kagami:

Konata:


Kagami:

Konata:


Tadao:
 Wow, you did pretty good this time, Tsukasa.

Tsukasa:

Tadao:
 Ooh, Kagami, this time you didn't do as good as you usually do.

Kagami:
 Hmm.

Tadao:


Matsuri:
 Wow, you did pretty good, Tsukasa?!

Tsukasa:
 Ehe...

Matsuri:

Tadao:
 Come on, Matsuri, can't you be a little more considerate...


Kagami, Tsukasa:

Woman:
Uh, good morning, girls, how are you?
The two of you are such fine young ladies.
I really do envy you, you know that?

Kagami:
 Oh, no.

Tsukasa:
 Not at all...

Woman:
You're both of Ryouou high, right?
I hear your grades are so stellar.
Oh, if only I can get my child to be half as smart as you,
I would be so happy.

Tsukasa:


Kagami:

stellar : 花形の、星の（ような）、優れた
Kagami:

Konata:
 Yeah, good call!

Kagami:
 You guys wanna go see a movie or something?

Tsukasa:
 Is there anything good playing right now?

Konata


Kagami:
 Oh, really?

Konata:


Kagami:


Tsukasa:
 Uh...

Kagami:


Konata:


Tsukasa:



Girl:
We still have a couple of minutes.

Kagami:


Tsukasa:
 Oh, darn it.

Kagami:


Tsukasa, Kagami:
 Ah!

Kagami:


Konata:

Kagami:
 Why? What's the deal?

Konata:


Kagami:


Geez Louise: Though there is no definite meaning, some people believe it is meant to be a cute version of the expression "Oh Jesus Christ!!". Said when someone is annoyed.
Girl:
That was scary, Takepi!

Boy:
Oh, man, you're so cute!

Kagami:
 I could use some food right now.

Konata:


Tsukasa:
 Uh-huh.

Kagami:
 What do you wanna eat?

Konata:
 Hey, how about we had at a cake buffet?

Kagami:
 That sounds good!

Konata:
 A Buffet... The sanctuary for all that a woman desires!

Kagami:
 They sure have a lot of different cakes and drinks here.

Tsukasa:
 Yeah, you're right.

Kagami:
 I wonder if we can try one of everything?

Konata:
 Piece of cake for you, Kagamin.

Waitress:
First things first, there's a one-hour time limit for each table.
You can find our selection of drinks over in the drink corner.
And you'll find our various cakes in the showcases over there.
So, feel free to take what you want.

Konata, Kagami, Tsukasa:
 Okay!

Waitress:
Now.

Waitress:
Oh, by the way, if you can't finish an excessive amount of leftovers,
you have to pay a separate fee for what you leave behind.
I just wanted to give you ladies a heads-up.

Konata, Kagami, Tsukasa:
 Okay...

Waitress:
Very good, please enjoy yourselves.

Konata:

Kagami:


Kagami:


Konata:

Kagami:

Konata, Kagami, Tsukasa:
 Let's eat some cake!

Konata:


Konata:
 Okay, this is starting to hurt now...

Kagami:
 We kept filling up our plates, and now we can't finish.

Konata:
 Uh... I think I'm ready to pop...

Waitress:
Uh-huh...

Tsukasa:
 Uh... but the lady said we'd be charged for the leftovers!

Konata:


Kagami:
 Wah, our time's almost up!

Konata:
 Whoa, Kagamin, you're pounding two pieces at once!

Kagami:
 Of course, I don't wanna waste it!

Tsukasa:
 Uh...

Kagami:
 Don't do it!

Tsukasa:
 Huh?

Kagami:


Konata:
 Uh...

Kagami:
 Don't just sit there, pick up your fork and suck down some more cake!

Konata:
 But I can't eat anymore.

Kagami:
 You've got room for some pudding or Bavarian cream, go on!

Konata:
 No, it's all you, have fun...

Kagami:
 I'm gonna hurl if I take another bite, come on!

Konata:
 No way, I've retired from eating.

Kagami:
 The pudding is gooey, you can slurp it.

Konata:
 Waa...

Kagami:
 Come on! Hurry up!

Tsukasa:

Konata:

Kagami:

Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:
 Hm? I don't buy that stuff. Dad buys it.

Tsukasa:
Whoa!?

Kagami:



Konata:


Miyuki:


Konata:


Miyuki:


Konata:
 Oh, Miyuki-san, sure they're called games, but they're not really games!

Tsukasa:


Miyuki:


Konata:

Tsukasa:
 There sure was a lot of stuff happening in sports this year.

Miyuki:

Tsukasa:

Kagami:
 If you are talking baseball, there's also that player who left for America.

Konata:

Kagami:
 Yeah, for a while.

Konata:
 Eh! No way! Were there any sales?

Kagami:

Konata:
 Fuu...

Tsukasa:
 There was a commemorative sale, though.

Konata:

Tsukasa:
 I wonder if it was ham...

Konata:
 I just gotta make sure that next year I don't miss the sales.

Kagami:
 Oh, well knowing you, I bet you're just gonna load up on candy and stuff.

Konata:


Kagami:
 Huh?

Konata:
 Oh, that's right, Kagami, you wouldn't know about any of that, would you?

Kagami:



Miyuki:
 Uh... Ah!

Konata:

Miyuki:
 Thank you, I'd really appreciate it.

Konata:

Miyuki:
 O... Okay.

Konata:
 Hi. Now, just relax.

Miyuki:

Konata:
 Here it comes.

Miyuki:
 Uh... Ah!

Konata:
 Come on. Relax, okay?

Miyuki:

Konata:
 Hmm...

Miyuki:


Kagami:


Konata:

Kagami:
 How?

Konata:

Kagami:


Akira:


Minoru:
Why?
What I do?
Oh, I'm Minoru Shiraishi, giving a hundred percent of all I got as Akira-sama's assistant.
It's a pleasure to see you again.

Akira:


Minoru:
Ah! Where is it, it's under the..., thing with that, got it.

Akira:
Finally... 

Minoru, Akira:
Hiiragi...

Akira:
 Tsk!

Minoru:
I'm sorry.

Akira:


Minoru:
Yes, we are strapping on our loincloths, and getting down to the business.
Right, Akira-sama?

Akira:


Minoru:
Yeah, I’ll do that... Okay...
Um.., how about we give ourselves wedgies with those loincloths...

Akira:
So, I’m just gonna go out on a limb here, and give you a piece of advice.

Minoru:
You are.. out on a limb?

Akira:
If all you got as a comedian is toilet humor, you’re done.

Minoru:
I didn’t know, I was a comedian...

Akira:
And using other people's material is a no-no.
 You do that a lot. Cool it.

Minoru:
Okay...

Akira:
 Okay! What were we talking about?
 
Minoru:
Oh, we were introducing Tsukasa Hiiragi.

Akira:
 Oh yeah, that's the one who looks like the character of “To Heart”…
 
Minoru:
Mi-Mi-Miracle!

Akira:
Akari Kamigishi.

Minoru:
Minorun-run!!

Akira:
 Doesn't she?

Minoru:
I can't believe you’d say that.

Akira:


Minoru:
Yeah, I guess you are right.
She does a little bit.
Okay, I see it. She definitely has what it takes to become an idol.
If I didn’t know any better, I... aah!

Akira:


Minoru:
You didn’t have to throw an ashtray at me.

Akira:

 You still have no concept just what a real idol is.
 Learn your frigging job.
 
Minoru:
I'm sorry.

Akira:
That girl is just a soothing character type.
 I mean, come on, with those droopy eyes and that sad look, hello.
 
Minoru:
Okay, maybe she doesn’t look happy.
Not even my father hit me before!

Akira:
Whatever, that hoochie* is not what’s important right now.

 We’ll start with the posing basics.

Minoru:
Huh?

Akira:

 
Minoru:
Yes, ma’am.

Akira:
Here’s how to deal when you are ambushed by a bunch of cameras.
 Okay, go ahead, push the button. Blink, blink, blink.

Minoru:
Droopy eyes and a sad look.

Akira:
You see what I’m talking about?

 
Minoru:
Where?

Akira:
 There is times when you’d be walking down the street looking fabulous.
 You never know when someone’s gonna whip out a camera and starts shooting.
 So you’ve got to stay frosty* and make sure your choppers are sparkly white.
 Shinjo.

Minoru:
Theater.

Akira:
Your eyes should be big and round and don’t even think about blinking.
 Keep smirk kinda this area only.

Minoru:
Psycho!

Akira:
When posing, your expressions must be natural and organic.
 For example, if someone lines up a medium close-up of you like this.
 Akira, so surprised! It’s like that.

Minoru:
Right, very…. natural.

Akira:
There’s also a version of that pose for when you and some guy are caught leaving a ho..
 Oh, no! it’s time to say goodbye already?
 Now don’t you guys forget to keep sending in those cards and letters.

 You can also shoot us an email or call in to the radio show.

Minoru:
Yes, we’ll be seeing you all in the next episode.

Akira:
 By-nee!


Akira:
 We had a photo shoot, didn’t we?

Minoru:
That’s right, we did.

Akira:
Yeah.

Minoru:
I wore this little pink cardigan?

Akira:
Whew, you were so cute!

Minoru:
 Thank you. What’s wrong?

Akira:
 Um, maybe not.

Minoru:
Well, everyone said I was cute.

Akira:
But you were so into it, weren’t you?
 
Minoru:
Yeah, I guess I was.

Akira:
But you were having fun.

Minoru:
Well, I mean, looking up into the camera, the hands folded under the chin pose.
Yeah, it was fun, yeah. Yeah!

Akira:
 Huh, you were totally hot.
 
Minoru:
Totally, even a cross-dress, totally hot.

Akira:
Did you check the photos?

Minoru:
No, I haven’t.

Akira:
Well, the manager did.
 
Minoru:
Yeah?

Akira:
 She said something about a couple of shots being, um, problematic?

Minoru:
Well, I wouldn’t worry too much about it.
I’m sure they got a ton of shots of me when I'm really hot.

Konata:
Sorry, that was a rookie move.
 Let me make it up to you, guys.

Kagami:
 She says that she enters another song.
 Give someone else a chance.

Konata:
Okay, here.
Tsukasa:
 I'm still looking.

Miyuki:
I'm looking too. But I’m afraid I don't know that many songs.

Konata:
No sweat.
 I’ll just sing until you are ready.

Kagami:
You think you could sing something else besides an anime song?

Konata:
 You are in luck! It’s not.

Kagami:
Huh? I've heard this before.
 What is it?

Konata:
 It's Kyon Kyon.


Kagami:
So instead of an anime song, you picked an oldies.

Konata:
 What! You are insulting Kyon Kyon by calling this an oldies.

Kagami:
Look, Tsukasa, just pick an easy song.
 Like a children’s song.

Tsukasa:
Um, yeah, I'm looking in that section.

Miyuki:
I’m so sorry.

Kagami:
No, it's okay.
 Don't worry about it.
 We still got lots of time left.
 

Narration:
On the next episode of Lucky Star...

Konata:
Konata here.
 You know how in world 3-1 in Super “bleep bleep” Brothers,

 All you have to do is stomp on it and keep hitting your A button.

 Cool, right?
 But if you keep jumping on that turtle and go over 129 lives, you’ll die.
 That's it. Game over. No more lives.
 What's up with that?
 Hello! Anyone else hear problem here?
 “Infinite lives” means you live forever.
 Anyway I think it sucks, but then again, maybe that’s the point.

 You think?
 
 Next time, "Desires".

Narration:
Look forward to it
