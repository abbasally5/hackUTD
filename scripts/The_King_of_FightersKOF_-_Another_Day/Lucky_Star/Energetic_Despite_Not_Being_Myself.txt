  Broadcaster:
Today is the warmest, it's been all autumn in all over the country.
School athletic festivals are what's happening.

Soujiro:

Konata:

Kagami:


Tsukasa:


Kagami:
 Uh... I wasn't serious, I was just thinking.

Konata:
 Such a profound response must mean it's about a guy, isn't it?!

Kagami:


Konata:
 But if Kagami did go and cut her hair...

Kagami:

Konata:


Kagami:
 Sorry, my face is so boring!

Konata:


Kagami:
 I never thought I'd hear a teenager say that.

Tsukasa:


Konata:
 You're gonna be fine.

Tsukasa:
 Hey, Sis, which event are you gonna sign up for?

Konata:
 I totally know it, Kagami's gonna pick... the bread-eating race!

Kagami:
 If I didn't know better, I'd say you're trying to pick a fight with me?

Konata:
 All righty then, what event are you going to sign up for?

Tsukasa:
 Hm?

Konata:


Kagami:
 Pissing me off!

Kagami:

Tsukasa:
 Really...

Konata:


Kagami:
 What event thing?

Konata:
 You want me to say it?

Kagami:
 Really pissing me off!

Kagami:


Konata:
 You're telling me, but get this, at first she was gonna do the obstacle course.

Kuroi:
 Okay, does anybody else feel like volunteering?

Miyuki:
 No, I've never done that before, I'll do my best.

Konata:
 But you can't, Miyuki-san.

Miyuki:
 Huh?

Konata:


Kagami:
 Doesn't like something a middle-aged guy would say?

Konata:


Kagami:
 Yeah, we did those.

Konata:
 One time, a guy who was doing it came up to me with this list.

Konata:
 Me?

Konata:


Kagami:
 There are so many unspeakable things that could be.

Konata:
 Well, I could ask Miyuki-san, she might have an idea.

Kagami:


Kagami:
 She asked her anyway!

Miyuki:


Konata:
 Uh-huh.

Miyuki:

Tsukasa, Kagami:
 Figure, she is the master at dodging difficult questions.

Kagami:
 But I'm sure she is wrong.


Miyuki:
 I do enjoy the athletic festivals, but after that we still have exams.

Tsukasa:


Miyuki:
 The midterm, proficiency and finals, exams are all we have left.

Konata:

Tsukasa:
 Yeah.

Miyuki:
 And midterm is going to be especially difficult.

Tsukasa, Konata:
 Uh...

Tsukasa:
 I heard that autumn's a good time for reading, so maybe I'll read some books.

Miyuki:
 The climate this time of the year is also excellent for studying.

Konata:
 And right before Christmas is when they bust out all the new games!

Miyuki:
 Although we have final exams before that.

Tsukasa, Konata:


Kagami:


Tsukasa, Kon
Yui:


Konata:
 You've gotta be kidding!

Yui:


Konata:
 Wait, you chose your career because of a misunderstanding?

Soujiro:
 Oh, by the way, Konata, when's the school athletics festival happening?

Konata:
 Here. It's this Sunday.

Soujiro:


Konata:
 But Dad, we just got the flyer today.

Soujiro:
 I... better get ready!

Konata, Yui:
 Hm?

Yui:
 What's up with your dad?

Kuroi:

Konata


Kuroi:


Konata:

Miyuki:

Kuroi:

Konata:
 'Cause you're just a kid.


Tsukasa:
 We're rooting for you, Sis!

Miyuki:
 Do your best out there!

Tsukasa:


Miyuki:
 Most likely the buns are attached by some sort of clip or something.

Tsukasa:

Konata:
 Just remember you're a girl, and as a girl you must win elegantly!

Kagami:

Man:
Get set...

Kagami:
 Haaaaah...

Tsukasa:
 She did it!

Konata:
 Yup, that's our Kagamin.

Miyuki:
 Uh, that man's camera is really amazing.

Konata:
 Huh?

Soujiro:
 Hm!

Konata:

Kagami:

Konata:
 Yeah, I guess.

Tsukasa:
 Kona-chan, can you teach me how to run fast like you?

Konata:

Man:
On your mark...
Get set...

Kagami:

Konata:

Kagami:
Man:
3 meters 25 centimeters!

Konata:
 If you fall back, they only measure up to where your hands hit.

Kagami:


Konata:
 That's Kagami, the sands not even safe from her jabs.

Tsukasa:


Miyuki:
 I heard that you run the hurdles you have to time the number of your steps.

Tsukasa:
 I don't get it.

Miyuki:
 One, two, and three and jump!

Tsukasa:
 Oh, now I get it!

Tsukasa:


Man:
Get set...

Tsukasa:


Konata:

Kagami:
 She's got a knack for it.

Tsukasa:
 Ah, Ajapa...

Tsukasa:

Soujiro:


Konata:
 Same old, same old.

Konata:
 Time for the last relay race.

Tsukasa:
 Yuki-chan, do your best out there!

Soujiro:


Boy:
Yeah, way to go! You can do it! Run!

Tsukasa:
 All right! We're in second place!

Konata:
 We're doing pretty good then.

Girl1:
Over here, Sachi!

Girl1:
Here!

Girl2:
Got it!

Tsukasa:

Konata:
 Now, this is what I call a race!

Kagami:
 They're putting up a good fight.

Konata:
 It's getting interesting...

Tsukasa:

Girl3:
Here!

Girl4:
Got it!

Girl5:
Got it!

Tsukasa:
 Wow!

Tsukasa:
 Go, Miyuki!

Tsukasa:
 All right! Yuki-chan, you're so awesome!

Konata:


Kagami:


Kagami:
 Hey ya, could you do something about that noise?

Tsukasa:


Kagami:
 Why did you choose the alto part?

Tsukasa:
 Well, I thought that the lower parts would be easier to play.

Kagami:

Tsukasa:
 Oh.

Kagami:

Kagami:


Kagami:
 Wait, hang on, Tsukasa, try it by yourself.

Kagami:

Tsukasa:

Kagami:
 Yup!

Tsukasa:


Kagami:
 She's sucking in more air than she's blowing out.

Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:
 Aren't you used to this kinda stuff from all the Cons you go to?

Konata:
 Yeah, but if there's nothing exciting at the other end, waiting in line sucks.

Kagami:
 Well, at least you stay true to the things you like.

Miyuki:


Konata:
 You're always supposed to check what you're lining up for before you line up.

Miyuki:
 I was standing in line for hours...

Tsukasa:

Kagami:
 You're just unlucky, Tsukasa.

Miyuki:
 Uh, do you all know what you're getting for lunch today?

Everyone:
Huh?

Konata:
 How tragic, oh well, I guess curry is good enough.

Kagami:
 I think I'm gonna go with ramen.

Tsukasa:


Konata:
 You're also gonna get the eclair and the flan pudding?

Kagami:
 Only if I have room for dessert.

Konata:

Kagami:
 Ugh...!

Tsukasa:

Miyuki:
 I think I'd like to have a sandwich today, with some strawberries.

Konata:
 That totally sounds like something you'd have.

Tsukasa:
 Yeah, I know.

Konata:


Miyuki:
 You do have a point there...

Kagami:
 You get picky about the weirdest things.

Tsukasa:


Konata:

Konata:

Miyuki:
 Ah!

Kagami:

Konata:
 That girl is moe incarnate.

Tsukasa:
 Oh, look, Kona-chan, you're up next.

Konata:
 I'd like some curry please, with extra sauce.

Woman1:
You got it.

Kagami:
 I admire you're cunning.

Konata:
 Hey, I'll take whatever I can get.

Woman2:
Okay, next!

Kagami:

Woman2:
Okay, it'll just take me a minute.

Woman1:
Sorry about the wait, here you go.

Konata:
 I'll go ahead and grab at some seats, okay guys?

Kagami:

Tsukasa:

Woman2:
Okay, folks, who's next?

Tsukasa:

Woman2:
Oh, I'm sorry, the person ahead of you just got the last of the noodles.
We're all out of ramen for today.

Tsukasa:
 Ah!

Kagami:

Tsukasa:

Tsukasa:

Kagami:
 Hm?

Tsukasa:
 You get to be the older sister because you were the one to pop out first, right?

Kagami:
 That's right.

Tsukasa:

Kagami:

Tsukasa:


Kagami:


Tsukasa:
 Okay!

Tsukasa:


Kagami:
 Oh, please, Sis, could you show me your homework?

Tsukasa:


Kagami:

Konata:


Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:


Konata:


Konata:
 Yum yum.

Cashier:
That'll be 2587 yen, please.

Konata:


Man:
Uh, they're stuck and it looks like they wanna stay together, huh?

Woman:
Oh, I'm so sorry.

Konata:


Kagami:
 Yeah, you think?

Konata:

Kagami:

Akira:

 Delivering tons of love with a dream-colored heart.
 I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami.
 Welcome to Lucky Channel!

Minoru:
 Hi, there, I'm Minoru Shiraishi, the assistant.

Akira:
 Whoa, it's already the eighth episode.
 Isn't it crazy how time just flies by?

Minoru:
 I heard that.

 
Akira:
 What was that?

Minoru:
 What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?!
 No, I was thinking... about trying some new stuff is all...　　
 
Akira:
 You said it.

Minoru:
 You know. Yeah.
 
Akira:
 Yeah.
 Oh, by the way, when I was walking around the other day.
 Someone called me over.

Minoru:
 Was it a survey for a day spa?

Akira: 
 Oh, come on now, Shiraishi-san, do you know what you are saying?
 Of course you don't know.
 See it was a fan.
 But you don't know about fans.
 Because you don't have any, RIGHT?!!

Minoru:
 AH! No. I don't have any fans!
 
Akira:
 No, of course, you DON'T!
 You're just an assistant, RIGHT?!
 Keep up the hard work, assistant. Aahahahah!!!

Minoru:
 But I do have a couple of fans. Look.
 Dokkoi-Shouichi!
 You see.
 Starting feel like a seiyu.

Akira:
 Wow, What the.., what the hell, Ito. Where's my fan letters?!
 Why you? Just one-freaking letter?
 Your membership is about to expire, please respond by...
 Naw, this is junk mail from the video store!

 I want want want your letters. OK?
 
Minoru:
 Shouldn't we be starting the show now, Akira-sama?
 
Akira:
 Ya Feelme?

Minoru:
 Sorry ma'am.
 
Akira:
 Ta-dah. We have an announcement.


Minoru:
 Akira-sama, the board, it’s upside down.
 Oh, ha, you're doing it on purpose.
 You're so funny.

Akira:
 Let me tell you, guys, how it is gonna work this time around.
 Peel, peel, peel, peel…

Minoru:
 Don’t touch me.

Akira:
 Heh hee, this is totally weird.
 So, here's how it's gonna work this time around.
 
Minoru:
 Don't ...Touch... Me.
 
Akira:

 Hey, what the hell you guys!
 Hey, what the...
 You're blocking my close-up, Joe.
 Get the hell out of my shot.
 Get your ass out of the way!
 
Minoru:
 Akira-sama, calm down
 That's the name of your manager in real life.
 
Akira:


Minoru:
 No, it’s not!

Akira:

 We are waiting for your opinions.
 So don't disappoint us.
 You got it?

Minoru:
 Hgh... ! So make sure you guys vote for your favorite.
 
Akira:
 Whoa, it looks like full hour to show for today.

Minoru:
 I hope we see each other again next time.

Akira:
 Bye bye-nee.

Akira:
 It's obvious someone from the mainsegment's gonna get this one too.
 What am I?
 Some kind of a freak, a friggin' clown?
 
Minoru:
 Nothing's been decided yet.
 Actually they are making a figure out of me.
 
Akira:
 Who said you were...
Tsukasa:
 Yuki-chan, that was amazing.

Miyuki:
 I'm sorry. it wasn’t better.

Kagami:
 That's a side of you I never thought I'd see.

Miyuki
 Oh, please, you're embarrassing me.

Tsukasa
 Oh, Yuki-chan, let's sing something together.

Miyuki:
 I'd love to.

Kagami:
 Yeah, go for it, guys. Sing a duet.

Tsukasa:
 What do you wanna sing?

Miyuki:
 Let me see.

Konata:
 While you decide, I’m gonna rock the mic!

Kagami:
 You're gonna sing again?

Konata:
 Yeah, Kagami. And you should sing more too.

Kagami:
 What’s this?

Konata:
 Saiyuki, Machaki’s Songoku was the best!

Tsukasa:
 Didn’t Shingo-chan play that character?

Konata:
 Yeah, like the third time they did it.

 Yes, could you feel that?

Kagami:
 How old are you?
 Hmm... this is a long intro.

Konata:
 This is the part where Akutagawa-senseigoes into his awesome narration.

Kagami:
 I don’t know who that is!

Konata:
 Oh, here it comes.
 "Ah chaaa..”

Kagami:
 More shouting!

Konata:
 What the...? That’s not even in English.
 I’m out.

Kagami:
 You got us all worked up for nothing.
 

Narration:
On the next episode of Lucky Star.

 Well, that was the original meaning behind the term.

 
 Next time, ”That Feeling”.
 
Narration:
Look forward to it
