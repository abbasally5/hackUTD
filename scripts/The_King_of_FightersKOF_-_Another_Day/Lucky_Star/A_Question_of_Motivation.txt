  Kuroi:
 Anyone wanna tackle this problem?
 Shiraishi!

Shiraishi:
 Aww, you made me do the last one!

Kuroi:
 Really?
 Then, Izumi.
 Izumi!

Konata:
 Ah! No, I wasn't sleeping.

Kuroi:
 I didn't say you were.
 You have a good nap?


Tsukasa:
 Oh... Oh no! I forgot my English textbook!

Konata:
 Then just go borrow Kagami's.
 She already had English today, didn't she?

Kagami:
 Jeez, what's with you?
 How could you be so careless?

Tsukasa:
 Yeah, I know.

Kagami:
 Check your bag before coming to school.

Konata:
 Tsukasa forgets stuff all the time, doesn't she?

Kagami:
 All the time.
 But, now that you mention it, you never forget stuff like textbooks, do you?

Konata:
 I have to say, when it comes to things like that, I'm pretty reliable.
 I never take my textbooks home, so there's no worries.

Kagami:
 Yeah, see what I'm saying?
 That's not being reliable at all.

Kagami:
 If you leave your books here, then you can't study the stuff you learned in class that day.

Konata:
 But I never study at home, so what's the point?

Kagami:
 Yeah, you take your books home to study the night before a test, blah, blah, blah.

Tsukasa:
 But Kona-chan's really good at pulling the all-nighters.

Konata:
 That's it!
 I bet that's the reason I always forget to do my homework.

Kagami:

 You lack the motivation to do it.

Konata:
 Speaking of homework, can I see today's stuff for Japanese class?

Kagami:
 See what I mean?
 I just thought of something.
 If you're in the same class as Miyuki, why don't you ask to see her homework?

Konata:
 Yeah, how do I put it...
 Miyuki-san's such a good person that it just doesn't feel right asking her.
 It feels kind of weird, you know.
 You sorta get what I'm saying?

Kagami:
 Yeah, kind of.
 That's a pretty weak excuse if you ask me.
Kuroi:
 Izumi!
 Izumi!
 What, is she late again?

Konata:
 No! Stop! Hold it!
 I'm here! I'm not late!

Kuroi:
 Uh?

Konata:
 I'm late, but I'm late 'cause I was helping someone out.

Kuroi:
 Oh...

Konata:
 It's someone I hang out with all the time, but today I couldn't just get up
 and leave him like that 'cause it's not right!

Kuroi:
 'Kay...?

Konata:
 So then he said, "No worries, I'm cool. Let's disband," but I can't!
 'Cause if the other five get what they want,
 not one guy's the only one who couldn't get it.
 That sucks!
 And I kind of feel guilty 'cause that's not cool, you know?
 I mean, when you've been hangin' out with people this long,
 you're supposed to back 'em up.
 Yeah, having friends is a good thing, isn't it?

Kuroi:
 Yes, it is.
 So I guess you spent all night gaming it up on line, is that it?

Konata:
 Ugh!

Kuroi:
 Kept playing after I logged off, huh?

Kuroi:
 Izumi!
 Izumi!
 What, is she late again?

Konata:
 No! Stop! Hold it!
 I'm here! I'm not late!
 I was walking past this strip mall on my way here, and this girl bumps into me,
 and all of a sudden she grabs my hand and starts running.
 She tells me that she stole a piece of taiyaki and is on the run.
 I'm running and listening to her, and I'm thinking, "She's nuts!"
 So we're running and I'm thinking "Why me?"
 But she's holding on to me and I'm stuck! 
And we duck into this cafe to hide from the owner of the taiyaki shop.

Kuroi:
 Uguu, there are so many places in that story to nitpick!
 But I can't do it as a teacher... as a human being...!

Konata:
 Ohh... I caught a summer cold...

Kuroi:
 Hey, Izumi. Is something wrong with you?

Konata:
 Yeah, I'm really sorry, ma'am.
 But I need to take a sick day today...

Kuroi:
 Haha, you were up all night gaming, huh?
 You used the sick excuse before, so it ain't gonna work.

Konata:
 No, I really am sick this time, and I...

Kuroi:
 Hahaha, don't tell me, "I got a summer cold!"
 The rainy season's over now, and the weather's great.
 So get out of bed and get to class!

Konata:
 Uh...

Konata:
 She didn't even believe me.
 She treated me like I'm the boy who cried wolf or something.

Kagami:
 Well, you reap what you sow.

Tsukasa:
 You feeling any better today, Kona-chan?

Konata:
 I think my fever's gone down, but my throat still kinda hurts.

Tsukasa:
 Oh, I know why that is. It's 'cause you breathe through your mouth.

Konata, Kagami:
 Huh?

Tsukasa:
 Huh what?

Kagami:
 Well, yeah, everyone breathes through their mouth,
 but you mostly breathe through your nose, don't you?

Tsukasa:

 way more than her nose.

Konata:
 Hm?

Tsukasa:
 I mean, you know how when you get a throat cold,
 it's 'cause a cold virus got in through your mouth?
 And if you get a sinus cold, it's 'cause it got in through your nose.
 So you figure anyone who gets a throat cold is a mouth breather
 'cause that's how the virus got in their throat.
 Get it?

Konata:
 Uh, uh... How about we let Miyuki-san handle stuff like this?

Kagami:
 Yeah...

Tsukasa:
 Okay...

Konata:
 It's hot...
 I don't feel like doing anything.

Konata:
 Hello, Kagamin?
 How about we have your birthday party over at my place today?
 It's so hot right now, I can't move a muscle.

Kagami:
 Aww! That sucks.
 I was just baking some cookies too.

Konata:
 Coming.

Kagami:
 Cool!
 See you in a bit!


Kagami:
 Come on in!

Konata:
 Happy Birthday, Tsukasa! And the other one with the longer hair!

Kagami:
 I have a name!

Miyuki:
 Happy Birthday, Kagami-san and Tsukasa-san.
 I hope you like the flowers we brought.

Kagami:
 Oh, thank you!

Tsukasa:
 Thanks a lot!

Miyuki:
 You're welcome!
 I know it's not much but I saw this and thought you'd like them.

Kagami:
 What is it?

Miyuki:
 Oh, please, open it!

Tsukasa:
 Oh, they're matching earrings!

Miyuki:
 I couldn't decide on what to get, but I thought those might look great on you.

Konata:
 You two are gonna flip when you see the presents I got you.

Kagami:
 What is it?

Konata:
 Go on! Open it!

Kagami:
 What's this?

Konata:
 A brigade leader armband.
 I knew you'd love it.

Kagami:
 Jeez, Konata! Why do you think I'd wear something like this?

Konata:
 Aw, come on, Kagami. Just put it on.
 I think it'd look perfect on you.

Kagami:
 It's more your style.

Tsukasa:
 Um... What's this?

Kagami:
"To Heart"?!

Konata:
 It was really expensive too!
 Take care of it when you wear it.

Kagami:
 Hey, stop trying to make both of us cosplay!

Konata:
 It's not that different from our school uniforms.


Miyuki:
 That could be a problem.
 Well, if it's too big.

Tsukasa:
 I know and what if it's stinky too?

Kagami:

 You think you could ease up on the cookie eating?

Konata:
 I can't help it.
 Tsukasa makes the best cookies ever!

Kagami:
 Oh, glad you like 'em.
 Actually I helped her bake those this morning.
 Yeah, she taught me a lot.

Kagami:
 So what's wrong with you?

Konata:
 I don't know, but suddenly I'm thinkin' that a few of these cookies aren't
 as tasty as some of the other cookies are.

Kagami:
 What was that?!

Konata:
 Is this one of your cookies, Kagami?

Kagami:
 Is anyone ready for a slice of this yummy cake?

Konata:
 That's our Kagami! A hard worker, but only on her birthday.

Kagami:
 Shut up.

Konata:
 By the way, when you guys cut the cake, do you end up arguing about it?

Kagami:
 Huh? About what?

Konata:
 The cake. I mean, you're cutting all those slices.
 How do you guys decide who gets the strawberry on top?
 And which one of you gets to eat the little chocolate thingy?

Tsukasa:
 You've always loved eating the chocolate sign, right Sis?

Kagami:
 Ugh! My slicing is off today.

Konata:
 It's not moe when she's clumsy.

Kagami:
 What'd you say?

Konata:
 Thank you for the food!

Miyuki:
 Thank you for the food.

Konata:
 Uhhh...

Kagami:
 What's wrong?

Kagami:
 My strawberry is so small...

Konata:
 Heh...

Kagami:
 What's the matter?
 Do I have cake on my face or something?

Konata:
 I think I've just found another charming quality about Kagamin, is all.

Kagami:
 Stop talking like him, okay?



Kagami:
 Can you believe summer vacation's almost here again?

Tsukasa:
 You're right, it is.

Kagami:
 The beach, the pool, summer festivals...
 Anything else that we absolutely have to do?

Konata:
 Screech.
 There's only one festival that matters during summer!
 The war zone in Ariake!
 No matter what, it's gotta be Comiket!

 Kagami:
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that stuff's only for you!

Tsukasa:
 War zone?


Kagami:
 W-well, I guess there's something for everyone to do.
 Some people like to visit their relatives, right?

Miyuki:
 Good morning, everyone.

Kagami:
 Hi, Miyuki.
 Hey, what do you do every summer vacation?

Miyuki:
 Well, let me see...
 There was talk about vacationing overseas again.
 We'll probably do that.

Kagami:
 Oh?! Again?! Did you say, "again?!" Damn bourgeois...

Tsukasa:
 Isn't that yogurt?

Kagami:
 When you said you started working at the cosplay cafe, I was kinda surprised.
 Don't those places only hire girls with amazing figures?

Konata:
 Yeah, I know my lack of breastiness is something that's always really bugged me.
 But in this game, they were saying that a flat chest was a status symbol,
 and how it's considered rare! Hm!
 And when you think about it, there's probably a demand for that kind of thing.
 I'm quite the valuable commodity!

Kagami:
 I wanna know how a line from a game can make you so confident.

Tsukasa:
 Then, maybe I'm valuable too?

Kagami:
 Finals are coming up, and here you are playing games all the time.
 You should be studying, you know?
 If only you could somehow channel your passion for gaming into studying more,
 your grades would be so much better.

Kagami:
 Ah! If a game could influence her that much... maybe if there was a game
 that promoted studying, it would turn her into a genius.
 There are those moe quiz games.

Konata:
 What's wrong?

Kagami:
 Hasn't there been an awful lot of teenage crime lately?

Konta:
 I know, and when it happens, they always ask the neighbors about it.
 And they say something like:
 "Yeah, he always seemed to be a nice boy.
 He didn't seem to be the type that could do that."

Kagami:
 Well, then it's all the more reason to be careful.
 You can't tell what someone's capable of until they snap.

Kagami:
 Oh, although if you ever did something horrible,
 "I always knew deep down she would do something like this,"
 is exactly what I'd tell everyone.


 Ugh!


Konata:
 It's so hot...

Konata:
 It's so hot, I don't feel like doing anything anymore.

Kagami:
 I know what you mean.
 It has been hot lately.
 Then again, you've always got one reason or another for not doing anything,
 don't ya?



Konata:
 Hello there, Kagamin.

Kagami:
 Hey, so how's the studying coming along, huh?

Konata:
 Hmm, yeah, well, I was just cleaning up my room.

Kagami:
 Huh?

Konata:
 You know how when you've got something important you have to do,
 but you get this urge to clean up instead?

Kagami:
 Yeah, I get it.
 Go study.

Konata:
 All right!
 Time to get some studying done.

Konata:
 I think I'd better take a 30-minute break.
 I'm starting to lose my concentration.

Konata:
 Aw, time's up already?
 Thirty more minutes... just thirty more minutes...

Konata:
 Oh, yeah, it's almost time for Haruhi to start.
 Click!

Konata:
 Talk about cutting corners, Nagato just sat there the whole time.
 Man, that Yaoto guy is not really doing it for me anymore.
 Whoa... 
That's right, guys, let the flaming begin.

Konata:
 It's 2:00 A.M.
 I'd better stop for today.
 I'll just sleep a bit and wake up early.
 If I get up at 5:00, I'll get three hours of sleep,
 then I've got the whole morning to study.


Konata:
 After all of that I ended up watching anime and reading my manga
 all night long.

Tsukasa:
 Oh, that's just like you.

Kagami:
 That's one thing about you, Konata, you've got strange tastes
 when it comes to anime and manga.
 You only read the stuff guys like and you play those dating sims.

Konata:
 Well, yeah, it's probably 'cause my dad likes that kind of stuff.
 So go figure it's rubbed up on me.
 When I was little, I'd sit next to him and watch him read and play his games.

Kagami:
 I get the manga part, but what kind of father plays adult-oriented dating sims
 with his daughter sitting there. Ew...

Kagami:
 If both you and your dad are into that kinda stuff,
 what does your mother think about it at all?

Konata:
 Oh, my mom's been gone for a long time now.

Kagami, Tsukasa:
 Uh?!

Konata:
 Yeah, I never told you but my mom died when I was really young.

Kagami:
 I'm so sorry...

Konata:
 I guess it means I can do the household chores better than anyone,
 even you, Kagami.

Kagami:
 How can you go off on a tangent like that after you brought the mood down!

Konata:
 I bet you're a really good cook, Tsukasa?

Tsukasa:
 I don't know if I'm all that good, but I do love to cook.

Konata:
 I wonder how good Miyuki-san is at cooking?
 I bet because she's rich, she's probably awful at doing the housework.

Miyuki:
 Oh, do I know how to cook?
 Actually, I only help out around the house every now and then.
 So I'm afraid I'm not very good at chores and things.
 I'm ashamed to say it.

Konata:
 See, told ya.

Kagami:
 Yeah, but Miyuki's so good at everything else, you can't possibly compare her to any of us.
 She's just being modest when she says she's not good at something, that's all.

Konata:
 Hm, I guess you're right.

Miyuki:
 Oh, that's not true...

Konata:
 I just thought of someone else.
 How about our teacher?
 She says she lives alone, and I always got the impression that she'd be a total slob.

Kuroi:
 What are ya talking about?
 These days, anybody can get by without knowing how to cook.
 You heard of convenience stores, right?

Konata, Kagami:
 Ugh...

Kuroi:
 I'm kidding!
 I do all my chores!
 I cook and clean as good as anyone.

Kagami:
 Please don't joke when your joke doesn't sound like a joke!


Kagami:
 Ah, Tsukasa hasn't given my dictionary back yet.

Kagami:
 Tsukasa? Sorry, but can I have my dictionary back?

Tsukasa:
 I was just cleaning up 'cause I figured... I would?

Kagami:
 You too, huh?


Kagami:
 Hey, whatcha thinkin' about?

Konata:
 They want everybody who's working at the cosplay cafe to come up with
 new stuff for the summer menu.

Kagami:
 Really? They make you guys do that?
 Wait!
 You haven't stopped studying for the exams, right?

Konata:
 That's it!
 Since it's hot out, how about we have something hot and spicy
 like an ultra-spicy ramen?

Kagami:
 Ughh... How about coming up with something that you'd actually order in a cafe?

Konata:
 An ultra-spicy parfait!

Kagami:
 Do you think you could stop and think for a second before you answer a question?


Tsukasa:
 I can't stand up...

Konata:
 Could somebody tell me why our school doesn't have a swimming class?
 We have a pool, don't we?

Miyuki:
 I hate to admit it, but I'm glad we don't have a swimming class.

Konata:
 Huh? Why's that?

Miyuki:
 Remember I told you how I couldn't open my eyes underwater.
 I can't swim very far because of that.
 It's so embarrassing...!

Konata:
 Your weaknesses are your greater strength, it's so unfair!


Konata:
 That's right!
 This summer's Comp-Fest is just right around the corner!
 Oh, yeah!
 The only reason I went out and got myself a job was for Comp-Fest!
 A festival... and with it so many memories!

Kagami:
 Why'd you pull out an old reference like that one?

Konata:
 Well, when you're excited and everyone around you is getting excited,
 don't you get the feeling you make each other
 that much more excited for the festival?

Kagami:
 If you could only focus a tiny bit of that passion on your school work...

Kagami:
 I can't get to sleep...
 I guess I'll read a book, maybe that'll help.
 I just bought this.
 It'll do.

Kagami:
 Ahh... I didn't get any sleep, and it's already morning.
 And now I'm tired and ready to go to sleep. Figures.


Konata:
 Stare...

Konata:
 I know I'm supposed to turn off my cell-phone when I'm next to the priority seats,
 'cause it's got something to do with pacemakers and stuff.

Kagami:
 Mm-hmm.

Konata:
 But I don't get why we're not allowed to talk on our phones anywhere else on the train.

Kagami:
 Well, isn't it because when you do that, you're bothering everyone around you with your conversation?

Konata:
 Hmm, I guess.
 But aren't trains filled with people that talk too loud even when they're not on the phone?
 I'm talkin' both men and women.

Kagami:
 Well, yeah, I guess that's true...

Konata:
 Do you guys do your New Year's priestess thing
 at the shrine during summer too?

Kagami:
 Nah, we don't do that kind of stuff in the summer.
 You know, I still can't believe that it's already that time of year.

Konata:
 I know.
 What are you eating?
 Aren't you supposed to be on a diet?

Kagami:
 Yeah, that...
 Well, I guess with all the studying I've been doing,
 I got on the scale yesterday and I'd lost a little weight.
 So I figure why not, you know?

Konata:
 Whoa, don't tell me you gave up!


Konata:
 Good morning!

Tsukasa:
 Huh?
 Good morning, Kona-chan!

Konata:
 Hey, what's the matter, Kagami?

Kagami:
 Konata!
 It's my weight again!
 I gained it all back in, like, the blink of an eye!

Konata:
 That's 'cause you let your guard down and ate too many snacks in.

Konata:
 Hey, wasn't that a senryu?
Kagami:
I just ate a little, only a little...

Konata:
 You're making such a big deal out of it.
 You don't look any different if you gain a kilo or two...
 Why bother getting excited or freaked out about each kilogram anyway?
 Ughh... This is one of the reasons why girls are so...

Kagami:
 Hello, you're supposed to be a girl too, aren't ya?



Akira:
 Hiya, Luckies!
 Lucky Channel's back and I'm so glad to see you guys again.
 So, have all of you've been doing well?
 I'm Akira Kogami, and I'll be giving you a 120%.
 This week I'll be...

Shiraishi:
 Nyoron!
 Just kidding! I'm Minoru Shiraishi, the assistant.

Akira:
Hey!

Shiraishi:
 Huh, what?

Akira:
Don't you ever cut me off again!

Shiraishi:
 I... I'm so sorry.

Akira:
 This isn't Kids' Place, so learn how to handle yourself like a professional.
 Or maybe you don't want this job any more?

Shiraishi:
 No, no, I'm really very sorry.
 I promise you I'll do my best!

Akira:
 O.K. today we got... Tadaaan!
 Really super important news for all the Lucky Channel fans out there!
 If you picked up the November issue of Comptiq, you'll know all about Akira's Fashion Project.
 You were supposed to send me a postcard, and you did!
 A whole lot of postcards!

Shiraishi:
 Uh, you know, I think there was someone else involved in that project with you, wasn't there?

Akira:
 Thank you so much for sending in your entries.
 I am mammoth happy!

Shiraishi:
 I don't think I know that reference, is it from the 80's...?

Akira:
 Now I'm gonna single-handedly pick the one idea out of all the amazing entries you sent in.
 This will do.
 Let's see, this is from a Miss Cherry who lives in Satte City, Saitama.
 " Akira Fashion Project. "
 Yeah? "On Lucky Star, Kagami-san looks super cute in her pigtails.
 Why don't you try putting your hair in pigtails, too, Akira-san? "

Shiraishi:
 Oh ho! Pigtails, huh?

Akira:
 Mmmm... oh, yeah!
 You're right, Cherry.
 A girl loves long hair more than anything!
 And if she puts her hair in pigtails... maybe if I did that, it'd look cute, too.

Shiraishi:
 I don't know if that's a good idea.
 Your hair's kind of short and pigtails will make you...whaa!

Akira:
Yeah, well, it's not like having long hair is better or anything, right?

Shiraishi:
 Akira-sama, don't sit like that!
 They're gonna see your...
 Oh, don't move your feet!

Akira:
Long hair weighs you down. It takes forever to shampoo, you know that?
 That looks passe these days, anyway.
 You guys're always going off about how much you like the long hair, but when you think about it...

Shiraishi:
 Yeah, uh, you're not on topic, again...

Akira:
Hell, you don't know a damn thing. 

Shiraishi:
 Um, if you could just come back to... topic thing... no?

Akira:
You don't know. You don't know how much time, how much money, how much effort goes into maintaining hair...

Shiraishi:
 Are you listening?
 Hello...?

Akira:
Nobody even notices...

Aww!
 It's time to say goodbye, isn't it?
 Oh well. If you guys are wondering how I'm gonna look in pigtails, don't worry!
 Go to my website and take a peek, and don't forget my radio show.
 I hope you guys tune in, O.K.?
 Please keep sending those letters!

Shiraishi:
 Yeah, please look forward to the next episode...

Akira:
 So, what's up with the attitude?

Shiraishi:
 Uh, wha... what attitude?

Akira:
 You kept snapping at me, ugh.
 What's that?
 Did I piss you off when I corrected you or something?

Shiraishi:
 No! I didn't think they recognize " Noripi speak " from the 80's.

Akira:
 Huh?

Shiraishi:
 Uh?

Akira:
 Huh.

Shiraishi:
 Look, I'm really sorry.
 Let's just forget about the whole thing...

Akira:
 You know...

Shiraishi:
 Yes?

Akira:
 There's auditioning for Minoru Shiraishi.

Shiraishi:
 You kidding!

Akira:
 Nope.

Shiraishi:
 When'd this happen?!

Akira:
 You should try out!

Shiraishi:
 What are you talking about?!

Akira:
 Break a leg.

Shiraishi:
 But I'm the real guy!

Akira:
 Huh?
 The real what?

Shiraishi:
 What?
Tsukasa:
Kona-chan, you're amazing! You can sing anything!

Konata:
As long as it's an anime song.

Miyuki:
I think you sing wonderfully, and in different voices too.

Konata:
It's the number one rule that when you sing a song from anime,
 you have to do it exactly like the original singer!

Tsukasa:
Really?

Kagami:
All right, my turn now!

Tsukasa:
What are you gonna sing, Sis?

 Miyuki:
Her title came up a little while ago.
 But I don't know the song...

 Kagami:
Uh! Miyuki, you don't know this song!?

 Miyuki:
No...

Konata:
Practice what you preach, right Kagami?


 Tsukasa:
Oh, I heard this one before!

 Kagami:
Well, yeah, we've been watching the show together.

 Tsukasa:
Oh, I forgot.

 Konata:
I like the movie better than the series.

 Kagami:
Yeah, whatever, old man.


 Konata:
Hey, she's good.

 Tsukasa:
Yeah, out of all my sisters, she's the best.


Narration:
On the next episode of Lucky Star...

Miyuki:
Hello, it's Miyuki.
 Did you know that Golden Week is a term the motion picture industry came up with?
 Apparently, around this time, there's an increase in movie-goers.
 Next time "The Famous Shooter ".

 Narration:
 Look forward to it.
