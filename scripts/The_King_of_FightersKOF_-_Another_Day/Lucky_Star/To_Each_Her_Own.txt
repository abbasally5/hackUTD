  Konata:
 Hey, Kagami, do you like those chocolate wafer thingies?

Kagami:
 Sure, I do, why?

Konata:


Kagami:
 Oh, thank you.

Tsukasa:
 Wow.

Yutaka:
 I love these things!

Konata:


Kagami:
 Whoa...

Konata:


Kagami:
 Well, hang on, what's with you and all the wafers?

Konata:


Kagami:

Konata:
 Hmm... A fox... And you're... a squirrel... a dog?

Yutaka, Kagami:
 Huh?

Kagami:
 Okay, now, what are you talking about?

Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:

Tsukasa:


Konata:
 Yui-neisan's always running around so she'd be a leopard.

Yutaka:


Tsukasa:


Miyuki:
 Fumoffu!

Konata:


Kagami:
 Ugh... You're like a pervy old man.

Kagami:

Miyuki:
 Oh, that sounds interesting.

Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:


Miyuki:
 They are noble professions.

Kagami:


Konata:

Kagami:
 Uh, okay, games and manga, we always end up here.

Kagami:


Tsukasa:
 Hehe, that sounds very cute though.

Kagami:
 Yeah, Tsukasa, the truth is, I was talking about you.

Tsukasa:
 Uh? Really? Are you sure?

Kagami:


Konata:

Tsukasa:
 No, I'm not an airhead!

Miyuki:
 It seems you may be right about that.

Konata:
 Oh, Miyuki-san, you've just proven my point.

Miyuki:
 What? Do I have something on my face?

Konata:


Miyuki:
 It's way under 20/200.

Konata:


Miyuki:


Konata:
 Oh...

Miyuki:


Konata:
 Wow, you sure know a lot, don't you?

Miyuki:
 Well, those are just a few of the many options out there.

Konata:


Miyuki:


Konata:
 Oh, yeah. Why not?

Miyuki:
 I'm sorry, I don't know why.

Konata:


Miyuki:


Konata:


Miyuki:


Konata:
 Wow, easy now, girl.

Miyuki:
 My eyes are more tired now than before.

Konata:
 I hope it didn't make your vision worse.

Tsukasa:
 Hey, Kona-chan, what does "moe" mean?

Konata:


Tsukasa:
 Uh...

Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:



TV:
We're gonna check out doggies from around the world.
Daffundah!

Tsukasa:


Tadao:
 Hm?

Kagami:


Tsukasa:


Kagami:



Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:
 Okay, what is it?

Kagami:


Konata:
 No, I haven't reached that level yet.

Kagami:
 Well, go on, hurry up, keep reading.

Konata:

Tsukasa:
 You think so?

Kuroi:


Konata:


Kuroi:
 The heck are you talking about?

Konata:


Kuroi:


Konata:
 Hmm...

Kuroi:


Konata:
 I've got experience, but I don't really like it that much.

Kuroi:


Konata:


Kuroi:


Konata:
 It comes down to a power attack after all!


kick ~ to the curb : ～をお払い箱にする

Konata:
 Sorry to keep you waiting!

Tsukasa:
 Kona-chan's stuck as she didn't bring an umbrella today.

Kagami:
 You could at least watch the forecasts.

Konata:


Tsukasa:


Konata:
 'Cause they don't have to worry about their bra showing through.

Tsukasa:
 You're so smart.

Kagami:


Konata:
 Could either of you hook a girl up with an umbrella.

Kagami:


Konata:
 Uh, you guys are the best!

Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:
 With an attitude like that, go figure, you'd forget.


Konata:
 Hm?

Ichiko:
Wait up, Suzume! I said wait!

Konata:


Kagami:
 Yeah, I know, you feel sorta immature, wearing stuff like that.

Konata:


Kagami:
 Like I would know.



Kagami:


Konata:


Tsukasa:


Konata:


Tsukasa:
 Oh, I see...

Konata:
 It's way more economical.

Kagami:


Konata:
 You really need to stop sweating the small stuff, Kagamin.

Tsukasa:
 Oh, a text.

Tsukasa:


Konata:


Tsukasa:


Konata:


Konata:
 Mm-hmm..

Tsukasa:
 Huh?

Konata:
 How long have you had your cell phone anyway?

Tsukasa:
 For about a year now.

Konata:
 And when do you usually replace it with a new one?

Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:
 Why are you spazing out again?

Konata:


Kagami:


Tsukasa:


Kagami:


Tsukasa:
 Hehehe...

Kagami:
 Here. And try not to forget your book next time, okay?

Tsukasa:
 'Kay. I'll bring it back later today.

Misao:


Kagami:


Misao:


Kagami:
 Huh, she does have a point there.

Misao:
 Mm-hm!

Kagami:


Misao:
 Hey, Hiiragi, what time is it?

Kagami:


Misao:


Kagami:



Tadao:


Tsukasa:
 O-kay...

Kagami:
 Mm-hm.

Tsukasa:


Kagami:
 Yeah, I kinda figured you'd have a little problem with that.
Konata:

Boy:
Yeah, what's up?

Konata:


Boy:
Yeah, sure...
Hey, Kobayakawa! Izumi-sempai, the senior, wants to see you!

Yutaka:
 Hey, oneichan, what's up?

Konata:


Yutaka:
 I wish I was as tall as you, Iwasaki-san.

Minami:
 Huh?

Yutaka:
 I wonder why there's so much of a difference.

Minami:


Yutaka:


Minami:

Hiyori:
Hey guys, it's raining, so we're gonna be playing
dodge-ball in the gym today for PE.
I always pictured you as being the last girl
standing on the court, Iwasaki-san.
I think you look really tough.

Yutaka:


Hiyori:
Hm, they both survive the game, but for very different reasons.
I'd be awful if I hit Kobayakawa-san though.

Yutaka:


Minami:
 Hm.

Hiyori:
We got to be on the same team, though.

Yutaka:
 Mm-hm.

Hiyori:
Iwasaki-san seems like she's really good at sports.
I bet she's ruthless out there.

Yutaka:
 Oh...

Minami:
 ...

Yutaka:


Minami:
 I'm glad...

Yutaka:
 Iwasaki-san's such a good person.

Hiyori:
Ready to pound these guys, Kobayakawa-san?

Yutaka:
 Mm-hm.

Hiyori:
And are you okay with her trying to nail you?

Minami:
 Mm-hm.

Hiyori:
Yeah, I bet you're... Ah...
I mean let's have a good game, 'kay?

Minami, Yutaka:
 Hm?

Hiyori:
Oh, blown by the girl who works in the nurse's office...

Minami:
 Are you okay?

Hiyori:
You are pretty amazing out there, Iwasaki-san.
You pop everybody you aim for, don't you?

Minami:
 Oh, you think so?

Hiyori:
You've got great reflexes and targeting skills.

Minami:
 Whatever...

Hiyori:
Ah...
What happened?
Is she upset because I was making a fuss over her?

Yutaka:


Hiyori:
Yeah, well, I guess it's okay then.
I can't really tell with her.

Yutaka:

Yutaka:
 Have you gone on any cool trips since you came to Japan?

Patricia:


Minami:
 Sacred places?

Patricia:


Yutaka:
 Did you go to Kamakura, Kyoto, and Nara?

Patricia:


Yutaka, Minami:
 Huh?

Patricia:


Yutaka:
 You mean, like Tokyo Tower and Asakusa?

Patricia:


Yutaka:
 Okay...


Yutaka:
 Ah!

Minami:
 Are you okay?

Yutaka:
 Yeah, I just got some dust in my eye, is all.

Minami:
 Can I see?

Yutaka:
 Uh...

Minami:
 Are you sure you're gonna be all right.

Yutaka:
 Yeah, I'm okay.

Hiyori:
Hmm...

Patricia:
 Look at them, don't they look awesome like that?

Hiyori:
Oh, how can I stare at my friends like that.
God, I'm such a pervert.


Yutaka, Minami, Patricia:
 Hello!

Hiyori:
Hi, come on in!
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go get some drinks.

Yutaka, Minami, Patricia:
 Huh?

Yutaka:
 She's got a lot of books!

Hiyori:
I sure hope you guys are okay with...
Argh!

Patricia:
 Wow, Hiyorin, I didn't know you are into stuff like this.

Hiyori:
Kill me now.
Just please kill me now.
Hurry, do it fast!

Patricia:
 I think these are her newest sketches.

Hiyori:
Oh, my god!

Patricia:
 Oh, look at how much she's improved!

Yutaka:
 You're right. She's really good.

Minami:
 Mmm.

Yutaka:
 I can't believe how much this looks like Iwasaki-san.

Hiyori:
Yeah...

Patricia:
 Oh! It's Takarazuka!

Hiyori:
Oh!

Yutaka:


Hiyori:
Mm-hm...

Yutaka:


Hiyori:
Oh, god!
I have to stop drawing my friends like this!
I'm such a pervert.
Patricia:
 Hey, Tamura-san, would you like to go to Otome Road?

Hiyori:
Yeah, I was thinking about going.

Yutaka:
 What's Otome Road? Is it near here?

Patricia:
 You never heard of Otome Road?!

Yutaka:
 No.

Minami:
 I haven't either.

Patricia:
 Oh, Yare-Yare Desu.

Hiyori: ?
It's called Otome Road, huh?

Patricia:


Yutaka:
 Fujoshi?

Patricia:
 It's written as "rotten girl", but read as "spoiled lady".

Yutaka:
 Rotten girl?

Hiyori:
Yeah, now that you mention it, they are kind of rotten...


Kagami:
 Huh...

Misao:


Kagami:
 I didn't say anything, I'm just sitting here.


Misao:
 No... not my meatball...

Kagami:
 What happened to the three-second rule?

Misao:

Akira:
Hiya, luckies!
 Hi, we are back again with another edition of your favorite show.

 And all of you should know who I am by now, aha!
 I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami!
 Whew! And this is...

Minoru:
Hi, guys, I'm the one who's trying super hard to be
the best assistant Akira-sama's ever had.
I'm Minoru Shiraishi.

Akira:
 Anyway, here's the theme for today.
 We are introducing all the new characters appearing on the show.
 So let's get the thing started with a big fat bang.
 You feel me?

Minoru:
A big fat bang!
Akira:
 Oh-ho!
Minoru:
For starters, we've got Konata-san's cousin, Miss Yutaka Kobayakawa.
Her classmates are Miss Minami Iwasaki, Miss Hiyori Tamura and
Miss Patricia Martin.
Next up, we have Kagami-san's class mates, Miss Misao Kusakabe
and Miss Ayano Minegishi.
The cast is filled out quite nicely, don't you think?
I'm sure this staff's all news to most of you guys.
These ladies've been s part of the opening credit
since the very beginning of the...

Akira:
 That's blocking my shot.
 Hey, move it!

Minoru:
Ugh!

Akira:

 It's already episode eighteen!
 
Minoru:
Actually you made an appearance in today's episode, Akira-sama.
Akira:
Huh?

Akira:
 Huh?

Minoru:
You know, that reminds me of something.
I had a chance to speak to Anizawa-san after last week's show
and he told me something interesting.
He said there's one thing an actor needs more than anything
and that's presence.
Even though you were only in the show for a split second,
when you appeared, it was like "Wow, that was Akira Kogami. Didn't she.."

Akira:
 Whatever.

Akira:
 Hey!

Minoru:
Yes, sorry.

Akira:
 I said, "Hey."

Minoru:
No, everything's okay.
No way, is it time to say good-by already? Bummer!
We really wanna know what you guys think about the show,
so please please, please, keep your comments coming, okay?

Akira:
 Hey, stop it!

Minoru:
You can either e-mail us or call into our radio show, well, by-nee.

Akira:
 Turn it off!


Minoru:
Thanks, guys.

Akira:
Texting?

Minoru:
What? I, I'm sorry?

Akira:
You were texting.
 
Minoru:
No! Well, not really.

Akira:
 Who you were texting?

Minoru:
My, er, parents.

Akira:
 Why?
 
Minoru:
They want me to come home and visit, so..

Akira:
What did you tell them?

Minoru:
Well, you know.

Akira:
 I don't!

Minoru:
Wait, no, I...
Patricia:
 On the next episode of Lucky Star.

Hiyori:
 I'm Hiyori.

Patricia:
I'm Patricia.

Hiyori:
Hey, Patty, you like your job?

Patricia:
Yeah, it's awesome.

Hiyori:


Patricia:
 Well, actually I don't deal with first timers.

Hiyori:
Oh, really?

Patricia:
 I only serve the regular customers.
 You know the ones who drop serious cash.
 Yeah, that's the café's policy.

Hiyori:
 Wow, that's harsh.

Hiyori:
 Next time, "There is Substance in 2-D".

Patricia:
Look forward to it.
