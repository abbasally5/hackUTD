  Kagami:
 Do any of you guys know what the heck this line is for?

Tsukasa:
 Yuki-chan, do you know?

Miyuki:
 No, I don't.

Konata:
 Well, guys...

Konata:
 Urh...

Kagami:
 I should've known...

Konata:
 Uh?

Kagami:
 And before you get your hopes up, I didn't win either.

Konata:
 Urgh...

Miyuki:

Tsukasa:
 I did, too!

Konata:
 You are the best friends I ever had!

Kagami:

Konata:
 Oh, man, I can't see anything... Oh...

Kagami:
 Come on.

Konata:
 Oh...


Tsukasa:
 That was amazing!

Miyuki:
 I was so impressed!

Tsukasa:
 Did you guys see the MC, I thought he was super cute!

Kagami:
 Eh? You're kidding.

Tsukasa:
 You didn't think so?

Kagami:
 Not really my type.

Kagami:


Konata:
 Uh? Uh-huh...

Kagami:


Konata:

Kagami:
 What are you doing?

Konata:
 Huh?

Kagami:
 Come on, let's go.

Konata:
 Man, you picked the weirdest things to get all proactive about.

Kagami:


Tsukasa:


Konata:


Kagami:
 Mm... Actually...

Konata:
 Hm?

Kagami:
 I sorta gave him too much food and now he's like this big.

Konata:

Kagami:
 I guess I pampered the little guy too much.

Konata:


Kagami:

Konata:

Kagami:
 What are you saying?!

Konata:

Kagami:
 Here you go with another hard-core reference.

Kagami:
 Maybe I should put him on a little diet.

Konata:

Kagami:
 What? Urgh!

Tsukasa:
 It's getting pretty cold, isn't it?

Kagami:
 I guess we'll head home.

Konata:


Tsukasa:
 Your butt gets so cold while you're sitting down, too.

Miyuki:


Tsukasa:
 Wow, if this was November or December, I'd be piling on the layers.

Kagami:
 Yeah. And in March and April, you never seem to have enough layers on.

Konata:

Miyuki:

Konata:
 Hey, Kagami doesn't look like she is cold.

Kagami:
 Huh?

Konata:
 So she must have come prepared... wearing wool undies, huh.

Kagami:
 I am not!

Kagami:


Tsukasa:
 I wonder what's wrong with her.

Sojiro:


Konata:
 That sucks, Dad.

Sojiro:
 I guess I'm always home anyway.

Konata:


Sojiro:
 Oh, really?

Sojiro:

Sojiro:


Konata:


Sojiro:

Konata:
 'Kay, have fun, Dad.

Sojiro:
 You wanna go?

Konata:


Sojiro:



Newscaster:
Onto a next story.
Around 11 o'clock last night, a woman barged into a convenience store
and attempted to walk out with the day's earnings.
However, an employee...

Konata:
 Hey, Yu-chan...

Yutaka:
 Uh-huh?

Konata:


Yutaka:
 Huh, yeah, I guess you're right.

Yui:
 Freeze!

Sojiro:
 Why, me?

Konata:
 Wow!

Kagami:


Konata:
 And I finished all of my homework by myself!

Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:

Konata:
 Hm? Izumi residence.

Kuroi:

Konata:
 Oh, hi, ma'am.

Kuroi:


Konata:
 What?!

Kuroi:


Konata:
 She must be so bored calling this late.

Konata:
 Um, ma'am?

Kuroi:
 Yeah, what's up?

Konata:
 The other day, Miyuki-san said...

Miyuki:


Konata:

Kuroi:


Konata:
 Um, ma'am, April fools...

Kagami:


Tsukasa:
 Ehehe...

Kagami:
 You have a chance to trick anyone with a lie today?

Tsukasa:
 Um, yeah, I did.

Kagami:


Tsukasa:


Kagami:


Tsukasa:
 So, what kinda lie did Kona-chan tell?

Kagami:


Tsukasa:


Kagami:
 Knowing her, I'm positive she hasn't finished it.

Tsukasa:
 Oh, okay.

Kagami:


Tsukasa:
 Ah... Well I... Ehehe....
Konata:
Sojiro:
 Hey, Konata, you got a minute?

Konata:
 Uh-huh.

Sojiro:


Konata:
 Yeah, unique.

Sojiro:


Konata:
 Okay.

Sojiro:


Konata:
 Sure, why not?

Sojiro:


Konata:
 Oh, yeah, so what's my new mom gonna be like?

Sojiro:


Konata:
 Hm-hmm.
TV:
Next question, what is the modest and polite form
of the word "iku"?

Matsuri:
 That's an easy one, it's "ukagau".

Tsukasa:
 Yeah, you're right, it's definitely "ukagau".

Miki:
 I'm with you girls on that one.

Inori:
 Oh, come on, of course it is.

Tadao:
 Uh-huh.

TV:
And the answer is "mairu"!

Everyone:
Ah!

Matsuri:

Tsukasa:
 I guess it is, isn't it?

Miki:
 I can't believe I thought without one...

Kagami:


TV:
The first multiple-choice question is:
Which of the following prefectures do not face towards the ocean?
Is it A: Ibaraki.
Or is it B: Tochigi.
Or is it C: Kyoto.

Matsuri:
 It's B.

Tsukasa:
 B, right?

Miki:
 Definitely B.

Tadao:
 Uh-huh.

Inori:
 This one's way too easy.

TV:
And the answer is B!

TV:
Next question.
The most famous problem in the history of mathematics was finally proven
by Professor Wiles of Princeton University, in 1994.
Which of the following three choices is the name of that theorem?
Is it A: Pythagorean theorem?
Or is it B: Taylor's theorem?
Or C: Fermat's last theorem?

Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:


Tsukasa:
 Hm, maybe she's got a swimming pool.

Konata:
 Maybe she's got security guards all around the perimeter.

Kagami:
 Oh, come one, that's silly.

Konata:
 Oh, I bet she's got a pet or something like that!

Tsukasa:


Konata:


Kagami:
 Well, the dog's a possibility.

Konata:
 So, that's pretty much how that conversation went.

Miyuki:


Konata:
 Oh...

Konata:


Yutaka:


Miyuki:


Konata, Miyuki:
 It really is a small world, don't you think?

Tsukasa:
 I'm super sleepy today...

Kagami:


Konata:
 Uh... uh...

Kagami:
 Got in the habit of sleeping in too, huh?

Konata:


Kagami:

Konata:
 Look! We're in the same class again!

Tsukasa:
 Yeah, you're right! Isn't that awesome?

Miyuki:
 Good morning.

Tsukasa:
 Hi, Yuki-chan, good morning.

Konata:


Miyuki:
 Really? Oh, there I am. Fantastic!

Tsukasa:
 I hope we all have a great year together.

Konata:
 I second that.

Yutaka:
 Wow! Look, we're in the same class!

Minami:
 Uh-huh.

Yutaka:
 Oh, um, I hope the two of us have a good year together.

Minami:
 So do I.

Yutaka:
 Ahaha...

Kagami:
 .....

Konata:
 Hey, Kagami's in a different class again.

Kagami:


Tsukasa:
 But Sis...

Miyuki:
 I think it's a shame.

Kagami:


Konata:
 You read my mind.

Kagami:


Konata
 See ya.

Tsukasa:
 Sis, see you later.

Kagami:
 Huh...

Misao:


Ayano:
 Let's have another good one.

Kagami:
 Ah... Yeah, sure.

Misao:


Ayano:
 Oh, be nice.

Misao:
 What are we, the background scenery or something?

Konata:


Miyuki:


Konata:
 in the same class.

Miyuki:
 It's more compelling.

Konata:


Miyuki:
 You do have a point.

Kagami:


Miyuki:
 It's nothing like that.

Tsukasa:
 That was the bell, but our teacher's not here yet.

Konata:
 I know, I wonder what's up?

Kuroi:


Konata:
 Just barely.

Kuroi:


Minoru:
 Yo-you gotta be kidding me!

Kuroi:


Miyuki:
 Oh, yes, ma'am.

Konata:


Miyuki:


Tsukasa:
 Teachers always decide that stuff at the beginning of the year.

Miyuki:


Konata:


Kuroi:
 I heard that!

Konata:
 Oh.

Tsukasa:

Miyuki:


Konata:


Kagami:
 That totally explains it!

Tsukasa, Konata:
 Hm?

Kagami:


Tsukasa, Konata:
 Ah!

Kuroi:
 I heard that, honey.
Minami:
 I'm Iwasaki... Hi there.

Boy1:
Oh, wow, that girl's totally cute.

Boy2:
I was in the same class as her in junior high.
She doesn't talk, man. All she does is read books.
She's kinda creepy.

Yutaka:


Teacher:
Next.

Yutaka:
 Oh, I'm coming!

Yutaka:


Yutaka:


Student:
She skipped grades?

Student:
Oh, man, she's the tiniest...

Yutaka:


Teacher:
Okay, how about we figure out the class duties next?
Does anybody wanna volunteer for class rep?
'Course not, who would...

Boy2
Iwasaki, you were the rep in junior high,
why don't you volunteer?

Teacher:
Is that true, Iwasaki?
You wanna be class rep?

Minami:


Teacher:
Hm... I would have like someone with experience.

Yutaka:


Minami:
 The nurse's office.

Yutaka:
 Oh, I'd like to be the class rep, sir!

Yutaka:
 She really is nice!
Konata:


Konata:


Kagami:

Yutaka:
 Oneichan!

Konata:
 Hey, Yu-chan, haven't seen you all day!

Yutaka:
 Yeah, I know, I know, not since this morning.

Minami, Konata:
 Uh...

Yutaka:


Konata:
 Oh, right. Awesome, nice to meet ya!

Minami:
 Nice to meet you.

Yutaka:


Konata:


Yutaka:
 Ah! But she didn't and now she is here, so it's okay!

Konata:
 Yeah, anyway, Yu-chan, where were you guys headed?

Yutaka:


Konata:
 Oh, I hear that.

Yutaka:
 Oh, I know you could show us where it is!

Konata:


Yutaka:
 Hm?

Konata:
 Where was the nurse's office again?

Yutaka:
 Uh...

Konata:
 I don't really know 'cause I never had to go there.

Kagami:


Konata:
 I can't help if I have been usually healthy the last two years.

Kagami:
 You went and had your physical exams there.

Tsukasa:
 Actually, I don't think I've ever been inside the art room.

Miyuki:


Konata:
 And I just found out a while ago that we have a tea room here.

Kagami:


Tsukasa:
 Hate to say it, but I don't go to the study hall that much.

Konata:
 I always go to the study hall.

Kagami:
 No... way.

Konata:


Everyone:
Huh...

Konata:


Tsukasa:


Kagami:
 Good point.

Miyuki:


Everyone:
Huh...

Konata:
 And Kagami was in a different class the whole time.

Kagami:
 Thanks for reminding me, buzz-kill.
Kuroi:


Konata:
 Ah, Potemkin?!

Kuroi:
 What the heck were you dreaming about?

Konata:


Kuroi:
 Oh?

Konata:
 Yeah, ma'am, but the monster called "sleepiness" just kept coming!

Kuroi:
 Oh, yeah...

Konata:


Kuroi:


Konata:


Miyuki:


Konata:
 Huh?

Miyuki:
 In fact, until last year, I'd always be in bed by 10.

Konata:
 No way! That's impossible. She's like a machine!


Tsukasa:
 Hm? Hmm?

Konata:


Tsukasa:
 I can't tell either.

Konata:


Tsukasa:
 Um...

Kuroi:
 They're equations.

Konata:


Kuroi:


Konata:
 Ehe...

Konata:
 Okay!


Yutaka:
 Oneichan, what are you doing up so late?

Konata:
 Huh?

Konata:


Kuroi:

Akira:

Minoru:
And I am the assistant, Minoru Shiraishi.

Akira:

Minoru:
That would be correct.

Akira:
 So you're done after today's episode, huh?

Minoru:
Ah ah...

Akira:
 Bye-nee.

Minoru:
Huh!?

Akira:

Minoru:
Wait! Can we talk about this!?

Akira:


Minoru:
Oh yeah, you got me. Oh yeah, funny, yeah...

Akira:

Minoru:
I, I don't think I know what you're talking about, ha-ha...

Akira:
So when the hell am I gonna get my own concert, huh?

Minoru:
Oh... I don't know.

Akira:


Minoru:
Sure, I'll check on it right now.
Look, the eastern skies... are burning red.

Akira:
 Hurry, hurry... Hurry up!

Minoru:
A circle? It's on?
The producer said it's okay?
On the next episode!? Yes, I understand!
Akira Kogami's concert is happening on the next Lucky Channel!

Akira:

Minoru:
They twisted a couple of arms and got a place.
And bend.

Akira:

Minoru:
I'm really looking forward to hearing you sing, Akira-sama.

Akira:


Minoru:
Oh, and I can host the show for you.
People seem to think I'm an okay MC, so don't you worry.

Akira:


Akira, Minoru:
We'll see guys next week.
Bye-nee.

Akira:
 Oh yeah, are you even gonna be here next time?

Minoru:
I'm a lieutenant.

Akira:
 Huh?

Narration:
On the next episode of Lucky Star.

Everyone:
Look forward to it.
