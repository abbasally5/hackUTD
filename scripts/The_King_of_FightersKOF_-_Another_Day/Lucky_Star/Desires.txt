Tsukasa:


Yui:
 I'm here to hang out!

Konata:
 Hey, come on in, oneisan.

Yui:
 What are you playing there?

Konata:
 It's a dating sim that just came out.

Yui:

Konata:


Yui:

Konata:
 Huh...

Yui:


Konata:

Miyuki:


Receptionist:
Mr. Ando? Mr. Shigeo Ando?

Ando:
Hmm.

Receptionist:
Miss Takara? Miss Miyuki Takara?

Receptionist:
Miss Takara? Is there a Miss Takara here?

Receptionist:
Okay, is Miss Mariko Nishiyama here?

Miyuki:


Miyuki:
 I need to pay more attention to my surroundings.

Announcement:
Coming up is Kamata, our last stop.

Miyuki:
 Huh? Oh, no! It happened again! Where am I?
Kagami:


Konata:
 Really...

Tsukasa:

Kagami:


Konata:
 It's gotta suck to be on the receiving end of all of those text though.

Kagami:

Konata:
 Yeah, I know what you mean, some people can be so childish sometimes.

Kagami:

Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:

Konata:
 Might as well be hieroglyphics.

Kagami:
 Hm? Huh, looks like she got used to doing it.

That's true, but I like the guy with the afro better.
Kagami:
 Hm?

Really? But he's not really playing that instrument, is he?
Kagami:
 Urgh?

Yeah, maybe so.
Kagami:

I see.
Kagami:

Yeah.
Kagami:
 Hmmm.

Kagami:
 Okay...

Tsukasa:
 Oh, Jeez...

Kagami:


Tadao:

Kagami:
 Hm, sure.

Tadao:


Tsukasa:
 For real?!

Tsukasa:


Kagami:


Tsukasa:

Miyuki:
 There just aren't words to describe that horrid stench.

Kagami:

Tsukasa:

Konata:

Kagami:

Konata:

Kagami:
 Not really. You just don't do that.

Konata:

 No, it isn't a guy!


Kagami:

Konata:
 Hello, Kagami.

Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:
 It's pointless to have a cell if you never know anyone's calling.

Konata:
 Where the heck is that thing anyway?

Kagami:

Konata:
 Wait, hang on, Dad's calling me.

Sojiro:
 Come on, what's the deal? Hurry up!

Konata:

Sojiro:
 You've been on the phone forever, come on!

Konata:


Konata:
 Dad just chewed me up for being on the phone too long.

Kagami:


Konata:
 Nah, we're just in the middle of playing a cool fighting game, is all.

Kagami:

Konata:

Kagami:


Anizawa:


Ramika, Guy1, Guy2:
 Yeah!

Guy1:
Welcome to the store!

Guy2:
We've got the Haruhi volume 5 DVD in stock!

Ramika:


Guy1:
So you, one more stuff, we got stuff coming in all the time!

Anizawa:

Konata:


Anizawa:

Kagami:


Tsukasa:
 Cool!

Kagami:


Konata:
 Huh?

Kagami:
 I'd just like to see where you live.

Konata:

Kagami:
 Oh, that makes sense.

Konata:

Kagami:

Kagami:
 I'm kinda looking forward to seeing what Konata's house is like.

Kagami:
 Hey!

Konata:
 Hi, guys, come on in!

Kagami:


Sojiro:


Kagami, Tsukasa:
 Uh...

Kagami:

Konata:
 Here it is!

Tsukasa:
 Wow, look at Kona-chan's room!

Kagami:
 I gotta hand it to ya, your room is amazing.

Tsukasa:
 Oh, she's so cute!

Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:
 Uh... you guys share it?

Kagami:
 Didn't you say that your dad was a writer or something like that?

Konata:
 Yup.

Kagami:


Konata:

Kagami:
 Oh, really?

Konata:
 Yup.

Kagami:


Konata:
wanna write about it and live it too.

Kagami:



Konata:

Kagami:
 Yeah?

Konata:
 So, I'm all, "You acting like an ass!", just to see what he'd do.

Kagami:

Konata:


Kagami:
 Yeah... I'm not sure about that either.

Konata:

Kagami:
 Whatever... You totally lost me.

Kagami:
 Hah...

Konata:
 How about we take a little break?

Man:
It's HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRE!

Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:

Kagami, Tsukasa:
 Aw!

Kagami:
 Wow, is that really Japanese?

Konata:

Tsukasa:

Konata:

Tsukasa:
 Uh-huh.

Tsukasa, Kagami:
 Hm?

Everyone:
 Thank you for the food!

Kagami:
 Hm!

Tsukasa:
 Yummy!

Kagami:


Konata:


Kagami:
 I don't need your advice.

Sojiro:


Tsukasa, Kagami:
 Hmm?

Konata:


Kagami:
 That's... Wow...


Tsukasa:
 Doesn't it feel like evenings are getting colder?

Konata:

Tsukasa:
 Look, a shooting star!

Konata:
 Huh?

Tsukasa:
 Darn, tried but I couldn't make my wish three times.

Konata:

Tsukasa:


Konata:
 You'll always be a dreamer, Tsukasa.

Kagami:
 Too bad, stuff like that's impossible when you start to think about it.

Konata, Tsukasa:
 Uh...

Kagami:


Konata:
 This one has absolutely no dreams whatsoever.
Konata:


Kagami:

Konata:

Tsukasa:

Konata:


Tsukasa:

Konata:

Tsukasa:
 Wow, you're so cute, Kona-chan!

Kagami:

Konata:
 Oh, no, that's my mom.

Kagami:
 She's a kid... I mean it's so young!

Konata:
 Don't we look alike?

Kagami:
 Yeah, like jailbait.

Konata:
 Every time I look at Dad, I just can't help thinking.

Kagami:
 What?

Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:

Kagami:

Konata:

Kagami:

Konata:

Kagami:
 Even with your parents, you're brutal.

Konata:

Kagami:
 Uh-huh...

Konata:


Kagami:

Tsukasa:
 It's too bad Yuki-chan couldn't come over tonight.

Kagami:
 Yeah, she had stuff to do though.

Tsukasa:
 I know! I'll text Yuki-chan, that way she won't be left out!

Kagami:
 Maybe you shouldn't bug her, Miyuki is probably busy doing something.

Tsukasa:

Konata:
 Don't you sit there, Kagamin! Do something!

Kagami:

Tsukasa:
 No, wait!

Tsukasa:
 Oh, remember the shooting star?

Konata:
 Yeah.

Tsukasa:
 Maybe if I make shorter wishes, I can get them to come true.

Konata:
 I don't know about that.

Kagami:

Tsukasa:
 I'm trying to figure out if there's a way to say my wishes faster...

Kagami:
 Stop running away from reality, hurry up and finish it.
Tsukasa:

Miyuki:
 Sure, I'd be glad to.

Konata:

Tsukasa:


Konata:


Tsukasa:

Konata:

Tsukasa:


Konata:


Tsukasa:
 That's not exactly what I meant either...

Konata:
 Right, from this day forward, Tsukasa, I'm calling you Hii-chan.

Tsukasa:
 Huh?

Konata:
 What? What's wrong? What do you mean, huh?

Tsukasa:
 It's just that it's kinda weird, you know, picking your nickname and all.

Konata:
 Then, how about that?

Shiraishi:
 That?

Tsukasa:
 Um... I guess it doesn't matter.

Konata:

Shiraishi:
 Shiraishi!

Konata:


Kagami:


Konata:
 Okay, then, what do you want me to call you?

Kagami:
 Isn't Kagami good enough?

Konata:


Kagami:

Konata:
 Urgh...

Konata:
 Hey, Kagami-sama!

Kagami:


Konata:

Konata:
 Sorry for the wait, Kagami-sama!

Kagami:
 Urgh...

Konata:
 What's wrong, Kagami-sama?

Kagami:

Akira:
 Hiya, luckies.
 Whoa! Isn't this great?

 I'm Akira Kogami, your navigator.

Minoru:
Hello, I’m her assistant, Minoru Shiraishi.

Akira:
 How about we get down to business by introducing the forth character?
 It's Kagami Hiiragi.

Minoru:
In the show she is the one who plays the rational character
and keeps things on track.

Akira:
 So basically she is a tsundere type.
 Yeah, right, I got it.
 Tsundere, talk about a shallow character.

Minoru:
On the contrary.

Akira:
 Hum?

Minoru:
Let’s not jump to the conclusions by categorizing Kagami-san
as a mere tsundere.

Akira:
 Huh... What is she then?

Minoru:
Before we get into that we must ask ourselves,
“Do we truly grasp the concept of tsundere?”
Seen in this day and age, it’s a sad fact that
as the term tsundere becomes a part of the main stream,
its true meaning gets lost in the process. 
First, we must trace its origins, the term tsundere dates back to the year 2002
where it was first used on the Internet, it meant
a hostile person who becomes affectionate.
In other words it was supposed to describe
how a character’s personality changed over time.

Akira:
 Yeah, whatever.

Minoru:
These days, however, tsundere is used to describe a character’s dual nature.
For example, a girl who’s cold on the outside but loving on the inside
would fit the current definition of the term.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.
I declare that this is all a huge mistake.
We must give the people back the true definition of tsundere.
Sound the warning bells.
Rise up and be counted, you illiterate masses.
Arise!

Akira:
 You were going pretty good there, Sebastian.

Minoru:
Who’s that?

Akira:
 So Kagami isn’t a tsundere.
 What is she?

Minoru:
Who's Sebastian?

Akira:
(scratch, scratch)


Minoru:
What?
Oh, I’m sure there’s something had there that would work.
Maybe cool-dere. No, that’s not it.
Deretsun?

Akira:
 You really are an idiot.
 Did you know that?
 Isn’t tsundere good enough?

Minoru:
No, it isn’t.
That’s what I’ve been saying!
Oh! How about we have our viewers think of a new term
that could replace tsundere.
Now, that’s what I call a good idea.

Akira:
 Coward!

Minoru:
Listen up!
This goes out to everyone watching right now.
I want you to come up with a new term that would describe a character
like Kagami.
And together we’ll rewrite the common facts of modern day speech.
We’ll call it the great tsundere debate.
For more info, please check out our radio show, or log on to our site.
We are counting on your ideas.

Akira:
 Hum? So are we done now?
 Bad freaking time.
 Lots and lots and lots and lots.
 Bye-nee.

Minoru:
Bye-nee.
Fast forward.


Minoru:
Whoa! I talked up a storm today.
That was the best show ever.
Aa.. Akira-sama, what’s wrong?

Akira:
 Happy now?

Minoru:
Oh, yeah! I mean I got a lot of lines today.
I think I did a good job.

Akira:

 
Minoru:
Huh? Oh! Aah..

Akira:
 Yeah, we're gonna be taking about your future with the show.
 
Minoru:
Hold on a second.
Wait! What’s that suppose to mean?

Akira:
 Huh... I don’t know if telling you is gonna help.
 I mean if I have to tell you, you already don’t get it.
 You still got that part time gig at Coco*ch, don’t you? Yeah?

Minoru:
Yeah, like during the day I do. But It’s not like
I’m getting rich working there.

Akira:
 And Korean barbecue?


 Wait. No, that doesn’t matter. Just stop it.
 That’s all private stuff!
Kagami:

Konata:
What do you think about this song, Tsukasa?

Tsukasa:
 Maybe.
 What do you think, Yuki-chan?

Miyuki:
 Yes, I know it.

Konata:
 Then, how about you guys sing it next?

Tsukasa:
Thanks for finding it.

Miyuki:
 Yes, thank you.

Konata:

Kagami:
 Did you guys decide on a song?

Tsukasa:
Yeah!
 Hey, wasn’t that song popular back when we were in kindergarten?

Konata:
 No idea.

Miyuki:

Tsukasa:
 I totally remember it.
 Our sisters used to sing it a lot.

Miyuki:

 
Konata:
Oops, she couldn’t hit it.

Kagami:
Couldn’t help it.
 It's too high.



Narration:
On the next episode of Lucky Star.

Kagami:
Kagami here.
 Say, you are out with your friend and you're getting something to eat.
 And everything’s going great until they bring out soup.
 There’s always a little bit that splashes off, right?
 Well, doesn't it suck when a drop gets on your clothes?
 And if it’s curry sauce, it sucks even worse.
 Doesn't it seem like it always happens when you’re wearing your favorite outfit?
 And then it’s like you're totally bummed for the rest of the day, you know.
 
 It’s like when you buy a bento box with soup at a store.
 You make sure to walk home most steady and careful keeping that at level,
 so nothing’s spilled out, right?

 


 And now you got these warped and soggy magazines.


 Next episode, “Various Ways to Spend Christmas Eve”.

Narration:
Look forward to it.
