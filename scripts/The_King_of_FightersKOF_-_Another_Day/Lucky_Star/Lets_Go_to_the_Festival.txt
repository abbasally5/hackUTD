  Konata:
Miyuki-saaan.
 Are you gonna be doing anything fun on New Year's Eve?

Miyuki:
Oh, why do you ask?
Konata:
There's a super cool festival going on.
 Wanna come with me? What do you say?
Miyuki:
A festival for the new year?
 That does sound like a lot of fun.
Konata:
Huh hm. Oh, yeah, it's gonna be fun.
Miyuki:
 Oh, I wonder if it's anything like the snow festival.
 Unfortunately, I'm going to visit with my family, and ...
Kagami:
 Uh, perfect timing. I couldn't help but overhear.
 But didn't I get the same invite from you last summer?
Miyuki:
Did you, Kagami-san?
Kagami:
Here's a translation of Konata's jibber-jabber.
 She wants you to run around and buy stuff at that Comiket thing.
 When I went this past summer, it blew my mind.
Konata:
 I wasn't lying though, I mean a festival's a festival, right?
 Besides going alone's no fun.
 It's a lot of work.




Konata:
Hello, Izumi residence.

Kagami:
 Hey, what's up?
 I was just doing my New Year's cards, and I wasn't sure
 if you were still in mourning.
 I didn't get a declilne note from you yet.

Konata:
Hm? We're not in mourning.
 What made you think that?

Kagami:
 What are you talking about? You took a couple of days off from school
 this year 'cause you were in mourning, weren't you?

Konata:
 Hm. Oh, that... Yeah, I remember we're doing much better now.

Kagami:
 I cannot believe you'd use such a cheap trick.

Soujiro:
 Shiny, happy.

Konata:
I'm kind of right in the middle of our big house cleaning now, so...

Kagami:
 Ya, ya. I got it. I'd hate to keep you away
 from all that dusting you got going on.

Konata:
But...

Kagami:
 Later.

Konata:
 Yeah...
 This sucks.
 Ah, why is it that whenever you got stuff to do that you don’t wanna do,
 you go in the cleaning mode?
 And why is it that when you do start cleaning
 you realize that you’d rather be doing something else?

Soujiro:
 Hey, Konata. Less breaks, more cleaning, OK?


Tsukasa:
 Why is it called Comiket, huh?
 I know it's a big festival and all, but don't you think
 it starts too early in the morning?
 I can't wait to see it.

Kagami:
 You have no idea what you're getting into, do you?
 I pity you.

Konata:
Ah, she'll get used to it in no time.

Kagami:
 Tsukasa, I gotta warn you that this thing's gonna wear you out
 like in all kinds of ways.
 You OK with that?

Tsukasa:
 Uh-huh, don't worry, I'm good.

Kagami:
 Something tells me you don't really understand.

 Unbelievable, the train is being overrun by otaku.


Guard:
Be patient, the light will turn green momentarily.

Tsukasa:
 Hey Sis, I'm getting really scared.

Kagami:
 I hate to say, I told you so.

Konata:
 OK, here's the part where I give the two of you your assignments for today.

Kagami and Tsukasa:
 Assignments?

Konata:
 Assignments.
 Here're your shopping lists.
 When we get in there, we're gonna split up.
 Then we're gonna head all the tables in the order shown on this map.
 You guys take sections 1 to 3 in the east hall.
 I'll take 4 to 6.
 But you have to be careful.
 I've indicated your route in red ink on the map.
 If you don't stick to the route, you're gonna get caught
 between the lines for the tables that're along the walls,
 like right here and here.
 If the two of you get stuck in the crowds in this area,
 you're gonna lose at least 30 minutes.

Kagami:
 I don't know, this looks sketchy to me.
 Can we just hang out?

Konata:
Oh, come on, you'll be fine.
 Look, the tables marked in green are the ones you can leave until the afternoon.
 These guys won't sell outa stuff that quick,
 'cause they usually have a lot of stock on hand, OK?
 Concentrate on getting to all the tables marked in red before the morning's over.
 S is for new, K is for previously published.
 If you're not sure, just buy one of everything they have.
 Does't matter, it's new or not. Here's your ammo, man.
 It's cash 'cause you don't wanna be fiddling with your wallets during checkout.
 The cafe au lait is to keep your sugar level up.
 Take a drink every 30 minutes. This is our rally point.
 Meet me here in exactly 13:00.
 I'll wait for you for 15 minutes.
 If you don't show, then I'll know to go look for you in first aid.
 That's it.
 Any questions?

Kagami:
 I got a question. How come your passion and intellect only pop up
 when you're being a total fan girl?

Announce:
Please don't run!

Otaku:
Climax from the get-go!

Attendant:
The new issue is limited to four per person.
That's four copies per person!
Behave yourself!

Kagami:
 Um, Excuse me?
 Hi, I was wondering if this was A-92.

Salesperson:
Indeed, it is.
Hi, you're getting one each of the new issues,
1,000 yen, please.
You were saying...

Kagami:
 All right. Sorry, I was looking for your new issues.

Salesperson:
Perfect. The new issues are this one and that one
and they're both 500 yen.
Thanks for the help today. You liked the cookies I made?
You loved it, didn't you?
Oh, that's awesome.

Kagami:
 Can I, have three copies of each?

Salesperson:
Absolutely!
"Slippery Brigade Leader" and "The Naughty Captain", enjoy!
3,000 yen, please.

Konata:
 I'll take all of these, please.

Salesperson:
Sure, that'll be 4,500 yen, please.

Konata:
 Here you go.

Salesperson:
Thanks for your business. Hope you like 'em.

Konata:
 Tango down. Proceeding to the next target.

Tsukasa:
 I wonder if I'm in the east hall now.
 If I am not, means north is that way, so then...
 Wait, ah!
 No, no, wait a minute, please, oh no, I'm...,
 Excuse me, but I need to go that way... Uhg!

Kagami:
 All right. I guess I've covered pretty much all the big ones.
 Let's see ... where should I go to next?
 Huh!? Um..., a little peek won't hurt.
 Wow!! Gauron's really sticking to Souske. Ugh!
 No way!

Salesperson:
You like it? You can take it home for 500 yen.

Kagami:
 Ah! It's just stimulating.


Guy 2:
 Uhhh! No way. It's her, the legendary girl A.

 Guy 1:
 Relax.
 She'll think somthing is up if you start freaking out!.

 Guy 2:
 Right, you are right, I know.
 But I heard that whenever she comes here and buy stuff,
 whoever she buys from, their books suddenly get popular.
 How can I not be excited about her?

Guy 1:
 Dude, I know, I want her to buy one as bad as you do.
 We worked our butts off on this issue.

Guy 2:
 Yeah, we did, didn't we?
 We took time off our work and everything
 just to make this issue rock like a mother.
 This is our year.
 Can't you feel it!

Konata:
Can I check it out?

 Guy 1,2:
 Yeah, sure.

 Guy 1:
 What do you think?
 How is it?

Guy 2:
 It’s pretty cool, isn't it?
 We put a lot of work into the scene with the live show.

 Konata:
 Hmm, needs work.
 Thanks anyway, guys.

Guy 1:
 Don't cry. There's always next summer.


Tsukasa:
Excuse me, can you help me?
Staff:
Sure, what can I do for ya?
Tsukasa:
 I'm kinda lost and I'm looking for Pu-61.
 Which way is it?
Staff:
 Oh, I think you'll find the Pu-section in the east hall.
Tsukasa:
 How would I get to the east hall?
Staff:
 This is the west hall.
 You need to get in that line over there, and head upstairs.
 That'll take you right over to the east hall.
Tsukasa:
 How long do you think it'll take for me to get there?
Staff:
 Hmm... Right now, I think it'll take about an hour?
Tsukasa:
 Ugh! OK, that's all.

 I'm sorry, Kona-chan.
 I got lost, and then I had to escape from this place called the "west hall".
 I wasn't paying attention and I got washed away by the crowd.
 What kind of place is this?
Kagami:
 I had to stand in line for the bathroom, and it took an hour.
Konata:
 I figured the little shopping list I gave you was gonna be too much for a first-timer.
 It's all good.
 Let's take it easy and look around for the rest of the day.

Kagami:
 She hasn't had enough?
Konata:
 I have to say, though, since they moved the festival to Ariake, it's gotten better.
 You should've seen that before.
 Back in the day when it was held in Harumi hall,
 there were only two convenience stores in the area.
Kagami:
 Huh, back in the day, huh?
Konata:
 Uh-huh, I think the last time they held it in Harumi hall was like
 twelve years ago.
Kagami:
 Wow, hold on a sec.
 How old were you?
Konata:
 Hm? I was about five.
 It was great. My dad always used to take me there.
 We'd spend a couple of nights in this place called the Hotel Urashima.
 The first time he took me was a Summer Comiket.
 The second floor of the new hall was totally awesome!
 The sweat from all the people in there evaporated and
 rose to this ceiling, then it turned into this huge cloud of steam!
Kagami:
 Yeah, too much information.
Konata:
 Ever since they started having this thing in Ariake,
 it's gotten better and better.
 But because it's gotten so big, all the younger peple who come here
 act like this is some kind of supermarket.
 That breaks my heart 'cause they totally miss the point of it.
 This event was supposed to be something that fans all did together.
Kagami:
 Sorry to interupt your nostalgia, but I don't get any of it, at all.
Kagami:
 I didn't see this last summer.
 Do they always have something like this?

Konata:
 Uh-huh. Although, by now, most of the good stuffs are sold out.
 Look, you guys, it's Nagato!
 It's the real Nagamon!
 And she's selling stuff!

Chihara:
 Here, thanks so much.
I hope the autograph's OK.

Kagami:
Who? What are you talking about?

Customer:
Why!? What do you mean you sold out Haruhi stuff!
You're pissing me off, kid!
Give me my Nagato phone card!

Kagami:
 Jeez, what an ass.

Konata:
 As I've been saying before, there's a lot more of that type coming here these days.

Anizawa:
 I'm sorry to have to be the one to tell you,
 but the limited edition items we had for sale have completely sold out!

Shiraishi:
 What!
 You gotta be kidding me.

Anizawa:
 I am not kidding.

Sugita:
 That's what happens when you get here late.

Shiraishi:
 Who's that?

Sugita:
 Sorry kid, but you have to line up in the morning if you wanna get 'em.

Anizawa:
 You idiot!

Sugita:
 Asia... Hey, what the hell?

Anizawa:
 You will do your best to make the customers happy,
 even if they show up late.
 You're showing a complete lack of spirit.

Sugita:
 Bu... but we sold out of the limited edition things.
 We've only got leftovers on all stock.

Anizawa:
 Did you just say "leftovers"?
 There's no such thing as leftovers!

Sugita:
 Ahh...!

Anizawa:
 Don't let the flashy trends and cheap moe urges fool you.
 Comket is here to show you the true value of your so-called "leftovers".
 And now, after all the limited edition thingy's been sold,
 the real battle between corporate booths is about to begin!

Sugita:
 I... I didn't know.

Anizawa:
 Well, don't you have a suggestion for this customer?
 The best you have, sir, and be quick about it.

Sugita:
 Something...
 Isn't there a weapon?
 Well, how about something like this?

Anizawa:
 No, this is more like it.

Sugita:
 You see?
 Nagato sold out.
 Everyone sold out.
 But do you see this?
 Even Koizumi sold out.

Anizawa;
 Silence!
 How do you think I feel?
 This is three years old.
 The captain cards sold out the first day.

Sugita:
 Well, kid, you wanna buy a Kyon Card?

Anizawa:
 No, Sousuke is the one for you.

Shiraishi:
 I was looking for the Coco Saikoubi card.

Takahashi:
You idiots!

Sugita:
 It's the company president.

Anizawa, Sugita:
 Mr. Takahashi!

Takahashi
 Right, I am the company president, Mr. Takahashi.
 Then I overheared what you two are telling this kid...

Konata:
 That booth always got some crazy goin' on.

Kagami, Tsukasa:
 Re-Really...

Takahashi:
 However, pushing unpopular ones to our unsuspecting costumers.
 Well, I can’t allow that.


 But sir, both of them are main characters.
Kagami:
 I didn't see this last summer.
 Do they always have something like this?

Konata:
 Uh-huh. Although, by now, most of the good stuffs are sold out.
 Look, you guys, it's Nagato!
 It's the real Nagamon!
 And she's selling stuff!

Chihara:
 Here, thanks so much everything xxxxx it's OK.

Kagami:
Who? What are you talking about?

Customer:
Why!? What do you mean you sold out Haruhi stuff!
You're pissing me off, kid!
Give me my Nagato phone card!

Kagami:
 Jeez, what an ass.

 Well, I can’t allow that.


 But sir, both of them are main characters.
Tsukasa:
 I'm so tired.
Kagami:
 I know, I'm tired, too.
 I wish we didn't have to come here right after Comiket.
 How can they have an event like that right on New Year's Eve?
Konata:
 Kagami, Tsukasa, Happy New Year!
Kagami:
 Hey.
Tsukasa:
Hi, Kona-chan. Happy New Year to you, too.
Kagami:
 I can't believe you're still standing after a crazy day like today.
 Besides it's so cold, I figured you'd stay home.
Konata:
 Yeah, well, you got a point there.
 But it's a new year and you have to start it off right.
 The idea's to visit the shrine and get yourself charged up for the coming year.
Kagami:
Wow, that's admirable.
Konata:
 I know, my dad said it.
Sojiro:
 Hello.
Kagami:
 Suddenly I'm feeling weird about it.

Konata:
 And your outfit's looking hot.
Sojiro:
 Oh, yeah.
Konata, Sojiro:
 Stuff like this, stuff like that.
Konata:
 OK, I'm all done praying.
Kagami:
 Oh, well, great. Good for you.
Konata:
 Have you guys finished with all your prayers and stuff for the night?

Tsukasa:
 Hey, Sis, what were you so feverishly praying for a little while ago?
Kagami:
 What, you don't have to broadcast it to everyone.
 And I wasn't that feverish about it.
 I, I was just thinking how nice it'd be
 if I could be in the same class as you and Miyuki.
 That's all it was.
Tsukasa:
 Don't forget Kona-chan's there, too.
Konata:
 That's so adorable.
 I never knew you had a cute side, Kagami.
Kagami:
 Shut up, you!
 I didn't say anything 'cause I knew you'd tease me about it!
Konata:
 And the way you resist your cuteness is also cute .
Kagami:
 What about it !?

Tsukasa:
 You've always been in a different class than the rest of us.
Kagami:
 Maybe it's because Miss Kuroi doesn't like me or something.
Tsukasa:
 I know, I'm gonna go say a prayer
 so that the two of us can be in the same class together.
Kagami:
 Really, Tsukasa!?
Konata:
 I wouldn't do that if I were you.
 Kagami needs to be in a different class.
Kagami:
 Huh, but why!?
Konata:
 Elementary.
 We need you there so we can borrow your stuff
 and copy your homework without getting caught.
 Besides if you're in the same class as me,
 my ranking's gonna drop.
Kagami:
 Maybe you should be in a different class, weirdo!
Konata:
 Yeah, right.
Kagami:
 Anyway, we saw Sebastian...
Sojiro:
 School girls are the best! The best!
Tsukasa:
 Will you and your dad be buying fortunes this year?

Konata:
 Yeah, you know it.
 That’s why we are here.
Konata, Sojiro:
Oh!
Tsukasa:
 Your new year is looking good right from the get-go.

Sojiro:
 I’ll say. Everywhere I look, it's good.
 This is gonna be a great year, I know it.

Tsukasa:
 Oh, it’ll be all right, even though the fortune you picked is horrible,
 it can only get better, you know.
 Good things will happen.

Konata:
 Sure, yeah, whatever you say, I guess it’s how you look at it.
 Thanks a lot.
Tsukasa:
 If you are worried about it, you could tie it to a branch to rid the curse.

Konata:
 Yeah, I’ll do that.
 Wow, you gotta be kidding.
 Wow, more of them.
 Oh, I found a spot. Ugh!
 I guess this is what they call "being cursed".
Tsukasa:
 Yeah.
Kagami:
 Look, whether good things happen or not,
 it all depends on you in the end.
 A fortune is nothing more than a game of luck.
Konata:
 Yeah I guess, but you are a shrine maiden.
 I didn’t know you could say something like that.
 I know, I can collect all the fortunes
 from great curses to great blessings.
Kagami:
 Those things are not trading cards!
Konata:
 Maybe I can even find a secret fortune too.
Kagami:
 Oh, come on secret fortunes?
 What the heck’s a secret fortune?
Konata:
 Maybe an ultra great curse.
Kagami:
 It’s a curse.
 Who'd wanna collect something like that?
Konata:
 I beg to differ.
 You wanna collect'em all, 'cause if you do,
 you'll get a limited edition prize.
Kagami:
 There is noting like that.

Konata:
 I‘ve been wanting to ask you something
 ever since I saw that huge kagamimochi.
 That really big one.
 I was wondering if that’s where the name Kagami came from?
Kagami:
 Well, yeah, I guess you can say it does.
 Kagamimochi is round, the same shape as an old fashioned mirror.
 And for a long time now people would believe that mirrors were where the gods lived.
 See, that’s why my parents named me Kagami,
 because they hoped that my life would be blessed by the gods.
 By the way, its shape symbolizes a well-rounded family too.
Konata:
 Her name’s got all these mystical origins.
 So can someone please tell me how she grew up to be such a hardcore realist?
Tsukasa:
 You want one? They are nice.
Konata:
 There sure are a lot of worshipers.
Kagami:
 Yeah, well, it is New Year's Eve.
 This is nothing compared to other shrines.
Konata:
 I bet most of them are here for the same reason as Dad.
 They just wanna check out all the shrine maidens.
Kagami:
 Oh, come on! There aren’t that many pervs here..., I guess.
Konata:
 I guess, it's that time again.
 It’s the first day of the New Year and time to start things off right.
 Have a Happy New Year, Dad.
 I hope you have the best year ever.
Sojiro:
 Happy New Year, hon.

A comedian on TV:
As usual, we'll call out for Do Ooshiba.
Mr. Do?
Yes! Happy New Year!
How's it going, everybody?
I'm Do.
How about this beautiful location, huh?
Isn't it great?
It's fantastic.
Oh, look at that pretty flower.
There's so many flowerrrrr….
Konata:
 I made some tea, Dad.
 Do you want some?
Sojiro:
 Sure, I’ll have a cup.
Konata:
 Here you go.
Sojiro:
 Oh, thanks a lot, kiddo.
Konata:
 Dad, do you wanna play this game with me?
 Dad, do you want a bowl of rice cake soup?
 Hey, Dad, how about…
 Yeah, well, I guess Dad thought it was cute the way I was bugging him.
 Can you believe that?
 I got my new years allowance though, he sure wore me out.

Kagami:
 Aha, yeah, I bet, you guys are totally wired for each other, aren't you?
Konata:
 And now that my new year's allowance's been secured,
 I think I’m gonna head over to the Gamers right now and spend it.

Kagami:
 Right.
Konata:
 Oh, it’s a pain stores like that aren't open out here in the sticks.
 I mean I'm a little strapped for cash these days.
 And the train ride isn't cheap.
 I wish there was a store like that around here.
Kagami:
 Don't more stores have websites you can order stuff from?
 Ever think of doing that?
 I mean these days you can pretty much order anything on line.
Konata:
 You just don't get it, do you?
 Yeah, shopping on line's OK, 'cause you can get points and stuff.
 But looking around's the best part of going into the store.
 There is always a chance to find something unexpected….
Kagami:
 What is wrong with you? All you wanna do is spend your money!
Konata:
 I wonder why people call these things “pochibukuro”.

Sojiro:
 Iknow. "Pochi tto" means a tiny amount and “koreppocchi” means a bit.
 It’s a bag you put your loose changing.
 Western Japan calls it “pochitto”.
 And “koreppocchi” is how you say it in eastern Japan.

Miyuki:
 Best Wishes for a Safe and Happy New Year, Miyuki speaking.

Konata:
 Hi, Miyuki-san, Happy New Year to you too.
 So anyway, I wanna know about these "pochi bukuro" things,
 like why they are called that.

Sojiro:
 Oh, come on, why can't you trust your old man just a little bit?
 Or at least you could do your fact-checking when I'm not around...
Konata:
 All righty then, time for me to log on and
 give all my gaming buddies a Happy New Year greeting.

….and so, it was just the pits.
In the end, I missed out on buying all the Haruhi goods…
yamanka>> (T_T)
gatongo>> don’t cry!

Friend konakona has logged in.

gatongo>>oh?

konakona>>happy new year!

yamanka>>oh! happy new year! (>w<)b

gatongo>> happy(rotfl)!
konakona>>I’m finally able to log in! The end of the year was so busy…
Friend nanakon has logged in.

Konata:
 Oh, Teach logged on.

konakona>>Ma’am, Happy New Year.

nanakon>>Yo! Happy New Year! (^w^)/~

konakona>>My best regards for the upcoming year.

nanakon>>yup yup, best regards for this coming year! (>w<)b

Konata:
 This is so sad.
 It’s like the poor woman doesn’t have anything better to do.
 I mean she is always on line. Always!
 No wonder she doesn’t have a boyfriend.

Shiraishi:
 H, hiya Luckies.
 I’m Akira-sama’s assistant, Minoru Shiraishi.
 Can you guys say time flies?
 'Cause we are on episode 12, baby.
Akira:
 Cough, cough.

 Shiraishi:
 This ocean is hell.

 Okay, so ah, Akira-sama was supposed to show up in today’s episode of Lucky Star.
 But as you can see, she fell ill at the last minute and couldn’t quite make it.

 Akira:
 Cough, “# @ [ + ~ *” Cough.

 Shiraishi:
 That’s right, it’s a nasty cold.
 But we had a stand-in of you, there was the sign on it.
 So folks who were watching the show,
 they would see something that sort of looked like you.

 Akira:
 “# @ [ + ~ *” cough, cough.

 Shiraishi:
 Aha?
 Wait, Akira-sama.
 Okay, I guess everyone can tell Akira-sama’s wiped out for today.
 So how about we wrap this up?
 See you guys later, by-nee.

 Hum, why do you keep saying that?
 I am not getting a big head.
 What, I’m gonna make you listen to the whole version of “take it! the sailor suit”?
 Look forward... What?!

 If you don’t watch the next episode, I’m gonna lecture you in the name of Mars?

Akira:
 Fumoffu....

Kagami:
 Way to tear it up, you guys!

Tsukasa:
 That was so much fun.
Miyuki:
 It was.
Konata:
 No one entered a song.
Kagami:
 What's with you?
 You are next in the line up.
 Why didn't you pick a song yet?
Konata:
 I couldn’t decide.
 What song should I pick?
Kagami:
 I'll help you look for one.
Miyuki:
 Oh, I found a menu.
Tsukasa:
 Oh!

 Miyuki:
 I didn't knowthey served food here.
Tsukasa:
 Uh-huh.
Konata:
 I sang this one already.
 Now my flow is off.
 I should have saved it for later.

 Kagami:
 What do you mean, "flow"?

 Konata:
 You know, getting your groove on, you flow,
 how you work yourself up to sing a song...

 Kagami:
 I don’t get it.

 Konata:
 Ooh, how about this one?

 “Hey, Godman! Can you hear me...?”

 Miyuki:
 Look! And they also have tambourines.

 Tsukasa:
 Yeah, I'll see you can really have some fun.
 Here, Yuki-chan, let’s use these.

 Miyuki:
 How fun!

 Konata:
 Yes! I'll do this one.

 Kagami:
 Huh, I don't care.
 Just pick something already.

 Konata:
 Here’s a song I know will get everybody moving.
Kagami:
 O, oh!
Konata:
 You know this one.

 Tsukasa:
 I know it too.

 Miyuki:
 Well, I know of it.
Konata:
 “Makenai …”

 Oh, I blew it.

Narration:
 On the next episode of Lucky Star.
 Miyuki here.
 If you’d like to describe something is being at the top of its class,
 or standing head and shoulders above everything else,
 you'd use the term "dantotsu".
 Apparently this is the abbreviation of "danzen top".
 According to record, the very first time this term was used in print was
 when you-know-who won the election to become governor of Tokyo.
 And yes, he did win by a landslide.

 Next time, "Delicious Day".

Narration:
 Look forward to it.
