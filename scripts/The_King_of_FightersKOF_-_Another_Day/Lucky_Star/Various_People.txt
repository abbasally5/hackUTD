  Kagami:
Oh, that's right.
It's time to wear the summer uniform.
I bet Konata's gonna show up in her winter uniform.
There's always someone in every class who forgets to switch.

Tsukasa:
Good morning, Sis!

Kagami:
And that someone is my sister.



Kagami:
Oh, darn it!
I forgot to send my entry into The Tele for that giveaway of theirs.
I was kinda hopin' to win that apron from Love Apron too, darn it...

Konata:
It sounds like you don't have enough love.

Kagami:
Huh?

Konata:
You forgot about it because you don't have enough love for the show.

Kagami:
Whatever, I've been really busy with all my committee stuff.
Besides, I also had to study for exams.

Konata:
No, no, no, no, no. Those are excuses!
I've never forgotten to send mine in.

Kagami:
Stop comparing yourself to me!
You got time 'cause you goof off all day!
Besides, the way you said that ticks me off!

Konata:
Ah ha!

Tsukasa:
How does anyone win a contest like that, anyway?

Konata:
One word, and that's "love".

Kagami:
Whatever, I'm a woman with no love!
There it is!

Konata:
Well, if you send in a normal looking postcard,
you're never gonna win anything.

Tsukasa:
What do you mean, Kona-chan?

Konata:
I design it so it'd get picked!

Tsukasa:
Design how?

Konata:
The first basic step is neat penmanship.
Then you have to make a postcard
that attracts the attention of the person who's picking 'em.

Tsukasa:
For example?

Konata:
For example, take a highlighter and draw a border
around the edges of the postcard.

Tsukasa:
Ahh, that makes it standout!

Konata:
Then draw a picture on it that's got something to do
with the prize you're trying to win.

Tsukasa:
A picture, huh?
Hmm... but I can't draw too good.

Konata:
Not to worry, Tsukasa.
Send in a bunch of postcards and overwhelm 'em with volume!

Tsukasa:
I know I can do that.

Konata:
Although, if you do it that way,
you can't use a computer and you can't just make one
and make a bunch of copies.
You have to write each entry by hand.
And it's gotta be at least a hundred.

Kagami:
A hundred?!

Konata:
Sure, it's normal to send a hundred postcards.

Kagami:
That's gonna cost a fortune!

Konata:
But winning takes lots of time and money.
Winning is all about how bad you want it.

Kagami:
Okay, but at this point, wouldn't it just be cheaper to buy it?

Konata:
You can't buy the feeling you get when you win something.

Kagami:
Huh...

Tsukasa:
Can a hundred postcards fit in a mailbox?

Konata:
No, don't put all of them in the same mailbox.
You put a few in this one, you put a few in that one...
Just do that everyday for a week.

Tsukasa:
Really?

Konata:
Yeah, 'cause if you send in a stack of cards all at once,
whoever is choosing will notice and shove yours aside.
It's a sign of desperation, so it's not a good idea to do that.
But sometimes it really pays off.

Kagami:
Then what do you think I should do?

Konata:
Like I said, you need "love"!

Kagami:
Yeah, yeah.

Konata:
Anyway, if you really wanna win stuff,
there's always those free handouts or those flyers in newspapers.
Just keep your eyes open for the drawings that don't have too big a following and you're set.
Then your chances of winning are pretty high.

Tsukasa:
Um, I'm gonna try that.

Kagami:
Where's the "love" in that?



Konata:
Hmm... hmm... I just noticed something.
You guys look different - for twins, that is.

Kagami:
Of course, we're fraternal twins, not identical twins.
You can tell us apart just like ordinary sisters.
Identical twins look the same but fraternal twins come from two different eggs,
so they differ in appearance and personality.

Konata:
Oh, I get it.
That explains why Tsukasa's really laid-back, and you're so vicious.

Kagami:
What'd you say?

Konata:
You see?

Konata:
Maybe if you do your hair the same way, you'll look more alike than you'd think.

Kagami:
Kona-chan!

Konata:
No way, Kagami can't do cute.

Kagami:
Oh, shut up!
And keep your kooky fantasies and comments to yourself!

Konata:
Hey, are you guys telepathic?

Kagami:
Huh?

Konata:
I heard that even if twins are raised separately, they end up having similar lives.
If they get married, they'll pick the same type of people to marry.
I even heard sometimes twins marry other twins.
Weird, huh?
It's even weirder when one twin's in danger, and the other one gets a feeling
somthing's wrong, even though the other twin's far away.
That's a whole lot of phenomena, isn't it?
So you guys have to be telepathic.
Come on, let's try it out.
Hokey-pokey...

Kagami:
Okay, you read way too much manga.

Konata:
There is Mana-Kana.

Tsukasa:
Mana-Kana?

Konata:
Yeah them. They said there were things about them that were different.
Like how Mana's the one who's really cautious, and Kana's the one who's optimistic.
And they said that when they sing they can tell their voices are different.

Tsukasa:
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Mana-Kana always thought they're from different eggs, you know fraternal.
But a little while ago, they found out they're twins from the same egg.

Kagami:
What?! They're identical?

Konata:
Yeah, why are you so surprised about that?

Kagami:
I heard the definition of identical and fraternal twins had been changed recently.

Konata:
You think it's possible that you and Tsukasa came from the same egg?
Let's see, how're you guys are the same...
I got it, both of you like sweets, right?

Tsukasa:
Yeah, I do.

Kagami:
Sure.

Konata:
Both of you are also left-handed.

Tsukasa:
Yeah.

Kagami:
That's right.

Konata:
What's your favorite color?

Tsukasa:
I like white.

Kagami:
Mine's black.

Konata:
That would be the color of your souls.

Kagami:
What was that?!

Konata:
I guess all this talk about eggs and sausages and stuff got me hungry.

Kagami:
We weren't talking about food.



Konata:
Egh, it's so muggy in here.

Kagami:
It's not even that crowded in here and we're sweating!

Tsukasa:
Guess it's that time of year again.

Konata:
Hot!

Kagami:
I wish someone would turn on the air conditioning.

Kagami:
Ah! Don't do that!

Konata:
So hot!



Konata:
"Ladybug Samba (Punk Rock version)"...

Konata:
So I just found out that a cousin of mine is
gonna be getting married this month.

Tsukasa:
Wow, she's gonna be a June Bride!
That's nice!

Konata:
Tell me something.
How did such a wet and gloomy month ever become
synonymous with weddings and happiness?

Tsukasa:
Uh...

Miyuki:
You're wondering why the month of June is
synonymous with weddings and happiness?

Konata:
Uh-huh.

Miyuki:
In Roman mythology, the goddess Juno, where the word "June" comes from,
was regarded as the protector of women and marriage.
The Greek's version of Juno, Hera, was the goddess
of anything related to marriage and childbirth.
That's why it's said that whoever gets married in June will be
blessed by the goddess and have a marriage filled with happiness.

Tsukasa:
Oh...

Konata:
Yeah, but isn't Hera supposed to be Zeus's wife?

Miyuki:
Yes, that's right, she is.

Konata:
I always pictured Hera to be the jealous type,
'cause Zeus was always foolin' around on her,
so I'm not feeling the happy here.

Tsukasa:
When you get married, do you wanna wear a dress or a kimono?

Miyuki:
I'd really like to wear a dress.
It's what I've dreamed of since I was a little girl.

Tsukasa:
Hmm, maybe I'd like to wear a dress.
But I also think a kimono would be nice.
Hmm, I wish I could wear both!

Miyuki:
They have miniskirts now, and all kinds of colorful wedding dresses too.

Tsukasa:
Wow, miniskirt wedding dresses...
That could be really cute if it had some kind of frilly design on the hem.

Konata:
"So many dreams and so many frills..." Oh my...
Tsukasa's like Angel Salvia.
No, actually your hair makes you look more like Daisy.
So you should be wearing a miniskirt and your top should be yellow.

Tsukasa, Miyuki:
Uh?

Miyuki:
I think Tsukasa-san would look good in a miniskirt.

Tsukasa:
You do?

Konata:
Sure the outfit's important, but the kind of person you end up marrying is too.
It could be a childhood friend, or some girl from a rich family.
That's a tough decision to make 'cause one's got the money and the ability

But if you're after true love...

Kagami:
Then, Bianca is the one!

Konata:
Whoa, Kagami! When did you get so pure?
I thought you'd go for the girl with the money.

Kagami:
I am out of comebacks.



Kagami:
Hiya, Konata!

Konata:
Hm?

Kagami:
You know that game I borrowed? I need help getting past this one level.

Konata:
Whoa, not so fast there, Kagamin.

Kagami:
Hm?

Konata:
Don't you think it's more fun when you figure things out like that on your own?

Kagami:
Hmm. Yeah, you have a point.

Konata:
You know it.

Kagami:
It's fun to figure things out on your own, uh-huh.
So I guess you won't be copying my homework anymore, will you?

Konata:
Ugh!

Kagami:
hum.



Konata:
You know those detectives in manga and TV shows?
Isn't it weird how they keep coming across murders all the time?
Guys like Conan and Kindaichi.

Kagami:
If they didn't, they wouldn't have any mysteries to solve, would they?

Konata:
Really? 'Cause they could go after normal cases too.

Kagami:
Normal, how?

Konata:
They could have a case where they run all over Japan
looking for a missing person.
Tracking someone down's got a lot of game-like aspects to it.
It's got thrills, it's got suspense.

Kagami:
Yeah, I guess.

Konata:
A case where a husband wants his wife tailed
'cause he thinks she's cheating.

Kagami:
Looking for a lost pet could be a case?

Konata:
Yeah, right?

Kagami:
Yeah, but do you think it'd be any fun to watch that?

Konata:
Well no, I guess it wouldn't be any fun at all.

Kagami:
You see?

Konata:
You're right.
Real-life cases don't have the clever tricks, bizarre situations
or show-stopping finales that the crimes in manga and anime have.

Kagami:
Hmm. You're right, they don't.

Konata:
Like faking fingerprints, or scrubbing a crime scene
so luminol won't pick up anything.

Kagami:
Huh?

Konata:
Making it so the forensics team can't solve it.

Kagami:
Well, the police don't want someone copying the perfect crime,
so they censor that stuff from manga and TV.

Konata:
Yeah, or maybe...
Perfect crimes happen all the time but they don't tell us.
Maybe they're never solved. Ever!

Kagami:
Careful talking like that!
Someone might hear you.



Tsukasa:
Don'tcha hate how there's been so much rain lately?

Konata:
Yeah, I know... Ugh...
I remember when I was little I used to like rainy days a lot.

Tsukasa:
I never liked them 'cause if you go out, you get wet, and then you can't hang your clothes out to dry.
How come you liked rainy days so much?

Konata:
Because if it rained, there wouldn't be any baseball on TV, and I'd get to watch all my anime.

Tsukasa:
I should have known you'd say something like that.

Konata:
Yeah, but now they've got stadiums with domes.

Tsukasa:
What's the matter?



Konata:
You know how in manga and anime,
they've got really smart characters and really stupid characters
and they're both going to the same school.

Kamiyama:
I've had enough outta you!

Hayashida:
Shut up!
If you don't like it, why don't you get lost, you dork!

Konata:
I always thought that was kinda strange, don't you?

Kagami:
I noticed something too.
The other day I watched this anime where the teacher
and the students all looked the same age,
and it was totally weird.
Heck, the teacher looked younger!

Tachibana:
Um, ma'am...

Rebecca:
Yes, Tachi**na-san.

Konata:
That's not surprising 'cause the world's always
had a fascination with stuff like that.
People who look young and act old,
or people who look old and act young. You know?

Kagami:
Uh, no.

Konata:
You never question it.
You just go with the flow.
It's a lot weirder to have students with different test scores
in the same class, don't you think?

Kagami:
You're right.
I couldn't agree with you more.
And since you brought it up, Konata, I was always surprised
that you got accepted to this school.
You're so good at pulling all-nighters,
maybe that's how you passed the entrance exam.
Ha ha ha ha ha...

Konata:
huhuhu...

Kagami
Wait!
Is that how she did it?

Konata:
Nah, just kidding.
That's way too much work for an all-nighter.

Tsukasa:
Oh, thanks goodness.

Kagami:
I'm surprised you actually studied for it.
Did a new quiz game come out for the DS or something?

Konata:
No, but my dad did give me a couple of conditions.
For a D rank school, I'd get a Pippin; a C rank, a 3DO, and a B rank's a PS2.

Kagami:
Man, Izumi's dad sure knows what buttons to push.

Konata:
I just thought of something.

Kagami, Tsukasa:
Huh? Hmm...

Konata:
I'm surprised Tsukasa's in the same schools as us.

Tsukasa:
I can't believe you'd be so blunt about it!



Konata:
All right!

Kagami:
Uh, damn! I can't beat her in a fighting game.
She spends too much time playing these.

Konata:
Pick another game.
Even if it isn't a fighter, I'll take you on!

Kagami:
Uh-hoo... sure about that?
Then, how about... we play a quiz game next!

Kagami:
Ugh, you're kidding!
It's a lousy quiz game and she totally beat me!
No way.

Kagami:
Maybe she went and memorized all the questions and answers?
Her memory's sharp as a tack when it comes to games!

Konata:
So what are we gonna play next?

Kagami:
You in a hurry or something?

Konata:
Hey, that's weird, where is it?
Didn't you used to have an easy party game that you like to play?

Kagami:
Hey, how do you know so much about what games I've got in my house, huh?

Konata:
Well, I just thought it was something even you could beat me at.

Kagami:
Ughh...



Kagami:
Really stinky!

Konata:
Hey, Kagami, how come you're not eating any of these snacks?
Usually, you gobble 'em all up.

Kagami:
No reason. I just don't want any.

Konata:
Oh, I get it!
You're on a summer diet, aren't ya?

Kagami:
No, I'm not. It's nothing like that.

Konata:
No one to show your bathing suit to anyway.

Kagami:
Shut up!
You don't need to go there!

Konata:
Oh, that's right.
You guys were born on the Star Festival.
It's almost your birthday, isn't it?

Kagami:
Yeah, so what?

Tsukasa:
Oh, Kona-chan, you remembered our birthday!

Konata:
Mm-hmm.

Kagami:
We're gonna be seventeen.

Tsukasa:
Seventeen's the year before the unlucky one.

Konata:
What do you mean?
What's gonna happen?

Tsukasa:
Seventeen's when unlucky things start happening
and it's right before the real unlucky year.

Konata:
Uh-huh...

Tsukasa:
So now, with my seventeenth birthday coming up,
I'm getting a little worried.
I ended up buying power stones and talismans
to ward off the evil and other stuff.

Konata:
Well, at least you're having fun, right?

Tsukasa:
Yeah, right.
I bought so much, I got to the point...

Kagami:
Yeah, now that we have one of those reckless charms...
I mean, one of those cautious charms.

Konata:
She said reckless charm...
She's all, "That's enough. Safe childbirth! Safe driving! Be careful now!"
Heh heh heh...

Kagami:
Yeah, yeah...



Konata:
Oh, that's right.
Did you guys know that your birthday happens to be on Ponytail Day?

Tsukasa:
Uh-uh, I didn't know.

Kagami:
Why is July 7th Ponytail Day?

Konata:
'Cause in the legend of the Star Festival, Vega had a ponytail.
That's why.

Kagami:
Boy, that's stretching it.

Konata:
And did you know that there's this thing called the Japan Ponytail Association?
And that every year they pick a celebrity who they think would look good in a ponytail
and give 'em an award for it?

Tsukasa:
Wow, I didn't know.

Kagami:
That's silly.
I mean, doesn't everybody look good in a ponytail?

Konata:
Oh, you think so, huh? Hum hum.
 Hmm.

Tsukasa:
Oh, I didn't think it would work with my hair.
How is it?

Konata:
Great!
A small ponytail is really cute on you.

Tsukasa:
Kona-chan, you look great!
I think you totally pull off that look.

Konata:
Yeah, you think so?

Tsukasa:
Mm, I really do.

Tsukasa:
Wow... you look so...

Konata:
Yeah, you look so...

Kagami:
Okay! Fine.
It doesn't work on me.
I get it.

Konata:
You look manly like a samurai!

Kagami:
Drop it already!



Konata:
You know how drunks go around with their neckties
wrapped around their heads?
You guys have any idea why they do that?

Kagami:
Yeah, I do.
See when a drunk loosens his tie,
he's gotta pull it over his head to take it off.
The tie gets stuck and there you have it.

Konata:
Oh.

Kagami:
What's even weirder are the drunks that stagger around
carrying take-out boxes.
What's up with that?

Tsukasa:
Take-out boxes?

Konata:
You know, Kato-chan carries 'em in the Drifters.

Tsukasa:
I still don't get it.

Konata:
That's the visual of the typical drunk.
They've always got the necktie around their heads
and they're carrying take-out.
I don't know why that is.

Kagami:
You see?

Tsukasa:
Vega and Altair... I hope they meet this year.
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle...

Konata:
I'm just hopin' that your wreckless charm works.

Kagami:
Yeah, whatever.



Konata:
The Comp-Fest is in the middle of a huge QUO-card giveaway.

Kagami:
You know, you've been collecting those QUO-cards forever.
But I don't think I've ever seen you use them.

Konata:
Hm? Oh, I don't use 'em.

Kagami:
But, why do you collect them then?

Konata:
When something comes out that's related to
a show or manga you like,
don't you wanna have it - as a collector and as a fan?

Kagami:
Okay, but you're supposed to use those things, aren't you?

Konata:
You can't use them, ever!
You have to stow them someplace safe.
It really pisses me off when I see all those people
using those cards like common money.
These are sacred things.
They're meant to be bound and carefully archived.
You're not supposed to use 'em,
and it's out of the question to go on auction 'em!
If you do, you'll fail both as a fan and as a collector!

Kagami:
Okay. Didn't think you get so worked up about it.

Konata:
Here's how I do it.
I always get three cards for the collection.
First off, I pull the most pristine one
and lock it away for eternity in a special case.
The second card's for me to keep
so I can look at it every now and then.

Kagami:
And the third one?

Konata:
It's a loaner.

Kagami:
You're kidding.

Konata:
Kagami, isn't it human nature to want two or three of
something that you really, really like?
Come on, aren't you the same way?

Kagami:
Huh? Uhh...

Konata:
Fine, whatever. So you don't.
I'm an otaku. I'm totally weird. I'm a weirdo.

Kagami:
No, I, I didn't say that.
I think I sort of know what you're saying, I guess.



Konata:
Tsukasa, you seem like the type who'd be popular with boys,
but I never hear 'em talk about you.

Kagami:
She's kinda on the plain side, so she doesn't really stand out.

Tsukasa:
Mm.

Konata:
I think it's 'cause she's got a scary sister guarding her!

Kagami:
You say something?

Tsukasa:
Maybe it's not because I'm plain -
maybe it's because you guys and Yuki-chan are more unique.

Konata:
Yeah, that Miyuki-san, she sure is smart and pretty.
She's got an awesome figure! She wears glasses, she hates the dentist,
and she's clumsy in a cute way...

Kagami:
Okay! You're getting weird on us again.

Kagami:
You know I've never heard any rumors about Miyuki either.

Tsukasa:
Maybe guys are scared to talk to her 'cause she's so pretty.

Kagami:
Oh, I doubt that.
She's totally nice and gets along with everyone.

Tsukasa:
I guess you're right.

Kagami:
Hey, maybe she gets asked out all the time.

Tsukasa:
And then she turns all of them down?

Kagami:
I don't know, maybe she does.

Konata:
Maybe she doesn't even know she's being asked out when they ask her.

Tsukasa:
Oh, that might be it.
You know, Yuki-chan's sort of clueless, so maybe guys need to be more direct
when they ask her out.

Kagami:
I swear! Your class has gotta be filled with a bunch of scared little boys.
You're telling me that there's not one of them with the guts or passion to go up to Miyuki
and ask her out on a date?

Tsukasa:
I don't think so.

Konata:
Maybe what the school needs are more maniacs in class.

Tsukasa, Kagami:
Huh?

Konata:
Oh, yeah,
Girls like Miyuki-san are much more appealing to the maniacs.

Kagami:
Maniacs, huh?



Tsukasa:
Stinky...

Miyuki:
Oh no! I didn't realize it was already this late.
Sorry, but I think I have to go now.

Kagami:
Oh, already?

Miyuki:
Yes, I'm sorry.
But don't mind me, I'll see you later, okay?
Well, I'm off then...

Tsukasa:
Have a good rest of the day!

Konata:
Later!

Konata:
Where was I?
Oh, yeah. So here's the end of the story. This guy got up and then he...

Miyuki:
Oh no...
Excuse me!

Konata, Kagami:
Yeah!

Miyuki:
I'm so sorry...

Konata:
Don't worry about it.

Kagami:
Yeah, that always happens!
It's no big deal.
Even I've done it before.

Tsukasa:
I've done it too.

Kagami:
See it happens to everybody at least once.
You've done it too, right?

Konata:
Never.

Kagami:
Uh?

Konata:
And that, Kagami, was an example of moe-ism.
Miyuki-san, good job, girl!





Akira:
Hiya, Luckies!
Yeah. It's time for more super fun on Lucky Channel!
And I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami, and...

Shiraihi:
Oh, and I'm Minoru Shiraishi, Akira-sama's Assistant.
How's it going?

Akira:
Yeah, sure.
You know, today's a really special day because it's officially... ta-da! Our third episode together!
What do you think, Shiraishi-san?
Are you getting the hang of it?

Shiraishi:
Yeah... no, not really.
I'm sorry.

Akira:
Aww... Looks like Shiraishi-san's having a hard time opening up to me and that makes me really sad!
You're even sitting further away from me than usual...

Shiraishi:
Ah?!

Akira:
Guess this means you don't like me anymore... sob!

Shiraishi:
Whoa! H-Hey, that's not true!
Look!

Akira:
Scoot.

Akira:
Hi! I wanna start this episode with a twinkle today!
You see, we're gonna start doing something that'll make all you fans out there happy!
That's right!
Today's our first installment of Lucky Star featured character introductions!
Pan-pa-pa-pan!

Shiraishi:
Yes. Today, we'd like to introduce you to Miss Miyuki Takara.

Akira:
Let's see.
She's a class committee-chair, she's beautiful, she's gentle and kind, she's ka-naowle...?

Shiraishi:
Knowledgeable.

Akira:
...knowledgeable, good at sports and super human, too.
Shiraishi-san, you know a lot about Miyuki-san, don't you?

Shiraishi:
That's right, I know all about her.
She's a really nice person. Besides that she wears glasses, which makes her even more pretty, as you can see.
You know when someone's as beautiful as she is, you feel like you can't really approach her.
However, she's actually very easy-going and will talk to any...

Akira:
Wow, it would be nice if you were that talkative on my radio show.

Shiraishi:
Uh...

Akira:
Ugh, you just can't stop talking about that girl, can you?

Shiraishi:
Well, uhh, I know her. And I was just telling everyone...

Akira:
Sure you were.
" Miyuki-san " was it?
Miyuki with the pretty face, Miyuki with the big boobs... every faults and aspect of moe.
Ohh, I'm so jealous. Come to think of it, don't the maniacs go for her type?

Shiraishi:
Akira-sama, hello...?

Akira:
Sure, she's got the maniacs, but I've still got my pedophiles to take back.

Shiraishi:
Maniacs, are they?

Akira:
Oh no!
It's time to say goodbye, isn't it?
I hope you had a super happy fun time!
We wanna know what you think about the show, and I wanna know what you think about me.
So, send those cards and letters, please?

Shiraishi:
Yeah, well, we hope to see you again next time!

Akria:
See ya later!

Okay, so what's she really like?

Shiraishi:
Well, like I described her.

Akira:
Oh, please.
You mean she's not backstage burning through a pack of smokes every fifteen minutes?

Shiraishi:
Aw, no.
She's not like you, she's...

Akira:
Ahh-ha!

get the hang of：コツをのみこむ





Tsukasa:
That was so cool.

Miyuki:
It certainly was a unique song.

Kagami:
I'd like to hear a song that normal people know.

Konata:
Oh, you'll know the next one, Kagami.
Promise!

Kagami:
Huh?

Konata:
Intro's comin' up! Try to guess it.

Kagami:
It's not gonna be another weird song, is it?

Tsukasa:
Hmm... what is this?

Miyuki:
I don't know...

Konata:
Kagamin, your answer please.

Kagami:


Miyuki:
Oh...

Konata:
And it's your favorite version, Kagamin.
Fumoffu!

Miyuki:
Oh, really...

Kagami:
No, I just read the book and got a little...

Tsukasa:
Kona-chan, you're good!

Miyuki:


Kagami:
She's just impersonating the singer.

So, how about you guys. What are you gonna sing?

Tsukasa:


Miyuki:
I don't think I know any of these songs...

Kagami:
Like it matters!
Come on, Konata's gonna be singing this stuff all night if we don't pick anything.
Pick something!

Tsukasa:
Okay, I'll try...

Miyuki:
I'm not confident about my singing though...

Kagami:
It's all right.
We're the only ones listening, so just pick a song and have some fun!

Miyuki:
Oh, really?
Okay...





Narration:
On the next episode of Lucky Star...

Tsukasa:
Tsukasa here!
So, um, the other day I laughed so hard I couldn't breathe, uh...
I thought I was gonna pass out.
And the next morning at school…
Wahh! I'm out of time?!

Next time, "A Question of Motivation"!

Narration:
Look forward to it!
