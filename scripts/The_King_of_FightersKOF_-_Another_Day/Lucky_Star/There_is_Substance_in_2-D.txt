  Konata:
Guess what. I’m raising a pet dog in a game I’m playing.
 And the little guy’s so cute I can’t help talking to him.

Girls:
Wow!

Konata:
 Yeah, I know. And even though it’s in a game,
 I notice that I talk to it like it’s a real animal.
 I call it cutie and stuff.

Kagami:
Yeah, I totally know what you mean.
 When I talk to my goldfish, my voice gets all high-pitched
 and sweet sounding.

Konata:
 Um, I can see talking to dogs and cats that way, but a fish?
 That’s something only a lonely, desperate person would do.

Kagami:
What did you say!? That sounds like a prejudice. Damn you!
 I've seen your face. Don’t you pity me?

Tsukasa:
Talking about doggies reminds me of this question I’ve had.
 There’s this one command I heard with a trainer says "Chin chin".
 So do you guys know what that means?

Miyuki:
Oh! oh, um, if I started explaining it, we could be here for quite a while.
 Oh, let's just say the term is Chinese and leave it at that, shall we?

Konata:
 Okay, all those who just thought of something X-rated, raise your hands.


"Konata":
 It's weird how "Gundam" still really popular with lots and lots of people.

"Sojiro":
 I know, I get "excited" when I watch it.

"Konata":
And "Gundam's" come on lots of different varieties too.
 You know like V and W and X.

"Sojiro":
 Yup, I've been watching it since the beginning,
 so I know 'em all by heart.
 You could say it's my duty as a fan.

"Konata":
Okay, then, if a show called "Gundam serial murder" was on,
 would you watch it?
 Or a show like "Detective Gundam", would you watch that?

"Sojiro":
Yes, if you really love "Gundam", then it’s your “duty” to watch those shows.

"Konata":
 "Duty"?

"Sojiro":
Although it’s not "fun" if you can’t refer to it using a letter.

"Konata":
 All this talking about "Gundams" made me realize something.
 I know I’m kinda small for my age and everything,
 but I'm "two" years older than "Amuro".

"Sojiro":
Time sure "flies", doesn’t it?

"Konata":
Can you believe that in two years I'm gonna be
 the same age as "Bright-san"?
 Isn’t that crazy?

"Sojiro":
 Well, you know, "Bright-san" is really "extreme" character even
 in the world of "Gundam".
 Same goes for "Haman".
 The thing is you can't compare "yourself" to them.
 I mean you are awfully "childish".

"Konata":
 Shock!
 It would have been better if you said that I look "younger" for my age.

"Sojiro":
 Whatever, you're still a cutie pie.


Sojiro:
 Look at what the neighbors got us from their vacation.
 I bet it’s a valuable souvenir.

Konata:
What is it, a vase?

Sojiro:
 I can't believe how awesome you turned out!
 You're so damn cute. You're my kind of girl.

Konata:
That's too hot for hugs, Dad,
 and what you just said sounded really pervy.



Kuroi:
 Um, oh, it's morning.
 I got so hammered last night.
 I figured I'd be passed out for most of the day.
 Oh, well, I guess I'm still young.

TV voice:
What's next is the morning news for today,
Monday July the second. Early today …
Kuroi:
Wait, what happened to Sunday?
 Where did my weekend go!?


Tsukasa:
Whenever I’ve got an exam, I always make it a point
 to stay up the night before to study for it.
 But I don’t get far 'cause I get sleepy.
 I asked Sis for advice and she said...

Kagami:
"You don’t like scary movies, right?
 What if you watch one before you start studying
 and maybe it’ll keep you up for the night.
 Remember last time?
 You jumped into my bed and wouldn’t leave."

Tsukasa:
 So I watched a horror movie and I stayed awake all night.

Miyuki:
 Your sister always knows what to do, doesn’t she?

Tsukasa:
Yeah, but now when it gets dark and I hear a noise,
 I start thinking that there’s something sneaking up behind me.
 Now it’s even harder for me to concentrate on studying than before.
 Anyway I haven’t slept too good since then.
 So now I’m tired in class.

Miyuki:
 But for someone who claims she doesn’t like horror movies,
 you seem to watch a lot of them regardless.

Tsukasa:
 Believe me. If I had a choice, I wouldn’t.

Miyuki:
Come to think of it, my mother's the same way.

Yukari:
 "Hey, Miyuki, would you like to watch this movie with me tonight?"
 "I’m too scared to watch it alone.”

Miyuki:
 I heard that people who scare easily tend to watch lots of movies of that sort.
 Perhaps they secretly like it. 

Tsukasa:
No, Yuki-chan, you're wrong. I really, really hate horror movies, really!

make it a point to : ～することにしている




Yutaka:
 Do you understand this problem, Iwasaki-san?

Minami:
I'm stuck on that one too and I was gonna keep at it.
If I couldn't figure it out, I was gonna ask Miyuki-san
 to help me with it.

Yutaka:
Oh, yeah, hey, aren't we lucky that both of us know people
 who are seniors?
 They'll totally help us if we ask ‘em.
 And that’s what Iwasaki-san and me were talking about
 at school today.

Konata:
 No way, she's got too much faith in me!

Yui:
 She's gonna find out real quick just how harsh reality really is!

Konata:
Hey, neisan.

Yui:
 Huh?

Konata:
Before you and Ki got married, did you guys ever go and study together?

Yui:
 No, why?

Konata:
I always see that setup in games and stuff.
 But if you’re with a boy you like and you have to study,
 there’s no way you’ll be able to concentrate on homework.

Yui:
And if you can’t concentrate, that's when your mind wanders
 and you start to fantasize.
 And that’s about the time withdrawals set in.

Yutaka:
Onei-chan, could you show me how to do this part?

Konata:
 I'm sorta a slump right now. So why don't you ask Yui-neisan?
 Gotta study study study.


Yui:
 What, you little...
 Well, I went to a different school
 and they never really taught us anything like this, so...

Yutaka:
 Oh, no!

Konata:
What a lame excuse!

 Um, I'm kinda stuck myself.
 Do you understand any of this stuff? I bet you don’t, Oneisan.

Yui:
You know, if you already know I don’t know, don’t even ask me.
 Didn't you see what just happened with Yutaka?

Konata:
 No! Maybe I should just call Miyuki-san and ask her.
 I don’t wanna bother her though.

Yui:
Yeah, it's kinda late. Maybe you can call her about it tomorrow.

Sojiro:
Why don’t you ever come to me with things like homework and stuff?
 You can trust me I’m your dad.
 Come on and give me a shot.


Kuroi:
 I'll fix you good.
 Morning, wakey wakey.

Konata:
Even though corporal punishment in the classroom’s been banned,
 you love hitting people.
 Not that I'm complaining or anything.

Kuroi:
That’s true, but I don't hit just anybody.
 If I don't pick my targets carefully, I can get into a lot of trouble,
 if you know what I'm saying.

Minoru:
Wow, she even admits it. She’s so amazing!

Kuroi:
Banning corporal punishment. What are they thinking? Ha!


Kuroi:
That’s it for today, see you all tomorrow.

Konata:
 Hey, Miyuki-san, sorry to bug you but
 I don't get any of the names of these eras.
 Could you show me how to do this problem, Yuki-chan?

Kuroi:
Why are they always asking her?
 How come you guys never ask ME about the stuff you don't get?

Konata:
Wait up! Miss Kuroi.


Kuroi:
Hey, Izumi, what's up?

Konata:
Well, I thought I had a little question for ya.

Kuroi:
 Sure, ask me anything you want, that’s what I’m here for.

Konata:
 In this game I'm now playing right now, there's this rare item in it and...
 Whoa, ma’am, what’s wrong?

Kuroi:
That's not what I had in my mind.


Kagami:
 Ah, why is the day after a typhoon always so darn hot?

Konata:
 It's called typhoon-ikka.
 But I hope the mom and dad typhoons leave their kids at home next time.

Kagami:
Ha ha, nice to word play.

Konata:
Wait, what do you mean by word play?
Kagami:
 You do know that what just you said was a play on words, don’t you?


Tsukasa:
Hey, Sis, I hope I'm not bothering you, but I sorta had a question.

Kagami:
 Sure, come on in. What do you wanna know?

Tsukasa:
It's about what happened this morning.
 Did Kona-chan say something that was weird?
 'Cause I thought there wan't anything wrong with what she said either.

Kagami:
How can you be as dense as Konata? We watch the news together!

Sojiro:
What the hell!
 It's like you guys have bad timing on purpose or something.


Announcer:
Pitcher's eyeballing the runner on the second …

Konata:
 Hey, how much longer is the baseball game gonna be on? 

Sojiro:
Huh, it sorta looks like it’s gonna be running long again.

Konata:
Again?! Jeez, now I gotta reset the time on the recorder.
 Oh, man. Why can’t they just block off more time to begin with.
 You know, Dad, that’s a problem with pro-ball.
 The players always drag out every little move.
 I mean would it kill anyone to pick up the pace?
 'Cause, if the players did that, they might actually be
 able to finish a game on time for once.

Sojiro:
 Yeah, well, I think the pacing is one of the things people like about it.
 And besides the players take time to concentrate, so...


Kagami:
 Well, have you gotten used to everything at school yet?

Yutaka:
 Yeah, but there’s lots of homework. So it’s kind of hard.

Kagami:
 You’ll live.

Yutaka:
Since you're all focusing on your college entrance exams,
 I bet you guys don’t have much homework to do these days.

Kagami, Tsukasa:
Huh?

Kagami:
Okay, Konata!

Konata:
 What, I don’t know where she got that.


Konata:
 Man, is it hot out or what.

Sojiro:
What are you doing?! Put some clothes on or something.
 What if Yu-chan starts walking around like that?

Konata:
Come on. It's been really hot lately. Huh!
 Besides what’s that thing politicians are doing?

Sojiro:
 Cool Biz?

Konata:
Yeah, that.

Sojiro:
 No, that’s different.

Kagami:
 What the heck are you doing down there?

Tsukasa:
 Just waiting for someone to text me back.
 Don’t you hate that?

Miyuki:
 While I was reading my book, I missed my station again.
Konata:
 I don't think I'll ever get sick of your klutziness, Miyuki-san.
 It’s so CUTE.

Kagami:
I don't know about "cute". Sounds more like a hassle to me.

Konata:
You gotta be kidding.
 The way she gets all embarrassed about it afterwards.
 Hello, moe!
 It's super cute when you got a couple of flaws you could exploit.

Kagami:
Oh, yeah, so when you’re at work you’re all,

 "Oh! Oh, no, I tripped! I'm so terribly sorry, sir."
 Or something lame like that?

Konata:
 Kagami, when you did that thing just now, you looked pretty stupid.

Kagami:
I was just giving an example!
 You are the one who brought it up in the first place.
 Whatever, go on, tell us about how you act all clumsy
 just to score points with your customers.

Konata:
 No way, not me.
 You think something like that would happen in my café.
 But if it did, the manager would chew my butt out for it.

Kagami:
 Really? ‘Cause I thought you'd be tripping on your feet
 every five minutes, saying it’s all moe and stuff.

Konata:
 Uh-uh, it’s true that clumsy girls are cute and there’s tons of moe there.
 But the fact is it’s only fun to see that stuff happening in games and anime.
 If you're always breaking stuff in real life, it'd be irritating.

Kagami:
You otaku types are really harsh, for geeks that is.

TV voice:
So if you have a contestant with a perfect score today,
Look "beep" JTB will be giving one lucky viewer a month long trip
across the tundra.
Here comes the first question. Let's find the mystery...

Tsukasa:
On variety shows and quiz shows on TV, you see 'em
 giving out all kinds of prizes, you know, like trips and lots of cash.

Kagami:
 Maybe they get more contestants when they do it that way.

Tsukasa:
I bet the rating score up a lot when they get someone
 really popular to appear on the show huh, Sis?

Kagami:
I don't know. I guess so. Oh, here's a thought.
 What if these shows let the home audience participate
 and gave them the prizes instead?
 Don't you think that would make the rating score up even more?

Tsukasa:
 Maybe but I don't think a TV game show would be that straightforward.


Konata:
 Good morning ladies.

Kagami:
 Hey you.

Konata:
Anyway I was playing this game yesterday and I got to thinking.
 Do either of you know who the school idol at our school is?

Kagami:
 Okay, what the heck's the school idol anyway?
 Is it like a Miss Ryouou or something?

Konata:
Um, yeah, I guess that sort what I’m talking about.
 But if it’s anything like how it’s supposed be in a game,
 you get tough groupies and stuff.

Kuroi:
Oh, man, was that a grueling day or what!
 Ooh! That feels good.
 Wait, I gotta wake up early tomorrow.
 It’s better I stay off the computer, just hit the sack.
 I don’t wanna be late for class.
 I can’t believe I’m making sleep a priority.
 Oh, when I was still in school I was too busy having fun to sleep.
 I’m getting old.

Yutaka: Ah, Tamura-san, you've been making all those faces.
 Are you okay?

Hiyori:
 Yeah, you know how when you draw,
 you make the same faces as the characters you are drawing?

Yutaka:
 Yeah, I get it. You are drawing something, huh?
 I didn't know you drew manga, Tamura-san. That’s cool.

Hiyori:
 Yeah, well, it's only doujin, so...

Yutaka:
 What kind of stories do you like to draw?

Hiyori:
 Well, just your typical four-panel stuff... and some romancey type manga
 between... my favorite characters too.
 Tough question.


 Hiyori:
 I bought this lottery ticket the other day and I won three thousand yen with it.
 So there I was thinking how awesome the rest of my day’s gonna be.

Yutaka:
 Wow, you are so lucky!

Hiyori:
 But on the way to school my bike got a flat.
 My lunch exploded all over the sidewalk.
 So I used some of the money to fix the flat
 and the rest to buy some lunch form a convenience store.
 And that's pretty much all the money I won.
Minami:
 They say the truth is stranger than fiction, I guess.
Hiyori:
 Yeah, whatever. I guess in the end it'll make a good story
 for a manga someday. So it’s all good.

Minami, Yutaka:
 She’s so tough!

Hiyori:
 An artist’s drawing hand is her life. I'd give my life to save it.

Minami, Yutaka:
 Sh, she’s really tough!

Yutaka:
Wow, you’re super talented, Tamura-san.

Hiyori:
 I don't know what's going on with me.
 That drawing is pretty darn awful.
 Oh, but here's a little something I just finished
 that I think rocks super hot.
 Whatever, I shouldn't expect most people to get where an artist is
 coming from or pick up all the subtle details in the lines.
 I should know better than that.

Hiyori:
 Holy crap! I forgot it.

Yutaka:
 What happened? Are you okay?

Hiyori:
Oh, it’s my favorite mechanical pencil.
 I was drawing yesterday and I left it home back on my desk.

Minami:
Wanna borrow mine?

Hiyori:
No, man, it’s gotta be her. I’m used to the way she feels,
 the way she just flows across the page, I...
 Yeah, you're right, mechanical pencils are all the same, ha!
 Yes, they are, yeah.
 I knew you guys would react like that, I totally knew that, I knew that.

Hiyori:
 The suckiest thing about it is that I got totally lost in there.
 I couldn't get out for three hours... Ah!

Yutaka:
Is anything wrong, Tamura-san?

Hiyori:
 H, how embarrassing! What are they thinking?
 Dressing like that in public!

Minami:
 Is that a coat?

Yutaka:
 Wow, it's summer and they're dressed like that. They must be hot.

Hiyori:
Ah! This kind of pain's reserved for the ones who know about it.
 Hang on a second, I gotta send these to someone.

Waitress:
Welcome ladies.

Yutaka:
 Wow, it’s super crowded.

Hiyori:
 I'll go put my name on the sheet.

Yutaka:
 It was fun 'cause oneichan and me stayed up late again,
 playing a video game...

Waitress:
Suzaku-sama, Suzaku-sama, party of three.

Hiyori:
 Oh, hey, that’s us.

Yutaka:
 But I didn’t hear them call your name. That was someone else's.

Hiyori:
Anytime I have to put my name on a waiting list,
 I write down the name of one of my favorite characters.
 It kind of makes me feel a little closer to 'em.
 Know what I’m saying?

Hiyori:
 Awesome, you can find my people everywhere.

Yutaka:
Huh... Huh...
 Oh, thanks a lot, if there's one thing I'd wish for,
 I'd wish I could be as slender and tall as you are.
 I think that’d be so cool.

Yutaka:
"I want you to know, Minami-chan, that I admire you so very much. And I..."

Minami:
 "Yutaka..."

Minami:
Well, I'm sure you are not done growing yet. So don't worry.
 You never can tell.
 Perhaps you'll even be taller than me someday.

Yutaka:
You really think so?

Yutaka:
 "Minami-chan, Minami-chan, MINAMI-CNAN!"

Hiyori:
 Whoa, hold it, stop, that totally goes against the laws of nature.
 And that last shot is all wrong! It's insane! And I need to calm down!

Yutaka:
Are you feeling okay, Tamura-san? You’re looking really pale.
 Wanna go to the nurse's?

Hiyori:
 Hehehe, I was up all night, drawing my brains out,
 trying to make the deadline for this contest I’m in.
 Then even though I didn't get any sleep, I still made it to the couriers in time.
 It’s okay, when I work really hard on something, I feel all shiny inside.
 Like I'm dissolving in the little tiny blobs of light...

Minami, Yutaka:
She's really super tough!

Yutaka:
 Ah,Tamura-san, what does "yaoi" mean?

Hiyori:
 Ugh!　That depends on which one you mean.

Akira:
Hiya, luckies!
 Are you guys ready for the nineteenth episode of Lucky Channel?
 We are almost at the end of the season.
 Can you guys believe it?
 I'm Akira Kogami, your you-know-what.

Minoru:
And I'm Minoru Shiraishi, her you-know-what.
Hope you're all doing well today.
Wow, you look like you are in a good mood, Akira-sama.
You must have done something fun last night.
I wonder what it could have been.

Akira:
Go on, take a guess. He-he-he.

Minoru:
Oh, well, I think I'll pass.
I just ate.

Akira:
Oh, man, this TV gig's really getting on my nerves these days.
 I'm telling ya, after nineteen episodes,
 I'm starting to feel like I need a vacation.
 Do some unwinding, maybe soak in a hot spring.
 It would be nice if I can win something like that trip
 they were talking about in the main segment today...

Minoru:
Hang on!
If you wanna win the trip like that, you're gonna have to become
a contestant on that quiz show that was playing in the background of...

Akira:
 Huh...

Minoru:
Vacations are cool, aren't they? I'd like to go on one.
Traveling through foreign lands. They say it’s good for the soul.
Don’t you know? Ha-ha-ha.

Akira:
 Are you saying you like to travel?

Minoru:
I'll say I do. I love it. Traveling is the best.
And I should know, 'cause I've done a lot of it.
I climbed to the top of Mt. Takao and I went to Jougashima.
I am what you might call the outdoorsy type.

Akira:
 Hum, so you're outdoorsy.

Minoru:
Nothing calms your jangly nerves like a walk in the woods
surrounded by Mother Nature's splendor.
It's the best in the world!

Akira:
Sure, Mother Nature, walking in the woods while you're jangling your nerves.
 Sounds like a real blast, man.

Minoru:
Yeah, doesn't it? Leaving all the noise of the city behind,
letting Nature take you in her hand, soothing your mind and body.

Akira:
Um, um, um, yeah, that Mother Nature sure does sound hot.

Minoru:
I know, isn't she awesome!

Akira:
 You wanna go for a walk in the woods?

Minoru:
Are you serious? Can I go? If you are serious, I’ll totally go.
I’ll go right now. Yes!

Akira:
Then you are going on Minoru's Mother Nature tour.

Minoru:
Ugh!?

Staff:
Take care.

Akira:
 Have fun.

Minoru:
They've got... everything... you want.
So, um, where am I going on tour, exactly?

Akira:
 Fuji.

Minoru:
Huh, oh, well, I've already climbed the mountain before, so, uh...

Akira:
You are not going up to the mountain.
 I want you to go up to Fuji Forest.

Minoru:
Oh, I get it. The forest, okay.
Fuji Forest, me, seriously?

Akira:
Mm-hm.

Minoru:
Okay, so once I get to the forest, is there anything in particular I should do...?

Akira:
Go and bring me back some water.

Minoru:
Water.

Akira:
Yeah, the famous Fuji water. And I want it straight from the source.

Minoru:
Ugh, are you kidding? You can just buy a bottle of it at the s...

Akira:
Naaw. I'd like my water fresh!

Minoru:
I'm not going alone, am I, am I, am I? Someone’s going with me, right?

Akira:
It's okay. You'll be fine.
 The director and producer have agreed to sacrifice themselves along with you.
 Isn't that nice?

Director:
Let's get ready for mount.

Akira:
 Don't get yourselves killed out there.
 Oh, no, is that it? I guess it is.
 Oh well. Just make sure you guys tune in next time
 'cause Lucky Channel’s gonna have a super special guest coming by the studio.
 See you guys later, okay? Bye-nee.
 Wasn’t there an easier way to get rid of him?
 I mean we could have just shot him out of the...



Yui:
 On the next episode of Lucky Star.

Nanako:
 I'm Nanako.

Yui:
 And I'm Yui-chan.

Nanako:
I don't know if you’re like me but right before summer starts,
 don't you get all excited about it? Sure you do.
 But then before you know it, the summer’s over,
 and nothing exciting’s happened to you.

Yui:
Hum, I guess.
 What’s so special about summer anyway?

Nanako:
Yeah, well, it’s not like you're gonna find true love with anyone
 you meet during summer so whatever, right?

Yui:
Hum, yeah, I wouldn’t know.

Nanako:
Who cares? We’re still young.
 Let’s get out there and get some.

Yui:
Yeah, wait.

Nanako:
What?

Yui:
 Um, no comment. Next time, “Ways to Spend Summer”.

Nanako:
I'm getting. Get me some!
