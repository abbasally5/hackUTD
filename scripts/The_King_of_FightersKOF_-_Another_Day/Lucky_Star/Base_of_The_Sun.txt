  Kagami:
 Hey, guys.

Tsukasa
 Oh! Hiya, Sis.

Kagami:
 How'd your exams go?



Konata:
 A disaster as usual.

 You know what I’m saying?

Kagami:

 
News announcer:
Raided the suspect's room where authorities confiscated
thousands of manga and video games.
Apparently now similar ..

Konata:
 It's happened again!

Yutaka:
 No way!

Kagami:
 There was a story on the news again about another geek like you.
Konata:
Yeah, I know, I can't stop thinking about it. It’s totally unfair.



Kagami:
 Yeah, I guess. It bums me out too.

Konata:



 Yutaka: Hum, aha! Mm-hm.  Yutaka: That's what Konata and I were talking about this morning. Minami’s mother: You're quite attached to Miyuki-chan, aren’t you? Why, you're so close, you could be sisters. Minami: Here you go, Kona-chan. Happy birthday! Konata: Wow! Huh? Kagami: If Tsukasa hadn’t reminded me about it, I would have forgotten. Miyuki: Happy birthday, Konata! Konata: Thanks a lot, you guys. Kagami: Yeah, I guess it’s nice that people remember your birthday. Konata: Yeah, whatever, I'm super happy I'm a year older! Kagami: Huh? Why's that? Miyuki Do you wanna get a driver’s license or something? Konata: I'm old enough to play games with a mature rating. Kagami: So what? You’ve been playing those games this whole time anyway. Konata: Haha, Who? Me? Kagami: Konata: Let me go! Kagami: Hey, Miyuki, do people ever think you're older than you really are? Tsukasa: You do look really mature, Yuki-chan. Miyuki: Yes, I suppose so. Konata: Wow, you get to skip past college and everything.  Konata: Kagami: Ugh, gimme a break! Konata: 
Minami:
 Mm?

Yutaka:
Huh? Oh, this thing?

Minami:
 Mm-hm.

Yutaka:
 I'm making it for Konata's birthday party.

 
Yutaka:
Did I make it home in time?
Soujiro:
 Yup! Are you ready to do some decorating?

Yutaka:

Soujiro:
 
 Hey, kiddo.

Konata:

 
Yui:
 This is really good, Yutaka.
 
Yutaka:
 Oh, thanks a lot.

Soujiro:
You can take the 'stache off now.


Konata:
 Hmm...future aspirations?

Tsukasa


Miyuki


Konata:


Tsukasa
Yeah, you know me, I’ve always liked to cook and sew and stuff.
 
Konata:
 Oh, you just wrote down all your dreams, huh?
 How about you, Miyuki-san?

Miyuki
Since I want to become a doctor, I have to take courses in pre-med.


Konata:
That’s our Miyuki-san. You know what you want and how to get it.
 How about you, Kagami?

Kagami:

 
Konata:
Jeez, that doesn’t sound very interesting at all.
 
Kagami:
Does it have to be interesting?
 What'd you put down?
 Hehe, I should’ve known you wouldn't take it seriously.
 Don't you have some kind of special talent besides making faces?

Konata:
Special talent, huh?
 Oh, Poke”beep”mon! I memorized the names of each and every one of 'em.
 
Kagami:
I guess that's a special talent, but it doesn't address the future goal thing.

Konata:
Oh, there it is.
 This is the one I wanted.
 
Kagami:

 
Konata:

 
Kagami:
Yeah, I guess I know what you mean.

 'cause the fish on the conveyer belt’s always dry and crusty.
 
Konata:


Kagami:
What!? You don't!?

Konata:
You’re so cheap.

Konata:

 Don't you get sleepy?

Kagami:

 It's got the same vibe, right?
 
Konata:
 You really think so?

Kagami:

 Here, just give it a shot.

Konata:


Kagami:

 So come on, just try it.

Konata:
Yeah, I'm gonna have to pass.


Kagami:



Konata:
Uh-huh, I get it.

Kagami:
Get what?

Konata:

 Isn't that right?
 
Kagami:



 
Konata:
 Um, I wouldn’t know. I just sorta look at the pictures.

Kagami:

 You just skim right past it.

Konata:
Ugh, all right, all right, fine. I’ll read it.

Kagami:
Oh no, don’t bother.
 It doesn’t count if you have to force yourself to read it.

Konata:

 
Kagami:

 

Kagami:
Oh, darn it!
 I can’t believe I forgot my world history book.
 I bet I left it sitting on my desk after doing my homework.
 Hey, can I borrow your world history textbook?
 You left it here, didn’t you?

Konata:
Yeah, I did.
 What, did you forget yours?
 
Kagami:
 Mm-hm.

Konata:
Huh, that’s weird. Here.

Kagami:
 Ah!?
Kuroi:

Kagami:
 No, it’s not… really mine...
Kuroi:


Kagami:
I feel like I'm hitting the wall.
 Guess I’ll go downstairs and get something to drink.
 Ah, great!
 What the!?
 Yay, I just bought that stuff yesterday and it's already gone.
 Whatever, a walk’ll do me some good.
 Huh!? They're closed!? Oh, it’s like a conspiracy!

Cashier:
Three hundred twenty yen, please.

Kagami:

Tsukasa:
Hiya, Sis, what’s wrong?

Kagami:
 Well, you know how when you get irritated,
Tsukasa:
 Oh, yeah, no matter what you do, nothing seems to go right.
Kagami:
 Yeah, it’s like a negative spiral or something.

Tsukasa:
Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you. I baked a cake. Want some?

Kagami:
Yeah!
Tsukasa:
 I know, tomorrow I’ll bake cookies.
Kagami:




Yutaka:
 No way, you think so too, Iwasaki-san?

 Haha, yeah I know what you mean, haha.


 
Konata:


Yutaka:
 Say what!!??

Kagami:
Can’t believe this is the last year I’ll be wearing this.
 Whenever I think about it, I start getting all emotional.
 Oh? There’s something in my pocket.

 

Tsukasa:
Huh, where’s the octopus and wasabi?
 Oh, I wonder what this is?
 Ahaa! Oyoyo!

 

Konata:
Sure rains a lot during the rainy season.

Tsukasa:
 I know.

Konata:
 Just when you think it’s getting too hot, all of a sudden it gets cold,
 and it totally sucks 'cause we just switched to our summer uniforms.

Kuroi:
 Hey, what are you guys still doing here?

Konata:
You’re so lucky, ma’am, you know?
 You can wear whatever you want, whenever you want.
 
Kuroi:

 
Konata:
Wow, ma’am, that’s just so... I mean you’re really...

Yui:
Yoo-hoo! The rainy season’s back and so's the humidity!

Konata, Yui:
Hey, Yui-neisan.

Yui:
 Man, all this rain’s so darndepressing.
 
Yutaka:
Would you like some tea?

Yui:
Sure, sounds awesome.
 You got something coming up that you can look forward to.
 You're gonna be celebrating your first wedding anniversary.

Yutaka:
 Oh that’s right. Wow, time flies!

Konata:
During the rainy season, the skies look…

Yui:

 This totally sucks.

Konata:
 I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said anything.

Yui:


Yutaka:
 Here, maybe if you have some tea, it’ll cheer you up.
 
Yui:

Yutaka:
Glad you like it.

Yui:
 Jeez, my love life's gonna get all rusty if things keep up like this.

Konata:


Yui:
 Ah, couldn't you at least try to comfort me a little?

Konata:
Hmm... Couldn’t help it. Sorry.

Yui:
Hello? Huh? You’ll be coming back home soon!?

Konata:

 
Yutaka:
I know!

Kagami:
You're kidding, Tsukasa.
 You mean Matsuri still hasn't given you that outfit back?

Tsukasa:
 Uh-uh.

Kagami:
That’s not good. You know how she is.


Tsukasa:
Kagami:

 
Miyuki:


Konata:
 I guess.

Kagami:

 
Tsukasa:
 Huh? Yeah, I guess I see what you mean.

Konata:


Hiiragis:
"1, 2, ah, ha, ha, uh, ah"

Kagami:
 "What the!?"
 
Konata:


Kagami:

 
Matsuri:

 
Kagami:
 Huh?

Tsukasa:
 Ah!

Matsuri:
 Don't tell me you forgot to tell her.

Tsukasa:
I'm sorry.

Kagami:
 Could someone tell me what’s going on?
 
Matsuri:
What do you mean “What's going on?”
 Mom and Dad started their vacation today, remember?

Kagami:
 Oh, yeah. They're not gonna be home.

Tsukasa:
 It’s all my fault. We were supposed to go shopping for ingredients.
 Sorry, I totally forgot about it.

Matsuri:
 I called your cell, Kagami, and even left you a message.
 Didn’t you get it?

Inori:

 
Matsuri:
Aww, but I was totally set on making something yummy tonight.
 
Inori:
 You can make it tomorrow night.

Matsuri:
Well... fine. But it’s all your fault. You guys suck.

Tsukasa:
I’m sorry.

Kagami:
 Fine, whatever! I’ll go get your ingredients.

Inori
 Well, you could've handled that a little better.

Matsuri:


Kagami:
Give me a break.
 She doesn't even like to cook that much anyway.
 Man, she can be such an ass.
 
Tsukasa:
 Kagami!

Kagami:
Huh? Tsukasa!

Tsukasa:
You forgot this. It’s the shopping list with the ingredients.

Matsuri:
 They're really late.

Inori:

 
Matsuri:
 Took you guys long enough!

Kagami:
 Hmph!

Inori:
.

Tsukasa:
The store we usually go to didn’t have any saffron,
 so I said we could probably get by using some curry powder instead,

 
Matsuri:
 Jeez, you know you guys didn’t have to go that far.

Kagami:
 Yeah, well, whatever!

Inori:


Tsukasa:
There, sorry for the wait.

Inori:
 All that’s left is Matsuri special dish.

Matsuri:
 It’s done!
 
Tsukasa:
Yummy! It looks amazing!

Inori:
Yeah, it’s got a wonderful golden brown color.
 
Tsukasa:


Matsuri:

 
Inori


Matsuri:
 Ah, no big deal.
 Let’s eat.

Tsukasa:
Yay!

Tsukasa:
 Uh-oh.

Inori:
What happened to you?

Miki:
 You won't believe it. Your dad made a mistake about the date for our trip.
 
Kagami:
When's it supposed to be?
 
Tadao:
Well, I actually made the reservation for next week.

Matsuri:
 That sounds like a bad joke.
 
Miki:
Oh, having dinner?

Inori:
Yeah, you guys hungry?

Miki:
 Mm-hm..

Tadao:
 Ooh, is that paella?

Tsukasa:
Yeah, and guess what, Masturi made it.

Miki:
 Oh? It looks amazing.

Matsuri:
Thanks.
 Kagami totally helped me out by getting all the ingredients.
 She went all the way out to the supermarket just to get 'em.

Tadao:
 Well, wanna dine in tonight, hon?

Miki:
 Okay.

Kagami:
This is pretty good.

Matsuri:
Hey, who took all the mussels?

Tsukasa:
 Mussels？

Kagami:
I wasn't supposed to take any?

Matsuri:
 I can't believe it. I was saving ‘em to eat for last. Oh, man!
 
Kagami:
 Then write your name on 'em next time!

Inori:top fighting!

Kagami:
 Hey, is it cool if I take a little detour into town with you today?

Konata:
 Oh, yeah, sure. You wanna buy something?

Kagami:
 I don’t know when I’ll have time to read it though,
 'cause of all the assignments they're giving us these days.

Konata:

 And then before I know it, I’m out buying more new manga.

Tsukasa:
I know, I do that too.

Kagami:
 Then read the stuff you’ve got instead of buying something new.

Konata:
Well, if you buy it now, then you don’t have to worry about buying it later.
 And if you don’t, you feel like you're missing out... right?

Kagami:
What are you asking me for?

Akira:
 Hiya, luckies!
 Yay! You guys ready to have a super exciting time?
 Do you realize that this is the seventeenth episode of Lucky channel?
 That’s so amazing!
 It's Akira Kogami! Okay.

Minoru:
 Hello...

Akira:
So we invited a super big name guest to come on the show today.
 
Minoru:
 Ah...

Anizawa:
 How long are you people gonna make me wait?!

Staff:
Oh, crap, I'm in the shot, sorry!

Akira:
He's in the shot again.

Minoru:
I know.

Akira:


Anizawa:
 This program's totally weak!
 
Akira:



Anizawa:
 Unacceptable!

Minoru:
 Oh, where did he go?
 Holy cow he is fast!

Anizawa:

 Quickly, tell me what they are.
 
Akira:


Anizawa:
 Nooo!

Minoru:
Oh, my uniform's burning red. Hot, hot,hot!

Anizawa:
They are..

Akira:
Come on...

Anizawa:
It's the love their staff and the cast pour into the show.

 
Akira:
Wow.

Anizawa:


 Yes, see what I’m saying Shiraishi?
 
Minoru:
 Shiroishi?!

Anizawa:


 That’s the stuff you need to make a successful anime. 

Akira:
Yeah. So that’s everything, is it?

Anizawa:
 Right now, you are playing someone called Akira Kogami.
 
Akira:
 Right now, huh?


Anizawa:


Akira:
What the hell are you talking about?

Minoru:
Hm!?
Anizawa:
 Well if you didn’t feel anything in your heart for them...

Akira:
No, not a thing.

Anizawa:
 Burn yourself out as Akira Kogami!

Akira:
 You’re twisting my bra.

Minoru:
Okay, I promise I’ll burn out as Minoru Shiraishi!

Anizawa:
 Right on, Shiraishi!

 
Akira:
 So that’s it, right? Hu... By-nee.

Minoru:
 You were watching?
 
Anizawa:
Of course, part of my job.
 
Akira:
 Thanks for the hard work today. I’ll go home.
 What? Huh, Shiraishi can handle the rest.

Minoru:
 I can’t believe they let me do it. I was so nervous.
 
Anizawa:

 

Minoru:


Anizawa:
 Boring! Would you stop with the cookie cutter preview?

Minoru:
Heil Blayking, Boss.

Anizawa:
Right, now listen up.
 The first rule to becoming a big-time voice actor is...

Minoru:
Rule number one is...

Anizawa:
 If you can’t beat 'em, join 'em.

Minoru:
How sad, sir.
 Next time "To Each Her Own".
 And that’s it for Anizawa.

Anizawa:
Finger!
