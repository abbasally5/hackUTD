  Yui:
It's summer!

Ritsu:
It's the beach!
Oh...

Mio:
It's so pretty.

Yui:
It's sparkling.

Ritsu:
Mm, ready, let's swim!

Yui:
Yeah!

Mio:
You guys, be careful and don't get carried away, okay?!

Ritsu:
Yui, the water is all salty!

Yui:
Because it's salt water, Ritchan!

Ritsu:
Yui, there're waves here!

Yui:
Oh, there're waves, Ritchan!

Mio:
They're not listening to a word I said...


-- OP --


Mio:
Hm? Light Music Club?
Uh... Sakura High Festival?


#4: Training Camp!


Yui:
Let's see...
Aw! My finger!

Ritsu:
You really did forget how to play.

Yui:
My grandma used to compliment me all the time.
"Yui" she said, "as soon as you learn one thing, everything else seems to leave your head."

Ritsu:
I don't think that was a compliment.

Yui:
Oh, Mio!

Ritsu:
Where have you been?

Yui:
Huh?

Mio:
We're having a training camp!

Yui:
Training camp?

Mio:
That's right.
Summer vacation is almost here.

Ritsu:
We're going to the beach?!
Or maybe to the mountains?!

Mio:
We're not going out there to play around!
This will be a band training camp!
We'll be practicing nonstop from sunup to sundown.

Yui:
I'd better buy new clothes to wear!

Ritsu:
Yeah, I need to buy a swimsuit, too.

Mio:
Listen!

Pretty soon after the end of summer vacation is the high school festival.

Ritsu:
High school festival?

Mio:
Yes! In the past, the Light Music Club was pretty famous for its incredible live performances at the Sakura High Festival.
That festival is...

Ritsu:
Wow, the school festival...!

Yui:
School festivals at high schools are pretty elaborate, right?

Ritsu:
Concession!

Yui:
Yakisoba!

Ritsu:
Takoyaki!

Ritsu, Yui:
Hahaha.

Ritsu:
I know, I really wanna have a full-on maid cafe!

Yui:
Yeah, a haunted house would be a lot better!

Ritsu:
A maid cafe!

Yui:
A haunted house!

Ritsu:
A maid cafe!

Yui:
I said a haunted house!

Ritsu:
No, a maid cafe is the way to go!
Argh!

How come you only whacked me?

Mio:
We're the Light Music Club, aren't we?
We are performing!

Tsumugi:
Hello, everyone.
Sorry, I'm late.
Huh?
Would you like some madeleines?

Goodness.

Mio:
So, what do you think, Mugi?
I know at the beginning, I said we should take things slowly, but I mean, come on, it's been three months now.
We haven't played together a single time.

Tsumugi:
Now, now, now, now, now, now...

Yui:
Six times...

Ritsu:
What?

Tsumugi:
Oh... Yeah, definitely! Let's go!
I've always dreamed of having a sleepover with you all.

Yui:
Really? You have?

Ritsu:
So, should we go out to the beach?
Oh, how about...

Mio:
I told you, this is going to be a training camp for the band!

Yui:
How much is this training camp going to cost?

Ritsu:
You know, she's right.
We're on a tight budget?

Mio:
I... hadn't thought of that...
Hey, Mugi.

Tsumugi:
Yes?

Mio:
Do you have a summer house?

Tsumugi:
Yes, of course.

Everyone:
Of course she does!


Ui:
Sis?
Come on, Sis!
How about getting out of bed already?
And aren't those my pajamas?

Yui:
A little longer, please.

Ui:
You're just hopeless.
Hm?
Um, Big Sister?

Yui:
What time is it?

Ui:
Um, uh...

Yui:
Hello.

Mio:
Good morning.

Yui:
A fine morning to you, too.

I'm sorry!

Boy, I can't believe I made it...

Ritsu:
Yeah, and after we warned you not to oversleep, too.

Yui:
Sorry I was way too excited to get a good night's sleep.

Ritsu:
What are you, a grade-schooler?

Yui:
Hehehe...

Mio:
Yeah, well, seems she's not the only one.

Yui:
She's asleep.
Well, she did say this was her dream.

Tsumugi:
The gel type will be fine.

Mio:
Gel?!

Yui:
Hey, I wonder what she's dreaming about right now?

Ritsu:
You know, I think we need to get a picture of this.

Yui:
Cut it out, that'd be really mean!

Ritsu:
It's for our memory album!

Tsumugi:
Oh, I'm so sorry.

Yui:
You see, you woke her up.

Ritsu:
I'm sorry about that.
So, now that you're awake, you really gotta tell us.
Where is this cool summer home of yours?

Tsumugi:
Uh, let's see...
Almost there.

Yui:
Oh.

Ritsu:
Wow!

Mio:
The beach.

Tsumugi:
Yes, the beach.

Ritsu:
Yui!

Ritsu, Yui:
Ready and hold!

Yui:
Smell that salty air!

Ritsu:
Swimming, yeah!

Mio:
I told you, we didn't come here to play!

Ritsu, Yui:
Yeah!

Ritsu:
It's huge!

Tsumugi:
To be honest, I had hoped to stay in one of our larger vacation houses.
But unfortunately, I only got permission to borrow our smallest.

Ritsu:
This is your smallest house.
This?

Ritsu:
Hahaha.

Yui:
Wow, look at all this space!

Ritsu:
This is amazing!

Mio:
Huh?
What's this?

Tsumugi:
Um, I am sorry.
I said that they didn't need to leave anything out for us, but I guess they did.

Ritsu:
Mugi, what's in here?!

Yui:
Oh, it's a princess bed!

Ritsu:
Wow! Look at that!

Tsumugi:
I'm so sorry.

I always tell them that I'd like things to be as normal as possible.
They just don't seem to understand what that means.

Come in.
It hasn't been used recently, so I'm worried that the gear might not work properly.

Mio:
Well, everything looks okay!
Hey, where are Yui and Ritsu?

Tsumugi:
I don't know.
They wandered off at some point.

Mio:
Those two are hopeless.

Tsumugi:
What's that?

Mio:
Oh, you mean this?
It's a past Light Music Club playing at the school festival.
I found it in the clubroom earlier.

Tsumugi:
They're good.

Mio:
Yeah, they're way, way better than we are.

Tsumugi:
Yes.

Mio:
When I heard this, it's like I had this sudden urge not to be outdone by them.

Tsumugi:
So, is that why you suggested this training camp?

Mio:
Yeah, but we're...

Tsumugi:
I don't think we will.
I know we can do this.

Mio:
Mugi...

Ritsu:
Yeah! Time to have some fun!

Yui:
Oh, yeah!

Mio:
Oh, that was fast!
What about practice?!

Yui:
We're gonna go on ahead, so you two hurry up and get changed!

Mio:
You still sure?

Tsumugi:
Y-Yes, I think...

Ritsu:
Hey!

Yui:
Hurry up!

Tsumugi:
Wait, I'll be right there!
Come on, Mio, shall we?

Mio:
Wait, you mean you're gonna go with them?

Tsumugi:
We may as well enjoy ourselves a little while we're here.
Right?

Mio:
But I thought we'd...

Ritsu:
Mugi, we're going!

Tsumugi:
Coming!

They'll all be waiting for you.

Mio:
Wait for me! I'm going, too!


-- EYE CATCH --


Yui:
It's been two weeks since we tragically washed ashore on this desert island...

Ritsu:
Yes, although I thought we were done for when we were cast adrift.

Yui:
Still, you gotta admit this is kind of fun in its own way.

Ritsu:
What a grand find...
Uh, seems we're saved...

Yui:
Tonight we feast.

Mio:
What kind of crazy scenario are you acting out?

Yui:
Mio, you're...

Mio:
Hm?

Ritsu:
Eat this!
Come on, Yui! Let's swim!

Yui:
Right!

Mio:
That hurt.
Then again...
Mm-hm, this sure is a pretty place.

Yui:
C'mon, tell me, what did you draw?

Tsumugi:
It just grew to this size before I knew it.

Mio:
I'm not scared, I'm not scared, I'm not scared, I'm not scared, I'm not scared, I'm not scared, I'm not scared, I'm not scared, I'm not scared...

Ritsu:
When you go to the doctor, your kneecaps will be covered with corn barnacles.

Yui:
I swallowed seawater...!

Ritsu:
We've made it at last to the golden island of Zipangu!

Mio:
The day's not over.

Ritsu:
Huh?
When did you get that?

Mio:
We're here at the beach and all, it's a beautiful day and if we don't live it up, what was the point of coming all this way and...
Ah! Practice!

Ritsu:
What? You forgot about that?

Mio:
It's all your fault, Ritsu, with your going on and on about goofing off.

Ritsu:
Oh, yeah, well, which of us do you think was having the most fun, huh?

Mio:
Uh...

Ritsu:
I'm so stuffed...

Yui:
The floor feels wonderfully nice and cool...
When you close your eyes, it almost feels like you're being carried far away out to sea by the ocean waves, doesn't it?

Ritsu:
Hey, you're right, it does...

Yui:
Good night, Ritchan...

Ritsu:
Yeah, you too...

Mio:
Hey, come on, guys.
We're starting!

Tsumugi:
You need to get up, you two!

Mio:
Hey, Mugi, stand back for a minute.

Ritsu:
Oh, come on, can we just call it a day.

Mio:
We came here to practice, so that's what we're gonna do!

Ritsu:
Yeah, but we're tired...

Mio:
I've been meaning to ask, have you been putting on a bit weight lately?

Ritsu:
Uh.

Mio:
Especially around your mid-section.

Ritsu:
Argh!

Mio:
Maybe it's because you haven't been playing the drums lately.

Ritsu:
Ahhh!

Yui:
I can't hold this anymore.

Mio:
Eh?

Yui:
This guitar feels like it weighs a ton.

Mio:
That's why I told you before you bought it that you should get a lighter one!

Yui:
Who was it that told me to buy this guitar?

Mio:
You did!

Yui:
The floor's warmed up, it's not as comfortable...

Ritsu:
Yeah...

Ritsu, Yui:
Roll, roll, roll...

Tsumugi:
Careful, you'll get dirty.

Yui:
This spot's nice and cool...

Mio:
How did you expect to play in the school festival if we don't practice?

Ritsu:
Oh, come on, I told you that we should do a maid cafe!

Yui:
I still think we should do a haunted house!

Mio:
Uh...

Ritsu:
Yui, you're not following me at all.
Look closely at Mio.

Mio:
W-What's this got to do with me?

Ritsu:
Let's face it, Mio.
There aren't many people in this world better suited to the maid look than you.

Yui:
Yeah.

Ritsu:
Black stockings! A lily-white apron!
And a maid headband!

Mio:
The adorable power of cute compels you! Love!

Ritsu:
And she'd have a catch phrase like that!

Yui:
That might be really cute!

Ritsu:
Just kidding. Relax!

Yui:
S-Squad Member Ritsu...


Mio:
When we're done with this, we're really gonna start practicing, got it?

Ritsu:
We know, we know!

Tsumugi:
Mm-hm.

Yui, Ritsu:
One, two!

Yui:
And now for our last number!
Let's do it!

Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
Huh? Wait, it's over already?

Ritsu:
Budget issues.

Tsumugi:
We'll do it again soon.

Ritsu:
Yeah, they're gonna be going off like crazy at our Budokan show, right?!

Yui:
Budokan show?

Ritsu:
Huh? That's what we have settled on as our goal, remember?
Right?

Yui:
In that case, I want the fireworks to be pink!

Ritsu:
Mm, what are you, a grade-schooler?

Yui:
Ooh, but it'd be cute!

Ritsu:
We'd look like a bunch of kids!

Tsumugi:
I think pink would be a little much, too.

Yui:
Aw, you really think so?

Mio:
If all we're going to do is try to play at the Budokan, then we need to get at least as good as this.

Ritsu:
Wow, they're good.

Yui:
Huh? I think I could play this song...

Death Devil:
I've been waiting for you people to arrive...
Now die!

Yui:
What was that?

Tsumugi:
The tape must have switched over to side B.

Ritsu:
Uh, all right. Hm?

Mio:
I'm not listening, I'm not listening, I'm not listening, I'm not listening, I'm not listening, I'm not listening...

Ritsu:
Scary ghosts...
In a scary haunted house!

Mio:
Stop it! Please... No more... Please...

Tsumugi:
Ritsu.

Yui:
You overdid it.

Ritsu:
Hmm...
Mio, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.

Yui:
You see, Mio. Everything's okay, now.

Tsumugi:
It wasn't a ghost on the tape.

Mio:
Really?

Yui, Ritsu:
Sparkly!
The power of cute compels you!

Ritsu:
I'm really sorry.

Tsumugi:
Hey, Yui, did you really mean what you said about that song?

Yui:
Yeah, watch this!
Let's see...

Ritsu:
No way...

Yui:
There! How was it?

Tsumugi:
Wow, that was perfect.

Yui:
Hehehe...
Thanks, but not quite.
I don't know how to make it go "myon".

Ritsu:
"Myon"?

Mio:
Wait a minute, I think you must be talking about choking.

Ritsu:
This choking?

Mio:
Guess again.

Mio:
Choking is when you pull on the strings to bend them and change the sound while a note is being played.
You do it like this.

Yui:
Oh, wow!

Mio:
See?

Yui:
Do this... and this?

Mio:
Yeah, that!

Yui:
That sounds funny!

Mio:
Funny how?

Ritsu:
Like a spook afraid of ghosts?

Mio:
Ghosts!


Yui:
I can't believe you even have an outdoor bath...

Tsumugi:
I certainly had a lot of fun today.

Mio:
Yeah. Maybe you were right, Mugi.
Maybe I should just try to relax a bit and not worry so much.

Ritsu:
Then we should've had a lot more fun!

Mio:
Who are you?!

Ritsu:
It's Ritsu!

Mio:
Well, your bangs are long.

Ritsu:
Got a problem with that?

Tsumugi:
They're long, but surprisingly cute.

Ritsu:
Oh, thanks! Wait a second, what do you mean by "surprisingly"?

Tsumugi:
Oh, I'm sorry.

Yui:
Hm...

Mio:
I think you're trying for this.

Yui:
Wow, you can tell? Amazing!

Mio:
Now, all you need to is stick out your ring finger.

Yui:
Oh, I get it!
Aw!

Mio:
A-Are you all right?

Yui:
Music is a wonderful thing, isn't it?
It was so much fun playing music together with everybody for the first time today.

Mio:
Yui...

Yui:
And I would've missed out on it if you hadn't suggested having a training camp.
Thanks, Mio-chan!

Mio:
Oh, well...

Ritsu:
It looks like Mio's all embarrassed.

Mio:
I am not! I'm red from the heat, that's all!

Ritsu:
You're not fooling anyone.

Mio:
You're wrong, all right?!
So, just drop it!

Ritsu:
Uh-oh, Mio's mad!

Mio:
Why, you... Come back here, darn it!

Ritsu:
Ooh, scary!

Mio:
Come back here!


Ritsu:
Is anyone home?!

Mio:
Coming! I'll be right there!
So, you said the pictures from the training camp are ready?

Ritsu:
Yep! Right here.

Mio:
Wow... Ah!

Ritsu:
That one turned out great.
Actually, I have that shot of M...

Mio:
Hand over the negatives now.

Ritsu:
I-It's a digital camera, there's no negatives...


Ritsu:
Come on, Mio! We're starting!

Mio:
Yeah, hang on!
I'll just be a minute!


-- Preview --

Nodoka:
Hm, I don't see it listed anywhere.

Yui:
Oh, no. You kidding...

Ritsu:
Wait, don't tell me...

Yui:
Miss Yamanaka, did you used to play the guitar?

Sawako:
No, but some friends of mine did.

Ritsu:
This was in a cardboard box you found the other day, Mio.
They look like pictures of an old Light Music Club.

Yui:
That's amazing!
And I knew you can do it, Nodoka!

Nodoka:
Who's your advisor?

Everyone:
Advisor?
