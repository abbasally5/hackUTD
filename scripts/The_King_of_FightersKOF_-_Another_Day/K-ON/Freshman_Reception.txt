  Ui:
Hello, I'm Ui Hirasawa.
My high school entrance exams are over.
And this spring, I'll be joining my sister Yui at...

Yui:
Ui!
W-Was your name there?

Ui:
What's the matter with you, Sis?
Why are you so nervous?

Yui:
Because...

Ui:
My name was there. I passed, Sis.

Yui:
Really?

Ui:
Mm-hm.

Ui:
Uh, Sis? I really can't breathe...

Yui:
You did so good!
You did great!

Yui:
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you so much! Thank you!

Yui:
It was thanks to the kind support of each of everyone of you here today
that Ui managed to pass and begin her duty to her happiest successful life!

Tsumugi:
Well, it looks like Ui passed.

Mio:
Looks like Yui is the happier of the two.

Ritsu:
A doting parent? Or a doting sister's more like it.

Ui:
It sure is shaping up to be a happy spring.

Tsumugi:
Congratulations, Ui!

Ritsu:
Yeah, way to go!

Ui:
Thank you, thank you everybody.

Azusa:
Um... There it is.

girl:
We're in the same class again!

girl:
Mr. Akai's our homeroom teacher?

girl:
I wonder if I'll be in the same class as Yoshiko-chan?

Yui:
And... there I am!
Second year, Class 2, huh?

Ritsu:
Yeah, so am I.

Tsumugi:
Oh, look, so am I, Class 2!

Yui:
R-Really? No way! That's great! How about you, Mio?

Mio:
Class 1...

Yui, Ritsu, Tsumugi:
Uh... umm...

Mio:
Hey, what's with those looks?

Ritsu:
If you ever get lonely, come over to visit whenever you want!

Mio:
What am I, a grade schooler?
Humph! Are you gonna be okay away from ME, huh?
You won't be able to crib off my homework!

Ritsu:
Ha! You don't have to worry about me!
I'll have Mugi with me to help me out.

Mio:
Humph.

Ui:
Hello, everyone.
A very good morning.

Ritsu:
The uniform looks great on you!

Tsumugi:
You look so innocent!

Ui:
Y-You really think so?

Ui:
Sis, your collar!
You left the tag from the dry-cleaner on.

Yui:
Oh. Wow, you're right!

Ui:
And also, you've got a bad case of bedhead.

Yui:
I didn't have time to brush it this morning.

Ui:
Let's try to get up a little earlier starting tomorrow, all right?

Ritsu:
You know, maybe you two would be much better off if you switched ages with each other.

Ui:
Uh, I'll see you later.

Ritsu:
I guess we should take off, too.

Yui:
Huh? Class-2 is up on the second floor?

Tsumugi:
That's right.

Ritsu:
It's like we're literally upperclassmen, now.
See you around, you Year 2, Floor 1, Class 1 student, you.

Mio:
Oh yah, bite me.

Tsumugi:
We'll see you at break!

Yui:
Where on the second floor is it?

Ritsu:
I think it's somewhere around.

Mio:
I'm lonely...
There isn't a single girl here that I know...

Nodoka:
Mio! Glad to see you!

I was worried I wouldn't know anyone when I was put in a different class than Yui.

Here's hoping for a good year together.

Mio:
Same here!


-- #8: Freshmen Reception! --


student:
Wanna join the Basketball Club?

student:
And the Tea Ceremony Club really is a lot of fun.

student:
Consider the Occult studies Club.

student:
Are you interested in ping pong?

Yui:
Wow, look at this, the halls are packed already.

Tsumugi:
Large clubs certainly have more recruiting options.

Ritsu:
Don't ever underestimate the Light Music Club.
Mio, got the flyers?

Mio:
Well, I kinda threw this together.

Ritsu:
Mm, kinda is right.

Ritsu:
It lacks any selling points.

Tsumugi:
What exactly are our selling points.

Ritsu:
Something like...
"Come and join the Light Music Club, where you'll get all the tea and snack you want and get to sleep!"

Yui:
That sounds great!

Mio:
No it doesn't!

Ritsu:
Well, do you have any better ideas?
'Cause the way it is now, it's got no impact!

Sawako:
If it doesn't, we'll just give it some!


Mio:
We're the Light Music Club...

Tsumugi:
We're holding a performance to welcome new students, meow.
Please be sure to come, meow.

Ritsu:
If you are interested, come to the music room after school, woof woof woof!

Yui:
There's also lots of yummy snacks, cock-ah!

Yui:
Uh, Mio-chan...

Mio:
W-What is it?

Yui:
It's doing the opposite of what we wanted.

Mio:
Yeah, that just occurred to me, too.

Yui:
Oh, really?

Student:
Yeah, so, what club do you think I should join?

Ui:
It's a tough choice, huh?

Student:
Mm-hm.

Yui:
Ui!

Ui:
Big Sis?

Ui:
Ughhhhh! Eeeeeeek!

Yui:
Ui...

Azusa:
What was that?

Student:
Beats me.

Mio:
We're the Light Music Club.
If you're interested, feel free to come by the Music Prep Room on the third floor after school.

Azusa:
Sure...

Azusa:
What the heck?

Mio:
You know you shouldn't run at people like that.

Yui:
Yeah I'm sorry.

Ritsu:
Oh man, these things are way too hot...

Tsumugi:
I think it's fun.
Like we're working at a part-time job.

Yui:
You sure do like working Mugi-chan.

Student:
Come on Azusa, let's go.

Azusa:
Uh-huh.

Yui:
After all that sweating, we hardly had any takers.

Ritsu:
We'll just have to make up for it at tomorrow's performance.

Yui:
You're right.

Sawako:
Excuse me, but I made all these outfits for you, too.

Ritsu:
Yeah, well, afternoon classes are starting.

Student:
The Light Music Club?

Jun:
Yeah, all the girls came across as being pretty cool.
Wanna check them out?

Student:
No thanks, so I'll pass. See ya.

Jun:
What's gotten into her? You'll come, right?

Ui:
Sure, I guess. I'll go with you.

Jun:
Then let's go.

Student:
Azusa, jazz Appreciation is having a welcome meeting in their club room up stairs, let's go!

Azusa:
Uh... mm.

Ui:
Here it is.
Excuse us. May we come in?

Yui:
Welcome to our club room!

Ui:
Uh... Big Sis?

Ritsu:
Oh, Ui!

Tsumugi:
You're joining the Light Music Club?

Ui:
Wait! You two are dressed up, too?

Mio:
Help me!

Sawako:
I'm sorry.
Step aside, Please!

Ritsu:
Come in, come in. It's so good to see you, welcome to our club!

Ui:
U-Uh...
First, could you explain what that was?

Student:
As I recall, it's supposed to be two doors down from the Occult Studies Club.

Mio:
Eeeeeeeeek.

Azusa:
I wonder what's up there?

Student:
I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's the Music Room.

Azusa:
The Music Room, huh?

Yui:
Ever since Christmas, it's like Miss Yamanaka has gotten totally addicted to putting us in different costumes.

Ui:
I see.
Oh, I nearly forgot, this is Yui.
She is my big sister.

Yui:
I'm Yui Hirasawa. If you wait just a minute, I'll go get you some nice tasty tea.
It's okay to take this one, isn't it?

Tsumugi:
It's pretty hot, so be careful, okay?

Yui:
Ow!

Tsumugi:
Are you all right?

Ui:
S-Sis, are you okay?

Ui:
You just have a seat, Big Sis.
I'll take it from here.

Yui:
Are you sure?

Ritsu:
Oh, Yui...

Ui:
Let me introduce Ritsu.

Ritsu:
Hi there, I'm the club president, Ritsu Tainaka.

Nodoka:
Darn it, Ritsu!

Jun:
She seems really cool.

Nodoka:
You still haven't submitted your request form to use the school auditorium!
If you don't, you won't be able to perform tomorrow.

Ritsu:
Oh, you're right...

Nodoka:
I swear, how many times do I have to tell you.

Ritsu:
Sorry. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

Ui:
I want you to meet Tsumugi Kotobuki.

Tsumugi:
It's a pleasure to meet you.

Jun:
And you, too.

Tsumugi:
I'm so sorry for all the drama.

Ritsu:
Wait, wait!

Jun:
She seems like She's really nice.

Nodoka:
And what's with these silly getups, anyway?

Ritsu:
Hey, they weren't my idea!

Tsumugi:
Oh, my, Ritsu...

Ui:
Huh?

Ui:
And last but not least is, uh...

Jun:
Her?

Ui:
Yeah, her name is Mio Akiyama.
It's just that she gets embarrassed really easily.

Ritsu:
Huh?
What's the deal, Mio?
Quit hiding out there and come on in and join the rest of us.

Mio:
No way. You'll laugh at me.

Ui:
No, we won't laugh.
It looks great on you.

Mio:
Y-You... um... You really mean it?

Ui, Jun:
She's so cute!

Ui:
Uh...

Sawako:
Hmm... Hmm...

Jun:
Um... Ui, who's this lady?

Ui:
This is Miss Yamanaka.
She's their faculty advisor.

Sawako:
You two...

Ui, Jun:
Yes?

Sawako:
Care to try on?

Ui, Jun:
No thank you.

Student:
Please consider joining us.

Azusa, Student:
Thank you very much, we will.

Student:
So, what did you think?

Azusa:
Hmm, well, it didn't quite seem the same as real jazz if you know what I mean.

Student:
It didn't, huh?

Student:
Hey, why did you stop?

Azusa:
That reminds me...

-- Eye-catch --

Jun:
Wow, they look kinda cool!

Ui:
Now they finally look like a Light Music Club.

Yui:
Mio-chan, my strap is caught on my shoulder.

Mio:
Yeah, mine is, too.

Ritsu:
And I can't move in this skirt...

Tsumugi:
Yeah, these sleeves are...
No, I guess they're fine.

Ritsu:
Dah!
I can't play like this.

Mio:
Whose bright idea was it to wear maid outfits?!

Tsumugi:
We decided to change into track suits.

Ritsu:
Okay, here I come!

Yui:
Ready!

Ritsu:
Yeah! ha ha ha!
You're next, Mugi! Go on!

Tsumugi:
Right!

Mio:
What do you think you're doing?!

Ritsu:
Okay, why don't we get started, then.

Yui:
Mm.

Jun:
That was awesome.

Ui:
They're cool, but not those track suits...

Student:
You really going?
They were the ones in those animal costumes, remember?

Azusa:
I'm just gonna take a quick peek.

Azusa:
Track suits?

Student:
Hey, isn't that Ui Hirasawa?
She's in our class.
It's almost like she doesn't wanna be there...

Azusa:
Maybe they don't take things seriously in this club.

Yui:
Um, we're really sorry we didn't give you a full-on proper performance.

Mio:
We normally go all-out when we play.

Yui:
Really? We do that?

Mio:
Of course, we do!

Tsumugi:
In any event, we'll be performing four songs tomorrow.
So, be sure to come.

Ritsu:
We'll wanna hear your unvarnished opinion!

Jun:
Sure, I'll do that...

Ui:
Uh... Well, I guess we should get going then.
I'll see you later on back at home, Big Sis.

Yui:
Sure thing, Ui.

Ui:
So, what did you think?

Jun:
Um, well, they're certainly incredible in many ways.

Ui:
You think so?

Jun:
Oh, and that cake we had was really good!

Ui:
Yeah, it was, wasn't it?

Ui:
Um... Listen, I...

Jun:
I'm sorry, I have to go to the bathroom!
Go on without me. 'Bye.

Ui:
Their prospects are looking grim...

Yui:
What did she think?
What did she think?

Ui:
She said, Uh, she thought it was incredible.

Yui:
Wasn't it, though?
She'll come tomorrow, too, right?

Ui:
Yeah, probably...

Yui:
The Light Music Club is really a blast!

Ui:
Yeah.

Ui:
Hey, Big Sis?

Yui:
Yeah.

Ui:
What do you think is the best thing about the Light Music Club?

Yui:
Huh?
Well, let me think a second...
I guess it's how much fun it is.

Ui:
Fun in what way?

Yui:
I don't know. Fun is fun.
Ah, do you wanna join, too, Ui?
Our goal is to play the Budokan!

Ui:
I'll think about it.

Ui:
Now that I do think about it, Sis has been really energetic ever since she joined the club.
Until a little while ago, she...

Yui:
Ui... ice cream...

Ui:
That's after you've had dinner!

Yui:
I want ice cream, ice cream...!

Ui:
But now, she's really focused and working hard.

Yui:
Ui?

Ui:
Yes, Sis?

Yui:
I really wanna have ice cream.

Ui:
After you've had your dinner.
In some ways she's the same as ever, though...

Mio:
It's packed out there!

Ritsu:
Well, it is supposed to be the welcome party for all the new students.

Tsumugi:
If we play like we always do, we'll be fine.

Mio:
B-But we don't...

Ritsu:
You're still not over your stage fright, huh?

Yui:
Ritchan!
I just found a one dollar coin!

Ritsu:
I wish you would be more nervous.

Mio:
The order is Fuwa Fuwa Time,
Curry, Then Rice,
My Love Is A Stapler,
Brush Pen, Ballpoint Pen.

Ritsu:
Your taste in song titles is as unique as I've ever seen.

Mio:
Really?

Yui:
So, do you really want me to sing all of vocals today?

Ritsu:
That's right, we never decided on that.
I've got it.
Since we're lucky enough to have two singers, I think that you should do at least one song today, Mio.
C'mon, high five!

Mio:
No way! Forget it! I can't!

Yui:
Oh, Mio...

Ritsu:
But everybody loved you singing in our last show.

Mio:
Forget it!

Ritsu:
Come on, accidents like that don't happen twice.

Mio:
No!

Tsumugi:
But, Mio...

Mio:
Ugh!

Yui:
Mio-chan...

Mio:
No!

Yui:
You want ramen?

Mio:
No!

Tsumugi:
So then, no gyoza?

Mio:
No!

Ritsu:
Boy, that's one serious rejection response.

Sawako:
I guess we have no choice.
We'll have to let Yui handle everything.

Student:
Next up is a club introduction and performance by the Light Music Club.

Ritsu:
Looks like we're on.

Sawako:
Break a leg.
And I have just one last word for you all before I go.

Ritsu:
What is it?

Sawako:
Uniforms as costumes are great!

Ritsu:
Would you please clear off the stage now?

Ui:
Really? You've decided?

Jun:
Yeah, the Jazz Appreciation Club has some cool upperclassmen in it.
I'm sorry.

Ui:
Well, if that's the club you wanna be in, then that's the club you should join.
It's your decision after all.

Jun:
See you.

Ui:
Uh, excuse me.

Azusa:
Uh...

Ui:
Sorry to drag you with me like this.
Oh, wow, it really is packed in here.
Wow, my sister is on vocals today.

Ui:
Hi, we're the Light...
The Light Music Club.
To all you new students out there, congratulations on getting into our school.
When I first heard about the Light Music Club, I thought all they did was playing light hearted music.

Ritsu:
Yui's banter is doing a good job putting everybody at ease.

Yui:
I signed up without giving it much thought, thinking I could just play castanets or something simple like that.
So I hope all of you think about joining up with the same carefree attitude!
But you know, Miss Yamanaka told me one day that castanets are actually really hard to play.
Here's our next song.

Ritsu:
'Bout time...

Yui:
Oh, Miss Yamanaka is our advisor and the music teacher here.

Ritsu:
What are we, a comedy band?!

Yui:
Sorry, Ritchan.
Anyway, here's our next song, "My Love Is A Stapler"!

Mio:
That riff is tough, and she's pulling it off perfectly, except for... Yui, sing!

Yui:
Uh, I forgot the lyrics!

Yui:
Mio-chan!

Mio:
Hurry up and sing!

Tsumugi:
Excuse me girls, you know, no one is going to come in with you glaring out the door like that.

Yui:
Aw, but the crowd at the show was so psyched about us!

Ritsu:
Impossible not a single person showed up!

Yui:
Oh, you don't think it's because of the way I messed up, do you?

Mio:
You know, maybe it's because we have such a low membership in our club.

Tsumugi:
Come on now, the tea is ready.

Ritsu:
I suppose we're just gonna have to go and nab up Ui.

Mio:
[Here] the poor girl isn't a bug.

Azusa:
Pardon me.

Yui:
Uh, yes.

Azusa:
I'm very interested in joining your club.

Yui:
Uh, would you mind repeating that?

Azusa:
I'd like to join the club.

Ritsu:
We got one!

Ui:
Good for you, Big Sis!

-- Preview --

Azusa:
Um, what's this?

Sawako:
It's a pair of cat ears, obviously.

Azusa:
No, I knew that. But uh...
What am I supposed to do with them?
I wonder if they're testing me to see how independent I am.

Yui:
Okay, it's your turn, next, Azusa-chan.

Azusa:
Um, my name's Azusa Nakano, year 1, class 2.
I look forward to our time together.
