  Azusa:
I never suspected that the Light Music Club...
would face a crisis of these proportions...
so soon before the School Festival.

Ritsu:
You sure are in a good mood, Azusa.

Azusa:
I get happy when I think about actually playing a live show at the festival.

Ritsu:
Oh, that's really cute!

Azusa:
I wish I could see you play at last year's festival.

Ritsu:
Yeah, guess you put on a pretty big show last year, didn't you, Mio?
She tripped while she was up on stage...

Sawako:
Hey, I just happen to have a recording of their last year show.

Azusa:
I wanna see! I wanna see!

Mio:
Are you sure you won't reconsider, Azusa?

Sawako:
Yui, Ritsu.

Mio:
Wait! No. Let go...

Sawako:
Now, let's start with the primo scene.

Mio:
Don't look, Azusa!
It's too dangerous! You'll be cursed!

Azusa:
I can't unsee it.

Mio:
I was too late...


-- #11: Crisis!? --


Azusa:
It's pretty weird.
You guys seem to only play incredibly well during live performances.

Ritsu:
Oh, look at you, offering up opinions and everything!
Head lock!

Yui:
(chuckle)

Tsumugi:
What is it, Yui?

Yui:
This is bringing back a lot of fun memories.

Tsumugi:
As I recall, you (grided) your voice just before we did this show.

Yui:
Yeah! My voice was all scratchy when I woke up that morning.

Tsumugi:
That's right.
So Mio took over --

Ritsu:
This would be your first show as a member of the Light Music Club.

Azusa:
Yeah! I'm gonna give it all I've got!

Nodoka:
Sorry to interrupt when you're having such a good time.

Mio:
Oh, Nodoka! What's going on?

Nodoka:
Don't act like you don't know.
This!.

Ritsu:
Auditorium Use Application...

Nodoka:
Right.
You haven't submitted one for the School Festival.

Ritsu:
Oh, I completely forgot.

Azusa:
Don't be so nonchalant!

Ritsu:
Things've been kinda hectic, so it slipped my mind.

Nodoka:
The same thing happened last year.

Ritsu:
Actually, that was the Club Application...
Ow!

Ritsu:
Okay, Azusa, you be the secretary.

Azusa:
Me? Well, I guess I don't mind.
Let's see, ''Applicant'' is Light Music Club...
So, what do I put down for Name?

Ritsu:
The band name, I guess.

Azusa:
Right.
Now that you mention it, what is the band's name?

Ritsu, Yui, Mio:
The Girls Gang! Smile and Sweets! Chocolate Melody!

Azusa:
They're all different!

Tsumugi:
We never settled on one.

Ritsu:
Then it's the perfect time to pick a name!

Yui:
I got it! How about 'Yui Hirasawa and the Bumbling Sisters?'

Ritsu:
What are we, chopped liver?

Mio:
How about something like 'Pure Pure'?

Ritsu:
Ah, enough with the jokes, let's be serious about this.

Mio:
But I was being serious...

Ritsu:
You really meant that?!

Azusa:
Well, everyone has different tastes.
Doesn't make that wrong?

Sawako:
All right, then!
I'll choose the band name!

Everyone:
I think we should all give it a little more thought!

Azusa:
They pulled together...

Nodoka:
Just bring the paperwork to the Student Council Office when you're done.

Mio:
I'm sorry we made you wait for nothing.

Nodoka:
It's all right.

Yui:
Nodoka-chan, why don't you and I stop'n grab some tea on the way home!

Nodoka:
Sure, Yui, I'll text you later.

Ritsu:
Okay, why don't we all just sleep on the band name tonight and get to practicing our set for the show now?

Tsumugi:
I agree.

Mio:
The Festival's soon, so we have to give it 110%.

Azusa:
I will!

Yui:
Oh, sound!
My guitar hasn't really been sounding quite right lately.

Azusa:
You want me to take a quick look at it?

Azusa:
These strings are all clouded!
When was the last time you changed them out for new ones, Yui?

Yui:
You mean you're supposed to change the strings?

Everyone:
What?

Azusa:
Plus, the neck is warped.
Didn't you know that a warped guitar neck'll completely throw off the octave tuning!

Yui:
Neck? Octa...?

Mio:
Calm down, Azusa!
This is way too much for Yui to digest!

Azusa:
Basically, you have to take really good care of your instrument.
This is a beautiful guitar!

Yui:
But I do take good care of it!
I sleep with it every night, I dress it up nice!

Azusa:
That's not what I mean by â€˜taking care of it!'

Yui:
In that case, is there anything you can do to fix it, Miss. Yamanaka?

Sawako:
Gah, I think you'd be better off taking it to the music store, don't you?

Ritsu:
You just can't be bothered.

Azusa:
You and I better just go to the music store, then.

Yui:
It isn't that serious, is it?

Azusa:
The festival's coming up, and we can't practice with your guitar and the shape it's in!

Yui:
Ritchan, you don't do any upkeep on your drums, do you?

Ritsu:
Yes, I do!
And even if I didn't, don't make it sound like a foregone conclusion that I don't.

Yui:
It is you we're talking about...
Ow!

Ritsu:
Okay, here we are.

Mio:
Hey, I'll wait for you guys out here, okay?

Azusa:
But, why aren't you coming inside?

Mio:
You see the thing is I'm a lefty, so looking at all those right handed instruments would only make me sad.

Tsumugi, Azusa:
Ah.

Ritsu:
Hey Mio, check this out!
It says here that they're having a Lefty Fair today.

Mio:
Aha... Have I died and gone to heaven?
C-Clerk! I want you to give me everything you have on display here!

Ritsu:
Hey Mio, get a grip, girl.

Yui:
Boy, Mio-chan sure looks happy.

Azusa:
That's 'cause there's not a lot of models made for lefties.
So you wanna just go on without them?

Yui:
Mm-hm.

Azusa:
Excuse us!

Clerk1:
How can I help you?

Azusa:
We were wandering if you could make some adjustment on a guitar for us.

Clerk1:
Yeah, sure thing.
On which guitar?

Azusa:
This one.

Clerk1:
Ah.
Well, why don't we have a look at it and see what we've got.
Um, ah, is this a vintage guitar?

Azusa:
No, we're sorry.
It's just kinda dirty.
That's all.

Yui:
It's been a year since I bought it!

Clerk1:
I-I see...
Well, feel free to wait in the store until I'm finished with it.

Azusa:
Thank you very much.
Well, let's browse around the store until he's done.
Hey, what's the matter, Yui?

Yui:
My poor guitar is being stripped naked bit by bit!

Azusa:
What are you talking about?
I'm curious about something, Yui?
Why did you buy that guitar in the first place?
I mean, look at it.
It's heavy, and it's got a thick neck.
It's got all sorts of quirks.

Yui:
I got it because it's cute!

Azusa:
Because it's cute?

Yui:
Yeah, that's right.
Huh? You do think it's cute, don't you, Azusa?

Azusa:
I just don't get Yui-senpai's tastes.

Azusa:
Sorry we kept you waiting!
We dropped it off to have them do some maintenance.

Ritsu:
Right, good deal.

Azusa:
Wait a minute.
Where did Mio-senpai go?

Tsumugi:
Oh, Mio is still over there checking out...

Clerk2:
Miss Kotobuki!
It's so good to see you again, Miss!

Tsumugi:
Oh, hello.

Clerk3:
Hey! If it isn't Miss Kotobuki!
It's been way too long!

Ritsu:
Mugi says that this shop is part of her family's business consortium.

Azusa:
Ah...

Yui:
It's always a shock to hear someone call her that, isn't it?

Clerk1:
Thank you for waiting.

Ritsu:
It's all clean again!

Azusa:
Make sure you keep it maintained from now on.

Yui:
Geeta!

Ritsu:
She named the thing...

Yui:
Oh, thank you so much, sir!

Clerk1:
D-Don't mention it.
So, ah, the bill comes to $50.

Yui:
Huh? You charge for this?

Clerk1:
Um, y-yes.

Azusa:
Well, of course they charge for it!

Yui:
I have no money.
What do I do?

Tsumugi:
What's the matter?

Azusa:
Well, it looks like Yui-senpai didn't know that music stores charge for maintenance work.

Tsumugi:
Oh, she didn't, huh? Oh, goodness.
Did I bring any pocket money?


Clerk2:
O-Oh, M-Miss, no! Perish the thought! Consider it on the house!

Everyone:
Eh?

Tsumugi:
No, I couldn't possibly!

Clerk2:
Please, think nothing of it!
We're constantly in your father's debt!

Tsumugi:
B-But I...


Clerk2:
I insist!
Please, this is on the house!

Ritsu:
Well, looks like you just lucked out.

Ritsu:
That's that, then! What do you say we all get going?

Yui, Azusa:
Yeah!

Azusa:
Um...
Aren't we forgetting Mio-senpai?

Ritsu:
Yeah, I'll go call her.
Mio! Come on, it's time to go.

Mio:
Don't wanna.

Ritsu:
Are you a grade schooler?
Look, everybody's waiting for you and we have to get back.

Mio:
Don't wanna.

Ritsu:
Sheesh! Come on, Mio, let's go!

Mio:
Hey! Ritsu!

Ritsu:
It's time to go home now, Mio.

Mio:
I said I don't wanna go!

Azusa:
I know this one person who actually likes to string his guitar in reverse order.

Yui:
Ho.

Ritsu:
Too bad, we're going.
And that's that

Mio:
Hey, wait! Watch it!

Ritsu:
Ah...
Hey, what'cha doing down there, Mio?

Mio:
Enough, already!
You jerk.

Yui:
Thank goodness, Geeta is all pretty again!

Mio:
You gave your guitar a name, huh?
That's nice.

Tsumugi:
So, what do you want to do now?

Ritsu:
Good question...
Hey, how about going for tea?!

Azusa:
Tea again?
Really?

Yui:
Sorry, guys!
But I'm supposed to get together with Nodoka-chan right now.

Ritsu:
Ah.

Mio:
You gonna see Nodoka? Can I tag along?

Yui:
Oh, that's right!
You and Nodoka-chan are in the same class together, aren't you?
Sure.

Mio:
Really?

Yui: I'm just gonna give her a call and let her know you're coming.

Mio:
Great, thanks!

Ritsu:
Um...

-- Eye Catch --


Yui:
Oh, I always wanted to try out this place!

Mio:
But you have no money?

Nodoka:
It's okay.
I'll pay for Yui's share.

Yui:
When I get next month's allowance, we'll all go out and it'll all be on me, how's that?!

Nodoka:
I'll hold you to that.
So, is Yui really doing all right at the Light Music Club like she says?

Mio:
Yeah! But, whenever she learns one thing, she has a tendency to completely forget something else.

Nodoka:
I know how it is.
But when she's focused on something, she can do amazing things.

Mio:
That's for sure.


Nodoka:
She can be a real handful, can't she?

Yui:
Huh?
What'cha talking about?

Ritsu:
Duh! Those two sure seem to be having a good time together.

Azusa:
More to the point, why are we sneaking around like this?

Tsumugi:
It's like for private investigators, isn't it?

Ritsu:
That's it!
I'm going in.

Mio:
And then the teacher came up to me and ---

Ritsu:
Well, you two sure seem really friendly!
Hey!

Mio:
Ritsu?
What are you doing here?

Ritsu:
Oh, I just happened to be here.

Yui:
Did you come here all by yourself?

Ritsu:
Nope, Mugi and Azusa're sitting over there.

Yui:
Ha? Hey, they are!

Ritsu:
Oh, gosh!
Thank you for taking such good care of our little Mio!

Mio:
Ritsu?

Ritsu:
What? You want me to leave?

Mio:
Well, no, I don't, but I â€¦

Ritsu:
Then what's the problem?
Oo, what's that?
What did you get?

Tsumugi:
What's she doing?
Her ice cream is melting...


Mio:
Wow, that's a gorgeous boxed lunch!

Nodoka:
No, it's not.
I just threw together whatever I had lying around.

Mio:
You mean you make your own?
That's amazing!

Nodoka:
Oh, come on.
It's no big deal, really.

Mio:
No, mine are always ---

Ritsu:
Okay, lunchtime is over!

Mio:
Ah? Ritsu?
Sorry, but I just started eating.

Ritsu:
We're practicing through every lunch break from now until the school festival!

Mio:
Ahâ€¦


Ritsu:
Gee, I wonder what Mio's gonna do to liven things up at this year's big school festival concert?
She gave the crowd that panty shot last year, so maybe she'll show them her belly button this time?
Ooh. Or maybe ---

Mio:
I thought we were gonna practice!

Ritsu:
And we will!

Mio:
Then why are you ---

Ritsu:
Takoyaki!
Ponytail!

Mio:
Hey!

Ritsu:
Braids!

Mio:
Come on, cut it out!
What's gotten into you?

Ritsu:
Oh, guess what I brought!
A great horror movie!
So scary, It'll make your hair stand up.

Mio:
This is stupid.
I'm going back to my classroom.

Ritsu:
All right.
Suit yourself.
Gosh, I'm so sorry I interrupted your wonderfully pleasant lunchtime with Nodoka, your brand new best friend.

Mio:
Who said anything about that?!

Yui:
Ahâ€¦ I don't get it why they're fighting?

Tsumugi:
How about some tea?
Let's have some tea!
All right?
I brought some lovely tarts today.

Azusa:
What should I do?

Tsumugi:
All right?

Azusa:
I have to do something!
Anything!
L-Let's all be friends and practice together like we planned!
I-It didn't work!

Ritsu:
Yeah, I guess we should practice.

Mio:
Let's get started.

Azusa:
S-Sure!
All right!

Ritsu:
One, two!

Mio:
Ritsu?
What gives? I'm glad that your drumming isn't as wild as usual but don't you think it's a little weak?
Ritsu?
Ritsu, what is it?

Ritsu:
Aw, sorry.
I'm just not feeling it right now.
Let's try it again after school.

Yui:
R-Ritchan!

Mio:
Let her go, Yui.

Yui:
But she ---

Mio:
Twerp.


Azusa:
I guess Ritsu isn't coming.
She didn't come after school yesterday, either.

Yui:
I wonder what's wrong?

Sawako:
I'd say it was because Mio has been being so cold to her.
For the sake of the Light Music Club, you need to be Ritsu's plaything for at least today!
If you don't, Ritsu's heart will grow hardened.

Ritsu:
Hey mister!
A jumbo!

Sawako:
And she'll order a jumbo beef bowl she knows she can't finish.

Ritsu:
What am I doing?

Sawako:
She'll be driven to despair and she'll go so far down the path of heavy metal, she'll never find her way back!

Yui:
That's what happened to you when you got dumped by your boyfriend, isn't it?

Sawako:
Pardon?

Azusa:
What if she decides not to come back to the club any more?
What'll happen to our concert at the school festival?

Mio:
Come on, let's practice.

Yui:
You mean, without Ritchan?

Mio:
What else can we do?

Azusa:
But shouldn't we go ask her to join us first?

Sawako:
You could start looking for a replacement.
Now, I'm just saying that it's always a good idea to be prepared.

Yui:
But...

Tsumugi:
There's no replacing Ritchan!

Yui:
Mugi-chan...

Tsumugi:
Let's just wait.
Let's wait for Ritsu to come back to us.
I know she'll come.
I know it.


Tsumugi:
Mio!

Yui:
Mugi-chan, you're right!

Mio:
Oh, uhâ€¦ Good morning.

Yui:
Listen Mio, about Ritchan, she isâ€¦

Mio:
Look, I..
I didn't come here to check up on Ritsu, I, uh...

Tsumugi:
She's been staying home from school.


Ritsu:
Mio...

Mio:
So, now you have ESP?

Ritsu:
I think I can recognize your footsteps.

Mio:
How's the cold?

Ritsu:
I still have a bit of a fever.

Mio:
I guess that explains why your drumming sounded so weak.

Ritsu:
Heck of a time to get sick, right before the festival...

Mio:
You just get better quick, okay?
We're waiting for you to come back.

Ritsu:
They're not mad?

Mio:
They're not.

Ritsu:
Are you?

Mio:
Of course, not.
How can I be mad at you?
It's just...

Ritsu:
Just what?

Mio:
Without you there drumming, I guess it's kinda lonely.
Even though you're pretty wild, I really like how your drumming is always so full of energy and powerful.

Mio:
Ritsu!
Were you --

Ritsu:
Hooray, I'm cured!
Achoo!

Mio:
Oh, Ritsu, you are not!
Come on now, lie down.
You still have a fever.
I'm going home, okay?

Ritsu:
Hoâ€¦ Come on, don't go yet.
Stay until I fall asleep, pleaseâ€¦

Mio:
Oh, good grief.


Yui:
Excuse us.
Can we come in?
Ritchan, how are you do ---

Mio:
Shh! I was finally able to get her to go to sleep.

Mio:
Umâ€¦ Why did Yui fall asleep, too?
Oh, good grief...


Ritsu:
I'm back!
Now, let's bust our butts to get ready for the festival!

Everyone:
Yeah!

Nodoka:
Hey!
You guys didn't submit your auditorium use permission form?!

Ritsu:
Huh?

Yui, Ritsu, Azusa:
Ahh!


Ritsu:
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

Student Council Staff:
A deadline is a deadline, you know.

Ritsu:
Could you bend the rules?

Nodoka:
I'd like to appeal on their behalf.
They missed submission deadline because the club president was home sick with a cold.
Please make it an exception?!

Student Council Staff:
Well, if you feel this strongly, Miss Manabe...
You have until the end of the day.

Everyone:
Ah!

Ritsu:
Ohâ€¦ Oh, you...
You're a good egg, ain'tcha!
Please look after Mio!
And please, while you're at it, you can look after me from now on, too, right?


Mio:
So, what's wrong with Pure Pure?

Ritsu:
Rejected.

Yui:
How about Clenched Fist?

Ritsu:
Too balladry.

Yui:
How about "Gum On the Sole of My Shoe"?

Ritsu:
You stepped in some, didn't you?

Yui:
Oh! How did you know?

Ritsu:
Mugi, don't you have any good ones?

Tsumugi:
How about something like Recharging Time?

Ritsu:
Sounds like bad luck!

Mio:
How about Popcorn Honeymoon?

Ritsu:
Oh! Come on, guys, what's with all these silly cutesy names?

Yui:
What do you think of Rocket Pencil?

Ritsu:
Could you hush?

Sawako:
God, this is annoying!
I can't even enjoy a nice cup of tea!
For stuff like this, just pick something at random!
All done!

Everyone:
Eh! She decided it on her own!

Ritsu:
What the heck.

Everyone:
All Right!
We've settled on a band name!

Azusa:
All that's left for us now is to practice hard for the School Festival concert.

Yui:
Achoo!

Everyone:
Maybe not...

-- Preview --

Azusa:
So, her fever hasn't gone down yet...

Ui:
No.
If this keeps up tomorrow, the show is in danger.

Ritsu:
Getting sick at a time like this just shows her lack of dedication!

Mio:
You're the one who gave it to her!

Ritsu:
Oh, I did?

Ui:
Oh, Big Sis!

Sawako:
You may fool the others, but you can't fool me.
