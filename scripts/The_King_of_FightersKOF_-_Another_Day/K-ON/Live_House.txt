  Yui:
A live house?

Ritsu:
Yeah, Yeah! An old friend of mine from back in middle school invited us to come and play a show there.

Yui:
Oh!

Mio:
This says here that the show is on New Year's Eve.
That's only ten days from now.

Azusa:
But we really don't have anything ready.

Yui:
Aw, but it sounds like fun!
I'd really love to give it a shot!

Ritsu:
Me too!

Yui:
Mm-hm.

Mio:
I don't know if I can handle playing in front of a big crowd again...

Ritsu:
Mio! You know, if you keep talking like that, you're never gonna grow as a musician!

Yui:
You look really cool when you play your bass, Mio.

Mio:
Well, then, let's decide it by majority rule.
Who wants to pass on the show?

Azusa:
Ritsu-senpai, Yui-senpai, I'm sorry.

Ritsu:
Huh! Such impudence!
All those in favor of playing!

Yui:
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

Tsumugi:
Yes!

Azusa:
Mugi-senpai?!

Mio:
But, Mugi, I thought you had a big trip plan for the end of the year.

Tsumugi:
Yes, but an opportunity like this doesn't come along very often.
And besides... I really think it would be absolutely wonderful for all of us to play a big show together on the very last day of the year.

Mio:
Mugi...
She has a point...

Azusa:
I can't disappoint Mugi-senpai.

Azusa:
Um...

Mio:
We change our votes to "yes."

Ritsu:
Sweet! That settles it, we're playing a show!

Yui:
Yahoo!

Ritsu:
We're in it to win it!

Yui:
And that is how we all decided to play our first show together at a real live house.
I'm so excited!


-- (OP) --


Yui:
He's so cute!
Christmas is just around the corner, isn't it?

Ritsu:
C'mon, let's go.

Yui:
Coming!

Yui:
Whoa! So this is a live house, huh?

Tsumugi:
I'm nervous for some reason.

Yui:
Y-Yeah...

Ritsu:
Hey, now, don't sweat it!
Hello? Anybody here?

Kawakami:
Just minute!
Yes, can I help you?

Ritsu:
Um, well, we've come to apply to play the big show!
We're After-school Teatime!

Kawakami:
Oh, I've heard good things about you. Love Crisis' Maki-chan referred you, right?

Yui:
Love Crisis?
Oh, man, They have a really cool name!
Hey, Ritchan, doesn't our band name seem a little bit too warm and fuzzy compared to theirs?

Kawakami:
After-school Teatime, huh?
What a cute name. I like it.

Yui:
She complimented us on it!


-- #Bonus Episode: Live House! --


Ritsu:
So, that's what we sound like...

Kawakami:
Hm, all right, then, would you mind filling out this application form?

Ritsu:
Okay!

Kawakami:
Let's see... On the day of the show, you have to arrive at 1PM.

Ritsu:
Wow, that's pretty early...

Kawakami:
Because of rehearsals.
Each band will get 15 minutes.
Meeting at 3PM. Doors open at 4PM. Show starts at 5PM. Got it?

Ritsu:
Um, Sure!

Kawakami:
Also, (as for what gear you'll be bringing,
...you'll need to fill out a basic itemized list beforehand.
You can fill that out later.)

Ritsu:
Even if I forget, I'm sure the guys will--
Ow!

Mio:
So this is a ticket for our show...

Yui:
Wow, I guess you have to pay to be let in...

Ritsu:
They're not listening!

Kawakami:
Come on, I'll show you around the club.
This is the dressing room.

Yui:
Dressing room?!
Wow, this is?!

Tsumugi:
Excuse me, would it be all right if we put up a shop curtain?
Come in!

Yui:
Whoa! That would be so cool, Mugi-chan!

Tsumugi:
Wouldn't it, though?

Kawakami:
You know, all of the other bands will be using the room, too...
And this door leads to the stage.

Everyone:
Whoa!

Yui:
Oh, look, there's even a disco ball!

Kawakami:
You need to think about what sort of lighting setup you want for your numbers.

Yui:
It needs to be all swirly and sparkly and shiny and fun!

Azusa:
We're really going to be playing here, aren't we?

Tsumugi:
It's exciting, isn't it?

Ritsu:
Don't burn yourself out yet.

Kawakami:
We look forward to having you for the show!

Everyone:
Yes, thank you very much!

Ui:
Huh? You're playing at a live house?

Yui:
Yeah, we're on our way to have a meeting there up to this.

Ui:
Ah, that's amazing!

Yui:
Heh-heh-heh...

Ritsu:
So, we have a four-song set,
"Stapler," "Brush Pen," "Curry," and "Fuwa Fuwa Time."

Yui:
Ah, what should we wear?

Ritsu:
How about what we wore to our first School Festival?

Azusa:
Uh... Those frilly things?

Yui:
Don't worry, I'm sure Miss Yamanaka wouldn't mind making one for you!

Ritsu:
Miss Yamanaka made some other outfits for us, too...
Nurse, school swimsuit, frilly Lolita...

Azusa:
No way!

Ritsu:
Why don't we have her make something new, then.

Yui:
How about something like transforming fighter outfits?!

Tsumugi:
Oh, adorable!
You mean like magical girls?

Mio:
Why not just wear our uniforms?

Azusa:
I vote for uniforms!

Yui:
That's a great idea!
Oh, right!
Here! Tickets for you and Jun-chan.
Come watch us play, okay?

Ui:
Commemorative tickets to my sister's first take show...
It almost seems like a waste to use them.

Azusa:
You can't get in if you don't.

Yui:
Let's see, I still have to give one to Nodoka-chan.
Here, this is for you!

Nodoka:
Wow, you're playing a live show?
That's amazing.

Yui:
Heh-heh-heh...
You'd better hurry and get all our autographs now before we make it really big!

Nodoka:
Oh, that's okay, Yui.

Yui:
But I already made one for you...

Mio:
You jumped the gun.

Nodoka:
In that case, I'll take it.

Yui:
Oh, thank you, Nodoka-chan!
Let's see, now we need to give one to Miss Yamanaka.

Ritsu:
There's a poster!

Yui:
I can't believe we're gonna be in this show.
Wonder what other kinds of bands will be playing?

Azusa:
Mio-senpai?

Ritsu:
Mio's kinda shy, that's all.

Ui:
Sis! I'm gonna take a bath first, okay?

Yui:
'Kay!
Geeta, let's do our best together tomorrow, okay?
I just know this is gonna be a lot of fun!

Fan:
Have a great show!

Yui:
Huh?

Ritsu:
Will do!

Yui:
Do you think they play in one of the other bands or something?

Ritsu:
No, I'm pretty sure that they're fans.

Yui:
Oh, we've got fans already?!
Hi, everyone!

Ritsu:
It's nice to meet you all!

Yui:
Everyone seems like they're really hardcore...

Band Member:
Hey there, how are you doing?

Band Member:
How's it going?

Band Member:
Nice to meet ya.

Yui:
They were nice and said hello!

Maki:
Yo, Ritchan! You, too, Mio, it's been forever!

Ritsu:
Good to see you, Maki!
Let me introduce you, guys.
This is my friend Maki, drummer for Love Crisis.
She's the one who sent us the invite to play!

Maki:
Nice to meet ya.

Yui:
The pleasure's all ours! Thank you for looking after our Ritchan!

Aya:
Oh, ha ha, heh heh, It's Mio!

Maki:
This is Aya, our bassist.
She's a big fan of yours, Mio.

Aya:
You were completely awesome at the School Festival show!

Yui:
Oh, you came to see us play?

Aya:
Yeah, you're the one who came late!

Yui:
I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!

Aya:
It's okay, it was a fun show!

Aya:
Um... Is she okay?

Ritsu:
Hm, sorry, it's 'cause we don't get complemented on our performances by strangers very often.
I think.

Aya:
Well, that explains it.
Oh, that's right! Make sure you come see us at our next show, okay?

Maki:
Our next one's gonna be a solo gig.

Tsumugi:
Goodness...

Aya:
Oh, and have a CD!
It's homemade, but still...

Yui:
This is amazing!

Maki:
Gotta go! Talk to you later!

Ritsu:
Sure!
Their enthusiasm is on a whole other level...

Yui:
Hey, you know, we really ought to have a logo or something like that, too, shouldn't we?

Everyone:
Huh?

Yui:
Let's see...
Um... How about this one?

Ritsu:
That's like for a hot spring!

Yui:
It is?

Tsumugi:
Why don't you try adding a tea cup?

Yui:
Liiike this?
Whoa! It's like we're having a leisurely cup of tea!
All done!

Ritsu:
Ha! Draw one on these, too!

Tsumugi:
And on my keyboard!

Mio:
I want mine on my guitar case.

Azusa:
I'd like one on my pick.

Yui:
Great! we'll all be matching!

Kawakami:
Okay, time to go to the meeting!

Ritsu:
Oh, yeah!

Everyone:
Let's do it!


-- (EYE CATCH) --


Yui:
Whoa! We're gonna be the second band to play!

Mio:
Second, huh?

Assistant:
Excuse me. Here are your backstage passes.

Mio:
Oh, thank you very much.

Ritsu:
Yeah, thank you.

Yui:
Whoa, so where do you think we should stick these?
Oh, like that!

Tsumugi:
Amazing...

Ritsu:
They're like battle-hardened veterans of the show circuit.

Yui:
And these will be the very first ones that we're gonna collect!

Azusa:
Yeah!

Yui:
Here.

Ritsu:
At show time you can't get back in here unless you have the pass stick somewhere on yourself.

Yui:
Oh, yeah, you're right!

Ritsu:
You're putting it there?!

Yui:
What?

Azusa:
It's not a patch!

Yui:
It seems like I'm playing it safe...

Ritsu:
Oh, right! Let's fill out our setup sheet!

Everyone:
Oh...

Yui:
It's got spots for everything...!

Ritsu:
Well, we've got our song names and melodies, so that's okay, but...

Yui:
What's it mean by "lighting style"?

Ritsu:
Yeah, that's a really good question.

Tsumugi:
What do you think we should put down?

Ritsu:
Hmm.

Yui:
Ah! Wait, I'll be right back!

Mio:
Why did she head straight to the scariest-looking bunch?!

Yui:
They wrote down stuff like "cheerful and happy" or "pop-style"!

Ritsu:
Hah! We'll go with something like that, then.

Mio:
Oh, wait a second!
Ours should...
It should all be pink!

Azusa:
All pink?!

Mio:
We can't?

Ritsu:
Well, we can go with a pink vibe for Fuwa Fuwa Time.

Yui:
And let's use the disco ball!

Ritsu:
Okay, we'll use it for the intros and solos.

Tsumugi:
What else?

Ritsu:
Hmm... It might be pretty cool to have them put a tight spotlight on me!

Azusa:
Hey, why put the light only on you?!
What we should do is have them light up each member of the band right as we're being introduced!

Yui:
And on Geeta, too!

Mio:
I don't want one on me!

Ritsu:
If the bassist trips, get a spot on her.

Mio:
I'm not gonna trip!

Tsumugi:
What about "acoustics style"?

Yui:
Wait! Give me a sec!
They wrote stuff like "Reverb on song 3," and "Both of the guitars" and "Boost the vocals to the max."

Ritsu:
Oh! We'll write down stuff like that, then.
Where is it that we are supposed to do our banter?

Yui:
I'll go ask!
They're done with theirs, so they said we could use it for reference if we want!

Ritsu:
Haaah! We're so sorry!

Yui:
Thank you, guys!

Mio:
She's friends with them already...

Ritsu:
She can be a force to be reckoned with.

Mio:
We can use the other bands' rehearsals as reference for us, too.

Azusa:
Wow, they use a ton of effects...

Ritsu:
They have a personal mic!
I wonder how much one of those mics costs?

Yui:
Look, look!
They sell tasty snacks!
Ritchan, they sell CDs!
Gosh, we don't have any merchandise to sell, huh, Mio-chan?
Azu-nyan, do you think we'll ever be on one of these, too?
This is amazing, Mugi-chan!

Everyone:
Come on, come on, come on...

Yui:
Look, it says "After-school Teatime" here! Check it out!

Mio:
Calm down, already, will you?

Tsumugi:
Shall we have some tea?

Ritsu:
Mugi's a force to be reckoned with, too.

Yui:
This is good...

Ritsu:
This hits the spot!

Maki:
That smells good!

Tsumugi:
If you like, please feel free to join us for tea.

Maki:
Well... If you insist.

Tsumugi:
Mm-hm.

Ritsu:
So I guess you've been in a lot of contests, huh?

Band Member:
Yeah, but we haven't managed to win any, though.

Band Member:
But we're going pro, so we're not giving up.

Maki:
That's for sure.
The instant you give up, it's all over.

Aya:
I wanna keep playing music forever.

Azusa:
Oh, wow...

Mio:
They're all in bands because they really wanna play music.

Yui:
It's kind of embarrassing that we said we were gonna play the Budokan, huh?

Mio:
Maybe it's thanks to Yui's spirit, and Mugi's grace, and everybody else that we can talk like this.
We're always opening new doors ourselves, little by little.

Assistant:
After-school Teatime!
Please start your rehearsal!

Mio:
Oh, no! We got a little TOO calm down!

Yui:
W-What do I do first?!

Ritsu:
Check your setting!

Tsumugi:
O-Of course!

Azusa:
Who are you talking to?!

Kawakami:
Okay, whenever you're ready.

Everyone:
Right!

Ritsu:
E-Everybody ready?

Yui:
Oh, yup!

Azusa:
Yes!

Tsumugi:
Good to go!

Ritsu:
Okay, Um... then. We'll start with the second chorus from Fuwa Fuwa Time, all right?

Ritsu:
Yui! Sing!

Yui:
Ah, oops!

Mio:
Yui!

Azusa:
Mio-senpai, are you--

Ritsu:
Calm down, everybody!

Band Member:
Just relax.

Aya:
Hey, just take it again from the top, all right?

Band Member:
Don't sweat it, you'll be fine!

Band Member:
You can do it!

Yui:
We have to work hard so we don't make everybody else look bad!

Azusa:
This isn't just our show.

Tsumugi:
So we have to relax and give it our best.

Mio:
After all, this door was just opened for us!


Nodoka:
Well, it ought to be somewhere right around here.

Jun:
They're all here for the show?!

Nodoka:
So many...

Ui:
I wonder Big Sis would be okay?

Yui:
Ui!

Ui:
Big Sis!

Yui:
Thank you for coming Ui and Nodoka-chan and Jun-chan.

Jun:
Looks like there's gonna be a big crowd.

Yui:
Check it out! Backstage pass!

Nodoka:
Aren't you the least bit nervous?

Yui:
Sure I am! That's why I'm eating snacks to help me unwind!
Oh, right! We'll call out your names from the stage, okay?!

Nodoka:
No, don't!
That'll just make US nervous!

Yui:
See you later!

Ui:
She's fine.
She is her usual self.

Sawako:
Sigh... Oh, man, It took forever for me to pull out my old outfits...

Kawakami:
Ah, Catherine!

Sawako:
Janice! What are you doing here?!

Kawakami:
Well, I'm the manager here at the club!
Oh, wow, It doesn't look like you've changed a single bit!

Sawako:
Oh, I've changed a lot!
For one thing, I'm the teacher of those terrific girls playing up there.

Kawakami:
You are, huh?


Yui:
Show's over!

Ritsu:
It sure is...

Sawako:
Good job, ladies.

Yui:
Miss Yamanaka!
You waited for us?

Ui:
Big Sis!
Sis, you were very very good!

Yui:
Thanks a lot, Ui.

Nodoka:
You guys really played your hearts out, didn't you?
You looked great up there.

Yui:
Thanks a lot!

Ritsu:
Look at that!

Azusa:
Yeah!

Yui:
Yeah, but we had Nodoka-chan and Ui and the others waiting out here for us.

Yui:
Thank you, guys!

Ritsu:
Yeah, thank you! Let's play together again!

Azusa:
Thanks for all your help!

Tsumugi:
Thank you very much!

Mio:
And good job!

Maki:
We'll invite you to play again!

Yui:
Have a great new year!

Sawako:
I have a tiger bikini, too, so try it on!

Azusa:
Absolutely not!

Sawako:
Why not?

Mio:
What happened to the mood?

Ui:
All right, guys, I have New Year's noodles for everyone!

Ritsu:
Those look great!

Mio:
I feel bad about swarming you like this.

Ui:
Oh, no, I don't mind at all.
For one thing...

Yui:
Yummy!

Ui:
That happy look on her face is enough to make me happy.

Yui:
Aw, I got the old maid again?

TV:
This year now has just one minute remaining!

Ritsu:
Almost time...
Mio, what kind of year did you have?

Mio:
It was packed full of great times.
Thanks to all of you.
Thank you, Ritsu.

Ritsu:
Uh... Oh, stop it, you're freaking me out!

Mio:
Huh? What do you mean freaking you out?

Ritsu:
Hey, the new year's about to begin, everybody!
They fell asleep!

TV:
Happy New Year, everybody!

Mio:
Oh, it's the new year...

Ritsu:
Hey! What's the big idea, falling asleep at a time like this?!
Mugi! Yui! Wake up, darn it!

Mio:
They're all exhausted.
But that's part of being in the Light Music Club...


Yui:
Wake up! C'mon!
C'mon, wake up, everyone!

Mio:
What? What is it?

Sawako:
Where am I?

Azusa:
What time is it?

Yui:
Let's go watch the first sunrise of the year! The first one!

Ritsu:
I'm too sleepy to go.

Yui:
What's the big idea, sleeping at a time like this?!

Mio:
Like you're one to talk?

Yui:
We left Miss Yamanaka behind, think she'll be okay?

Mio:
Ui's with her. She'll be fine.
There.

Ritsu:
It's lovely...

Yui:
Isn't it, though?
This is my secret spot.

Mio:
Okay, then...
Here goes.
A Happy New Year to all my best friends!

Everyone:
Happy New Year to you, Mio!

Yui:
Hey, Azu-nyan, how long are you gonna keep those ears on?

Azusa:
Huh...? Ughhh! Why didn't anyone tell me I still had them on!

Ritsu:
Sorry, sorry, they just looked so good on you.

Tsumugi:
They're awfully cute.

Yui:
Azu-nyan, you should be more confident.

Mio:
Oh, good grief...
