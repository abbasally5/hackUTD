  Mio:
Let's see...

Yui:
It sure is cold today, huh, Ui?

Ui:
Yeah.

-- (OP) --

Yui:
I'm freezing!
It's so cold!
Ritchan, aren't you cold?

Ritsu:
Oh, yes, it is most frigid, indeed!

Yui:
Yes, indeed it is!
Huh? Ritchan!
Whack!
Wow, your cheeks are really warm, Ritchan!

Ritsu:
What's the big idea?!
All right, then!

Yui:
Oh, it was cold!


-- #Bonus Episode: Winter Days! --


Yui:
Oh, it's so cold I can't play Geeta!
I've got a great idea!
I'll try playing with my gloves on!

Ritsu:
Yeah, that's gonna work...

Yui:
I'm ready!
Here we go...
Let's see.
I can't hold the pick!
Oh, they're catching on the strings!
You're bad gloves!

Mio:
Wasn't it obvious?
Right, Ritsu?
Ritsu?
Ritsu, is something the matter?

Yui:
Ritchan?
Ritchan?

Ritsu:
Huh?

Yui:
What's the matter?

Ritsu:
Uh, it's nothing!
Check it!
Moustache!

Yui:
Ritchan, that's sneaky!
I'll try it, too! Moustache!

Ritsu:
Wrong! That looks nothing like a moustache!

Yui:
Like this, Senpai?

Yui:
Handy!
I'm sorry I got mad at you!

Azusa:
You named your gloves, too?

Yui:
You know, I think this is all winter's fault!

Azusa:
Oh, come on, you shouldn't blame winter.

Yui:
You know what, I think you're right.
There's lots of fun thing for us to do on cold winter days!
I know! Come to my place on Sunday for a hot pot party!
Huh?

Tsumugi:
I'm sorry, but I already have plans that day.

Ritsu:
Me, too.
I told my kid brother that I'd take him out to the movies on Sunday.

Azusa:
And I don't think that I'll be able to leave the house at all this weekend.

Yui:
What about you, Mio-chan?

Mio:
I can't come over, either. I wanna write some new lyrics this weekend.

Yui:
Aw...

Mio:
Sorry, but you and Ritsu are always bothering me, so I can never concentrate when I'm here.
See?

Yui, Ritsu:
We apologize for being insensitive!

Yui:
Oh, well then, I guess it'll just be me, Ui, and Geeta for the party.

Azusa:
Try not to get you guitar dirty, okay?
Don't forget you just had it worked on recently.

Yui:
That won't be a problem. I'm gonna put a bib on him before he eats!

Azusa:
Guess that's all right, then.

Yui:
You gotta have a hot pot party in the winter?

Yui:
It's full-on winter now, huh, Ritchan?
These Gloveys that I got from Ui are all nice 'n warm!

Ritsu:
That kid sure has her act together.
I wish I had a sister like her.
I'm green with jealousy, you know!

Tsumugi:
Um... Wait!

Yui:
Yeah, what's up, Mugi-chan?

Tsumugi:
I have to bow out today.

Yui:
Do you have plans?

Tsumugi:
Um, sort of.
Bye!

Yui:
Gee, I wonder what's up with Mugi-chan?
Think she's going to meet up with someone?

Azusa:
With a boyfriend, maybe?

Yui:
Whoa, I can see how Mugi-chan would be popular with the boys!

Azusa:
Yeah!

Ritsu:
Later!

Yui:
See you next week!

Azusa:
I'm off!

Azusa:
Senpai?

Yui:
Yes, what?

Azusa:
Sorry, but I have to go buy something by the station on the way home.

Yui:
Oh, what'cha gonna buy?

Azusa:
Um. Just some toys, nothing special.

Yui:
Oh, some toys?
Maybe I'll tag along...

Azusa:
No, it's fine! You don't have to go!
I'll just see you later.

Yui:
Bye, Azusa!

Mio:
Ritsu... About that thing the other day.
Ritsu?

Ritsu:
Huh? You say something?

Mio:
What's the matter?

Ritsu:
Nothing at all!
Gosh, it sure is cold, isn't it?
I'm starving, Mio!

Mio:
Hm?

Clerk:
Thank you, come again!

Yui:
Nothing beats a piping hot meat bun!

Ritsu:
Oww, freezing!
So cold...

Jun:
Azusa, could you please look after my family's cat this weekend?
My aunt was supposed to watch her, but she came down with a cold and has to stay in bed.
She's still just a kitten, so I'm worried about leaving her alone.

Azusa:
But I've never taken care of a cat.

Jun:
Oh. I should have known...

Azusa:
But if there's no one else that you can ask...

Jun:
Really?!

Azusa:
Wanna play?

Cat:
Meow.

Clerk:
Go ahead.

Tsumugi:
Um. All right!
I did it!

Clerk:
Okay, let's start off with the cleaning.

Tsumugi:
Right! I'm eager to learn!

Ui:
Hey, Sis!
C'mon, get out of bed!
Sis!

Ritsu:
"On winter days, I am happy no matter how cold it is."
"When I see you running towards me, panting out white puffs of breath,"
"...your neatly-trimmed hair suits you well."
"But then again I'd also like to see you with your bangs hanging down."
Looks goofy...

Satoshi:
Hey, Sis, you ready yet?!

Ritsu:
I'll be right there! Geez.

Cat:
Meow...

Azusa:
You're Azu-nyan #2.

Tsumugi:
Allow me to read your order back to you.
You ordered one cheeseburger with everything and two medium colas, is that right, sir?

Clerk:
Don't forget to smile!

Tsumugi:
And sir, would you be wanting fries with that order?

Customer:
Sure, I'll take some fries, too.

Tsumugi:
Thank you very much, sir!

Clerk:
Just like that.

Tsumugi:
Right!

Mio:
Right... I'll get some killer lyrics here!

Ui:
Oh, no one's coming?

Yui:
No.

Ui:
Oh, that's too bad.

Yui:
Hey, I know. Why don't we invent some new hot pot recipes today!
For the next time everybody comes over!

Ui:
That's awfully forward-thinking of you, Sis!

Yui:
What about a marshmallow soy milk hot pot or a chocolate curry hot pot?

Ui:
Maybe we shouldn't fly too high too fast, okay, sis?

Yui:
Huh? Who knows, they just might taste good!

Ui:
Sis, why don't we buy some strawberry milk today?

Yui:
Whoa! Ui, you're so generous!


-- (EYE CATCH) --


Mio:
It's cold!
Lyrics aren't coming to me at all. Maybe I should've gone to Yui's hot pot party.
But it sounded like everybody else already had plans...
I wonder what everyone's up to?

Satoshi:
It's freezing!
I thought we were having a global warming crisis!

Ritsu:
Dummy, it's supposed to be cold in the winter.
You know, you're such a wimp. I wish all the girls in your class could see you now.

Satoshi:
Come on, cut me some slack, Sis...

Ritsu:
Oh, wait.

Satoshi:
What?

Ritsu:
Whack!
Nice 'n warm!

Satoshi's Friend:
Hey, Tainaka!
How's it going?

Ritsu:
Oh, hello.
Cold, isn't it?

Satoshi's Friend:
I'm on my way over to Suzuki's house.
Wanna come?

Satoshi:
Yeah, sure!
Can I, please, Sis?

Ritsu:
Um... Yeah, just don't stay out too late.

Satoshi's Friend:
See you later!

Satoshi's Friend:
Where did you go?

Satoshi:
To see a movie.

Satoshi's Friend:
How was it?

Satoshi:
That was pretty good, I guess.

Tsumugi:
Thank you for waiting, Miss!

Customer:
I-I'm sorry, but I ordered hot coffee, not a big soft drink.

Tsumugi:
I'm sorry, I'll exchange it right aw...

Clerk:
Oh, sorry!

Tsumugi:
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

Clerk:
It's okay, don't worry.
What drink did you need?

Tsumugi:
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

Azusa:
Oh, no! What's the matter?! What is it?!
Azu-nyan #2!

Ritsu:
Was that...
Was that really... a love letter?

Mio:
Maybe I should go home...

Tsumugi:
I messed up... I thought I could do it, but I messed up!

Azusa:
What should I do...?
What should I do?

Yui:
Which hot pot would you rather try, marshmallow soy milk or chocolate curry?

Mio:
Huh?

Ritsu:
That's a hot pot?

Tsumugi:
Strange!

Yui:
Boy, that's weird, nobody's answering...

Yui:
Oh, it's Azu-nyan!
Hello there, Azu-nyan?

Azusa:
Please don't send out weird texts at a time like this!

Yui:
A time like what?

Azusa:
It's the kitten! It's this cat that a friend asked me to look after!

Yui:
What's wrong with it?

Azusa:
I really have no idea, but something seems to be wrong with her.
And nobody's at home right now, and I... and I-I don't know what to do!

Yui:
Understood! Try to stay calm, Azu-nyan, we'll be right there!

Azusa:
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to cause a fuss.

Yui:
I'm just glad that nothing's wrong with Azu-nyan #2.

Azusa:
I had no idea that cats threw up hairballs all the time.

Yui:
Open wide!
For you, Azu-nyan!
I guess they might taste better when you eat them as they are.

Azusa:
Of course they do!

Yui:
Oh, look! I've got texts from the rest of the guys!
Whoa! Mugi-chan has a job?!
Oh, Mio-chan went all the way out to the beach!
Ritchan wants to know where we are.
"We're at Azu-nyan's place."

Tsumugi:
How can I help you?

Yui:
What a surprise! Mugi-chan started work at a real job!

Ritsu:
Our Mugi sure is growing up!

Yui:
Yep!

Ritsu:
Azusa!

Ui:
Did Jun come over and get her cat from you already?

Azusa:
Mm-hm.

Yui:
That's really good news.

Ritsu:
So, I got that you spent your day cat-sitting.

Yui:
Oh, Mio-chan, welcome back!

Ritsu:
Write anything good?
Looks like that's a "no", huh?

Yui:
But, that's kinda cool, though, jetting off to a windswept winter beach like that!
You guys are so awesome! Don't grow up and leave me behind, okay?
You haven't changed at all, right, Ritchan?

Ritsu:
I have, too, changed!

Yui:
What? What did you change?

Ritsu:
Just forget about it, it's nothing.

Mio:
Oh, that reminds me, Ritsu.

Ritsu:
Reminds you?

Mio:
What did you think of those lyrics that I left in your mailbox. Did you like them?

Ritsu:
Huh? Lyrics?

Mio:
Yeah. I tried writing them all out on my computer this time.

Ritsu:
Then... You were the one who left them?

Mio:
Huh? Yeah.

Ritsu:
You wrote that stuff?!
That was you?!

Mio:
I TOLD you I was gonna leave it in your mailbox!

Ritsu:
Don't do old-fashioned stuff like that in this day and age!

Yui:
Oh, come on, Ritchan, let's eat our hamburgers before they get cold.
'Kay?

Tsumugi:
Thank you very much for coming, Miss!

Yui:
Hey, what's the matter, Mio-chan?

Mio:
Well, my bass is still really cold, and when it touched my thigh, I just--

Yui:
Oh, do it again!
It was really cute!

Mio:
Forget it.
You never seem to have any problems playing your keyboard, do you, Mugi?

Yui:
Don't your hands get numb from the cold?

Tsumugi:
Well, no, they're just fine.

Yui:
They're so warm!

Ritsu:
Let me see!

Mio:
Wow, you're right!

Tsumugi:
I've always had a high body temperature.

Yui:
You're so lucky! I wish we could install one of you at our house!
Azu-nyan, you should come here and feel this!

Azusa:
No thanks, I'll pass.

Yui:
She really is warm!

Tsumugi:
Here!

Azusa:
Oh, I suppose if you insist...
Wow, you're right, they're really warm!

Yui:
You know, your hands are so tiny and cute, Azu-nyan!

Mio:
And I'm just a simple girl with man hands and a cold heart...

Yui:
Are you still hung up on that?!
They said that people with cold hands have warm hearts, Mio-chan.

Ritsu:
Mugi, what are you doing?

Yui:
Mugi-chan, your hands and heart are BOTH really warm!

Yui:
This is so warm!

Azusa:
Yeah, this is nice and warm...

Yui:
Winter is not so bad.

Azusa:
Mugi-senpai, how long do you plan to keep working?

Tsumugi:
At least until new years.

Yui:
We'll visit you at work again, okay?

Ritsu:
Mio, we're NEVER using those lyrics you gave me, got it?

Mio:
What? But why not?!

Yui:
Hey, do you think it costs lots of money to rent the Budokan?

Azusa:
Wait a minute, you wanna rent it?!

Yui:
Well, if we don't, we can't play a big show there, right?

Tsumugi:
It's best to have big dreams.

Ritsu:
We'll stand on that stage some day!

Mio:
Well, we'd better practice a lot more, then.

Azusa:
That's right!
We have to practice!
And we'll never play there if we don't go pro.

Ritsu:
You two are hardcore realists, aren't you?

Yui:
I, for one, am gonna work hard, Ritchan!

Tsumugi:
Let's all work hard!

Everyone:
Yeah!


-- Preview --

Yui:
A live house?

Ritsu:
Yeah, yeah!
An old friend of mine from back in middle school invited us to come and play a show there.

Yui:
Oh!

Mio:
This says here that the show is on New Year's Eve.
That's only ten days from now.

Azusa:
But we really don't have anything ready.

Yui:
Aw, but it sounds like fun!
I'd really love to give it a shot!

Ritsu:
Me too!

Yui:
Geeta, let's do our best together tomorrow, okay?
I just know this is gonna be a lot of fun.
