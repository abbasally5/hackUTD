  Nodoka:
Here we go. Hm? Hey, this is... Dear Sokabe senpai, the weather has finally turned warm. How have you been? I'm writing to you today because there is something that I wish to tell you about.

Yui:
Huh? Mio-chan?

Mio:
Huh?

Yui:
What's wrong? You seem all fidgety.

Mio:
Well, I had this weird feeling all morning long that I'm being watched.

Tsumugi:
It's because you're really popular.

Mio:
No, it's not that, Mugi. It's almost like somebody is staring at me.

Yui&Ritsu&Tsumugi:
Stare....

Mio:
DON'T DO THAT!!!

Ritsu:
Sure you're not just being self-conscious?

Mio:
Ritsu, I'm serious!! I can feel someone's eye on my back at this very second...!!

Sawako:
Guess who! [Giggles]

Yui&Ritsu&Tsumugi:
Sawachaan...

Sawako:
Uh?

[EYECATCH]

Sawako:
Hum... So you feel like someone's watching you, huh?
Personally, everyone's eyes are always on me!

Ritsu
'Cause you've guised a really nice cover anyway.

Sawako:
Hey! What do you mean by cover!?

Ritsu:
Maybe you're the culprit who's been tailing Mio and creeping around.

Sawako:
As if!! If it were me, I wouldn't stop at just watching her.ã€€

Ritsu:
Oh yeah, good point.

Sawako&Ritsu:
[laugh]

Yui:
I got it! The culprit is really Ton-chan!

Ritsu:
Huh?

Yui:
See? It's all because you're scared of Ton-chan. And always tried to avoid looking at him. So Ton-chan grabbed on your back!

Mio:
Get it off! Get it off!! It's no use. These people aren't gonna help me.

Azusa
Come on guys! I think you should show our room of more concern here. She might be the target of some creepy stalker!!

Mio:
Azusa...!

Tsumugi:
Now I see. I think I solved the mystery. The culprit.. uh.. is YOU!

All:
Huh?

Tsumugi:
I'm sorry guys. I always wanted to do that. But the part about solving the mystery was true.

Mio:
Hhm?

Tsumugi:
Mio-chan, you had a yakisoba bun for breakfast this morning, right?

Mio:
Y- you're right, I did! I overslept and didn't have time to sit down and eat breakfast like I usually do.

Tsumugi:
And that yakisoba bun was 20 percent off, wasn't it?

Mio:
H- How in the world did you know that!?

Tsumugi:
[giggles] From this! You see?

Mio:
Hhm? Hah!

Sawako:
Oh I get it, you've been walking around all day with that stuck to your hair!

Mio:
That's why everyone was staring at me..!

Nodoka:
What are you two doing out here?

Girls:
Aw!

Mio:
Nodoka, who are these two?

Nodoka:
I'm not--

Girl A:
Hey, we're not criminals or anything!

Girl B:
Yeah! We're just members of Mio-senpai fan club!

Nodoka:
The fan club..

Mio:
Aww, I came this close to forgetting about that picture...

Tsumugi:
Wait, you didn't come here to see the sticker in Mio-chan's hair, did you?

Girl B:
Yeah, we heard of that from the other members!

Sawako:
If you're her fans, why didn't you say something to her about it.

Girl A:
Well I did say to everyone that we really ought to tell her!

Girl B:
That having something stuck in hair like that is just so Mio and you're wonderful!

Ritsu:
Wonderful..?

Yui:
I was actually wondering if you had stuck that thing there on purpose!

Mio:
You mean you've known about it!??



Nodoka:
I'm sorry. It's because I've been so undependable to those two fan club girls.

Ritsu:
What are you apologizing for?

Yui:
Wow, I didn't know your fan club was still around.

Tsumugi:
Yeah. I thought it had disbanded after Sokabe senpai graduated.

Azusa:
Wait, Sokabe senpai, who's that?

Ritsu:
Oh, yeah. That's right, you've never met her.

Yui:
She used to be the president of the official Mio-chan fan club here at school!

Ritsu:
That's right! Oh, has it been so long since those events transpired!

Azusa:
What events?

Ritsu:
Well, it was March. Just before graduation.

Mio:
Hhm..?

Ritsu:
Mio was scared. Thinking that she was being constantly watched by someone. I couldn't bare seeing her like that. So I advised her to go talk to the student council about it.

Azusa:
Really? The student council?

Mio:
Dial down your imagination, okay?
Nobody took me seriously, so I decided on my own to go talk to the student council about what was happening.

Nodoka:
So you feel like there's someone always watching you? I wonder if the stalker. It's hard to believe there could be an intruder on campus, but.. ? Mio, why are you crying?

Mio:
I'm so happy that someone's finally reacting normally!

Nodoka:
How they're treating her in the Light Music Club.

Sokabe:
Ms. Manabe, are you there?

Nodoka:
Oh, senpai.

Sokabe:
Oh, we have a visitor?

Nodoka:
Is there a problem?

Sokabe:
Not at all. I brought a handover paperwork.

Mio:
Nodoka, who is this?

Nodoka:
Megumi Sokabe. Student council president.

Sokabe:
Well, former president. A pleasure Ms. Akiyama.

Mio:
Ah, same here.

Sokabe:
I suppose that a member of the light music club might not have heard of me.

Mio:
OH, Ah! I'm really sorry!!

Ritsu:
That was the moment that they first encounter! However, poor unsuspecting Mio had absolutely no idea what fate has in store for them.

Mio:
Lay off the creepy narration, will ya!?

Azusa:
So what kind of fate are you talking about?

Mio:
That's where it gets weird.

Sokabe:
Here. I'm afraid it's not as expensive as the light music club's tea.

Mio:
Not at all, this is fine!

Sokabe:
Well, a stalker. This is a rather serious matter. Ms. Manabe, will you please inform the disciplinary committee of this?

Nodoka:
Yes, of course.

Mio:
You don't need to go though all that trouble!

Sokabe:
It's no trouble at all. If a student at our school has a trouble, we wanna do everything we can to help them out.

Mio:
I wish my club president could hear you say that.

Nodoka:
Still, I wonder what sort of person would follow Mio around.

Sokabe:
A member of her fan club, perhaps?

Mio:
Ughh, you know about that?

Sokabe:
Oh, what's wrong?

Mio
Eh, nothing. It's just that you know an awful lot about the light music club. You even knew my name.

Sokabe:
...!

Nodoka:
Come to think of it, you also knew that the club has tea parties.

Sokabe:
[Gasps]

Sokabe:
Y- You, must have mentioned it to me, Ms. Manabe..!!

Nodoka:
I don't think I did.

Sokabe:
Really?? You didn't s.. well, ah, though, the light music club is rather famous around school...

Nodoka&Mio:
Hhm?

Sokabe:
Well, I should be going now! Good bye!

Nodoka:
Senpai. Wait, you dropped something.
Hh? Mio Akiyama fan club membership card...

Sokabe:
I found this in a hall earlier...!

Nodoka:
But Ms. Sokabe, your name was written on the front of it.

Mio:
[Oh no, I have to say something to break the tension!]

Mio:
[Gosh, is it possible that you're the culprit?]

Sokabe:
[Oh, right. As is!!]

Nodoka:
[laugh out loud]

Mio:
Ms. Sokabe, you couldn't be the stalker yourself, could you? Huh?

Sokabe:
I didn't mean to frighten you...!!

Mio&Nodoka:
Ehh!?

Sokabe:
I'm graduating soon, you know...? The thought of never seeing you again is almost unbearable.. I just.. couldn't help myself...!


Mio:
It's okay. I have to admit that I'm flattered to hear you say that. And embarrassed, too.

Sokabe:
Ms. Akiyama...

Nodoka:
Member number one?

Sokabe:
Yeah, that's right! I'm also the president of the fan club!

Mio:
[screams]

Azusa:
So you mean the student council president was actually the culprit?

Sawako:
She couldn't be open about it because of her position.

Nodoka:
I suppose.

Yui:
It was tough for her. That's why we all wanted to come up with a special something to do for her for her graduation.

Mio:
Yeah. So we...,

Nodoka:
The light music club asked us to come to the auditorium. I wonder why.

Sokabe:
To get even with me...?

Nodoka:
Hh, I doubt it.

Mio:
Sokabe senpai, congratulations-

All:
on graduating!

Mio:
I- ahm... Sakura High's Light Music Club, would like to play for you to celebrate your graduation. We hope you enjoy it.

All:
It's Fuwa Fuwa Time!

Ritsu:
One, two, one two three four!

Nodoka:
Senpai. Senpai! Senpai, they finished playing the song!

Sokabe:
Hh! What's the meaning of this! Using the auditorium without permission!

Mio:
Uh!?

Sokabe:
...Is what I'm supposed to say. Thank you all so much. It's the best gift I've ever gotten!

Yui:
She laughed a bit!

Sokabe:
To mark the occasion, please autograph this!

Mio:
[screams]

Sokabe:
Please sign it "From Mio-tan"!

Nodoka:
My image of our wise elder shuddered.

Azusa:
So did you sign it , "From Mio-tan"?

Mio:
I did...

Nodoka:
Sokabe senpai was totally ecstatic.

Azusa:
Membership card number 0001!?

Mio:
It's in your name, Nodoka!?

Nodoka:
You see, after you played...

Sokabe:
I've decided, that you should also take over as the fan club president.

Nodoka:
Thank you, but absolutely not!
I couldn't turn down this membership card, so I gave in and accepted the position. But I never had time for it. And never carried out any of my duties as president.

Yui:
Nodoka-chan.

Nodoka:
That's why I came today to ask a favor of you.
To ask if you would mind holding a tea party for the members of the fan club.

Tsumugi:
A tea party?

Nodoka:
Right. I could never look her in the eye if I don't at least try.

Yui:
You bet! We would be honored to help you, Nodoka-chan!

Ritsu:
Yeah! You're always helping us out, so we owe you!

Mio:
U-Ugh...

Tsumugi:
What sort of tea party do you think we should have!?

Mio:
Up to, Mugi!?

Mio:
Hey come on, let's all rational to this, okay?

Yui:
There has to be a cake-cutting ceremony!

Ritsu:
The bouquet presentation and the memorial album!

Mio:
What is this...!?

Azusa:
Why don't we do a Q and A period then?

Ritsu:
Great idea!

Mio:
[They're not listening... ]

Nodoka:
So is it alright to take you up on your offer and leave all the planning of the event to you then? I'll go and secure a venue for us and make the notifications.

Azusa:
I'll volunteer to make all the posters!

Tsumugi:
And I'll bring an extra large cake!

Mio:
You're way too into this!

Ritsu:
Let's go all out, and...[indistinctive chatters]

Nodoka:
With everyone's help, this is going to be an amazing tea party, Sokabe senpai.

----------------- SIDE B ----------------

Nodoka:
Things certainly seem to be coming together nicely.

Yui:
We're pulling out all the stuff for Mio-chan's fans! Mio-chan pencils, Mio-chan erasers, Mio-chan tissues, Mio-chan chocolates, Mio-chan bottle openers, Mio-chan chopsticks! And the Mio-chan back scratcher.

Mio:
Don't make weird stuff like that!!

Yui:
I just put the Mio-chan sticker on it.

Tsumugi:
It's simple, but don't you think it's cute?

Mio:
Why would anyone even want one...?

Nodoka:
Ui even made these cookies for the party.

Yui:
Yeah! And the Mio-chan cookies!

Azusa:
Ritsu senpai, don't even think about charging admission. I know that look.

Ritsu:
Hey! Don't make me sound like I'm some kind of miser!

All:
Hhm?

Yui:
Yees?

Girl A:
Excuse us. We have a special delivery for you.

Yui:
You do? Really?

Girl B:
Please, all of you help yourselves!

Girl A:
Here you go.

Yui:
Thank you very much!

All:
Whoa.

Yui:
Look, it's yakisoba buns!

Tsumugi:
And tea too.

Yui:
Mind if I eat now?

Azusa:
That was fast!

Mio:
Ah. Thank you.

Girls:
[gasps]

Girl A:
We're looking forward to the tea party!

Girl B:
Sorry we bothered you.

Yui:
Thanks again, guys!

Tsumugi:
So cute! [chuckes]

Nodoka:
I'm glad that everybody seems to be looking forward to it.

Ritsu:
Nodoka, is Sokabe senpai coming to the party?

Nodoka:
About that,

Azusa:
Huh!? She can't come!?

Nodoka:
I wrote a letter inviting her, but she said that her college club has a big trip that day.

Azusa:
So there's not much point is there.

Tsumugi:
Can we change the date?

Nodoka:
She insisted that since we've already announced that to everyone, we shouldn't reschedule the party.

Azusa:
No way!

Nodoka:
She said that her dream was to keep the fan club going strong and to get everyone excited about it . So, if the current fan club members having fun at the party, she said that, that's enough for her and she's happy.


Yui:
What a mature thing to say.

Tsumugi:
Well, she IS in college.

RItsu:
So when she graduated, she also moved on from being a Mio fan, huh?

Azusa:
That can't be true! I bet that she just had conflicting plans and couldn't make it that's all!

Nodoka:
Yes. And maybe she just didn't want us to go to any special trouble on her account.

Mio:
When I - when I graduate from here, will I become as mature as her?

Ristu:
Just then, touching images of the happy days Mio spent with her friend flashed before her eyes.

Mio:
I said, to cut out the stupid narration!

Ristu:
Ha-ha!

Nodoka:
In that case, and in keeping with Sokabe senpai's wishes, let's go ahead with the dated schedule.



Tusmugi:
Here. This is the day's program.
Ritchan, you and Yui-chan will act as hosts.

Yui&Ritsu:
Aye, aye!!

Nodoka:
As far as the venue is concerned, we've gotten school's approval to decorate the music room. But, don't go overboard.

Mio:
[It's not in the program or anything but, maybe I should do something special for them, too.]

Nodoka:
Let's just keep it simple and informal. Okay, let's all run through the program together.



Ritsu:
Welcome everyone, the Light Music Club thanks you for coming here today for the inaugural Mio Akiyama fan club tea party! We will be acting as your masters of ceremonis today. My name is Ritsu Tainaka.

Yui:

Attendances:

Azusa:
Wow, this is a great turnout!

Nodoka:
I think I see some familiar faces out there too. Ah! Ms. Sasaki is a member?

RItsu:
Anyway, as we all know, life is an exiting journey but it's full of ups and down.

Girl A&B

Ritsu:

Yui:

[Cheering crowd]

Yui:

Sawako:

Ritsu:
Don't worry, we'll play costume changes!

Mio:
No we haven't!!

Yui&Sawako&Ritsu:
[Moan]

Mio:
Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules to...!!

Fan A:
Mio-chan bit her tongue!

Fan B:
That's cute, too!

Yui:
They're reading it all.ã€€

Mio:
To, join us here toda...!! ...To join us, for a bite.

Yui:
Wow, Ritchan. She's a bigger hit than our skit was.

Ritsu:
Seriously..?

Yui:
And on that note, let's get the speeches short and get right to the cake cutting!

Tsumugi:
[chuckes]

Yui:
Go Mio-chan! This is your very very first act as a couple!

Mio:
Act with who!?

Yui:
Azunyan will be helping you!

Azusa:
Hah!?

[applause]

Yui:
And now, the cake and tea service will begin. And all your table candles will be personally lit by Mio Akiyama herself!

Mio:
Oh, my...

Azusa:
Senpai! We're ready for you over here!

Tsumugi:
Here, too!

Mio:
Heeeh!



Ritsu:
And now! We'd like to move on to our special event! We call it "100 questions with Mio Akiyama"!!
Oh, one more thing. Each time a question is answered, please extinguish one candle on your table, alright?
Okay, time for the first question. What is the scariest story you've heard in your life!?

Mio:
What kind of question is that!!?

Yui:
Next question! What is the second scariest story!

Ritsu:
Third question! What's the third scariest story you've heard?

Yui:
The next next next next question! What is the fourth scariest story!

Sawako:
They're playing tales of the terror?

Fan C:
Mio, hang in there...!

Fan D:
You can do it, Mio!

Fan E:
Mio-san...!

Yui:
Let's open the floor to you!ã€€

Ritsu:
Who has a question to ask?

Fans:
Here! Here!

Fan F:
When you take a bath, what do you wash first?

Mio:
I- I wash the shower head...

Azusa:
She washes the bath!?

Fan G:
When you have grilled octopus, still start with the head?

Mio:
A cube cover...

Azusa:
Where is that!?

Ristu:
And now, let's move on to the next portion of our program!

Yui:
Let's have an intimate look back at the first half of Mio's life with the following slide show put together especially for this party!

Mio:
My life is half over at 17..?

Ritsu:
[chuckles]

A fan:
Oh wow, she looks so cute!

Sasaki:
Look at how much she's grown up...

A fan:
She's so cute I'm gonna burst!

Azusa:
Hey, is it just me or are these slides more about you than Mio-senpai.

Ritsu:
Dah, that's cause I got them from my photo album!

Azusa:
[sighs]

Mio:
Ah...

Ritsu:
Sadly, the end of this inaugural tea party is now upon us. As the grand finale, we of Afterschool Tea Time would like to play a..

Mio:
Wait.
Ahm.. There are something that I would like all of you to hear. I know I wouldn't be able to express feelings clearly. So I put them into lyrics instead.

RItsu:
Oh! Big surprise!!

Mio:
Heart grabbing sugar. I'll make a caramel sauce for you, my beloved. Granulated in brown sugar. Maple, honey, and wasanbom sugar. A caramel sauce for you, my beloved. My heart is also caramel sauce. Even if I gets a little burned, your tender heat will make it taste delicious...!!!

Ritsu:
Figures. Not even Mio's fans can make heads or tails out of her lyrics.

Ritsu&Yui:
And now, it's time for our performance!

Ritsu:
And a new song of Aterschool Tea Time!

Yui:
It's called "Pure Pure Heart"!

Tsumugi:
Sshhh! Sshh!

[sing "Pure Pure Heart"]



Yui:
Everybody say cheese!

Ritsu:
Alright, look over here next, please!

Tsumugi:
And now over here please!

Ritsu:
You're all crowded in too close to Mio!

Yui:
Yeah, that's...[indistinctive]

Nodoka:
I wished Sokabe senpai could see how excited everyone here is.

Azusa:
Oh, hey.

Nodoka:
Hey, what are you going to do with that?

Azusa:
I thought I take I picture of this and send it to her.

Nodoka:
But I don't know her cell number.

Azusa:
Just look it up at the student council office!

Girl:
I'm gonna go buy something to drink, okay?

Sokabe:
Okay. [phone rings] Hm?
[Chuckles] They all just gave me another wonderful gift!

Nodoka:
Dear Sokabe senpai. Please be sure to come to the next tea party we have. I'm sure it will be another terrific one.


----------------- PREVIEW ------------------

Yui:
[sighs]

Sawako:
This is your future, so give it a lot of thought, okay?

Yui:
It seems like, it's still so far away and it's real hard for me to picture it.

Mio:
Yui, you haven't decided on your life plans yet?

Tsumugi&Mio:
I know what you mean.

Azusa:
Really? 'Cause I'm completely lost.

Nodoka:
For now, just writing down whatever it is that comes into mind should be fine.

Yui:
Whatever comes to my mind? Get it!
