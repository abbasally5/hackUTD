  Ui:
And that's that! [sighs] That takes care of the clothes. Hanky and tissues, check. Guidebook, check. Various snacks, check. Right, preparations complete. Ok, the class trip starts today. Sis', that is. Wake up, it's morning!

Yui:
[groans]

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:0:&lt;h6&gt; 

Ritsu:
Yay, a trip, a trip! Oh yeah, I'm getting even more amped up.

Mio:
Hey, you really should keep your feet off the seat.

Yui:
She's right; it's not very ladylike, you know.

Mio:
And you shouldn't eat snacks nonstop either, Yui. (Put it away. Hey, wait!)

Yui:
Here, guys. I'm sharing, I've got some Matsutake Mountain!

Girl:
Thanks!

Mio:
[sighs] No one listens.

Tsumigi:
Here, have a cup of tea.

Mio:
Ah, thank you Mugi!

Ritsu:
That's out Mugi! Oh, right, let's all take a picture together!

Yui:
I agree!

Mio:
Could you please settle down a little?

Ritsu:
It'll be something to remember out trip.

Yui:
I wanna look real cute.

Sawako:
You there, sit down! Don't leave your seats unless it's very important!

Ritsu:
We told Mio that, but she wanted a picture!

Mio:
Wah?!

Sawako:
What are you talking about? Get back to your seats this instant!

Ritsu:
We want you in it, too!

Yui:
C'mon and join us!

Sawako:
No, I'm not joining you; you girls are just unbelievable! [gasps] Don't let it get to you, we're just getting started.

Yui:
Huh? But you should wrap the seaweed around the rice first. Seaweed tastes a lot better when it's soft.

Ritsu:
That's why you're still such a little girl, Yui. With seaweed, you wrap it around the fillings right before you eat it. And that lets you savor the aroma and the crispy texture..! [squeals and gasps] Yui, it's Mt. Fuji!

Yui:
Ah, where? I dropped my snacks…

Mio:
Huh? Are you two gradeschoolers?

Mio and Yui:
Ow!

Ritsu:
Oohh! Pretty!

Yui:
Oh wow, it's so big!

Ritsu:
Clouds are drifting past it!

Yui:
They're moving so fast!

Mio:
Oh, good grief. (Huh? You mean you're not in the same group as us?)

Nodoka:
(Afraid not; it's four girls to a group, and the Light Music club should all be together. It's gonna be a lot of work, but try to keep Yui out of trouble.)

Ritsu:
Mio, Mio, take a picture! And get Mt. Fuji in the background!

Mio:
[sighs] It's not just Yui -- I have to keep Ritsu in line, too!

Nodoka:
(I feel like someone's staring at me…)



Announcer:
Kyoto, Kyoto! Make sure you have all your belongings (as you reach the xxx)

Ritsu:
We're finally here!

Yui:
We're finally to Kyoto, Rit-chan! [mumbling in background] (I wanna see a geisha!)

Mio:
I forget -- where do we go first?

Tsumugi:
It says that from Kyoto station, we're supposed to board a bus to…

Ritsu:
Let us sally forth!

Mio:
Sally forth?

Ritsu:
Yeah, right?! We're in the ancient capital of Kyoto, so let's play a game where we talk all old-timey.

Yui:
Game, huh?

Ritsu:
Verily!

Mio:
[sighs]

Sawako:
All right, I want all the team leaders to make sure that your team is accounted for. (We're going to be traveling by bus, so if anyone is prone to be carsick, take your medicine now. We'll be moving in class order from high to low, so Class 2, follow Class 3.)

Ritsu:
Why is she making us all sit down here? I mean, take our rest upon ye floor?

Mio:
It's just so she can take roll. There's almost always one or two students missing at this point in the trip.

Sawako:
We don't want to cause any trouble for the people around us, so walk in a single file, ok?

Yui:
[snoring]

Ritsu:
Is she… asleep?

Mio:
'Cause she overate.

Ritsu:
Sometimes she's such a ditz!



Yui:
Rit-chan, what's that? It looks like a giant daikon radish! There's one over here, too!

Ritsu:
Haha, that's so goofy!

All four girls:
[giggle]

Sawako:
Hey, hurry up and get on the bus!

Yui:
Gotta take a load off.

Mio:
Hm?

Yui:
[sighs] I'm tired.

Mio:
You're just sleepy from eating so much.

Yui:
I think I'll eat these next!

Ritsu:
[laughs]

Mio:
Give it a rest, will ya?



Yui:
Rit-chan, hurry up! [panting] This way! I see it, I see it! [giggles and gasps] Oh, pretty!

Mio:
That's amazing.

Tsumugi:
It's so shiny!

Yui:
I've never seen anything like it. Is it really made of gold? I mean, made-y of gold-y?

Ritsu:
It sure is! I mean, verily and forsooth! But thinketh not of stealing, uh, absconding with some, eh, trifling amount of yon gold! A cop, er, officer of ye law-y will arrest, uh, thee forthwith, that is? Um… verily…

Mio:
(She's finally tired of it.)

Tsumugi:
The original Kinkaku-ji was laid waste by fire in the year nineteen hundred and fifty, and what stands before thine eyes is newly constructed. The pavilion once resides the reliquary, the enshrined bones of the Buddha contained is known by all as "Kinkaku-ji, the Golden Pavilion Temple". However, "Deer Garden Temple" is its true moniker.

Mio and Yui:
[clapping] Oh!

Yui:
Oh look, they have matcha tea here! Now, that's the really bitter kind of tea, isn't it?

Ritsu:
Yeah, but it comes with sweets. You wanna try a cup?

Mio:
How is that any different than what we do after school everyday?

Ritsu:
So what if it isn't?

Tsumugi:
C'mon, let's try it!

Ritsu:
Ah! Well, down the hatch, I suppose.

Tsumugi:
From what I've been told, when you drink matcha in a tea ceremony or whatnot, you always eat the sweet first and then you drink the tea. Apparently doing that enhances the bitterness of the matcha.

Ritsu:
[groans]

Mio:
Hey, don't give me that. You know, studying a little refined etiquette like that would probably do you a lot of good.

Yui:
She's right. You eat like a glutton, Rit-chan. You're quite uncouth and unrefined.

Ritsu:
You're one to talk!



Yui:
Kitano Tenman-gū…


Ritsu:
Hey, is this place famous or something?

Yui:
I dunno, beats me.

Ritsu:
It's not like we don't have lot of shinto shrines around our school.

Yui:
Ooh, I bet there's a big Buddha statue here!

Ritsu:
That's a temple.

Nodoka:
This shrine's god is well known as a patron of knowledge and learning. He's famous among students who are taking college exams.

Yui and Ritsu:
Oh…

Nodoka:
Now, there are cow statues scattered all around the shine. They say that if you pet a cow's head like this, it can actually make you a bit smarter.

Yui and Ritsu:
[gasp] That's a good little cow! [unintelligible babbling]

Nodoka:
Um… (I wonder if they'll be struck down for this…)

Sawako:
Stop that! I can't believe you, are you nuts?

Nodoka:
(Thought so.)

Yui:
Rit-chan! Ema horse prayers!

Ritsu:
Oh! Ema, huh? Ok, Yui, this'll make for some good memories. Let's go write something!

Yui:
Hm! Yeah, let's go send out wishes to the god of this place!

Ritsu:
Right! Ema, ema!

Yui and Ritsu:
Moo, moo!

Mio:
They'll get denied.



Sawako:
Excuse me, I'd… uh, heh, like one of these marriage charms, please.

Shopkeeper:
That'll be six dollars, please. Here you are.

Yui:
Hey, god, mighty Kenji!

Tsumugi:
Please hear us!

Yui:
Please grant our wishes.

Ritsu:
Please grant the tender wishes of us minions. Ha! Think they'll come true?

Yui:
I hope so, Rit-chan!

Tsumugi:
Please grant them!

Ritsu:
Oops, we forgot to make a donation!

Yui:
What? You mean we have to do it again?

Sawako:
What is the matter with you girls, are you doing this on purpose?! [crying]

Ritsu:
Sawa-chan, you've got it all wrong.

Tsumugi:
We were simply writing down our wishes on prayer plaques.

Yui:
Yeah, Sawa-chan -- to remind ourselves what our dreams are.

Sawako:
Don't give me any of your lame excuses; get over here!



Yui:
Ahh, I'm exhausted.

Mio:
Me too, I was in a cold sweat back there.

Ritsu:
Yui, make sure you get changed first.

Yui:
Aw, I don't wanna…

Ritsu:
Hey, don't give me any of your lip, young lady.

Yui:
Oh, you wanna fight, huh?

Ritsu and Yui:
Huh?



Mio:
You know what? We still have a bit of time, so why don't we make ourselves some tea?

Yui:
We should have brought some games or something that we could play with.

Ritsu:
Hey, I have some cards.

Tsumugi:
Really? In that case, why don't we play this? It's called "The Life Guessing Game".

Ritsu:
Yeah! That's the one where you do whatever you have to to become a celebrity.

Yui:
I think we should have some snacks while we're playing.

Ritsu:
Agreed!

Mio:
But we'll be eating dinner in a little while.

Yui:
Don't worry about it!

Ritsu:
We'll have room for dinner, too.

Mio:
Well, you better clean your plates.

Haruko:
You mean you guys are full already? Wow, what a waste.

Ritsu:
We're just taking a little… break.

Yui:
Yeah, we'll finish everything.



Tsumugi:
You know, I've always thought that you have such lovely hair!

Mio:
Uh, I… do? Well, thank you. But it is a pain when it gets dry in the winter. Yours is really nice, too. Do you have a perm, Mugi?

Tsumugi:
Not at all; it's naturally frizzy. (I'm so jealous of you and your straight hair.)

Ritsu:
Ahh, maybe I should grow my hair out, too. I wonder if it would make me look more feminine…

Yui:
[chuckles]

Ritsu:
Hey, what's up with you? [gasps] You're laughing! Euh, what are you picturing?

Yui:
Bang monster! [laughing]

Ritsu:
Yui, that's not nice!

Yui:
Do you wanna grow taller, too?

Ritsu:
Bleh! [coughs] I'll be tall one day, and then you're gonna be really sorry!

Mio:
Ok, I'm turning off the light.

Yui:
Ready! I've got the alarm clock set.

Mio:
We have an early day tomorrow.

Tsumugi:
Heh!

Yui:
Huah!

Mio:
Huh?

Ritsu:
Teacher, Miss Kotobuki did it!

Tsumugi:
Ahhhh…

Mio:
Ah! Mugi, what are you--

Yui:
Haha! You wanna have a pillow fight? You're on! Ah!

Ritsu:
Haha! How about a little less talking and a lot more fighting, little lady!

Yui:
Oh yeah? Well, feel the wrath of my mighty pitch!

Ritsu:
Oh! [laughing] Gotta try harder tha--

Tsumugi:
[laughing]

Ritsu:
Uh. What a heavy pitch. You will pay!

All four girls:
[fake snoring]

Sawako:
Hm.

Ritsu:
Oww!

Sawako:
Now go to sleep! Ugh!

Ritsu:
Whoa, that was a close call!

Mio:
What?

Ritsu:
Mugi! Our glorious battle is not yet finished!

Tsumugi:
Well, bring it on!

Mio:
[sighs]

Ritsu:
Take that!

All four girls:
[screaming and laughing]

Mio:
Ok, lights out.

Yui:
Sure. Goodnight, guys.

Tsumugi:
Goodnight!

Ritsu:
Honor has been satisfied. [snoring]

Yui:
Could you turn off the nightlight?

Mio:
[sighs]

Tsumugi:
Skull. [laughing] … Lycopene. [laughing]

Ritsu:
Lyco…bing! [laughing]

Tsumugi:
[laughing] [snorts]

Yui:
Huh?

Ritsu:
Mugi snorted!

Ritsu, Tsumugi, Yui:
[laughing]

Mio:
Mmmm….

Yui:
[laughs]

-----------Side B-------------

Sawako:
All right, now. Is everyone assembled? Today's your independent day. It's very important that each team sticks to their planned routes, and if anything at all happens, just call me on my cell phone. (Also, please make sure you're all back here by six o'clock.)

Yui:
Anyway, that store was having a monster sale on tasty snacks!

Ritsu:
So that's why you had so many of them crammed into your bag.

Yui:
Yeah! That's right!

Sawako:
Grr… Get back here, you two!

Ritsu and Yui:
Uh!

Mio:
Let's see, now… Our team is supposed to go up to Mt. Arashi this morning.

Tsumugi:
Oh… Hey, why don't we all take a taxi there, then?

Mio:
Good idea! That'll save us a lot of time, and it should be-- Huh? Where's Yui and Ritsu? Uh!

Ritsu:
Right! This is our first stop!

Mio:
We've come all the way to Kyoto and you're looking at a music store?! Get a move on, we're going!

Ritsu:
Wah, you're so mean! [wails]

Mio:
You'll have time to look after we come back!

Ritsu:
We just wanted a minute!

Mio:
Come now, or we'll just leave you behind!

Ritsu:
Hey, they have lefty models on display here. [gasps]




Ritsu:
Oh! So this is Mt. Arashi!

Yui:
Wow, look at all the cute shops!

Ritsu:
And there's lots of people, too.

Mio:
Ok, we'll start with the Togetsu Bridge and--

Ritsu:
Awesome, look; it says right here there's a monkey park!

Yui:
Oh, really? Monkeys?! They have monkeys here?!

Mio:
We've come all the way to Kyoto, and you wanna go look at a bunch of monkeys? Yui! Ritsu!

Ritsu:
Yahoo, we're here! The top of the mountain! Oh, what a view!

Yui:
Wow! All of that is Kyoto?

Mio:
I wasn't expecting such a terrific view!

Tsumugi:
Hey, Mio, it looks like they have it set up so you feed the monkeys over in that rest area. Mhm. [gasps]

Yui:
There's nothing to be afraid of, Mugi-chan. Look -- see?

Tsumugi:
Oh… ah! I did it!

Yui:
[laughs] See?

Tsumugi:
Yes, it wasn't frightening at all.

Yui:
Boy, that was fun. We sure got our monkey's worth, huh?

Ritsu:
[laughs] That was fun.

Yui:
Ah, look, they have souvenirs!

Ritsu:
Wow, you're right; those are so cute!

Yui:
That reminds me -- we have to buy something for Azu-nyan.

Mio:
That's right. She had to stay behind at school.

Tsumugi:
In that case, shouldn't we get her something that shouts, "Kyoto"?

Yui:
Something that shouts, "Kyoto"? Hmm… This maybe?

Tsumugi:
How about this?

Ritsu:
No way, get this!

Mio:
No, this.



Yui:
Gosh, we saw so much!

Mio:
I wish we'd seen more famous spots, though.

Ritsu:
Man, I'm so glad that I had a whole bunch of money in my wallet today. Check it out -- look at all this stuff I bought!

Yui:
Yeah me too! Hm, why did I have so much money, anyway?

Mio:
To buy souvenirs for your families.

Ritsu and Yui:
[gasp] Uhh…

Mio:
You really forgot about that?



Mio:
Well, it's about time. We should head back to the hotel.

Tsumugi:
Why don't we take the train back?

Mio:
Good idea.

Ritsu:
All right, then, the station is this way. Follow me! …Oops.

Mio:
Ritsu, are we lost?

Risu:
We're not lost.

Mio:
You were looking that the map the whole time!

Rtisu:
I'm double checking it right now.

Yui:
Haha, cut it out, cut it out! Stop it, that really tickles, haha. Ok, sit there, shake hands, (that's it?)

Mio:
Incredible.

Ritsu:
Um, forsooth? Perhaps ye could help us?

Lady:
What?

Ritsu:
Eh, how doth to we get-eth to yon train station from hence, m'lady?

Lady:
Oh, the station. Uh, go straight that way for a few blocks, and then turn right when the street dead ends.

Ritsu:
Ah, verily? Many thanks! Ah, she understood!

Yui:
Congrats, Rit-chan!

Mio:
Were you able to get directions?

Ritsu:
Oh yeah, you bet. This way, guys! Follow me! …We're lost.

Mio:
How could this have happened?

Tsumugi:
It would simplify things if we knew where we were.

Mio:
Yeah…

Yui:
Oh, right! Ah, Azu-nyan? Listen, we managed to get ourselves hopelessly lost.

Mio:
How is calling Azusa supposed to help us?

Yui:
Oh, you're right.

Nodoka:
Look, Yui's over there! Yui, Mio!

Yui:
Ah, Nodoka-chan!

Ritsu:
Thank goodness, we're saved!

Nodoka:
Hey, do you guys know where the train station is?

Mio:
So you guys are lost, too?

Nodoka:
Yes. But that was is north, so this should be the right street, don't you think?

Mio:
Probably.

Yui:
If we stick with Nodoka-chan, we'll be fine.

Mio:
We turn left here, right?

Tsumugi:
Think so…

Nodoka:
Ok, if we just follow this road, then we should be…

Ritsu:
We're right back where we started.

Nodoka:
That's so strange…

Mio:
Nodoka…

Nodoka:
Hmm, hang on. Let me check my map again.

Ritsu:
Oh, skull. Skull.

Mio:
[manic laughing]



Tsumugi:
I'm glad we made it back for dinner.

Yui:
Mhm!

Sawako:
Now listen, don't you ever worry me like that again!

Yui:
I'm sorry, m'lady.

Ritsu:
Yon rice for thou? I am Lady Akiyama on ye bass guitar.

Mio:
[manic laughing] I can't stop!



Sawako:
Hey, what are you two doing out here?

Schoolgirls:
Yes, ma'am. All right, we will. Goodnight, Sawa-chan.

Sawako:
Sawa--

Teacher:
I think we can afford to relax now. Tomorrow's just the train home.

Sawako:
True, but there's still one more night to get through.



Mio:
Ok, I'm turning off the light.

Yui:
Ahh, today was fun.

Mio:
Let's go straight to sleep this time, all right?

Ritsu, Tsumugi, and Yui:
All right.

Ritsu:
Heh heh. Mio…

Mio:
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

Ritsu:
This long night of terror has only just begun, Mio-chan. Ahaha!

Sawako:
Keep it down!

All four girls:
[scream]

Sawako:
Now you hurry up and go to sleep.

Ritsu:
Who are you?

Sawako:
I'm your teacher! Even on a big trip like this, you four don't ever change!

Ritsu:
You're ten times scarier without your makeup, Sawa-chan.

Sawako:
What? I didn't quite catch that, Ritsu. Would you mind repeating what you just said to me?

Ritsu:
I didn't say anything and I didn't mean it!

Yui:
Oh! Eh!

Sawako:
Now everyone go to sleep.

Yui:
Come on, please? Can't we just chat like friends like we always do?

Sawako:
Look, Yui, I'm supposed to be your teacher now!

Yui:
Aww, just for a while?

Tsumugi:
I have tasty snacks, too!

Sawako:
You're always trying to snare me with--
It's all your fault that all the other students are calling me "Sawa-chan" now and aren't showing me the respect that I deserve as a teacher. You're ruining my image at the school. I've worked really hard on my "nice teacher" act, (and you guys go and--)

Ritsu and Yui:
We shouldn't have asked her to join us.



Yui:
[sighs] (I'm a senior now.)

Ritsu:
[snoring]

Yui:
Mm. (This is our last year as the Light Music Club, too. But I really want to keep on playing with all of them in a band. Forever… and ever…

Teacher:
Miss Yamanaka!

Sawako:
Don't scare me like that!



Teacher:
Mmmm….

Sakako:
[snoring]

Ritsu:
Anyway, I'd already been given a copy of that book.

Yui:
Mm.

Ritsu:
So I ended up giving it to my li--
Yui, Mt. Fuji!

Yui:
Ah, where, where?

Mio:
Oh, I wanna see, too! Hm? Oh, I dropped them.

Yui:
Hahaha, Mio-chan, you're just as bad as me!

Mio:
Oh… Hm, yeah, you're right!

All four girls:
[laughing]

-----------Preview-------------

Ui:
Did you make it? Since you haven't called me, I'm just gonna assume that you were able to make it on time.

Are you at the station by now?

Um, pardon us.
