  Tsumugi:
Finland this year, is gonna be really fun.
Huh?

----- OP -----

Sawako:
The first thing in the morning is homeroom. Which means that I'm teaching back to back classes from the first to third period.
Over lunch break, I took a student home who had collapsed from anemia. And in fifth period, I patrolled the campus looking for students who were skipping class. After school I’ve been supervising the blass band club's practices because they have a competition soon.

Yui:
Whoa, that’s why you’re soaking your feet.

Sawako:
Yep.

Mio:
Who can blame you. You’ve been upon your feet all day.

Yui:
Have you tried ultra xxx’s sandals?

Sawako:
No I can’t! Even the freshmen think of me as an elegant lady-like teacher.

Yui:
Hmm.

Ritsu:
Have you ever thought about coming clean about your light music club past?
You know, you just say, “I'd be like this!”

Sawako:
Never give me that!!!
You just don’t know what it’s like, in education showing the slightest weakness could lead to catastrophe! If they ever learned of my past..

Oh no, you’re interrupting? Please stop it?

Student:
You used to be exactly like this back when you are in high school, ain’t that right?

Sawako:
That’s what would happen!

Azusa:
I think you’re probably blowing it out of proportion.

Sawako:
Excuse me for just a second?

Ritsu:
You’re taking the call?

Sawako
Hello? Just what the heck are you thinking you’re calling me here like this! Uh..
I’ll be right back, okay?

Azusa:
Seems very fishy.

Ritsu:
Oh yes she was all, just what the heck are you thinking calling me like this!

Tsumugi:
Oh, that reminds me..

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:0:&lt;h4&gt; 

Mio:
That happened this morning?

Ritsu:
This morning she’s dropped off at school and had some argument with the driver. And then she was surprised by a sudden phone call. The normal conclusion would be that the mystery caller is…

Tsumugi:
Ah!

Azusa:
No way!

Yui:
Her mother!?

Azusa:
You shouldn’t worry about this Yui sempai.

Yui:
Why not!?

Azusa:
‘Cause this isn’t kids' stuff we’re talking about.

Mio:
Oh, look. Speak of the devil.

Yui:
Huh? Sawa-chan spotted!

Ritsu:
Yeah. Take a look at that suspicious behaviour!

Mio:
This isn’t the usual way that she goes on after school..?

Yui:
Oh, Mio-chan you sound like a detective!

Ritsu:
Come on! Let’s follow her!

Azusa:
Ah, wait! Are you sure this is a good idea? If she spots us..

Tsumugi:
Look she’s turned left! Come on, let’s hurry!

Azusa:
Mugi sempai, isn’t this more than anyone elese!?



Ritsu:
Okay, target acquired.
Yui, you ought to maintain watch focusing on the right.
Mugi, you exercise the utmost caution, so that Sawa-chan doesn’t spot you.

Yui&Tsumugi:
Roger that!

Mio:
This is a stakeout?

Yui:
Oh right! You too, Mio-chan!

Mio:
You came ready!

Azusa:
Looks like something in the area spoke to her!

Mio:
You too!?

Yui:
You’re right.

Azusa:
You think she really has..

Tsumugi:
But wait. Doesn’t she always complain about how lonely she is because she’s single?

Mio:
Maybe teachers have to keep certain parts of their life secret.

All:
Oh?

Yui:
Certain parts?

Mio:
[Gasps] N-no! Not me! I’m not hiding anything!

Ritsu:
You know, come to think of it, you are a hearty Mio. I wouldn’t be surprised at all if boys liked you as much as or more than girls do.

Azussa:
Neither would I.

Mio:
How did we get on this topic!?

Yui
Mio-chan, congratulations.

Mio:
What are you doing, don’t blow that joke!

Tsumugi:
Huh-hm.

Mio:
Don’t stare at me!!
Look! I’m not interested in that kind of stuff! You could say that the light music club is my boyfriend right now.

All:
Oh.

Ritsu:
Aw! Why was I the only one.

Norimi:
Sorry I’m late.

All:
Oh?

Sawako:
Didn’t I tell you never to call me during school there like you did?

Norimi:
I’m really sorry.

Sawako:
Yeah, well.

Yui:
Huh? Isn’t that a girl?

Azusa:
Oh, darn.

Tsumugi:
It’s a woman...

Ritsu:
Well, you don’t need to read too much into it.



Mio:
Why did we follow them in here.

Yui:
It’s like we’re in a soap opera.

Ritsu:
Today is the day you get your comeuppance your scheming vixen!

Azusa:
They’ll hear you!

Staff:
Pardon me.

All:
Y-yes!?

Staff:
Party of five, ladies?

All:
We are! Okay!

Ritsu:
Mind if we sit over here?

Yui:
Aw, we’re still in our school uniforms!

Mio:
Mugi! Keep your head down!

Tsumugi:
Oh. All right!

Yui:
Come on Azu-nyan, scoot over.

Azusa:
Why don’t you sit on the other side, huh!?

Yui:
You’re so mean! Ah!

Norimi:
Uh?

Sawako:
What’s the matter?

Norimi:
Ahm, it’s nothing really.

Yui:
That was close.

Ritsu:
Yui, stay down there.

Yui:
Huh!?

Ritsu:
I’ll give you this.

Yui:
I don’t wanna.

Ritsu:
Hey, whatch it! Don't just butt your way in like that. You're squashing me!

Azusa:
Will the both of you please be quiet!

Sawako:
You mean they’re holding the party there?

Norimi:
That’s right.

Yui:
Oh hey, isn’t that..?

Waiter:
Excuse me girls, may I take your order?

Ritsu:
Ah, five black tea, please?

Waiter:
We have a lovely self-sevice area over there.

Ritsu:
Not good.

Norimi:
Com’on, don’t be like that.

Ritsu:
Hm, I’ll have this chocolate cake then.

Yui:
Hey, don’t just order for yourself!

Ritsu:
We need something!

Azusa;
In that case, I’m gonna have the pumpkin custard a la mode.

Yui:
Huh! They serve amazing thing like that here!?

Tsumugi:
I think I’ll have the cream anmitsu.

Yui:
Hah! That’s what I wanted!

Mio:
You CAN other the same thing, you know.

Yui:
That’ll be a waste. We have some much good stuff here.

Yui:
Ah, ahem… I guess I’ll have this.. ahem, I guess I will have…!! This. This please.

Azusa:
You completely lost sight of our initial objective.

Ritsu:
We’re paying separately and not dutch, you got that?

Yui:
What!? We are!?

Ritsu:
Obviously.

Yui:
Well then, in that case..

Azusa:
Will you please make up your mind? We’re gonna be spotted.

All:
Ah!

Sawako:
You’ve been acting strange since we got here.

Norimi:
Uh-m. It’s nothing.

Sawako:
Liar. you keep looking behind me.

Ritsu:
SHhh! Shhhh!

Norimi:
Please. Think about it one more time, alright?

Sawako:
Talk about pushy!

Yui:
Huh, It cost me 14.80 with tax! They’re good my allowance.

Azusa:
you didn’t actually need to buy it, you know.

Yui:
I didn’t wanna miss out all that good stuff!

Mio:
You know we never did figure out who the woman with Sawa-chan was.

Tsumugi:
That’s true.

Yui:
I recongnise her.

Mio:
Yui, you know her?

Yui:
Yes, of course! She was with Sawa-chan in all those old pictures we found, remember?

Mio:
Pictures.. Ah! She’s Death Devil’s..

Norimi:
Name is Christina!!

Mio:
[Screams]

Norimi:
Sorry, was I a bit overboard

Ritsu:
Oh, no. She’s always been like this.

Norimi:
Really. Let me guess. You’re the Light music club, aren’t you?

Yui:
Oh, are you another master detective?

Azusa:
We’re wearing our uniforms are carrying guitars, it's not a huge stretch.

Norimi:
I need to talk to you about something as a light music club’s alumnus. Who’s the president?

Norimi:
Ehh! ..Mio is.

Azusa:
Don’t abandon your post.



Norimi:
Wow, this is one a hell of you axe, you’ve got here.

Yui:
Oh, thanks.

Norimi:
This really takes me back.

Mio:
She is.. good.

Azusa:
Maybe even better than Ms. Yamanaka.

Norimi:
Really? Thanks a lot. Sawako and I used to have technique competitions every day.

Yui:
Oh wow, you did? Really?

Norimi:
Oh don’t be shy. Go ahead and order something.

Norimi:
Parhaps another around of juices for the girls.

Master:
Sure thing, Nori-chan.

Yui:
Nori-chan?

Norimi:
Sorry about that, my name is Norimi.

Yui:
Oh my goodness, you mean you’re not a foreigner of some kind?

Ritsu:
Of course she isn’t.

Yui:
But, her name.

Norimi:
I’m sorry, I should have introduced myself sooner. By the way, if there’s anything that you girls like to eat, just say the word, okay?

Yui&Ritsu:
She seems really nice!

Tsumugi:
Then I would like the ganmodoki, please.

Master:
One ganmo, coming up!

Azusa:
Oh, do you like those?

Tsumugi:
I don’t know, I’ve never tried that before. Its name makes it sound just amazing. Ganmodoki.

Azusa:
You really think so?

Mio:
So, what did you wanna talk to us about?

Norimi:
Ah.. well, it’s nothing major or anything like that.
The thing is, Sawako is said to get married.

All:
EhhhHHH!?

Norimi:
Don’t worry, that was just a joke.

All:
[Sigh]

Ritsu:
You call that a joke!?

Norimi:
An old classmate of ours from the light music club is getting married. And she said that she wants old band to play on the reception. But Sawako is the only one who is not board with it.

RItsu:
Yeah. she treats her light music club’s past as a dark secret.

Mio:
Yeah.

Master:
One ganmodoki.

Tsumugi:
It’s more mundane than I expected.

Azusa:
Well what did you have pictured in your head!?

Tsumugi:
Something.. spiny I guess.

Azusa:
Spiny..?

Yui:
She seems.. so cool.

Norimi:
Ah, I’m sorry. Didn’t mean to keep it so long. Here.

Yui:
Ah, okay. Hmm..

Norimi:
Sorry, did I mess something up?

Yui:
Um-m! No, everything’s fine!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:2:&lt;h4&gt; 

Sawako:
English class today will be an independent study. Work quietly.

Classmate:
Ms.Akiyama. It’s from Ms.Kotobuki.

Mio:
Thank you.

Tsumugi:
Mio-chan. Have you thought of anything?

Mio:
I've been thinking about it a lot. But if the old club members couldn't convince her, I don’t see how are we gonna be able to do it. Thanks.

Classmate:
Here.

Tsumugi:
Thanks a lot. Hmm. Apparently other teachers and the members of the newspaper club are coming to the reception.

Mio:
Maybe we could disguise her with the makeup or something.

Tsumugi:
But considering the outcome if she’s found out, perhaps she shouldn’t.

Mio:
Good point. What do you think, Yui?

Yui:
Mio-chan, you’re handwriting is so cute.

Mio:
How about you, Ritsu. You’re our president.
Be serious!

Sawako:
Ms. Akiyama. Did you draw this picture?

Mio:
Hah! No! Ah! You traitor!

Ritsu:
I am a pen.

Tsumugi:
It’s me!

Sawako:
Ms.Kotobuki?

Mio:
Mugi..?

Tsumugi:
I was the one who sent the first note and started all this. So Mio-chan isn’t the one to blame for any of it!

Sawako:
Oh, but still, she had..

Tsumugi:
But hallway! May I stand out there as a punishment!?

Sawako:
Ah? That’s.. really not..

Tsumugi:
I wanna stand outside!

So this is what it’s like to stand out here. Twelve years after starting my school carrier, my dream is finally come true. I can graduate with no unfinished business.

Ritsu:
What kind of dream do you have?

Yui:
I did it ! Ritchan look! I reached it !

Ritsu:
Yui seems to be having a ground all time.

Mio:
To get back to the topic, what do you think you should do?

Yui&Ritsu:
Huh?

Mio:
Don’t you people remember what Norimi told us about Sawa-chan last night?

Ritsu:
Of course.

Yui:
I forget. What did she say?

Ritsu:
Get with it, Yui.

Norimi:
Fine. I’ll let you guys talk Sawako in the plan.

Ritsu:
You know, Sawa-chan can be really stubborn sometimes.

Norimi:
So what? You're throwing in a towel already? Well, if you guys can't talk her into it then..

Mio:
What will you do?

Norimi:
Let’s just say I’ll have some special training for you!

All:
Ehhh!

Yui:
Wait, that happened!?

Ritsu:
You don’t remember?

Tsumugi:
I wonder what special training means.

Mio:
Well it's probably when alumnus says something like that it tends to be kind of harsh practice.

Tsumugi:
It’s true, but we aren’t an athletic club.

Ritsu:
No, but with the light music club, it might be...

Norimi:
All right girls. You’re gonna play until I can hear the music.

Yui:
But we don’t have any of our..

Norimi:
They say music comes from our soul, don’t they? Put your hearts into it and you should be able to play music without instruments. Get started!

All:
Y-Yes ma’am!

Norimi:
I’m not hearing anything!!!

All:
We’re so sorry!

Ritsu:
…Like that.

Yui&Tsumugi:
Seriously!?

Mio:
Come on, don't joke around about that.

Yui:
Oh my.

Tsumugi:
It was a joke?

Ritsu:
Fine. Let’s all talk to her right after the school is finished.

Sawako
You’re gonna stand there all day? Get back to your independent study, alright?

All:
Okay.

Ritsu:
Pardon us. Is Ms.Yamanaka here..

Students:
Thank you Ms.Yamanaka!

Sawako:
We don’t wanna bother the other teachers so let’s keep it down, okay?

Yui:
Wow. Sawa-chan sure is popular, huh?

Ritsu:
Yeah, but it kinda makes it harder to ask her.

Norimi:
I see.

Mio:
We’re sorry.

Norimi:
So Sawako is just as popular now.

Mio:
Yes.

Ritsu:
So, what’s this special training you mentioned?

Norimi:
Oh, that. I was just kidding. No I wasn’t. I just want your help with something.

Yui:
Umm. This is really hard.

Ui:
Hey, big sis. You still haven’t taken your bath yet?

Yui:
No. I’ll take it in a little while.

Ui:
But you’ll oversleep again.

Yui:
You know, Ui? Adults are pretty amazing, aren’t they?

Ui:
I guess. Why do you ask?

Yui:
When I’m grown up and I'm an adult, will I be mature too?

Ui:
Big sis, do you want some juice?

Yui:
Today I shall have tea!

Ui:
Coming right up.



Sawako:
Congratulations.

Bride:
Oh, Sawako.

Friend:
Good to see you again.

Sawako:
I’m so sorry that I can’t play for you. Now that I'm a teacher I have to be careful what I do.

Bride:
It’s alright. We can’t wait for the show.

Yui:
Guitaaa!

Mio:
Quit crying! It ony makes you look more scarier!

Tsumugi:
Acturally, I rather like it on you.

Azusa:
You overdid it Mugi-sempai.

Norimi:
Oh, and Ms.president, I want YOU to use this to breath fire, okay?

Ritsu:
Ehh, oh, thanks, but ehhh… No waaayyy!!!

Annouce:
And now, ladies and gentlemen, it’s time for a special performance by Death Devil. A band composed of the bride’s highschool friends. Today the performance features a special line up.

Sawako:
Huh? Hey, what are those girls think they're… Yui-chan, what did you do to your guitar?? What are you doing with them?

Norimi:
Buckle up you basterds, tonight we’ll go rock!!

All:
Yeah!!

Yui:
Ah! I miss the note.

Azusa:
Yui-sempai, what are you doing!

Yui:
I’m sorry, let’s take it again from the top!

Attendance A:
With the name like Death Devil, I was worried what kind of band they would be, but they’re awfully cute.

Sawako:
Cute!?

Attendance B:
You can do it, Death Devil!

Attendance C:
We're all rooting for you!

Sawako:
Rooting for them?

This is all wrong. This isn’t what Death Devil is about. There has to be a brutal crush in their souls. That’s Death Devil is at their best. No, I mustn’t, I’m a teacher now. I left that part of me long ago in the past. And It will be an insult to this people who’re trying so hard.

Yui:
Gosh I’m so sorry..

Sawako:
This is wrong. Death Devil is.. The Death Devil I'd pursued all these years is.. Death Devil, MY DEATH DEVIL IS!!!

Yui:
Huh? What happened? Where is the lights?

Groom:
No come back.

Bride:
I know. Huh?

Yui:
Sawa-chan!

Bride:
It’s Sawako.

Bride’s friend:
Here it comes.

Sawako:
Death Devil ain’t this half-assed waterly crap these cheapies we're trying to play. So I’m gonna show you the best until you die!!

Norimi:
Okay!! Let’s do it!!!

Drummer:
One, two!



Sawako:
Ah, what have I done!!!

All:
Nobody made her do!



Sawako:
I’m finished. The gentle-like image I worked so hard to cultivate.

All:
We’re truly ashamed of ourselves.

Sawako:
It’s okay, in the end it wasn’t..

Ritsu:
Yeah you’re right. It’s your own fault for snapping like yo..

Sawako
I said already it was my fault, didn’t I ?

Ritsu:
I-I’m sorry!

Tsumgi:
Come in!

Student A:
Ahem.. Ms.Yamanaka? Is that you?

Sawako:
Huh?

Student A&B:
Thank you so much!

Student C:
I can’t believe it, you’re so awesome in the show last night!

Student B:
We can’t wait until the next time!

Sawako:
I don’t get it.

Yui:
It looks like Sawa-chan is popular no matter what she does.

Ritsu:
I'm thinking that maybe a band has to be way over the top so anyone's going to remember them.

Tsumugi:
Maybe.

Ritsu:
Okay let’s do it! Start from makeup on Mio!

Mio:
Don’t even think about it!

Tsumugi:
I’d rather like the whole idea of it.

Azusa:
You really go overboard with that stuff!

Yui:
that’s.. [indistinctive]
