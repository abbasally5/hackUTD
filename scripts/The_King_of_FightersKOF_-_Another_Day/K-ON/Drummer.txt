  Yui:
oh, he's so cute...

Tsumugi:
Mio, are you scared of it?

Mio:
I'm not scared.
I just haven't reached the point where I think it's cute yet.

Yui:
But he IS cute!
Right, ton-chan?

Tsumugi:
He loked at you.

Yui:
He's looking at me.
I'm right over here! Ton-chan!

Tsumugi:
Hey, ton-chan!

Yui:
You try calling him, to, Mio-chan!

Mio:
Ton-chan...
'Kay that was cute...

Yui:
Right? Right?

Azusa:
Yui senpai, if we're going to keep him, we have to look after him properly, too.
The water must be kept at a precise temperature and changed regularly.

Yui:
Wow, he's higher maintenance than Geeta.

Azusa:
He also has to be fed every day.

Tsumugi:
Oh, if you ever run low on food, I'll bring some from home.
We have Chinese pond turtles, Asian yellow pond turtles, and eastern musk turtles, too.

Mio:
She's and expert!

Azusa:
That would be a big help.

Yui:
Don't you worry, we're all gonna take real good care of you.

Mio:
That's right.
We won't get sick of you and just throw you away.

Ritsu:
I'm sick of this!
I'm sick of the drums!

Yui:
Ritchan, what's the matter?

-- #3 Drummer! --

Mio:
What do you mean, you're sick of the drums?

Ritsu:
Sorry! That was an exaggeration.
However... Look at this!
This is a club activity footage recorded by the student council.
I got it from Nodoka.

Tsumugi:
That's our freshman year.

Yui:
That takes me back.

Azusa:
I saw that one!

Mio:
We all saw Mio-senpai's--

Mio:
Stop the video!

Ritsu:
No way!
Look at where the drums are.

Yui:
You're all dark, Ritchan!
Your forehead is nice and bright!

Ritsu:
Hey, shut up!

Mio:
I guess the lights just aren't hitting you.

Azusa:
Yeah, because you're way in back.

Tsumugi:
When looking from straight on, you're the only one of us who isn't visible.

Ritsu:
And it's not just this show!
Last yesr's welcome show!

Tsumugi:
You're dark!

Ritsu:
And this year's welcome show!

Azusa:
Wow.
I think I saw your foot!

Mio:
Wow, the camera misses you completely.

Tsumugi:
Oh...

Azusa:
So... what do we do?

Ritsu:
I wanna play another instrument.

Mio:
Huh?
Wait just a minute.
You can't just change instruments.
Who's gonna play the drums if you don't?

Mio:
She hasn't thought this through.
Besides, weren't you the one who said you hated how "fiddly" all the other instruments were?

Ritsu:
That's true.
But maybe we should try switching instruments every once in a while.
Just relax.

Yui:
That sounds a lot of fun.

Tsumugi:
That's a great idea.


Yui:
Wanna try playing the guitar?

Ritsu:
Oh, is that okay?

Ritsu:
Ta-dah!

Tsumugi:
That suits you rather well!

Azusa:
Yeah, looking real good, senpai!

Mio:
It seems out of character.

Tsumugi:
Why don't you try playing something!

Azusa:
What's the matter, yui-senpai?

Yui:
Geeta's cheating on me!

Azusa:
You willingly handed him over with a smile on your face!

Yui:
Thank you, Geeta.
We had good times, you and I.

Azusa:
If it's not one thing, it's another...

Ritsu:
So, teacher, what do I do first?

Yui:
Me? Teacher?
Sure, Ritchan, I'll teach you.

Mio:
I'll just go make ourselves some tea.
She'll get bored of this sooner enough.

Yui:
You form the chord with your left hand and strum with your right one.

Ritsu:
Sorry, but I already know all that stuff.

Yui:
What should I teach you, then.

Azusa:
Fine, guess I'll be handling this.
For now, let's try playing Fuwa Fuwa Time.

Ritsu:
Yes, ma'am!
Let's see.

Azusa:
It might be easier if you played sitting down.

Ritsu:
Then I'll sit down.
Ready.

Azusa:
Okay, the first chord on the song is E.
Your index finger goes on string 3 at fret 1.
And um... the middle one on string 5 at fret 2.
And then your ring finger goes on string 4 at fret 2.

Ritsu:
Um...

Azusa:
Your index finger goes here.
And middle one here.
Just like this, you see?
Now, pressing down your fingers like that, strum the guitar.

Ritsu:
Hm.

Yui:
Um, Ritchan? xxx keep your right hand really relaxed like a xxx noodle.

Azusa:
And keep the fingers pressing on the strings curled more.
Some of the notes aren't coming out cleanly.

Yui:
Ritchan, you need to hold the pick gently, very gently.

Azusa:
Okay, the sound is starting to come together.
Ritsu-senpai, keep your back a little straighter.

Yui:
And you should move your left wrist forward a little bit.

Azusa:
So, shall we move on to the next chord?

Yui:
It's pretty tough to play, isn't it?

Ritsu:
I'm not cut out for this.

Azusa:
Uh?

Mio:
Huh?

Ritsu:
Wow, it's a big pain to have to keep track of all that stuff.
I had no idea.

Yui:
That's quite all right.
Welcome back Geeta.
Who's a good boy?


Students:
Good morning Miss Yamanaka.

Sawako:
Good morning.
Good morning Ritchan.

Ritsu:
Oh, hey, Sawa-cha--huhhh.
Sawa-chan is glowing!


Everyone:
Let's dig in!

Tsumugi:
Nodoka, your lunches always look so wonderfully delicious.

Yui:
Yeah, Nodoka-chan has alwalys been a terrific cook!

Mio:
So's Ui-chan.

Yui:
Am I the luckest xxx xxx xxx xxx what?

Nodoka:
I've noticed, your lunches are always packed full, Mugi?

Tsumugi:
Mm-hm. I plan for a lot of energy.

Nodoka:
On what?

Tsumugi:
Mio, your lunches always look so cute and xxx.

Yui:
Well, I guess your mother must still think of you as her darling little girl, huh?

Tsumugi:
What's Ritsu doing?

Yui:
Just wandering around.

Nodoka:
Like a bird.

Mio:
Kinda like Cozy Powell, in a good way.

Mio:
She's been restless for as long as I've known her.
She gets bored so easily.
But her druming has been the one constant.

Ritsu:
I'm back!

Yui:
Welcome home!

Yui:
Ritchan here!
Have some Nodoka-chan's omelette!

Ritsu:
Oh, Can I?
You already took a bite...


Ritsu:
And on that note, I'll be trying out the keyboard today!

Mio:
Exactly what note are you talking about?

Yui:
Another Shine On, You Crazy Ritchan installment?

Mio:
You don't understand, Yui! I have to shine!
When everyone has their eyes on you, that's when you sparkle!
Like her!

Sawako:
What was that?

Ritsu:
Just look at her!
Ever since Sawa-chan became our homeroom teacher, it's seemed like her skin's been glowing, and her hair's been silky and shiny.
It's like she's blossoming or something!

Sawako:
I guess I get more chances to take to the stage, a teachers lectern in this case, now that I'm a homeroom teacher.

Ritsu:
And I wanna sparkle, too!

Mio:
So, you're gonna trying out the keyboard.

Yui:
I said "Bingo"!

Azusa:
Can you read sheet music, Ritsu-senpai?

Yui:
It said "I read it fine"!

Mio:
How can she interpret that?
You're making trouble for Mugi, so-- 
Or not.

Tsumugi:
My keyboard is actually speaking!

Tsumugi:
Oh, it just said "Mugi-chan"!

Yui:
It did, it did!

Mio:
Oh, brother...

Ritsu:
It's neat how you can get so many different tones out of a keyboard.

Tsumugi:
I'm getting all sorts of wonderful ideas for new songs!

Azusa:
What kind of songs?

Yui:
This is so cool!

Mio:
That looks like fun.
Mugi, you think I might be all to have a try?

Ritsu:
Hahaha...

Mio:
Stop that!
I hate that!
Ritsu, stop making that sound.

Ritsu:
xxx, I'b zorry.

Mio:
What're are you doing?

Ritsu:
Jerk!

Yui:
Hey, Ritchan!
Aren't you gonna try playing the bass?

Mio:
No, not bass.

Yui:
Why not?

Mio:
I'm on bass...
And I don't ever wanna play anything but the bass.
I only wanna be a bassist.
I just love its low, deep sound.
The way it supports all of you without ever standing out...
I also like writing bass lines that fit in with everything you're doing.
One who doesn't take center stage,
but doesn't get drowned out by the other members.
That's the kind of bassist I always wanna be.

Ritsu:
I know, Mio.
That's why I'll never touch your bass, Mio.
So, don't worry about it!

Yui:
Oh, I do declare I'm kind of jelous, Miss Tainaka!

Ritsu:
Don't be like that!

Mio:
I said way too much...

Yui:
Uh-oh! Hey, Mio-chan! Mio-chan, hello!
Oh, She's turning into one of the living dead!

Ritsu:
That is so great.

Tsumugi:
It's just like Mio and her bass are one and the same.

Azusa:
I know what you mean.
I love her bass playing.

Tsumugi:
Mm-hm. So do I.

Yui:
Oh, come on. How long is she gonna stay stiff as a board.
Oh! Don't worry, Ritchan.
Just leave everything to me.
I'm gonna work this all out, you'll see.
Snap out of it, Mio.

Ritsu:
What am I leaving to her?


Ui:
Sis? What are you doing?
That's bad manners, you know?

Yui:
I'm sitting here in the dark corner trying to formulate Operation: Shine On, You Crazy Ritchan.

Ui:
Huh? Well, I'd like to wash the dishes, but...
I guess it can wait.


-- eye catch--


Camera Man:
Okay, here we go!

Sawako:
There's another class after us, so get into position quickly, all right?

Girl1:
How do you want us to line up?

Sawako:
Um, by seat number?

Girl2:
Wouldn't it better if we lined up by height?

Sawako:
Oh, you're right. Thank you for that.
This is the very first homeroom class I ever had,
so please, if I make any mistakes, be sure to point them out.

Girl1:
Miss Yamanaka is really great.

Girl2:
It's like she's getting prettier and prettier every day.

Mio:
I like being on the end.

Tsumugi:
I think I'll stand here!

Ritsu:
Scuse me!
Could you squeeze over just a little bit?

Mio:
We're lining up by height, remember?

Ritsu:
Watch this!

Tsumugi:
Ah! Ritchan, you've grown taller!

Mio:
You're sneaky.

Yui:
Look! We're all together!

Mio:
I guess we're not going by height anymore.

Ritsu:
I say we're better off being all together.

Yui:
Me, too. It's gonna be a great class picture!

Sawako:
So is everyone in position?

Sawako:
All right. Whenever you're ready!

Camera Man:
Okay! Everybody smile!
Say cheese.


Yui:
Hey, this is great!

Ritsu:
What are you doing?

Yui:
Ritchan! We moved the drum set around!
See? you're smack in the middle now!

Ritsu:
Aw...

Yui:
I was thinking this idea all night long.
You are right about changing things!
Come on, try it out, try it out!

Ritsu:
All right, Yui.

Yui:
Okay! We'll use this position from now on!

Ritsu:
I'm embarrassed...

Sawako:
I think this works best.

Everyone:
Yeah, so do I.

Yui:
But don't worry, Ritchan!
You'll so shine!

Ritsu:
Ugh!

Yui:
I'm gonna use this headlamp to light you.

Ritsu:
Cut it out!

Yui:
Shine on, you crazy Ritchan!

Mio:
Stop it! Yui, Look at her!
She's gasping for breath.

Yui:
Oopsie!

Yui:
Hey, Ritchan, you aren't lonely, are you?

Ritsu:
Why do you ask?

Yui:
Well, you're always in the back, so I thought you might feel lonely.

Ritsu:
No, not really.

Yui:
What if we try something new?
When we're playing, we'll just interact with you more.
Kinda like this!

Yui:
Right! Now you gyus try it!
Let's practice how we're gonna interact with Ritchan, who's feeling lonely there in the back!

Yui:
Let's do it! One, two!
Doesn't that work perfectly?!

Ritsu:
Yui, you don't understand...
That's really not why I am doing this...

Yui:
Don't go it alone.
Ritchan, if you're hurting, we're all hurting!
I won't let you suffer alone!

Ritsu:
Yui, Look, I'm not suffering!

Yui:
Let's get through this together!

Ritsu:
Why won't you listen to me?!

Yui:
Aw, and I brought all this other stuff, too.

Azusa:
Just give it up, Yui, and take it all back home.

Yui:
Hey, Azu-nyan?

Azusa:
Yes?

Yui:
If Ritchan doesn't play the drums, I was thinking I might take over.

Azusa:
HUh? Why do you say that?

Yui:
Well, something's really bothering Ritchan, I know it.
It's like she is in a--
What's the word I'm looking for?
Sounds like "gut"... Not "mutt"..

Azusa:
Wait, do you mean rut?

Yui:
Yeah, that!

Azusa:
Then you were pretty far off.

Yui:
I think that's why she suddenly wants to try out a bunch of different things.

Azusa:
You really think so?

Yui:
That's why I'm gonna start playing the drums!
I'll just sit behind you gyus and play the drums!

Azusa:
Maybe not.
I think I'd rather you stay where I can see you.

Yui:
Aw, why?

Azusa:
You're reading too much into it, Senpai.


Sawako:
This will make my skin glow even more!


Ritsu:
Thinking about it,
I just realize that I haven't play my drums for a few days.
I was the one who suggested it, but...
I've played the drums every day, ever since I decided I was going to be a drummer.
Let's start a band, Mio!
And I'll be the drummer!

Mio:
Sounds like fun, but why the drums?

Ritsu:
Isn't it awesome, how they flail around back there?!

Mio:
Oh...

Ritsu:
Well, I could only afford drumsticks at first.
And later on, I finally got my hands on a used drum kit.
And every day since...
I still have some calluses.
I really whaled away on them at first.

Satoshi:
Sis! Keep it down!


Mio:
How could you have overslept?!

Ritsu:
I was up late watching a movie!

Mio:
Huh?

Ritsu:
In a village far from civilization, they had this horrific comstom where they--

Ritsu:
I'm kidding. It was a WHO concert.

Mio:
What?

Ritsu:
The WHO.

Mio:
Oh, right. You like that band's drummer, don't you, Ritsu?

Ritsu:
Crap! Mio, get a move on!

Sawako:
Please make sure you fill out the self-study activity form for the class trip by tomorrow, okay?
There are so many temples it will seem daunting,
but plan ahead to give yourselves enough time to visit each in turn.

Yui:
Ritchan! Mio-chan! I thought you were home sick!

Ritsu:
Shhh...!

Ritsu:
Sorry about that!

Sawako:
All right, take your seats, please.

Ritsu:
Sawa-chan.

Yui:
What's wrong, Sawa-chan?

Ritsu:
It's freaky.

Sawako:
I've been trying all sorts of creams to make my skin glow even more...

Yui:
Oh my goodness...

Yui, Ritsu:
You overdid it.



Ritsu:
Ta-dah!
It's drums or nothing for me!

Mio:
Yeah, I figured as much.
She told me she watched Keith Moon DVD yesterday.

Yui:
Who's that?

Mio:
He's a drummer Ritsu really admires.

Azusa:
Oh, he's the guy they called Moon the Loon and Mad Moon, right?
I heard he demolished his house with cherry bombs or something.

Ritsu:
Well, that's not what I admire about him.
You know, even if I'm in the shadows and I'm not in the spotlight, and you could only see my feet...
I still love playing my drums.

Yui:
Yeah!
No one but you can be our drummer!

Ritsu:
Yui?

Yui:
When we all look back at you when we are just about to start a song,
you count us in with your sticks and you have a big grin on you face.
That always gets me so pumped up!

Yui:
Besides, I also learned some things thanks to you.
Even though we're all in the same band, but we see and think of something very different.
We all have our own places here, and each of us is different.
But when--

Ritsu:
But when we start playing, we become one!

Yui:
Right!

Ritsu:
You know, as I sit down on my stall and watch your backs...
I listen to you play and I bang away on my drums!
I love it!

Tsumugi:
Oh, I also did something thanks to you.
I wrote us a brand new song.
And it was all because you make my keyboard speak to me that day.

Mio:
You mean those noises?

Azusa:
What kind of song is it?

Yui:
I wanna hear it!

Ritsu:
Yeah, I like it!

Yui:
Hey I think you should paly and sing this one, Mugi-chan?

Azusa:
Great idea!

Mio:
Yeah, that might work!

Ritsu:
Mio, get to work on the lyrics!

Tsumugi:
Um, you guys, I also thought of a real good title of the song.

Yui:
What is it, what is it?

Tsumugi:
I call it "Honey Sweet Teatime."

Ritsu:
Tea again, huh?

Yui:
Wow, those rusks are fantastic when you put honey all over them!

Ritsu:
It's the intermingling of flavors, the combination of tastes.

Azusa:
Um you've got some sticky stuff on the side of your mouth.

Yui:
Hm? Wipe it for me, will ya?

Azusa:
No way!

Ritsu:
They're a good team in their own way.

Azusa:
Here, wipe it yourself!
What am I gonna do with you?

Mio:
The honey-colored afternoon passes by...

Azusa:
You've got it all?

Mio:
And it's honey sweet teatime.

Tsumugi:
Hey, how would it sound if we repeated that phrase twice?

Mio:
Hmm... That could work!

Mio:
I can't concentrate...

Tsumugi:
Well then, maybe we should all just take a break.

Mio:
Mm-hm.
