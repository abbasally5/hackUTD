  Yui:
Hello turtle, Mr. Turtle, Mr. Turtle Hello. In all the world xxxx nothing walks as slow as you walk in how you go, Why are you, why are you Mr. Turle, why are you so slow.

Whoa..!!

Nodoka:
Hey, Yui, come here! Hey, come on!

Yui:
Ah, Nodoka-chan.

Nodoka:
Look, we're leaving to go on a walk now.

Yui:
Wait for me, wait for me!

Yui:
[Groans]

Nodoka:
What are you groaning about, Yui?

Yui:
Oh, hi! Nodoka-chan. I can't decide on my top school choice.

Nodoka:
What!? Did you mean you haven't submitted your life plan's questionnaire yet!? But, that was supposed to be in ages ago!

Yui:
But, but I'm not really smart about this stuff. And I don't really know which universities are good!

Nodoka:
Yui, at this rate, you really ARE gonna end up in NEET.

Yui:
This time that word sounds like an actual threat!!

--------------- OP ------------------

Yui:
Hmm.. I give up, I'll be a NEET. N E E T..

Nodoka:
Stop that, Yui.

Yui:
What about you? What did you put down for top school choice?

Nodoka:
Who, me? I put one of the national universities. I know it's a bit of the long shot, but.. I figured that I give it a try anyway.

Yui:
Cool! Then I'll put that down, too.

Nodoka:
What!?

Yui:
But I wanna go to the same school as you, Nodoka-chan!!

Nodoka:
[sighs]

RItsu:
Hey, what's the ruckus? Let's go practice.

Nodoka:
The thing is, Yui still hasn't..

Mio:
Yui, you still haven't decided on a school yet?

Yui:
Mio, what school did you put down? What's your top pick?

Mio:
Well actually I thought I'd try for recommendations.

Yui:
Recommendations you.

Nodoka:
Yui, do you even know what recommendations are?

Yui:
No.
Where are you going, Mugi-chan?

Tsumugi:
To the women's university I told you all about.

Mio:
Oh wow, very prestigious!

Yui:
I'll put that one, too!

Nodoka:
Yui, will you just give it a rest.

Yui:
Is it hard to get into your school, Mugi-chan?

Tsumugi:
Well I suppose. I have the test prep guide, if you'd like to take a look.

Ritsu:
Let me see. AH! English!??

Yui:
My eyes are seeing flashes.

Mio:
Welcome to the real world.

Ritsu:
Fists, Japan! We don't need no speaking English here!

Yui:
xxx !

Ritsu:
We'll stand strong! We shall live by Japanese alone!

Yui:
xxx!

Ritsu:
Hahahahaha!

Mio:
If you flunk English in school, you'll get held back a year.

Ritsu&Yui:
[Gasp]

Tsumugi:
But on the entrance exam, you'll do find if you get good marks on some other subjects. See? It also has Japanese.

Yui:
Really? Right. Ritchan hand off!

Ritsu:
All-right! See. Select: which of the following auxiliary verbs is used in the same manner. Hum! Hm, hm. Hhm. I never learned any of this!!

Mio:
We covered that our freshman year.

Ritsu:
Ehh. But that's- that's- that's... IMPOSSIBLE!

Tsumugi:
Didn't you learn how to memorize auxiliary verbs with the song?

Yui
The song?

Tsumugi:
Musu musu chi shi mu, Mashi ma ho shi..

Yui:
Ru rara ru sa su, Ri ri ri. Tsu nu tari keri tashi ta shi ke ke nu. Ranu beshi rashi mashi nari meri. Why are you why are you so tari gotoshi.
That's it, right?

Mio:
You see, you do know them.

Yui:
So, erm, what do I do with all those?

Mio:
What's the point of knowing the song, then!?

Yui:
So what school did you pick, Ritchan?

Ritsu:
I just wrote "Undecided". I mean, I have no idea what I wanna do with my life yet.

Yui:
Oh, right. I'll just put down "Undecided", too then.

Mio:
Is that a good idea?

Ristu:
Our future can't be decided by a misery scrap of paper!

Yui:
Hail, man!

Sawako:
Ms. Tainaka and Ms. Hirasawa, please report to the staff room immediately.

Yui&Ritsu:
Ehh!?

Mio:
Of course it isn't.

Yui:
You guys just go on up to the clubroom without us, alright?

Ritsu:
What a hussle..

Nodoka:
Oh, brother.

Mio:
You sure have your hands full with her.

Nodoka:
You too, Mio. With Ritsu. She hasn't changed one bit from way back when she was a little girl. But believe it or not, she's improved a lot.

Mio:
And Ritsu can pretty much do anything she set her mind to.

Nodoka:
It's the same with Yui. She can have amazing focus.

Tsumugi:
Hey, could we please continue this up in the clubroom?

Mio:
Wow, what are you suddenly so amped up about, Mugi?




Azusa:
Good afternoon.

Mio&Nodoka&Tsumugi:
Good afternoon.

Nodoka:
Pardon me intrusion.

Azusa:
That's summon was for Yui senpai and Ritsu senpai, right?

Mio:
Yea. They brought it on themselves though.

Azusa:
Oh, did they do something again?

Nodoka:
Again?

Tsumugi:
Erm, it seems like they were being called in to discuss their future plans, that's all.

Azusa:
Huh..

Tsumugi:
Here is your tea, Nodoka-chan.

Nodoka:
Thank you, Mugi.

Mio:
I've been wondering, when did you and Yui first meet each other?

Nodoka:
Way back in kindergarden.

Tsumugi:
Goodness, so how did you two meet?

Nodoka:
Well, there really wasn't anything special about it, I guess.

Yui:
Wanna draw together?

Nodoka:
Un, okay.
Before I knew it, she was sitting there next to me.

Mio:
Maybe she knew instinctively that she can count on you.

Nodoka:
Un? Yui, are you done already?

Yui:
Ha ha, yours looks so yummy!

Nodoka:
Yes it does.

Yui:
AAhhh..

Nodoka:
No! Don't eat that!

Mio&Tsumugi&Azusa:
[chuckle]

Mio:
She was like that even as a baby?

Nodoka:
Right. We ended up being in the same class at school every single year after that. We definitely have some sort of strange connection.

Azusa:
I bet that she's caused a lot of troubles to you, hasn't she?

Nodoka:
Huh. Well, not sure you could really call that trouble..
We went camping one time in grade school.

We were supposed to bring instant meals.

Yui:
AH! Ahhhh...

Azusa:
That's sounds like her all right.

Nodoka:
And there was this other time when we were making takoyaki in home ec. We were each assigned an ingredient to bring from home.
'Kay, I'm ready for the octopus.
Yui was in charge of bringing the octopus, but she'd forgotten it. We ended up making octopus-free takoyaki.

Yui:
Hah! Even without octopus, it's really good!

Mio:
[chuckes] Octopus free!?

Nodoka:
You know I could tell you the stories about stunts she's pulled until the cows come home. But when you see that innocent look on her face, you just can't help but forgive her everything.

Tsumugi&Mio:
I know what you mean.

Azusa:
You do? Because I'm completely lost.

Nodoka:
By the way, when I told you earlier that in spite of everything, Yui had improved quite a bit, I think that it's all because of the Light Music Club. So thank you.

Tsumugi:
Nodoka-chan, you're so mature!

Mio:
You sure are. You're almost like a mummy!

Tsumugi&Azusa:
A mummy?

Mio:
Ah, Uh! I meant. mother!!



Sawako:
This is your future we're talking about, so put some thought into it.

Ritsu:
Oh right.

Sawako:
And you still can't decide, Yui-chan?

Yui:
It seems like, it's so far off in the future that it's hard to picture it.

Sawako:
Well it's not far off at all. It's almost here.

Ritsu:
That's explains why you keep looking older!

Sawako:
Did you say something.

Yui:
Ahh, sawachan. Hey, you know you looked like that back in high school, so what is it that made you wanna become a teacher?

Sawako:
Eh.. well, uh... that's..

Yui:
Oh! What is it, what is it!?

Sawako:
Uh..It's a little bit embarrassing.

Ritsu:
We wanna learn from your example, so tell us everything!

Sawako:
There was this boy I liked, and he said he wanted to be a teacher someday. And I said "So do I"!!

RItsu:
Talk about impure motives.

Yui:
So what eventually happened between you and the boy?

Sawako:
He just dumped me! [sobbing]

Yui:
Yeah. But thanks to that boy, you went to college, and got your degree, and became a great teacher, right?

Ritsu:
Yeah! I mean it's not the past that counts, it's the here and now, Sawa-chan.

Yui:
But you don't have a boyfriend at here and now, either.

Sawako:
[cries]



Mio:
Oh. So, how did it go, Yui?

Yui:
Well, we learned one more thing about Sawa-chan's interesting past!

Mio:
Oh? So she didn't chew you two out?

Ritsu:
See guys, you never really know what the life hold for us, do ya?ã€€

Mio:
Wait, you didn't pull another one of your stunts, did you?

Ritsu:
No, no. I just mean that whenever life throws you for a loop, it can make you stronger.

Nodoka:
Then, she was okay with your future plan's questionaire?

Yui:
No, one bit.

Tsumugi:
Isn't there anything you wanna be when you grow up?

Yui:
Something that I wanna be... Huh. Mio-chan, what do you think I should wanna be?

Mio:
Decide it for yourself.

Nodoka:
Hmm... Back in middle school, didn't you say that you wanted to be a kindergarden teacher?

Yui:
That's right, I did!

Nodoka:
I think it was when we were reading our essay on the topic of our future dreams in front of the class.

Yui:
My dream of the future is to be a kindergarden teacher someday. I wanna become a kindergarden teacher and playing with kids all day until they go home.

Classmates:
[laugh]

All:
[laugh]

Mio:
Sounds like Yui.

Ritsu:
Speaking of reading essays in class, there was this one time when Mio actually won an award.

Mio
NO! You can't tell them about that!!

Tsumugi:
Oh, tell us!

Yui:
Yes, please!

Mio:
A-Azusa! Let's go and practice, okay?!
AH! Ehh..

Ritsu:
You're not getting out of this one, Mio. Give it up.


[SIDE B]


Ritsu:
Even back in grade school, Mio was a quiet mild mannered girl. She always seemed to have her nose in a book.

Mio:
"Huh?"

RItsu:
"Hmm."
And that's when.
"Hey! What are you reading!? "
She was even more shy back then than she is now.
"Com'on! Let me see, let me see! "
I love seeing her reactions.
"Wow, Mio-chan! You're great at drawing!"
I was teasing her constantly.
"Wow, Mio you got a handred!!"

Yui:
You're so lucky Ritchan, I wish I could have teased her, too.

Azusa:
Don't you think that was more like bullying?

Ritsu:
No. Totally different! In gradeschool you always tease the kids you like. Everybody knows that. It's just what you do. But we don't really get along all that well at first, did we, Mio?

Mio:
Of course not that I felt that's teasing you did to me! I'm getting ticked off just by thinking about it. Now, show me your forehead.

Ritsu:
Uh, what are you gonna do? ...Huh? My forehead.

Mio:
Relax. It's a water based marker.

Nodoka:
So tell us, what exactly happened when you were reading your essays?

Mio:
Oh, you remember that.

Ritsu:
Oh, let you know Mio. Just tell them the story.

Ritsu:
???

Mio:
We were in the fourth grade, and I received an award from my prefecture for my essay. But all the award winner had to read their essays in front of everyone at an all school assembly. I was depressed, because I didn't wanna read mine. And that's when...

Ritsu:
"What's wrong?"

Mio:
"Uh.."
Ritsu came up to talk to me.

Ritsu:
"You don't wanna read your essay at the assembly? But why not? "

Mio:
"Because I'm really embarrassed."

Ritsu:
"Don't be embarrassed, Mio-chan! You're awesome! "

Mio:
"I am not! I'm just regular.."

Ritsu:
"Mio-chan, you're the only one in the whole class to get an award! If it was me, I would be rubbing it in everybody's face! "

Mio:
"Then you should one of us taking an award 'cos I don't want it! I don't want to go in front of everyone and read it..!! I-I'm so sorry... "

Ritsu:
"Whao. I didn't know Mio-chan could yell so loud. That's... So cool!! Hey, come to my house for some.. special training! Just come on! "
"Without further ado, grade four class one, seat number one, Mio Akiyama! "

Mio:
"But I can't do it...!"

Ritsu:
"Is the platform too low? Want me to make it higher?"

Mio:
"No, it has nothing to do with that!"

Ritsu:
"Hmm.. Oh! Give me just a minute. First off, take this off, and do this... Sorta like this, I guess. Right! Okay, well done! "

MIo:
"What are you doing?"


Ritsu:
"I'm a pineapple! My dad told me that whenever we're nervous, just imagine that everyone in the audiences are big fat potatos! But I have no idea how to do a potato impression, so instead, pineapple! Look at me, Mio, pineapple! "

Mio:
"Haha! No you're not! "

Ritsu&Mio:
[Chuckle]

Mio:
"And so, it was passed down, from one person to the next. The end. Grade four, class one, Mio Akiyama. "
Thanks to Ritsu's help, I was finally able to relax.

Tsumugi:
What a wonderful story!

Azusa:
Wow, you used to be really nice, Ritsu-senpai.

Yui:
That's so out of character for you, Ritchan.

RItsu:
Geez! Don't you two even know how to compliment someone!!?

Azusa:
So, did Mio's essay go over well? Everybody really like it?

Ritsu:
Well, it was something that Mio wrote, so it had a serious fairy tale vibe.
[Itchy, itchy, itchy....!!]
You can just imagine.

Azusa:
Yeah.

Mio:
But it was right after that, that I started going over to your house all the time, Ritsu, you remember?

Ritsu:
Yeah. And I started teaching you all sorts of cool stuff, didn't I?

Mio:
Right. Lots of things.

Ritsu:
To overcome shyness, you've gotta learn to have some self-confidence okay?
You start with how you speak. If you say "dude" at the end of sentences, you sound confident.

Mio:
Uh, my name is Mio Akiyama, duuude.

Ritsu:
Good, good. Just like that!

Mio:
Lots of things.
You didn't teach me anything that wasn't rude or crude. Maybe I should never have gone to you for help back then.

Yui:
Oh, that's so mean, Mio-chan!

Mio
You said mean things to her just a minute ago.
But, I am grateful to her for introducing me music, and playing in the band, I guess.

All:
Mio-chan!!!

MIo:
Hey! We weren't talking about me and Ritsu! We were talking about what to do about you and your futures!

Yui:
Ah, uh..

Nodoka:
Yeah she's right . Don't try to think of anything specific first. Just start out by thinking of very general terms of what you might wanna be.

Yui:
Okay. Then a florist maybe?

Azusa:
Hey, that sounds like a good thing to be.

Yui:
Hi, I'm Yui Hirasawa. The town florist.

A customer:
Hmm, is this type of flower difficult to care for?

Yui:
No idea.

Azusa:
Right. You need to know about plants to do that.

Yui:
Then how about an office worker at some company!?

Azusa:
Hmm...

Yui:
Hi, I'm rookie office worker. I'm getting late today.
I'm sorry, I'm late! I overslept! Ah.

Man:
You work at the company that's two doors down the hall, Ms.

Yui:
R-Right! Sorry, bye!!

Azusa:
Anything with fixed hours might be a problem.

Yui:
That was mean, Azunyan.

Ritsu:
Being a bus tour guide might be fun!

Yui:
Yeah, I can go to all sort of places free!

Azusa:
That might work.

Yui:
I'm a bus tour guide. Now, everyone look at the right of the bus, you'll see, Umm..

Azusa:
That might be a bad idea for someone who gets carsick.

Ritsu:
Hmm..
What about trying a waitress?

Yui:
Hehehe, I'm a waitress.

Mio:
They have to remember big orders all the time.

RItsu:
How about a pastry chef?

Yui:
Look! I'm a pastry chef!

Tsumugi:
I think she'd eat everything herself!

Ritsu:
Yeah. You have a point there.

Nodoka:
For now, I think you should just put down the very first thing that comes to your mind.

Yui:
The first thing that comes, huh?
RItchan! I got it!

Ritsu:
Yeah!! Ahaha!



Sawako:
Rejected.

Yui&Ritsu:
What??

Ritsu:
What's the deal?

Yui:
We fill that out, didn't we?

Sawako:
Huh.

Yui:
The mission was the failure, commander!

Nodoka:
So you wrote, musician?

Mio:
You should take this seriously!

Ritsu:
But we were being totally serious, MIo?

Nodoka:
[manic laughter]

Yui:
Geez! Nodoka-chan is laughing at us!

Azusa:
But not because it's funny.

Yui:
You see, this whole thing was actually an elaborate gag designed by Ritchan and I to make Nodoka-chan laugh!

Mio:
You know they're never gonna buy that story, Yui.




Yui:
Ui, what are you gonna do after you graduate?

Ui:
[I can't tell her. I can't say that I want to go to the same school as her because I worry about her. ]
Uh, I really haven't thought that much about it yet.

Yui:
Oh. Well, you need to give it a lot of thought before next year.

Ui:
How about you, sis?

Yui:
I'm thinking about it right now.

Ui:
Ah! She hasn't decided yet!

Yui:
Huh.

Classmate A:
Well, I always wanna be a beautician. So i'm going to go to a beauty academy.

Yui:
Oh, okay.

Classmate B:
Art university. I'm gonna go study photography.

Yui:
You mean there're schools for photography?

Classmate C:
University of foreign study. So I can study in China.

Yui:
Huh.

Classmate D:
I decided to go to nursing school.

Classmate E:
Help run my family's liquor store.

Yui:
Hmm. And what should I ever to put down?

Nodoka:
Hhm.

Yui:
Please do me honor of accepting this!!

Sawako:
Hmm. [cough] Rejected.

Yui:
Thank you for your time.

Nodoka:
Huh.


[PREVIEW]

Ritsu:
Oh. What the heck is wrong, Sawa-chan?

Sawako:
I'm having big time to

Yui:
That might just work!

Azusa:
I don't know who I am anymore.

Granny:
Yui-chan.

Yui:
Ah! Granny!
Thank you so much! Thank you for always look af..

Granny:
What are you doing now?

Yui:
Hehehe..
