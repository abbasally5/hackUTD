  Ritsu:
One, two, three, four!
One, two!

-- OP --

Mio:
Today is the big day...
I wonder if Yui and the others are here already?
Sorry I'm...

-- #6: School Festival! --

Yui:
Step right up, step right up!
It's a bargain, it's a bargain!

Mio:
Wait, that voice...

Yui:
Right.
A serving for one. Enjoy!
Thanks, young lady.

Girl:
Thanks!

Mio:
Geez, Yui!
What are you doing?

Yui:
Mio! Want some yakisoba?
It'll be just a minute!

Mio:
Why is this happening...?
We perform today.
We don't have time to mess around.
We have to get together and practice like crazy!

Yui:
Sorry.
I really wanna practice, too.
But I got put on the morning shift at my class' booth that I have to stay.

Mio:
Oh...

Girl:
Thank you very much!

Girl:
Looks like we tripped the breaker.

Girl:
Aw, again?

Girl:
Hey, it'll be undercooked!

Girl:
How many times has this happened today already?

Girl:
Hey, come on!
You're not supposed to have more than three hot plates at a time.
You know the rules?

Girl:
It's not us!
I bet you anything, it's Class 5!

Mio:
Seems like a rough gig here...

Ritsu:
Thank you, come again!

Hey, Mio.

Mio:
Ritsu, do you wanna try and get in some practice before our show today?

Ritsu:
Oh, now's no good for me!
Just take a look at the line I've still got waiting back there.

Mio:
Well, isn't there anyone here who can take over for you?

Ritsu:
Not really.
You see, I was the one who suggested doing this haunted house.
So I have to oversee at lease the first few hours here.

Mio:
Ah. Where was Mugi, then?

Ritsu:
Thank you so much!
Hope you enjoyed it!
Right, next in line, please!

Girl:
It looks scary...

Guy:
It'll be fun! Don't worry!

Mio:
In here?

Ritsu:
Yep. It's okay for class members to go in.
It's dark, so watch your step.

Mio:
M-Mugi, you in here?
Ahh!
Mugi, w-where are you?

Tsumugi:
Mio, it's me.

Mio:
Mugi...
Ahhh!


Yui:
Thanks! Hope you enjoy it!
Nodoka-chan!

Nodoka:
Your voice is still scratchy.
You gonna be all right?

Yui:
It's still a little bit sore from club practice, that's all.
I'm gonna be just fine.

Nodoka:
Isn't today your first performance?
You go on at 3, right?

Yui:
Yeah.

Nodoka:
Well, you still have a fair amount of time until then.
Don't you wanna go and get in some practice?

Yui:
Yeah. I'm planing to do that as soon as I get finished with my shift.

Nodoka:
In that case, go ahead and take off.
I'll ask around and see if there's someone who can take over the rest of your shift for you.

Yui:
Okay, but...

Nodoka:
You just go on ahead.
I'll take care of it.

Girl:
Yui

Yui:
Huh?

Girl:
What are you waiting for?

Girl2:
Go practice!

Yui:
Thanks! I'll be back!
Oops, xxx sorry about that, sonny!

Ritsu:
Go on in! Enjoy yourselves!

Yui:
Ritchan!

Ritsu:
Hey!

Yui:
Where are Mio and Mugi?

Ritsu:
Your voice hasn't come back yet, huh?

Yui:
No, I'm afraid it still sounds a little raspy.

Ritsu:
Try saying something like "Thank you for the grub"!

Yui:
Thank you for the grub!

Ritsu:
Ha. You sound like a sumo wrestler!

Yui:
Treat a training match as a tournament, and a tournament as if it were a training match!

Ritsu:
Sumo is not a national sport, it is a martial art!

Yui:
Is this what it means to be defeated in the ring, but victorious in technique?

Ritsu:
Dosukoi, Dosukoi, Dosukoi!

Yui:
Dosukoi! Dosukoi!
Oh! So, where's Mio-chan and Mugi-chan?

Ritsu:
I'm sorry, I couldn't resist!
Mugi is working inside here, but Mio might have gone on up to the club room.

Yui:
C'mon, we gotta get in some practice!

Ritsu:
You're right, we should.
Mugi and and I are gonna be relieved soon, so we'll meet upstairs just as soon as we can.

Yui:
Got it.

Ritsu:
We're gonna practice, huh?
Next in line, step right up!


Ritsu:
What're you doing, Yui?

Yui:
Shhh!

Tsumugi:
Wow.

Ritsu:
I bet she's been practicing up here all morning.

Tsumugi:
Yes.

Ritsu:
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mio!

Tsumugi:
We're sorry we left you by yourself.

Yui:
Yeah, we all wanna practice, too!

Mio:
You guys...
What kept you?!

Ritsu:
Yeah, all right!
That didn't sound too bad at all.

Tsumugi:
Oh, yes. That was perfect.

Yui:
You think you can do this, Mio-chan?

Mio:
Mm-hm

Tsumugi:
We'll play it just like that.

Sawako:
I knew I'd find you here!

Yui:
Is there a problem, Miss Yamanaka?

Sawako:
Although it wasn't voluntary, I AM your Club's adviser.
So I thought I ought to do something to help you out.
I made costumes for each of you!

Ritsu:
You were way too into this!
Miss Yamanaka, we appreciate the sentiment and all.

Mio:
You expect me to put that on and sing in front of the whole school?

Ritsu:
But not the best timing.

Sawako:
I don't understand.
Are you telling me that you don't care for them.
If you want you could always wear my old costume?

Mio:
I certainly feel like that last outfit wasn't so bad!

Ritsu:
Stop it, Miss Yamanaka!
Mio isn't the only one who'd be embarrassed to wear this stuff.

Mio:
That's right!

Sawako:
Gosh, you really mean that?
But I worked so hard on making them...
And besides... Yui-chan and Mugi-chan are only too happy to wear theirs.

Ritsu:
Would you two cut it out!

Mio:
Why is all of this happening?

Sawako:
You're not still nervous, are you?
How about I give you a makeup job so insane, no one will know it's you?!

Mio:
No-No-No, thank you!

Sawako:
Right! You go and break a leg out there, girls!


Yui:
Ahh! Oh, no!
All this craziness has made me forget everything I'm supposed to do!

Tsumugi:
Let's practice then!
It's the only real cure!

Ritsu:
She's right, let's practice!
Pretend that didn't happen... That didn't happen...

Mio:
He he he...


-- Eye Catch --


Ritsu:
Okay, go ahead and carry this down to the auditorium.

Yui:
Okay.

Ritsu:
It's pretty heavy, so be careful.

Yui:
By the way, how's Mio-chan doing?

Ritsu:
Well, I'm having Mio focus on something else.

Mio:
I'm on vocals...
In front of the whole school...
Ow...

Ritsu:
That's obviously what will happen.
It's just way too risky to have her move any equipment around.

Yui:
Oh yeah, I see...


Yui:
There's not a bead of sweat on her!

Nodoka-chan...

Nodoka:
Ah, Yui.
The play is just getting started now, so leave that in the corner, okay?

Yui:
Gotcha...
Whew...

Nodoka:
All right, the Choir Club is up next, and the Light Music Club is after that.
And all their equipment is here.

Yui:
It's almost time!


Yui:
We're finally done moving at all.

Ritsu:
Yeah, good work.

Tsumugi:
Tea's ready! Come on and get it, you two!

Yui:
Yay! That's our Mugi-chan!
Ritchan, you and Mio are childhood friends, aren't you?

Ritsu:
Yeah, that's right.

Yui:
For how long would you say?

Ritsu:
We've been joined at the hip since kindergarten!
Uh... No way, maybe it was since grade school?

Yui:
Then you're not really childhood friends.
Now, has Mio-chan always been the shy type ever since she was just a little girl?

Ritsu:
You'd better believe it.
There was one time.

Ritsu(Child):
Oh my, you got really pretty hair!

Ritsu:
When I said to her...

Ritsu(Child):
Oh, Wow!
You're left-handed!
That's really cool!
Everybody!, Mio-chan's so awesome!

Ritsu:
When I said stuff like that, she'd go totally beet-red and get all frustrated and embarrassed!

Yui:
Well, that was your fault the way she is, Ritchan!

Mio:
Has all the equipment been carried over?

Yui:
Mio-chan!

Ritsu:
You got your nerves under control?

Mio:
Mm?

Tsumugi:
Here you are.

Ritsu:
Surprising, considering how you were against doing vocals.

Mio:
Get real.
I'm not a baby, you know.
I can't let myself freak out over every little thing forever.

Everyone:
Oh yeah, she's totally freaking out!


Ritsu:
We're about to go on in a few minutes!
How are you gonna perform in your condition?

Mio:
I can't do it.
Oh, Ritsu, please do the vocals for me!

Ritsu:
If I did that, who would play the drums then?

Mio:
I'll play them, please!

Ritsu:
Then who's supposed to play the bass?!

Mio:
I'll play the bass, too, please!

Ritsu:
Have it your way!
I'd love to see how you're gonna boogaloo!

Mio:
Ritsu...! Ritsu...!

Ritsu:
Would you please get off me, Mio!

Mio:
Ritsu... Ritsu... Ritsu...

Yui:
This is all my fault. I'm sorry, Mio-chan.
If I hadn't overdone [and it did] to my voice, you wouldn't have to go up on stage and sing today.

Mio:
Yui...

Yui:
Don't worry, I'll handle the vocals, okay?!

Ritsu:
No, no, no, no...

Mio:
Yui, I'm sorry.
That's not what I wanted, you know that?!

Ritsu:
Oh, that's right!
We need to come up with a spiel!

Yui:
What is a spiel?

Ritsu:
Hm?
Intros and stuff.
You know, like when the band banters with the crowd between songs at a concert.

Yui:
Oh right, right!

Ritsu:
Hey, everybody!
How are you doing?!
The Light Music Club would like to welcome each and every one of you to our very first show ever today!

Yui:
Wow, wow!

Ritsu:
Now, let's introduce our members!
Guitar!
You can always find her slacking off on her days off.
"If it's sweet, leave it to me!" she always says, this is the devil-may-care fairy, Yui!

Yui:
Wrooon, wrooon...

Ritsu:
And on keyboard!
She's your girl when it comes to fine snack goods!
She has a graceful, lively, natural airhead of a rich girl, give a big hand to Mugi!

Tsumugi:
[Bang bang!]

Ritsu:
And on bass and vocals!
Scary and gory stories are most definitely NOT her thing!
She is the Don of the Light Music Club, the dangerous queen, it's Mio!
Ow!

Mio:
Who are you calling dangerous, huh?

Ritsu:
You just proved my point...

And last but not least, me!
Fair of face and figure and mind!
She's everybody's idol with her sunny smile.
Give a big hand to me, Ritsu!

Mio:
Quit tooting your own horn!

Everyone:
Hahaha...


Announcer:
Let's hear it for the Choir Club.

Yui:
Ah! Look at all those people out there!

Tsumugi:
Goodness, you're right.

Yui:
Our very first number....

Ritsu:
Come on!
Time to get out there and show them what we practiced!

Yui:
Yes!

Tsumugi:
Mm!

Mio:
Um, Ritsu...
Do I really have to go out on stage looking like this?

Ritsu:
I think it suits you really well, Mio.

Yui:
She's right! It looks so cute on you!

Mio:
Oh, man!

Announcer:
Next up is a performance by the Light Music Club!
So, get ready for some great music!

Ritsu:
Oh, right now, let's do it!

Everyone:
Yeah!

Nodoka:
You can do it, Yui!


Girl:
What's with the costumes?

Girl:
They're so cute!

Girl:
What club are they again?

Sawako:
I nailed it!

Mio:
I can't do this!

Yui:
Mio-chan!
We all know that you've practiced and practiced and practiced your heart out for this, Mio-chan.

Ritsu:
Yeah, Mio!

Tsumugi:
We know, Mio!

Yui:
We know you can do this!
So, let's knock 'em dead!

Ritsu:
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three!

(Song: Fuwa Fuwa Time)

Mio:
Thank you! Everyone!

Ritsu:
I think maybe this will finally let Mio get over her shyness.

Mio:
Ah!

Ritsu:
Mio!

Mio:
Ow...

Ahhhhhh!


Ritsu:
That was some great work yesterday, everyone!

Ritsu, Sawako, Yui:
Yeah, really good work!

Ritsu:
For your first time in front of a crowd, I think you did pretty good, Yui!

Yui:
Oh...

Ritsu:
As for Mio...
She's apparently got her very own fan club now!

Tsumugi:
Oh, amazing!

Ritsu:
But I'm afraid she's kinda out of commission at the moment.

Yui:
Huh?

Mio:
Pan... Pa-Panties... Panties...
No one will ever wanna marry me now...


-- Preview --

Ritsu:
I made a flyer for our Christmas party!

Tsumugi:
I wanted this instead, so I asked them to exchange it.

Ui:
Now then, what should I make?

Yui:
All done!
Yeah, I wonder if Santa's gonna come this year.
I haven't been very good so I'm afraid maybe he won't come.
May I get presents.
