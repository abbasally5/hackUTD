  Ui:
Big sis! If you don't get up, you'd be late! ..huh? Oh, she slept with Guita again?

Yui:
Mm.. Ui? Hm.. My arms are asleep for some reason.

Ui:
Did you fall asleep while practicing again?

Yui:
Yeah.. Hah.. Guita! Gooood morning!!

Ui:
Ah! Sis! Don't fall asleep again!

 OP ================
Yui:
It's raining today, huh?

Ui:
The rainy season started, which means it's gonna be raining a lot.

Yui:
Ah! I've gotta make sure that Guita doesn't get wet.
Ui, could you hold my bag just a minute?

Ui:
Um, sure!

Yui:
Thanks a lot. There you go. Ready!

Ui:
Oh, you are like a couple!

Yui:
Yesh, you're right. Thanks for holding my bag.

Ui:
Yeah.

Yui:
And we're off.
I can't see where I'm going.

Ui:
Do you need help?

Yui:
No, I'm okay..

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:2:&lt;h6&gt; 

Yui:
Oh, man, I hate the rainy season.

Ui:
Guita is dry, but you're getting soaking wet!

Yui:
Ahhh!!
Oh, good bo...!!

Woman:
Ah!! So sorry!!

Ui:
Ah, big sis! Ah! Yui-chan..

Woman:
Oh, my...

Yui:
It's alright, Ui. What's important, is Guita is dry. All right, let's get moving, Ui.

Ui:
Oh, sis...
Oh, big sis...!



Mio:
It's been nothing but rain lately.

Ritsu:
Rainy season gets old real fast...

Mio:
Yeah, even with that great big umbrella, we always end up getting wet. ..Huh? Mugi, what are you doing?

Tsumugi:
[Groans] ..Nothing.

Yui:
Good morning, everybody.

Mio:
Hey, Yui.

Mio&Ritsu:
Good mo.. huh? You're soaked!

Yui:
Hehe.. Ui wiped up what she could with her hanky, but..

Tsumugi:
Oh, don't worry, I brought a towel with me.

Mio:
Wow, you're so prepared!

Yui:
Thanks a lot, Mugi-chan.
Down we go. And you stay here and be a good boy.

Himeko:
You really love him, like a boy friend.

Yui:
Uh? Nah, we wouldn't go that far.

Himeko:
All the best to you two.

Tsumugi:
So, Ms. Hirasawa, do you itchy anywhere?

Yui:
No, buy me nan! Oops sorry that's not how it goes. [chuckes]

Ritsu:
Okay now, what's with the weird routine?

Tsumugi:
We're playing a hair dresser.

Ritsu:
You love that, too? So what happened to you Yui, did you trip? You know what I mean, your usual shtick?

Yui:
No, I got drenched because I was trying to keep Guita safe and dry from all this rain. I don't know what happened.

Mio:
Why didn't you wrap in a plastic bag?

Yui:
Hey, you're right! You're so smart, Mio-chan!

Mio:
Normal people would have thought of that right off!

Tsumugi:
Well, your hair is dry, but erm..

Yui:
Oh! My hair is all ruffled up after I spent all morning setting it!

Ritsu:
Yeah, all this humidity is a real pain, huh? My hair looks like this every morning.

Tsumugi:
During the rainy season I spend all morning fighting with my hair.

Yui:
Um? You do that, too?

Mio:
Oh, that's why you were fussing over your hair.

Yui;
Guess we both have natural frizzy hair, huh?

Tsumugi:
Uh-huh.

Mio:
If they both have frizzy hair, why are they so different...

Yui:
[Sneezes]

Tsumugi:
Oh no. If you don't get your clothes dry, you're going to catch a cold.

Ritsu:
Let's hang them in the club room.



Yui:
Sorry for dragging you up here with me.
Ugh, my indoor shoes are all soggy, too. And now.. My tights are soaked, too.

Tsumugi:
I brought some hot water!

Yui:
Huh? You're gonna make tea?
I'm supposed to drink from the bucket?

Tsumugi:
No, silly. Warm up your feet with it.

Yui:
Oh, I get it. Thanks Mugi-chan!
Please pardon me then. Hah.. Uh... That's so warm...
[sighs] I feel like I'm in heaven. I don't wanna go to class now.

Mio:
Of course you're going to class!

Yui:
Yeh, you're mad.

Tsumugi:
Once you're warmed up, get out of those clothes. I'mma hang them up to dry.

Yui:
'Kay!

Tsumugi:
Welcome home, dear!

Yui:
Here, I just walked in the door.

Tsumugi:
Thank you.

Yui:
[Sneezes]

Ritsu:
Quit messing around, get changed!




Tsumugi:
Yui-chan! We hung up your clothes to dry.

Mio:
What are you doing?

Yui:
Huh?
I'm embarrassed that had Guiita see me in such a scandalous state!

Ritsu:
Yeah, whatever.

Yui:
Oh, what a tough club.

Ritsu:
What are you gonna do about change of clothes?

Mio:
There's no PE today, so we don't have our sweats.

Tsumugi:
Yeah, you're right.

Ritsu:
Hum.. AH! Those weird Sawa-chan's handmade outfits! The club's awful legacy.

Mio:
Oh, right, those. Um?

Yui:
Hhm! Yeahhh!

Mio:
Hey! Why would you pick that of all things!

Ritsu:
Where you've been hiding that thing anyway? We returned those to Sawa-chan.

Yui:
I like this one, so I kept it.

Nodoka:
Ah, Yui, there you are. You need to come back. Homeroom is about to start. You guys too.

Ritsu:
Wait. How did you know it was Yui in there?

Nodoka:
Well? It was giving off... eh, Yui vibe.

Yui:
You're so awesome, Nodoka-chan!

Nodoka:
Is that your spare outfit you have?　

Yui:
There are others, but..



Sawako:
Good morning, take your seats. Let's take attendance now.
Ms. Hirasawa. What in the world are you wearing?

Yui:
My uniforms are all wet, so had to change into this!

Sawako:
But, but.. a strange outfit like that isn't appropriate to wear for school!

Ritsu:
Come on, what are you talking about? You're the one who made that thing, Sawa-cha..![gasps]

Sawako:
Don't you have anything else?

Yui:
Well, am I..

Nodoka:
I'm sorry I'm late, Ma'am.

Nodoka:
I borrowed this sweat from a girl in another class.

Yui:
[moans]

Nodoka:
What's the matter?

Yui:
I was hoping that this would be a chance to wear something a little different.

Sawako:
Just go get changed!!

Yui:
Yes Ma'am!



Ui:
Hey, Azusa-chan! Did you find what you're looking for?

Jun:
What the heck is that?

Azusa:
I don't know.

Jun:
Who's are they?

Azusa:
I don't know...

Ui:
Hum? Ah, those are sister's tights.

Azusa:
Seriously, now! Who would hang all those clothes in here!

Ui:
I can't tell them!



Mio:
Uh..

Yui:
Damn. I can't crease these pleats!
Aw!

Mio:
Ugh!

Tsumugi:
Yui-chan, I'll do it! Let me!

Yui:
You will? Thanks...

Mio:
You're really good at that, Mugi.

Yui:
Yeah. Thank you so much!

Ritsu:
Yui.

Yui:
Yeah?

Ritsu:
One of your buttons was about to fall off.

Yui:
Really? And you put it back on for me?

Ritsu:
Um-hum. Here.

Yui:
Whoa... Thank you!

Mio:
For someone who hates fiddling instruments you sure can fix button quickly, Ritsu. Impressive.

Ritsu:
Ho, lay off.

Yui:
It's way too nice for me to wear..

Ritsu:
Gosh.

Ritsu:
Yui.

Yui:
Yea?

Ritsu:
You're going to wear that?

Yui:
No one would be able tell when I'm sitting down.

Ritsu:
I meant as a girl, you're gonna wear that?

Yui:
You makes like this all the time, Ritsu.

Ritsu:
I do! Don't I!?

Sawako:
What are you doing?

Yui:
Ah! Sawa-chan!

Sawako:
Take off those sweat pants, now.

Yui:
Hahhh?

Sawako:
And you need to tuck in your blouse, Ms. Tainaka.

Ritsu:
What!?

Yui:
You never cared about this stuff!

Ritsu:
What makes today any different from before?

Sawako:
Ugh. All right. Have I made myself clear ladies?

Ritsu:
Fine. Whatever.

Sawako:
Oh, good afternoon.

Senior teacher:
Good afternoon to you, too. You certainly have your hands full.

Sawako:
Oh, don't worry about me.

Senior teacher:
I'm not worried about you at all.

Sawako:
Ha ha...
Now, you, Ms. Hirasawa.

Yui:
I like it better this way!

Sawako:
No, and that's final!

Yui:
Even if my skirt flips and uncovered, and they..

Sawako
I said, to take them off!

Yui:
Aahh! Sawa-chan, please stop! Oh please stop..

Sawako:
Quit! They'll think I'm molesting you!

Yui:
Please don't, ohh!



Classmate 1:
Ah, costume's gone.

Classmate 2:
Too bad. Class won't be as fun.

Classmate1:
You're right.

Yui:
See? Everybody was enjoying it.

Nodoka:
You don't have to live up to the expectations of others.

Ritsu&Mio&Yui:
[chuckle]

Mio:
I can't believe. It's still raining.

Ritsu:
We're gonna get soaked again.

Mio:
Yeah, no kidding.

Nodoka:
It's supposed to rain tomorrow, too.

Yui:
I have to keep Guiita safe on the way home!


------------- SIDE B ---------------

Azusa:
Oh, now I get it. That's what happened this morning.

Mio:
You didn't have any problems, Azusa?

Azusa:
No. I use the raincoat that's designed for carrying guitar cases in what weather.

Yui:
Um? Wow, they really make those?

Azusa:
Yeah. It really comes in handy.
I bought it online. But it was on sale. And it even came with the desiccant pack to help keep your guitar dry.
And I also bought this coating on for my guitar. See? It's guitar hanger you stick on a wall. It's shaped like an animal pow. Oh, and this is a strengthener to help you open your fingers wider.

Mio:
Whoa.

Azusa:
And I've got something else, too. I've got a CD that's supposed to help you develop your sense of rhythm if you listen to it while you're asleep!

Mio:
Azusa.

Azusa:
Yes, Mio?

Mio:
I wonder, has any of that stuff really helped?

Azusa:
Eh? Uh.. Hum... Ah, now I get why there were uniforms hung up to dry in the clubroom today. Jun actually said:

Jun:
I think, this might be some kind of spell.

Azusa&Ui:
[gasp]

Jun:
A curse cast by someone out of hatred for someone else.

Azusa:
No way.

Jun:
Why else would someone hung up clothes to dry in the music prep-room? Who's a mystery witch?

Azusa:
She had us so spooked with that.

Yui:
Ui, couldn't have yourself to say anything?

Azusa:
I'm really impressed, though. You rescued hard to protect Guiita!

Yui:
Heh.. More plaise me, more.

Azusa:
You should be careful, though. They say if you put your guitar away weather even dump, mold can start growing on the finger board.

Ritsu:
It does, does it? Your case will be all covered with mold!

Mio:
[screams]

Yui:
You know, I really don't think that Guiita would be a moldy and grosser or anything..

Azusa:
There's no mold, but I do see a little bit of rust on some of the strings.

Yui:
Well do you think I should put new strings on him?

Azusa:
When was the last time you restrung him?

Yui:
Two months ago.

Azusa:
Maybe you should, then. Do you have a new set of strings?

Yui:
Um-huh.
Don't bite, Guiita..! Whoaaaaaaa!! How dare you raise your hand to me!

Azusa:
You're supposed to loosen your pegs before you cut the strings.

Yui:
Oh! I forgot! Don't worry, our brand new strings are on you in no time, Guiita.

Azusa:
I think it's nice that you're taking good care of it, but you don't really need to speak to it like it's a real person, do you?

Yui:
Hm?

Azusa:
Uh?

Yui:
Are you jealous, Azu-nyan?

Azusa:
Dah!

Ritsu:
I sense a love triangle here.

Azusa:
Don't encourage her like that!

Mio:
Yes, a love triangle! Some lyrics like that will make a great song!

Azusa:
You too, Mio senpai!!

Yui:
Ah, you should have come out, and just said so in the first place.

Azusa:
Nooooooooooo!

Yui:
Ugh, I finally got all those strings changed.

Azusa:
Why you're acting so exhausted over that?

Mio:
Come on, why don't we practice? The rain's finally stopped, so it won't be so..

Yui:
Ha! It's stopped!? Hurry! Let's go home while it's dry out!

Azusa:
I thought we were gonna practice!!

Yui:
Guiita might get wet if we stay!

Azusa:
It's always Guitta this and Guiita that with you!

Yui:
Don't worry Azu-nyan, I will always have a place in my heart for you.

Azusa:
[gasps]



Ui:
[sighs] Everything's so crummy. Uh? Sis saved the half of that the day before yesterday. [gasps] It's moldy!　

Big sis! I've got tea for us. Ah! You've got mold on you! You didn't eat that moldy bun, did you!?

Yui:
No. I didn't eat the bun?

Ui:
But are those green flakes!?

Yui:
Oh, why you saw seaweed on my face?

Ui:
Oh, right. Your takoyaki lunch for today.
When is this rainy season gonna be done?

Yui:
Rainy days can be fun, too.

Ui:
Huh?

Yui:
You can just hang out inside the house and spend a whole day together.

Ui:
[smiles] I'm jealous.

Yui:
Huh?

Ui:
You seem so happy ever since you started playing guitar.

Yui:
But you know?

Ui:
Huh?

Yui:
Sometimes I worry about not being able to play something well. Or making Guiita look bad if I played a wrong code, or miss a beat, or really mess something up badly.
But whatever happens, all I wanna do is go and having fun and making music with him forever and ever! Here we go!

Yui&Ui:
[sings]




Ui:
Another rainy day.

Yui:
I got a cover today! Ta-dah!

Ui:
Aha! Great idea!

Yui:
Thank you.

[Cries] I can't get this plastic off!

Mio:
You went overboard.

Yui:
About done time!

Azusa:
Japanese weather can be awfully rough on musical instruments, can't it?

Mio:
That's for sure.

Azusa:
If the neck absorbs any moisture it'll warp and can make it really hard to tune properly.

Yui:
Wow, it will?

Azusa:
If you octave tune it, you can tell right away if there is a problem. First you do this.

Yui:
Oh! Let me check mine!

Azusa:
Uh?

Yui:
Oh! Hey you're right! It's off by a half of a half of a half tone!

Azusa:
You mean you can tell that without using a tuner!?

Yui:
Um-hm.

Azusa:
Wow, you're right. According to the tuner, it's off by half a semi tone just like you said!

Yui:
In that case, fix it for me!

Mio:
Just fix it yourself!

Yui:
But it'll take forever if I try to do it myself.

Azusa:
Yui, didn't I teach you how to do it?

Yui:
Heheheh..

Azusa:
Okay, just this once.

Yui:
Thank you Azu-nyan!

Ritsu:
This rain just won't let up!

Azusa:
It's getting worse.

Mio:
Yeah, and the wind is picking up, too.

Tsumugi:
The weather forecast said, it's gonna rain again tomorrow.

Mio:
Maybe, I'll just lay my bass in the clubroom overnight.

Yui:
That's so cruel, Mio-chan!!

Mio:
[screams] Wha, what is...!!

Yui:
Hm!

Mio:
Huh?

Yui:
I feel so sorry for you, Elizabass. Mio-chan is just abandoning you!

Mio:
I'm only leaving it here because I don't want it to get wet!! And please don't name my bass!!

Ritsu:
Why not you leave Guiita here, too?

Azusa:
That would be the smart thing. That plastic wrap you brought, isn't really usable.


Yui:
Good point.
Now, don't talk to strangers and get into their car or anything, okay?

Mio:
What are you saying?

Yui:
Elizabass, you're going to be spending the night with Guiita tonight, okay?

Mio:
I said, not to name my stuff!!!

Azusa:
She named that, because it is a bass. Mine's a mustang, so I guess that will make it... Mu-tan.

Tsumugi:
I think that's the perfect name!

Azusa:
Nahh!! Please don't read my mind like that, it freaks me out!!

Tsumugi:
You said that out loud, Azusa-chan?

Azusa:
[gasps]




Ritsu:
Oh well, what a downpour.

Azusa:
Aw, it's soaking through to my socks.

Mio:
Leaving our instruments was a right call.

Yui:
Well, well. See you guys tomorrow.

Azusa:
I'm off, too.

Tsumugi:
See you tomorrow.

Mio:
Sure.

Ritsu:
Be careful going home!

Yui:
Guiita, I only think about you.

Tsumugi:
Wait, Yui-chan!

Azusa:
Yui-senpai!

Ritsu:
She left Guiita behind and she's still getting soaked.

Mio:
Yeah, it seems like Yui is constantly fussing over Guiita, doesn't it?

Ritsu:
Well it's more like obsessing rather than fussing, really.

Mio:
She's making such a huge spectacle over leaving him at school.

Ritsu:
[laughs] Really? Like you're one to talk about Yui?
I seem to recall you coming to me in tears the first time your bass got a little scratch on it?

Mio:
Ritsu!!

Ritsu:
Where is it?

Mio:
[sobbing] Here.

Ritsu:
[laughs]

Mio:
Ah, ah, ah!!




Ui:
[yawns] I'm finally finished with my homework!
Whoa! What the heck, is that? I hope it's not burglars...
Big sister!

Big sister! There's a weird noise in the house said...huh? What are you doing?

Yui:
Ui...

Ui:
What's wrong?

Yui:
Ui...

Ui:
Big sis, are you okay?

Yui:
I'm so worried about Guiita being all alone at school that I can't sleep! [sobs]

Ui:
Oh that'll be all right, big sis.

Come to think of it, she's practiced on him every day since she bought him. They're even practically inseparable.

Yui:
Hah! I can't take it anymore! I'm going back for him!!

Ui:
Sis, don't do it! We're on the second floor and you're all in pajamas and it's raining!




Ritsu:
Yui only spent one night away from Guiita, but she's got a huge smile on her face.

Sawako:
I guess your guitar means awful a lot to you, huh?

Yui:
Yes!

Sawako:
That's understandable. But would you mind putting it away during the homeroom?

Yui:
Hah, don't mind him.

Sawako:
But I DO mind.

Yui:
Come on, just for a little while?

Sawako:
I said, NO!

Mio:
[panting]
It's here. Yui was so worried about Guiita that it made ME nervous, too.
Hm?

Ritsu:
[Your case will be all covered with mold!]

Mio:
Ugh...
What a relief! Oh, Elizabass... [chuckles] ..Huh?

Ritsu&Yui&Tsumugi:
[Giggle]

Mio:
[screams]




---------- PREVIEW -----------

Mio:
Get it off me, get it off me!!!

Yui:
Now Mio-chan back scratcher!

Mio:
Stop making up crazy stuff!!

Ritsu:
And that, was when they first met.

Mio:
Whaa!

Ritsu:
But what fate, lies in store for them? So do I. First question. What's the absolutely scariest story you've ever heard in your whole life!?

Mio:
Huh!? What kind of question is that!?

Yui:
Next question. What the second scariest story you've ever heard?

Mio:
[screaming]

Ritsu:
What's the third scariest story you've ever heard!?

Nodoka:
Ah,

Mio:
Ugh, I've tried so hard to forget about all that.
