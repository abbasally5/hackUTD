  Ritsu:
Drumming’s gonna kill me!

Azusa:
It's another scorcher today.

Mio
Huh? Where did Yui run off to?

Yui:
[Groans] It's so hot.. 


————OP----------

Yui:
I wish summer was just gone away already. Ugh..

Ritsu:
Oh, please. You’ll be saying the exact opposite once winter is here.

Yui:
Nooo.

Azusa:
Here's some water, sempai.

Yui:
Whoa! Thank you Azunyan, thank you, Azunya.. ugh.. My face is hot.

Mio:
Then don’t do that. 

———SIDE A------

Mio:
I have to say, it’s like an oven in here. Long hair makes my neck sweat like crazy.

Ritsu:
Oh! Why don’t you just put your hair up then?
Okay, all done. 

Tsumugi:
Aha! You look just like Azusa-chan!

Ritsu:
Yeah! It looks terrible.. [groans]

Mio:
You’re the one who did it!

Ritsu:
Sorry..!

Ritsu:
What's going on!?

Mio:
Oh Tonchan.

Ritsu:
He get a sunburn?

Mio:
NO off course he didn’t.

Tsumugi:
Tonchan’s molted.

All:
Molted?

Yui:
Molted? I didn’t know turtles did that!

Tsumugi:
Of course they do, they’re reptiles. The turtles that we have in home are all molted, too.

Azusa:
Ah. Thank goodness. I was so worried that Tonchan might be getting sick.

Yui:
I got it! We should all shed too just like turtles do.

Ritsu:
You do know that humans can’t shed their skin, right?

Yui:
Ho ho, but we can, Ritsu!
Yosakoi!

Ritsu:
Is that what you meant?



Yui:
Whoa. this is kinda comfy. It might be easier to play this way.

Ritsu:
Not happening.

Yui:
Hmm. Why don’t you put yours on too, Mio-chan?

Mio:
No-no-no-no! No one but you would ever wear something like that to.. Eh!?

Yui:
Mugi-chan!

Mio:
Seriously?

Yui:
Hmm. I wonder if it’s cold on top of the desks?

Ritsu:
You’re doing what I think?

Yui:
Here goes.

Ritsu:
Oh, how does it feel?

Yui:
It wasn't as cold as I hoped it would be.

Tsumugi:
Uh-huh.

Azusa:
[Sighs] It’s not cold, either. 



Mio:
For some reason, today seems especially hot. 

Azusa:
Still, with all the sweating we're doing we're sure to lose some weight.

Tsumugi:
Summer suits time!

Mio:
This will do the trick, right!?

Yui:
No way!

Ritsu:
Those again?

Mio:
I’m sweating all right!

Tsumugi:
But I can’t play properly.

Ritsu:
Hey, let’s play a word association game. 

All:
Huh?

Ritsu:
What says summer in Japan with anything else?

Yui:
Watermelons! 

Tsumugi:
Big wind chimes?

Ritsu:
[Clicks tongue]

Yui:
Ah, Ice cream!

Azusa:
I know it’s fireworks! 

Ritsu:
No no no no.

Yui:
Oh, chilled Chinese noodles?

Ritsu:
You’re not even close. Wow, it's all about food with you, isn't it?

Yui:
Huh? What can it be then? 

Ritsu:
The answer is.. Scary ghost story!
S-Sorry.



Ritsu:
This is the story that is told in this school. Apparently, a student came here alone one night to retrieve something she had forgotten. The school should have been deserted. And yet, the note of the piano being played could be heard emanating from the music room.

Mio:
[screams] Mugi!

Ritsu:
She thought this was unusual, so she peeked into the music room and what did she see… ?
Sawa-chan, tutoring a student who was applying to a music’s con!!

Ritsu:
Agh. Isn't there anything else we can do to cool off?

Azusa:
You know it’s bad for your heart to get yourself so agitated.

Ritsu:
Men, It seems like the hotter we fan ourselves. 

Yui:
The hotter it feels whenever we stop.

Tsumugi:
Thinking about how hot it is only makes you feel even hotter than you really are.

Azusa:
Oh you mean a mind over matter?

Yui:
Okay Ritchan, let’s think about lots of cool things!

Ritsu:
Things that are cool, huh.

Yui:
So cold!
It sure is nice and cool.

Ritsu:
It sure is, Yui.

Yui:
It's all about mind over matter.

Ritsu:
You know, you’re maybe right.

Yui:
It’s hot..

Ritsu:
Don’t give in, Yui. Think about how cool it is!

Yui:
It’s so cool, It’s so cool, It’s so cool, It’s so cool..

Ritsu:
It’s so cool! ...

Azusa:
Yui sempai, are you feeling okay!?

Yui:
This is so hard..

Ritsu:
I can’t tell my mind it’s cool when the matter is so hot..

Mio:
Hey. Back at the beginning of the school year when we were all cleaning in here, I could swear that I put a fan in the storage room.

Ritsu:
That’s it!

Yui:
Mio-chan, you’re genius!

Mio:
Found it!

Ritsu:
It’s ancient.

Mio:
Well, I guess I know how she feels.
This way the breeze should hit everyone, okay?

All:
Whoa.

Mio:
Here goes.

Ritsu:
Well, excuse me! I’m not getting any winds at all back here!

Mio:
You're way in the back, what did you expect?

Ritsu:
[Groans]

Mio:
Hey, Ritsu?

Ritsu:
Alright then, ultra maximum power, go! 
[Screams]

Yui:
I think you broke.

Ritsu:
Nothing we can do.

Tsumugi:
Hey guys, I brought ice cubes today, see?

Yui:
Whoa.

Ritsu:
It’s cold.

Mio:
Let me see!
Mugi, when did you get these..
It’s freezing! What do you think you’re doing!?

Ritsu:
Now now. How could I pass that up? 

Tsumugi:
But the truth is, I'd planned to use this to make us some shaved ice.

Yui&Azusa:
I love!

Tsumugi:
But I forgot to bring shaved ice machine from home.

Yui&Azusa:
MMmm.

Yui:
Whoa, it’s all nice and chilly.

Ritsu:
Really!? Me too, me too! You weren’t kidding that’s freezing..



Yui:
You know, it's kind of lukewarm now.

Ritsu:
Ice sure melts quickly when it’s hot.

Yui:
Ritchan, go buy us some more ice.

Ritsu:
Why don’t YOU go buy some.

Yui:
Don’t wanna it’s too hot.

Ritsu:
It’s hot for me, too.

Yui:
Just go get it, Ritchan.

Ritsu:
Oh, no! My chronic back pain returned.

Yui:
That’s not fair. I was here with my feet in the bucket first.

Ritsu:
And my feet have been in the bucket for a lot less time than yours have been.

Yui:
Ritchan, you’re the one who should go! 

Ritsu:
No, you should go!

Mio:
Would you too give it a rest? For Pete’s sake.

Ritsu:
Seems like a big waste to throw away all this ice. 

Yui:
Ha! Why don’t we gather it up and put it in Tonchan’s tank! 

Azusa:
No you can’t! The tank has its own thermo stuff, so he’s fine just the way he is! 

Yui:
Oh Azunyan, I was kidding.

Azusa:
Well you know your jokes never really sound much like jokes, Yui-sempai.
Oh, it says here turtles grow in a pace of the size of its tank! So we want Tonchan to get bigger, we have to get him a bigger tank! 

Mio:
So then, the reason Tonchan were shedding,

Yui:
It’s because he wants to grow big and strong! 

Tsumugi:
In that case, we have a larger tank in my house that hasn’t been used!

Azusa:
Really you do!? But how in the world would we get it over here?

Mio:
Didn’t Sawachan say that once she has a car?

Azusa:
You’re right she did! Let’s go and ask her if she'll help us.

Yui:
Sawachan hasn’t hang at our club, hasn’t she?

Ritsu:
Good thing, if she was here, it would just make the room hotter. Or I know, maybe she’s passed out from the heat around here somewhere! 

Mio:
Like the two of you have any right to laugh at that.



Sawako:
What’s the matter, girls? What brings you two here to the staff room? What? Oh where are you two taking me??
It’s so hooot...

Azusa:
Ms. Yamanaka, look at Ton-chan!

Sawako:
What, if he is in the water, it's nice and comfy.. Ah, looks like he’s molting.

Mio:
That why we wanna switch him into a larger tank that Mugi has at her house.

Azusa:
Would you mind helping us out bringing it over here in your car?

Sawako:
Ugh, it’s way too much work!

Tsumugi:
Look Sawa-chan, I have an ice cream float for you.

Sawako:
I'll fetch my car once!

Ritsu:
She’s so easy to manipulate.


————SIDE B-----------


Sawako:
Thanks for waiting.

Ritsu:
Bye, it’s my job as club president to go.

Yui:
Whaat!? Not fair! You can’t go by yourself! I wanna go too! I wanna ride in Sawachan’s car!
Hey! No touching!

Azusa:
Huh? I can’t go?

Mio:
They’re going to Mugi’s house, so Mugi has to go. No matter what!

RItsu:
Hmmm.

Yui:
You’re lucky Mugi-chan. So, Mugi-chan gets shotgun, and me and Azunyan, Ritchan and Mio-chan will all ride in the back seat, how about that?

Sawako:
My car only seats four, so that only leaves three seats free!

Yui:
In that case, do you wanna take Sawachan’s spot, Ritchan?

Ritsu:
Okay.

Sawako:
Well, who’s gonna drive tha car!?

Yui:
I hate say it, but you really should’ve bought a bigger car, Sawa-chan.

Sawako:
I didn't buy the car for you, so if you don't mind, you can spare me the commentary?

Tsumugi:
Ah! You know the fish tanks are rather large and bulky, so there is a really good chance to take up the entire inside of the car.

Mio:
Well then, assuming that the tank will take up the rear of the car, Mugi’s the only one who can go.

Yui&Ritsu:
Say what!?

Tsumugi:
We’ll be back soon, everyone!

Yui:
Have a safe trip...

Ritsu:
Ah, it’s hot.

Tsumugi:
Whoa. I’m riding in my teacher’s car!
Oh, what’s that on your mirror?

Sawako:
It’s a good luck charm.

Tsumugi:
You can see everything from the front seat. Whoa, the seat moves! Ahh!

Sawako:
I knew that was coming.





Tsumugi:
We’re back!

Ritsu:
Look at that!

Yui:
It’s huge!

Mio:
That’s amazing! 

Sawako:
Incredible.

Yui:
What do you mean, incredible?

Sawako:
It was just incredible. I'll be sure to make home visit more often, alright? 

Tsumugi:
Thank you for looking out for me.

Ritsu:
Oh, thanks for doing this for us.

All:
Thank you very much. 

Sawako:
You’re welcome, girls.

Yui:
Thanks for waiting Ton-chan.

Azusa:
Look, here is a big new tank for you.

Yui:
isn’t that terrific, Ton-chan?
Ah, the sunlight is hitting the one corner of the tank!

Azusa:
Yeah, you’re right. We’d better cover it up with something.

Ritsu:
Don’t we have some packing tape?

Yui:
I think they’re somewhere in the store room.
You think that’ll work? 

Ritsu:
It should be just fine.

Sawako:
Okay then, I think it’s time I headed back to the staff room.

Ritsu:
Wait! Don’t go yet!

Sawako:
You need something else?

Ritsu:
Oh, please stay, you're the only one we can turn to!

Sawako:
Right. I'm going now.

Ritsu:
Sawa-chan!

Sawako:
I said, no!

Ritsu:
Mugi!

Tsumugi:
Sawa-chan! Would you like a nice chocolate frappe?

Sawako:
Yes please!



Sawako:
Hm.
An air conditioner, huh?

Ritsu:
Can you do anything for us?

Sawko:
I don’t know.

Mio:
Oh, really?

Ritsu:
Right! In that case, we’ll buy the air conditioner ourselves.

Mio:
Where are we supposed to get that much money?

Ritsu;
We’ll get ourselves some jobs!

All:
Yeah!!

Azusa:
Don’t you guys need to study for your college entrance exams?

Sawako:
Oh wait a minute, why don’t you go and ask the student council?

Ritsu:
Good idea!

Mio:
You think they are really okay to request? Air conditioners aren’t cheap.

Ritsu:
Yeah, maybe this’ll cost a little bribe.

Yui:
You know Nodokachan was saying earlier that she wished she a had computer.

Ritsu:
Mugi, xxx up computer right away!

Tsumugi:
Right, you got it!

Mio:
That would cost as much as an air conditioner..



Ritsu:
We've got an emergency, Yui’s passed out from the heat!

Yui:
Ritchan, just once before I die, I wanted to stop by finger sand.

Ritsu:
Yui! YUI!!

Ritsu:
Here’s your wish for air conditioner of gold, or an air conditioner made of silver?

Yui:
Mighty god, my only wish is but for an ordinary air conditioner.

Ritsu:
How honest, this creature is. So I shall grant a brand new air conditioner !

Yui:
Oh, praise god!

Nodoka:
What' with all the cheap theatrics?

Mio:
Sorry for all the ruckus.

Nodoka:
[chuckles] So, what is it that you want?

Yui:
The thing is, we came here to ask a favor for student council.

Ritsu:
Wait,Yui. Feel the air. It’s cool here.
This room has an air conditioner! Abuse of authority!

Yui:
Nodoka-chan, I believed in you.

Nodoka:
What are you talking about. We talked about this at the culb president council. The school has decided to OK air conditioners in the club rooms. So I said that any clubs that wanted one should put in the request. 

Mio:
President?

Ritsu:
I forgot to attend..Aw! Sorry..

Mio:
I-Is it too late to apply!?

Nodoka:
Ah, well am..

Ritsu:
We’re back.

Tsumugi:
How did it go?

Ritsu:
I’m going put in a formal proposal at tomorrow’s club president council.

Azusa:
Council? I've never heard of that. What will you guys talk about there?

Ritsu:
I don’t know! I’ve never been to one.

Mio:
I wouldn't be boasting.

Tsumugi:
Well does the council vote to turn down requests made by the clubs?

Mio:
I suppose so.

Yui:
[cries] But I really wanted an air conditioner.

Mio:
we’ll just have to plead our case convincingly.

All:
Hmmm.

Mio:
Well for now, why don’t we rehearse our petition for the council?

Ritsu:
What do you mean, rehearse?

Mio:
Well think of reasons they might turn down the request, and prepare counter arguments.

Ritsu:
Yeah, I follow you, good idea!

Mio:
Very well, those with business before the council, raise your hand.

Ritsu:
Hrere! the light music club request the air conditioner!

Mio:
Thsoe in agreement with Ms, Tainaka’s request, say agreed,

All:
Agreed!

Mio:
Ugh, If you all agreed, it defeats the purpose!
Ahem,. Right, those opposed to the request?

Tsumugi:
President! We heard petitions for air conditioner at the previous council, so I believe it’s far to late to request one now.

Ritsu:
Uh, that was because..

Azusa:
Ma’am! Light music club doesn’t seem to practice all that often, so do they really need an air conditioner in their room?

Ritsu:
I’m so sorry I wasted your time! I withdraw my request!

Mio:
Why the heck you’re giving up!?

Ritsu:
Because, this is hard..

Tsumugi:
You have to make some kind of counter argument.

Yui:
It’ll be okay Ritchan you can do it I know it! You’re the club president, you’re a big sister and you’re a good drummer!

Ritsu:
Hey, you’re right, Yui! Bring it on, Azusa!

Azusa:
One more time, then!
I don’t believe the light music club meets an air conditioner because they never practice!

Ritsu:
We do too practice all the time! But it’s a secret practice..

Mio:
Why do you have to say that our practices are secret?

Yui:
Ma’am! I believe that there’s more to being cold than practice!

Ritsu:
Wow, Yui’s saying something amazingly sensible ones!

Yui:
We deepen our bonds of friendship, and we interact with students of other class years!

Ritsu:
That’s right, that’s right!

Yui:
We also eat cake and drink tea and go to the beach!

Azusa:
See? The light music club has no need for air conditioner in their room!

Yui:
If we had an air conditioner, we would practice!

Azusa:
Would you, really?

Yui:
We sweat like crazy when we play our instruments out loud.

Ritsu:
Drums are phisically demanding which makes it very dangerous to play in the summer heat!

Azusa:
Ah, nevertheless...

Ritsu:
Plus, if we had the air conditioner, our performance would be a lot cooler!

Yui:
Yeah! They would!

Azusa:
Umm, you made your case.

Ritsu:
Oh yeah, now I’m ready for the real thing!

Yui:
Go get it, Ritchan!

Ritsu:
Watch what a club president can do if she set her mind to it!

Yui:
Ahahha!



Nodoka:
So is there any other business today?

Ritsu:
Ma’am!

Nodoka:
Ms. Tainaka?

Ritsu:
The light music club requests an air conditioner.

Nodoka:
Are there any objection to the proposal?

Ritsu:
Huh, wait, so you are okay with it?

Student coucil A:
But madam president, the student council’s budget for the year has already broadly allocated.

Nodoka:
Well, we could hold off on replacing the copier, at least until next year, right?

Student coucil A:
Yes we could! That would do it!

Ritsu:
Huh.. That’s it? Seriously?

All:
Whoa!!

Yui:
We’re in heaven!

Tsumugi:
So cool!

Mio:
Now we can finally practice without sweating like mad.. huh?

Ritsu:
I’d say we all call it a day and relax.

Mio:
Hey!

Ritsu:
I’m just kidding!

Mio:
Oh good grief.

Ritsu:
Here we go! One, two, three, .. Huh?

Mio:
What’s the matter, Yui?

Yui:
I eh.. forgot that air conditioning makes me queasy.

Mio:
What are we supposed to do, then!?

Yui:
I feel terrible..

Ritsu:
We can't win.
