  Yui:
Ready!

Ui:
Sis, you be careful out there.

Yui:
Um. I'll see you later Ui!

Ui:
You have a good run!

Yui:
Oh? Hi, good morning, granny!

Granny:
Good morning Yui. You're up early today?

Yui:
I just thought I should work really hard and give 100%

Granny:
Oh well, good for you, dear.

Yui:
Hehehe. See you later!

Granny:
Oh, goodness.


--

Ritsu:
Well, there she is.

Tsumugi:
She's the definition of youth.

Ritsu:
She's cutting it real close.

Nodoka:
Yui! Hurry up!

Ritsu:
What part of hurry doesn't she get!?

---

Yui:
Made it just in time..

Ritsu:
Oversleep again?

Yui:
I got up early so that I could go jogging.

Mio:
You mean that's why you were late?

Yui:
I wrote on l my future plans’ questionnaire that I’d work hard.

Tsumugi:
Hm! Keep up, Yui!

Ritsu:
Please don't encourage her like that, Mugi.

Mio:
That's true, our finals are coming up pretty soon.

Yui:
Really..?

Teacher:
On a side note, Tadamasa Oguri's contribution can not be understated...

Mio:
She's already asleep.

Ritsu:
Gonna work hard, are ya??

Yui:
I'm gonna hit the books hard!




Yui:
Oh! You have such a tidy handwriting Mugi-chan. Could I..?

Tsumugi:
Would you like to make copies?

Yui:
Yes, thank you.

Mio:
Uh? Um..

Yui:
Ha! Oh wow your notebook is so cute Mio-chan!

Mio:
Leave me alone.

Yui:
Hm? Ritchan.

Ritsu:
Hm?

Yui:
I see that you too fall asleep during class. My source is there. 
Hmm. It starts with Ta with Ki in the middle and it ends with N?

Ritsu:
A hint, it's a kind of food!

Mio:
Tanuki-udon.

Tsumugi:
Whoa, what kind of food is that?

RItsu:
It's a whole raccoon in a bowl of noodles!

Tsumugi:
Whoa.

Mio:
You know we aren't gonna get any studying done at all.

Yui:
Hm? Aha!

Thanks a lot, Mugi-chan.

Ritsu:
Yui, Mugi! Open wide!
Try one of these hyper ultra sadistic mints! Here.

Yui:
It's a ---!

Tsumugi:
My tongue is numb!

Mio:
What are you guys doing?



Mio:
Are you sure that you'll be able to study on your own?

Yui:
As soon as I get home I'm going to work!

Wha. Hi granny!

Granny:
Oh, hi, Yui-chan.

Yui:
I'm back from school.

Granny:
Welcome back. Here I have some chicken stew for you. I made plenty this time, so you and your sister can have all you like.

Yui:
Thank you so much. Than you for always..aw!

Granny:
What are you doing now?

Yui:
Heheheh..

Granny:
Are you still playing.. what's it called?

Yui:
Oh, Guita?

Granny:
Yes, that was it, Guita.

Yui:
He's Guita the guitar!

Granny:
You're stuck with it ever since you started high school. It's nice to see you working hard at it, Yui-chan. Good for you.

Yui:
I got complimented.
Granny's looked out for me for a whole life.

Ui:
Sis, dinner's ready.

Yui:
AH! Oh no, I was working hard on a wrong thing!

Ui:
This is great!

Yui:
Yeah! I wanna do something to thank her.

Ui:
You know, I shared the souvenir you brought back from your trip to Kyoto with her.

Yui:
You really worked neighbors.

Ui:
Yeah, I guess. Maybe I'll bake a bunch of cookies and take them over.

Yui:
Whoa, your cookies!

Ui:
After we're done with finals!

Yui:
Ah! Hmmm...

I'm gonna work really hard on this!

Ui:
Sis?

Azusa:
Yui sempai's actually applying herself.

Ui:
Yeah, though she gave up on jogging after just one day.

Jun:
I bought shoes but never actually run in them.

Azusa:
Well that's even worse. ..Huh?

Ui:
See?

Azusa:
Oh.

Ui:
Of course, she did fall asleep at her desk last night.

Azusa:
It is Yui sempai after all.



Yui:
Whoa, sale season is here isn't it?

Tsumugi:
Sale season?

Yui:
Seasonal items are all on close-out, so the stores sell them really cheap!

Tsumugi:
Wow it's very dynamic!

Ritsu:
After finals, I wanna come here and buy some clothes.

Mio:
That sounds pretty good.

Yui:
OHhh! Every one of these tops are 30% off!

Ritsu:
You've got some questionable taste, lady.

Yui:
Ummm.

Ui:
Ah!

Yui:
Huh? What's wrong, Ui?

Ui:
We're out of soy sauce.

Yui:
I'll go buy some!

Ui:
That's okay. I'll go and get it.

Yui:
But you're in the middle of cooking dinner, aren't you!?

Ui:
Hm. Well, can you get it ASAP then?

Yui:
Yeah!

Ui:
Are you sure?

Yui:
No problem!

Ui:
Remember, we need soy sauce!

Yui:
Soy sauce, soy sauce, soy sauce, not sweet sauce, just soy sauce! Not just any sauce, but soy sauce...

Granny:
Yui-chan!

Yui:
Hi, granny! Thank you for the stew, it was delicious!

Granny:
You're welcome dear. Are you off to run an errand right now?

Yui:
Yes, we ran out of sugar!

Granny:
Oh, dear. Here you are.

Yui:
Thank you granny!

Granny:
Your timing was perfect. I want to tell about something. Here, take a look at this.

Yui:
A talent show?

Granny:
They hold it every year but apparently there are very few contestants this time around.

Yui:
That's to bad.

Granny:
Would you be interested?

Yui:
Huh? Who, me?

Granny
I think the shopping center people would love to see a young person competing in their show.

Yui:
Hm.

Granny:
And not only that my dear. I'd love to see you play your Guita too.

Yui:
What's the date? (The day after final exams end...!)

Granny:
Oh my, you have plans?

Yui:
Mm-m!

Granny:
I wonder if Shige-san perform this year. His magic performance is so much fun to watch.

Yui:
Maybe, I will.

Granny:
Do you mean it?

Yui:
Um! I'll play for sure!

Granny:
Wonderful! Oh, thank you, Yui-chan..! I can't wait to see you all dressed up on the stage.

Yui:
Right!

Granny:
I almost forgot. The grand prize is a trip to a hot spring! You should take Ui-chan.

Yui:
It wasn't sugar was it..?

Ui:
No...

Yui:
I wish I had soysause for this.

Ui:
We have ponzu sause.

Yui:
No, I don't like sour stuff.

Ui:
You're the one who mixed them up.

Ui:
Do you want me to tell her you can't play? I need to return this anyway.

Yui:
Um-hm! Granny was looking forward to seeing me play!

Ui:
But the show was the day after your final! Isn't it gonna be tough to rehearse and study?

Yui:
I'll work hard at both!



Ritsu:
A talent show?

Yui:
Yeah!

Tsumugi:
Sounds like a lot of fun!

Mio:
But it’s a day after exams.

Yui:
That’s why I’ll perform by myself!

Mio:
Huh?

Yui:
You guys all have studying that you have to do.

Mio:
So do you.

Tsumugi:
Will you really be alright playing all by yourself?

Yui:
I promise that I’ll work hard at everything!

Ritsu:
More to the point, why don’t you just bow out?

Yui:
'Cause I wanna make a nice old neighbor lady happy.

Tsumugi:
Old lady?

Yui:
She’s looked after me and Ui since we were little. And I wanna repay a favour. 

Ritsu:
Huh.

Yui:
She said she wants to see me all dressed up on the stage. I’m gonna win, and give her this hot spring trip as a thank you present.
You know, now that I think about it, she sort of reminds of you, Ritchan.

Ritsu:
Reminds you how!?

Tsumugi:
That’s great.
You’re like the turtle in "Turtle Urashima”, or the statues in “Kasajizo”! I adore stories like that.

Mio:
Fairy tales..?

Tsumugi:
Hang in there. If there’s anything I can do to help, I will.

Yui:
Yeah? Some sweets to keep me going will be really nice.

Mio:
Hey.

Ritsu:
So, what are you gonna do for the show?

Mio:
You’re not gonna do a talent show act?

Yui:
Look, the spinning plates!

Mio:
Like that, are you?

Yui:
No. Guita and I are going to do a nice solo song!

Ritsu:
A Yui solo?

Tsumugi:
I can’t wait!

Yui:
Hehehe.

Ritsu:
Yui’s launching a solo comedy act?

Mio:
All funny man and no straight man.

Ui:
I'm playing a song, not doing a stand-up!

Teacher:
Set!

Azusa:
She’s playing in a talent show now?

Jun:
She’s confident!

Azusa:
It probably just means that she isn’t thinking.

Ui:
That might so a lady next door suggested it to her. And she agreed to do it.
Sis is really excited.

Azusa:
Hmm.



Azusa:
Ah! Yui sempai.

Yui:
Hum? Oh, hey Azu-nyan!

Azusa:
You’re practicing your guitar out here?

Yui:
It’s against the rule to use the music room before the tests.
And I thought that it would bother Ui if I practiced at home.
Are you out running errands?

Azusa:
Yes.

Yui:
Just make sure you don’t mix up soy sause and sugar.

Azusa:
Huh?

Yui:
It could happen to anyone, you know.

Azusa:
Not really.
So, you’re really going to play at the talent show?

Yui:
Oh, Ui told you?

Azusa:
Yes.

Yui:
Hehe, it’ll be my first solo performance! I’m really nervous..

Azusa:
So you’re playing alone?

Yui:
Yeah, why not?

Azusa:
Well, what about the club?

Yui:
We’re in the middle of finals, so I didn't wanna bother anyone with helping me on this.

Azusa:
Sure you can handle it?

Yui:
Yup!

Azusa:
Well you’re studying for the final exams?

Yui:
I’ll work really hard!

Azusa:
Hmm. I understand. I’ll enter the contest with you.

Yui:
Are you sure!?

Azusa:
I always keep up with my studies and I’m doing well on my classes, so I’m not worried about finals, I think.

Yui:
Whoa…! Thank you Azu-nyan!

Azusa:
Anyway, we need to pick a song and start practicing it.
We’ll get down to work starting tomorrow, okay?

Yui:
Okay!


Mio:
Azusa’s playing with you?

Yui:
She is!

Ritsu:
You know, we were all thinking about joining with you too.

Tsumugi:
You two performing should be great!

Yui:
Hehe.

Azusa:
Yui-sempai!

Yui:
Azu-nyan! Hey there..!?

Azusa:
I worked up a full schedule for you!
First thing up we're studying in the library.

Yui:
Azu-nyan, what about snack time?

Azusa:
There isn’t any.

Azusa:
We’ll grab something whenever a break comes up.

Tsumugi;
Azusa-chan is so dependable.

Ritsu:
I guess we can leave it all to Azusa this time.

Mio:
Uh-huh.



Azusa:
So did you finish the practice questions?

Yui:
Ahem, yes..

Azusa:
Okay then, let me go over your answers.

Yui:
[gasps] Uhh..

Azusa:
What’s wrong, sempai?
Please take this seriously.

Yui:
I’m sorry.

Jun:
Your sister is certainly interesting really.

Ui:
Uh-huh! That’s why everyday is fun with her.

Azusa:
The first question is, what sort of song do we wanna play?

Yui:
A lot of older folks come to the show.

Azusa:
Maybe an enka song?

Yui:
Um-hm!

Yui:
Fuwa fuwa time~!

Azusa:
Why are you singing it like that?

Yui:
How to sing voice modulation.

Azusa:
An enka Fuwa Fuwa Time?

Yui:
You try too, Azu-nyan.

Azusa:
Fuwa fuwa time~

Yui:
You’re modulationg your whole body, not your voice.

Azusa:
Ugh. Fuwa fuwa time~~

Yui:
Whoa, you really don't have a feel for enka, do you?

Azusa:
Ugh, I’m sorry, enka is just not going to work.

Yui:
How about a folk song!?

Azusa:
A candle?

Yui:
You have to sing without blowing off the candle!

Azusa:
What kind of practicing is that!?

Yui:
All right, here goes!
Kokiriko no otake wa..

Azusa:
That’s Kokiriko Bushi, right?

Yui:
Madono Sansa mo.. Sing it! The line is “Dededeko Den”, Azu-nyan.
Hare no sansa mo..

Azusa:
Dededeko den.

Yui:
More energy! Madono sanasa mo..

Azusa:
Dededeko den!

Yui:
More!
Hare no sansa mo!

Azusa:
Dedede ko den!!

Yui:
That might just work!

Azusa:
I don’t even know who I am anymore.

Granny:
Yui-chan.

Yui:
Ah, granny!

Granny:
I made you beef and potato croquettes.

Yui:
Whoa!! Thanks so much!

Granny:
I heard from Ui-chan that you were down here. Hard work practicing I see.

Yui:
I sure am. Ha! This is Azu-nyan, she’s performing with me.

Azusa:
Pleased to meet you.

Granny:
Lovely to meet you, my dear. Don't push yourself too hard miss Azu-nyan.

Azusa:
Okay!

Yui:
Oh this is so good!

Azusa:
You know that neighbor of yours seems like a really nice lady.

Yui:
Yup, and her takikomi-rice and chirashi-zushi are totally delicious too!

Azusa:
You sound like a stray cat that see feeds.
So, we need to do our best on this.

Yui:
See what I mean? Now, what do you think we should call a little xxxx?

Azusa:
Right. We can’t call ourselves After School Tea Time.

Yui:
How about “Sempai Kouhai”?

Azusa:
I don’t think we really need to emphasise that.

Yui:
Well, how about just "Yui and Azu-nyan"?

Azusa:
How does "Yui-Azu" sound to you?

Yui:
Yeah! “Yui-Azu”!

Azusa:
Okay, let’s decide on a song now.

Yui:
Oops you’re right. Well what would be a good one?

Azusa:
I still think "Fuwa Fuwa Time" would go over well. 

Yui:
Fuwa fuwa~~

Azusa:
UGH...



Ritsu:
What the heck is wrong, Sawa-chan?

Sawako:
I'm having big time tea and sweets withdraw. Why haven’t we been having any tea and cakes party lately..??

Ritsu:
Because we have tests coming up.

Sawako:
So what ? What’s more important to you people, that rule or me!?

Ritsu:
The rule, obviously.



Nodoka:
Ma’am? I dropped my eraser, may I please pick it up?

Teacher:
Go ahead.



Azusa:
She’s sleeping now?

Announce:
Thanks, that’s wonderful! Next up is no. 14, ..

Azusa:
Yui-sempai, Yui-sempai! It’s time we’re on!

Yui:
Ah!

Yui:
Hi everybody, I’m Yui Hirasawa, senior at Sakuragaoka High School!

Azusa:
And I’m Azusa Nakano,

Yui:
And together we’ are.. Yui!

Azusa:
Azu!

Yui:
Oh yeah!

Ritsu:
Yui's being her usual self!

Tsumugi:
Azusa-chan seems a little bit stiff.

Mio:
I think I’m more nervous than they are.

Yui:
I thought about singing Enka song first, and I even practiced my vocal undulation!

Azusa:
Don’t you mean modulation!?

Mio:
Azusa as a straight man.

Ritsu:
They really pract for this.

Yui
I’m the older sempai around here, but Azunyan is totlally reprehensible one of our little team.

Azusa:
I hope you meant responsible.

Yui:
Oops, what we’re gonna play?

Azusa:
Would you pull it together!

Yui:
Egh. Okay then, here is the Yui-Azu version of “Fude Pen Ball Pen”!
One, two, three,

Ritsu:
They’re doing it like that?

Announce:
and that Yui-Azu, thank you girls! Next up is xxxx...

Yui:
I got a participation prize!

Granny:
You’re giving it to me?

Yui:
Actually I had wanted to give you the first prize trip as a present.

Granny:
Oh, well it's the thought that counts. Thank you, Yui. I thought that two of you gave a wonderful performance. You’ve grown into a finer lady, really.

Yui:
Hehehe.

Granny:
That remainds me, I made plenty of chirashi-zushi, let’s eat it Yui-chan and your friends.

Yui:
Oh yeah! Will you come Azu-nyan?

Azusa:
Sure!

Yui:
Are there shitake-mashrooms in it?

Granny:
Of course there are!

Yui:
Yeahhh!



Yui:
Ahhh!

Ritsu:
What’s up?

Mio:
You got all high scores!

Ritsu:
How did you get that all?

Yui:
I must have guessed right.

Nodoka:
Yeah, I figured that was something like that.

Mio:
You did study really hard though, Yui.

Yui:
Wow, you think so?

Tsumugi:
You know, I wanted to play in that talent show, too.

Yui:
Oh, we can play as Yui-Mugi next time.

Ritsu:
How does RItsu-Mio sound?

Mio:
Or Yui-Mugi-Mio-Azu.

Ritsu:
Hey! No way! You and me MIo, YOU and ME! How about RIttan-and-Miotansounds?

Mio:
That’s even worse.

Ritsu:
I got it! xxx!



— PREVIEW ---

Tsumugi:
Finnland this year is gonna be really fun.

Sawako:
Just what the heck are you here calling me like this!!

Azusa:
Could she really have a…?

Tsumugi:
But wait. Isn’t she always complaining about how lonely she is because she is single?

MIo:
Look! I’m not interested in tha kind of stuff!
You could say that the Light Music Club is my boyfriend right now.

Yui:
Wow, Sawa-chan sure is popular.

Ritsu:
Yeah, but it kind of makes it harder to ask her.
