  Yui:
Guitar strings sure are scary.
They're thin and tough, so I'm scared I'll cut my fingers.

Ritsu:
You got that right!
If you're not careful, you'll slice your fingers to the bone, and blood will spurt out everywhere!

Mio:
Aiiieee!

Yui:
Mio, why did you scream?

Mio:
I-I can't stand all that gory talk!

Yui:
Don't worry Mio, I'm fine.
See? I'm not really bleeding.
I'm perfectly okay.

Mio:
Ahem!
Your fingertips will toughen up the more you play and practice, so I can almost promise you that you won't be doing any bleeding.
Here, check it out!

Yui:
Wow...
Wow, Mio, you're right!
They're all squishy!
Squishy, squishy, squishy...
Squishy, squishy...

Mio:
Um, are you about done?

Yui:
No, let me squeeze them some more!


-- OP --


Yui:
I know I'm supposed to practice, but I have absolutely no idea where I should even start.

Mio:
Here.

Yui:
Huh?

Mio:
You should probably start yourself off by learning all of the chords.

Yui:
Wow, thank you!
Um, could you please teach me how to read musical notation first?

Mio:
You don't even know that?!


#3: Cram Session!


Ritsu:
See you!

Mio:
Bye bye!

Yui:
See you tomorrow!

Let's see... A "C" goes like this, and this is a "D"...

Nodoka:
Yui!

Yui:
Nodoka!

Nodoka:
What's that? A new kind of greeting?

Yui:
The thing is, I had them teach me a bunch of guitar chords today!

Nodoka:
Wow, sounds like you're really working hard.

Yui:
Speaking of which, you're heading home a lot later than usual today.

Nodoka:
Mm, I spent the afternoon in the library studying for our midterms.

Yui:
Oh...
Ah! We've got midterm exams?!

Nodoka:
Is that a chord too?

Yui:
Oh, wow... It's time for midterms already?
And here I was all set to buckle down and really practice my guitar...

Nodoka:
Oh, come on now, Yui.
It's not like you've studied for a single test since middle school.

Yui:
Oh, yeah, that's right!
Well, I guess it's all good, then!

Nodoka:
Um, I wouldn't exactly say that...


Ritsu:
We're finally free of all those tests!

Tsumugi:
It's terrible, the way they suddenly got harder once we got into high school.

Mio:
That's for sure.
And I... see someone who's having an even harder time than we did.
Did your tests go that badly, Yui?

Yui:
Seems I'm the only one in my class who has to take a make-up...

Everyone:
Wow...

Tsumugi:
E-Everything will be fine!
I'm sure it's just that you didn't really study properly this time.

Ritsu:
Mugi's right!
Just study real hard, and you'll ace that make-up test easy!

Yui:
Actually, I didn't study for it at all.

Ritsu:
I take back my words of encouragement, you flake!

I don't get it, Yui.
Why didn't you study?

Yui:
Oh, I really had planned to, but I... come on, when you study for a test, don't you ever end up fixating on everything but studying?

Ritsu:
Ah, I know what that's like.
Like when I gotta clean up my room and stuff.

Yui:
I practiced on the guitar when I was taking a break from studying, and I couldn't put it down.
In the end, I didn't get any studying done at all.
But... my time wasn't wasted, 'cause I learned a whole bunch of chords!

Ritsu:
How about applying those powers of concentration to your studying, huh?

Yui:
You're a big talker. How did you do, Ritsu?

Ritsu:
Huh? Who, me?
Passed with flying colors, thank you very much!

Yui:
You know, this doesn't really fit with your character...

Ritsu:
When you're a brilliant renaissance girl like me, everything comes quite easily to you!

Yui:
Yeah, but I was always under the impression that you were just like me!

Mio:
Who was it that showed up on my doorstep in tears the night before the exam?

Ritsu:
Hey, she doesn't need to know that!

Yui:
Now that's the Ritsu I know.

Ritsu:
I don't wanna hear that from somebody who flunked the test!

Yui:
How about the two of you?
How did you do on your tests?

Tsumugi:
Here.

Ritsu:
Oh, well, you know, how it goes sometimes.
I just made a bunch of dumb mistakes.
That's all!

Yui:
Mm-hm.

Ritsu:
Have a heart, please say something!

Yui:
On another day...

Thank you for your time.

Oh, look at that! It's sweet bean jelly!
They said I'm banned from all club activities until I pass the make-up exam.

Everyone:
Ah!

Mio:
Wow, Yui, that's pretty harsh...

Ritsu:
Well, then, is it okay for you to even be here?

Yui:
Oh, sure, it's okay.
I'm just here to eat sweets with my good friends.

Ritsu:
Oh, right. Then everything is fine!
How do you say that it's okay?!

Mio:
If you're banned from participating in clubs, that means our club will be back down to three members.

Ritsu:
Ah! No way, are you saying that we'll...

Mio:
We won't meet the minimum requirement.

Ritsu:
We'll be... disbanded?

Tsumugi:
When is your make-up test?

Yui:
One week from today.

Mio:
A week from today, huh?

Yui:
Well, with that much time, it's okay for me to come here every day, right?

Ritsu:
That's not much time at all!

Mio:
Yui, if you don't pass your test next week, the Light Music Club might very well cease to exist.

Yui:
Yeah, you're right.
I wanna keep doing fun stuff with you guys, so I'll work real hard!

Everyone:
Hmm...


Yui:
Okay, time to study.
Let's do this!
How did I let this get so messy?
Hm? Wow, it's that late?
I have to bathe and get to bed!


Ritsu:
Meetings sure aren't as worthwhile without Yui here.

Mio:
That hasn't seemed to affect your appetite.

Ritsu:
I know, Mio, those two things have absolutely nothing to do with each other!

Tsumugi:
I wonder if Yui's devoting herself to her studying?

Ritsu:
Oh, I'm sure she's doing fine.

Yui:
Hm, for x^2 - y^2, it's subtract by y^2 and divide by x. So, x = y^2 / x ...
See, I can do this if I set my mind to it!
This is x^2y - 4y, so I start by factoring out the y, leaving me with (x^2 - 4)...


Mio:
Yui's studying has to be coming along well, right?

Ritsu:
You know, I've been wondering that, too.

Ritsu:
All right, now I'm really getting worried, guys!

Tsumugi:
Hey, I know, why don't we all send her an encouraging text tonight?

Ritsu:
Oh, good idea!

Mio:
I'm gonna send her as soon as I get home!

Yui:
Hm?
Oh, hey, it's from Mio.
Mm-hm. Message received.
It's from Mugi-chan!
Thank you so much, Mugi-chan.
It's from Ritchan!
Huh?

Ritsu:
Ah!


Yui:
No matter how harder I try, I just don't have the focus that I need.
But with this, I'm gonna be just fine!
All right, I'll use this book to boost my concentration for the first five minutes.
It's no use! I just can't read this!
No, no, no, no! The problem is that I always give up before I even start!

Yui:
And that's why I need you to help me, Mio!

Mio:
You mean that you didn't do any studying at all?

Yui:
I just couldn't do it!

Ritsu:
Huh?

Tsumugi:
But if you don't get a passing grade, we'll...

Yui:
That's the last thing I want to have happen!

Mio:
Hmm... We'll have to have a cram session tonight.

Yui:
You mean it?

Ritsu:
Listen, if you have Mio teaching you, you're gonna pass your exams for sure!
She's really great at cramming information into your head!

Mio:
I'm gonna teach her normally, darn it!


-- EYE CATCH --


Yui:
My dad had to go away on a business trip, and my mom decided to go with him, so we don't have to worry about disturbing anyone.

Ritsu:
Hey, didn't you say that you also had a little sister?

Yui:
Mm, yeah, and I'm pretty sure she'll be at home tonight.

Tsumugi:
Well, if she's home, won't we just be a bother to her?

Everyone:
Yui's little sister, huh?

Imaginary Ui:
Big Sister!

Yui:
Little Sister!

Imaginary Ui:
Big Sister!

Ritsu:
I think we'll be pretty safe on that score!

Yui:
Come on in, everyone.

Everyone:
Thanks having us over.

Ui:
Hi, welcome home, Sis.
Oh, are these your friends?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Yui's sister, Ui.
Thank you for looking out for my sister.
Here are some slippers for you.

Everyone:
So polite and mature!

Ritsu:
Wow, hard to believe two sisters could be so different.

Yui:
Different how?

Ritsu:
It's almost like your little sister managed to get all the good traits in the family.

Yui:
What?!

Ui:
Excuse me.
I brought some tea if anyone would like some.
And sorry, I'm afraid these are the only snacks we have for you.

Everyone:
She really is polite and mature!

Ritsu:
So, what grade are you in, Ui?

Ui:
I'm in ninth grade.

Ritsu:
Oh, just one year behind us!

Tsumugi:
Taking your entrance exams?

Ui:
Just about.

Mio:
Do you know which high school you wanna go to?

Ui:
Um, I'd like to go to Sakuragaoka if I can manage it.
But I'm not sure if I'm a good enough student to get in.

Ritsu:
You sister managed to get in, so I'm sure you'll do fine.

Yui:
Join us, join us!

Mio:
You just gotta get your sister to help you study, that's all.

Yui:
Yup!

Ui:
Well... I, uh... I'd rather do it all by myself.

Ritsu:
Boy, she shot you down!

Yui:
Why? I can study just as good as anybody!

Ui:
But you know, my sister can do anything once she sets her mind to it.

Everyone:
Definitely polite and mature.

Mio:
All right, we don't have a lot of time, so this is gonna be concentrated.

Yui:
Mm-hm.

Mio:
Page 20 in the book.
This expression.

Yui:
Mm.

Mio:
What do you get when you expand it using this one?

Yui:
Hmm.

Ritsu:
Whee!

Mio:
Here.

Yui:
Oh, I get it.

Ritsu:
Oh, manga!

Mio:
Would you shut up!

Yui:
Yeah, my feet are asleep again.

Ritsu:
Poke.

Yui:
Aah!

Mio:
Ritsu!

Yui:
It's no use, I just can't concentrate anymore!

Mio:
Come on, now, Yui.
It's only been 30 minutes since we started working.

Tsumugi:
Yui, when you're done studying, we can all eat this cake that I brought.
So hang in there a while longer, okay?

Mio:
Attagirl, Mugi!

Ritsu:
Hm, how can I get back in there?
Oh, hello, girls! I see y'all hard at work.
Hmm... Well, that didn't work.
Yay! It's me, everybody!
I needed an entrance with more impact.
Iyah! Ah! Ha! Yo! Hiya!
xxx all present! I am cop...!

Mio:
Shut up!

Yui:
This is so great!

Ritsu:
Cake like this makes life worth living.

Mio:
Boy, what kind of life do you two lead, anyway?

Ui:
Coming!

Yui:
I wonder who that is?

Oh, hi Nodoka.

Nodoka:
So, are you making any progress?

Yui:
I am. Thanks for asking.

Nodoka:
Your friends from the Light Music Club?

Yui:
Let me introduce you.
This is Mio Akiyama.
And Ritsu Tainaka.
And this is Tsumugi Kotobuki.

Mio, Ritsu, Tsumugi:
Nice to meet you.

Nodoka:
Nice to meet you, too.
My name is Nodoka Manabe.
Yui and I have been friends forever.
We even ended up in the same class in high school.

Yui:
Yeah, we've been together pretty much since kindergarten.

Nodoka:
We have this weird connection.
Anyway, I thought you all might get hungry so I brought you some sandwiches.

Yui:
Great timing, I was just getting hungry!

Mio:
Didn't you just finish eating cake?

Ritsu:
No problem at all!
Just pass them over here!
Thank you!

Nodoka:
In middle school, I came down with a bad fever and had to miss classes for a while.
Yui came over every day to bring me that day's syllabus and homework.

Yui:
I've actually never been sick a day in my life!

Nodoka:
One day, she accidentally left one of her test papers in the daily syllabus that she brought over.

Ritsu:
You haven't changed one bit!

Nodoka:
But she really was a huge help to me.

Yui:
Hehehe...

Mio:
Reminds me of that time, Ritsu...

Ritsu:
Ah! No, don't tell them out!

Yui:
She what? Tell us!

Mio:
You're not gonna believe this, but Ritsu actually...

Yui:
You did it!

Nodoka:
By the way, are you done studying?

Everyone:
Ah...

Mio:
All right, everything we've covered so far will be on the test.
In the case of x^2 - xy - 6y^2 + 2x - y + 1, you wanna first simplify by trying to factor out the common factor of x.
Now when we do that, what we end up with is x^2 - (y - 2) and x - 6y^2 - y + 1 equals x^2 - (y - 2)(2y + 1)...

Mio:
Wake up!

Tsumugi:
Please get up!

Yui:
Huh? Where am I?

Mio:
Yui, stay awake!
You'll die if you doze off!

Yui:
I came this close to falling asleep!
Wait a minute.
Commander, I don't see Squad Member Ritsu here!

Ah! She's outside, and she's... playing!

Mio:
It pains me to say it, but there is absolutely nothing I can do for her.

Yui:
No!

Mio:
Hey, Yui.

Yui:
Oh, Squad Member Ritsu!
May fortune... smile upon you...!

Everyone:
Huh?

Yui:
(x - 2y + 4)(x - y - 1)
Yes, I'm all done!

Mio:
Well, I think you've got the hang of it now.

Tsumugi:
You'll be able to ace the make-up test.

Yui:
Thanks, Mio-chan, and Thanks you, Mugi-chan!

Tsumugi:
I think it's time we called it a night.

Mio:
Hey, where's Ritsu?

Ritsu:
Oh, I lost again!

Mio:
She's getting way too cozy.
Wait! Lost again?


Teacher:
Very well, begin!

Mio:
I wonder how Yui is doing?

Ritsu:
Oh, I think she's gonna be just fine.

Mio:
Isn't that thing you should worry for?!


Sawako:
Ah, Miss Hirasawa.

Yui:
Ms. Yamanaka.

Sawako:
So, how did your test go?

Yui:
It... went...

Sawako:
It certainly looks like you studied hard for it.
As long as you don't give up, you're sure to succeed eventually!


Mio:
Yui gets her results today, right?
I wonder if she was able to pass this time?

Tsumugi:
After all the studying, I'm sure she did fine.

Everyone:
Hm?

Mio:
Well, how did you do?

Yui:
What am I gonna do, Mio?

Mio:
You mean you failed again?!

Yui:
I-I got a hundred!

Mio:
You got a what?!

Mio:
Thank goodness.
Now all your tests are behind you for the time being.

Tsumugi:
Yeah, she's right.

Yui:
I couldn't have done it without you guys!
Thank you so much!

Ritsu:
Oh, well, it was nothing!

Mio:
You didn't do a damn thing to help!

Tsumugi:
Let's get right down to practicing, then, shall we?

Mio:
Now, you were practicing your chords while you were studying, weren't you?
Why don't you try playing something.

Yui:
Hehehe...
I have it down cold!
Ask me anything! X, Y, whatever!

Everyone:
Hmm...?

Mio:
All right, then, why don't you play us a C chord followed by an A minor 7, a D minor 7, and then a G7.

Yui:
Sure thing!

Mio:
What's the matter?

Yui:
I forgot how...

Everyone:
Ah...

Yui:
It's all of the X and Y stuff I've been studying.

Mio:
So you're back to square one?!

Yui:
Um, let me see... was this an X?

Mio:
Wait, I've never seen that chord before.

Yui:
Oh, it's brand-new.
See, it's like this!

Mio, I'm positive this is an X!

Mio:
But there's no such thing as an X chord!

Ritsu:
You can play that?


-- Preview --

Mio:
We're having a training camp!

Yui:
Training camp?

Mio:
That's right.
For one thing summer vacation is almost here.

Ritsu:
We're going to the beach?!
Or maybe to the mountains?!

Mio:
We're not going out there to play around!
This will be a band training camp!
We'll be practicing nonstop from sunup to sundown.

Mugi:
Yeah, definitely! Let's go!
I've always dreamed of having a sleepover with you all.
