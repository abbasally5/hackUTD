  Sawako:
Summer vacation is starting, so try to spend it in a productive manner. Now, as seniors, you'll have summer session classes, so you should..

Yui:
Summer vacation.
Let's have another training camp!

Ritsu:
Huh? 

Yui:
Another training camp!

Tsumugi:
Oh yes, let's! 

Ritsu:
Good idea! 

Mio:
Wait! We have entrance exams to..

Yui:
Now all those in favour say aye!

All but Mio:
Aye!

Mio:
Hey, if we're voting we're gonna have to ask Azusa if she agrees..

Yui:
I already texted to Azunyan and I asked her to vote on it.

Ritsu:
That makes it four to one. Right then! We're having a training camp again this year!

All but Mio:
Yeah! 

Mio:
Y-yeah..


——OP—— 

Ui:
Come on in, everybody.

All:
Thanks for having us over. 

Ui:
Hey, big sis! Everybody's here now!

Yui:
Hey guys, come on in, come on in.

Ritsu:
Aha! Lazing around the house? 



Yui:
Come sit! Let's play video games!

Ritsu:
Whoa!

Tsumugi:
Yes, let's!
I didn't know you can..

Azusa:
Remind me what we came here for again.

Mio:
It's supposed to be a meeting about the camp.
Come on, let's get down to business. 

Yui:
[Moans] We can play for a while. 

Ritsu:
Yeah.

Azusa:
Am.. Are you sure that training camp is a good idea?

Yui:
Why wouldn't it be?

Azusa:
Well, for one thing, you're all seniors.

Ritsu:
Yeah, but we could use a break, you know?

Yui:
Yeah, that's right.

Azusa:
Are you sure it's going to be just a little?

Ritsu:
You know we went to the beach the last two years so how about the mountains this time?

Yui:
Huh? I wanna go to the beach again!

Ritsu:
We will be able to catch fish and have a BBQ!

Yui:
Oh. That sounds pretty tasty.

Ritsu:
Right?

Azusa:
I knew it, you guys just wanna goof off.

Mio:
By the way, where would you rather go, Azusa?

Azusa:
Well, Natsu-Fest takes place in the mountains!

MIo:
Really?

Yui:
Miso-Paste?

Tsumugi:
Nori-Paste?

Azusa:
No no, Not those things, Natsu-Fest!

----SIDE A----

Ritsu:
Natsu-Fest is a huge outdoor festival where lots of different bands play. Tens of thousands of people go every year.

Mio:
I've always wanted to check out Natsu-Fest at least once!

Azusa:
Yeah, me too! Fests will be a real learning experience to watch professional bands at work!

Ritsu:
So, we all agreed?

Yui:
Natsu-Fest is the mountain?

Azusa:
The venue is IN the mountains.

Yui:
Inside the mountain...
We're not gonna get in alive at there, are we?

Mio:
I really don't know what you're thinking, but whatever it is, it's wrong.

Ritsu:
What are we gonna do about getting tickets though? Is it too late to buy any?

Sawako:
What would you do without me, no more rescuing you..

All:
Ohh!? 

Azusa:
That's amazing! 

Ritsu:
That's our Sawa-chan! Wait, when did YOU get here!?

Sawako:
Could I get a cup of barley tea, too?

Ui:
O-of course!

--- 

Mio:
Well, my first Natsu-Fest.. 

Azusa:
Yeah, I've never seen an outdoor show before either! 

Mio:
I bet it feels really great! 

Sawako:
Keep that carefree attitude and you're looking at defeat.

Mio:
Defeat by what!?

Sawako:
By summer! Pay attention! The glare of the blazing sun, the sweltering heat, and the summer insects are even now awaiting to eat you alive! Those who choose to battle in Natsu-Fests must face all of these challenges, prepare yourself! 

Mio:
Yes ma'am!

Azusa:
Oh! Mio-sempai is all just-up!



Azusa:
Looks like nobody's here yet.

Tsumugi:
Azusa-chan!

Azusa:
Ah, good morning Mugi-sempai!

Tsumugi:
Good morning! Oh, are you the only one here?

Azusa:
Yes! 

Ritsu:
Morning! Hey!

Mio:
Figures you two are the only ones who manage to make it on time.

Azusa:
You look like you didn't get much sleep last night, Mio-sempai?

Ritsu:
No, she was up all night working out which band she wants to see.

Mio:
It's packed with bands I don't wanna miss!

Azusa:
Yeah, looks like they have a whole bunch of stages there.

Tsumugi:
Oh look, the bus is here.

Azusa:
I'd better try calling Yui-sempai.

Yui:
I'm right over here you guys! Hi, good morning!

Ritsu:
Yui!

Azusa:
You should have said you were already here! 

Yui:
Well, I was waiting to see when you'll notice me.

Azusa:
I'm sorry, but it never occurred to me that  you might be the first one to get here.

Mio:
Of course we're still missing one person from our group.　

Sawako:
Girls....

Yui:
Sawa-chan, what's the matter with you!?

Sawako:
I went out to a show last night and drunk until the morning.. I came straight here from the club.

Ritsu:
Sawa-chan, that was stupid. Why would you do something like that if you knew we were leaving today?

Mio:
Come on, let's hit the road! 

---

Yui:
Ugh, feel sick.

Sawako:
Oh yeah, welcome to my life. 

Yui:
You're sick because you're hungover aren't you?

Sawako:
Yeah, I live the rock-and-roll lifestyle.

Yui:
I really don't know what that means.

Tsumugi:
You too alright?

Azusa:
Yui-sempai gets carsick easily huh.

Mio:
I'm going to see this band and this band, period!

Ritsu:
You can't, Mio. They're playing on different stages at the same time!

Mio:
Then I want two bodies! 

Ritsu:
Ughh. Choose one or the other.  Or only listen to half of each one.

Mio:
I wanna teleport!

Ritsu:
Get real.

Azusa:
Mio-sempai is acting like a baby.

Tsumugi:
Ah! I want yakisoba, yakisoba! Yakisoba is the one thing I intend to eat there!

Azusa:
Mugi-sempai is acting childish too! 

Ritsu:
You guys are...

Sawako:
I wanna die..

Mio:
I can't believe I'm gonna be able to listen to music from sunup to sundown! 

Ritsu:
You know, she's been getting more and more warmed up.

Yui:
Can you really blame her?

RItsu:
Huh? You got icecream! 

Yui:
It's got lots of great things to eat and they sell lots of souvenirs too! 
Rest stops are so awesome, they have everything!

Azusa:
I thought you were feeling carsick and yucky.

Yui:
I'm all better now! Have a taste of this, Azu-nyan. Soft-serve made from the highland dairy! 

Azusa:
If you're offering...

Tsumugi:
Our rest stop is nearly over.

Yui:
Huh!? But I haven't bought any souvenirs yet! 

Azusa:
This isn't our destination Yui-sempai.

Tsumugi:
Indeed it isn't. This is no place for one to eat Yakisoba!

Azusaka:
Mugi-sempai is slightly off-kilter too.



Yui:
Are we there yet!?

Sawako:
Yui-chan, please, stay down in your seat.

Mio:
We'll make the opening ceremonies, right!?

RItsu:
Relax, we'll make it.

Yui:
They'll have tasty food there, won't they!?　

Mio:
Oh wow, two days surrounded by music!

Tsumugi:
Yui-chan, yakisoba, let's eat yakisoba!

Ritsu:
Just enjoy ourselves!

Mio:
Let's do this right!

Tsumugi:
I can't wait!

Azusa:
Are you guys gonna be.. a problem?

Sawako:
Please don't talk so damn loudly, okay..?



Yui:
It's crowded.

Mio:
Oh man, there's already so many people here.

Ritsu:
Are you okay? It hasn't even started.

Azusa:
This sure is amazing all right.

Yui:
There must be three hundred million people! 

Azusa:
That's more than the population of Japan.

Swako:
Come on, girls! That slacker attitudes end here! 

Yui:
You were slacking more than any of us were!

Ritsu:
You were flat on your back with massive hangover!

Sawako:
I've cast off the mere of yesterday.
The festival entrance, beyond there lies a battlefield.

Ritsu:
Laying it on a little thick?

Sawako:
The wristbands you've got in exchange for you tickets are your passports into this festival. If you loose them, you won't be able to allowed that again, so keep an eye on them. 
Okay, before we go in, let's go to the camping area. We need to secure place to sleep tonight.
Damn, too late. The flat area is already taken up. We'll have to settle with the inclined area. 

Yui:
Huh? But won't our blood pool in our head while we sleep? 

Ritsu:
You sleep with your head up hill dummy. 

Ritsu:
Wow, you're really an old hand at this.

Sawako:
All right. Put your things inside the tent.

Tsumugi:
Here goes.

Yui:
Mugi-chan?

Tsumugi:
Yahoooo! It's a bit stuffy, but this is wonderful!! Rather painful on the back though! 

Ritsu:
Yeah we get it, come'on! 

---

Sawako:
Do you have everything you need with you!?

Mio:
Yes, ma'am!

Sawako:
Have you all put on your sunscreen!?

Azusa:
Yes, ma'am!

Sawako:
Have you brought something to drink!?

Yui: 
I got it all covered! Me heat stroke countermeasures are in place!

Sawako:
That's not good! You should have a sport drink! 

Yui:
Should I leave this here?

Sawako:
No. Bring it. Water is useful for washing your hands or pouring over yourself when you get hot.

Ritsu: 
I guess some people enjoy being over-attentive about this stuff.

Sawako:
[screams] Why aren't you wearing your sneakers!?

Tsumugi:
I didn't bring any other shoes with me.

Yui:
Don't worry, Mugi-chan, I'll lend you my flip-flops!
I bought them because I thought we might play in the river.

Ritsu:
Do you even remember why we were here?

Tsumugi:
Yui-chan, thank you.

Yui:
Don't mention it.

Sawako:
Wait a minute, what about bug repellent?

Tsumugi:
Bug repellent present and accounted for, miss! 
Here.

Yui:
Thanks alot, Mugi-chan.

Tsumugi:
And now, here's some for you.

Mio:
This reminds me of grade school hike for some reason. 

Yui:
It's your time, Mugi-chan. Give me the bottle so I can spray some on you!

Tsumugi:
Thank you, but I can take care of it myself.

Yui:
[Groans] But I wanna make the bottle go "Pshh" too!

Tsumugi:
Alright, you can.

Mio:
Yup, definitely gradeschool.

Yui:
Ritchan, Azunyan, I'll get you guys next!

Sawako:
All right then, are you done doubling?

Ritsu,Yui:
When did Sawa-chan get over there!?

Sawako:
Forward march!

Staff:
Here you are.

Mio:
The Natsu Rock Festival, is about to begin!!

----SIDE B---

Sawako:
All right, let me explain how the grounds are laid out. 
First is the fire stage, the main venue. This is one of the two venues with the capacity of roughly 40 thousand. It has a gentle slope, so even people in the back can easily see. 
This is the thunder stage, or the alternate main stage. It can hold over ten thousand spectators and tens of cutting-edge underground bands play here throughout the festival. 

Mio:
People must go back and forth between the stages a lot.

Sawako:
Definitely. They are almost seven hundred meters apart.

Mio:
Even running a ten meters a second, it'll still take seventy second to cross!!

Ritsu:
Just breathe. 

Sawako:
There's also this indoor stage where up-and-coming bands play.
The stage far distant back features jazz bands and more unique bands. There's even a small stage that features acoustic musicians. 

Mio:
This is truly a festival of music!

Yui:
And food! Where is it that they sell food!? 

Tsumugi:
Remember Yui-chan, I'm in it for a yakisoba!!

Ritsu:
Something's seriously off-kilter with these two.

Azusa:
No kidding.

Ritsu:
You know I'm pretty amazed that you just happened to have those tickets.

Sawako:
Well, I come to this festival every year. 

Ritsu:
But why did you have six of them?

Sawako:
I was expecting to come here with some of my friends, but they canceled on me at the last minute. 

Ritsu:
Do they hate you or something?

Sawako:
Of course they don't!! ...uh, I think..

Ritsu:
How am I supposed to react to that?



Yui:
Mio-chan are you okay?

Mio:
You know, now that I'm actually here, it's really, hot and crowded.. [gasps]

Singer:
Let's get started! Are you ready!?

Crowd:
Yeah!!!

Singer:
All right, let's bring this song!!　

Yui:
Oh, wow! 

Azusa:
Their sound is so big!

Mio:
This is really Natsu-Fest... This is..

Ritsu:
Oh yeah!!

Mio:
It's Natsu-Fest!!

Yui:
Mio-chan just made a Natsu-Fest debut!

Mio:
Isn’t this band fantastic!

Ritsu:
Oh yeah, this singers voice is awesome!

Sawako:
Alright, people, we're moving on!

Yui:
Huh!?
But I wanna listen to this bands more! Don't you?

Sawako:
My top-pick band is playing at the indoor stage pretty soon. It's a little far, so we're gonna have to sprint it!

Ritsu:
Maybe you should just go by yourself, Sawa-chan.

Mio:
Ritsu, Ritsu! I'm moving too, I'm going over to the thunder stage!

Ritsu:
Right now?

Mio:
Come on let's hurry! We don't wanna miss the opening!

Yui:
Mio-chan, I'm gonna stay here okay!?

Tsumugi:
Yes, I'll stay here too!

Mio:
Okay, we'll see you guys later then!

Ritsu:
We'll touch base later and meet up somewhere, okay?

Mio:
Hurry, hurry!

Ritsu:
Alright, I'm coming!
See you later, have fun! Hey Mio, wait up!

Azusa:
You sure about this?

Yui:
You wanna stay here and listen to this great band too, don't you?

Azusa:
And what about you?

Tusmugi:
Yes, well, I can't really run in flip-flops!

Mio:
Oh, Ritsu, Ritsu!

Ritsu:
Huh!? What is it!?

Mio:
This bands' guitarist is a lefty!

Ritsu:
Oh, you're right!

Mio:
You were right! Lefties really do look kind of weird! But I'm really no one to talk though!

Yui:
I'm glad that you find the fellow yourself final, but could you please bring down your notch.　

Azusa:
Yui-sempai's entirely fixed during at the stage! I hope that being here inspire her to take practice more seriously from now on.

Yui:
Azu-nyan! I wanna ask you an important question.

Azusa:
Yes? Ask me what?

Yui:
How do you think their bassist gets his hair stay like that!? I mean that's so cool!

Tsumugi:
It has to be naturally curly.

Azusa:
You too, Mugi-sempai!?

---

Tsumugi:
It's popular..

Yui:
It's okay, we'll stand in line with you.

Azusa:
Yeah let's go!

Tsumugi:
Right!

The yakisoba stall guy:
Excuse me, everyone! Sorry xxx all sold out!　

Azusa:
Mugi-sempai!

Yui:
Just stay strong! Don't let it get you down!

Tsumugi:
Okay, let's go get what YOU want to eat.

Azusa:
Yui-chan..

Yui:
Ahh mistake! I just wanna go home now...

Azusa:
Please don't throw a tantrum.

YUi:
Oops, got a touch!

Azusa:
She's snapped right out of it!

Yui:
It's from Ritchan.
We'll be at Fire Stage from 2pm and Thunder Stage from 3pm and the Fire Stage at 4pm.

Azusa:
Wow, tough schedule!

Tsumugi:
Right! I'll run there now. Oops!

Yui,Azusa:
Mugi-chan/sempai!!

Tsumugi:
Uh...

Sawako:
Yeahhh! These guys rock!! 

Band guy:
Thank you!

---

Yui: 
God, it's down to a drizzle now.

Ritsu:
We have some time to kill before the next band we wanna see.

Yui:
Is anybody hungry? We missed lunch and I'm starving.

Azusa:
You ate crapes and ice cream and funnel cakes, remember!?

Yui:
That's desert, not lunch silly.　

Mio:
Tell you what, I'll go buy dinner for us, is that okay?

Yui:
Oh hey, I'll go with you.

Mio:
Don't worry, I've got this. You guys take up a spot for us.

Ritsu:
Okay, you know that the river that runs through the middle of the boardwalk area? We'll wait for you there.

Ritsu:
So, should we set up here?

Azusa:
It looks good!

Tsumugi:
Mio-chan!

Yui:
Welcome back!
Thanks for getting food!

Mio:
They were selling T-shirts. Look! It's for that band with the lefty guitarist!

Yui:
[cries]

Ritsu:
Where's dinner!?

Mio:
How's the look!

Ritsu:
Wow, that's nice! I think I wanna get one too!

MIo:
Why don't we all buy one?

Tsumugi:
I want one as well!

YUi:
Lemme see, lemme see!

Mio:
See, what do you think?

Ritsu:
Text from Sawa-chan. She said she bought a bunch of takoyaki for us to share.

Yui:
Ah! Takoyaki!

---

Sawako:
[sighs in relief] Myself again.

Yui:
They even have bats here.

Tsumugi:
It's amazing.

Azusa:
I have pins and needles all over..

Ritsu:
You're red as a lobster again this year.

Azusa:
I use a whole bunch of a sunscreen, but it didn't work for me..

YUi:
It's okay, you look so cute!

Azusa:
[cries]

Sawako:
Well, I'm going to turn in now.

Ritsu:
Huh, already?

Sawako:
My neck's killing me from the head-banging.
You thought that it was because of my age, didn't you?

Ritsu:
Huh!? Perish the thought! Perish the thought!

---

Azusa:
Sempai?

Yui:
Huh? Hey Azunyan.

Azusa:
What are you doing up here all by yourself?

Yui:
I've been listening to all the songs in the distance. They really do play music all night, don't they?
Come'on, sit down.

Azusa:
O-okay. Aren't you getting bitten by mosquitoes out here?

Yui:
Not a problem! I'm wearing two bug repellant wristbands!
Here, I'll give you one.

Azusa:
Thank you. 

Ritsu:
Goodness gracious me! Are you two having a secret little chat?

YUi:
Come on over you guys. Let's listen to the song from here for a bit.

Mio:
It's almost like a dream, isn't it?

Azusa:
Yeah. Feels kind of magical.

YUi:
Yeah music's played non-stop in a wide-open place like this is wonderful.

Ritsu:
Every one of the bands I saw today was totally awesome. 

Tsumugi:
Right. The music's energy, its intensity was completely incredible.

Yui:
Yeah, but, I think our performances are even more amazing.

Ritsu:
When'll you get off comparing us to pros!? My point is, you should get good enough to play guitar without flubbing notes before you say stuff like that.

Yui:
Ouch, you hit my vulnerable spot.
Still, I do think we're all amazing than all of those bands. The way we become one, or, how do I explain it..
Right! It's our aura!

Ritsu:
Do you even know what the word "aura" means?

Yui:
Uh-uh.

Mio:
She’s right. After School Tea Time is an awesome band, too!

Ritsu:
Mio? 

Mio:
Right, Yui?

Yui:
Right you are, Mio-chan!

Azusa:
You're right! We're just as good as these pro bands are!

Ritsu:
W-wait, you too!?

Mio:
Next time, we won't come to Natsu-Fest to listen, we'll come here to play!

Ritsu:
A-are you serious!?

Tsumugi:
Right, to play!

All:
Yeah!!

Ritsu:
Yeah you're right! Wouldn't it be awesome to get the chance to play here!? 

Yui:
Yeah!
I hope that I can just keep on playing in the band with you guys forever and ever.

Azusa:
So do I.

Mio:
Uh-hum.

Ritsu:
So do I.

Mio:
Me too. Forever, and ever.
