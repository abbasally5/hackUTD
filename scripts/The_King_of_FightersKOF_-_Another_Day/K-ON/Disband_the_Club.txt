  Ui:
Sis, come on!
You'd better get out of bed!
Sis?!

Yui:
Ah, it's eight!
I'm late!

Ui:
Hey you, why the rush?
Hmm?

Yui:
See you later!

Lady:
Oh, good morning, Yui.

Yui:
Uh, good morning!

What?
I read the clock wrong!

Starting today, I'm a high schooler!


-- OP --


Girls:
Congratulations on starting school here!

Girl 1:
Please join the Tennis Club!

Girl 2:
The Judo Club's better!

Girl 3:
Please join the Tea Ceremony Club!

Girl 4:
Please join the Abacus Club!

Girls:
Please! Please!

Yui:
Uh...

Huh? Hmm...

Nodoka:
What are you groaning about, Yui?

Yui:
Hmm? Oh, hello, Nodoka.
I'm not sure which club I should join in.

Nodoka:
What? You haven't decided on one?
It's already been two weeks since school started.
You have to choose!

Yui:
But I'm absolutely terrible at every sport, and I don't really get any of the literary clubs.

Nodoka:
Huh. This is how people end up becoming NEETs.

Yui:
You're pegged as a NEET just 'cause you don't join a club?

Nodoka:
You know, looking back on it, for as long as I've known you, you've never joined a single club, have you?

Yui:
Crud!
I really do feel like I ought to at least try to do something.
But what the heck should I be doing?


#1: Disband the Club!


Ritsu:
Mio!

Mio:
Ritsu?

Ritsu:
Let's go check out the club!

Mio:
Which club do you mean?

Ritsu:
The Light Music Club!
What do you think?

Mio:
But I was planning on joining the Literature Club.

Ritsu:
Huh?

Mio:
I've already filled out the application form.

Ritsu:
Hmm... Rip.

Mio:
Ah! What do you think you're doing?

Ritsu:
Come on, let's go! Move it, move it!

Mio:
Cut it out!


Ritsu:
Huh? It's disbanded?!

Sawako:
Well, on the verge of being disbanded.
All the students who were in the club last year have now graduated, so the club will be disbanded unless four students join this month.

Ritsu:
Oh, so that's why there wasn't anyone in the Music Room...

Yui:
Miss Yamanaka!

Sawako:
Hi, Yui. I'll be right there.
I'm sorry, I have a music class to teach in a few minutes.
Light Music Club, good luck!

Mio:
She sure was pretty, wasn't she?

Ritsu:
That is not the issue here.

Yui:
Oh...

Ritsu, Mio:
Oh.

Sawako:
Please hand out the syllabus sheets to all the students.

The syllabus sheets?

Yui:
Oh, right! So sorry about that!
Huh? They're staring at me!

Ritsu:
Bad tempo.
She's useless.

Yui:
I'm so sorry!

Sawako:
Are you all right?

Ritsu:
And clumsy.

Mio:
It's being disbanded, so that's that.
I'm gonna go join the Literature Club.

Ritsu:
If I join and there aren't any members, does that make me the club president?
Doesn't sound bad at all!

Yui:
What was that club you were talking about with those girls?

Sawako:
The Light Music Club?

Yui:
Yeah, what is it?

Sawako:
The Light Music Club is about playing lighthearted music.

Yui:
Light Music Club?

Sawako:
That's right.
The Light Music Club?


Mio:
So, what's your plan, Ritsu?

Ritsu:
We wait for prospective members!

Mio:
We just wait.

Ritsu:
Wait!

Mio:
Come on, let's go home.

Tsumugi:
Hello, I wanted to find out about joining your club.

Ritsu:
Ah, the Light Music Club?

Tsumugi:
No, I'm at the Choir Club.

Ritsu:
Why not join the Light Music Club instead?

Tsumugi:
But, the Choir Club...

Ritsu:
We need more members like you!

Tsumugi:
What?

Ritsu:
Please! I'm begging you!
You won't regret it, I promise!

Mio:
Don't try to force her to join like that!
It's really rude!
I'm going now. I'm sorry.

Ritsu:
Mio!

Ritsu:
What about that promise we made?
Was that just a big lie?!
That I would play drums!
And you would play the bass!
Our band!
We've been saying forever that we would start one.
We promised each other, remember?!
That night we went to see that concert together!

Mio:
This is it.

Ritsu:
This is, isn't it?

Ritsu:
Were those sweet words nothing but a big lie?!

Mio:
No, your flashback is.

Ritsu:
What? Really it is?

Ritsu:
Mio, this is it!
You and I are going to play in a band together!
Is that exciting?!

Mio:
You forced the idea on me.

Ritsu:
Yeah, but you said you wanted to!

Mio:
Yes, I did, but...

Ritsu:
And if we went pro, we said we'd split all the proceeds 70/30!

Mio:
Don't make stuff up.
Huh?

Ritsu:
Uh...

Tsumugi:
This will be a great deal of fun.
The only instrument I can play is the keyboard.
But I'd like to join your club if you'll have me.

Ritsu:
Uh... Thank you so much!
Now we only need one more person to join us!

Mio:
Oh, I suppose that means I'm already a member.

Ritsu:
Uh... You're...

Tsumugi:
Tsumugi Kotobuki.

Ritsu:
I'm Ritsu Tainaka, drums.
This is Mio Akiyama, she's on bass.
Let's see... Now we need a guitar player!


Nodoka:
Yui?

Yui:
My high school years are very important.
I wanna do something...

Nodoka:
Well, then do it.

Yui:
But I have absolutely no idea what it is I should do!

Nodoka:
Oh, good grief...

Girl:
Would you like any french fries with that, Miss?

Tsumugi:
Uh, yes, I would love some, thank you.

Girl:
Thank you.

Ritsu:
What is it?

Tsumugi:
This is my first time eating in a fast food restaurant!

Ritsu:
How can that be?

Tsumugi:
I know it's silly but I've always dreamed of having someone ask me if I wanted french fries.

Ritsu:
Huh?

Tsumugi:
Oh, I'm sorry. Please begin the meeting.

Ritsu:
Oh. 'Kay, this meeting's come to order!
Our goal is to recruit one more member by the end of the month!

Tsumugi:
How in the world do we do that?

Ritsu:
That's why we're meeting to think of a way right now!
For instance, offering people an amazing prize if they decide to join!

Mio:
An amazing prize?

Ritsu:
Yeah. Like some kind of gift or something.

Tsumugi:
Like a car or a plane or a boat?

Mio:
Amazing but impractical.

Ritsu:
More along the lines of ice cream or help with homework.

Mio:
Who would join up for something like that?

Tsumugi:
What should we do, then?

Everyone:
Hmm...


Ritsu:
Nyororin...

Mio:
The president shouldn't lose interest!

Ritsu:
Come up with something to keep me interested.

Mio:
I wanna go home.

Tsumugi:
For now, why don't we...


Everyone:
One, two!

Ritsu:
There's just one more week remaining in April.

Tsumugi:
No one's answered our ads yet.

Mio:
Disbanded before we are a band.

Ritsu:
I won't let that happen!

Yui:
Huh? Hmm...
Wait, Light Music, huh?

Here, my click, clack, click, clack, here [high] is a click...

Teacher:
You're very good at that, Yui.

Yui:
Hahaha!

Yui:
I'm gonna do it!

-- EYE CATCH --

Yui:
For the time being, I have decided to join the Light Music Club!

Nodoka:
Oh, yeah?
So, what is it that they do at this club?

Yui:
Dunno.

Nodoka:
Huh?

Yui:
But since the name of the club is "light music," I figured they only do really easy stuff.
You know like whistling.

Nodoka:
Sounds like they don't have much ambition.

You see? It looks like they're some kind of band.

Yui:
What? But I don't know how to play the guitar!

Nodoka:
Well then, what can you play?

Yui:
Um... I can play castanets.

Uh, click, clack, click...

Nodoka:
That's a perfect fit for you.


Ritsu:
See? Look at this here...

Mio:
What's with that?

Sawako:
Good afternoon.

Everyone:
Good afternoon.

Sawako:
A prospective member has come forward.

Ritsu:
Oh!

Sawako:
Here. Isn't that wonderful news?
Also that's a lovely tea set, but make sure you clean up after yourselves once you're done, all right?

Everyone:
All right!

Ritsu:
Yes! Now we won't be disbanded!

Mio:
Yui Hirasawa...

Ritsu:
Just her name makes her sound really awesome!

Mio:
She's got to be a guitarist.

Tsumugi:
I can't wait to meet her.

Ritsu:
Yeah! A real powerhouse has joined us!

Yui:
Light Music Club...
Light Music Club...

If I don't get down this hallway, I won't reach the Light Music Club!

Sawako:
Oh, hello.

Sawako:
The Light Music Club is up in the Music Room.

Yui:
This is the place?
And it won't be an easy thing to say right after joining, but I've got to quit.
I wonder what kind of people would join a Light Music Club?

Krauser II:
Oh, you want to quit, do you?
Did you think you could walk away without any consequences?!
I'll murder you!

Yui:
What am I gonna do?!
Ahh!
You've got it all wrong!
You've got it all wrong!

Ritsu:
What? It's the useless clumsy bad tempo girl!
What is it you're doing?

Yui:
You startled me.

Ritsu:
Uh, you are Yui Hirasawa by any chance?

Yui:
Y-Yes.

Ritsu:
The girl who wants to join us?

Yui:
Y-Yes.

Ritsu:
I'm so sorry I misjudged you!
I'm sure you must be totally awesome on guitar!
We've all been waiting for you to get here!

Yui:
It seems like someone's been embellishing things about me...

Ritsu:
Hey, guys!
Our brand-new member has arrived!

Mio:
Is that her?

Tsumugi:
Aha!

Mio:
Welcome to the Light Music Club!

Tsumugi:
It's so good to have you here!

Ritsu:
Right! Mugi, go get the tea ready!

Tsumugi:
Okay.

Yui:
What should I do?

Tsumugi:
Go ahead, it's quite delicious.

Yui:
Wow, this is great!

This is so good!

Maybe I should give up on trying to quit...

Ritsu:
What kind music do you like to play?

Yui:
Huh?

Ritsu:
Who's your all time favorite band?
Which guitarists do you like?

Yui:
Uh...
Oh my... I have to tell them.
I can't really play the guitar at all!
J... J... J...

Mio:
Oh, are you trying to say Jimi Hendrix?!

Ritsu:
Wow.

Yui:
No, it's not. I mean, I don't...

Mio:
Jimmy Page, then?!

Yui:
No! Oh, no, I ju... ju...

Mio:
Jeff Beck?!

Yui:
Are there really this many guitarists whose names start with "J"?!

Ritsu:
Oh, wow, Jeff Beck, that's cool!

Tsumugi:
Who is he?

Mio:
In the music world, they say that there's only two kind of rock guitarists: Jeff Beck, and everyone else.
He's a brilliant and challenging guitarist who's always searching for new sounds.

Tsumugi:
My goodness.

Ritsu:
You're so hardcore, Miss Hirasawa!
I gotta say I'm so glad that someone like her joined the club.

Tsumugi:
We were at the point where the club would have been disbanded if we hadn't gotten another member within the next week.

Ritsu:
Thank you so much for joining!

Yui:
They keep making it harder!
But I'm... I'm just going to have to spit it out!
Um, I'm really sorry, I don't know how to say it if I made a mistake joining this club but I only came here to beg you to let me quit!

Ritsu:
What?

Yui:
I can't play the guitar.
I thought you would be playing a different kind of instrument.

Tsumugi:
What instrument can you play, then?

Yui:
Casta... Er, the harmonica.

Ritsu:
Oh, I have a harmonica right here.
Try playing something!

Yui:
Oh, sorry, I can't play it!

Mio:
But, Miss Hirasawa, if you wanted to join this club, that means that you're at least interested in music, right?

Tsumugi:
Is there another club you'd rather join?

Yui:
Uh, no, none in particular.

Ritsu:
We can't let this mark leave this room no matter what!

Mio:
To keep the club from being disbanded...

Tsumugi:
We have to keep her here somehow!

Yui:
I'm sorry, I really mean it. Bye.

Ritsu:
Wait just a minute!

Tsumugi:
How about another cup of tea?

Yui:
But I...

Tsumugi:
We have cookies and madeleines as well.

Ritsu:
Mm-hm.

Mio:
They're baiting the hook!

Yui:
So good...
I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to come here and gorge myself.

Ritsu:
Hey, don't sweat it!

Tsumugi:
I think we should start eating snacks like this every day from now on.

Mio:
Aren't we drifting off topic here... Ow!

Ritsu:
Miss Hirasawa, what other sorts of things do you like?

Yui:
Oh, I like anything that tastes good.

Ritsu:
Geez, just food?

On your days off, do you spend your time at home doing anything in particular?

Yui:
Just sitting around, I guess.

Tsumugi:
What kind of things do you like?

Yui:
Um, I like cute things, I guess.

Mio:
Have any weaknesses?

Yui:
I'm not very good with extreme heat or cold.
I spend winter under the table where it's warm.
And in the summer, I spend my time on the floor where it's cool.

Mio:
She's a tough one.

Ritsu:
What the heck do we do?

Tsumugi:
I don't know.

Yui:
Um, I should go.

Ritsu:
Please, don't go, I'm begging you!
You can just hang out and do nothing if you want!

Tsumugi:
I'll try to bring even tastier snacks, okay?

Yui:
I'm really sorry.
I didn't take things seriously when I applied to join.
I got all your hopes up.
How can I ever apologize?

Tsumugi:
We're the ones who should apologize.

Mio:
We shouldn't have tried to force you to stay.

Ritsu:
So please!
At least hang around for a while and listen to us play a song!

Yui:
You'll play a song for me?!

Ritsu:
She's swallowed the bait!

Yui:
Oh,..

Ritsu:
One, two, three, four!

Ritsu:
What did you think?

Yui:
I don't know what to say...
It's really hard to put into words!

Ritsu:
Mm-hm.

Yui:
You guys aren't very good, are you?

Ritsu:
Talk about blunt!

Yui:
But it seemed like it would be a whole lot of fun to do!
I decided that I'm going to join this club!

Ritsu:
Banzai!
Excuse me.
Okay, let's commemorate the start of the Light Music Club!

Mio:
Hey, that's my camera.

Ritsu:
Here we go, guys!

Yui:
But the problem is that I can't play any instruments at all.
Can I be a manager or something?

Ritsu:
Well, we aren't a sports club.

Tsumugi:
I know, why don't you take this opportunity to begin learning the guitar?

Yui:
But it looks very complicated!
I don't think I could...

Ritsu:
Don't worry about it.
Between the three of us, we'll teach you everything you need to know.

Yui:
I guess you're right.
Listening to you play just now made me feel like I can do at least that well, if not a lot better!

Ritsu:
So glad to be of help.


Nodoka:
What? You went ahead and joined anyway?

Yui:
Mm-hm. They practically begged me to join!

Nodoka:
Seriously?!
Oh, as a manager or something, right?

Yui:
When someone else says it, it sounds insulting.
I joined as a full-fledged member of the band.
And they say they'll teach me to play guitar!

Nodoka:
Oh, that means you're gonna have to go out and buy yourself a new guitar.

Yui:
I wonder if they'll let me borrow one?

Nodoka:
Probably not.

Yui:
You can buy them for about $50, right?

Nodoka:
Oh, boy.
I wonder if the Light Music Club knows what they're getting themselves into with this girl.

Yui:
Hehehe.


-- Preview --

Yui:
Hey, everyone!
These three are my fellow Light Music Club members.

Tsumugi:
I wanted to pick a club where I could make friends with sort of fun, pleasant people that one so rarely meets.

Mio:
Y-Yui?

Ritsu:
All right!
Let's get to it!
Go!

Yui:
Hey, guys!
Ow!

Now that I finally made it to high school.
I've joined a club for the first time!
