  Yui:
Wow, you sure have thick eyebrows, Mugi-chan!

Tsumugi:
Yes. But they're actually... takuan pickles!

Yui:
Ahhh.
Wow, they're delicious!

Tsumugi:
What's delicious?

Yui:
Takuan...

Ui:
A priest?

Ui:
Looks like your fever's still really high...

Yui:
Sigh... Oh, that's right... I have a bad cold. Achoo!
Ui...

Ui:
Here. Blow.

Yui:
Thanks a lot, Ui...

Ui:
I'll let the school know that you're sick.

Yui:
I'm sorry...
You'd better hurry up, you're gonna be late.

Ui:
Oh, there's ice cream and mandarin orange jelly in the fridge.

Yui:
Wow, you left me a feast! Thanks a lot, Ui...

Ui:
If you need anything, call my cell.

Yui:
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

-- (OP) --

Azusa:
So, her fever still hasn't come down...

Ui:
No. She'll probably have to stay home tomorrow, too.

Azusa:
There's only four days left...

Ui:
I'd gladly trade places with her if I could.
By getting her cold to move to me.

Azusa:
How would you move her cold to you?

Ui:
I don't know... Oral transmission?

Azusa:
She's daring...

Ritsu:
Greetings!

Mio:
Don't spook the underclassmen!


-- Final Episode: Light Music! --


Mio:
She is?

Ritsu:
No excuse!
Getting sick at a time like this just shows her lack of dedication!

Mio:
You're the one who gave it to her!

Ritsu:
Huh? Oh, I did?

Azusa:
Yes, you did!
I mean look at the timing of it!

Ui:
Ah, she probably caught it the other day...

Sawako:
I want you to pick your stage outfits from these!

Ritsu:
You're forcing us to?!

Azusa:
When did she have time to make all these?

Sawako:
Pick anything you like!
How about this waitress outfit, isn't it cute?

Tsumugi:
What can I get for you today?

Mio:
No way!
That's even worse!
That's... not bad, actually.
Miss Yamanaka, I think I'm really starting to enjoy this.

Sawako:
Isn't it fun?

Ritsu:
[Where did you going?]

Yui:
You guys, look at this!

Azusa:
Hey, how about we all wear these?

Yui:
These are so cute!

Tsumugi:
Oh, they are! They look easy to move in, too!

Mio:
I guess these aren't so bad.

Yui:
C'mon, these are great!
Let's wear these!
Let's wear these!
Let's wear these!
Let's wear these...

Ui:
Sis was crazy about her yukata.
So much so that she wore hers all day long, and that might be the reason why she caught a bad cold.

Ritsu:
What is she too.

Azusa:
Sounds like Yui-senpai, all right.

Ritsu:
Yeah, well, I gotta admit that at the time I was thinking that those outfits were pretty awesome, too.

Azusa:
You know, when you think about them rationally, they're actually kind of embarrassing.

Ritsu:
You agree, Mio?

Mio:
Azusa. Would you mind practicing all the lead guitar part starting today?

Ritsu:
You think that Yui might not get better in time?

Azusa:
But I--

Mio:
Look, it's just so we can be prepared for the worst.
See you after school.

Ritsu:
Later.

Ui:
I'm sorry...

Azusa:
Mm.

Yui:
Seconds, please...

Ui:
I'm home.

Ui:
Oh, poor Sis...

Yui:
Yum!

Mio:
Azusa, can you handle it?

Azusa:
Yes, I think so.

Mio:
All right. Then, let's run through it one more time from the top.

Azusa:
Sure.

Yui:
Hey there!

Mio:
Ah, you're here!

Azusa:
Senpai!

Tsumugi:
Are you over your cold?

Yui:
Huh? My cold?

Azusa:
That's awfully forced...

Mio:
Well, I guess that means you're feeling fine, then.

Ritsu:
If you were feeling better, then you should've come into school this morning!
All of us were pretty worried about you!

Yui:
Huh? Oh, that! Right! I suddenly felt better after classes had already ended!

Ritsu:
You just wanted to skip school.

Azusa:
That's not important, let's just start practicing, right?

Yui:
Yeah, sure, why not.

Yui:
How's that?

Everyone:
Huh?

Mio:
What do you think?

Tsumugi:
I'm not certain, but--

Ritsu:
Maybe it was just a fluke.

Mio:
Maybe you're right.
Let's try it one more time.

Tsumugi:
I agree.

Mio:
Yui.

Yui:
Yes?

Mio:
Our sound is way too tight!
It's never ever felt like that before!

Ritsu:
All of a sudden, you're playing way too on the beat! What happened?

Yui:
Not a thing!

Tsumugi:
The moon's turned to blood...

Azusa:
So, what's the problem?
If our sound is tight, that's a good thing!
If you ask me, that's the best we've ever played.

Yui:
Yeah, yeah!
I think we should listen to Azusa!

Tsumugi:
Guess you're right.

Ritsu:
I suppose we were just thrown for a loop.

Yui:
Miss Ritsu, you and Miss Tsumugi just worry too much.

Ritsu:
Miss Ritsu?

Tsumugi:
Miss Tsumugi?

Sawako:
It's time you dropped the masquerade... Ui-chan.

Ritsu:
When did you--?!

Everyone:
Ui-chan?!

Sawako:
You may be able to fool others, but you can't fool me.
Your boobs are bigger than Yui-chan's!

Yui:
I-I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about!

Azusa:
Okay, call me by my nickname, then.

Yui:
A-Azusa #2!

Azusa:
An imposter!

Ui:
I'm so sorry.

Mio:
Well, I have to admit you were a dead ringer for Yui. I had no idea.

Tsumugi:
I didn't know that you could play the guitar, Ui-chan.

Ui:
I can't. But Sis let me hold it a few times.

Yui:
Oh, I see, so that's how you play it!

Ui:
Yeah, It's written right here!

Everyone:
Why am I not surprised?

Ritsu:
You know, we might be better off if Yui just stayed home and we let Ui play.

Mio:
Ritsu.

Ui:
I should apologize to you, too.

Azusa:
Sure.

Ui:
See, when I saw my sister lying there in bed, I couldn't just stand there and do nothing.

Yui:
Hey there...

Ritsu:
Oh, serious deja vu!

Azusa:
Senpai!

Yui:
Sorry I made you guys worried about me.

Tsumugi:
Are you feeling better?

Yui:
I am! When I woke up a little while ago, I was feeling a lot better than before.
I'd hoped to get in a little practice-- Achoo!

Ritsu:
Gross!

Yui:
Honest, I'm all better!

Ritsu:
You're a liar.
I need a tissue, too.

Yui:
Oh, Geeta! So that's where you've been!
Come here! Oh, you're heavy!

Ui:
Oh, Sis!

Yui:
Let me make chicken soup with them next time...

Mio:
Hey, your fever hasn't gone down at all!

Yui:
I'm sorry...
I guess I won't make it.
Maybe you'd all be better off playing without me.

Tsumugi:
Nonsense!

Yui:
Azu-nyan, you take lead guitar for me, okay?

Azusa:
No way.

Tsumugi:
Azusa...

Azusa:
I said no! If we all can't play together, I'd rather just cancel the show!

Mio:
Azusa, wait!
Yui. Don't come to the club until the show.

Yui:
You're kicking me out?

Mio:
No. I'm ordering you to stay home and rest, so you can completely get over your cold.
And then we'll ALL play the show together.
Don't you dare give up until then. Got it?

Yui:
Mio-chan...

Mio:
And I want you to practice the lead part, too, Azusa.
Not just for when Yui's gone, but for the future of our band.

Azusa:
Senpai...

Mio:
For now, let's do everything we can to get ourselves ready for the show.


Ui:
Okay, good night.

Yui:
Good night.

Yui:
I'm gonna sleep a lot. I'm gonna sleep as much as I can!
I'm gonna get better in time for the show!


-- (EYE CATCH) --


Tsumugi:
Yui still isn't here...

Azusa:
Call her cell?

Tsumugi:
She sent a message saying that she would be here no matter what.

Mio:
But it's already 12:30.

Ritsu:
Do you wanna rehearse?
The versions without Yui's parts.

Mio:
I guess we have to.

Azusa:
No!
Don't you see we can't do that! There's no point in practicing if Yui-senpai isn't here with us.

Nodoka:
What's the matter?
I've pushed back your set 10 minutes,
but please be at the auditorium at 1PM as scheduled.

Mio:
Understood.

Nodoka:
I see that all club members are present?
"Light Music Club: all participants are present and ready"... Good.

Mio:
Nodoka?

Nodoka:
One time...


Yui:
Oh no, buckets are full...

Nodoka:
Yui-chan?

TV:
We'll use this.
Is that really safe?


Nodoka's Mother:
Yui-chan, it's nice to see you again.

Nodoka:
Ah! Ugh! Eeeeek!

Ritsu:
What the heck?

Azusa:
She's been strange all her life, hasn't she?

Tsumugi:
But what's the point of that story?

Nodoka:
That when Yui is focused on something, she loses sight of everything else.
I'm sure that she'll forget about her cold. That's why I know she--

Sawako:
'Sup, girls!

Ritsu:
Way to ruin the moment!
More to the point, where the heck have you been?
We're having a crisis here!

Sawako:
Well, I can now show you that I haven't been spending my time doing nothing.
I factored in the temperature outside and made the stylish cold-weather version of those yukata!

Everyone:
I wish you'd focus that enthusiasm someplace else.

Sawako:
And so without further ado!

Yui:
Excuse me for being late...

Ritsu:
Yui!

Mio:
You should've come to the club room first!

Yui:
Sorry about that.
A-Azu-nyan?

Azusa:
That was so mean! Here we were worried about you, and you--
It was so mean!

Mio:
You'd better make amends. Azusa was more worried about you than any of us.

Yui:
Huh? She was?
Azu-nyan!

Azusa:
What you did was terrible! For one thing, when you have a cold, you--

Yui:
Glomp! I didn't mean to worry you.
Sorry Azu-nyan.
I'll give it everything I've got.
Together with all you guys, okay?
We'll make this the best show ever.

Azusa:
Geez.
Okay, just this once.

Yui:
Now, come on, let's kiss and make up!

Yui:
You think that Azu-nyan was really worried about me?

Mio:
I guess.

Nodoka:
All right, it's time, girls. Time to get going.

Everyone:
Yeah!

Yui:
Wait a sec. Where's Geeta?

Ritsu:
Huh?

Yui:
I left him here, didn't I?

Ritsu:
Oh, I think Ui-chan took it home with her.

Ui:
Sis? I'm gonna leave the guitar right here.

Yui:
Sure... Thanks a lot, Ui...

Yui:
Oh my gosh, she did!
What do I do?!

Sawako:
Guess we have no choice...

Yui:
Miss Yamanaka?

Sawako:
Here. Use this one.

Ritsu:
Do you mind playing a different guitar?

Yui:
Actually, I CAN'T play any guitar except Geeta!

Everyone:
There's a shock...

Yui:
Whoaahh!

Ui:
Aha. Wow, it's packed already!
I'll just stand.

Jun:
Hi, Ui-chan?

Ui:
Huh? There you are!

Announcement:
And now, get ready for a performance by "After-school Teatime" of the Light Music Club.

Ui:
Oh no, where's Sis?

Ritsu:
One, two, three!

--(performance)--

Yui:
I found it!
I have to hurry!
Come to think of it, I ran down this road the day of the entrance ceremony, too.
I was thinking, "I've gotta do something!" as I ran.
And also "What am I going to do?"
And "Is this really how I'm gonna grow up?"

Yui:
Listen up, me...
The me of that day, you don't have to worry.
You'll find it soon enough.
You'll find something that you can do.
Something that you can lose yourself in.
And a place that...
A place that...
A place that means more than anything to you!

Ui:
Oh, Big Sis!

Yui:
Ui!
Peace!

Ui:
Big Sis, you can do it!

Yui:
Yeah!

Yui:
Miss Yamanaka, thanks a lot!

Sawako:
All right, ladies, knock 'em dead.

Student:
Miss Yamanaka, you're awesome!

Yui:
I really am sorry, you guys.
Now that I think about it, I'm always causing trouble for you...
And it's always at important times like this!

Mio:
You should at least tie your tie.

Ritsu:
We all think you're the greatest, Yui.

Student:
You can do it, Yui!
Go get them, Yui!

Yui:
Um, once again, we're After-school Teatime.
I'm sorry to all of you. I was so late today because I left my guitar at home.
Sorry I forgot you, Geeta.

Ui:
That's why?!

Yui:
When we started the Light Music Club, we said that our slogan was gonna be "Budokan or bust!"
We worked after-school jobs together so I could buy Geeta, we had tea in the club room together and talked about everything.
We had training camps at Mugi-chan's summer house, and looked for a new student who would join the club.
I can't really say that we devoted ourselves wholeheartedly to practicing,
but right now, for us standing here on the stage, this auditorium is our Budokan!
And we'll sing our hearts out to the very end!
Fuwa Fuwa Time, guys!

Yui:
One more time!

Yui:
I love light music!
Ritchan, let's do another one!

Ritsu:
You got it!

Nodoka:
Yui!

Yui:
Nodoka-chan!

Nodoka:
Your time is up!

Yui:
Huhhhh?

-- Preview --

Yui:
What about a marshmallow soy milk hot pot or a chocolate curry hot pot?

Mio:
Let's see...

Ritsu:
Uh, it's nothing!
Check it!
Moustache!

Tsumugi:
I have to... bow out today.

Yui:
Do you have plans?

Tsumugi:
Um, sort of...
Bye!
