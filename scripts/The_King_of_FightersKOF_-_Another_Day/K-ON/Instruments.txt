  Nodoka:
Yui.

Yui:
Hi, Nodoka.

Nodoka:
Wanna walk home with me?

Yui:
Oh, no, I'm sorry, Nodoka.
There's a club meeting I have to go to today.

Nodoka:
Oh, really?
I guess I'll have to walk by myself.
She's finally found something she can get into.
I'm happy and sad at the same time.

Yui:
Hehehe...

Nodoka:
What's wrong, Yui?

Yui:
Mugi-chan said she's gonna bring some tasty snacks today!

Nodoka:
You're not going to play guitar?

Yui:
Huh? Hehehe...

Nodoka:
Huh...

Yui:
It was like this even in kindergarten.
And in grade school, too.
Even when we got into middle school.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Nodoka: Your ice cream.)
My life's always been kinda unfocused.
And now that I finally made it to high school.
I've joined a club for the first time!


-- OP --


Yui:
Hey, everyone!

These three are my fellow Light Music Club members.

Mio:
Hello.

Yui:
This is Mio Akiyama, our bassist.
She's tall and pretty, and gives off a real "cool grown woman" vibe.

Hey, Mio.
How come you decided to take up playing bass instead of a regular guitar?

Mio:
Hmm... Playing guitar is... well, embarrassing.

Yui:
Embarrassing?

Mio:
You know, the guitar is the core instrument of the band, and because of that, you have to play right up in front of the group.
So the eyes of everyone in the audience are on you.
Just thinking about being in a position like that makes me... Ah!

Yui:
Mio!

Mio is kinda delicate.

Tsumugi:
Mio, are you all right?

Yui:
This is our keyboardist, Tsumugi Kotobuki.
We call her Mugi for short.
She's calm, soothing, and really really nice.

You know, you're a terrific keyboard player, Mugi.
I bet you've been playing for a long time.

Tsumugi:
I started studying the piano when I was only four years old.
I've been managed to win a few awards at some competitions.

Yui:
Oh, wow! That's amazing!

Why did she join the Light Music Club?

Tsumugi:
All right, dig in, everyone!

Yui:
Oh, I almost forgot, I've been meaning to ask you something.
This club room is really nice and very well equipped.
Are all of the high schools in this area like this nowadays?

Tsumugi:
Oh, no. I brought all that stuff from my house.

Yui:
It's yours?!

Tsumugi:
Yes!

Yui:
Mugi is definitely one of those "rich girl" types.

Our drummer's name is Ritsu Tainaka.
She's a cheerful girl who's just full of energy.

You really seem like someone who would be a drummer.

Ritsu:
What?!
I've got a completely legitimate reason for that.
A powerful reason that moves almost everyone who hears it!

Yui:
What? Tell me, tell me, come on!

Ritsu:
It's because...

Yui:
Hmm?

Ritsu:
Well, you know it's... 'Cause they're cool.

Yui:
That's it?

Ritsu:
Oh, come on!
Just imagining I gotta wriggle my fingers like crazy just to play a guitar, bass, or keyboard makes me wanna scream!
I... really hate it.

Yui:
Wow, I guess your choice of instruments reflects your personality.


#2: Instruments!


Tsumugi:
Would you like another one?

Yui:
Yes, thank you!
So you first wanted to join the Choir Club, but joined ours instead?

Tsumugi:
That's right.
You see, I wanted to pick a club where I could make friends with sort of fun, pleasant people that one so rarely meets.

Mio, Ritsu:
We're like rare animals to her?

Mio:
That reminds me, Miss Hirasawa, have you bought your guitar yet?

Yui:
Just call me Yui.
After all, I already call you by your first name, right, Mio?

Mio:
Y-Yui?

Yui:
Oh, that's so cute!

Ritsu:
Oh, what about your guitar, Yui?

Yui:
Huh? Guitar?
Oh, yeah, that's right!
I forgot. I'm supposed to play guitar, aren't I?

Mio:
Yeah, well, this is the Light Music Club.

Yui:
Hehehe...
Do you know how much guitars are gonna cost? A lot?

Mio:
Hmm...

Well, the cheap ones start way down in the low hundreds, but believe me you really don't want one that's too cheap.
Something around $500 should be fine.

Yui:
Oh, that much?!
$500 is ten months' allowance.

Mio:
Yeah well, expensive guitars can run up into the thousands.

Yui:
Can I use club funds?

Ritsu:
Nothing doing!

Tsumugi:
Here, try one, they're delicious.

Mio:
Anyway, we can't really do anything if you don't have an instrument.

Ritsu:
Right, then. Let's go check out guitars on our next day off!
And go!


Yui:
'Tis vexing...

Yes?

Ui:
Hey, come on, Sis.
Dinner's ready.

Yui:
Oh, Ui...

Ui:
What's wrong, Big Sis?

Yui:
I joined the Light Music Club.

Ui:
Really?

Yui:
So... I wanna buy a guitar I can use.

Ui:
Well, I didn't even know you could play the guitar!

Yui:
I can't!
So anyway, you think maybe you could lend me some money, I'll pay you back.

Ui:
I'm sorry, but I don't have a whole lot of money either.

Yui:
Yeah, I figured...

Ui:
Hey, why don't you just ask Mom for an advance on your allowance?

Yui:
Huh?

Ui:
I'll even go with you if you want me to, to back you up.

Yui:
Oh, Little Sis.
I can always count on you!

Ui:
Hehe...


Ritsu:
Oh, Yui, hey!
Over here! Over here!

Yui:
Oh, hey, guys!
Ow! Sorry!

Mio:
She's got like ten feet left.

Ritsu:
But she can't make it the rest of the way?

Yui:
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good doggie?

Tsumugi:
Did the money situation work out?

Yui:
I begged my mom and I got her to give me a $500 advance on my allowance.
I have to be real careful with my spending from now on...
And make sure I don't waste money...
I can buy this now!

Ritsu:
Oh, come on, Yui!

Yui:
Oh, I'm just looking.

Yui:
Boy, I'm exhausted.

Ritsu:
I stocked up!

Tsumugi
Wow, this was a lot of fun, wasn't it?

Yui:
So, where do you guys wanna go next?
Wait a sec. Are we forgetting something?

Mio:
Your instrument, dummy!

Yui:
Whoa, geez, I forgot!


Yui:
Oh, wow!
Look at all the guitars!
Oh... Huh? Hmm...

Monster:
Hey, hey!

Ritsu:
Yui! See anything that you like?

Yui:
Are there guidelines or something to choose by?

Mio:
Of course there are.
There's the tone of the guitar, of course.
But there's also its weight, composition, and the shape and thickness of the neck.
So for girls, one with a slender neck would be...

Yui:
This guitar here is cute!

Mio:
She never listens!

Ritsu:
That guitar costs $2,500.

Yui:
Wow, it does.
Oh, that's way, way more than I can afford.

Tsumugi:
Do you have your heart set on this one?

Yui:
Uh-huh.

Tsumugi:
Uh.

Ritsu:
Um, there's some cheap ones over there.

Yui:
I really want this one, though...

Mio:
This reminds me how badly I wanted my current bass.
I agonized over it.

I-I'd like this one!

Ritsu:
And I haggled like crazy when I bought my used drum set.

You can do better!
No, try again!

Mio:
You made the salesman cry.

Ritsu:
Yeah, well, I wasn't leaving the store without those drums.

Yui:
Um, what is "haggling"?

Mio:
Hm?

Ritsu:
It's when you use grift and determination to force someone to lower the price on something you really want!

Tsumugi:
That is amazing!
It's almost admirable!

Mio:
What's so admirable about it?
Huh? Yui...

Ritsu:
Ah, got it! Let's all get a temp job!

Tsumugi:
Temp job?

Ritsu:
Mm-hm. So we can help Yui buy her guitar!

Yui:
No, I can't let you do that!

Ritsu:
Don't sweat it!
This will be a club activity!

Yui:
Oh, Ritchan...

Tsumugi:
I'll try it! It could be fun!

Yui:
Mugi-chan?

Ritsu:
All right!
Let's get to it!
Go!

Tsumugi:
Go!

Ritsu:
Go!

Tsumugi:
Go!

Ritsu:
Go!

Mio:
What kind of job are we talking about?


-- EYE CATCH --


Nodoka:
A job?

Yui:
Yes, so I can buy a guitar!

Nodoka:
When did she become so self-sufficient?
I'm happy and sad at the same time.

Yui:
The rest of the Light Music Club have offered to help me get it.

Nodoka:
What? You've got the others involved?

Yui:
Yeah!


Yui:
So, what kind of job should we be looking for?

Ritsu:
We could hand out packs of tissues.

Mio:
I-I can't...

Ritsu:
What about a job in fast food?

Mio:
Welcome, can I take your order?

That's the problem.

Ritsu:
Oh, right.
Might be a kind of tough hurdle for you, Mio.

Mio:
I couldn't push the button if I thought somebody scary would answer.
I can't go and take orders!
Oh...

Tsumugi:
Miss Mio!

Yui:
Oh, please don't push yourself on my account!

Mio:
I keep telling myself I can't do it before I even try.
This is so Yui can buy a guitar!
So it's for the greater good of the Light Music Club!
I have to overcome my limitations!
Name the job! I'll do anything!

Ritsu:
Ah!

Mio:
W-What is it?

Ritsu:
How about this?

Everyone:
"Traffic Volume Survey"?

Ritsu:
We have to count the number of people and cars that pass by us.
We do it using a counter.

Yui:
Like the Wild Bird Society!

Ritsu:
This is a job even Mio can do!

Tsumugi:
Yes, you're right!


Yui:
See you later!

Ui:
Wait, Sis!
Don't forget your lunch!

Yui:
Whoa, why so much?

Ui:
I made lunch for everyone else in the Light Music Club, too.
I mean after all they took this job to help you, right?

Yui:
Yeah, thanks, Ui!


Ritsu:
Here.
Now, we'll work in pairs and trade off every hour.

Tsumugi:
Goodness, you're very nimble.

Yui:
Oh, yeah.

Ritsu:
Oh, it looks like a challenge.

Yui:
Oh, you're really fast, Ritchan!

Ritsu:
Ow!
Finger cramped!

Mio:
That happens when you get worked up.

Tsumugi:
You know, we have a bit of time before the survey starts.
I think we should all have some tea.

Yui:
Yeah, let's go have a picnic!

Mio:
You guys really worry me sometimes.

Yui:
This weather sure feels nice today, doesn't it, Mugi?

Tsumugi:
Yes, it does.

Yui:
She is like a highlands princess!

Mio:
Huh?
A magazine giveaway?

Ritsu:
One of the prizes is a guitar.

Mio:
That might just be the fastest way to get it, all right.

Ritsu:
Could be.

Yui:
Ah...
Mugi, aren't you tired at all?

Tsumugi:
No, I feel fine.

Yui:
Then, your thumb doesn't hurt, either?

Tsumugi:
Uh-uh.

Yui:
You aren't sleepy?

Tsumugi:
Oh... I just pressed the button on the counter instead of answering you!

Yui:
Hehe.

Mio:
She's playing a four beat.
And that's an eight beat.

Keep your mind on the job!

Yui:
Mugi, these sweets are really great and all, but is it okay for us to keep eating this fancy food all the time?

Tsumugi:
Oh, it's fine.
All sorts of people give me these all the time.
If I left them at home, it would only go to waste.

Yui:
People bring your family enough sweets to go to waste?
What kind of family are you?!

Ritsu:
I'm counting the clouds.

Mio:
Is this an occupational sickness?

Ritsu:
That's a wrap for day one!

Tsumugi:
Well, I'll be out for the station, then.

Ritsu:
Mio and I are going by bus.

Mio:
You said that you're walking home, right, Yui?

Yui:
Mm-hm.

Tsumugi:
Tomorrow, let's...

Yui:
Yeah! Let's eat some more those great sweets!

Tsumugi:
I was going to say, "Tomorrow, let's all work hard again."

Yui:
Yeah...

Ritsu:
You better watch it!

Yui:
But if they'll just go to waste then...

Ritsu:
Watch it! Watch it!
Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it.

Mio:
It is an occupational sickness...

Yui:
Bye, see ya!

Ritsu:
Sure!

Mio:
Bye!

Tsumugi:
See you tomorrow!

Yui:
Hey, guys!
Thanks for everything, I mean it!
I promise, when I finally get my guitar, I'm gonna practice every day!


Woman:
Thank you for two days of hard work.

Everyone:
Ma'am, the pleasure was all ours!

Mio:
Here.

Ritsu:
So, $80 per day, huh?

Tsumugi:
Even with the $500 advance your mother gave you, that's still nowhere near enough.

Mio:
Guess we have to work a few more jobs, then.

Tsumugi:
You're right, Miss Mio.

Ritsu:
Okay. Guess I'll hit the want ads again.

Mio:
Right.

Yui:
I just can't take this money from you.
Please, I want you to spend the money that you earned on yourselves.

Tsumugi:
But, Yui...

Yui:
I'll buy myself a guitar all on my own.

Ritsu:
Yui...

Yui:
I wanna get a guitar and start practicing right away so I can play with you guys.
Would you mind going out to the music store with me again tomorrow?

Everyone:
Mm-hm.

Yui:
Thanks for everything, guys.
I'd better go home now.

Mio:
See you tomorrow, Yui.

Tsumugi:
Good bye.

Yui:
Bye, guys.

I have to get good fast for me and for them.

Tsumugi:
Well, I'd best be heading home, too.

Ritsu, Mio:
Mm-hm.

Tsumugi:
Huh?

Ritsu:
Oh, man, I think Yui's losing it.


Mio:
She really wants that badly.

Ritsu:
Okay, then let's get another job!

Tsumugi:
Oh... Wait right here, okay?

Hi, excuse me.

Staff:
Yes?

Tsumugi:
Would you mind terribly if I haggled?

Staff:
Huh?

Tsumugi:
Could you see your way to lowering the price on a guitar?

Staff:
Uh... Ah!
Y-You're the company president's daughter!

Perhaps... I could go this low?

Tsumugi:
No, try again!

He says that he will sell you this guitar for $500.

Yui:
Ah!

Ritsu:
Serious?

Yui:
What?! What did you say to him?

Tsumugi:
The thing is, this store is my family's business consortium.

Everyone:
Oh.

Yui:
Really, is that so? Wow...
Mugi, I don't know how to thank you.
I'll pay you back the rest, I promise!

It's so cute!
Bowrrm!
Oh, I look like a rocker!
Oh, I gotta practice signing my autograph!
Hm?

Ui:
Big Sis, could you keep it down...

Hey Sis, if you don't get up soon, you'll be late for school!
Big Sister?
Uh...
She slept with it...


Ritsu:
Awesome!

Mio:
Wow, the guitar looks like it belongs on you.

Ritsu:
Try playing something!

Mio:
You really haven't practiced at all yet, have you?

Yui:
Well, the guitar is all bright and shiny and new and everything.
And I guess I'm just a little scared to touch it.

Mio:
Yeah, I can totally relate to that.

Yui:
I posed in front of the mirror with it, and took a lot of pictures of it, and slept all night with it, though.

Ritsu:
So, play it.

Mio:
You haven't even taken the film off of it yet.

Ritsu:
Ahaha!
I couldn't help myself!

Yui:
Ah!

Mio:
Ritsu, apologize!

Ritsu:
I'm sorry!
I acted on impulse!
Please forgive me!

Tsumugi:
Here, why don't you have a snack.

Mio:
Oh, something like that won't...
It made her feel better!

Yui:
No, you're right.
The purpose of guitar is to be played by someone.
And so it's not right to just sit and admire it and never use it.
Thanks for that, Ritsu.
I really needed that motivation.

Ritsu:
It was?!
Well, I was kinda hoping it would give you the urge to practice...
Boy, I'm good... Ow!

Mio:
So, shall we practice, then?

Yui:
How do I get the guitar to sound like they're doing in a concert?

Mio:
You just gotta hook it up to an amp.

Ritsu:
Ready!

Yui:
That was awesome!

Mio:
It's finally started.

Ritsu:
We've got our Light Music Club.

Tsumugi:
Indeed.

Ritsu:
All right, Budokan, here we come!
By the time we graduate!

Yui:
I'm sorry. That's all I can play right now.
I guess I should learn a lot more before I try playing with an amp.

Mio:
Ah, be careful!

Yui:
Huh?

Mio:
That's what happens when you pull off the guitar cord before you turn the amp all the way down.

Yui:
You should've said something sooner...


-- Preview --

Yui:
Ah! We've got midterm exams?!

Nodoka:
Is that a chord too?

Ritsu:
I don't get it, Yui.
Why didn't you study?

Yui:
Oh, I really had planned to, but I... come on, when you study for a test, don't you ever end up fixating on everything but studying?

Oh, look at that! It's sweet bean jelly!
