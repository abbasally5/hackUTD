  Yui:
Okay...
A little further...

Ui:
Sis, you sure can do this?

Yui:
I can do it!

Yui:
All done!

Yui:
See, I wonder if Santa's gonna come this year.
I'd forget to do my homework and wouldn't finish my lunch sometimes...
I haven't been very good, so I'm afraid maybe he won't come.
May I get presents.

Ui:
It will be okay, Sis I know it.
Santa will bring you lots and lots of presents, you see.

Yui:
I think you should try making a wish, too, Ui!

Ui:
May there be a White Christmas this year!

Yui:
Um, what's a White Christmas?

Ui:
It's a Christmas morning when snow has fallen and made everything really pretty and white!

Yui:
Ui! Ui!
Hurry! Hurry!

Ui:
Sis, wait up!

Yui:
Ta-dah!

Yui:
It's a White Christmas!

Ui:
Big Sis, what is this?

Yui:
It's stuffing from a cushion!

Ui:
Our parents scolded Sis really badly that day.

Yui:
Ui, what's so funny?

Ui:
I really hope we'll have another fun Christmas together this year!


--OP--


Ui:
It sure has gotten cold.

Yui:
Ui, shouldn't you be wearing your scarf?

Ui:
Mm-hm, but I guess it blew away when I washed it and hung it out to dry last year.

Ui:
Thank you, Big Sis.

Yui:
Nice and warm, nice and warm.

Ui:
Hey, what happened to your other mitten?

Yui:
I lost it somewhere.

Yui:
Nice and warm, nice and warm.


-- #7: Christmas! --


Ritsu:
Check it out!
I made a flyer for our Christmas party!

Mio:
Huh?
We decided that we were gonna have a Christmas party?

Ritsu:
I did.
But I didn't tell anyone.

Mio:
You should have!
The date: December 24th Christmas Eve.
The place: Mugi's house.
Cover charge: ten dollars.
Huh?

Tsumugi:
Sorry, that really isn't a good day for our house.

Ritsu:
Yeah, I was kind of afraid of that.

Tsumugi:
The schedule at our house is always packed this time of year.
You have to make arrangements at least a full month in advance.
I'm truly sorry.

Mio:
R-Really you don't say.

Yui, Mio:
That's some house.

Tsumugi:
Ritsu, what about your house?

Mio:
No! No, forget that.
Ritsu's place is so messy there's nowhere for you to stand.

Ritsu:
Excuse me?!
You're one to talk.
Your room has dirty clothes tossed everywhere.
Even panties.

Mio:
Hey, don't make up garbage about me!

Ritsu:
I have plenty of pictures as proof.

Mio:
You big liar!

Ritsu:
It's the absolute truth!

Mio:
Pan pastries... Pun-tease?!

Ritsu:
More where that came from!

Mio:
Stop it! Please, stop it!

Tsumugi:
Hey, Yui, how about your house.

Yui:
I don't see why not.

Ritsu:
Yeah! Score!

Mio:
But are you sure it'll be okay for a big group to come over on Christmas Eve?

Yui:
Mm-hm.
Mom and dad are both gonna be away on vacation that day.

Ritsu:
Hey, they were gone when we were there last time, too.

Yui:
Yeah, they like to travel a lot together.
They said they're going to Germany this year.

Yui's parents:
Ahahahahaha, ahahahaha.
Wee!

Mio:
What a lovey-dovey couple!

Tsumugi:
Is there anything that the three of us can bring?

Yui:
Just leave all the food to me!

Ritsu:
Are you sure about that?

Yui:
Yeah, no problem!
'Cause Ui will be making at all.

Mio:
Good thing she has such a mature sister.

Ritsu:
Oh, that's right!
There's one more thing.
Let's have a present exchange!

Yui:
Yeah! Let's do it!

Tsumugi:
Great idea!

Ritsu:
Don't bring anything weird, Mio, okay?

Mio:
Huh?
That's what you do.
Like that time back in grade school.

Yui:
One-trick pony.

Ritsu:
Oh! What? Are you some kind of comedian?

Yui:
No, are you?

Tsumugi:
I can't wait! Christmas party.

Ritsu:
Do you wanna come to the Light Music Club Christmas party, Nodoka?

Nodoka:
Uh, are you sure?
I'm not a club member.

Ritsu:
Don't worry.
It's fine.
I mean we're all friends here after all.

Ritsu:
The more people that come to the party, the more money we'll have to spend.

Mio:
What are you planning on doing with it.

Yui:
Can you come, Nodoka-chan?

Nodoka:
Mm-hm.

Yui:
Yay!


Yui:
So that's the whole deal.
I hope we can count on you.
Of course, I'll be chipping in and help out.

Ui:
Just leave everything to me.
But, uh... If she hurt herself helping me, that would be terrible.

Ui:
I would like you to handle the decorations, please?

Yui:
Roger that, ma'am!

Ui:
What are you gonna do at your Christmas party, anyway?

Yui:
Eat cake, trade presents...
You know, all like Christmassy kind of stuff.
Also each of us will do a party trick!

Ui:
Party tricks, huh?
I wonder what I should do?

Yui:
Oh wow, you're really giving it a lot of thought.

Ui:
Don't worry, I'm sure I'll think of something.

Yui:
Mm-hm.

Ui:
And I'm gonna have to go and get a present, too.

Yui:
Oh, you're right.
I'll have to go buy one, too!


Yui:
What do you think would be good?
Ah, this is so cute!
Oh, Nodoka-chan, I really really want this!

Nodoka:
You know, normally you have to go again if you draw your own name.

Yui:
Guess I'll go with this, then.

Nodoka:
Uh...

Mio:
Ritsu, made up your mind yet?

Ritsu:
How's this?

Mio:
Eeek!
A-Absolutely not!

Ritsu:
How about this, then?

Mio:
Eeek!

Ritsu:
Or how about this?!
Ow!

Mio:
Why do you always try to get stuff like that?!

Yui:
Yes, I finally decided!

Ritsu:
Oh, hey, you guys!
You came to do a little gift shopping, too, huh?

Yui:
So, what did you buy?

Mio:
Well, if we told you that, it would just spoil all of the fun.

Yui:
Guess you're right.

Ritsu:
Oh, hey, ta-da! ta-da! ta-dah!
We're on our way over to the raffle drawing.

Yui:
Really, so are we!

Ritsu:
Come to mama.
I won more tissues?

Woman:
We have a winner!
Our top prize!
Here you go.
Congratulations!

Yui:
Mugi-chan?

Tsumugi:
You're all out shopping, too?

Ritsu:
Did you just win?

Tsumugi:
Mm-hm.
A trip to Hawaii, I think.

Mio:
What is it with her amazing luck?!

Tsumugi:
But I turned the prize down.

Ritsu:
Why?!

Tsumugi:
I wanted this instead.
So I asked them to exchange it.
We should all play it together on Christmas.

Everyone:
Mm-hm.

Ui:
Now then, what should I make?
And what trick should I do?


-- eye-catch --


Ui:
Big Sis, what happened here?

Yui:
Ui...

Ui:
I thought you were cleaning the place up.

Yui:
I couldn't help myself.
Oh, those look delicious!

Ui:
Hey, don't eat those, Big Sis.

Yui:
Don't worry. I won't sneak any bites!

Yui:
I said I wouldn't!


Ui:
It's like we're playing "Red light, green light" or something.
Come on, Sis, stop fooling around.
You haven't done any decorating at all yet, so you'd better hurry.

Yui:
Snip, snip!

Ui:
You mean you're just getting started?!

Tsumugi, Mio, Ritsu:
Merry Christmas!

Ui:
Come in!

Ritsu:
Hey-yo! Yui, we're here!

Yui:
Hi, everyone! Come on in!

Ritsu:
What are you doing?

Yui:
I couldn't bring myself to stop once I got started.

Ritsu:
What are you, a grade schooler?

Ui:
Oh, here, let me take your coats.

Ritsu:
Oh, right.
Thanks a lot, Ui.

Mio:
A hard working little sister, and a goofball big sister...
It's the perfect setup for a sad soap opera.

Ritsu:
Wow, this food is amazing!
You made all this, Ui-chan?

Yui:
Don't be rude!
I made some, too!
Look at this cake!

Ritsu:
That's awesome!

Yui:
I put all the strawberries on top!

Ritsu:
Hey, return the "Awesome!" I just said!

Yui:
Not right?

Ui:
Um, well, Big Sis worked really hard on all sort of things today.
For instance, she tried to clean the house and tried to put up the decorations.
And she... Um...

Mio:
She's really trying to stand up for her.

Ritsu:
We get it.
We're sorry.

Yui:
Nodoka-chan says that she's going to be late.
So, let's go ahead and have a toast!

Ui:
Mm-hm.

Mio:
The airhead older sister and the admirable little sister...

Ritsu:
I suppose that's got to make for a pretty good team.

Everyone:
Cheers!

Ritsu:
Oh, wow, that's yet another year done and gone!

Sawako:
Sheesh, you sound like an old man.

Ritsu:
Miss. Yamanaka?!

Sawako:
These are delicious.
Can I have another helping?

Everyone:
When did she get here?!

Ritsu:
Don't tell me she climbed in with a rope!

Mio:
And then she snuck in.

Ritsu:
Through an open window?!

Sawako:
Not really.
Who do you think I am, anyway?
Honestly, what sort of club forgets to invite their faculty advisor?

Ritsu:
Um, well, "forget" isn't exactly what I call it.

Yui:
We didn't ask you because we assumed you had plans with your boyfriend.

Sawako:
How dare you say that!
How dare you say that!
How dare you say that!

Ritsu:
Foolish types are scary.

Ritsu:
For punishment, I want you to change into this, Yui.

Yui:
Huh? Why in the world would you bring something like that with you?

Yui:
Ta-dah!

Sawako:
Not working. You're just not feeling quite enough shame.

Sawako:
Yes, this calls for...

Mio:
Eek!

Sawako:
There's no escape!

Mio:
Eeeeek!

Sawako:
Come back here!

Mio:
No!

Nodoka:
Hello.

Sawako:
Quit your struggling!

Nodoka:
I'm sorry. I have the wrong house.

Mio:
It's the right house! Help me!

Mio:
No one will ever wanna marry me now...


Ui:
High schoolers sure lead amazing lives.


Ritsu:
To get this party back on track, I think we should have our gift exchange!

Yui:
Yeah!

Ui:
High schoolers change moods at the drop of a hat!

Nodoka:
But what about you, ma'am?

Sawako:
Oh, don't worry.
I brought something, too.
To be honest, I had planned to give this present to my boyfriend today, if we were still together.

Everyone:
Way to drag us down...

Sawako:
All right, then, let's get started, guys!

Ritsu:
Uh, sure...

Sawako:
The one you have when the song ends is yours.
Here.
Jingle bells! Here!
Jingle bells! Here you go! Jingle all the way...

Ritsu:
It's like she's losing it.

Yui:
Aren't Christmas gift exchanges supposed to be more fun than this?

Mio:
No one will ever wanna marry me...

Sawako:
Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way...

Ui:
I'm getting dizzy...

Tsumugi:
This may be the most exciting Christmas I've ever had!

Sawako:
That's all!

Ritsu:
Um, this is the one that I brought to the party.

Sawako:
Oh, no problem. We'll trade!

Mio:
Miss. Yamanaka!

Sawako:
Ah, something is telling me that whatever is inside here is amazing!
Oh, let's see what we have!

Sawako:
Oh, yeah!
This is the best Christmas I've ever had!

Ritsu:
Ow, she's gone crazy!

Nodoka:
Stay calm, everyone.

Ritsu:
I'm sorry. I'll never do it again!

Yui:
I'm sure something good is in store for you!

Mio:
Oh, that's the present that I brought to the party.

Nodoka:
Oh, that's from me.

Yui:
Nodoka, it's Christmas, not year-end.

Yui:
Wow, these look tasty. You're so lucky...

Mio:
Eek!

Sawako:
Oh yes, that's the one that I brought.

Yui:
Wait a minute!
You were gonna give that to your boyfriend for Christmas?

Sawako:
I was!
So pardon me for breathing!

Mio:
Foolish types are scary...

Tsumugi:
I think the only ones who haven't opened their presents are Yui-chan and Ui-chan right?

Sawako:
Would you hurry up and open now.

Yui, Ui:
Y-Yes, ma'am!

Yui:
Oh, I got that because you lost your scarf!
Ui:
Oh, I got that because I remembered that you lost your mitten!

Mio:
I'm just wondering what are you two would've done if you hadn't ended up with each other's presents?

Tsumugi:
So sweet!

Yui:
Thank you, Ui!

Ui:
Mm, and thank you very much, Big Sis.
Winter will seem almost warm when I wear it.

Ritsu:
Right! Now, it's time for each of us to do a party trick!

Mio:
Way to ruin a perfectly good moment, Ritsu...

Ritsu:
Hey, you wanna go first, Mio?

Nodoka:
Uh, she's pretty [old-school].

Ritsu:
Yui, then!

Yui:
Who, me? I'm not...

Ui:
I'll go! I'd like to go first!

Yui:
What? Really?

Ui:
Hello, everyone!
Merry Christmas!
Is everyone having a good time?
I'm sorry, this is all that I can do.

Ritsu:
Did you practice?

Ui:
I did!
Big Sis said that we would be having a talent contest today.

Yui:
Huh? You thought I was serious?

Ui:
You mean you weren't?

Yui:
I'm sorry, Ui...

Ui:
[Don't care it/Dokey]. Don't worry about it.

Yui:
Now I'll go!
Air guitar!

Ritsu:
Yeah, then I'll play air drums!

Yui:
Mio-chan really pushed herself.

Tsumugi:
I'll do an impression!

Ritsu:
W-What's that?

Tsumugi:
My impression of a sunfish!

Sawako:
Okay, now, I'm going next!
A maple leaf!

Nodoka:
Who is this women, and what did she do with my sweet Miss. Yamanaka?

Everyone:
Thank you for having us over!

Yui:
Boy, it sure is cold, Ui...

Ui:
Look! It's snow!

Yui:
Wow, you're right!
It looks like we're gonna have a White Christmas!

Ui:
You know, Sis, you once gave me a White Christmas as a present and I loved it.
You remember?

Yui:
Huh?

Ui:
Today sure was fun...

Yui:
Ui...
Ui, can I come in?

Ui:
Big Sis?

Yui:
You mind if I sleep with you?

Ui:
Mm-hm.

Yui:
I'm gonna wear these to bed tonight.
'Cause they're so warm.

Ui:
Then maybe I'll wear my brand new scarf to bed.
'Cause it's warm, too.

Ui:
Achoo.
Come on, Big Sis, I'm freezing.


Ui:
Hey, I'm gonna start dusting, Big Sis.
You wanna help?

Ui:
Here's your New Year's Eve noodles.

Ui:
You said two mochi with your soup, right?

Yui:
Uh-huh.

Ui:
I peeled some tangerines.

Yui:
And that's how I spent my holiday.

Ritsu:
Give me Ui-chan!

Tsumugi:
Those two are quite a pair, aren't they?

Ritsu:
But won't you get fat, doing nothing but eating and sleeping?

Yui:
Oh, no.
I never ever gain weight no matter how much I eat.

Mio:
No way!
Tsumugi:
That can't be!

Yui:
You, too, Mugi-chan?

Mio:
Mugi, how much weight did you put on?

Tsumugi:
...pounds.

Mio:
I gained ...pounds.

Ritsu:
Just to be safe, you should apologize.

Yui:
I'm so sorry.
Mio-chan, you dressed up really nice today!

Mio:
Just 'cause Ritsu asked me if I was going to.

Ritsu:
I was just asking!

Mio:
Wha-What?!

Yui:
I guess things won't be much different this year, huh, Mio-chan?

Mio:
I'm gonna go change!

Yui:
Wait! You should keep them on!
You look cute!

Mio:
Uh, think so?

Yui:
I sure do!

Tsumugi:
Oh, now I'm seeing something amazing this year, too!

Ritsu:
You haven't changed one bit, either.

Ritsu:
Miss. Yamanaka?

woman:
Wow, look at this!

Ritsu:
Looks like she hasn't changed, either.


Ritsu:
So, what did you guys pray for?

Tsumugi:
For my family's health and safety.

Mio:
I asked for help loosing weight.

Yui:
I asked to be able to eat lots'n lots of yummy food!

Ritsu:
Hey, we should all pray for the Light Music Club, too.

Mio:
May we all get better at playing our music.

Tsumugi:
May we all continue to have lots of fun together.

Yui:
May we all be able to eat lots of the great cakes that Mugi-chan brings to the... Ow!
May I become more proficient at the guitar.

Ritsu:
Right!

Yui:
Wanna grab something to eat on the way home?

Tsumugi:
Please don't talk about food!

Mio:
You really never gain any weight, Yui?


-- Preview --

Mio:
We're the Light Music Club...

Ritsu:
If you ever get lonely, come over to visit whenever you want!

Mio:
What am I, a grade schooler?

Yui:
Welcome to our club room!

Ritsu:
Come in, come in, it's so good to see you! Welcome to our club!

Ui:
First, could you explain what that was?

Sawako:
You two...

Yui:
Ui!

Tsumugi:
In any event, we'll be performing four songs tomorrow.
So, be sure to come.

Mio:
I'm lonely...
