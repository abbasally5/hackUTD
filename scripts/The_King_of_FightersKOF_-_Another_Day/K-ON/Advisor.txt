  Yui:
Hey, Ritchan.

Ritsu:
Hey there, Yui.

Yui:
Ugh... so hot...
Huh? What's that you're looking at?

Ritsu:
I found something interesting.
Here, check it out.

Yui:
Wow, what's with these pictures?

Ritsu:
They were in a cardboard box that Mio found earlier.
They are pictures of a past Light Music Club.

Yui:
Wow, these are amazing!

Ritsu:
They've got that look every band has no matter when in history they played.

Yui:
Y-Yeah, I guess you're right.
Say the word "band," and this used to be the only image that popped into my head.

-- OP --

Mio:
Maybe we can just try changing this a little bit.

Ritsu:
Hmm...

Yui:
Ow!

Ritsu:
What happened?

Yui:
I scraped the skin off my finger.

Ritsu:
Wow, that looks painful.

Yui:
You, too, Mio! Look at my finger!

Ritsu, Yui:
Huh?

Mio:
I'm not looking, I'm not listening.
I'm not looking, I'm not listening.
I'm not looking, I'm not listening.
I'm not looking, I'm not listening.

Ritsu:
Am I hurt!
I've been practicing drums too much, the blisters on my hand broke open!
Hahaha...
Take a look! It's gross! Disgusting! Boo! Check it out! [Ziping] (xxx)! You! In your face! Dah! Near you! That's it! Lookit! You! Ha-ha! There!

Yui:
Ritchan, do we have any adhesive bandages here?

Sawako:
Don't mind me.
I just need to borrow these music stands. Huh?

-- #5: Advisor! --

Teacher:
Would the two of you mind carrying these notebooks for me?

Tsumugi:
Thank you very much for all your help.

Yui:
Ow!

Tsumugi:
Huh?

Yui:
The antiseptic is really stinging!

Sawako:
I know.
All right, hold your finger still just like that.

Yui:
What a tidy desk...

Sawako:
Done. There, that should do it.

Yui:
Thanks for your help, Miss Yamanaka.

Sawako:
Let's see the others.

Yui:
Um...

Sawako:
Well, you have a ways to go.
The way you skin is right now, it's going to peel off soon.

Yui:
Huh?

Sawako:
Your skin will get tougher each time this happens and you'll become a better player in the process.
It's a guitarist's rite of passage.

Yui:
Oh, it is?
Wait a sec!
Did you used to play guitar, Miss Yamanaka?

Sawako:
Not me.
But I have some friends who did.

Yui:
Mm...

Sawako:
Oh, very good work today.

Teacher:
You too.

Sawako:
See you later.

Yui:
Yes.

Sawako:
Hey, would you like some tea?

Teacher:
Yeah, thanks.

Yui:
What a nice teacher...
Hm? Mugi-chan!

Tsumugi:
Ah.

Yui:
Mugi-chan, is something the matter?

Tsumugi:
No, I, um... I was just thinking how pretty she was.

Yui:
Oh, you mean Miss Yamanaka?
By the way, where have you been?

Tsumugi:
Ah, well you see, I was asked by Mio to go find out if the Light Music Club could use the stage when we play at the school festival.
But I'm afraid they turned our request down because they said we weren't recognized as a legitimate club yet.

Yui:
Oh, that's nice.

Hm? Eh?

Ritsu:
We're not recognized as a legitimate club?!

Tsumugi:
No, apparently we're not.

Yui:
I thought, in order to be official, we just needed to have four members.

Ritsu:
Yeah, Yui, that's what I thought, too.

Yui:
You know I was thinking, if we're not recognized as an official club, is it okay that we've been hogging the Music Room to ourselves?

Ritsu:
Look, nobody's said anything about it to us so far, so I'm sure it's okay. I think.
More importantly, I'd better go and ask them why we're not recognized.

Tsumugi:
Yes, you should.

Ritsu:
Oh, hey, what happened to Mio?

Yui:
Oh, if you're looking for Mio, she's still huddled in terror over there.

Ritsu:
Would you come back here?!


Yui:
Greetings, all!

Ritsu:
I'm Club President!

Nodoka:
Oh, Yui?

Yui:
Nodoka-chan?
Wow, Nodoka-chan, what're you doing here?

Nodoka:
What do you mean?
I'm here because I'm on the student council.

Yui:
Oh, that's amazing! That's my Nodoka-chan!

Ritsu:
So you two are really childhood friends?

Nodoka:
Well, sorry. But you don't seem to be on the list...

Yui:
Oh, no. You're kidding!

Ritsu:
No, don't tell me...

Yui:
Ritchan! Does this raise any theories?

Ritsu:
Yes. What this appears to be... is a sinister plot by the student council to drive weak clubs to be disbanded!

Yui:
I know you're really a pure-hearted person, Nodoka-chan!
Please snap out of it!

Nodoka:
What're are you talking about?
Maybe you just didn't submit a club activities application form?

Tsumugi:
Club activities application?

Ritsu:
It's the first I've heard this form!

Mio:
No, it's not!

Ritsu:
Yes. That was... back in spring.

I'm Club President, so I'll fill it out!

Mio:
Are you sure, Ritsu?

Tsumugi:
Excuse me, I brought a big pound cake with me today.

Ritsu:
Ooh, let's dig in!

Mio:
Hey, Ritsu, wait!

Ritsu:
Mm, I know, I know, Mio!
I'll fill it out just as soon as we finish eating!
I'll fill it out just as soon as we finish eating!
...finish eating...
...finish eating...

Mio:
I know this, this is all your fault!
You're (here) putting things off !

Tsumugi:
Oh, dear. Mio, it's not like she did it deliberately.

Mio:
You're too soft on her, Mugi!

Tsumugi:
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now...

Nodoka:
How to put this... I think you're a perfect fit for the Light Music Club, Yui.

Oh well, all right, Yui. I'll see what I can do for you.

Yui:
Well..

Everybody:
You will?!

Nodoka:
Name, Light Music Club...
Membership, four.
Who's your advisor?

Everyone:
Advisor?

Nodoka:
You don't have one?


Ritsu:
Sawako Yamanaka.
Our fair school's music teacher.
As a result of her beautiful features and gentle demeanor, she is popular with not only the student body, but also the school staff.
Plus, her skill with instruments and her singing voice are remarkable.

Sawako:
What?

Ritsu:
She is popular enough to have her own fan club.

Sawako:
What have you been going on about?
Hello, girls...

Everyone:
Teacher!

Sawako:
What is it?

Ritsu:
Please agree to be the Light Music Club's advisor!

Sawako:
Oh, I see, you don't have an advisor yet...

Mio:
Miss Yamanaka, you're the only teacher that we can turn to.

Tsumugi:
Oh, please do it.

Sawako:
I'm so sorry.
I wish that I could be your advisor, I really do.
But I'm already the school band's advisor, so there's no way I could handle another.

Yui:
You're kidding...

Sawako:
I really am sorry about this.

Ritsu:
She's so desirable that she's been courted by countless men.

Sawako:
Ah, Look, flattery isn't going to change anything!

Mio:
We won't take up any of your time!

Tsumugi:
That's right, because we always practice on our own!

Ritsu:
Just write your name here and give it your official stamp!
Simple, huh?

Sawako:
J-Just wait a sec!

Yui:
Stare...
Miss Yamanaka, you graduated from here, didn't you?

Sawako:
Well, yes...

Yui:
We were looking through an old Light Music Club photo album earlier.

Mio:
Is something the matter with you?

Sawako:
Um, so where is that album right now?

Yui:
Um, well, it's in our club room.

Sawako:
I see.

Yui:
Miss Yamanaka?

Sawako:
I would never have suspected that the last copy was being kept right here in the school.
That book contains a chapter of my bloody past that must never come to light.
A spawn of the devil that must never be awakened!
A forbidden book never to be seen!
A locked doorway that must never be opened!
It's... It's... It's...
At last, it's over.

Ritsu:
I knew it, that WAS you, Miss Yamanaka.

Yui:
You were this girl, weren't you?

Sawako:
Well played, if you've found me out.
It's true, I was once a Light Music Club member.

Tsumugi:
I never suspected!

Yui:
Does that mean that this is you?

Death Devil(Sawako):
I've been waiting for you people to arrive! Now DIE!

Sawako:
Stop it! I'm so ashamed!

Mio:
I'm not listening, I'm not listening...

Ritsu:
You're still dragging out that shtick?

Tsumugi:
You were playing guitar, too?

Yui:
Hey, right!
Play something!
Don't be shy!

Sawako:
I can't! I can't!
The characteristic weight of a Les Paul's mahogany and maple...
This dulcet tone, full of sweetly distorted harmonics from its humbucker pickup...

Yui:
Miss Yamanaka?

Sawako:
Ha ha ha.
What the hell...

Everyone:
Her expression's changed!

Mio:
She's shredding!

Tsumugi:
She's tapping!

Ritsu:
She's Hendrix-ing!

Yui:
Oh, no. My poor little guitar!

Sawako:
You sucks.
You've been using the Music Room like it was yours!

Everyone:
We're so sorry!

Sawako:
In the first place, you [far/fool]...!

Did you all see that?

Everyone:
Uh-huh.

Sawako:
I swore to myself I'd put on a ladylike front when I became a teacher...

Ritsu:
Yeah, but Miss...

Sawako:
All of this began eight long years ago...

Ritsu:
Why is she narrating all of a sudden?!

Sawako:
I was...

-- Eye Catch --

Sawako:
I was... in love.

I love you.

Guy:
I'm sorry.
But I like girls with more of a wild streak in them.

Sawako:
And so I made up my mind.
That I would become the girl of his dreams.
I would be wilder.
Wilder! Wilder! Ever wilder!
More! More! More!
Wilder! Wilder! Wilder!

I'll go out with you if you want!

Guy:
Sawako...
You took it too far.

Sawako:
I guess that's how it always ends, huh?

Yui:
You okay?

Sawako:
Please, spare me your words of comfort...

Ritsu:
Teacher, please lift up your eyes.

Sawako:
Oh, Ritchan!

Ritsu:
If you don't want this getting out, you will be our club advisor.

Yui:
Ritchan, you're so resolute!
Hm? Mugi-chan?

Mio:
What's wrong?

Yui:
I dunno, it's Mugi-chan...

Mio:
Mugi!

Yui:
Are you feeling okay?
You look like you're kind of spacing out.


Mio:
And that's a brand-new original piece we've been working on.

Sawako:
Hmm...

Ritsu:
As our advisor, what's your opinion?

Sawako:
I have some concerns, such as the intro and outro, and the way your rhythm section is all over the place, and total lack of any cohesive hook.
But, don't you guys have a singer?

Wait, you haven't written any lyrics yet, either, have you?

Yui:
Well, I guess we just...

Sawako:
You've got a lot of guts, thinking you could perform at the school festival in this state...

Mio:
We're sorry, ma'am.

Sawako:
What have you been doing every time you've been hogging the music room?!
It's not a place to sit around and sip tea!

Yui:
We made her mad!

Sawako:
For one thing!

Tsumugi:
Teacher!
W-Would you care for some yummy cake?



Sawako:
Yes, I would!

Everyone:
She would?!


Mio:
Let's see...
We should've started with the lyrics first.
Mugi?

Tsumugi:
Now that Miss Yamanaka has become our advisor, my heart is pounding for some reason.
Good luck to the lyrics.

Mio:
My heart is pounding...?
Nah, no way...


Everyone:
They're done?!

Mio:
Yeah, all done.

Yui:
Show us, show us!

Mio:
Already?!

Ritsu:
Yes, already!

Tsumugi:
I would love to see them, too!

Mio:
But... But I'm embarrassed to show them to you...

Yui:
Come on, Mio-chan. No one is gonna laugh.

Ritsu:
Yeah, yeah!

Mio:
But I... Wait a minute!

Ritsu:
We can't wait!
If you brought them, that means you're ready to show them to us, right?!

Tsumugi:
Mio, come on, please!

Yui:
You can give me a little peek!
Just one little peek!

Ritsu:
No fair!
If anybody's going to see them, I'm gonna be first!

Yui:
Why you?

Ritsu:
Why? Because I'm Club President, that's why!

Yui:
What? Then I'm Mio-chan's soulmate!
So I can see them first, so there!

Tsumugi:
Well then, I'm Mio-chan's soulmate #2 and I get to see them next!

Ritsu:
You got a lot of gall, I am the place that Mio's soul calls home, right?

Mio:
Since when?

Yui:
Oh, I wonder how my granny who lives out in the country is doing?

Ritsu:
That's got nothing to do with this.

Mio:
Did I send mine a New Year's card last year?

Ritsu:
Don't change the subject!

Sawako:
Let's see the damn thing!

Ritsu:
Ooh, let me see!

Ritsu:
Mio, I'm all itchy

Sawako:
I wanna tear this up!

Mio:
I think that considering how fast I did it, it turned out pretty well...
Do you really think that it's no good?

Sawako:
"No good" might be a little strong...

Ritsu:
Yeah, more like it doesn't quite fit the image that we were trying to create.
C'mon, Yui, you haven't said anything.
What do you think?

Yui:
It was so awesome...

Ritsu:
Seriously?!

Yui:
I love these lyrics, I think they're just wonderful!

Mio:
Y-You mean it?

Ritsu:
Hey, what do you think about the lyrics, Mugi?
She's totally enchanted!
Mugi, you aren't seriously telling me that you like them.

Tsumugi:
I do...

Ritsu:
Uh, you think these lyrics work?

Tsumugi:
I do...

Ritsu:
Seriously?

Tsumugi:
Je nais.

Ritsu:
For real?

Tsumugi:
Yes. Bring it on.

Ritsu:
S-Sawako!

Sawako:
Sawako?

Ritsu:
You think these lyrics are unworkable, right?

Sawako:
W-Why, yes!
I suppose they're not!

Ritsu:
See, I'm right.
Come on, you three, let's rethink our approach, okay?
Let's take a deep breath and...

Sawako:
Wait a minute...
Maybe I can give my image a boost by saying I like this perky, sappy crap.

Mio:
You're young at heart, Miss Yamanaka!

Tsumugi:
That's our Miss Yamanaka!

Yui:
It's Miss Yamanaka or no one!

Everyone:
Yamanaka! Yamanaka! Yamanaka! Yamanaka!

Sawako:
You know now that I think about it, I guess I really like this lyrics, too!

Ritsu:
Say what?!

Ritsu:
Well, I suppose we're going with these lyrics, then.

Everyone:
Yay!

Yui:
Isn't this wonderful, Mio-chan?

Mio:
Um, yeah...

Ritsu:
That means, we'll be going with Mio on vocals.

Mio:
Huh? N-No, I couldn't!

Ritsu:
Why not?

Mio:
Well, I, uh...
Because I...
Because I can't sing such embarrassing lyrics, that's why!

Ritsu:
Hey, you wrote 'em, lady!

Sawako:
This is gonna be a problem.

Ritsu:
Well, I guess that leaves us with...

Yui:
Uh...

Ritsu:
Mugi, wanna try?

Tsumugi:
I would.
But I already have my hands full just managing the keyboard.

Ritsu:
Um... Okay, then...

Yui:
hehe.

Ritsu:
I guess not.

Yui:
Ahem.

Ritsu:
Yui, you wanna try?

Yui:
You're asking me?!
But I'm not really a good singer, you know, so I don't know if I'd be the best choice for us, so I'm not sure if I should even try to do it.

Ritsu:
Never mind, then.

Yui:
I'm sorry, I lied!
I'll sing! I wanna sing!
You gotta let me try it!

Ritsu:
Okay then, sing something.

Yui:
Roger!

(song)

Ritsu:
Hold it, hold it!
You'll have to sing while you're playing the guitar!

Yui:
Oh yeah, you're right. I totally forgot.

Mio:
Oh, geez.

Yui:
Okay...

Everyone:
This time she's forgetting to sing when she plays!


Yui:
I can't sing and play guitar at the same time!
I can't...

Sawako:
I guess I have no choice.
I'll have to give you special training.

Yui:
Really?

Sawako:
First thing I'm gonna show you is how to Hendrix...

Yui:
That's all right.

Mio:
Huh?

Sawako:
Okay, do your best and try to keep up with me!

Yui:
Roger!

Mio:
Ritsu...

Ritsu:
What is it?

Mio:
You don't think that Mugi has a thing for Miss Yamanaka, do you?

Ritsu:
Come again?

Mio:
What I'm trying to ask is, think she's got a crush on her?

Ritsu:
What, seriously?

Mugi! I was wondering, do you like Miss Yamanaka?

Mio:
Hey, Ritsu!
You moron!

Tsumugi:
Oh, no. I was just... I was thinking how nice it is when it's just girls hanging out.

Ritsu:
What? No way!

Mio:
Oh well, good for you.

Ritsu:
Wait! So you're okay with it?

Tsumugi:
If the people involved are happy, that's all that really matters, right?

Mio:
Well, um...

Ritsu:
What are we talking about here?


Nodoka:
All right, then.
Yui will be providing vocals, and the set list will be "Fuwa Fuwa Time."
Okay, I'll get in touch with you again once your time slot has been assigned.

Tsumugi:
Thank goodness and thank you for coming here in person to tell us.

Nodoka:
It's all part of a student council member's duties.
But, are you really sure you wanna go with Yui on the vocals?

Ritsu:
She's been getting intensive lessons from Miss Yamanaka after school since last week.

Mio:
We think that she'll have her whipped into shape in time.

Sawako:
Sorry to keep you waiting.
She's perfect.
Now, Yui, girl. Show 'em what you've got!

Ritsu:
She's awesome!

Mio:
She's a lot of better!

Tsumugi:
Her face is full of confidence!

Yui:
(song)

Everyone:
Argh!

Sawako:
I made her practice too much!

Yui:
I threw my voice out!

Ritsu:
Knock off the cutesy act!

Tsumugi:
You're kidding... Who will do the vocals, then?

Nodoka:
All changes must be in by the end of the day.

Ritsu:
What?! You are not serious!
In that case...

Mio:
Huh?

Ritsu:
You're right.

Sawako:
Mio is the only other person who knows the lyrics.

Ritsu:
Yeah, 'cause she's the one who came up with them.

Tsumugi:
I know you can do it, Mio.

Yui:
Do it for Husky-Voiced-Yui!

Ritsu:
Oh, Mio!

Tsumugi:
Mio, what's the matter?!

Ritsu:
Pull yourself together!

Yui:
There's only three days 'til we go on!


-- Preview --

Mio:
Ritsu, don't you think we should get some practice before we go on?

Ritsu:
Sorry, but I can't right now.

Nodoka:
Well, you still have a fair amount of time until then.
Don't you wanna use the time to practice?

Ritsu:
She's right! Let's practice!
Pretend that didn't happen... That didn't happen...

Mio:
Today's the day of the performance!
Let's try and practice as much as we can!

Tsumugi:
Let's practice!

Ritsu:
We're gonna practice, huh?
