  Ui:
Hello, Ui Hirasawa here.
I'm hanging out with Azusa-chan for the first time today.

Azusa:
Hey!

Ui:
Ah, Azusa!

Azusa:
Sorry!

Ui:
What a cute outfit!
Oh, you're going to that training camp with the Light Music Club, aren't you?

Azusa:
I am. It's three days and four nights.

Ui:
My sister says that the one they all went last year turned out to be a lot of fun.

Azusa:
A lot of fun?
I bet she meant they practiced the whole time, didn't she?

Ui:
Uh... Um... Uh... Yeah.
I think so.

Yui:
Huh? Ui! Isn't this cute?!

Azusa:
Oh, I see. I mean, after all, the four of them play so amazingly well together.
They must practice a lot there
Right?


-- #10: Training Camp Again! --


Ui:
What's my sister like when she's at the Light Music Club?

Azusa:
Well, I guess she's kinda...

Ui:
Tell me!

Azusa:
She really doesn't practice at all.
And she gave me a pretty weird nickname.

Yui:
Azu-nyan!

Azusa:
She's all touchy-feely all the time.

Ui:
Yeah, my sister really is warm and sweet, isn't she?

Azusa:
Um, that wasn't exactly what I meant.

Ui:
Huh?

Azusa:
So, what is Yui-senpai doing today?

Ui:
She's at home.
Sis doesn't handle heat very well.
She hates air-conditioning, too.

Azusa:
I can picture her sprawled out on the floor.

Ui:
She's been lying around the house all day lately.

Azusa:
Talk about lazy.

Ui:
But she's so cute when she's lying around.
She's adorable!

Yui:
Ui! Ui! Ui, Ui, Ui, Ui...

Azusa:
Why do Ui and I see her sister so differently?
You know, lately I've been wishing I had a big sister who was a lot like Mio.

Ui:
Yeah, I think she's really nice, and cool, too.
What about Ritsu?

Azusa:
Well, she's awfully irresponsible and completely unfocused.
I'll pass.

Ritsu:
Oh, who's unfocused?

Azusa:
Ahhhh!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

Ui:
Hello, Ritsu, Nice to see you.

Ritsu:
Hey, I saw you two from outside and I decided to come in.

Ui:
So, you're by yourself today?

Ritsu:
Mm-hm. Mio's out taking some summer classes.

Azusa:
You mean you don't have to go to any, Ritsu-senpai?

Ritsu:
What? Who, me?
Summer classes?
What for?

Azusa:
What was I thinking?
Oh, that reminds me.
I've been meaning to ask you something.

Ritsu:
Uh-huh.

Azusa:
Mugi brings her own tea sets to the club room and fancy cakes and has vacation homes.
Does she come from a really rich family?

Ritsu:
That's for sure!
She even has a butler at home, and the family even leave the country some time to go on long vacations!

Azusa:
They really do that?

Ritsu:
It'd sure be cool if they did, huh?

Azusa:
So, you don't know for sure.

Ritsu:
Hey, why don't we give her a call and go hang out over at her place for a while?

Azusa:
Wait, are you sure?
It's kind of short notice.

Ritsu:
That's weird, she's not answering her cell.
I guess I'll try her home number.

Butler:
Yes, hello.

Ritsu:
Oh, somebody picked up.
Hi, is this Tsumugi's dad I'm speaking to?

Butler:
No, I am in the employ of the Kotobuki family as their butler.

Ritsu, Azusa:
Wow! They really have a butler!

Ritsu:
Um, well... uh... would Tsumugi happen to be at home, right now?

Azusa:
Senpai, just calm down!

Butler:
I'm very sorry.
But I'm afraid Miss Tsumugi is summering in Finland at the moment.

Ritsu:
Oh, she is?
Thank you very much then.
Sorry to have bothered you.
See? Told you?
It's just exactly like I said.

I'm exhausted for some reason...

Ui:
Want to come over to my house?
We have a nice watermelon.

Ritsu:
Count me in!

Ui:
I'm home!
You here, Sis?!

Ritsu:
Watermelon...

Ui:
Ritsu and Azusa-chan decided to come over here!

Yui:
Welcome home, Ui...

Ritsu:
It's strangely soothing...

Azusa:
It's just like she said.


Ritsu:
Hello, excuse us!

Yui:
There she is!

Ritsu:
It must be rough to be a teacher, and working during summer break.

Sawako:
Yeah, we have to go to seminars and whatnot.
Are you guys practicing?

Yui:
Yeah!

Sawako:
Did you want something?

Ritsu:
The Light Music Club is gonna have a training camp.

Yui:
And we were all wondering if you wanted to come.

Sawako:
A training camp, huh?

Ritsu:
She doesn't look too thrilled about it, does she?

Yui:
Fine. I guess we'll just go by ourselves then.

Ritsu:
She gets mad when we DON'T ask her, and when we DO, this is her response!

Yui:
Too bad, she could've gone swimming and had a barbecue and stuff.

Sawako:
Ah!

Yui:
I can't wait for this training camp!


Ritsu:
All right!
This is our first time together for a while, so why don't we go buy stuff for the training camp?

Azusa:
Hey, by the way, what are we out here to buy today?
Some brand-new gear for the band?

Mio:
Well, uh...

Yui:
Cute swimsuits!

Azusa:
They're ready to goof off!
I had a feeling something like this would happen.

Ritsu:
Hey, we're not gonna play around the whole time.

Azusa:
I can't trust you guys!

Ritsu:
How come!

Mio:
Hey, we'll have to take some breaks, too.
Right?

Azusa:
Mm... Oh, yeah.
I hadn't thought of that.

Ritsu:
What is this loneliness I'm feeling?


Everyone:
Oh!

Ritsu:
This one's even more awesome than the last one!

Yui:
This is the vacation home you said you couldn't borrow for us last year?

Tsumugi:
No, I'm sorry.
That home wasn't available for us this year, either.
I find this one rather cramped, but we just have to put up with it.

Everybody:
You have an even bigger one?!

Ritsu:
Oh, yeah, let's have some fun!

Mio:
Hey!
No playing until AFTER we practice!

Ritsu:
Aw...

Yui:
We wanna have fun!

Mio:
All right,
Majority rules, then.
I vote that we practice first.

Ritsu, Yui:
Play first!

Azusa:
I want to practice.

Tsumugi:
I vote for playing.

Mio:
Unexpected betrayal!

Yui:
Hurry up!

Ritsu:
Wait for me!

Mio:
I swear, they've got plenty of energy for goofing off.

Azusa:
When Mugi says "playing," I wonder if she means...

Yui:
I'm flying!

Ritsu:
Yes, yes, yes!

Azusa:
No, that could never happen...

Tsumugi:
I told you I didn't need this stuff, didn't I?!
You want to get rid of everything on the beach this instant!
I don't want the yacht, either!

Mio:
Mugi...

Azusa:
senpai...

Yui:
Catch!

Tsumugi:
Back and forth, back and forth!

Mio:
Aren't we ever gonna get around to practicing?

Yui:
Azu-nyan!
Why don't you come out and play with us, Azu-nyan!

Azusa:
No, thank you.

Ritsu:
I see.
You must be pretty bad at sports, huh?

Azusa:
Huh? I am not!
Bring it on!
You'll see what I can do!

Tsumugi:
Azusa has fit in with the club just fine, hasn't she?

Mio:
I suppose.

Yui:
Dr. Ritchan, you should look at this right away!

Azusa:
Hey, Mio.

Mio:
Huh?

Azusa:
You know that all story about corn barnacles, don't you?
A long time ago, a boy cut his foot on a corn barnacle, and...

Mio:
Ahh!

Azusa:
Uh, Mio...
What's the matter?
Mio?

Ritsu:
Hehe.


Yui:
Gotta move up some more!

Yui:
Gimme!

Azusa:
No!

Ritsu:
Mio!

Mio:
I don't know what got into me--

Yui:
Where am I?
A desert island?
Wake up, Ritchan!

Ritsu:
Yui...
Y-Yui!

Yui:
Ritchan!

Ritsu:
We did it.
We made it!

Yui, Ritsu:
We've got to the new world!

Ritsu:
Zipangu! The land of gold!

Azusa:
What the heck are they doing?

Ritsu:
We all played out.
Let's all go eat and then call it a night.

Mio:
What about band practice?

Azusa:
I knew it. I knew we should've practiced instead of playing around out here!

Ritsu:
But you played more than anybody, Azusa.
You're sunburned.

Azusa:
Ugh...
Yeah, well, I'm gonna go practice, too!

Ritsu:
All night long?

Azusa:
I will!


-- Eye Catch --


Ritsu:
I'm beat... And I'm starving, too.

Mio:
Suck it up.

Azusa:
This is awesome!

Mio:
It's awesome, all right...

Azusa:
I've never used an amp like that before!

Ritsu:
Mio, let's hurry up and practice!
These snares are brand new!

Mio:
Talk about self-serving.

Yui:
Hm? Azu-nyan, what's that thing?

Azusa:
What? Oh, this?
It's just an electronic tuner.

Yui:
Really?
What do you use a tuner for?

Azusa:
You use it to tune your guitar.
Wait a minute.
You've never seen a tuner before?

Yui:
Nope, this is the first one.

Azusa:
How do you tune your guitar, then?

Yui:
Huh? I do it by ear.
See?

Azusa:
S-She has perfect pitch!
I have no idea if she's amazing or not!

Ritsu:
Right, here goes!
One, two, three, four!


Azusa:
Hey, that sounded really great, didn't it?

Tsumugi:
Yes, we were perfect.
You were great, Yui-chan!

Azusa:
I wonder when they had time to practice?

Mio:
You set a perfect tempo over the song, too, Ritsu.
Did you do some cram practicing?

Ritsu:
Uh...
I'm so hungry that I've got absolutely no energy left.

Mio:
I guess the hunger made her lose her extra energy and play better than usual.

Ritsu:
C'mon, let's eat!
Please feed me!

Tsumugi:
Yes, me too.


Yui:
We're back!

Ritsu:
Welcome back!

Tsumugi:
Oh, thanks, Ritsu.

Yui:
Ritchan!
We bring you meat!
And veggies!

Ritsu:
Yay!
A whole head of cabbage!
I'm so hungry I'll eat it raw!

Mio:
Show a little patience, all right?

Ritsu:
Yay!

Azusa:
They goof off all the time, but for some reason they manage to play really well.

Ritsu:
Let go!
The cabbages!
The god of cabbages is angry!

Mio:
If we split up the cutting work, it'll be all ready in no time.

Azusa:
I'll light the grill and start getting everything heated up.

Mio:
See, our new member is taking the initiative and working hard.

Ritsu:
All right, all right...

Yui:
My eyes are burning!

Ritsu:
Yui, sure you can handle it?

Yui:
Ritchan!

Ritsu:
Yui!

Yui:
When we die, we die together!

Ritsu:
Yes!

Mio:
Ready!
So, why don't we make some onigiri?

Azusa:
Right!

Mio:
They're so different!

Ritsu:
I guess it's just that you have man hands, Mio.

Mio:
Shut up!

Yui:
That was delicious!

Azusa:
It was terrific!

Ritsu:
That was awesome, all right!

Tsumugi:
Hey!

Everyone:
Huh?

Tsumugi:
Who's for fireworks?

Tsumugi:
Oh, it burned out.

Ritsu:
You know when fireworks is almost burned completely out, it sort of makes you wanna cheer it on, doesn't it?
You can do it! You can do it! You can do it!

Yui:
You can do it! You can do it!

Tsumugi:
All right, one more time!
You can do it! You can do it!
Ah!
It broke off again.

Yui:
Ritchan, look! It's going out!

Ritsu:
Right!
At times like this, we have to combine and get bigger!

Yui, Ritsu:
Combine! Form Sparklerman!

Tsumugi:
Hey, no fair!

Mio:
Morons.

Tsumugi:
Is that too heavy?

Azusa:
No, I'm fine.

Ritsu:
Let's test our bravery!

Yui:
Oh!

Mio:
If it's not one thing, it's another...

Ritsu:
Why not?!
We have to have a bravery contest.
It's a camp tradition.

Mio:
Yeah, I'm not doing it.

Ritsu:
Oh, you won't?
You DO have a problem with scary stuff...

Mio:
I can handle it just fine!
So, bring it on, Ritsu!

Ritsu:
Now, you're going to pay dearly for making me wait so long to eat!

Mio:
S-Seriously, Azusa, who still has bravery contests in high school?

Azusa:
Um, you're kinda hurting my hand...
I wonder what that is?

Mio:
I-I bet it's Ritsu up to her usual tricks!

Sawako:
Mio-chan...

Mio:
Ahhhhh!

Azusa:
Mio! Senpai!
Pull it together.
Miss Yamanaka?!
What are you doing here?!

Sawako:
I-I finally found you.

Yui:
Huh? Miss Yamanaka?
What's wrong?
And what're you doing out here?

Sawako:
Well, my plan was to catch up with you and then surprise you all by my sudden arrival.
But I got lost.

Azusa:
It looks like you succeeded in surprising us, anyway.
Regardless of how lost you got.

Tsumugi:
Mio-chan!
Everything is all right!
Mio-chan!

Azusa:
I had no idea Mio got frightened so easily.

Ritsu:
Nobody's coming...


Mio:
That was total hell...

Tsumugi:
Now, now...

Ritsu:
Mio! Mio!

Ritsu:
Azusa, don't you like hot water?

Azusa:
No, that's not it at all.

Yui:
Azu-nyan, at times like this, it's best to just get it over with.

Azusa:
Ow!

Yui:
It was because you were sunburned, huh?

Tsumugi:
Yui-chan, have you lost weight?

Yui:
Huh? No.
Didn't I tell you before?
I can eat all I want, and I never gain any weight at all.

Tsumugi, Mio, Sawako:
I'm so jealous!

Yui:
What?
You, too, Miss Yamanaka?

Sawako:
You know what?
It's strange but I really can't tell the two of you apart without my glasses on.
I guess I'll have to tell you apart based on bust size!

Ritsu:
Gimme the cabbage!

Azusa:
Huh?

Yui:
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you practice with me.

Azusa:
Don't worry about it, Yui. It's all right.
I'd been hoping that I might get a chance some time to practice with you anyway.

Yui:
Thanks a lot.

Azusa:
Let's see...

Yui:
Azu-nyan, you're really good!

Azusa:
Huh? Oh, no!
Not at all!

Yui:
Now, it's my turn to give it a try.
Wow, this part is really tough.

Azusa:
Maybe you should try playing it at a slower tempo at first.

Yui:
Like this?

I did it!
Azu-nyan, I'm so glad I met you!

Azusa:
Huh?

Yui:
Azu-nyan!
Thank you so much, Azu-nyan!


Ui:
Hello, Ui Hirasawa here.
I'm hanging out with Azusa-chan again today.

Azusa:
Hey!
Hi, Ui!
Sorry, I'm late!

Ui:
Hi! What kept you?
Wait, WHO are you?


Ui:
So, I guess you didn't get in much practicing, huh?

Azusa:
Mm... Oh, we did practice some, but I was expecting more intensive training or something.
We basically goofed off most of the time swimming and stuff like that.

Ui:
Mm...

Azusa:
But I wanted to practice a lot more!

Ui:
I see...
Wait a minute! That's weird.
My sister wasn't tan at all.
How did you get so sunburned?

Azusa:
Oh, um...
Because I playing around more than anyone else.
Still though...
I'm really happy I went.
I learned lots of things about the others in the club.

Ui:
Yeah? What kind of things?

Azusa:
Well, like Mio is more of a scaredy-cat than you'd expect.

Ui:
Oh, she is?
What about Ritsu?

Azusa:
Well, She IS unfocused and all, but she and Mio are great together.

Ui:
And what about Mugi?

Azusa:
Let's see...
Mugi is sweet and generous and she's always thinking about others.
And she's got a childlike side to her that's fun and really cute.

Ui:
Oh. Okay, what about my sister?

Azusa:
Well, Yui is...
She buckled down and practiced!

Ui:
I knew it!

Azusa:
But...
She still stays glommed onto me all the time.

Ui:
She's warm and sweet, isn't she?

Azusa:
You know, she is.


-- Preview --

Azusa:
These strings are all xxx.
When was the last time you changed them out for new ones, Yui?

Yui:
Huh? You mean you're supposed to change the strings?

Everybody:
What?

Staff:
Is this a vintage guitar?

Azusa:
No, we're sorry.
It's just kinda dirty, that's all.

Yui:
It's been a year since I bought it.

Azusa:
What if she decides not to come back to the club anymore?
What'll happen to our concert at the school festival?
