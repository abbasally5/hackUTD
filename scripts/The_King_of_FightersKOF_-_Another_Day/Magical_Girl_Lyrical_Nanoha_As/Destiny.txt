Nanoha:
The quiet and peaceful Christmas Eve... A coincidental encounter led to a sad battle...
The blurred truth... The dancing shadow... The unreachable desire...
The tears holding the key to destiny revive the deep darkness...
A long and cold night quietly raises its curtains.
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's is about to begin.


Armed agent:
Come on! Hurry! Hurry it up! Ah! This... this isn't good! Evacuate!

Clyde:
This is the second block of the Hestia. The Book of Darkness is totally out of control!
The furnace, the bridge, they've all been taken!
The operating system and control of the Arc-en-ciel are gone.

Aria:
Sir, the Hestia is responding to the Arc-en-ciel's charge!

Crewman:
The main fleet is in the launch's path!

Graham:
Clyde, you must escape immediately! We're going to destroy the Hestia.

Clyde:
I have already comfirmed the total evacuation of the ship's crew.
The Arc-en-ciel's charge should reach its full completion in approximately 60 seconds, Admiral Graham.
I will show you the count time. Before it launches, please shoot it down.

Aria:
68 seconds until the Hestia's charge is fully complete.
The charge's completed here on our end. We can launch it any time.

Lotte:
Now what, Father!

Graham:
Arc-en-ciel, deploy the barrel... Before the count is 0... we're going to... shoot it down.

This was my mistake... I didn't expect the Book of Darkness to go out of control to the point of taking over the ship's command system...
I could not have anticipated that...

Crewman:
Targeted area's communication interference has been eliminated.
The picture is being set!

Lindy:
How about Chrono?

Crew:
He's already left for the location.

Masked man 1:
Good. I was able to put up the shield. Is the Durandal ready?

Masked man 2:
It's ready...

Will of the Book of Darkness:
Diabolic Emission.

Fate:
It's a dimensional attack!

Will of the Book of Darkness:
Land into the shadows of darkness.

Raising Heart:
Round Shield.

Masked man 1:
Wonder if they can handle it.

Masked man 2:
Hopefully they can hold on until the attack loses power.

Chrono:
Lightning Bind... This spell magically binds all targets and takes away their magic abilities.
The magic itself is not that useful. But every now and then, it comes in handy.
Your transformation magic will now be forcefully removed.
（誤訳：このシーンでクロノが使っているのは「ストラグルバインド」であり、「ライトニングバインド」ではない）

Lotte:
Chrono, you...! How dare you!?

Aria:
Where did you learn that magic? I know that I sure didn't teach it to you.

Chrono:
No. But you did teach me to always be training even when I'm alone, didn't you, Aria and you, Lotte?

Will of the Book of Darkness:
They hid...

Fate:
Sorry, Nanoha... How are you doing? Are you okay?

Nanoha:
Yeah. I think I'm okay.

Fate:
Her attack covers an incredibly wide range.
I'm thinking it'll be hard to dodge it. Let's go, Bardiche.

Bardiche:
Yes, sir. Barrier Jacket, Lightning Form.

Fate:
Here.

Nanoha:
Oh, Hayate...

Yuno:
Nanoha!

Alf:
Hey, Fate!

Nanoha:
Yuno! And Alf, hey guys.

Will of the Book of Darkness:
Master... I will grant you your desire, my master...
In the name of the adorable guards... to those who dared to injure them...
Now, I will destroy them.

Book of Darkness:
Gefängnis der Magie.

Fate:
What is that!?

Alf:
It's the same shield that was trying to trap us!

Fate:
Seriously? She's really after us, isn't she?

Yuno:
Chrono's trying to find the way to take care of this.
Suppoter's on its way, but I'm afraid it's gonna take a little time.

Fate:
Well, we gotta have to think of a way to hold out until it gets here.

Alf:
Okay.

Fate:
Nanoha...

Nanoha:
Don't worry, I'm okay.

Will of the Book of Darkness:
And now, Sleipnir. The power of flight...

Book of Darkness:
Sleipnir.

Chrono:
You were the one who ordered Aria and Lotte to go and do what they did, weren't you, Admiral Graham?

Lotte:
Chrono, it wasn't him!

Aria:
We chose to do what we did. My Father was not involved.

Graham:
No, Lotte, Aria. It's all right. Chrono already knows a great deal more than I thought he did... don't you?

Chrono:
Ever since the Book of Darkness incident 11 years ago, you've been looking for the Book, trying to find out where it transmigrated to. Isn't that right, Admiral?
And then, you found it. You learned of its location. You also learned who its present owner was. Hayate Yagami.
But even if you had managed to get a hold of the owner and the incomplete Book of Darkness, that wouldn't have meant anything.
Because, let's say, you manage to capture the owner, and destroy the Book of Darkness, the Book just transmigrates right away.
Therefore... you waited for the completion of the Book, keeping a close eye on it.
And then, you found the way, didn't you? To seal away the Book, forever so that it can't transmigrate.

Graham:
When I saw the girl, she who had lost her parents, she who had fallen ill... I felt a great pain within...
But I also thought her situation was the result of destiny's power. After all, there wouldn't be anyone to grieve for her...

Chrono:
You pretended to be her father's friend, and you were financially supporting her, too. Isn't that right?

Graham:
I wanted her to know a tiny, short of happiness, before being put to sleep... How hypocritical...

Chrono:
The way to seal the Book of Darkness, is to freeze it along with its owner, and then trap them between dimensions, or in a frozen world of some sort...
Does that sound about right, Admiral?

Graham:
Yes... That is correct. That way, the Book of Darkness will not transmigrate.

Lotte:
Past owners of the Book of Darkness have been totally evaporated with the power of Arc-en-ciel!
It's really not that different, you know.

Aria:
Chrono, look, it's not too late just yet. Set us free, while we still have time.
The only time we can freeze the Book of Darkness is within a few minutes after it goes out of control.

Chrono:
But until that point is reached, the owner of the Book is not yet considered some criminal who needs to be sealed away forever.
That would be illegal.

Lotte:
And because of that! Because of that law, the tragedies have been repeated over and over again!
That's why Clyde was... That's why your father had to go and...!

Graham:
That's enough...

Chrono:
The law aside, there's a problem with your plan.
First of all, the removal of the freeze would not be that hard.
No matter where you hide it, or how well you protect it, someone would try to find it, and try to use it.
Anger and sadness... Greed and desire... Those are the kinds of wishes that can lead one to the sealed power...
As for what's going on out there, it has me worried. So I'm heading out.

Graham:
Chrono, wait.

Chrono:
What is it?

Graham:
Aria, give Chrono Durandal.

Aria:
But, Father!

Lotte:
No way...

Graham:
What other choice do you think we have at this point? We can't put it too good use in here.
As for how to use it, you decide... This is the stuff of freezing, Durandal...


Will of the Book of Darkness:
Break these chains.

Book of Darkness:
Breaker.

Bardiche:
Plasma Smasher.

Fate:
Fire!

Raising Heart:
Divine Buster Extension.

Nanoha:
And shoot!

Will of the Book of Darkness:
Shield me...

Book of Darkness:
Panzerschild.

Will of the Book of Darkness:
Now shoot blades... and dye them in blood...

Book of Darkness:
Blutiger Dolch.

Will of the Book of Darkness:
Now pierce them, with the Bloody Dagger.

Shed the light of destruction, shine it upon the criminals.

Alf:
Wow! No way!

Yuno:
Wait! Is that...!?

Will of the Book of Darkness:
Gather all you, stars... Become the light that penetrates everything...

Nanoha:
Is she doing Starlight... Starlight Breaker...!?

Fate:
Alf, Yuno! Go!

Alf:
Got it!

Will of the Book of Darkness:
Penetrate... penetrate beam.

Alf:
How dare that girl use Nanoha's magic!?

Yuno:
Nanoha was absorbed by the Book once. She must have coppied her magic then!

Nanoha:
Fate, we don't have to get too far, do we?

Fate:
If that attack hits us at close proximity, it'll break thorough our shield! We have to get far away.

Bardiche:
Sir, there are noncombatants on the left at 300 yards.

Arisa:
I didn't see anyone! It's like everyone just suddenly dissapeared!
It's becoming dark and... I see something is shining! What's going on!?
Let's get out of here, Suzuka! Let's run far away.

Suzuka:
Yeah. I think you're right.

Bardiche:
Distance; 70, 60, 50...

Fate:
Nanoha, you stay here.

Nanoha:
Okay.

Bardiche:
20, 18.

Fate:
Huh?

Nanoha:
Hey, um, excuse me! It's dangerous to be out right now! Please stay where you are!

Suzuka:
Tha sounds kind of like...

Arisa:
Nanoha...?

Suzuka:
And Fate, too?

Will of the Book of Darkness:
The power is ready. Starlight Breaker...

Nanoha:
Fate, take care of them.

Fate:
Okay, you two. Don't move.

Bardiche:
Defenser Plus.

Nanoha:
Come on, Raising Heart!

Raising Heart:
Wide Area Protection.

Yuno:
Nanoha! Nanoha, are you all right?

Alf:
Fate!

Nanoha:
Yeah... I'm fine, but...

Fate:
Arisa and Suzuka are here. They're trapped inside of the shield.

Alf:
They're what!?

Yuno:
Got that, Amy?

Amy:
As soon as the high waves lessen in a little bit, I'll evacuate them!
Try to hang in there till then!

Nanoha, Fate:
Yeah!

Fate:
It's okay. You're safe now.

Nanoha:
I'm going to have them take you to a safer place. So just stay still for a sec.

Arisa:
Hey.

Suzuka:
Nanoha, what about you, guys?

Arisa:
What's going on here?

Nanoha:
Well, they've seen us now...
Yuno, sorry but... do you think you can protect them?

Fate:
Alf, too.

Alf:
But, Fate!

Yuno:
Let's go, Alf. Come on.

Alf:
But, what about...

Yuno:
They can't fight well if they're busy worrying about other things like you and me.

Amy:
Nanoha, Fate, there's a message from Chrono!
He's saying you have to convince that Hayate, the owner of the Book of Darkness to stop and surrender.

Nanoha:
Okay! Hayate... Book of Darkness! Please stop what you're doing! We didn't hurt Vita! It wasn't us!

Fate:
We and Sigum are...

Will of the Book of Darkness:
My master always wished that this unforgiving world, this world that took away her only loved ones, that left her all alone,
that it would prove to be nothing more than a bad dream... All I'm trying to do... is grant that wish!
For my master, a peaceful, never-ending slumber, I'll present an eternal dream...
And as for the others... the ones who took away the Knights... an endless darkness!

Nanoha:
Book of Darkness!

Will of the Book of Darkness:
Book of Darkness... I see... You're going to call me by that name, too...
It doesn't matter to me. All I'm doing, is trying to grant my master's one wish.

Nanoha:
You're just trying to grant Hayate's wish...?
Is that really gonna make her happy? What if it doesn't work? Maybe there's another way to make her happy!
And what about you, Miss Book? You don't mind just being some device with an empty thought, thoughtlessly granting your master's wish!?
You're really satisfied with that!?

Will of the Book of Darkness:
I am only a magic book. Nothing more than a device...

Nanoha:
That's not true! You can use the words and... and you have a heart, don't you!? Otherwise, it doesn't make any sense.
After all, if you don't have a heart, then... you won't be crying like you are now!

Will of the Book of Darkness:
These tears are my master's tears, they're not mine.
I'm nothing more than an object. I cannot feel sadness... or pain.

Fate:
Engage, Bardiche. Barrier Jacket, purge!

Bardiche:
Sonic Form.

Fate:
You say you don't feel sadness? When you say such sad words with the sad face... who could possibly believe you!?

Nanoha:
You have a heart, too! You can say that you're sad!
Your master Hayate, she's a nice girl! She'll tell you the same exact thing! She's gonna answer these questions!

Fate:
You should just release Hayate, Book. Remove the armor! Please!

Will of the Book of Darkness:
It's quite fast... The final destruction has already begun.
Not long from now, I will lose hold of my consciousness.
Once that event occurs, I will lose total control of myself.
I want to grant my master's wish, while I still have consciousness, while I'm still here...

Book of Darkness:
Blutiger Dolch.

Will of the Book of Darkness:
Descend now... Sink into darkness...

Fate:
That's enough! You [brat]!

Bardiche:
Sonic Drive.

Fate:
Listen to...

Bardiche:
Ignition.

Fate:
Us!

Will of the Book of Darkness:
Now you shall rest. You shall finally sleep. Sleep within me.

Nanoha:
Fate! No!

Book of Darkness:
Absorption.

Will of the Book of Darkness:
Now it begins... with everything in a deep and peaceful slumber...


Nanoha:
Fate got trapped inside the Book of Darkness. Hayate remains asleep inside the Book as well.

Fate:
Past memories and sadness fall upon a holy night.

Nanoha:
And then, a small present...

Fate:
Next episode of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's, it's episode eleven: A Gift for Christmas Eve.

Nanoha:
Her wish... will come true.
