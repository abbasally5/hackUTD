Hayate:
I had always been alone. So the thought of dying from a disease wasn't something that scared me.
But now, it's different. These are days I want to protect. These are people I hope dear, people I want to make happy.
For everyone's sake, I want to stay alive. I want to stay smiling, stay strong. That's how I feel... Because I am their master...
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's is about to begin.


Shamal:
Yes. Everything's going fine so far.

Signum:
Yeah. And since I haven't gone back that way yet, the Administration Bureau can't track our actions very well.
I hope Master Hayate... isn't too lonely right now.

Shamal:
Well, she hasn't said anything about it to me. And her friends seem to be visiting pretty often, Suzuka, and those other girls.

Signum:
I see. Okay, good. I just don't want her to worry, that's all. I'll be back in a few days. Won't be long.

Shamal:
Okay. Take care of yourself.

Signum:
I will. That's it. Just 60 more pages to go.

Momoko:
Okay, everybody. Dig in!

Shiro:
Wow, you really outdid yourself, didn't you? This is great!

Nanoha:
Wow! It looks good!

Shiro:
This is great. Looks delicious.

All:
Thank you for the food!

Momoko:
Okay, Fate. Don't be shy now. Just dig in!

Fate:
Oh, thank you very much, I will.

Kyoya:
Here, Nanoha. Something in a plate perhaps?

Nanoha:
Oh, yes. Thank you.

Momoko:
Miyuki, your cooking has really improved.

Shiro:
Hey, Christmas is coming up. So what are you gonna do, Fate? Are you gonna spend Christmas Eve with your family?

Fate:
Yes. I mean, at least for now...

Momoko:
I see.

Shiro:
Well, we're gonna be pretty busy Christmas Eve too, you know.

Nanoha:
That's right. I'm gonna be working on all the price tags and the pop-up signs in all that tonight.

Miyuki:
That would be great! What we all need is a good night's sleep tonight.

Nanoha:
Midoriya's Christmas cake is so good, you can hardly get it [xxx] on Christmas Eve. They really [loved], it's the most popular thing we have.

Miyuki:
On top of that, we're open late for the people who spend Christmas Eve with their loved ones or friends. And they wanna bring a really nice gift.

Fate:
Oh, I see.

Miyuki:
You really lucked out, Kyoya. You get to spend the entire time with Miss Shinobu in the cafe.

Kyoya:
I just don't see what that has to do with anything.

Momoko:
But don't worry. We'll make sure those two cakes for Arisa and Suzuka don't get lost in the shuffle.

Nanoha:
Great!

Shiro:
There's also a reservation there for Miss Lindy that's taken care of, so that's set-aside.

Fate:
Oh, I'm... Well, thank you. You're very nice.

Suzuka:
"So after closing ceremonies at school tomorrow, does that [break] for everyone?"

Fate:
"Taking Hayate a present, right?"

Nanoha:
"Is it okay to surprise her?"

Arisa:
"If inconvenient, can have Dr. Ishida give it to her."

Suzuka:
"Good. Then, that's the plan. See you tomorrow. Good night."
And send.

Amy:
Hey! What's wrong, Chrono?

Chrono:
Oh, I was just looking something up.

Amy:
I see. I'd be happy to do it for you if you'd like.

Chrono:
No. That's okay. Just something a little personal, that's all.
Oh, so what about Yuno's report on the Book of Darkness? Did you get that out to Nanoha and the rest of them yet?

Amy:
Nanoha and the others seem to have mixed feelings about the past of the Book of Darkness as well.

Chrono:
I see...

Vita:
I'm sorry, Hayate. I wish I could have come over to see you more often than I have.

Hayate:
So how's everything, you're okay?

Vita:
Oh, great! Really well!

Suzuka:
Hello.

Hayate:
Oh, wait. Look hey, Suzuka. Hi, come on in.

All:
Hello!

Suzuka:
Oh, hey. Looks like everyone's here today.

Arisa:
Oh, hi! Nice to meet you.
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you in the middle of something?

Signum:
No. Not at all.

Shamal:
It's nice to see you. Come on in.

Suzuka:
Oh, great. I'm so glad.

Hayate:
Oh hey, so what brings you guys out here, something up?

Arisa, Suzuka:
Okay... It's surprise Christmas presents!

Suzuka:
It's Christmas Eve, Hayate. We've got Christmas presents for you.

Hayate:
For me? Oh, you shouldn't have...

Suzuka:
We all picked them up together.

Arisa:
But you can't open them till later.

Hayate:
Okay. Oh, Nanoha? Fate? Is something wrong?

Nanoha:
Ah, no. Nothing. Everything's fine.

Fate:
Just a little shy. Isn't that right?

Signum:
Yes.

Shamal:
Okay, everyone. I [hear all], let me take your coats.

All:
Okay!

Fate:
I can't use telepathy. What's going on? Are you blocking it?

Signum:
Don't worry. Shamal's an expert on this kind of thing. It's very easy for her at this distance.

Nanoha:
I ah... well, it's... Would you please stop glaring at me?

Vita:
I'm not glaring at you. I was born with eyes like this.

Hayate:
Vita, don't lie! Got it? This is what happens when you're bad!

Fate:
Is it all right, for us to be here now?

Signum:
Yeah...

Arisa, Suzuka:
Good night, Hayate!

Hayate:
Hm? What's the matter, Vita?

Vita:
I'm okay... It's nothing.

Hayate:
I see. Look at that. I wonder if it's gonna snow tonight...

Nanoha:
Oh so, Hayate's the... the master of the Book of Darkness...

Signum:
Our wish will be granted very soon now.

Shamal:
Stay out of our way. It doesn't matter if you're her friends or not!

Nanoha:
No, wait! Just a minute, okay? Please! You gotta listen!
Don't go through with it! If the Book of Darkness is completed, then Hayate...!

Fate:
Nanoha!

Signum:
It would be quite a problem if you told the Administration Bureau about our master.

Shamal:
I'm afraid I can't let you get out of range of my communications blocking.

Nanoha:
Vita... No...

Vita:
Stay out of our way! In just a little bit, we'll be able to save her! Hayate's not gonna stay like that! She's gonna recover! She's gonna return to us!
We've been doing everything we can... It's so close I can taste it. So stay out of our way!

You demon...!

Nanoha:
So I'll be... a demon.

Raising Heart:
Accel Mode. Drive Ignition.

Nanoha:
Maybe I am a little demonic... but you're gonna listen whether you like it or not!


Signum:
Shamal. Stay back and keep yourself focused on blocking the communications, okay?

Shamal:
Right.

Fate:
The Book of Darkness... is broken and it's been causing a various tempering.
If you complete it in its present condition, Hayate will...

Signum:
In a way, we're actually part of the Book of Darkness ourselves.

Vita:
That's why it's so obvious... we know the most about the Book of Darkness further than anyone!

Nanoha:
Okay... then why?

Raising Heart:
Accel Shooter.

Nanoha:
Then why do you call it the Book of Darkness?
If you know so much then, why can't you call it by its real name?

Vita:
By its real name... What are you saying?

Bardiche:
Barrier Jacket, Sonic Form.
Haken.

Signum:
You made a thin armor even thinner...?

Fate:
To move faster...

Signum:
But a direct hit... even from a weak attack, will kill you. Testarossa, are you out of your mind?

Fate:
No, I'm doing it to win! It was the only way I can think of to have a chance against such a formidable adversary.

Signum:
If only we hadn't met in quite this way, it's sad to think of it, isn't it?
Think of how close we could've been in different circumstances.

Fate:
It's... not over yet!

Signum:
I can't stop! We, the Guardian Knights, for the smile of our master, we'll really relinquish even our pride!
And now... we have no choice!

Fate:
We'll stop you. Bardiche and I will make sure of it!

Bardiche:
Yes, sir.

Zafira:
I can't get through to anyone... What could have possibly happened?

Nanoha:
Come on, you know, what's the other name? Didn't it have a different name?

Vita:
The real name... for the Book of Darkness...?

Nanoha:
The bind things!? Not again!?

Fate:
Nanoha!

Bardiche:
Plasma Lancer.

Fate:
There!
It's not gonna be... like last time!

Nanoha:
Two of them!?
What in the world... is this!?

Masked man 1:
With so many people, I can't keep the binding or communications blocking for long. Please hurry up.

Masked man 2:
Yes...

Shamal:
What!? Hey, what do they...!?

Masked man:
Final pages are given out by the Guardians who are no longer needed.
It's been that way a few times in the past as well.

Book of Darkness:
Sammlung.

Masked man:
The Broken... cursed Lost Logia.
There is no way such a thing can save anyone.

Vita:
Shamal! Signum! No! What are you!? What the hell are you anyway!?

Masked man:
There's no need for a mere program to know that.
Yes, of course. The other one... Take it.

Book of Darkness:
Sammlung.

Masked man 1:
Those two, Nanoha and Fate, how are they?

Masked man 2:
It's a quadruple bind in a Crystal Cage. It will take several minutes for them to break free.

Masked man 1:
More than enough... The master of the Book of Darkness...

Nanoha (fake):
The awakening has come.

Masked man 2:
No.

Fate (fake):
Time to end, this cursed history.

Hayate:
Nanoha... and Fate... What are you... What's this!? What's going on?

Nanoha (fake):
You have an affliction, Hayate. It' known as the curse... of the Book of Darkness.

Fate (fake):
And I'm afraid... you can never get better.

Nanoha (fake):
And even if the Book does get completed, you won't survive.

Fate (fake):
There's no realistic scenario where you are saved.

Hayate:
That doesn't matter... Let go of Vita... What have you done to Zafira...?

Nanoha (fake):
They were already broken, from a long time ago, long before we ever did anything to them.

Fate (fake):
They thought they could still use the functions of the Book of Darkness that [was as] long since broken.
And they continued this futile effort.

Hayate:
What do you mean!? Signum? And Shamal?

Nanoha (fake):
You see, broken machines serve no purpose, they're useless.

Fate (fake):
So, we should destroy them.

Hayate:
No! You can't! No!

Nanoha (fake):
And if you want us to stop...

Fate (fake):
Then you'd better use force for us.

Hayate:
Then why!? Why do you have to...!? Why can't you two stop!?

Nanoha (fake):
Hey, Hayate...

Fate (fake):
It's time you knew... destiny is very cruel...

Hayate:
Stop it! No, not that! Let her go!

Book of Darkness:
Guten Morgen, Meister.

Nanoha:
Hayate!

Fate:
Hayate!

Hayate:
I am master of the Book of Darkness... To these hands, grant power.
Release... the seal.

Book of Darkness:
Freilassung.

Will of the Book of Darkness:
Once again, every day has come to an end.
How many more times must I have to repeat such sadness?

Nanoha:
Hayate, no!

Fate:
Hayate...

Will of the Book of Darkness:
I am the Book of Darkness. All of my powers...

Book of Darkness:
Diabolic Emission.

Will of the Book of Darkness:
Now [xxx] with wishes of my master!


Nanoha:
The Book of Darkness wheels its power controlled by sadness, with its feelings bound by heavy chains.

Fate:
So many pasts... So many misfortunes... Spirals that entwined draw a melody of sadness...

Nanoha:
