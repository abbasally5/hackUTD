Nanoha:
It was the smallest of miracles. Prayers were sent far into the sky.

Fate:
Tears became light, and little rainbow. And the long night finally came to a close.

Nanoha:
The farewell spoken at the time of departure is not the end.
It is a word of new beginning.
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's, last episode, is about to begin.


Reinforce:
Just as I expected, the damage is far more serious than we initially thought.
The protection program may have stopped. But the basic structure's still the same.
Soon I... the main source of the Tome of the Night Sky will automatically create a new protection program, and I'll start to lose control again.

Signum:
Just as you've expected.

Shamal:
And you can't restore the old protection program?

Reinforce:
Impossible. The Tome of the Night Sky has been permanently erased from me.
And I'm [a / at] supervising program.

Zafira:
As long as we don't know the original form of the program, there's no way you can restore it.

Reinforce:
That's right.

Signum:
And what about Hayate? Is she going to be all right?

Reinforce:
There should be no problem. I won't devour her. And her Linker Core's functioning normally.
As for her disabled legs, they should heal soon.

Shamal:
In that case, I guess we should look at this whole situation and call it a good thing, shouldn't we?

Signum:
We should. There's no reason to have any regrets.

Vita:
Since it doesn't have its protection program, it should be easy to destroy the Tome of the Night Sky.
And as long as we destroy it, it'll never go out of control again.
But in return for doing so, we'll all get erased.

Signum:
I'm really sorry about that, Vita.

Vita:
Why are you apologizing? I don't mind.
We all knew that things might happen this way. I mean, we all knew it was coming.

Reinforce:
No. That's not true. You all will stay behind. The one who will leave... is me.

Fate:
Destroy the Tome of the Night Sky!?

Nanoha:
Why? I thought we already destroyed the protection program!

Chrono:
It was a suggestion from the Book of Darkness which functions as the Tome supervising program.

Alf:
Is that the same supervising program that Nanoha and the others were fighting against?

Chrono:
Yeah.

Yuno:
We were able to destroy the protection program. But the Tome of the Night Sky quickly regenerates itself.
There's a high possibility that Hayate will be encroached on again.
As long as the Tome of the Night Sky exists, the danger will not disappear.

Chrono:
The Book of Darkness asked for us to take action while its protection program isn't running and to fully destroy it.

Nanoha:
No way...

Fate:
But we can't 'cause Signum and the others will...

Signum:
No. We'll be staying behind.

Fate:
Signum.

Zafira:
It would seem that the Knight program along with the protection program was free from the main source.

Shamal:
And now she... Reinforce is asking all of you for just one final favor.

Nanoha:
What kind of favor?

Vita:
Your happiness, Hayate, that's the only thing that brings all of us happiness.
Reinforce says that she will smile and go.
So please... do something for me. While you're sleeping, praise her in your dreams.

Reinforce:
Oh, you came after all.

Nanoha:
Hey there, Reinforce... Umm...

Reinforce:
So you're gonna call me by that name now, huh?

Nanoha:
Yeah...

Fate:
Are you sure you want us to do this? To return you to the sky?

Reinforce:
I wanted to ask this of you... a both of you.
Thanks to the two of you, I was able to listen to Master Hayate's words.
I didn't have to eat away at Master Hayate. And I was able to help the Knights live.
And for that I thank you. Which is why I wanted to... I want the two of you to put an end to me.

Nanoha:
But what about Hayate? I mean, don't you have to say goodbye to her?

Reinforce:
I want her to be happy. I do not wish to bring her more sorrow.

Fate:
That's very kind of you...

Nanoha:
Yeah, but it's also sad... It's probably the saddest thing ever!

Reinforce:
You will someday understand when you meet someone.
And you love for them as deep as the sea.
And you want nothing more than to look out for that someone. And to protect their happiness.
Shall we begin? The Magic Tome of the Night Sky... comes to an end.

Hayate:
Rein... Reinforce?

Raising Heart:
Ready to set.

Bardiche:
Standby.

Reinforce:
My time here was a very short one, but I am grateful to all of [your effort].

Bardiche:
Don't worry.

Raising Heart:
Take a good journey.

Reinforce:
Yeah.

Hayate:
Reinforce! Everyone!

Shamal:
It's Hayate!

Vita:
Hayate!

Reinforce:
Don't move! Do not move! Please. My consciousness will stop.

Hayate:
Stop it! Don't do this! Reinforce! Reinforce!
You don't need to destroy the Book!
I'll take care of it, I promise, I will! It's okay! You don't need to do this!

Reinforce:
Oh Master Hayate... It'll all be okay.

Hayate:
No, it will not! It won't be okay! It won't be okay at all!

Reinforce:
I have existed for a long time, Master Hayate.
But at the end of it all, you came along and you gave me a pretty name.
Not only did you do that... you gave me a heart as well.
The Knights will be beside you. You don't need to worry.

Hayate:
But... but I worry because I...

Reinforce:
And that is why... I can smile and leave you now.

Hayate:
No! I don't like people who don't listen to me! I am your master, so you have to do what I say!
I will do something, I swear! We promise that we won't go out of control again, we promise!

Reinforce:
Yes. And that is a promise... that you have kept.

Hayate:
Reinforce, don't do this!

Reinforce:
The magical vessel's most important duty is to protect the master from any known forms of danger.
Please, master. I ask that you let me choose the best way to protect you. Let me look out for your happiness.

Hayate:
You were always... You were always so sad and you... finally... you were... you were finally saved!

Reinforce:
My spirit will remain here. It'll live on in all your magic.
The Knights will carry my will in their souls.
I will never leave you. I will always be beside you.

Hayate:
That's just not true! That's not true, Reinforce... It isn't true at all!

Reinforce:
Your friends are not particularly fond of whiners. Please try to understand, my master.

Hayate:
Reinforce! But why...? Everything was supposed to begin with the fresh start now...
[Why / Once] suppose to have a happy ending together? I still need to make you happier...

Reinforce:
It's okay, Hayate. I'm okay, I promise. I promise you that I'm the happiest magic book in the entire world.

Hayate:
You really mean that, Reinforce?

Reinforce:
Master Hayate... now I have one favor to ask of you.
Once I fully disappear, I'll become nothing more than a powerless artifact.
Would you please take that name, that beautiful name with which you so kindly blessed me, and give it to the next magic vessel, which you will no doubt someday receive? Will you do that for me? Call it the "Wind of Blessing, Reinforce". If you do that, then my soul will be with it forever and ever.

Hayate:
Will you believe, Reinforce?

Reinforce:
Yes, I will, my master.
Master Hayate... Guardian Knights... And of course, the brave young magicians...
Thank you, everyone. I'm so grateful. This is goodbye...

Nanoha:
Hayate...

Vita:
Hayate!

Lindy:
I see... I got it. Well, thanks a lot for the call.
Do yourself a favor and rest at home today, all right?
Yes. I guess I'll be heading for home tomorrow. Bye.

Letty:
Was that Fate on the phone?

Lindy:
Yeah. She confirmed the destruction of the magic book's main source.

Letty:
I see. Did you hear about Admiral Graham?
Apparently, he resigned in order to handle his case. He's going back to his hometown.

Lindy:
Well, basically, he had into this thing and interfered with the entire investigation.
That's about it, right? Now I'm wondering what's going to happen with Hayate.

Letty:
He says he's going to continue supporting her financially.
When she becomes independent, he says he's going to come forward and tell her the truth.

Lindy:
I see...

Letty:
Speaking of which, now you can tell your husband, right? When are you going?

Lindy:
I'm going next week. I'm going back with both Chrono and Fate.

Letty:
What are you planning to say?

Lindy:
Oh, let's see... It'll probably be the same as always.
I'll just tell him that "It was busy as usual, but you know, I'm doing fine."

Letty:
I see.


Nanoha:
Well, I guess the case is over...

Fate:
Yeah...

Nanoha:
But even so... I feel a little lonely.

Fate:
Chrono said that, umm..., the cases related to the Lost Logia always tend to end up sort of like this.
Sad things link us to one another and we'll pull together by a massive power.

Nanoha:
Yeah...

Fate:
I think I'm gonna continue the Bureau's job. Because, I wanna become an Enforcer.
I wanna stop cases like my mother's. And like this one. I don't know, I just... I just wanna be a help.
How about you? Have you thought about what you'll do from now on?

Nanoha:
The thing is... I don't think I could ever become an Enforcer.
But I'm pretty sure I'm heading in the same direction as you.
I wanna be able to use my magic, I mean, properly.

Even though you came back, I feel like I was barely able to spend time with you.

Yuno:
Yeah. I was really busy with all the research.

Nanoha:
Well, so what are you gonna do now?

Yuno:
Well, the Bureau is [gonna] ask me to become the Head Librarian for the Eternal Library.
It seems like they're gonna have a dorm for me at the Headquarters.
And they said I can continue my archaeology studies. I'm thinking of accepting.

Nanoha:
If this is the Headquarters, you'll be very close to Midchilda. That would make me very happy.

Yuno:
Would it, really?

Nanoha:
Mm-hm!

Yuno:
I'll be leaving here.

Nanoha:
Huh?

Yuno:
They said I could stay on the Arthra until I get a job.

Nanoha:
Oh, I see.
If you umm... have time during the end of this year and new years, let's get together, okay?
There're so many things I wanna tell you, Yuno!

Suzuka:
"Hey, Nanoha. Do you have some free time tomorrow?
Arisa and I are going over to see Hayate for a while.
But afterwards, I'm thinking of having a Christmas party at my house.
I've invited Fate, too. I'd love it if you can come, Nanoha."

Nanoha:
I really need to tell her about things... everything that happened...

Fate:
So Hayate went back to the hospital, did she?

Nanoha:
Yeah. 'Cause when she took [out / off] yesterday, she was still checked in down there.

Nanoha, Fate:
Good morning!

Hayate:
Good morning, guys! Nanoha, Fate!

Nanoha:
What is this?

Fate:
What happened? Are you checking out?

Hayate:
Not exactly. Unfortunately, it looks like I'll be here quite a while.

Nanoha:
I understand.

Hayate:
But I'm feeling okay, and I told Suzuka and Arisa not to bother coming.
'Cause we're going straight to the Christmas party!

Fate:
Great!

Hayate:
A lot happened yesterday. But I wanted to thank you both for everything you did for me.

Nanoha:
No problem.

Fate:
Don't worry about it.

Nanoha:
Is that... Reinforce?

Hayate:
Yeah. She may have fallen asleep but, Reinforce will always be right here with me.
In fact, I'm thinking about putting a new Device into it.

Fate:
Hayate, are you still gonna be a magician?

Hayate:
Yeah. Because that's the power that she gave me.
Due to what happened with this case, the Knights and I are going to be put on probation by the Bureau.

Nanoha:
You really are?

Vita:
Looks that way.

Shamal:
They're also going to let us pay them back for the crimes we committed, by attending the Bureau when helping them out.

Signum:
Enforcer Chrono was kind enough to handle the whole thing for us.

Shamal:
The term is quite long but, this was the only way we could stay with Hayate. So we're really happy.

Nanoha:
I understand.

Hayate:
I'll be treated as a part-time employee, so guess what, Nanoha? I'll be your Kohai!

Dr. Ishida:
Now listen to me, Hayate. You have to return for sure today. It's a promise.

Hayate:
Yes. It sure is.

Nanoha:
So did you guys have a hard time last night and this morning?

Vita:
Yeah. You know, since we went out without permission, Signum and Shamal got into some pretty serious trouble.

Fate:
She's a strict doctor, huh?

Vita:
Yeah, but... she's a good doctor.

Nanoha:
She seems to be...

Signum:
Thank you, Doctor.

Dr. Ishida:
Be safe!

Hayate:
Yeah.

Hayate:
Thanks for waiting.

Nanoha:
No problem.

Signum:
Fate Testarossa.

Fate:
What is it, Signum?

Signum:
I think that someday, we should put an end to our fight.

Fate:
Yeah. We'll make it fair and square. In fact, we can do it several times.

Miyuki:
G'morning... Kyoya.

Kyoya:
What are you talking about morning? It's already past noon!

Miyuki:
So what are you looking at?

Kyoya:
It's a letter from Nanoha, Miyuki.

Miyuki:
Hmm... let me see it.
"Dear Mom, Dad, Kyoya and Miyuki. I have something really important to talk to you all about.
Miss Lindy and Fate will also be coming to join us. So I was thinking that maybe we could have our talk before dinner.
I hope that's all right. Nanoha."
She wants to talk to us? What could it be about?

Kyoya:
Well now, let's see here. Maybe it's about... maybe it's about her future plans.

Arisa:
Nanoha and Fate should be arriving here any minute now with Hayate.
And they say they have something really really important they like to tell all of us. You're ready?

Suzuka:
You bet.

Arisa:
Now that I think about it, Hayate might have also been involved with that thing last night.

Suzuka:
I wonder about that.

Arisa:
Well, if Nanoha wants to keep it a secret, [then better] to keep it a secret. I don't care one [more] the other, really.
But if they're gonna tell us about it, then let's be sure to listen to them.

Suzuka:
I hope she tells us about how she met Fate. That's the part I'm really curious to hear about.
You know, Arisa. I really feel like we could all become a lot closer if they would just tell us everything.

Arisa:
Yeah. That's right.

Chrono:
So I see, you'll be working at Headquarters, too.

Yuno:
Yeah. Nanoha's going to continue her part-time job.
It seems like almost everyone will be working at the Bureau.

Chrono:
It's all very admirable. Some people are saying they might have Nanoha becoming a Fighting Technique Instructor.

Yuno:
I see.

Chrono:
I'm also going to be counting on you [better] as the Librarian, Yuno.

Yuno:
Thanks a lot, Chrono. I'll do my best.

Alf:
To tell you the truth, Zafira, it causes a lot less trouble to go outside in this form.
Not to mention that it's rather energy efficient, too.

Zafira:
Is that really true?

Nanoha:
And then... The Book of Darkness incident completely ended.
I've gone through many encounters and farewells...
New days begin. I will... definitely...


6 years later...


Hayate:
Hey umm, Shamal. Would you send a parcel off to Mr. Graham for me, please?

Shamal:
You got it. Leave it up to me.

Signum:
Hey Signum, I'll see you later on, okay?

Signum:
Yeah. See you later.

Hayate:
Hey.

Vita:
Hayate! See you later!

Hayate:
Okay, Vita! See you later!

Lindy:
That looks great. Fate, here's your lunch.

Fate:
Oh wow! That smells great. Thanks, Mother.

Chrono:
It's pretty exciting. Everyone is finally gathering today.

Amy:
You know what? Come to think of it, it might be the first time since you became a Captain, Captain Chorno?

Chrono:
Well, at least it's a peaceful mission. So it's a little bit like a reunion.

Amy:
It sure seems that way.

Chrono:
So, how about you, Yuno?

Yuno:
Yeah. I'm right on time.

Amy:
So ah... Yuno, has anything happened between you and Nanoha?

Yuno:
Well, you know, we, we see each other often, but now nothing much has happened between us. I mean, not really.

Amy:
Oh, dear...

Chrono:
Amy. It's work time, you know.

Amy:
Yeah, yeah.

Arisa:
Hey there, Nanoha!

Suzuka:
Hello, Nanoha.

Nanoha:
Hey! Arisa, Suzuka! Hello!

Arisa:
Good morning.

Suzuka:
Good morning. So do you have work today?

Nanoha:
Yeah. Ah... We're all getting together for the first time today.
I have to [drop] out after lunch so... lend me your notes for the afternoon.

Arisa:
Okay. I'll take clear notes so that'll be easy for you to copy.

Nanoha:
Thanks, Arisa.

Hayate:
Good morning, you guys!

Fate:
Good morning, everyone!

Arisa:
Good morning. I hear you're gathering today.

Fate:
Yeah.

Hayate:
I'm so excited.

Nanoha:
The bond that we forged that day still remains strong...

Let's do this, Raising Heart!

Raising Heart:
Yes, my master.

Fate:
You're ready, Bardiche?

Bardiche:
Yes, sir.

Hayate:
Here we go now, Reinforce!

ReinforceⅡ:
All right! My Master Hayate!

Raising Heart:
Standby Ready.

Nanoha, Fate, Hayate:
Set up!
