There is one new message. Playing new message.

Dr. Ishida:
Hello, this is Ishida from Uminari University Hostpital. Let's see, tomorrow's your birthday, right, Hayate?
I was calling to see if you would be interested in eating out together after the check-up tomorrow.
I'd be happy if you could give me an answer before you come to the hospital. See you soon.

Answering machine:
There are no more messages.

Hayate:
Oh, it's already midnight... 

Book of Darkness:
Ich entferne eine Versiegelung.
Anfang.


Nanoha:
The Beginning Comes Suddenly.


Nanoha:
Shooting control's the last thing we have to practice. Could you please set it up, Raising Heart?

Raising Heart:
All right.

Nanoha:
Lyrical Magical... Glimmers to be blessings, come into my hands!
Ring and echo under the guidance! Divine Shooter, shoot!
Now, control...

Raising Heart:
18, 19, 20, 21...

Nanoha:
Accel!

Raising Heart:
55, 60, 64, 68, 70, 73... 98, 100.

Nanoha:
Last one!

Raising Heart:
Don't mind, my master.

Nanoha:
Thanks a whole lot, Raising Heart.

My name is Nanoha Takamachi. Until fairy recently, I was a very ordinary third grader living a very ordinary life.
But because of a certain insident that happened to me this past spring, I have become a mage.

How do you think it went? How would you rate today's practice?

Raising Heart:
About 80 points.

Nanoha:
I see!

All the people back then who gave me magic, many new introductions and courage of heart, are slightly distant from me right now...
But, I'm sure I'll see them again soon.

Kyoya:
Nanoha, you've got mail.

Nanoha:
Oh, I do?

Kyoya:
Overseas air mail, sent by someone named "Fate Testarossa".

Nanoha:
Thank you, big brother.

Miyuki:
It's that girl that always sends you mail. Is it another video-letter?

Nanoha:
Mm-hm. It sure is!

Shiro:
You've been pen pals with her for over six months now, haven't you?

Momoko:
Fate is planning to come here and visit us soon, isn't she?
Well, the minute she gets here, I'm gonna throw my arms around her and give her a big hug!

Nanoha:
Yeah!

Miyuki:
You know, ever since we found Yuno's real owners and gave him back, it's gotten quite lonely around here.

Kyoya:
I think you took especially good care of the little guy.

Nanoha:
Well... uh... we might end up taking care of him again for a while. It all depens on the owers' plans.

Miyuki:
Really? I hope so!

Momoko:
Yeah.

Miyuki:
Hey, Mom. Do you think Yuno remembers who I am?

Nanoha:
Fate... Yuno... Chrono... Miss Lindy... Miss Amy... I wonder if everyone's doing okay...

Alex:
Preparations for docking at Administration Bureau Headquaters are complete.

Lindy:
Hmm... The plans are going well. That's very good.

Amy:
Excuse me, Captain. I was just wondering if you'd like some more of your tea.

Lindy:
Oh, yes, I'd love some. Thank you, Amy. Once we've done docking at Headquaters, the Arthra and all of us are finally going to get a little break.

Amy:
That's good.

Lindy:
Where're the kids?

Amy:
Right now, I believe all three of them should be resting.
Enforcer Chrono and Fate were undergoing some battle training until a few moments ago. And Yuno was just hanging out there, watching them.

Lindy:
I see. Tomorrow is the final day of the trials, they sure are focused.

Amy:
Well, with this hardest they're working, I'm sure we'll win.

Chrono:
Now, let's go through the final check list. Fate, you're on the defendant side, answer the questions honestly according to everything we've discussed.

Fate:
Mm.

Chrono:
Today, we are going to have Alf, go on to the defendant booth, too.

Alf:
Right. I got it.

Chrono:
Good. And the ferret-wannabe and I will be in the witness seats.The answers to the questions are right in front of you.

Yuno:
Right, got it, Chrono. Hey!

Chrono:
What is it?

Yuno:
Who do you think you're calling a ferret-wannabe!?

Chrono:
That would be you, any problems?

Yuno:
Even though I'm in my animal form more often than not, I have a fine name, Yuno Scrya, and I deserve some respect!

Alf:
Yuno, chill out.

Fate:
Chrono, you shouldn't make too much fun of him, you know.

Chrono:
It's no big deal. It's just a little joke to ease the tension.
Once all of the facts have been considered, I'm sure that the verdict'll be innocent, with some years of probation and protect of care.
But even so, you still need to make sure you have all your answers down pat.

Fate, Alf:
Okay.

Yuno:
Yeah...

Letty:
Kudos some the hard work. Is everything going according to plan?

Lindy:
Yes, Letty. Any problems on your end?

Letty:
Yeah... but nothing concerning the docking and maintenance plans of the Arthra.
On this end, we have a situation developing that has become rather troubling.

Lindy:
A troubling situation?

Letty:
The Lost Logias... very dangerous items that have civilian search requests in place.
Their marks have been found in several worlds and the one in charge of searching them out has become overwhelmed by the work.

Lindy:
Oh...

Letty:
We sent out investigators and we're currently waiting for a report from them.

Lindy:
I see...

Vita:
So weak... I don't think these two idots are gonna make much of an addition, but...
Your magical power... food for the Book of Darkness.

Suzuka:
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

Arisa:
Bye!

Nanoha:
Bye bye!

Suzuka:
Is this the one?

Hayate:
Yes. Thank you so much for the help.

Suzuka:
I see. So we're the same age!

Hayate:
Yeah. I saw you around here every so often, and I thought to myself "Hey, here's someone my age!"

Suzuka:
Actually, I thought the same thing. By the way, my name is Suzuka Tsukimura.

Hayate:
That's a pretty name. My name, is Hayate Yagami.

Suzuka:
Hayate.

Hayate:
You write it in hiragana. It's pretty strange, isn't it?

Suzuka:
I don't think that's true. I think it's a really beautiful name.

Hayate:
Thanks, Suzuka.
This is far enough, Suzuka. Thanks for all your help.

Suzuka:
Yeah. Well, you're welcome.

Hayate:
Thanks for having a conversation with me. Thanks for a whole bunch.

Suzuka:
Yeah. See you soon, Hayate.

Shamal:
Hayate, are you sure you're not getting too cold out here?

Hayate:
Yeah, I'm fine. Are you cold, Shamal?

Shamal:
No, I'm not cold at all.

Hayate:
Oh, Signum. Hi!

Signum:
Hi.

Hayate:
What's for dinner? What would you two like to eat, Shamal, Signum?

Signum:
Oh, I don't know. I really can't decide right now.

Shamal:
Why don't we think about it while we look over the ingredients in the supermarket?

Hayate:
Mm... sounds good. I meant to ask, did Vita step out somewhere again today?

Shamal:
Umm... well, let's see, I--I believe she did.

Signum:
I believe she's out playing around at the moment, but Zafira is watching over her. So there really isn't much need to concern yourself about.

Hayate:
Okay...

Shamal:
You know, even when there's a bit of distance between us, we're always right here by your side to watch and protect you.

Signum:
Yes, it's true. We're always by your side.

Hayate:
Thank you.

Zafira:
How are you doing, Vita? You think you could find it?

Vita:
It's like it's here, but it's not here.
A curiously large magical response that has been appearing ever so often for years, if we can catch whatever's causing it, we can gain about twenty pages all at once.

Zafira:
Let's split up and search. You take the Book of Darkness.

Vita:
Okay, Zafira. Search as hard as you can, all right?

Zafira:
Yes, I understand.

Vita:
Sealing Area, unfold.

Graf Eisen:
Gefängnis der Magie.

Raising Heart:
Caution. Emergency.

Nanoha:
A barrier!?

Vita:
Magical response, I found the big one! Graf Eisen, it's time to get going.

Graf Eisen:
Jawohl.

Raising Heart:
It approaches at high speed.

Nanoha:
It's moving closer? To us?

Graf Eisen:
Gegenstand kommt an.

Raising Heart:
It comes.
Homing bullet.

Vita:
Tödlichschlag!

Nanoha:
Raising Heart, please! Help me!

Raising Heart:
Standby ready, set up.

Graf Eisen:
Schwalbefliegen.

Nanoha:
I don't know of any reason why I should suddenly be attacked like this!
Where are you from? Why in the world would you do such a thing?
If you don't tell me, then I can't help you!

Vita:
Aargh! Darn you!

Raising Heart:
Flash Move.
Shooting Mode.

Nanoha:
Listen to me...

Raising Heart:
Divine...

Nanoha:
To what I have to say!

Raising Heart:
Buster.

Vita:
Graf Eisen, execute Cartridge Load!

Graf Eisen:
Explosion.
Raketenform.

Vita:
Raketen... Hammer!

Raising Heart:
Protection.

Vita:
[Destroy through now!]

Graf Eisen:
Jawohl.

Nanoha:
Is this gonna be... the end of me? No... Yuno, Chrono, Fate!

Yuno:
I'm sorry Nanoha. We're a bit late.

Nanoha:
Yuno... How...

Vita:
Her allies...?

Bardiche:
Scythe Form.

Fate:
We're her friends!

Nanoha:
Beginnings always come so suddenly. But this incident was just a way too sudden for me. Confusion, worries, what should I do!?

Fate:
The emergence of a powerful enemy puts us in crisis. What is the objective of those who have come after us?

Nanoha:
Next episode of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's, it's episode two: Once Again, the Storms of Battle.
Lyrical Magical!

Fate:
We'll do our best.
