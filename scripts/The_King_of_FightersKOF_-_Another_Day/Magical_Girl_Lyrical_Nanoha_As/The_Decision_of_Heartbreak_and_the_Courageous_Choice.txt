Nanoha:
It was just a small pain. Feelings that should have collided were blocked, unable to reach the other side.
Wishes get tangled up. Hearts and hopes melt together. The truth fades almost out of sight.
Even if the past was sad, and no matter how dark the future may seem, you still have to stand up against them.
Because there's one thing I'm sure of, we are all fighting in the same time.
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's is about to begin.


Lindy:
Even though Miss Fate's Linker Core has sustained serious damage, her life is not in any danger at this time.

Nanoha:
That's just like what happened to me. The Book of Darkness absorbed everything.

Chrono:
Good thing it was while the Arthra was running. That allowed us to help her faster than we were able to do in your case Nanoha.

Aria:
That's right.

Amy:
And then, a little while after you two left, a hacker attacked us and the entire Headquarters' security system went down.
That's why I couldn't issue orders and contact you. I'm so sorry... I failed in my duty...

Lotte:
No, Amy. You're wrong! Thanks to you, getting the system back up so quickly, we were able to contact the Arthra.
And that's how you managed to get clear footage of that masked man.

Lindy:
Well, isn't that peculiar I must admit I wasn't expecting that. After all, their equipment's pretty much the same as the Administration's.
The real question is whether there's actually anybody who can break into this system from the outside.

Amy:
Yes! That's exactly the point! When you're out of all the fire walls and the alarms and [taking the / take into] consideration [if I could [xxx]
the fact that has to] be done quickly...

Alex:
Yes. It's just inconceivable.

Amy:
I'm moving things around as much as I can now. But I need to come up with the whole new configuration blocking them.

Nanoha:
Do they have some kinda super engineer or something? Is that what you mean?

Lotte:
Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's a syndicate of engineers.

Chrono:
Yes. But I'm still unclear on a lot of what you said. What about their condition and how they all interact?

Alf:
It's hard to say. By the time I was able to get there, the masked man was already long gone.
But there she was... Signum. She was holding onto Fate.
She said she couldn't make any excuses, but set to say she was sorry. That's it.

Lindy:
Alex, are you absolutely sure that there are no problems with the Arthra cruising about?

Alex:
None at all.

Lindy:
Okay. This is earlier than we planned here, but I want to transfer our Headquarters back to the Arthra now.
All hands, back to your stations.

All:
Right.

Lindy:
Now as for you, Miss Nanoha, you need to go back home.

Nanoha:
Oh, okay. But...

Lindy:
And if you're worried about Miss Fate, we'll handle it. I can assure you she's in very good hands, okay?

Nanoha:
All right.

Nanoha:
The Decision of Heartbreak, and the Courageous Choice.


Shamal:
I guess one way to put it... is that we got saved.

Signum:
Well, at least it's obvious, once and for all, that he really wants to see the Book of Darkness completed.

Zafira:
Who knows? Maybe he's planning on using the Book of Darkness himself once it's complete.

Vita:
He wouldn't do that! And even if he takes the Book of Darkness after it's completed, it doesn't matter. Only our master can use it!

Signum:
When it reaches the point of completion, the master will have absolute power.
There's no way that threats or brain washing could have any effect on her.

Shamal:
We've got a very elaborate security system around the house.
I think you have to say it's pretty safe in here, so I don't think you have to worry about her, at least not around here.

Zafira:
That's great. But just to be safe, Shamal, I think you should stick with her as much as you can.

Shamal:
Yeah.

Vita:
Hey. When we finish the Book of Darkness, and Hayate becomes the real master, then Hayate would finally be happy, wouldn't she?

Signum:
What's up with all that?

Shamal:
Once she's the master, her powers are going to be extraordinary.
And us, Guardian Knights, we should know better than anyone just how powerful she can be.

Vita:
Yeah. That's true. I don't know, it's just the... it just seems to be...
Somehow I get the feeling that we're forgetting something really important.

Hayate!

Shamal:
Hayate!

Vita:
Hayate! Hayate! Call the hospital! Get an ambulance!

Signum:
Right.

Zafira:
Don't move her! Just leave her alone!

Vita:
Okay...

Lindy:
Miss Fate, are you awake?

Fate:
Admiral Lindy...? Alf...?

Lindy:
Let just let her sleep now. She was right by your side all night long.

Fate:
Ah... what...? I...

Lindy:
You see, you're aboard the Arthra now.
You were attacked from behind in that battle out in the desert, and I'm afraid you've been unconscious ever since.
It was bad, and it looks like it absorbed a bit of your Linker Core, but they say you'll be fine. So I wouldn't worry.

Fate:
I... I was defeated, wasn't I?

Lindy:
Don't go saying that. Even the searchers in the Bureau were caught off guard by this. What could you do?
Oh, that was forward of me! I'm sorry.

Fate:
Oh, no. That's okay. It's just...

Lindy:
It looked like you were having some kind of nightmare. But you seem fine. It's good to see that.

Fate:
I'm sorry. Thanks for understanding.

Lindy:
I called your school and said you'd be absent for a bit because of some family matters.
So why don't you just rest for a while?

Fate:
Okay...

Lindy:
You must be hungry, aren't you?
I'll have them get you a snack and something to drink. What would you like?

Fate:
Oh, no. That's all right.

Lindy:
It would do you good.

Fate:
Oh, well, then... I'll leave it up to you.

Alf:
Fate...

Dr. Ishida:
Well, you seemed to be coming along nicely. That's good to see.

Hayate:
Thanks. I feel a lot better now.

Shamal:
Yeah. What a relief. I'm glad that's over.

Hayate:
I told them I got a bit dizzy, and that I pulled the whole bunch of muscles in my chest when I fell.
Jeez, everybody's making it into such a big deal.

Shamal:
Well, I don't know. You did hit your head, Hayate.

Signum:
And it would be a big deal if something happened.

Vita:
Hayate, I'm so glad.

Dr. Ishida:
Well, since you came all the way out here, I might as well make good use of the time and do a few tests. So make yourself comfortable.

Hayate:
All right.

Dr. Ishida:
Miss Signum, Miss Shamal. Do you mind stepping outside with me?

Signum:
Okay.

Shamal:
Huh?

Dr. Ishida:
I couldn't find anything in the test. So I don't really know what to say.
But, I think we're looking at something little more serious than just a pulled muscle.

Signum:
Yeah. She was in a lot of pain. It was excruciating.

Dr. Ishida:
That isn't a good sign. It could be spreading again.
But these symptoms are new, aren't they? It's not like she's been hiding this.

Shamal:
No, I don't think so. But it's hard to say, Hayate's always been very good about hiding her pain and suffering.

Dr. Ishida:
I can't guarantee that she won't have another seizure.
I think the best way to proceed would be to keep her in the hospital for a little while and see how it goes.
Is that all right with you?

Signum:
Yes.

Hayate:
I have to stay?

Shamal:
What can I say? Doctor's orders.
Oh, but it's just for some tests, that's all. Just to be on the safe side. There's nothing to worry about, right?

Signum:
Right.

Hayate:
Oh, I guess there's nothing wrong with that.
But then if I have to be stuck in the hospital, who's gonna make dinner for everybody?

Signum:
Umm... I really don't know. But I think it'll all work out.

Shamal:
Oh, it's so good. I think we can handle it, I guess.

Vita:
Yeah, I'll visit you every day. So it's all okay, you know?

Hayate:
Oh, Vita. You're such a good girl. But it doesn't have to be every day, you know.
There's nothing to do here, Vita. You'll be terribly bored.
Oh, that's not so bad. A nice relaxing vacation with meals and an afternoon nap.
Oh, no! Suzuka might be trying to text me and stuff.

Shamal:
Oh, don't worry about that. I'll get a hold of her for you.

Hayate:
Wait. Thank you.

Signum:
We're gonna go home and get you some clothes and a few books, okay?

Hayate:
Hmm... what shall I choose?

Signum:
Vita, come on.

Vita:
Yeah...


Yuno:
So... this is what I've learned from my research so far.
First of all, the "Book of Darkness" is not its intended title.
According to the older sources, the official title is "Tome of the Night Sky".
It was the tome that traveled with its master, and was originally created to gather great magical technology from every lands to be used for research.
The use of its destructive power was probably started when one of its long-lost owners altered the main program.

Aria:
So people who use Lost Logias to recklessly grab massive power are nothing new.
They've existed before, just as they do now.

Yuno:
Because of that alteration, the travel function and automatic repairs of corrupted data are completely out of control.

Chrono:
Is that it? Does that explain the infinite reincarnations?

Lotte:
If it's ancient magic, that might be [ever] seen.

Yuno:
The worst part of it all, is the way the owner's change by all this.
If there's no gathering of power for a given length of time, it starts to eat away at the owner's magical powers.
And when it's complete, the owner's magical powers can be used... for indiscriminate destruction.
And that's why all the owners up to now were done as soon as they completed the Book.

Chrono:
And what about references to figure out a way to stop it or seal it? Have you found anything like that at all?

Yuno:
That's what I'm working on now. But stopping it from being completed will probably be difficult.

Chrono:
But why?

Yuno:
Only someone recognized as the true master by the Book of Darkness will be able to use the administrative rights in the system.
In other words, there's no other way to stop or change the program.
If an attempt is made to force it from the outside, another embedded system will absorb its master and reincarnate.

Aria:
That's right. And that's why they say the eternal sealing of the Book of Darkness is impossible.

Lotte:
You know, in the beginning, it was just a research book that they didn't expect that, did they?

Amy:
It's sort of sad... I feel sorry for the Tome of the Night Sky...

Chrono:
So is that everything?

Yuno:
That's it so far. But I've got a couple of good angles.
The Infinity Library is amazing. Just as I expected, I can find whatever I want.

Aria:
Now you know what? We think you're amazing. You're so skilled at searching for stuff.

Chrono:
I'm afraid I need you to go a bit further.

Yuno:
Right.

Chrono:
You too, Aria.

Aria:
Sure thing. Lotte, take over for me, will ya?

Lotte:
Okay, Aria.

Amy:
Good luck! Boy, Yuno's amazing, isn't he?

Lotte:
Yeah. I know you mean. Who'd have thought he'd be that good?

Chrono:
Amy. Bring up the image of that masked man.

Amy:
Okay.

Lotte:
What's up? You got an idea?

Chrono:
Yeah.

Amy:
This man's ability is absolutely amazing. Or maybe I guess more like impossible.
Take a look at these two worlds. You see, even at the fastest [warp], you still couldn't ever make it under twenty minutes.
But even after blocking a direct hit from Nanoha's buster, and successfully initiating a long-range bind, he still had time to creep up behind Fate without her noticing and delivered that blow. And he did it in nine minutes' time.

Lotte:
Well, you gotta admit, whoever this guy is, he's good.

Chrono:
No. I couldn't do that. What about you, Lotte?

Lotte:
Are you kidding? No. No. I was never any good at long-range magic.

Amy:
Oh, so is that how you guys work?
You divided up, so you take the physical stuff, and Aria takes all the long-range magic?

Lotte:
Right. You got it.

Chrono:
Yeah. Well, that's gotten me into a lot of trouble over the years.

Lotte:
Yeah... well, maybe you were dead. But so what, it made you stronger.

Nanoha:
So are you feeling all right?

Fate:
Yeah. I'm not so sure about not being able to use magic. But basically I'm all better.
In the meantime, Nanoha, they want us to live quiet normal lives until we are called.

Nanoha:
I guess it's sorta like we're on standby, huh?

Fate:
Yeah. They want to increase the number of armed agents, and shift the focus to pursuit from search.

Nanoha:
I see.

Fate:
The hospital?

Nanoha:
Really? Hayate?

Suzuka:
Yeah... They called me about it [xxx / late] yesterday afternoon.
[It's [xxx] / It wouldn't] sound like it wasn't too serious or anything.
But they were saying she was gonna have to have a lot of tests.

Arisa:
Oh... I know! Why don't we go visit her after we get out of the class?

Suzuka:
Oh, is that okay?

Arisa:
Come on, Suzuka. Isn't she a friend of yours? Besides, you said you were gonna introduce us to her.
And when you visit someone in the hospital, it's a lot more fun [if you don't] go alone.

Nanoha:
Well, I'm not sure I agree with all that.

Fate:
Oh, come on. Why not? Right?

Suzuka:
Yeah. Thanks. Good idea.

Shamal:
And a little bit of this...
Oh, Suzuka.

Suzuka:
"To Miss Shamal. Hello, this is Suzuka Tsukimura.
My friends and I would like to come visit Hayate after school today, if you don't mind. Is that all right for us to come?"

Shamal:
Oh, that's awfully sweet of her.

Suzuka:
"If this is inconvenient for any reason, we'd appreciate it if you show Hayate this photo for us."

Signum:
What the...? What is this about Testarossa and her group?

Shamal:
It's just... It's just, it's Testarossa, Nanoha, the mages from the Administration, and they are asking if they can come out to see Hayate.
It looks like they're friends of Suzuka's. What should we do? What should we do?

Signum:
Calm down, Shamal. It's gonna be fine.
Fortunately, most of her magical potential's deep within the Book of Darkness. Unless they use careful test, they won't find anything.

Shamal:
Ah... well... maybe so, but still she...

Signum:
What I'm saying is they can't get close to us, okay? We can't bump into them.

Shamal:
I knew it, it was a mistake to ever let them see my face.
Whenever I went outside, I should've at least had the sense to use costume magic or something.

Signum:
There's no use regretting things now. When her friends visit, we'll just have to step out of the room, that's all.

Shamal:
Yeah.

Signum:
And we also have to be very careful. And make sure we ask master Hayate, Dr. Ishida not to mention our names.

Shamal:
But Hayate... Won't that seem strange to her?

Signum:
We have no other choice. I trust you.

Shamal:
Yeah.

Hayate:
Yes. C'mon in.

All:
Hello!

Hayate:
Oh! How nice to see you! Come on in!

Suzuka:
Sorry to bother you. How are you feeling, Hayate?

Hayate:
I'm all right. Have a seat. Make yourselves comfortable.

Fate:
Thanks.

Hayate:
You can put your coats over there.

Arisa:
Okay.

Nanoha:
Here. We brought a cake from our place!

Hayate:
Oh, really?

Dr. Ishida:
Miss Shamal? What's going on?

Shamal:
Oh! I... ah... just got a little bit worried, that's all.

Dr. Ishida:
Why don't you just go inside and have a good time? Or is there some kind of taboo against that?

Shamal:
I ah... well... ah...

Dr. Ishida:
This may be a strange way of putting it, but as Hayate's primary doctor, I am grateful that you're all around, Miss Shamal.
It's really nice to see Hayate so happy. It really is because of you guys're living there like that.
Hayate's condition is a very difficult one to treat, and there really doesn't seem to be there much I can do about it, no matter how hard I try.
Hayate's obviously the one having the hardest time.
But, with all of you and all of her friends supporting her, I'm sure she'll find the strength she needs to get through this.
So please, whatever you're doing, just keep it up. She's going to need every bit of help she can get to get through this.

Shamal:
Yes...

Nanoha:
I hope she gets well soon.

Suzuka:
Yeah, me too.

Shamal:
How was your visit with your friends, Hayate?

Hayate:
Oh, they're all really good girls. It was fun. They said they're gonna visit as much as they can.

Shamal:
Oh, that's nice to hear.

Hayate:
Oh, look, Shamal. It's almost Christmas.
You know what? This is gonna be our first Christmas with us all together.
I hope I can get out of here, so we can all go have fun.

Shamal:
I [thought] that. I think we have a really fun time.

The Book of Darkness is inundating Hayate's body at a steadily increasing pace.
At this rate, she'll barely last a month! No, perhaps not even that...

Vita:
Something's very strange... My memory's telling me that this isn't the way it was meant to be!
But... at the moment, this is the only thing we can do.
We'd hate it if Hayate ever stop laughing and, and we dread it, or if she were to die!

Graf Eisen:
Ja.

Vita:
Let's do it, Eisen!

Graf Eisen:
Explosion.

Vita:
Gigant! Crash it!

Aria:
Father. It's not good for you to work so hard.

Lotte:
She's right, you know.

Graham:
The two Liezes. How are things going for you?

Lotte:
Oh, bit [by day], you know.

Aria:
Chrono's group is doing the best it can, considering.
But they're facing the Book of Darkness, so it isn't easy.

Graham:
I see... I'm sorry. It wasn't right to get you two involved in this sort of thing.

Lotte:
What are you talking about, Father?

Aria:
We're you're Familiars, Father, all right? Your wish is our wish. And that's what we believe.

Lotte:
Mm-hm. It's all right, Father. So don't worry about a thing. Durandal's already done, too.

Aria:
And the seal on the Book of Darkness, I'm sure that it'll be fine this time.

Graham:
Yes...


Signum:
The Book of Darkness is almost complete. But it happened nonetheless.

Shamal:
Was it coincidence, or necessity, or even destiny?

Signum:
The time that had stopped, now begins to move.

Nanoha:
Next episode of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's, it's episode nine.

Fate:
Christmas Eve.

Nanoha, Fate:
Drive Ignition!
