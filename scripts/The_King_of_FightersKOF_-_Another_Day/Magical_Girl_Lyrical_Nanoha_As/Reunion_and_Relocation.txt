Fate:
It was a very small wish. To exchange smiles, to gently touch one another... However, what welcomed us was a time of warfare.
Our powers were taken away from us. The staves of magic were shattered and wounded.
It's still unclear who we should be fighting against... or what we can do once we know. But still, we continue...
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's is about to begin.

Amy:
According to the test results, her wounds aren't really that serious.
However, her Linker Core, the root of her powers, has shrunk to unusual size in her.

Lindy:
I see. Then, this is the same series of events as all the other cases.

Amy:
Yes. There's no doubt about it. For there goes our vacation. From the looks of things, we're going to have to deal with it.

Lindy:
I'm afraid it can't be helped. It just goes with the job.

Nanoha:
Reunion and Relocation!

Chrono:
Well, I'm relieved that your injuries weren't serious.

Fate:
Chrono... I'm sorry I made you worry.

Chrono:
I suppose I've gotten used to it. It's all right.

Doctor:
Hmm... I'm delighted to say that the recovery of the Linker Core has already begun.
But for a while, you won't be able to use most of your magic, so be careful.

Nanoha:
Yes, Doctor. And thank you very much.

Doctor:
Oh, Enforcer Harlaown. Can I have a moment?

Chrono:
Yes, of course, Doctor.

Doctor:
This way.

Chrono:
Something wrong?

Doctor:
About that thing...

Nanoha:
How are you, Fate?

Fate:
Oh, Nanoha...

Nanoha:
Umm... sorry, we finally get to see each other again and this happens. Is your arm all right?

Fate:
Oh, uh... It's nothing, really. What about you, Nanoha?

Nanoha:
I'm feeling fine. And it's all thanks to you guys, Fate. Happy and energetic.
Fate...? Fate.

Fate:
Nanoha!

Nanoha:
I'm sorry. Guess I'm still a bit [mushy].

Fate:
Yeah...

Nanoha:
I wanna thank you for saving me. I'm grateful. And Fate, I'm really happy I got to see you again.

Fate:
Yeah. Me, too. I'm so happy I got to see you.

Alf:
Nanoha! And Fate!

Nanoha:
Hi, Yuno! And Miss Alf!

Alf:
Hi, long time no see!

Yuno:
Hey, Nanoha.

Nanoha:
You guys...

Fate:
Bardiche... I'm sorry. I just wasn't strong enough.

Chrono:
What's the status?

Yuno:
Honestly, it's not looking too good. Right now, we're working through the auto repairs.
After all the basic structures have been reestablished, we have to reboot it and change all sorts of parts.

Chrono:
I see.

Alf:
You know, I was thinking... Wasn't there something strange about the magic those guys used?

Chrono:
They were probably using the Velka-style.

Alf:
Velka-style?

Yuno:
It's a type of magic that was once in a big power struggle with the Mid-style that we use.

Chrono:
The Velka-style forgoes some of the long distance and long range attacks in order to specialize in close-quarter combat.
Their mages who excel are called "Knights".

Fate:
Yes, that's right. I remember she said she was a Velka Knight.

Yuno:
They're best known for the "Cartridge System", a specialized armament that's been integrated into their Devices.

Chrono:
They use bullets spelled with the magic compressed in special ceremonies to deliver a momentary blast of its explosive, destructive power.
It's a dangerous and troublesome system.

Alf:
Troublesome is right.

Nanoha:
Thank you for trying your very best. I owe you a lot, Raising Heart. For now, you should just rest.

Chrono:
Fate, it's almost time for the interview.

Fate:
Right.

Chrono:
Nanoha, can I have a moment with you?

Amy:
Yuno, Alf.

Alf:
Amy.

Amy:
We're getting new parts for Raising Heart and Bardiche. I ordered them all just now.
We'll get everything today or tomorrow at the latest.

Yuno:
Thank you so much, Amy.

Amy:
Oh, yeah. And just a few moments ago, this case officially came under our jurisdiction.

Alf:
What? But isn't the Arthra still stuck in maintenance?

Amy:
That's right, it is. Oh, by the way, do you know where Chrono is?

Alf:
He went to be interviewed along with Nanoha and Fate.

Yuno:
It seemed like he was with one of the higher-ups from the Administration Bureau.

Amy:
Oh.

Chrono:
Excuse me, sir.

Graham:
Chrono, it's been quite a while.

Chrono:
Yes, sir. It sure has.

Graham:
They call me a Probational Officer, but it's only a name.
I heard all about the recent incident and about how you are as a person from Admiral Lindy.
She said you were nice.

Fate:
Oh, thank you for your very kind words.

Amy:
A long time ago, Admiral Graham was Chrono's mentor and an instructor. He's in the history books.
When he was at his highest rank, he commanded an entire fleet. And later, he became the Chief Enforcer.

Alf:
He's a tremendously important man!

Amy:
Yeah. But he's a good guy, too. He's really nice.

Graham:
Hmm... Nanoha, I gather you are Japanese. The scenery of Japan makes me so nostalgic.

Nanoha:
Huh?

Graham:
I also come from the same world as you live in, Nanoha. I'm from England.

Nanoha:
Really? You're from my world!?

Graham:
Most people in your world have no magical powers whatsoever.
But once in a great while, someone comes along with high magical potential, like you and me.
How you met your magic is almost exactly how I met mine.
In my case, the person I saved was an agent of the Time-Space Administration Bureau. That was well over fifty years ago...

Nanoha:
Oh, wow...

Graham:
Fate, you are Nanoha's friend, are you not?

Fate:
Yes.

Graham:
Then there is one thing I want you to promise me: that you will never betray your friends nor any of the people who believe in you so perfectly.
If you can do this, then I promise I will not put any limitations on you concerning your actions. Will you promise?

Fate:
Yes, sir, on my life.

Graham:
Hmm... That's a very good answer.

Chrono:
Admiral sir, I'm sure you're already aware of this but, we were just informed that we have been chosen to search for and investigate the Book of Darkness, a Lost Logia.

Graham:
So, you'll do the mission, eh. I don't think I have the right to say this but, don't be reckless.

Chrono:
We'll be all right, sir.
"In times of crisis, calm is your biggest friend."
That's exactly what you taught us, Admiral.

Graham:
Yes. Well, I suppose I did say that.

Chrono:
Thank you, sir.

Shamal:
Hayate. Come on in, your bath is ready.

Hayate:
Yeah. Thanks a lot.

Shamal:
Vita, too. Why don't you two take a bath together?

Vita:
Sure.

Signum:
We're leaving for the hospital early tomorrow. Be sure you don't stay up too late.

Hayate:
Okay.

Shamal:
Well, here we go then. Signum, what are you going to do about your bath?

Signum:
I'll pass tonight. I'll take mine in the morning.

Shamal:
You sure?

Vita:
But I thought you really loved bath.

Signum:
Sometimes, I just don't feel like it.

Hayate:
Then I'll go on ahead.

Signum:
Yeah.

Zafira:
It's the battle, isn't it?

Signum:
You're very sharp. That's exactly it.

Zafira:
It pierced through your armor?

Signum:
The path of the blade was pure. She must have learned from a great master.
If not for the difference in weapon quality, I might've had a harder time.

Zafira:
Perhaps, even still you would never have lost her.

Signum:
Yes, that's true.

Hayate:
Thank you, Shamal. That feels really nice.

Shamal:
That's good. I'm glad you like it.

Hayate:
This is paradise.

Signum:
We... are the Wolkenritters. On the pride of the Guardian Knights...

Lindy:
Oh, hello, Miss Fate.

Fate:
Hi, Admiral Lindy.

Nanoha:
Huh? Family? Miss Lindy and Fate?

Amy:
Yup. I mean nothing has been set in stone yet, but they're definitely talking about doing an adoption.
Because of what happened to Precia, Fate is all alone in this world. The Captain asked her if she would consider becoming her child.
Fate had all sorts of concerns about Precia and stuff. For the time being, we're just gonna give her feelings a chance to settle down.

Nanoha:
Oh, I see...

Amy:
How do you feel about that, Nanoha?

Nanoha:
Huh? Well, I think that it's a very good idea.

Amy:
Good.

Nanoha:
Now, if Captain Lindy adopts Fate, then that means Chrono'll become a big brother, right?

Amy:
That's right. But, they seem to get along fairy well, so I think that'll make a pretty nice brother and sister.

Lindy:
Chrono.

Chrono:
Captain. So you're with her, Fate?

Fate:
Yeah.

Lindy:
The research materials for this case, have you read them?

Chrono:
Yes. I've read it all.

Fate:
Nanoha's world seems to be located right in the center of this serial mage assaults.

Lindy:
Right. It is strictly limited to an area reachable by personal teleports from Nanoha's world.

Chrono:
The problem is that the area is pretty far from Headquarters. We can't teleport without using a relay port.

Fate:
It's disappointing we can't use the Arthra.

Chrono:
It would be nice if there was an open ship that we could use...

Fate:
They said that none of the ships that can offer it for long periods of time are available.

Chrono:
I see... So what about you, Fate? Are you all right with this?

Fate:
Huh? With what?

Chrono:
Even though you're contacted with us, you're still an outsider who's here to help.You have no obligation to keep up with us in this case.

Fate:
Chrono, you and Admiral Lindy are on a real bind, and I'm not just gonna run off and leave you like this.
Alf says that she feels the same way. So let us help.

Chrono:
Yeah. I feel grateful about it, but...

Lindy:
Well, I guess we have to use it after all!

Fate:
It?

Lindy:
Now then, we, the staff and crew of the Arthra, have been assigned to investigate the serial mage assault case, and to conduct a thorough search for the Book of Darkness, a Lost Logia.
However, our ship the Arthra is out of commission for a while. So we will be setting up a temporary operations base near the site of the incidents.
Alex and Randy, you are in charge of the observation staff.

Alex, Randy:
Yes, ma'am!

Lindy:
Investigation crew, your leader this time will be Garret.

Investigation crew:
Yes, ma'am!

Lindy:
The command post will be manned by Enforcer Chrono, Enforcer Aid Amy, myself, and Miss Fate. We will work in three rotating shifts.
And in order to conduct our mission while securing Miss Nanoha's safety, we will locate the command base near Miss Nanoha's house.

Nanoha:
Amazing! This is really close to home!

Fate:
Really?

Nanoha:
Mm-hm. You see? That's it right over there.

Amy:
Huh? Yuno and Alf? You have to look like this when you're in this world?

Alf:
I'm a puppy! It's my new form!

Yuno:
Yeah, I have to be in this form whenever I'm in front of Nanoha and Fate's friends.

Amy:
You guys sure have to go through a lot of trouble.

Fate:
Alf, oh my Gosh, you're so tiny. What happened to you?

Nanoha:
Yuno, it's been a while since I last saw you as a ferret.

Alf:
Aren't I cute?

Fate:
Yeah!

Chrono:
Nanoha, Fate. Your friends are here.

Nanoha, Fate:
Yeah?

Suzuka:
Hi, everyone!

Arisa:
We're here!

Nanoha:
Welcome, Arisa and Suzuka.

Arisa:
Nice to meet you, Fate. It sounds strange to say it.

Suzuka:
We've seen each other so many times in all the video mail.

Fate:
Yeah. But, it's nice to meet you for real, Arisa and Suzuka.

Arisa:
Yeah!

Suzuka:
Same here!

Lindy:
Miss Fate, are these your friends?

Arisa, Suzuka:
Oh, hello!

Lindy:
Hello and welcome. You must be Suzuka and Arisa?

Arisa:
Yes.

Suzuka:
You mean you know about us?

Lindy:
Of course! I've seen the video mail, too.

Arisa:
I see.

Lindy:
How about all of us go have some tea together?

Nanoha:
Yeah, we can all go over to my place.

Lindy:
Wonderful! I can take this opportunity to sit and visit with your family again, Miss Nanoha. Hold on.

Suzuka:
I think she's very pretty.

Arisa:
Is that your mom, Fate?

Fate:
Well? She's a... She's not my mom yet.

Suzuka:
Yuno, I haven't seen you in a long time.

Arisa:
Hmm... you know, I think I've seen you somewhere before, but I can't put my finger on it. Maybe it just mean...

Lindy:
We had to relocate, so starting today, we're going to be neighbors for a while. I just wanted to let you know.

Momoko:
Oh, wow! Welcome to the neighborhood then!

Shiro:
Please come by anytime. Fate is in the third grade like Nanoha, right? Do you know where she'll be going to school?

Lindy:
Yes. Actually...

Fate:
Excuse me, Admi... ah, I mean Lindy.

Lindy:
Yes. What is it, Fate?

Fate:
This is... ah... this is...

Lindy:
I already sent the paperwork to the school, so starting next week, you're classmates with Miss Nanoha.

Momoko:
Oh, how wonderful!

Shiro:
Seishou Elementary School, huh? That is a terrific school. Right, Nanoha?

Nanoha:
Yeah!

Momoko:
Congratulations. You're gonna love it.

Fate:
Well... umm... I mean... Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.

Chrono:
The most important characteristic of the Lost Logia, Book of Darkness, is in its source of energy.
The Book of Darkness literally eats Linker Cores to absorb a mage's magical powers and potential.

Amy:
Do you think that Nanoha's Linker Core was one of the victims?

Chrono:
Yeah. No doubt about it.
When the Book of Darkness eats a Linker Core, the number of pages increases according to the amount of magical powers and potentials that were absorbed.
And then when every last page is filled out, the Book of Darkness will be complete.

Amy:
When it's completed, what will happen?

Chrono:
At the very least, there won't be anything good about it.

Signum:
They're here.

Vita:
Yeah.

Shamal:
The Administration Bureau is starting to seriously make some moves.
So things won't go like they have been so far.

Signum:
I guess we're going to have to travel a bit further. We'll absorb powers in other worlds.

Vita:
How many pages have we completed as of now?

Shamal:
Let's see... Three hundred and forty pages. We got quite a few thanks to that girl in white the other day.

Vita:
All right! We're over half-way done with this book. Let's hurry up and grab the rest fast before they know what hit them.
Let's finish this thing quickly, so we can all go and live quiet lives together with Hayate.

Zafira:
Let's go. We don't have much time left.

Signum:
Right. Let's go, Levantine!

Levantine:
Ziehen.

Shamal:
Klarwind, guide me!

Klarwind:
Anfang.

Vita:
Let's do it, Graf Eisen!

Graf Eisen:
Bewegung.

Shamal:
All right. we'll all be back here again right before dawn.

Signum:
Vita, don't get too hot-headed, all right?

Vita:
Fine. I won't.

Amy:
Oh? Hello, this is Amy. What can I do for you?

Marie:
Oh, Miss Amy. This is Marie from the Main Office Maintenance Staff, sorry to bother you.

Amy:
That's okay. Is something wrong?

Marie:
It's about those two Intelligent Devices that you entrusted me with before you left. They're acting kind of strange...

Amy:
Eh?

Marie:
We're done with all the repairs and part-exchanges that were called for, but the error codes don't seem to wanna go away.

Amy:
Error code? Which type?

Marie:
Umm... They say that they still lack necessary parts. I'll send you the data right now.

Amy:
Ah, here it is. Huh? The missing part is... what!?

Marie:
Yeah... ah.. this is some kind of mistake, right?
Both the Devices are stuck on this message, and won't accept any commands no matter what we tried.
So we're in kind of a bind...

Amy:
Raising Heart, Bardiche... Are you serious?
CVK-792... A Velka-style Cartridge System!?

Nanoha:
Fate's transfer and a new battle!

Fate:
All my preparations for both are complete.

Nanoha:
Both Raising Heart and Bardiche came back safe and sound but... Huh!? Is this!?

Fate:
On the next episode of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's, it's episode four.

Nanoha:
New Power, Start!

Nanoha, Fate:
Drive Ignition!
