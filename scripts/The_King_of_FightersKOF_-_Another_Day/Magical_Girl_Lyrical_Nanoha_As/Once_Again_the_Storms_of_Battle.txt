Nanoha:
It was a very small wish. What I wished for were peaceful days. What awaited me, was a reunion with the dear friend that lived far away.
But, what visited was a sudden attacker. Rendezvous, battle, a giant power... Destiny begins to move swiftly and quietly.
Even in the storm, believing in the bonds that tied our hearts together. Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's is about to begin.

Arisa:
Oh, I see. So that's what it was.

Suzuka:
Yeah. Right, and then...

Arisa:
Yeah? Yeah? You know, I think I'm really starting to look forward to meeting Fate.

Suzuka:
You are? Me, too. But imagine that you and I are looking forward to seeing her this much, Nanoha's got to be even more enthusiastic and excited about her coming, because she's already created so many memories of Fate.

Arisa:
You're right. When she heard that Fate was gonna come here, Nanoha seemed happier than I'd seen in a long time.

Suzuka:
Yeah!

Arisa:
Hey, I've got a great idea. Let's think of something special to welcome Fate.

Suzuka:
Oh, that sounds good!

Arisa:
Yeah, we'll have a blast.

Suzuka:
Whose house do you think we should hold it in?

Arisa:
Hmm... how about the Midoriya cafe?

Nanoha:
Once Again, the Storms of Battle.

Fate:
Magical attacks on civilians... This is a lot more than a mere felony.

Vita:
What the hell are you anyway? A mage from the Administration Bureau?

Fate:
Space-Time Administration Bureau, part-time mage, my name is Fate Testarossa.
If you don't resist us, you'll have the right to defend yourself before a judge. If you're willing to cooperate, then disarm yourself.

Vita:
What idiot would do that?

Fate:
Yuno, please take care of Nanoha.

Yuno:
Got it, Fate.

Nanoha:
Oh, Yuno...

Yuno:
Yeah.
Fate's trial ended and everyone was trying to contact you to tell you, Nanoha.
But we couldn't reach you no matter what we tried, and then when we looked over at the Bureau, there was a wide-range barrier set up.
And we knew there was trouble. That's why we all came here as fast as we could.

Nanoha:
I see. I'm sorry, and thank you.

Yuno:
Who is that, Nanoha? And why is she after you?

Nanoha:
I don't know... She seemed to come out of nowhere.

Yuno:
But you're gonna be all right now. Fate and I are both here. And Alf's here, too.

Nanoha:
Miss Alf's here, too?

Fate:
Now, Bardiche.

Bardiche:
Arc Saber.

Vita:
Graf Eisen!

Graf Eisen:
Schwalbefliegen.

Vita:
I need a wall!

Graf Eisen:
Panzerhindernis.

Alf:
Barrier.... Break!

Vita:
Damn you!

Graf Eisen:
Pferde.

Vita:
I need to take magical power back with me. I've only got two cartridges left... Can I do it?

Nanoha:
I can't believe Miss Alf came here, too.

Yuno:
Chrono and everyone on the Arthra are mobilizing for us, too, putting their maitenance on hold.

Amy:
Alex, have you figured out how to pull the barrier away yet?

Alex:
Almost. The analysis is nearly complete.

Chrono:
The equations are different. There's no way this is a Midchilda-style barrier.

Amy:
Where's this magic coming from? I've never seen anything like it, ever.

Vita:
Damn!

Fate:
It's all over. So now you're gonna give me your name, the world you're from and the motive for all of this.

Alf:
I'm getting a really awful feeling about this, Fate!

Vita:
Thanks, Signum.

Signum:
Levantine, Cartridge Load now.

Levantine:
Explosion.

Signum:
Direct Lightning Flash!

Bardiche:
Defenser.

Alf:
Oh no, Fate! Damn you!

Nanoha:
Fate is in big trouble. And so is Miss Alf.

Yuno:
This isn't good. I have to help them.
Strange echoes of darkness, turn into light. Center within it, circle of magical healing, the protection of steel.
It's barrier magic that heals you while it protects you. Whatever you do, don't step outside of here.

Signum:
What's wrong, Vita? Were you caught off guard?

Vita:
You shut up! I was just about to turn the situation around!

Signum:
Oh, I see. I guess I got in your way. I apologize, Miss.
But please don't go too far out on a limb. If you get injured, our master will be upset with the both of us.

Vita:
Jeez! I know that, okay? Man...

Signum:
By the way, you dropped this.

Vita:
Huh?

Signum:
I repaired all of the damage that I could find.

Vita:
Yeah, well... Thanks, Signum.

Signum:
For all intents and purposes, this is a three-on-three battle. If it were one-on-one, there's no way the Knights of the Velka...

Vita:
Would ever lose this fight!
What? The Book of Darkness... It's gone!

Yuno:
Are you all right?

Fate:
Yeah... I'm fine. Thanks, Yuno.

Yuno:
Bardiche, too?

Fate:
No, it's all right. The main body's still safe.

Bardiche:
Recovery.

Fate:
Yuno, do you think you can transport everyone out of this barrier simultaneously?

Yuno:
Yeah. If I can get some help from Alf... I think.

Fate:
I've got to try and take a step forward. So I need for you to take care of that, okay?

Yuno:
You got it.

Fate:
Are you fine with that, Alf?

Alf:
It's gonna be tough, but I'll find a way to make do!

Fate:
Let's do our best, all right, Yuno?

Yuno:
Got it.

Nanoha:
Be careful, Fate...


Hayate:
Okay...
Yagami residence.

Shamal:
Oh, Hayate? Hi, umm... ah... this is Shamal.

Hayate:
Oh, what's wrong?

Shamal:
I'm terribly sorry but, I couldn't find the usual olive oil you like to use. I'm gonna go look for it in a supermarket that's slightly further away than I planned.

Hayate:
Oh, that's all rihgt. Don't worry about it. Don't go out of your way.

Shamal:
While I'm out, I'll go and pick everyone up before heading home.

Hayate:
Okay.

Shamal:
I'm so sorry that I can't be there right now to help you with all of the cooking.

Hayate:
It's fine, really.

Shamal:
I'll try to get back home just as soon as I can.

Hayate:
Look, you don't have to hurry. Just be careful.

Shamal:
Yes, I will.
All right. I really have to try and finish this as soon as possible. Klarwind, guide me, please.

Klarwind:
Ja. Pendelform.

Bardiche:
Photon Lancer.

Signum:
Levantine, my armor.

Levantine:
Panzergeist.

Fate:
Shoot thorough it! Fire!

Signum:
Your sense as a mage is not bad. But in order to challenge a Velka Knight with duel and expect to survive, that is not enough!
Levantine, slam the blade!

Levantine:
Jawohl.

Nanoha:
Oh my Gosh, Fate!

Yuno:
I can prepare the transport, but I can't break through this special barrier... Alf!

Alf:
I'm trying on this end, too! But this barrier is incredibly hard!

Levantine:
Nachladen.

Fate:
It's that thing... that bullet. They're temporarily increasing macical power with it.

Signum:
Is that it? And just stay where you are. If you don't resist, maybe we won't take your life.

Fate:
Who would do that?

Signum:
Good fighting spirits. I'm a Velka Knight, leader of the Wolkenritters. I am Signum, and the name of my sword, is Levantine!
Now, what is your name?

Fate:
I'm a mage from Midchilda, with the Time-Space Administration Bureau. I'm Fate Testarossa, and this here is Bardiche.

Sigunum:
Fate Testarossa... and a staff name Bardiche...

Nanoha:
I have to save them... They need my help. I have to go save everyone...

Raising Heart:
Master.
Shooting Mode, acceleration.

Nanoha:
Wait, Raising Heart, what are you doing?

Raising Heart:
Let's shoot it, Starlight Breaker.

Nanoha:
Raising Heart!? That's impossible in your current condition!

Raising Heart:
I can be shot.

Nanoha:
That magic is a way too big of a burden for you. I'm afraid if you try, you'll be damaged forever!

Raising Heart:
I believe master. Trust me, my master.

Nanoha:
If you're gonna believe in me, Raising Heart, then I'm gonna believe in you, too.
Fate, Yuno, Alf, I'm gonna destroy the barrier, so get yourselves synched at the teleport!

Yuno:
Nanoha!

Alf:
Nanoha, what are you doing?

Nanoha:
It's okay. I'll shoot it with the Starlight Breaker.
Begin the count-down, Raising Heart!

Raising Heart:
All right.
Count 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3...

Nanoha:
Are you all right, Raising Heart? Speak to me.

Raising Heart:
No problem. Count 3, 2, 1...

Fate:
What the... Nanoha?

Shamal:
Oh no, I missed! I'd better try one more time.

Fate:
Nanoha!

Shamal:
Linker Core, captured. Begin assimilation now.

Book of Darkness:
Sammlung.

Raising Heart:
Count 0.

Nanoha:
All right, Raising Heart. Here we go.
Starlight Breaker!

Crew:
The barrier has been broken!

We have in-coming visual!

Amy:
W-what is this!? What condition are they in?

Chrono:
Wait, this is... I think they're...

Signum:
The barrier has been pierced. We need to go.

Zafira:
Understood.

Vita:
I'm sorry, Shamal. You saved me.

Shamal:
Let's split up for now. We'll regroup later at the usual place.

Amy:
Oh no! I'm loosing them! Hurry with the coordinate lock! The path of their teleports!

Crew:
I'm doing my best!

Chrono:
Ah, that's the...!

Lindy:
This isn't good! Hurry up and get a medic ship there fast!

Crew:
I've got data from the relay transfer port! It's opening!

Lindy:
And alert the medical facilities in Headquarters to be ready as well!

Crew:
Roger.

It's no good! We lost the lock!

Amy:
Oh, no! I'm sorry Chrono... I'm sorry. We screwed up. Say something...

Chrono:
It's a class one search-specified lost item, Lost Logia, Book of Darkness...

Amy:
What is it, Chrono? Do you know about it?

Chrono:
Yeah... I know a little... I've read some about it. We have a long-standing grudge against it.

Amy:
This case is one where a mystery's bringing more mysteries. Its roots run very deep.

Alf:
But Nanoha and Fate finally get to see each other again.

Amy:
Oh yes, that's right. There's one more good thing.

Alf:
Next episode of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's, it's episode three.

Amy:
Reunion and Relocation!
Lyrical Magical, We'll do our best!
