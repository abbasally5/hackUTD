Nanoha:
It was a very small wish.

Fate:
Our days begin anew.

Nanoha:
What we decided was that we will never give up fighting.

Fate:
What we sworn was to become stronger than yesterday.

Nanoha:
So that we can stand up against the destiny that has started to move.

Fate:
So that we never hurt the people dear to us again.

Nanoha:
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's is about to begin.


Hayate:
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I wake you up?

Signum:
Huh? No.

Hayate:
You should sleep properly on a bed. Otherwise you'll catch a cold.

Signum:
I-I'm sorry.

Hayate:
Signum, were you up late again last night?

Signum:
Yeah. But just... a little bit.

Hayate:
Oh, Signum. Here.

Signum:
Huh?

Hayate:
It's hot milk. It'll warm you right up.

Signum:
You're very kind, Miss Hayate.

Hayate:
I have some for you too, Zafira. Come on over here.

Shamal:
I'm so sorry, Hayate. I overslept.

Hayate:
Oh, good morning.

Shamal:
Good morning. Oh, Jeez. I'm really sorry about this, Hayate.

Hayate:
It's okay.

Vita:
Good morning, everybody...

Hayate:
Wow. You look really sleepy, Vita.

Vita:
Sleepy...

Shamal:
Jeez, you should go and wash your face.

Vita:
Ah... after I drink some milk...

Shamal:
Here.

Signum:
So warm...

Teacher:
Now everyone, please pay attention. I know this is quite sudden, but I would like to introduce a new student at this school who will be joining our class as of today.
This young lady comes to us from overseas. Please welcome Miss Fate.

Fate:
E-Excuse me.
Well... umm... hi, my name is Fate Testarossa. It's very nice to meet you all.

Nanoha:
Fate...

Nanoha:
New Power, Start!


Student:
Hey, what is school like where you come from, huh?

Fate:
School? Oh well, you see, I...

Student:
Hey Fate, wasn't that a really sudden transfer?

Fate:
Oh, yeah. There were all sorts of things...

Student:
You're really good at Japanese. Where did you learn how to speak it?

Student:
What kind of a place did you live before you came here?

Fate:
Oh, well... I mean I... I don't...

Suzuka:
Fate's popular. Everyone loves her.

Nanoha:
You know, all of this might get to be a bit tough to manage...

Arisa:
Huh, I guess I have no choice...
All right, guys! She's a transfer student. And this is her first day of school, so don't toss her around like a rag doll.

Fate:
Arisa...

Arisa:
And you gotta ask questions one at a time. Everyone's shouting is confusing her.

Student:
Okay. Then I'll start the questions.

Arisa:
Fine. Go ahead.

Student:
What are schools like where you come from?

Fate:
Huh? It was... a lot different where I came from. I didn't go to ordinary school. I had lots and lots of tutors, or at least people that seem [that way] to teach me.

Student:
Oh, I see.

Student:
Okay, okay. Let me ask next.

Arisa:
No! Wait a minute! I said wait!

Letty:
Chrono, how is everything at the outpost?

Chrono:
We finished carrying in all the machinery. Right now, we're just trying to get the main network up.

Letty:
Good. We were able to get you command one entire company of armed agents as you requested, thanks to a good word put in by Admiral Graham, and a lot of begging.

Chrono:
Thank you, Admiral Letty. I really appreciate it.

Letty:
By the way, all the familiars over with Admiral Graham have expressed their desire to see you again. They want to see their cute apprentice.

Chrono:
You mean Lieze and those guys? Well then... maybe you should just treat them as you see fit.

Amy:
Oh hey, Chrono. How's it going over there?

Chrono:
We were able to get one entire company of armed agents. We'll have them help with our investigation. And you?

Amy:
Not so good... We lost another one yesterday.
In a world a bit further away than the previous ones. A dozen or so mages, and about four wild animals.

Chrono:
What kind of animals?

Amy:
Enormous creatures, with high powers.
Apparently, they'll go after anything, as long as it has a Linker Core.

Chrono:
So it doesn't care what its target is.

Amy:
I looked up the data available for the Book of Darkness. It's mind-burgling.
A Lost Logia that builds up magical power, eating Linker Cores that serve as the source of magical power for mages, and increasing its number of pages.

Chrono:
When all 666 pages of the Book are finally filled, it will use its stored magical power to reveal its true nature.
A power's so enormous. That will affect many dimensions.

Amy:
And, if the Book cover's destroyed, or the owner of it dies, all the pages turn blank, and the whole thing starts over in a different world, again.

Chrono:
It has wandered across all sorts of worlds, protected by the Guardians that it has created for itself, eating magical power to live forever.
Even if we find some way to destroy it, it will just keep on recreating itself over and over again.

Amy:
That is the Book of Darkness... So the only thing we can do is to capture the Book before it's completed?

Chrono:
That's right. We have to go and capture those Guardian Knights, and then, we have to drag their master out into the open.

Suzuka:
Fate, tell me. What did you think of your first day at school?

Fate:
This is the first time I've ever been around so many people that are my own age. It's almost making my head spin.

Arisa:
Well, I'm sure you'll get used to it really soon.

Fate:
Yeah. I really hope you're right.

Shamal:
All right. Signum, I'm trusting you to escort Hayate to the hospital, okay?

Signum:
Yeah. Both Vita and Zafira... left?

Shamal:
They're already gone.

Signum:
Cartridges, huh?

Shamal:
Yeah. I have to make the new ones we need during the day.

Signum:
I'm so sorry. You always have to handle everything alone.

Shamal:
Backing you guys up is my job. Don't worry about it.

Student:
Rise. Bow.

Teacher:
Goodbye. See you tomorrow.

Student:
Bye bye!

Bye!

Chrono:
The investigation is going well. I want you and Fate to live normal lives until we request your assistance.
Nanoha, you don't have your magical power back, and both Raising Heart and Bardiche are being repaired.
In emergencies, please evacuate without complaints.
PS; I heard the repairs of the two Devices will be done by next week.
PPS; I would like you to tell Fate that she's free to take detours on her way home from school, but we'd like her to be home by dinner time.

Dr. Ishida:
Hmm... your test results aren't quite as good as I would have expected. Hmm...
Now then, the good news is we don't see any side-effect. So would you like to continue this treatment for a while?

Hayate:
Yes. I mean... it's up to you.

Dr. Ishida:
You're leaving it up to me? Hmm... This is about you, so can you try to be a bit more serious and thinking about it?

Hayate:
Oh, well, ah... It's just... that I really believe in you, Doctor.

Dr. Ishida:
How is Hayate in her daily day life?

Signum:
Except for the paralysis in her legs, she's perfectly fit.

Dr. Ishida:
Look, I know this whole thing has been really tough on all of you, but I want you to know that we're doing our very best.

Signum:
I know.

Dr. Ishida:
For now, we're going to focus on slowing down the progress of the paralysis as much as possible.

Nurse:
Are you all right?

Hayate:
Oh, I'm fine, thank you.

Nurse:
All right, then...

Hayate:
Bye.

Nurse:
Bye.

Dr. Ishida:
To do that, we might have to start tougher treatments that involve hospitalization.

Signum:
Right. I'll talk to Hayate about it later.


Suzuka:
Sorry for [xxx] earlier.

Arisa:
Bye, we'll see tomorrow.

Fate:
Yeah. See you tomorrow.

Nanoha:
Bye bye!

Fate:
Hey, Nanoha. What do you think about those guys?

Nanoha:
You mean the ones that have... the Book of Darkness?

Fate:
Yeah. The Guardian Knights. What do you think about them?

Nanoha:
Let's see... the whole attack really took me by surprise and I was defeated so quickly, I didn't understand much of anything.
But you had some sort of conversation with that swordswoman, right, Fate?

Fate:
Yeah. And it really was the strange feeling. It's hard to put into words, but I just didn't feel like there was anything evil about her.

Nanoha:
I see. It would be really nice if they could tell me the reason why they're aiming for the completion of the Book of Darkness.
But it doesn't look like we can sit down and have a conversation...

Fate:
When you solidify yourself with strong will, it's hard for words from outside people to reach inside you. I know, because I was like that.
I did things for mother's sake, no matter how much she hurt me, no matter how much I thought I was doing wrong, and no matter how much doubt I had.
And while I was trying to believe that I was absolutely doing the right thing despite my feelings, I couldn't hear anybody else's words.
But, to speak to someone honestly and to deliver your feelings is never a waste of time.
For my mother's sake, and for my own sake, I had tried to believe in her so much, but I was shaken by the words that you spoke to me.
If you need to fight and win in order for your words to be delivered, if that's the way things are then, I can fight for you without hesitation.

Nanoha:
Oh, Fate...

Fate:
Nanoha, you are the one that taught me, you and your strong heart.

Nanoha:
I... I don't really think it's all that strong.

Fate:
I will become stronger, so I can plunge through how I feel.

Nanoha:
Good. I will become stronger, too. I'm gonna do my best in every way. Let's both do our best, all right, Fate?

Fate:
Yeah. Let's do our best.

Suzuka:
Oh, Hayate!

Hayate:
Oh. Hi, Suzuka.
Suzuka, what did you get today?

Suzuka:
Well, it's a nursery tale. But it's the book that somehow touches your heart when you read it.

Hayate:
Oh, I like nursery tales, too. That sounds interesting.

Suzuka:
Would you like to read it? [There's] one still on the shelf.

Hayate:
Yeah. I can read it later.

Suzuka:
I can't believe you like nursery tales, too, Hayate.

Hayate:
Yeah. I really love them. What kind of story is it?

Suzuka:
That's for you to read and find out.

Zafira:
Book of Darkness... assimilate.

Book of Darkness:
Sammlung.

Zafira:
That thing just now was three pages...

Vita:
Damn it. It's got such a huge body, and yet the quality of its Linker Core was low. Though, it is easier than facing a mage and the results show up faster.
Let's go onto the next one, Zafira.

Zafira:
Vita, you're going on without resting?

Vita:
I'm fine. I'm a Knight. I'm not so weak that battles of this level tire me out.

Nanoha:
Thank you very much, Doctor.

Yuno:
Nanoha!

Alf:
How did the test results go?

Nanoha:
I'm fully healed!

Fate:
Fully healed over here, too.

Amy:
Really? I'm so glad! Where are you?

Yuno:
We're almost to the second relay port. Our ETA to you should be about ten minutes.

Amy:
Great. I'll see you when you get in. I can give you the whole rundown on Raising Heart and Bardiche.
Oh, this isn't good! Emergency situation at close range!

Lindy:
Hmm...

Armed agent:
Ma'am, we've located two of the targets in the skies above the city center.
Currently, they're fighting inside one of the fortified barriers.

Lindy:
They are extremely tough. Avoid direct combat, strengthen and maintain the barrier from outside.

Armed agent:
Roger.

Lindy:
The Enforcer will be on site soon!

Zafira:
The Administration Bureau...

Vita:
Yeah... but these guys are nothing. We can take 'em down!
Huh?

Zafira:
Above us!

Vita:
Huh?

Chrono:
Stinger Blade Execution Shift, now!
Did some of them... go through...?

Vita:
Zafira!

Zafira:
Don't worry, Vita. I'm not so weak that something of this level... will put me down!

Vita:
All right.

Amy:
All armed agents have taken their positions. Do you copy that, Chrono?

Chrono:
Roger!

Amy:
And just now, we've delivered the powerful helpers to the site!

Chrono:
Nanoha! Fate!

Vita:
Those guys...

Nanoha:
Now, Raising Heart!

Fate:
Now, Bardiche!

Nanoha, Fate:
Set up!

Raising Heart:
Order of the setup was accepted.

Bardiche:
Operating check of the new system has started.

Raising Heart:
Exchange parts are in good condition, completely cleared from the...

Nanoha:
W-What is this?

Fate:
Something's changed. It's different!

Amy:
Both of you, calm down and listen carefully. Both of Raising Heart and Bardiche have brand new systems on board.

Nanoha:
Brand new systems? But why!?

Amy:
They chose, Miss Nanoha, at their own will, with their own feelings.
Now both of you, call out to them, with their new name!

Bardiche:
Condition, all green. Get set.

Raising Heart:
Standby, ready.

Nanoha:
Now, Raising Heart Exelion!

Fate:
Execute now, Bardiche Assault!

Raising Heart, Bardiche:
Drive Ignition.

Vita:
Those Devices they have... Are they what I think they are!?

Bardiche:
Assault Form, cartridge set.

Raising Heart:
Accel Mode, standby ready.


Nanoha:
Raising Heart and Bardiche have undergone an amazing power-up.
Now, we can fight with full strength and full power!

Fate:
From among that fiery storms of battle, the truth about the girls becomes apparent.

Nanoha:
It was one of a silent past, and a sad destiny...

Fate:
On the next Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's, it's episode five.

Nanoha:
It Was a Small Wish (Part1).

Nanoha, Fate:
Drive Ignition!
