Hayate:
It was a very small wish. Everyday life when nothing happens. Each day gently continuing on to the next.
I'm not going to wish for anything. I'm not going to seek any power.
I just wanted to be at my side. That way, I will be able to protect everyone.
There are times when my feelings cross each other. But, even then...
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's is about to begin.


Announcement:
Welcome customers, welcome to Mikuniya Supermarket.
Today's service items are ingredients for a hot pot full of stamina to overcome the cold winter.
In this special corner of the store, we have all sorts of items on sale.
Also, the meat department's holding a pork fair! Pork is a healthy meat that is very nutritious.
In our time-limited service, we have some items at half price. We invite you to buy them today.

Hayate:
You know, lately it seems like everyone's always out somewhere and they're hardly ever home anymore.

Shamal:
Ah, well... umm... you know, I... I wonder why that is.

Hayate:
Don't worry. It's no big deal. I mean I really don't mind it at all.
If all of you have things that you want to do outside of the house then, that's just fine with me.

Shamal:
Hayate, don't...

Hayate:
I was all alone to begin with, so I'm pretty used to it.

Shamal:
Hayate, really, everything's all right. It's just that everyone's been kind of busy lately.
But I'm sure everything will be back to normal real soon.

Hayate:
You know what, Shamal? If you say so, then I know it must be true.
Suzuka's going to come by for dinner tonight. Do you think this much meat is enough?

Shamal:
Yes.

Hayate:
It's cold outside. So we should have a nice hot pot tonight.

Shamal:
Okay.

Hayate:
I wonder if everyone else is feeling cold outside...

Nanoha:
It Was a Small Wish (Part 1).


Signum:
They deployed a fortified entrapment barrier. Vita's group must have been trapped inside.

Levantine:
WÃ¤hlen Sie Aktion.

Signum:
Now, Levantine. Is your master the kind of Knight that will pull back in this situation?

Levantine:
Nein.

Signum:
Yes, that's right, Levantine. You and I have always done it this way.

Fate:
We didn't come here to fight against you. We came here to talk to you. At least let us hear what you have to say.

Nanoha:
The reason why you're trying to complete the Book of Darkness.

Vita:
You know, there's an old Velka proverb that comes to mind at times like this.
"A spear waits not for the messenger of peace."
It means no idiot in the world is gonna bring a weapon with them when all they want to do is just talk things out! You idiots!

Nanoha:
The girl who suddenly started attacking without giving so much as a word of warning is saying that!?

Zafira:
By the way, that's not a proverb, it's a punch line from a funny short story.

Vita:
Shut up! The details aren't important, okay?

Fate:
That was Signum!

Nanoha:
Yuno! Chrono! I don't want you to get involved in this! I'm gonna fight with that girl one-on-one!

Chrono:
Is she serious!?

Yuno:
Yeah, she's serious.

Fate:
Alf. Just me... against her.

Alf:
Yeah. I have a bit of talking to do with this certain guy myself.

Chrono:
Yuno, this makes matters easy. The two of us should split up and search for the master of the Book of Darkness.

Yuno:
The Book of Darkness?

Chrono:
Those guys don't have it, which means that at least one more comrade or the master are looking around here somewhere.
I'll search outside the barrier, so you'll search inside.

Yuno:
All right.

Raising Heart:
Master, please call me "Cartridge Load".

Nanoha:
Sure. Now, Raising Heart, Cartridge Load!

Raising Heart:
Load Cartridge.

Bardiche:
Sir.

Fate:
Mm. Same goes for me. Bardiche, Cartridge Load, right now!

Bardiche:
Load Cartridge.

Zafira:
They have learned how to strengthen their Devices. Be very careful, Vita.

Vita:
That goes without saying!
Huh, so you're going to come fight with me after all?

Nanoha:
If I win, I'm gonna make you tell me your whole story, you got that?

Vita:
If you think you can... then try!

Graf Eisen:
Schwalbefliegen.

Raising Heart:
Accel Fin.

Vita:
Eisen!

Graf Eisen:
Explosion. Raketenform.

Raising Heart:
Protection Powered.

Vita:
It's so hard...

Nanoha:
Wow, she's right.

Raising Heart:
Barrier Burst.
Let's shoot it, Accel Shooter.

Nanoha:
Mm. Accel Shooter!

Raising Heart:
Accel Shooter.

Nanoha:
Shoot!

Raising Heart:
Control, please.

Vita:
You're an idiot! There's no way you can control this many bullets all at one time!

Raising Heart:
It can be done, as for my master.

Nanoha:
It's a promise! If we win this fight, you're gonna sit down and tell us your situation! Accel!

Graf Eisen:
Panzerhindernis.

Nanoha:
Shoot!

Vita:
Damn you...!

Bardiche:
Plasma Lancer.

Fate:
Plasma Lancer... Fire!
Converge now!

Signum:
Levantine, now!

Levantine:
Sturmwinde.

Bardiche:
Blitz Rush.
Haken Form.

Levantine:
Schlangeform.

Signum:
Testarossa, you're very strong.

Levantine:
Schwertform.

Signum:
You, and your Bardiche.

Bardiche:
Thank you.

Fate:
Too you and your sword Levantine, Signum.

Levantine:
Danke.

Signum:
If there was nothing at this body needed to accomplish, then this battle would have my heart dance with joy.
However, for my friends and for my master, I can't say that for the time being.
I'm not sure I can guarantee that I wouldn't kill you. Would you please forgive me for my childish immaturity?

Fate:
That doesn't matter. Because I will be the one that wins.


Alf:
Hey, big thing! Which one of these guy's Familiar are you?

Zafira:
In Velka, beasts that serve Knights are not so [mostly] called Familiars.
The master's fang... and his shield, the Guardian Beasts!

Alf:
Those are the same thing, you stupid man!

Zafira:
The situation... doesn't look too pleasant.
I don't think Signum and Vita would lose, but I think I should pull back. Shamal, can you do anything?

Shamal:
I would like to do something, but the agents have been maintaining the barrier from outside.
I don't have enough power to break through. You need the magical power of Signum's Falken or Vita's Gigant to do that.

Zafira:
Since neither of them are free, I have no choice but to use... it.

Shamal:
I know what it is, but...!

Zafira:
Shamal! Shamal, what's wrong?

Chrono:
You're here by under arrest for suspicion of possessing and using a registered Lost Logia.

Lindy:
Excellent.

Amy:
Oh, right, Chrono! Way to go!

Chrono:
If you don't resist us, you'll have the right to defend yourself. If you're going to surrender, then disarm.
Another ally...?

Lindy:
Amy, what was that?

Amy:
I-I don't know! There was nothing about in the search results I've got. What is this? What's going on?

Shamal:
Wait, who are you?

Masked man:
Use it.

Shamal:
Huh?

Masked man:
Use the power of the Book to destroy the barrier.

Shamal:
But, it's way too late!

Masked man:
The used up pages can be added again. But it's too late if your comrades are defeated first.

Shamal:
Everyone, I'm going to shoot a cannon to destroy the barrier! Retreat if you want to avoid it.

Signum, Vita, Zafira:
Right!

Chrono:
Who are you? Are you another one of them? Answer me now!

Shamal:
Book of Darkness... your Guardian, Shamal, commands you.
Now to destroy my enemies, give me power.

Masked man:
Don't move! Be patient. It will be revealed in due time what the right answer is.

Chrono:
What!?

Shamal:
Please shoot, the Thunder of Destruction!

Book of Darkness:
Beschreiben.

Yuno:
Not good... individual defense!

Signum:
Sorry to say, Testarossa. We have to finish this another time.

Fate:
Signum, wait!

Vita:
I am a Wolkenritter. I'm Hammer Knight Vita. What is your name?

Nanoha:
Nanoha... Takamachi!

Vita:
Nanu Takuminu... Nanu... Damn it! It's hard to pronounce!

Nanoha:
Oh, short-tempered!?

Vita:
We'll settle the score next time! I'll make sure to kill you then! You can count on it!

Nanoha:
But... hey wait, come back, Vita.

Zafira:
Protect your friends! It's dangerous if any of this hits them directly.

Alf:
Huh? I don't understand.

Lindy:
What's the status!?

Amy:
It's a magical explosion! There are no physical damages!
But there are jamming at air waves, so the searchers and the radar...

Yuno:
Nanoha, Fate, Alf, are you all right?

Nanoha:
Yeah. Thanks a lot, Yuno. I'm fine. You too, Miss Alf?

Hayate:
Come over here.
You got really good cats, Suzuka. I think they're adorable.
Are you sure it's all right? I don't wanna feel like I'm barging in.

Suzuka:
Not at all. I'm happy that you came out here.
Oh, don't worry. I'll get it.

Shamal:
Hello? It's me, Shamal. Oh, Hayate. I'm really, really sorry about today.
I had thought it would end soon enough, but I couldn't quite meet up the others. And that's taking up our time.
Yes, well, I left my cell phone behind... Yes, I just came home. Yes. Yes. Everyone is together.
How do I apologize for something like this?

Hayate:
I'm really glad then. I'm not the least bit mad, Shamal. I'm fine, really. There's no need to apologize.
It was too lonely for Suzuka and I to put pots by ourselves, so Suzuka invited me to her place.
That's right. That's where I am. I was treated to dinner at Suzuka's house.
I have all ingredients cut up in the fridge, and the broth is already in the pot, so it should be ready to eat.
You guys should eat up!

Shamal:
Okay... I'm really sorry. Yes. Yes. Right, I'll switch to Vita.

Vita:
Hayate? Hello.

Signum:
I really feel bad. We made her feel so lonely.
By the way, who in the world was that strange man that came out of nowhere and saved you?

Shamal:
I honestly don't know. But at least he doesn't seem to be one of our enemies, and that's a big relief.

Signum:
The Administration Bureau is going to put an even bigger effort into stopping us now.

Shamal:
That cannon blast used the quite a few pages, too.

Signum:
And we don't have much time left, either.
As soon as possible, we must make our master Hayate into the true owner of the Book of Darkness.

Shamal:
Yeah, you're right.

Vita:
Signum, Hayate wants to speak to you.

Signum:
Sure.
Hello. This is Signum.

Amy:
The Cartridge System is very difficult to handle. It's usually not something that gets integrated into delicate Intelligent Devices like those two.
I told them that it would be dangerous as the risk of the main body being destroyed as high. But both of them insisted that we just had to do it.
They must have been really regretful that they weren't able to protect their masters, that they weren't able to fully live up to the trust that their masters have shown to them.

Nanoha:
Thank you for everything, Raising Heart.

Raising Heart:
All right.

Fate:
Thank you, Bardiche.

Bardiche:
Yes, sir.

Amy:
There're three modes for each of the Devices.
Raising Heart has the mid-range shooting of Accel Mode, the Buster cannon and the Full Drive of Excelion Mode.
Bardiche has the default Assault Mode, Haken the scythe, and the Full Drive Zamber Form.
There's the risk of complete destructions, so try not to use the Full Drive if you can. Especially you, Nanoha.

Nanoha:
Okay.

Amy:
Until we fortify the Device frames, you should never boot up Excelion Mode, okay?

Nanoha:
All right.

Lindy:
The problem here is their objective is rather strange.

Chrono:
Yeah. Something really doesn't quite fit.
It's even beginning to feel kinda like they're actually working as hard as they can for the completion of the Book of Darkness.

Alf:
Hmm? Is there something strange about that?
The Book of Darkness is something like a Jewel Seed, and people who want lots of power are willing to do anything to get it, right?
Then those guys are really doing all this for the sake of the person who wants that power for themselves.
The scenario isn't all that surprising.

Chrono:
You gotta understand, the power of the Book of Darkness isn't something that can be freely controlled like the Jewel Seeds.

Lindy:
Both before and after its completion, the power can only be used for destruction.
At least there haven't been any records of anyone using it for any other purpose, anywhere.

Alf:
Oh, right.

Chrono:
There's one other thing. Those Knights we fought... they are the Guardians of the Book of Darkness.
They're not human, nor they're familiars. They're quasi-humans created by magical technology to match the Book of Darkness.
They act only upon orders from the master. They're not much more than mere programs that do nothing unless told.


Nanoha:
Somehow, things are getting more and more complicated!

Fate:
Artificial lives... Destiny that has been determined. Where can you find the truth?

Nanoha:
It can be found in the past of the Knights.

Fate:
On the next Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's, it's episode six.

Nanoha:
It Was a Small Wish (Part 2).

Nanoha, Fate:
Drive Ignition!
