Nanoha:
It was probably a strong bond that once united them.
But the relationship of the master and servant that should be strong is now a sad chain that binds them together.
It's a harsh reality, covered with the cold wounds of both the recent and distant past...
The magic in my hand... it has the power to pierce through sadness, and tears.
I will definitely save you... So please... don't cry anymore.
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's is about to begin.


Arisa:
Is this... the school?

Suzuka:
I think so.

Nanoha:
What happened, Amy?

Amy:
I'm looking into it! I'm picking up Fate's vital signs. She is alive! But she's trapped in the inter-dimension of the Book of Darkness.
I'm now working on how we're gonna bring her back!

Will of the Book of Darkness:
Now she and my master both, will dream a never-ending dream, lost in perpetual slumber.
Neither dead... nor alive trapped in their dream forever.

Nanoha:
Nothing is forever... It can't be!
'Cause everyone changes... Whether they want to or not, they need to change!
Myself... even you!

Fate:
But this is...

Linith:
Fate, Alf, Alicia. Rise and shine.

Fate:
But how?

Alicia:
Good morning, Fate. How did you sleep?

Linith:
Well, sleepy heads. Are we finally awake?

Alicia:
Yeah...

Alf:
I'm sleepy...

Linith:
You two didn't happen to stay up late again last night, did you?

Alicia:
Maybe just a little.

Alf:
Yeah!

Linith:
Now, you are older, but you could learn a thing or two from Fate. Things like early to bed, and early to rise.

Fate:
Umm... Linith, I...

Linith:
Yes. What is it, Fate? Go ahead.

Fate:
And Alicia...

Linith:
Forget everything I just said, Alicia. Her eyes may be opened, but Fate is also asleep.
Now, get dressed. It's time for breakfast. Precia is waiting for you in the dining room.

Alicia, Alf:
Okay!

Fate:
Mother...

Alicia:
Good morning, Mother!

Alf:
Good morning, Precia.

Precia:
Alicia, and Alf. Good morning.

Linith:
Oh dear, Precia. It looks as though we maybe in for a rainstorm today.

Precia:
Huh...?

Linith:
Come here, Fate. It's all right.

Precia:
My dear Fate. What's the matter?

Linith:
Poor little thing had a bad dream as near as I can tell.
She's acting like it wasn't real and all of this is the illusion.

Alicia:
Sister, did you study too much?

Alf:
Maybe that's it.

Precia:
Now, now. Come here mother.
That must have been some nightmare. But you're kind of you're all right. You're awake now.
Alicia, Linith and I are all here beside you.

Alf:
Hey Precia! I'm here, too.

Precia:
Of course. Alf, too.

Linith:
Well, how about a nice big breakfast? It's the best cure for bad dreams.

Precia:
She's right. Have a seat, you two. Let's get starting.

Alicia:
Okay!

Fate:
No... This is... a dream. Mother, she... she never smiled at me like this. Not ever, not even once.
And Alicia... and Linith. I know they're both gone. But this is so...

Precia:
Say, why don't we head into the village today?

Alicia:
Yeah!

Linith:
That sounds great.

Precia:
I wanna buy a new pair of shoes for Fate. Something extra nice.

Alicia:
No fair! How come she gets new shoes?

Linith:
Because she scored a perfect on our magic test. You need to do better, Alicia.

Alf:
A lot better!

Alicia:
Hey, Fate. Tutor me so I get a perfect next time, too!

Fate:
Oh, sure...

Alicia:
Fate, what's wrong?

Fate:
This... this is what I wished for... A moment like this one. A simple happy moment.
I dreamt of it for so long...

Hayate:
Sleepy... I'm sleepy.

Will of the Book of Darkness:
No [xxx] my master. Be a peace. Do not awaken. Go back to sleep and I will grant your every wish.
Just close your eyes. And sleep back into a peaceful dream.

Book of Darkness:
Schwarze Wirkung.

Nanoha:
Lindy, Amy. I moved the battle field to the ocean. Please take care of the fires in the suburbs.

Lindy:
Don't you worry. The disaster team is already on its way to put them out.

Nanoha:
And the Book of Darkness, she sounds like a whiner, but she seems to understand.
Please let me keep trying! Raising Heart, let's do this!

Raising Heart:
Yes, my master.

Alex:
The team has reached the fires, and we'll have them all extinguished very shortly.

Lindy:
Much as I may want to, I can't tell her not to push herself.

Raising Heart:
Reload.

Nanoha:
Only three magazines are left, so eighteen cartridges...
I wonder if there's enough left for me to fire Starlight Breaker.

Raising Heart:
I have a method. Call me "Excelion Mode".

Nanoha:
No way! You know, we can't use that until the main system is a lot stronger.
If I do try it and something should go wrong, you'll break! I'm not gonna let that happen!

Raising Heart:
Call me. Call me, my master.

Hayate:
I don't remember... what was I wishing for...?

Will of the Book of Darkness:
For the real world, and all of its sadness... to be vanished into a dream. Now sleep in peace.

Hayate:
That's... my wish?
Wh, what I... what I really want the most of all right now...

Will of the Book of Darkness:
And you, you should sleep as well.

Nanoha:
Someday, I will. But not right now!
Right now, I'm here to save Fate and Hayate! I'm even here to save you!
Raising Heart, Excelion Mode! Engage Drive!

Raising Heart:
Ignition.

Nanoha:
All that sadness can be [doubtful]. And those bad dreams, there's a way passed them!

Book of Darkness:
Photon Lancer Genocide Shift.


Alicia:
It's getting dark. Oh, looks like it's gonna rain. Hey Fate, let's go home. Are you listening?

Fate:
I'm sorry, Alicia. I think I'll stay here, just for a little bit.

Alicia:
You're just gonna sit there? Then I'll sit there, too!
Keeping dry, me and my sister Fate.

Fate:
Tell me, Alicia. This is all a... big dream, isn't it?
And we aren't in the same world because if you are still alive, then I would have never been born.
That's how I know that this is just a dream.

Alicia:
Yeah, I know.

Fate:
And our mother... She was never that nice to me, in the real world.

Alicia:
Mother was a very nice person... She tried so very hard to bring me back.
I mean, her [xxx] wouldn't have. So she must be nice, right?

Fate:
I guess...

Alicia:
So, what if it's just a dream? Who cares, Fate? If it's good, at least, it's better than what the real world is.
Let's stay right here in this happy dream we're sharing, Fate and Alicia together forever.
I can live. I can be... your sister! We can stay with Mother, Alf and Linith.
I'll give you all the happiness you wanted. Doesn't that sound nice?

Hayate:
That does sound nice... All the happiness that I ever wanted...

Will of the Book of Darkness:
A healthy body... A life with your loved ones. All you have to do is sleep.
Just drift off to sleep, and you can live happy in that world for the rest of forever. A lovely, warm, never-ending dream...

Hayate:
I can't. Because that's only a dream!

Will of the Book of Darkness:
You only know one attack. Do you actually think that will work again?

Nanoha:
Yes! That's gonna work! I'm gonna make it work!
Raising Heart is risking its life to give me the power!
It's telling me... to save that girl!

Raising Heart:
A.C.S., standby.

Nanoha:
Now starting the Accel Charger... Strike Frame, Raising Heart!

Raising Heart:
Open.

Nanoha:
Excelion Buster A.C.S.... Drive!
We have to get through!
Starlight Breaker! （誤訳：ここで使われている魔法は「エクセリオンバスターA.C.S.」であり、「スターライトブレイカー」ではない）

Will of the Book of Darkness:
Impossible!

Nanoha:
Shoot now!

I hardly cracked her barrier. And that was with the Excelion Buster at point-blank range...
If this doesn't work, then...

Raising Heart:
Master.

Nanoha:
I need to try... even harder.

Raising Heart:
Yes.

Hayate:
But I'm not... I'm not wishing for this! So you shouldn't be doing it. Isn't that so?

Will of the Book of Darkness:
You see, my heart is closely linked to the hearts of the Guardian Knights.
They all adore you, master. So by extension, I adore you, too.
And hate myself... for I know your innocent blood will be shed by my hand.
There is a power within me I cannot control. I'm going to eat away at you, bit by bit.
Not because I want to, but because I must... I'm sorry...

Hayate:
When I woke up just now, I realized a little bit of what had been happening.
The sad parts in my life that I can't escape. And I'm pretty sure I understand that, too. It's kinda like Signum and the others.
I know how much it hurts when you feel totally alone... But, you mustn't forget...
I am your master now. And that means... you have to listen to me, and do whatever I say.

Fate:
I'm sorry, Alicia... But I... I really need to go now.

Alicia:
I know...

Fate:
Thank you so much. I'm sorry, Alicia.

Alicia:
It's okay. You're my sister, and nothing will ever change that.
The people waiting for you... They're strong, right? And nice?

Fate:
Mm-hm...

Alicia:
Well then, go ahead, Fate. It's time.
I wish that the real world... were just like this one...

Hayate:
I'll give you a name.
I'm not gonna let them call you... the Book of Darkness or Cursed Book. Those aren't you anymore.
I can do that sort of thing, you know. I am the Book's owner after all.

Will of the Book of Darkness:
It's impossible... The automatic protection program does not stop.
The Bureau's magician is fighting, but that too is pointless.

Hayate:
It's all right.

You out there! The people of the Bureau!
Umm... I-I'm Hayate Yagami, the owner of the girl up here!

Nanoha:
Hayate!?

Hayate:
Nanoha? Is that you?

Nanoha:
Yes, it's me. A lot has happened, and I'm fighting with the Book of Darkness.

Hayate:
I'm sorry for all the trouble, Nanoha. Do you think you can stop her?
I cut up control from the main Book, but I can't access my owner's rights as long as this one is still fighting.
The one you see before you is only the automatic protection program.

Yuno:
The owner awakened after the completion of the Book of Darkness... Now we can... Nanoha!
Listen very carefully to what I'm saying. If you do as I tell you, Hayate and Fate can both come out. It's that simple.
It doesn't matter what you do, just blast that girl with your magical power, all right?
Hit her as hard as you can, give it all your guts!

Nanoha:
Well, thanks a lot, Yuno. That is simple!

Raising Heart:
It's so.

Nanoha:
Excelion Buster, full barrel! Middle-distance Attack Mode!

Raising Heart:
All right. Barrel Shot.

Hayate:
As master of the night sky, I grant you your new name as something that supports and helps others.
You are no longer cursed. You are a breeze of good luck. A shout full of blessings.
Hello... Reinforce.

Fate:
Well, Bardiche. It's time to be going. Can you do Zamber Form, for me?

Bardiche:
Yes, sir.

Fate:
You're a good boy.

Bardiche:
Zamber Form.

Fate:
Thunder Wind! Ready!

Nanoha:
Excelion Buster Force Burst, now!

Fate:
Sprite Zamber!

Nanoha:
Break Shoot!

Reinforce:
New name, "Reinforce", recognized. Owner's rights are accessible again.

Hayate:
Yeah.

Alf:
Fate, you're back!

Reinforce:
But the protection program is out of control.
The massive power that was contained within, freed from supervision will soon lose all restraint.

Hayate:
Hmm... well, we have to stop it then.
My Reinforce... Shall we go now?

Reinforce:
Yes, my master.

Amy:
Everyone, be careful! The Book protection program is still out there!

Lindy:
So much hangs in the balance now. Are you about ready, Chrono?

Chrono:
Yes. I'm almost at the scene.

Lindy:
Arc-en-ciel... I just hope we don't end up having to use it.


Fate:
The automatic protection program that was freed from the Book of Darkness goes out of control.

Nanoha:
And the people who will go against it are us, the Bureau team, and, and...!

Fate:
This must be the last battle of the Book of Darkness incident.

Nanoha:
Next episode, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's, episode twelve: Night's End, Journey's End.

Hayate:
The long night is almost over...
