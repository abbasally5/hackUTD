Hayate:
The weight of the truth I've finally realized. The sad memories that were woven through time.

Fate:
They quietly dissolve... the pains of the past.

Nanoha:
In order to retain the light that shines within my heart.

Hayate:
In order to not disappear into darkness.

Fate:
In order to protect the bonds we've created.

Nanoha:
We choose... to open the door to the future.
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's is about to begin.


Alex:
The master of the Book of Darkness has completely separated from the protection program.

Amy:
Listen, everyone. The bottom black sediment is the place where everything will go out of control.
Don't be reckless and get too close to it until Chrono gets there.

Nanoha:
All right!

Hayate:
Exercise the owner's right.

Reinforce:
I have interrupted the progression of the protection program.
I can delay it from going out of control for only a few minutes.

Hayate:
Good. That should be enough for what I need.
Now return their Linker Cores, and fix all the damage to the Knight protection system.
Come now... and gather my Knights...

Nanoha:
Look, it's Vita!

Fate:
And Signum, too!

Signum:
We are the Protector Knights who gather under our master of the night sky.

Shamal:
As long as our master exists in this life, our spirits will never fade.

Zafira:
We are with you always and everywhere, so long as life [breeze/ breathe] inside you.

Vita:
We are all humble servants of Hayate Yagami... the lord and [sevant] of the night sky!

Hayate:
Okay, now Reinforce. Give to me my armor and my stuff.

Reinforce:
Yes.

Nanoha:
Hayate, you're back!

Hayate:
O light of the night sky, gather here upon me! O warm wind of blessing Reinforce, set up!

Vita:
Oh Hayate...

Signum:
I'm so sorry.

Shamal:
Ah, Hayate, we all... I mean, we were...

Hayate:
No, it's okay. I understand. I really do. Reinforce told me all about everything that happened.
Why don't we worry about the details later, all right?
Right now... I want to say, welcome back!

Vita:
Hayate! Hayate! Oh Hayate!

Hayate:
Nanoha and Fate, I'm grateful that you're all right.
And I'm sorry that my Knights caused both of you so much trouble.

Fate:
It's okay.

Chrono:
Sorry but, we don't have very much time.
I'm Enforcer Chrono Harlaown, Administration Bureau. I will try to make this as concise as I can.
We know that the black sediment, which is the Book of Darkness's protection program is going to go out of control shortly.
We need to stop that from happening no matter what may cost us. There're currently two plans to accomplish that.
Plan one is to stop it by using an extremely strong freezing magic.
Plan two is to stop it using Arthra's weapon system, Arc-en-ciel.
I want to ask all of you and the master of the Book of Darkness if there might be a better way to solve this crisis.

Shamal:
Umm... well, I... I think that the first plan would be very difficult.
A protection program without a master is a lot like a big ball with pent-up magic.

Signum:
Even frozen, the regenerating system won't stop as long as the core's there.

Vita:
Yeah! Well, you guys can't use the Arc-en-ciel!
If you try to use it here, Hayate's house is gonna get completely blown away!

Nanoha:
You mean it's that strong?

Yuno:
It's a magic that will completely distort the dimension within a one-hundred-kilometer radius from its center of motion and cause reactive extinction.
I don't see how it makes sense to do that.

Nanoha:
Chrono, I'm totally against using that!

Fate:
Yeah, I feel the same way!

Chrono:
Captain Lindy and I don't wanna have to use that weapon, either.
But if it starts to go out of control, then the damage that it would create could be a lot worst than anything Arc-en-ciel could do.

Yuno:
If it goes out of control, then it will quickly encroach on anything and everything it touches.

Amy:
Listen up, everyone! It's gonna start going out of control less than fifteen minutes! Please make your decision quickly!

Chrono:
What should we do?

Signum:
I'm sorry but, I don't think we can be of much use to you.

Zafira:
We really haven't seen much of what actually happens when it finally loses control.

Shamal:
But we know that we somehow need to stop it. I just don't wanna see Hayate's house get completely destroyed.

Chrono:
I'm afraid... we've probably passed that point already.

Yuno:
If we could only move the battle field out to sea.

Signum:
It would still distort the dimension out in the ocean.

Alf:
Why does everything have to be so damn complicated!? Can we all just blast it to smithereens to be done with this stupid thing!?

Yuno:
Ah... Alf.

Chrono:
I'm afraid it's not as simple as that.

Nanoha:
Blast it, huh...? Maybe there's some way...

Hayate:
If we shoot it here, then the damage would be really big...

Fate:
But if not here... then where...

Nanoha:
Hey, Chrono. Can we shoot Arc-en-ciel anywhere we want?

Chrono:
What do you mean anywhere? What do you have in mind?

Fate:
Shooting from where Arthra is right now.

Hayate:
Can we shoot from dimensional space?

Amy:
You should never underestimate the technology of the Time-Space Administration Bureau.
Of course we can shoot it here, in space or anywhere we want!

Chrono:
Hey, hold on a minute! Don't tell me you guys are thinking of...!

Arisa:
Well, I... seemed to get smaller.

Suzuka:
Yeah. But that big black thing is still in the ocean.

Arisa:
What's going on out there? Don't tell me this is going to continue happening for a long time.

Suzuka:
I have a real strong feeling that everything's gonna be okay.

Arisa:
Huh?

Suzuka:
Those two... are out there fighting hard for us.

Arisa:
You're talking about Nanoha and Fate?
You say that with such a serious expression, I guess I feel the same way about them as you do, Suzuka.
Well, anyway... Ah! Darn it! What the heck is going on!? It's Christmas Eve! It's supposed to be fun and jolly [xxx the time of the season!]
If this is a dream, then hurry up and awake me! I can't stand it anymore! I can't stand it!

Suzuka:
Arisa, wait! [xxx] calm down!

Lindy:
Oh my... They're completely out of their minds as always.

Amy:
What's scary is that it is possible due to the precise calculation.
All right, Chrono. Everything's ready on this end. You've got ten minutes until it goes out of control.

Chrono:
It's a high-risk plan that's going to depend on each and every one of our individual powers.
But considering the states, I think it's worth trying.

Hayate:
The protection program barrier's four layers of a compound of magic and physics.
We'll have to break through that first.

Fate:
Once we passed the barrier, we'll fan out and expose the cores, we'll attack together, with everything we've got!

Nanoha:
Then using Yuno's strong metastasis magic, we'll send straight up, to the Arthra!

Lindy:
Finally, we'll evaporate it with the Arc-en-ciel... Done.

Amy:
If all goes well, it'll be the best way.

Chrono:
Admiral, are you able to see this?

Graham:
Yes, Chrono. I can see very well.

Chrono:
The Book of Darkness was a cursed magic book.
The curse has completely eaten away many lives and ruined countless others who simply bound themselves involved.
Because of that book, my mother... and all the relatives and loved ones of victims had to endure unfortunate lives from the grief and the loss and pain.
I imagine that's the same with you and Lieze girls.
We can never change the past. What's done... is done!

Durandal:
Start up.

Chrono:
That's why... I'm going to fight now and change the future!

Lindy:
Begin charging the Arc-en-ciel!

Crew:
Right!


Amy:
It will go out of control in two minutes!

Hayate:
Um, Nanoha, Fate. Wait a second. Shamal.

Shamal:
Yes. I'll be happy to give them treatment.
All right, Klarwind. It's all up to you.

Klarwind:
Ja.

Shamal:
O quiet wind, please bring the blessings of healing.
Shamal, Knight of the Lake. And Klarwind, the Ring of the Wind. Healing and support is what we do.

Fate:
It's amazing!

Nanoha:
Thank you very much, Shamal. That was great.

Alf:
We will be the support team for this mission.
We are going to stop all of that annoying barricade.

Yuno:
Yeah.

Zafira:
That's right.

Chrono:
It's beginning.

Hayate:
The program that caused the Tome of the Night Sky to be called the Book of Darkness...
The darkness... of the Book of Darkness...

Alf:
Chain Bind!

Yuno:
Struggle Bind!

Zafira:
Chain it! Reinforced Steal Yoke! Now!

Vita:
You better match me... Nanoha Takamachi!

Nanoha:
Same goes for you!

Vita:
I am Hammer Knight Vita! And Graf Eisen, the Black Iron Count!

Graf Eisen:
Gigantform.

Vita:
Roaring Hammer Lash! Gigantschlag!

Nanoha:
Nanoha Takamachi and Raising Heart Excelion! Here we go!

Raising Heart:
Load Cartridge.

Nanoha:
Excelion... Buster!

Raising Heart:
Barrel Shot.

Nanoha:
Now Break... Shoot!

Shamal:
All right! Signum and Miss Testarossa, you're up!

Signum:
The Knight of the Sword, Signum's soul, the Magic Sword of Flame, Levantine.
The ultimate form made of connected blades, the sword of ultra-steel.

Levantine:
Bogenform.

Signum:
All right. Dash falcon!

Levantine:
Sturmfalken.

Fate:
Now Fate Testarossa and Bardiche Zamber, it's time to go!
Pierce it, lightning!

Bardiche:
Jet Zamber.

Zafira:
Guardian Beast of the Shield, Zafira! You will not shoot, I won't let you!

Shamal:
Hayate, now!

Hayate:
Come from far in the distance, O twig of mistletoe. Become the spear of silver moon, and attack!
Fossilizing Spear... Mistilteinn!

Alf:
What... Ah!?

Shamal:
It's not working. It's going crazy.

Amy:
Ordinary attacks don't work against this!
Every time it gets damage, it just regenerates itself!

Chrono:
But the attacks are working! Don't change the plan! Just keep at it!
Here we go, Durandal!

Durandal:
Okay, boss.

Chrono:
O eternal [xxx], give our enemy eternal sleep, within a frozen coffin!
Now freeze it!

Durandal:
Eternal Coffin.

Nanoha:
All right. Here we go. Fate, and Hayate.

Raising Heart:
Starlight Breaker.

Nanoha:
Now with greatest power! Starlight...!

Fate:
Super lightning! Plasma Zamber!

Hayate:
I'm sorry... And good night...
Echo, whistle of lasting closure! Ragnarok!

Nanoha, Fate, Hayate:
Breaker!

Shamal:
There. The main core's exposed... I got you... now!

Yuno:
Distant transmission!

Alf:
Target, in orbit!

Shamal, Yuno, Alf:
Transmission!

Crew:
The core transmission is coming!
As it's been transmitted, it's operating repairs on itself! And is working very fast!

Amy:
Arc-en-ciel, activate barrel!

Lindy:
Firing Lock System Interface, open.
After confirming the target, we will stand by at a safe distance until it responds! Prepare!

Crew:
Roger!

Lindy:
Now Arc-en-ciel, fire!

Amy:
The object within the dimension has completely disappeared!
There's no regeneration response!

Lindy:
Maintain the current guard position. We'll observe the response area for a little while.

Amy:
Roger.
So you guys at the scene, you did a great job! It was unbelievable! The situation has been resolved!
We still have to go and collect all the records, and restore the suburbs, and all the other stuff we usually do.
But please return to the Arthra for now, and get some rest.

Nanoha:
Umm... wait. What about Arisa and Suzuka?

Amy:
Oh, yeah. Since we removed the barriers in areas where damage wasn't too grave, I returned them to [their starting point.]

Arisa:
What the heck is this!? What is going on here!? Huh!?

Suzuka:
Arisa!

Nanoha:
Oh, I see. I'm glad.

Fate:
Chrono. A Really great job.

Chrono:
Thanks. But it wasn't just me. Thanks for your work, Fate.

Vita:
Hayate!

Shamal:
Hayare!

Vita:
Hayate! Hayate! Hayate! Hayate! Hayate! Hayate!

Nanoha:
Hayate...?


Fate:
And so... The Book of Darkness incident will end.

Nanoha:
Giving our thanks and smiles to all those who we met along the way as we traveled through this adventure.

Fate:
And then departures... and farewells... A time to start heading in a new direction.

Nanoha:
Next episode of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's, it's the last episode.

Nanoha, Fate:
Standby Ready.

Nanoha:
This isn't the end, but possibly a new beginning.
