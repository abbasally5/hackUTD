Shamal:
It was a very small wish. Everyday life when nothing happens. Each day gently continuing on to the next.

Signum:
They were carefree days to remember with a smile, until a shadow slowly came over them.

Shamal:
The power to break the heavy chains of destiny. If these hands could be granted this power, I wouldn't mind throwing everything else away.

Signum:
And oaths under the starry night sky, and with sword in hand, we'll summon the future!

Shamal:
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's is about to begin.


Fate:
Umm... an artificial life form that's neither a Familiar nor a human? You mean like me?

Lindy:
No! Not at all! Miss Fate was just born in a slightly different way, that's all.
You are a human and there was absolutely nothing unusual about your birth.

Chrono:
And that's what the test results said too, didn't they? So don't go saying things like that.

Fate:
Okay... I'm sorry.

Amy:
Hey! Do you want me to show it to you on the monitor?

Chrono:
The Guardians are actually programs. You see, they are embedded in the Book of Darkness and they take on human forms.
The Book of Darkness is reincarnated. It's been reborn over and over again. But these four guardians have lived on with many different masters over time.

Amy:
We've seen that their conversational skills are good enough to maintain a consistency in past cases as well.
But we've never seen a case where they've shown any emotion.

Lindy:
You see, it's all about the completion of the Book of Darkness.
That's their objective along with being Guardians for their master.

Nanoha:
Yes, but that girl who was wearing the hat, you know, Vita, she seemed to be really mad and then happy.

Fate:
Yeah. And I had to say I felt a strong personality in Signum, too.
There was more they're than just a program. She needed to help her comrades, and her master.

Chrono:
So it's for her master, huh?

Lindy:
All right. Well, that's all very interesting, but I guess we'll just have to wait and see what the investigators find out.

Chrono:
Well, considering how often they're teleporting, the master can't be too far away.
And if we moved on it now, we might be able to get to the master first.

Alf:
Hey, I love it! It's easy to understand!

Amy:
And if, we do it before the Book of Darkness is complete, the master will still be just a mage.

Chrono:
In any case, I'd like to get a little more specific data about the Book of Darkness.
Yuno. There's something I need you to do, starting tomorrow.

Yuno:
Okay, but...

Nanoha:
Hey, Yuno. What kind of person do you think the master of the Book of Darkness is?

Yuno:
When the Book of Darkness needs any host, it chooses someone at random who has the potential to control it.

Nanoha:
Oh, I see... Wow, that means it could be anyone. It might even be somebody our age.

Yuno:
Well, I don't know about that.

Nanoha:
Oh, it looks like Suzuka's girlfriend's sleeping over today.

Yuno:
She does?

Nanoha:
Yep. See. Hayate Yagami. She said she'll introduce us next time.

Yuno:
Oh.

Nanoha:
It Was a Small Wish (Part 2).


Hayate:
'Kay, then. But thanks a lot, Suzuka.

Suzuka:
Yeah, see you later.

Farin:
Yes, Hayate. We'd love to see you again, okay? This is great!

Hayate:
Yeah! Let's do it again real soon.

Shamal:
Signum, Hayate's on her way. She said it'll just be a little while.

Signum:
Is that so?

Shamal:
And what about Vita? Where did she go?

Signum:
Nowhere near here. She said she'll be back this evening.

Shamal:
And what about you, Signum?

Signum:
What do you mean?

Shamal:
What's up with you? You don't seem like yourself right now. It's sort of like your magical powers are drained.

Signum:
I wouldn't worry about that. Your leader's made as stern as tough. I'm fine.

Shamal:
You seem like you're little bit different lately. That's all I'm saying.
Well, for one thing, you never seemed to laugh like that before.

Signum:
Oh, you sure about that?

Shamal:
Well, it's not just you. It seems like we've all changed. In fact, quite a bit.
I'm just saying, it's as if everyone changed all of a sudden the day Hayate became our master.

Noel:
I see. So if you're with relatives, you're just expected to laugh a lot, and have a good time.

Hayate:
That's right. Every day is blissfull [xxx], endless happiness.

Noel:
Sounds like a pretty good time.

Hayate:
Wow, it's already been more than six months since everyone came by...

Book of Darkness:
Anfang.

Signum:
Book of Darkness start-up has been initiated.

Shamal:
We come for the gathering of the Book of Darkness.
We are the Guardian Knights, and our duty is the master's protection.

Zafira:
The clouds that gather under the master of the night sky.

Vita:
We are the Wolkenritters. Please give your command.
Hey, look at this.

Shamal:
Vita, be quiet!

Vita:
Yeah, but she...

Signum:
Stop it. Insolence before your master's forbidden.

Vita:
Insolence? But she... she looks like she's passed out.

Signum:
Huh?

Shamal:
What!?

Dr. Ishida:
Hayate. I was worried. I'm so glad you're okay.

Hayate:
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.

Dr. Ishida:
So... what's going on about those guys over there?

Hayate:
Huh? Ah!

Shamal:
Boy, remember that? Wasn't that a surprise?

Signum:
You got that, right.

Dr. Ishida:
So is there a problem here? Even if it is spring, it's still cold out. I don't know, Hayate.
Bringing you in without a jacket on like that. They all dress so strangely too, and I don't understand what you're all talking about. They just look suspicious.

Hayate:
Oh, well... u...umm... well, I don't know. It's sort of hard to explain. You see... it's... umm...

Signum:
All you have to do is give us an order and we can help you. What should we do?

Hayate:
Huh? What?

Signum:
It's telepathy. All you have to do is wish for command in your heart.

Hayate:
Oh, so it's more like a favor, then.

Signum:
Huh?

Hayate:
Just play along with what I say, okay?

Signum:
Right.

Hayate:
Right. Well, yes, Dr. Ishida. They may look a little weird, but they are related.

Dr. Ishida:
What do you mean?

Hayate:
Yes, it's wonderful. They flew all this way just because they wanted to spend my birthday with me.
And they thought that they'd have some fun and surprise me, so they got all dressed up in these costumes.
But then I guess I got a little too surprised. And then, something just happened.

Shamal:
Oh, yeah, it was just like that.

Sigum:
Yep. Just like she said.

Our new master, Master Hayate... It was one thing that she was so young, but she was also just so different from our previous masters.

Hayate:
I see. So this is what you called the Book of Darkness?

Signum:
Yes.

Hayate:
That's funny. It's been sitting right there in the book case for as long as I can remember.
I always took good care of it, because I thought it was such a pretty book.

Shamal:
Have you ever heard the voice of the Book of Darkness before now?
I mean, when you are waking up, or asleep or something?

Hayate:
Hmm... well, I'm not a mage or anything like that, so it's all just sort of vague. Oh, wait a minute. Here's something that might interest you.
You see, there're obligations to being the master of the Book of Darkness, I even have to provide food and clothing to shelter my Knights.
Fortunately, I'm a good cook. And I've got a big enough place for you to live.
And if you gimme your sizes now, I'll be able to go out and buy you some new clothes.

Vita, Signum, Shamal, Zafira:
Huh?

Signum:
Yes... It's true. She was different from the previous masters in just about every conceivable way.
The way Master Hayate treated us, she wasn't beating us down or treating us like tools. The way the previous masters did...
No, she treated us, like we were family.

Hayate:
Okay, everybody. Let's eat! Thank you for the food.

Vita, Signum, Shamal:
Thank you for the food.

Signum:
Of course, we had our trepidations. But we went along with the new master's wishes.
We were beginning to live a nice, normal life.

Vita:
May I have seconds?

Hayate:
Sure!


Hayate:
Armor?

Signum:
I'm afraid so. We have weapons, but we don't have any armor. It's something we need help from the master to be able to get.

Shamal:
We can make it all with our magical powers, but you're the one who is going to have to come up with the design.

Hayate:
I understand. But I wasn't going to make you guys fight or anything, that's the point. I wouldn't do that...
Oh! Can we do clothes that look like armor instead? How's that?

Signum:
Okay. We can do that.

Hayate:
Cool. Then I wanna do something that's great.
Time to put on the old thinking cap and do a little research.

Shamal:
What's this?

Hayate:
It's okay, it's okay. These places have the kind of stuff I'm looking for.

Shamal:
Hey, what's wrong, Vita? Vita?

What a nice breeze.

Hayate:
Oh, yeah.

Shamal:
It's beautiful hot, isn't it?

Hayate:
A perfect day for a nice little stroll. Vita. Go ahead, Vita. You can open it up if you want.

Vita:
Hayate, than...

Signum:
Time passed by ever so slowly.
We lived happily with our master day to day with nothing much ever really happening.

Hayate:
Wow... it's so pretty.

Signum:
Excuse me, master. I just wanted to know. Is it really all right?

Hayate:
What do you mean?

Signum:
About the Book of Darkness. We can gather the pages of the Book of Darkness as soon as you want us to. Perhaps it's time we did.
Why don't you have us do this now? It can give you great power. It'll help your legs. I know it will.

Hayate:
Yes, but I couldn't. It wouldn't be right for us to summon the Book just to help me.
We'd have to trouble an awful lot of people in the process, wouldn't we?

Signum:
Huh?

Hayate:
It wouldn't be right. It's just not good to bother people with your own selfishness like that. I just couldn't do it.
It'll work out. And I'm perfectly happy as I am now, so it really doesn't matter.
You see, Dad and Mom are already up in the skies. And I have my uncle to keep tabs on inheritance for me.

Signum:
This uncle was a friend of your father's, isn't that right?

Hayate:
Mm-hm. So I'm spared a lot of the troubles of everyday life. I'd say I'm very lucky.
And now on top of all that, I [can call] you guys.

Vita:
Hayate!

Hayate:
Oh, hi, Vita. What's up?

Vita:
Hi, Hayate. Is it okay if I eat the ice cream in the freezer?

Signum:
Hey, wait a minute. We had really big dinner. Why do you have to have more after that?

Vita:
Well, it so happens, I'm having a growth [phase/period], okay? And besides, Hayate's cooking is giga-delicious.

Hayate:
Oh, I suppose. But just a little bit, okay?

Vita:
Yum!

Hayate:
Umm... Signum.

Signum:
Yes?

Hayate:
Since you're the leader, I'd like to ask you for a favor. Can you promise me?

Signum:
Of course.

Hayate:
As your master, I just want you to understand. I have no desire to use the Book of Darkness.
So long as I'm the master, I want you to completely forget about it.
All I want you to do is live in my house together, be happy and have a good time.
That's all you have to do. So can you promise me that?

Signum:
You have my word. I swear on the sword of the Knights.

Her life's in danger...?

Shamal:
Wait! You mean Hayate's?

Dr. Ishida:
Yes... Well, as I said before, she has the strange and currently incurable paralysis. It's neurological.
Over the past six months, it's been slowly moving up her body. And it started to speed up, for a couple of months now.
At this rate, there's a real danger that it's going to start paralyzing her internal organs, too.

Signum:
The poor thing! But why didn't I see this happening!?

Shamal:
I'm sorry... I just... I don't know what to say!

Signum:
I was talking to myself! I can't believe this is happening to her!

Master Hayate's condition, was not an illness, was the curse of the Book of Darkness.
The Book of Darkness had been with Master Hayate ever since she was born. And a such was closely linked to her body.
Its strong magical powers have been suppressed and they've been eating away at the master's body because of her young Linker Core.
But it wasn't just getting in the way of physical activity, now it's threatening her life.
So, when our master had a first awakening, it all sped up. And what that meant was... that the master was now using her magical powers, but only a tiny bit of them, just enough to support the activities of the four of us, so we can't really say we had nothing to do with it.

Vita:
We have to save her... Hayate! We gotta help her!
Shamal! Shamal, you're good at making things [safe], aren't you!? Can't you cure her stupid disease!? Fix it!

Shamal:
I'm sorry... My powers are useless against something like that.

Vita:
It can't be [xxx], why is it have to be like this!?

Zafira:
Well, Signum.

Signum:
There's really very little we can do... hardly anything. You [xxx] then again...

It's the curse of the Book of Darkness. That drains on master's life.

Shamal:
If Hayate would fully awaken as the true master of the Book of Darkness...

Zafira:
Then our master's illness will fade away, or at least, it won't progress any further.

Vita:
I don't want to taint Hayate's future with blood, so I won't kill anyone.
And I guarantee you... that's the all thing I won't do!

Signum:
I'm truly sorry, our master. We're about to break the vow we made to you, but just this once.
And we beseech your forgiveness for our wrong doing!

Hayate:
That's great. You all look so good in your new clothes. Dinner time!

Vita:
Damn it... Man, you totally trashed this knight-outfit Hayate gave me...
Oh, well... the clothes will heal. And I'd say I got a fair amount of pages out of it, so I guess it's okay.
Oh... It... doesn't... hurt! It doesn't hurt... That's right. It's easy. It doesn't hurt at all.
Yeah... It wasn't always like this... When I go home, I'm sure that I'll have... a nice warm bath ready for me... and Hayate's dinner on the table.
And Hayate will be sitting there, waiting for me with a nice big smile on her face! That's right... I'm... I'm as happy as I can be!
Let's do it, [xxx]! This kind of thing... doesn't hurt a bit, yeah!

Chrono:
Okay, the three of us came out together, but do you think it's all right?

Amy:
I think so. We had Alex stay behind to do the monitoring.

Yuno:
And we still have to investigate the Book of Darkness, you know?

Chrono:
Yeah. And we should be able to find out just about everything we need from these guys.
Lieze, hi. Haven't seen you for a while. It's me, Chrono.

Lotte:
Wow! Little Chrono. Look at you, look at you! This is great! What's going on?

Chrono:
Lotte!? Wow! Come on! Take it easy!

Lotte:
You come on! You haven't seen your skill master for all this time and suddenly you're [cold in just it]?
Chrono, Chrono, Chrono!

Chrono:
Aria! You gotta do something about her!

Aria:
Come on, you don't have to be like that, let her some fun. It's been a long time.
Besides, it's not like you hate it, right?

Chrono:
Of course, I don't...

Amy:
Aria Lieze, long time no see.

Aria:
Yeah, long time no see.

Amy:
Lotte, Lieze's perky as always, isn't she?

Aria:
Well, I must say that even though she's my twin, there's an awful lot about her that's hard to predict.

Lotte:
That'll do, for now.

Amy:
Lotte, Lieze, long time no see.

Lotte:
Oh! Amy, long time no see ya!
Oh, and what do we have here? It looks like a tasty little mouse boy.
And who might you be?

Chrono:
That was nuts! Hard I ever get a skill master like that!

Lotte:
Oh, I see. You are looking for the Book of Darkness, right?

Aria:
Yes, well, I've heard a lot about it from Father. We'll try to be as much help as we can.

Chrono:
Say hello for me.

Yuno:
Miss Amy. Who are these people?

Amy:
These are the skill masters who taught Chrono magic and hand-to-hand combat.
Aria Lieze is in charge of magical training. And Lotte Lieze teaches hand-to-hand combat.
They're sisters twin Familiars of Admiral Graham.

Aria:
He's our master.

Amy:
And as you can tell their base form is a cat.

Yuno:
Yeah. Right, I see.

Chrono:
It would really be most reassuring if the two of you could come with us to the outpost.
But, you both have jobs now, right?

Lotte:
Yeah.

Aria:
We still have to teach a few more armed agents, so there's a bit more time in our contract.

Lotte:
So we won't be able to stay over near for too long. Sorry about that.

Chrono:
No. Actually, what I really wanted to ask, was about Yuno.

Lotte:
So can I eat him then?

Chrono:
Ah, sure. When you finished, do whatever you want with him.

Yuno:
Hey! Just a minute!

Aria:
So, you were saying? What's your request?

Chrono:
Okay. It's like this. I'd like you to assist him with this research in the Infinity Library.

Lotte, Aria:
Mm-hm.


Nanoha:
Thanks to Yuno's research, the truth about the Book of Darkness is becoming clear.

Fate:
How will my serious duel with Signum turn out?

Nanoha:
And will that mysterious masked man show up again!?

Fate:
Next episode of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's, it's episode seven.

Nanoha:
With the Broken Past and Present.

Nanoha, Fate:
Drive Ignition!
