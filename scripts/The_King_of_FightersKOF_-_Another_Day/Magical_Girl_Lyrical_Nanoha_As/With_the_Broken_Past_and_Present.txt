Nanoha:
Each time my heart passed by someone else, each time we collided,
I always thought how nice it would be if our words and feelings could portray everything that we wished for.

Fate:
But there are people, troubled people, that have stronger wishes than words or justice.

Nanoha:
What you need are not words. What you need is a strong heart.

Fate:
No lies, no hesitation, against those straightforward eyes...
With strong determined heart, we will make our stand.

Nanoha:
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's is about to begin.


Letty:
That's all the information we have. Does it give you what you need?

Lindy:
Yes, it does. Thank you so much. That helps a lot.

Letty:
Hey, all of you are going to come over here today, right?

Lindy:
Yeah. Regarding the Arthra.

Letty:
How about we break away and have some dinner together?
I would really like to hear more about that girl.

Lindy:
What girl do you mean?

Letty:
You know, the one you're taking care of... the one you said you really wanted to adopt.

Lindy:
Oh, her. You must be talking about Fate.

Letty:
That's right, Fate. Is she doing well?

Lindy:
She's fine. I feel bad about having her working with us on this case.
But at least she is together with her good friends. So she can enjoy life as she works.

Nanoha:
With the Broken Past and Present.


Fate:
This would be hard to choose. There's so many of them.

Arisa:
Lately, they're all so much alike. It's hard to tell the difference.
Maybe you should just choose the one that looks the coolest!

Nanoha:
It's important you pick one that makes text massaging easy.

Suzuka:
If they can [enchase] clear pictures, you can have all sorts of fun.

Arisa:
But, in the end, it's the color and the design that are important.

Nanoha:
It's more important how well it works.

Suzuka:
Another big thing to consider is how much memory it has.

Fate:
That's important?

Suzuka:
Yep. With lots of memory, you can keep music and a ton of pictures in it.
Then you can attach pictures to your text massages and send it to your friends.

Nanoha:
That's true.

Arisa:
That's so fun!

Nanoha:
Yeah, it is great.

Clerk:
Thank you very much!

Lindy:
Yes, thank you.
Miss Fate, here you go.

Fate:
Thank you so much, Admiral Lindy. I will take very good care of it.
Sorry to make you wait.

Suzuka:
No problem.

Arisa:
Did you find a good number?

Fate:
Yeah.

Nanoha:
Well, what's the number?

Fate:
Let's see... Here it is.

Nanoha, Arisa, Suzuka:
Oh!

Aria:
The super giant database that has every book and data imaginable from every world that the Administration Bureau looks over.

Lotte:
Where many histories are packed all. You can say it is the place that stocks memories of entire worlds.

Aria:
This is that place, the Infinity Library. But honestly, most of the contents are completely unorganized.

Lotte:
Looking for something in here is a big hassle, you know.

Aria:
This is usually a place where people form large teams and research for years on end.

Yuno:
Investigating past history is what my clan does for a living.
Oh, and I brought some really good search magic as well, so we'll be fine.

Lotte:
That's right. Come to think, you're one of the Scrya kids.

Aria:
Both Lotte and I have our own work to do. So we can't stay here every day until you're done.
But we'll help as much as we can.

Lotte:
After all, it's a request from my cute little Chrono!

Fate:
I see. So both Arisa and Suzuka are taking violin lessons?

Nanoha:
Yeah. Every day when they finish, they text me to tell me what the lessons were all about.

Fate:
Show me next time.

Amy:
I'm back!
Has the Captain left for Headquarters already?

Fate:
Just left. The new weapon addition to the Arthra's finished, so she went to meet Alex and the others. So they could check it out.

Amy:
A new weapon? Huh? Must be the Arc-en-ciel.
I sure have been hoping that we could get by without using such a powerful weapon...

Nanoha:
With the Captain gone and Chrono not here, I guess that leaves you're in charge of everything until one of them gets back.

Alf:
So much responsibility!

Amy:
That's a scary thought in a different way. Oh well, I'm sure there won't be that many emergencies going on while they're gone...
Oh...
Fortunately, it looks deserted, with no humans around, we'll have a little bit of time to deal with them.
Unfortunately, it'll take over 45 minutes to get agents to put up barriers. This isn't looking good!

Fate:
Amy, wait. I'll go.

Alf:
Yeah, I'll go, too.

Amy:
Really? Are you sure?

Fate:
Totally.

Alf:
Sure thing.

Amy:
You need towatch our back. Stay here and stand by.

Nanoha:
Okay.

Fate:
Are you ready? Let's go, Bardiche.

Bardiche:
Yes, sir.

Signum:
It's no wonder why Vita had such a hard time. This guy's strong and just never backs down.
Huh!? Damn, what now!?

Bardiche:
Thunder Blade.

Fate:
Break!

Alf:
Are you worried about your master?

Zafira:
You again...

Alf:
Our masters are fighting one-on-one right now. The same goes for us.

Zafira:
Signum may be our leader and a good one, but she is not my master.

Signum:
If Signum is not your master, then your master is the master of... the Book of Darkness.

Amy:
Fate! What are you doing helping her!? You're supposed to capture her!

Fate:
I... umm... couldn't help it. Sorry.

Signum:
If you're waiting for me to say thanks, I won't.

Fate:
Did I get in your way?

Signum:
You're extremely fast. You make a worthy opponent for me.

Fate:
Well, my job is to get in the way of villains, and I take it seriously.

Signum:
I see. That's right, I was a villain.

Amy:
Oh, no! In other location!
We have to solve them right away! Can we count on you?

Nanoha:
Of course.

Graham:
It's been a long time. Good to see you, Admiral Lindy.

Lindy:
Yes.

Graham:
As for the Book of Darkness, how's that going lately?

Lindy:
As you can imagine, it has been difficult. But I am making progress.

Graham:
I have complete faith in you. I'm sure you won't muck it up like I did with such disastrous results.

Lindy:
As I told you before, at my husband's funeral, what happened wasn't your fault in any way.
No commander can ever predict that such a thing would happen, even a good one.

Lotte:
No way... Look at you, talk about multi-tasking, can you really read all those books at once?

Yuno:
Of course. Well... sort of. Umm, Miss Lotte, you and Aria saw what happened during the previous Book of Darkness incident, right?

Lotte:
Yeah... Well, I can't believe it was eleven years ago.

Yuno:
Umm... is it true? That Chrono's father was killed?

Lotte:
What a day... Aria and I were out spending the day with Father. We were right there when it happened.
Clyde... oh, that's Chrono's father, was transporting the Book of Darkness that had supposed to have been sealed.

Yuno:
Yes...

Lotte:
There was nothing we could do... before we knew it Clyde was going down with the guard ship.

Chrono:
So the only way to seal it turns out to be Arc-en-ciel after all.

Aria:
Make sense. There is no other weapon that can emit so much power at once.

Chrono:
But it also causes too much damage to everything else. I hope we can get away with not using it.

Aria:
If only we could find the master and stop him.
But... I don't know if we would do any good... If we destroy him, the Book of Darkness will just come back.
And it would find a new master in the future.
All we would be doing is to delay the problem, not actually fix anything.

Chrono:
Even so, it's better to do with it in the future than to have a huge disaster right now.

Aria:
That's true...


Signum:
If it were possible, I would like to postpone the showdown.
But you are very fast. I can't escape, I must fight.

Fate:
I understand. That is what I came here for.

Levantine:
Schlangeform.

Bardiche:
Load Cartridge, Haken Form.

Fate:
Now, Haken Saber!

Bardiche:
Blitz Rush. Haken Slash.

Fate:
What the!?

Bardiche:
Plasma Lancer. Assault Form.

Levantine:
Schwertform.

Fate:
Plasma...

Signum:
Flying Dragon...

Fate:
Smasher!

Signum:
Flash!

Alf:
If you're a Familiar, a Guardian Beast like me, shouldn't you be trying to correct your master's errors instead of making your own?

Zafira:
Our sole purpose is to retrieve the Book of Darkness, it is the purpose we don't share.
Our master has no knowledge concerning our work to gather the pages.

Alf:
What!? What is that supposed to mean?

Zafira:
Are you not a Guardian Beast, one that fights for his master, even if it means doing things on their behalf?
That they do not or should not, even know about...

Alf:
Of course I am! But still! I don't understand!

Vita:
Signum's group is...

Shamal:
Yeah. They're fighting in the desert now, against Testarossa and her Guardian Beast.

Vita:
Hmm... This will be bad if it goes on for too long. I guess we'll go help her out.
Damn it! Another one showed up. That girl in the white outfit!

Hey you, Nano-something or other!

Nanoha:
I-It's me! Nanoha! NA-NO-HA!
Vita... I came here to listen to what you have to say.
It's always possible... that I might be able to help you. You know, I'm usually good at that.

Vita:
Be quiet! I can't trust anything that someone from the Administration Bureau says!

Nanoha:
But Vita, I'm not from the Administration Bureau. I'm a civilian helper.

Vita:
Gathering pages for the Book of Darkness is limited to once per mage.
In other words, even if I defeat her, she won't turn into new pages. I'd like to avoid wasting cartridges, too...

Nanoha:
Vita, wait a minute.

Vita:
I guess defeating you will wait for another day!
All right! Let's go, Graf Eisen!

Graf Eisen:
Eisengeheul.

Vita:
Now, escape!

Raising Heart:
Master.

Nanoha:
Do it.

Vita:
All right. I think I'm far enough away to be safe.
Dimensional transport!

Raising Heart:
Buster Mode, Drive Ignition.

Nanoha:
Here it goes! The first long range cannon attack in a while!

Raising Heart:
Load Cartridge.

Vita:
Impossible! She's gonna shoot from that far away!?

Raising Heart:
Divine Buster Extension.

Nanoha:
Divine... Buster!

Raising Heart:
It's a direct hit.

Nanoha:
Did we overdo a little bit?

Raising Heart:
Don't worry.

Vita:
You are...

Masked man:
Go... You're going to finish the Book of Darkness, aren't you?

Nanoha:
Divine...

Raising Heart:
Master.

Nanoha:
Where did that come from!? It's impossible! From such a distance, and so fast!

Raising Heart:
Sorry, master.

Nanoha:
Not at all. It was actually my fault.

Signum:
This [far again], it's so fast.
She's starting to launch attacks my eyes can't keep up with...
If I don't end this battle soon, it'll be bad.

Fate:
So tough... She's overpowering me both in close range and middle range...
For now, I'm fooling her with my speed. But if she learns to blow squarely, she'll clash me down!

Signum:
Sturmfalken... Will I be able to hit it?

Fate:
Sonic Form... I have no choice but to do it.

Signum:
Oh no, Testarossa! Damn you!

Masked man:
Now... take it...


Nanoha:
Fate's Linker Core has been taken from her.

Fate:
The Arthra is back. But the mysteries of this case grow even deeper.

Nanoha:
What is the past of the Book of Darkness that Yuno's research uncovers?

Fate:
Next episode of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's, it's episode eight.

Nanoha:
The Decision of Heartbreak, and the Courageous Choice.

Nanoha, Fate:
Drive Ignition!
