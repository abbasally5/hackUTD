  Abandoned artificial satellites. Tanks jettisoned from shuttles. Refuse generated during space station construction.This vast amount of junks floating in space:Space Debris, is a very serious threat to everything in orbit.
This is a story of 2075, a time in which this space debris has become a major problem.

GIGALT:
Okay, rookie, you stay put right there.
Are you listening to me, rookie?

GIGALT:
Wait there. Don't go near the engine until-
Hey! Rookie!
Did you hear a word I said?!
Hey!

GIGALT:
What do you think you're doing, damn it?
At least learn your suit's stop code!

GIGALT:
Stay calm. Just swing over to your right.
Damn it, you panicked over nothing, you little bastard...

GIGALT:
Crap, the engine and control system were still working!



stay put : 置かれたままの状態｛じょうたい｝でいる、動かずにじっとしている
~ over nothing : 無駄に、無意味に　→ panicked over nothing : 無駄に混乱するとか


ALL:
Six! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes
You did it!
Yeah, Banzai! Banzai!

TANABE:
Huh?
What's going on in here?

Hachi:
I just won the lottery, that's what!

LAVIE:
Yep! 300!

TANABE:
300 million?!

YURI:
Not just yet.

TANABE:
Huh?

YURI:
But if the next number is a 4, he wins the money.

TANABE:
No way!

LAVIE:
I'm the one who bought the ticket, Hachi,
so if you win, I get half, right?
I mean, if that's a problem, a quarter is fine, okay?

PHILIPPE:
I helped out with the luck dance, so I get some, too. right?

TANABE:
Excuse me,
but how come three of you dressed all funny like that?

FEE:
Wanna join in?

TANABE:
What?

FEE:
They say it's a good-luck charm that's a sure thing.

TANABE:
But, I really don't…

Hachi:
Hey! Here comes the last number!

Hachi:
C'mon 4!

ALL:
Four!

VOICE FROM TV:
And those are tonight's numbers!

Hachi:
Man, 172 straight losses.
And partials don't pay anything. Damn it.

YURI:
I suppose that half-hearted dance just won't do the trick.
If you're serious, you should go all-out.
This is supposed to be quite effective, you know.

PHILIPPE:
Good idea! Do you want to try that next time?

YURI:
If they do, could you be the human sacrifice, chief?

PHILIPPE:
Hey! don't even joke about that!

YURI:
It's no joke, chief. There's more likely to ...

TANABE:
Sempai. I don't get it. Why are you playing the lottery?

Hachi:
It's not your concern, so lay off for me.

FEE:
This bozo's dream is to buy a spaceship.

TANABE:
Oh? But aren't spaceships really really expensive?

FEE:
That's why he is playing the lottery!
Hey! that reminds me!
Let me show you something cool. This is-

FEE:
What's the problem? You showed it to us before!

Hachi:
Yeah, but don't go show it without asking!

TANABE:
I haven't seen it. What is it?

YURI:
Idea notebook for acquiring a Spaceship of my own.

TANABE:
What?

YURI:
Mr. Hoshino has filled it with all the ways he could think of to get himself a Spaceship.

FEE:
Apparently, he had it even before he joined the company.

TANABE:
Oh... Yeah, but Sempai, it's practically impossible to win the lottery, you know?

Hachi:
There're lots of different ways to do it.
I could win the President's Prize.

LAVIE:
Oh, Come on, it's not like you'd ever be chosen for that.

PHILIPPE:
He's right, Hachimaki.
Besides, the President's Prize is a life-sized Mr. Nora doll. Hardly a fortune.

Hachi:
I-I could also rescue some rich old geezer who's about to kick the bucket, or marry some rich old lady, or...

FEE:
Are you the life-saving type?

TANABE:
And marrying rich?
Do you really think anyone would actually marry you?

Hachi:
If a man puts his mind to it,
he can marry or buy a spaceship! 

TANABE:
So, what other brilliant ideas do you have written in there?
C'mon, let me see!

Hachi:
No, What are you doing here, anyway!
Isn't it your day-off?

TANABE:
Yeah, That's right, it is!

TANABE:
Yes, Sempai. I learned how in a workshop.

Hachi:
Okey, try to back away.

TANABE:
Right.

Hachi:
You moron, you're spinning because you're not thrusting through your body's center of gravity.

TANABE:
I'm sorry, Sempai.

Hachi:
You gotta be able to judge something's center of mass in a second.
Because when you're holding tools or debris, it's even harder to determine your center of gravity.

TANABE:
Y-Yes, sir. Or more to the point, Stop me.

CHENG-SHIN:
Of course.

TANABE:
Thank you very much.

CHENG-SHIN:
Not at all, no problem.

CHENG-SHIN:
Just think of your center of gravity as somewhere around the pit of your stomach.

Hachi:
Long time no see, Cheng-Shin?

CHENG-SHIN:
Yeah, it's good to be back.
So you've finally got yourselves a new recruit, huh?

TAHABE:
Is he a friend of yours, Sempai?

Hachi:
Yeah, we were hired at the same time.
Cheng-Shin is a spacecraft pilot.

CHENG-SHIN:
My wings are still clipped, though.
I'm not allowed to carry anything but cargo.

ANNOUNCE:
It's 1800 hours.
ISPV-7 is about to enter night-time mode, so we ask that all corporate blocks switch over to internal power sources.

CHENG-SHIN:
Good for you, Hachi.
you finally have yourself a new partner.

Hachi:
Too bad she doesn't have a lick of talent.

CHENG-SHIN:
But isn't everyone like that at first?
Besides, she is very cute and a real go-getter, too.

Hachi:
Girls like that oughta be secretaries or something.

CHENG-SHIN:
Oh, so I can assume you agree with me that she is cute, then?

Hachi:
You'll never cut it as a pilot.
Your visions are awful.

CHENG-SHIN:
You can't admit it, can you?

Hachi:
Lay off.

KEITH:
Hey, Hachimaki!
You buy your spaceship yet?

Hachi:
I hear your precious yankees lost.
That makes our records the same.

KEITH:
Oh, so I guess you lost the lottery yet again?

Hachi:
Even if I do get a spaceship someday, I'm never letting you aboard it.

KEITH:
Wow, I'm just kidding, man?

FRIEND:
Hey, I believe in you.
So, could you maybe lend me a little bit money?

Hachi:
You're playing the ponies?

FRIEND:
No way!
I found myself a sure thing in the dog races!

FRIEND:
Hey! What's it gonna be?!
I'm taking the last bets!

FRIEND:
Give me a minute, will ya?

FRIEND:
Hey! Somebody! Anybody!
You gotta work the night-shift for me?
I've gotta a big date tonight!

Hachi:
Why? You're just getting dumped again?

FRIEND:
If you lend me some money and I'll do it.

Hachi:
Pipe down back there.

FRIEND:
Greeting! my patheticly single friends?
I got some brand new goodies for ya!
Rent or buy, your choice, but cold cash only, please!

Hachi:
Save some for me, guys! I want some!

FRIEND:
I'm not taking any more bets!

Hachi:
Wait, I want in, too! Chang-shin, spot me, will ya?

Hachi:
Oh, C'mon, man! It's a sure thing! I'll pay ya back triple!

TANABE:
Right!
I did it! I did it again! Sempai, I did it!

Hachi:
Geez... Of course you did. What would you think?
I've been on you for days.

FRIEND:
I knew you could do it, Cheng-Shin!

FRIEND:
He's had great grades since academy.

Hachi:
What's going on? What's the occasion?

FRIEND:
Looks like Cheng-Shin's moved up the ladder.

Hachi:
He's moved up?

FRIEND:
He's gonna be a ship's captain.

CHENG-SHIN:
Ah, I said I'm a copilot.
They're finally gonna let me start carrying people.

Hachi:
They are? Great!
Let's drink a toast! To the future space captain!

FRIEND:
Great idea! I'll go order some beer!

Hachi:
Hey, you'd better get us a few bottles of Shaoxing wine!

CHENG-SHIN:
Um, I don't usually drink that.

Hachi:
That was fast, and only took it three years.
Are you trying to move straight up to company president?

CHENG-SHIN:
Not interested.
I wanna be a captain of a ship that travels to Jupitor.

Hachi:
You've been saying that for years.
Is Jupitor really as great as you think?

FRIEND:
Yeah, you're so great, Cecille, you're baby.

Hachi:
So, when do you get to start flying?

CHENG-SHIN:
I'll start a week from now, on the GO-S27.

Hachi:
No kidding. Give'em hell, man.

CHENG-SHIN:
I really hope you get a spaceship of your own soon, Hachi.

The thing is... I can handle it myself.

KEITH:
Hachimaki!

KEITH:
Vega's in here after 1400.
If you're gonna keep going, use cargo bay B4.

MAN:
Hey, is that the guy?
The idiot who says he's gonna buy a ship?

MAN:
Buy himself a spaceship?
Do they get that kind of pay down in Half Section?

MAN:
Yeah, they get double pay 'cause they've got half the people?

Hachi:
You think this is funny?

MAN:
Huh?

KEITH:
Hachimaki?

Hachi:
Is me buying a spaceship that funny to you?
C'mon, say something!


TANABE:
No, Sempai.

MAN:
Yeah, of course it's funny. What of it?
It's funny when a punk from Half Section deludes himself with dreams.

KEITH:
Hey!

Hachi:
What's wrong with dreams!?

TANABE:
Sempai! What are you doing?! Why are you... Ahh!

MAN:
You punk?

TANABE:
Uh, Sempai!

MAN:
We've got you, XXX! Half Section bastard!

GIGALT:
Hey, are you okay?
You're really gonna pull yourself together, rookie.
You want your own spaceship, don't you, kid?
Don't rush things.
You can take your time.
Take your time.
Take your time.

Hachi:
Damn it, hell.

YURI:
Sounds like you've finally you come around.
How do you feel? Are you okay?

Hachi:
Huh? Fine.

YURI:
Well, you were moaning in your sleep pretty badly.

Hachi:
It was an old dream. I was just having a nightmare.

YURI:
I see, well, I'm glad it was just a dream.

Hachi:
What's this here?

YURI:
Oh, Tanabe left some medicine with me.

Hachi:
Hm, no kidding.

YURI:
She was, really quite worried about you.
She wanted to sit up with you 'cause she thought she was responsible.
But I sent her away because this is the men's dorm.

Hachi:
You're who asked her?
Cheng-shin, you're amazing.
And I'm just...
What the hell am I doing with my life?

FEE:
DBR-0720-1414. As bad luck would have it, this bird still has propellant left in it, it started as asteroid probe, so it has excellent defensive and evasive capabilities. And its orbit is retrograde to ours, so making a rendezvous is going to be tricky.

FEE:
Our section tried to recover it three years ago, but an accident triggered the thrusters and it got away from us. Of course, every other company's attempts failed so far, too.

TANABE:
Wow, this sounds like it's gonna be tricky.

FEE:
Well, of course, we would've preferred to leave it alone, but it's come into low Earth orbit now and has intersected our work orbit. Luckily, it hasn't made any orbital corrections near Earth

FEE:
Hachi. Do you copy?

Hachi:
Yeah... It's the same as any other run, right?

FEE:
Hachi, you know, you'd better shape up!
Starting now, I'm having Tanabe participate directly our mission, so set a good example as her Sempai!

TANABE:
Yeah, she is right. show me how it's done, Sempai!

LAVIE:
Hey, Hachi, try not to butt heads with other departments, okay?
It makes trouble for me.

Hachi:
Yes, sorry about that.

LAVIE:
Hey, wait a minute.
Ta-dah!
Number A-7777-777!
You can tell us it's a lucky number just by looking at it and...

Hachi:
Thanks, but no thanks. I'm done with playing lotto forever.

LAVIE:
What do you mean "done"? Hey, wait Hachimaki! Make sure you pay me back, I bought this for you, you know! And you owe me for these apology candies, too!

TANABE:
Sempai? I am.. I may be no good at EVA work, but I do think I'm pretty lucky.
It was sure luck that I got into this company, and got a space assignment.

TANABE:
If it's okay with you, why don't we buy a lotto ticket?
You know, together! Who knows?
Maybe we will win a grand prize and get rich!

TANABE:
Hey! where is the spirit!
Is that Hachimaki headband just for show?
I might be a useless rookie, but you don't see me sitting around and sulking about it!
I thought you said you were gonna work hard until you had your own spaceship!
Isn't getting a spaceship your dream, Sempai?

Hachi:
Give it a rest, will ya!
I understand... It's all clear now.
A measly debris collector could work for decade and still not able to buy a real spaceship of his own.

Hachi:
It's totally hopeless.
What's changed these past three years?
I'm still a low employees with no savings.
I pick up a debris day-in and day-out, and I still don't have enough money to buy one of these spacesuits, much less xxx spaceship!

Hachi:
You'll figure it out soon enough.
Even if you say you're gonna make your dream come true, there's some things you can do and some things you can't!

ANNOUNCE:
GO-S27, this is Bay Control.
Movement of gantry frame to final position complete.
Exposure confirmed.

CAPTAIN:
Status?

CHENG-SHIN:
Sir, Units A, B and C, all systems go.
We can launch at any time.

CAPTAIN:
Are you feeling a little nervous?

CHENG-SHIN:
Yes, sir.

CAPTAIN:
That's good kid. Your cargo this time is human beings. It's a big responsibility. You should be as nervous as you can.

CHENG-SHIN:
Yes, sir.

FEE:
Hachimaki, make your approach on the satellite from the direction of the damaged dish.
It looks like its control systems are half dead.

Hachi:
I know. I'm the one who smashed the thing.

FEE:
Since you know about it, I leave the cleaning to you.

I copy.

TANABE:
Sempai, about this space debris...

Hachi:
Yeah, yeah, I know about it. Oh, man.
Nothing has changed over these past three years.
Neither one of us has...

TANABE:
What? did you say something?

Hachi:
Let's get rid of this thing.

TANABE:
Oh, right.

Hachi:
Listen, I'll do all the basic work here.
You just try to stay out of the way till I'm done. You copy?

TANABE:
Huh, I copy.

Hachi:
We've got a debris that has moving parts this time,
If you don't wanna get killed by having your face smashed in, don't open your face guard.

TANABE:
Right, I copy.
I can't handle watching things on a monitor screen...
I'm terrible at games and stuff...

Hachi:
You stay put over there until I turn off the control panel.

TANABE:
Huh? Wait! Give me a minute!

Hachi:
Watch out for the arm.

TANABE:
Arm? What? Hey. Watch it!

Hachi:
Collision alert?
Crap, she did the same damn thing I did!

TANABE:
Um.. Did I... Did I do something wrong?

Hachi:
Damn it, that stupid rookie...!
Okay, automatic controls are cut.

FEE:
Hachi, can you bring it back on manual?
You are pretty far outside of your predicted orbit.

Hachi:
Yeah, as there's propellant left in the other engine, so I...huh, that's weird.
The thruster's not responding.

FEE:
It's not? Okay, we'll postpone the...

Hachi:
Hold it! We finally caught this thing, so I'm gonna use the Fishbone to try to decelerate it.
In the meantime, I'll go check out the thruster.

FEE:
Understood.
Careful, you're gonna run out of the wire in next twenty seconds.

Hachi:
I copy.

FEE:
Tanabe, I'm sending Yuri out to you, so stay put where you are.

TANABE:
Yes, ma'am.

FEE:
Brace yourself for impact.
Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five, Four, Three, Two, One, Zero.

 

FEE:
Okay, Hachimaki, How's the thruster look?

HACHI:
Crap, the antenna dish film is tangled up in it.
As this is gonna take a while to unravel.

FEE:
Yuri, go out and recover Tanabe, you copy?

YURI:
I copy.

HACHI:
Fee, I think I can get the thruster straightened out.

FEE:
Okay, that's good.

HACHI:
Ahhh!

FEE:
Hachi, what's wrong?

HACHI:
Ah!

FEE:
Hachi!

HACHI:
I got hit by the wire, but I'm okay.
My suit's still functional.

FEE:
Sorry, I didn't catch it on the monitor.
There is not much secondary debris, though.
But that impact changed your vector again, so-...oh, no, this orbit is...

CLAIRE:
GO-S27, do you read?
This is Control Section.
There is a risk of a nearmiss with debris DBR-072-1414 on your flight path.

CAPTAIN:
What's Half Section doing?

CHENG-SHIN:
What about an orbit change?

CLUE:
Is there enough time?
It's coming straight at us, so relative velocity is too high.
Deploy debris bumpers!

CHENG-SHIN:
Yes, sir!

ANNOUNCE:
This is the pilot speaking with a short announcement. We will begin immediate anti-impact preparations to ensure our safety during atmospheric reentry. I'd like to thank you in advance for your cooperation.

FEE:
Hachi, get back here ASAP!
You're in the shuttle's orbit!

HACHI:
Hey, Wait a minute, I know that shuttle.
That's the one Cheng-shin's on!

TANABE:
Sempai! Get out of there!
Losing the mass of one person might-

HACHI:
Shut up! If I left, what would happen to the shuttle?
This is one time when failing or running away isn't an option!
It ain't an option!

TANABE:
But Sempai! The shuttle has debris bumpers!

HACHI:
There's no way that it can protect it from something this big!

FEE:
Hachi...

HACHI:
Damn it, I haven't even gotten my spaceship yet...

TANABE:
Yuri, we've got to help him...

YURI:
All we can do is have a faith in Mr. Hoshino's skills.

CONTROL:
GO-S27, this is entry approach.

CAPTAIN:
It's no use! Even if we accelerate, there is no enough time.

HACHI:
Its auto functions are totally dead...
so, just I'll have to do it by hand.
Good, this one's still online.
Fee! Give me a real-time feed of the course data for the shuttle in the debris!

FEE:
You got it!

HACHI:
Here goes.
Judging from the remaining of propellant, I've only got one chance. And I have to thrust through the center of mass of a spinning body, or it's over.
Can I pull this off?

HACHI:
Man, can I really do this?
Stay focused...
Not yet, stay with it.
A little more,
and the position will be along the center of gravity...

CAPTAIN:
Those Half Section guys did that?
It accelerated and moved into a higher orbit.

HACHI:
Hahaha...
Well, I'll be! I actually did it!
See that? Cheng-shin!

YURI:
Mr. Hoshino!

TANABE:
Sempai!

HACHI:
Huh?

YURI:
Are you all right?

TANABE:
Oh, no. Darn it...

HACHI:
Hey, rookie, don't be in such a rush, all right?

TANABE:
Pardon me?

HACHI:
You're just getting started here, rookie.
There's really no rush, take your time, and build it up in a little steps, okay?
You got it?

TANABE:
Ah, I guess..

HACHI:
Give it three years.
Nah, make it five and I'll have you whipped into shape.

TANABE:
Five years, huh?

HACHI:
Wait, you didn't see my breathtaking EVA work, did you?
You'd better make it ten!

TANABE:
It just keeps climbing, doesn't it?

YURI:
Um...Who's gonna write up the letter of apology for this one, huh?
