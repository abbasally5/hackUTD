  Space debris, loose materials generated as a result of space development, can often pose a serious threat to spacecraft and people who work in them. 

CLAIRE:
Our recurring profits are maintaining a steady growth of 15 percent.
Second Department is at the top again this quarter.

DOLF:
But that department also has a section that's running in the red.

CLAIRE:
Half Section, sir?

DOLF:
Hmm...

CLAIRE:
Huh, my apologies, sir. I mean Debris Section.

DOLF:
As you know, debris collection expenses are paid according to environmental points set by INTO.
But they're just bureaucratic figures, and they don't necessarily provide enough points to cover our expenses.

CLAIRE:
In other words, to bring Debris Section numbers into the black,
we're going to need to get INTO to assign us debris that has a high point value. Nevertheless...

DOLF:
Which brings me to my point.

CLAIRE:
Huh?

DOLF:
Claire, could I ask you to do something for me?

CLAIRE:
What would that be, sir?

HACHI:
Target acquisition, you copy?

TANABE:
I copy.

HACHI:
Zoom in.
TANABE
:
I copy.

TANABE:
Hit confirmed.

HACHI:
Target change. Yaw right.

TANABE:
I copy. Huh? wait! I can't...

HACHI:
Like I keep telling you, you always open up too many windows!
I told you to keep it simple, didn't I?
You got that, rookie?

TANABE:
Hey, could you please stop with all that "rookie" stuff already?
It's been a whole month since I started working here, you know.

HACHI:
Only a month, you mean.

TANABE:
So, how many months do I have to work before you call me by my name?

COLIN:
Yo, is this anyone's hairspray over here?

HACHI:
Hm?

COLIN:
I forgot to bring any. My hair is a mess because of the zero-G.

HACHI:
Hey, who the hell are you?

COLIN:
Wow, this is cheap stuff!

HACHI:
Hey! I'm asking you a question!

COLIN:
Didn't your mother ever teach you to give your own name before asking for someone else's?
Oh, well, my name is Colin Clifford.
You've heard of me?

LAVIE:
Colin Clifford... huh? Wow! Clifford!
I'm sure I know that name! Hang on a second!

TANABE:
What's that book? Huh?

LAVIE:
A list of key people that you need to know to survive here at Technora!

COLIN:
Hmph.

TANABE:
What do you mean by key people?

LAVIE:
I mean bosses and clients. In a company, you'll always be fine if you know who's who. You'd do well for yourself to remember that! Yes! there it is!

TANABE:
Christopher Clifford, currently chairman of ... INTO?!

LAVIE:
No! under that!

TANABE:
Eldest son's name is William. Second son is...

COLIN:
...is named Collin Clifford.

HACHI:
What?

COLIN:
So, are we all clear on that?

HACHI:
So what? Big deal.
Non-personnel aren't allowed in this office.
So you can't...

COLIN:
It doesn't look much like an office to me.

HACHI:
Huh?

HACHI:
Who do you think you are, you wannabe amateur astronaut?
Unauthorized personnel keep us from doing our job, so get out!

TANABE:
She's from Control!

COLIN:
Just in time.
These people don't seem to be interested in hearing what I have to say.

CLAIRE:
I'm terribly sorry.
He and I will be accompanying you on today's debris retrieval mission.
I assume that's okay?

HACHI:
Don't assume anything! We shouldn't have to take care of this daddy's boy...

LAVIE:
Y-Yeees, of course it's okay! Okay, like the O.K. Corral! We're with you!

COLIN:
I'm glad to hear it.

PHILIPPE:
Oh, I see. So, you're going to a law school, are you?

LAVIE:
You're planning on becoming a lawyer then, huh?

COLIN:
It doesn't matter what kind of degree I get.
My father will make sure I get into any job I want, so, all I really need is the title of college graduate.

PHILIPPE:
Ah... those are my...

COLIN:
Guess that's the way the world works, huh?

PHILIPPE:
Yes, it certainly does.

LAVIE:
That's a wise observation, sir. Hey, Tanabe, go get him some coffee.

COLIN:
Nah, that's all right. You only have cheap stuff, right?

LAVIE:
Oops! Well, you certainly have us there, sir.

COLIN:
Do you have any cola? Something that isn't light or diet.

LAVIE:
Get him a cola!

TANABE:
But we don't have any cola.

LAVIE:
Then go buy some!

COLIN:
Oh, common, let the girl stay here.
It's no fun talking with a bunch of old guys, you know?

LAVIE:
Yes, sir! I'll be honored to go buy some cola for you...

COLIN:
Fine, make it quick.

LAVIE:
Rrright!
I transform into Ultra Lavie!

CLAIRE:
Yeah, hi, it's me. Right.
Please move the DS-12 to the VIP gate.

HACHI:
Don't plan things out on your own.
I haven't okayed anything.

CLAIRE:
He's only here to observe debris collection. We won't interfere with your work.

HACHI:
No way.

CLAIRE:
This is an order from the Director.

HACHI:
But why does it have to be us?
Go make the PR Section do it! Leave us alone!

CLAIRE:
Because we're doing this to help you.

FEE:
In other words, you're doing INTO a favor to get them to assign us some good debris, right, Claire?

CLAIRE:
You'll never turn a profit if you collect nothing but junk with low environmental points.

FEE:
Hey, if we turn a profit, will you build us a smoking room?
That thing is a little too cramped to be comfortable.

CLAIRE:
We'll see, okay?

FEE:
Oh, this is sweet!
You've got yourself a deal! Hey, Hachi, you're a grown man, so you'd better get over it!

CLAIRE:
If that's settled, then?

HACHI:
Aw, come on...

CLAIRE:
Colin?

COLIN:
Oh? We're going already?
We'll pick up where we left off aboard the ship.

LAVIE:
Young master! I, Arvind Lavie, have taken the liberty of providing you with a cola!

Oh? Don't need it now.

PHILIPPE:
Take care! Thank you for visiting!

LAVIE:
Hope you make some fond memories!

COLIN:
Yeah, see ya.

KEITH:
Hey, Hachimaki, I thought you had five people on board.

HACHI:
It's six. Somebody from Control and a social studies student who's here to observe.

KEITH:
You can't just add people. And you've gotta get authorization to carry non-personnel.

HACHI:
So they can't go without permission?

KEITH:
Of course not!

HACHI:
You heard the man! Geez, that's too bad.

HACHI:
I guess your study will just have to wait for a while.

MAN:
Hey, it's okay, it's okay. He's cleared.

HACHI:
Huh?

MAN:
I got a word about it from the bosses this morning. He's the Chairman's son.

KEITH:
Sorry about that. Five passengers confirmed. Please go right ahead, sir.

TANABE:
Huh? Five people? Let's see now, me, Sempai, Fee, Yuri, and the lady from Control Section. What about Colin?

COLIN:
Like I said before. This is how the world works.

HACHI:
Way the world works, my ass.

LAVIE:
Hey, Tanabe!

PHILIPPE:
Wait!

TANABE:
Sir?

PHILIPPE:
We're counting on you!

LAVIE:
We need you to smooth things over to make sure Hachi doesn't insult him!

TANABE:
Huh? But why me?!

PHILIPPE:
The chairman of INTO could have an employee here fired so fast his head would spin off into orbit!

LAVIE:
Plus, you're just about the same age as Colin.

YURI:
Miss Tanabe.

HACHI:
Stop fooling around, rookie, let's go!

TANABE:
I'll be right there! I'm coming!
PHILIPPE:
I'm counting on you, Ai! I couldn't possibly start a whole new carrier at my age.

LAVIE:
And I have a wife and seven hungry children to feed back down on Earth!

TANABE:
Okay, I get it. I'll try to keep Sempai reined in, if I can...

PHILIPPE:
Make sure of it!

LAVIE:
You copy?

TANABE:
Yes, sir. I copy, sir.

DOLF:
Yes, sir. Yes, sir...
It's no trouble at all, sir.
We'll deal with all the matter secretly, of course.
Yes, Chairman Clifford. Just leave it to us.
And in return, about those debris assignments... Good.
I look forward to our future dealings.
COLIN:
Okay, then...! Next up is a salute pose!
Oh, man, this is fun!
Wow, that was close.

TANABE:
Huh, would you please try to be careful?

COLIN:
So, are you guys gonna let me do any debris collecting later?

HACHI:
Hey, this isn't a game, you know. If I gotta keep hearing you talk smack, you go out the airlock!

TANABE:
Sempai, can we talk?

HACHI:
What now?

TANABE:
He's the son of the INTO Chairman. What are you doing?

HACHI:
The chairman's a bigshot. He'd never touch us lowly debris collectors.

TANABE:
Yes, he would! What if he decided to downsize us? What about finding new jobs or our kids?

HACHI:
Wait, since when do you have kids?

TANABE:
Try it softly, okay? Please try.

COLIN:
Are you done with your chat? You'll be rewarded, so you do your part. And show me what I need ...

HACHI:
Hey, what do you think you're doing! Don't bust up our ship!

TANABE:
But doesn't that happen all the time?

HACHI:
Oh, so you're on this guy's side, huh, rookie?

TANABE:
I'm on his side?

COLIN:
Wow, this ship is a real heap. It doesn't hold a candle to the one my father owns.

TANABE:
Huh? they really are some, Sempai. Some people really do own their own ship.

HACHI:
You hear that? It CAN be done.

CLAIRE:
You still have that notebook, Hachimaki?

HACHI:
Yeah, what about it?

CLAIRE:
Nothing really, I was just thinking that you never change.

COLIN:
Hey, does this ship have any kind of weapon systems, like anti-debris missiles or pulverization drills?

HACHI:
Of course it doesn't have missiles or drills!

PHILIPPE:
Hmm, I wonder if Hachi is getting along with Colin.
Say, Lavie. What's that you've been working on there?

LAVIE:
I'm doing some research. I'm finding him a gift just in case Hachimaki does something rude.

PHILIPPE:
Better make it a box of soft sweets, then! Remember the Chairman is getting on in years.

LAVIE:
Yeah, that's why you're Chief. Huh! How about Seven's local specialty cosmic cream cakes?

PHILIPPE:
I hear they're quite the rage. They supposedly sell out by noon. Oh! Ah! it's almost noon now!

LAVIE:
[We've got to / We'd better] get going!

PHILIPPE:
Wait! My wallet!

LAVIE:
I have mine!

PHILIPPE:
Hey, Lavie! Wait for me! Darn it, wait! Lavie!

LAVIE:
Hurry up!

EDEL:
It's time for our noon break, so I'm going out to lunch now.

TANABE:
Sempai?

HACHI:
Whaddaya want?

TANABE:
That Claire lady from Control...is she an acquaintance of yours?
She knew about your note book, so...

HACHI:
Hey, don't stop working, rookie?

TANABE:
It's Tanabe.

HACHI:
We joined the company at the same time. Of course, we only talked each other for the first year. She is a Control Section elite, and I'm a lowly Half Section debris hauler.

TANABE:
Hmm...

COLIN:
It's a good ship but it's nothing to write home about.

CLAIRE:
You think so?

FEE:
That's 'cause we've got no budget. Heck, it's the same story everywhere these days.

COLIN:
Oh, really? That's so depressing.

TANABE:
Hey, we're back.

FEE:
Good work.

COLIN:
I was watching. You looked cool out there.

TANABE:
Oh, well, thank you very much.

COLIN:
Hey, would you like to work part time as my instructor?

TANABE:
Huh?

COLIN:
Some friends and I went spacewalking a while ago, but we were all over the place.

TANABE:
Huh? You weren't supervised by a professional?!

COLIN:
Well, we did bring a pro along, but he was just this old man who just ragged on us. A girl would be a lot better, don't you think?

YURI:
Fee?

FEE:
You finished, Yuri?

YURI:
Yes, I put everything in the container, Fishbone and all.
I thought we'd turn the whole things over to Material Section.

FEE:
Sure, that's fine.
All right, then, all that's left now is to return to Seven. So, I'm adjusting our course to 24 degrees.

CLAIRE:
35 degrees.

FEE:
Hm?

HACHI&TANABE:
Hm?

CLAIRE:
Please make our heading 35 degrees.

HACHI:
Wait a minute. What the hell are you saying?

CLAIRE:
I want to take him on a fly-by at Ukawa communications satellite.

COLIN:
Gosh, I love to see the Ukawa.

HACHI:
We're making a side trip on the way home from work?

CLAIRE:
It's only a little way out of your orbit, and adequate fuel and air supplies shouldn't be an issue.

HACHI:
That's not the point, you know it!

CLAIRE:
Departmental Director's orders.

HACHI:
Not that again!

FEE:
Changing heading to 35 degrees.

HACHI:
You're joking, right?

FEE:
I take it this course has been pre-authorized, Miss Control Section?

CLAIRE:
Of course.

FEE:
I copy.

COLIN:
Thank you.

HACHI:
I thought you hated spoiled kids who rode on their parents' coattails.

CLAIRE:
Yes, and I still do, so what?

HACHI:
Then why...

CLAIRE:
I want to move up the ranks

CLAIRE:
The Director could care less about your personal connections or academic background. All that really matters to him is if you deliver results.

HACHI:
Huh, what're you gonna do once you're at the top?

CLAIRE:
That's none of your concern now, is it? You and I are over, as I recall.

HACHI:
Yeah, I wasn't the one who wanted to end it...

CLAIRE:
Could you please enlarge the area around receiver?

FEE:
Yeah, sure...
Hm?

TANABE:
Wait a minute? What's that?

COLIN:
A camera, Galaxy's latest model in fact.

TANABE:
What?

COLIN:
I forgot it here when we were out on that spacewalk I was telling you about.

HACHI:
You forgot it? What did the instructor say?

COLIN:
He was an asshole like you, so he went back to the ship ahead of us.
Honestly, that geezer was so irresponsible.
Amateurs like us were bound to leave something behind.

TANABE:
Yeah, but wasn't there a pre-spacewalk checklist?

COLIN:
Now that you mentioned it, I do remember what-

HACHI:
So in other words, this is totally your fault!

TANABE:
Sempai, please calm down.

HACHI:
Shut your mouth, rookie.
One wrong move and something the size of bolt can take out an entire spacecraft! Do you have any idea how serious-

COLIN:
Man, you're so stupid. That's why I'm having you people get it for me on the sly. Do I have to spell it out?

HACHI:
No way!
You expect us to pick up debris for the likes of this bozo?

CLAIRE:
INTO is a very important client for our company. If you consider his father's influence, this is just part of keeping the client happy.

TANABE:
Is it really?

COLIN:
You really spell it out. Very good, Claire.
See, you can trust people like her. They know which side their bread is buttered on.

HACHI:
Aren't you at least being embarrassed about having your father clean up your messes?

COLIN:
Huh! That's a childish question. Just think about it for a minute. People who are smart, run fast or good at music or languages, all inherited those abilities from their parents. It's exactly the same with money and power.

HACHI:
Don't rationalize this. Counting on your parents is-

COLIN:
Rationalize? I'm not rationalizing anything.

HACHI:
Even if your parents are powerful, you shouldn't use it.
Capitalizing on your parents-

COLIN:
Let it go.
You're showing off your inferiority complex.

HACHI:
What, you bastard?!

TANABE:
Sempai!

FEE:
All right. That's enough! I'll go out!

TANABE:
You will?

FEE:
Yuri, get up here now. Take control of Toy-Box.

YURI:
Huh? Um, I copy.


Well done, Captain. That was a wise decision.

HACHI:
Hh!
I can't believe you're sucking up to the bigshot, too, Fee?

TANABE:
Sempai...

HACHI:
Shut up, you've been kissing his ass from the get-go.

FEE:
Hachi, what's that out there?

HACHI:
What?

FEE:
That's space debris, isn't it? And no matter who left it or why it was left there, it's still debris. And it doesn't change the fact that debris is dangerous. So that someone has to suit up, go out there and retrieve it.
I'm not about to leave that out there where it can hurt someone. Hachi, what would you do if you were me?

ANNOUNCE:
DS-12, now routing from Expose Section to Bay-3.

PHILIPPE:
Welcome back, sir!

COLIN:
Oh, man, I'm seriously exhausted.

LAVIE:
In that case, please choose your drink!

PHILIPPE:
Also, while I realize that this is a shabby gift, please give them to your father.

COLIN:
What are they?

PHILIPPE:
A local delicacy, Cosmic Cream Cakes.

LAVIE:
The cream is made in zero gravity, so the moderate amount of air--

COLIN:
They're way too bulky. Just ship them to our house, okay?

PHILIPPE:
Oh, I guess that never occurred to us!

LAVIE:
We'll send them to your home, right away!

PHILIPPE:
So, how did it go, Ai?

LAVIE:
Did Hachi manage to behave himself?

TANABE:
Well, yeah, pretty much...

LAVIE:
Oh, you didn't have to go to the trouble.

PHILIPPE:
This is an honor, Director!

CLAIRE:
We've returned after successfully completing our missions.

DOLF:
Well done, welcome back to Seven, Colin.

COLIN:
You've been a big help.
I'll make sure to tell my father about it.

DOLF:
Thank you, I appreciate it.
Your chaperone and friends arrived here just a little while ago and have been waiting for you.

CHAPERON:
Welcome back, sir

FRIENDS:
Yo-

FRIEND:
Welcome back, Colin.

COLIN:
Hey, I could've gone to meet you guys.

FRIEND:
No, no, we're on our way back from having a new couch put in my family's cruiser.

FRIEND:
So, we just stopped by!

COLIN:
That's great.

FRIEND:
So, did you get my camera? Was it okay?

COLIN:
Sure, this thing is really tough. I even did a radioactivity check, and the contents are completely fine.

FRIEND:
Boy, am I glad to hear that. The files from the last concert is still on the camera's memory card.

COLIN:
Hey, do you wanna go into the graveyard orbit later and shoot up some fireworks? I got some that'll work in space through some back channels.

FRIEND:
Well, I don't know...

HACHI:
Of all the stupid... What's with this guy.

TANABE:
Hey, chief, how long do you think he's gonna be here?

PHILIPPE:
Ai!

LAVIE:
Humor him, please!

FRIEND:
Yeah, but won't it make even more space debris?

COLIN:
No problem. If that happens, I'll just have these guys clean it up again.

FRIEND:
That's not very gracious of you.

COLIN:
Nonsense.
These people can make a living because there's space debris. I say we should send more work their way. You know, volunteer debris. hahahaha-

HACHI:
You son of a bitch!

TANABE:
Sempai!

CLAIRE:
Hachi!

LAVIE:
Let go!

PHILIPPE:
Stop it! He is an INTO bigwig!

DOLF:
Mr. Hoshino! Release him now. You're forgetting your place.

HACHI:
This is disgusting! Don't you have any pride?

FRIEND:
Yeah!

FRIEND:
Gee, xxx you're so awesome, mister!

TANABE:
Sempai!

HACHI:
Stay out of this, rookie!

COLIN:
So, what are you gonna do now, huh, hotshot?

HACHI:
I'm gonna turn you into the police!

COLIN:
Yeah?

HACHI:
It's a felony to cover up debris evidence. You'll get at least five years in prison.

COLIN:
That's not likely. Boy, you really are dumb, aren't you? My old man has a lot of pull with the INTO police, too. Besides, according to the records, I was never aboard the ship, remember? You could take me to court, but you lose.

HACHI:
You can't get away with anything you want, just 'cause your dad is a bigwig!

COLIN:
In that case, why not just beat me and kick me all you want?
It would costs you your job, of course.
Oh, maybe you just rather quit instead?
That way, your parents would never have to know that you collect garbage in space.

FEE:
Huh?

FRIEND:
Yeah, man, that's telling him!

FRIEND:
You should really know your place! Shame on you!

COLIN:
It's such a shame that you have to do the same pathetic job day-in and day-out. Is space really so important to you that you'd stoop to do even that? How pathetic. Shall I give you some leads for a new job?
At this rate, you people are gonna turn into pieces of space trash yourselves anyway.

HACHI:
That's enou-

TANABE:
Shut up!

CLAIRE:
No, what have you done?!

TANABE:
Hmph!

COLIN:
Why did you just hit me?
I was just about to get this guy fired before he...

TANABE:
You don't have any idea what you're talking about! Debris collectors are as cool as they come, you jerk! We make space safe, and we save people's lives. It's a thankless job, but we do it anyway!

COLIN:
Hey, wait a minute...

TANABE:
A guy who does nothing but talk about his father is the real space trash! And I think it's time to take out the garbage!

COLIN:
T-Take out the...

PHILIPPE:
Stop it, Tanabe!

LAVIE:
He's the son of the INTO chair-

HACHI:
Look, daddy's boy. Get this through your thick skull. We don't pick up debris to make your life easier.

FRIEND:
So, what're you gonna do 'bout it?

FRIEND:
Yeah, show us what you're made of, Colin?

COLIN:
Hm...Mr. Azaria, what is Technora gonna do about this? It's a clear case of violence against a non-employee.

CLAIRE:
We're terribly sorry about this. We'll be dismissing him imme-

FEE:
Oh, I'm sorry, did something happen?

COLIN:
What are you talking about?

TANABE:
Hmm...

YURI:
Yes, that's right. Nothing happened here whatsoever.

FEE:
You see, Director, according to the records, no one was here but us employees. Therefore, no violence against non-employees could've possibly taken place, right?

TANABE:
Oh, is this the way the world works, too?

COLIN:
Don't mess-
H-Hey, somebody help me!

FRIEND:
Colin, what're you doing?

MORON:
C'mon, Colin! Hang in there!

FRIEND:
This is not cool...

COLIN:
Y-You can try to hush this up, but it's not gonna work, you hear me?

FEE:
Oh, yeah? Well then, bring it on, you little punk!

HACHI:
Mess with us, and we'll all testify against you.

PHILIPPE:
Let it go, Hachi...!

COLIN:
That's playing dirty, damn it! What the hell, you're just a bunch of low life jerks! You jerks!

ELEVATOR:
Next stop, level seven, Technora office block.

DOLF:
I'm terribly sorry. Please give the Chairman my sincerest apologies.

CHAPERON:
No, sir. You've done us a great service. Thank you very much.

COLIN:
Huh? Where did they go?

CHAPERON:
They left claiming urgent business.

COLIN:
What the... how could they do that...

DOLF:
Well, we'll excuse ourselves now.

COLIN:
You'd better remember! I can drive Technora out of space with just a word to my father!

CHAPERON:
Mr. Clifford, that is quite enough. Any further statements you make will have only your own self-confidence to back it up. Just write this off as a valuable learning experience. Or would you prefer I report every detail regarding this incident to your father?

CLAIRE:
I have no excuses. If I'd only stepped in more quickly.

DOLF:
No, don't apologize. Just make up for it by working even harder.

CLAIRE:
Yes, sir.
Huh...What about Hachirota Hoshino?

DOLF:
Unlike his spoiled son, Chairman Clifford is a clever and calculating man.

CLAIRE:
Sir?

DOLF:
Rather than force us to fire an employee, it's to his advantage to consider this matter closed. That's probably what he's thinking on.

CLAIRE:
Yes of course, sir.




PHILIPPE:
Haaaa...

FEE:
How long are you gonna keep moping? Look at me, I've already given up on ever getting that smoking room.

YURI:
Besides, nothing is ever gonna change our status as Half Section anyway.

TANABE:
I'm so sorry, I wasn't thinking.

PHILIPPE:
Why couldn't you just hold it in?!

LAVIE:
Resignation! The work team should resign! Do that, and they might forgive us!

TANABE:
What?
HACHI:
At times like this, bosses are supposed to step in and take the blame, right?

YURI:
Oh, really? Captain?

FEE:
Manager?

LAVIE:
Chief?

PHILIPPE:
What? But why do I have to?

LAVIE:
'Cause you're the man who's in charge, so take one for the team.

TANABE:
Aw, What about a pay cut?

LAVIE:
That's a good idea.

PHILIPPE:
We'll all give up our bonuses this year.

LAVIE:
But then I won't be able to make my child support payments.

HACHI:
Aw, I don't care any more. Wanna go grab a bite to eat?

LAVIE:
Huh?

FEE:
Good idea. Work's done, after all.

LAVIE:
Hey, wait a minute, Fee.

FEE:
Well, let you and the Chief take it from here.

HACHI:
Okay, I've got it.
What do you say we go eat in the common block for once?

FEE:
You coming too, Yuri?

YURI:
Of course. I think we should splurge a little on ourselves, too.

PHILIPPE:
But Lavie?

LAVIE:
Does it have to be a pay cut?

HACHI:
Hey, Tanabe! You coming?

TANABE:
Huh?

HACHI:
The foods in the common blocks are a little expensive, but it's great. You haven't eaten there before. Right, Tanabe?

TANABE:
Tanabe, not rookie...

TANABE:
Coming!
Wait a minute, you're paying, right, Sempai?

HACHI:
As if.
Don't you know? This is coming out of your severance pay?
