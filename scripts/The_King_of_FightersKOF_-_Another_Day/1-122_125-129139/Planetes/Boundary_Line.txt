ANNOUNCE:
This is an official announcement. Technora shuttle GO-L28, scheduled for arrival in...

TANABE:
So, you're really asking me to dinner?

CHENG-SHIN:
Do I not meet your standards?

TANABE:
No, no, it's really not like that at all.

CHENG-SHIN:
Good! So, then, it's a date! How about dinner at Starney's? Or would you prefer Japanese?

TANABE:
Um... Anything is fine... Um... Um, I'll let you decide.

CHENG-SHIN:
1900 hours tomorrow is okay?
Um... Where should we meet?

TANABE:
Sure. 1900 hours is fine.

HACHI:
We have debris sorting, remember?

TANABE:
Oh, yeah, that's right.
I'm busy tomorrow, so how about the day after?

CHENG-SHIN:
All right. Then, the day after. Now, where do you wanna meet?

TEMARA:
Excuse me.
Which way do I go to find Technora?
Oh. Um, wait just a minute, please.
Here. This is my card. Are you familiar with the country of El Tanika?

HACHI:
South America. Upstream along the Amazon River.

TEMARA:
That's right! I'm surprised you knew about it!

TANABE:
Yeah, me too.

HACHI:
It's really no big deal. Somebody I know was born and raised in El Tanika, and she told me all about it.

CLAIRE:
Roger. GO-S25, taking free, go.

MAN:
I copy. Taking free.

CLAIRE:
GO-S25, now switching from Seven Departure to Link Connection Control. Transferred to Joint Tracking Control for your reentry approach.

MAN:
I swear, that's the clunkiest spacesuit I've ever seen. Considering the state of the art in El Tanika, I'm sure that's the best they can do.

DOLF:
Perhaps. But the ability to connect directly to the Navstar system without a mother craft is interesting.

MAN:
In that case, you should have people from Control Section do the adoption testing.

MAN:
You're trying to foist this off on us?

MAN:
No, you know, I wouldn't do that. It's just that if that feature is main selling point, then, someone from Control Section should do it.




Ah, just I wanted to see. Take care of this, will you, Claire?

CLAIRE:
Huh?

MAN:
Adoption testing for a spacesuit. Go through the motions and show him out.
Over there.



TANABE:
Anyway, it all happened so suddenly. I hardly even remember what we talked about. I'm pretty sure he mentioned Japanese food, but I think I remember hearing "Chinese". He'll call once he made reservations.

LUCIE:
But what about Diaper Man?

TANABE:
What?

LUCIE:
He asked if you were seeing anybody, didn't he?

TANABE:
Hmm... Yeah, he did, but it seemed like it was [just] out of curiosity.

LUCIE:
Don't be silly! Of course it wasn't!

TANABE:
There hasn't been any reaction from him at all since then, and when I think about it, I don't see how he could possibly be interested in me.

LUCIE:
Why is that?

TANABE:
Well, we don't get along very well, we have different interests, and he's rude, crude, stupid, and [insensitive] .

LUCIE:
Oh, I get it now! You like Diaper Man, right?

TANABE:
What on earth makes you say that?!

LUCIE:
You've got an intense love ray shooting out of your eyes like this. You see, shoon! And if you follow those love rays of light, [we'll point at the hiding / where they're pointing at that hitting ??? ] smack the middle of Diaper Man's heart. I can see them, plain as day.

TANABE:
Yeah, well, I don't see that thing.

LUCIE:
No, of course, you wouldn't. You're that kind of girl.

TANABE:
Hmm?




CHENG-SHIN:
Hey, Hachi. Do you know of any foods that she really doesn't like?

HACHI:
She's not exactly the delicate type, you know. I'm sure she'll eat whatever's put in front of her. I swear, I just don't get your taste in women. There are tons of cute girls over in Astrogation. Is this like how gourmet eaters like to eat really weird and disgusting stuff? I wouldn't go out with her if you begged me. Look, I know you don't want to hear it, but--

CHENG-SHIN:
Hachi. Even if you ask me to give her back later, I won't do it.

TANABE:
What? Hey, it ain't like she belongs to me, all right? Ah, it's none of my business, anyway.

CHENG-SHIN:
Hachi, are you and Claire still--

HACHI:
Hey, don't dig up ancient history! Unbelievable... Is this what you asked me here for? If you like her so much, why don't you do your own damn research!


TEMARA:
Ah...! This is delicious... I wish the people back home could taste this well.
You know, I just can't get over the fact that you come from El Tanika, too.

CLAIRE:
I was only born in El Tanika, and that's all. I'm an American citizen.

TEMARA:
Wow, your Control Section is the elite of the company, right? I tell you it makes me so happy to hear that a fellow El Tanikan is up here working on the front line of space.
Hmm?

CLAIRE:
I'm all done eating, Mr. Temara. I'll meet you later at the Bay Office, all right?

TEMARA:
Um... Claire? I hope you don't mind, but, could I trouble you for that butter there?

CLAIRE:
Yes, of course.

TEMARA:
Great. Thank you.
Um... Something wrong?

CLAIRE:
No.



ANNOUNCE:
This is an announcement from Materials Section. [You xxx / Your submitted] purchase order for equipment, it must be reported Materials Section--

TANABE:
I've got Love rays, huh?

HACHI:
What's with you?

TANABE:
Eh...

HACHI:
If you've got something to say, say it. You know how much I hate that.

TANABE:
Um... well, all right, then. I was wondering, can you see any "love rays" here, Sempai?

HACHI:
What the heck are those?

TANABE:
I heard that when you like someone, they shoot out of your eyes just like laser beams. Are they shooting out? Of my eyes, I mean.

HACHI:
What? Are you an idiot or something? You're talking about aliens!

TANABE:
Okay... I guess not...

HACHI:
Who's the hell the idiot who fed you all that garbage?

TANABE:
Yeah, well... I guess you just can't see them...




MAN:
Hmm... Ah, can we just say we tested it? You can put our name on the forms if you want.

CLAIRE:
I understand. We'll try another section.
Let's go.
HACHI:
Here.
What did those people who were just in here want?

MAN:
Said they wanted to run an adoption test on an EVA suit made by some country.

HACHI:
El Tanika, right? I saw that suit in person a little while ago.

MAN:
Oh, really?

HACHI:
You gonna test it out?

MAN:
Not a chance! We'd never use a clunker like that. {?] Testing it is a big waste of time.

HACHI:
You think so? I thought it was interesting.

MAN:
Sounds like the other sections have been turning them down, too. Here you go.

HACHI:
Aw...



MAN:
Not if you were giving it away.

TEMARA:
[xxx, won't you reconsider / You won't? You reconsider (??)] , sir?

MAN:
If we bought this thing, it would ruin our corporate image.



TEMARA:
Well... Thank you, Miss Claire. I'll try to other companies. Who knows, maybe I'll--

CLAIRE:
It'll be the same.

TEMERA:
Huh?

CLAIRE:
It doesn't matter where you go. None of them will take anything produced in a country like El Tanika seriously. Most of the time, they won't even let you get up to the starting line.

HACHI:
Hey.

CLAIRE:
Hachi?

TEMARA:
Oh, thank you for your help earlier.

HACHI:
That spacesuit of yours. You want me to test it for you?

TEMARA:
Do you really mean it? This means so much to me! Now, all I have to do is find a support team for the space testing!

CLAIRE:
What are you up to?

HACHI:
You don't want any help from me?

CLAIRE:
Of course. If it will make my job go more smoothly, I'll gladly take you up on your offer.

HACHI:
Don't read anything into it, okay? I just thought it looked interesting.

LAVIE:
What a strange spacesuit...

PHILIPPE:
I think even I could fit into this one!

YURI:
Hey, Fee. It kinda looks like your smoker seat.

FEE:
It sure does.

TEMERA:
Please try to think of it, more of a spaceship than a spacesuit. For one thing... See? Inside, your hands are completely free. If you want to carry your PC in suit with you, you can type on the keyboard with your own hands.

ALL:
Wow.

PHILIPPE:
So, you can eat snacks in it, too?

TEMARA:
Of course!

YURI:
I could fix my contact lens if it slipped?

TEMARA:
Yes.

FEE:
Hey, can you smoke in it, too?

TEMARA:
Yes, if you upgrade the air scrubbers.

FEE:
All right! I'm gonna like this baby! Hey, Control Section. Order me one of these, will ya?

CLAIRE:
We'll discuss that when and if it passes the tests.

FEE:
Heh, heh, heh... Oh. Right.
Hachi! Go and get your spacesuit prepped!

HACHI:
Right!

FEE:
Lavie, you need to get all the test permits files, right away!
LAVIE:
What are you addressing your superior?
FEE;
Yuri, get us time in the extreme environment simulator room.

YURI:
Understood.

FEE:
Hey, buddy. Just leave everything to us. Don't worry about the things.

TEMARA:
Oh, thank you everyone! Thank you, thank you so much!



CLAIRE:
Increasing from level 70 to level 90.

HACHI:
In-suit radiation exposure level climbing from 20 to 21 and holding steady. Standard requirement, passed. Second item on the checklist, clear.

PHILIPPE:
H-Hey! Help me out!
Somebody please help me! I'm stuck in the hatch! I can't get out!

YURI:
Try not to move!

HACHI:
You're too fat, Chief!

TEMARA:
Oh...

CLAIRE:
Time's up.

HACHI:
What now? Try again for the 17th time?

CLAIRE:
Let's let him do some retuning and try again tomorrow.

HACHI:
Good idea... Your system's tuning is too touchy. You'll never be able to do zero-G work if you don't put some more slack into it.

TEMARA:
I understand... I'll work on fine-tuning it.

CLAIRE:
We'll see you tomorrow, then. If you manage to clear this test, you'll have completed the basic testing. After that, there's just a space test left.

TEMARA:
Oh. Do you really mean it? I'll do my best, then!




HACHI:
Yeah!

CLAIRE:
Work completed within specified time. That concludes the basic testing. You made it.

TEMARA:
Oh, thank you everyone!



MAN:
Hey, do we have any step motors left?

MAN:
We're all out. Sorry.

MAN:
Ah... Then, we'll have to break down the prototype for parts...

MAN:
If it still has any.

MAN:
This is El Tanika Technica. State your name--

MAN:
Director!
Hey, everybody! It's the Director!


MAN:
So, you're really up in space, aren't you?

TEMARA:
Settle down, everyone. Our suit is now undergoing adoption testing at Technora.

MAN:
Seriously?! - Awesome!

TEMARA:
To tell you the truth, the other companies slammed the door in my face, but one for Miss Claire here has done so much to help us.

CLAIRE:
I didn't really do anything.

TEMARA:
Now, the best part of all this is that she's an El Tanikan, just like us! Not only that, she's one of Technora's elite!

MAN:
She's so cool! - And she's a babe, too!

TEMARA:
We're going out into space tomorrow to conduct the final tests. So, please, pray for me, okay?




TANABE:
I'm really sorry! Please forgive me. They're making me help out on a spacesuit test that Control Section is conducting.

CHENG-SHIN:
It's not your fault. These things happen. We'll try again some other time.

TANABE:
I'm sorry. Sempai volunteered us without asking.

CHENG-SHIN:
Hachi did, huh?



MAN:
I thought I told you to get rid of him.

CLAIRE:
Whether or not a suit is formally adopted depends on the testing results. So, we are obligated under the Space Industries Equal Opportunity Agreement to--

MAN:
We took it under consideration. We looked at the brochure.

CLAIRE:
I already have the division manager's authorization to conduct the space testing tomorrow. I will be overseeing it personally, so it won't impose on your time at all, Chief.

MAN:
Huh, you're still sticking to the division manager's coattail like glue, I see...

I guess, 'Cause that old man was in a bind.

TANABE:
You mean Claire, don't you?

HACHI:
Hun.

TANABE:
Do you still have feelings for her?

HACHI:
I said we broke up, didn't I?

TANABE:
That doesn't answer my question.

HACHI:
It's none of your damn business!
Idiot, if you don't treat those panels gently, they'll break apart!

TANABE:
I'm sorry. I, um... Guess I broke the handle.




TEMARA:
We started off by doing underwater testing down around Lake Wagutchi.

CLAIRE:
At the foot of Mt. Oag?

TEMARA:
Yes, that's right. See, we didn't have the budget to build a testing pool. By the way, I have to admit, I'm amazed that you remember such a tiny lake.

CLAIRE:
My family and I went swimming there once when I was a little girl.

TEMARA:
That's terrific.

CLAIRE:
An inscription for luck?

TEMARA:
Oh, I see that you can't read El Tanikan.

CLAIRE:
I learned reading and writing and math right after we got to America. I was already eight years old, but in America, I knew less than a typical kindergartener.
In El Tanika, there was never anyone who would teach me how to read and write.

TEMARA:
It was the same for me. I was illiterate until I was nearly 10 years old. My family and I fled to China, and it was there that I first learned how to read and write. I stayed there until I earned my degree, and then I went back to El Tanika soon after college.


CLAIRE:
But, why would you do that?! El Tanika is a mass of economic sanctions and fighting!

TEMARA:
That's exactly why I did it.
It isn't military power or ideology that will save El Tanika. I think rebuilding our industrial capacity is what will make our country prosper. I'm trying to bring space jobs to the people of El Tanika. Now, I know that companies from the first-world countries have the most clout in space business. But that's no different than down on Earth. If it's going to be a gamble, then I'd rather gamble on dreaming the biggest dreams! Ha,ha, Maybe that was a little over the top...
Oh, that's right... This line here reads "Caligan Parak." This one reads "Sistero Tados." And this one "Nurgan Ogran."

CLAIRE:
Are those names?

TEMARA:
Yes, that's right.
When this spacesuit was completed, everyone in the research lab took turns writing their names in it. Due to the budgets, I was the only one who could make the trip out here, but we'll all be flying it together.

CLAIRE:
From your point of view, ...does it look like I abandoned our country and ran away?

MAN:
Commander, it's from headquarters.

MAN:
Temara Poitier. An El Tanikan. He left port aboard a Technora debris hauler at 1024 Zulu Time.

HAKIM:
He's aboard a debris hauler?


HACHI:
Any temperature variation?

CLAIRE:
It's at 19 degrees. It's doing great. Well within international standards.

HACHI:
It's not much to look at, but this thing performs pretty good.

TEMARA:
Often, those who are unattractive tend to be the ones with high IQ's.

CLAIRE:
Good thing for you, Hachi?

HACHI:
What's that supposed to mean?

TEMARA:
A ship is closing in.

FEE:
Hachimaki, we're calling off the testing for the time being.

HACHI:
Huh? What's going on, Fee?

FEE:
We still have the dayside tests to--

HAKIM:
This is INTO OSA vessel Cresta-53, Please halt current operations immediately.
Consider this a warning.

HACHI:
Hakim?

HAKIM:
This is OSA vessel Cresta-53. You're hereby ordered to hand over the El Tanikan man by the name of Temara Poitier.

TEMARA:
Oh...

CLAIRE:
What's the meaning of this?

HAKIM:
On the morning of the 18th, INTO peacekeeping forces invaded the country of El Tanika.
We have been ordered to take all El Tanikans outside the country into protective custody. This action is pursuant to Article 11, Clause 2 of the INTO charter. As such, we ask that Mr. Poitier accompany us immediately.

TEMARA:
I won't!

HACHI:
Don't do it! That'll blow you away along with your spacesuit!
Fighting against these guys won't do you any good. Anyway, Mr. OSA, sir, can you just give us a few minutes?

HAKIM:
I'm very sorry, but we have no time to spare on this matter.

HACHI:
Geez, you civil servants aren't very flexible, are you?

TANABE:
Eh... Huh? Sempai! What's going on?!

FEE:
Huh? Ah, hey!

HACHI:
Mr. OSA, sir, Our Fishbone is malfunctioning!

MAN:
Commander!

HAKIM:
Stay calm. They're already under out control.
Impound team, get to work on securing the debris retrieval ship.

FEE:
This is bad... I've gotta get Hachi under control.

YURI:
Fee, the main engine is starting overheat!

FEE:
Not again?! Crap!

CLAIRE:
Get back! You're gonna disobey the OSA?! Do you want to be a criminal?!

HACHI:
Don't get the wrong idea. Look, it was just an accident.

TANABE:
Yes, an accident. Our ship is really really old. It malfunctions all the time while we're on the job.

TEMARA:
Mr. Hachimaki! It looks like the sun has come out!

HACHI:
I copy. This is gonna be our only chance, so let's finish off those dayside tests first!

CLAIRE:
Wait a minute, Hachi.

HACHI:
I can't wait! We don't have that kind of time!

CLAIRE:
I'm trimming down the operation procedures. Let's hurry. We don't have much time, remember?

HACHI:
Huh... Right!

MAN:
Commander, I can close in on [them / ] right away, sir.

HAKIM:
No. Let's hang back and see what happens.

CLAIRE:
Cooling system test, clear.

TANABE:
I copy. There's only one more item to go on the checklist.

HACHI:
What's the last one?

CLAIRE:
Depressurization recovery. We see if it can repressurize within 45 seconds.

HACHI:
I copy. Old man, use your arms to stabilize the body.

TEMARA:
Right.

HACHI:
Here goes... 45 seconds... Timer set.
Ready when you are.

TEMARU:
Right.

CLAIRE:
Watch out for depressurization sickness.

TEMARA:
I will.

HACHI:
Old man, close the valve!

TEMARA:
Eh... Right!

HACHI:
It's closed!

TEMARA:
Please... give me strength... Caligan... Alonzo... Sistero... Morogul... and Demla... Urmuti... Zumtan... Tilban... Golomoro... Lakium... Nirpa... Tolmol... Lokuc... Uraraki... Sunnu... Luciber... Nurgan... Lopek... Claire Rondo...
CLAIRE:
Huh...

HACHI:
Count's at zero. How's it look, Claire?

CLAIRE:
21kPa. It meets the international standards!

TEMARA:
Did we do it...?

HACHI:
You sure did! Be happier, old man! This means that your spaceship makes the grade!

TANABE:
This is great! It meets all world standards!
TEMARA:
It meets international standards...? El Tanika's first... I can't believe that our first spacesuit meets the standards?

HAKIM:
Looks like you're done repairing your work craft. Don't make any more trouble for me, Hoshino. I don't want to shoot you if I don't have to. Sensei Gigalt would have my hide.

HACHI:
C'mon, why don't you just let him go, Hakim.

HAKIM:
I can't do that.

HACHI:
Hum.

HAKIM:
Now, please come with us, Mr. Temara.

CLAIRE:
Just a minute. I'm sorry, but we can't turn him over. This prototype spacesuit is a trade secret that belongs to our company. This applies to the test subject's biometric data. Article 11, Clause 2 of the INTO charter does not sanction the infringement of personal or corporate assets.

HACHI:
Damn it, Claire!

CLAIRE:
I'm responsible for this test! I'm obliged to protect company employees and trade secrets! Right now, he is under our supervision, and has nothing to do with El Tanika.

HAKIM:
I took the liberty of recording your statements just now and it'll be included in my report.

TEMARA:
It's all right, that won't be necessary. Commander, I'd like you to take me into custody now.

CLAIRE:
Temara?!

TEMARA:
Thank you, Claire Ronde. It makes me happy that you feel this way.

CLAIRE:
Then why are you--

TEMARA:
We've already done enough.
Given the current situation in our country, I doubt that any company would ever adopt our spacesuit. But regardless, our spacesuit has met all of the international standards required for use. That fact has been documented, and that should give the others who will follow in our footsteps the confidence to keep going.
Miss Claire, you shouldn't be like you ran away. You should stay up here in space, and do what you do. Please shine up here where we can look up and see you streaking through the sky. That's something that every one of us can be proud of.
Commander, would you please give me just one more minute to look at the Earth before we go?

HAKIM:
Fine, go ahead.

TEMARA:
Thank you.
It's beautiful... I just wish that everyone down there could see this...
Oh, it's El Tanika! Oh, I can see Lake Wagutchi! Ha,ha,ha, it looks so small and it's significant from up here!

TEMARA:
Why...? Why does it have to be this way? From up here, you can't see any borders or countries or armies...

All you can see... is the Earth...
