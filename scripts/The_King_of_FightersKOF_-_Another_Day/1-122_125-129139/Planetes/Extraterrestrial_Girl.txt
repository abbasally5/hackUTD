  Abandoned artificial satellites.
Tanks jettisoned from space shuttles.
Refuse generated during space station construction.
Debris of all shapes and sizes are traveling around the Earth at speeds approaching 8 km/s.
Should this debris collide with a spacecraft, it could result in a terrible accident.
For this reason, mankind has been confronted by the necessity of collecting this debris.
This is a story of 2075, a time in which this space debris has become a major problem.

Hachimaki:

Nono:

Lucie:
 It'll take you a week to recover?

Cheng-Shin:
 So you're gonna end up spending all your time off cooped up in the hospital?

Hachimaki:


Tanabe:
 But how come the ninjas have already been discharged.

Hachimaki:
 With all that stuff they do, they're used to taking falls in low gravity.

Fee:


Hachimaki:


Fee:
 Hachi, you got hurt while playing ninja.

Hachimaki:
 Can't you shut your mouth.

Tanabe:
 It's not good to tell lies.

Hachimaki:
 This happened to me because of those stupid neighbors of yours!

Tanabe:
 That's why I've been trying so hard to make you feel more comfortable.

Cheng-Shin:
 Hachi, why don't you just take advantage of this and go back to Earth to recuperate?

Tanabe:

Hachimaki:
 What's that?

Tanabe:
 A get-well gift, it's an apple.

Hachimaki:
 You're kidding!

Tanabe:
 They said it was grown right here in lunar soil.

Hachimaki:


Roland:


Hachimaki:
 Well, I guess you can't expect'em to grow the same as they do on Earth.

Tanabe:
 It looks delicious, doesn't it?

What do you think?
You wanna go shoot around after we get out of here?

Man2:
That's a really good idea.
But my muscles have been shot ever since I was admitted here.

Man1:
See, that's why you should go.
You've got to get up and get moving.
Man, it feels great.
The ball flies six times farther than back on Earth.
You feel like you've turned into the main character of a golf comic!

I guess I'll try to make a black hole in one, then!


Doctor1:
Did you find him?

Doctor2:
He's not in B Ward.

Doctor1:
How about you?

Doctor3:
I've double-checked the monitors, no sign of him.

Doctor2:
Hey, what if he isn't inside the hospital anymore.

Doctor1:
Maybe we shouldn't have told him.

Doctor3:
Should I report it?

Doctor1:
That'd cause trouble.
Let's look for him for a little while longer.
