  2068(twenty sixty eight), The tragic and disastrous accident with Alnair 8 suborbital passenger liner focused public attention on the problem of cosmic junk orbiting the planet, space debris.
Abandoned artificial satellites. Tanks jettisoned from space shuttles. Refuse generated during space station construction.
Debris of all shapes and sizes are traveling around the Earth at speeds approaching 8 km/s(eight kilometers per second).
Should this debris collide with a spacecraft, it could result in another terrible accident.
And so, to prevent such a tragedy from ever happening again, as well as for the sake of further space development, disposal of this debris has become a necessity.
This is the story of people who live in a time such as this.

jettison : 投棄される、～を投げ捨てる

Tanabe:

Claire:


Lucie:
What were you thinking Tanabe?
Shabo:
The sign said "Control Section" as plain as day!
Tanabe:
 You guys could have said something, you know...
Lucie:
That's what you get for trying to impress everyone with a grand entrace.
Vanry:
 Say, wasn't that the guy who gave the speech at our welcoming ceremony?
Shabo:
Yeah, the operations manager.
Tahabe:
 Uh?
Lucie:
Looks like one point deduction.
Tahabe:
 Geez, it's not like my workshop grades were all that great -
Lucie:

Shabo:
Yeah, but she came in second at the company dance competition.
Vanry:
 Dance?
Shabo:

Tanabe:
 Only two of us actually competed.
Shabo:
 I didn't know that.

 Well, who in their right mind would sign up for something that embarassing?
Lucie:
 I'm amazed you entered
Tanabe:

Lucie:
 See you later Tanabe, I got to go left to get to the spaceflight section.
Vanry:
 Maintenance too.
Shabo:
 I guess this is good bye for now.
Lucie:
 That's the elevator that will take you down.
Tanabe:
 Come on! I'm not a kid, you know.
Vanry:
 Just be careful ok?
Tanabe:
 Of what?
Vanry:
 Don't fight back against drama queens or dirty old men.
Shabo:

Lucie:
 And you don't pay your attention to your surroundings.
Tanabe:
 I don't?
Shabo:
 No, you don't.
Vanry:
 See you at lunch.
Lucie:

 Well, for one thing, they have a much bigger staff than we do.
 Hachimaki:
 Yeah, but those guys don't even use spacesuits!
Tanabe:

Hachimaki:
 Huh? who the hell are you?
Tanabe:

Hachimaki:
 Hey, don't blow people off when they're talking to you.

 Ha?
Philippe :

Lavie:
 Yeah, but it's like that at the debris sections of every other company, Chief!
Philippe :

Hachimaki:

Lavie:
 Hachi! What if she quits?
Hachimaki:
 If that's enough to make her quit, we're better off without her.
Fee:

Tanabe:
 No, I...
Fee:

Tanabe:
 Oh, please to meet you.
Fee:

Tanabe:
 She's a temp, you say?
Fee:
 I wish they'd send us temp superiors like her.
Lavie:
Fee! Critisism of like that-
Fee:
 Huh?
Lavie:

Fee:

Tanabe:
Hachimaki:
 Get off my case! I didn't give myself the nickname!
Fee:

Tanabe:
 Huh?

Lavie:

Clerk:
If we custom-made every spacesuit we use,
we'd be bankrupt in no time. Customizing parts of them is good enough.

Clerk:
One-size-fits-all spacesuits is in next room.

Tanabe:
Thanks.
Clerk:
Hey! Wait a second!

Tanabe:
Yes, ma'am?

We can't have you leaving your oversized garbage lying around.

Tanabe:
Yes, ma'am I'll take it off your hands, right away.
Tanabe:
How does it look?
Clerk:
Just great! Nice body!

Clerk:
Okay, we'll run face panel tests next. You know how to do that, right?

Tanabe:
Yes, sir. I learned that during our workshops.
Clerk:
All right then, let's start with axis alignment. Try setting your artificial horizon to Earth.

Tanabe:
Yes sir.
Hachimaki:
Man, this is all Control Section's fault.
Hachi's friend:
Hey, you're Hachi.
Hachimaki:
Hey.
Hachi's friend:
What's up that debris everyone's talking about?
Hachimaki:
I don't know. The top brass are still fighting it out.
Time for your next stop, diaper girl!
Tanabe:
Come on, senpai! You don't have to shout it out.
Tanabe:
I guess…this is the real thing.
Hachimaki:
Well…that oughta do it.
Tanabe:
Senpai, that's one more than what's on our requisition list.
Hachimaki:
Come on! Having an extra won't kill us.
Tanabe:
We can't take this one! we have to do this by the book!
Hachimaki:
Aw, of all the stupid!
Tanabe:
That's not where it goes! Please return it to the next shelf over where you found it!
Hachimaki:
You take things way too seriously
Tanabe:
And you don't take them seriously enough!
Hachimaki:
Yeah, yeah, yeah,…
 You work real hard and be serious enough for the both of us, okay?
Hachimaki:
Hey, maybe I'll put in some food, too…
Tanabe:
Is everyone else here really like this?
Hachimaki:
Huh?

Tanabe:

Hachimaki:

Hachimaki:
How lucky, the fact that you were able to join this company is proof of that!
Tanabe:
Well, you have a point there. But it's kinda different from what I expected
Hachimaki:
We'll need these, too.
Tanabe:
Hm? What's that?
Hachimaki:
You've never seen a porno mag before?
Tanabe:
That's not what I mean! Why would we wanna take something like that with us?
Hachimaki:







Tanabe:

Shabo:
I'm not surprised. That's Half Section for you.
Tanabe:
 Half Section? You know, someone in Control Section called them that.
Vanry:

Lucie:

Tanabe:
 Enough! I'm gonna stay there!
Lucie:
Oh, you're?
Tanabe:
 They're not gonna beat me! Not diaper man, not any of them!
Lucie:
W-well, give it a shot.
Tanabe:

half-witted:間抜けな


Tanabe:
Hey, stop it! I can do it myself!
Hachi:
Pipe down.
Tanabe:
Oh, c'mon! Don't tell me you're still mad about earlier.
Hachimaki:
Of course I am! You hit me as hard as you could!
Fee:
Hachimaki, all our departure paperwork is done.
Hachimaki:
Right.
Fee:
Stop horsing arround, Tanabe. Hurry it up.
Hachimaki:
You heard her?
Tanabe:
So we're really going out into space, huh?
Fee:
Now, we can't do our job if we don't go out into the field.
Tanabe:
But I just got here today! I don't know anything about ships!
Yuri:
Hey, don't worry! You'll be just fine. This ship has been flying missions for over 30 years.
Tanabe:
Wait just a minute! Are you trying to tell me that the DS-12 is that old?
Hachi:
Toy Box.
Hachimaki:
Real spacers never call a name by its number.
Tanabe:
Somebody help me!
Claire :
DS-12, DS-12. this is ISPV-7. Comm system multi-channel check. Do you copy?
Fei:
Yeah, I copy.
Claire :
DS-12, this is ISPV-7. This is an abort indicator test.
Fei:
I copy. Check nominal.
Tanabe:
I knew it, they're different when they're on the job...
Hachimaki:
Hey, rookie! Go get a barf bag and stand by!
Tanabe:
I've taken space sickness pills!
Fee:


Dolf:


Fee:
Separate main umbilical.
Claire :
Separation complete. Do you copy?
Fee:
I copy. we're away.
Claire :

Fee:
Wow...
Hachimaki:
What do you think? Pretty cool, huh?
Tanabe:
Yeah! Way cooler than from a shuttle...Uh...senpai?
Hachimaki:
Oh, man...it broke off again?
Tanabe:
Again?
Hachimaki:
Well, this ship is a heap after all.
Tanabe:
You're kidding, right? You're kidding, righ!?
Philippe :
Wait! You're kidding about this, right?

Lavie:
Brilliant, Chief! I'll take that idea and run with it right away!
Philippe :
It is a company banquet, we have to pay attention to these things, you know.
Lavie:
Hey, we'll use recycled paper to make a Mr. Nora.
Philippe :
Our way of contributing to society!
Edel:




Hachi:

Tanabe:
Huh?
Hachi:
It means, "Do you get it?", rookie. You copy now?
Tanabe:
Ah...I-I understand...I mean, I copy.
Fee:
Okay. Are you two ready? We're gonna be coming up on the plate in just a minute.
Tanabe:
The plate?
Fee:


Hachi:
Your first priority is to scrap it by causing it to drop toward earth.
Tanabe:

Hachi:
Debris that can't be used as raw material gets dropped to earth and burned.
Tanabe:
But...it is a plate with a message of peace!
Hachi:
Yeah, as if something like that could ever bring about peace...
Tanabe:

Hachi:
 Have you listened to that naive crap you're spouting, rookie?
Tanabe:
 And anyway, you think that-
Fee:

Tanabe:
But, why do we have to scrap it?
Fee:
 
Tanabe:


Claire:

Dolf:
INTO is starting to get jumpy understandably.
Claire:

Dolf:



Tanabe:
Um, Senpai I'm a little bit scared...
Hachimaki:
Like they say, the best way to learn to swim is when you're drowning .
Tanabe:
Don't say that! I don't wanna drown in space!
Yuri:
Do you think she's gonna work out? I don't know.
Fee:

Yuri:
Guess you're right. It's just a drop, after all. And Mr. Hoshino's with her
Tanabe:
So, what's this satellite that the plate is gonna collide with?
Hachimaki:
Come on! Didn't you read the mission profile?
Tanabe:
No! I didn't get the mission profile!
Hachimaki:
Oh, you didn't? It's INTO's Dario-14.
Tanabe:
Dario-14? But, isn't that a...
Hachimaki:
Yep, it's a millitary bird.


Hachimaki:

Tanabe:
STOP!
Hachimaki:
 What the hell do you think you're doing?! You stupid rank amateur!
Tanabe:

Hachimaki:
 What are you saying? One's a functional satellite, and the other's a plate that's just floating there. How can you compare the two!?
Tanabe:
There is nothing to compare! Which is more important!? Peace or War?
Hachimaki:

Tanabe:
Oh, yeah? Well, I think that the satellite ought to be hit by the plate and be destroyed!
Hachi:
 What the hella...
 If we did that, it'd just make more debris! You idiot!
Tanabe:
Haaaah, H-Hey,...hey, wait, my feet...I'm drowning...
Hachi:
 Now, come on! We have work to do!
Tanabe:

Hachi:

Tanabe:

Hachi:
 Complete!
Tanabe:
 What?
Hachi:
 Target point reached.
Tanabe:
 But, wait a minute... This is INTO's logo...
Hachi:
 This is the memorial plate.
Tanabe:

Hachi:
 Big talk, considering they started the conflict in the first place.
Tanabe:

Hachi:

Tanabe:

Hachi:
 Forget it. You just sit there. You copy?
Tanabe:
 I copy.
Claire :
DS-12, this is ISPV-7. Please report operation status.

 So, you're saying that's why you waited for more than 15 minutes?
Hachi:
 What the hell other reason would there be?
Tanabe:
 So you mean you didn't do it to give the children of Mananga a bright shooting star of hope and peace in the sky as a present?
Hachi:
 Huh? What's all that bleeding-heart sap you're spouting, diaper girl?
Tanabe:

Hachi:
 That's how you talk to your Sempai?
Tanabe:
 That doesn't enter into this at all!
Fee:

Tanabe:
 I mean, Don't you have any tact, Sempai

 Hey! Stop pointing your finger at people!
