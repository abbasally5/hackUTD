  Abandoned artificial satellites. Tanks jettisoned from shuttles. Refuse generated during space station construction. This vast amount of junk floating in space, space debris, is a very serious threat to everything in orbit. This is a story of 2075, a time in which this space debris has become a major problem.


LAVIE:
Medical checkups are only good when you make an appoint to get one every year like clockwork.

HACHI:
Enough, already! I came here, didn't I?

FEE:
So, why the sudden change of heart? You haven't come for a checkup since you were hired.

HACHI:
Well, I, Eh--

TANABE:
An astronaut has to take good care of himself! Right, Sempai?

HACHI:
Yeah. Sure.

PHILIPPE:
That's right! A person's the greatest posession is his health! We should all get our checkups together from now on.

HACHI:
Yeah. Great.

TANABE:
Hey, what about Edel? She isn't here.

PHILIPPE:
Oh, that's because she's a contract worker.

LAVIE:
Right, only regular employee get the free medical checkups.

TANABE:
Oh, yeah. I thought it was strange that someone as punctual as Edel would play hooky.

HACHI:
I've never even seen he show up late for work.

YURI:
And she's never late submitting her paperwork.

PHILIPPE:
That girl really has her act together.

LAVIE:
Yeah, but, I think she's a bit too tightly wound? She could stand to loosen up, you know.

HACHI:
I've never seen her smile.

TANABE:
You know, now that you mention it, it's kind of hard to imagine Edel laughing about everything.

EDEL:
Debris Section, right?

TANABE:
Yeah--

EDEL:
Well, follow me to the reception desk.

LAVIE:
- What the--?

PHILIPPE:
Edel? What are you doing here?

EDEL:
So, there will be six of you, then?

TANABE:
What's goin on, Edel?

EDEL:
Nothing's going on. I work here part-time twice a month.
Now, could we please get you checked in as quickly as possible? I have another job after this.

TANABE:
What? You have another job besides this one? Why so many?

EDEL:
It doesn't conflict with my contracted work hours at Technora. All right, this way, please.

GIGALT:
The deal will be made right here at Seven. This trio arrived and boarded just here yesterday.

MAN:
Why did they keep coming up here to make their deals?

HAKIM:
Seven is under INTO law. If they are caught, the punishment are less severe.

GIGALT:
Hakim, it's not our place to decide what their punishment would be.

HAKIM:
Yes, sir.

GIGALT:
We'll arrest them as they make the deal. Make sure we catch the maniar-

HAKIM:
Sensei! Gigalt Sensei!
Call the doctor! Hurry!

MAN:
- Yes, sir! Right away!

TANABE:
Earrings! But they might not look good on me. Still, it's our first date, so why not?

EDEL:
So, how much longer are you gonna look after this sea cucumber?

YURI:
Well, I don't know. After all, it was a gift from Third Division.

TANABE:
Oh. Unless someone else once say, I'm gonna keep it as a pet.

EDEL:
An animal like this one?

TANABE:
Yeah.

EDEL:
Oh, I see. In that case, please file a personal effects form.

TANABE:
Okay.
Hmm, maybe nice to wear earrings for a change.

EDEL:
That's for Lingum piercings.

TANABE:
Ah, Lingum? What's that?

EDEL:
It's a tongue piercing. They go through the underside of the tongue.

TANABE:
Huh, really?

EDEL:
They wouldn't look good on you.

TANABE:
What?

EDEL:
Earrings.

TANABE:
You don't think so?

EDEL:
No. I really don't think so at all. They just wouldn't suit you.




HACHI:
Hey, which one do you think look better?

TORMORD:
The right one, I think. But if you wear that, you're really gonna want something on your neck. Like a choker.

HACHI:
I don't have a damn choker. Why don't you let me borrow one!

TORMORD:
'Cause I don't have one, either.
Hey! Cheng-Shin!

CHENG-SHIN:
You guys need something?

TORMORD:
I need a favor. You've got a nice choker, don't you? I want to let Hachi borrow it.

HACHI:
Ah, no! Uh, that's okay! Hey, what's that you got there?

CHENG-SHIN:
Oh, that's the pamphlet for the Jupiter project. I hear they're going to put out a call for Von Braun crew members inside Technora.

HACHI:
You're gonna apply for it?

CHENG-SHIN:
Yeah, but the competition is probably gonna be tough. How about you, Hachi? It sounds really exciting.

HACHI:
Who, me? Well, I... Nah, it's hopeless! They're just gonna pick people from Control and Astrogation. They'll laugh when they hear I'm from Half Section. Hey, wait a minute. You've always talked about wanting to be the captain of the Von Braun, haven't ya? Give 'em hell, Cheng-Shin!


LAVIE:
Hm? You want Tanabe? She's taking a personal day today.

EDEL:
Well, today is supposed to be the deadline for her to renew her EVA license. And she hasn't turned in her registration for the sea cucumber.

LAVIE:
Hey, being one day late is no big deal, you know?

EDEL:
If a temp worker like me put off doing her job, I'd be let go! Please don't assume that I'm an official employee like you are.

LAVIE:
Look. I have a lot going on right now. And anyway, I'm your superior. You could even say I'm your employer. But forget about that.
This thing is harder than it looks. Do you know any good tips for playing it?

EDEL:
Mail?
Wait, this address is Sasha?!

Astrogation : 宇宙飛行

HACHI:
Say something, wouldya?

TANABE:
Um, okay. Like what?

HACHI:
Anything.

TANABE:
All right, Sempai. I'm curious how long you've had feelings for me?

HACHI:
What kind of question is that?!

TANABE:
You told me to say "anything," didn't you, Sempai?

HACHI:
How long has it been for you?

TANABE:
Well, let me see. I think it was...
I think maybe it was when I first went out into space with you.

HACHI:
Oh, really?

TANABE:
Okay, Sempai, now it's your turn. I told you, so now you go!

HACHI:
Well, I'm really not... Well, I-

CHENG-SHIN:
Hachi?

TANABE:
Cheng-Shin?!

HACHI:
Um, we were just, that is, we were...

HAKIM:
They here?

WOMAN:
Two of 'em. This one hasn't showed up yet.

HAKIM:
He stayed in the hotel, huh?

WOMAN:
What now?

HAKIM:
I've got Hugo covering the hotel. We'll stick to the plan and stake out the restaurant.

WOMAN:
Hakim!

HAKIM:
Hm?

WOMAN:
How's Old Man Gigalt doing?

HAKIM:
He's still on the hospital.

WOMAN:
Oh...

HAKIM:
Hey, it's Gigalt Sensei. By the time we have this mission wrapped up, he'll-
Hmm? Hoshino?

WOMAN:
Friend of yours?

HAKIM:
Look, this is not good. Change the plans. We'll let Ron's team handle the restaurant.



HACHI:
I guess, I'm acting like a real bastard. I kind of knew how you felt all along, but I lied to you anyway. I'm so sorry. I never meant to lie to you, but how I felt, but... No, that's just an excuse. 'Cause, from your point of view, it's just a betrayal. Look. Hit me. Or kick me. I deserve it!

CHENG-SHIN:
Deep down, I knew.

HACHI:
You did?

CHENG-SHIN:
Yeah, she'd been turning me down lately.

TANABE:
I'm really sorry.

HACHI:
Cheng-Shin, I, uh...

CHENG-SHIN:
Don't worry about it, Hachi. It's not like Tanabe and I were married or anything. Hey, I don't think I have a claim on, you know, just because we slept together.

HACHI:
Eh?!

TANABE:
What?!

HACHI:
Yeah... Yeah! I guess not... It's not like we're grade schoolers or anything. It doesn't mean-

TANABE:
We didn't do that! Tell him!

CHENG-SHIN:
Sorry, sorry. I was just kidding about that. Tanabe and I never even kissed.

HACHI:
You know, you have a warped personality!

CHENG-SHIN:
Just call it a little payback. You can allow me that much, can't ya?




MAN:
Very good work, Dolf. Second Division was the clear leader again this quarter.

DOLF:
Thank you, sir. We try.

MAN:
What do you say, Dolf? Would you care to join me for a drink later tonight?

DOLF:
No, thank you, sir. I'v already made plans. I'm sorry.

MAN:
Turning down the Executive Vice President. Who does that arrogant fool think he is?

MAN:
The next Executive VP, quite possibly.





EDEL:
Assistant Chief, would you mind if I took the afternoon off today?

PHILIPPE:
Uh?

EDEL:
Even contract workers are entitled to paid time off. With the supervisor's consent.

PHILIPPE:
That's okay, Edel. We'll pretend that you were here working.
You always do such great work here. Besides, everybody is taking the day off today. You don't have to be so formal about everything. Just be sure to make up the hour you take by the end of the month. Okay, Edel?

EDEL:
I'm sorry, sir, but time off is time off.




HACHI:
Man, that Cheng-Shin sure has a mean streak in him, doesn't he?

TANABE:
So, what do yo want to do now, Sempai? Um... I mean, Hachirota?

HACHI:
Ha?! Hey, why did you call me that?

TANABE:
Well, I can't keep calling you Hachimaki Sempai, can I?

HACHI:
No! Absolutely not! You just call me Hachimaki!

TANABE:
But, since we are going out, I thought... You call me by my name, so I should also-

CHAPEAU:
Tanabe?

TANABE:
- Ah!

VANLI:
You have the day off, too?

CHAPEAU:
Am, how do you do? I'm Chapeau, I started with Tanabe.

HACHI:
Oh, I'm Hoshino. I work down at Debri Section with Miss Tanabe.

CHAPEAU:
Hoshino? Wait a minute, you mean, Diaper Man?!

TANABE:
Gee. Chapeau, Vanli, I'm really sorry. We're in a bit of a hurry.

VANLI:
Hey! Tanabe! Why don't you introduce us, darn it!



HACHI:
Geez, why do we keep running into all these people we know?

TANABE:
It just can't be helped. This promenade is the only place on Seven where people can go for fun.

HACHI:
So, what do people do at times like this?

TANABE:
Why don't we just go aboard Toy Box? If we go there-

HACHI:
No, that's where we work. It just wouldn't feel much like a date there, you know? Geez, isn't there anywhere else?

LUCIE:
Tanabe and Hachi! What are you doing?

TANABE:
- Lucie!

HACHI:
Great. Here we go again.

LUCIE:
You two are sillies. Seven has its own little rules for dating. Didn't you know that?

TANABE:
Um, isn't this a-

LUCIE:
Yep. Seven's only place for overnight lodgings. Hotel Spica.

TANABE:
A hotel?!

LUCIE:
What are you shouting for? Geez!

TANABE:
But, but it's a-

LUCIE:
Come on, it's not like you're gonna stay here overnight. You get the room for a few hours, and you eat, watch a movie or whatever. There's really no other way to be all by yourselves on Seven, you know?

HACHI:
Oh...

LUCIE:
Don't worry. Everybody does it. Of course, if you really want to, you could always spend a night.

HACHI:
Um, I wouldn't, that is, I... Um...

LUCIE:
Look at you, getting all flustered!



CLAIRE:
The firms that we've ordered in the past are on the list I gave you the other day. This is a list of companies that have recently been added.

MAN:
Well, I suppose I'll go ahead and take it. They're all companies in developing countries, right? We'll never place any orders with them.
Any work related to the Von Braun gets priority.

CLAIRE:
Understood, sir.

So, INTO's business only goes to member of the First World club. I guess somethings never change.

Hachi?

TANABE:
Wow! Look at how big this room is! A projection TV! You can watch movies on this! Wow! This potted plant is real! Wow-

HACHI:
- I've told Tanabe how I feel, and she's okay with it. And we've kissed. And we're both adults, too. I guess that covers just about everything as far as kinda thing goes.

TANABE:
Sempai, look at this! A balloon-style rescue ball! Look at how small it-


TANABE:
I-I'm sorry, Sempai.

HACHI:
Tanabe, I...

TANABE:
Ah...
Ahhh! Sempai!

HACHI:
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-

TANABE:
No, not that! There's someone here!

HACHI:
Huh?

TANABE:
Behind the bed!

HACHI:
Who's there? Hey, come out of there! Are you a thief? A pervert?! I'm gonna call the cops!

SASHA:
Wait, don't! You don't need to be suspicous of me.

HACHI:
Well, how much more suspicious can you get?! You're in our room!

SASHA:
Uh, I, uh... have a good reason.

HACHI:
Oh, yeah, like what?

SASHA:
It's kind of long story. To sum it up in one word, "love," I guess.

TANABE:
Love?

SASHA:
It was love at first sight. We were drawn to each other like magnets. I proposed to her just two week after we met. But we packed more living into those two weeks than I experienced in a whole lifetime. After I proposed, I went to her parents respectfully to ask for approval. I was even wearing a suit, which is, for me, a big deal. But they turned me down.

TANABE:
But why?

SASHA:
They said that they couldn't give their daughter to a foreigner. But I love her and refused to give up, and I went back to their house again, but they already sent her far away to a distance place where I could never reach her.

TANABE:
They sent her where you couldn't reach her?

HACHI:
Into space?

TANABE:
Is she on Seven? Is that it?!

SASHA:
Yeah. That's right. So, I wrote to her and made an arrangement to meet her here in this room today.

HACHI:
Why this room? Is it special?

SASHA:
I wrote down the wrong number. I meant to write room 25, but I put down 35 instead.





MAN:
Old man! Visotor!

CHAD:
Hm? Really? Who is it?

MAN:
Beats me. He looks like he's from a loan company or something.

DOLF:
Been a long time.

CHAD:
Dolf!

DOLF:
We're short on flight directors over in Second Division. How about it?

CHAD:
Me?

DOLF:
Third Division doesn't know how to make the best use of their people. You're no accountant, Chad. You're not cut out for it.

CHAD:
Thanks for the confidence.

DOLF:
It's an accurate judgment.

DOLF:
You know, I don't think you'll never change your eating habits. Not in a million years.

SASHA:
I worked myself half to death these past five years and now I finally have a restaurant of my own. It's small, but our food is great. Next time you're down on Earth, you should come and try us.

TANABE:
Oh, she's here!

HACHI:
What're you doing?

TANABE:
Sasha, what's wrong?

SASHA:
I guess, I'm a little scared to see her again.

TANABE:
I can understand! It's been whole five years!

SASHA:
I'm sorry, could you get the door for me?

TANABE:
Okay.

SASHA:
I'm really sorry about all this.

TANABE:
Please, come in- Ah, Miss Edel?

EDEL:
Why are you here?
SASHA:
H-Hey there, Edel, you seem so different somehow.

HACHI:
Huh?

TANABE:
You mean that Miss Edel is the old girlfriend you were telling us about?!




MAN:
Hey, aren't those guy with the OSA?

MAN:
- Oh, hell!

MAN:
- Crap!

MAN:
Drop your weapons now!

MAN:
Screw you!

MAN:
Get out!

HAKIM:
Hey, are you all right?

CLAIRE:
Hakim Ashmead?

HAKIM:
We keep running into each other.

MAN:
Commander, are you okay?

HAKIM:
Yeah. How's it look over at the hotel? I'm pretty sure the man named Sasha would still be there.

MAN:
Sorry, but the manager said that there was no one in room 25.

HAKIM:
What?





TANABE:
What an amazing coincidence! Admittedly, there aren't a lot of people on Seven-

EDEL:
Be quiet for a minute. Sasha, what did you come here for?

SASHA:
What did you think? I came here to see you.

TANABE:
Sasha here has his own restaurant now. He told us he worked himself to death for you, you know. And, though, it's kinda small, but the food is-

EDEL:
So, you're still using that old con?
TANABE::
Old what?

SASHA:
Oh, C'mon, Edel. How about a little smile? It's been five years, so don't be so cold.

EDEL:
It hasn't been five years. It's been four years and eight months.

SASHA:
Huh?

EDEL:
I've been counting the days. Waiting to we've been apart for five years.

TANABE:
But Miss Edel?

EDEL:
If we stay separated five years, I can get a divorce without your consent.

TANABE:
What?

HACHI:
What's going on here?

EDEL:
This big xxx slime used to be my husband.

HACHI:
Husband?!

TANABE:
But he said that he proposed, and your parents were against it.

EDEL:
You never change. Always making up lies. Milking people for their sympathy!

SASHA:
Ah, C'mon baby. Don't be that way. I came all the way here for you. Just come back to me-

EDEL:
You want to force me to work while you screw around, is that it?

EDEL:
I was always picked by the worst johns. They used handcuffs on me. And whips! And they made me get piercing all over!

TANABE:
Piercings...?

EDEL:
And if I refused, they would just beat me up!
You call yourself a husband?! "'Till death do us part"? "I love you"? They're just empty words for you! You're nothing but a good for nothing pimp!

SASHA:
Eh, Edel, no!

EDEL:
This thing is a wire anchor launcher. They use these to fire big ropes into hulls of ships.

SASHA:
H-Hey, now, if you use that on a person, they would-

EDEL:
They'll die.

SASHA:
Hey Edel, C'mon, cut it out, okay? Please! We've got no parents, no money, and no education. For people like us, that was the only way we could survive. You know that.

EDEL:
You haven't changed one I order. You keep making excuses for yourself, so you won't ever have to try.

As for me, I have a job.

SASHA:
Huh?

EDEL:
Every day, I go to the office, sit at my desk, do my work, and go home at night. I even work part-time jobs in my free time to earn money for school.

SASHA:
That doesn't sound like the Edel I know.

EDEL:
I used to be a fool like you, but now I'm trying to make something of myself. I'm just a temp staffer, but I'll be a full-time someday!

SASHA:
Yeah, all right. I understand. Just put it down. C'mon, baby, you know, I love you, don't ya?

EDEL:
You've got to be kidding me, Sasha. I'll make you go away. And you won't come back.

HACHI:
Tanabe!

EDEL:
Move now!

TANABE:
I won't!

EDEL:
A man like him isn't worth saving!

TANABE:
He isn't the one that I want to save. I'm not gonna let you shoot him, understand?! Every one of us depends on you! You're more useful than the Chief or Lavie, and way more useful than me! Don't throw it all away!

EDEL:
Sasha!

SASHA:
You bitch! You think you're better than me?

HACHI:
Woaaah!

SASHA:
Hey, let go! Get off of me!

HACHI:
Like hell I will!

SASHA:
Hey, get back here!

HACHI:
Move it!

HAKIM:
Stop!

I'm with the OSA. You'll be treated in accordance with INTO criminal law.
You have the right to contact an attorney. You have the right to remain silent.

HACHI:
Well, you're a real go-getter, aren't you, Hakim?

HAKIM:
Yes, I am. Which is why I'm going to need to get statements from each of you later about this.

HACHI:
Fine, fine... I guess this is twice now.

HAKIM:
You and I must have some kind of connection.

HACHI:
Looks that way.

SASHA:
You bitch! You ratted me here out, didn't you! You told me that you love me! Were our marriage vow nothing but a bunch of lies?! What else are you good for besides selling your body?!

MAN:
Come on, get moving!

SASHA:
Please, Edel! Help me! Edel!

TANABE:
Miss Edel, are you...

SASHA:
I wasn't going to shoot him. I just wanted to make sure he'd never come near me again, that's all. Because I'm not... I'm never going back to that cesspool of a town. Or back to that scum of the earth. Not for him or anyone else.

ANNOUNCE:
Members of the regular shift, good morning. It is now very 900, Greenwich Mean Time.
EDEL:
Good morning, Miss Tanabe.

TANABE:
Oh, good morning. You're sure here early. About yesterday, I, uh...

EDEL:
The renewal for your EVA license? It was due yesterday, you know.

TANABE:
It was? Oh, I'm sorry! Um... Where'd I put it?

EDEL:
I filled it out and submitted it for you.

TANABE:
What?

EDEL:
I also filed your registration for the sea cucumber.

TANABE:
Oh... Well, thank you, Miss Edel. Thank you very much.

EDEL:
You can just call me Edel, okay?
