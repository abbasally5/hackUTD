Abandoned artificial satellites.
Tanks jettisoned from space shuttles.
Refuse generated during space station construction.
Debris of all shapes and sizes are traveling around the Earth at speeds approaching 8 km/s.
Should this debris collide with a spacecraft, it could result in a terrible accident.
For this reason, mankind has been confronted by the necessity of collecting this debris.
This is a story of 2075, a time in which this space debris has become a major problem.


Tanabe:
 Wow! Don't you think this subtle floating sensation is the greatest feeling ever?
Fee:
 You mean how it's not zero-G, but not one-G, either?
Tanabe:
 Yeah! It feels like I've turned into some sort of fairy or something.
Hachimaki:

Tanabe:

Hachimaki:
 Now you are a "Fallen angel"!
Tanabe:
 Sempai, stop laughing and help me up, please.
Fee:
 Well, I'll let you get her squared away.
I gotta pop in the Third Division for a quick visit, and I'll join you.
Tanabe:
 Thank y...
Hachimaki:

 The level we're on now has various companies and government administration buildings.
 Shopping centers and residential areas are below that.
 In other words, the bigwigs are up on top,and the commoners all live down below among the teaming masses.
 Speaking of which, where's the place you're renting?
Tanabe:

Hachimaki:

Tanabe:
 Hey, are you renting a place in the Arnould Area, too?

old co-worker:
 Fee!
Fee:
 Oh! You transferred here?
old co-worker:
 I just couldn't keep up with those lifers.
 For a guy from a small company like me, the numbers and pressures were just way too much.
 What's Dolf up to now?
Fee:
 He's still a man who lives for his job.
old co-worker:

Fee:
 Really? I don't know. I don't keep up with the gossip.

Hachimaki:
 Oh, relax. It's just a strange door chime.

Hachimaki:
 Seeing ninjas in the first place is strange!

chief: 
Hachimaki:

chief:
 That's right. It came highly recommended for Japanese people.
Hachimaki:
 Recommended, my ass!
chief:

Hachimaki:
 There's bigger things to worry about!
chief:
 But I've already spoken to the other party, and they're expecting you to arrive...

Kogenta the Mist:

Crimson Ukon:
 And you were wearing the hachimaki headband of a ninja!
Yokozuna:
 We wanted a real live Japanese person to see our moves!
Gennojo the missionary:
 So then... What'd you think of our ninpo?
Sanji the Monkey:
I heard that everyone in Japan has a black belt. Is that right?
Dragon Chang:
Once you reach the upper ninja ranks, you get to marry a geisha girl, right?
Hachimaki:
Geez... Who taught you this crap...?
Kogenta the Mist:

Yokozuna:
You are living there, aren't you?
Crimson Ukon:

Gennojo the Missionary:
I'm Gennojo the Missionary, also room 3.
Sanji the Monkey:
Sanji the Monkey. I'm in room 3.
Jiraiya of Hida:
Jiraiya of Hida. Room 3 as well!
Dragon Chung:
Dragon Chung! I'm in room 3, too!
Tanabe:
You mean you all live in room 3?
site foreman:

Kogenta the Mist:
 We're sorry!
(Jiraiya of Hida):
Thanks for the work the other day!
Gennojo the missionary:
You feel free to call on us again, anytime!
site foreman:
I have all the people I need!
Sanji the Monkey:
Oh, you do, huh? Sorry!
Dragon Chung:
Sorry to bother you!

Crimson Ukon:
We helped out on a construction job there a while ago.
Jiraiya of Hida:

Tanabe:
Uh-huh...

My! What a lovely get-acquainted gift from Mr. Hoshino!
Wasn't that thoughtful of him.
Hachimaki:
Um, I wasn't the one who...
Miss. Sullivan:

Hachimaki:
Um, I didn't...
woman in a suit:
Mr. Hoshino, may I introduce Miss. Citta Sullivan.

Hachimaki:
Right...
woman in a suit:

Mr. Sullivan:

woman in a suit:
Now then, we should give these youngsters some time to themselves.
Hachimaki:
What?! Hey!
 Wait...! I didn't...
Miss. Sullivan:
You know, I just love everything about Japan!

Look, there's been a...

Mr. sullivan:
Honestly, thank you for finding such an excellent match for my daughter.
woman in suit:


Miss. Sullivan:
This time I'm gonna make it work!

Tanabe:
You really do all live here in room 3, don't you...?
Kogenta the Mist:
It's embarrassing to say it, but all of us here are unemployed.
Tanaba:
Oh...
Kogenta the Mist:

Jiraiya of Hida:
We've gravity one-sixth G, we can do the ninpo moves here!
Sanji the Monkey:
Don't get us wrong, we did have jobs at first.
Kogenta the Mist:
A businessman asked us to come here for herium-3 extraction jobs.

Tanabe:
And that's why you're here?
Yokozuna:
My wife and I just had a third baby, so I jumped at it.
Drugon Chung:
My store had just gone out of business.
Gennojo the Missionary:
I had co-signed a loan for an old friend...
Jiraiya of Hida:
I needed the money to pay off debts.

Crimson Ukon:
I had big dreams about working here...
Kogenta the Mist:

Tanabe:
Then you can get out there and look for new ones!
Like ilmenite mining or working the dry-docks!
Kogenta the Mist:
But to get a job on the moon, you need to have a worker visa.
Crimson Ukon:
See the problem is we came here on tourist visas.
Tanabe:
What...?
Kogenta the Mist:
It was our own fault for letting that businessman handle our visas, too...
Jiraiya of Hida:
We got no money to get back to Earth...
Sanji the Monkey:
We manage to stay fed by taking odd jobs...
Tanabe:
Uh...
Drugon Chung:
He-he. Hey, having the girl ninja here really brightens the place up!
Genojo the Missionary:
Uh-huh! Girl ninjas are the best!
Jiraiya of Hida:
It's dull with no one but guys around.
Yokozuna:
A name! We did a name for her! Something nice!
Crimson Ukon:

Tanabe:
This time?
Sanji the Monkey:
Yeah! We used to... Um...
Kogenta the Mist:


Tanabe:
A police car?
Sanji the Monkey:
Maybe it's an ambulance.
Kogenta the Mist:
No, look. It's the fire department train...

Kogenta the Mist:
But, you said that if I found myself a decent job, then you'd reconsider, right?
Mr. Sullivan:
I set up a meeting!
To make certain she wouldn't get involved with another piece of trash like you!
Kogenta the Mist:
You mean... A marriage meeting?!
Mr. Sullivan:
Darn! She could've had a happy life if she hadn't ignored my wishes and married the likes of you!
And we wouldn't have had to pick a husband at this crappy hotel!
Kogenta the Mist:
Wait a second...! Are you telling me that she's still in there?!
Mr. Sullivan:

You no husband! You're lowlife! Lowlife! Lowlife!
Tanabe:

Mr. Sullivan:

Come on, chieftain! Let's show 'em! Let's show 'em what ninpo can do!

Miss. Sullivan:
Damn it! Who the heck cut the power?!

Kogenta the Mist:
I'm all right... I just inhaled a little smoke, that's all...

Hot!

O-rin! Is that you?!
O-rin:
Kogenta!?
Hachimaki:
Huh?! Ninjas?! What are you doing here?!
Kogenta the Mist:
Mr. Hachimaki! You saved my wife?
Hachimaki:

Dragon chung:
Come to think of it, Tanabe said you were astronauts!
Crimson Ukon:
Oh, I get it! Those things are kinda like homemade space suits.
Hachimaki:
If we just had back the way you came in, we should be able to get out of here.
Sanji the Monkey:
We can't go back... The way back is pretty much impossible to get through now.
Hachimaki:
What!?

Jiraiya of Hida:
Yeah, your weight really hits all at once when you touch down.
Hachimaki:
What the hell is going on here?! Chief!

Chief:
If I had told you it was a marriage meeting, would you have agreed to go?

Of course not! As if I'd ever get married!

Mr. Sullivan:
Are you saying that my daughter's not good enough?!

Kogenta the Mist:
Father, I'll work hard to make her happy, so you don't have to worry.

O-rin:


Tanabe:
Chief... Exactly how many months is the lease on my apartment for?

Dragon Chung:
So, when are you planning to move in, Ai?

Chief:


Gennojo the Missionary:
I got it! How about "Shooting Star Ai"?

Tanabe:
Come on, guys. I'm not your girl ninja...

Dragon Chung:
Do you have a paring knife or something?

Jiraiya of Hida:
No, I have a throwing knife!

Gennojo the Missonary:
Hey! I thought they said that they don't allow those in here.

Mr. Sullivan:
He's treating my daughter like dirt, just because she's a divorcee...

woman in suit:


Kogenta the Mist:
O-rin, honey!

O-rin:
Go away!
