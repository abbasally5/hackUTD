I suppose, but it wasn't all bad, was it?
Hachimaki:
Let's just say that I don't ever wanna play tag with ninjas again.

Lavie:

We're not just a Half-Section! Where's your pride?!
Lavie:

Tanabe:

Tanabe:
Stop it! You've got it all wrong!
Philippe:

Edel:

Tanabe:
Okay, bye. Good work today...

Yuri:
Well, I have to say it is a little odd.
Hachimaki:
Pretty lame, isn't it? We're grown-ups and yet we're spying on her.
Lavie:
 Yeah! It's break-up money, I'm sure.
Tanaba:
Oh, stop it, will ya?
Look, I'm telling you she's married and she's even got a little...!
Hachimaki:
Oh, that's kinda stuff doesn't have anything to do with it.
Tanabe:
What?
Hachimaki:
Yeah, If you're really in love, husbands and kids are just about the last thing on your mind, don't you think?
Tanabe:
Is that experience talking...?
Hachimaki:
Nah, I just mean in general.
Tanabe:
So you're trying to say that Fee's having an affair, Sempai!? Is that it!?
Hachimaki:
Why does [that / it] make you so mad? Come on, things happen, that's all.
Tanabe:
That's it! I've had enough!
I'm gonna prove to you guys that Fee's innocent even if I gotta do it all by myself!
Hachimaki:
Hey! Where do you think you're going! Tanabe!
Philippe:
...What do you think we should do, Lavie...?

Excuse me.
Tanabe:
Um, wait... Aren't you...?
Claire:
It's Claire Rondo of Control Section. Ai Tanabe of Half Section?
Tanabe:
It's Debris Section!
Claire:
Well, this is Control Section, if you don't have business here, go back to Half Section.
Tanabe:
Oh, we've got business here, Claire, there's something we want to ask the division manager!
Hachimaki:
That's enough.
Claire:
If he's been having an affair?

Understand, Miss rookie?
Tanabe:
She's not a stranger.

Cheng-Shin:
Oh...
Hachimaki:

Cheng-Shin:
So, did you get a chance to talk to Claire?
Hachimaki:
That's quite a mean streak you got there, you know that?
Cheng-Shin:
Breaking up with her just 'cause your father doesn't help.
Look, [breakups/ a breakup] really [all] have a better reason than that.
Hachimaki:
It's said that about a million times now...
Cheng-Shin:
Right, then [I/ let's] change the subject.
Hachimaki:

Fee:
"Keep working hard, mom?"
Dolf:
I'm going to transfer you to Control Section... as the manager.
Fee:

Dolf:
I need someone who knows what it's like out there.

Fee:

Tanabe:
Excuse me...
Fee:
Don't sneak up on me like that!
Tanabe:
Um... Well, there was something I wanted to ask you...
Fee:
Oh... well, I guess there're some things you can't ask Hachi.
Tanabe:
Well, you see...

Fee:
Now, who are those two people having an affair, huh?!
Lavie:
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!!!
Fee:

Lavie:

Fee:
Geez... It's pretty depressing when the people you work with don't even trust you...!
Hachimaki:
I didn't do anything...
Fee:
Oh, save your excuses!!!
Hachimaki:
Thanks a lot, Tanabe!!!
Tanabe:
Well, don't forget! You guys were completely wrong!
Hachimaki:
Yeah, but that doesn't mean you can just go rat us out!
Tanabe:
Rat you out?!
Yuri:
So then, what was your conversation with the division manager all about, huh?

Tanabe:
Sempai's the one for that kind of thing, sir.
Lavie:

Tanabe:
Actually, it looks like he's already got a girlfriend.
Lavie:
Is that true, Hachi?!
Philippe:

Hachimaki:
I'm not seeing anyone, okay?
Tanabe:
Then who was that girl at the hospital, huh?
Hachimaki:

Tanabe:
Oh yeah, was she taller than you are?!
Hachimaki:

Yuri:
Hey, you don't suppose she's a Lunarian, do you?
Philippe:
A Lunarian?
Yuri:

Tanabe:
Oh...
Lavie:
So, she's got the body of an adult, right?
Hachimaki:
Do you always have to be such a dirty old man!
Lavie:
Okay. Cool off, will ya?

Lavie:

Gehrhart:
Knock it off, the political maneuvering...
Lavie:
Sir?
Gehrhart:
You came to me yesterday to ask about the division manager.
Lavie:
Oh, that's all been sorted out.
Gehrhart:
You were trying to show off that you had a pipeline to the division manager.
Lavie:
Uh... No, that never crossed my mind.
Gehrhart:
Really, you don't know?
Lavie:
Sir...?
Gehrhart:

Lavie:
What?!

Claire:

Fee:

Claire:
We can estimate its position with orbital data we got when it was on dayside.

Pillipe:

Tanabe:
Oh... You're maybe right...
Pilippe:
You wouldn't wanna go there, either, would you, Hachi? Even for advancement.
Hachimaki:
I've never really given much thought to promotions and stuff.
Tanabe:
You wouldn't mind if it meant getting your own spaceship, would you?
Hachimaki:
Are you making fun of me again?
Pillipe:
Hey... We all have our own dreams after all?
Hachimaki:
 your hand as pilot next time out?!
Yuri:
Huh...? Okay.
Hachimaki:

Tanabe:
Um... Okay...
Hachimaki:

Pillipe:
Well, we'd be in quite a bind if we didn't have Fee around.
Hachimaki:

Tanabe:
Sempai!
 Yuri:
Well, if that's the case, I guess we'll just have to.
Manager, we'll need you to take the arm control.
Lavie:
Huh?!
Hachimaki:
You are qualified to run an arm, aren't you?
Lavie:
Well, yeah, on paper!

Pillipe:
What?! You mean me?!

Claire:

Fee:
Yeah, yeah...
Gehrhart:

henchman:
He's got a visitor. You know, the one from INTO?
Gehrhart:
Um... So I guess they're forcing him to hire that old inspector who's retiring.

Lavie:
Well, technically, I'm on the reserve crew, so I thought it'd be good to sit in!
Philippe:
Yeah! And I have to understand the work that my subordinates do!
Fee:
Well, um...
Philippe:

Lavie:
It's the way of the world, "You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours!"

Uh-oh, it's the phone.

Well... If you insist...

managing director of INTO:
Well good. I'm [dxxx / happy that] we were able to have such a productive discussion today.
So I'll just leave this whole matter in your hands, Dolf.
Dolf:
Consider it done. Don't worry.
managing director of INTO:
Mm-hm.

Dolf:
...You parasite.

Lavie:
Okay, but we need to get this done before Fee wakes up.
Tanabe:
Well, we're looking, but there's no sign of it.
Hachimaki:
Yeah, are you sure the orbit calculations are right?
Philippe:
And it doesn't show up on our monitors, right?
Yuri:
Right. But, even though it's pretty close to invisible on radar, you can still see it with the naked eye.
Hachimaki:
I guess, but it's too dark out there!
Tanabe:
I know, but it's supposed to get all gooey when daylight hits it.

companies:

Fee:
Tell me?! Is it true, Dolf?!
Dolf:
Well, I'm sorry, everybody.
I'm sorry...

Fee:


Philippe:
What I can see it?!
Hachimaki:
No, come on! I keep telling you that's Seven.
Lavie:
There! Over there!
Yuri: 
Philippe:
How about over there?
Hachimaki:
You know, pointing at every little thing doesn't help us much either!
Yuri:
Actually, I think that's it.
Lavie:
What?!
Hachimaki:
You're kidding...
Tanabe:
Oh, wow! He's right!
Yuri:
It's not showing up on radar, just like the file says... So that's it!
Philippe:
So I was the one who found it! I did, right?!
Lavie:
Yeah! That's our Chief, all right!? Nicely done!
Hachimaki:
Okay, Tanabe! Let's get to it! We got a little less than 30 minutes left!
Tanabe:
Got it!
Lavie:
Hold on, Hachi!

 Give the word!
Philippe:
Gotcha!
Fishbone, you are cleared for take-off!
Hachimaki:
Oh, come on! Now, stop wasting our time, damn it!

colleague:
Huh?! What's going on?!

What, did you come by to drop off your ferret again?

Yeah, but, um...
Fee:
What's going on? Is everyone still asleep?
colleague:
Um... I thought you were sick, Fee...
Fee:
Huh?!
Edel:
Hum.

Hachimaki:
Lenses set on optical detection, right?
Tanabe:

 No we're drifting again. Pitch up two degrees. Yaw right five degrees.
Hachimaki:
Once we attach those beacons, it's as good as ours.
Claire:

Toy box's left the station?!

I know, I know! Don't rush me, okay?!

Hachimaki:
No! You overshot it, damn it!
Lavie:

 What the...?!

Claire:
We just generated some secondary debris...
Phillipe:
Now, what do we do...?

Edel:

Those little twerps...!

woman in Control Section:
It's not working, huh?

 I suggest you wait till your captain's (at her xxxxxxxxxxxx) before you try for the Ghost again.

Speaking of that...

Try doing it the right way this time, okay?!

At this rate, it's just going to keep drifting farther [off / out of] the orbit...

Yuri:

Philippe:

Yuri:
But if we don't do something...!
Fee:
Yuri, get back in your seat!
Yuri:
Fee! Is that you?!
Claire:
Hey, I thought you were sick...!
Fee:

Yuri:
That's right! These old ships like Toy box are huge, aren't they?!
Fee:
Big enough to cover the ghost anyway.
Tanabe:
What are you doing?! If you do that, it's gonna shrink the Ghost?!
Fee:

Hachimaki:
Right! Can you do that, Tanabe?!
Tanabe:
Yeah...
Fee:
Lavie, put the arm out! You want as much shadow as you can get.
Lavie:
Yeah, I gotcha!
Fee:
Okay, now chief!
Philippe:
Yes!
Fee:
Don't do anything!
Philippe:
I copy!
Claire:
He's not even a real pilot! Do you really think he can handle this?!

Look, even if you work in the Control Section, you're still a part of the debris recovery team.
