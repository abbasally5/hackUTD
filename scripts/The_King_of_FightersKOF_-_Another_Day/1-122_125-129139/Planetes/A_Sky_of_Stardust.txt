  Abandoned artificial satellites. Tanks jettisoned from shuttles. Refuges generated during space station construction. This vast amount of junk floating in space:space debris, is a very serious threat to everything in orbit.
This is a story of 2075, a time in which this space debris has become a major problem.

Nothing really happened...

FEE:
Hmm...nothing, huh?

HACHI:
Oh, man, not these rations again...
That reminds me, Yuri. I was talking to Tomord about some stuff a while ago..
He says you're always in Records Section--

YURI:
Excuse me?

HACHI:
Um, forget it.
It's not really any big deal, okay?

YURI:
Oh, it isn't? I'm sorry about that.

HACHI:
I've noticed that you stare out the window and zone out sometimes.
Do you see something out there?

YURI:
Yes. I see space.

HACHI:
Huh? Just space?

YURI:
Yes. There really is nothing else.

HACHI:
The air conditioner?
Crap! It stopped again!
C'mon, show a little spirit, damn it!

YURI:
Mr. Hoshino!

HACHI:
Ow...son of a bitch! It stopped again!
Keep working, you bastard! Don't you get it?!
If you don't circulate the air, we suffocate! C'mon, you piece of junk! Work! Work, damn it!
Work!

EDEL:
Oh, good. Thank you.

MAN:
Sign here, please.

LAVIE:
You understand, this isn't good. Don't you?
You've gotta use up all your paid vacation days or the company could decide to take them away.

YURI:
I'm sorry, Lavie. I will try to use them soon.

LAVIE:
You say that, but you haven't taken a day off in the past five years!

YURI:
Oh...

HACHI:
Why don't you ever use any?
Come to think of it, you never go down to the Earth or even the moon.
The rest of us can take care of those animals you look after, so why don't you just go?

YURI:
Well, I...

HACHI:
Hm?
Is it that debris?

LAVIE:
He's right, you know. Use up your days. I don't care if it's on Earth or on Seven. I'm the one that General Affairs yells at, after all, and not you! You've gotta thank your bosses have it in for me as it is!

EDEL:
This came for you.

YURI:
Thank you.

LAVIE:
It makes trouble for me when we show up on their radar.
Yuri! Are you listening to me?!

YURI:
Ah...yes sir.

LAVIE:
It's a bad idea to use too many paid vacation days, but not using them at all is just as-- Carnations?

HACHI:
Is it Mother's Day?

YURI:
No, that isn't what these flowers are here for. I was thinking of putting them up in Toy Box.

HACHI:
Gosh, I wish a certain new employee who will stay unnamed would also be that thoughtful.
Hello?

TANABE:
Huh? I copy.

HACHI:
Huh?




HACHI:
What do you see in Tanabe?

CHENG-SHIN:
What?

HACHI:
Remember, you asked me to find out if she had a boyfriend?

CHENG-SHIN:
Did you ask her that she's available?

HACHI:
Yeah, but I can't say that I understand your taste in women.

CHENG-SHIN:
I don't know. I like how she's completely straightforward.

HACHI:
Even if there's a brick wall in front of her?

CHENG-SHIN:
I'm sure that girl has enough power to smash right through it.

HACHI:
That's what drives me crazy. She thinks that love can fix anything and everything.
It's embarrassing, you know. When you've lived for twenty years, you ought at least to know how to bend a little bit.
Huh?

CHENG-SHIN:
What's wrong?

HACHI:
Nothing. But, come to think of it, she's been acting kinda strange. She hasn't been herself.




TANABE:
I did it! I broke ten minutes!
I can really do it in under ten minutes now...

TANABE:
Mr. Gungulgash! Were you hurt in the fight?!

GIGALT:
No, I'm okay...
I wasn't hurt in the fight.

TANABE:
But...

GIGALT:
It's cancer.
It's already progressed way too far to be treatable.
So just keep this to yourself.
Don't tell Hachi.

YURI:
Who's in here?

TANABE:
Oh, hi, Yuri.

YURI:
Oh, it's you, Miss Tanabe.

TANABE:
Why are you here at this hour? It's pretty late, you know.

YURI:
I know, but I'd almost forgotten to put these up.

TANABE:
Oh, one of the carnations from this morning...

YURI:
What about you, Miss Tanabe? Are you down here practicing?

TANABE:
No, I'm down here hiding...





HACHI:
Damn it, I can't believe how late we are...
It ain't like [we're getting / to get] overtime for this.
I can't believe that twerp Tanabe!

FEE:
Hey, Hachi. Don't you think that maybe you're being a little bit rough on her?

HACHI:
We're debris haulers, aren't we? You know as well as I do that even a little lapse in focus can get people killed out there. As her sempai, I'm respon--

FEE:
If it were only that, I wouldn't be saying anything.

HACHI:
What?

FEE:
What're you so worked up about? Lashing out at everybody is pretty pathetic.

HACHI:
I'm just--

FEE:
Give some consideration to how she feels.
Tanabe's been sneaking aboard Toy Box late at night and secretly practicing.






TANABE:
Yuri, what's it feel like when you lose someone, someone important to you?
Someone you completely admire and look up to.
And that, if you were to suddenly lose that person... nobody can take his place. No one else will do.
Say that you're going to lose somebody like that... And that... you won't even be able to say goodbye.
And what if I wanna tell this other person about it.
But that person told me not to and I don't want to betray him, so I... I don't know what I ought to do.

YURI:
Carrying around secrets is a difficult thing, isn't it?
So, that's what's been bothering you.

TANABE:
Yes.

YURI:
When you lose someone you love, there's no sadness, and there's no grief.
You just don't feel anything. Nothing at all.
You really don't think about it.
It isn't good to think about it too much anyway.
And you eventually have to say goodbye to everybody, and you don't know if that time will come sooner or later.

TANABE:
Yeah, but...

YURI:.
If you don't think about that way, it hurts too much.




KEITH:
Keep her coming! That's right! All right! Hold it!
Hey, Toy Box is in Bay Four, right?

KEITH:
Yeah. You forget something?
What's this? He can't bother to give me an answer?

TANABE:
Thanks for all your help, Yuri.

YURI:
It is best not to overthink these things.

TANABE:
Yeah. I think I can deal with this.
Sempai?

YURI:
Mr. Hoshino?

HACHI:
Oh, so you were getting lessons from him now?

TANABE:
What?

YURI:
I came here to put up some flowers, that's all. And I bumped into Miss Tanabe.

HACHI:
It really doesn't matter. I don't have the temperament to teach people stuff, anyway.

YURI:
Wait! That's not true at all. You are a fine teacher, you know it. Much better than I am.

HACHI:
Oh, gosh, I guess you know all about me, then, don't you? But I don't know you at all, do I, Yuri? Even after working with you for three whole years. What's with all this cloak and dagger?

TANABE:
Sempai, we're not...

HACHI:
I heard something from that guy who works over in Records. And I was gonna talk to you about it today. He says you've been looking for something week in and week out. You could've asked me to help with that, you know?! I thought we were a team! I don't get it! Why the hell are you hiding stuff from me?
You don't have to sneak around, Yuri...

HACHI:
Morning.
EDEL:
Good morning, Mr. Hoshino.

HACHI:
So, Edel, how are you?

EDEL:
If you're looking for Tanabe, she's done the cleaning and left to fix the ship's air conditioner.

HACHI:
I don't really care.

EDEL:
Yuri is down in Records Section.

HACHI:
Did I ask where they were?

EDEL:
So, what is [it] you want?

HACHI:
Well, um... Where'd those flowers come from?

EDEL:
Yuri gave them to me. He said there was some clerical error and he got an extra shipment.

HACHI:
You sure that isn't an excuse? Maybe he planned on giving them to you all along.

EDEL:
No, I don't think so. In the language of flowers, white carnations convey the message "My love still endures."

HACHI:
You sure do know a lot, Edel.

EDEL:
Thank you.





MAN:
Who's that?

TOMORD:
Oh, He's from Half Section. You know, the guy who looks after all the animals.

MAN:
What's he doing, looking up the latest veterinary material?

TOMORD:
He says that he's looking through debris found by other companies.

MAN:
Hoe, for a guy in Half Section, he's a real go-getter.

TOMORD:
I don't think that's why he's doing it.



YURI:
A compass? Why would you go and buy one of those?

WIFE:
Leave me alone. It's my good-luck charm.

YURI:
Hey, I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

WIFE:
There's no up or down here, ...and they say that what astronauts really want more than anything else is the way to know their bearings. So that's why they keep things like this for good luck.

YURI:
Wait, you wrote something inside the lid. Can I see it?

WIFE:
Hey! No peeking!

YURI:
Why not?

WIFE:
Well, I think every marriage needs [to have] a secret or two. And Besides, it's a good-luck charm.

YURI:
Good luck, huh? Still, it's awfully unusual for someone to be scared of suborbital airliners.

WIFE:
Were you-- Where are you going?

YURI:
Scared to be by yourself? I'm getting some coffee, that's all.

WIFE:
Hey...!

YURI:
Come on, now. Don't look at me like that. I'll be right back, okay?




PHILIPPE:
You need to understand all the trouble I go to, Ai? It's hard to find suitable prospects for marriage meetings. I can certainly understand parents wanting to see their daughter married off while she's still in her twenties. They say that her younger sister got married and had kids a long time ago. But I don't know-- Calm down! Many men are their right age. Even single men, for that matter.
Last month, I got a an earful from Hachi for recommending a divorcee.
H-Hey! Behave yourself! It's tough! Yuri used to be married, so he is no good.

TANABE:
Huh? Did you just say that Yuri used to be married?

PHILIPPE:
You remember that terrible accident a few years ago where a small bit of debris hit that suborbital liner, right?

TANABE:
You mean the Alnair-8 accident?

PHILIPPE:
Right, right. Yuri told me he was on board that flight. He was traveling with his wife. The cabin was torn to pieces. Yuri was in the rear of the plane and survived, but his wife was never found.
Oh! I didn't find this out by snooping, either. The girl's family told me! They said that their daughter was all for it, ...but they mentioned that they would prefer a man who had never been married.

HACHI:
What the hell...? You didn't have to hide it from us.




MAN:
These are all of the personal effects that we've recovered so far. If your wife's belongings aren't here, then I'm afraid they haven't been found yet.

YURI:
A compass... Have you seen one here? A compass.

MAN:
Sir?

YURI:
Never mind.

TANABE:
Um... Sempai? We've got everything finished over here.

HACHI:
Oh. Yeah, that was quick.

FEE:
You guys need to get back inside. There's a cluster of micro debris on an intersecting orbit closing fast. Angle of intersection is 71.5 degrees. If you stay out there, the debris might hit you. Copy that?

HACHI:
I copy. Returning to base.

YURI:
We'll just have to come back again later.

HACHI:
Tanabe, we're doubling back.

TANABE:
I copy.

YURI:
What a pain. We'll have to start over.

TANABE:
Sempai?

HACHI:
Yeah?

TANABE:
The chief said that Yuri's wife was never recovered. Do you think that's true?

HACHI:
Yeah...

TANABE:
You don't suppose that the reason he keeps doing this job is to-- you know...

FEE:
Huh? Hey, Yuri, what're you doing? Get clear of there right now!

Yuri! Do you read me? Debris is heading your way!
Yuri?
Yuri!
Hachi! Go grab Yuri! He's breaking off!


TANABE:
Huh? Yuri?

HACHI:
Damn it, we don't have time to turn around!

FEE:
Yuri, What's wrong?! You're on an intersecting orbit! Fire your retros and lower your orbit! I'll send the data. Tell me when you get it!

Oh, no... You're out of time. Yuri!

HACHI:
Yuri!
Yuri's hit! We're going to assist! Give me his telemetry!

FEE:
Yeah, I copy. Module, heavy damage. Suit internal pressure... is still good! Life pack and batteries are still normal. Comm system, normal. Heart rate and respiration, unstable? He's unconscious?!

HACHI:
I'm not about to let him fall to Earth! Tanabe! You ready over there?!

TANABE:
I-I copy!

FEE:
Altitude, Two-five. Two-four. Two-three. He just at the atmospheric effects boundary!

HACHI:
Wait for us, Yuri... We're teammates, aren't we?

FEE:
Altitude, 120 kilometers...

TANABE:
He's falling into the atmosphere!

HACHI:
Wake up, Yuri!




YURI:
Someone is calling me...
It's warm... I forget, where am I?
where am I?
Hey, don't look at me like that. I'll be right back, okay.
Not this time.





HACHI:
Yuri!

TANABE:
Give me your hand! Hurry! Please hurry!

I have him, Sempai!

HACHI:
Way to go! Fee, guide us to a breakaway now!

FEE:
I copy!

TANABE:
Yuri! Are you all right?! Yuri, please talk to me!

HACHI:
We're losing speed! Angle, 5.5 degrees! Output at maximum!

FEE:
Hachi! I've got an ascent orbit for you! You need to--

HACHI:
Damn! Fee?

TANABE:
Sempai!

HACHI:
All right, enough for this! We'll just muscle our way back up, damn it!


REFLECTION:
Please save Yuri...


HACHI:
C'mon, you son of a bitch!

TANABE:
Hi, Sempai. Can you see him from there?

HACHI:
Yeah. We sure were in a cold sweat out there, huh?

TANABE:
If Fee hadn't grabbed us with the arm, we wouldn't have been doing much sweating, or anything else for that matter.

HACHI:
I always thought of Yuri as being kinda standoffish, you know. But now...

TANABE:
But now?

HACHI:
Yuri may be our teammate and all, ... but maybe there are some things he doesn't want us to know because we're his teammates.

TANABE:
Right.
But don't you think it's kinda sad, though? He can only lay out a single flower for his wife's burial.

HACHI:
I'd wanna leave a bouquet if I were him. But, considering our job... well.

FEE:
Over the years, Yuri has worked his butt off to bring in debris.
Well, I guess we can overlook one artificial flower.





YURI:
Mission accomplished. Returning to base.
