  Haruhi:
Really?
All the afternoon classes have been cancelled?

Girl:
You mean no one told you?

Girl:
It's going to be crazy around here for the next two days.
Ouran is hosting an exposition for the cultural clubs.

Girl:
Drama and choral clubs from a bunch of other schools have been invited.

Girl:
It's a big event this school hosts annually.

Haruhi:
Is that so?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
What?
You've never tried it?

Hikaru:
Didn't anyone tell you that it's the preferred drink of the host club?

Kaoru:
And you are our manager, so you should drink it too.

Renge:
Um well, I-I think I've heard of instant coffee before.
Oh, that's right.
Isn't that one coffee beans that have already been ground for you?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Bzzzt!

Hikaru:
That's just ground coffee.
Instant is something completely different.
I don't even think there're any coffee beans in instant coffee.
You just mix this powder with hot water and drink it.
You don't have to brew it.
It's pretty awesome.

Kaoru:
So, it's basically just like coffee, but not as robust.

Hikaru:
And yet it's strangely satisfying.

Kaoru:
Now that you mention it, we just ran out of it, didn't we?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Go buy us some more, Haruhi.

Haruhi:
Why do I have to go get it?

Hikaru:
Because you're the only commoner.
No one else knows where to buy it.

Kaoru:
We've even been serving it to our guests lately.
And besides, it's part of your job.

Haruhi:
But the cultural club exposition starts soon.

Hikaru:
Yeah, but it's not mandatory.
So if you're not interested, you don't have to go.

Kaoru:
And with that being said,

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Be careful out there.

Haruhi:
Damn them.
I really hate rich people.

Girl:
Thanks for helping them out, Haruhi.

Haruhi:
No problem.
I just wish they'd buy their own instant coffee.

Girl:
Well, I don't know if that'll ever happen but I'm glad they seem to be having a good time.

Girl:
And it's all thanks to you.

Haruhi:
All thanks to me?

Girl:
We've been in the same class with the twins ever since middle school.
They didn't used to be this cheerful and friendly.
They were always quiet and withdrawn.
They didn't have many friends.
It's like they didn't want anyone to get too close.
I don't think they liked school very much.
They seemed so bored by it.
I guess things started to change when the host club was created.
Since then, they've come out of their shells little by little.

Haruhi:
Really?

Girl:
But they really opened up since you've joined host club.
Now they talk and joke with everyone in class.
That's why we wanted to make sure you knew how grateful we are to you.
Because of you, the twins are having fun and enjoying each day to the fullest.

Benibara:
It would be a shame if any harm would come to that cute face of yours, young lady.


Haruhi:
"A Challenge From Lobelia Girls' Academy".


Suzuran:
This looks like the place.

Hinagiku:
Mm-hmm.

Host club members:
Welcome, ladies.

Tamaki:
Well, well, well.
I see you ladies are from another school.
I certainly hope we haven't startled you.
We love first-time guests.
I'm glad you've come, princesses.
My darlings, even if the world were to be destroyed, I'd put my life on the line as your faithful knight and servant.
I will protect you.

Suzuran:
Oh my, do you really think you'll be able to protect us?
That's awfully arrogant of you, wouldn't you agree?
You think that's what a woman wants to hear?
Well you're wrong.

Hinagiku:
Come on.
Give him a break, sister Suzuran.
Men are just lowly life forms who don't care about anything other than perpetuating their testosterone latent image.
By protecting us he's actually attempting to disguise the fact that he is weak and unable of even protecting himself.

Suzuran:
You're such a clever girl, Hinagiku.

Tamaki:
Don't you think that's a little harsh?
Fine then.
What do women like you want to hear?

Benibara:
Maybe, something like "I would never leave my lover alone."
If we fight, it'll be together.
If we fail, we fail together.
Even if I were to die, I promise you that I will never leave your side, my love.

Hingiku:
Benibara, we thought you'd never show.

Suzuran:
What are we going to do with you?
So tell us where you found this lovely young lady.

Benibara:
I just met her outside of the school.
She may be dressed as a boy, but I knew the truth.
She has such pretty maidenly eyes.

Haruhi:
Uh thanks, I guess.

Hinagiku:
Wow, her skin is incredibly soft.

Suzuran:
Isn't it, though?
I think this one's going to be a little diamond in the rock.

Tamaki:
Don't go touching my Haruhi without asking my permission.

Benibara:
Leave her alone.

Tamaki:
She punched me.
She's so violent.

Honey:
Get ahold of yourself.

Benibara:
Guess the rumors we heard are true.
You guys are just a bunch of weak little punks with no sense between you.

Kyoya:
Those uniforms.
I assume you ladies are from Lobelia girls' academy.

Benibara:
That's correct.

Benibara:
Lobelia!

Suzuran:
Lobelia!

Hinagiku:
Lobelia!

Benibara:
St. Lobelia academy, high school 2nd-year, Benio Amakusa.

Zuka club members:
Lobelia!

Suzuran:
2nd-year student, Chizuru Maihara.

Zuka club members:
Lobelia!

Hinagiku:
1st-year student, Hinako Tsuwabuki.

Zuka club members:
Lobelia!

Benibara:
We are the members of St. Lobelia academy's white lily league, also known as...

Zuka club members:
The Zuka club!

Tamaki:
The Zuka club?

Hikaru:
Oh man, what a stupid name.
The Zuka club.
My stomach hurts.

Kaoru:
The Zuka club.
That's priceless.
And they had those get-ups on under their uniforms.

Renge:
You shouldn't underestimate the Zuka club.

I may not know much about instant coffee, but I'm fascinated with girls' schools.

St. Lobelia academy, it is truly a woman's world there.
The Zuka club is a group of strong young maidens who consider women to be superior in every way.
The club prides itself on its 30 year history.
It's a society of maidens, by maidens, for maidens.
The Zuka club activities include maidens' tea parties, the maiden debate forum, and most importantly, musical reviews performed by the society's top members.

Kyoya:
You sure have a vast world of knowledge, Renge.

Renge:
Well, I've always admired St, Lobelias.
I just couldn't go to school there, though.
What would I do without any boys?

Suzuran:
A maiden's beauty.
It means possessing a spirit pure enough to not give in to power or to lust.

Hinagiku:
As a girl, you...
For a girl, you...
We've had quite enough of all your oppressive male contempt for woman kind.

Benibara:
And our pride... comes from having meaningful relationships based on equality.
Because with the same sex.
And yes, that includes relationships of love.

Suzuran:
Yeah, you tell them, Benio.

Hinagiku:
You're awesome, Benibara.

Kaoru:
Whatever.
We're so over it.

Hikaru:
Why don't you gals just scram?

Hinagiku:
I find it hard to believe that you silly boys have nothing to say about our sublime female love.

Hikaru:
What the hell is she talking about?

Kaoru:
Hey, I haven't seen this one before.
I guess it's a new one.

Suzuran:
You should feel sorry for them, Hinagiku.
Their patented host skills don't work on us.
Now they're all flustered and they don't know what to do with themselves.

Benibara:
True.
I must say I'm glad we decided to perform here.
It was fun to sneak a peek at the notorious Ouran host club.

Honey:
Hey guys, are we really notorious?

Mori:
Yeah.

Benibara:
And to think they're dragging this sweet young girl down with them.
The host club's president may be a pretty little halfer.
But he shouldn't be using his looks to create a fictitious romance.
Attempting to fool the heart of a pure young maiden is demeaning.
Your so-called club activities are nothing more than debasing macho fantasies.
I promise you.
We will bring you guys down.
The Ouran host club will be abolished.

Zuka club members:
All hail Zuka club.

Kyoya:
I see.
I understand your concern.
But do you think maybe we could finish this later?

Benibara:
Are you saying that you're not going to face us?

Kyoya:
Not at all.
It's just that our president is still bed-ridden from the initial culture shock.

Honey:
You see, Tama-chan is having his nappy time right now.

Benibara:
Wake him up!

Haruhi:
Excuse me, I made some coffee.
Would you ladies like to have some?

Benibara:
Why yes.
Aren't you the sweetest thing?

Suzuran:
You're a real pearl among swine.

Benibara:
You know, coffee made by a maiden always has a more fragrant aroma.

Haruhi:
But this stuff is just instant.

Hinagiku:
How about the four of us have a little tea party?

Tamaki:
You, girls have it all wrong!
Don't you see there's nothing to be gained in a romantic relationship between two women?
If that were the case, then why did God create Adam and Eve?
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot...

Haruhi:
You gotta be more careful, Senpai.

Tamaki:
Thanks, Haruhi.
Do you always carry bandages around with you?

Haruhi:
Nah, the supermarket was giving them out with the purchase of instant coffee.
You always get free stuff at the supermarket.

Tamaki:
Free stuff?

Banibara:
This little conversation doesn't seem to be going anywhere.
Now that we know what's going on, we can't allow this maiden to stay here.
We'll prepare her paperwork and have her transfer to Lobelia at once and welcome her into the Zuka club.

Haruhi:
Hey just wait a second, will you?
There seems to have been some misunderstandings here.
I mean, first of all, you called senpai a halfer.

Honey:
'Cause he is a halfer.
He's half French and half Japanese.

Haruhi:
Oh well. Uh anyway, I don't think it's fair for you to pick on the host club just because you don't think they have the same history as you do.

Hikaru:
We barely have any history.
We were just founded two years ago.

Kaoru:
Yeah, the boss created it whenever he started high school here.

Haruhi:
Be that as it may, saying their club activity is only held to satisfy their appetites is just wrong.
I mean, it's not like the host club's charging their guests or anything.

Kyoya:
Well, I wouldn't call it a charge.
We do have a point system.
We offer priority services based on the winning bids of auctions held on our website.
Check this out, Haruhi.
Your used mechanical pencil just sold with a winning bid of 30,000 yen.
Good for you.

Haruhi:
What!
But I thought I'd lost that pencil.
Why didn't you tell me about this before, Kyoya senpai?
I had no idea you were collecting money.

Kyoya:
So, you thought we were all just working here as volunteers?
While it's not much because of the expensive organizing events, we happen to make a small profit from the online auctions.

Haruhi:
You can't sell other people's thing without asking permission.
That's stealing!

Hikaru and Kaoru:
It wasn't stealing.
You dropped that pencil on the floor.

Tamaki:
Waah. I'm sorry, Haruhi.
It's not like we were hiding it from you.
Here, you can have mine.
It's got a cute teddy bear on it.

Haruhi:
Senpai, I don't want your pencil.

Tamaki:
Then to make it up to you, how about I do this?
I'll tell you the secrets to my success in my fondest memories.

Haruhi:
Not to be rude, senpai, but I'm not really interested in that information.

Tamaki:
Not interested?

Suzuran:
Oh, you poor dear.
I can't believe they've been deceiving you.

Hinagiku:
Hey, why don't you just dump these losers and come with us?

Benibara:
Hold on, Hinagiku.
This young maiden's had quite a day.
We'll give you some time to think about it.
We'll come back for your answer tomorrow.
Well then, adieu.

Haruhi:
I better be going.
I've got some thinking to do.

Tamaki:
Why did you have to tell her the truth?
You just added fuel to the fire.

Kyoya:
The facts are the facts.

Honey:
Maybe we should have asked before we sold her pencil on the internet.

Kaoru:
Yeah, for all we know, it was a keepsake from her mother.

Hikaru:
Nah, it was just a freebie they were giving out at an electronics store.

Tamaki:
Gentlemen, just think about it.
Haruhi may be basically indifferent, but if she had to choose, we know that she tends to favor men's clothing.
And besides, when she first joined the host club, didn't she tell us...

Haruhi:
Being a host and getting fussed over by a bunch of girls might not be that bad.

Tamaki:
Why didn't I realize this before?
Perhaps they would be a better match for Haruhi.
Maybe she'd be better off with the Zuka club.

Kaoru:
Yeah, she's perfect for a girls' school.

Honey:
Haru-chan is going to transfer away.

Hikaru:
What are we going to do?

Kaoru:
Haruhi is so smart.
Passing Lobelia's scholarship tests would be a piece of cake.

Kyoya:
And Lobelia academy has the money to pay off the 8 million yen debt she owes us.

Tamaki:
Calm down, gentlemen.
It'll be all right.
Listen to what I have to say.
I have a secret plan.


Zuka club members.
Lo- be- li- a.

Hinagiku:
I thought today's performance went extremely well.

Suzuran:
Our singing and acting skills are admired wherever we go.

Benibara:
That's true.
But the main event has yet to begin.
Right, girls?

Hi young maiden.

Hinagiku:
We've come for your decision.
Are you prepared to leave?

Suzuran:
We're ready to confront those Ouran host club idiots and set things straight once and for all.

Haruhi:
Set what straight?

Benibara:
That you should come with us and go to school with your own kind.

Kaoru or Hkaru:
Ouran!

Kaoru or Hkaru:
Ouran!

Mori:
Ouran!

Kyoya:
Ouran!

Honey:
Ouran!

Tamaki:
Ouran!

Host club members:
Host club welcomes you!

Tamaki:
Oh, Haruhi, welcome back.

Honey:
Look, Haru-chan.
I'm a princess now.
Are they cute?

Benibara:
What is the meaning of this?
Are you trying to make fun of woman kind?

Tamaki:
What?
No, that's not it at all.
Everything's going according to plan.
Our strategy is guaranteed to make even a crying child smile.
It's the freebie campaign.
My dears, you ladies have all lived sheltered lives at Lobelia, so you might not know, that commoners are weak.
They have a weakness for free things.
Haruhi, you may be distracted by the Zuka club.
But choose us.
And you gain not only a host club full of brothers but sisters as well.
See.
This way, you can experience feminine bonding while staying in the host club.
Isn't that a great idea?
Aren't I pretty?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
We're the Hitachiin sisters.
Which one of us is prettier?

Hikaru:
I'm just teasing you.

Koaru:
Ohohoho.

Honey:
Listen, Haru-chan
You can call me big sis from now on.

Benibara:
Why you...
Do you idiots really think you can win her over like this?
I've had enough of your fooling around.

Haruhi:
This is too much.
I don't even get what you're trying to do.
I knew you were a bunch of goofballs, but geez...

Hikaru, Kaoru and Honey:
Are we really that funny?
Call me big sister.
Come on, do it.
Just say it.
Big sister.
Say it please.

Haruhi:
Come on.
Cut it out.
What were you thinking?
What's gotten into you guys?

Hikaru:
We did this because we don't want you to leave the host club, Haruhi.

Benibara:
Well, maiden, have you made a choice?

Haruhi:
Yeah, I have.
I'm sorry but your club's not for me.
I think the idea of a girls' school is great.
And your views are very unique and interesting.
But I came to this school with a goal and a plan for my future.
So while I appreciate your offer, I really already knew that I was never going to leave Ouran academy.

Tamaki:
Haruhi.
Hold on.
If you knew you weren't going to leave, then why did you act so angry yesterday?

Haruhi:
How would you feel if I stole something of yours without asking you?
I really liked that mechanical pencil.
It was easy to write with.

Tamaki:
I'm sorry.
But I was nice and offered my teddy-bear pencil in return, and you said you didn't want it.

Haruhi:
That's right.
I still don't want it.

Suzuran:
Um Benio...

Benibara:
Yes, I know.
We're not going to give up on you, maiden.
I swear this to you.
Some day, we'll come and rescue you from this place.
And when we do, we'll abolish the Ouran host club.
Well, adieu.

Renge:
And so, a new rival, the Zuka club has appeared.
From this point on, the story's gonna get even more exciting.
What's gonna happen to our beloved host club boys next?
Hang in there, host club.
Don't give up, boys.

Tamaki:
Hey, it's not your job to cook things up.


Tamaki:
Is Haruhi really suffering in a life of poverty?
I have to go see for myself.

Haruhi:
You're just gonna cause trouble.
You don't need to come over.

Tamaki:
Whoa, you're Haruhi's father?

Haruhi:
Next time, "A Day in the Life of the Fujioka Family!".

Tamaki:
The Ouran host club will be waiting for you.

Host club members:
We'll see you then.
