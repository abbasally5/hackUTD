  Kaoru:
Hikaru.
Your phone.
Hikaru.

Hikaru:
Answer it for me, will you?

Kaoru:
No way.
Don't you recognize that ringtone?

Hikaru:
You've gotta be kidding me.
We're only three days into summer vacation.
Why can't he let us sleep in?

Kaoru:
He's probably been up since dawn.

Hikaru:
Yeah, what?

Tamaki:
She's gone!
My beloved daughter has vanished off the face of the earth!
She must've been kidnapped by a band of gypsies!
I just know it!
Contact the police!
We have to request an emergency deployment of the SDF.

Hikaru:
Wait, slow down.
You're not making any sense.
Now, what?
What do you mean Haruhi 's gone!?

Honey:
Huh?
So, Haru-chan is really missing?

Mori:
And her family is bankrupt?

Tamaki:
It's the only explanation!
I’ve been trying to get through to her home phone and her father’s work phone for the past several days and no one will answer!
They’ve been evicted and forced into indentured servitude!
We have to rescue them!

Honey:
Oh! Haru-chan!

Hikaru:
Boss please, not so loud.
Have you tried calling her cell phone yet?

Tamaki:
Cell phone?
Why on Earth would she have a cell phone!?
Of course.
She was issued one by a secret underground network of commoners known as the plebeian exchange.

Kyoya:
Not to interrupt your delusion, but Haruhi is currently in Karuizawa.

Tamaki:
Haruhi was turned out of her home, kidnapped by gypsies, and forced into servitude in Karuizawa?

Kyoya:
Moron.

Haruhi:
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
Hi, good morning!
Who would’ve thought working in a bed and breakfast could be the ideal way to spend my summer?


"The Refreshing Battle in Karuizawa!"


Hikaru:
So she's gone off and left us, huh?

Kaoru:
Looks like it.

Maids:
Good morning, masters.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Good morning.

Maids:
Your breakfast is waiting for you downstairs.

Kaoru:
All right, we'll be down in a minute.

Maids:
Very good, sirs.

Hikaru:
It's just no fun without her.
What are we going to do now?

Haruhi:
At first I was a little apprehensive about not telling the guys about my plans for the summer, but it isn't like they really have the free time to keep tabs on me anyway, right?
This place is so tranquil.
Fresh air, quiet setting.
The perfect highland to get a way for a girl to catch up on her studies.
It's gonna be great.

Tamaki:
Haruhi!
Despair not!
Daddy's come to save you!

Haruhi:
And by great, evidently I mean a nightmare.

Misuzu:
Oh my!
What dashing young men you are!
These hunks must belong to Haruhi!

Tamaki:
Another fluttering tranny.

Misuzu:
Why don't you call me Misuzu-chi?

Kyoya:
He's an old friend of Ranka's.
They used to work together at the same shop years ago.

Tamaki:
Well, naturally you would know.

Haruhi:
Kill me.

Misuzu:
I went into business for myself 2 years ago, and believe you me.
Running this adorable little pension is like living a fairy-tale.

Honey;
So then, is Haru-chan like your indenture servant?

Kyoya:
She's more like an unpaid employee.
This also happens to be Ranka's preferred method for keeping track of his daughter while he's busy working.

Tamaki:
What the..
How do you know all of this stuff?

Haruhi:
Kill me.

Misuzu:
'Take my little girl under your wing' he says!
He practically begged me,
And since I still can't afford the expensive hired help, it works out for everyone!
She's a model employee, really.
It’s such a shame I can't pay her anything.
Oh, tell me what you boys think of this cute little apron she is wearing.
I made it myself.

Tamaki:
You are an quite exquisite seamstress.

Kaoru:
A job, huh?
I don't get it.
You turned down our invitation to Bali for this?

Honey:
And we even asked her to go with us to Switzerland, didn't we?

Mori:
We did.

Haruhi:
Yeah well, I still don’t have a passport, remember?

Kyoya:
Which is precisely why I recommended one of our domestic resorts, and at a discount no less.

Tamaki:
Traitors.
Asking Haruhi to go on a summer vacation with you behind my back.
Have you no feeling of loyalty, of any solidarity?
Togetherness is our guiding principle.
I work myself to the bone upholding that and this is the thanks I get.

Hikaru:
Why was your cell phone...

Kaoru:
turned off?

Haruhi:
I just don't think about it, really.

Tamaki:
Did you say you have a cell phone?

Hikau:
We convinced her she should borrow one of ours, so we can keep in touch.

Kaoru:
It's a part of a special friends and family plan.

Hikaru:
Yeah, we're in each other's top five.

Tamaki:
Top five!?
Friends and family?
But wait, I'm your daddy and buddy, so I'm a part of the plan too, right?

Haruhi:
Sempai, whatever planet you're on, come home.
Speaking of which, why are you even here?
I'm gonna have to see you guys every day when the new term starts.
Don't I have the right to spend my summer vacation the way I want to?

Kyoya:
According to the hand book, jobs are prohibited.

Haruhi:
I, uh, had no idea.

Hikaru:
Hey did you hear?
Haruhi went and got herself a job without the school's permission.

Kaoru:
No way.
That's grounds for expulsion.

Honey:
I think Karuizawa is way better than Switzerland anyway.

Kyoya:
And oversea travel is so exhausting.

Tamaki:
Of course, you do have the right to spend your vacation as you please.
But then again, like it or not, so do we.
And you know, I for one find pension Misuzu to be exceptionally charming.

Haruhi:
Nooooo!

Haruhi:
Rise and shine, my sleepy-headed senpai.
Haruhi's made a special breakfast just for you.

Tamaki:
Oh, how lovely.
Come sit with me.
Stay a while.

Haruhi:
No, I can't.
I'm an employee here and you're one of our honored guests.
It's not allowed.

Tamaki:
But who's to find out if it's only the two of us?
Stay here with me, and silly rules will no longer matter.

Haruhi:
Senpai.

Haruhi:
Senpai?
Hello?

Misuzu:
I’m so sorry boys.
I'd love to have you all as guests, but I'm afraid there's only one vacant room left.

Tamaki:
Only one room, you say?
Well, that settles it.
I'll have to stay here to represent the club.

Honey:
Hey, that isn't fair.

Hikaru:
Have you no feeling of loyalty? Of any solidarity, boss?

Kaoru:
Togetherness is our guiding principle.

Tamaki:
My own words twisted…
And thrown right back at my face.

Hikaru:
Here’s an idea.
We bet you’ll like it.
Why not hold a little competition?

Kaoru:
Call it “The Guest Relations Odd Jobs Contest at Pension Misuzu”.

Hikaru:
It’s very simple.
We all just lend a hand around the place for the afternoon.

Kaoru:
And whoever makes the best impression on Misuzu-chi gets to sleep in the vacant guest bedroom.

Misuzu:
That’s brilliant!
I think it's an absolutely delightful idea!
Yes, the winner of the contest will be determind by how refreshing they are!
Remember, refreshing is the name of the game in guest relations!

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Refreshing, refreshing, yay!

Misuzu:
Now, don’t think this is going to be a walk in the park!
Because I'm planning on working you boys to the bone!

Haruhi:
Sounds like a blast.

Tamaki:
You may not believe this, but this is the first time I've held a hammer in my life.

Honey:
Just watching you work makes me feel tired.

Misuzu:
You there!
No complaining!
3 point deduction!

Tamaki:
The pain, the pain.

Misuzu:
No whining, either.
That'll be another 3.
You, think that's not gonna change my mind.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Welcome!

Guest:
We, we have reservations made for a second floor bedroom.

Hikaru:
Yes, of course.
Right this way, ladies.

Kaoru:
We've been expecting you!
Although we weren't expecting you to be so young and pretty.

Misuzu:
Fine, fine.
Not exactly settled.
But they do get a job done.
So 5 refresher points for them.
Oh, Mori, the legs on this table are wobbly.
Would you be a dear (and) fix it up back please?

Mori:
Sure thing.

Misuzu:
Nothing wasted in word or deed!
Five refresher points.

Haruhi:
So, what's a refresher point?

Misuzu:
Haruhi, what do you think guests are after when they come all the way out to vacation in Karuizawa?

Haruhi:
Let's see...
The nice weather?

Misuzu:
Oh, it's much more than that.
They come for what they can't get in the city.
Refreshing air, refreshing scenery, and refreshingly gorgeous young men!
And now thanks to your friends on a little contest, my pension will earn a reputation for being the premiere hot spot for vacationers such a finest eye candy Karuizawa can offer.

Haruhi:
Okay, sounds like you have a plan.
And it's uncanny how much you remind me of someone else I know.
Why is that I always end up feeling like I bring host club with me wherever I go?
Kyoya senpai, you're keeping your distance from all of this?

Kyoya:
Of course.
Winning means I end up staying here alone, which frankly doesn't appeal to me.
I'll just sit back and watch things unfold then head for the cottage.

Haruhi:
The cottage?
You mean, your family's?

Kyoya:
That's right.
We all have one in the area.

Haruhi:
Then, why make such a fuss about staying here?

Kyoya:
So, who's your favorite to win?
There must be someone you have in mind.
Do you care to bet?

Haruhi:
Um, no thanks.
I don't have a clue.

Kyoya:
Really?
It's easy enough to tell at a glance.
Honey-Senpai's brand of cute doesn't quite fit Misuzu's notion of refreshing.
So I'm afraid he is out.
Tamaki comes a little closer to the ideal, provided he keeps his mouth shut.
But we both know the likelihood of that.
Ordinarily you'd figure Hikaru and Kaoru.
Then again, seems we have a dark horse.

Guest:
Oh my!

Guest
Gorgeous!

Misuzu:
That's 20 more refresher points to Mori!

Haruhi:
So then, you think he is the one?

Kyoya:
Except that if Honey-senpai drops out, Mori-senpai is bound to go along with him.
His compeiting in the game [after/at] all is more or less conditional to that.

Hikaru:
Which means,

Kaoru:
Victory will be ours.

Haruhi:
Well maybe not.
I couldn't help but notice that the only room still available is a single bed.
So if you did win, you couldn't both stay.

Hikaru:
No big deal.
We can just bring another bed over from the cottage.

Kaoru:
Yeah, we can even squeeze into the single.

Haruhi:
How sweet.
I guess you guys really are always together, huh?

Kaoru:
Always.

Hikaru:
The two of us have been together since we were born.
So we haven't ever needed anybody else.

Kaoru:
We never bother making other friends until a few years ago.
We thought the world was made up of idiots.

Haruhi:
Oh really?

Hikaru:
But then...
Well, that was before we knew you.
We totally let you sleep with us.

Haruhi:
Ah thanks, I'll pass.

Kyoya:
The contest isn't quite decided yet.
There's still a number of ways to make this game more interesting.

Haruhi:
This guy's always got something up his sleeve.
Does that qualify as refreshing?

Kaoru:
Oh yeah?
Thinking about helping the boss, are you?

Hikaru:
We're not going to loose.
It's no use.


Tamaki:
There.
All in a day's work.

Misuzu:
Oh, your repairs are totally unrefreshing.
Three point deduction.

Haruhi:
He used up so much of his energy trying to be refreshing that his work suffer for it.
Is he all right in the head?

Kyoya:
He's never had an actual job before, you know.

Kaoru:
Hey, cut it out!
That's cold!

Hikaru:
We have to chill the watermelon.
That's how our guests like it.

Guests:
Oh, so refreshing!

Tamaki:
I'll lose to those two idiots if this keeps up.
Failure is not an option.
Haruhi's respect for me is on the line.
She has to understand that I'm worthy of being considered part of her top five!

Kyoya:
Grandiose ambitions aside, I think your approach to winning is a bit skewed.

Tamaki:
Kyoya, can't you see that her esteem for me as a father figure hangs in the balance?

Kyoya:
If I may offer some of advice, there is something that only you can pull off.
That is, if you choose the right music.

Woman:
Oh, let's stop in for some tea.

Man:
All right.

Kaoru:
So much for us.

Haruhi:
Kaoru, you're here alone?
Where's Hikaru?

Kaoru:
He went to get some trash bags for us.

Haruhi:
Oh.
Do you still think you'll win?

Kaoru:
I don't know.
Kyoya senpai's created a monster.
The boss didn't even know this place had a piano before he pointed it out to him.
Look out!

Guest:
I'm so sorry!
Are you two all right!?

Kaoru:
Don't worry.
We're okay.
Right?

Haruhi:
Uh, yeah.
Thanks.
I'm fine.

Hikaru:
Kaoru!
You're hurt.
Let me see!

Kaoru:
I'm fine.
It's only a little cut.
Hikaru?

Hikaru:
Don't scare me like that.

Kaoru:
Hey, I'm sorry.
Do you forgive me?

Misuzu:
Bravo! Bravo!
100 points for refreshing brotherly love!
A perfect score!
And the victory goes to the Hitachiin brothers!

Tamaki:
So begins the long, dark night of my soul.

Haruhi:
Congrats, you guys.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Oh, it was nothing really.

Haruhi:
What the?
Hang on a second.
Was all of that staged?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Well now, who could say?

Kaoru:
I'm okay.
I promise.
You should be happy that we won without having to resort to quarreling brother strategy, right?

Hikaru:
Mm-hmm.

Hikaru:
Come on.
I said I was sorry.
What do you want me to do?
I didn't mean to kick you out of bed.
It was an accident.

Kaoru:
Accident or not, my back is killing me.

Hikaru:
Get us some breakfast, please.
I'll have two pieces of [baked/Beget] toast with clarified butter and garnet seal syrup.

Kaoru:
I'll take poached eggs with bacon and a bowl of whole grained cereal.
The kind with those little pieces of dried fruit in it.

Haruhi
Hold on.
We don't even have that stuff on the menu.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Huh?

Tamaki:
Behave!
Just who in the world do you think you are?
Acting like members of some privileged aristocracy on holiday!

Hikaru:
We are aristocracy.

Kaoru:
So are you, boss.

Tamaki:
You are missing the whole point of travel.
‘When in Rome do as the Romans do.’
That’s what I say.
Take a look at this.
Karuizawa cuisine fit for a king.
Cold pasteurized Jersey steaks, fresh juice, highland vegetables, smoked salmon cooked over cherrywood, the local pride, I might add.
And last but not least, freshly baked breads with homemade jam.
Bon appetit.

Hikaru:
Since when have you...

Kaoru:
been such a connoisseur?

Haruhi:
Oh, since he started learning from Misuzu.
He's been in the kitchen with him all morning long.

Misuzu:
We arrange them like so.

Tamaki:
Mm-hmm, brilliant.
While the two of you were sleeping the day away, I decided to start a refreshing host workshop.
I even wrote a manual.

Haruhi:
You really need a life.

Tamaki:
While you are acting as my apprentice, you may not treat me as your senpai.
That is the first rule I have written.

Haruhi:
Really?

Hikaru:
Hey wait.
Have you got rule number 5 yet?
It says we have to be up by 6 a.m.

Kaoru:
Have Kyoya senpai and Honey senpai read through the manual yet?

Hikaru:
Hey, look.
We're sorry, boss.

Kaoru:
We didn't mean to stir up painful memories.

Arai:
Good morning, Arai Produce!

Misuzu:
Good morning to you!
Working boy ay?
A high schooler?

Arai:
Yes, ma'am.
I’m helping out my uncle shop for the Summer

Misuzu:
How refreshing!
Haruhi, would you put these in the refrigerator for me?

Haruhi:
Okay.

Arai:
Haruhi Fujioka?

Haruhi:
Hey, Arai?


Tamaki:
What do you mean you two are going on a data?

Haruhi:
Where would you like to go first, Hikaru?

Tamaki:
Oh, kissing is forbidden!
And no sharing ice cream!

Haruhi:
Next time, "Operation Haruhi and Hikaru’s First Date!"

Tamaki:
The ouran host club will be waiting for you.

Host club members:
We'll see you then.
