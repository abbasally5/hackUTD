  Ranka:
Haruhi?
Are you sure you don't want any breakfast?

Haruhi:
No thanks.
Well I'm off then.

Kyoya:
Welcome, Miss.

Eclair:
I know you.
You're the Otori family's son, aren't you?
Unfortunately, you're the third son.
So, you can never be the family successor.

Kyoya:
What can I do for you today, Mademoiselle?

Eclair:
You can tell me how much Haruhi Fujioka's still in debt for the host club.

Kyoya:
Haruhi, someone to see you.

Haruhi:
How are you today?

Eclair:
I couldn't help to notice my Tamaki seemed to have a soft spot for you.

Haruhi:
Just what are you getting at?
Are you saying you're jealous of me?

Eclair:
Oh, listen to you.
Tamaki won't be coming today.
I warned him that I would be upset if he ever showed his face at the host club again.

Honey:
I wonder what happened to Tama-chan.

Hikaru:
I'm getting worried.
Something's up with him after what he said yesterday.

Tamaki:
As of today, Lady Eclair Tonnerre and I are officially engaged.
Furthermore, the host club will be permanently dissolved after the Ouran Fair.

Kyoya:
All right gentlemen, no more idle chatter.
Our guests are waiting for us.

Kaoru:
Senpai, it's like you don't even care.

Kyoya:
It's our job to take care of our guests to the best of our abilities.
Remember, they're looking to all of us to entertain them.
Their happiness is the utmost importance.

Honey:
He's right, Kao-chan!

Kaoru:
Honey senpai, what are you doing?!

Mori:
Come on, Hikaru.

Hikaru:
Let go, Mori senpai.

Kyoya:
Thank you for all of your hard work, Haruhi.
After that request from Lady Eclair, your debt has been paid.
You finally repaid us for that Renaissance vase you broke.
So you are free to quit the Host Club, if you want.


"This is Our Ouran Fair!"


Kyoya's father:
When they're young, many assume they have all the time in the world, really.
That is never the case
Don't waste your time with something that will ultimately have no value.

Haruhi:
You don't know anything about the Host Club.
Kyoya senpai works around the clock to make sure that everyone here is enjoying themselves.
And did you ever stop to think that entertaining others might give each of us some fulfillment?
How can you possibly say that what we do here is just a waste of our time?
I don't care what you say.
I think Kyoya senpai is amazing.

Kyoya's father:
I see.
So that must be the honor student Kyoya told me about.

Tamaki's father:
I'm concerned about outstanding of Grand Tonnerre.
They recently even buy [up] Japanese companies right and left.

Tamaki's grandmother:
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
Once we have an heir, the Suou family will prosper once again.
After all, it's not like the boy can turn against us.

Tamaki's father:
But Tamaki has never been interested in anything involved in the family.
What have you done to change his mind?

Tamaki's grandmother:
I told him that if he asks Lady Eclair to marry him, I would allow him to see his mother.

Tamaki's father:
But you can't be serious.

Tamaki's grandmother
Your child is having to make amends for the indiscretions of your youth, my dear son.

Eclair:
Tamaki won't be coming today.
I warned him that I would be upset if he ever showed his face at the host club again.
Tell me.
Are you Tamaki's lover?

Haruhi:
No, Miss.
Not at all.

Eclair:
I see.
That's good to hear.
And I guess you must mean nothing to him.

Haruhi:
While I may not be his lover, I know that I'm not nothing to him.

Eclair:
I think it's best you'd not have any contact with your friends for a while.
It'll make hard for you to leave.
Come in.

Man:
There is a visitor here to see you, ma'am.

Eclair:
Please have them come in.

Tamaki:
Mr. Otori, why are you here?

Kyoya's father:
I should be asking you the same question.

Eclair:
Don't you worry about him.

Tamaki:
Sir, it's a pleasure to see you again.
It's my fault that Kyoya joined the host club.
I'm really sorry.
But sir, I don't understand.
What are you doing here?

Man:
We're terribly sorry we had asked you to come all this way.
I hope the trip hasn't burdened to you.

Kyoya's father:
No, on the contrary, I'm always quite happy to avoid the press.
For what I understand, my medical equipment company is about to be bought out from under me by Grand Tonnerre.
And you know, it probably serves Kyoya right.
The company I was considering handing over to him will forever be out of his hands now.

Eclair:
Excuse me sir, but there's one more thing.
I have a favor to ask you.

Haruhi:
Kyoya senpai, what's with this outfit?

Hikaru:
We told you, it's a costume for the special parade.

Honey:
You look so cute, Haru-chan!

Haruhi:
I don't understand.
Why am I the only person dressed as a girl?

Hikaru:
Oh come on.
It's cosplay.
So, it's okay for you to dress like a girl.

Haruhi:
I am one, you know.

Kaoru:
Well?

Kyoya:
No luck.
He's not there.

Haruhi:
I can't believe senpai didn't show.
I really thought he was gonna make it despite what she said.

Kyoya:
Hello Shima? Been a while, hasn't it?
It's Kyoya.

Shima:
This is about Master Tamaki, isn't it?
I'm sorry, Kyoya, but the Master will be departing for France soon.
I tried to talk about it to do, but he said the Suou family had forgiven his beloved mother, and that he was finally granted to get to see her again.
He also said that if he stayed at Ouran any longer, his capriciousness would only continue to make trouble for you and everyone else in the club.

Kyoya:
How could he be so stupid?
Evidently, Tamaki is planning to return to France.

Host club members:
Huh?

Honey:
Tama-chan is going to leave us?!

Hikaru:
You're kidding me!
They can't just end it so suddenly!

Kaoru:
Hikaru...

Shima:
Excuse me, sir.

Kyoya:
Yes?

Shima:
I was just thinking, if the Master's mother really is as remarkable woman as he claimed she is, then I can only imagine she would be upset with the manner in which the master has chosen to leave Ouran acadamy.

Kyoya:
Do you know when he's leaving, Shima?

Shima:
I'm afraid his flight is this evening.

Kyoya:
Why is he leaving so soon?

Shima:
He would've left sooner, but he said he had to wait until the Ouran Fair was ending.

Kyoya:
Tamaki!

Honey:
Tama-chan!

Kaoru:
No way!

Hikaru:
The Ouran Fair isn't even over yet!

Kyoya:
My family's car should be in the parking lot!
Haruhi, let's go!


Kyoya:
We're in a hurry.
Can you drive us?

Man:
I'm sorry sir, but...

Kyoya:
What is it?
What's wrong?

Man:
Well you see, the thing is...

Kyoya:
Do you want to tell me your orders?
Let me guess.
You've been hired to protect lady Eclair.

Man:
I'm truly sorry it has come to this, but as you know, as members of the Otori Private Police, we answer to your Father.

Kyoya:
Damn it!

Man:
I'm terribly sorry sir, but we've been ordered not to allow any of you to leave, even if we have to stop you by force.

Mori:
Hikaru, take the carriage.
If you use the back hills bypass, you can cut them off.

Man:
It's Haninozuka.

Man:
And Morinozuka.

Hikaru:
Come on!

Kyoya:
Haruhi, go get that idiot.
Hurry!
Now go!
This is your chance!

Man:
Don't get stand there!
Stop that carriage!

Honey:
Takashi, don't go easy on them!

Mori:
Don't worry, I won't!

Honey:
I want you guys, picking on my friends is big no-no!

Kyoya:
You should never underestimate the Ouran Host Club.

Mori:
Yeah.

Kyoya:
Hikaru, Kaoru, Haruhi, please bring him back.

Kaoru:
Hikaru!
Don't you think we should slow down!?
Somebody could get hurt!

Hikaru:
We're not slowing down until we get the boss back!

Kaoru:
But Hikaru!

Hikaru:
If it wasn't for Tamaki, then the two of us would still only be lost souls!
We were able to become friends of Haruhi and the others because the host club brought us together!
To think it would all end suddenly like this, is something that I can't tolerate.

Kaoru:
No Hikaru!
Hikaru, Hikaru!
Hikaru, are you okay?
Is your arm hurting you?

Hikaru:
This can't be the end, boss.
It's just not fair.
The host club is the only thing that made us happy.
Damn it.

Kaoru:
Hikaru...

Haruhi:
Well I'm off then.

Ranka:
What?
You can't talk to your dad about it?
What's the matter, Haruhi?

Haruhi:
What do you mean?
I'm just not that hungry this morning, that's all.

Ranka:
You can't fool me, kiddo.
The last time you skipped breakfast was after your mother's funeral, and it was a while before you could eat again.

Haruhi in childhood:
So, I won't get to see mommy any more?

Ranka:
There are many things in this world you cannot ever change, no matter how desperate you try.
Just remember, Haruhi.
You have to stay brave even if it seems like your world is crumbling around you sometimes.

Hikaru:
What is she doing?

Eclair:
What's the matter, Tamaki?
You haven't said a word since we left.
You're a host, aren't you?
Come on.
Entertain me.

Tamaki:
I have a question.
Are you sure about this?
[Are/Will] you [really/even be] happy to marry to me, or are you just following orders?

Tamaki:
Haruhi!

Eclair:
That's Haruhi Fujioka?

Tamaki:
What are you doing, Haruhi?!
This is dangerous!
Stop the carriage, now!

Haruhi:
Senpai!
Please come back to Ouran!

Tamaki:
I mean it!
Stop the carriage!

Haruhi:
All of us have completely lost without you, senpai!

Tamaki:
But they... they also said they were put out by the host club.

Haruhi:
You really are an idiot!
What's wrong with you!?
After all this time we've been together, you still can't tell if we're joking or we're serious!?
Everyone loves being in the host club!
We really do!
Even me, senpai.
I love being in the part of the host club, too!

Tamaki:
Haruhi!

Tamaki:
Haruhi!

Haruhi:
Senpai!

Tamaki:
That was reckless, Haruhi.
You have to be more careful.
Look, you're here soaking wet.

Haruhi:
A little water never hurt anyone.
Besides, people are always telling me that I'm dripping with good looks.

Honey:
Tama-chan!
Haru-chan!

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Hey boss!

Kyoya:
Oh man, he's such a moron.

Eclair:
Let's go ahead.

Man:
Miss Eclair, you've heard the stories that housekeeper tells back home, haven't you?
The one who's always talking about her son who loved to play the piano for her.

Eclair:
Is he really as sweet as you say he is?

Tamaki:
Thanks, Eclair.

Eclair:
I was going to give him the opportunity to see his mother again.
He's such a fool.
But even so, even for someone like me, he still smiled.

Kyoya's father:
I'm sorry that we've caused you concern.
It looks as though Grand Tonnerre will not be purchasing my company after all.
An unexpected banker turned up.
They bought the company before Tonnerre had a chance.
And the banker said he would turn in all the management rights over to me.

Tamaki's father:
That was a bold move.
Which funds manager was it?

Kyoya's father:
A student investor called K.O.
He cleverly left his name out of the deal, but it didn't take me long to figure it out who it was.
K.O. is Kyoya Otori.
The new banker was none other than my own son.

Tamaki's father:
At least, we know we don't have to worry about the future.
I thought I knew how brilliant Kyoya was but it seems he's even smarter than I thought.

Kyoya's father:
Maybe so, but I think your son is the one who's truely amazing.
I am responsible for the entirety for Kyoya's education.
I always knew he would surpass his older brother(s) some day.
However, I must say I'm shocked.
While I can imagine Kyoya taking over a company, I never dreamed he would turn around and give it right back to its original owner.
As Kyoya grew up, I was constantly dangling the Otori family company in front of his face, torturing him with something he could not have.
Now, not only has he taken it out from under me by force but he's basically told me he doesn't want it and thrown it back in my face.
Do you understand what that means?
It means he's finally found it.
He's found something that has even greater value to him, and that's probably thanks to Tamaki.

Tamaki's father:
Though our company sometimes caused us to compete, I think we'll get along just fine from now on.

Kyoya's father:
Agreed.
I think we can get along famously, just like our two sons do.
I almost forget.
There was one thing I wanted to run by you.
That honor student girl.
Haruhi Fujioka was it?
I think she would make a wonderful bride for my Kyoya in the future.
I just wanted you to know my intentions.

Tamaki's father:
Well, unfortunately, it looks like we're not going together along after all.
I'm sorry, but that's the one thing I could never allow, my friend.

Tamaki:
Only those with excellent social standing and those from filthy rich families are lucky enough to spend their time here at the elite private school, Ouran academy.
The Ouran host club is where the school's handsomest boys with too much time on their hands entertain young ladies who also have way too much time on their hands.
Think of it as Ouran academy's elegant playground for the the superrich and beautiful.

Haruhi:
Remember, you're welcome to visit us in music room 3 whenever you would like to.

Host club members:
The ouran host club will be waiting for you.

Haruhi:
And we want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

Host club members:
We'll see you then.
