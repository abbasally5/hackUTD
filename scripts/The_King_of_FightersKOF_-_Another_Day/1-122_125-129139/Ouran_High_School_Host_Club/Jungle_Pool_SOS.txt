  Haruhi:
Wait a minute.
Am I dreaming?
We're in Japan, right?
And Japan is not really known for its tropical locals.

Tamaki:
Behold, Haruhi.
Bask in the beauty of tropical birds.
Aren't they breathtaking?
I wonder what they're called.

Haruhi:
Um, where was the exit, again?

Tamaki:
Try to make the most of this down time and just relax.
We're so worried about keeping our good looks day and night.
We deserve a little vacation.

Haruhi:
Personally I think this is pointless and a waste of time, so can I go home now?
I should really be studying and I've got ton of laundry to do today.
Senpai, where are we, anyway?

Kaoru:
Target.

Hikaru:
Captured.

Haruhi:
Wait.
What the...

Tamaki:
Good work, now take her with you.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Roger!

Haruhi:
Hold on.
Where are we going?

Kyoya:
This place is a brand new theme park that my family, the Otori group runs.
It's called the Tropical Aqua Garden.

Haruhi:
I don't understand.
I thought the Otori group ran hospitals and that they're focused on the medical business, Kyoya senpai.

Kyoya:
Yes, but my family likes to diversify and try different things.
Besides this place could be classified as a healing facility.
It's therapeutic.
Think of all the people who are overworked and would just love a vacation in the south tropics.
However, they may not be able to get the time off or they may not be able to afford it.
Those people can now seek refuge here at this theme park and reduce their stress levels.
The Otori group's primary concern has always been for the good health and well-being of the general public.

Haruhi:
It sounds suspicious to me.

Kyoya:
The park doesn't officially open until next month, but the host club was given a special advance invitation.

Tamaki:
This is so relaxing.
We don't have to worry about keeping all of our guests entertained for once.
It's truly like a holiday for handsome young soldiers.
I guess that's what you call it.


Haruhi:
"Jungle Pool SOS"


Honey:
Haru-chan.
Wanna share some coconut juice with me?
Or do you want to try a piece of mango cake?

Haruhi:
Yeah, sure, I'll have some coconut juice with you.

Kaoru:
Haruhi, you wanna go check out the water slide?

Hikaru:
Hang on, what's the deal with that pullover you're wearing?

Haruhi:
Oh, this thing?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Here, do what you got to do.

Maid:
Okay, we'll do what we can.

Maid:
Miss Fujioka, just follow me.

Haruhi:
But why?
Hold on!
What are you doing?
Hey, stop that.

Maid:
We've been asked to help you choose a swimsuit.

Hikaru:
We brought all of our mother's latest designs for you to choose from.
Just pick whichever one you want.

Maids:
Are you ready, Miss Fujioka?
It's time to pick one.

Haruhi:
Thanks, but I don't need a swimsuit.

Maid:
Why don't you let me select one for you?

Haruhi:
No, not that one.
I don't want a bikini.

Maid:
But you'd look so good in this one.

Haruhi:
No, wait.

Maid:
I bet this one would be cute.

Haruhi:
But that's nothing more than a couple of strings.

Haruhi
Senpai?

Tamaki:
Just hurry up and put it on.
A proper young woman should not show that much skin until after she's married.

Hikaru:
So, you're not going to swim?

Kaoru:
Hold on, you do swim, don't you?

Haruhi:
I can swim just as good as the next guy, but this isn't my idea of fun.
I'm not that big on water parks.
We're just gonna spend all day goofing off.
Honestly I'd rather be at home.
I don't understand what's great about this place, anyway?
I mean all you really need to play in the water is a plastic pool.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
A plastic pool?
What's that?

Haruhi:
Let's see...
I guess they're about this big, round, and to use it, you have to pump it full of air.

Hikaru:
You dunce.

Kaoru:
That's an inflatable boat, dummy.

Hikaru:
There's no way something that small could be used as a pool.

Kaoru:
Yeah.

Haruhi:
Guys, it's a small pool.
Haven't you ever seen little kids playing in one?

Tamaki:
You idiots!
If Haruhi thinks it's a pool, then it's a pool.
Got it?
Don't go embarrassing her.
She can't help it if she's an ignorant commoner.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
So, are we supposed to lie to her?
Is that what you want?

Haruhi:
I can't help but feel like I should be offended by that comment.

Hikaru:
Never mind that, we've got a question for you.

Kaoru:
Why did you make Haruhi put on that yellow monstrosity?

Tamaki:
Gulp.

Hikaru:
I would've thought for sure that you would be all...

Tamaki:
I wanna see Haruhi in a swimsuit!

Hikaru:
Not making her cover up like that.

Kaoru:
It was surprising.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
I know what he's up to.
He made Haruhi cover up because he didn't want anyone else to see her in a bathing suit.
Do you really think that's it?
He must be one of those jealous pervert types.
That's pretty twisted.

Tamaki:
That's not it at all.
I was just trying to protect her innocence as any father or guardian would.
After all even if she's wearing a swimsuit, it is not decent for a lady to walk around half naked in front of boys.

Honey:
Haru-chan.
Let's play!
You wanna go swimming in the current pool with me?

Haruhi:
Nah, I'm not gonna swim today.
Hold on, you know how to swim.
Do you still need that float?

Honey:
Mm-mm.
Just looks cuter this way, you know?
Prancing, prancing.

Haruhi:
You're right.
Those bunnies are pretty cute.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
He's so innocent.

Renge;
No way!
You got it all wrong.

Haruhi:
Is that Renge?

How did she do that?
It's like that rig follows us.

Hikaru:
That outfit is pretty impressive.

Kaoru:
What's with the tattoo on your stomach?

Renge:
Oh, that?
You don't recognize it?
I'm cosplaying.

Hikaru:
Yeah, who?

Renge:
La-La.

Kaoru:
La-La?
Like the manga magazine?

Renge:
Her petite and slender frame.
Her blue eyes that light up young men's faces.
Her singing voice.
La.
I am Quon Kisaragi.

Haruhi:
I wouldn't have guessed.

Tamaki:
I had no idea who you're supposed to be.

Hikaru:
Hey, boss, are you sure it's okay for Renge to be dressed...

Kaoru:
...like that?

Tamaki:
Well, yeah that's okay.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
And why is that?

Tamaki:
Because it's cosplay, I guess.

Renge:
Listen up, boys!
Obviously you need help understanding Haninozuka's hidden motives.
Look!

Honey:
Takashi!

Tamaki:
What are you talking about?

Renge:
Think about what he said to you earlier.

Honey:
Just looks cuter this way, you know?

Renge:
He's not being as sweet and innocent as you think.

Kyoya:
I agree.
Try putting a word, "I" at the beginning of that sentence.

Honey:
Just looks cuter this way, you know?
I look cute.

Tamaki, Haruhi, Hikaru and Kaoru:
He planned that!?

Renge:
That's Haninozuka for you.
In the last episode, he felt threatened by another loli boy type, so he's taking steps to keep his rank.
I should give him more credit.
He's a lot smarter than I thought.

Honey:
Hey, look at this, everybody!
Check it out!
Look!
Even though we're swimming really fast, we never go any further than we are now.

Tamaki:
So, what's up with him?

Haruhi:
Could he really be that smart?

Hikaru:
I gotcha.

Kaoru:
Come on, boss.
Let's go.
Let's have a water gun fight.

Hikaru:
It'll be me and Kaoru against you.
If you get it in the face, you lose.
What do you say?

Tamaki:
Forget it.
Why would I want to subject myself to a childish game like that?

Hikaru:
Haruhi, I think it's time that we got married.

Kaoru:
Then we'll honeymoon in Atami.

Tamaki:
Do you really think I'd ever let Haruhi marry you guys?
Daddy says no!

Haruhi:
Taking a break, huh?
You want something to drink?

Mori:
Yeah, thanks.

Tamaki:
I'll get you guys!
Sideways-leaping shot, go!!
That's cheating!

Haruhi:
Honey senpai!

Mori:
Mitsukuni!

Haruhi:
Mori senpai?

Tamaki:
Gentlemen, we're going after Honey senpai!
That pool looks like the quickest way!
Charge!

Kyoya:
Wait!
I wouldn't go...

Host club members:
There are alligators in there!

Tamaki:
Okay, so we can't choose that pool!
Then let's try this way next!

Hikaru and Kaoru:
They're here, too!

Haruhi:
And here!

Haruhi
What's with all the alligators?

Tamaki:
Beats me.

Kyoya:
Those alligators belong to the park's tropical animals exhibit.
I guess it is kind of dangerous to let them run wild.
Though, the cause of our present situation seems to be the location of the switch for the current pool.
I'll have to have a little chat with our designers.
Thanks a lot, you guys.
I got some great data today.

Host club members:
You what!?

Kyoya:
This is a map of the Tropical Aqua Garden.
This is our current location.
We need to get here.
I have a feeling that's where Honey senpai probably ended up.
It might be tough because to get there, we'll have to make it through this jungle area, here in the southern block.
Distance wise we're talking about 800 meters.

Haruhi:
Looks like there are a lot of undeveloped areas.
Any idea what might be lurking in those parts of the jungle?

Kyoya:
Since they're still being developed, I'm afraid I don't know.

Hikaru:
Whatever's out there could be even more dangerous...

Koaru:
...than alligators.

Tamaki:
All right!
Now, this is a mission of survival!
I know we can make it through the treacherous jungle in one piece.
It is our sworn duty to save Honey senpai!


Tamaki:
Wow, this place is just like a real jungle, huh?

Haruhi:
Yeah, and I keep hearing all these really strange animal calls.

Hikaru:
You don't think that all those animal sounds...

Kaoru:
...could belong to the real thing, do you?

Kyoya:
To be honest, I'm not sure.
But I do know that my family always strives for authenticity whatever the cost.

Haruhi:
Mori senpai is always so straight-faced.
I can never tell what he's thinking.
But even though he's doing a good job of staying calm, I'm sure he's worried.

Hikaru:
Mori senpai is...

Kaoru:
...acting as clumsy as you do, boss.

Tamaki:
Shut up!

Haruhi:
Just as I thought.
He is worried.

Kyoya:
Uh oh, it's about time for the squall.

Hikaru:
Hey Mori senpai, you seem to be really close to Honey senpai.
Are the two of you like childhood friends?

Hikaru:
You mean you don't know...

Kaoru:
...that they're cousins?

Haruhi:
You're kidding me.
They're related?

Kyoya:
The Morinozukas have been serving the Haninozuka family for generations.

Hikaru:
However, two generations ago, the families became relatives by marriage and the master-servant relationship soon became a thing of the past.

Kaoru:
But even so, Mori senpai has always made a point to accompany Honey senpai.

Tamaki:
Must really get his blood going.
The blood of a loyal servant flows like a mighty river through Mori senpai's vein.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Such a beautiful story!
I'm touched!

Haruhi:
I don't know if I call it a beautiful story.
I'm not sure I understand all this blood and loyalty business.
But it's obvious that Mori senpai thinks an awful lot of Honey senpai.
Hey Mori senpai, it's gonna be all right.
I'm sure that Honey senpai is safe.
He's a lot tougher than you might think he is, and if he gets hungry, the trees are full of bananas.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Bananas?

Tamaki:
What's he going to say?

Mori:
You're right.

Tamaki:
Don't tell me Mori senpai is after my spot as Haruhi's daddy!

Hikaru:
Nobody wants that spot but you boss.

Kaoru:
That's kinda creepy, when you think about it.

Tamaki:
What?
Who're you calling creepy?

Kyoya:
Hello, it's me.
Well, we've had an incident that's caused some trouble.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
You're a big-o pervert.

Tamaki:
Shut up!
I'm not a perv.

Haruhi:
Mori senpai, you're going the wrong way.
Honey senpai was headed in the opposite direction.

Mori:
You're wrong.
He went this way.

Haruhi:
Hey, wait up!
It's too dangerous to go alone!
I'm coming with you!

Mori:
Haruhi.

Haruhi:
That's the first time he's ever called me by my name.

Kyoya:
Yes, at once, please.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Senpai's a perv for Haruhi.
Senpai's a perv for Haruhi.

Kyoya:
My family's private police force is going to send in a search and rescue team to help us.
They're better equipped to find Honey senpai than we are.
So let's just go back to the gate and wait there.
Hey, where are Mori and Haruhi?

Police force:
Immediate emergency mobilization order.
I'll repeat.
Immediate emergency mobilization order.
Master Kyoya's friend has gone missing near the wave pool.
Our search target is a small young man.
Orders are to eliminate any suspicious figures.
Show them no mercy.
Repeat.
Eliminate any suspicious figures.
Show them no mercy.

Police force:
Target confirmed.

Police force:
The target has been captured by a suspicious man.
We'll take the target into custody.

Kyoya:
You know, I don't believe I mentioned to them that there're other visitors here.
Oh, well.

Police force:
You there!
Put the boy down immediately!
If you refuse, we'll remove him forcefully!

Haruhi:
Oh, hold on!

Police force:
The suspect is resisting!
Prepare to fire warning shots!

Honey:
Takashi, Haru-chan, out of the way!

Police force:
Hey, what do you think you're doing, pipsqueak?

Honey:
You guys should be more careful who you mess with.
Picking on my friends is bad.
Got it?

Tamaki:
Haruhi!
Haruhi, are you all right!?

Honey:
Hey, it's Tama-chan.

Hikaru:
Oh, wow.

Kaoru:
You okay, senpai?

Tamaki:
Haruhi!
I was so worried.

Hikaru:
I'm not sure what happened here, but at least they're still alive.

Kaoru:
It's pretty amazing that this is Honey senpai's work.
He must have really been holding back.

Haruhi:
Huh?
What do you mean he was holding back?

Kaoru:
So then...

Hikaru:
You don't know about senpai?
The Haninozukas are famous for their martial arts.
Not only have they helped train the police and SDF forces but they've also worked with several overseas militaries.

Kyoya:
Honey senpai in particular has been called the dreadnought of the Haninozuka family.
By the time he was in middle school, he'd become the national champion in both karate and judo.

Tamaki:
Mori senpai's no slouch either.
He won the national championship in kendo when he was just in middle school.

Kaoru:
So, how are you able to find this, Honey senpai?

Honey:
It wasn't hard.
It didn't take me long to reach the end of the current pool, so I decided to look for you guys.

Police force:
We humbly apologize!
I am a 2nd-generation student of the Ishizuka Dojo!

Police force:
I am a student of the Todoroki Dojo!

Police force:
And I'm from the Otake Dojo!
We are in your debt!

Honey:
Why?
Is something wrong?

Police force:
Yes, sir!
We're so sorry, sir!
We were unaware that we were searching for Mitsukuni Hanozuka.
We've committed a terrible offense here.
I apologize for this confrontation.
But my Dojo will be so excited to hear that I've come face to face with the great Haninozuka.
I cherish this moment.

Haruhi:
So he is smart.
He's deeper than I could ever imagine.

Honey:
Takashi, you did an amazing job of protecting Haru-chan.
I bet you were pretty lonely without me around, huh?

Mori:
I don't know if I'd say that.

Hiakru:
You know, maybe we should go to the beach next.

Kaoru:
Yeah, the beach would be nice.

Tamaki:
You idiots, Haruhi is not interested in anything like that.

Haruhi:
Actually, I might like to go to the beach.
I may not be into this silly water park, but I like the ocean.
It would be nice to go to the beach.
And it's so pretty.

Tamaki:
Yeah.
All right.
Then that's where we'll go next time.

Honey:
We're all gonna go to the beach, Tama-chan?
That'll be fun, don't you think?

Mori:
Yeah.


Tamaki:
We come to the beach like she wanted and all of a sudden, Haruhi and I get into a big fight.

Haruhi:
I thought you weren't gonna talk to me anymore, senpai.

Tamaki:
Haruhi.

Haruhi:
Next time, "The Sun, the Sea, and the Host Club!"

Tamaki:
The Ouran host club will be waiting for you.

Host club members:
We'll see you then.
