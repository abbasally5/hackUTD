  Kaoru:
And those go in the central building's main salon, okay?

Man:
All right.

Kaoru:
Hey, be careful with that.

Haruhi:
Uh, aren't school fairs meant to be, I don't know, more about students proudly showcasing unique things they made by hand?

Kyoya:
Perhaps for a mere average school, yes.
But, at Ouran, the emphasis is on planning and leadership skills.
Keep in mind.
Most of our students are being groomed in the position of leadership, so they're required to showcase talent for proper mobility not arts and crafts.

Haruhi:
Oh...

Hikaru:
Whoa, whoa!

Mori:
Nicely done.
You handle the reigns like a pro.

Honey:
Haru-chan!

Tamaki:
Climb on board!
We're rehearsing for the big Ouran Fair parade!

Girl:
Oh wow, it's right out of a fairy tale!

Girls:
How romantic!

Girl:
Can we have a ride, too?

Kaoru:
Hey, you know, you've gotten pretty good at this.

Hikaru:
There's nothing to it.
You should have practiced with me earlier.

Kaoru:
Well, just because we're twins doesn't make both of us good drivers.

Honey:
It's kind of neat having us all together like this for a carriage ride, huh?

Haruhi:
Yeah, whatever...

Tamaki:
Oh and for the actual parade tomorrow, we'll all be in 18th century french costumes.
Your outfit will be especially opulent, Haruhi.

Haruhi:
Oh, wonderful...

Tamaki:
Ah, the Fair's Opening Ceremony has started.
Let's make this Fair the best one yet!

Haruhi:
Sounds good to me.


"The Host Club Declares Dissolution!"


Tamaki:
Now remember, as part of the Fair, the Host Club will be opened to parents and visitors for the next two days, which means we will need to be even more charming than usual.
Let's get out there and show our own guests the time of their lives!

Girl:
Isn't is just wonderful, mother?
This is the host club [I'm/I've been] telling you so much about.
What do you think?

Mother:
Well, actually I cannot say I approve of this.
I think that these young men just enjoy being fond over.

Tamaki:
You're quite right, madam.
We're such shameless selfish creatures.
All of this is mere pretense for spending time with lovely young ladies such as yourself.
It is our weakness.
Forgive me.

Mother:
Oh, what enchanting!

Girl:
I told you!

Tamaki:
You're too kind, both of you.

Haruhi:
Good grief.

Mori:
Here, your button is mismatched.
Allow me.

Honey:
Thank you very much.

Woman:
How adorable!

Woman:
They must be brothers.
The old one is so thoughtful.

Haruhi
Wrong!

Hikaru:
But, you see, our mother and father, both were so busy that they had no time for the two of us.

Kaoru:
We played by ourselves, which is the reason we're so lonely now.

Women:
Oh, you poor things.

Haruhi:
You have gotta be kidding me.

Kyoya:
One of our daily goals here at the host club is to evoke different time periods, so we make it a point to thoroughly research a wide variety of historical traditions in the interest of maintaining all intensity.

Man:
That's quite impressive.

Haruhi:
Yeah, quite impressively political...
This is a bit too much even by our standards.
You could buy a small country with all the money we're wasting.

Tamaki:
What nonsense!
That's not the Host Club way at all and you know it.
Happiness is above any price tag.
Besides, think of all the exposure...

Kyoya:
No, Haruhi is right.
You have overshot the budget.

Tamaki:
Kyoya...

Kyoya:
The use of the salon notwithstanding, you had a period style carriage shipped all the way from France.
Must you always be so capricious?
Your impulsiveness overwhelms my accounting skills.

Haruhi:
Typical.

Tamaki:
Whatever!
Capriciousness is just another for creative!
I have you know the whims of the host club king are the step of the dreams.
No price is too high!

Haruhi:
Welcome.
Can I get anything for you, maybe, something sweet?

Eclair:
You are the host club?

Haruhi:
Yes.

Tamaki:
Father!

Tamaki's father:
Do not refer to me as Father.
The term is far too familiar.
You will address me properly as Chairman.

Kyoya:
Ah, very good welcome, sir.
Please let me show you to your seat.

Tamaki's father:
Thank you.
Kyoya my boy, if not for your being here, I'm sure this club would be a shambles.
My son must give you no end of trouble.

Kyoya:
Oh, on the contrary, sir.
Your son's ambition is what keeps us viable.
May I bring you anything?
Yes, yes, of course.
Haruhi, you're needed.

Tamaki:
What?!

Haruhi:
Oh.

Tamaki's father:
So, you're Haruhi Fujioka.
Come, sit with me.

Haruhi:
All right.
Thank you, sir.
So, this guy is Tamaki senpai's father?
Fine.
They don't look all that much alike.
Nice to meet you, Chairman
I was just thinking earlier that I ought to pay my respects to you a long time ago.
I'm so sorry.

Tamaki's father:
You know, Chairman is so dry.
Why don't you call me... yes..
Call me your Uncle.
It would please me.

Haruhi:
Wow, I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree after all.

Tamaki's father:
I find that I'm just so busy lately that I'm seldom here in person, but I've certainly heard some wonderful things about you.

Haruhi:
Oh why, thank you sir.

Tamaki's father:
Ah, if ever you find yourself in trouble, I want you to know that you can come to your Uncle for anything.

Haurhi:
Hey...

Tamaki:
Father!

Tamaki's father:
That's Chairman!

Tamaki:
What do you think you're doing?!
Remove your hands at once, please!

Haruhi:
Kyoya senpai?!

Kyoya's father:
Is this how my son has been wasting his time?

Honey:
That's Kyo-chan's father, is it?

Mori:
Yes.

Kyoya's father:
You're an embarrassment to the Otori name.
Suou, my friend, I'm sorry you had to witness that.

Tamaki's father:
That did seem rather harsh, given how exceptional he really is.
For a man with three fine young sons to carry on his legacy, your avarice would seem to run deep.
I've heard about your trouble.
Believe me, it's only a matter of time before the media gets wind of it.
Please tell me you're not taking it out on your son.

Tamaki:
Kyoya, are you all right?

Hikaru:
Your dad is so mean!

Honey:
You should never ever hit someone who's wearing glasses.

Kaoru:
I don't think it's really about that.

Haruhi:
Senpai, he wasn't upset with you because of the Host Club, was he?

Kyoya:
Don't worry about it.
It's not like I haven't been expecting this.

Tamaki:
Because of the Host Club?

Tamaki's father:
Whims have consequences, Tamaki.
Take my word for it.
They do not come cheaply for people like us.
Accept it.
Life is hard.
It's time for you to grow up and realize that dreaming only postpones the inevitable.

Girl:
Haruhi!

Haruhi:
Coming!
Thank you all so much for taking time out of your busy schedule to visit us today.

Tamaki's father:
Start thinking about the future, son.
If you plan on becoming head of the Suoh family, there's a long hard road ahead of you.
You're going to have to live with the choices you make for the rest of your life.
I advise you to think very carefully about what it is you really want, before it's too late.
Now look sharp.
Your grandmother is here

Tamaki:
Grandmother!
I'm so glad you could come!

Haruhi:
Oh, that's so sweet.
So, that's Tamaki senpai's grandmother?

Honey:
I hate that woman.

Tamaki:
Please come in.
Take a seat.

Tamaki's grandmother:
Don't patronize me.
Filthy child.
Lady Eclair, come over here for a moment, please.

Haruhi:
Hey, I was just...

Hikaru and Kaoru:
What?

Tamaki's grandmother:
For the remainder of the day and tomorrow, you will be Lady Eclair's personal escourt.
What's wrong?
I gave you an order.

Eclair:
Hello there, Tamaki.

Tamaki:
Very well, Grandmother.
I will do everything in my power to ensure her happiness just as you wish.


Honey:
Tama-chan isn't coming back, is he?

Hikaru:
So, does he really plan to spend

Kaoru:
The entire fair escorting some stranger?

Tamaki:
Come, my princess.
Let us be off.

Hikaru:
Eclair, right?
Or something like that.

Kaoru:
Who is she to him?
That's the mystery.

Renge:
I can tell you.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Oh, Renge.

Renge:
Eclair Tonnerre, she's the youngest daughter of the renown French Tonnerre family.
They descend from royalty.

Kyoya:
Indeed.
The family has quite a history.
Their wealth is something of a legend among financial heavyweights.
In fact, just being associated with them makes you part of a very elite group.
They also own Grand Tonnerre, a firm that's been buying up a lot of businesses in Japan lately.
Of course, that doesn't explain why Lady Eclair has come here to visit Tamaki.

Tamaki:
Isn't this charming?
A picturesque gondola ride and artists' showcase all in one and everything you see here was created by members of the Ouran art club.

Eclair:
How pedestrian.
Clearly, the work of nerveses.

Tamaki:
That was a bit harsh.
What would you have me do?
The students put a lot of hard work into these pieces.
But you can go somewhere else if you like, my lady.

Eclair:
Tamaki, I would like you to play the piano.
For me.

Kyoya:
Of course, that doesn't explain why Lady Eclair has come here to visit Tamaki.

Eclair:
In here?

Tamaki:
Oh, it is a music room, after all.

Eclair:
So, this is the room where you and that precious little host club if you hold called, isn't it?
I must admit it was impressive seeing your all action earlier.
You must be very close.

Tamaki:
Naturally.
You know what they say that family put place to gather days together.

Eclair:
Family.
What a sentimental notion.
I believe here in Japan, they referred it as playing house.
You are so whimsical, Tamaki.
I bet that they fall of themselves trying to keep up with you.
Especially, that one with the glasses, the one that got slapped by his father.

Kyoya:
Must you always be so capricious?
Your impulsiveness overwhelms my accounting skills.

Tamaki:
Could that be true?
Is everyone making sacrifices just to keep me happy?
Haruhi could be much closer becoming a layer right now if I hadn't forced her to be part of this club.
She came here to study.
But I've completely monopolized all her free time.

Eclair:
Who is it?

Tamaki:
Oh, Haruhi?
What are you doing?

Haruhi:
I just came back to change outfits.
You were the one who wanted us to change costumes at least three times a day.
Look, everyone is upset with you for disappearing on us like that.
You should be with your club.

Eclair:
My apologies.
I'm afraid he belongs to me for the time being.
Forgive me for asking, but do I detect him to jealousy?

Tamaki:
Oh, Haruhi!
So, is it true?
Is it true?
You're actually jealous?

Haruhi:
Sorry, but no.
I guess I'll be leaving now.
Some of us have work to do.

Tamaki:
Hey, wait a second.
Haruhi!

Eclair:
Please, you can't possibly be interested in a shrew like that.

Tamaki:
My lady!
I would appreciate it if you would not refer to my little girl as a shrew.

Eclair:
Your little girl...
They're not real family, Tamaki.
So stop playing house.

Tamaki:
What are you doing?!

Eclair:
Wouldn't you prefer the real thing?
Because I can give it to you, you know.

Girl:
How dashing!

Girl:
Oh my!

Honey:
Haru-chan looks great!

Mori:
She does.

Hikaru:
Not bad.
So, where did the Boss go?

Kaoru:
He was looking forward to this the most.

Haruhi:
Our king is lounging in Music Room 3.
He's entertaining Lady Eclair.

Hikaru:
Well well well.

Kaoru:
Sounds like someone is a little jealous.

Haruhi:
Like I said, I'm not.

Honey, Mori, Hikaru and Kaoru:
Like you said?

Haruhi:
Look.
I- I just think that he's being even more irresponsible than usual today.
You said it yourself, Kyoya senpai.
He's impulsive.

Kyoya:
True.
He certainly is.
But in this instant, he's obeying the whim of his grandmother.

Tamaki:
Please come in.
Take a seat.

Tamaki's grandmother:
Don't patronize me.
Filthy child.

Haruhi:
Um, you know, now that I think about it, Tamaki senpai's grandmother seemed a little cold toward him earlier.
Is there some special reason for that?

Hikaru:
Well, everyone else knows about it.

Kaoru:
See.
Tamaki senpai is an illegitimate.

Hikaru:
20 summer years ago, the Suoh family patriarch died at a young age.
For political reasons, Chairman Yuzuru was rushed into a marriage at the behest of his mother to a woman of her choosing.
That's how he became head of the family.
But several years later, the Chairman fell passionately in love with a beautiful young woman he met in Paris.

Honey:
Not long after, Tama-chan was born.

Tamaki's father:
No, mother, I'm leaving my wife.
I'm going to marry her.

Kaoru:
The boss's grandmother vehemently objected.
Because of poor health, living in Japan proved too difficult for senpai's mother and so she raised him in France until he was 14.
His childhood seems to have been a happy one.
But as time wore on, the family business on his mother's side went belly up, and when they were forced into debt,

Hikaru:
The boss's grandmother worried about there being no heir to carry on the family name came up with a proposal.

Tamaki's grandmother:
I will provide you with a means to live comfortably for the rest of your days.
In exchange, Tamaki is to come [to/and] live with me in Japan, without you.
All contact between the two of you will be prohibited for ever.
These conditions are non-negotiable.

Haruhi:
Wow...

Kyoya:
The current patriarch may be chairman Yuzuru Suou technically, but for the time being, all of the family's assets remain under the control of Tamaki's grandmother.
What's more, with his mother's health being so frail, Tamaki understood the grim prospect facing her she would have to live in debt.
So...

Tamaki:
I decided.
I'm going to go to Japan.
It's all for the best.
Just promise me, Mom.
Promise me you'll take care.

Kyoya:
Not long afterward, either out of anguish or just plain guilt of handing over her son away for financial security, Tamaki's mother left France in shame and went into hiding.
Her current whereabouts are unknown.
To this day, he's never seen her again, not once.

Haruhi in childhood:
So, I won't get to see mommy any more?

Haruhi:
I had no idea.
He always seems so cheerful.
Who would have ever guessed?
If I were in senpai's shoes, I don't know that I could forgive my grandmother for something like that.

Kyoya:
It's easy to feel sorry for him, but the hardships he endured as a child helped mold him into the person he is today.
He'll be fine.
The host club is his refuge, which means when it's all said and done, he still has us.

Honey:
Tama-chan!

Tamaki:
Everyone, I have an important announcement.
As of today, Lady Eclair Tonnerre and I are officially engaged.
Furthermore, the host club will be permanently dissolved after the Ouran Fair.
That is all.


Haruhi:
To be honest, I used to think you were just the strangest bunch of misfits and loonies I'd ever met.
I mean, serving as hosts in an after school club?
Nest time, the final episode "This is Our Ouran Fair!"
All of you, I...
