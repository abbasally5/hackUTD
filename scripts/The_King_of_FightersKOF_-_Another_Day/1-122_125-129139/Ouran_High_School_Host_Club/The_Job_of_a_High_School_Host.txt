  Haruhi:
I'm never gonna hear the end of it if I show up late.
What's this?
Where am I?

Host members:
Welcome.

Haruhi:
When I opened the door, the whole place was decked out like a tropical paradise.
Can you see this from Heaven, mom?
This is the club I was forced to join.

"The Job of a High School Host."

Hikaru and Kaoru:
You finally made it, Haruhi.
You're so late.

Haruhi:
I could be wrong, but my calendar says it's still early spring.

Tamaki:
Huddling under a kotatsu table, fearing the cold is nonsense.
And besides the heating system we have is the best.

Kyoya:
Do you have a problem with the way we run our club, Haruhi?
Be careful what you say.
You owe us 8 million yen, remember?

Tamaki:
Gentlemen don't bundle up in bulky clothing.
It may be a chilly early spring out there in the real world, but here at the club we want to surprise our chilly little kittens with a warm tropical paradise.
Oh yes. We've turned this place into nirvana, a balmy tropical island of everlasting summer.

Haruhi:
That's funny 'cause I feel a massive chill right now.

Tamaki:
Only those with excellent social standing and those from filthy rich families are lucky enough to spend their time here at the elite private school, Ouran academy.
The Ouran host club is where the school's handsomest boys with too much time on their hands entertain young ladies who also have way too much time on their hands.
Just think of it as Ouran academy's elegant playground for the super-rich and beautiful.

What heartlessness.
Even with my lustrous skin shining like brilliant ivory, exposed by my Balinese king outfit, I'm no more than a slave before my goddess.
I kneel before you and swear my loyalty.

Girl:
Tamaki.

Girl:
Tamaki.

Girl:
Oh wow.

Tamaki:
Oh yes.
I almost forgot to mention to you, ladies.
Next week, the Ouran host club is sponsoring a party.

Haruhi:
We're throwing a party?

Girl:
What kind of party is it going to be?
Is it going to be formal?

Hikaru:
Yes, in fact we've rented the school's largest hall.

Kaoru:
It's a perfect place for dancing.

Hikaru:
But I really wanted to spend some alone time with you, Kaoru.

Kaoru:
Don't be upset, Hikaru.
I know exactly how you feel.

Haruhi:
The guests seem to be even more worked up than they usually are.

Kyoya:
Showing some skin proves popular with the ladies.

Haruhi:
So are you the one who came up with this tropical paradise idea?

Kyoya:
I have no decision-making authority.
All the club's policies have been laid out by the club's king, Tamaki.
But I guess there's no harm in admitting to casually slipping a Bali photo book onto his desk.

Haruhi:
So he's the real brains behind the operation.

Honey:
Ta-da.

Girls:
Oh, you're so cute, Honey.

Honey:
Hi ladies, I love these Balinese flowers.
We had them flown in.
Takashi.
There.
We match.

Girl:
You're covered in camellias.

Haruhi:
I'm still thoroughly confused by the two of them.

Girl:
Um Haruhi?
Aren't you going to wear a tropical outfit like the other boys?

Girl:
I'd like to see that.

Haruhi:
Oh well, no, I...
I just don't think it's appropriate to wear anything but early spring attire in early spring, you know?

Tamaki:
But we have one ready for you, Haruhi.
I think you'll like it.
You and I are a pair.

Haruhi:
No thanks.

Girl:
Wow Haruhi, you're really faithful to the different seasons, aren't you?

Girl:
I think that's great.
I hope we're lucky enough that the cherry blossoms are in full bloom on the night of the party.

Girl:
The two of us dancing among the cherry blossoms.
It's so dreamy.

Haruhi:
You really think so?
You know, ladies.
I think it's so cute when you dream like that.

Kanako:
Excuse me.
I hate to disturb, but I think it's time for the hosts to switch clients.

Haruhi:
Oh, I'm sorry.
You must be my next appointment, Miss...

Kanako:
My name is Kanako, Kanako Kasugazaki.
You're even cuter than I expected.
I've decided.
From now on, you're going to be my new favorite host, Haruhi.

Tamaki:
I can't take this any more.

Hikaru:
Hey boss, why don't you stop eating that commoner's ramen and come over here to help us with the party planning?

Kaoru:
Does it really bother you that princess Kasuga has taken a liking to Haruhi?

Kyoya:
He shouldn't be surprised.
She's had the illness for a while now, hasn't she?

Haruhi:
What illness?

Hikaru:
She's got the host hopping disease.

Kaoru:
AKA never-the-same-boy-twice disease.

Kyoya:
Usually, our customers choose a favorite host and see them regularly.
However, princess Kanako tends to change her favorites on a regular basis.

Honey:
That's right.
'Cause before she chose you, she was with Tama-chan.

Haruhi:
Oh, so he's upset because I took her from him?

Tamaki:
Shut up!
I couldn't care less.
I'm running out of patience.
Haruhi, it's time you started dressing like a girl.
I don't understand how you could be so popular with the ladies, when you yourself are a lady.
No one in the entire school knows the truth except for those of us here.

Hikaru:
Yeah, she opted out of taking gym classes.

Kaoru:
And the attendance numbers are all mixed together so no one can tell.

Tamaki:
That's enough, Haruhi.
Now you listen to Daddy.
Daddy wants you to go back to the way you were.

Haruhi:
Don't go blowing up my photos without asking me first.

Hikaru:
The more I look at this picture, the more amazed I am.
How could this possibly become that?

Haruhi:
The day before school started, one of the kids in my neighborhood got some gum in my hair.
It's a real pain to get gum out of long hair.
So I decided to cut it all off.
I didn't care if I look like a dude, you know.

Tamaki:
Girls should never refer to themselves as a dude.
Momma, Haruhi's using those dirty boy words again.

Kaoru:
I'm sorry, but who is momma?

Kyoya:
Based on club position, I assume it's me.

Haruhi:
Look, I don't see what you're crying about.
Working as a host, I can pay back more of my debt.
It'll never happen if I'm just an errand boy.

Hikaru:
Hate to change the subject, but do you have formal dancing experience?
You'll need it at the party.

Haruhi:
Uh... no.
But the party doesn't have anything to do with my quota, right?
I'm not interested in going to events, so if I could be excused...

Tamaki:
Definitely not.
A refined gentleman must know how to dance.
If you want to live the life of a host that badly, you're going to have to show us how far you're willing to go, Haruhi.
I order you to master dancing the waltz in one week and you will demonstrate it for us at the party.
Or I'll tell the entire school that you're a girl and knock you back down to an errand boy.


Kanako:
Quick, quick, slow. Quick, quick, slow.
Good work, Haruhi.
Now on the "slow", you should bring your feet together.
Remember.
The gentleman always leads.
And make sure to look at the lady you're dancing with.

Haruhi:
Got it.
I'm so sorry, Miss Kasugazaki.

Kanako:
It's okay, Haruhi.

Haruhi:
Ah, can I help you up? Let's try it again.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Why so gloomy, boss?

Hikaru:
I bet it's because he wanted to be the one Haruhi practices with.

Kaoru:
I think you may be right.
But he's way too tall to stand in as a woman.

Haruhi:
Thank you so much for allowing me to practice with you.
I really appreciate it.

Kanako:
Oh, no problem.
I heard that you're not seeing any customers today so that you can practice dancing.
I'm glad I got to spend this time alone with you.
Oh, my!
This is a new tea set, isn't it?
It's Ginori.

Haruhi:
Ginori?

Kyoya:
You have a keen eye, mademoiselle.
In fact, we just received them yesterday.
We decided that it was about time for the club to upgrade its tea sets.

Kanako:
I see.
What a pretty color.
Lovely.

Haruhi:
You must really be into tableware, huh?

Kanako:
Not really, I mean no, of course, I'm not.
Whatever would give you that idea?

Haruhi:
She obviously knows a lot about it.
Why would she lie?

Suzushima:
Hello? I'm here with the new tea cups you ordered.

Kyoya:
Ah, thank you very much.
Every item that you've chosen for us has been extremely popular with the ladies.
I'm quite impressed.

Suzushima:
Well, that's good to hear.

Haruhi:
So, do you sell tea sets?

Suzushima:
No, I'm just a regular student.
Can't you tell by the uniform?

Kanako:
Oh Haruhi, you're so funny.
I can't blame you for not knowing.
After all, he doesn't really look like an heir to a first-class company.

Haruhi:
First-class company?

Kyoya:
His family's business, the Suzushima trading company, deals primarily in the importing of tableware.
They currently have the top market share in the country.

Haruhi:
Wow!

Kyoya:
So whenever something exceptional comes in, we've asked him to send it our way.
He has a great eye for fine china.
Dont' you, Suzushima?

Suzushima:
You think?
I've still got a lot to learn, but thank you.

Kyoya:
Aren't you leaving next month to study abroad in England?

Suzushima:
Yes, I am.
Well, I better go now.

Tamaki:
So, are you enjoying the host club?

Haruhi:
I get the feeling you and that guy are kinda close.

Kanako:
Don't be ridiculous.
We hardly know each other.
What makes you say that, Haruhi?
Now, if you'll please excuse me.
Take care.

Honey:
Haru-chan!
Guess what?
They do know each other.
Suzushima is Kasuga-chan's fiance.

Tamaki:
Kyoya, how long have you known about this?

Kyoya:
About the two of them being engaged?
Well, as you know, I conduct general researches on all of our customers.
The two of them were childhood friends.
It seems their engagement was arranged by their parents.
I didn't think the information would benefit us.
So I disregarded it.

Tamaki:
I see.

Kyoya:
Toru Suzushima.
Outstanding grades, fair social status.
He's ordinary looking.
But he's reliable.
If I had to fault him for anything...

Hikaru:
He doesn't have much presence.

Kaoru:
And he's faint-hearted.

Kyoya:
So, in other words, he's boring.

Haruhi:
I had no idea they were so merciless toward other guys.

Honey:
Suzushima is a good boy, right?

Mori:
Yeah.

Tamaki:
All right, everyone.
We'll have to work on our strategy.

Host members:
Which one?

Tamaki:
Men, it is our responsibility as members of the elite Ouran host club to make every girl happy.


Tamaki:
It is so good to see you here tonight, my little lambs.
The Ouran host club would like to bid you welcome.

Kyoya:
As always, ladies, the host club members are here for your entertainment.
So we invite you to dance to your heart's content.
Based on her dancing skills, one lucky young lady will be chosen as tonight's queen.
The queen's reward will be a passionate kiss on the cheek from our king.

Tamaki:
Good luck to you, my darlings.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Haruhi, show some enthusiasm.

Haruhi:
Well, excuse me, you guys.
Sorry.
I'm not used to this sort of thing.
I've only ever gone to the festivals held in my neighborhood park.

Kyoya:
I don't know if you can really consider that a party or not.
Well, since you're already here, you might as well get yourself something to eat.
We've got quite a spread.

Haruhi:
A spread?
With fancy tuna?

Honey:
Fan-

Hikaru and Kaoru:
-cy...

Tamaki:
...tuna?
Get some fancy tuna here right now.

Kyoya:
Add some deluxe sushi.

Haruhi:
Damn these filthy rich jerks.

Kanako:
Hello, Haruhi.
I've been looking all over for you.
Do you think maybe I could have the next dance?

Haruhi:
Yeah.
Of course you can.

Honey:
Kasuga-chan is here.

Tamaki:
All right, men.
Then let us commence with our operation.

Honey and Mori:
Roger!

Haruhi:
Wah!

Kanako:
What?
Kidnapped?

Kaoru:
There she is.

Haruhi:
You didn't have to be so forceful.

Hikaru:
Never mind that, go get changed.

Kyoya:
A little accident towards the end of night would be quite thrilling.
And remember, Haruhi, there are only 20 minutes remaining before the party reaches its climax.
Suzushima is already waiting for you in the classroom across the hall.

Honey:
You have to ask him how he feels, okay?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
We know this is the boss's strategy, but it's kind of unsettling.

Tamaki:
Gentlemen!
Here you all are.
What are you doing?
The guests are waiting for...

Hikaru and Kaoru:
So, what do you think?

Honey:
Wow, you look so cute!

Haruhi:
My face feels heavy, and it's hard to walk in these shoes.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Good luck, Haruhi.

Tamaki:
I can't believe.
She's so pretty!

Suzushima:
You are the one who wrote this letter?
You're totally different from what I imagined.

Haruhi:
Letter?

Letter:
I'm in love-love.
From the first time I saw you, I've been head over heels in love. Tee-hee-hee.
It's like my heart is stuck in a never-ending typhoon.
All these feelings of love keep whipping around in my heart like the breaking waves.
When the typhoon's rising water's come, I want to rendezvous with you on Noah's Ark!
I do! I do!

Haruhi:
Who wrote such a stupid letter?

Suzushima:
Excuse me.
Have we met somewhere before?

Haruhi:
No.
This is the first time I've ever talked to you.

Suzushima:
I'm sorry.
I'm flattered by your letter but I'm afraid I don't feel the same way.
You see, another girl already has my heart.

Haruhi:
Oh, I didn't know you had a girlfriend.

Suzushima:
Unfortunately, she is not my girlfriend.
In fact, I think she's completely over me.
In all honesty, she'd be happier with someone more self-confident than me.

Kanako:
Where exactly are you taking me, Tamaki?

Tamaki:
You know.
You're not the kind of girl who's good at manipulating others.

Kanako:
What do you mean by that?

Tamaki:
I have you figured out, Kanako.
I know you're switching from host to host to get his attention.
And I've noticed that you always look the happiest gazing into a teacup.

Suzushima:
Hey, check these out, Kanako.

Kanako:
So pretty.

Suzushima:
There's a Wedgwood, a Forley, a Worcester...
Over here is a Ginori, and a Meissen.
Someday, you're gonna be my wife, Kanako.
So I'll tell you about all of them, 'kay?

Kanako:
It's pointless.
It doesn't matter how hard I try.
He never notices me.
And now he's decided to study abroad without... without even telling me.

Suzushima:
That's why I decided I need to change.
I want to see the world, hopefully become a better man.
I know it's selfish, but I wonder if she'll wait for me.

Haruhi:
Yeah, you're right.
That is pretty selfish of you.
But maybe she would wait.
You'll never know if you don't tell her how you feel.
You obviously have strong feelings for her, so why not go head and talk to her?
I think once you decided to change, then you've already begun your transformation.

Suzushima:
Kanako...

Kanako:
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt you two.
I just...

Suzushima:
Kanako! Kanako!

Haruhi:
Looks like we just made matters worse.

Tamaki:
But he did go running after her.

Haruhi:
It's our responsibility as members of the elite Ouran host club to make every girl happy.

Tamaki:
Ladies and gentlemen.
It is now time for us to begin the final dance of this evening's festivities.
The last waltz of the night has been chosen by the host club for this couple.

Suzushima:
Princess Kasuga, may I have this dance?

Kanako:
Yes.

Suzushima:
I love you, Kanako.
I've always loved you.
And I want you to be my wife.

Kanako:
Tonight marks the end of my host hopping.

Tamaki:
May this awkward couple be forever blessed!

Hikaru:
And now we'll announce the queen of the ball.

Kaoru:
Congratulations, Princess Kanako Kasugazaki.

Hikaru:
And for her reward, a kiss on the cheek from the king...

Tamaki:
You ready?

Kaoru:
Haruhi Fujioka will stand in for Tamaki.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Kyoya did say that a little accident towards the end of night might make even more thrilling for everyone.

Suzushima:
It's just on the cheek, right?
You should accept it.
It will commemorate your graduation from host-hopping.

Haruhi:
There's no way I can kiss her.

Kyoya:
If you do it, we'll cut your debt by one-third.

Haruhi:
Well, it is just a peck on the cheek.

Honey:
Hey, you don't think this is Haru-chan's first kiss, do you?

Tamaki:
What?
Wait, Haruhi!

Haruhi:
I never would have thought that I'd end up giving my first kiss to another girl.
But it was such an amazing night.
So I guess it's just as well.


Haruhi:
If word gets out that I'm really a girl, I won't be able to stay in the Host club.

Tamaki:
Don't you worry, Haruhi.
I will protect your secret, no matter what.

Haruhi:
Next time, "Beware the Physical Exam".

Tamaki:
The Ouran host club will be waiting for you.

Host club members:
We'll see you then.
