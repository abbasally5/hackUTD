  Hikaru and Kaoru:
Can you tell, which one of us is Kaoru, and which one of us is Hikaru?

Girl:
Well, I think you're Hikaru.

Kaoru:
The two of us were always together.
We were like a single entity, a unique being.
And that closeness was very important to us.
However, we knew we were in fact separate beings.
The one that was not me was Hikaru, and the one that was not Hikaru was me.
For us, this concept was something that was...

Hikaru:
Looks like she is here.

Kaoru:
Yeah, you're right.

Hikaru:
I'm sorry.
Were you waiting long?
I read your letter.

Girl:
Hikaru.

Hikaru:
I'm really sorry, but I am Kaoru.
You must've got my desk confused with Hikaru's and put your letter in the wrong one.
Do you think that you could like me instead?
I should confess.
To be honest, I've always thought that you were really cute.
And besides, Hikaru has a crush on someone else.
So, what do you say?

Girl:
Well, I... I guess if you are okay with it, then I am too, Kaoru.

Hikaru:
I see.
Then, hey Kaoru!
She says that she'd be fine with you, instead.

Girl:
Hold on.
So then, you are Hikaru?

Hikaru:
This is getting old.
You girls just keep falling for it.

Girl:
You jerk!
Why are you so mean?!

Hikaru:
No, you're the one who's mean.
You're okay with either of us?
Really?
Who do you think you are?

Kaoru:
By the way, that hairstyle doesn't look so great on you.
If you want to go out with us, you should work on your fashion sense.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
And next time, you write a love letter, make it good.

Tamaki:
They are pretty mean, aren't they?
Are you all right, beautiful young lady?

Hikaru:
Hey Kaoru, you wanna play a game?
Check it out.
I found a cool site.

Kaoru:
Why don't we play that game on the net?

Hikaru:
Those guys are all a bunch of pansy, so too easy to beat.
Where is fun in that?

Kaoru:
Yeah, that's true.
Never mind.
Whenever something got to be boring, we ditch it.
That's just how we did things.

Boy:
Man, those Hitachiin twins are pretty intimidating.

Boy:
Yeah, it's like they're always looking down on everyone.
But my dad wants me to at least try and be friends with them.

Boy:
Yeah, mine too.

Boy:
Same here.

Boy:
But why even bother?
I don't think those two like anybody other than themselves.

Kaoru:
That wasn't entirely true.
There was one person we were very fond of.
A maid who took care of us.
We adored her.
But that was a very long time ago.

Woman:
Oh, look at you!
You two look so cute today!
Just like little dolls.
Now the twin with blue hair is Hikaru, and the twin with pink hair is Kaoru, right?

Hikaru:
No, you're wrong, auntie.
Kaoru is blue and Hikaru is pink.

Kaoru:
You always get it wrong.
You must be dumb.

Woman:
I'm sorry, boys.
It's just you sure look so much alike.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
And you know what you look like to us, auntie?
A frog.

Maid:
Oh no!
You little trouble makers!
I'm so sorry, madam.

Kaoru:
We really liked that maid.
She was different.
She didn't try to flatter us or win us over like everyone else in the house did.

Maid:
What are you two doing here?!

Hikaru and Kaoru:
We're night exploring.

Maid:
Well, now that you found me out, I guess I have to make sure you'll stay quiet.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
If we push this button, all the security guards will come running.
Should we try?
Ready, set...

Maid:
No!
Don't do it!

Hikaru and Kaoru:
We have the combination for that safe.

Hikaru:
If you play with us for a little while...

Kaoru:
We'll give you this piece of paper.

Maid:
Fine.
So what would you like to play?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
That's play, the "which one is Hikaru" game!

Kaoru:
Hikaru, you sure the paper with the combination is safe?

Hikaru:
Don't worry.
I hid it in the piggy bank.
She can't get it out unless she breaks it.

Kaoru:
All we wanted was (for) her to be able to tell the two of us apart.
We really liked that made.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Why did you break your promise?

Maid:
Sorry boys, but I didn't have a choice.
I can't tell you two apart.
You're identical.
You know, it's possible that no one will ever be able to tell which one is which.

Kaoru:
That made, the only person we ever liked, dropped that bomb on us and then disappeared into the night.
After that, we became progressively more twisted as we grew up.
And so, we build up a barrier to keep others from getting too close to us.
But regardless, there was always someone to dense to notice the barrier that would come along and try to befriend us.

Tamaki:
You have plenty of free time, huh?
I have an idea.
Why don't you help me form a club?

Hikaru:
Who the hell is this guy?

Kaoru:
Oh, I know who he is.
The girls in class were talking about him.
You know, he is that Suou kid that was admitted spring semester.

Hikaru:
Oh yeah.
So this is the guy, huh?

Tamaki:
You know me?
I had no idea I was so famous!
Oh my.
I guess I'm guilty.
I should've known my internal and external brilliance would blind my peers, but I can't help but be radiant.
So, is this the fate of God's chosen one?
He's beautiful blessed child.

Kaoru:
Where'd you get an idea like that?

Tamaki:
There's no need to be concerned about it.
Although you're not yet up to my level, the two of you do show quite a bit of promise.

Hikaru:
What are you talking about?

Tamaki:
I'm founding a new club, two months from now, in April.
Ideally, I would like it to begin as soon as I graduate into Ouran's high school.
It might be difficult at first, because you have to come up from the middle school for the next year, but I'm sure I can put in a good word for you and work it out.
It's going to be a lot of fun.
I've already asked Kyoya Otori from my class to join.
I'm sure you know him.
And I'm also asking high school 1st years Haninozuka senpai and Morinozuka senpai to join us.
That's where you two come in.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
You're bugging us!
Get lost!

Kaoru:
We don't hang out with anyone.

Hikaru:
And we certainly don't wanna hang out with you.

Kaoru:
But if you're absolutely determined to get to know the two of us...

Hikaru:
We should play?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
The "Which one of us is Hikaru" game.
You in?

Kaoru:
The rules of the game are pretty easy.
You just have to pick which one of us is Hikaru.

Hikaru:
And we'll give you one month.
You can guess as many times as you want in that month, but we'll ask for your reasoning, so no random guessing.

Kaoru:
For the record, no one has ever been able to get it right.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
If that's all right with you, then try your best.

Hiakru:
Looks like he can't handle it.

Kaoru:
Who cares about him.
Did you hear that line-up?
It's obvious why he wants to add the Hitachiin name.
It's like he's gathering the kids of highclass families.

Tamaki:
I've got one month, right?
Then I accept.
But in return, if I win, you both have to join my club.
Sorry to break it to you, but there's no doubt in my mind.
Come April, you're both going to be members.
I am certain of it!

Kaoru:
Our game had commenced.
The clock was ticking.

Girl:
Um, Hikaru, Kaoru.
We're planning a special class event after this year's closing ceremonies.

Hikaru:
Whatever, I think we'll pass.

Girl:
But, it's going to be the last event of our second year.

Hikaru:
You know, we really don't care.

Tamaki:
The one reading the book is Hikaru!

Kaoru:
Hang on.
You can't barge into our classroom.

Tamaki:
But, was I right?
I was right, huh?

Hikaru:
No, you weren't.
Sorry.

Tamaki:
Hmm, but I made a discovery.
Hikaru is right-handed.

Hikaru:
Yeah, well, we're both right-handed.

Tamaki:
Oh yeah, well, Kaoru always parts his hair on the right.

Kaoru:
No, we switch parts everyday.

Tamaki:
When you harmonize and the low part goes to...

Hikaru:
What are we?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
A choir?

Girl:
Um, excuse me?
You're Suou senpai, aren't you?

Tamaki:
That's correct, my dear.
I interrupted you, didn't I?

Girl:
Um, no.
Well I... I was just inviting the twins to come to a class event.

Tamaki:
You're going to a film festival, huh?
How nice.
I'll put them down as attending.
They'll be there.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Hey, that's our decision!

Tamaki:
What are you doing?

Kaoru:
Leaving.
You're annoying.

Tamaki:
Hey wait, what about our game?

Hikaru:
You're not bad, Suou.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
But, you're gonna have to try harder.

Kyoya:
I thought you went to go see the twins today.

Tamaki:
I did, but they ran away.

Kyoya:
I can't blame them.

Tamaki:
Would you help me out here, Kyouya?
It's for the club.

Kyoya:
Let it go.
I mean we can still form the club without them, right?

Tamaki:
No, we can't.
I want them to be a part of it.

Kyoya:
Let me guess.
They're also what you refer to as 'our friends', is that it?

Tamaki:
Yeah.
I don't understand what they're thinking.
If they want people to tell them apart, why don't they wear different hairstyles or something?

Kyoya:
Maybe, they don't want to be told apart.

Tamaki:
But, that's the whole point of the game, Kyouya.

Kyoya:
Well then, they do want to be told apart.

Tamaki:
Hold on, are you even listening to me?

Kyoya:
Well, I hear you talking.

Tamaki:
Today, Kaoru's hair's parted on the right, and Hikaru's on the left!
Good morning, Hitachiin twins!

Kaoru:
What do you want?
You can't just show up like this.

Tamaki:
Am I right?
Did I get it right?

Kaoru:
No, you couldn't be more wrong.

Tamaki:
But, I've made a discovery.
Kaoru, you're pigeon-toed, aren't you?
You should fix that.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
That's not true!
How rude!

Tamaki:
I came up with the idea last night.
We can focus on your brotherly love and make that your draw.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Huh?

Tamaki:
A somewhat taboo and perfectly symmetrical brotherly love.
The Hitachiin brothers!
So what do you think?!

Hikaru and Kaoru:
You don't make any sense.

Tamaki:
Wait!
Don't run away again!
Come back here!

Hikaru:
What's the hell with that guy?

Kaoru:
I can't believe he showed up our place.

Hikaru:
You know, when he gets all dramatic.

Kaoru:
Oh yeah, I thought so too.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
He sounds like some feudal lord.

HIkaru:
I never thought that I see young prince character like him use that Tono voice.

Kaoru:
Come back here, he said!
Come back here!

Hikaru:
I bet pretty soon he'll start talking in the third person.

Kaoru:
A feudal lord.
What a clown!

HIkaru:
But, then again...

Kaoru:
This game is getting kind of boring.



Tamaki:
Huh?

Hikaru:
Like we said, we're done.

Kaoru:
Game over.

Tamaki:
What are you talking about?
You're calling it off?

Hikaru:
We can do whatever we want.

Kaoru:
That's right.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
'Cause we heard you're the illegitimate son of Ouran's chairman.

Hikaru:
Sorry to be so blunt, but we did a little research on you.

Kaoru:
You've got quite a sad little life story, Suou.
I'm sure you wouldn't want us passing that information along.

Hikaru:
We found out that your real mother has gone missing.

Kaoru:
Be honest.
You're just lonesome, because you're all by yourself, right?

Hikaru:
We kind of feel sorry for you, but you can't force us to be your friends.

Kaoru:
We are pretty lonely.
But at least, we have each other.
That's more than you.
Hikaru, come on.

Hikaru:
'kay.

Kaoru:
He won't go sticking his nose into our business anymore.
But, you know, it's kind of a shame.

Hikaru:
We probally could've played the game a little longer.
But I'm not up for being disappointed.
Not again.

Kaoru:
We were always contradicting ourselves.
We wanted to be told apart.
We didn't want to be told apart.
We wanted people to know us.
We didn't want them to know.
We were always looking for someone who would finally accept us.
But there is no way that would ever happen.
Not as twisted as we were.
We were so afraid of someone breaking through our barrier and hurting us.
We kept a strong lock on our hearts to protect ourselves.

Hikaru:
Hey Kaoru.
She's here.

Kaoru:
Yeah, you're right.

Kaoru:
I see.
Then, Hikaru!
She said she'd be fine with you, instead!
Oh well, should have known.
You may have a sweet and pretty face, but you are terrible person, you know.

Hikaru:
By saying you'll take either of us...

Kaoru:
You're really saying you don't want either of us.

Girl:
You're mean!

Hikaru:
No, you've got it all wrong.
You're mean.

Tamaki:
The one about to rip the Letter is Hikaru!

Hikaru:
But... how did you know?

Tamaki:
Am I right?
Did I get it right?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Your reasoning?

Tamaki:
Intuition.

Hikaru:
No way.
I thought we already told you that you weren't allowed to just guess randomly.

Tamaki:
Yeah, sorry about that.
But It's still to early for me to tell.
I mean, you are both totally identical, but all depends on how you choose to look at it.
Being so identical is a talent in enough itself.
So, from now on, you should try to perfect the whole two-in-one Hitachiin brothers act.
But you mustn't forget, that you're also independent being with your own personalities.
And while you're doing that, I'll keep bugging you until I can tell you apart.

Hikaru:
That doesn't make any sense!

Kaoru:
It's contradictory!

Tamaki:
What's wrong with that?
Haven't you realized yet?
You two are contradictory.
It's what they call individuality.

Hikaru:
What are you talking about?
If we play along with this silly Hitachiin brothers act like you want us to, you'll never tell us apart.
We'll be even more identical!

Kaoru:
You didn't think about that, did you!?
How can we show our individuality if no one call tell us apart.
It's always like this!
We're the only ones who can tell the difference!
No one will ever be able to win "which one is Hikaru" game!
And we've known that from the beginning!

Tamaki:
Then, why don't you tell me something?
When someone guesses wrong, why do you look so sad?

Kaoru:
And then, I remembered.

Girl:
Well, I think you're Hikaru.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
You guessed wrong.

Kaoru:
And after that, the little girl said.

Girl:
I'm so sorry.
Please don't cry.

Kaoru:
I remember how surprised I was when I heard her say those words.
In fact, I bet we both looks like we're about to cry at the moment.

Tamaki:
Even though I might not be able to, someday, somewhere, someone's going to come along who can tell the two of you apart.
But I know this much for sure.
If you guys keep living in your own little world like you do now, chances are you're never going to meet that person.
Here's what I think.
We should open the doors of the host club together.
Let's try to expand your world together.
Our first meeting will be after opening ceremony on the first day of school.
It'll be in music room 3 in the high school.

Kaoru:
That day, we were amazed.
He answered correctly.
And subconsciously, we were a little bit... just a little bit... impressed with him.

Haruhi:
Wow, this school is incredible.
If I am admitted, am I even gonna be able to handle it here?

Honey:
I see.
So, Suou invited you to join the club too, Takashi?

Mori:
Yeah.

Honey:
Know what he said?
He told me it's perfectly okay for me to like cute stuff.
And I can eat all the cake that I want.
Now I don't know what I should do.

Mori:
Do whatever you want, Mitsukuni.
It's no big deal.

Honey:
Okay, sounds like a plan.

Haruhi:
Yeah, I think I can manage it.
I just have to pass the entrance exams.

Hikaru:
Remember, Kaoru, we can't let ourselves be moved by what that foolish lord says.

Kaoru:
Yeah, I know.
We're just here to kill some time.

Hikaru:
Right, that's it.
We're just killing time.

Maid:
You're identical.
You know, it's possible that no one will ever be able to tell which one is which.

Kaoru:
You're right, lady.
There's no one in this world who can tell the two of us apart.
No one at all.
I know that for a fact.
But even so...

Hikaru:
Let's open the doors together.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Ready, set...

Kaoru:
And so, we opened the door.

Haruhi:
"The Door the Twins Opened!"


Tamaki:
Starting today, the host club is having a special Halloween week!

Hikaru:
We're sorry, boss.

Kaoru:
We're going to miss it.
We have our class event.

Tamaki:
Hey, wait up!
Are you taking Haruhi with you?!

Haruhi:
Next time, "Until the Day it Becomes a Pumpkin!"

Tamaki:
The ouran host club will be waiting for you.

Host club members:
We'll see you then.
