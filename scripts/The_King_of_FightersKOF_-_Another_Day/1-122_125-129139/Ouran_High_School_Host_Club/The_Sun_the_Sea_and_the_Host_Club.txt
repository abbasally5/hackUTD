  Haruhi:
The beach?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Of course, the beach.

Haruhi:
But why?

Hikaru:
Don't you remember what you said?

Kaoru:
You said you'd like to go to a real beach.

Haruhi:
Did I say that?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Yes, Haruhi.
Here's the fun part.

Kaoru:
We brought some swimsuits for you to choose from.

Hikaru:
Pretty cute, don't you think?

Honey:
Not that one.
I think that this swimsuit would look much cuter on Haru-chan.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
I don't think you get it, Honey senpai.

Hikaru:
Just look.
This uniform barely hides the fact that Haruhi is as flat as a cutting board.

Kaoru:
A one-piece suit like that would only upset her because it draws attention to her lacking feminine physique.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
That's why we carefully selected this two piece suit, see?
The ruffles help hide the fact that she's so flat-chested.

Tamaki:
You punks had better quit sexually harassing my little girl!
I've had enough of you!

Hikaru and Kaoru:
That means we're not going to the beach?

Tamaki:
Who said that we're not going?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Really?
So you wanna go after all?

Hoaney:
Can Use-chan come, too?

Kyoya:
I have no problem with that.

Haruhi:
Huh?
We're really gonna go?

Tamaki:
Why not?
Let's go to the beach.


Haruhi:
"The Sun, the Sea, and the Host Club!"


Hikaru and Kaoru:
So, why'd we come to Okinawa?

Tamaki:
Because Kyoya's family has a private beach here.

Honey:
It's beautiful, isn't it?

Mori:
Yeah.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
But why couldn't we have gone...

Hikaru:
...to the Caribbean?

Kaoru:
Or even Fiji?

Kyoya:
Do you think a commoner like Haruhi has a passport?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Ahh.

Haruhi:
You do realize that I can hear what you're saying, right?

Girl:
It's so beautiful.
Tamaki, being alone here with you and looking out at the sea, it's like a dream.

Tamaki:
It's no dream.
It's real.
But if I could have my way, my princess, I'd be in your dreams every night.

Girl:
Oh Tamaki.

Kaoru:
Hey, take it easy, Hikaru.

Hikaru:
I'm sorry.
I'll get it.
Wait for me, Kaoru.

Kaoru:
It's not my fault.
The ball is rolling away.

Haruhi:
Why?

Kayoya:
Her alone time with Tamaki is up.
Next lady, please proceed.

Haruhi:
This sucks.
I thought going to the beach meant a day off.

Girl:
Um Haruhi, aren't you going to go swimming with us?

Haruhi:
No, uh, I like looking at the sea from a safe distance.

Girl:
Well, if you're not going to swim, would you mind if we sat here and talked with you?

Haruhi:
But why?
You girls should go swim.
You've got cute swimsuits on.
Why not show them off?

Hikaru:
I can't believe he fooled us.

Kaoru:
Who'd have thought he'd bring the ladies with us?

Hikaru:
We certainly didn't expect it.

Kyoya:
You were invited on this all-expenses-paid vacation for a reason and that is to keep our clients entertained.

Hikaru:
We know.
But with the ladies here,

Kaoru:
Haruhi can't change to her swimsuit.

Tamaki:
Don't worry.
I got it all under control.
My little angel shouldn't be prancing around in her swimsuit, at least not in front of two perverts like you.
And then, once the sun has begun to set, Haruhi and I will take a romantic stroll along the shore together.

Haruhi:
Oh wow, what a pretty sunset.
Oh senpai, I'd love to be with you here forever.

Tamaki:
It'll happen just like that.
The greatest day of my life.
I don't know if I can handle it.

Girl:
What's the matter with Tamaki?
Is he having a seizure?

Hikaru:
I wouldn't worry about it.

Kaoru:
He gets like this occasionally.

Honey:
Haru-chan!
Wanna go "hellfish shunting"?

Haruhi:
I think you're trying to say "shellfish hunting".
But this doesn't seem to be that kind of beach, Honey senpai.
You're not gonna find many shell...fish...
What the hell?
No way!

Kyoya:
Mori senpai.
My family's private police force has stopped by.
They wanted to make up to Honey senpai for attacking him at the water park.
So they brought shellfish.

Honey:
Amazing!
Look how many we got!

Haruhi:
We're gonna have some fancy side dishes tonight.
It's gonna be delicious.

Tamaki:
My my, certainly looks like they're enjoying themselves.
All's right with the world.

Haruhi:
Senpai, dinner is gonna be awesome.
It's a major haul!

Tamaki:
Oh I'm just so proud.
Look at my little girl!

Haruhi:
It's a major haul!
It's a major haul!

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Say what?

Haruhi:
Dinner is gonna be awesome.
It'll be a real treat!

Tamaki:
Tell me, Haruhi.
Isn't this crab crab-tivating?

Haruhi:
Oh yeah.

Tamaki:
You're so cute.

Girls:
Cen- ti- pede!

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Hey, Haruhi.

Hikaru:
Now I know most girls aren't really the bug-loving type and I certainly didn't think you were, but...

Koaru:
Don't you think you could've been easy on that little guy?

Haruhi:
Oh come on.
It's not dead.
It takes a lot more than that to kill a bug.

Girl:
Haruhi is so brave and manly.

Girl:
It's still so sweet.

Girl:
He's the best.

Hikaru:
Well, isn't that just great?

Kaoru:
Haruhi is not normal.
I thought girls were afraid of bugs.

Tamaki:
I'm sure she's afraid of something...

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Hey boss, listen up.
We just thought up a new game to play that could be a lot of fun.
What do you say?
It's called the "Who can find Haruhi's weakness" game.
So think you're up to it?

Tamaki:
But that game sounds terrible.

Hikaru:
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Besides she'd only share her weakness with someone she was really close to.

Tamaki:
What are the rules?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Now that's more like it.

Hikaru:
The deadline is sunset tomorrow.

Kaoru:
Whoever finds out her weakness first wins.

Kyoya:
And I have the perfect prize for the game's lucky winner.

Honey:
We wanna play, too!

Kyoya:
I guess that means we're all competing.

Tamaki:
Where did you get those pictures of Haruhi?

Honey:
Hey wait a minute.
Where did you get those pictures, Kyo-chan?

Kyoya:
I have my sources.
How about we just leave it at that for the moment.


Hikaru:
This is the place.
It's the most haunted spot in all of Okinawa.
The locals don't even come out here.

Kaoru:
They say that the only time you can even find this cave is at low tide.
Evidently, many people have died down here from drowning.
And their souls still linger, taking revenge on anyone who happens to come inside.

Haruhi:
What's going on?
Are you trying to freak me out?

Kaoru;
What's wrong with you?
I thought everyone was afraid of ghosts.

Haruhi:
But I've never seen a real one.

Honey:
Haru-chan!
Would you come over here?

Haruhi:
What the...?
Are you sure it's okay to drive a truck like this on the sand?

Honey:
Well, we're ready whenever you are, private police people, please lower the door.

Private police people:
Yes, sir.

Honey:
It's dark and scary in here!
I feel like I can't breathe!

Haruhi:
Honey senpai, what's wrong?

Honey:
Somebody, let me out!
I can't take it any more!


Haruhi:
Mori, ah, you're my senpai, not a sentai.

Hikaru:
This game is harder than I thought it'd be.

Kaoru:
No joke.
I'm totally bored with it already.

Hikaru:
What kind of heroine is she?
She's gotta be afraid of something, right?

Tamaki:
Ah ha!

Hikaru:
What's up, boss?

Kaoru:
What are you doing?

Tamaki:
I found some rat snakes.
Surely she'll freak out when she sees these.

Hikaru:
Anyone would think those are creepy.
So it isn't really a weakness.

Hikaru:
Hold on.
I thought there weren't any rat snakes in Okinawa.

Haruhi:
Another side dish!

Girl:
Look up here, Haruhi.

Girl:
What's up!
The breeze up here feels great!

Haruhi:
It's dangerous.
Be careful.

Girl:
This feels so good.

Girl:
Mm-hmm.

Man:
Hey there're chicks up there, man.

Man:
Aren't we lucky?
You ladies wanna hang out with a couple of locals?

Girl:
No thanks.
Please just leave us alone.

Man:
Oh come on.
We just wanna show you girls how to have a good time.

Girl:
This is a private beach.
You guys are not allowed to be here.

Man:
Private?
Does that mean we're alone?

Haruhi:
Why don't you quit bothering them?
Weren't you jerks listening?
You better just leave them alone.

Girl:
Haruhi!

Man:
You little runt.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Those aren't rat snakes.
Those are poisonous habu snakes.

Tamaki:
What do I do with them?
Come on, guys.
Help me out.

Girl:
Tamaki!
It's Haruhi!

Man:
What are you gonna do now, loser?

Girl:
Don't hurt him.

Man:
Now don't you try and act all tough, you little sissy boy.

Man:
I got an idea, kid.
How would you like to take a dip?

Tamaki:
Haruhi!

Man:
Hope you could swim.

Honey:
Haru-chan!

Hikaru:
Boss!

Tamaki:
Where'd they go?

Kyoya:
We took their ID cards and respectfully asked them to leave.
The girls all went back to the hotel and I called a doctor.
He should be arriving here any minute now.

Tamaki:
Thank you.

Haruhi:
I'm fine, you guys.
I don't need a doctor.

Tamaki:
What were you thinking?
You know, you're not like Honey senpai.
You're not a martial arts master.
Why did you confront them?
What made you think you would stand a chance?
You against two boys?

Haruhi:
But it doesn't matter that they're boys and I'm a girl.
I was there.
I had to do something.
There wasn't any time to think...

Tamaki:
That's no excuse, you idiot.
Don't forget, you're a girl.

Haruhi:
Look, I'm sorry you had to come and save me, senpai.
But I don't understand why you're so mad at me right now.
I don't think I did anything wrong.

Tamaki:
You don't think so?
Fine, whatever you say.
But I'm not speaking to you until you can admit that you were wrong!


Honey:
Ta-da.
Here you go.
Don't they look yummy?

Kyoya:
I apologize that there aren't any maids around to help you cook senpai.

Honey:
It's no big deal.
We appreciate you letting us stay here.
Hey Takashi, will you go get Haru-chan?

Honey:
It's awfully gloomy out there, huh?
It looks like it's gonna rain.

Hikaru:
It's not just gloomy outside.

Kaoru:
It's pretty gloomy right here in the dining room as well.
Just take a look at senpai.

Hikaru:
Come on.
Quit moping, boss.

Kaoru:
You shouldn't have picked a fight with her in the first place.

Honey:
Whoa!

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Haruhi, where did you get that dress?

Haruhi:
From my dad.
He must have repacked my bags when I wasn't looking.
He's always trying to get me to wear this frilly stuff.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
That's awesome!
Way to go, dad!

Honey:
You look so cute, Haru-chan.

Hikaru:
Oh, this is uncomfortable.

Kaoru:
Yeah, kind of awkward.

Honey:
Let's dig in, Haru-chan.
These are the crabs we caught.
I bet they're delicious.

Haruhi;
These crabs... taste in-crab-ible.
Get it?

Tamaki:
Don't you think you've had enough?
Give it a rest.

Haruhi:
Excuse me, I thought you weren't speaking to me.

Tamaki:
You... trying to be cute?
Okay fine, I get it.
It seems you refuse to admit that you were wrong.
See if I care, then.
I'm going to bed.
Kyoya, would you show me to my room, please?

Kyoya:
No problem.
Well, excuse me, everyone.

Haruhi:
Maybe he's right.
Maybe I do need to learn a way to protect myself.

Tamaki:
Why did you confront them?
What made you think you would stand a chance?
You against two boys?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
So, that's it.
He got to you, huh?

Hikaru:
Well, it wouldn't hurt you to learn martial arts or something.

Kaoru:
But it's not like we're going to force you to learn it.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Besides, that's not the real issue here.

Hikaru:
To be honest, we were all a little worried about how recklessly you acted.

Haruhi:
What do you mean?
I didn't cause you guys any trouble or anything.

Honey:
That's not true, Haru-chan.
I think you should apologize, 'kay?
You made us all worried, especially Tama-chan.
I think you need to apologize to him the most.

Haruhi:
So you were worried about me?
But why?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
You're hopeless.

Haruhi:
You think?
Guys, I'm really sorry.

Hikaru:
Apology accepted, you little mutt.

Kaoru:
You're so cute.
We forgive you.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Is something wrong?

Haruhi:
I'm not feeling so good.

Hikaru:
You must've eaten too much crab.

Honey:
Be strong, Haru-chan!

Kaoru:
Let's get her to the nearest restroom!
Hurry!

Haruhi:
Well, that was a waste of a good meal.
I was in such a hurry, I ran into the closest room I could find.
Where am I?

Kyoya:
Are you okay?

Haruhi:
I apologize, sir.
I didn't mean to intrude.

Kyoya:
Don't be silly.
It's just me.

Haruhi:
Kyoya senpai?
Senpai, I'm sorry.
I really didn't mean to make everyone worry about me today.

Kyoya:
Thanks, but I wasn't especially worried.
Although, I did have a hard time separating Kaoru and Hikaru from those two punks.
They almost beat them half-to-death.
And because of you, I had to send each of the girls a bouquet of flowers to apologize.
They've been looking forward to this trip and we don't wanna disappoint them.

Haruhi:
I'll pay you back for the flowers, senpai.

Kyoya:
Each bouquet cost me 50,000.
That's a grand total of 600,000 yen, Haruhi.

Haruhi:
Uh, why'd you turn the lights off?

Kyoya:
If you want to, you can pay me back with your body.
Surely, you aren't so naive that you actually believe a person's sex doesn't matter.
You've left yourself completely defenseless against me.

Haruhi:
So that's it.
You won't do it, Kyoya senpai.
I know.
Because it wouldn't do you any good.
You wouldn't gain anything from it.

Kyoya:
You're right.
You're a fascinating young woman, Haruhi.

Haruhi:
But I've learned something from this.
I guess I never realized what a nice guy you are, senpai.
I know what you're doing.
You're just trying to prove what Tamaki senpai said earlier.

Tamaki:
That's no excuse, you idiot.
Don't forget, you're a girl.

Haruhi:
I know that you're trying to prove his point, that you're just posing as the bad guy.

Tamaki:
Kyoya?
Do you have any lotion?
This sunburn is worse than I...
You bastard!

Kyoya:
Here.
Use as much as you want, you big goof.
Nothing to be gained from it, huh?
An interesting thought in its own way.

Tamaki:
What were you doing alone with him?

Haruhi:
Nothing, really.

Tamaki:
You expect me to believe that nothing was going on?
You were alone in his bedroom.
And why were the lights out?
Don't you lie to me.
Never mind.
You've been through a lot today.
I'm sure you're tired.
You should get some sleep.

Haruhi:
Senpai!

Tamaki:
What's wrong, Haruhi?

Haruhi:
It's nothing.
I just remembered there's some business I have to take care of.
Excuse me.

Tamaki:
What business could you have in a wardrobe?
Haruhi, are you afraid of thunder and lightning?
Why'd you lock yourself in there?
It seems like it would be scarier locked up like that.

Haruhi:
I'm all right.
I'm used to getting through stuff like this by myself.

Tamaki:
By yourself?
You're always by yourself.
All alone in your home.
You never call us for help even though we're so close.
I get it.
I understand now, Haruhi.
I'm sorry, I acted the way I did.
You grew up without relying on anyone else.
But not anymore.
You can come out now.
You don't have to be afraid.
I'll always be here for you, Haruhi.
I promise that you'll never be alone again.

Hikaru:
Are you sure it's a good idea?

Kaoru:
To leave the two of them alone?

Kyoya:
She's with our prince, Tamaki.
What could possibly go wrong?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Hey, boss?
We're coming in.

Tamaki:
With the blindfold on, you can't see anything, and the earplugs help muffle any sound.

Haruhi:
Wow!
Yeah, you're right.

Hikaru:
You nasty pervert.

Kaoru:
What kind of foreplay is that?

Tamaki:
It's not like that!
It's not what you think!

Hikaru:
You better watch your back, Haruhi.

Kaoru:
I never would've pegged the boss as an S&M pervert.

Tamaki:
I told you, it wasn't like that at all!

Haruhi:
I see.
Well now I know what S&M is.
I can't believe I almost let you get away with it.

Tamaki:
I wasn't doing anything freaky.
I was trying to help you.

Kyoya:
Let's go.

Tamaki:
Hey!
Don't leave without me!
Wait, you guys!


Tamaki:
I never noticed.
Haruhi is perfectly suited to attending an elite all-girls' school.
And that's exactly why I can't let her transfer.

Haruhi:
Next time, "A Challenge from Lobelia Girls' Academy!"

Tamaki:
The Ouran host club will be waiting for you.

Host club members:
We'll see you then.
