  Host club members:
Welcome to the host club!

Girl:
What are these things all over the room?
Are they furniture?

Girl:
If my memory serves me correctly, they're called kotatsu.

Girl:
Oh, I wondered what those looked like.
I've never seen one before.

Girl:
Neither have I.

Tamaki:
Indeed, it is kotatsu.
Normally, they're only used in the winter.
It may be a little early in the season for one of these, but I figured out it was perfect for you ladies.
After all, you're always one step ahead of the crowd, aren't you?
Now my darlings, I hope you'll enjoy today's home-style kotatsu service presented by our host club.

Haruhi:
I never really thought of sitting under a kotatsu as fun.

Kyoya:
Well, the ladies seem to enjoy it.

Haruhi:
Let me guess.
This kotatsu service is one of Tamaki senpai's ideas, isn't it?

Kyoya:
Yeah.
What's the matter?
Do you have something against kotatsu?

Haruhi:
Not at all.
I was just thinking about something.
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but the host club was originally founded by both you and Tamaki senpai, right?

Kyoya:
That is correct.

Haurhi:
Okay, well, here's what I don't get.
Why would somebody as cool as you fall for a crazy idea like a high school host club?

Kyoya:
Well, because it was a crazy idea.

Kyoya:
Back then, the third son of the Otori family was about to begin his final spring in middle school.


"And so Kyoya Met Him!"


Boy:
Kyoya Otori!
Kyoya, wait up!
What's up?
My dad told me he went to the completion commemoration for your family's new hospital yesterday.
He was totally surprised!
He said it was like a who's who of the top people in every field!
He asked me to be sure to tell you thank you.

Kyoya:
This is the son of the chairman of a major electronics company.
It's no big deal.
I hope you'll be able to attend the next one with your father.

Boy:
Hey Kyoya, we just heard you're at the head of the class again.

Kyoya:
This is the son of a major department store family.

Boy:
And you're gonna be class rep again for the 3rd year in a row.
How cool!

Kyoya:
And this is the youngest son of a well-known Diet member.

Girl:
Look, over there, it's Kyoya!

GIrl:
He looks so handsome!

Girl:
Yeah, he does.

Kyoya:
And these are some frivolous-minded girls.

Boy:
Hey Otori!
How would you like to come visit my family's villa in the mountains?

Kyoya:
This one's the son of a prestigious funds manger.

Boy:
You guys, can come too?
It's beautiful up there.
You can see so many stars.
We even built a small observatory.
My father likes to use the villa for vacations, so we might see him while we're there.

Kyoya:
I couldn't care less about stargazing...
That sounds like a great idea.
...but I'm very interested in meeting your father.

Fuyumi:
My, my, my, Kyoya.
You're really going to impose on his vacation just to meet his father?

Kyoya:
I'm not imposing.
I was invited.
He asked me to join him at the villa.
It's simply a give-and-take situation, sis.

Fuyumi:
Why does everything have to be so manipulative with you?
Did you think that maybe they honestly just wanted you to come look at the stars with them?
I think it's really sweet!
Two young men bonding underneath the stars.

Kyoya:
Fuyumi, would you please stop it?
I've asked you a million times to stop rummaging through my drawers like that.

Fuyumi:
What was that?
I'm not rummaging.
I'm just trying to organize all your clothes for you, Kyoya.
It won't go back in.
I know it fit in here...

Kyoya:
Why don't you just let the maid take care of that?

Fuyumi:
Listen, Kyoya.
I know dad's really strict and he puts a lot of pressure on you, but you're different than our older brothers.
Remember, he doesn't expect as much from you.
So it's okay if you take it easy sometimes.

Kyoya:
I know.
I'll never be successor to the Otori family.
I'm not like my brothers.
All they had to do was follow the path that had been promised to them, a path that keeps heading upward.
It's because I'm the third son that I can't relax.
I'll surpass father's expectations of me and I will respect my brothers, and never step on their toes in the process.
How can I demonstrate my abilities without exceeding the limits of being the third son?
I have a daunting task.
I must paint the perfect picture on a canvas that has already been placed inside a magnificent frame.

Fuyumi:
You are such a bright boy, Kyoya.
Everything you do, you do exceptionally well.
But tell me, will you ever be happy?

Kyoya:
To be honest, whether I'm happy or unhappy has nothing to do with it.
My oldest brother had already graduated from medical school, and was in training at the same hospital as my father as his successor.
My second brother was still in medical school, and was planning to get an MBA after he graduated, so he could support our brother.
And then, there was me, the third son.

Kyoya's father:
Kyoya, today is the day that Suou's son is going to be transferring into your class, right?
We've done business with the Suou group for many years and we have a wonderful relationship with them.
But competition is still a possibility.
So, I've been thinking.
Your befriending young Suou would be in our family's best interest.
But whatever you do, Kyoya, don't forget.
Always keep your friends close and your enemies closer.

Kyoya:
Yes, sir.
I remember.

Kyoya's father:
Staying at the head of the class isn't enough.
Both of your brothers did the same when they were in school.
I'm sure you are all aware that it'll take more than that to satisfy me.
I'm counting on you, Kyoya.

Kyoya:
Yes, sir.
I know that.
I was confident that I had the ability to see through other people's facades but that they could never see through mine.
It didn't matter what the Suou guy might be like.
Making friends with him would be easy.
I would do anything my father wanted.
Tamaki Suou.
So, a son was conceived while the chairman was overseas.
The chairman eventually decided to take him in since he had no other children and he was recently divorced.
And so the chairman's love child becomes the heir to the Suou group overnight.
Well, isn't he a lucky fellow.


Teacher:
Class representative, vice representative, please come this way.
Allow me to introduce you to our new student, Tamaki Suou.

Tamaki:
It's a pleasure to meet you, both.

Teacher:
This is class representative, Kyoya Otori, and vice representative, Ayame Jonouchi.

Tamaki:
You have the most beautiful straight hair that I've ever seen.
I would assume that your heart is just as blindingly beautiful as that hair of yours.

Kyoya:
Maybe, it's a cultural difference.

Tamaki:
Nice to meet you, Otori.

Kyoya:
The pleasure is all mine.
You know, if you'd like, I can take you on a tour of the school.

Tamaki:
That'd be great.
Thank you very much.

Kyoya:
Up ahead of us is the west school building.
And all special classrooms are on the other side.

Tamaki:
Oh, I forgot.
I was wondering, Otori.
Do you have a kotatsu at your house?
Oh surely you do.
I think kotatsu are simply amazing.
I've always thought it was cool that Japanese sit on the floor.
I told myself I would sit under one, once I got to Japan.
But at home, the decor is all western.

Kyoya:
Ah, so he's one of those.
There are a number of foreigners enamored with Japanese culture.
Unfortunately, we don't have any kotatsu either.
We do have Japanese decor though.
What happened?
Did I step on a land mine or something?

Tamaki:
I can't believe it.
You don't have a kotatsu.
I'm sorry, Otori.
It was rather insensitive of me to ask you that.
I guess your family isn't as close as they could be.
Look, it's okay if you don't have to hide it any more.
I'm well aware that the kotatsu is a symbol for a happy home life in Japan.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but here in Japan, you playfully kick each other's feet under the kotatsu while building familial bonds of trust and watching costume grand prix, right?
And of course, you also eat plenty of Mandarin oranges.
I feel sorry for you.
You and your family are missing that.

Kyoya:
I hate to correct you, but I think you've got the wrong idea.
If it's that important to you, we can always put a kotatsu in our home for you to visit.

Tamaki:
Thank you, Otori!
Yay. You're such a good friend!
You're my best friend!
Hey Otori, I don't want to be too forward or anything, but since we're pals, do you think it's okay for me to call you by your first name?

Kyoya:
Listen, Suou...

Tamaki:
Bravo!
Kyoya!
My pal!
Mon ami!
Yahoo!

Fuyumi:
My, my, my, Kyoya, you became his best friend in one day?

Kyoya:
I don't think he even knows what it means to be best friends.
To be honest, I can't be positive if he's even fluent in Japanese.
Sis, how many times do I have to tell you?
Would you please quit rummaging through my drawers like that?
Today, he drew me in.
Got me to play everything at his pace.
Well, at least now I know he's a complete idiot.

Fuyumi:
Kyoya, you have too many things crammed into these drawers.
Once you pull something out, there is no way to get it back in.

Kyoya:
Then, don't pull anything out.

Tamaki:
Kyoya, I need to ask a favor of you.
You see, I really want to go to Kyoto.
I got so excited about the kotatsu, that I forgot.
I always said that once I got to Japan, I'd go to Kyoto.
The great Buddha at Nara, Goryokaku park, I want to see Shisa, and Namahage.
I want to see everything.

Kyoya:
One problem.
None of those things are in Kyoto.
He's an even bigger idiot than I thought.
How about we see each of those things one at a time?
Why don't we go to Kyoto this weekend, and then on our next school holiday, we can go to Okinawa.

Tamaki:
Thank you, Kyoya!
You are the greatest like a god, like the great Buddha!
Kyoya!
Mon ami!
Mon ami!
Kyoya!
Yahoo!

Kyoya:
Again with the mon ami business.
It's only the second day I've known him and I'm already a god in his eyes.


Kyoya:
For some reason, it seems like I just can't get my head around this guy.
Before I knew it, he'd completely won over our class.

Tamaki:
Kyoya!
I found a Namahage!
Namahage, Namahage!

Kyoya:
No, that's a Shisa.

Fuyumi:
My, my, my, Kyoya, I knew I'd find you up late studying.
Wait a minute.
Are those travel guides?
Oh wow!
So, you guys are going to Hokkaido next.
That's wonderful.
But if you need a guide, I'm sure you could ask the family driver.

Kyoya:
That's not good enough.
Not for this Tamaki Suou guy.
When we went to Kyoto, he wanted to see the Daimonji bonfire, even though it's still spring time, and as we were eating Okinawa soba noodles, he tells me he wants to compare them to Shinshu Soba noodles.
Then he went on about whether a Shisa or Namahage would win in a fight.
And then, after all that!

Tamaki:
I'm sorry for asking you to do all of this.
You're right.
It's not your responsibility, Kyoya.
I'm sorry.
I've overestimated your ability to entertain me.

Kyoya:
But this time, I'm going to make sure I'm ready for anything!
I promise that one of the two of us in Hokkaido, I'll entertain you everywhere, Suou!

Tamaki:
We're going to Hokkaido?
I know you wanna enjoy your life to the fullest.
But don't you think we should be spending our time studying for finals right now?
We can go to Hokkaido, when they're over.
I think you should start hitting the books, my friend.

Fuyumi:
My, my, my, Kyoya, what on earth is the matter with you?

Kyoya:
That bastard!
He's an idiot!
I knew that!
But I honestly had no idea that he, that he was such a total dumb ass!

Tamaki:
Next week, let's go to Hokkaido, okay?!

Kyoya:
I've never wanted to hit someone so badly in my entire life!
Damn!
I hate him!
Okay, calm down.
He may be an idiot, but he's the Suou family's heir.
Getting emotional isn't going to help anything.
Obviously father's testing my ability to cope with certain situations.
Even so, I won't forget this, you bastard!
Damn you, Tamaki Suou!
You really expect me to buy a kotatsu just for you?!

Fuyumi:
I was going to tell Kyoya that if he can't stand the kid, then there's no reason to force himself to hang out with him.
But you know, I've never seen him so passionate about anything before.

Kyoya:
Damn you, Suou!

Kyoya:
It's been a while since I've had a day off from Tamaki.

Fuyumi:
Your friend has come to visit today.

Kyoya:
My friend?

Fuyumi:
Beautiful, isn't it?
It brings me to tears.

Kyoya:
To be honest, the first time I heard him play the piano, I was in complete shock.
Not because my brothers were in tears, but because without even realizing it, that beautiful music had brought me to tears as well.

Tamaki:
Sorry for just dropping in out of the blue like this.

Kyoya:
If that's how you feel, then go home!
So what happened to studying for finals?
Have you finished yet?

Tamaki:
Wow, your house is gigantic, Kyoya!
I wonder if this one could be any bigger than my house, the one I have in France.

Kyoya:
What are you trying to say?
Well, I don't know about your mansion in France, but I'm sure your estate is bigger than mine, right?

Tamaki:
Well, I wouldn't know, because I've never been to the main estate before.
And the second estate is small.
So, Kyoya, are you the successor to the Otori family estate?

Kyoya:
Is this guy actually trying to pick a fight with me?!
There's no way that'll happen.
My brothers, they're the first in line.
I'm sure that I'll just end up working for them some day.

Tamaki:
Really?
That's a surprise.
Maybe I'm wrong, but I get the feeling you want more than that.
I mean, when I look in your eyes, I can tell you're not happy with your situation.
I'm surprised you'd give up so easily.

Kyoya:
This has nothing to do with whether I'm giving up or not.
It's just the way things are.
You wouldn't understand because you'll be successor to your family's estate without even having to lift a finger.
Damn it.

Tamaki:
It's not certain that I'll be the Suou family successor.
My grand mother doesn't like me.
So, if things stay the way they are now, then I'm not the heir.
I'm not anything.
I'm kind of on a probationary period.
I can't believe I didn't tell you that.
To be completely honest with you, I'm not really all that interested in my father's line of work.
And besides, look at me.
I can't let these looks go to waste.
And you know, I am incredibly smart.
So maybe I could be a brilliant scientist.
You know what, I'd love to do more than anything.
I wanna open an animal kingdom in the north.
When I close my eyes, I can see it.

Kyoya:
Shut up, Tamaki!
Do you expect me to believe that crap?!
How can you possibly give up on being your family successor so easily?!
You have no idea what it's like for me!
You actually have a chance at it. All you have to do is try!
Take advantage of your fortunate circumstances!
Don't you realize the position that you've been blessed with?!
I can't believe you.
Damn it!
Who the hell are you?!
Of course, I know that my brothers are no more suited to the position than I am.
But, I will always feel the frustration of not being able to step outside of my frame.
Because I'm the third son.

Tamaki:
Hold on, it sounds to me like you're the one who isn't trying.
If you really want to surpass your brothers, then you can do it.
But I think the one who has given up here is you, Kyoya.
Oh yeah, by the way, where is that kotatsu I asked for.
Not to be a pain, but I thought you'd have it ready for me by now.
That's why I stopped by your place.
What is it?
Hey what's so funny.
Let me guess.
You've got the kotatsu ready to go and you're trying to hide it from me.

Kyoya:
It's not all about you, ya know!
Kotatsu are only used in the winter.
So, if you want to sit under one, you'll have to wait until then.
Now would you quit being a dumb ass?

Tamaki:
Oh man, your face, it looks evil.
So you're finally showing your true colors.

Tamaki:
Hey Kyoya, I just had the most brilliant idea!
We should start a club together.
We could start our club activities as soon as we get into the high school.
And we can finally make use of our good looks with a high school host club!

Kyoya:
Sleep first, and then dream.

Tamaki:
I'm serious.
I already know who we should ask to join.
We have to ask Haninozuka senpai and Morinozuka senpai from the high school, and those 2nd year twins.

Kyoya:
It seemed like the more I listened, the more ridiculous his plans became.
But for some reason, I got the feeling that if I shared his world, I would experience something different than anything I had ever experienced before.


Tamaki:
As a special event during the school festival, the host club will be opened to the public for the next two days.
We will entertain our guest even more extravagantly than we usually do.

Haruhi:
Next time, "The Host Club Declares Dissolution!"

Tamaki:
The ouran host club will be waiting for you.

Host club members:
We'll see you then.
