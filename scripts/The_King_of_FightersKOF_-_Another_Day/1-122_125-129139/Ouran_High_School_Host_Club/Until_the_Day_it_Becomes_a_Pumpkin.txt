  Kaoru:
At the stroke of midnight, the carriage would change back into a pumpkin.
But, this particular spell wasn't cast by a fairy god mother.

Class rep:
All right, next item on the agenda.
I move to discuss what the class plans will be for next week.

Haruhi:
Next week?

Hikaru:
Yeah! Halloween!

Kurakano:
Oh Haruhi, you've only been a student at Ouran Acdemy since high school, right?
So, you don't know.
After we finish taking our exams for the fall, we're allowed a few days off until the end of October, and we get to throw costume parties on campus to celebrate.

Class rep:
And also, to promote camaraderie, each class is allowed to use an entire day for a special class event of their choosing.

Haruhi:
Event?

Kaoru:
Right!
They're pretty fun actually.

Hikaru:
Yeah, we socialize, or watch some old movies, stuff like that.

Renge:
Boring! Boring! Boring!!
Halloween!
The day that sounds the death knell of summer and ushers in the icy breath of winter!
Halloween!
Once a day when ghouls walk the earth and disguised as ghouls we try to ward them all off.
Halloween!
A day for wearing costumes!
And playing pranks on trick or treaters with a reckless abandon!

Hikaru:
Some people don't wait for Halloween to dress up.

Kaoru:
Some people cosplay year round.

Haruhi:
I know that's right.
So, what's with the uniform?

Renge:
Just between us.
This is the female uniform in Uki Doki Memorial 2 which isn't scheduled for release until next spring!
What do you think?
I know important people on the inside if you catch my drift.

Class rep:
Ms. Hoshakuji, we're having homeroom now.
Could you get down off the desk, please?

Renge:
Tea parties and cosplay?
The Host Club does that practically non stop!
What our Halloween requires is something special, special, special!

Class rep:
Um, we're supposed to decide this as a class.

Renge:
So, I propose holding a Halloween Test of Courage tournament!
The bravest student wins!

Hikaru:
A test of courage...

Kaoru:
Tournament, you say?

Renge:
Here's what we'll do.
We'll ask the superintendent to give us access to the school after hours when it's dark.
Then, we'll all dress up in our freakiest costumes and proceed to have the time of our lives scaring the absolute crap out of each other!

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Yeah.
We're in.

Hikaru:
I really like the part about...

Kaoru:
It being dark.

Boy:
That sounds awesome.

Girl:
Oh, so spooky at night.

Class rep:
Well now, why don't we think this through everyone?
We can't all go individually.
We should be in teams of at least 3 or 4.

Kurakano:
Yeah, teams would be scarier.

Hikaru:
And anybody who leaves...

Kaoru:
Gets featured on the front page of the school newspaper as the "Captain of All Cowards".

Everyone:
Seconded!

Class rep:
All right then, are there any objections to the majority vote?
Are there any at all?
Is anyone opposed to the idea?
Come on, anyone?
Oh, very well then, the motion passes unanimously.
The Class 1-A event for this year will be a special Halloween Test of Courage tournament.


"Until the Day it Becomes a Pumpkin!"


Tamaki:
Trick or treat, girls.
Give me candy or else your blood.
Halloween might be a week away officially, but here at the Host Club, we start haunting season a little early.

Girl:
Oh Tamaki, you make such a handsome vampire.

Girl:
Those fangs look real.

Tamaki:
May I nibble your lovely neck for a treat?

Girl:
Oh no, you mustn't.
You'll have to play a trick on me, instead.

Tamaki:
Oh indeed, I shall.

Girl:
Oh, me next, me next, me next, me next, me next!

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Hello!

Tamaki:
Why are you guys late?
Hurry up and change.

Hikaru:
Sorry, boss, but from now until Halloween...

Kaoru:
Count us out.

Hikaru and Koaru:
Okay?

Tamaki:
What?!

Honey:
Count you out?

Hikaru and Koaru:
We're on the preparation committee for a special event.
Class 1-A is sponsoring it.

Kyoya:
Duty calls, then.

Hikaru and Koaru:
Good luck without us here for a week!

Honey:
You have fun!

Tamaki:
Hold on!
Why is Haruhi going?

Hikaru:
Oh boss, she is in our class, you know.

Kaoru:
Oh, the special event is an after dark test of courage tournament.

Tamaki:
After dark?!

Haruhi:
Wah!
I'm scared, Hikaru!
Hold me!
Protect me!
Wah, I'm scared, Kaoru!
Hold me!
Protect me!

Tamaki:
Haruhi, you're not going to take part in this, are you?
For decency's sake, tell me you won't!

Haruhi:
Calm down, senpai.
It's just some harmless fun.

Tamaki:
Harmless...
She thinks it's harmless!
Why me?!
You won't go!
You can't!
Daddy doesn't like it!

Kaoru:
This is the magic spell.
We may just be members of a host club, but the boss calls Haruhi his daughter, and imagines us to be members of his family.

Hikaru:
Okay, time to go now.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Boss, adieu!

Tamaki:
Wait!
I can be a valuable asset to the planning community.
Let me come too!
Nekozawa senpai, when did you?

Nekozawa:
Well now, isn't this interesting?
What was that?
You think it sounds like fun, Belzenef?
You may just be onto something there.
If it's fear they want, the Black Magic Club will be happy to oblige.
After all, what's Halloween without a healthy dose of pure unadulterated terror?

Kurakana:
So what kind of budget limit should we put on costumes?
Once everyone starts shopping, they'll go all out.

Hikaru:
Why don't we follow the commoner's rule of keeping it under 300 yen?

Kaoru:
That should make things interesting.

Renge:
It would be a good idea to have a doctor handy, just in case anyone faints, has a heart attack, just jumps out of a window, or something.

Haruhi:
They all seem pretty excited about this...

Kaoru:
Okay, so under 300 yen.
Needs a doctor present.
Hey, are we gonna have food?

Haruhi:
You have nyctophobia?
So, you're afraid of the dark?

Class rep:
Yes, and you can add to that horror-movie-phobia, scary-ghost-story-phobia, being-startled-by-a-loud-noise-in-the-other-room phobia, and accidentally-seeing-trailers-for-horror-movies phobia.
And what's with those things?
Why do they keep showing them without warning us about it first?
It just doesn't make sense to me.
Whatever happened to civil rights for the fraidy-cats out there?
Cowards are people, too.
And what about the other classes?
With their tea parties?
It's just so unfair!

Haruhi:
Class rep, calm down.

Class rep:
Oh my, I'm sorry.

Haruhi:
If you were opposed to the idea from the start, why didn't you just bring it up in the meeting?

Class rep:
I tried to, but I don't wanna look like I'm throwing my weight around out there.
So, I was counting on your help to save me!

Haruhi:
Please clam down.

Class rep:
I'm sorry.

Haruhi:
How exactly was I supposed to save you?

Class rep:
I was desperately giving you signs to oppose the motion while it was up for vote, but you just didn't seem interested!

Class rep:
Are there any objections to the majority vote?
Are there any at all?
Is anyone opposed to the idea?
Come on, anyone?

Class rep:
If just one person objects, then it goes up for discussion.

Haruhi:
Uh... sorry, I had no idea.

Class rep:
Please Fujioka, you have to let me be on your team!
If I'm with you, then maybe your piece of mind will help me and I can remain more calm!

Haruhi:
Class Rep!

Class rep:
And one more thing.
You can't tell the Hitachiin Brothers.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Huh? Is someone a fraidy-cat?

Kurakano:
Oh, there you are.
We're about to choose groups.
So do you have any idea who you'd like to have on your team?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Yeah!
The four of us will be one!

Kurakano:
Great!
Then you guys are Team B.
All right?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Sounds like fun, right, Class Rep?

Class rep:
This is a nightmare!

Haruhi:
It's all over now...


Hikaru:
Hey, Kaoru, tell us the story about the evil clock tower witch!

Kaoru:
One Halloween many years ago, a girl dressed in a witch costume fell to her death from the tower.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
And now whoever sees her ghost on Halloween night... will be cursed forever!

Class rep:
No!
Please stop it, you guys!

Haruhi:
Will you knock it off?
The point is to scare someone not on your team.
Why don't you save that dumb shtick for somebody else?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
But no one's come yet.
We're tired of waiting around.

Haruhi:
Hey, not so fast!
Look Class Rep.
Cool, huh?
I borrowed this book from the library.
"Surefire methods for coping with anxiety."

Class rep:
Fujioka.

Haruhi:
Now let's have a look, shall we?
The three cardinal rules for dealing with anxiety are as follows.
First, pretend everything is okay.
Second, whistle a cheerful little tune.
Thirdly, repeat to yourself, "I'm brave."

Class rep:
Are you kidding me?!
None of those things actually work!
Call me the Captain of All Cowards!
You can scream it from the roof top!
Just get me out of here!

Kaoru:
Really?
Even if it means Kurakano will think you're a big chicken?

Haruhi:
Whoa, wait a minute.
What's going on with you and Kurakano?

Class rep:
No!
It's not like that!
We're just friends!
I've known her since we were little!
None of this has anything to do with it.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Fine, fine, we understand.

Hikaru:
Funny how you had told us you didn't want to throw your weight around.

Kaoru:
When the reason you agreed to any of this is because you didn't want to look like a fraidy-cat.

Class rep:
That's not it.
That's not the reason why I couldn't oppose it.
I...
It's just...

Kurakano:
That sounds like so much fun! fun... fun...

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Huh?

Class rep:
Kurakano... well, she had her heart set out on this tournament.
I didn't want to let her down.
So I couldn't say no.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
You mean!

Hikaru:
Oh crap!
He's totally pure!

Kaoru:
He's got a heart of gold, Hikaru!

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Our powers are nothing against his wholesomeness!

Hikaru:
So, does this mean we have to help him now?

Haruhi:
Did you see that?
That creepy shadow just now, outside the window?

Class rep:
Oh, come on!
Not you too, Fujioka!
Knock it off, would you?!

Kaoru:
No way!
It's a sneak attack from those A Team acts.

Hikaru:
Hey!
It's not your turn, guys!
Follow the rules!

Tamaki:
My skull.

Kaoru:
Yeah!
You show'em.

Tamaki:
My skull...my skull...

Class rep:
Could it be... the Clock Tower Witch?!

Tamaki:
Why did you kick my skull?!

Class rep:
Who's there?

Mori:
I'm Frankenstein.

Honey:
I am the Wolfman!

Kaoru:
Class Rep, slow down!
I can't keep up!

Nekozawa:
My fright strategy was perfection itself.
Kyoya, you're not joining in on the fun?

Kyoya:
I am not.

Kaoru:
Damn it, they've locked us in.

Hikaru:
Ow, this was supposed to be a tournament not a hunt!
Kaoru!
Where is he?!
I've got to find Kaoru!

Haruhi:
Ow!
Hey, cut it out!
Stop thrashing around like an idiot!
I can get us out of this with my sewing scissors.

Hikaru:
Wow, even you have a feminine side.
Impressive.

Haruhi:
And just what is that supposed to mean?
You've got a smart mouth!

Hikaru:
What do you mean I've got a smart mouth?
Kaoru has one too, you know.

Haruhi:
Dream on!
Not when he's all by himself, he doesn't, unlike you.
When you're alone, you only get worse.
Believe me.

Hikaru:
Oh, yeah?

Haruhi:
Now, hold still for a second.

Hikaru:
What are you doing?

Haruhi:
Grow up.
This is the only way I can reach where I need to cut.
I know it's awkward, but it'll only take a minute.

Hikaru:
No, it's all right.
Take your time.

Tamaki:
I can't allow this.

Nekozawa:
Patience, Tamaki.
The payoff is yet to come.

Kaoru:
It's hopeless.
There's no one outside.
Looks like the A Team got a little overzealous, huh?

Class rep:
Which one are you?

Kaoru:
I'm Kaoru.
Are you scared?

Class rep:
Well, not anymore.
No, my nerves kind of shut down.

Kaoru:
Man, our plans are completely shot.
Such a shame.
We even had it all figured out, down to the last detail.
We had worked out a plan to frighten Kurakano half to death and then let you come charging to her rescue.

Class rep:
Wow, you'd do that for me?
That's really thoughtful of you.
But I don't stand a chance.
There's someone else she likes.

Kurakano:
Haruhi!

Class rep:
While it's true Fujioka doesn't seem to feel the same way quite yet, I'm positive that it's only a matter of time.

Kaoru:
Yeah, that's not going to happen.
I can promise you that.

Class rep:
Why not?

Kaoru:
It just won't.

Class rep:
Still, this may sound weird, but I don't wanna risk changing anything right now because things are perfect.
Just being on the committee with her is such an honor.
If this is as good as it's going to get, I'm still grateful.

Kaoru:
So in other words, you've cast a spell on the carriage.
And maybe you're right, Class Rep.
Keeping things the way they are wouldn't be so bad.
I'm sure that's what the boss had in mind when he put a spell on his own carriage.
We're like a family to him.
He doesn't want that to change.

Class rep:
Huh?

Kaoru:
Back when we were children, neither the boss nor Hikaru and I had many friends to speak of.
Now he just wants to enjoy what he has for as long as he can.
I can't blame him.

Class rep:
Uh sorry but, you've lost me.

Kaoru:
But still, one of these days, it'll all turn back into that same old grubby pumpkin, again.

Hikaru:
Kaoru!
Are you in there?!
Kaoru!

Kaoru:
Hikaru!

Hikaru:
Kaoru.

Kaoru:
Hikaru.

Class rep:
Uh, so what happened to Fujioka?

Hikaru:
Oh yeah, that's right.
Kinda lost track.

Haruhi:
What is wrong with you?
I get us out.
You go tearing off by yourself!

Hikaru:
Uh, sorry.

Renge:
Oh, there they are!

Kurakano:
We've been so worried about the four of you!

Boy:
Why did you leave your post in the middle of the tournament?
We called off the whole thing to go looking for you!

Kaoru:
Wasn't that you guys trying to scare us?

Boy:
Huh?
We didn't do anything.

Renge and Kurakano:
Aaah!

Haruhi:
What is it?

Kurakano:
Outside!

Renge:
By the window!
There's a dark figure!

Haruhi:
They sure got us.

Hikaru:
Nekozawa is such a jerk.

Kaoru:
How did we not know that was Belzenef?

Kurakano:
I heard.
You're really a fraidy-cat, aren't you, Kazukiyo, but you still agreed to the tournament, just to be nice?

Class rep:
Uh, yeah, sure, that's it.

Kurakano:
I think that's so unbelievably sweet of you!

Kaoru:
Would you look at that?
I guess the spell on the carriage can't last forever, after all.

Hikaru:
What do you mean?

Haruhi:
What is wrong with you?
I get us out.
You go tearing off by yourself!

Hikaru:
Uh, sorry.

Kaoru:
Well, since you ran towards me in that situation, I suppose everything is all right for now.

Hikaru:
Hmm?

Kaoru:
Nothing, nothing, just my own private joke.
Let's get out of here!
Still, one day Hikaru will realize he wants to take the next step on his own...
When that happens, I don't know what I'll do.


Haruhi:
Huh?
Mori senpai has an apprentice?

Tamaki:
Wait a minute!
The apprentice is from the Kasanoda Syndicate.

Haruhi:
Are you serious?

Next time, "Mori-senpai Has an Apprentice Candidate!"

Tamaki:
The ouran host club will be waiting for you.

Host club members:
We'll see you then.
