  Arai:
Haruhi Fujioka?

Haruhi:
Hey, Arai.

Arai;
So uh, these your friends?

Haruhi:
Oh yeah.
This is Hikaru and Kaoru.
They're in my class.
And this is my sen..

Tamaki:
While you are acting as my apprentice, you may not treat me as your senpai.

Haruhi:
An acquaintance of mine.

Tamaki:
Misuzu, please don't add any sound effects to my moment of despair.


"Operation Haruhi and Hikaru’s First Date!"


Haruhi:
I haven't seen you since graduation.

Arai:
Yeah.
You cut all your hair off.
That's such a shame.

Haruhi:
I don't think so.
I mean, since I cut it, it has been easier to manage.

Arai:
So, how's Ouran treating you?
Do you keep in touch with anyone from middle school any more?

Haruhi:
Yeah, a little.
Kazumi still calls me.
What about you?

Kyoya:
So, then he's a friend of Haruhi's from middle school, huh?

Hikaru:
They've had zero contact since graduation.
So, in my opinion they’re not friends just former classmates.

Arai:
So these guys are all in a club with you.

Haruhi:
Host club.

Arai:
Oh, is that so?

Hikaru:
Hey, Haruhi!
Don't you think you should be working?
You shouldn’t be slacking off!

Haruhi:
Misuzu said I can take a break.
Hey, quit making more garbage I'll have to take out.

Tamaki:
It's not garbage.
I'm making a hamster home.

Haruhi:
But Senpai, you don’t have a hamster.

Tamaki:
I'm not your senpai.
I’m just an acquaintance of yours

Arai:
Wow, who knew you Ouran guys were so funny?
You know, it’s such a prestigious school.
I’ve always imagined that it was a whole different world.

Haruhi:
It's a different world, all right.

Arai:
To be honest with you, Fujioka, I was kinda worried that you were gonna have a hard time going to such an elite school.
I‘m glad to see you're doing well.
Um, I mean, it’s not like I was the only one who was worried about you.
Lots of people were.

Hikaru:
What’s with him?
He’s trying to use the refreshing innocence approach.
Someone should tell him we already had a refreshment contest.

Kyoya:
You're being unusually critical.

Hikaru:
I’m just sayin'!
It’s obvious this guy has a thing for Haruhi!
It’s sickening to watch him try and flirt!

Haruhi:
Hikaru!
What's wrong with you?
Quit acting like such a Jerk!

Arai:
Hey, it's no big deal.
He's right.
I did have a thing for you once.
But who cares?
You already turned me down, right?

Tamaki and Honey:
Huh!?

Haruhi:
Huh!?

Kyoya:
Why do you look so surprised?

Haruhi:
Well I didn’t know...

Tamaki:
You have to fill us in on this story, Arai.
Now when did this happen?

Arai:
Well, it was about a year ago...


Arai:
There she is!
Fujioka!
I heard you're taking the honor student exam for Ouran Academy.

Haruhi:
Mm-hmm.

Arai:
You are?
Well you just might make it in with your grades.
Although, I was sure you'd be going to Higashi High.

Haruhi:
I'm taking the test for Higashi, too.
I don't know if I'll be accepted to Ouran.

Arai:
Yeah.
Well, I guess I'll just cheer for you.
I'd have liked to go to the same high school as you, though.

Haruhi:
Well, okay then, you really should've said something to me sooner.

Arai:
You mean...

Haruhi:
I'm pretty sure that Ouran's awarding more than one honor student scholarship.

Arai:
Oh, that...

Haruhi:
And even if there is only one, you can't give up on going to the school of your dreams for someone else's sake.
If only one of us gets in, there won't be any hard feelings, right?
We should both do our best.
I know, let's go and ask the counselor about it.

Arai:
Fujioka!
I- I want... I want you to go with me!

Haruhi:
Yeah.
I wanted to check the application deadline, too.
Let's go to the staff room together.


Kyoya:
Haruhi.
You broke this innocent man's heart, just to get a laugh from some sick joke?

Haruhi:
Um... No.
That wouldn't have happened. I didn't understand what he meant...

Honey:
This crime is pretty serious, huh?

Haruhi:
I'm so sorry.

Arai:
So you're turning me down again a whole year later?
Don't worry, Fujioka.
I'm over it already.
You didn't realize what I meant, so that means you weren't interested.
But you know... I was always drawn to that faraway look in your eyes.
And the way you would look someone in the eyes when you spoke to them.
I liked that about you.
I always thought you were special.

Tamaki:
You think that much of my little girl?
Don't worry, I'll never forget your gallantry!

Honey:
Wow!
You guys went to Kyoto for your middle school field trip?
How unusual that you stayed in the country.

Arai:
Nah, it's quite normal for us really.

Tamaki:
Well, I've always been a fan of Kyoto.

Kyoya:
I can't tell you how many times I’ve had to tour the temples with him.

Kaoru:
What should we do, Hikaru?
They're having a good time over there.
We could join them.

Hikaru:
No, I'm not going to.
I can't believe the boss is actually hanging out with that jerk.

Tamaki:
Hikaru, Kaoru!
Get over here!
This may be our only chance to hear what Haruhi was like in Middle school.

Hikaru:
Sorry, but I’m not interested.
Man, how stupid can you guys get?
Where's the fun in sitting around talking about somebody’s past.
I don’t see the appeal.
Besides, doesn’t that guy realize Haruhi doesn’t want anything to do with him?
She's got plenty of friends.
So she doesn’t need you around.
Get it?

Haruhi:
That's not something for you to decide, Hikaru!
I'm not gonna tolerate you insulting my friends any more!
You got that!?

Hikaru:
But why?
Why should anyone else even matter to you?
I thought we were your friends!
Are we or aren't we?!

Kaoru:
Hikaru!
Wait for me!

Tamaki:
Their world is still so small.
It's such a shame.

Kaoru:
That’s some temper you’ve got there.
Aren’t you a bit old for that?

Hikaru:
Don’t pretend like you weren’t upset too.

Kaoru:
Well maybe I was, but I'm more rational than you.
I don’t think I’ve ever seen you act to selfishly before, like a little child.
Haruhi was surprised.

Hikaru:
Well, I couldn’t help it.
I was really upset, but I can't figure out why.

Kaoru:
Here’s an idea.
Why don’t you go and apologize to Arai?

Haruhi:
I'm really sorry, Arai.

Arai:
It's okay.
I don't know what I did, but whatever it was, it sure seemed to set him off, huh?

Honey:
Huh?
Hika-chan.

Kaoru:
I was outta line.
I'm sorry.

Arai:
Thanks, don't worry about it.
Well see you soon, Fujioka.
Bye, guys.

Honey:
Bye-bye!

Haruhi:
So Kaoru.
Tell me why you're pretending to be Hikaru.
Hey, what happened to that scratch on your cheek?

Kaoru:
I just covered it up with some concealer.
I don't think Hikaru's temper is gonna let up anytime soon.
He's no fun when he's like this, so I've got a small favor to ask of you.
How would you like to go out with me tomorrow on a date?


Hikaru:
Sorry to keep you waiting.

Haruhi:
Hold on.
Where's Kaoru?

Hikaru:
Well, uh...

Kaoru:
I was going to take Haruhi out to make up for what happened yesterday.
But I seem to have caught a cold.

Hikaru:
You're not feelin' too good?

Kaoru:
Will you take her out in my place?

Hikaru:
Huh?

Kaoru:
She’s expecting me to hang out with her all day, so make sure you show her a good time.
And it better go well, or she’s never gonna talk to you again.
Think you can handle it?

Hikaru:
Yeah, that shouldn’t be a problem.

Kaoru:
You sure?

Hikaru:
Hey, come on.
You think I can't do it?

Kaoru:
Well, you’ve never really gone out with anyone before.
So just listen carefully, 'kay?
You have to tell other people how you feel or they’ll never know.
And remember...

Hikaru:
What were you thinking, Kaoru?

Haruhi:
What should we do?
Wanna go home?

Hikaru:
No, I told him I'd hang out with you today, so we might as well.
But what's up with that outfit?

Haruhi:
Uh... Is it weird?

Hikaru:
Kind of.

Tamaki:
Haruhi!

Kaoru:
Be careful, boss!
They'll see us!

Tamaki:
Why did Hikaru and Haruhi end up on a date, anyway?!
I don't understand!
How are yesterday's events even related to this?!

Honey:
You know, this might be Haru-chan's first date.

Tamaki:
Aah!
You're gonna pay for that!
And look at what she's wearing!
It's cute!
It's super cute!

Kaoru:
Ugh... I can explain...

Maids:
Good Morning, Miss. Fujioka.
Time to get ready.

Haruhi:
Hey!
What are you doing?!

Tamaki:
No fair!
No fair, no fair!
No fair, no fair, no fair, no fair, no fair, no fair, no fair, no fair, no fair, no fair, no fair, no fair, no fair, no fair, no fair, no fair.

Kaoru:
I know, Boss...
It’s hard for you to understand, but it would be good for Hikaru to find other people he can feel close to.
The only people we've ever been able to depend on are ourselves.
We didn't care what anyone else thought about us.
That's probably how we ended up so self-centered.

Tamaki:
So you're admitting it?

Kaoru:
I guess you could say Hikaru is immature and lets his emotions take over.
See, I'm not sure he's even aware of it, but I can tell that he cares about Haruhi.
He just doesn't know how to react, so his emotions run wild.
He's selfish and wants all of her attention.

Hikaru:
Are we or aren't we?!

Kaoru:
He wants to be acknowledged by her but doesn't know how to make that happen.
If you want true friends, friends who aren't only your toys, you have to learn to respect them.
That's the only way you can have a meaningful relationship.
And I think it's about time that Hikaru learned that lesson himself.

Tamaki:
Kaoru, that was amazing.

Kyoya:
So in other words, this date is basically a test to see if Hikaru can handle being thoughtful to one's others, right?

Kaoru:
Just promise me you won't interfere with them, okay?

Tamaki:
Fine, but then why are you making us follow them?

Kaoru:
Because!
There's no reason we should miss out on watching something this interesting.

Hikaru:
So, where do you wanna go, Haruhi?

Haruhi:
Well, Kaoru said he'd plan everything, so I didn't really give it much thought.
Any ideas?

Hikaru:
Well, there's not anything that I need to do here.

Kaoru:
Be sure you show her a good time.

Hikaru:
I know, why don't we go to that outlet mall by the train station?
They've got cheap clothes there.

Haruhi:
That's cool, but do you need to buy some clothes?

Hikaru:
No, there's no way I'd buy my clothes at that place.

Haruhi:
Then let's skip it.

Hikaru:
What a pain.

Haruhi:
Everything looks okay now, but Misuzu said it might rain.
I sure hope there aren't any thunderstorms today.

Hikaru:
I never knew you were so into the weather.

Tamaki:
How could he call himself a host club member?!
This is the lamest excuse for a date I've ever seen!
I should switch with Hikaru!
I'll show her a good time!

Kaoru:
That would ruin everything!

Tamaki:
Get out there, Kyoya!
Act like a punk and pick a fight with Haruhi, so Hikaru will have to rescue her!

Kyoya:
Where do you dream this stuff up?

Honey:
Ice cream!
Ice cream!
Does anyone want ice cream?

Mori:
Bad idea.

Hikaru:
That was creepy.
That old guy kinda looked like Honey senpai.

Haruhi:
One ice cream, please.

Hikaru:
You shouldn't run off like that, Haruhi.

Haruhi:
I heard this place is famous for their ice cream.
Here, I'll let you have the first taste.

Hikaru:
If it sucks, then we're playing a penalty game.

Tamaki:
What a pretty young lady!
Here's another one for you, on the house!

Haruhi:
Thank you, sir.
Delicious!

Hikaru:
You're right, it is pretty good.

Kaoru:
What do you think you're doing?!
It was finally going well, you idiot!
What would have happened if they had seen us?!
You almost blew our cover!

Tamaki:
You think I'm gonna let them share an ice cream cone like a couple!?
That's indirect kissing!

Haruhi:
According to this, they're pickled yams.
Pretty weird, huh?

Hikaru:
Come on, pickled food is so lame.
Who'd want to eat that crap?

Haruhi:
Try it.

Hikaru:
It's not that bad.

Haruhi:
I'll take two bags of these, please.

Hikaru:
You're not supposed to buy souvenirs until the last day of your trip.
You're gonna be in Karuizawa for a while, right?

Haruhi:
These are a gift.
I'm getting them for Kaoru.
Hey, listen.
Do you think the others would be up for souvenir shopping tonight?
We could always come back to these shops later and pick out a few more gifts for Kaoru.

Hikaru:
I don't understand.
How can you tell that I’m upset about Kaoru?

Haruhi:
I just can.
Well, let’s go.

Hikaru:
Hm.

Kaoru:
We take our eyes off of them for a second and suddenly everything's great.

Kyoya:
That's true, but I get the feeling Haruhi's the one in charge here.

Honey:
It looks like the ice cream stand helped smooth things over.

Mori:
I doubt it.

Kaoru:
We should get going.
If we get caught, it's gonna ruin everything.
And anyway, I don't think the boss can handle much more of this.

Tamaki:
That looks like so much fun...
Lucky...

Haruhi:
Did you just hear something?

Hikaru:
What?
No, I didn't hear anything.
It does look like it's going to rain, though.
Think we should head back?

Haruhi:
Probably.

Hikaru:
Then, let's head to the street and hail a cab, 'kay?

Arai:
Is that you, Fujioka?
What are you up to?

Haruhi:
Hey Arai, I didn’t expect to see you out here.

Arai:
Well, this is my uncle's store.
You guys out doing some shopping?

Haruhi:
We were, but now we're about to leave.

Arai:
Yeah?
We've got a car that can take you back.
Just let me ask my uncle.

Haruhi:
Uh, well I don't wanna be a bother.

Arai:
It‘s no problem.
I wouldn't want you to get caught in the rain.

Hikaru:
Don't worry about it, we’re getting a taxi.

Arai:
Come on, don't waste your money on a taxi.

Haruhi:
Uh, hey, why don't we accept his offer?
The sooner we get home, the better.

Hikaru:
Well, I guess you'll be riding home alone, then.

Haruhi:
But, Hikaru...

Hikaru:
Just do whatever you want, okay!
You guys should catch up and reminisce, but leave me out of it!

Haruhi:
Wait!

Arai:
Not again.
Why's he so upset about you hanging out with an old friend?
I mean surely he's got some of his own, right?

Hikaru:
The two of us have been together since we were born.
So we haven't ever needed any other friends.

Kaoru:
Check out that lightning.

Honey:
I sure hope those two didn't get stuck in the rain.

Misuzu:
Tamaki dear, please try to settle down.

Tamaki:
I should go and look for them!
Uh-

Misuzu:
Hello, this is Pension Misuzu!
Oh, it's you Arai.
What is it?
What?
Haruhi and Hikaru?
Hm. Hm.
Thank you.
Hikaru should have his cell with him so I'll try giving him a call.
Good bye now.
Evidently, Hikaru left Haruhi in front of the produce shop and decided he'd head back on his own.
Arai said Haruhi took off after Hikaru and that's when it started pouring.
He was worried so he called to make sure they made it home okay.

Hikaru:
Hey, what’s up boss?
You've got great timing, think you can send a cab to get me?
I haven’t had any luck hailing one...

Tamaki:
You idiot!
I want you to turn around and start looking for Haruhi right now!
What kind of jerk would leave a girl out in a thunderstorm like this by herself?!
Now you listen to me, Haruhi is terrified of thunder!
Whenever she hears it, she gets so scared she can't even move!
Why don't you spend less time concentrating on your jealousy and worry about someone else for once?!

Hikaru:
What does he mean by that?
How the hell was I supposed to know if she never told me?

Haruhi:
I sure hope there aren't any thunderstorms today.
Did you just hear something?
Uh, hey, we should accept his offer.
The sooner we can get home, the better.

Hikaru:
There's no way I could've figured that out!

Haruhi?
Hey, are you in here?
Haruhi?

Kaoru:
You have to tell other people how you feel or they’ll never know.
And remember...
Whenever you care a lot for someone, Hikaru, it's important you pay attention to any subtle little hints they drop.

Hikaru:
I don't understand.
How can you tell that I’m upset about Kaoru?

Haruhi:
I just can.

Hikaru:
Haruhi...

Haruhi:
Hika...

Hikaru:
Sorry...
I'm sorry for running off and leaving you.
And for the things I said about your friend, Arai.
I'm so sorry.

Haruhi:
Thanks, Hikaru.
I forgive you.

Hikaru:
I'm sorry.

Arai:
What's up?

Haruhi:
Hey, good morning, Arai.

Arai:
I brought you a watermelon.
My Uncle's got the best in town.

Honey:
Oh Wow!
It's huge!

Tamaki:
It's certainly an impressive melon.

Arai:
Here.

Hikaru:
Thanks a lot.

Kyoya:
By the way, a question about your strategy.
Did you ever consider the possibility the date might go too well and those two might fall in love?

Kaoru:
Nah, it's still too soon for that.
Hikaru is kind of a dummy.

Tamaki:
Hey, come down here!
It's time for some melon!

Kyoya:
Well then he's lucky because our club is full of dummies.


Haruhi:
What's going on, Kyoya senpai?
You've never talked during the preview.

Kyoya:
Well, I make it a rule not to do anything if there's nothing in it for me.

Haruhi:
Next time, "Kyoya’s Reluctant Day Out!"

Kyoya:
The Ouran Host Club will be waiting for you.

Host Club Members:
We'll see you then.
