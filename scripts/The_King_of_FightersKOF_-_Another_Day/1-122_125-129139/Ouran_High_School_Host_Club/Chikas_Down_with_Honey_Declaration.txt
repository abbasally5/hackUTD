  Yasuchika:
Excuse me, are you a member of the Host Club?
Could you ask 3rd year student, Mitsukuni Haninozuka to meet me out here?

Haruhi:
Who, Honey senpai?
You sure?

Yasuchika:
Yes.

Honey:
Oh, look!
It's Chika-chan!
So, what's up?
You rarely come over to the high school like this to see me.

Yasuchika:
Prepare yourself, Mitsukuni.

Haurhi:
Hey come on!
Cut it out, you guys!
Mori senpai!

Mori:
Hmm?

Haruhi:
What do you mean "hmm"?

Renge:
Woah!
Did you see that?!
Honey senpai dodged Chika's preliminary attack!
This is gonna be good!

Haruhi:
What's going on?

Renge:
Honey senpai is able to fly through the air with such grace.
He's like a modern day Ushiwakamaru!
Woah!
Chika attacks again without even giving him a chance to regain his balance!
Incredible!
He dodged his attack and tripped him!
Neither of them is gonna give.
They keep flashing out with ferocious techniques.

Tamaki:
So, they're at it again.

Kyoya:
I wish they would have chosen a better location to do this.

Haruhi:
Wait!
Why are you guys so calm?!

Renge:
Now things are getting serious!
Chika's got a weapon!

Haruhi:
Hey!
No way!
The use of weapons should be against the rules!

Hikaru:
Woah!
He knocked him out of the park!

Kaoru:
This may be his first win!

Yasuchika:
I gotcha.

Renge:
Sorry, but I don't think so.
The winner of this fight is Honey senpai.

Mori:
Renge is right about that.
See?
He got you.

Yasuchika:
How the hell did he do that?

Renge:
In the heat of battle, Honey senpai was able to attack with his Shuriken before Chika noticed!

Haruhi:
He uses Shuriken?

Renge:
His attack has left Chika utterly defenseless!
What a great fight!
Can't wait for the next one till then!
See ya!

Haruhi:
Hey guys, I'm completely lost.
You wanna tell me what's going on here?
Who's that kid and why did he attack Honey senpai?

Tamaki:
What?
You mean you can't tell just by looking at his face?
He's Honey senpai's younger brother.


"Chika’s “Down with Honey” Declaration!"


Yasuchika:
The Haninozukas are a noble family.
We excel at martial arts.
We've combined styles over the years to create our very own method of fighting.
When we're away, we study karate and judo, but when we're home, we work hard to master the Haninozuka technique.
So, to make sure that we always stay alert, we've been taught that whenever two family members come face to face, they must engage each other in battle.

Haruhi:
I get it now.
They were fighting because their family makes them.

Tamaki:
Go on, Yasuchika.
We've saved you a yummy piece of cake.

Yasuchika:
Thank you, but I don't care for sweets.
Besides a basic principle of the Haninozuka technique is refraining from selfishness.
So to let myself indulge in sweets would be out of the question.

Tamaki:
But one little piece of cake isn't really going to hurt you.

Hikaru:
Hold on.
I happen to know of a sweets-loving overly pampered little loli boy who happens to be...

Kaoru:
The next head of the Haninozukas.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
And he's sitting right over there.

Yasuchika:
Let me just say, there's no way I'm ever going to recognize a dimwit like Mitsukuni as the next head of our family.
There's no doubts my older brother is strong.
But he lives a decadent life style and has failed to show any self restraint.
He no longer has the right to be called a Haninozuka.
I can't allow someone who arbitrarily quit the Karate Club only to become hooked on cake and stuffed animals to be the head of the Haninozuka family even if he is my older brother.
I've been meaning to make that clear for a while.
And another thing, Mitsukuni, I've said it before and I'll say it again, stay away from me at school, got it?

Haruhi:
Senpai, are you doing okay?

Tamaki:
Honey senpai, so what should we do with this cake?

Honey:
I'll eat it!

Haruhi:
I guess everyone has their own strange family issues to deal with.
So, you used to be in the Karate Club, Honey senpai?
I had no idea.
What made you decide to quit and join with the Host Club?

Tamaki:
Why did you just say the Host Club like that?
What are you getting at, huh?

Haruhi:
Well, no matter how you cut it, the Karate club is a much more reputable club than ours is, senpai.

Hikaru:
If you really want to know,

Kaoru:
We'll have to take a little trip down memory lane.

Hikaru:
It was long before the Host Club had been established.

Kaoru:
Listen up, and we’ll tell you the legend of Honey Senpai, the captain of the Karate club.


Man:
Oh, so the eldest son is in high school now.

Man:
I heard he has already been made captain of the Karate club, and he is only a first year!

Man:
That is Outstanding!

Man:
I know he’s a growing boy, but doesn’t he seem small for his age?
He may not be respected as head of the family if he stays that small.

Honey's father:
Mitsukuni, you are aware of what the others are saying about you, right?

Honey:
Yes.

Honey's father:
You must work even harder to maintain your self-discipline.
Completely cast aside all weakness and leniency, and take hold of your true strength.

Honey:
Right!

Tamaki:
From that day forward, Honey-Senpai tried his very best.
It was difficult but he worked hard.

Haruhi:
So, he spent more time working on martial arts moves?

Tamaki:
Wrong!
Well aware of what others were saying about him, Honey senpai worked hard to follow his father's orders.
He sealed away all of his cute possessions, so as not to seem weak.
Then, he decided to take on a hard and fearless disposition, that of a manly man.
However, it was obvious to everyone around him that his efforts were failing.

Girl:
Excuse me, Haninozuka, would you like me to get you a piece of cake?

Girl:
What are you doing?
He can't!

Honey:
No, thank you.
I don't like sweets.

Girl:
He is upset!
See what you did!
He was exercising self-control!

Girl:
I totally forgot.
I'm so sorry.

Girl:
He's trying so hard to resist!

Girl:
You can tell he is really struggling!

Girl:
Oh, wow, it's so touching!

Tamaki:
And so, the girls were so touched by seeing him resist the things he loved that their Moe senses went into overdrive.
Not long after that the Haninozuka fan club was born.

Haruhi:
What does any of that stuff have to do with the legend of the Karate club?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Let us explain.

Honey:
Okay guys, take a ten minute break!

Karate club members:
Sir!

Karate club member:
Hey, you know, Captain Haninozuka is such a strict and manly captain.
His technique is awesome and he always keeps us in line.

Karate club member:
No joke, he’s the best captain ever.

Karate club member:
For real though.
He's a super manly man.

Hiakru and Kaoru:
That story’s such a tear-jerker!

Haruhi:
You've gotta be kidding.
How's that a tear jerker?
Never mind,
Just tell me what happens, would ya?

Tamaki:
Why hello there, Haninozuka senpai.
I know this is kind of sudden, but I was wondering if you'd join a new club I’m starting.

Honey:
Aren’t you Suoh?
Tamaki, right?
You're from the middle school.
What kind of club are you starting?

Tamaki:
I can't tell you how happy I am you asked, Haninozuka senpai!
Come on Senpai, don’t you think it’s about time you start using your charming good looks to get more out of life?
Why waste your time fighting when you could use your cuteness to give solace to young girls with too much time on their hands?
With tons of stuffed animals, and all the cake you could want!
I promise if you join, we will always have plenty of sweets on hand.

Honey:
Really?
I mean no.
I don’t like sweets, so you can forget it.
And for the record, I don’t like cutesy things either.
No way.
Not into cutesy stuff, don’t like it, at all

Tamaki:
I don’t know much about martial arts, so please forgive me, but I was wondering, do you think you could tell me what true strength is?
I may be out of line, but hiding your true self and putting on airs doesn't seem any different than running away to me.
I would think that embracing the things you truly like, and being able to enjoy them is worth more than anything.
To just be yourself, I believe that’s what true strength really is.
I’ll be back to ask you again.
Please consider it, Senpai.

Honey's father:
What is it that you wanted to talk to me about?

Honey:
Well, there’s something that I’ve been a little confused about, father.
Can you please tell me what true strength is?

Honey's father:
I will show you my son, so you can experience it directly.
Come with me to the Dojo!

Tamaki:
It has been said that Honey senpai's father is the most talented fighter in the Haninozuka family's history.

Referee:
And, begin!

Tamaki:
If I remember correctly, Honey senpai had already attained his current level of martial arts prowess, which is quite extraordinary.
Well, am I right?

Honey:
Uh huh!

Tamaki:
Rumor has it the referee that happened to be officiating was Japan's Secretary of Defense at the time and he begged Honey senpai to never fight in public again, at least not at his full potential.

Haruhi:
And why would he do that?

Tamaki:
If the world ever saw Honey senpai's true abilities, they'd suspect Japan of possessing a weapon of mass destruction.
The secretary was afraid it might upset the UN and then they would take it out on all of Japan.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
How awful!

Hikaru:
So, Honey senpai quit the Karate club.

Kaoru:
And decided to become a member of the host club.

Hikaru:
All things considered, Honey senpai's behavior is too unconventional for even the Haninozukas to contain.

Kaoru:
So, because of that, his younger brother had a more strict upbringing.
One more in keeping with the Haninozuka standard.

Honey:
Sometimes I think Chika-chan hates me because I'm not following the family rules.

Tamaki:
All right, gentlemen!
Time for operation, Haninozuka Brothers Reconciliation!

Hiakru and Kaoru:
Hooray!

Haruhi:
I knew he was gonna say that.


Yasuchika:
All right, ten minute break!

Karate club member:
Sir!

Karate club member:
You know, Captain Haninozuka sure is a strict captain.
No matter how hard we try, it's like he’s never satisfied.
I really don’t think I can take it.

Karate club member:
Tell me about it.

Karate club member:
He’s a tough captain.
But he’s no one near as skilled at martial arts as his older brother, Mitsukuni.

Yasuchika:
You will not talk about my brother in my presence, do you understand?

Girl:
Look, it's Chika!
He's so adorable!

Girl:
Oh wow, he's so totally cute!

Girls:
Yeah, Chika is not bad, but he's no match for his older brother, Honey!
He's the cutest thing we've ever seen!

Yasuchika:
What are you idiots looking at?!
Get started with the next drill!

Karate club member:
But we’re still on our break, sir.

Yasuchika:
You’ve barely broken a sweat!
You bums don’t need a break!
Start working harder before you're all out!

Karate club members:
Sir!

Hiakru:
Well, so far it looks like a simple inferiority complex.

Kaoru:
He's always being compared to Honey senpai so that's why he feels such animosity towards him.
His older brother is more attractive, more popular, and a better martial artist than he is.
I think he's just letting his jealousy get the best of him.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
It’s totally normal and way boring.
We’re gonna go find something more entertaining!

Tamaki:
Hold on.
Come back here you two.
Why are you suddenly being so uncooperative?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Well, we thought there'd be an interesting secret reason they're fighting.
This is just lame.

Tamaki:
So, Honey senpai and Chika's feelings aren't exciting enough?!

Honey:
It's okay, Tama-chan, really.

Tamaki:
But, Honey senpai...

Honey:
It’s alright.
Don’t worry about me.
So what if Chika-Chan hates me?
I would be happy just seeing him grow up to be strong and healthy.
He is my brother after all.

Kaoru:
Umm, he's already a lot taller than you, Honey senpai.

Hikaru:
Yeah, he's pretty grown up and plenty healthy.

Yasuchika:
Excuse me, could you guys please keep it down?
What are you doing here?
I thought I had told you to stay away from me at school, Mitsukuni!
You alien, would you just leave me alone?

Honey:
But, Chika-chan...

Hikaru and Kaoru:
What's he mean alien?

Haruhi:
Why would you call him that?
Just because your brother is stronger than you are doesn't give you the right to call him an alien.

Tamaki:
Yeah, why are you so upset about cake and stuffed animals?

Yasuchika:
Well, if it was just about the cake and stuffed animals, I would never've said anything.
Let's get this straight.
I didn't call my brother an alien because he's stronger than me.
Have any of you ever seen him devour an entire cake?!
Don't tell me you guys think that's perfectly normal!
He has three whole cakes every night for dessert!
Seriously, three cakes a night!
And he never gains weight!

Honey:
I humbly accept this yummy dessert.
That was delicious.

Tamaki:
So, Honey senpai eats that way at home too...

Yasuchika:
And then something crazy occurred last week.
I happened to wake up in the middle of the night and I noticed that the light was on in the dining room.

What’s going on?
It’s the middle of the night, you know.

Honey:
Hey Chika-Chan.

Yasuchika:
No way...
He's eating cake at this hour...

Honey:
I'm glad you're here.
Once a week, I have a special cake night where I eat all the cake I want.
Usa-chan here helped me to come up with the idea.
Would you like to join us?

Yasuchika:
Come on, be honest...
You know there's no way that a regular human being can eat that much cake!
Aren't you terrified?!
I bet he gets signals from his home planet through that weird bunny of his!
Why can't you see that he's an alien?!

Haruhi:
When you think about it...

Tamaki:
Everything Chika just said to us...

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Suddenly makes perfect sense, doesn't it?

Yasuchika:
I don't know though...
There was a time when Mitsukuni and I got along really well.
While it's true that my Brother has always had a fondness for cute things and more of a sweet tooth than I have, I still respected his ability to avoid that stuff even though he loved it.
And then this idiot came along and brainwashed him with some ridiculous nonsense, something about acknowledging who you really are and just being yourself.
That that's true strength.
Not long after that he fell apart and became the alien he is today!

Hikaru:
Oh, I see.
So all of Chika's troubles...

Kaoru:
can be traced right back to you.
Isn't that true, Boss?

Tamaki:
What are you talking about?!
I did'nt mean to!
There's got to be someway we can fix this!
Come on, you guys!

Mori:
There is a way to solve this, you know.

Tamaki:
You've got it figured out?

Mori:
So Mitsukuni, you know what to do.

Honey:
Listen Chika-chan.
I never meant to upset you.
I didn't know that you hated sweets that much and I'm very sorry.

Haruhi:
Oh no.
Looks like he missed the point completely...

Honey:
Nobody can make me change who I am and I'm really grateful to Tama-chan and all of the Host Club because they've shown me that.
So... let's settle this like men in the Haninozuka style, Yasuchika.


Haruhi:
Since when does Ouran have a field like this?

Honey:
And don't forget Chika-chan.
This is a 1 point match.

Yasuchika:
So what happens if I win?

Honey:
If you win, I'll stop eating cake in the middle of the night.

Yasuchika:
All right.

Mori:
Are you ready for battle, men?
Then, you may begin!

Tamaki:
Is it just me or is this fight turning out exactly like the one they had earlier?

Kyoya:
Yes, but this time, their roles are reversed.

Mori:
Mitsukuni's already planned how this entire fight will pan out.
Yasuchika will attack with his shuriken any moment now.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Woah, he called it!

Haruhi:
Uh Mori senpai, where do they hide these Shuriken?

Mori:
I have been watching these two brothers spar for many years, and it didn't take long before I noticed that in every match Yasuchika incorporates moves that Mitsukuni used in the previous match.
Mitsukuni realized it as well, and he always tries to give his brother the opportunity to practice those new techniques.
He may call him an alien, but as far as martial arts are concerned, Yasuchika has a deep respect for Mitsukuni and his abilities.
I think all he really wants is to be like his older brother.
They are connected just as two siblings ought to be and personally I think a little sibling rivalry is perfectly normal.
There's no need to worry about the outcome of this match.
I can already tell you that Mitsukuni is planning to throw the fight and let Yasuchika beat him.
Trust me.
I know everything there is to know about him.

Honey:
Defend yourself!
Yay!
I'm the winner!
Cake! cake! cake!
I have an idea!
Since I won, I think we should start having special cake night 3 times a week!!

Tamaki, Hikaru and Kaoru:
Don't let you get you down, Mori senpai.

Haruhi:
So, Honey senpai's love of cake exceeds his love for his brother.
Man, he's a horrible person...

Tamaki:
I would think that embracing the things you truly like, and being able to enjoy them is worth more than anything.
To just be yourself, I believe that’s what true strength really is.

Honey:
I love you!


Tamaki:
What?!
The Zuka club from Lobelia academy's kidnapped Haruhi!
Don't worry, Haruhi!
I'm on my way to save you, right this minute!

Haruhi:
Next time, "Lobelia Girls’ Academy Strikes Back!"

Tamaki:
Until then, the ouran host club will be waiting for you.

Host club members:
We'll see you then.
