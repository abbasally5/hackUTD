  Kirimi:
There might be a big nasty monster out here.
I better hurry up and try to find my big brother.
My big brother is a strong handsome prince, so I'm sure he'll be able to defeat a monster for me.

Host club members:
Welcome!

Tamaki:
Oh my, what an unusually young guest!
Well, glad you're here... my little lost kitty cat.

Kirimi:
When I opened the door, the police were there waiting for me!


Haruhi:
"Big Brother is a Prince!"


Tamaki:
Little Kitty Cat, why have you come to see us today?

Kirimi:
It's a reverse harem!
This is a reverse harem!

Tamaki:
That can't be right.
I must have heard wrong.
Maybe there's still some water in my ear from when I went swimming.

Hikaru:
Water in the ear, that's gotta be it.

Kaoru:
I'm sure we just heard her wrong.
There's no way this cute little girl said the words, reverse harem.
Something's going on with our ears.

Kirimi:
There is debauchery here.
Yay!
There's debauchery here, isn't there?
You're the glasses character.
You are the boy lolita and the stoic type.
Twincest.
And the bookworm.
Big brother?
My brother's blond! You must be him!

Hikaru:
You never told us about this!

Kaoru:
Since when do you have a little sister?

Tamaki:
I don't!
I'm definitely an only child... at least as far as I know.

Honey:
The more I look at you, the two of you do look a lot alike.
You are both blond after all.

Kyoya:
I want to know if glasses character's superior to big brother.

Haruhi:
But does it really matter?
I can't believe she called me "bookworm".

Tamaki:
Excuse me, you want to tell me your name, little one?

Kirimi:
Kirimi!

Haruhi:
Kirimi?

Tamaki:
Kirimi-chan, I'm afraid you've made a mistake.
I'm really sorry, but I don't have a younger sister.

Kirimi:
Are you sure?!
You're blond just like me!

Tamaki:
Oh, that's true.
I give in!
As of this moment, I'm your new big brother!!
You're so cute!!

Haruhi:
I know you get carried away by emotion. But don't you think it's irresponsible to make such empty promises?

Tamaki:
Don't you listen to that mean Haruhi!
I'm not irresponsible!
Come on with me!
I'll look after you!

Haruhi:
What do you think we should do, Kyoya senpai?

Kyoya:
We should probably try to find out if she actually has a brother at this school.

Umehito:
Kirimi... Kirimi...

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Hey, uh, who the hell are you?

Honey:
He looks like a foreigner!

Haruhi:
What's up with that?
How come the door looks different all of a sudden?

Umehito:
Oh, Kirimi.

Kadomatsu:
Master.

Kuretake:
You forgot your cloak.

Host club members:
Nekozawa senpai?!

Kuretake:
Master Umehito is terribly vulnerable to any kind of bright light.
For that reason, if he doesn't shroud himself in black, he will fall victim to the brightness of the outside world and will undoubtedly collapse!
And just to be comfortable, he even has to cover his beautiful blond hair with a dark wig.

Kadomatsu:
On the other hand, his sister, Mistress Kirimi, is frightened of dark and dimly lit places.

Haruhi:
So, this little girl is Nekozawa senpai's younger sister?

Kadomatsu:
You are quite insightful.
Yes, that would be correct, sir.

Umehito:
Kirimi... so this is where you've been hiding...

Kirimi:
Brother, save me from the monster!

Umehito:
Please don't be scared.
I'd like to introduce you to someone.
This is "Belzenef".
The Nekozawa family has worshipped cats for generations.

Haruhi:
You know, I get the feeling she's not scared of the puppet.
Call me crazy, but I think it's you.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
It's probably your clothes.
We'll help you change, okay?

Umehito:
No!
Don't do that!
It's far too bright!
I may die!

Honey:
I know.
We'll always just darken the room!

Kirimi:
Waah!
Don't do that!

Tamaki:
Don't worry, little one.

Tamaki:
Either way, someone's unhappy.

Kuretake:
It's a tragedy that these two siblings are such polar opposites.
As a result, they have come to be known as "the Nekozawa family's Romeo and Juliet".

Haruhi:
But Romeo and Juliet weren't brother and sister.
I think their situation was a little different.

Kuretake:
Oh I'm well aware of that.
To be honest, it's something I just came up with on the fly.
Pretty impressive, huh?
I thought it might make the story more dramatic.

Haruhi:
Oh, I see.

Kadomatsu:
We are sent by the Master's family to get our beloved Mistress Kirimi back home safely.

Hikaru:
Is the rest of the family...

Kaoru:
as out of tough as the three of you are?

Kuretake:
How dare you say such terrible things?
The Nekozawas are a distinguished family.
They're descendants of the Tokarev dynasty of Russia!

Kyoya:
Tokarev, huh?

Tamaki:
Wait, you mean Romanov, right?

Kuretake:
There's a legend that says once every few hundred years, a Nekozawa child is born, a child who's destined to be possessed by the darkness exactly like our Master Umehito.
That legend may or may not be true.

Honey:
What do you mean, may or may not be true?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Is it or isn't it?

Kuretake:
Mistress Kirimi fell in love with the handsome fairy-tale prince of an older brother she had seen in portraits.
However, as a result of his condition, the Master is unable to go near his sister without being shrouded in black.
Once she learned her older brother was enrolled in high school here, she decided to go looking for him.
That's what brought her to your host club.
We've tried to keep her comforted by reading her bedtime stories about princely characters like her brother, but we ran out of stories...
So recently, we decided to start reading her shojo manga that have princely characters in them.
And I'm afraid she's become completely addicted.

Haruhi:
Shojo manga?

Kirimi:
There is debauchery here.
Yay!
There's debauchery here, isn't there?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
[I/We] see, so that's where that came from.

Haruhi:
Is there really debauchery in shojo manga?
But, Sashimi-chan is so young.

Kaoru:
Not "Sashimi"!

Umehito:
It's "Kirimi"!

Haruhi:
So, Kirimi-chan doesn't know that you're her real older brother, Nekozawa senpai?

Kuretake:
Yes.
We've talked her, but she refuses to believe us.

Honey:
That's so sad.
Well, no wonder Neko-chan is so upset.

Umehito:
It's painful.
That's why, every night, I offer prayers and hopes that one day Kimiri will come to embrace... the darkness.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
I think you've got it backwards, buddy.

Hikaru:
You should try to get accustomed to the light.

kaoru:
What're you trying to do to your sister?

Kadomatsu:
Come along, Mistress Kirimi.

Kuretake:
It's time to go home.

Kirimi:
NOOOOO!!!! I'm not going with you.
I don't want to go home!
I wanna stay with my big brother!

Tamaki:
Nekozawa senpai?

Umehito:
Don't worry about me, Suou.
All I want is for my sister to be happy.
Make sure she gets the love she deserves!

Tamaki:
But wait a minute, senpai!

Kyoya:
Sibling relations are a source of problems in any family.

Haruhi:
Even so, I'm kinda jealous.
I grew up an only child, so I can't really relate.
But I can't imagine how touch it must be to have a sibling that's so different from you that you can't even spend time together.

Kirimi:
Is something wrong?
Tell me, big brother?

Tamaki:
I'm sorry, Kirimi-chan.
But I'm not the big brother that you've been looking for.
Don't worry.
He is still out there.
Believe it or not, you have a big brother that's even more handsome than I am.
And I promise you, he's a real prince.

Haruhi:
But senpai...

Tamaki:
Once she stepped foot into this room, Kirimi-chan became a guest of the host club.
And it's our job to make all our guests happy.
It's an absolute tragedy to see a brother and sister at odds this way.
We have to do something to help them!
Starting now, "Operation, change Nekozawa senpai into the princely character of Kirimi-chan's dreams" is underway!

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Are you serious?

Kadomatsu:
But, sir...

Kuretake:
You want to change Umehito from a prince of darkness to a prince of light.
I don't know if that's even possible.

Haruhi:
Senpai! Quit getting carried away by your emotions!
Don't make promises you can't keep.

Tamaki:
"Oh ye of little faith".
Have you forgotten that we have an expert on our side?
Someone who knows the importance of changing characters.

Hikaru:
You don't think...

Kaoru:
he's talking about...

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Yeah, sure enough.


Umehito:
Your golden locks glow in the candlelight.
Your skin like ivory.
Your smile, mysterious as a flower illuminated by the moonlight.
Such beauty, it's as if... you're a cursed wax doll! Shrouded in darkness and filled with malevolence!

Renge:
No way!
You've got it all wrong!
Numbskull!
Who told you to say something like that!?
How many times do I have to tell you!?
You're not allowed to use any occult terms!

Umehito:
I'm really sorry.
But, my vocabulary is a bit limited without those words.

Renge:
You're not allowed to talk back to me either.
You got it?
A princely character would never try to come up with a sissy excuse like that!
Remember, it's okay to have a dark side.
Some girls like that.
Cute fruity male characters always go over well with young girls.
However, referencing anything related to the occult is out of the question!
Mori senpai, go ahead and add that to the board.

Mori:
"Wax... doll..."

Kyoya:
Looks like Renge is really on top of things.

Honey:
Yeah, she's on a roll.

Hikaru:
But I'm not sure the lines she's feeding him are appropriate to use on a sister.

Kaoru:
You're just going to sit and watch, boss?

Tamaki:
Of course.
I don't wanna end up with a curse on me.

Renge:
Okay, it seems that you've memorized most of your new character lines.
I think it's about time we moved on.
Are you ready, senpai?

Umehito:
Oh, please no!
It's too soon!!
I can't handle it yet!

Renge:
Evil beam!!

Don't let a simple flashlight get the best of you!
Work up your nerve!
It's not physically affecting you.
So that means it must be psychological!
Even Edgar was able to face the cross once he built up his courage.

Umehito:
But I thought you rejected the occult.

Renge:
Occult fiction is good.
Occult fashion is not.

Tamaki:
Oh, is that so?

Hikaru:
Don't judge him!

Kaoru:
You're the one who's always wearing weird cosplay.

Renge:
You've gotta put your heart into the delivery of these lines.
You have to imagine that you're talking to Kirimi-chan.

Umehito:
That's easy for you to say, but that doesn't look anything like her.

Renge:
Would you quit complaining?
Look at her through the eyes of your heart.
The eyes of your heart!

Tamaki:
That's right.
Remember why you're doing this.
It's all for Kirimi-chan's sake.
Just give it a shot.
It'll look like her if you use your imagination.

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Here you go, boss.

Hikaru:
We got this one ready just for you.

Kaoru:
We think you should go ahead and confess your love to this Haruhi doll.

Tamaki:
Wait, this doll is... Haruhi?

Hikaru and Kaoru:
You should teach him by example.

Tamaki:
Ha.. Haruhi... I...

Haruhi:
Yes, senpai
Excuse me.

Tamaki:
Haruhi!?
You are the real one!
But when did you get here?

Haruhi:
Kirimi-chan came to the club room again today looking for you.
If you've got time to do disgusting things like this, surely you can spare some time to hang out with her for a while.

Tamaki:
[Horrible.]
Disgusting?

Kyoya:
Why don't you keep her company, Haruhi?
What's wrong?
Don't you like children?

Haruhi:
Well no, it's not that I don't like them or anything.

Kirimi:
Read more, bookworm!

Haruhi:
"I've finally made all these fine men my loved slaves."
"Oh my, who shall I pick to have entertain me this evening?"
She's made me read about 50 volumes of shojo manga to her over the last 3 days.
And to my surprise, those things really are full of reverse harems and debauchery.

Kirimi:
Big brother?
This room is dark and scary!

Haruhi:
Oh, Kirimi-chan.
I asked you to wait for me in the other room.

Tamaki:
What's wrong, little one?
There, there, calm down.
You see?
There is nothing to be afraid of.
Here we go!

Renge:
Senpai?

Umehito:
I am a handsome, princely big brother!
I am a handsome, princely big brother!
I am a handsome, princely big brother!
I am a handsome, princely big brother!
I am a handsome, princely big brother!
I am a handsome, princely big brother!
I am a handsome, princely big brother!
And I'm not afraid of this flash light!
Self evil beam!!

Honey:
He did it!

Renge:
Nekozawa senpai's come a long way.
He is able to shine a flashlight in his own face!

Hikaru and Kaoru:
Bravo, senpai, bravo.

Haruhi;
Good job.
I'm impressed.

Tamaki:
You did it!
Your little sister is going to be so thrilled.
Look there, Kirimi-chan.
That gentleman is your real big brother.

Kirimi:
Big brother!

Umehito:
Kirimi!

Haruhi:
You're just complicating things.
Could you please cut that out?
It's not gonna help, you know.

Tamaki:
Huh?
Did you just say something?

Haruhi:
Never mind.

Umehito:
Kirimi!
Kirimi, wait!

Hikaru:
So, I guess shining the flashlight in his face...

Kaoru:
scared and sent her running.

Umehito:
Oh, Kirimi.

Tamaki:
Nekozawa senpai?

Umehito:
I've had enough.
Even if I continue the special training, there's no guarantee that Kirimi will ever accept me...
I think she'd be better off if you acted as her brother in my stead, Suou.

Tamaki:
But that's ridiculous.
You're the big brother she is looking for.
If you care about her, you will do whatever takes to win her over.

Hikaru:
Hey, look.
Kirimi-chan hasn't made it out of the courtyard.

Kaoru:
But there's something down there with her.
Oh, it's just a cat.

Hikaru:
Your family sure does love cats.

Kaoru:
Even strays warm up to you guys.

Umehito:
What did you say?
They're revered by our family, it's true.
But Kirimi wouldn't participate in something like that.
Something as occult as befriending a stray cat.
Kirimi is afraid of animals and cats are the creature(s) she fears the most!
Kirimi!!

Tamaki:
Nekozawa senpai!

Haruhi:
But he's not wearing his black cloak!

Kirimi:
Someone, help.

Umehito:
Kirimi!
Kirimi!

Kirimi:
Big brother!

Honey:
Would you look at that?

Renge:
This is all thanks to my special training.

Umehito:
There is no need to be afraid, Kirimi.
I promise it won't come anywhere near you now, all right?
His name is "Belzenef".
With this puppet's power, I can... curse...

Tamaki:
Nekozawa senpai...

Hikaru:
He probably got more sun that he ever will again in that one day.

Honey:
That may be true.
But he immediately went running for the darkness again..

Kaoru:
Yeah, we should have known.
What a waste.
He's back to wearing all those black clothes again.

Haruhi:
But even so.

Kirimi:
Now I know that if a monster ever appears, I'll be just fine.
I have a princely big brother who will fight to protect me, even if it means dashing out under the sun light, the one thing he fears most of all.


Honey:
I love sweets!

Haruhi:
Be careful, Honey senpai!
You're gonna end up with cavities.

Honey:
Ow!

Haruhi:
See?
What I just tell you.

Mori:
This is my fault.

Haruhi:
Next time, "Honey's Three Bitter Days!".

Tamaki:
The ouran host club will be waiting for you.

Host club members:
We'll see you then.
