Hinaichigo:Hina really really loves when tomoe combs out hair like that.

Tomoe:There, all done.

Hinaichigo:Thank you Tomoe!

Tomoe's Mom:Tomo, you'll be late for school.

Tomoe:OK, mom.

Hinaichigo:Do you have to go to school?

Tomoe:Yeah. I'll be home by dinner, hina. so, how about we play together when I get back. OK?

Hinaichigo:You have to promise. A promise between us. It's a promise you have to keep no matter what.

Tomoe:I promise hina.

Nori:Mishimaya's cream puffs with sweet red bean paste. They are really popular right now. I bought them for you, Shinku. You look so cute when you eat.

Jun:Would you shut up and get out?

Nori:Let me stay a little longer. She's just so cute, and so mysterious too. I just wanna hug you.

Shinku:No touching! Nori.

Nori:Yes.

Shinku:Go and make some tea and make sure it's hot. Quickly.

Nori:Oh, right.

Shinku:There is no doubt you are siblings. Both of you are equally useless.

Jun:Ah, don't say that...

Shinku:Jun, close the windows for me. It is getting cold out.

Jun:How do I close 'em!? There is no window to close! Ughhhhhhhh! My windows were broken by a doll!

Shinku:Really? I haven't broken anything.

Jun:Now you're denying it. You little...!

Shinku:Honestly, you get so flustered. Stop snivelling and watch.

Jun:The window is as good as new. How did you do that?

Shinku:Do you really need me to explain that?

Jun:So now where do you think you are going?

Shinku:Some place where a lady can have a quiet cup of tea.

Jun:Hey, wait just a second. Eh... I'm only doing this 'cause you ask, not 'cause I'm your slave.

Shinku:Jun, open that door over there for me.

Jun:You're kidding me. Why do you wanna go in there?

Shinku:Never you mind. Just open the door for me. Such an odd table... I've never seen one like it. This room is small, yet I do enjoy the perfume.

Nori:Hey, what're you doing in here?

Shinku:Nori, I will be taking my tea right here today.

Nori:What... in here?

Jun:Shinku, do you know what a bathroom is? OK, this is a toilet. You sit down, and you poop! Then you flush. Got it?


Jun:Shinku, why are you hiding in there, anyway? No way! you are totally embarrassed! That's got be the cutest thing I've ever seen...

Nori:Who is it? Oh... hi Tomoe.

Tomoe:I brought over Jun's homework for today.

Nori:I'm sorry that you always have to do this but thank you.

Tomoe:I'd better get going now.

Nori:Do you wanna come in and have some tea?

Tomoe:Thanks but I've got stuff to do... Ah...

Nori:Tomoe!

Tomoe:I'll be OK in a second.

Nori:Come inside.



































 Jun:
 Oh, that hurts. OK, Shinku. Where the heck are you, anyway?
 She comes and goes like she owns the place.

 Tomoe:
 I'm sorry if I was any trouble.

 Nori:
 Everything OK?
 Oh Jun-kun, I didn't...
 Ah, Tomoe.

 Tomoe:
 Thank you again for having me.

 Nori:
 Hey, you don't have to go.
 Jun-kun...

 Shinku:
 Come out please, Holie.
 I have a small task for you.

 Nori:
 Hey, Shinku. Do you got a sec?
 I was thinking, maybe you could stay in my room tonight.

 Shinku:
 Why, Nori?

 Nori:
 Well, Jun sorta gets in this mood every now and then.
 He'll stay in his room that way for a couple of days.

 Shinku:
 I see.

 Nori:
 I heard somewhere it's better just to leave him alone until he walks down on his own.
 So, OK?

 Shinku:
 I really don't mind at all.
 However, do you think it's the right thing to do?




 Hinaichigo:
 Liar! Tomoe is a big fat liar!
 You promised Hina you come home by dinner.
 You promised you play with Hina.
 You made a promise and you told Hina you'd keep it no matter what.

 Tomoe's Mom:
 Tomo, could you come here for a minute?

 Tomoe:
 Coming Mom.

 Hinaichigo:
 You going?

 Tomoe:
 I need to go help my mom, but I'll be back.

 Hinaichigo:
 Liar! The other girl said the same thing!
 She said she'll[d] be right back and then locked Hina in the box for a long, long, long time.

 Tomoe:
 I'd never do that to you Hina, OK?

 Hinaichigo:
 No! No more being alone. Let's be together forever... forever and ever.

 Tomoe:
 Hinaichigo...

 Hinaichigo:
 Come. Let us go together. Come.

 Tomoe:
 No... Hinaichigo...

 Tomoe's Mom:
 Tomo. Tomo? Tomo?




Nori:
But it's said it's necessary to leave them alone sometimes.
Huh, what was that?
Could it really be a... Was that a shooting star?
I wish Jun will get better. (x3) Huh?

(TV show)

Shinku:
 Window? Honestly, can't you handle that yourself?
 Anyway, how was it?

Nori:
Shinku!
Did a shooting star come flying by... Ah!
Wait! Please I just want one wish!
Please! Just give me one simple wish. That's all I ask!
Wait!

Shinku:
 Nori. Do you happen to have a large mirror in the house?

Nori:
A mirror?

Shinku:
 I should be able to use this.

Nori:
Use it?

Shinku:
 There are some objects that have fragments of life in them.
 And there are others that are lifeless.
 I can tell that this mirror have some life to it. Yes indeed.

Nori:
Sorry but when it comes to physics, I'm sort of slow... Oh I got it, that's Engel's coefficient law, oh yeah.

Shinku:
 I'll be going now.

Nori:
Huh? Where are you going? You're going alone?

Shinku:
 There's no need to worry.
 Without my medium, I can only stay away for 30 minutes at best.

Nori:
Shouldn't you tell Jun?

Shinku:
 It is better to leave him alone, is it not?

Nori:
I guess so.
I don't know. That's what the books said to do so.

Shinku:
 Nori.
 Your book will never understand the way Jun is feeling.
 You are the one who truly understands him.
 And although he seems a little lost right now, eventually he will find his way on his own.

Nori:
I guess...

Shinku:
 Just stay by his side, and be there for him.
 Children who feel like they're all alone in the world sometimes loose side of themselves.
 And if you leave them alone for too long, there'll be no turning back.

Tomoe's Mom:
Tomo. Tomo?

Tomoe:
Mom's calling me.
Hinaichigo, please. I wanna go back to my room now.

Hinaichigo:
But you just got here. You hate being with Hina, don't you?

Tomoe:
That's not true, Hina. That's not it, I just...

Hinaichigo:
Tomoe, don't go... Nooooo!

Tomoe:
Not again.

Hinaichigo:
You can't run away. I won't let you run away 'cause you promised Hina you'd stay with her.
Now we'll be together.

Tomoe:
What? My, my clothes...

Hinaichigo:
Tomoe? Let's play. Tomoe?

Tomoe:
No, I don't wanna play.

Hinaichigo:
Come on Tomoe. Let's play.

Shinku:
Hold it right there.

Hinaichigo:
Who said that?

Shinku:
 It's been a long time, Hinaichigo.

Hinaichigo:
It's Shinku.
Yay, you came to play!
Shinku's gonna play with Hina and Tomoe!

Shinku:
 Not quite.
 Honestly, I simply cannot function with all the [clatter/clutter] Nori made me bring.
 I have come here to play the Alice game with you.

Hinaichigo:
I won't wanna play the Alice game.
I don't that right now.

Shinku:
 Oh, and why don't you?

Hinaichigo:
Hina wants to play some more with Tomoe.

Shinku:
 Fine. But you must win the game first.
 The Alice game is a game where we fight for each other's Rosa Mysticas.
 Whoever loses becomes an ordinary doll, one which can neither speak nor move.
 And the winner comes one-step closer to becoming Alice.
 It is our fate as Rozen Maidens to play this game to the very end.
 Do you think you have the confidence to win?

Hinaichigo:
You are a big meanie. Shinku is a meanie.

Shinku:
 I see you haven't grown up at all.
 Still crying and whining as always.
 That is why you end up alone.

Hinaichigo:
I'm not crying! You can just go away. You can just go away...
You could become flat as a pancake for all I care!

Jun:
 It's hot.
 And if the ring's getting this hot, then now I bet that Shinku's fighting with another weird doll again.

Hinaichigo:
I'm never gonna lose the Alice game. Eh!

Tomoe:
Hinaichigo, please...

Shinku:
 Now it's my turn, Hinaichigo.
 Without my medium here, my powers would halve their strength.

Hinaichigo:
Whoa, Shinku... No way I won't lose, 'cause if Hina loses now, she'll also lose Tomoe. And that will never happen!
No way!
No. No!
I, I won?
Now I can go play with Tomoe.

Shinku:
 No.

Hinaichigo:
No, it can't be... but how?

Shinku:
 Look behind you, Hinaichigo.

Hinaichigo:
Tomoe. Tomoe!

Shinku:
 Hinaichigo, I think you've taken more of Tomoe's strength than you should have.
 Because of that, she will die soon.

Hinaichigo:
No, Tomoe... Tomoe, Tomoe please you have to open up your eyes now.
I promise Hina won't whine anymore, be the just spoiled little cry baby.
Please wake up. Please wake up...

Shinku:
 Hinaichigo. If you really want to save Tomoe's life, you know what to do.

Hinaichigo:
Tomoe...

Tomoe:
Hinaichigo...?

Hinaichigo:
I'm sorry Tomoe. Good bye.

Tomoe:
What?

Hinaichigo:
Shinku... You can have Hina's Rosa Mystica now.

Shinku:
 Let's not be too hasty.
 Whether I take your Rosa Mystica or not, is my decision to make.

Hinaichigo:
Ah.. But I thought. Without the ring, Hina doesn't have any powers.

Shinku:
 That is true.
 You are just a child who can do nothing.
 But there is one thing you can do for me.

Nori:
It's been thirty minutes.
What should I do now?
Uh, Jun-kun.

Jun:
 Shinku...

Nori:
What?

Jun:
Nothing. Don't even worry about it.

Shinku:
 Your book will never understand the way Jun is feeling.
 You are the one who truly understands him.

Nori:
Wait, Jun.
Shinku hasn't come back yet.

Jun:
 What do you mean? Where did she go?

Nori:
That's a thing. I don't really know.
She said something about the mirror in this room being a door way to some place.

Jun:
 Don't tell me she's inside the mirror.

Shinku:
 Jun.

Jun:
 Yeah, what do you want?

Shinku:
 You are late, Jun.

Jun:
 You can't just get up and leave without telling anyone!

Shinku:
 I believe that I did mention it to Nori.
 Besides, if you'd come with me in the first place, â€•

Jun:
 Whatever!
 Where's your ribbon?
 So she really was in a fight.

Nori:
Ah! What's her name? (x5) , huh?

Shinku:
 Her name is Hinaichigo. Starting today, she'll be my new servant.

Hinaichigo:
Hina doesn't like the dark.

Nori:
Oh don't worry, here we go. We're going.

Jun:
 Oh please, don't tell me that doll's gonna be living here too.

Shinku:
 But of course she'll live here. She is my servant.
 Naturally, she'll live and work on her promises.

Jun:
 Unacceptable. Unacceptable!

Shinku:
 Oh, look at the time. It's already three minutes past ten.
 Night time is for sleeping. Hurry up and go to bed now, Jun.

Jun:
 Hey, don't you brush me off.

Shinku:
 Good night, Jun.

Jun:
 Ah! Get out of the box right now, xxx!
 This xxx nervous. Hey, Shinku, Shinku. Open up!
