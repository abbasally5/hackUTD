Girl:Huh? What do you mean you don't have time today, Nori?

Nori:I'm sorry guys, but Jun is not doing very good these days.

Girl:I see. It must be tough...for you, too.

Nori:Let me know when you guys go next time. Bye, see you tomorrow.

Girl:Careful riding home, Nori. You keep forgetting to...


Nori:Nothing in here, either. Hey Jun-kun, I'm home now!

Delivery Person:Good afternoon! Package for you. Can you please stamp for it?

Delivery Person:Can you please stamp for it?

Delivery Person:Can you please stamp for it?

Nori:Jun-kun!

Delivery Person:I have a package for SAKURADA-san!!


Jun:Once you've read with the clause below and circled your choice... humm... Please place it in the second drawer of your desk. The aritificial spirit HOLIE will arrive from an alternate dimension to retrieve it. Euh!! Alternate dimensions and fairies! I have a feeling this is gonna be the bestest thing ever! Let's see...

Nori:Jun-kun...

Jun:I told you to knock before you come in.

Nori:Jun-kun, you got a lot of packages again. There's the voodoo doll, the gold and silver pearls of happiness, and I think these are X-ray specs.

Jun:Yeah, I've bought 'em all through mail order. Did I say you could open 'em?

Nori:Oh Jun, you gotta stop doing this. I'm your big sister and if you want something...

Jun:Heck no! I don't want some stinky outsider criticizing the one thing I like doing more than anything else.

Nori:I'm not an outsider, I'm your big sister.

Jun:Shut up and get out, blockhead.

Nori:But I..., I..., I saw on TV the other day, how about these catchy mail order places, and how these sometimes will be often...

Jun:I know that! Once they get here, I get some laughs out of 'em, and then I return 'em for refund just before the trial period ends. The thrill of it! The thrill of knowing that I just might get stuck with some piece of garbage. That's what's so irresistible.

Nori:But... Jun-kun...?



Nori:No! That's not true... I just think it's kind of wrong for you to do something like that. Anyway, I was thinking maybe a hobby like lacrosse would be a bit healthier. Yay! That's good form! You were born to play lacrosse, Jun... Ah! Jun-kun...

Jun:The packages in the living room. They need to get shipped out today, or I won't get my refund.

Nori:Hey,Jun-kun. Maybe you, could you maybe come down and start eating dinners with me again? I wanna hear about your hobbies and have fun conversations with you again. Maybe if you do that, you'll go back to school....

Jun:Get going, Nori! And mail those packages! I just really hate it when she totally [wounds/ruins] the moment like that. Oh, my shin... That hurts. Hey, what'd I trip on?


Jun:It's a ... is that a doll? Wow, it's big and it's really well made and it's soft. Underpants,, it figures. Should I wind her up? Why not?


Nori:Oh, it's just a neighbor's baby. I better hurry!

Shinku:You touched me without my permission. Honestly, human males are even more vulgar than I've ever imagined. And you, what is your name?

Jun:It's Jun, Jun Sakurada. Hang on a sec. Just who the hell are you anyway? You're a doll, right?

Shinku:My name is Shinku. I happened to be the fifth of the Rozen-maiden dolls.

Jun:A Rozen-maiden doll?

Shinku:What an absolutely filthy room. No.. this is not even worthy of me to live in.

Jun:What did you say?

Shinku:As reluctant as I am, I have no choice. And after all you did wind me up. That is how you answered Holie's query, is it not?

Jun:Who's Holie... Wind you up... You don't mean. Can't be. It's not here. Oh yeah, now I get it. You are a new superstitious sales scam. Yeah, it's an elaborate scheme. I bet you're remote-controlled or something.

Shinku:Don't touch me. Honestly, for a human who's lack of etiquette is quite appalling.

Jun:Huh!? Is this some kind of curse because I didn't take all those voodoo dolls and things seriously?

Shinku:Ah, perfect. I'd like to have a look at that doll.

Jun:Huh? ... You wanna see it?

Shinku:I do. Now lift me up.

Jun:'Kay, How's this?

Shinku:You're holding me wrong. Good. You hold me like this from now on.

Jun:Just what do you mean "from now on"?

Shinku:I can't reach it. Get it for me.

Jun:Okay.

Shinku:Oh, my! It's surprising such a splendid doll would belong to a human like you.

Jun:It's just an old voodoo doll... But she doesn't seem like a doll... She is soft. She talks normal. And even her face is human. No matter how you look at it, she's a girl.

Shinku:Yes?

Jun:Um... nothing.

Shinku:Here already? Honestly I didn't even have time to enjoy a cup of tea.


Shinku:Well, human. It is unfortunate. But I'm afraid that you are going to die now. If you'd rather not, then swear.

Jun:This is stupid. Do you really think I care if I die? If you think you are threatening me or something... I'm gonna die!!! I'm gonna die!!!

Shinku:Oh... Honestly, It only cut your clothing.

Jun:Damn it. Help me! Someone!

Shinku:This doll has come to kill you. So, human, I will only ask you one more time. Will you swear, or will you not swear?

Jun:I swear! Hurry! I swear! I swear!

Shinku:Well then, prove it by kissing the rose. Good boy, Jun. Good.

Jun:Hey, what the... It's... It's hot.

Shinku:You will endure it. You have become my medium now.

Jun:What did you just call me?

Shinku:I'm terribly sorry, but I need you two to wake up for a little bit. No mischief now, please. Poor little thing.

Jun:Does this mean I'm saved?

Shinku:And you owe it all to your dolls, Jun.

Jun:My dolls?

Shinku:Dolls choose their masters. They worked as hard as they did, because they wanted to protect you. I suppose that means you are not a bad human after all.

Jun:I have no idea what just happened here. What the... oh ..I feel so dizzy all of a sudden.

Shinku:Come now. I only used a small amount of your energy and you're already exhausted from it? What a disgraceful servant.

Jun:Ah.. what did you call me?

Shinku:You have sworn to protect me from this day forward. You have become my servant now. The rose ring is proof of your pledge.

Jun:No way, this thing?

Shinku:As long as you wear it, you will be my medium. All my power will be drawn from you through that ring. You'll serve as my intermediary just as you did earlier.

Jun:You were using my energy. Right. I ain't let you do that again. It's coming off.

Shinku:If you try to take the ring off, your flesh will come with it.

Shinku:Jun, this little one here is telling me that it's very worried about you and you apparently have a hole in your heart.

Jun:A hole? Sure he's not talking about himself? I mean.. Hey! Where are you going?

Shinku:Jun!

Jun:What's up, shorty?

Shinku:Go and make me some tea.

Jun:Tea Tea... Why do I gotta make tea?


Nori:I'm home! Jun-kun? Hey, anything wrong?

Jun:No.

Nori:I could have thought I wrote "Jun," but this thing is as "Jum", but I wrote "Jun"!

Jun:Do stuff like that all you want but you're wasting your time.

Nori:Jun-kun... But you did make it into the 8th grade. You know, when you get to be an 8th grader, you'll have more fun because you're not a freshman anymore.

Jun:It'd be nice if you just left me alone, sis. You know what they did.

Nori:Hey, that's not true, Jun. Mom and Dad just had to go overseas because of their works, you know that.

Jun:Whatever! No one tells me what to do! You got that? I ain't going to school, ever again!

Nori:Jun-kun...

Jun:Hold it! Just don't move! Don't even think it!

Nori:Ah! Jun-kun...

Jun:Go make a pot of tea! Right now! You got that?

Nori:First it's "leave me alone," now it's "make tea."


Jun:Just what did you think you were doing in there?

Shinku:I simply got tired of waiting for you.

Jun:Now listen here.

Shinku:Honestly, your behavior toward the lady was absolutely disgraceful.

Jun:Yeah, well, that's not really a doll's business, is it?

Shinku:You are a servant who dose not know how to speak appropriately. Perhaps, you fail to understand your current position, servant.

Jun:Oh, you just don't know when to stop, do you, dolly?

Jun:All right, here we go. I'll show you how terrible as humans can be! My eyes!! My eyes!!

Nori:Jun-kun, I've brought you tea. Here. Hope you like orange pekoe. If you don't mind, I was thinking I can join you....

Jun:There, happy now? Are you gonna drink it? You got your own cup?

Shinku:Aren't you having any?

Jun:Nori couldn't make a good cup of tea to save our life. Honestly.

Shinku:I see, the temperature is too low. The leaves are not fully open yet, it's lost its fragrance. Why this can hardly be called tea at all. However, it has a very gentle flavor to it, very kind. Jun, you are loved, do you know that? You would not understand if you've never tried to. How delicious this tea is, and how caring they are.

Nori:Hey, Jun-kun.

Jun:What do you want?

Nori:So...um... Is the tea good?.

Jun:Leave me alone.

Jun:Actually, it's not too bad, sis.

Shinku:You are a good boy, Jun. That was promising. Promising enough to cultivate at any rate. You should feel honored. I did choose you to be my servant after all.

Jun:I told you I'm not gonna be your servant or anything like tha--

Nori:Hey, Jun-kun. Who's that little girl?

Nori:Wait a sec, she is a doll, isn't she?

Shinku:And what is your name, please?

Nori:Ah! The doll talks! Nori, I'm Nori Sakurada. Oh, wow, she looks like a well-made doll. I know, this is one of those Western Dutch dolls.

Jun:No!!

Nori:It's okay. 'Cause I'd read in this book that adolescent boys are like that, and it also says at your age.

Jun:It is not a Western Dutch doll! Get out! Go on! Get out!

Nori:Wait, Jun, don't be embarrassed... It's just my mouth...

Jun:Honestly.
