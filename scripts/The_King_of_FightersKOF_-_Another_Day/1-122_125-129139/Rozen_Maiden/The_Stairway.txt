  Nori : I read the note you sent me, Yamamoto. You wanted to talk to me about something?

Yamamoto : Um, yeah well, Miss, Miss Sakurada. I, um er...

Nori : I'm sorry.

Yamamoto : What?

Nori : The truth is, after lacrosse practice today, I promised I'd go have cake with everyone back at my house. I'm kind of running late as it is, so, would it be OK if we talk some other time?

Yamamoto : Wha... Um...

Nori : I'm really sorry about this. Good-bye.

Nori : There, I better get going.

Nori : OK everyone, it's ready! Come over and get a slice.

Shinku : Silence, Nori.

Nori : Huh?

Shinku : Right now, we are at a very crucial scene.

Kun-kun : Oh, this is terrible! It's another body!

Captain : Kun-kun, what is going on with this case?

Kun-kun : Please calm down, Captain! Let us start at the beginning again. To figure this out, we must look at the crime scenes.

Shinku : Kun-kun is a genius.

Jun : Un.

Hina-Ichigo : You can do it! You can do it, Kun-kun. Hina knows you can do it.

Nori : Here you are, Hina. And one for you, Suiseiseki.

Suiseiseki : Thank you, Nori.

Hina-Ichigo : Strawberries in cake! Strawberries in cake! It looks so yummy. I just can't wait. Thank you for the yummy cake, Nori.

Kun-kun : Hold it right there!

Captain : What is the matter, Kun-kun.

Kun-kun : You must not move that body. Take a good look at the victim's neck.

Captain : Wow, those marks.

Kun-kun : Precisely it was wrapped and bound up.

Captain : Wrapped and bound, you say?

Jun : For a puppet show, this is hard-core. Kind of disturbing.

Kun-kun : In other words, this is a clever trick using wakame seaweed. The mystery is completely solved. And the culprit is...

Jun : Quiet!!

Nori : Oh Hina, what's wrong? Please tell me.

Hina-Ichigo : Hina's strawberry... cake...

Suiseiseki : Hina-Ichigo, you're so terrible. She goes and eats her strawberry before anyone else. And now she pitches a bit demanding my strawberry as well.

Nori : Ah, Hina, that's not nice. You ate yours already, didn't you?

Hina-Ichigo : What? N-No...But I...

Suiseiseki : Oh, fine then. If you insist on whining and carrying on like that, I will give my precious strawberry to that gluttonous little brat. Here, take it.

Nori : There, there, it's all right. That isn't gonna do Hina any good.

Hina-Ichigo : Stupid!

Nori : Oh wait, Hina. Oh Hina.

Kun-kun : Look for the resolution next time. See you again next weekun-kun.

Nori : Hina, please come down. Let's have cake together. I guess she's really upset. I wonder if she's gonna come down and have a cake. Maybe I was a little too harsh with her. Hey Jun-kun, could you go up and check on Hina?

Jun : Why do I have to?

Nori : I'm on my way out to the grocery store. I have to pick up something for tonight's dinner.

Jun : Well that's perfect. One less annoying doll to deal with. Let the little creep so.

Suiseiseki : Sometimes you say the most intelligent things, human. If we just leave her alone, she'll eventually return to civilization when she gets hungry.

Jun : Yeah, that's right.

Nori : NO! Unacceptable. We're gonna have a nice dinner together. Got it?

Jun : Yeah, that's easy for you to say.

Nori : I'm going shopping now. When I get back, if you guys are still treating Hina like an outcast, tonight's dinner flower-topped hamburgers will be canceled.

Jun : Flower-topped?

Nori : See you later.

Suiseiseki : We so must capture her immediately.

Jun : Hey, using nets and whips is not being nice to her.

Suiseiseki : If we drag her down from there and put the screws to her, everything will work out, you'll see.

Jun : That isn't being nice to her.

Shinku : Very well then Jun. You do something about this.

Jun: Jeez. Why do I have to do this? Puny-ichigo, where are you? Hey! Good. When she sulks, she really sulks. Come on, if you're gonna mope, do it in your case, not on my bed. Let go.

Jun: What the...Is that a barricade? Hey come on. How long you gonna keep sulking, huh?

Hina-Ichigo : This is Hina's territory now. Bad, bad, bad!

Jun : Wait, this is my room. Hey stop throwing my mini-cars. Hey! Aw...

Hina-Ichigo : Hina didn't do anything wrong. Hina's going on strike now.

Jun : Strike? You're kidding.

Hina-Ichigo : Whose side are you on, Jun? Are you with Hina? Or Suiseiseki? Which is it?

Jun : Now just hang on a second. I didn't see anything happened, so I can't really say.

Hina-Ichigo : You're my enemy too. Go away.

Jun : Hold on. I know I said I didn't see what happened. But stop. Come to think of it, her behavior has always been on a sneaky side. She probably would pull a damn stunt like this.

Hina : You're allowed to take one step into my territory, Jun

Jun: Your territory?

Suiseiseki : That puny human is certainly taking his sweet time. I swear that creature is no good no matter what task you assign him. Huh? W-What's that?

Hina-Ichigo : I declare that this territory is Hina and Jun.

Jun : How did it come to all this?

Hina-Ichigo : And you can't come up here so near.

Suiseiseki : What?

Shinku :We have a deserter in our ranks.

Suiseiseki : So you've turned traitor, huh? Damn you! You puny human, you shameless bastard, you sneak, you four-eyed brat!

Jun : Hey I don't have to take that kind of language from some creepy doll.

Hina-Ichigo : That hurts.

Jun : Aha! Don't you care what happens to this?

Suiseiseki : Ah, No my case.

Jun : Hahahaha. Proceed.

Hina-Ichigo : Come forward, commander. All done, sir.

Suiseiseki : Oh, what are you doing? Stop that at once.

Hina-Ichigo : Banzai!

Jun : Ha. Never underestimate a human.

Nori : Oh boy, I wonder if they're getting along. I'm sure they're doing fine.

Suiseiseki : I never dreamed the runt would defect to the puny runt side. It's beyond my calculations. Since it's come to this, I'm declaring all-out war. I'll show you what happens when I get angry, You'll both regret the state, I swear it.

Shinku : It seems we won't be having flower-topped hamburgers.

Suiseiseki : Puny Ichigo. Stupid Ichigo. No good Ichigo.

Hina-Ishigo : Hina did nothing wrong. You ate the strawberry. You meanie, meanie, meanie. meanie, meanie.

Suiseiseki : Lies. They're all lies.

Shinku : How childish.

Jun : Hey you. This started because you ate her strawberry. Go on admit it. Apologize to her.

Hina-Ichigo : Yeah, Apologize, you crook.

Suiseiseki : Why you so mean? Where's the proof that poor innocent Suiseiseki ate the strawberry? This is unbearable. I'm so being framed.

Hina-Ichigo : She lies. Suiseiseki is a sticking liar.

Jun : That little...

Suiseiseki : Both of them are picking on me because I'm a new comer here. Oh why are they so mean to me?

Shinku : Everyone's so juvenile.

Jun: This here alligator is also known as the "alligator of truth." If you're a liar and stick your hand in its mouth, it'll chew it right up. So if what you've been saying is really the truth, you won't have a problem sticking your creepy little dull hand in its mouth. Will you now.

Suiseiseki : How mean. What is that little runt trying to make me do?

Shinku : Well actually, it's a brilliant idea. Now then, place your hand in its mouth.

Suiseiseki : nnnnn No thank you. There's no need to take such drastic matches. I swear what I'm saying is the truth.

Shinku : Then prove it by placing your hand into the alligator's mouth. Here. Hurry up and do it.

Suiseiseki : Please Shinku, not you too.

Hina&Jun : Hurry up and do it.

Suiseiseki : Shut up conspirators.

Shinku : Well, get it over with.

Suiseiseki : I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It all happened so suddenly. Puny-ichigo was looking like such a dumb. I couldn't help but pick on her. I didn't mean any harm. Honestly I didn't. Someone please remove this alligator from my hand.

Shinku : How unseemly.

Suiseiseki : I can't believe you. You such a cheap tactic to force a confession. You ones are such deplorable creatures, deplorable.

Jun : Think she's mad enough now?

Suiseiseki : I will never acknowledge the confession you forced out of me.

Hina-Ichigo : Hina's never forgiven you either. I'll never never never forgive you until you apologize.

Suiseiseki & Hinaichigo : So, there!

Jun : You know she's lying?

Shinku : I don't care either way. Just hurry and resolve this. I'm starting to get hungry.

Jun : Well you could help out a little, too?

Shinku : No thank you. It's tiring.

Jun : Don't talk to me about tiring.

Nori : Hello Mr. Onion, hello Mr. Carrot. Hi there, Mr. Potato. Hello hello hello. Hello Mr. Strawberry, I think I'll take you home.

Jun : It's gotten really quiet. Just go down there and bury the hatchet.

Hina-Ichigo : I don't wanna. I'm not forgiving Suiseiseki until she apologizes.

Jun: Oh, goodie. Ah, ca-caltrops?

Hinaichigo: Caltrops are yummy!

Jun:Don't eat them, you idiot. Oh. They are just mapollo chocolates.

Suiseiseki: Attention rebel forces. Attention rebel forces.

Suiseiseki: We have seized control of both the kitchen and the refrigerator. So if you want any snacks or anything, you surrender peacefully.

Jun: She's captured all our food. That little...

Hinaichigo: Wow...

Suiseiseki: What do you think, Shinku? With the starvation tactic, it's just a matter of time.

Shinku: It is a sweet strategy.

Suiseiseki: This color, this luster, this aroma. It's just so irresistible. Now to enjoy it. How heavenly. And to think that I could have all I want to eat of these delicious sweets.

Jun: Ha! You actually think we'd fall for such a dumb...

Hinaichigo: Yummy!

Jun: Hey! It's a trick, can't you see that?

Hinaichigo: Candy candy candy!

Jun: How come you so obsessed with food? They're just dolls that crying out loud.

Suiseiseki: This is so delicious. Well, if you get down on your knees, apologize and swear life-long loyalty to us, then, I just might be allowing to share an itsy-bitsy bite of it with you. Well, maybe or maybe not, aha-hahahahahaha.

Jun: What a rotten little demonic doll. She is never gonna apologize. Oh, right Hina, plug your ears and ... booo!! Wait eating!

Suiseiseki: Argh, that sound is so dreadful! Uhh. Shinku! Can't you hear those awful sounds?

Shinku : Really, using styrofoam is such a childish tactic.

Jun : You like that? Even a creepy doll like you can't stand to hear this.

Suiseiseki : Human, prepare yourself for some pain. Ha! I'll fight your horrid screeching with a banging pan attack. Take it!

Hinaichigo : No, so noisy!

Nori : I sure bought a lot. Be patient, guys. I'll make you the best flowery hamburgers yet.

Girl : I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

Nori : Yeah. It's just a little water.

Girl : I'm really sorry about that.

Nori : No, really, it's okay. Were you watering the flower?

Girl : I water 'em all the time. I water 'em a lot. But only one of them's blooming.

Nori : Oh, no. You can't give 'em too much water because it's really bad for 'em. Too much water kills the seeds.

Girl: Huh? Oh, no.

Nori : I know! Wait here for me, okay?

Jun : Man, I'm so tired. My body's really tired. My head's really tired.

Hinaichigo : It's going bang-bang, screech-screech in my head.

Suiseiseki : Oh, my, I am so very hungry. I think I will gorge myself with lots of delicious snacks.

Shinku : Now, this is truly the sweetest strategy.

Hinaichigo : Jun, I'm so hungry. My tummy's growling so much.

Jun : Hey, Hinaichigo! That's right. She didn't eat her cake. If this war goes on any longer, she's had it for sure. So, it's come to this...

Nori : Sorry for the wait. Flower seeds anyone. I bought a hole bunch of 'em. You wanna help me plant her? You know, even little flowers are happy when they have lots of friends around. How about I plant these, and you can plant those, 'K?

Girl : OK.

Nori : Now there'll be lots of flowers. Won't that be cool?

Suiseiseki : They've been quiet up there for a while now. We should expect her surrender at any minute.

Shinku : I certainly hope so.

Jun : Hey, you guys, check this out.

Suiseiseki : What are they plotting?

Shinku : Kun-kun!

Suiseiseki : Huh?

Jun : Yes. She's taken the bait. Hi, Shinku. Thank you for always being supportive of me. It makes me so happy.

Shinku : Oh, it's nothing. Really, it's my pleasure.

Suiseiseki : What?

Jun : But to tell you the truth, it makes me a little sad to see you over on that side.

Shinku : What?

Suiseiseki : Snap out of it! Can you not see it's a trick?

Jun : To think that someone as wise and as brilliant as you are could be so blind to take sides with a villain. Ho! You disappoint me, Shinku.

Shinku : Um, oh, no!

Suiseiseki : What's the meaning of this? Stop it! If you try any more of your brainwashing tactics on her...

Shinku : That's not true, Kun-kun! That's not true, I swear! Listen, it was all... All of this mess was her doing.

Suiseiseki : Why?

Jun : Shinku, Shinku...

Shinku : No, Kun-kun, I was against it from the beginning.

Suiseiseki : No, just a minute here. How dare you feign your innocence?

Jun : Yes. Just a little bit more. Shinku, please, help me.

Shinku : Kun-kun!

Jun : The evil that has possesed you is hurting me. Hurting me. Help me. Come over to this side, quickly.

Shinku : Kun-kun!

Jun : Help me. Help me.

Shinku : Unhand me. Kun-kun is drying in pain. I'm coming, Kun-kun!

Suiseiseki : Shinku, don't be fool. It's all an elaborate trap.

Jun : I gotcha! Huh?

Hinaichigo : Kun-kun, look out, I'll save you!

Jun : Are you insane or something?

Nori : Oh no, look at the time! Everyone must be hungry by now. I'm home, everyone. Were you all able to get along while I... Eh... uh... You guys!

Nori : Here you are, guys. Since you are all able to get along, I made you flower-topped hamburgers, just like I promised.

Jun : Don't underestimate her. She's really scary when she gets mad.

Suiseiseki : She's so the true boss monkey of this house.

Shinku : You're not to be trifled with - Nori.

Hinaichigo : I'm really hungry to eat now.

Nori : Attention! Thank you for the food.

Others : Thank you for the food.

Shinku : So, has anyone seen Kun-kun?

Nori : Now, let's eat. Here we go. Watch your plait.
