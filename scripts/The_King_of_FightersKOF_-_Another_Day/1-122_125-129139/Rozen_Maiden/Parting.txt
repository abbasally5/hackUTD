  Suigintou:
Hmm, so this is what the inside of your dream looks like.
My-my, do you make a habit of not offering guests a cup of tea?

Shinku:
Anyone ill-mannered enough to enter another's dream without her permission cannot be called a guest.
Not to mention - using the powers you've stolen to barge in here is quite despicable.

Suigintou:
Oh dear, parden me. Perhaps I should've knocked first.

Shinku:
So, what brings you here?

Suigintou:
Shinku, I'd like to propose we have a battle for our Rosa Misticas.
A one-on-one fight naturally.

Shinku:
What are you up to?

Suigintou:
Come now, fighting each other is our purpose in life, remember?
To win the Alice Game once and for all, one of us must collect the Rosa Misticas from each of the sisters.
Of course once I've defeated you in battle, the only ones left will be the weak and helpless ones.
The same goes for you if you beat me.
Well, it would make things easier for you.
Of course I wouldn't be so uncouth to expect we fight right this second.
Tomorrow at midnight though, I'll be waiting - in the N-field.
You'll come, won't you?

Shinku:
As selfish as ever, aren't you now?

Suigintou:
For the opportunity to meet Father, I would do anything.

Shinku:
Very well then.

Suigintou:
Then tomorrow at midnight.

Shinku:
In the N-field.

Suigintou:
I'll be waiting for you, Shinku.
Please be on time.


Hinaichigo:
Yay! Jun-climbing!

Jun:
Get off me. You're so annoying!

Hinaichigo:
No, Hina's gonna play with Jun, play with Jun!

Jun:
Darn it. When did this place turn into a daycare center?
What a spasm.

Shinku:
Yes, Jun?

Jun:
I'm just thinking it's a little weird.
I mean, usually you get all mad and tell us it's too early for making so much noise.

Shinku:
True, however, a lively atmosphere is good on occasion.

Jun & Hinaichigo:
Huh?

Jun:
Oh that little...
Right in the nick of time!

Hinaichigo:
Wow!

Suiseiseki:
Good morning, everyone.
I knew [ you had / you'd have ] lots of time on your hand, so I came all the way over here to visit with you.
Hurry up and serve the tea, it's the least you can do.

Jun:
Did she do that on purpose?
I'm surprised if she did. Hmph.

Shinku:
Is it just you then?

Suiseiseki:
No, Souseiseki is coming too.

Student:
Miss Sakurada...

Souseiseki:
Oh, I'm sorry.

Suiseiseki:
Souseiseki, it's this house.

Souseiseki:
OK, be right there.

Hinaichigo:
Like this and like this and this and this and this and...
Oh I'll draw lots of flowers and turn Jun's room into a big flower garden.

Souseiseki:
The catering is excellent.

Suiseiseki:
See here, human.
We've so ran out of sweets.
Hurry up and bring some up immediately.

Jun:
You want anything, go get it yourself.

Hinaichigo:
Hina wants soft rice cakes with strawberries.

Souseiseki:
A cup of roasted tea, please.

Shinku:
And I'll have Darjeeling.

Jun:
I'm in hell.
We're totally outnumbered. There's more dolls here than humans now.

Nori:
Hey, Jun-kun. Please, I need your help.

Jun:
Jeez old weeds.
What do you want, Nori?

Nori:
Well, it's just that I ended up [a] sort of volunteering to [ being / be in ] a play at the kindergarten.
But I'm not really getting anywhere. We're rehearsing all by myself.

Jun:
Not my problem.
It's got nothing to do with me.

Nory:
Oh don't say that, please help me.
It's only for a little bit, I promiss.

Jun:
No way, Nori.

Shinku:
Jun. Jun, you should really try helping out more when other people need it.

Jun:
Wha...

Suiseiseki:
Yes indeed.
Go to work, [ you / ye ] slacking child.

Hinaichigo:
Hina will go to work too.

Souseiseki:
Do you even know what you're saying?

Jun:
All of you, shut up.

Nori:
Please help me, you're my only hope at doing this.


Hinaichigo:
Hi-ho, hi-ho, we're inside the forest here.
We sing and dance and laugh and prance with Snow White and everyday is super-fun.
There aren't really seven of us, but we're the seven dwarves.
Come on, Souseiseki. Smile smile smile!

Souseiseki:
Like this?

Hinaichigo:
No, you gotta smile big like this.

Nori:
Snow White, surrounded by all seven of the bright and cheerful dwarves, tried to explain why sh...

Jun:
Hold on right there.
You can practice all the narrator stuff on your own.

Nori:
Well yeah, but it's impossible to match up the timing stuff all by myself.

Hinaichigo:
But it's still Hina's turn.
And there she is. Snow White's here.

Shinku:
This is not fun.

Jun:
Well, you look more like the red-caped phantom than you do Snow White.

Shinku:
Your humor is nauseating.

Hinaichigo:
Oh come on, Miss Snow White shouldn't have a prickly attitude like that.
You have to laugh and sing with us.

Shinku:
Oh.

Hinaichigo:
Oh she's a little scary. When things get really hellish she'll help you out of a mess, 'cause she's a kind princess. She's fantabulous wonderful gracious magnificent Miss Snow White in red, la la.

Souseiseki:
Isn't that Shinku you're talking about?

Hinaichigo:
It doesn't matter. Isn't that right, Shinku?

Shinku:
This is not fun, but if I must.

Nori:
And so accepted by the lovable dwarves, Snow White led a happy life in [ a / the ] great forest.
Until the fateful day that evil old witch, who was jealous of Snow White's beauty, suddenly appeared at the doorstep with the basket of apples.

Suiseiseki:
I so do not understand.
Why would you cast Suiseiseki in the role of a mean old crone?

Jun:
Do you really want us to answer that?

Hinaichigo:
You're perfect!

Shinku:
I wouldn't think of casting anyone else.

Souseiseki:
Yes, I think the character suit you.

Suiseiseki:
Souseiseki, no! Not you too.
Well, right then.
If you all insist on it, I'll play her brilliantly.

He he he. If I can get Snow White to eat this apple, then I will be the first in the land. *sneers*

Hinaichigo:
She's scary!

Souseiseki:
What realistic acting.

Jun:
Hey guys, I don't think she's really acting.

Suiseiseki:
Hello there, my pretty.
Would you like to try one of these strangely delicious apples?

Shinku:
This is not fun, but I will take it.

Hinaichigo:
Oh no, what happened to Snow White?

Souseiseki:
Princess!

Suiseiseki:
Ah-hahahaha! It serves her right!
And now, the most beautiful woman in the land is I!
The one is only Suiseiseki!

Hinaichigo:
Hang on, Miss Snow White, open your eyes.

Souseiseki:
No use.
The witch has poisened Snow White.

Hinaichigo:
Oh, Shinku, don't! Shinku!

Jun:
Uh Hina you know, she's acting, right?

Nori:
At that moment, a value prince riding a white stallion happened to land.
To reverse the effects of the evil witch's poison and wake Snow White, the prince must kiss her.

Jun:
Well, I-I-I gotta kiss her?

Nori:
Mm-hmm.

Hinaichigo:
That's right, Jun.
You're the prince, so save her.

Souseiseki:
Hurry, only your kiss can save her.

Jun:
Hey, are you crazy?
Like hell I'm gonna do that?
She's a doll.
K-Kissing her is, kissing her is like, um, ...
What the hell did you kick me for?

Suiseiseki:
[The short-hand possibly in here / The short hit possibly ends here ], for I haven't had enough show-stopping scenes.
I feel that my character needs to have a battle with the prince in the second act.

Jun:
You're nuts.
You don't even know the story of Snow White and the seven dwarves. You don't care about the play writer's intentions.
You just wanna do whatever you want, you demonic doll?

Suiseiseki:
What was that?
I won't have any of your assess today, you puny four-eyed dead fool.

Hinaichigo:
Hina wants to fight too! Yay!

Nori:
Oh boy. The rehearse's a disaster.

Shinku:
Right, Jun. You missed your chance.

Jun:
What are you talking about?
It's not like I get anything out of kissing a doll.

Shinku:
Really. That's too bad.

Hinaichigo:
Aha, you let your guard down.

Souseiseki:
Shinku, what's wrong?

Shinku:
Nothing, why do you ask?


Jun:
Unbelievable.
Days like this if you like to taking through the whole house.

Nori:
Oh, everything OK?

Jun:
Why are they all, half-naked?

Nori:
What? I thought after running around like that, we should do some laundry.

Jun:
Just, well, if you're gonna do that stuff, lock the door.
I mean I'm a guy.

Hinaichigo:
Jun was all red up to his ears.

Souseiseki:
Why was he so embarassed?

Suiseiseki:
Well, it just means he's a kid when all's said and done.

Hinaichigo:
Huh?

Nori:
They're running your dress like one, so I'll wash yours last, OK Shink?

Hinaichigo:
Round and round and round and round it's spinning.
Look, babble babble.

Suiseiseki:
Oh, now you so damn it.

Hinaichigo:
Babbles everywhere.

Suiseiseki:
Hey, you stop that.
They are so on my nose.

Souseiseki:
What are they doing?

Nori:
It'll be a few more minutes until their laundry is done, then I'll be able to wash your dress.

Shinku:
What about Jun?

Nori:
Huh? Oh, he said he'd have tea in his room today.
So I took it to him a little while ago.

Shinku:
Tell me Nori.

Nori:
What?

Shinku:
Do you think it's all right if things stay the way they are?

Nori:
Not really.
I guess it wouldn't be good if I did.
Well then, how about another cup of tea?
He just needs something, and when he finds it he'll be OK.
I know that's a little take, I don't know what I'll say can do to help.
I feel so darn stupid and I hate it.

Shinku:
Well, you are right.
After all, you cannot make a proper cup of tea with water that is - lukewarm.

Nori:
Oh, I know my tea is no good, but when you say like that, it makes me feel worse.

Shinku:
Listen, Nori.
Tea leaves are very delicate things.
Each kind of leave has its own perticular method of preparation.
If you make a pot of tea using an incorrect method, you'll draw out the wrong essense of the leaves.

Nori:
The wrong essense?

Shinku:
Yes. I noticed you pour the hot water into a cup and then pour it into the pot.
Doing that cools the water, and as a result, the tea will not be flavable.

Nori:
Oh, then I shouldn't make it the same way as grean tea.
I didn't know that.

Shinku:
The difference is subtle.
For instance, it's considerate to warm a cup before pouring tea.
And yet, there are times when doing that is correct, and when it is not.
When you can see these subtle differences, I'm sure you'll understand.


Nori:
The laundry should be done now.
OK guys, let's go hang them outside and get Shinku's ...
What happened to the laundry...

Hinaichigo:
Babble! We're all covered in babble!

Suiseiseki:
And whose fault is that?

Souseiseki:
*sigh*

Jun:
What am I getting so worked up about, they're only dolls!
And they're incredibly difficult dolls in that.

Shinku:
What are you talking about?

Jun:
Oh, nothing.
What do you want? I'm busy.

Shinku:
The cuffs of my dress are about to come off
Mend them for me.

Jun:
Huh?

Shinku:
Nori said that if my dress was loaded, they were in danger of coming right off.

Jun;
Oh great.
But you know you coulda just asked her to do that for ya?

Shinku:
Honestly, what an annoying servant.
If you wish, I could always seal your mouth with a curse.

Jun:
Fine then. But that's all I have to do, right?

Shinku:
Exactly. Now please.

What is it?

Jun:
Nothing. It's nothing.
Just hurry up and give it to me. Come on.

Shinku:
You mean, please give it to me.
May I have something to wear?

Jun:
Huh?

Shinku:
Or shall I remain in my undergarments until the laundry's done.

Jun:
All right, hold on a second.

Nori:
Wow, isn't the weather perfect today?

Hinaichigo:
It's nice and warm.

Suiseiseki:
Hurry and kneel down before me.

Souseiseki:
I wonder what she's dreaming about.

Jun:
What are you looking at?
I mean this can't be all that intersting to watch.

Shinku:
Yes, it is.

Jun:
Well you're wrong, it isn't.

Shinku:
Yes, it is. Very much.
Those fingers must be magical fingers indeed.

Jun:
Huh?

Shinku:
One day you'll be able to sew a robe fit for a princess.

Jun:
Man, talk about blowing things out of proportion.

Shinku:
What have you been looking at all this time?
Are my balljoints really that interesting?

Jun:
Not really.
I guess while we're now I've sort of forgotten that you guys are all super-natural dolls.

Shinku:
When I wind down, this is what becomes stiff first.
And then, I become very sleepy.
And it's a very deep sleep indeed.

Jun:
Well then, does that mean you'll die?

Shinku:
No. When we wind down, we merely sleep.
However, if no one winds us back up again, we'd continue lying in our slumbering state and never awaken.
That's the kind of sleep, it is.

Jun:
That sounds kinda nice.

Shinku:
Why?

Jun:
By the time I woke up again, everybody who knew me right now would be gone.
I think that'd be sorta cool
Yeah, I wouldn't mind it if I never woke up again.

Shinku:
Do you think so?
Personally I think it's better to be awake than asleep.
To the Rozen Maidens, even though waking up means we have to do battle, when awake we're able to see and hear so much more than when we're sleeping.
And there's always the chance that you'll get to meet Father.
When you do, the Alice Game ends.

Jun:
So then you fight in order to end the Alice Game, huh?

Shinku:
Alice is a girl who only exsists within Father's mind.
A dream girl.
More noble than any flower, more pure than any jewel.
She's absolutely unspoiled.
A girl so beautiful so sublime that no girl in the world could hold a candle to her.
His constant quest to make a girl like that with reality resulted in him creating us, the Rozen Maiden dolls.
But as he made one doll, and then made two, no matter how many he made, it was no use.
It was no use, none of us measured up to Alice
But then, if one of us collects all the Rosa Misticas and wins the Alice Game, that doll will become Alice.

Jun:
That's such a sad story.

Shinku:
Is it?

Jun:
Sure it is.
You guy's a given life, and then you have to fight for a reason like that?
I mean, what the hell does he think you guys are, anyway?
I think it's sad.

Shinku:
I do not think so.

Jun:
Why?

Shinku:
Because - to live is to fight, is that not true?

Nori:
We can't do that Jun, 'cause you're my brother.

Hinaichigo:
All that running around tired me so, I'm really sleepy now.
What's the matter?

Souseiseki:
It's about Shinku.
She was acting weird today.

Suiseiseki:
Oh that one's always acting weird.
Even among the sisters, she's always been especially weird.

Souseiseki:
No, not like that.
She seemed like she was hiding something from us.
I could feel it.

Suiseiseki:
What?

Shinku:
Farewell, Jun.
