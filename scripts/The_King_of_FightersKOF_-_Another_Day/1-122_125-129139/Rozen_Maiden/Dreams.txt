  Jun: Shinku. It's morning.

Hina: Haaa. Good morning everyone.

Suiseiseki: I’m cringing at the thought of spending at another tedious day with the puny human. Ah.

Hina: Shinku still hasn’t say “Good morning.” to you yet?

Jun: No.

Hina: Shinku! It’s morning. You are gonna get a scolding if you don’t wake up right now.

Jun: She’s not waking up. You think… maybe she got hurt of something during a fight with that Suigintou doll yesterday?

Hina: Hina doesn’t know.

Suiseiseki: Huh. It’s clear to mean what needs to be done here. I would take Shinku’s place and make you both my servants. OK? You two, come along now.

Jun: There in no way and hell I’m taking any orders from you, you evil little doll.

Suiseiseki: And what are you getting so worked up about. Perhaps you prefer shinku after all.

Jun: No. Don’t be stupid. That’s not what I meant.


BoyA: Ah… This, here.

Nori: I’m really sorry, but the sign on the gate says “no sales man”.

BoyA: Ah…

Nori: Ahhh. Those door to door sales [ put a sheer interrupt / pitches sure are elaborate ]. (Alarm noise) Ah! Ah! Jun-kun where is the fire? Ah… ?? Oh, it was just a bunch of alarm clocks. I thought it was a fire alarm.

Jun: I know, you are dumb.

Nori: So, Shinku still hasn’t woken up yet?

Hina: No. What'll we do, Nori?

Nori: I’m sorry. When it comes to magical dolls, I’m afraid I don’t know anything about ’em.

Suiseiseki: Honestly, all of you are so completely useless. Leave me alone and don’t come back.

Jun: Listen, doll. If you know how to wake her up, then you'd better start talking.

Suiseiseki: Of course, I know how.

Jun: You sure about this?

Suiseiseki: It’s simple. When a doll’s medium is placed in a dangerous situation, the doll would not hesitate to save them. So, here it comes.

Jun: Don't do it. No, stop! Ahhh!

Nori: I don’t think she’s waking up, guys?

Suiseiseki: Huh, that’s really odd. Well, let's try something worse then.

Jun: I'll die! That'll kill me!

Nori: Huh, what’s this hole doin' here.

Jun: Oh, that’s right.

Suiseiseki: Damn it, you! Keep your mouth shut about such things.

Jun: Oh, you knew! You, rotten little doll!

Suiseiseki: Oh, thank goodness. She should wake up now.

Jun: The goodness my ass! Come on, hey wake up. Wake up already.

Hina: Shinku, she’s not waking.

Suiseiseki: Impossible. Shinku, Shinku. This so cannot be happening. What do we do?

[tv]

Kunkun: It’s time for another exciting episode of great detective Kunkun.

Hina: Kunkun, it’s kunkun. Shinku, look at. It’s kunkun. (panting)

Jun: What’re you doing?

Hinaichigo : If anyone can wake Shinku up, it's Kun-kun.

Jun : You mean...

Hinaichigo : Jun, you are the only one who can do the voice of Kun-kun.

Jun : Um... Hi, Shinku. Thank you for always supporting me. Actually, I want you to help me with an investigation. Won't you open your eyes? What might be the problem? Are you being threatened by someone? Is that why you're not talking? Or are you too embarrassed to say anything? Could that be it? Shinku?

Nori : Jun-kun...

Jun : We won't know if you don't tell us. What's wrong? Shinku.

Nori : Jun-kun, I'll try to come up with some ideas while I'm at school today, okay? Don't give up. We'll figure this out.

Jun : Look, just dropped already. We've got rid of one, and it's so already quieter.

Suiseiseki : You puny little human!

Nori : Don't worry. Jun's gonna do something about this. I'm sure. It's been a long time since I saw that look on his face.

Jun : Rozen Maiden. A set of dolls, said to have been created by the legendary doll maker Rozen. They are masterpieces that referred to as living dolls. However, no one has ever seen them, and there are doubts whether they even exist... No matter where I look, it's always the same old information. I know, I think I saw a site once. Does anyone know anything about the Rozen Maidens? Ugh, but they do exist! They're right here! Oh, man.

Hinaichigo : Jun, are you napping?

Suiseiseki : You really are a lazy good-for-nothing. Wake up, you lout?

Jun : What do you guys think is gonna happen to Shinku?

Suiseiseki : Huh? Well, she'll keep dreaming[. That's/is] all.

Jun : Dreaming?

Suiseiseki : It's what dolls do when they enter into a state of deep sleep. Born as dolls, there are the many encounters we'd had over time. There's our feelings for father, who lives in our deepest memories. And the darkness that descends upon us. The sleep is eternal. There is no death. We are enveloped in darkness, unable to move. Despare and hope, pleasure and pain, everything that she's ever experienced since she was born. She'll relieve those memories again and again and again.

Jun : Damn it. Uh. Um... They are not fictional. I believe the title is... uh.

Hinaichigo : What is it, Jun?

Jun : You two stay here with Shinku. Don't answer the door, no matter what. Got it?

Suiseiseki : Uh, I swear. That runt really pisses me off.

Hinaichigo : Um?


Jun : Gotcha. B-6, B-7, huh?

Librarian : Oh, those books aren't here. Sorry about that, but our library is getting renovated. We are storing those books in another location, though.

Jun : Can you tell me where?

Librarian : Yeah, the middle school down the block. You know the one, right?


Male voice in Jun's mind : There, Sakurada.

Jun : Hey, who said that?

Female voice in Jun's mind : Hey, did you hear? That Sakurada-kun.

Jun : Who's there? Cut it out! Stop it! Stop it, please! Stop! Ugh...

Suiseiseki : Um...

Jun : Year, what?

Suiseiseki : Hinaichigo doesn't have a medium. She draws her power from Shinku. So without Shinku, she doesn't have any power at all.

Jun : No way.

Suiseiseki : You're supposed to be Shinku's servant. Do something about this! For once, why don't you use that mini-mini brain of yours to think? You good for nothing.

Jun : Just shut up! Good for nothing, huh? Oh, I guess you're right.


Nori : Huh? Hina's gone asleep, too?

Suiseiseki : Yes.

Nori : Where's Jun?

Suiseiseki : He's a good-for-nothing human. He's been shut up and in his room this whole time.


Nori : Jun-kun, want some dinner?

Jun : No.

Nori : Do you think you could talk to me for a little bit?

Jun : No.

Nori : Then I'll talk to myself. You know, this morning when I saw that serious look on your face, I remembered something from when we were younger. Do you remember? It was the day I lost my favorite stuffed animal. You worked so hard just to make another one for me. I was so surprised. I never dreamed you could do something like that and you did it all by yourself. Because of that, I knew you could do anything. All you have to do is try.

Jun : Shut up! I told you before I don't wanna hear about that stuff from you or anyone! Forget it, already. I'm not good for anything, anyway. I can't even go to school anymore.

Nori : But Jun-kun...

Jun : I can't do anything except to stay cooped up in this house. That is for me. This is my life, now. Now you know everything, so just get lost, already. Get out!

Nori : You know, Jun-kun, even though she doesn't say it, Shinku loves you very much.

Jun : Does she really? No way.

Shinku in Jun's memory : Jun, you're wonderful. Thank you. Watching you was as if your fingers were playing the most beautiful melodies.


Students ((two conversations at one time)) : ...I was surprised you know. You don't need any breakfast today? It's... Oh, I'm so hungly. I know. ...true. Get... Seriously, thinking about it really... Yeah, I wanna quit too.

Tomoe : What's he doing here?

Teacher : Good morning.

Tomoe : Oh, good morning to you, sir.

Teacher : What are you looking at? That's so interesting?

Tomoe : No, nothing.

Teacher : Uh-huh. Um, well, see you in class.

Jun : Come on.

Tomoe : They keep it locked in the mornings. If you came to school, why don't you wear your uniform?

Jun : Um, none of your business.

Tomoe : I see. I have to do some research for a teacher so if you wanna get in there, I have the key. So, Hinaichigo's fallen asleep, too.

Jun : Um, yeah.

Tomoe : That's why you came all the way out here?

Jun : It's not like it's a big deal or anything.

Tomoe : Here it is.

Jun : Rozen...

Tomoe : Maiden. It's German. What I am about to write here is what I have heard about the doll maker Rozen. Whether the following is fact or fiction, I cannot say with any certainity.

Jun : What?

Tomoe : When Hinaichigo showed up, I got curious and did some research.

Jun : Do you know how to fix them?

Tomoe : I didn't get that far. But... but it's probably here somewhere. This book can't be checked out. If we're gonna read it, we'd better start now.

Jun : "Differenten..." method((*)). Fix... try to entrust... Attent... What's this "Niedergeist"?

((*)): Jun might have been unable to pronounce "Differenten Methode" in German correctly.


Tomoe : It's a spirit.

Jun : Spirit? So We're supposed to entrust a ghost with this? Uh.

Tomoe : It's Shinku's artificial sprit. Do you know how to summon it?

Jun : I don't. But I bet that rotten little doll does.

Teacher : Kashiwaba? You in there?

Tomoe : Quick, the window. There's nobody around right now. Remember where the back gate is?

Jun : Uh, yeah.

Tomoe : Go on. Hurry.

Jun : Um, look. Sorry, you got tried into this. Thanks a lot.


Jun : Here goes. Uh... Her back? Shinku. Shinku? Shinku. Hi, Shinku. Ow.

Shinku : Honestly. You took far too long to wake me. You're such a useless servant. If you thought about it at all, you'd have figured it out.

Jun : Ugh! Why you. Do you know how worried I was?

Shinku : Were you?

Jun : Not really.

Shinku : May I ask why are you blushing so fiercely now? Jun-kun? Well, I'll at least voice my gratitude. Thank you, Jun. How long do you intend to sleep? Come now. Wake up.

Jun : Hey, Shinku.

Shinku : Jun, run along and bring up some tea.

Jun : Why do I have to?

Shinku : What a vexing servant you are. I believe I made it clear it was your duty.

Jun : I don't remember you saying that.

Suiseiseki : Your heart is as miniscule as ever.

Jun : What did you say?

Shinku : Come now. Wake up.

Suiseiseki : He's become quite energetic now that Shinku's awake.

Jun : Don't be stupid!


Suigintou : That's right, Shinku. You can't break down yet. I'll be the one to turn you into junk.
