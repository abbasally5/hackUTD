  Hinaichigo : No, I don't wanna! No!

Shinku : Here, just serve at my side, Hinaichigo.

Hinaichigo : No! Kun-kun, Kun-kun, Kun-kun, Kun-kun!

Shinku : You will unhand immediately!

Hinaichigo : No, I don't wanna!

Shinku : Enough of this nonsense.

Jun : OK, guys.

(Crash)

Nori : W-What was that? Jun-kun! What was that noise? Oh, no! It's a burglar! ...Huh?

Suiseiseki : Oh, that so hurts.

Shinku : Suiseiseki?

Suiseiseki : Oh, Shinku... Shinku! It's been ages. I missed you so much.

Hinaichigo : Hina too! Hina too! It's been ages, I missed you so much.

Hinaichigo : Shinku! Shinku! Shinku! Shinku! Shinku! Shinku!

Suiseiseki : Shinku! Shinku, I can't believe I finally found you. I missed you so.

Jun : It can't be - it's another doll.

Nori : OK, ladies, help yourselves. And Suiseiseki, please think of our house as if it were your own.

Jun : Hey, Noritard (Nori + retard). Yeah, don't hurt yourself bending over backwards for 'em. I mean, we just got ourselves another creepy doll.

Jun : Uh, wha-what?

Hinaichigo : Hey, er... Suiseiseki, who wound you up, anyway?

Shinku : Yes, and did they also wind her up?

Nori : Wait a minute. Who's this "her?"

Jun : You mean there are more of these things?

Nori : That'd be so cool. Right, Jun?

Jun : Oh, I wanna die...

Suiseiseki : Humans... I just hate humans, I hate humans so much!

Nori : Suiseiseki. Bad. You will not throw food in this house.

Nori : I guess a sponge cake wasn't a good idea. So, how about we all have some strawberries and milk, OK?

Hinaichigo : Strawberries!

Shinku : It really isn't like you to lump all humans together. That is to say, you are a gardener, are you not?

Nori : You wanna get the berries poured milk?

Shinku : Did something happen?

Jun : Hey.

Shinku : Not now. The day's been terribly long, and it's time for us to go to sleep.

Jun : Well, I'm wondering if you're gonna do anything about the window.

Shinku : Well, that's very thoughtful of you. However, the wind can't get to me inside my case.

Jun : I'm not being thoughtful! It's freezing in here!

Shinku : Good night, Jun.

Jun : Hey.

Hinaichigo : Good night. Sleep well!

Jun : Man, what a stubborn doll.

Jun : What do you want?

Suiseiseki : Runt!

Jun : Ru...! Oh, that's great. I bet she's gonna be a lot of trouble.

(Jun screams)

Jun : What the hell was that? Oh, it's only you.

Suiseiseki : From now on, you will stand that side of the line. Umm... Umm... Just crawl away back into your den and don't you ever come out. You understand that, right?

Jun : Hang on.

Suiseiseki : Stop fiend! Get lost!

Jun : Come back here, you little...

Suiseiseki : Stay away, you!

Shinku : What is that commotion?

Suiseiseki : Help me, Shinku! Save me.

Shinku : Oh Jun, please try not to startle the poor girl so. Even among the sisters, this one is particularly timid and apt to frightened easily.

Jun : She is not timid!

Suiseiseki : He's filthy! Don't spit at us, you monster!

Jun : Hold it!

Hinaichigo : Oh, Hina wants to play tag with you, too!

Jun : Let go! Let go of me, man! Where'd you go, creepie?

Suiseiseki : Really, he's such an awful little bastard.

Suiseiseki : Excuse me, is this your garden?

Nori : What? It's kind of my idea of a garden.

Suiseiseki : You've given them too much fertilizer. It is nice that you pamper them so, but they're telling you that they've had enough to eat.

Nori : Wow, you can talk to flowers? That's so cool.

Jun : Aha. Now what?

Shinku : You need to calm yourself. It's possible that it's some point this girl might be quite a godsend for you. The Gardener. Suiseiseki's power.

Jun : Forget it! I don't care what kind of crazy power she has.

Shinku : And now that he's had his tantrum, you can begin.

Suiseiseki : It seems a shame to waste it on a human, but...

Nori : I can't wait to see what's gonna happen next. Whatever it is, it's gonna be awesome. Huh?

Suiseiseki : Come out, Sui Dream. Open the door. Well, it's about time you woke up. You such a troublesome little bastard.

Jun : Hey, what did you say?

Suiseiseki : Oh my! What a gloomy world this is. It makes me wanna puke.

Jun : You're the one who brought us here, remember?

Suiseiseki : Actually, human, you should know this world better than anybody else. This is your dream. This world is the reflection of what lies deep inside your heart.

Jun : This is all... my dream?

Nori : Are you really really sure he's okay?

Shinku : You needn't worry. Finding the door to a person's dreams and being able to come and go through it is Suiseiseki's power.

Nori : Okay...

Shinku : Come to think of it, I'll have a look as well.

Hinaichigo : I wanna go.

Nori : Oh, I'd like to go, too.

Shinku : Aren't you afraid?

Nori : A little. But if going there means it'll help me understand what's in his heart, it's worth it.

Shinku : Wait here, Nori. We'll be back in a bit.

Hinaichigo : Back in a bit!

Nori : But, Shinku...

Shinku : I have a feeling he'll not want you to see him in this way just yet.



Jun : This is my dream? You gotta be kidding me. This can be it?

Hinaichigo : An X and a Y and a cross... another Y with a little 2 on them... Huh?


Suiseiseki : Shinku! I'm so glad you are here. I didn't know what I was going to do with this horrible creature.

Jun : Yeah, right back at you sister.
(Right back at you. ＝ お互い様だよ。)

Hinaichigo : Hey, look over there.

Shinku : They appear to be study guides.

Hinaichigo : Ooh, there's so many of them.

Suiseiseki : It's the runt's name.

Teacher : OK class, everyone in your seats.

Students : Yes, sir!

Student : Looks like Sakurada's absent again?

Student : What? Really?

Student : Hmm, I wonder if something happened to him.

Hinaichigo : Wow, the flowers are talking! Isn't that neat?

Hinaichigo : Hey. You think Nori would like it if we brought some of these flowers home for her?

Flowers : Wow, she's talking about us. Get away, you idiot.

Shinku : Good idea. Why don't you pick some?

Jun : Hinaichigo, it flew over by you!

Hinaichigo : I got it.

Jun : Damn ( it ).

Suiseiseki : You see how completely ridiculous he looks? I fail to understand what the fun is in chasing after a little car?

Shinku : If he can have such a look on his face....

Suiseiseki : Pardon me?

Jun : What the hell's that?

Suiseiseki : Jun.

Suiseiseki : Really, even the size of your courage is teeny-tiny.

Jun : You're flying? How could you be flying?

Suiseiseki : Everyone can fly here. Everyone but you.

Jun : What are you talking about?

Suiseiseki : You measure things according to your puny standards. That's why you'll always be a runt.

Jun : Hey, now what?

Suiseiseki : Come on and fly. After all, this is your world. If you wish to fly, go ahead and fly. Hurry up now. What are you waiting for, you runt? Fly!

Jun : OK then, you rotten little doll...Just stop callin' me a runt! Ow...

Jun : That really hurts.

Suiseiseki : You did very well for a runt.

Jun : Oh yeah, that figures. A monster made out of paper. Geez.

Shinku : Indeed. It's all just ordinary paper.

Hinaichigo : Wow, that's pretty!

Suiseiseki : For such an icky world, it is pretty.

Jun : What are you calling pretty? What's so pretty about a rotten place like this anyway.

Shinku : See for yourself.

Shinku : And that is where we need to go, Jun.

Suiseiseki : Hurry up and get across, you.

Jun : You wanna get over there so fast, why don't you fly?

Jun : Hey, wait up.

Shinku : I thought so. It's a very small tree.

Jun : Poor little suckers are warped and scrawny looking.

Suiseiseki : Funny you say that. For this tiny tree is you, human.

Jun : What?

Suiseiseki : All people have a tree somewhere in their dreams. The dreamer grows
branches and leaves of the tree. And the dreamer's soul develops through that process as well.

Jun : So, this tree is me?

Shinku : Indeed. However this one's growth is obviously being stunted.

Suiseiseki : We could remove all these obstructions if only we had the gardener's shears.

Jun : Wait. Gardener's shears?

Suiseiseki : I'm sorry, but this is about all I can do for you right now, little one.

Suiseiseki : Sui Dream. Please fill my watering can with water for me. Fill it with sweet delicious water.

Suiseiseki : Be healthy now... Be free now... Unfurl your shimmering, green leaves...

Suiseiseki : It isn't any use. The surrounding grasses are getting in the way and it cannot grow.

Hinaichigo : It looks like it perked up a little bit though, doesn't it?

Suiseiseki : I'm really sorry, tiny tree.

Jun : It's OK. I mean you did everything you could.

Suiseiseki : I wasn't apologizing to you, filthy human. Know thyself with the horror, right you are.

Jun : Say that again, you rotten little doll!

Shinku : You'll be fine now. After all, you do have someone to provide you with the light and water you need. And from there, the rest is up to you.

Shinku : Our time is almost up. We must leave immediately. If we wind down here, we will be trapped in the dream world forever.

Jun : I'm cool with that. I'll just wake up and you guys are gone. Is that how it works?

Suiseiseki : If we are trapped in this dream, you will be trapped as well. And the body that you left in the real world would become a living corpse.

Jun : What? You couldn't have told me that earlier?

Suiseiseki : You never asked me that, did you?

Jun : OK then. Let's go.

Suiseiseki : We'd be delighted, although we don't know the way back.

Jun : You don't know?

Shinku : Have you forgotten? Well, this is your world.

Shinku : Easy. We're in a bit of a pinch, but you're going too fast.

Hinaichigo : I'm gonna fall off!

Jun : Oh man, you guys complain a lot!

Jun : Hey, what do you think you're doing? Just hang on tight, OK?

Jun : Ow, that hurts.

Nori : Oh Jun-kun, you're all right!

Jun : Hey don't grab onto me!

Nori : Oh Jun...

Shinku : That certainly was a frightening ride. And so we're back.

Hinaichigo : And so we're back.

Jun : Man, I'm totally exhausted.

Nori : Well I'm just glad you all made it back in one piece.

Jun : Oh you don't know the half of that, sis.

Shinku : Suiseiseki. I was wondering. How would you feel about having Jun as your medium.

Jun : Oh, just hang on a second. What do you think I am, some kind of franchise?

Shinku : Well, tactically, he is my servant. He does have his faults but he is not a bad human.

Jun : Like I said...

Shinku : Being a host, two or three of us wouldn't make any difference.

Jun : No difference? What do you mean?

Jun : Um, well...

Suiseiseki : I would so rather die than be with the likes of you!

Jun : What? Yeah, well I wouldn't want you either!

Suiseiseki : He's barking at me again!

Jun : You rotten little doll, hold it right there!

Suiseiseki : The runt is chasing after me!

Nori : Say ahh.

Hinaichigo : Nori, it's yummy.

Nori : Really?

Hinaichigo : Uh-huh!
