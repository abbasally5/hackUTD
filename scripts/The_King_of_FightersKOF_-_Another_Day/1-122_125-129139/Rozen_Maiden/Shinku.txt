  Suigintou : The medium...

Souseiseki : Lempicka!

Suiseiseki : Sui Dream!

Suigintou: Oh no!

Souseiseki : We're taking back our spirits!

Hinaichigo : Now I'm really mad!

Souseiseki : Take Shinku and get out of here!

Suiseiseki : Hurry, and please take care of her, human.

Jun : Don't worry.

Shinku : Jun...

Suigintou : Shinku!

Suigintou : You horrid things. I'll make you pay for this.

Shinku : What is that?

Jun : It's just a little house I built. It's a summer project I made in an elementary school.

Jun : Are you all right?

Shinku : Well, of course I'm all right. This is nothing. This is nothing really. Even without my right arm, I still have my left. Isn't that right? I can still button my...

Jun : Shinku...

Shinku : I've become a worthless, imperfect defective doll.

Jun : That isn't true.

Shinku : And just like that I'm broken, I've lost a precious piece that Father gave to me. Now I'm nothing but worthless junk.

Jun : Shinku, don't say things like that!

Shinku : I can no longer become Alice.

Jun : Shinku! Listen! No one's perfect. We all have our defects. Even I...

Shinku : You don't understand any of this. Now I'm nothing but a piece of useless trash! I can never become Alice, do you hear? Never!

Jun : Shinku...

Shinku : Alice is... Alice is more noble than any flower. She's more pure than any jewel. Alice is unspoiled. A perfect girl! I am not like you humans at all. I am a doll and I must be perfect. And no one wants to have a doll that has become a worthless piece of junk.

Jun : Shinku, listen to me. When I look at you, I don't see a broken useless doll. Besides, even if you are missing something, you've got me to take its place.

Jun : Don't cry anymore. Look at me and understand. You're very important to me. You remember, what I said? I told you I'd protect you. Wait here for me, OK?

Shinku : Jun...

Shinku : Jun... Something is changing inside Jun's heart.

Nori : Hina! Suiseiseki! Souseiseki!

Souseiseki : This is bad!

Suiseiseki : Souseiseki! Sui Dream!

Suigintou : Now to find Shinku.

Suiseiseki : Jun...

Jun : It should be around here. Oh, found it!

StudentA : Hey, did you hear about Jun Sakurada? I heard he failed the test and had to transfer out.

Jun : What is this?

StudentB : Yes, that's right! Everyone said he was a genius. Some genius.

StudentC : Oh man, he's so useless.

Jun: Not again! No! Stop it!

Suigintou : You're standing in the spring of memories, human.

Jun : What?

Suigintou : Your painful memories, your past regrets. I wonder if you can make your way through them?

Jun : Damn!

StudentD : Oh man, I thought you were way smarter than that.

Jun : Just shut up! Just shut up and go away!

Suigintou : Do you want me to help you? It's simple. Tell me where Shinku is, and I'll pull you out.

Jun : Shinku... There's no way in hell! I'll never gonna tell you. You forget...what I said...that I was gonna protect Shinku!

Suigintou : Hmph. Such a troublesome boy. There's no way you can help, let alone protect her.

Jun : Shinku!

Suigintou : Brat!

Jun : Shinku! Shinku!

Suigintou : No use. There isn't anything you can do.

Suigintou : What?

Jun : That I know you're thinking, you're thinking I look stupid right now. Sticking up for her like this when nothing to gain. I used to think that way too. It's meaningless. There's no point in trying. And that's how I used to think. Yah. But Shinku doesn't even know there's any point to a battle. She just keeps on fighting anyway. And she's been fighting alone longer than me. Fighting for what she believes. So I'll... fight too!

Suigintou : Impossible!

Suigintou : Can't be... The human thwarted my attack. How is that possible?

Shinku : We are inside Jun's dream, are we not? He can prevail over anything here. He just needs to set his mind on it and it is so.

Jun : Shinku!

Shinku : For a servant, this is the first time you've been useful, Jun.

Jun : Shinku...

Shinku : It's amazing. My arm has...

Suigintou : Mended! That horrid boy can repair what was once broken. But the only person besides Father who can do that. But only a maestro should be able to do that! This, this human has that power?

Shinku : Jun.

Shinku : And now we shall settle this, Suigintouu.


Shinku : Jun, stay back now.

Jun : You sure?

Shinku : I will not lose as long as I have you. Quickly now. Get back and watch.

Jun : OK.

Suigintou : Shinku!

Jun : Shinku!

Shinku : Holie!

Suigintou : Shinku...

Shinku : You don't have a medium, Suigintou. And you cannot beat me without one. We have to stop this now. This fight is over.

Suigintou : Shut up! Shut up, you! I will become Alice. I will become Alice. Alice...

Shiku : Jun, get behind me now.

Suigintou : Shinku!

Shinku : It's over now, Suigintou.

Shinku : Suigintou...

Suigintou : I'm not broken. I'm not broken. I'm not broken. I'm not junk. I'm not junk.

Jun : Her body, her torso...

Shinku : Yes Jun, she was never finished. Incomplete. Before he finished making her, Father vanished.

Suigintou : Father... Why? Why did you... When I love you so much... how could you leave me like that? No matter what, I will become Alice. I will become Alice. And I'll see Father... I'll be perfect... Father...

Shinku : Poor Suigintou, she wanted to become Alice because she wanted Father's love. That desire alone was what allowed her to act without a medium.

Jun : So that's why she destroy everyone just to have the chance to meet her Father and tell him that she was a perfect doll.

Shinku : Yes. I think her feelings for Father, out of all of us, would probably be the most pure. But those feelings are also which drove her mad.

Nori : So this is Jun's tree?

Suiseiseki : It's sad, isn't it?

Hinaichigo : It's as teeny weedy as ever.

Souseiseki : I'll use the gardener's shears to trim away all the bothersome grass that's clinging to it. And Suiseiseki will give it water. Don't worry.

Nori : Souseiseki.

Souseiseki : Yes?

Nori : Why don't we just leave this little guy alone?

Souseiseki : Hmm? But...

Nori : No, it's OK. This tree has to grow up to be really really big. It's gonna have to figure out how to deal with the glass on its own. You can do it, right, Jun?

Souseiseki : I understand. Lempicka? Well, let's head back.

Hinaichigo : What about Jun and Shinku?

Suiseiseki : Those two are going to be all right. They have all this light shining down on them now.

Shinku : Told you, those fingers are magical.

Jun : No, not really.

Shinku : They are. And they make me very happy.

Shinku : Jun, if I ever become Alice, if that day comes, I would like you to make an exquisite robe for me.

Jun : I don't know if I'm good enough to make something like that.

Shinku : Of course you are. And some day, you'll be able to make anything you want.

Jun : Voila.

Shinku : Here.

Jun : What's that?

Shinku : Can't you tell by looking? Brush my hair and do it up for me.

Jun : Oh, you're kidding.

Shinku : Not just anyone can touch a lady's hair. Only people she trusts are allowed. You should feel honored.

Shinku : You know, Jun. Do you see how bright it is and how very beautiful. It's what's inside your heart right now. But it will not stay like this forever. Sometimes it will rain, and sometimes storms will rage. And if you leave it untended, the landscape will change into a place you won't recognize at all.

Shinku : Everytime something like that happens, you'll have to continue to fight. For that is...

Jun : I know. For that is what it means to live.

Shinku : You're a good boy, Jun.

Shinku : Well, I'll be going now.

Jun : Going? Where are you going?

Shinku : Your regard for me has definitely left its impression in here. So Jun, please make sure you don't forget.

Shinku : My name is Shinku. And I'm the proud fifth of the Rozen Maiden dolls. Also, I am the doll who's happy to be yours.

Jun : Shinku... Shinku? Shinku... Shinku... Shinku! Shinku! Shinku!

Nori : Oh, Jun-kun. Could you call Shinku and Hina for me? We need to hurry up and eat.

Jun : They're gone.

Nori : What?

Jun : They're gone. Far away.

Nori : Oh...

Jun : Hey Nori, what about me?

Nori : What? Um... Well... Uh... Do you want some?

Jun : Man, you're hopeless. Save some for me, I'll eat when I get back.

Nori : Wait Jun-kun, where are you going?

Jun : For a walk.

Hinaichigo : Welcome home, Jun!

Jun : Whoa, what are you guys...

Shinku : Jun, you shouldn't stay out so late. Hurry up now, and make me some tea.

Jun : Hang on a second! What happened going away? Didn't you go away?

Shiku : No one ever said anything of the sort.

Jun : What?

Suiseiseki : I so cannot take this anymore! I'm running away from home!

Jun : Why, you rotten little doll...

Souseiseki : Suiseiseki, you're the one who's a bother here, not me.

Shinku : Jun, it's cold out. Close the window for me.

Jun : Uh.., whatever...

Nori : Hey you guys, Detective Kun-kun is about to start!

Hinaichigo, Suiseiseki, Souseiseki : Coming!

Jun : Well, when I looked a little while ago, my ring was gone.

Shinku : We used far too much of our power and for a time there, the ring almost disappeared completely. However, your strength as a human grew, and thanks to that, your ring was able to regain its former brilliance. As a result, it allowed me the chance to return here. It's all thanks to you, Jun.

Shinku : Jun? I'd like you to pick me up.

Jun : Like this?

Shinku : Like that. Hurry now, or Detective Kun-kun will start without us.

Jun : Yeah, yeah.

Shinku : You need only say it once.

Jun : Yeah, yeah, yeah... Ouch! Why, you...!
