  Shinku:
 Come now, wake up.
 It's thirteen minutes past seven, and we need to start the day.

Hinaichigo:
No, cuddle.

Shinku:
 It seems we still do not understand our position.

Hinaichigo:
No. I hate you Shinku.

Shinku:
 Come now, on your feet.

Hinaichigo:
No. No.

Jun:
 Ah! You guys do this every morning. Shut up!

Shinku:
 Jun. It is too early for such an outburst.

Jun:
 Whatever. Don't know what the point is taught in your lecturing anyway.

Shinku:
 Disciplining the servants is an important duty for a lady.
 Pay attention, Hinaichigo. As my servant you must not come any closer to me than this.
 You will answer me with a yes, not an ooh, a yes.
 Come now, time for breakfast. You will use this to open doors for me.
 Pay attention, your foot isn't crossed on my space.

Hinaichigo:
Guah.

Shinku:
 Guah is unacceptable. Honestly, whose room do you think this is?

Jun:
 It's my room. This whole room is mine, you got that?
 It's mine, and that means I make the rules here.
 What do you think you are, anyway. Man.

Shinku:
 Honestly, as servants, both of you are extremely fussy.
 Hinaichigo. Don't stand there gaping at me.
 It's just one door. Hurry and open it.

Jun:
 There, it's open. Happy now?

Shinku:
 Thank you.

Jun:
 What am I, the door man?

 Those dumb kids. So annoying. Honestly.

Nori:
Help yourselves, ladies.
I made all this nummy stuff just for the two of you.
The eggs, did the smily-face eggs turn out awesome today?

Shinku:
 Is something wrong, Nori?

Nori:
No. It's OK.
What's wrong? Don't you like the eggs, Hina?

Hinaichigo:
Hina only likes to eat those white fluffy puffy roundy sweetie thingies.

Nori:
White fluffy... Yeah! I got it.
It's yogurt, right?
I didn't know you had a favorite food.

Hinaichigo:
No. Hina only wants unyu.
And it's black and it's red.

Nori:
It's black and red? Ah I got it, it's a tuna roll.
Wow. This is a tough one.
Hey Shinku, do you know? What's this food thingy Hina's talking about.

Shinku:
 I haven't the slightest. I wouldn't know anything about the beastly cravings of a spoiled servant.

Nori:
Oh I got it. Hina, why don't you draw a picture of it.

Hinaichigo:
OK.

Nori:
All done?

Hinaichigo:
All done. Like this!

Nori:
This?

Hinaichigo:
Yeah, that's it!

Nori:
What? Madam Pearl's on already?
Oh no. I'm gonna be late for school.
I'm really sorry Hina. I promise I'll get you what you want when I get home tonight.
Well, see you later.

Hinaichigo:
Shinku. Shinku?

Jun:
 And... purchase.
 Oh great.

Hinaichigo:
You going to school, too?
Tomoe always goes to school. Nori went to school too. Why are...

Jun:
 I don't have to go. And I'm never gonna go.
 I'm different. I don't need to go to school.

Hinaichigo:
You stay in your room today?

Jun:
 That's none of your business, OK?

Hinaichigo:
You're just like Hina then. But I go there.
Sometimes Hina has to stay in the case and be alone.
It's lonely in there, um, but I'm told to stay inside.
See? You're just like Hina.
Where you going now?

Jun:
[And/Will] you just shut up.

 Damn it. And that's why I hate kids.
 Er huh?
 Can't anyone close the door around here?
 What the hell.


Nori:
Red, and black, and unyu.
Red, and black, and unyu.
Yeah! Cod roe and squid ink pasta!

Teacher:
Now that sounds like a meal, Sakurada.

(TV show)

Jun:
 Dolls watching pappet shows. That's a little weird.
 Well, at least it's quiet.
 What the hell is this!

Hinaichigo:
A flower! And that's a butterfly, and this is you.
You like it?

Jun:
 Yeah, not bad. What am I saying! Clean this up right now!

Hinaichigo:
Jun's a meanie!

Shinku:
 Oh, what noisy servants you are. Both of you, hush.

Jun:
 Hey, the little clip's your servant, right?
 Isn't it your job to keep her out of trouble?

Shinku:
 Please move.
 Jun, turn on the TV.

Jun:
 I am not turning it on until you...
 Hot Hot Hot! What's this?

Hinaichigo:
It's yummy and sweet.
Oh yeah, Hina wants to eat it. Hina likes it.
It's really white and it's really sweet and really unyu.
And it's black and red, too.

Jun:
 White and sweet and unyu?

Hinaichigo:
Did you guess it?

Jun:
 I have no idea what this is supposed to be.
 And clean up the mess you made on the floor.

Hinaichigo:
Hina is all alone. Alone. And nobody ever understands Hina.
Tomoe understood me. She bought them for Hina even when Hina didn't say...

Jun:
 Look. I'm getting sick of all this whining, OK?
 You wanna go back to her so bad, there's the door.

Hinaichigo:
I wanna go back! I do. Hina wants to go back to Tomoe.
But I can't be with her.

Jun:
 So, why can't you?

Shinku:
 Tomoe does not have a ring anymore.

Jun:
 A ring?

Shinku:
 Without a ring, we cannot use a medium's energy to supply our powers.
 Since Hinaichigo has consented to be my servant. I can share the energy that I draw from you with her.
 However, this also means that she cannot stray too far from either of us.

Jun:
 Whatever, I still hate kids.
 Always crying.
 It just irritates me somehow. That's all. That's all it is, OK?
 Damn it.

Hinaichigo:
It's lonely in there, but I'm told to stay inside.
See? You're just like Hina.

Jun:
 I'm not like her.


Hinaichigo:
Hey, he's not here. Jun's not upstairs either.

Shinku:
 Honestly, how dare he leave without my permission.

Hinaichigo:
We haven't looked back there yet.
Shinku. What's behind that door there?

Shinku:
 Oh yes. I'll show you.
 Such a pretty little area for a house like this.
 But this is no ordinary room.

Hinaichigo:
I know what it is. Bathroom!

Shinku:
 Yes.

Hinaichigo:
Didn't you know it was a bathroom?

Shinku:
 I will not tolerate such impudence from a servant.

Hinaichigo:
Won't it open?

Shinku:
 Something's strange.


Shopkeeper:
Sorry about that. I just sold out.
You wanna come back tomorrow? I could save some.

Jun:
 Thanks anyway.

Shopkeeper:
Come again.

Jun:
 It's getting late. If this guy didn't have it, there's a place across the tracks though.

Hinaichigo:
You're heavy. Hurry!

Shinku:
 You never tell a lady that she's heavy. Just hold on.

Hinaichigo:
I can't hold on. Hurry! Huh?
Oh Shinku? Hina wants to go outside too.

Shinku:
No. You're staying there till I can get you out.

Hinaichigo:
What? That's mean. No Shinku.
Come on, Hina wants to go too.

Shinku:
 How perfect.
 Oh no.

Hinaichigo:
Shinku? Are you out there?

Shinku:
 I'll open the door.

Hinaichigo:
Feathers?

Shinku:
 Hinaichigo. You have to stay close to me now.
 Stop these games and just show yourself.
 Suigintou.
 Hinaichigo. Behind me.

Hinaichigo:
OK

Suigintou:
586,920 hours 37 minutes since we met, Shinku.

Shinku:
 I was unaware that you had awakened.

Suigintou:
Really?
I thought I have made it known.
Did you not see the signs?

Shinku:
 So, that was you.
 The poor little doll was acting under your influence.

Suigintou:
Just my way of saying hello.
By the way, if you've been defeated in the game, what are you still doing here, Hinaichigo?
A doll that's lost the game must surrender her Rosa Mystica to the one who has beaten her.
Those are the rules of the Alice game.
Why have you defied such simple rules?

Shinku:
 Mind your business.
 I have my own way of doing things.

Suigintou:
Even if you should anger Father?

Shinku:
 If you have a problem with that I see no reasen why we can't settle it now.

Suigintou:
You look as ugly as ever when you're angry.

Shinku:
 Silence.

Suigintou:
You cannot defeat me with such insignificant powers.
Oh, never mind.
It isn't any fun unless I can slowly torment you two ninnies.
See you around.

Shinku:
 Suigintou, wait.
 Suigintou...

Driver:
Hey kid! Are you blind or something? Watch it!

Jun:
 Oh crap.

Girl A:
It was so cute I end up find it.

Girl B:
Seriously?

Girl A:
Yeah.

Girl B:
It was that cute?

Girl A:
It was that cute. I'll show you tomorrow.

Girl B:
I wanna see it, I wanna see it.

Girl A:
Well, can you come over now?

Student A:
Hey, you sure you don't wanna go to the archade?

Student B:
I don't got any money.

Jun:
It's Omoda and Itou.
 Damn it. I knew well I shouldn't have left home.
 But now it'd be stupid going home without it.
 Damn it.

Tomoe:
Sakurada. Why are you here?

I'm impressed you figured out what her favorite food was.
I guess I'd better go home now.

Jun:
 Hey, er... it's about the dolls.
 You know what they are?

Tomoe:
Hina just showed up at my house.
That day, I just answered the phone.

Hello, Kashiwaba residence.

Speaker:
Will you wind, or not wind?

Tomoe:
At first I was scared.
I even thought about throwing her away while she was asleep.
But, living together with Hinaichigo, and spending time with her, I could tell that she was really lonely.
I don't really know what those dolls are, where they came from, and whatever they're trying to do while they're with us.
I don't know about any of that stuff either.
But, one thing's for sure.
For some reason, those girls really need you right now, Jun.
Both of them. Shinku and Hinaichigo.
Wanna know something?
I got a little worried when Hinaichigo went to your place.
I'm feeling a lot better about it now though.
Take care of Hina for me.


Hinaichigo:
There you are.
Where were you all day?
We had some big trouble here.

Jun:
 What do you mean?

Hinaichigo:
Yeah. Shinku and Suigintou...

Shinku:
 Hinaichigo. It was nothing, really.

Nori:
I'm home guys!
Check it out! I got what you want. Sorry it took...
Did you go outside?

Jun:
 What do you mean?

Hinaichigo:
Unyu! You found it!


Nori:
I should've known there was soft rice cakes with strawberry filling.

Hinaichigo:
Unyu. So sweet, so yummy.
Hey Jun, thank you.

Jun:
 I didn't do anything.

Hinaichigo:
Here!

Jun:
I didn't ask you to bring me tea, did I?

Hinaichigo:
It's thanks. Hina, Hina likes you a lot now Jun, so I'm thanking you.
I love you Jun!

Jun:
 Well, Hey! Hold on!
