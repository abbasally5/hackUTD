  Souseiseki : Lempicka?

Mr. Shibasaki : Kazuki...

Souseiseki : Oh, no. Let's hurry.


Mr. Shibasaki : Kazuki. Kazuki. Kazuki. Kazuki, I told you over and over, never to leave. You remember?

Souseiseki : I'm really sorry.

Mr. Shibasaki : Listen to me. You are never to go anywhere, ever. Not you. Not ever.


Jun : Special cups that use vacuum sucction would adds 6 centimeters to your busts. Um.

Hinaichigo : Draw, draw...

Shinku : The ribbon's slightly crooked, Hina.

Suiseiseki : Well, at least it's becoming a little easier to look at, now.

Jun : Hey, guys. Keep it down. What are you doing over there? Any... wow! Get back, you!

Suiseiseki : And after all the trouble we went through to make it gorgeous.

Jun : Hey! Hold up, right there!

Hinaichigo : I think he is going up to Shinku now.

Suiseiseki : My buddy's ever so darn hopeless. Even the thoughts in his puny head are puny. Um?

Hinaichigo : Another N-Field?

Suiseiseki : Um, Hinaichigo. Be careful. You mustn't get too close.

Hinaichigo : Ah.

Suiseiseki : Hinaichigo! Uh.

Hinaichigo : What's going on?

Mr. Shibasaki in the mirror : Kazuki. I'll be stepping out for a while. Now be good and wait for me here.

Souseiseki in the mirror : I will. See you later.

Hinaichigo : Ah, Souseiseki.

Suiseiseki in the mirror : It's Kazuki this and Kazuki that. Morning till night.

Hinaichigo : You're at there?

Suiseiseki in the mirror : Talked out one-trick whatchamacallit.

Hinaichigo : And there? Huh?

Suiseiseki in the mirror : You and I should just wash our hands of that bothersome old coot. Let's go look for a different master together.

Souseiseki in the mirror : Do not badmouth on master.

Suiseiseki in the mirror : Souseiseki, there are something so wrong with that man. Can't you see that nothing good will come of it by standing with him?

Suiseiseki : No. Stop it.

Souseiseki in the mirror : I'm sorry. But I can't go with you.

Suiseiseki in the mirror : What?

Souseiseki in the mirror : Suiseiseki, you should go now.

Suiseiseki : No. Stop it. Stop it. Souseiseki.

Jun : Oh, there you are.

Shinku : Unhand me, Jun. Let go.

Hinaichigo : Oh?

Jun : I got you now, you rotten little doll. Um?

Shinku : Suiseiseki?

Hinaichigo : Hey, guess what! Just now, ... uh.

Jun : Huh? What the heck's with her?


Mr. Shibasaki : That should keep it going for another ten years or so.

Woman A : Oh, I'm so glad. This clock is very special to me. Uh, almost forgot. Here, grandpa. I brought you something.

Mr. Shibasaki : Oh, my! Taros tumbled in soy sauce.

Woman A : I made a little too much. Hope you like it.

Mr. Shibasaki : Oh, thank you. This is my son's favorite dish. He'll be so...

Woman A : Well? Um, well.


Woman A : I wonder what's happened to poor old grandpa Shibasaki. I mean, hasn't his son then...

Woman B : I know, I know. But with the condition of his wife's been in, the fact is he is not exactly getting any younger.

Nori : Oh, I'm gonna be late.

Woman A : He is very good at what he does.

Boy : M-Miss Sakurada...

Woman B : Oh, was he able to fix it?

Boy : Jesus. Too fast.

Woman : Hasn't cabbage gotten expensive?

Another woman : I know.


Mr. Shibasaki : Kazuki.

Souseiseki : Huh?

Mr. Shibasaki : You must be hungry. A customer of mine came in today, left us a tasty dish. I'll go warm it up for you, okay?

Souseiseki : Suigintou.

Suigintou : You certainly have it rough, playing the replacement for a lost son. But then, you are not what one will call feminine. Wasting your time, looking for the grandmother's tree. There was nothing but a white void, right? Even if you did find the tree, your little shears wouldn't be up to the task. Isn't that right? You need the watering can too. But that belongs to Suiseiseki, the other gardener. Say, I have an idea. Shall I steal it from her for you?

Souseiseki : Steal?

Suigintou : Well, you are going to need it, aren't you?

Souseiseki : Suigintou, you don't mean...


Nori : Okay, everyone. Here are your flower-topped hamburgers.

Hinaichigo : Yay.

Jun : If you guys keep having that stuff all the time, you're gonna get tired of it.

Hinaichigo : No way. Hina wants flower topping all the time. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.

Shinku : You mean the day after.

Hinaichigo : After that, too.

Nori : Okay. Help yourselves, everyone.

Hinaichigo : Thank you for the food. Um?

Nori : What's wrong, Suiseiseki? Aren't you hungry? Well, I was saving this for after dinner. A special treat, just feeded today.

Hinaichigo : Wow. You know? You know? You know? It's always been Hina's dream to have juice when it's dinner time. Yay. Juice, juice, juice.

Nori : You can have juice after dinner, Hina.

Hina : Juice. Juice, juice, juice, juice.

Shinku : Settle down, Hina. Um. Suiseiseki? What's wrong?

Suiseiseki : I'm going to bed.

Nori : Suiseiseki, are you okay?

Jun : What's her problem?

Shinku : Hinaichigo, something happened in the storage room, didn't it?

Hinaichigo : Eh? Um, ah... Nothing happened. Souseiseki didn't show up in the mirror, either. Ah, oh, no.

Shinku : Souseiseki?

Hinaichigo : No, no...

Jun : Hey. What's this Souseiseki?

Shinku : Souseiseki... Suiseiseki's younger twin sister who wields the gardener shears. I had thought it strange. They were inseparable. They've been together in every era. She's hiding something. I wonder what it could be, though.


Suiseiseki : That's enough. Show yourself, Suigintou.

Suigintou : Have I been found out?

Suiseiseki : Well, you are the only one dreadful enough to reflect my past in this mirror.

Suigintou : No, don't scowl at me like that. I've come all this way to show you something I think you'll want to see.

Suiseiseki : Um, Souseiseki.

Suigintou : Poor thing. She isn't even allowed to sleep in her case, and after forsaking you in favor of her master.

Suiseiseki : But why? That crazy old man really liked Souseiseki.

Suigintou : It seems that his love for her has gone too far. It's a shame she can't sleep inside her case. Dreaming in one's case is special for all of us. It's a sacred ritual where one's past is eternally woven into one's present. But if she is robbed of that, she may eventually become nothing but an empty shell devoid of emotion.

Mr. Shibasaski's voice : Kazuki.

Suiseiseki : Souseiseki. Um.

Suigintou : What a caring elder sister you are. That is so admirable.
:
Suiseiseki?
:
Souseiseki...
:
But why...?
Why are you...?
:
Nothing's changed here at all.
:
No, it's fine.
Leave it alone.
:
Souseiseki?
:
You don't understand.
There's something I have to do here, sister.
If I leave now, master's heart and mind will be broken.
:
But that horrid old man was so broken long ago.
And that old woman still lies there asleep.
No matter how many times we entered her dreams, that was all white.
There was nothing there.
Give this up already!
:
Help me, sister.
Lend me your power.
I know I shouldn't be asking you for, but I think it's the only way to help him. And...
:
You actually want me to use the gardener's watering can for that old man?!
:
Please help me.
:
Even though he treats you like this, you'd still take the side of that senile old man?
Would you just snap out of it already?!
:
Kazuki!
:
Suiseiseki!
:
Hurry now!
You're so comin'!
:
Kazuki!
:
Ka...
Kazuki...
:
Why are you still so obsessed with him?
Stop being so silly now and come with me to see Jun.
:
Jun?
Who's that?
Is that your new master?
:
There's no covenant between us, yeah, but...
:
But what?
:
Well, he's such an utterly hopeless runt, and...
And I feel so worried about how he'll manage if I'm not around.
:
So he's a good person.
Do you like him?
:
What are you saying?
That's not true!
I didn't say any such thing!
It's just so much better than that lousy old codger!
Besides, Shinku and Hina-Ichigo are there too.
:
Shinku...Hinaichigo...
That brings back memories.
:
I know!
And that's the reason why I think you should enter into a covenant with Jun too, and then...

Bird: Kazuki... Kazuki... Kazuki... Kazuki...

Souseiseki : My master. He's worried about me.

Suiseiseki : Take that! Quit that frightful shrieking, you vulture. Or I'll turn you into a roast chicken!

Bird : Kazuki. Kazuki...

Souseiseki : I'm sorry, but I'm still going back there.

Suiseiseki : Souseiseki!

Souseiseki : I feel exactly the same way about this as you do. I want to be with my master. By his side.

Suiseiseki : You old-man lover, you. And my patience has so run out now. Sui Dream! As your elder sister, I will put you back on the proper path, even if I have to drag you.

Souseiseki : Lempicka! Suiseiseki, stop this. I don't wanna fight you, but I will if I... Uh... Suiseiseki...


Mr. Shibasaki : Uh, Kazuki.

Suigintou : Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm not the boyish type.

Mr. Shibasaki : Who are you?

Suigintou : No matter how much you cherish her, she will run away from you every chance she gets. Old man, you'll be alone for eternity.

Mr. Shibasaki : Why you! Agh.

Suigintou : You shouldn't get angry. Be careful of your blood pressure. Are you getting enough lactic acid?

Mr. Shibasaki : Kazuki...

Suigintou : I do know of a way, though. A way to keep that girl bound to your side for ever and ever. So, will you help me, grandfather?


Suiseiseki : Souseiseki, come back with me this instance. Please come. I really don't wanna hurt you anymore. Then he, that old man's more precious to you? More than I am? Souseiseki, you... Souseiseki, you... You dummy!

Souseiseki : Sorry.


Souseiseki : Master. I'm sorry, master.

Mr. Shibasaki : Kazuki.

Souseiseki : Um, I, um... Uh...

Mr. Shibasaki : Oh, Kazuki. Kazuki...


Jun : Bathroom. Mhm, Suiseiseki? What are you doing up this late at night? Um? Hey, are you hurt or something? Suiseise...

Suiseiseki : You little...

Juh: Huh? Um. Oh. Why you, rotten little...

Suiseiseki : If only you were cooler, i-if only you were dependable, Souseiseki wouldn't pick that senile old codger over you, you runt!

Jun : What's wrong with you?

Shinku : What's the matter?

Hinaichigo : It's morning, isn't it...?

Shinku : Jun. Confess. Just what have you done to Suiseiseki?

Jun : What are you talking about? Hey, I was just trying to go to the bathroom. That's all.

Shinku : Well, I wonder.

Hinaichigo : Suisekseki, are you okay?

Jun : I said I didn't do anything.

Suiseiseki : Um.

Jun : Why you! Um? What's wrong with her?

Shinku : Suiseiseki?

Suiseiseki : I feel of it. A door to someone's dream is opening somewhere.

Jun : Is she serious? Is there someone else who can open doors to dreams like her? That must mean...

Suiseiseki : Souseiseki, oh, what do you think you're doing?
