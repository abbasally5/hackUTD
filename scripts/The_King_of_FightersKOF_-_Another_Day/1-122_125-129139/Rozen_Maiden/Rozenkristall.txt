  Tomoe:
That's how we arrived at our conclusion.

Boy:
The plants are living things. Now about the summer break coming up, everyone please remember the days you have duties and be sure you show up.
One last thing, if you're on track or swim, you've finally gotten the certificates for last month's inter-ward competition.
When I call your name, come up and get yours. Mai Kitagawa. Toshihiro Ohba. Tetsuya Suzuki.

Girl:
Good bye.

Tomoe:
Good bye.

Jun:
Let's see. OK... I've got Y equals two third of X minus six. So that means Y has gotta equal something.

Tomoe:
They're my notes. That's everything from the first term. You can borrow them.

Jun:
Oh ah... Thanks.

Tomoe:
And also. Here's all the homework for the summer break.

Jun:
Hey. Don't look.

Tomoe:
See you.

Jun:
Yeah.

Jun:
I'm home.
Find the angle of X in the diagram below. How do I do that?
That's how I'm supposed to do it. Ah! There're so much I gotta learn. Damn it!

Hinaichigo:
Shh OK? Shh don't tell me. You can't tell anyone Hina's hiding here.

Jun:
So, playing hide and seek?
I'm gonna say it again. My room is xxx...

Suiseiseki:
Puny, puny Ichigo. Come out, I know you're here.

Jun:
Hey you rotten horrible little doll. Why are you always bursting into xxx window?
You'd better xxx...

Suiseiseki:
Where is she? Where is Hinaichigo, you xxx? Come on xxx...

Souseiseki:
Suiseiseki, calm down.

Suiseiseki:
How can I possibly remain calm? That puny...

Hinaichigo:
I'm not puny.

Suiseiseki:
I so found you now. If you don't come out now, you are so flattened.

Jun:
Hey!

Hinaichigo:
Hina did nothing wrong!

Suiseiseki:
Shut up, you! We so totally have proof.
Don't laugh!
This tasteless and childish graffiti can only be the work of that puny Hinaichigo.
Go on Souseiseki. Show it to him.

Souseiseki:
Hinaichigo, did you really do this to the scissors?

Hinaichigo:
Yes, but...

Suiseiseki:
You see? She admits it.

Hinaichigo:
Yes, because Suiseiseki ate Hina's soft rice cake with strawberry. See? This is my revenge you to XXX

Suiseiseki:
What?

Jun:
You gotta be kidding. You mean you're still doing things like that?

Souseiseki:
You are just so hopeless.

Suiseiseki:
It's a lie. It's nonsense.

Hinaichigo:
It's the truth.

Suiseiseki:
Either way, you'll pay for the facing my watering can. Prepare for some [paying/pain], you.

Souseiseki:
Let it go already.

Jun:
That does it. I've had enough of this.

Shinku:
Jun. When will you understand? My tea is to be served at the same time everyday.

Jun:
Just hang on.

Shinku:
For a servant, you really are useless.
It seems you still do not understand your position.
Hinaichigo. Quickly now go tidy up your shelf. Your things are spilling over onto my side.

Jun:
You guys...

Shinku:
Why is it wet here?

Jun:
Get out of here. Just get out. Get out!

Kunkun:
It can't be. You were the culprit?

Fox:
I am sorry about that, Detective Kunkun. But I love you.

Kunkun:
What? Are you serious Miss Fox?

Suiseiseki:
Oh, what a horrible woman she is.

Shinku:
You needn't worry. Kunkun will not be deceived by such a woman.
Come now. Is the tea still not ready?

Hinaichigo:
I'm missing the Kunkun show.

Nori:
I'm back.

Hinaichigo:
Nori, You're so late.

Nori:
I'm sorry. We have a match coming up soon so practice ran a little late today.
So, here.

Hinaichigo:
Soft rice cake with strawberry.

Nori:
You could have it after dinner, OK?

Hinaichigo:
Sure. But hmm.

Nori:
I have an idea. Why don't you put in that little pouch you got?
Hinaichigo:
Oh, right.

Suiseiseki:
I so heard that.

Souseiseki:
Can't you just leave her alone?

Nori:
Oh, I didn't know you are visiting.

Jun:
Hi sis.

Nori:
Hi, I just got home. Sorry for being late.
I'll go make dinner right away. Oh, I need to bring in the laundry.

Jun:
I did it.

Nori:
Huh?

Jun:
I already brought it in.

Nori:
Jun kun. Thanks a lot.
OK. Tonight I'm gonna make everyone's favorite dish.

Hinaichigo:
Nori, are you making what I think you're making?

Nori:
Yup.

Hinaichigo:
Yeah.

Nori:
Suiseiseki, Souseiseki, stay for dinner.

Suiseiseki:
Oh, thank you so much.

Souseiseki:
I'd better call grandfather and let them know.
We can't pass this up.

Shinku:
It's almost night time.


Hinaichigo:
Mr. Flower top. Mr. Flower top.
Why why why why are you so tasty, huh?
I know it must be the harmony of egg and hamburger steak.
When we eat it together...

Suiseiseki:
Ah, alligator, alligator.

Jun:
Hun, I told you she'd fall for it.

Hinaichigo:
You're right, Jun. Thank you.

Suiseiseki:
Damn you, puny Ichigo and puny human.
xxxing up on me is so not fair.

Jun:
Hey, it's your own fault so just forget about it already and eat.

Suiseiseki:
Fine! I'll eat!

Jun:
Why you!

Suiseiseki:
Now we're even.

Jun:
How said even.

Hinaichigo:
Oh, Hina wants to eat too.

Suiseiseki:
Well now you have less.

Jun:
It's all your fault 'cause you're such a greedy weird doll.

Suiseiseki:
You damn puny human.

Jun:
What did you call me?

Nori:
Bye you guys. And tell your grandmother and grandfather I said "hi".

Souseiseki:
We will. And thank you again for dinner.

Suiseiseki:
We'll come visit again real soon.

Jun:
Yeah but next time, try using the front door.

Suiseiseki:
Having you use your power once in a while is good exercise for a flabby little human xxx like you.

Jun:
What?

Nori:
Be careful now.
Oh wow, Hina. Sounds like it's time for bed.

Hinaichigo:
Uh huh.
I'm gonna sleep now. Aren't you going to bed yet, Shinku?

Shinku:
No, not just yet. Put your things away before you go to bed.

Hinaichigo:
I'm sleeping with him. Good night, Shinku.

Shinku:
Good night, Hina.

Jun:
Good night.

Nori:
You're still up, Shinku? I thought you'd be asleep.
Hey, Jun kun. Don't stay up too late, OK?

Jun:
Yeah.

Nori:
Well, night.

Shinku:
Good night.

Jun:
Night, sis.
Hey.

Shinku:
What is it?

Jun:
Well, you've gone to bed late these days.

Shinku:
Ah?

Jun:
I mean you always said that sleeping was important to you, right?
Well, if you are the only one up I guess it'll be quiet.

Jun:
Ah, so you're turning in now?

Shinku:
Yes, I am.

Jun:
Good night.

Shinku:
Good night.
Say, Jun.

Jun:
Hmm... What is it?

Shinku:
Nothing. Never mind. Good night, Jun.

Jun:
Night.

Suigintou:
Shinku. I am not junk. I am not junk.
Shinku, why did you do that to me?
Shinku. Shinku. Shinku. Shinku.

Shinku:
Suigintou. No. Wait. No. Wait.
I never intended for this to happen.
I didn't want to lose you. Believe me.
That's why I didn't take your Rosa Mystica.
I thought... I only thought...

Suigintouo:
Then, tell me now. What did you fight for? What for?

Jun:
Shinku, what's wrong?

Shinku:
Jun.

Jun:
You're feeling a little better now?

Shinku:
Tell me, Jun.

Jun:
Un?

Shinku:
Was I right? Did I do the right thing?

Jun:
What?

Shinku:
I turned her into junk. And I don't know if I did the right thing or not.

Jun:
But you did. You didn't have a choice, right?
You said so yourself, remember?
The Alice Game is your destiny as a Rozen Maiden doll.
You said you couldn't avoid it.

Shinku:
I know. I said all those things. And I always believed that I had no choice. None.
After all, we are Rozen Maidens created by Father.
To become Alice and meet Father, we must play the Alice Game and fight each other.
We fight for our souls, our Roza Mysticas. When only one of us remains, that is when our fight is done.
That is our purpose in life. I believed that. However, losing her has made me realize some things.
Like how hard it is to lose a sister. And how painful it is to fight. Very painful.

Jun:
Shinku, you want some tea?
I'll go make some.

Shinku:
Jun? Ah, Meimei. It's Suigintou's artificial spirit.
Meimei, don't go.

Jun:
Shinku, just now the mirror was...
What was that?

Shinku:
That was Meimei.

Jun:
What did it want? Wait!

Shinku:
No. There is something I absolutely must say to her. Let go.

Jun:
Shinku.
Oh. Damn it.
It's snowing.

Shinku:
The handiwork of a trickster rabbit.

Jun:
Rabbit?

Shinku:
Indeed.

Laplace's demon:
If you find my presence distasteful, think of it this way.
You've dozed off and what you see before you is but a dream.

Jun:
It's a rabbit.

Shinku:
We are in a bit of a hurry now. What do you want?

Laplace's demon:
I have a warning or perhaps it's the lie of a charlatan.
It is said by some that when light seeks light, the light is lost.

Jun:
What the heck is he saying?

Shinku:
There is no point trying to take him seriously.
I have an idea. If you wish I will yank that tail of yours out.
Laplace's demon:
A deep forest is a labyrinth. However, if you insist on going further.

Shinku:
Meimei?
Laplace's demon:
There are countless holes in this world and many doors that hide them.
Beware of doors that you cannot see, for they are cunningly hidden.
Well then, I bid you good day.

Jun:
OK, who was that?

Shinku:
This is...

Jun:
Suigintou?

Shinku:
No.

Jun:
Ahh.

Shinku:
Jun.
Who's there?
Who are you? Show yourself.
Who are you?

Barasuishou:
Who are you?

Shinku:
Tell me who you are.

Barasuishou:
Tell me who you are.

Shinku:
My name is Shinku, the fifth Rozen Maiden doll.
Barasuishou:
Shinku. I am the seventh Rozen Maiden doll.

Shinku:
The seventh doll?

Barasuishou:
Barasuishou.


Jun:
Who the heck is that doll?

Shinku:
Barasuishou, the seventh Rozen Maiden doll.

Jun:
The seventh? She's attacking us.

Shinku:
It seems she takes her mischief a little too far.
Jun, keep yourself hidden.

Jun:
But you're gonna be OK on your own?

Shinku:
This is my problem. I will settle this.
Next time on Rozen Maiden Traumend.
Its melody is like a dream.
