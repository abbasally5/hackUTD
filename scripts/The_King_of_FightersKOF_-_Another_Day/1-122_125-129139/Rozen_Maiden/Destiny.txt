  Shinku:
Showing poor taste as ever, I see.
Suigintou, show yourself!

?:
Look at me.
I've become junk.
Your face! Give me that face! Your face!
What a beautiful face!
Please give it to me!

Suigintou:
So that [vast/burst to] power the other day, you really did come from your medium.
I knew you couldn't be that strong all by yourself.

Shinku:
Suigintou!

Suigintou:
I promised you, didn't I?
That we would settle this one-on-one.
But first, I have to make sure your medium won't interfere.

Shinku:
You don't mean...

Jun:
Wha-what the...?
It's you.

Suigintou:
Long time no see, Jun-kun.

Jun:
What the hell do you want?!

Suigintou:
Now don't scowl at me like that.
You're going to ruin that adorable face.

Jun:
I can't move!

Suigintou:
Night time is the time for sleep.
Sweet dreams.
Perfect.
At last, everything is ready.


Shinku:
Jun!
Jun's in trouble.
I have to save.

Suigintou:
You really are such a dummy.

Shinku:
Suigintou, if you hurt one hair on his head...!

Suigintou:
I just had him fall into a dream for a while.
But you know, Shinku, when a human can no longer tell the difference between dreams and reality, I hear they become broken.

Don't be so impatient.
And you needn't worry yourself about it.
I promise you this won't be quick. I planned to torment you for a while.

Shinku:
Sometimes you say the most idiotic things.
Even without my medium, I can defeat you.
After all, you are a piece of junk.

Suigintou:
How dare you!

I think I'll make you dance now.
I wonder how long you last?

Shinku:
Everything you can do I can do.
Or had you forgotten that?

Suigintou:
Shinku!

Shinku:
Jun.
Don't let yourself be fooled.

Jun!


Jun:
My dream...

Teacher:
Class, great news.
Sakurada has been like third in the nation.
In the last two years, not one student from this math track class has failed.
Sakurada should inspire all of you to work as hard as you can.

Students:
Yes, sir!

Jun:
No, not again.
Not this again.

Teacher:
Sakurada, just stay healthy and keep your energy up.
The exam is just one week...

Jun:
No!

Teacher:
What did you say?

Jun:
No! No, not this... No! No way... Not this...
No, stop it!
Just cause.. why that?

?:
Dis you hear about the Sakurada boy?

?:
Who ever thought he'd fail?

Jun:
Stop it! Just stop it!
I don't wanna hear this!
Please stop it, stop it, stop it, stop!

Shinku:
Jun, please... please don't be fooled by the dream.

Suigintou:
It's no use.
I made sure the doorway to dreams was shut tight so he'd never get out.
He will become broken in his dreams.
If you don't want that to happen, you hand over your Rosa Mystica.

Shinku:
No.
Do you remember what Father told us?
He made it very clear when he said that as Rozen Maidens.
We're not allowed to torment or harm the humans.
I'll never hand my Rozen Mystica over to a piece of junk who disobeys him.

Suigintou:
I am not a piece of junk, you hear?
Do you have any last words for the human that you'd like me to pass along?
I'll be sending these two into his dream now, so if you have anything you want to tell him...

Shinku:
Suigintou...stop this now.

Suigintou:
No, not just yet.

You're wasting your time.
You won't get away.

Student:
Sakurada tested again to a private school, right?

Student:
Hey, Sakurada, I heard this from your big sister yesterday.

Student:
For real? Man, he was so smart too!
....
Jun:
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't want this! I don't wanna be here! I'm not supposed to be in a place like this! Stop talking to me like that! I'm not like any of you!

?:
Jeez. I thought you're alone and figured you wanted someone to talk to. Later, needlework boy.

Jun:
Shut up...Shut up...
I wanna go home now. I've had enough of this. I don't wanna be here. I don't want this!

?:
Um, well, actually yeah.

Jun:
That's Nori's voice. Nori!

Nori:
I just don't wanna baby-sit you anymore.
I don't have time to do my club activities or hang out with my friends.
I wish I didn't have a little brother like him.
Come on, mom, can you and dad just come back and take him?
What? Well, I don't think it's fair if you just dump him off on me.

Jun:
Don't say that, Nori.

?:
I had high hopes for you. Guess I was wrong.

?:
You really can't do anything, can you?

?:
You are good-for-nothing!

?:
You're just a big baby when all settled down.

?:
I'm just so tired of baby-sitting you all the time. I'm sick of it.

?:
I hate you.

?:
I am so relieved to get away from you.

?:
He's a wretch after all.

?:
I've never seen someone as useless as you.
Aren't you even ashamed to be alive?

Suiginto:
Shinku, you seemed to be in pain. Could it be that your medium's power is fading?
There you are. I'm getting tired of being "it" all the time, Shinku. How about you and I play a different game now?
