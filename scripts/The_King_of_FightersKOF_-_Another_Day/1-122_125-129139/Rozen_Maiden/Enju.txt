  Barasuishou:
My name is Barasuishou. And I am the seventh Rozen Maiden doll.

Jun:
Shinku.

Shinku:
Holie.

Barasuishou:
No Shinku.

Suigintou:
No Shinku.

Jun:
Shinku. Shinku.

Barasuishou:
Pitiful. It's so sad. You are so pitiful. You cannot fight me, can you?
How pathetic and weak and pitiful. In that case, I shall take great pleasure in breaking you.

Laplace's demon:
You do well to beware of rabbit holes so that you do not lose your nimble poise.

Jun:
Uwa- Damn it. That hurt.

Shinku:
She is Barasuishou. The seventh Rozen Maiden doll.
There are a total of seven Rozen Maiden dolls.
But in all this time there was one sister I'd never met, not even once.
My other sisters have always awaken in the same era as I.
But she is different. The seventh doll that no one knows. The last sister, Barasuishou.
And my encounter was her proof that all seven of the sisters are awake at the same time.
It's a message from Father telling us that it's the time to begin the Alice Game and bring Alice into the world.

Jun:
OK, I get it. But then, you don't really wanna fight, do you?

Shinku:
I'm a Rozen Maiden.

Hinaichigo:
Yeah. Mr. Elephant number one is clear for take off.
Paoo. Mr. Elephant, Mr. Elephant, Paoo.

Suiseiseki:
Somehow seeing that watering can really pisses me off.
And it's a can from a burgen store too. She is so mocking me.

Nori:
Time for breakfast, everybody.

Hinaichigo:
Coming.
Hina wants jam too. Hina wants jam.

Nori:
Coming up.

Jun:
Morning.

All:
Good morning, Jun.

Jun:
Are you guys here again? It's the second day in a row.

Suiseiseki:
Just be quiet, you. I came in through the front door today, so quit your complaining.

Souseiseki:
Where's Shinku?

Nori:
Yeah, when I called, she didn't answer.

Jun:
She is still sleeping.

Nori:
Oh? That's not like her at all. Was she up really late or something?

Jun:
Ah? Don't ask me 'cause I don't know.

Nori:
Come to think of it, I think she's been staying up late reading.

Jun:
Oh, really, has she?

Hinaichigo:
Jam, jam.
Thank you, Jun.

Nori:
I wonder what she's reading.

Jun:
How should I know?

Nori:
I'm off to practice now.

Hinaichigo:
See you later, Nori.

Suiseiseki:
Don't hold back because it's practice. Give them hell, you.

Souseiseki:
Shinku never came down to have breakfast, did she?

Suiseiseki:
Just forget about her.

Hinaichigo:
Hina's gonna go out and give some water to the flowers with Mr. Elephant, yeah.
Mr. Elephant, Mr. Elephant, Mr. Elephant, Mr.

Suiseiseki:
Oh, no. This is terrible, just terrible.

Hinaichigo:
Huh?

Suiseiseki:
I think I so figure it out why Shinku hasn't gotten up and it's because of you Hinaichigo.
Did you do something that make her angry? Speak up, you.

Hinaichigo:
It's all Hina's fault?

Suiseiseki:
Absolutely. Don't you know that when Shinku becomes really angry, she shuts herself up in her case and refuses to talk to anyone.
And then, once her anger has reached the boiling point, she will explode with rage.

Shinku:
Hinaichigooooo!

Hinaichigo:
Kyaaaaa

Souseiseki:
Hmm... Come on.

Suiseiseki:
Isn't that scary, Hina? Let's go up and make sure she is not mad.

Hinaichigo:
But she is still sleeping.

Suiseiseki:
Never you mind. Just go on in.
Ahhhhh. Oh, no. This is terrible. This is bad. This is absolutely awful.

Hinaichigo:
But that's just Hina and Shinku's shelf.

Suiseiseki:
Look at it. Look at it. Look at it.

Hinaichigo:
What?

Suiseiseki:
The little pouch, you see?
You see it? That's the reason why shinku is so upset. It's over the dividing line.

Hinaichigo:
Ah!

Shinku:
Hina? I'll make an exception that it allow you to borrow part of my space, but you mustn't cross this line.

Hinaichigo:
Roger that.

Jun:
Yeah? Actually, that's my shelf.

Suiseiseki:
This is much worse than I thought.
I can now see why Shinku is so angry at you.

Souseiseki:
Are you sure about that?

Suiseiseki:
Shh, quiet. Quiet.

Shinku:
Such a commotion. Hinaichigo.

Hinaichigo:
Ah, yes?

Shinku:
Please make me some tea.
I'll have it downstairs.

Hinaichigo:
Yes, ma'am. Right away. Right away.

Shinku:
Un? What is it?

Souseiseki:
We were wondering. Did something bad happen?

Shinku:
Not really.
Care to join me for tea?

Souseiseki:
Un.

Suiseiseki:
That one's as kooky as she ever was.

Shinku:
Jun, I would like it if you didn't tell the others about tonight.

Jun:
Why not?

Shinku:
If they find out that the seventh doll has appeared, the sisters wouldn't know what to do anymore and that's what worries me.

Jun:
What am I doing with this thing anyway.
There's probably nothing about the seventh doll in it.
I don't even know the language it's written in.

Tomoe:
What language?

Jun:
Wow. What the heck?

Tomoe:
Good morning, Jun.

Jun:
Yeah, good morning.

Nori:
I don't mind if you guys wanna stay a bit longer.

Souseiseki:
Thank you, Nori. But we promised we'll be home for dinner today.

Suiseiseki:
Granny has been feeling much better, and today she said she wanted to cook something special for us.

Nori:
That's great. I'm so glad to hear that.
Shinku... I wonder what's going on with her.

Hinaichigo:
Hey, Shinku? Suiseiseki and Souseiseki are leaving right now.

Jun:
Hey guys. I'm home. Ah...

Nori:
Got a minute?

Jun:
Shinku? Shinku? Aren't you going to sleep?
Shinku?

Shinku:
Am I disturbing you?

Jun:
No but... Well not exactly. I was just wondering.

Shinku:
If I'm disturbing you, I'll go downstairs and read.

Jun:
Hey, hold on a second.
Look Shinku. Don't you think you should tell everyone about what happens.
You know about the seventh doll. You're all sisters, right?

Shinku:
If I told them it would only stir up unnecessary tensions.

Jun:
Then you should just try to deal with it better.
You've got everybody worried about you.
My sister, Suiseiseki and Souseiseki and even Hinaichigo.
You keep yourself cooped up in this room all day long and you don't talk to anyone.
No wonder everyone is freaking out about you.
You know what, today they were all downstairs asking if something happened to you.
Everyone...

Shinku:
It's simple. Just ignore them.

Jun:
I can't really do that now, can I?
Listen, you may be right. But you have to consider everyone's feelings here.

Shinku:
I do not want to hear this coming from you.
Do not speak to me of such things. Have you forgotten how you behaved?

Jun:
My behavior has got nothing to do with this.

Shinku:
Perhaps, you would like to run away as before.

Jun:
I'm not running away. You're the one who is running away.
What the hell was it? I guess that's what I get for worrying about you.
Just do whatever you want.
Oh... Shinku...


Jun:
I don't get this at all.

Hinaichigo:
Shinku? Are you still mad at me?
Come on, Shinku?

Souseiseki:
Shinku still hasn't woken up?

Suiseiseki:
Like I said, she must be so furious.

Hinaichigo:
But, but Hina fixed it so it's not crossing the line anymore. Look. See. Look it.

Suiseiseki:
Oh my, such optimism.
But I'm afraid there is nothing you can do anymore that's going to soothe her boiling rage.
Souseiseki?

Souseiseki:
Shinku.

Shinku:
Even for a sister, disturbing a sleep of another is unforgivable offence, Souseiseki.

Souseiseki:
But you weren't sleeping, were you?
Shinku, we need to talk.

Hinaichigo:
Oh, we've got kicked out again. Boo.

Suiseiseki:
Oh, what did you expect?
I mean after all you are just a puny little meathead.

Hinaichigo:
That sounds yummy is it good?

Suiseiseki:
No. It's not that kind of meat, you dolt.

Hinaichigo:
Then I guess if you are out here with Hina that means you're just a little meathead too, right?

Suiseiseki:
That's exactly what I... hang on a second!
Why would Suiseiseki xxx xxx?

Shinku:
Well Souseiseki.

Hinaichigo:
Because Hina xxx xxx that's why.

Shinku:
What is it you wish to speak to me about?

Souseiseki:
I noticed you haven't been behaving like yourself at all.

Shinku:
Really?

Souseiseki:
And your behavior is affecting Jun.
As we speak, Jun is working frantically to catch up on [xxx] his studies so that he can return to school.
It isn't like you to cause him worry, given this situation. Did something happen?

Shinku:
Nothing's happened.

Souseiseki:
You know, you are a lot like your current master. Even with something bothering you, you refuse to talk about it.
You're so troublesome.
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt though.
If this is a problem between you and Jun, then I'll leave it alone. But if this is something that concerns the Alice Game, it's a different story.
If it's about the Alice Game, it definitely concerns us all.
It troubles all the Rozen Maidens, not just yourself.

Tomoe:
Hello there, Jun.

Jun:
Hey.

Tomoe:
Say.

Jun:
Yeah?

Tomoe:
There is a place I wanna visit before going home.

Jun:
What?

Tomoe:
Do you wanna come along with me?

Jun:
Oh, sure.

Tomoe:
This is it.

Jun:
Dolls, huh?

Tomoe:
Yeah, I found out about this place just a couple of days ago.

Jun:
Master Enju.

Tomoe:
Hello, is anyone there?

Shirosaki:
Yes, indeed.
Welcome. Come in. Come in.
Oh Miss Kashiwaba, you're back.

Tomoe:
Is it OK if we have a look around?

Shirosaki:
Well, we close at five. Is that enough time?

Tomoe:
Perfect.

Shirosaki:
Wow and who's this handsome jack?

Tomoe:
He is a classmate.

Shirosaki:
Could this gentleman be your boyfriend?

Tomoe:
Just a friend.
All the dolls here are handmade.
There is a craftsman in the back of the store and that's all he does.

Jun:
Wow.

Shirosaki:
Perhaps you have an interest in dolls too.

Jun:
Huh? Oh well I...

Shirosaki:
Oh, you don't have to be shy about it because you're a boy.
To tell you the truth, I'm happy you are.
These dolls are well made, aren't they?
With all these details sometimes it seems like they are alive.
Like they might actually have thoughts of their own.
A very long time ago, someone came into the store who wanted to sell some dolls.
They cherished dolls and gave them a lot of love and affection.
This person really loved them, truly loved them. But the dolls never gave anything back.
All they do is sit quietly on the shelf. Nothing is more futile than this.
That's just what this person would say.
However, I've always had a different opinion on it.
It's not that the dolls don't give anything back. They can't give anything back.
No matter how hard they try to make their feelings known to us we just can't seem to understand them.
Do you see? Anyhow, that's why I don't ever want you to hate dolls. Just keep loving them for the rest of your life, OK?
Have I made it clearly you that I really love dolls?
Haha... yeah... I was hoping for a reaction or something there.
Oh well, never mind. Come in and see us whenever you want.
Oh that reminds me, we'll have a new doll soon. It's going to be a real masterpiece.

Jun:
I ar...

Shirosaki:
Hm?

Shirosaki:
Well then. How's it coming along?

Enju:
Un... Not bad.

Jun:
I'm back.

Nori:
You were out late.

Jun:
Un.

Hinaichigo:
Oh, wow. Jun's bag is bigger than when you left today.
Is there Unyu in there?

Jun:
Uh... No, there isn't.

Nori:
It's OK Jun kun. You know it's perfectly normal for boys your age to be interested in magazines like that.

Jun:
Shut up!

Hinaichigo:
What's in the bag, Jun?

Jun:
Oh, well. It's sort of...

Nori:
You don't have to tell us if you don't want to.

Jun:
Like I was saying.

Shinku:
Welcome home, Jun.

Jun:
Um... Hey.

Shinku:
You were out late.

Jun:
Yeah.

Shinku:
Jun.

Jun:
What? It's nothing, really.

Shinku:
I went ahead and told everyone.
They know about Barasuishou.

Jun:
Really?

Shinku:
And they all assured me that.
Well that everything would be fine.
And as long as we stayed together then surely...

Jun:
That's good to hear.
So now everything is OK.

Shinku:
It is.

Jun:
It's for you.

Shinku:
What is it?
By the way, Jun.

Jun:
Huh?

Shinku:
It seems I gave you cause to worry.

Jun:
Nah, not really.

Shinku:
Well, I've decided to forgive you this time.

Jun:
You what?

Shinku:
Study hard now. There is a good boy.

Jun:
Wow? Hang on a sec.

Shinku:
You'll not touch me so casually. After all you are still my servant.

Jun:
Damn it.
"Pick me up.", "Don't touch me."... xxx...

Hinaichigo:
Hey Nori, how does this little box make music?

Nori:
Well that's because inside it there'd be little arms xxx...

Suiseiseki:
Do you really think it's going to be OK? I still can't believe the seventh doll appeared.

Souseiseki:
We still haven't met this sister. So there is no reason to worry just yet.

Suiseiseki:
You're right. But even so.

Souseiseki:
We're fine. Really.
Because we now have someone in our lives who is always watching over us.

Jun:
Are you insane? You do this every single time. Are you even listening?

Shinku:
Honestly, what a noisy servant.
Jun, go now and make me some tea.

Jun:
Why do I gotta make it.
I'm not drinking any. Hey. You want so you can go make it for yourself.

Shinku:
Make the tea.

Jun:
Why you rotten...

Hinaichigo:
The front yard's awful noisy lately.

Shinku:
I think we've been watched.

Hinaichigo:
Oh, no. Do you think it's a burglar?

Shinku:
Hinaichigo, have a look outside.

Hinaichigo:
What? Hina's scared to go by herself.

Shinku:
Not to worry. The one making all the noise is probably her.

Hinaichigo:
Oh, I think I can see an umbrella over there.
Next time on Rozen Maiden Traumend.

Shinku:
Its melody is like a dream.
