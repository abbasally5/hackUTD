  Cat : Oh! Look!

Kun-kun : You must be the culprit.

Kun-kun & Cat : Oh?

Cat : Gwah...

Lady Doll : So, Kun-kun, you've come. But I'm afraid you are too late. Prepare yourselves, for now you will die!

Cat : Ah...


Nori&Hinaichigo : Ah...

Nori : Well, that spooky doll was so scary, Oh my gosh, I can't stop shaking.

Hinaichigo: Really scary.

Jun : Why are you making such a big deal about it. We've got three spooky dolls right here.

Suiseiseki : Really, both of you are so acting like children.

Jun : Huh? What's with you, Shinku. Aren't you watching the Kun-kun show anymore?

Nori : What am I gonna do? I have to go shopping now, but I'm too scared to go alone. Jun-kun, please come...

Jun : You're a big girl! Just go already!

Nori : What? Oh, come on...

Jun : What a pain. Uh... Hmm... Maybe, I'll go watch the afternoon news. Aha!

Shinku : See here now, just hurry up and decide where you're going already!

Jun : This is great. You're scared to be alone, aren't you? What are you so afraid of. You are the supernatural phenomenon, and that was just a TV show. Ugh! Why, you! So that's how it's gonna be, huh? Rotten doll!

Nori : *sigh*

Hinaichigo : Snacks, sweets! Thank you for all the yummy food! Huh? Unyu?

Suiseiseki : Why are you staring at me? I thought you might be scared to be alone. So I've come to keep you company. Isn't it that fool of me? You should be grateful.

Hinaichigo : But Hina didn't say anything to you.

Suiseiseki : Uh...


Shinku : Open the window for me, Jun?

Jun : Open it yourself. I'm busy. Agh... Why... you... little brat...

Shinku : It seems you still do not completely understand your position here.

Jun : Oh, damn it. There. You happy now?

Shinku : Yes.

Jun : When I'm looking at her like this, she really doesn't seem like a doll.

Shinku : And what are you looking at?

Jun : Eh... What are you talking about? I wasn't looking at anything.

Shinku : Oh. Well, that's disappointing.

Jun : Eh...

Shinku : Can't you tell? Can't you see how I truly feel?

Jun : Oh, Shinku. I... Agh! Uh... ow.

Shinku : Ha. I was only joking. So there.

Jun : Oh, you crummy little...! You're always so damn pretentious, you! You demonic doll from hell? Hey, look at me! Are you listening? Shinku, hey!

Suiseiseki & Hinaichigo : Oh...?

Suiseiseki : What are Shinku and Jun doing up there?

Hinaichigo : If it's bothering you, just go find out.

Suiseiseki : No! I mean... No, it's not bothering me. I-its not like I'm afraid to go out in the whole alone or anything, really I'm not. So, you can just stop calling me a coward, damn you!

Hinaichigo : But Hina didn't say anything.

Suiseiseki : Eh... Uh! Ah! Hina, did you hear that awful noise just now?

Hinaichigo : Un-nyu? But I didn't hear any awful noise at all.

Suiseiseki : I'm sure I heard something. Horrible rattling's from over there.

Hinaichigo : Eh? Horrible rattling?

Student : Man! There's so many people playing fish, you can get what I'm saying? Even if I could...

Jun : Could you close it? Uh. Um. What? You got something to say to me?

Shinku : Would you like me to say something?

Jun : Uh.

Shinku : You're not being honest about your feelings.

Jun : Wha... Don't talk to me about being honest.

Shinku : You are the one who wants to say something, but you do not know how to say it. Your uncertainty is the thing that holds you back.

Jun : Uh... You don't know what you're talking about. You're just trying to make me mad again. But I'm not gonna [purport/fall for it].

Shinku : You are a lost little boy, aren't you? Your heart is wandering around in search of a place where it'll belong.

Jun : Eh... Um...

Shinku : Jun, you poor thing.

Jun : Ah...

Shinku : Do you even know where your heart is going, anymore?

Jun : I think I... uh...

Shinku : Hmm...


Suiseiseki : The... The... The noise came from in there! Oww...

Hinaichigo : Oh...? But there's nothing in here.

Suiseiseki : Are you sure there's nothing lurking? Agh! Ba... Ba... Ba... Ba... Ugly Baka! I mean, no,

ugly Kaba's come to kill my lovely son! Uh...

Hinaichigo : Hmm? But it's only a stuffed animal.

Suiseiseki : Huh? *sigh* I-i-it's just as I thought. I so knew it was nothing. What an irritating little hippo scaring us like that. I will turn you upside-down and make you into a Baka.

Suigintou : Ahaha, haha.

Suiseiseki : Eh... Agh! Where... Where did that voice come from?

Hinaichigo : Hina didn't say anything this time, either.

Suiseiseki : Agh...

Jun : Hey! Is someone screaming?

Shinku : Suiseiseki!

Jun : Ah...

Shinku : Ah... Suiseiseki! Suiseiseki, what happened to you?

Suigintou : Ha-ha. Hello, Shinku. How are you?

Shinku : It's Suigintou.

Jun : Huh?

Suigintou : I became terribly bored just now. So I decided to pay you all sisters a visit. Are you not happy to see me?

Shinku : As usual, your arrogance is stifling.

Hinaichigo : She is hurting me. Make her stop, Shinku.

Shinku : Release her immediately!

Suigintou : Mhm... If you want to get her back, you'll have to come and get her yourself.

Shinku : Uh... Wait, Suigintou. You mustn't!

Hinaichigo : Help me...!

Suigintou : I'll be waiting for you, Shinku. Ta-ta! Ha-ha.

Shinku : Uh... Uh... Jun.

Jun : Uh...

Shinku : Jun.

Jun : Eh...

Shinku : We're going.

Jun : Hey, wait! Can't you see she's trying to trap you? Just calm down and think about it.

Shinku : I assure you I'm quite calm. Even if it is a trap, I have to go in there and save Hina, and stop
the Alice Game, once and forever. Come now. Wake up. I require your assistance. I don't think you should
come just now. You're still damaged from that scuffle we had earlier. Uh... Mhm... All right, then. Come
along, little one.

Jun : Oh-oh. Right, I'll go. You don't have to twist my arm.

Suiseiseki : Uh...

Jun : Uh... Hm. Uh!

Suiseiseki : Uh... Eek! I-it seems you leave me with no choice. But I'll make an exception this time and graciously come along.


Jun : Mm... Uh... Wow... Where are we? Why's that look so freaky here.

Shinku : It's Suigintou's world.

Jun : What?

Shinku : Careful. Watch out above you.

Jun : Ugh! Um... Ugh!

Suiseiseki : Agh...

Jun : Ugh! Uh...

Suiseiseki : I've sooooooo arrived!

Shinku : There really wasn't any need for you to come along.

Jun : Hey, what is your problem?

Shinku : It's time to go now. Somewhere in this world, Suigintou is waiting for us.

Jun : There's nothing but a bunch of crumbling houses here. This is such a weird place.

Shinku : This world is Suigintou's creation. It reflexed what lies deep in her heart. Like her, this world shows poor taste.

Jun : Oh, yeah. It's not much to look at. It sure is a lonely world, isn't it?

Shinku : Uh.

Suiseiseki : Uh! Ah... That poor little thing. This is so terrible.

Shinku : Who knows that the same fate awaits us as well.

Jun : Don't say weird things like that. It's not like you.

Shinku : Yes, you're right. Winning the Alice Game is the only option any of us has. That's all there is.

Jun : Ah... Uh... But then, if you lose the Alice Game, what's gonna happen to you?

Shinku : I will either become an ordinary doll, or perhaps, I will become junk like her.

Jun : What's that supposed to mean? What the hell's this Alice Game, anyway? What's the point in fighting if you could end up like this, huh?

Shinku : You don't understand.

Suigintou : What's the point, he asks? To see Father, of course.

Shinku : Uh.

Suiseiseki : Agh...

Shinku : Suigintou!

Suigintou : Mhm... Welcome. Yes. Welcome to my field of battle, sisters. *sneers*...


Hinaichigo:Shinku~~!!

Suigintou:All this trouble for a stupid child like her...

Suigintou:Oh, Shinku.You're such a fool..

Hinaichigo:Hina's not a stupid child! Only stupid people call others stupid!

And that means you're the stupid one, Suigintou! Stupid! Stupid!

Suigintou:You don't quite understand the position you're in right now, do you?

Suigintou:If I wish to break you, I could do so at anytime~.

Suigintou:Or...do you wanna see what it's like to be a piece of junk like her?

Shinku:I've come as you requested. Stop this nonsense and return Hinaichigo.

Suigintou:I'll turn this trifling thing over to you, but first, you will give me your Roza Mystica.

Shinku:What a foolish demand. If I hand over my Roza Mystica, that would mean admitting defeat in the Alice Game.

Shinku:And I will not lose the Alice Game to you..

Shinku:Now then, Suigintou! I will end this fight!

Suigintou:As impudent as ever..

Suiseiseki:No~~!

Suigintou:This is my world that you're in. And my will dominates everything in it, including your lives.

Shinku: Don't, it's too dangerous.

Suigintou:My, what a splendid group of knights you have there.

Suigintou:Actually, I recognize that one. You look awful, my dear.

Suigintou:The stench of failure hangs over you like a pall.

Jun:What's going on? Shinku?!

Suigintou:I can't think of anything more hideous than those who are incomplete.

Suigintou:That is why I will turn you all into Junk now.

Jun : Those things just keep coming at us.

Suiseieki : Let's retreat for now.

Suigintou : You can't.

Suiseieki : I can't breathe , I can't breathe, I so can't breathe.

Shinku : Should tear you apart if you stand there. That's enough, now get out of the way. Leave while you can!

Suigintou : [Very well/Farewell], little one.

Shinku : No, stop!

Jun : Shinku! Uh. Shinku!

Suigintou : I will say it one more time. Your Rosa Mystica. Hand it over to me?

Shinku : I would much rather die!

Suigintou : Well, now if that's what you wish, Shinku, I shall let you die.

Suiseiseki : Shinku!

Suigintou : Farewell, ugly little Shinku.

Jun : Shinku... Shinku... Shinku. Shinku!

Shinku : This power... How is this happening? Uh. It can't be. Jun...?

Suigintou : A boy like him...? Impossible. I will not accept this.

Shinku : Holie!

Suigintou : No. No. This can't be. How can I lose like this in my own world? It can't be... That human is giving her this kind of power...?

Shinku : Uh, Suigintou!

Jun : Oh, man. That was a close one.

Hinaichigo : Thanks for saving me, Jun.

Shinku : Right then. I must put an end to the Alice Game forever.

Jun : That really wiped me out. Feels like I was hit by a truck or something.

Hinaichigo : That's because you used a lot of your power.

Jun : Oh, man. I don't care what happens anymore. Um. Uh, poor litte guy.

Shinku : We made sure to bring all of him back here.

Hinaichigo : Unyu, he's all in pieces.

Suiseiseki : What a cruel thing for her to do.

Jun : I know it's just a doll, but I [hit/hate] [swing/seeing] on like this.

Shinku : Poor thing. This brave little one is lost forever.

Jun : You mean he's dead?

Shinku : No, Jun. There is no death for dolls. Rather we go somewhere far, far away. Existence is simply the idea we have of ourselves. It's the idea that this little one is so he is, and the awareness that he has of being here. If this one believes that he does not belong in this place, it is no difference in ceasing to exist. That is when he becomes an object. And I can tell you it's a very lonely, very dark, very cold, and very sad thing. Jun?

Jun : I know it's got to be here somewhere. Hmm. Found it! Hey, Shinku, let me see that clown.

Shinku : What are you going to do with him, Jun?

Jun : Right. Now I'll do my best. I won't be able to stitch him up exactly the way he was, but, I don't feel right leaving him all torn up like this. Yeah.

Shinku : Ah. It's amazing. Jun, I had no idea you're capable of such things.

Jun : Eh... Well, it's not that big of deal, really. I mean, I used to sew a little back in the day. I'm no prob. [what/but] I [come/could] home on my own.

Shinku : Could it be? Uh.

Jun : Hey, wh-what's going on? Why's this happening?

Shinku : It's incredible. You've called him back to us. His lost soul has returned to his body. You've brought him back from the darkness.

Suiseiseki : I so cannot believe this is happening. The little four-eyed brat really did it.

Hinaichigo : Amazing. Amazing. Jun, you're amazing.

Shinku : Once a soul is parted from its body, it is almost impossible for it to be returned to it. It takes someone of considerable skill. Jun, you are wonderful. Thank you. Watching you, it was as if your fingers were playing the most beautiful melodies. Well, I suppose for a servant you've certainly earned enough place for today.

Jun : Um. Why, you...

Shinku : Uh...


Nori : I'm home, guys. And I brought a lot of yummy snacks for everyone to munch on.

Hinaichigo : Nori! Snacks, snacks, snacks!

Suiseiseki : I am so having some.

Jun : For a minute, there I thought you were pretty cool, but I was wrong again. Aren't you gonna come snack out with us? Um, hey! Y-you okay? Hey, what's wrong? Hey, Shinku. Shinku, wake up! Shinku... Shinku. Shinku? Shinku!
