Once upon a time, there was a maiden.
The maiden wore tattered clothes and was called Cinderella, but with the help of some magic she became a beautiful princess and got to dance with the Prince.
Then at the stroke of midnight the maiden ran away leaving a glass slipper, and she returned to being Cinderella once again.
The Prince went to great lengths to find this maiden, which he did, and took her as his wife.
Yet a thorny question arises.
Did the Prince really fall in love with the maiden?
(go to great lengths to do: ～するためにあらゆることをする)

----A part----

Kraehe: That's right! I am a crow.
And I alone am a TRUE prima donna, Princess Kraehe!
I take what I desire, by force if need to be!

Fakir: Princess Tutu.
Will you not cease the restoring of his heart, then?

Tutu: No. Because that is the Prince's wish.
Do you intend to shatter his heart again?

Fakir: If I do?

Tutu: I won't allow you to do.

Fakir: Do you kill me, then?

Tutu: What?

Fakir: Could you kill?

Tutu: That's..... not.

Mytho: STOP!

Fakir: [??Why don't you/I wonder??] raven stands before you strike?! (?)
You can't guard Mytho with just heart shards!

Tutu: But, Kraehe, she was suffering.

Fakir: Then that was your chance!
I would have finished her!
If it came down to it, I could even kill you, too!

Mytho: Tutu, run!
Why must you hinder me from regaining my heart, Fakir?

Fakir: Hinder?

Mytho: My heart.... I want to get my heart back.
No matter what fate might then await me, I just....
Fakir, you're trembling.
Why?

Fakir: Is that...?

Duck: Why?
Why in the world did I go back to being a duck?
I know! Quack!
What? Why don't I turn back into a girl?
The pendant!?

Drosselmeyer: This is good, Little Duck.
After all there is nothing more boring than a perfect heroine.
When the spell's broken down, she's just being a duck.
Now, show us what a duck will do.
What a mere duck is capable of.

Duck: What will I do?
Without the pendant I can't become a girl nor Princess Tutu.
Where could it have gone?
My pendant....

Fakir: You just try and come for it, Princess Tutu.

Mytho: Fakir, you're trembling.

Fakir: .....Absurd.
Where are you, Princess Tutu?
Hey. Hey!


Duck: Quack? QUACK!
Oh, no!
I must have fallen asleep!

Fakir: You're that duck from the other day.

Duck: Oh! The pendant!
Quack! Quack!

Fakir: What is it?
Have you taken a liking to this?

Duck: Quack! Quack!

Fakir: I do envy your innocence.

Duck: Quack..... QUACK!
Quack!
He's wearing it! Hmmmm!

Fakir: Perhaps Princess Tutu is among these girls.

Crocodelia: Mr.Cat, do you smell a duck?
I smell a tasty duck!

Mr.Cat: Hush, Miss Crocodelia!

Fakir: I'm thinking too hard.

Duck: Mytho's so handsome.
He was always handsome, but now, he's even more.
Is it caused he's got some of his feelings back?

Pike: He's so handsome, isn't he?

Lilie: Duck will be sad she missed it.

Pike: She must be hurt and pretty bad from the rejection, huh? (?)

Lilie: I'd love it if she is.

Pike: I hope she's coming back to class, soon.

Lilie: Right, right, before she fully recovers.

Pike: Well, you know she does recover quickly.

Lilie: Yelp!

Mr.Cat: Miss Pike, Miss Lilie, if you continue to chitchat during class, I will have the both of you marry me together!

Pike&Lilie: Oh!

Mr.Cat: Well, well, I'd add finally to Miss Duck who is absent today, so all three of you can get married together!

Pike, Lilie&Duck: Oh!

Mr.Cat: You dance splendidly, Mr.Mytho.
You're beginning to convey more emotion over straight(?) technique.

Mytho: Yes, sir.

Mr.Cat: So, you're in love?

Mytho: Am I?

Mr.Cat: I can tell, you see.

Mytho: In love?

Mr.Cat: Very well.
I'll hold a special class on being in love after school for you.

Mytho: Yes, sir.

Duck: Mytho's in....

Mr.Cat: Being in love is a wonderful thing, but there are some things you must be careful about.
In particular, during puberty, self-control is important.

Duck: Quack.
The pendant! The pendant!
It's not here!
Don't tell me he took it in there with him?!
QUACK!
Here he comes!
What would I do? What would I do?
So he did have it!
Is he injured?
No, it's a birthmark.
The pendant!
If I could just reach it.....!

Fakir: Mytho, you really don't know anything about regaining your heart.
And what [the hell it tells].

Duck: What?

Fakir: Ah! Huh?!

Duck: Huh?

Fakir: That damned Kreahe!
Is this to say she doesn't see me as a brat!

Duck: Mytho and Kraehe's wedding!
With Fakir for a witness....


Mytho: "Tonight at midnight..... at the church......"


Duck: What's Fakir..... The smith? Quack!

Fakir: Karon...

Karon: Fakir.

Fakir: Where is the sword?

Karon: You haven't met for many ages, yet no greeting's for me?
There are plenty of swords in the shop.

Fakir: No, THAT sword!
The Lohengrin Sword.
I have need of it.
(have need of : ～を必要とする、～が入り用である◆【語法】"have a need of"は誤り。)
I have to protect Mytho from the crows now.

Karon: I can't give it to you.

Fakir: What?

Karon: You know that sword is meant for the knight.
(meant for : 《be ～》～のために生まれてきた［作られている］)

Fakir: You promised that You would let me have it!

Karon: That was when you were a child.

Fakir: Mytho has been regaining his heart.

Karon: Huh?

Fakir: And Princess Tutu has already appeared.
The crows are returning as well.
The legend you told me about as the child is swiftly becoming reality.
If so, this means that I am the knight from the story reborn.
(as a child: 子どもの［幼い・幼少の・小さい］時［頃］（に）)

Duck: Fakir is a knight reborn?


----B part----

Fakir: If I'm a knight, it should be fine [if I use] the Lohengrin Sword.
(和：騎士ならば、ローエングリンの剣を使ってもいいはずだな。）

Karon: Fakir, why can't you just leave Mytho be?

Fakir: Leave him be?

Karon: You'll be much better off forgetting this accursed tale.
(better off: 《be ～》〔～した方が〕もっと良い状態になる、一層暮らし向きが良くなる［向上する］、いっそう楽［安楽・裕福・幸せ］である)

Fakir: It's too late to be saying things like that.
It was on the same day that you took me in after my parents died when you told me, remember?

Karon: This mark of yours is the same as the legend that has been passed down among our people.
I'm sure you'll grow to be strong.
It's a sign that you are the reincarnation of the brave knight who guarded the prince.

Fakir: In time, it became a source of pride for me.

Fakir(kid): "If it was to protect the people, the Prince never feared being injured and [whine the] duty."
Wow! That's great!
And then, my destiny was suddenly set in motion.
(set in motion: 運転する、動かす、発動する)

Fakir: Karon! His heart! I don't think it's beating!!

Karon: Ah!

Fakir(kid): Karon?

Karon: The prince, who had lost his heart! Mythos....

Fakir(kid): "Mythos" means a person of character from the legend. Did you know?

Mytho: No.

Fakir(kid): You don't know anything, do you, Prince?

Mytho: Sorry.

Fakir(kid): "Prince" is a weird name. How about we call you "Mytho"? That would be a cool name!

Mytho: OK.

Fakir(kid): Oh, right! You'll be "Mytho" starting today!

Fakir: Mytho had no emotions.
But whenever he saw something weak suffering, no matter what dangers, he would [lash] trying to protect it.
*lash【1他動】 ～をむち打つ/～を駆り立てる

Fakir(kid): Mytho, it's dangerous!
Mytho! Oh! MYTHO!!

Mytho: Fakir.....

Fakir(kid): Stupid!
You don't think, do you?
You do useless things like that!

Mytho: Sorry.

Fakir(kid): Forget helping other people!

Mytho: Yes.

Fakir(kid): You just listen to what I tell you.
From now on, I'll be protecting you.

Fakir: I will protect Mytho.
That was the promise I made.

Duck: Protect Mytho?
But then, why did you try to shatter his heart?

Karon: This [fool/whole] ぜあいん(therein?) that you're attempting now is not for Mytho's sake, it's for your own sake, isn't it, Fakir?
お前のしている事はみゅうとのためなんかじゃない。自分のためだろう、ふぁきあ！

Fakir: What?

Karon: The time to fight is drawing closer, are you sure you're not afraid of sharing in the same wretched fate as the knight from the story?
*draw close 近づく
*draw closer ジリジリと詰めよる、近づいていく、近づいて来る

Fakir: I'm not.

Karon: You kept calling the Prince a good for nothing to make sure his heart wouldn't be restored, knowing he loved to dance you enrolled him at the academy to keep him busy.
You are too afraid to fight.

Fakir: NO!

Karon: There is no way that you'll protect Mytho with the way you are now!

Fakir: Stop it!

Karon: Just give it up!

Fakir: Enough! Any sword will do!

Karon: This ends now. Got it?

Fakir: Yes.
I may be afraid of risking my life, just as you've accused me.
But I want to protect him.
The pure-hearted Mytho who's always risking himself.

Duck: There's a shard around here somewhere.

Karon: Fakir!

Duck: I don't know any more.
What's right? What's wrong?
The only thing I can tell is Fakir isn't lying.
I didn't see it.
But this whole time Fakir's been the same as me.
No. He might care about Mytho even more than I do.

Fakir: Ah, it's you.
Sorry, you've caught me at a bad moment.

Duck: Quack....

Fakir: You are crying that for my sake?

Duck: Quack?

Fakir: Take it.
You wanted it, didn't you?
I would not acknowledge you, Princess Tutu.

Duck: Fakir.
Oh, that's right, there is a shard at Karon's house!

Karon: Was this really the right thing to do?

Heart Shard: There's noway to know that.
No matter what you do, you('ll?) only regret it.

Karon: You're right.

Duck: Just as I thought!

Drosselmeyer: Come now, if you don't hurry, the wedding will start without you.

Tutu: Mr. Karon.

Karon: Huh? Princess Tutu?
Could it really be?

Tutu: Please, come dance with me, Mr. Karon.

Karon: So that tale truely has been back to life here in our day.(?????)
物語は本当に動き始めていると…。
But I still do not know what it is that I should do?
I've always regretted telling Fakir the legend.
I regret having hurt Fakir.
The only things I can do for that child is things that I regret.

Tutu: No. You should be able to have faith in him.

Karon: Have faith in him?

Tutu: Yes.
If Fakir journeys down the path (with?) his heart's convection, I do not believe he'll regret it whatever the outcome.
Why not have faith in Fakir?

Karon: Have faith in Fakir.

Heart Shard: I'm the feeling of regret.

Karon: Princess Tutu.
Thank you. My doubts have cleared.


Fakir: A book is not a thing to be feared.
Turn this page with your own hand.
Noway, noway!
Will I succumb to such a miserable fate?
(succumb 【自動】屈服する、負ける、圧倒される、敗れる　死ぬ、倒れる）
(字幕： I.. I... Will not succumb to such a miserable fate!)
I'll change it!


Tutu: My prince.

Mytho: Princess Tutu.

Tutu: I've brought you a shard of your heart.

Mytho: Thank you.

Tutu: Are you going to Kreahe?

Mytho: Yes. I feel I mustn't run away.

Kreahe: Thank you, Princess Tutu, for going to the trouble of returning the shards of my hasband's heart.
But whether you return them or not makes no difference now, for the Prince will become mine tonight.
I will have you bear witness as a [XXXXble] sacrifice.


Karon: I've been waiting.
Do what you must.
Leave no cause for regret.
(cause regret 悔いを生む、後悔の元となる)

Fakir: Karon....

Karon: Go, my son....

Kraehe: What say you, Princess Tutu?
(What say you. 読み上げて◆裁判官⇒陪審員)
(字幕：What do you think, Princess Tutu?)
Aren't we just perfect for each other?
I prepared a special seat for you.

Mytho: Tutu!

Kreahe: First, we'll have a dance.
I could do away with Tutu this very second, but let's celebrate.
(do away with 〔不要な物を〕処分する、捨てる、排除する)

Tutu: Mytho...

Kraehe: My beautiful Prince, you are mine.

Mytho: Kraehe, who are you?
Why must you demand I be yours?

Kraehe: Because, it is fate.

Mytho: Fate. Whoes fate is that?

Kraehe: It matters not whoes fate it is.
Fate cannot be changed.
Not by anyone.

Fakir: Back, you filthy raven!

Mytho: Fakir.

Kraehe: So, the coward has arrived.

Tutu: Fakir!

Fakir: I won't suffer you to be near Mytho no more!
(suffer 〈古〉～を許す)

Tutu: Kraehe, STOP!

Mytho: What's wrong?
Why are you in such pain?

Fakir: She has... the stone back?
What is it?
Hurry and be gone!?
Or do you have a burning desire to settle things now?
(burning desire 強い［強烈な］願い［願望］、激しい欲望)
(settle things once and for all 完全に決着をつける、きっぱりけりをつける)

Tutu: I don't have any wish to fight you.


Duck: I have to hurry, or Fakir and Mytho are gonna catch up to me!
If I'm caught wondering around this late, they'll be suspic....
WHAT!? NOWAY!!

Fair: Hey, YOU!

Duck: Tee-hee!

Fakir: TEE-HEE, NOTHING!
What are you doing out this late?

Duck: What am I.... What am I doing?
Well if I'm out this late, what eles could I be doing but THAT?

Fakir: THAT?

Duck: You know THAT! Well, see you.

Fakir: Hey, what's that.... WHAT?
WAIT!!
The pendant....!

Duck: GOOD NIGHT, Fakir!

Fakir: Princess Tutu....?

Duck: What'll I do?
Could it be he's found out?

Drosselmeyer: Oh, dear, it would appear that your identity has slipped out.
What will you do, Princess Tutu?


Fakir: I'm surpprised, to be honest.
Of all the people, I've never expected it was you.

Mytho: Tell me, Duck, do you know about Tutu?

Duck: The one Mytho wants to see isn't me, it's Princess Tutu, but....

Rue: I wish I colud've stayed Rue forever free of Kraehe's memories.
But now....

Edel: The name of this gem here is "Love".

Heart shard: I'm feeling of love.

Kraehe: The feeling of love is it?

Tutu: NO! Kraehe, STOP!

Drosselmeyer: All you children who love stories, come gather around.
