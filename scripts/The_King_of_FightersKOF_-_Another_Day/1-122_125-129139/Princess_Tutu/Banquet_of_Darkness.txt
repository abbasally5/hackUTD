Once upon a time, there was a handsome slave.
What bound him were not heavy chains, but the love of a princess.
Every day, every night, the princess whispered her love to the slave.
And the slave responded in kind.
Bound body. Bound emotions.
The slave or the princess, which of them is really the one who is unable to move?

Fakir: How did I?
Let go of me. I can walk by myself.

Tutu: No!

Fakir: That's right. Princess Tutu helped me. And then....
Binding my wounds?
What kind of a useless!
(字幕: What an unnecessary....)
(日本語：余計なことしやがって)
Hey!

Tutu: Fakir. How are you?

Fakir: Don't give me that.
Why are you still Tutu?

Tutu: What? Ah...
I thought it might be bad if I went in the boy's dorm I'm looking like normal.
(日本語：男子寮に入るのに普段の格好じゃまずいかなあって)
Ah... Was that weird?

Fakir: No.
Sorry for having troubled you with this.

Tutu: It was no trouble.
Oh! You aren't able to get up then.

Fakir: Hey, listen.
This doesn't mean I've planned of cooperating with you.

Tutu: But you are going out to look for Mytho, aren't you?
We could at least cooperate on that, right?
Let's look for Mytho, together.

Kraehe: You can forget about everything.
All you need to fill that void is here in my arms.(?)
(日本語：そしてすべてを私で満たしていけばいいのよ)
No one shall enter here.
It'll just be you and me.
So I am the only one that you have to give your love to.
Now, tell me that you love only me.

Mytho: I love only you, Kraehe. Nobody else.

Kraehe: Honestly?

Mytho: Honestly.

Kraehe: What's that? How much?
If you love me, then, smile for me.
Don't you remember the festival?

Mytho:How?

Kraehe: Have you regressed to the doll it used to be?
Because I was through the piece of your heart.
Have you shut away all your other emotions because of that?
If that's true, then fine.
If you're going to love someone else, better for you not to love anyone.
It's your fault, you know.
You wouldn't so much as look at me, when I love you so much.
No, you're not the one to blame.
That's right.
If you hadn't begun to regain your heart, everything would have progressed like it should have .
I wouldn't have had to remember that I.....that I was really a crow.
It's all the fault of that nuisance's.
[Pests do] like that.
(邪魔なんだもの)
(字幕:Because she IS a nuisance.)
The sooner we rid of her, the better for us.
The single prince has no need of two princesses.
Right?
Herr Dorosselmeyer?

Dorosselmeyer: What!? Impossible!
Did I just hear called my name?

Kraehe: You're watching from somewhere, I guess.

Dorosselmeyer: Oh-ho!
You had gushed(?) to call on me.
(私を呼ぶとはあなどれん)

Kraehe: That's enough to offer you the best story ever.

Dorosselmeyer: What!? Really?

Kraehe: The best of stories demands the best of endings.
And for that, I need a worthy stage.

Dorosselmeyer: You are right!
And I have a stage I've been saving.
A lake that no one has visited in 200 years.
[Do without me to] show you the way.

Duck: Mytho!
He's not here either.
He's not around.

Fakir: Of course, he is.
It's just that we haven't been able to find him.

Duck: Huh...Oh!
The lesson room!

Fakir: Huh?

Duck: He might be dancing there right now! Hah!

Fakir: And why is that?

Duck: Huh?
Because Mytho loves to dance and that's where....

Fakir: I don't think he'll be there.

Duck: But...but the last time he was taken, he was back before we knew it, right?
So I thought it might be the same this time.
Besides, I can't think of anywhere else.

Fakir: We can check it out.
We've nothing to lose.

Duck: Huh! Oh, wait for me!

Duck: The school sure is quiet on Sundays.

Fakir: I guess.

Duck: Ah... Is that Mytho?

Mr.Cat: Meow!

Fakir: Hey!

Duck: Huh?

Fakir: He could see you!
(字幕：He can see you.)

Duck: What? Where? What? What?

Mr.Cat: Meow!
Who dares to intrude upon my Sunday practice?!

Duck: Oh!

Mr.Cat: Oh Miss Duck!
This time, I will punish you for disturbing my tireless effort, I will have you marry me right now!

Duck: I'm so sorry!

Mr.Cat: Meow!

Fakir: What are you doing?

Duck: But...but....

Mytho: Hello, there.

Duck: Mytho? So Mytho is OK!
Thank goodness! He...

Fakir: Wait!

Mytho: You know the story of the Prince and the Raven?
It's a tale of a brave prince who battles a monster raven.
There was a knight whom the prince trusted.
But the same knight was torn in two by the claws of the raven without the knight even wielding a single blow with his sword.
A useless wretch, who could only talk of protection.

Duck: Ah...

Mytho: That's why the prince suffered such hardships.
The raven had leapt out of the story.
Alone he pursuited it.
And alone he sealed it away.
Of his own will, he used a forbidden power.
That's right.
The prince threw his sword and took his very own heart out of his body.

Duck: What?
How ????
He took it, he took it out himself?

Rue: Oh, it's true.

Duck: What? Rue?!

Rue: You don't know anything, do you, Duck?
What do you know about Princess Tutu?
 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:1:&lt;h4&gt; 
Duck: Princess Tutu?
Nothing! I mean ....I don't know!

Rue: You see in the Prince and the Raven, Princess Tutu is only presented in a few sentences.
A miserable existence which none of the characters of the story wanted to take on.
An insignificant existence which even the story left by the wayside.
Someone who could never hope to catch the prince's eye.
A little added flourish...

Duck: Oh...

Rue: Poor thing.

Duck: But Rue...Why are you telling me this story now?

Rue: So, you still haven't figured it out.
Rue doesn't even really exist.






No way! You can't be! Because you're my friend!
We used to chat together and dance together and.....














When did she get?








Come. Now let us go.

Duck: This place? Ah, Miss Edel?

Fakir: It's locked.

Edel: You can go to where the prince and Kraehe are from here.

Fakir: An entrance here?

Edel: Go on.

Duck: Thanks a lot, Miss Edel, for always being so kind to me.

Edel: This is not kindness.

Duck: Huh?

Edel: Puppets follow the pull of their strings.

Duck: Puppets?

Edel: Yes, I am a puppet.
I possess neither feelings nor a heartbeat.

Duck: But miss Edel, you've taught me all sorts of things and you've been so friendly.
That's why I think of you like a....

Edel: You think of me like that because that was the role I was appointed.

Duck: Oh...

Edel: My orders end here. Now, go on, Duck.

Fakir: Whose orders are that?

Duck: Miss Edel.

Edel: Now, go on.
Duck?


Duck: Miss Edel, thanks a lot.
We'll go now.

Edel: Duck.
Such a warm face, such soft skins.

Duck: Miss Edel. I....

Edel: Now, you must hurry.

Fakir: OK, let's go.

Duck: Uh-huh.

Dorosselmeyer: Good grief!
If you use a puppet too long, they start getting attached to things other than strings, things like people's feelings.
(↑自信なし)

(日本語：人形も長く使いすぎると、人の心に興味を持ったりするから、厄介だ）。
Don't you forget.
Your role is to add a glow to the story in my place.
That's about all you're capable of doing.
Anyhow, not knowing your place in the world is dangerous, you know.

Duck: Scary! Owowow!

Fakir: IDIOT!　Walk towards the middle!
You're already careless enough as it is.

Duck: Wow! This place is kind of incredible! Oh!
OK! OK! Eyes forward!
Owowow!

Fakir: Ah... you really are Princess Tutu, aren't you?

Duck: Well, yeah! What about it?

Fakir: I thought Princess Tutu is more....you know....

Duck: Huh?

Fakir: Never mind.



Duck: Say, Fakir?

Fakir: What is it?


Duck: Nothing. Never mind.

Fakir: What the heck?
If you didn't want to say, just keep your mouth shut.

Duck: Oh! No it's not like that.
But just you know, I don't think you're no good as a knight or anything.

Fakir: What are you getting at?

Duck: I'm not really trying to get at anything.
It's just..... I didn't think you were very nice when we first met, but now I feel like I know you a little better.

Fakir: I'll say this right now, I have no intention of cooperating with you.
I'll help Mytho in my own way, end the story.

Duck: I know that....


Duck: Wow, you know?

Fakir: Hmm?

Duck: Never mind, it's nothing.

Fakir: What is your problem?
Quit stopping in the middle of your sentences!

Duck: Well, the truth is, that I never thought about things like...
What do I like about Mytho?
That first time I saw Mytho, it was mostly me just thinking he was handsome.
But when I looked closer, his eyes looked so lonely.
And I thought if I became Princess Tutu, then maybe I could do something for him.
At the start, that's all.

There really was to it.
But now, I.....
Wow!

Fakir: Damn it!

Duck: Fakir!

Fakir: RUN!

Duck: Wow! [????]

Fakir: IDIOT!

Duck&Fakir: Wow!



Duck: S...sorry. Are you hurt [???it off???]?

Fakir: It's a miracle I'm not.
What is this place?
I guess we just have to climb back up.

Duck: Oh! We might be able to get out through the water.
I could go check it out if I became a bird, but.....

Fakir: It's covered with moss, I doubt we can climb it.
Damn....

Duck: Since it's Fakir.... Fakir?

Fakir: What is it?

Duck: One time when I had lost this necklace, you held onto it for me, remember Fakir?

Fakir: Huh? What about it?

Duck: Would you hold onto it for me again?

Fakir: What the heck is this all about?

Duck: Here.

Fakir: Huh?

Fakir: What was that? Where did she go?

Duck: Quack!!

Fakir: A DUCK?

Duck: Quack.

Fakir: She just.....
So then, this wasn't a pendant for her to become Tutu?
It can't be!! That duck......
"Sorry, you've caught me at a bad moment..."
Umm....

Duck: "But just you know, I don't think you're no good as a knight or anything."

Fakir: She saw me crying!
Noway! She isn't drowning now, is she?
Can ducks even drown though? Knowing her, she might.
IDIOT!

Duck: QUACK!! Quack, quack, quack!!

Fakir: Why did you...!
WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME?
YOU SHOULDN'T HIDE THINGS LIKE THAT!

Duck: Quack?

Fakir: It's playing dirty! You...

Duck: Quack!

Fakir: Ah!

Duck: YOU SAY THAT!
But [it was not] like I revealed it to you because I wanted to!
It's just easier when I am a bird to check [?smooth?]!
Huh?
You saw?

Fakir: NO!
More importantly what did you see?
Should you be bringing back at first?

Duck: How can I [???win???]

Fakir: DON'T STAND UP!


Duck: We can make it to the other side through the water.
The water [??down??] that way smells different, so there's probably a lake up ahead.
See? It looks like we go still deeper. That's probably where Mytho is.
Are you OK about [there], Fakir?
What is it?

Fakir: A duck is Princess Tutu, huh?
I have something you want to hear.
Back when I was still a brat, when I was reading "The Prince and the Raven" to Mytho, the things he showed the strongest intrest was neither what happend to himself nor the raven, but what happend to Tutu about whom only a little was actually written.
He wanted to hear over and over again the part where Tutut turns into a speck of light and then vanishes.
His sudden desire to regain his heart most likely stems from Tutu's role in returning it.

Duck: But they were saying Mytho took his heart out himself.

Fakir: That's the kind of guy he is.
For you see, protecting the small and the weak, that is Mytho's single greatest desire and to fulfill that, he'll cast off any regard from himself.
[???? Even when he lost his heart, it couldn't be taken out of him ???]
(心を失っても、そのことだけは忘れなかった）
That's Mytho.

Duck: Hum...

Fakir: Let's go!

Duck: Right!


Kraehe: Finally you've come. [I've been/I'm] tired of waiting.

Duck: Oh! MYTHO!

Dorosselmeyer: Welcome to the stage I've been saving.
Now, tell me the best story that wasn't ever told.
Tell it to me with no regard for your lives!

Tutu: Please, stop this malevolence now!

Kraehe: Agreed, let us put an end to it.

Tutu: Oh.

Kraehe: The prince's feeling of love is right here.
The heart that loves people, that loves all the world.
It belongs to no one.
And I wonder you or me which one of us will be chose.
Whose words will it be drawn to once we've laid our hearts bare?
If the shard chooses you, I'll return it and the prince.
So then, why don't you speak to it of what's in your heart?
Well, Princess Tutu?

<<<<<<< B part


Tutu: But why do we have to fight each other in this way, because we both.....

Kraehe: Ultimately, you are only borrowing the power of Princess Tutu.
You are merely a sham of a princess, hey, Duck? ←?

Fakir: You are alone, and one nobody else could accept Princess Tutu's fate.
So smile.

Mytho: You are my true princess.

Kraehe: Yes, I am your one true princess.

Tutu: The real me is just a duck with no powers of my own.
But if I have you, I can transform!
Drosselmeyer: All you children who love stories, come gather around.
