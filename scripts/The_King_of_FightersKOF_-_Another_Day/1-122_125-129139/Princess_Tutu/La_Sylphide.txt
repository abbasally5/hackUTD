  Once upon a time, there was a maiden with wings of freedom.
A man in love with this maiden thought, "If I could just bind those wings, we would never have to be apart even for a moment."
But when the man wrapped the maiden's wings in a magical shawl, the wings immediately fell to the ground and the maiden died.
The man did not know that the maiden's wings were the source of her life.

Drosselmeyer: At last, all the characters needed for the story have been assembled: a prince without the heart to love, a knight who fears death, a villain without resolve, and a princess who cannot express her love.
Something's still missing though.
All right, you, go on!
And this time, don't you become interested in people's emotions!

(mare-guma): Excuse me. Won't you please take this?
Edel: It's quite lovely.
(mare-guma): The name of this gem is... "Love."
Edel: "Love"?
I would advise you not to let it go.
It suits you.
(mare-guma): No... I had no right to be holding on to such a thing.
Someone like me... never did.
Edel: I see.
(mare-guma): Thank you.

Fakir: Princess Tutu... is her!
Tutu: I don't have any wish to fight you.
Fakir: It doesn't matter who Princess Tutu is.
I will protect Mytho in my own way!
I'll be the one guarding him from the clutches of that raven!
Without fear.

Duck: I wonder if he really knows now.
Pike: You've been sighing all morning.
Lillie: Poor thing!
The scar of rejection must truly run deep!
run deep根深い、〔憎しみ・不安などが〕根強いものになっている
Pike: You seem happy.
Lillie: Who, me?
Duck: Thanks for worrying about me, but it's not about being rejected or anyth--
Lillie: It's OK, Duck!
You don't have to tell us! We know!
Pike: Anyway, revenge! Revenge!
Come on! You've got to do it!
Lillie: That's right! You'll do it, won't you?
At any rate, you'll have to get him to notice you!
Pike: Yeah! And that means a present!
Lillie: Oh, that's good!
Then you'll see how he feels about you!
Mytho: Really?
Pike: Fakir, too!
Duck: Fa...kir...?
Mytho: So giving someone a present will reveal their feelings about you?
Pike: Oh, no! You were listening?
Lillie: He heard us!
Pike: Give a present now and he'll see your ulterior motive!
Mytho: When you say present, what kind of thing do you mean?
Lillie: He's probing us!
Pike: What do we do? How do you think we should answer?
Mytho: Say, Duck. What if... it were you?
Pike: Duck would take anything, really!
Lillie: That's right! She'd take anything!--anything she can get!
Pike: As long as it's given with love!
Lillie: Even gems or bars of solid gold!
Mytho: Love? There needs to be love?
Mr. Cat: Mr. Mytho, I held a special class yesterday on being in love. Perhaps I need to hold a special class on love itself!
Mytho: Are you saying that there's a difference?
Mr. Cat: Of course there is!
If you do not grasp that, you will not be able to get meow-meowrried...!
Would you care to sit in as well, Mr. Fakir?
Fakir: No, thank you.
Mr. Cat: Then Mr. Mytho, let us go.
Gifts are perfectly fine, but such things as anti-flea collars could be rude, so discretion is necessary.
Duck: Does he know... after all?

Duck: Fakir!
Fakir: I want to ask you something.
Follow me.
Duck: What'd you want to ask me?
Fakir: Princess Tutu.
Duck: (Gasps.) Qua..!
Fakir: You are, aren't you?
Duck: Oh...
Fakir: I'm surprised, to be honest.
Of all the people, I never expected it was you.
Duck: I want to ask you something, too.
Just like me, you're fighting to protect Mytho, aren't you?
Then why do you keep trying to shatter his heart all the time?
Why?
Fakir: That is something that has no bearing on the present situation, understand?
The tale can no longer be halted.
Duck: The tale...?
Fakir: If you wish to restore his heart, then go ahead.
No matter what the outcome of your little heroics, I will protect Mytho.
Duck: Then why don't we work together? And that way--
Fakir: No, thank you.
Duck: But why not?
Fakir: To put it simply, I don't trust you.

Rue: Mytho... if you regain any more of your heart, you'll grow distant from me, I know it.
I am a crow, your enemy. Even though I love you so much.
I wish I could've stayed Rue forever, free of Kraehe's memories... but now...
Edel: Would anyone like some gems?
Would anyone like a gem to give your loved one as a gift?
Welcome.
Rue: Aren't you...?
Edel: It's been a while, Rue.
Mytho: As a gift?
Edel: Has this one caught your fancy?
The name of this gem here is "Love".
Mytho: It's "Love"?
Rue: I think it's beautiful.
Edel: Since you seem to like it so much, I shall give it to you.
Mytho: Are you sure?
Edel: I am. Please take this as I have no use for it.
Rue: Why don't you accept it, Mytho?
Mytho: Mmm.
Edel: And yet, though this gem is strong, it is easily scarred. Though beautiful, it is easily tarnished. If fought over, it may prove deadly.
Please use care in handling it.

Rue: You really like it that much?
Mytho: Mmm.
Rue: So, you're going to give it to me, aren't you?
Mytho: (gasps) Rue, sorry. This is....
Rue: I was just kidding!
I see. I wonder who the lucky girl is?
Mytho: That's not....
Rue: Could I see it for a second?
Mytho: Sure.
Rue: It's beautiful.
But it seems there's something important missing.
I wonder what?
Mytho: What? Really? Oh!
Rue: I'm sorry. I know it's precious to you.
Say, would you let me borrow it for tonight?
I'll fix it up and make it even prettier.
So that you can secure the heart of the one you love.
Mytho: OK.
Rue: The results ought to please you.

Kraehe: Mytho, I will not let anyone else have you!
I'll never hand you over!

Drosselmeyer: Very good! Very good!
Another necessary component of the tale has been added.
Love filled with hatred.
Oh, this is an interesting device, yes!

Duck: Fakir found out. But it's kind of strange -- I actually feel relieved now.
Fakir: To put it simply, I don't trust you.
Duck: Fakir's always thinking by himself; deciding by himself; fighting by himself; even... even crying by himself.
He won't show me his true face.
It was warm there, in Fakir's arms.
I bet that's the real Fakir.

Mytho: Fakir.
Fakir: Yes, what?
Mytho: I'm thinking of giving a gift to Tutu.
Fakir: Is that so?
Mytho: You're not angry?
Fakir: Do as you wish.
Mytho: Don't turn your... sword against Tutu again.
Please, Fakir, I want you... to promise me.
Fakir: I can't make that promise.
