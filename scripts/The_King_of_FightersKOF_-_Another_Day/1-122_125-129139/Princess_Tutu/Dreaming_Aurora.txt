Once upon a time, a witch laid a curse which cursed a princess into an eternal slumber.
One day a young man appeared, intending to awake her.
But then a voice whispered.
"Awaken the princess from her sleep, what a cruel thing to do."
For what if the princess wishes not to receive the kiss of awakening, but rather to continue to sleep forever?
(直訳：もし、姫が目覚めの口付けを受け取ることよりも、永遠に眠り続けることを望んだら、どうなるのでしょうか？）
(日本語：姫が望んでいるのは目覚めの口づけではなく、このまま永遠に眠り続けることなのでしょうか？）

>>>>>>Apart>>>>>>

Fakir: So, you're awake.

Mytho: Fakir.

Fakir: What is it?

Mytho: I wonder...what it is I think of you, Fakir?
When I think of Rue, when I think of you, Fakir,
and when I'm thinking about Princess Tutu, each one makes me feel different.
But I don't know what names I should give these feelings.
Tell me, Fakir, don't I need to know what they are?

Fakir: Stop brooding on nonsense!
(brooding on: くよくよ, worry about, mope around）

Mytho: But....

Fakir: You listen to me, you useless good-for-noth......
(good-for-nothing)
What's this? You're trembling.



Duck: I just couldn't sleep somehow.
I saw Mytho smile.
I guess for Rue at least, he'll smile like that.
There's no way that Mytho doesn't need a heart!
Hm? Mytho?
I'll get your heart back for you.
Ah, Fakir!
Just what is he plotting?
Tricking Mytho into obeying him.
Or is it something else completely.
Whatever you're plotting, it's no use.
Princess Tutu will get all of Mytho's heart, and...
Quack! Quack! Quack!

Pike: Duck! Duck! Let's go!

Lilie: Maybe she mistook the time and left early again.

boy: A theater troupe?
man: Says it's the Eleki Troupe.
woman: Never heard of them.
man: Sleeping Beauty, huh?



Paulamoni: We are touring ballet company.
Starting the day after tomorrow, we will be performing "Sleeping Beauty" at this theater.
Please come and see us!
Till then, adieu!



Mr.Cat: Today we receive special permission for both the boys and girls to come to the Eleki Troupe's rehearsal for observation purposes.
I hope you take this chance to get a taste of foreign ballet and use that to help get you off the ground......
Don't do you think so, Miss Duck?

Duck: Um, well, you see......

Mr.Cat: Don't you think?

Duck: Oh, yes! You're right! I don't think so, either.

Mr.Cat: You don't think so?

Duck: Yes, you're absolutely right! I don't think so at all!

Mr.Cat: About what do you not think so?

Duck: Yes, well, about wanting to marry you. Was that wrong?

Fakir: Mytho, you go back to your room.

Mytho: Um..


Pike: Mr.Cat's all depressed now.

Lilie: He may not bounce back (on usと聞こえるが……).

Duck: Umm....

Pike: You're sad 'cause Mytho's not here.

Duck: Mm-hm...

Pike & Lilie: Oh!

Duck: Fakir came alone.

Pike: Do Fakir's actions bother you?

Duck: Mm...

Pike & Lilie: Oh!

Pike: You said you weren't interested in Fakir!

Lilie: She's at that age! What's wrong with that?

Pike: It's just wrong! You're all lovey-dovey for Mytho, aren't you? Aren't you?

Lilie: You don't even know your own place! How cute!

Pike: So, which one do you really love, huh?

Lilie: She loves them both! She's two-timing!

Duck: LOVE?! It's really n-n-not anything like that with.....! Ah!

Paulamoni: That's quite some energy!

Duck: Ah, so....

Pike: Man! She's one lucky, Duck!

Lilie: Three-timing?!

Paulamoni: I'm Paulamoni, the leading lady. Nice to meet you.

Mr.Cat: Please, accept our deepest thanks for sharing your time with us today. Miss....

Pauｌamoni: Let's dispense with formality.

Mr.Cat: I agree.

Paulamoni: Make yourselves at home.

Mr.Cat: Oh, it's come, it's finally come! The premonition of love! Rejoice, my heart, my greatest desire!

Paulamoni: I'd like you to meet my husband, Paulo.

Paulo: Nice to meet you!

Mr.Cat: Oh!

Paulamoni: Now, come right on in!

Girl: Oh, so pretty!

Pike: Just so lucky! You got to be held like a princess!

Duck: I can't breathe!

Lilie: Oh, Duck, if all you wanted was to be held, you know I would've held you.

All: Oh?

Girl: I'm afraid of the dark!

Paulamoni: Oh! Hold on one sec!

Duck&Pike&Lilie: Electric eel?

Paulamoni: Say hello to our troupe leader and electrical guy.

Duck: Troupe leader?

Paulamoni: Steady supply! I have to hit it at just the right angle.

Paulo: Say, was our troupe leader really an eel?

Paulamoni: What? Come to think of it, before we came here.... No, that can't be, right?

Paulo: Well, it'll save on the power bill.

Paulamoni: That's true.


Fakir: Is Rue Princess Tutu?

Paulamoni: What?

Paulo: What's wrong?

Paulamoni: Oh... It's nothing. I'm sorry.

Paulo: Really? Then, let's continue!

Paulamoni: Say, just watching is boring, isn't it? Let's see someone else!

Paulo: Huh? Paulamoni, this is too sudden!

Paulamoni: What's the matter? I want to see!

Paulo: But....

Mr.Cat: Certainly! I should show you the result of my lessons! Now, are there any volunteers?

Pike: Your chance to earn brownie points!

Duck: Huh?

Lilie: Losing won't hurt you!

Duck: NO, NO, NO! I can't, I can't, I can't!

Mr.Cat: It cannot be helped then? I will select someone, Miss Ru.......

Paulamoni: YOU!

Mr.Cat&Duck: WHAT?

Paulamoni: What do you say?

Duck: I can't do it! No way! No way! NO WAY!

Mr.Cat: There you have it!  Even she herself says she can't, so let's not force her.
Please enjoy another student's dance! If you'd like, I'll perform myself!

Paulamoni: Ah... I guess it was too sudden. I'm so sorry.

Mr.Cat: No, we'll dance! We were wanting to dance. We were.

Paulamoni: Really, it's all right.

Duck: That sure scared me. Huh? It's a heart shard! Where...was it?

Paulamoni: We'll have a run-through tomorrow, so please come watch!

Mr.Cat: We will! Gladly!


Paulamoni: I'm always nervous when I get up on stage, but I've never felt like this.
When I was a child I saw Princess Aurora and instantly fell in love.
Even after awakened, she still seemed to be in a dream.
I wanted to become like that someday.
So, I've danced the part of Aurora all this time.
I began to see that it was to no use, no matter how I polished my technique.
I simply wasn't born with the same talent..
I knew my dream would never come true.
But....
No matter how depressed I'd been, it'd never taken me like this.
What's the matter with me?
Am I afraid of performing?

Paulo: Hey, Paulamoni!

Paulamoni: Yes!

Paulo: We're making dinner. Will you help me?

Paulamoni: Sure.

Paulo: Mmwa.

Paulamoni: Mm!

Paulo: Mmm! That smells great!
Though if we don't feed our troupe leader soon, we'll have an outage!

Pauramoni: Mm-hm-hm。

Paulo: The premiere... Should we postpone?
There is something on your mind, right?

Pauramoni: Thanks for worrying about me.
But.... I don't want to trouble everyone else.
Don't worry. I can still do it.


Edel: Would anyone like some gems?
Beautiful precious gems.

Duck: I didn't know you sold gems, Miss Edel.
Well, Fakir said Mytho doesn't need a heart.
But that can't be right!
He's weird! Real weird!
I mean really, Mytho doesn't know how it feels to be in love, even though Rue truly loves him.
Isn't it sad?

Edel: Is it sad?

Duck: You think so, don't you?

Edel: Is it sad for Mytho? Rue? Or for you, Duck?

Duck: What? I'm not really.....
Anyway, no matter what Fakir does to get in my way, I will get all of Mytho's heart back to him.
I may not be able to make Mytho happy like Rue can, since I'm just a bird.
But at least I can do this!
Huh? Pretty!

Edel: The name of this gem is "dream".
Yet who is happier a dreamer who lingers or one who has awakened?

Duck: Huh. Who would be?
Anyway, what's this gem called?

Edel: "Hope".

Duck: This one?

Edel: "Adventure".

Duck: And this one?

Edel: "Mystery".

Duck: Okay What about this?

Edel: "Author's bypass". (字幕："The author's convenience".)

Duck: Huh.... Strange name.
Okay! In any case, my wish is to get Mytho to smile again!
And that's all! BYE!
That's right! I'm going to work harder and get all the shards of Mytho's heart to back for him!
All right! Go for it, Duck!
OH!
Yes, I'll do my best!

-----------------A part ---------------------------
-----------------B part ---------------------------

Fakir: Mytho.

Mytho: Yes.

Fakir: Go on tomorrow's field trip.

Mytho: I can?

Fakir: And make sure that you ignore what Rue says.

Mytho: Yes.

Fakir: I'll be there, too.
Now go to sleep.

Mytho: Yes, Fakir. Thank you.

Fakir: Ah... Idiot.



Paulamoni: Ah.

Paulo: You know the girl you called on today, I honestly wanted to see her dance, too.
She had this glow, sort of a mysterious and innate charm, you know?

Paulamoni: An innate charm. Yes.

Paulo: I'm sure she's pursuing a wonderful dream.
And chances are that she's also in love.
I can tell.

Paulamoni: You sure can tell a lot.

Paulo: Yeah. Because you were the same when you were younger.

Paulamoni: You'll always wake from a dream.
No, you must wake up.

Paulo: In that case, you shouldn't play Aurora.

Paulamoni: That was rather blunt.

Paulo: Well, the Aurora you've been aspiring to, is the kind of girl who continues to dream even after she's woken up from her dream, correct?

Paulamoni: Huh.

Paulo: But you're afraid to even dream.

Paulamoni: Because I can't become that Princess Aurora.

Paulo: Sure. There are some dreams that won't come true, but there's no rule that says you can only have one dream.

Paulamoni: What?

Paulo: My dream is this.
To enthrall people all over the world with your dancing!

Paulamoni: Ah!

Paulo: And to do that, I've even thought of the perfect program for you.

Paulamoni: Perfect for me?

Paulo: So Paulamoni, what do you say to sharing a dream between the two of us?

Paulamoni: I've no idea, you really wanna do all this?

Paulo: I haven't woken yet from my dream or my love.

Paulamoni: Paulo! Thank you, Paulo!
I'll dance my final turn as Aurora in this town!

Paulo: Yes, and it'll be your best!



Paulamoni: Please do not worry.
No matter how the wicked witch may curse me, I will surely never prick my finger on the spindle.
For though I may dream and dance all my days, I will never lay a hand on a spinning wheel.


Rue: That smile.... Was that because he was dancing with me? Or....


Paulo: Um? Our leader is hopeless.
All right, everyone, let's take a break!


Paulamoni: Mr. Cat.

Mr.Cat: Meow? Oh! What! Can I help you?

Paulamoni: I'd like to speak with you.

Mr.Cat: What?! Would you like to speak with me?

Paulamoni: Yes.

Mr.Cat: NO! You mustn't! Oh, unless you insist, that is in which case....

Paulamoni: The girl from yesterday, I was hoping you might allow me to watch her dance.

Mr.Cat: Oh.

Paulamoni: I want to see if I can find out what it is that my performance is lacking.

Mr.Cat: Are you sure?


Duck: Are you sure?
So why did she pick me?

Mr.Cat: Yes, I agree.

Duck: But someone else would be....

Mr.Cat: Yes, I agree.

Duck: But I'm really bad at this, too.

Mr.Cat: Yes, I know.
This is an earnest request from Ms. Paulamoni.
Don't worry, please dance to your heart's content.
Even if my dreams of love were to end because of it, I will never hold that most painful fact against you.



Pike: Been a while since her last pinch!

Lilie: I've waited for this!



Rue: Say, Mytho, why don't you partner with her for the pas du deux?

Duck: What? With Mytho?

Fakir: No. Mytho will stay. I'll go.

Duck: Why? Why did you have to butt in like that?



Paulo: Oh! Our leader's approval gauge is maxed-out.



Fakir: Rue, what are you thinking?



Fakir: Pathetic.
Let me take this chance to make things clear.

Duck: What?

Fakir: Stay away from Mytho.

Duck: Y....you stay away from him!

Fakir: You're an eyesore!



Paulamoni: That's it!
This girl's dance is hardly elegant, but it's overflowing with her own individuality.


Duck: Ah! Mytho's heart!
Owowow....

Paulamoni: Are you all right?

Duck: What? Oh, yes!

Paulamoni: I'm sorry for forcing you.
You did great! Are you hurt?

Duck: Ah... NO! I'm feel fine!
An... Um.... Where is the bathroom?

Paulamoni: Just go out those doors, turn left and there is at the end of the hall--

Duck: Thank you!

Paulamoni: Huh.


Duck: Ah!

Dorosselmeyer: Uh ho!
Is the prince's heart running away now?
I wonder what it could be so afraid of, Princess Tutu?


Tutu: Please wait!
Why do you run away?
Now, let me bring you back to where you belong.

Heart shard: I won't! I'm scared.

Tutu: No! You have to!

Heart shard: But why?

Tutu: You just do.

Heart shard: What for?

Tutu: So Mytho can smile.
I can take you back.
Now, come here. COME HERE!

Heart shard: NO!

Tutu: Now, go back. Return to Mytho!


Mytho: YEOW!

Fakir: MYTHO!

Rue: A shard's been returned!

Fakir: What?!

Mr.Cat: Everyone, please stay calm!


Duck: Huh?

Fakir: Hang on, Mytho!
Damn that Princess Tutu!

Duck: QWACK!!


Mytho: I'm scared....

Fakir: Calm down.

Duck: What's happened to Mytho?

Fakir: It's all right.
I'm the only one here.
What's wrong?
What scares you?
Tell me.

Mytho: Tutu....

Duck: Ah!

Fakir: Ah!

Mytho: I'm afraid of Princess Tutu.
I'm afraid of Princess Tutu.

Duck: What? That can't be!


Dorosselmeyer: Fear. Uncertainty.
Yet another heart shard has been returned, but the Prince seems rather sad.
I wonder what's going to come of this little incident.


Duck: Why this? I just returned a shard of his heart.
Why was Mytho crying?
Why was he suffering in such pain?
What's going to happen to him?
I didn't.... I just wanted Mytho to smile.
That's all I wanted.
Was it bad?
Was it wrong to want that?
Have I done..... something terrible to Mytho?


Dorosselmeyer: That's right.
This is how the story moves along.
In a direction most undesirable for all concerned parties.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<B part

Duck: Being Princess Tutu is meaningless!

Rue: The only one I've ever had eyes for is Mytho.
I'm still far from having loved him enough.

Tutu: I promise to never appear before you again, so don't worry.

Mytho: These are the feelings of loneliness and of sorrow.

Tutu: Who are you?

Kraehe: Princess Kraehe!

Fakir: I see! So you've finally made an appearance.

Kraehe: I will give you nothing. I will let you do nothing.

Drosselmeyer: All who love stories, gather around.
