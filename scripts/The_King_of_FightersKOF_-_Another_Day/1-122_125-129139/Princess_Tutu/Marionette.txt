She was imprisoned in the demon king's castle.
Her freedom taken from her.(文になってない。字幕はAnd with her～,で句)
The princess had no choice but to dance like a puppet to the tunes set by the whims of her sadistic captor.
One day a hero came to fight the demon king, seeking to save the princess.
However, there was no way the hero could attain the victory.
For you see, the hero did not know that he himself was a puppet that the demon king had created.

A part >>>>>

Tutu: Fakir!

Fakir:Tutu!!

Tutu: Where am I? Gears? Why are they all stopped?
What am I doing in the place like this? What should I do now?
Fakir!

Fakir: Drosselmeyer... the man who toys with everyone's fates.
Is he out there somewhere, laughing as he watches her and Mytho suffer?
Where is she right now? Is she where Drosselmeyer is?
Where the hell is that?

Used Bookstore Owner: By now the story may have progressed to the point where we can do nothing.
In that case the only one who can fight is he who carries the same blood.

Fakir: Do you mean I should write, then?
There is no other way that I'll be able to save her at this point.

Tutu: Where is the exit? I must leave this place.
I know where they are.
The other heart shards are in the five gates around the town.
I must return them to Mytho soon.
And then Mytho will return to the story, and I'll go back to being ..... a duck.

What's this? A puppet?

Puppets: Yes! That's right!
You are in the puppet world now!
Who's this?
You are Princess Tutu, aren't you?
It's Tutu!
It's Tutu!
It's Princess Tutu!
I wonder what Tutu [is to xxx]!

Tutu: Do you know where this place is? Please tell me!
Why was I brought here? Was there some reason?
Why has everything in this place just stopped?

Pappets: [??That's rather your responsible of you when you say not knowin' where you are.??]
(日本語：なんとまあチュチュはここがどこだかわからないって？)

Tutu: Then please! Tell me!

Pappets: Tutu says she wants us to tell her.
Princess Tutu's in a pickle!
A picke!

Tutu: Answer me!

Pappets: You are the one who stopped everything, Princess Tutu.
Get it, you know?
This is the inside of the story.
And you are the one who caused the story to stop.

Tutu: Caused the story to stop?　I did it?

Pappets: That's right!
Tutu stopped the story!
Tutu stopped all of this!
She stopped them!
She stopped them!
Tutu stopped them!
Tutu stopped them!

Tutu: Stop it!

My body! It won't move!

Fakir: Hear the voice which is voiceless and see the shape which is shapeless....
What am I supposed to do with that? What should I write?
Damn it!
I have to write! I have to write!

Raven: Where is the heart? Daughter, hurry up and fetch me a heart.

Kraehe: Dear father.
Now that I have gone and dyed the prince's heart in your blood.
He'll definitely become mine right, father?

Raven: Are you saying you cannot trust what I tell you?
#could not に聞こえるが、そうすると文全体の時制が変？

Kraehe: Oh, no! Of course not!

Raven: And to think on top of that, you only consider yourself and not me, your father.

Kraehe: That's not true! I love you, father! But...

Raven: It's only natural for a daughter to love her father!
You are pathetic.
To think you can't even get the love of the prince in the story.
At this point you no longer have any value to me as a daughter.

Kraehe: Father!

Raven: You should at least give me your heart.
So that I might be restored to some degree however small.

Kraehe: Father! Forgive me! I'm sorry!

Raven: I have not given you leave, Kraehe!

Tutu: Have I turned into a puppet? Did I do something bad, is that why?

Is that? UZURA!

Uzura: Oh! I found Tutu zura!

Tutu: What are you doing here, Uzura?

Uzura: I followed you zura! What are you doing zura?

Tutu: I think .... I've somehow turned into a puppet.

Uzura: A puppet zura?

Tutu: Um, er, it's not that I don't like being a puppet. It's just......

Uzura: Oh!

Tutu: Uzura!

Uzura: Oh.... Puppets zura?

Tutu: Uzura!

Drosselmeyer: Jete entrelace.

Tutu: My feet are moving on their own!

Drosselmeyer: Foutte rond de jambe en tournant.

Tutu: Mr.Drosselmeyer? Is this the world where Mr.Drosselmeyer is?
How hold..? Why?
I'm just a marionette dancing exactly as I'm told....
I don't like this. I want to dance more.. more freely!

Drosselmeyer: Such thinking is mistaken.
Marionettes are at their most free when they're being manipulated by their strings.
You won't be able to leave this place unless you [??(字幕:acknowledge that)??].

Uzura: What's a puppet zura?

Fakir: [Well, her] name is Uzura.
Karon, he made her from the wood some Edel that didn't burn out.


Ahiru: From miss Edel's?

Uzura: Does that mean I'm not Uzura zura?
Oh! What's this zura?
Oh, it turns zura!

Mytho: Caw caw...
Hello, Kraehe. Come here, won't you?

Kraehe: My prince...

Mytho: Come. Come now. Why the haunted look? Let's enjoy ourselves.

Kraehe: Ah....

Mytho: I want to get the all my feelings back. The sooner, the better.
Once that's taken care of, I can give the raven my heart.

Kraehe: Ah! What are you saying? That's the joke, right?
The Prince is fated to marry no one but me.

Mytho: Marry you? You, who in spite of being a crow have that ugly human body?
That's the joke. The only thing that you're allowed to do is love me.
The moment you dyed my heart with raven's blood, our fates were immediately sealed.

Kraehe: But I did just what Father told me to.
Then I.... Then I'd rather just take his heart out again...
But I don't have the prince's sword.
If I thrust this sword into the prince, he might die..
That's fine. If that happens, I too will....

Mytho: I have one last favor to ask, after you've ripped out my heart, I want you to kiss it and dye your lips crimson with my blood.
What's the matter? Can't you do it?

Autor: Well, looks like you've reached to your limit.
I'll admit picking Drosselmeyer's grave to write at was pretty sharp, for you.
But if the words you should be writing aren't coming to you without you even having to think....

Fakir: Could you please be a little quieter?

Autor: [Maybe think, at this moment I have for in the point that I want to write.??]
It's ironic.

Fakia: Faster! I've got to write faster!

Drosselmeyer: Good grief! You'd be better off letting the story pull you along like a good boy.
[Well, it's up no real consequence.] [You're written thread] little duck I'll be coming for you soon.
(日本語：やれやれ、おとなしく物語りに操られていればよいものを。ま、それはそれでいいけどね。さて、そろそろ会いに行くよ、あひるちゃん！）
(字幕:Dear me. You'd be so much better off if you'd only be a good boy and let yourself be manipulated by the story...)
(字幕:Well, but that's fine too. Well then! I'll be coming to see you very soon, Little Duck.)

B part>>>>>

Tutu: Who's there?

Drosselmeyer: Welcome to this quite little gap in time my dear, Princess Tutu.

Tutu: Mr. Drosselmeyer! So, what did those puppets mean when they told me I stopped the story?
I'm just....Um...trying my best to completely return the Prince's heart to him.

Drosselmeyer: Tell me. Have you discovered all the locations of the scattered heart shards?

Tutu: What? Um.... I'm not quite sure, but I think that they are hidden in the five gate around the town.

Drosselmeyer: My congratulations to you.

Tutu: What? So if I return those five shards to him, the Prince will go back to normal and defeat the raven and then....

Drosselmeyer: No, no! That would be hopelessly boring! You're a story character, you can do better than that!

Tutu: Character? But how can that be? I'm really only a duck.

Drosselmeyer: Correct. But you're inside the story right now. Everybody is. Take a look.

Tutu: Rue.... Fakir..... Mytho!

Drosselmeyer: Everyone's suffering, you see. This is the way it has to be.
Tutu has something she should've suffered over, too.
The choice to confess her love and immediately vanish, or never to confess her love and thereby forever lose the prince.
(愛を告げて光となって消えるか)
(字幕:Confess your love and vanish as a speck of light)
(それとも愛を告げずに王子を失うか)
(字幕:or never confess your love and lose your prince....)
(チュチュにもちゃんと苦しむべきことがあるはずだよ。)
(字幕:I believe you have something to suffer over too, Tutu)

Tutu: Never mind that,I....!

Drosselmeyer: And you have to think returning the prince to normal is more important to you than your own problems!
You are a much different duck now than the one you once were whose sole desire was for the prince.
(お前はもうあの時、王子のことだけを思っていたあひるとはちがうんだよ)

Tutu:Ah!

Drosselmeyer: You should be desperately in love with the prince and want to marry him!
Am I wrong?

Tutu: I just...

Drosselmeyer: That's right! You shouldn't fight what's natural.←?
It's only natural to want to make the prince yours, and yours alone.
There's nothing to be ashamed of. I know. How is this idea, ??????
(たとえば、どうだろね)
(字幕:How about this, for instance?)
You pretend you haven't realized that the remaining heart shards are hidden in the five gates.

Tutu: What?

Drosselmeyer: After all, nobody else has realized, so if you do that, there will be nothing to part you from the prince.

Tutu: But....

Drosselmeyer: My dear duck, if you can't think at least on that level, you never leave here.
And the story will stay stopped, too.
What's this? Tutu is here, and yet the gears are moving? What is going on?
Oh! Interesting! The gears are starting to turn backwards. The story will now double back on itself!

Tutu: What?

Uzura: Wow! Wow!

Drosselmeyer: I never once envisioned something like this!
(日本語：これは私も考え付かなかった！）
(Even I didn't think of this!)
How interesting! I wonder what will happen.....

Kraehe: I don't understand anymore.
I believed that my marriage to the prince was the fate the story had decided for us.
Was I wrong? What should I believe? Whom should I believe?
I want to go back to that time before I've remembered everything.....
That time when I was Rue!

Woman: Help me!

Rue: I'm sorry father! Don't take my heart! Forgive me!

Kraehe: That was....

Rue: I'll be a good girl!

Mytho: Get behind me.

Kraehe: That's the prince back when I first met him.

Mytho: You don't have to worry anymore.

Rue: Does it hurt?
I brought water?

Mytho: Thank you.

Rue: I have to go.

Mytho: Go where?

Rue: [Back home] to my father.(文法も変）
(字幕:To where my father is.)

Mytho: Who are you?

Rue: My name is....

Raven: My pitiful daughter who despite being a crow has been born into an ugly human body.

Rue: I'm not a crow! I'm a person!
I'm Krae...., Rae.... Ree.... Rue...., my name is Rue!
Can I come see you again?

Mytho: Yes.

Rue: Good bye!

Fakir: What's going on!?

Autor: The story is flowing backwards!

Fakir: What!?

Autor: Stop it! Hurry!! Stop it with your pen, Fakir!


Fakir: Story is doubling back?

Tutu: I've experienced a lot of new feelings since becoming a human girl.
In the beginning I didn't think my feelings for Mytho would grow so much.

Fakir: I will never go back!
Not that time when I clung to my sword and said nothing but words that prize Mytho's freedom!

Tutu: All of my feelings belong to me.
All feelings are precious to whom it belong.
And I am nobody's marionette.

Fakir: I will no longer coward before fate!

Tutu: Whatever it takes!

Fakir: We'll guard him!

Tutu & Fakir: Together!

Fakir: Just now, I heard her voice!
That's right. She has changed me.
I can write! I can write a story about her!
But wait. This words...., they are not my words.
What are they?

Uzura: Oh! Everything stop moving zura!

Edel: The story doesn't want to go back any more than that.

Uzura: Who's that zura?
Oh! Are you a puppet zura?

Edel: I am a puppet. And I am you. You are also me.


Uzura: I'm not Uzura zura.

Edel: I am a puppet who could not have a heart.
But you.

Uzura: Wow!

Edel: Now, go back to where Duck is.

Uzura: Wait zura!

Fakir: These are all her feelings.

Tutu: I want to go back.
I want to go back and help Mytho!
I want to leave this place!

Fakir:Her feelings for Mytho are spilling up through my hand and out onto the page.
At that time, the knight who cast away his sword and called her name.
In order to lead her out of the darkness!
DUCK!!!!
DUCK!!!!

Tutu: Fakir!
Fakir!


Edel: Then... go on!

Uzura: Oh!
Wow!

Fakir: Duck!

Tutu: Fakir!
Did you write a story about me, then?

Fakir: Yeah.

Tutu: Thank you.


Drosselmeyer: What is this?
For her to leave here without my permission...
She's not to be underestimated.
And thanks to this, the story is still stopped.
Oh? It would appear that there's one who is still doubling back.
You are going to find out something you wish you hadn't.

Kraehe: Now what?
Am I?

Man: What's wrong?

Man2: My daughter's been kidnapped by the crows!

Man: What?

Man3: We'll start searching over there!

Man2: Thank you....

Kraehe: That's there.... That's me?
The man....

After all this....
I'm not the raven's daughter.
I had a mother. I had a father.
I'm a normal human being.

Mytho: What a wretched fate.

Rue: Ah!

Drosselmeyer: The story is finaly started moving.
My, my ..... Thank goodness, thank goodness.

Uzura: Oh. So that means I'm not Uzura zura.
My heart isn't lovey-dovey zura?
Where am I zura?
Wow! I'm high up zura!

<<<<<B part

Rue: My love has done nothing but made you into this.
I have no right to love you.

Edel: Duck doesn't know. There is a thing she doesn't know.

Duck: Just now, I was afraid of Mytho.

Uzura: Even if I put water on you, you won't change back zura?
Fakir: That's why I'm asking for your help, Autor?

Duck: So this..... is the raven!

Mytho: This frail love, I must protect this love.

Drosselmeyer: All you children who love stories, come gether around.
