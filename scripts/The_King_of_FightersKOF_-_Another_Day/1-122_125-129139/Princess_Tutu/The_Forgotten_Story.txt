  Once upon a time, there was a young woman.
The young woman was to marry a groom chosen by her parents, and not her sweetheart, whom she loved.
She knew that her groom loved her very much, but did her sweetheart care for her even more than that?
The young woman wasn't certain.
In the end, after wavering between the two of them, the young woman even became unsure which one of them she really loved.


Fakir: How long have I been searching for a way to return Mytho to the story?
All this time, I just took to hand whatever books struck me.
So why do I chose only books whose endings are missing?
Why?
What meaning is there the books whose missing endings?

Raetsel: Found you!

Pike: Jeez, Duck, can't you go one day without getting stuck with cleaning duty?

Lilie: Of course, she can't.

Duck: Sorry.

Pike: Seriously, Duck....

Lilie: No way!

Duck: What?

Lilie: Duck, you mustn't look!

Pike: This is a shock!

Lilie: Definitely...

Duck: Why do you...?

Lilie: No, don't, Duck!
You mustn't look! Right there!
See?

Duck: Fakir.

Pike: He smiled!
That totally ruins his bad-boy appeal!

Lilie: We need him to become a full-fledged delinquent!
（そうよ、とことんやさぐれててくれなきゃ！）

Pike: Who is she defanging finally [??cast off??] the fantastic Fakir?!
（ふぁきあさまを骨抜きにする女って、何者！？）
(字幕：Who is this woman who can take the bite out of the wonderful Fakir?!)

Duck: Huh?

Lilie: An older woman lover, huh?

Pike: We can't say that for certain yet!

Lilie: That's right!
Duck, you should have an unreasonable hopes!

Pike: Find the truth!

Pike & Lilie:[??????thatabovebrave???]
(勇気を出して！)
(字幕：Be brave!)

Duck: Wow!

Raetsel: My.....

Fakir: Huh?

Duck: Ummmm.

Fakir: Hey!

Duck: Oh, hey, Fakir! Ammm....

Raetsel: Are you a fiend of Fakir's?

Pike: Calling her just a "friend"?
That's a confidence she's got there!

Lilie: Oh! It's like I can see Duck's crying face before me!
I can't sit any longer!

Duck: We are all just on our way to the ice cream shop. Right?
Um... They were just here....

Raetsel: You're an interesting person.
My name is Raetsel.
What's yours?

Duck: Mine's Duck.

Raetsel: Well, Miss Duck.
Fakir and I are heading over to his house right now.
Would you like to come along?

Duck: Why?

Fakir: Raetsel!

Raetsel: Why not? Right?

Duck: Ah....

Fakir: I'm impressed you found out where I was.

Raetsel: You can hide anything from me, Fakir?

Fakir: There's still......

Karon: Fakir, welcome home.

Raetsel: It's been a long time.

Karon: Raetsel!

Raetsel: May I come in?

Karon: Of course.

Uzura: Who do you go well with zura?
（あんた、誰とお似合いズラ？）
(字幕：Who do you go well together with zura?)
It's a new lovey-dovey zura!
(新しいラブラブずらー！！）

Raetsel: Karon, is this your...?

Fakir: Last I saw you Mytho and I just entered the academy.

Raetsel: That's right. I must admit, I was really lonely then.

Duck: Oh!

Raethesl: Here you go.

Duck: Thanks!

Raetsel: It's all right.
I'm something it'd been an older sister to Fakir.

Duck: Really? I mean ... NO! I wasn't really saying......

Fakir: She's been like a mother.
Ever since my parents died and I was taken in by Karon.

Uzura: Sister is not lovey-dovey zura?
Then is Raetsel lovey-dovey with Karo......UMMMMM!

Karon: No, no, Uzura.

Raetsel: How flattering. We look that way?
That certainly would be nice.

Karon: You shouldn't tease adults like that, you know.

Raetsel: You always treat me as a child.
You know I'm at an age where marrying someone wouldn't be odd.

Karon: Ha ha ha!
Well at my age [??all you'd the??] young to look same.
(私から見たら全く変わらんよ）
（字幕： To me, you haven't changed one bit.）
I still see you as Fakir and Mytho's playmate.

Raetsel: That's right. Where's Mytho?

Fakir: Oh yah, he's at school now.
His dancing consumes.

Raetsel: Weren't you always with him, saying "I'll protect you, Mytho!"?

Fakir: Ah. And I will.
You're staying here, right?

Raetsel: Actually I.... plan to stay at the water mill.

Fakir: I'll walk you there, then.

Raetsel: Thank you. But...
I think I want to take a little walk with Miss Duck.

Duck: Huh?

Raetsel: I'm a tiny bit jealous.

Duck: Huh?

Raetsel: Fakir with a girl as cute as you...

Duck: Oh, no! I'm not cute not at all!
The truth is I'm always fighting with Fakir, actually sometimes I just can't STAND him and you know.....ah.

Raetsel: I wonder if it's thanks to you that Fakir changed so much.
Say.... Is Fakir still writing stories?

Duck: Writing stories?

Raetsel: The stories that boy used to write now and again, sometimes they came true.

Duck: What? The stories he wrote actually came true?

Raetsel: He loved to write stories from the time he was very small.
They were just silly little stories, but sometimes part of them would come true.
However after he came to Karon's house, he just stopped writing all together.

Duck: Miss Raetsel?

Raetsel: I've said a little too much.
I wonder if Fakir will scold me? 




If he can do that....
Maybe....

Raetsel: Miss Duck?

Duck: Oh, sorry! I just remembered something!
Ah, it was fun talking to you!

Raetsel: Fakir has changed.
No.
The one who's changed the most....is me.

Fakir: Protect... , huh?
How do I protect him?
Who do I fight?

Mytho: You have to help me, Fakir.
My heart, it feels...!
The story no longer has need of you.

Fakir: The fight has begun.
The story is moving.
Whether I'm here or not.
But all I have is a sword.
I'll protect Mytho with this sword.

Duck: Ah! There you are!
Hey, Fakir, guess what Raetsel told me?
She said stories you write have the power to come true!

Fakir: She...what?

Duck: If you really have that power, and you write a story where Mytho gets saved in the end.....
Fakir?

Fakir: What are you saying?

Duck: Huh? I said, I heard some of the stories you wrote when you were little came true...
So...








Why are you talking to me that way?
Hey!
If I really could help Mytho by myself, Fakir, I wouldn't be asking you.
But right now, I can't do anything.

Fakir: I SAID BE QUIET!
I'll protect Mytho as a knight, end of story.
I won't take ORDERS from you!

Duck: Fakir, WHY?
Hey, listen to me!
Fakir! Come on, Fakir!
You'll (be able to?) help Mytho, then why won't you?

Duck: What's with you, too?

Lilie: We were waiting so we'd be ready when you came home crying!

Pike: So, what had happened with the wonderful Fakir?

Duck: I don't care what happened to him.

Lilie: Good, good!
Get mad and crying as much as you want.
We'll give you lost of comfort!

Duck: In that [???] we'd be able to help Mytho soon.
Why?

girl: [....] he's kind of scared.
girl: Lately it's like
girl: I'm.... ing su.....my....!

Mytho: Raetsel.

Raetsel: Mytho.
I'm jealous of you.

Mytho: Of me?

Reatsel: If I could live unchanging like you....

Mytho: That's not how it is.
See, I'm deferent that I was before.
I've gotten my heart back.
And that means....
Now, I can even except your love for me.



Maybe I'll call off the wedding, then.
(結婚なんてやめてしまおうかしら）



Which means the girl is Miss Rue?
The two of them are getting married?!
Is that right, getting married ....
Students of mine are getting married before my eyes!
There is no happier[??? about forcing for a teacher that marr????]


ongratulations.




Could it be you're wavering?



I was only joking before.
Hans loves me deeply from the bottom of his heart.
With him, I'm sure I can have happy life.



You've got a pure and beautiful heart, haven't you?






Sacrifice your life and love me!



Right, father?


Drosselmeyer: The fight between the prince and the raven is being fought with fiercer and fiercer desperation.
In the place where no one can see it.






A Fakir played thoroughly by an adult woman and then tossed away like yesterday's newspaper.
How wonderful!
I'd love for him to keep [????/字幕on like this] become more and more of a delinquent!


So, why?


Fakir: I'll protect Mytho as a knight, end of story.
I won't take ORDERS from you!



I don't like this.
NOWAY I [?don't let?] to stay like this!






Duck doesn't really doubt to love battles, does she? 






And the someone is important to Fakir, too.
So I thought if Fakir wrote the story, maybe we can help this person.
But that looks like....



This is because I said something I shouldn't have.




















Fakir was a child, but he must have wanted to do something to help.
He wrote the story where he became a hero and defeated the crows.
And then just like Fakir had written, the crows came and attacked him.
But the ending was different than his story.
Afterwards, he got [?sobly?] never to talk about it, as if he'd sealed those memories away.
He stopped writing stories, too.

Duck: I never knew Fakir had something like that happen to him.

Raetsel: It must still cut him deeply and [...] I ...
Miss Duck, please give Fakir some space.
What the world am I doing?

Mytho: I came to get you, Raetsel, my beautiful bride.

Uzura: Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey....
Huh?
Duck, what's wrong zura?

Duck: I'm the worst.
What should I say to Fakir?

Uzura: You wanna say something to Fakir zura?
Wow! Lots of crow zura!

Duck: The water mill!
Could Mytho be trying to get Raetsel's?

Mytho: Raetsel, I'll you give you a love no wavering.
You'll love only me, won't you?

Raetsel: Yes, Mytho.

Mytho: My Raetsel, come here and give your heart to me!

Raetsel: I am Mytho's bride.

Tutu: Wait!

Raetsel: Who are you?

Tutu: I am known as Princess Tutu.
Please come and dance with me, won't you, Miss Raetsel?

Raetsel: Princess Tutu.

Duck: If you have that power, and you write the story where Myhyo get to safe then in the end......

Fakir: What is awful feeling?
The power to make stories come true?
A power like that, in me?
That's ridiculous.

Uzura: Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey....
Fakir!
Is Mytho and Miss Raetsel lovey-dovey with zura?

Tutu: That's a lovely wedding dress.
You have someone you're engage to, right?
Then why are you?

Raetsel: Karon knows how I feel, but (I saw?) he said nothing. He did nothing.
Hans however, he shows me a faithy love for me.

faithy 出典:『Wiktionary』 (2012/12/11 04:45 UTC 版)語源faith +‎ -yHe looks only at me, and holds me close.
And I love him dearly as well.
But no matter what I do, I see Karon's face in my mind!
Love only me, and your wavering will vanish!

Tutu: You mustn't go there.
Does wavering scare you?
It's something you feel because you truly love people!

Raetsel: What scares me is that I may still love Karon.
When that thought cross my mind being with him is, it's painful! 

Fakir: Karon?!

Raetsel: I don't want to waver!

Fakir: Raetsel....

Mytho: That's right.
If you love only me...

Raetsel: If I but love only Mytho....

Tutu: NO! You're making great mistake, Miss Raetsel!

Mytho: Just forget every thing else!
And love only ME!

Tutu: Both of these things [???strike????] you true heart, Miss Reatsel.
But is what you're [??ing???] at right now your true feelings?

Mytho: True and false have nothing to do with it!
People just love others because they want to be loved!
She wavers because she wonders which one would love her more!

Tutu: That pain is how you truly feel!
So wake up!
You want to be happy with the one you love most, don't you?

Raetsel: I [?kept to?] weigh their love against each other for the sake my own happiness.
To escape the aching pain of my wavering, I set out to get Fakir to write story about me.
Even though I knew it would hurt him!
I'm a horrible woman!

Tutu: To want to be loved by those we love is not an evil feeling!
I'm sure it hurts to waver between two loves.
But simply running away won't help you to escape that pain.

Mytho: NO, YOU!
You should be loving only me!
RAETSEL!

Fakir: Mytho!
I won't allow you to hurt Raetsel!

Mytho: How interesting!

Tutu: STOP!
Two of you fighting is not going.....!

Fakir: Mytho....
Do you feel nothing?
You'll even use Raetsel?

Mytho: I was merely trying to save her!

Tutu: Fakir!

Fakir: "Trying to save her"?!
Don't [shooger kout] things! (勝手なことを言うな！)

Mytho: What like you've done with your [thurves] (じゃあ君に何ができるの？)
Knight who can't even die shouldn't point fingers!
How pathetic!
How long you go on shaming yourself wielding your play sword of yours?!






NOW, WAKE UP!
Remember your true self, Mytho!
Mytho?


Shut up.
Shut up.
SHUT UP!
AHHHHHHHHH!




Don't hurt Fakir!
You hear me, Raven?
Stop this!




Don't....
Don't come near me.....




Raetsel.


Please forgive me.
I was thinking only of myself.
All I wanted was to escape my pain.
And I did something to hurt you.
I'm sorry.


I've already forgiven you, Raetsel.


And that truth, wasn't it Miss Raetsel's heart to hurt you, Fakir?[<<==?????]]
Fakir?




"It wasn't Miss Ratsel's heart to hurt you."

Mytho: "Don't hurt Fakir!
You hear me, Raven?
Stop this!"

Duck: "If I really could help Mytho by myself, Fakir, I wouldn't be asking you.
But right now, I can't do anything."


That's right!
I can write a letter to the president. <<===??? 日本語では喋っていない

Duck: Fakir?
But wait! You're....

Fakir: Raetsel!
Raetsel!

Raetsel: Wow, good morning!
What's that in your hand?
Did you write a story for me?
Karon, I wanted to tell you.
Hans and I are going to get married.

Karon: So I see. Congratulation!

Fakir: Raetsel.

Raetsel: You see, I realized what I wanted was to say a proper goodbye to Karon.
But I'll take this.
Thank so much.

Duck: Your story didn't come true, huh.

Fakir: No, I didn't.
I think I will try writing one.

Duck: What?

Fakir: You know a story about Mytho.

Drosselmeyer: That's dangerous!
That power is truly dangerous, you know.
Can someone like you who couldn't attain dare Knight [XXX] really master such a [fortentclouved]?
(騎士にもなれなかったお前ごときに、果たして使いこなせるかね？）



Fakir: They took out the endings to stop the stories from becoming real?

Bookmen: He's awakened!

Bookmen: This is dangerous!

Bookmen: It seem he's gained the knowledge, but that's all.

Autor: A direct descendant of Drosselmeyer's, and this is your level?

Rue: That hurts!

Mytho: You've just hesitated to take my hand!

Duck: Mytho was always kind to Rue, but....

Oak tree: To those who accept everything, happiness.
To those who resist everything, glory.

Tutu: Fakir, please you must wake up!

Drosselmeyer: All you children who love stories, come gather around.
