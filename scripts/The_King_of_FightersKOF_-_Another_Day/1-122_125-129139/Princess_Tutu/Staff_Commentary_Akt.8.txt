男性：And here we have this sort of '60s, lounge-y kind of...
女性：See, oh... one of the reasons I think I end up crying during the opening/ending sequences is because the singer for the songs actually died last year.
And she composed a lot of very pretty themes. And she actually, she composed and sang these... which very much fit the show, which is kind of an oddity these days--(男性：Mmhmm.)--when they like to just slap on some J-pop band, you can tell that these songs were written for "Princess Tutu," which is very nice.
男性：Not to mention some of the, like, I mean a lot of it is, you know, classical music--classical Western music--but a lot of the incidental music during the show is just like little, uh, not overtures--I'm not really sure what the term is--but you know you have--she wrote just a little piece for just, you know, one scene...
女性："Bridges," maybe?
男性：Maybe.
