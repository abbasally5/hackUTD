Once upon a time, there was a man who died.
The man's work was the writing and the telling of stories. (tell of A: Aのことを語る)
But he could not defy death.
The last story he was working on was about a brave and handsome prince, who vanquishes a crafty raven.
But now it seems their battle will go on for eternity.
"I'm sick and tired of this!" cried the raven.
"I'm sick and tired of this!" cried the prince as well.
The raven escaped from the pages of the story.
And the prince pursued the fell creature.
(fell: fierce, cruel)
In the end the prince took out his own heart and sealed the raven away by using a forbidden power.
Just then, a murmur came from somewhere "This is great!" said the old man who was supposed to have died.

Duck: Quack?
I want... I want to dance with him, too.
With the prince....
But I'm a duck.
In voice and looks, just a duck.
I can't dance with him.
I can't even hold his hand.
And the prince's eyes always look so lonely.
Won't you laugh?
Please show me your smile, my prince!

Quack! Huh....

Drosselmeyer: Well, well, you care for him, don't you?

Duck: Q...quack?

Drosselmeyer: A little duck like you.

Duck: QUACK!

MONSTER!!
OWOWOW!!

Morning has come again to our dormitory at Gold Crown Academy where girls are waking now!
(字幕：To the girls' dormitory at Gold Crown Academy it's come, it's come again today, the morning has)
(♪～金冠学園の女子寮に、今日もきたきた朝がきた。)
Last night the dream I had was so weird and frightening....

Morning! Ow! Wait! Wait! Oh, I said, wait! Uh...
Oh, Java, your leg's all better!
Hey, Tiel, don't gobble it all of yourself!
Oh, Canary Mom, your kids are gonna be leaving the nest soon, aren't they?
When they learn to fly, bring them with you!
So, what was Senior Mytho up to?
I had another good dream!
I mean, yeah, me being a duck sucked as always, but at least I got to see Senior Mytho again.
Him being the prince was almost too perfect!
Senior Mytho, good morning!

Ah! It's the school bell!
That is terrible!
Oh, why didn't you wake me up?!
Pike and Lilie, you meanies!

Pike: Pike here.

Lilie: Lilie here.

Pike: Say. Isn't it still six o'clock?

Lilie: Scatterbrained as usual.
She's so cute!

Duck: Oh! I'm Duck! My name is Duck!
Maybe that's why I have dreams like that.
Oh my dear, Senior Mytho.
If I could dance a pas de deux with you, even just once.....
If I got to.... I'd give my life for that.

I'm sorry for being late!
Huh? There's no one here.
Why?

Ah! Oh! Senior Mytho! Oh.... Wow....

Oh! I'm sorry... I.... Well, ah...
Am I disturbing you?
I'm disturbing you, aren't I?
Of course I am! Aren't I? Aren't I?
Ah, please excuse me!
I'm leaving right away!
If only my body weren't so jumbled up....
I feel like I'm gonna trip, gonna trip....
(gonna: going to)
My feet, my feet, my feet! MY FEET!
I tripped...........
(あまり聞き取れないので、ほぼ字幕ママですorz)
Senior Mytho is... with Senior Mytho... is Senior Mytho... Senior Mytho too... to Senior Mytho... if Senior Mytho...
Senior Mytho.... Wow....
What beautiful eyes.
I feel like they're drawing me in.
But... They look so lonely.
It's like he's the prince I saw in my dreams.
Kakakakakakakakakaka, hie, ho. ha, he, ro, hin, ma, ka, me, so....
Huh! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry about bothering you, huh!
I'm really such a scatterbrain and I'm just so bad about things like everything. And top of that, I'm always too hasty, and Pike and Lilie say I talk like a duck, so I'm weird!
I mean, don't you think I'm weird? Shoot, even I think I'm weird...

Mytho: I don't.

Duck: Huh? You don't think I'm weird?

Mytho: I don't.

Duck: Ah! I can't believe it! No one's ever said that to me!

Fakir: Hey.

Mytho: Fakir.

Duck: Senior Fakir!

Fakir: Did I not tell you to inform me when you go out?

Mytho: Yes.

Fakir: We're going. Stand up.

Mytho: Umm.

Fakir: What's wrong?

Mytho: My foot.

Fakir: Foot? Did you twist it?

Mytyo: Umm.

Fakir: Idiot.

Duck: Huh? WHAT?!
Uh, um.... It was my fault!
He saved me when I tripped and...

Fakir: What were you thinking doing such a pointless thing?

Duck: So like I said, he was protecting me!

Fakir: That's why I said "pointless".
Stand up! We're going back!

Duck: You don't have to be so rough with him!

Fakir: QUIET!

Duck: Pointless, huh?
Well, sure maybe.
But you don't have to say quite so bluntly, you know.
The bell again?
WHAT?

Pike & Lilie: WHAT?

Pike: My butt. If you'd just taken the time to look at the clock!
《take the time to; take （the） time off ［out］ to》～するために時間を割く、時間を取って～する、～の時間を取る◆【語法】toの直後には動詞の原形が来る

Duck: I was panicked, OK?

Lilie: And that's what makes you so cute!
Always be our clumsy, scatterbrained Duck!

Pike: But, hey, you had the great honor talking to Fakir, so it's OK!

Duck: He isn't a very nice person!

Pike: What'd you say? You know Fakir's the best!

Duck: No! The best is Senior Mytho!

Lilie: Oh, Duck! The wonderful Mytho has already got Rue.

Pike & Lilie: A doomed love. A Duck, destined for heartbreak.

Lilie: How cute!

Pike: The teacher's here!

Duck: Yes! ....CAT?!

Pike: That's Mr.Cat!

Duck: Mr.Cat?

Lilie: Something wrong?

Duck: A cat for a teacher?

Mr.Cat: All right! Quiet down!
If you don't, rest assured, I will have you marry me!
Start in first position, now!
Relevé! And move your arms to second position.
Remember! Straight legs!
And now third position, arms en haut. That's it!
DON'T stick your bottoms out!

Duck: Senior Mytho. Why did his eyes look so lonely?

Mr.Cat: Bottom...

Duck: Sir!

Mr.Cat: Your mind was somewhere else, wasn't it?
If you do not focus, then, I will have you marry me!

Duck: Yes, sir! I'm sorry!
Wow!

Mr.Cat: All right!
We will now observe a performance by the special class.
Members of the special class, entrez-vous!

Students: Wow!

Duck: Rue! Aha!
Wow! So pretty!

Lilie: Yes. Unlike Duck!

Duck: Oh!

Pike: Now she's depressed.

Lilie: Oh, no! She really got depressed?
Oh, how cute!

Duck: For Senior Mytho..... It'd have to be someone like Rue to make a good match.
So sad....
Oh, wow!
What to do...

Mr.Cat: I won't indulge you any more! This time I WILL have you marry......

Pike:It's sorry!
Duck was just so moved, she couldn't help but cry out!

Lilie: She's taxing but cute! So please forgive her.
(taxing:やっかいな)

Duck: I still haven't made a proper apology to Senior Mytho for getting him hurt.
I have to apologize.

-------------A part--------------------
-------------B part--------------------

Pike: You should be grateful to us!

Lilie: You were this close to being forced to marry Mr.Cat.

Duck: Thanks.

Pike: What's wrong, Duck?
You're acting weird.

Lilie: Weird.

Duck: Do you think it's weird to suddenly show up?

Pike: Show up?

Duck: Well, I say suddenly.
But if there is no choice but suddenly, it's not weird, right?

Lilie: Aha?

Pike: Where is this?

Duck: Even if it is weird....

Lilie: Not for you!

Duck: I just gotta go!

Pike: Gotta go where?

Duck: OK! I'm going!

Lilie: Let's go!

Duck: See you later!

Pike: Where are you going?

Lilie: So cute!



Duck: Ummmm!
I'm not supposed to go into the boy's dormitory, but I'm just going to apologize, so....
I have to apologize, so.....
And I can't apologize unless I go inside....
Oh! You stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid coward!

Fakir: You're in my way.

Duck: Oh, um, is Senior Mytho.....

Fakir: He's not here.

Duck: Yeah, so, where?

Fakir: Go home.

Dcuk: Ouch!
How is his injury?

Fakir: It's not serious.

Duck: I'd like to apologize.

Fakir: There's no need.

Duck: Are you like this to everyone you talk to?
Booooo!
Oh, that guy really ticks me off!
(tick ~ off:～を怒らせる)


Fakir: Mytho.

Mytho: Fakir.

Fakir: I told you to stay in bed.

Mytho: Sorry.

Fakir: Is your foot hurting?

Mytho: I don't know.

Fakir: What a wretch you are.
You're far too slow and utterly useless.
As for helping others, you'd do best to forget such notions.

Mytho: Yes.

Fakir: All you need to do is listen to what I tell you.

Mytho: Yes.



Duck: Man, after all that I didn't get to make my apology.
I suck.
I wonder if his injury is okay?
Those eyes, they always look so lonely.
There's got to be some kind of reason for it, right.
Not that I can't do anything about it, but...
But if there are only some way I could help him.
If I were able to do something, I'd give my life for that.

Drosselmeyer: Hehehehehe, Hahahahaha!

Duck: Huh? What's that?
Ah! The man!
He's not here.

Drosselmeyer: Yes, I am.

Duck: I wonder who he was.

Drosselmeyer: You haven't forgotten about me already, have you?

Duck: It feels strange out here.

Drosselmeyer: Do you want to know?
Well, do you honestly now?
Little Duck!
The water has begun to flow, the time has begun to pass.
Now, tell me a story.

Fakir: I'm going.
On my way back I'll borrow some books for you from the library.
Don't read any except for the ones I bring.

Mytho: Okay. Thank you.

Fakir: Don't give me cause to worry, you idiot.


Duck: Okay!

Pike: So what's okay now?

Lilie: You're going to do something, right?
I wonder what?

Duck: Nothing really.

Pike: Maybe sneaking in to see Senior Mytho?

Lilie: Oh, my!

Pike: And if things go well, strike up a friendship?
Was I right?!

Duck: No, I hadn't thought that far....

Lilie: No, that's the spirit you have to go with!

Pike: Somehow we'll make sure to find the way to cover you being late!

Duck: Ah, okay.

Pike & Lilie: Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! ....

Pike: I wonder if it'll work out?

Lilie: Oh, it'll be fine!

Pike: You think?

Lilie: Because even if she fails, I'll comfort her.



Duck: I have to do it for real this time!
Oh! Canary Mom's kids leave the nest today!
Ah! Huh....
BE CAREFUL!
AH! NO! OH, NO!

Drosselmeyer: Oh, dear, the prince is going to die!

Duck: The prince?

Drosselmeyer: The hero meets his death.

Duck: Death?!

Drosselmeyer: What's going to happen in this story?
Please, you have to tell me what happens next.
Is the young prince going to make it?
Who in the world is going to save him?

Duck: But who?

Drosselmeyer: Yes. I wonder who?

Duck: I'll....

Drosselmeyer: Do you care for him, little duck?

Duck: Quack?

Drosselmeyer: Do you want to be of help to the poor young prince?

Duck: Quack.

Drosselmeyer: Are you saying that you are going to tell me this story?

Duck: Quack!

Drosselmeyer: Very well.

Duck: That's right! I will save the prince!
I...will save him!

Drosselmeyer: Now, you remember who you are?

Duck: Yes, I do! I am Princess Tutu!

Tutu: Flower Waltz!
And to think I was able to save you, Mytho.
It's like a dream.

Mytho: How do... you know my name?
And you, who are you?

Tutu: I am....

Drosselmeyer: Who indeed?

Tutu: I am... ah...

Drosselmeyer: You remember now, Little Duck? (Do～は聞こえない？）
Yes, you are a duck.
Just a bird called a duck.

Tutu: QUACK!

Duck: I'm.....
Quack! Quack.......
So, I was a duck.

Drosselmeyer: Well, well, Princess Tutu has gone back to being a duck.
The story has just begun.
What to do now?


Duck: Quack!
I'm just a duck. And I thought I was a girl.

Anteaterina: Oh my! If it isn't Miss Rue.
Myhtho is going to accompany me now.

Duck: Ant-eater?!

Rue: Would you dance with me?

Duck: RRRRRRRue! You know I'm really terrible at this!
So I don't think I'm gonna be any good of you at all!

Rue: Don't worry. Just follow my directions.

Heart Shard: I am the feeling of bitter disappointment, shattered and forgotten.

Duck: I really and truly have been able to become Princess Tutu!

Drosselmeyer: All you children who love stories, come gather around.
