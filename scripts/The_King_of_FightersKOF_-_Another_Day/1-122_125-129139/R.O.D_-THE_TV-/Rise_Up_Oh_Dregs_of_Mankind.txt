  Michelle:
And it looks like we're all paid up.
Here's your receipt.

Lee:
Thanks.

Michelle:
The Three Sisters Detective Agency looks forward to doing business with you again.

Anita:
She's just being nice.
We're still going back to Hong Kong.

Michelle:
We should think of our business as international from now on.

Anita:
And yet we don't get any work at home.

Lee:
So you're planning on going home right away?

Maggie:
I wanna go to Jinbo-cho.

Michelle:
We should!
After all, we rarely get to visit Japan.

Anita:
Hey!
If we're gonna go somewhere, let's go to a theme park!
Like the one with the mouse!

Michelle:
But, don't we have lots of mice at home?

Lee:
Um, I do have some more work to offer you.



Lee:
It's a little antiquated.
But, you can use it as you see...fit.

Michelle:
Thank you so much.

Anita:
There's nothing here.

Lee:
Now, it's not much, but I have a hiring bonus ready for you.
And Miss Sumiregawa lives right across the street.

Anita:
Nice place she's got there.

Michelle:
That's what you get for being a best selling author.

Maggie:
That is so cool.

Lee:
She has some very passionate fans and fanatical critics of her work.
To be honest, she's been stalked a few times before.
With this in mind, I'd like you three to act as her bodyguards for a bit, if you would.

Michelle:
You want us to be bodyguards?

Anita:
How long's "a bit"?

Lee:
Until she gets back on track.

Anita:
Then there's no telling how long we'll be here.

Lee:
Who knows.
She's been different since Hong Kong.
Please, say you'll take the job.



Michelle:
Excuse us, please.
I think it's a very good offer.

Maggie:
For Miss Sumiregawa.

Anita:
He is just her editor, right?
Why's he going to so much trouble just for her?

Lee:
Because I'm also a fan of her work.
I have really good hearing.
I'm doing all this because I really want to read her new book.
As fans of hers, you understand how I feel, right?

Three Sisters:
Yes, I do.(No, I don't)

Anita:
I am not a fan.

Maggie:
That's cruel.

Anita:
No, it's not.

Michelle:
Anita dear...

Anita:
No!

Maggie:
So cruel...

Michelle:
Let's have a three sister's vote!



(Telephone Message)
First new message.

Lee:
Hey, this is Lee over at Shueisha.
I'd love to see you and have a quick talk about your next book.
Maybe tomorrow afternoon?
Let me know, thanks.

There are no more messages.



Anita:
We're back!
And we bought stuff!

Michelle:
It was so expensive.
Our hiring bonuses may not be enough.

Anita:
Why do you buy stuff like this?

Michelle:
Because it's useful.
Now we can cut branches we couldn't reach before.
Well, I think I'll go change.
Paper clothes are so uncomfortable.

Maggie:
No books?

Michelle:
I wanted some, but...

Anita:
You promised to control yourself.
I didn't buy myself that Mr.Froggy.
So you're staying off the books for a while.

Maggie:
Sis?

Michelle:
Well?
She didn't tell me until after I bought that thing.

Maggie:
Again with the cruelty.

Michelle:
Anita dear?
Can we have some?
Just a few.
Please!

Anita:
Fine.
Tomorrow.

Maggie:
There's nothing to read tonight.

Anita:
You can survive one evening.

Maggie:
Sob...Sob...Sob...

Anita:
You cry weird, Maggie.



Nenene:
Why me?

Anita:
Because we don't know anybody else.
So we had no choice.
Michelle:
We just thought we should stop by and say hello.

Nenene:
Hey.
Stay out of there.

Michelle:
After all, Lee hired us to be your bodyguards.
So we felt it was important to give you a warm greeting.

Nenene:
Lee did what? Bodyguards?
Stop that.
You're making a mess.
Anita:
Ooh! Staircase!
Nenene:
That's my office.
You're not allowed up there.

Anita:
You're being selfish.

Nenene:
I am not selfish, nor will I be called selfish by a brat who came barging into my home!

Anita:
Don't you call me a brat!

Nenene:
What is the tall one doing with my sheets?!

Michelle:
Oh, she's just nesting.
Maggie likes dark, confined spaces.

Nenene:
Get off my sofa!

Michelle:
I think I'll go have a quick bath.

Nenene:
Wait a second!
Hold it!

Anita:
Paper towel!
Over here!

Maggie:
Good night, everyone.
Nenene:
Hey!

Michelle:
A bath, a bath ...

Anita:
I'm gonna have some cookies!


Nenene:
Everybody shut up!!

What I'm trying to say is that there's an established etiquette.
When you spend the night at someone's house.

Anita:
You snuck out in the middle of the night.

Nenene:
Would you like to repeat that?

Anyway, I'll let the three of you stay here tonight.
But tomorrow you go back to your place.
And let's all be clear that I don't need any bodyguards.

Michelle:
But we can't just...

Nenene:
End of discussion!
I'm going upstairs there will be no noise, no mess, you break the rules, and you die.

Anita:
Die?

Maggie:
She's so...scary...

Michelle:
Well, she is at that difficult age.

Anita:
Who cares?
She obviously doesn't want any bodyguards.

Michelle:
I wonder if the mess at the airport made it onto the news.
Maggie dear, would you turn on the TV?

Maggie:
I can't.
There's no remote.

Michelle:
Well, try using a stick or something...
Come on, just turn the TV on.
Quickly, quickly.

Maggie:
OK...

Michelle:
Wow...
Your aim...

Anita:
What're you doing?!
Unplug it!
Quick!



Nenene:
What was that?

Michelle:
That? Nothing.

Nenene:
Where are they?

Michelle:
Um, they're on patrol.

Anita:
It's OK.
We'll just run out and get some superglue.

Nenene:
You people...
Just go to bed already!



Michelle:
Good morning.

Anita:
You sleep in late.

Nenene:
Why don't you do that one at the time?
It's kind of cramped in there.

Michelle:
Well, yes, that's true, but...



Three Sisters:
Have a good day!

Nenene:
Please don't be here when I get back.

Also, replace my TV.



Anita:
Can we go back to our apartment now?

Michelle:
We don't have an apartment anymore.
We used the rent and deposit money to buy a replacement TV.

Anita:
Didn't that place belong to Mr.Lee?

Michelle:
Well, he did say we could do anything we wanted with it.
After all, none of this would've happened if you hadn't broken the TV.

Anita:
It's because Maggie has such bad aim.

Maggie:
Michelle told me to turn on the TV.

Michelle:
Remember.
Our motto is...

Three Sisters:
One's trouble for all, and everyone's trouble for one.

Anita:
How depressing...!

Michelle:
We certainly seem to be between a rock and a hard place.

Anita:
Apparently.

Michelle:
Our survival demands that we figure out a way to stay here.
Agreed?

Maggie,Anita:
Yeah.

Michelle:
So, let's make a plan.

Rise Up, Oh Dregs of Mankind


Lee:
It's been quite a crazy week for you, huh?

Nenene:
Lee, did you know those three were Paper Masters?

Lee:
Well, you know, I'm from Hong Kong.
I still hear a lot about what goes on out there.
That includes the Paper Sisters.

Nenene:
The Paper Sisters?

Lee:
Yep.
That's what everyone back home calls them.
The Paper Sisters.

Waitress:
Thank you for waiting.

Lee:
You would've been in a bad situation if they hadn't of been with you.

Nenene:
I am in a bad situation.
They just ran from the scene and left me to be interrogated by the police.
What's so funny?

Lee:
I'm just impressed.
Only you could talk your way out of that mess.

Nenene:
Don't patronize me.
Those three, they're going back to Hong Kong.
I don't need any bodyguards.

Lee:
You sure?
I think it's healthy for you to have people like that around.

Nenene:
Why?

Lee:
In the four years I've been your editor, I've never seen you so animated.

Nenene:
I don't think you're reading me right.

Lee:
What do you mean?

Nenene:
This is frustration you're seeing.

Lee:
That would explain the excessive aggression.

Nenene:
Listen to me!
Uh...
Cheese cake!
Right here!

Lee:
My, how energetic...!



Maggie:
I'm honored to welcome you home.

Nenene:
Hi.
Why are you still here?

Maggie:
Let me take your bag.

Nenene:
What's with the outfit?

Maggie:
I made it out of paper.

Nenene:
You really cleaned up...
Maggie:
Well, yeah...

Nenene:
Wow.
A new TV!

Maggie:
Yes, ma'am.

Nenene:
Hold on!
Put that in the closet or on the...
...Wasn't there a coat rack?
And a ficus?

Maggie:
Yes, there was.

Nenene:
Now there isn't.

Maggie:
No, there's not.

Nenene:
What did you do with them?

Maggie:
I threw them out.

Nenene:
You threw them where?

Maggie:
In the dumpster.

Nenene:
You threw them away?!

Maggie:
Was that bad?

Nenene:
Of course it was!

My sofa...My table...

Maggie:
I kinda threw them out also.

B..But I...organized the books.
See?

Nenene:
Bring it back.
Go find everything and bring it back right now!

Maggie:
Yes, ma'am!



Michelle:
I'm sorry Maggie has displeased you.
She's the type of girl who's never cleaned her room before.
So she wasn't sure how to do it properly.

Nenene:
What have the three of you been doing all day?

Michelle:
As a token of our apology, allow me to serve you dinner.


Truck Driver:
Televisions, electronic equipment, we'll haul away them free of charge!
Nenene:
You did all of this?

Michelle:
Well, I took the liberty of putting this together for you.
There. Please enjoy!
How is it?

Nenene:
It's not bad!

Michelle:
If you would at least consider allowing us to remain in your service.
We would be supremely honored.

Nenene:
Well, I promise that I'll think about it.
What's that?

Michelle:
You can reimburse me later.

Nenene:
I thought you cooked all this!

Michelle:
Oh, no!
Many have often told me that I'm a terrible, terrible cook.
Besides, cooking is such a bother.

Nenene:
You don't get to be pompous, if you didn't actually do anything!

Michelle:
I told you it was just a token.

Nenene:
Of nothing!



Michelle:
Token or not, you still managed to eat the entire thing.

Nenene:
It'd be a waste if I let any get thrown away.
Dear God, I'm full...

Michelle:
Oh, no!
Where ever did I put little Anita's Pure Diary?!
The innocent and sweet child Anita's innermost feelings are recorded in it!!
And I will be in such trouble if someone happens to read it!!

(Greensleeves) キレイな...

Nenene:
April the 1st, Sunny.
Listen, listen.
Or rather, read, read.
Today, my heart is going thumpity thump.
Because I have gotten to meet a really famous writer.
Nenene, her name could make a crying child's heart fill with joy.
Oh, she's so pretty and cool, and just one look at her made my cheeks blush.
Am I being too bold?
I am sorry.
April 4th, Sunny.
We ended up coming all the way to Japan to follow Nenene.
Thank you, God, for this twist of fate.
We are now all staying in her apartment and I wish I could be with her forever and ever...
I'm so in love with her.
I feel shy saying so, but if she would only ask, I would let her--

Anita:
No!
It's not me!
Stop reading!
Make it stop!

Nenene:
I didn't want to hear anymore this awful tripe, either.

Michelle:
I worked so hard producing that.
Well, that didn't work, but don't worry!
Operation "sweet and sour" cajoling has only just begun!

Nenene:
Enough.
I've had enough.
I want you gone.

Michelle:
But please, just give us one more chance!

Nenene:
No, just get out.
Get out now.
I want you gone, now!

Maggie:
I'm... I'm home.

Nenene:
Get out.



Anita:
This is all your fault, Michelle.
You should've just let Maggie cook.

Michelle:
But I'm not cut out for physical labor.

Anita:
Oh, please.
What about the diary?

Michelle:
That would've been too embarrassing.
No way!

Anita:
You're so stupid!

Michelle:
I'm sorry.

Maggie:
It's cold.



Nenene:
That's much better.

(Greensleeves)
TV:
--wonderful era we live in where all women under thirty-seven are required to wear glasses without exception.
It's truly a glasses paradise.
"Gla-ise" for short!
Or as they say a "Spectacle's heaven"
Thank you, thank you!
Now, Mega and Negane's Mega-hide have accomplished a great--
Nenene:
Fine!
TV:
--achievement by winning the first People-with-Glasses of the year award...



Michelle:
All right.
Tomorrow morning, we'll all go huddle near her front door to invoke her sympathy.

Anita:
Give it up already.

Michelle:
Don't say that.
Here.
We'll use these for tears.
No matter how cruel and cold hearted she is...

Nenene:
Hey!

Michelle:
Miss Sumiregawa!
Well, fancy meeting you here!
We were just in the middle of admiring the beautiful Japanese cherry blossoms!

Nenene:
I guess it's alright.
Let's just pretend you actually dooped me.
Why don't you come back inside?

Michelle:
Miss Sumiregawa!

Nenene:
However, there are some conditions.
You do all the household chores.
You pay for your own food.
You don't disturb my work.
And finally, you call me Big Sister Nenene.

Anita:
Big Sister Ne-na? Ne-ne-ne-na?
It's hard to say!

Nenene:
Shut up!
Keep trying.

Anita:
Just Nenene?

Nenene:
Fine.
I suppose I can live with that compromise.

Anita:
Then you can call me Anita. Right?

Nenene:
Humph!
I think I'll just keep calling you little brat.

Anita:
Why?!
That's so not fair!

Nenene:
Come on!
If we keep making noise, we'll become a public nuisance!
Let's just go home!

Three Sisters:
All right!
TV:
Today, President Cole is away from the States and on a tour of China.
