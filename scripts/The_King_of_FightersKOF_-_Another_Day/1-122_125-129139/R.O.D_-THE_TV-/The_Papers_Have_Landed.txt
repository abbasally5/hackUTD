  Nenene:
Why exactly were you reading my book?

Maggie:
I don't even compare to big Sis.

Michelle:
Don't worry,
I'll always be here to protect you.

Anita:
I'm back.

Michelle:
I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry...



Lee:
Miss Takiura finally finished her manuscript.
Sorry I can't go with you.

Nenene:
I guess you'd rather spend your energy on a writer who is actually writing.

Lee:
C'mon, you know it's not like that...

Nenene:
I know.
After all, it's only a press conference and a book-signing.

Lee:
Oh, I've arranged a guide to pick you up from the airport

Nenene:
Okay.

Lee:
Just try and make it back in one piece.
Ah...



Michelle:
Ah... uh, uh... ah?
So you must be Miss Sumiregawa!
It's a pleasure.
I'm your guide, Michelle Chan.
I'm 24 years old.
And my favorite books are the Harry Potter series...

Nenene:
It's Nenene.
Nenene Sumiregawa.

Michelle:
Huh?

Nenene:
That says... Nununu!

Michelle:
Nu-nu-nu...?
Ne-ne-ne...?
Na-na-na!
Oh, wai... Hmm...

Michelle:
Why don't we get you to your hotel.

Michelle:
Hey, Maggie!
Maggie dear!

Maggie:
I'm here.

Michelle:
Where did you go?

Maggie:
Bathroom.

Michelle:
You're being rude to our guest.

Michelle:
This is Maggie, your driver.
She's quiet, unsociable, and very tall.
Her favorite writer is Hemingway...
She may come off as a bit unfeminine, but she's still a nice girl.

Maggie:
Big Sis...!

Nenene:
Sisters?

Michelle:
Yes, that's right.
The two of us are sisters, and very close.

Maggie:
Please.

Nenene:
Ah.

Maggie:
I do like Ernest Hemingway, but I really enjoy your books as well.

Nenene:
Thank you.

Michelle:
I bet everyone in Japan is excited about your book being made into a film.

Nenene:
Not really.
It's been four years since it was published.

Michelle:
Oh...

Nenene:
And I haven't published a single thing since then.

Michelle:
Really?

Nenene:
Uh-huh.
In Japan's literary world, I'm ancient history.

Michelle:
Oh, look! Hong Kong Island!
That's Hong Kong Island over there to the right!
And next to it is the Kowloon Peninsula.

Michelle:
Please feel free to take a nap until your meeting this afternoon.
You'll be staying in the penthouse suite.

Nenene:
Oh...



Policeman:
"You sophomoric Japanese bitch.
Take your pitiful novel and go to hell and drag that shameless movie studio down with you."
Sounds like our bomber.
Shame he didn't sign it.
You're lucky that your arrival was delayed.
Who would do this?
Probably some nut-job with a thing against the Japanese.
Any idea who it might be?

Nenene:
I have no idea.

Man:
Then, what're we gonna do about tomorrow?

Policeman:
You're cancelling it, obviously.

Man:
We're cancelling.
Miss Sumiregawa's safety is our top priority.

Nenene:
No.
If I cancel the show and run, then I've lost to this freak. Right?
Man:
Not necessarily--
Nenene:
I won't be bullied by this puerile idiot.

Police man:
So, my men should risk their lives for your selfishness.

Nenene:
My Selfishness?!
This isn't about pride!
This is about protecting truth and honor!
This creep is trying to silence me and my novel through violence!
Besides, I don't need your protection!
For the last ten years, I've been stalked by creeps like this dozens of times and not once have I ever allowed them to get the better of me!
That's why, tomorrow will go exactly as planned!
Bring them on!
And I'll give him a personalized autograph right in his face!

Michelle:
That's the spirit of a true writer.
Such masculinity, I may never be able to think of you as a woman again!

Maggie:
Michelle...

Michelle:
Please, may we join in your efforts to guard her tomorrow?

Policeman:
Aren't you just tour guides?

Michelle:
We're aware of the danger.
But we just can't abandon Miss Sumiregawa like this.
We will protect her, with our very lives.
I mean, Maggie will.

Man:
Hello?
Yes, but... Yes, yes, I'll do that.
Um, the publishers want the signing to go ahead as scheduled.
We'll be providing security for you as well.
All we have to do now is find you a new hotel.

Michelle:
I have a great idea.

The Papers Have Landed


Michelle:
Please watch your step.

Nenene:
This is it?
You two really live here?
Detectives?

Michelle:
What?
Oh, well, yes.
That's our main business.
If you need to find a person, book or cat, feel free to consult with us.
Oh! Oh, this is bad!

Nenene:
What's wrong?!

Michelle:
It's a book slide.
Already the fifth one this month.
That's Anita, our youngest sister.

Anita:
Stupid books!
I hate books!

Nenene:
Hey, don't shout like that, you little brat!

Anita:
And who is this?

Nenene:
I'm Nenene!
Nenene Sumiregawa!

Anita:
That's a stupid name.

Nenene:
What did you say?!

Anita:
Why do we have to let a stranger stay here?

Michelle:
What are you talking about?
She's written some of our favorite books.
Therefore she should be treated like a member of the family.

Anita:
She's not a member of my family.
And I've never read her books.

Michelle:
To have a famous writer spend a night is an honor for a bibliophile.

Anita:
I'm not a biblio-person!

Nenene:
I guess I'm not welcome.

Anita:
Hmph!

Michelle:
Ah, Miss Sumiregawa!
Please, hold on!
We shall have a three sisters' vote.
All in favor?
And against?
Then it's settled!

Anita:
Not fair!
You're a tyrant!

Michelle:
We settled this democratically.

Maggie:
I was wondering... would you sign my book?
Um...

Michelle:
Me too!
Me too!

Nenene:
Yeah, no problem.

Maggie:
Thank you so much.

Anita:
Forget it!

Nenene:
What am I doing?



Anita:
Hey, Sis, Sis!
That writer lady's gone.



Anita:
Hey, idiot!
Do you know how dangerous it is out here?!

Nenene
I'm sorry.

Anita:
You're sorry? That's it?!

Come on!
We're going home!



Nenene:
I was thinking about the past.
When I was writing this book.
I had this friend.
She loved books.
She was buried in them all the time.

Anita:
Just like my sisters.

Nenene:
This friend loved my writing, and always told me so.

Anita:
That sounds really weird.

Nenene:
Then one day, my friend disappeared.
Vanished from my life without a word.
I never had a chance to find out what my friend thought about the book.
I don't think I can move on until I do.

Anita:
Were you in love with him?

Nenene:
My friend was a woman.

I don't know, it wasn't romantic love, it was...
She was important to me.

Anita:
She was important...

Nenene:
She loved books more than anyone I've ever met.
I expect her to just appear when I'm in a bookstore.

Anita:
Then it's Okay.
Don't worry about it.
She's important to you, right?
Then you'll see her again someday.

Nenene:
I haven't heard from her in four years.

Anita:
That doesn't matter at all.
Because the world is made to help people find each other.

Nenene:
That's a big idea, for a little brat.

Anita:
You're the one who's been causing trouble just like a bratty little kid!

Nenene:
Whatever.

Anita:
Let's go home.
My sisters are worried about you.

Nenene:
Michelle makes weird sounds in her sleep.

Anita:
Yeah, I know.



Maggie:
Someone announced on the internet...that they were going to kill Miss Sumiregawa.

Woman:
Good luck on your new novel.

Man:
Nothing comes in unless it's being signed.

Nenene:
I'm sorry, but that's not my book.

???:
I know.
This book is mine.

Don't move!
Or I'll detonate the bomb!
Radio:
The perpetrator is in the building.
One hundred seventy centimeters in height. Slender build. Identity unknown.
He appears to be holding an explosive device!
???:
Drop your weapons!
If the ball touches either side, the bomb will explode.

Policeman:
So, who the hell are you?!

???:
I am a writer.

Policeman:
What do you want?

Writer:
I'd like to know why you treat this third-rate Japanese actress special.

Man:
He brought us some unsolicited material a few months ago.

Writer:
Why does the little girl get her trash turned into a movie, while you won't even read my novel?!

Michelle:
I'm sorry.
I'm really nervous.
Writer:
Don't anybody else move, I swear I'll blow the bomb!
Policeman:
Don't do anything stupid, it's only a novel!

Writer:
Only a novel?!
This book is my whole life!

I was born and raised on this island.
And I've been writing all these years!
I sacrificed everything!
But only this stupid, foreign bitch gets recognition!

Nenene:
You're right.
I'm a foreigner in Hong Kong.
But my novels aren't foreign to any part of the world!
Anybody can enjoy the stories that are in my books!

Writer:
Shut up!

Nenene:
If you're really a writer, then why don't you try and kill me with your work?
You think this bomb will stop me?
My words will never die!
Writer:
Grr...die already!
Maggie:
You okay?
Anita:
I guess.
Where's the bad guy?
Maggie:
Over there.
Michelle:
Where's Miss Sumiregawa?
Is she all right?

Anita:
Yeah, she's down there.

Nenene:
You...You're all Paper Masters?

Anita:
Uh, yeah.

Nenene:
Do you know who this is?

Anita:
Nope.

Michelle:
I've never seen her before.

Maggie:
Sorry.

Man:
What happened?

Maggie:
What're you doing?

Michelle:
Thought I'd give it a read.

Maggie:
Let me see it when you're done.



Nenene:
Well, I guess, thanks for saving my life and everything.

Anita:
If you want to thank me, use money.

Maggie:
Anita...

Anita:
I wonder where Michelle wandered off to.

Maggie:
Sorry.

Nenene:
There's no need to apologize.

Maggie:
Sorry about that.

Nenene:
Here.
These are for you and Michelle.

Maggie:
I...I'll treasure this forever.

Nenene:
That's great.
And here's one for you too.

Anita:
I wonder what it's worth on eBay...

Maggie:
Anita...



Anita:
Where were you?
She already left, you know.

Michelle:
Different...handwritings....
The book has two writers!

Maggie:
Michelle?

Michelle:
There's still another writer!



Another Writer:
Sit down, and stay there.
I believe you've already met my little brother.

Nenene:
The two of you are certifiable.
Why don't you try directing all this energy into your writing?

Another Writer:
Oh, we have.
But we had a lot of energy left over.
You of all people should understand.
Or has your well of inspiration dried up?

Nenene:
I'm nothing like you.
Because there's nothing more pathetic than a desperate, untalented hack!

Another Writer:
Shut up!



Nenene:
Anita!

Anita:
Sorry.
I couldn't get in.

Michelle:
Maggie, let's go forward!

Men:
What the hell's going on back there?!
Sir, take a look at this!
Is it a bird?



Anita:
You still alive?

Nenene:
What do you think you were doing, you brat?!
You could've hurt yourself!

Anita:
What an obnoxious thing to say.
I did just save your life.

Anita:
Well, at least we're even now.
Next time, try writing a thicker book.
I could use more help on my defense.

Nenene:
We're crashing!

Anita:
Don't worry!
My sisters will save us!

Maggie:
Michelle, it's heavy.

Michelle:
Then I'll lighten the load!
Radio:
Flight nine nine seven's condition is still unknown--
Child:
Mommy, what's that?
Radio:
--but we ask everyone to remain calm, and pray for it's safe return.


Michelle:
Maggie, I'm curious.
Have you ever been to Jinbo-cho?

Maggie:
No.

Michelle:
They have more bookstores there than anywhere else in the world.
Wanna go check it out later?

Maggie:
Yeah.

Nenene:
How am I supposed to explain this?

Anita:
Oh, please.
Why don't you just make up some stupid story?
You are a writer, aren't you?

Nenene:
Why would I tell such a ridiculous story?!
No one will believe it!
It's too unrealistic!

Anita:
Jeez!
Way to show gratitude.

Nenene:
I thought you said we were even!
