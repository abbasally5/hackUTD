  Damn.
Do you plan on this every morning by any chance?
Good morning, dear.
Would you like to join us?
xxxxx today.
No.
Someone needs to clean up the living room, and get breakfast ready.
Whose turn is it?
Mine.
Little Miss.Attaboy?
Don't give me such a stupid nickname!
But it suits you.
Try it out say, "I'm a little Attaboy."
Never! xxxxx.
Let's go, Attaboy.

That's you, Maggie?
Yeah.
Wait, hold on.
What were you thinking?!
Don't use paper magic so brazenly.
I don't want anything like a mess at Narita Airport.
We'll be careful.
But as they say, a rumor xxxxx only 75 days"...so please try to overlook it this time.
Easy for you to say.
I was the one left to clean up your mess last time.
You two.
I want you to get your room finished before noon.
So, help me clean up, alright?
What? You're going to let us have a own room?
I can't keep you a pile in the living room for much longer.
My parent's old bedrooms upstairs.
We clean it and it's yours.
Are you listening, brat?
Yeahhh.

All right, Big bed!
No! Wait!
Don't xxxxx, you little brat.
Try cleaning once in a while!
Put what you don't need into storage. 
Let's air out the futon on the balcony.
Sheets go in the washing machine.
No problem.
Alright, get moving!

What are you doing?
A pigeon...
A pigeon?
I don't see anything.
It was just here.
An evil dangerous-looking pigeon.
An evil pigeon...
Hey.
Get your butts moving.I want to finish this before noon.
I'm sorry.
Alright.
Hey, where are your dad and mom?
America.
America?
My father is a programmer.
He was recruited by a company over there.
And my mother went with him.
And so you didn't go with them?
I'm still here, aren't I?
Hmm.
I was already a writer at that time. And I really wanted to stay in Japan.
It doesn't matter where you write though, does it?
You can send it as data.
That's true.
But it makes a big difference who you're surrounded by.
That's how it is, is it?
That's how it is.

Still too crowded.
Should we bring the sofa up from downstairs?
Actually...
There's a room I'd like to use.
You sure? It's a storage room.
Yes.
0,,She loves dark and confined spaces.
Well, there's no harm in that, I guess.
But why does she get tall for, then?
You two share the bedroom.
You can arrange it any way you like, but don't make a mess.
Alright.
And bring a blanket to my room for me.
Yeah.

Wow, how unlady-like.
Look who's talking.
You're really going to sleep here?
Yep.
I can start working as soon as I get up, and I can go to bed whenever I'm sleepy.
That's unhealthy.
You're healthy.
Shut up.
Alright, I'm off to Kanda to meet with Lee.
Have a nice day.
Behave yourselves.

Ahh, now we can relax.
I must say Sensei's aura is quite something.
I feel overwhelmed just being near her.
Hey, sis.
0,,Yes?
0,,We're supposed to be her bodyguards, aren't we?
What are you talking about?
You are such a forgetful girl, Maggie-dear?
Well, I mean, shouldn't we have gone with her?
So, where's Kanda?
I think it's in the Chiyoda.
Chiyoda Ward... Chiyoda Ward...Kanda... Kanda...
What's wrong?
Sis?

Yuck.
Books! Books! Books!
What a wonderful town it is!
I'm so thankful I'm alive.
It sucks.
Maggie-chan, Anita-chan, let's have some free-time now.
We'll meet again here in five hours. Is that all right?
Yeah.
Free-time?
We are supposed to be looking for Nenene!
Ah, well, of course we are.
I mean let's search freely, "free search kind of thing."
Now, let's not waste anemore time. One cannot hold youth.
Yes, Time is a phantom traveler that keeps drifting away forever.
We are wanderers floating in the waves. Or, as they say, "vagabonds!"
Hey! What are you doing?!
She's giddy. I mean, totally flipped out.
Looney Tunes.
Ma-nee, you keep your sanity, OK?
Huh? Ah, yeah.
Let's go check some coffee shops, OK?

Are you by yourself?
Yeah, I left those three at home.
I don't wanna deal with them now.
That sort of the purpose of hiring them is your bodyguards...
With upcoming movie...our sales department is suggesting that...
we release a paperback printing of "Midnight".
Let us know your changes first.
I'd rather not re-read my old stuff. It's too young.
It's nice to re-visit your past once in a while.
Already the past, huh?
Here is your fan-mail for this month.
They're all looking forward to your new work.
Could you hold on to them? I'm sorry.
They're really starting to pile up now.
0,,I still don't have enough courage to read them.
What! She's really here?
Ah, Sensei!
Are you Sumiregawa-sensei?
Oh, Miss.Nishizono.
This is Nishizono Haruhi-san...
Oh my god! I'm your biggest fan of your work.
Oh.Thank you.
I became a writer because I was so moved by your work.
I wanted to inspire people with my work, like you did.
Oh.
What are you working on right now?
Well, not much. It's just...
Miss.Nishizono, we've got to...
Yes.
Then, Sensei, I hope you'll talk again sometime.
Ah, yes.
I look forward to your new book.
She's so radiant.
It's good to be young.
You know, you both same age.
Well, you made your publish much younger age.

What kind of place is this? Bookstores everywhere.
Would she really be in a place like this?
Yes, may... I... help you?
I take the all books. All the books you have.
Huh?
All of them!
She's not anywhere.
Hey, don't go! Come back!

Where is this place? Another book store?
This book...
May I take this book?
Yeah, sure.
Hey, is this place kinda shady bookstore?
Even the elevator's been rigged.
Hey.
Hey what?
What are you are thinking you are doing here?
I'm "The Bodyguard."

Don't add "The!"
What's all this commotion about?
Are you going out of business?
A strange woman...
A strange woman came in and...
bought all the books in my store.
All the books?
Is it her?
She's back?
My store's completely cleared out. Who was she?

What's wrong?
Are you OK?
I don't think so.
Oh my god! Hold on! Hey!
Um, somebody call an ambulance! Anybody!
0,,Books...
Oh, I feel wonderful.
This town is wonderful!

I'm a bodyguard, not a bellboy, you know.
Don't complain.
Just think about who pay for the broken elevator?
Where are we?
Watch where you're going...or you'll get lost.
Nenene, is this...?
Yep, this entire building is filled with books.
One person's, well, giant bookshelf.
You're kidding!Nobody could live here.
But she did.
Well, I never saw her do anything but read or sleep.
Is 'she' who I think she is?
Right. Yomiko Readman.

He says it was a woman who bought them.
The rare books are sold out, too!
She's back! Darn, where is she now?!
Hey, go get that special book out of the store!
We better make her feel welcome.
Hey, go round up anyone who's available.
Got it!
Alright.
Two or three times a month...
I've been bringing over new releases and books she might be interested in.
So they'll be waiting for her whenever she comes back.
Why do you do all this? You know she could be...
Yeah, maybe she is. I don't think so, though.
Even if she is dead...
I can't help thinking that she'll come back scratching her head...
saying, "Sorry, I just had to die."
I have to believe that she will come back because this is her home.
Alright, we gotta go.
Ugh, not a jungle of books again.
You know...
What?
Come to think of it, it's strange, isn't it?
You hate books so much, yet you're a Paper Master.
I mean all the others love books.
How did you exactly become a master?
Anita?
Yeah.
You really think it's strange?
Well, you were probably born with natural talent or something.
Let's go. It's getting late.
Mm-hmm.
See you later, Yomiko.

Did she stop by your stall yet?
No, not yet.
It's been a long time. Maybe she's feeling self-conscious.
Hey, look at this book.
You brought out that book?
Why not? I thought it'd make her happy.
It sure will.
Hey, Nenene.
What is this? What's going on?
I've got a great news! It looks like Yomiko-chan is back, isn't she?
Where is she?
Where...? She's somewherein the neighborhood, isn't she? That's why we're all waiting like this.
I don't know anything about it.
Where did you see her? Who saw her?
A strange woman came in and bought all the books in my store.
What did she look like? Was she wearing glasses and a coat?
Ah...
Sensei!
I looking all over for you.
What are these? Did you buy them?
You could say that, or I received them when I gave them money.
Or I could have used my credit card.
I told you we're poor!
Mi-nee, how much did you spend?
I'm sorry.
You're such a fool!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Idiot!!
Junior, did you get it?
Good. Mr. Carpenter will be pleased.
Will he commend me?
Of course.
Forgive me.

You divided the room.
Ah, yes.
Anita is reaching a difficult age.
Where is she?
Yeah.That was a nice bath.
This is my territory from this point!
You can't come in without my permission!
Of course not.
And please knock when you come in here as well, Anita.
Sensei...
What's the matter?
This book is so touching...
You haven't completely recovered yet. Don't stay up too late.
Goodnight.
Goodnight...
Mi-nee, give me back my pillow!
But if I sleep on a flat pillow, I'll have scary dreams.
Don't be such a baby, you're too old for that.
What? What do you mean "old?"
Ow! Ow!
Even here.
I am your older sister!
0,,Ow! Ow! Ouch! You're pulling me! I said you're pulling me!
It's become so noisy, but...
0,,Ouch!
I guess it's alright.
