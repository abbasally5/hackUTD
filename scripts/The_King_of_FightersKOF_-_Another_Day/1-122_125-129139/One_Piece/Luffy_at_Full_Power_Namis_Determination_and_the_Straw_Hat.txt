  And if I don't fight with all I got, then I don't deserve to be on the same ship with them! And I'll never be able to face my friends again!

Choo?

Usopp Hammer!
Usopp Rubberband of Doom!

Shoulder! Chest! Legs!

What did you say is done?

This whole fight!
Alcohol lights on fire!
Usopp Hammer!
You see [???] I beat your ass!

I don't have to lay a finger on you - you humans are so fragile that I can kill you just by playing around with a little water. That's the difference between you and me.

Arlong!

It's Nami!

Hey, Nami! I was just teaching one final lesson to these pathetic little pirates. What are you doing here?

I'm here to kill you...

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:0:&lt;h1&gt; 

Me? You want to kill me?!
Haven't you learned your lesson yet?
How many times have you tried to kill me at these last 8 years?
You've tried assassination, poison, sneak attacks!
You must be aware that you mere humans can't kill me.
Now, listen - I won't put you in the ground, Nami, but you can't leave.
You remaind here, with us, as our surveyor. Forever.
But, as you know, I'm quite good-natured. If possible, I'd like you to be our surveyor of your own free will. I'm giving you a choice. I will not take pause in having my fishmen kill every living creature on this island except for you. But that's only if you refuse to come back to the Arlong Pirates and draw sea charts as one of our own. And if you decide to come back with us, I'll be kind and spare the villagers their lives. But I can't let these [???] live. They must be made an example of. So there's only one question - will you come with me and save the people of Cocoyashi Village, or be foolish and refuse my request by fighting alongside them? It's your choice. With them you will be hopeless, with them you will die. Nami, will you come and stand by my side or not? The decision is yours.

This isn't fair! If I remain friends with Luffy and the others, everyone will be killed! But if I go with Arlong, everyone from the village will be saved. Their lives depend on my choice...

Not fair!
No matter what she chooses, he'll never set her free!

But...
Luffy...
Help me...

That's for Nami!

I have to believe in him!
All right, everyone! We'll fight to the death! Got it?

Yeah!
Let's go for it!

Well then... It looks like they've made up their minds.

Please live! Please live!

What?

All right... Now just remove his leg weight...

I see. That's what you meant.

[???] no way!

Luffy's alive!

Hey, hang in there! You can't give up now!

Therty seconds... That's all I got...

Zoro...

That'll be enough!

There isn't a fountain over there.
Could it be that rubber man?

Just stay back! You're not getting anywhere near him!

Ah, Zoro... I thought I told you to never say that again. Now prepare to die!

If I kick and break that leg weight, he can fight. Luffy, you're the only one who can fight now.

In the sea, one with Devil Fruit powers is supposed to lose even the energy to struggle, not to mention his powers. He will die. [And] if he's still alive, well, that wouldn't be fair.

You're okay? Please say you're fine!

Sure. I'm fine.

You scared us.

Where'd your pinwheel go? It was cool.

We've got bigger [phase] to worry about right now!

Wouldn't be fair? This game hasn't been fair from the moment we started playing it.

Well, anyways - if there's a hindrance, I should be aware of it. Correct?

Egg Star!
I've got your back, Zoro!

Big Bro Usopp! He's all right!

How brave! And he got here just in time!

Go on! Give it to him!

That's where you are?!

He's all right!

Hey, Nami! I beat one of their leaders! Can you believe it?! I [wait the smog off/wiped the smile off] his stupid face! Choo-choo. Hahaha! Fishmen are so easy!

No! You... beat Choo?!

That's right! And now when I'm back it's time we finish this once and for all. This is the end, Arlong!

Think! Is there any way you can free yourself?

Nope. Can't do it. My energy is way too low.

Come on! Come on! Come out!

All right, Cook! Now if he can just set Big Bro Luffy free, the fishmen will be running for their lives!

Go, Zoro! Take down Arlong once and for all!

Huh?
Okay! We have to somehow prevent Arlong from getting into the sea! I'll just keep him from going anywhere.

I won't let you have your way!

Hey, Arlong! I've got a present for you!

Huh? What's he doing?!

He's so brave!

Usopp Rubberband of Doom!

You seem to keep standing in my way. I take it you wish to die first then. I can take care of that.

Zoro! Now!

What do you think you're doing, Usopp?!

Now [it's] my chance!
All I want is a piece of that proud nose!

You fool! It's a proud nose because it's unbreakable.
If you were at full strength, you may have been able to give it a little scratch.

No!

Look! Over there!

Hm...? That damn octopus is up!

What's he doing?

Ahh! Seriously, I thought the rubberband was gonna fly at me!

What?!

What?!
He's the one I was aiming for!

But weren't you yelling "Arlong", huh?

Oh great...!

We're not done, Zoro! You may've put me down, but it wasn't for good! 'Cause I'm still alive and now I'm gonna finish off your friend!

No need to be concerned, seeing as how you'll all be dead, anyway.

Big Bro!

You've done enough, Nojiko! Leave the rest to me!

A fishman!

Watch out! I'll break the rock with a kick!

What?!

Octopus [Fritter] Frenzy!

No!

Zoro!

So, that's it, huh?
Way too easy.
Hmm... What's with all these bandages?
Did you have a good fall?

Ahh!

What's this scar?
I can't believe he's breathing. How can he still be alive with the body like this? Is he dying already? Am I fighting a wounded man? Either way, he's about to die. He's going to die right here and now!

Hahaha!
If a person stays put, their wounds won't open up!

Is that right? Do you find your situation amuzing?

I'm not talking about me - I'm talking about the Octo-man.

What?!

I thought we told you - we'll win this game!

That was too close!
You are the one who made this complicated in the first place!

He did it!

It's time to take care of that shark!
Hurry up, you idiot!

Did they free you?

Yes!
Ahh! I'm back!

Yeah!
Yahoo!

It's him!

Our hero's back!

Luffy!

That rubber bastard!

You're... a bit... late...

Zoro!

Hey!... Hold on!... What are you...?!

Let's switch!

You idiot!

Gum-Gum... Bell!
And Whip!
Gum-Gum... Pistol!
Gatling!
Yes!

Is that all you got?

It's not working!

Nope. Just a worm-up.

That idiot!
I'm gonna kill him!

What a bunch of fools!
You think you can actually beat me?
You were better off drowning on the ocean floor!

No, I don't think so. I like it up here. Yep.

Do you not understand my anger?
I saw my brothers crushed like worms!
You'll realize soon enough that you should've quit fighting a long time ago.

Do you think Luffy is gonna be okay?
I mean Arlong doesn't seem to be affected by his attacks at all.

[That] more importantly just how far away do you think Zoro flew?!

Luffy! I've got your back, pal!

No need to worry.

If he loses, then we'll all die.

Yeah, we will...

If that happens, it's the end of the East Blue, too.

Do you know what the biggest difference between you and me is?

The nose?
The jaw?

Uh... what's he doing...?

Uh... I don't know...

Webbing!

Species!

Oh man! I bet that [had] to be painful! His teeth must be--

He bit through that stone pillar!

Wow! If he bites you, he won't just leave marks - he'll bite right through your bones!

You see, this is the inherent power of fishmen. I feel sorry for you humans having been created with such limited power. We've been on [a] different level since the beginning of time. You are inferior. It only makes sense for you to bow before me. You're so weak. Your presence on this planet is deplorable. Don't you think your time is come to an end?
I'll show you... Show you the real difference between you and I.

Sure. Go ahead!
There's no way I'm losing to a fishman.
Because... I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!


Hey, where did Arlong go?

The sea!

The sea?! Whoa! There's a shark!

That's Arlong!

He ran away?

This isn't good! He [keeps] even stronger when he's in the water!

Ahh! Watch out!

Wahhh!

Luffy!

On the next One Piece
"Explosion! Fishman Arlong's Fierce Assault from the Sea!"

I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
