  Luffy... Help me.

That's for making our navigator cry!
Time for something new.
Gum-Gum Pinwheel!
No way! No way! No way!

Did you know that those with devil fruit powers can't swim?
But honestly anybody in this situation would sink right to the bottom!

The sea! No!

Gum-Gum Pistol!

Luffy!

Damn you!

I'm almost out of breathe.

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:0:&lt;h1&gt; 

So, what do you boys think?
Isn't this an exciting game?
I can't wait to see how it ends!
Who'll die first - you or that rubber man.

This is bad, Johnny!
Luffy's totally trapped down there!

Big Bro Luffy!

I'll beat his ass real quick and then come save you, Luffy!

Hachi Ink Jet!
You bastard! My hair!
But it's okay. It's only hair. They'll grow back.

Huh?

Now Zoro, you can't beat me. I have six hands, that will mesmerize you with a wiggly beauty.

Shut up!

Hachi's Triple Sword Catch!
Now you will see my skills!
That hurt!

I don't have time for this crap!
Oh, not now!

Is he still hurt?

[Lose focus and you lose your life]

I bet you taste good with butter!

We've got no time left... No time...
Why don't you die?!

Too bad!
Hachi Suckers
[air/I] stuck!

Don't you stick there! Get down here and fight!
Damn coward!

Stupid octopus! He's just trying to waste our time!

But If we try to save Luffy now, they'll just drag us to the bottom of the sea and we'll drown.

If we sit here and do nothing then Luffy drowns for sure!

We've got to think of a way to help him!

Yeah!

Hold up!
[What good of the two of you gonna do in the sea when you both can barely walk?] If you're trying to figure out a way to save that young man, then I believe I should be the one to volunteer ahead of you.

You'll sasve him?

His survival is the key to our winning. If we don't save him then we'll certainly lose. Wouldn't you agree?

Genzo?!
I'm coming with you!
Let's do it!
I'm in!

I'm going alone. The fishmen will suspect that we're up to something if we go with such a large crowd. And I fear doing so may cause more harm than good.

But we could help you!

Not another word about it. There's no point endangering more people than we have to. I must go alone. If that's okay, well, boys?

Yes. Thank you.

We're counting on you. But please, hurry.

Hold on!
Genzo! I'm going too!

Nojiko, you're hurt!

You're not going to leave me out of this when those guys are fighting for my sister's life! You can't.

Fine. Come on. We have to hurry.

Right!

I'm sorry. If only I was stronger...

Please save Luffy. Don't be too late.

Bastard fishman!

Hey, I have a question that I've been meaning to ask you, Zoro! You're famous for your Three-Sword Technique, so why are you only using one?

You're running scared with one, why would I need three?

Shut up! I've just been playing around with you! Actually, humans can't defeat me. I could tell you why, but I think it'll be more fun to show you! Yeah, show! I like that! I think you're really going to enjoy it a lot, too.

Dammit! I can't fight back the pain! And my fever... it's getting worse... I thought I could walk it off, but...

Huh?

Crap!! I thought as much! You still haven't recovered from your fight with Hawk-Eye!

Zoro!

I'm not stupid! Falling for the old injured animal routine... that's for children! You're right back! It's time for you to see what my true skills really are!
Now you may tremble in fear at Hachi's Way of Six Blades!
Hey! You're not supposed to die yet! I haven't even killed you!

No! Zoro!

I knew it! He's been faking it!

So true. The way he's been pummeled would kill any normal guy, but he tries to fight anyway!

What'd you say?!

I thought it was strange. He walked around just like nothing had happened after such a horrible fight. He's laid out plat--

I told you to pay attention to me, you weakling. I'm a 40th dan in Fishman Karate.

Whoa, what the... what the hell just happened?

Sanji?

It can't be him!
Sanji!

They've taken care of, Arlong. What would you like us to do with Zoro?

What a waste of time! Just toss him in the sea. Hardly entertaining.

Oh, that's all?

Well, they did manage to make a bit of a mess.

No big deal as long as Arlong Park is still standing.

True.

No fair! He killed himself! I never got a chance to show him how great of a swordsman I am! If he [could've] died on one of my six blades, I could've stolen his fame!
Well, it's no matter. There's not a human alive that can compare to my Way of Six Blades! Behold the superior power that only a six-sword master swordsman can [attain]!

Enough, Hachi. I understand how you must feel, but if you continue this little demonstration, you'll destroy Arlong Park.

Ah?! I'm sorry. I forgot I could destroy stuff.

Don't get carried away.

I'm fine now.

Way of Six Blades? What a loser!

Huh?

Way to go!

You're not dead!
Let me make this clear for you, you sorry excuse for a swordsman. There's a certain man I have to face and until I see him... Death himself cannot touch me!

Damn! That Long-nose freak is fast! I can't believe he's not getting tired. Choo!

Hahaha! If he keeps following me then he can't fight Luffy and the others guys. [I'm a master destroctor.] I'm such a smart and helpful friend! Who knew that the running for your life like a scared little irl could be so brave?! Hehehe... Let's see... I can't even see him back there! Man, I'm too fast! I guess I should've slowed down a little bit. They may be able to swim like fish when they're in the water, but on land they're just like turtles. That's right. [Stewed]

[Neri neri bu bu!] Stupid, stupid turtleman! You can't catch anything! You just got a big mouth! Big mouth stupid turtle guy! Hahaha!

You're very funny man, but you're not very smart, aren't you?
Get back here!

He's only been drowned for a little while. If we can get [it] back [off], we can revive [him].

Dammit! I can't swing hard enough under water to break this thing!

Hurry, Genzo!

It's no use. I can't break it. He needs oxygen now, but there's no time to get an air canister. And we can't carry him up with this rock.

That's it!

Ah! He's still alive!

Alright, Big Bro!

That's the best punch that fishman's got? The old man's kicks were a hundred times worse than that. And I never even [died].

What's wrong with you, Zoro? You look like you're having a really bad day or something. I've already demonstrated my way of the Six Blades to these pathetic humans and there's no way you can hope to defeat me in that condition.

Oh just shut up already!

Big Bro... He's taking such a beating...

I'm sure [the ?unset?] of fever caused by his wounds is making him delirious. Or worse. If that wound opens up again, I'm afraid he'll die for certain.

But he doesn't have time to think about that right now!

Yeah! And he's the only one who can fight that six-sword freak!

I'll show you Three Swords Style!

Hm?

Yosaku! Johnny! Lend me your swords!

Of course!
Big Bro, catch!

Dammit! I'm losing it! I don't know how much longer I can last...

Big Bro, here they come!

Catch them!

Ha! Now you'll understand why two human hands never have a chance to beat me!
Six Blades!

Watch out!

Tentacle-Sword Overload!

Big Bro!

Three Swords Style!
Streaming Wolf-Swords!

He did it!

He faced all six swords! And not even a scratch!

Perfect sword's skill with perfect concentration!

How dare you cut me like that?! Now I'm really mad! I'll kill you, bastard! There's no way you'll survive my next attack! You just got lucky! [It's all!] You'll never beat my six swords with your three! I have twice as many swords as you! Don't you get it?! Six is more!

I was never [?be?] good at [Math/Maths}...

What is it, then? What weight do you carry [out] on your shoulders? Speak up, weakling!

I'll get stronger! Stronger than she ever was! Do you hear me?! Strong enough that my name reaches up to the Heavens! I am going to be the world's greatest swordsman!

Three swords... Six swords... Does it matter?! You may have more swords than me, but mine will always carry more weight than yours!

Weight you say? It may not look like it, but my swords actually weight quite a bit. Over 300 pounds each, to be exact. They weight much more than your pathetic human swords.

I meant the burden of-- Oh, forget it.

Way of Six Swords! Octopus Pot Stance!
New Year's... Open!
Body Slam!

Cheap shot, stupid octopus!

How's that?!

Big Bro!...

He's dead!

You'll never touch the ground alive!
Waltz of Six Swords!
You'll be mincemeat if you touch [the breath] in a second!

Big Bro!

Yes!
All right!

Dammit! First you timed your roll to dodge my Tentacle-Sword Overload, then you sliced and diced my hands up like some cheap sushi chef?! How dare you make a spectacle of my master swordsmanship?! You'll pay for that, you son of the bitch! I'll tear your [limb from limb]!

Look at that - he's in pain...

That attack... It probably opened up his wounds again.

I wish I could take his place right now...

Even if this wound would kill a normal man, I am not allowed to fail!

Way of Six Swords! Octopus Pot Stance!
Time to die, Zoro!

My body cannot feel the pain. Must not!

New Year's...

If I'm ever going o face Hawk-Eye as an equal, I must be extraordinary!
Dragon Twister!

Hachi...

Defeated... Three-Sword Style...

So fish, now you finally understand the weight I carry in my three swords... You satisfied?

It's enough crying. And enough sitting around! It's time to make a decision.
I've got to go! They're all fighting for me!

All right. Now that [tentacles/tentaclous] is [out of the way], I think it's time to go rescue Luffy.

No! Look out!

How could you do that to Hachi?!
You...

You thought you'd gotten rid of me, huh?

Not bad. I didn't know there was anyone in all the East Blue who could stand back up after one of my punches.

Oh sure. There's a whole bunch and a certain restaurant I know of. Wanna go?

I don't think so.

Big Bro! Don't do it!

What do you think you're doing? You're dead if you go into water like that.

Just shut up! He won't last too much more. You think you [ladies might wanna stop chatting]?

Yeah. Time's up. If I can get you to shut up for a moment, maybe you would've noticed that I was about to do this.
Here goes nothing!

That's great! He wants to try his luck in the water! Against the fishman!

Stupid! I told you they want us to fight in the water!

That man is from Cocoyashi Village...! They've stretched out Luffy's neck!

I'm sorry, but this is the best I can do for you. Please, try to breathe. Please!

Come back! Dammit! I can't hold my breath much longer. You have to come back now!

I see. They couldn't move the stone, so they just moved Luffy's head above the water. All I have to do is break the rock apart and [a] situation should take care of itself.

Fishman Karate! Forearm Sledge!

Ha-ha-ha! This is more like it! Somebody else, do something entertaining!

You have to come back!
Please hurry!

Stop following me!



Ahhh!

That bastard is attacking me from behind!
This isn't good!

In order to rescue Luffy--

I don't care! I'm going to beat him for Nami!

So that's what you're thinking.

Ahhh!

Shut up!

On the next One Piece!
"Proud Warriors! Sanji and Usopp's Fierce Battles!"

I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
