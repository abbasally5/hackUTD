  Never even in a million years would Nami kill Usopp! She wouldn't do that to our friends.

What was that about friends, Luffy? Friends, huh? Don't make me laugh. You're just pathetic enough to deserve each other.

Now I see. Yeah, that would hit her hard. To think that someone actually showed up for her... Friends... That word means pain. It breaks her heart.

So that's it. That's how Nami pretended to kill me and make sure I [could] escape from Arlong Park. Looks to me like she's got some sort of hidden motive for hanging out with a bunch of renegade fishmen.

Just trust me. Don't get yourselfs involved in what's going on here and leave poor Nami alone. I'll explain the situation.

I'll pass.

Hey! Wait!

I don't care about her past.

Where are you going, Luffy?

For a walk.

Who is he?

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:0:&lt;h1&gt; 

That's really strange! I've never seen a ship fall out of the sky before.

Yeah. Me neither. It would seem we have some unusual visitors.

The question is why are they here?

Hey, you guys, look! He's not from this island!

Oh wow! They must be fishmen!

Hey, you there! Wait!

Huh? You mean me?

Who are you?! And what are you doing on this island?!

Why? What does it matter to you?

Well... It's just that we don't get many visitors.

Ow, my name's Luffy. I'm just passing through.

Huh?! Passing through?! Well, have a nice time!

Hey, smartass! Where are you going?

Heck if I know!

He seems like he'd be a fun guy to have around!

Yeah, sure. But who the hell is he?

He walked right by us and wasn't even intimidated. I've never seen that before.

Bellemere? So you're saying that she raised both you and Nami?

That's right. She did. I guess I should start at the beginning.

I fell asleep. Oh, no! Nojiko! I wonder where'd she run off to?
Hm, just a little more, Bellemere. Just a little more and everything will be ours again. Cocoyashi Village, the tangerine farm... Everything.
It's taken eight years...

It's done. It's done! Yeah!

Now if I could just get that book...

Hey, that you, Nami? Do you need any help there?

No, I'm just looking! I'll be going now!

That's too bad.

Damn it, Nami! Not again!

Let me go!

Sticky fingers, eh, Nami?
She'll never learn!

I'm not a cat!

You little urchin! How many times do I have to tell you that stealing is wrong!

How else am I gonna get what I need? i don't have any money! Cheapskate!

Bellemer! Bellemere! I caught her stealing again! Now open up this door!

What do you want now?
You're back! That was a quick trip!

I got a ride!

Listen! You'd better get control [of//over] her! [???]

Thanks for the advice. Haven't you ever seen something you've wanted and just taken it?

You are the reason she acts this way!

Relax! I'm just kidding. I hope you were kind enough to pay for her.

Uh, Bellemere...

Thanks so much! I don't have the money right now. I'll pay somehow. Does that sound good?

You can't say things like that!

Look, he's as red as a beet!

Now then, [laugh at ?uppoil you still can, Nami.]
Do that one more time and you won't be able to sit for a week!

I'm sorry! It' just... that I... I really need that book, Bellemere.

Then why didn't you ask me if I would buy it for you?

Because I know you can't afford it.

Of course, I can. There's money leftover from the last harvest.

But I heard them in the village. They said the weather has been so good lately that everyone's tangerines [will sell]! Which means we can raise our price so we may not be able to sell it all!

They don't know that [they talking] about!

Way to go, Nami! If I had stolen it there's no way I would've been caught!

No more stealing! Right?

I was just joking! That's all!

[That really hurt!]

I'm sorry, but one thing's for sure. The maps you draw are so amazing, Nami! I see you can draw land maps as well as see charts.

That's a map of our island, isn't it?

Nobody [would] believe that such a little girl drew [this] all by herself!

I wanted the book so I'll be able to start studying navigation.

Navigation as well?!

You're goona be a navigator?

That's right! I'm gonna guide ships around all the oceans of the world. It'll be great! And I'll be able to make maps of all the far-off places I'll go!

So this island map is the first step [to at] realizing your dream, is that it?

[Aha.]

A world map, huh? Nami, your dream is going to come true! I have no doubt!

Hey, uh, Bellemere? Why haven't you been eating dinner with us lately?

I've been eating tangerines. I've just been on a diet. That's all.

Then I don't wanna eat, either.

[What's with all of the drama?] You need to eat because you are a growing girl!

Why do you keep lying to us?! You're noy eating because we don't have enough money to buy food! That's why!

Really?!

You're starving yourself so that we won't go hungry!

Tangerines replenish my skin with the power of liquid sunlight. And they are the only reason I am still such a ravishing beauty even [know] I'm in my extremely 20's.

But your hands are all yellow.

Would you just shut up and eat your food already!

And here you go, Nami! All done! [A Bellemere one of the kind original!]

Oh, great! A hand-me-down!

Yeah, that's true. But it suits you! [See? Look!]

[But] the lion used to be a sunflower!

Quit complaining! You have to take my hand-me-downs or you won't get any new clothes!

But it's not fair! You [???] new clothes all the time and mine are all used!

I get old clothes too, you know! So just [suck it up], Nami, and take what you get! Understand?!

We didn't come from the same parents, anyway! We're not real sisters, so who cares!

Nami!

Bellemere, please!

So what if you don't have the same parents? I don't ever wanna hear you say anything like that again!

I don't care. You're not even our real mother! You're just some lady who's taken care of us! You wish we'd never come here, so you could buy clothes and food for yourself [You'd be better [???] without us, [would you]? I wish... I wish someone rich would had adopted us instead of the [sticky] loser like you!

Well, fine! If you hate it here [???] so much, you can go find some place else to live if you want! I didn't sign up for this.

Stop fighting! Please, just stop!

I'm never coming back!

Nami! Stop! Nami!

Bellemere, the three of us are a family! That's the truth! And you know Nami feels the same! No matter what she said!

Look, who is being the adult here! I blew up and [???you were level had it one,]. Why don't you go and find Nami. I'll make something special for dinner and we can all make up, okay?

Sorry, lady. [Two for five] is the lowest price I can offer.
Is that really your best offer?
[?Hive off!]. Today only! Fresh [fruits]!
You won't find a lower price anywhere today! I guarantee it or your money back!

So you've run away from home and come to the village. Now what's the plan? Drink before it gets cold.

Bellemere would be co much happier if she didn't have to take care of us.

And why would you say that?

Well, you need a lot of maney to take care of two kids. And because of me the whole village hates her right now.

That's progress At least, you're considering others. But don't worry. When Bellemere was your age she was a complete nightmare terrorizing the entire village.

Is that the truth?

Sure. Even now the villagers look at her [as] some kind of [screwup]. So you can imagine how surprised everyone in the village was when she joined up with the marines, huh.

Marines?! You mean Bellemere was in the Marines?!

That's right. She said she couldn't stand by and do nothing [while/though] pirates kill innocent people. Then she left the village.
She was [tittering] on the verge of death when...

If this is the end then so be it.
Huh?
Your little sister?

I found her.

How did she survive?!

That innocent child was you, Nami. And seeing how precious you were gave Bellemere [other right] reasons to live again.

It is a ship! I knew it!
Who on earth would be [on it/out] in such a terrible storm?!

Doctor! I need a doctor!

What's going on? What happened to you, Bellemere?

Bellemere?!

Did somebody call for a doctor? Who are these children?

Doctor! They're burning up! I afraid they might be really sick! Please, help them!

Give them here.
Alrigt. And we'd better mend up those nasty wounds of yours as well, young lady.

Never mind me! Please, just don't let them die! You have to save them! I'm begging you, doctor!

I don't believe it. Say that whole thing again.

I [said I'm] gonna try to be the mother of these two girls. Is that simple?

No way!

That's insane! You are far too immature [to handle] this much responsibility!

You can't handle them by yourself! Just hand them over to the--

I've made my mind! You can't denied that I'm an adult. And that I've lived [???] as a marine has given me the right to be treated with more respect. I'm perfectly capable of taking care of these two girls. And nothing can stop me from raising them to be wonderful girls. So now we're going to be a family togather. Nami and Nojiko have renewed my love of life.

The bond between the three of you girls goes far deeper than any normal family.

Nami! i thought I'd find you her!

Nojiko?!

Come on! Belemere is waiting for us! She's making us a special supper!

Sure!

I think she's making your favorite omelets with tangerine sauce!

Yea! I love omelets! All right!

Time sure flies. It seems like it was only yesterday that they were fighting for [their very lives].

I think it makes everyone in the village happy to see those girls grow up so full of life.

That's true. Their family has suffered so much over the years. It's good to know that they manage to overcome it, right?

Pirates are coming! Everybody, run! Pirates! Ouick! The pirates are coming! Hide!

What?

The Arlong Pirates!
Arlong?!
That's impossible!
Why would fishmen from the Grand Line come here?!
The rumor about the split between the fishmen pirates must be true!

Nami! Nojiko!

Genzo?!

It's too dangerous for you here. Go hide in the woods!

But what about--

You must go! Now!

Greetings and salutations, you pathetic little humans! From this moment on, this entire island and its inhabitants are a part of my domain!

Yeah!

Listen closely! From now on, on the first day of every month you will buy your lives from me!

A hundred thousand Berries for adults, fifty thousand for children! Those who cannot pay will die!

What should we do, Nojiko? We don't have that much money!

Maybe the fishmen won't be able to find our house. You can't see it from here.

Is that it? So what's the whole?

About 25 million, give or take.

You all shall live!

It looks like we each have to pay one hundred thousand Berries to these fishmen every month just to stay alive.

There's no way we could survive!

We don't have a choice. We should just be happy that nobody in the village has been killed yet.
If all they want is money, it's an easy price to pay. I just hope they'll leave without noticing Belemere's house. With two children she'd need two hundred thousand Berries. Ther's no way she has that much saved.

It's time to leave! Come, brothers!

Arlong! There's smoke coming from outside the village!

Huh?!

Okay! Let's see! Delicious! There's anything quite as tasty as my special tangerine sauce! Nami and Nojiko are gonna love it!

It looks like chimney smoke from somebody's house.

Oh? We almost missed that one!

Bellemere!

All right! Let's go, guys!

This is bad! The pirates are going to Bellemere's house!

Genzo, Look! Nojiko and Nami are gone!

What did you say?!

I think the duck needs amother 10 minutes. And a stew is almost ready. This is definitely gonna blow my budget. But sometimes you gotta live a little.

Bellemere... Bellemere!
Bellemere is gonna be killed!

--ENDING--

Nami was so cute as a child!
Jeez! Did you even listen to the story?!
Of course! I heard every single word! About Nami. You got that?
Yeah. Sorry. Wait! Why am I apologizing?!
Is it over? Where's Lufffy?
He was really sleeping?!

On the next One Piece
"Survive! Mother Bellemere and Nami's Bond"

I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
