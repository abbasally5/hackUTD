  What's wrong, little girl? I bet it's the village. You want it left alone. Then how about this? Let's make an agreement, okay?

An agreement?

That's right. Gather up one hundred million Berries, then bring it to me. Do so and will let your village go in addition to giving you your freedom.

Promise?

I promise. And I'm the kind of fishman who'd rather die than break an agreement concerning money. And I don't even care how long it takes you. I will honor our agreement.

I'm gonna save a hundred million Berries! Bellemere, I will do it! I don't care what it takes!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:0:&lt;h1&gt; 

Genzo? And the marines?!

Are you the pirate thief known as Nami? The marine sources have revealed that you have quite a [???] some of treasure that you stolen from pirates. The government hereby confiscates [all set property]. It is required that you comply immediately.
Sorry. Perhaps, you didn't hear me the first time. The government hereby confiscates everything you've stolen. It is required that you comply immediately. Do you understand?

Isn't that something? I can see you're very passionate about your duties. You won't bring a brutal gang of pirates to justice. [???] you'll shake down a lowly sneak thief! That's so very noble.

I'm only gonna warn you once. I'm one of the leaders of the Arlong Pirates! If you mess with me, Arlong won't sit by quietly!

Silly girl. Who do you think I am? Do you honestly think you can intimidate me?
Find the stolen goods!

Don't move!
I said stop!
Do you really think this is what the marines should be doing now?! The Arlong Pirates are murderers! They destroyed entire cities and you're doing nothing! He's ruling over this island and trampling over people's lives! You ignore Arlong's atrocity [just to steal] from the thief?! Is that what you stand for?!

Big talk from a [???filiti] criminal.
Continue the search, men!

Every person on this island has been waiting for the marines to come and help them for years! How dare you pass them by and come here searching for money?!

Colonel! This tangerine orchard seems a little suspicious!

Dig it up! The whole [thing] if need be!

Keep your filthy hands off Bellemere's tangerine orchard!
I won't let you take my money! That money is for... it's for...

That poor girl's money is meant to save Cocoyashi Village! What gives you the right to take our salvation away from her?! Damn you!

My, my! A mere village representative, talking down to a marine colonel?! How bold!

Genzo, how do you know about that?

I've always known, Nami.

I'm... joining Arlong's crew.

Nami?!

But why?!

I couldn't believe what you'd done, so I confronted Nojiko about it later. Since then, everyone has known that you stayed with the Arlong Pirates so that you could save the village. But we all agreed we'd never tell you that we knew. If you ever thought the villagers were placing their hopes on you, you might never leave his gang for fear of letting us down.

That can't be...

Now, hold on a minute. Just what are you trying to say here? Are telling me that the villagers are thieves?! And we should arrest everyone of them? Is that what you're saying?

What he's saying is that every last one of us is fighting to survive! We have to [think for] ourselves because we can't rely on support from you, government people! So, if you're not gonna protect our village then get the hell out of here! And be quick about it or Arlong will sink your ship, too!

Arlong will? I wouldn't be so sure...
You still haven't found it?! We're looking for a hundred million Berries here! Not a grain of rice!

Huh?
Hey, you! How do you know how much there is?!

Well, I don't know. I just have a hunch that that's the amount we're looking for.

It's him...
Tell me! It was Arlong who sent you, wasn't it?!

Of course not. I wouldn't do [a] pirates dirty work. [That be wrong.] I'm just a public servant dealing with thief the way any government worker would.

You corrupt marine scum pig!

The marines have stooped to be nothing but pirate cronies!

Arlong!

Sir! I found it!

Incredible! I must say I'm impressed you've gathered this much treasure!

The money's all ragged and bloody.

No matter! Money is money!
Thirty percent of this is all mine!

Don't touch that!... Don't touch that!... Don't touch that!...

Nami!

Stop it! Don't touch that! Stop it!

Nami...

Nojiko... Nojiko!

A pinwheel, huh? It's so cool!
I just thought of a new move!

Doctor! Doctor!

Genzo! What is it?!

Nojiko's been shot!

By who?

The marines.

The marines?!

Nojiko?

I'm alright.

Arlong has been working with those damn marines.

What?!

He's been lying to Nami for the last eight years. He never intended to honor their agreement at all!

That bastard!
Oh, no! That means...
That scoundrel! He lied to our Nami!
Poor Nami...

Nami...

Hey, Nami! What's up? Need help with anything?

Why are you still here? Stay out of my business! Just get away from my island!

Arlong... Arlong! Arlong!!!

And I'm the kind of [fishman] who'd rather die than break an agreement concerning money. And I don't even care how long it takes you. I will honor our agreement.

Arlong!

What's her problem?

Arlong!

What seems to be the problem, all-skilled surveyor of ours? Why the sore face?

Those marine maggots, you keep on the payroll, stole every last Berry I had! What happened to all that crap about dying before [you'd ever] break a promise when it comes to money?! Bastard!

Refresh my memories. Did I break a promise?

Don't play dumb with me! I know that you teamed up with the marines--

Just when did I break that promise? Speak up, girl!

Damn you... Damn you! Damn you!

Too bad all your stolen money got stolen. That certainly is unfortunate. But a deal is a deal, Nami. If you can't come up with one hundred million Berries then both you and your village stay in my posession indefinitely. Well, you know the terms.

You pig!

It's only one hundred million Berries! Start saving again and you'll have it in no time! Or are you gonna run out on me? Listen, if you do that, I'll kill everyone in that village. Do you understand me?

Nami. We agreed we would never tell you that we knew. If you thought all of us were counting on you, you would be bound by guild never to leave his gang for fear of letting us down.

Oh, running away so soon?

Shouldn't we chase after her?

No need for that. Ttrust me, Hatchi. She's not going anywhere. There's no way Nami could just abandon the lives of all those villagers.

Choo! Now that's what I call playing dirty.

There's no way I'd let go [???] like Nami that easily. I'm maybe cruel, but I'm not totally heartless. Once she's done charting all the world's oceans, she'll have her freedom.

That's pretty [???], man! It'll take decades for sure!
Yeah, I bet a hundred years would be enough!

All right! Let's go meet up with Luffy as soon as possible!
Hey, Sanji! What are you doing?

I'm appreciating happiness.

Wait, what are you talking about?

Nami's had to live with way more suffering than any normal person. Right now I'm making a lot of good vibes so [I can send them her away]. Isn't everything great?

I bet that's not all you're thinking about, Love Cook.

I'm trying to fight for a beautiful person. Is something wrong with that?

That's not right at all! This is supposed to be for Nami and all of the villagers!

Yeah-yeah...

Quit bickering! Let's go!

We've had enough! Take up arms! It's time to fight!

Yeah!

Genzo! Please, don't do anything stupid! We have to live or our struggles will mean nothing! You can't throw your lives away!

Eight long years ago, we promised we wouldn't live our lives in vain! No matter the pain or humiliation [we endure] under Arlong, we swore to fight the long fight so Nami could meet their demands! But they lied! They never intend to keep their end of the deal! [???] they stole our only chance [at] freedom! So now we should make those filthy fishmen pay for the years they manipulated that [???] young girl! Am I right?!

Yeah! Let's do this!
We were always ready to fight those monsters!
Let's get them!
Time to show those lousy stinking fishmen what we made of!
Yeah!

Everybody, wait!

Nami!...

Calm down! It's not that much money! I can make it back in no time! I'll take care of it! Don't worry! That will be easy this time! I'm used to it! I'll be fine! Just relax! Everything is okay! Hey! It's nothing compared to back then!

It's okay! You don't need to save me!

Come on, everyone! I'm perfectly fine!

You've done enough. You have to know that there's no point now. You struggled so hard carrying our lives on your back this whole time. I can only image that joining them must've been more painful than being stabbed through the heart. You fought very well.

Genzo...

Set yourself free from this village.

Genzo?...

Nami! Do it!

What?! Nojiko!

Nami.
Go on.

You're an exceptional young woman. And you have a dream!

Everyone, listen! I won't let you go! Just stay right there. I'm not gonna let anyone else get hurt by these monsters! You'll all die.

We know that.

Nami! It's no use. We've made up our minds!

Get out of the way!

Move [out/off]! We may not win but we will give them hell!

Arlong! Arlong! Arlong! Arlong! Arlong! Arlong! Ar--
Luffy... What do you want? You don't know anything about this. You don't know what's been happening on this island for the past eight years.

Nope. I don't.

This has nothing to do with you! I told you to leave this place!

Yep. You sure did.

So leave! I told you to leave! Get out of here! Get out of here now! Go! Go away! Go! Go! Go! Luffy... Help me...

Of course. That's what friends do.
He's gonna pay!

You'd better keep your hands off my hat!

Luffy...

Let's go!

Right!

Hey! Are you guys alright?

Did Arlong do this to you?

Move aside! We have business to take care with the fishmen!

When we finally found out the truth about Big Sis Nami, we realized the only thing we could do was defeat Arlong in battle. So we decided to come back here and challenge him.

Yeah. Then we lost, but only by a hair!

I'm sorry, but I can't let you through this door. You have no chance of victory.

What's that?!

Be patient. It won't be long now. You see, we're waiting for the arriving of certain men.

What certain men?

Don't worry. They'll be here soon. I'd bet my life on it.

There!

It's them?!

But why would they come to defend our village?

If those men can't handle Arlong and his gand then there really is no hope.

Not only for this island but for the whole East Blue.

Those are the faces of the four men who are here to change your destiny!

Burn their images into your memory!

Step aside!

Hey, do you think those two idiots that showed up earlier [are members] of Zoro's little crew?

Zoro? They seemed too weak for that. They weren't even worth killing.

That's for sure!
What the--

Now which one of you is Arlong?

--ENDING--

You just had to run ahead by yourself! I said don't hog all the pray!
Really? Huh.
What's wrong?
Yeah, that's the thing! i'm kind of in trouble! Hear me out!
Oh, crap! That guy plans to do something!
What do I do?! What do I do?! What do I do?! What do I do?!
Luffy!

On the next One Piece:

"Luffy in Big Trouble!
Fishmen vs. the Luffy Pirates!"

I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
