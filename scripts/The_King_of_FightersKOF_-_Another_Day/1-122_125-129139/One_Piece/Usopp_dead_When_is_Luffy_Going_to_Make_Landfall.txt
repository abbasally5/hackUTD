  Your already bad reputation just keeps getting worse.

That's fine. I am a pirate. Arlong can be a very reasonable guy when he wants to. I just need a little more money to finish our agreement. You know, it's really not that high a price considering that it's gonna buy back our village!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:0:&lt;h1&gt; 

Yeah! Faster! To Arlong Park!
Nami, hang on!

Let go! Find him! I want that long-nosed freak now! To think some lowly human scum would defy us, the fishmen!... Come on! We're going back to Arlong Park!

Oh man, I can't shake these guys!

Hey, where'd he go?

All those in favor of leaving Usopp alone say aye!
Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye!

You fool! You're dumber than I thought.

Ah, you agree with me, too? It's great!
Egg Star! Special Attack!

Ow, rotten eggs!
I think I'm gonna ralph.
I can't breathe.

I guess fishmen are all they're cracked up to be. Not one of those scaly morons can catch Captain Usopp!
Well, that's weird. I'm back at a shore. I mean, how did I get here?

I think I heard him over here.
Huh! No one's here!
Must have been hearing things. That guy sure can run.
Alright, men! Let's move on!

I don't know.

Rat! I hope for your sake you're not lying to me.

Hey! Huh? What? Ah! Yeah, I'm fine! Thanks for asking! I've made it down safe and sound as you can see!

I can't tell you how pleased [that] I am that you're safe.

Yeah...

What's taking so long? Luffy, where are you?! Five more minutes of this and I'll keel over from boredom!

Incredible! What are you?! Some kind of super fish?! Not even the mighty Hatchan, octopus leader of the Arlong Pirates, can't pull you from the ocean?! What an epic battle! I don't know who you are, but you're the gutsiest fish in the East Blue! Hey! What the...? It was me all along?! You are indeed the gutsiest fish in the East Blue! Me! Hold on! That's weird.

It sure is.

Hey! Who are you? Speak up now! Ah? Who? Me? Well... I'm Hatchan! But all my friends call me Hachi!

You a fishman, too?

Of course, of course! I'm an amazing octopus fishman! It looks to me like you're just a human?

Yeah...

A marine? Or possibly a guest?

A guest? Ah... you could say that.

Arlong isn't here, is he?

No. I thought you might know where he is.

Apparently, there's some long-nosed guy running around causing trouble. So Arlong locked up the Long-nose's friend here, then went to Cocoyashi Village to hunt down that pesky troublemaker.

Oh man, Usopp. Well, I guess I'd better save him.
This Cocoyashi Village... How I get there?

Get in! You're a guest. Hop in! I'll take you, swordsman.

What the hell happened here?!
Who did this to you? Tell me who did this, brothers!

Roronoa...

What? What are you saying?

Roronoa Zoro...

What?! The Pirate Hunter?! Has he come to collect my head?!

We got him... That man we caught... That was him. He was Zoro...

That's him?!

Yes. The swordsman was Roronoa...

Choo! Arlong. Found him. He--
What is this?!

Took you long enough, Choo.

Don't tell that Zoro's...

Well, here we are! Cocoyashi Village. Arlong should be around here somewhere.

Oh! Great! Thanks!

No problem. Bye, now! Oh, one more thing! I completely forgot to ask you your name. What do you mean? We've been over this. I told you my name. Hatchan! Nice to meet'cha!

That was strange.

Catching this scum isn't enough to satisfy my hunger!

Huh? Oh yeah? Well, then let me go! Oh, and I'm sorry about earlier. I was just saying hello. That's how we do it in my village.

Long-nose, you are one of Zoro's men. It's only natural for well-known bounty hunters to come after me.

Please, don't kill me! I don't have anything to do with Zoro! I promise! Please, don't kill me.

Choo! Enough of your cowardly lies. Even if you don't know Zoro, you still stood against Arlong. You die either way.

Okay! No more lies! Zoro and I are like brothers! Partners for life! If you so much as lay one of your creepy wet fingers on me, he'll show up and kill you all!

Is that right? So if I kill you Zoro will show up?

No, no! That's not what I was trying to say! I was trying to say the exact opposite! Killing me is bad! If you keep me alive Zoro will show up! See?

What I want to know is how?... How did he escape?

What do you mean?

What I mean is someone let him escape. I think that somebody has betrayed us. Perhaps, it was Nami who let him in so that bastard could take your head.

Now that you mention it, she has been acting strange lately.
Yeah. She even helped Zoro when he jumped into the wather.
Don't tell me she was working with Zoro from the start...
And tricked us all!

Don't forget her chief skill is deception.

Enough of this! You should be ashamed. This is pure conjecture!

Nami?!...

How dare you... You [did] call me a traitor?! I swore I was a member of this group eight years ago. My loyalty is shown with this tattoo.

I'm sorry, Nami. It's natural for you to be upset, but you should know I don't suspect you of anything traitorous, Nami. I trust you. After all, we've known each other for eight years. We're just a little on edge right now. That's all. Surely, you can understand that. We need to focus on Zoro and his gang of bounty hunters.

Hey, Nami! Say something! Please, Nami!

You just had to go and do that!

What's wrong, Nami? You're pale. You feeling okay?
As for Long-nose here... not even you can save him now. No, not when he defied Arlong.

How long?... How long will I be suspected of betrayal?

You're too clever for your own good.

I'll have the amount Arlong and I agreed to soon! It doesn't make any sense for me to betray you now.

The amount they agreed to?!

I know. Eight years ago you agreed to purchase Cocoyashi Village for a hundred million Berries. But I just can't figure it out, you love nothing except money. You betrayed your family and your village for it. So, why do you care for this village now? This puny little heap of houses. I thought long and hard about it. But I found this in your room.

It can't be... That's my...

What?! What do you mean? You say he was captured?!

Yeah. They took him back to Arlong Park just a little while ago.

That courageous young man stood up to Arlong and those fishmen. He's probably dead by now.

This is bad. They won't be forgiving. He got caught right after my little visit.
Oh, Usopp! Hold on!

This looks suspiciously like a treasure map. And it seems to be pointed to Cocoyashi Village.

I can't believe you have the nerve to go through my personal belongings! That's my map and it has nothing to do with you!

So angry. Is there something on your mind?

What is this?! Why are all these guys dead?! What happened?!

The Pirate Hunter Zoro did it. Why weren't you here, Hachi, huh? This could've been prevented if you'd been here!

Of course it could've! Had I only been here! It's unforgivable!

We get it. You weren't here. [So,] you don't know where he is, is that right?

Well, let me think about it... I saw one guy. Yeah, that's right. He was a slightly suspicious swordsman type. Oh, that's him?!

You did see him, you idiot!

So, where did he go?

He told me he wanted to see Arlong, so I gave him a ride to Cocoyashi Village.

Excellent! That means we don't have any need to hurry. He's going to come straight to me.

Sorry, Arlong. But if I had known you were going to be back so soon, I would have kept him here for you. But he said he was a guest and I thought I should get him to the village as fast as I could.

Zoro, huh? Which means if I could buy just a little more time...

Why are you keep getting in the way?! Everything's so close to working out! So close!

Damn you, Nami! You wanna fight, don't ya?

This is your fault, Usopp! You're the one getting in the way. This is what you get for messing with Arlong.

Nami! You really disappointed me! Even after you stole our ship and ran off, Luffy had complete faith in you. He trust you completely and you haven't even shown an ounce of guilt! How can you betray someone like that?! Are you really that cold-hearted?!

The only thing I trust is money! Those dumb enough to be fooled deserve it.

How can you say that?!

You idiots! It was going according to plan. I'm not about to let you and your friends ruin eight long years of hard work. So long, Usopp. It's just business. You understand.

Well, I'll be damned. Looks like you became a pirate while you were gone.

So long?! What?! Like you're gonna kill me?

That's right. I wouldn't underestimate me.

Oh, crap! If I stay here, I'm a deadman. Special Attack! Smoke Star!
Now is my chance!

This is just like something you'd think up.

Nami! Don't do this.

It's for my business. This was my only choice.

Nami! How could you?!...

Now go and die!

[???]

I can't believe it! Big Sis Nami killed Big Bro Usopp!

Your wish came true. You died at sea.

Nami, I'm sorry for doubting you. Without question, you're our friend.

Friend, huh? There's only one reason I joined this crew. And that's to buy Cocoyashi Village from you. You got that? just business, not friends. Keep your end of the deal and I'll have those Berries soon.

Yes, of course. I'd rather cut my stomach open and die than break a promise concerning money. That's the kind of man I am.

Glad to hear it, Arlong. You know the score.

She gives me the creeps.

What a great woman she's become!

He's dead! She killed him! That witch killed him!

There it is! Arlong Park!
Hey! Keep up the pace, cow!

I feel sorry for it. Sanji's kicks must've really taken their toll!

Not that way! Go to your other left! To the building, stupid!

It's strange. I've made it. All this way. I've endured eight whole years since that day...

Alright, As of today, this will be your room. Your desk, your pens... Everything you'll need is in here.

Eight years I persevered. I had no choice but to endure it.

Yeah!
It's almost like we're flying!

Almost?!

We are flying, you moron!

No! We're falling!

Landing succesful!
Hey, Zoro!
Awesome! We're here, guys!

What the hell... What are you doing?!

What do you mean? We're here to pick up Nami. [Duh!] How come you haven't found her yet? Oh, yeah! What about Usopp and Johnny?

Usopp! Oh, no! Come on! We gotta hurry!

Why? What's wrong?

That dumbass has been caught by Arlong! We gotta hurry before they kill him!

He's already dead!

What?!

We're too late. Big Bro Usopp is dead. Nami murdered him!

Am I a ghost?!



Nami would never kill Usopp! We're friends!
Who are friends?
Nami! It's me! Do you remember?!
Why are you here?!
To get you!
Hey! Where's Usopp?
Bottom of the ocean.
Damn it! Cut the crap!
Shut up and leave, outsiders! You're an eyesore!

On the next One Piece
"Everyone's Gathered!
Usopp Speaks the Truth About Nami!"

I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
