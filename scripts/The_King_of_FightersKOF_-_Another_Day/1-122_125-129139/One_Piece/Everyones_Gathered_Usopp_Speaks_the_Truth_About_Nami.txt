  Hey, Zoro!

What... What are you doing?!

What do you mean? We're here to pick up Nami. [Duh!] Oh yeah! What about Usopp and Johnny?

Usopp... Oh, no! Come on! We got to hurrry!

Why? What's wrong?

That dumbass has been caught by Arlong! We gotta hurry before they kill him!

He's already dead!

What?!

We're too late! Big Bro Usopp is dead! Nami murdered him!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:0:&lt;h1&gt; 

You can't be serious!

Yeah, it's true. She was a traitor all along. She's been winning Arlong's favor so she could have the treasure buried in Cocoyashi Village all to herself!. That woman is just a cold-blooded killer. She won't stop until she gets what she wants. Nami had us fooled the entire--

Quiet! Say another word and you'll regret it!

[Easy/Ease it], Luffy. This has nothing to do with Johnny.

Go on. Believe whatever you want. But I know what I saw. Nami killed Big Bro Usopp!

Shut your mouth! Never, even in a million years, would Nami kill Usopp! She wouldn't do that to our friends!

But... But I saw it!

What was that about friends, Luffy?

Nami!

What are you doing here?

What are we doing here?! You're our friend! We came to get you.

What a pest!

Nami?

Friends, huh? Don't make me laugh. You're just pathetic enough to deserve each other.

Damn you! You killed him! I watched you do it! And now Big Bro Usopp is gone!

Yep, that's right. So why don't you kill me and get your revenge?

What?

Word to the wise, fellas: because of your friend's stupidity Arlong is preparing to kill Zoro along with his entire crew. And I don't care how monstrously strong you guys think you are, you're no match for the real monsters. I promise you, you stay on this island, you will die. So, you have a choice to make between life and death.

Her heartless face is so hot!
Hi, Nami! It's me, Sanji! Let's run away together!

Can it, Romeo! This isn't a time or place for that!

Excuse me! Love is like a hurricane! So back off! Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you!

Nami, where's Usopp?

With the fishes.

Damn it! Cut the crap!

How sad. A swordsman striking a lady.

Idiot! Can't you see what's happening here? You're starting to piss me off!

If someone had stopped me that easily I'd be mad, too.

What?! You should watch your mouth!

I'll say whatever I want, bastard!

Big Bros! We're all in this together, okay? This is no time to fight!

Your pal's right. Now quit your bickering and leave while you still can. You outsides have no right to butt into this island affairs! Don't you get it yet? The only reason I got close to you idiots was that I could rob you of everything you had. But now that you're broke, it looks like the dream's dead. So go take your ship! Go on! Find a navigator dumb enough to join you and go to the Grand Line. Continue on your quest to find the One Pice or whatever. Just leave here! You're an eyesore! Goodbye now.

Nami...

Big Bro Luffy!

Sleepy.

Sleep?! At a time like this?! In the middle of the road?!

Well, I'm pretty tired. I'm not gonna butt in on their affairs. I'm not intrested. But I'm not leaving either. Good night.

Huh?! Big Bro?!...

Fine. Whatever! Just go ahead and die!

Na--

Come on! Hurry up!

What's the deal?

The marines are here! We're saved! Some survivors from Gosa managed to contact the government and they told them what happened! Now the marines are here to rescue us all! See?! Finally! It's over! Now we get to leave this horrible place!

So this is the infamous Arlong park. What is the world coming to when pirate scum can set up such an [???] base?! Listen up, men! Our noble mission today is [work of] extraction. We must rescue the survivors of the town of Gosa which was savagely destroyed by the Arlong Pirates! But I am left to wonder... Would our brand of swift and terrible justice allow us to simply overlook [the deck] and the fortress of these unchecked brutes?!

Sir, no, sir!

Correct! Our unit must annihilate Arlong and his men! Prepare for battle at once!

Yes, sir!

Is that right? Marine Branch 77?

That's right. It's what I said.

A newcomer. We'll have someone negotiate with the man in charge. If two million isn't enough to keep them from trying anything funny then kill every last one of them.

Oh, no! The marines have opened fire!
Arlong, watch out!
Wow! He crushed a cannonball!
Those jaws are terrifying!

So what now? [??? talks?]

Canceled.

Yeah!
Alright! Let's do it!
[???] It's gonna be a bloodbath!

Choo! Hold on, guys. Not so fast. There's no need to expend so much energy just to take out the trash. Choo!

Just leave it to us!

What foolish humans they are to pick a fight with us in our own waters too!

Those marines don't stand a chance against three of our leaders.
I doubt that ship will make it a full three minutes.

That's odd...

Commodore, seems that cannonball was a dud.

Fire another. This is a signal of open hostility! Never drop your guard when you're dealing with fishmen.

Sir!

Man down! It's one of them! Attack!

Stand down! Right now!

Huh?!

One of Arlong's men, yes? I am Commodore Purinpurin of Marine's Branch number 77. Allow me to elaborate. You see, we are a somewhat well-known elite marine unit. Do you understand what I'm telling you, fishman? If you wish to live surrender immediately--

Commodore!
What have you done to him?!
You killed him!
What's all this shaking?!
Don't tell me there are fishmen under the ship!

I really am [???] inconvenience you like this, but we just took the liberty [of] removing your rudder. Is that okay?

Ah, you what--?!

Commodore!

Choo! Don't worry, I didn't hit any of his vital organs.
Commodore, I have a question. It's just hypothetical, of course. If one were to move a large reef directly into a strong current, what do you suppose would happen to the ocean?

What?!
No! Moving a whole reef?! That can't be [done]! It's just not possible.

Put it down over there, Hachi!

[Right!]

Commodore! A giant whirlpool has just appeared!
The rudder isn't working!

What?!

I told you. We removed the rudder. So now this rudderless ship [is headed] straight, choo, to the sea floor.

They're dead...

That's right and so as hope. Time to face the truth. There's no way to escape Arlong's control.

I'll bet you're tired.

No. I didn't even break a sweat. We know everything these waters, from the winds to the depths. It was quite easy.

With our expert knowledge of these waters no one can beat us!

True, but let's not forget Nami's charts.

I checked those before I moved the reef. It even tells the flow of the current and everything.

Indeed. They are excellent charts. If we could persuade Nami to do this for all the world's oceans we would be the undisputed rulers of the sea forever!

I know. Nami's brilliant. [Back] she could be critical on the creation of the Arlong Empire. It's just a shame.

A shame?

He promised to let Nami and Cocoyashi Village go [???] she saves up a hundred million Berries.

Arlong! Seriously?! Whatever you do you can't let her leave! You can't! [???], boss!

I have to! That's what we agreed upon eight years ago. I'm the kind of [men] who always keeps my promises when it comes to money. Always.

Hey, Big Bro Zoro! What on earth are you thinking?! Come on! Did you forget that Arlong is out to kill us. We should be running away!

Now that we know what [Nami's really like], there isn't a single good reason why we should stay on this island!

My reason for staying here is there. I'm staying cause he's staying.

Don't be stupid, Big Bro Zoro. Are you saying you want to bring her back, too?

What I want has nothing to do with this. I don't decide who [the] navigator is. He does.

Big Bro...

Right. Understood. You're not leaving. Sorry [to cut our reunion short[, but I won't stay. My role as guide ends here.

Yeah! I'm with him! I don't wanna deliberately get myself killed!

Fine. I'll see you around.

Until we meet again, Big Bro!

Take care, you guys!

You, too!

Hey!

Hmm?!

Well, what do you think it is? Why was she crying?

I don't know. Was she crying?

She was in her heart.

If they were, they were tears of guilt for killing Usopp.

Yeah, right. Are you serious? You really are dense. Do you still honestly believe that Nami could have killed Usopp?

When she did that!...

It's for my business. This was my only choice.

When she did that, Nami stabbed her own hand to make it look like she stabbed me! I can't believe she did that for me! But it's a good thing she did! Otherwise, I'd be fish food right now for sure! What will I do?! A manly man like me can't just turn tail and run after being saved! [One step at a time!] Right now I gotta hurry and find Zoro! Huh?! Is that him up ahead?! It is! It's Zoro!

So Nami didn't kill him? Is that what you're saying?

Am I wrong?

Well, who knows? I always thought of her as kind of a small time crook who [couldn't] even watch a guy die [or, let alone, kill him], but maybe she just snapped?

Wait! What'd you say?!

Hm?!

She's not small time!

[Is] she all you think about?!

He's alive!

Well, he was... I hope he still is.

Usopp! Did Nami do all this [to] you?!

Sorry. Zoro and I did that.

No, you did!

Luffy! [You're] here now?

Yep. Sure I am.

I'm here, too. Hi there.

One of these days I'll kill you!

Ow, [you just made a full recovery!]

Shut up!

Ow, and by the way, we kinda heard you were dead. Killed by Nami.

Stupid Johnny! He was spouting nonsense that entire time!

Well... In a way...It is the truth. But I'm alive because, you see, she actually saved my life.

Jeez, Nami. You sure know how to trash a place. Hey? What's wrong?

Nothing. I'm just resting a little. That's all.

You mean to tell me that poring over a treasure map after racking a house is how you relax? [You're] not fooling me. Now fess up already! What's bothering you?

Something happened to make me mad. That's nothing.

Those guys... Who are they?

You know?!

Yeah. I met some captain guy. He seemed kind of liar-ish, though. Nami, I heard that you smiled with them. We both know that's rare for you. As a matter of fact, I haven't seen [you smile] in years. Come on, tell me who these guys are! It's okay. You can tell me anything, remember?

I'd planned to forget about them. I thought I could just erase them from my mind.

And I'm out!

Oh, man! You gotta be kidding! How'd you win again?
Luffy, how come you have so many cards in your hand?

I don't know. Seems like more is better.

Idiot! Learn the rules like everybody else!

Alright. Here's the rules: the one with the most wins!

But the more I tried to erase them, the more I rememberd.

Holy crap! We sprung a leak!

Hurry up and fix it!

Leave it to me, guys!

[??? stop ??? around!]
Stop [???]!

The truth is, when I was with them the only thing I forgot about was the pain that I bear.

Don't you have any honor?! Those men are your friends!

If it were possible, I'd join up with those guys and sail around the world.

Now I see. Yeah, that would hit her hard. To think that someone actually showed up for her. Friends... That word means pain. It breaks her heart.

So that's it. That's how Nami pretended to kill me and [make] sure I could escape from Arlong Park. Looks to me like she's got some sort of hidden motive for hanging out with a bunch of renegade fishmen.

Obviously.

Fine. What next? We're gonna destroy Arlong Park?

Whoa! Hang on just a second! Don't you think we'd better find out what's going on with Nami first?!

It's no use, either way. No matter what you guys do, Arlong's rule won't come to an end.

Nojiko!

Who's she?

Nami's big sister.

What?! Nami's sister?! No wonder she's so hot!

What do you mean that it's no use?

Just trust me. Don't get [youself's] involved with what's going on here. And leave poor Nami alone. I'll explain the situation.

Situation?

Do you mean you can tell us why shy joined up with Arlong's group?

Yeah. And if that doesn't get you to leave, I don't know what will.

Okay. So tell us all about it. I gotta admit, I'm curious.

I'll pass.

Hey, wait!

I don't care about her past.

Where are you going, Luffy?

For a walk.

A walk?! Do you mean you're not gonna listen to this?

Nope.

Who's he?

Don't mind him. That's just how he is. We'll hear you out. Though, I can tell you right now I don't think it's gonna change anything.

Well, I listen, too. It might help me [make] some sense [out of] everything what is going on around here.

Me, too! I wanna know all about her!

Now he is asleep.

Hey! You said you'd hear her out!

Hmm, I see. This is why it was hard for her.

Look! There's a marine ship [at] the shore!

It's Branch 16's ship! Maybe, Headquarters has finally taken action after what happened to Branch 77?!

I'm Colonel Nezumi of Branch 16! Now then, Genzo, please, step up. And make it snappy!

Yes, Colonel. I'm the one you're looking for.

You, huh? Take me to Nami's house at once!

Nami?! But why?! I don't understand what's going on, Colonel!

Lead the way1 That is all you need to do.

From the beginning then... It all goes back to eight years ago. Up until that day when we were still little children. She lived here in the village. Nami and I will never forget her as long as we live. Her nami is Bellamere.

-- Ending--

Bellemere! What a beautiful girl's name! How I'd love to meet her!
Hey, are Bellemere is yummy or what?
It's not food! It's the person Nami will never forget! Meaning she could be Nami's--
Shut up! I can't sleep!
Are you guys even serious about listening to Nojiko?

On the next One Piece:

"Untold Past!
Female Warrior Bellemere!"

I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
