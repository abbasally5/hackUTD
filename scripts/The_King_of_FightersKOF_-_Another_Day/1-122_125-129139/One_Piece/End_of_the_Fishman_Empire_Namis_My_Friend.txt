  Do you see the intensity in his eyes?

You wretched human!
What have you done to me?!
I'm a mighty fishman!

The Saw Blade!

That's the room wh...

There's nowhere else to run.
You and me, here, in the highest level of Arlong Park.

What is this room?
Lot of paper...

This isn't just any room - this is the room where I've made Nami draw all of her sea charts for me.

The Map Room.

This is Nami's room?

These sea charts are what she's worked on all these years. She's absolutely brilliant. The accuracy of her charts is beyond comparison. She's too good for human trash like you. Her talent should be used solely for building up the mighty Arlong empire. Now listen - Nami belongs to me.

Is that so?

And you're interfering in our business. You human scum, she's not your friend.

I don't care!
I don't care what you say!
Because Nami is our navigator!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:0:&lt;h1&gt; 

Really? You want her to navigate your pathetic little schooner for you? Ha! I guess you truly have no idea what a monumental waste of talent that would be. Look! There is no one else on the face of the planet who controls sea charts with such accuracy and efficiency. That young lady has a gift.
And there really isn't anything as ultimately regrettable as wasting [a] natural talent. Staying here and drawing up sea charts for me is her only chance of living up to her full potential.

This pen is stained with blood...

In order for me to attain world supremacy, her sea charts are absolutely vital. She will continue drawing her sea chards for my own ambitions. And when her charts give me full knowledge of all the world's oceans, we fishmen will be totally invincible and the world shall kneel before us!
The first step is this island. Then we'll move on to the whole East Blue.
You could never use her like me. She would be wasted on you!

What the...?! The Shark [???]...! It won't [???]!
No!

"Use her"?!

What's happening? Are they still fighting?

What's going on up there?!
Dammit! Big Bro Luffy, are you okay?!

I wish we knew what was going on up there.

Luffy...

You bastard! What do you take her for?!

She's an inferior creature. But she has reason [???]. If all of other human are sewer rats, then she's a feisty little kitten. After all, she is adorable. She has her place and it's here, beside me. Can't you understand that? I can give her everything she needs. And the only thing she has to do is continue drawing those marvelous charts for me. So Nami will forever be my tool. Or no, she'll be my friend.

What is that?!

A desk?

It's a desk!

Phew, it's okay. It was just a desk.

Man, I was scared. I thought that was Big Bro Luffy for sure.

Hold on! I don't want to hear that kind of talk from you!
Have you lost your faith?!

What? No.
You were scared too, Johnny.

Don't be stupid! I just...uh... Well, you know, I thought it was Arlong flying through the air.

What a load of crap! You were scared! Admit it!

Admit what, you jerk?! Admit that I know Arlong's going down?! There's no way that Big Bro Luffy is gonna lose this fight!

Luffy...

What do you think you're doing?!

Whoa! What's going on?! Why is all that stuff being throwing out of there?!

All right! As of today, this will be your room! Your desk, your pens - everything you'll need is in here.

Stop it now!
The charts!
My charts!

[Damn brat], you can't trick me that easily trying to draw up fake charts!
I can't believe you waste your time drawing crap like this in secret. If you ever try to pull a stunt like this again, I'll drag all those villagers in here and make you watch as I crush every single one! Just like with her!

Damn you! [???] Eight years of planning and ambition!

Bellemere... Nojiko...

Wow! This fight is so freaking intense!

Yeah... A fight to the death.

Definitely.

Thank you...

Now you've gone too far!

You keep yammering on about how much better fishmen are, and how much you need those sea charts. I don't understand anything about that stuff. I finally figured out how to save her!
This room [isn't] anything but her jail cell! There's only one way for Nami to escape - I've got to tear this place apart!
Gum-Gum...

You fool! Arlong Park cannot be brought down by some inferior human, especially, not by some rubbery freak like you!

Shark Tooth Drill!

Battle Axe!

Oh no! It looks like Arlong Park is coming down!

It's gonna collapse!

Everybody, run [???]!

Big Sis! We gotta go!

But Luffy's still inside!

Big Sis!

We can't! Luffy's still...
Luffy!

I finally figured out how to save her!
This room [isn't] anything but her jail cell!
There's only one way for Nami to escape - I've got to tear this place apart!

Luffy!
Luffy...

What the hell?! What's that noise?
Luffy...

Arlong Park has fallen...

Big Bro...

I just wonder what went on in there...

We gotta know who won!

With all that debris... looks like...

Luffy...

It's Luffy!

Big Bro!

He's just standing there. What's wrong?!

Nami! Nami, you'll always be my friend!

Yeah.

He really won...?

He won...

He won!

Big Bro won!

Arlong Park has fallen!

Ee-yea!!

Nojiko, is all of this really happening?!
Surely, this is a dream!

Luffy! Luffy! Luffy! Luffy! Luffy! Luffy!

Good job, Luffy! You almost did as good as me! Let's face it - I'm pretty much the star! But I'll cheer for you anyway, because I'm super modest and I don't want to steal you thunder!

[You really had us go in there, Luffy.] Start dealing with the bad guys quicker - I almost had a heart attack. You rubber jerk!

Luffy! Luffy! Luffy! Luffy! Luffy! Luffy!

This is awesome!

Okay! Hold it right there!

Damn! It's him!

What a lucky day today is!
Very nice. I saw the entire fight and I must say good work.
I can only assume that your victory here was some sort of bizarre accident. I never thought that the fishmen would lose to riff-raff like you and your crew. However, now [that] Arlong is out of the picture, I'll be taking all the money I was supposed to give [to] him in addition to all the treasure in Arlong Park. Now drop your weapons! Colonel Nezumi of Branch 16 get all the credit--!

Zoro!

I see you're trying to rain on these people's parade. [Now that's just playing rude.]

What you scum just [???] at least sorry I promise you--

He's still talking?

This is for shooting Nojiko and also for mercilessly destroying Bellemere's tangerine orchard.

Huh?

Colonel!

Thanks, Nami! That felt good!

A thousand more and we'll call it even!

What you're gonna do is clean up after those fishmen. Then you're gonna help to rebuild the town of Gosa. And you won't lay a finger on any of money or valuables in Arlong Park! That's the island's money now! Got it?

Right! Yeah! I'll do [???] what you say!

And there's one more thing.
Give me my money back, jerk!

I promise, I promise - I'll give every [Berry] back!

I'll get you, you pirates!
Luffy is your captain, right?!
Well, mark my [?freaking?] words, rubber man - major things are gonna happen 'cause you made me angry! I swear you'll regret this! I'll get my revenge! Just you wait and see!

"Major things are gonna happen"?

Yeah. How does he know I'm gonna be King of the Pirates?

That's not what he means at all! Are you really that dumb?!

Hold on! What next?! Are we in super big trouble or what?!
Hey?! Hey?! What do we do?!

Hey, everyone! Now's not the time to keep this to ourselves! We need to tell everyone on the island what happened here today!

Arlong Park has fallen!

Hey, Zoro! What's that on your chest?

[Huh?]

[?Made you look--?]

[?all on it?]

Good job, Nami.

To think our island would be saved by unruly pirates...
The world is strange...

Greetings and salutations, you pathetic little humans!
From this moment on, this entire island and its inhabitants are a part of my domain!

Genzo, help me!

I won't let you take her!

But that's an Arlong tattoo!

Uh! Not you...

You can stop... You carried our lives on your shoulders for so long... And you fought your heart out.

Genzo...

And then the thing just kind of [is] blowing everywhere!

It's so cool and things go boom!

Now it's done.
The spirit of Bellemere can finally be at peace.

Hello? Hello?!

Yes. This is Navy Headquarters.

Headquarters?! Right! Good! Hello! This is Colonel Nezumi of Marine Branch 16! Marine Code 00733! I have a request!

There really is no reason to shout. I can hear you--

Listen! There's a pirate who wears a straw hat! He's named Luffy!

"Listen! There's a pirate who wears a straw hat! He's named Luffy!"

I hereby declare that he and his four crew members are enemies of the government!

"I hereby declare that he and his four crew members are enemies of the government!"

"Luffy..." All right.

They managed to take down the purportedly invincible fishman Arlong and his home base! Based on the grave threat they present, a large bounty has been placed on their captain, Straw Hat Luffy! Transmitting photograph now!

Roger that.
Huh?

Couldn't you have taken a better picture than that?!

No. Sorry, sir.

Okay. Right after a quick verification, I'll send it in for approval, sir.

Good! Don't forget - he's a wanted pirate! "Dead or Alive"!
I want his face on posters all over the world!


It's finally goodbye to Cocoyashi Village!

Nami, bet you're happy to be onboard with the Great Captain Usopp again!

You idiot! Nami's joining me on a journey of love!

No way! Raw [hamming] melon!

Bellemere! It took eight years, but we're finally free!

On the next One Piece
"Setting Out with a Smile! Farewell, Hometown Cocoyashi Village!"

I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
