  Huh?
What do you think you're doing?!
Stop it now!
The charts!
My charts!

I've got to tear this place apart!
Gum-Gum... Battle Axe!

Nami! Nami, you'll always be my friend!

Yeah.

Arlong Park [is] gone!

We're free!

Defeated! We defeated Arlong!
It's over!

We're free again! It's been a long-time coming, but now our hardships are over!
No work for three days! We're going to party until we can't stand up!

Nojiko!

Hey you!

Have you seen Arlong Park, Nojiko?! It's totally smashed to pieces!

I know! It's great!

I have to meet the guy who did that! He must be totally awesome! I heard he's still here in our village! Do you know where I could find him?!

He's right over there.

Yeah?! Which one is he?!

The guy with the straw hat.

Are you sure it's him? He's kinda goofy.

I know it's hard to believe but...

He's still at it.

Well, you saw the way he looked after that fight.

Yeah. Anyone elser would've been dead.

You dumb-ass! Did you think this would heal on its own?
Seriously, pirates are supposed to be smarter than this.
Don't you have a ship's doctor?

Doctor? Never thought of that. Good idea!

Luffy...

But we need to get a musician first, right?

Why's that?

Because pirates really like to sing.

That's true, but why's that first?

Hey, doctor, where's Nami?

Hm?

I haven't seen her around.

Well then... If she's not in the village, there's only one place she'd go.

Why are you still here, Nami?
Your friends have been looking for you.

Hey, Nojiko!

Huh?

Genzo!

Huh?

If Bellemere were still alive and I wanted to become a pirate, do you think she'd let me do it?

A pirate?! What do you think?! Of course she'd never let her precious daughter go out to sea with a bunch of traitorous pirates!

Yeah. She'd let you.

Nojiko!

But if she had said no, that wouldn't stop you, would it?

That's right! No!

I see...

What's up, Genzo?

You certainly are Bellemere's kids.

Oh yeah?

Nami, you've already made up your mind about this. [There's/it's] no use fighting it. Live your life - it's what Bellemere would've wanted.

Boy, I'm stuffed!
It's nice to not have to cook for a change.
So how are you feeling, Zoro?

I'll be okay. I think all I need it's a little bit of rest.

That's good.

Seriously, how much longer can they keep this up? It's been three days now.

Nothing wrong with that. Smoke them if you got them!

Hey, Sanji! Where'd you [?got?] that melon you had?! I want to give it a shot!

It isn't polite to talk with your mouth full.

I don't know. It was raw ham melon with raw ham on [top].

Raw ham melon?!

Tell me where you found this!

I can't. The whole town is basically one giant buffet. Good luck finding it.

Hm. He ran off.

Three days [as] stuffing his face...
Now that my belly is full, time to dance.
Yoo-hoo, ladies!

I am Captain Usopp! I destroyed the strongest of all the fishmen!

Way to go, kid!

Can I have your autograph?!

Let's sing about me! Let's sing!
I am the greatest, my friends
[???]

Oh, I'm so bored.

Huh?

I thought you'd be more upset.
"Why didn't this happen before my daddy died? Why is life so unfair?"
That.

I was kinda upset at first. But I decided just to think about my future.

What about it?

We were saved by the straw hat guy and his friends. But tomorrow we have to start all over again on our own, without anybody's help. We can't forget the past, but now it's really up to us what happens. There's no one to blame our problems on anymore. We can succeed or fail. It all depends on our choices. Whining about the past get us nowhere. I decided to think that way.

[That so?]

Stop! Ow! Ow! Let go! Stop! That hurts! Ow! Stop!

It's no fun if I can't harass you for being a baby.

So you decided to hurt me instead, you stupid old punk?!

Punk! That's right!

Can you get rid of it?

I'll do my best. But you do realize this is a tattoo? [That's] bound to be some scar and leftover when I'm done.

Hm. I was stupid. I knew it wouldn't come off.

I don't want anyone to see this! This awful tattoo... I'm just pretending but it's like he owns me now...

Nami...

Nojilo! What is that?!

Oh? You mean this?

It's nothing. Just a tattoo.
Now I look just like you!

hey, doc!

Hm?

I think I'd like a new tattoo.

Hm?!

Like this.

Look at those two dance!

[???]

Bellemere, your daughters are strong young women now. You'd be so proud... It's like I'm standing right in front of you again...

What?! You're joining the Marines?!

Don't bother trying to stop me. My mind's made up.

We're not going to waste a single moment now. So much has been lost. Everyone has had to make terrible sacrifices. Which is why I don't care if I look like a fool. I'm happy for the first time in a long while.

Raw ham melon!
Huh? There's no food up here. [???] I'll go back.

Be quiet!

A grave? Did somebody die?

Yes. A long time ago.

Oh, I'm sorry.
I give you [to] my conveniences.
Wait. My sincere [compliments].
No. My darkest concussions.

My deepest condolences.

Thanks!

Listen, boy. I know Nami's going away with you. She has her mind set on becoming a pirate and that's a dangerous business. And I'm fine with that. It can't be helped. But if any of you ever do anything to hurt her, I will kill you.

We're not gonna hurt her!

You sure?!

I'm sure.

Join me [in] [?arousing ???] of Captain Usopp Song #3[???]!
A-la-la-la Captain Usopp is the best!
He's a great--

Wow! What's up with all the food?!

Do you two know what today is?

Huh?

It's the anniversary of the day we met!
We're celebrating the day you became my daughters!

Hey, don't cry. It's just a storm, so what if it ruins our crops? You need to learn to be strong, girls, who can smile even during hard times. Do that and nothing will ever stop you.

Huh?

Now show me those smiles!

Nami! Would you go get the salt?

I see you can draw land maps now as well as sea charts.

I [wanted] the book to study navigation.

Navigation as well?

You're gonna be a navigator!

That's right! I'm gonna guide ships around all the oceans of the world! It'll be great! And I'll be able to make maps of all the far-off places I'll go!

So, this island map is the first step toward realizing your dream, is that it?

Yeah!

Well, Bellemere. We finally made it. It took eight long years, but we're finally free! The village and me... It's just like you told us when we were children, "Be brave and smile, and nothing will be able to stop you!" It's so true. Arlong's gone and now everybody is so happy to be free. And me! I'm finally gonna leave this island! But don't worry - I'll be okay. I'm going with good srtong people, like you. And this last map is all that I have left to remind me... but none of that really matters anymore, right? 'Cause now I'll start again. And every map I draw will be for me and nobody else! Oh, you see, this time when I see the world it'll be with all of my friends! You know that's what I always wanted! Anyway, I'm just trying to say goodbye, 'cause I don't know if I'll be back... I'm going now... Okay...?

This the last one, right?

Yeah!

We got everything?

Yep!

All right! We stocked up with everything we need! I think we're good to go!

You know we've only been on this little island for a few days, but it feels more like a life-time!

Yeah!

We can't thank you enough for everything you've done for us. But we gotta go back to our regular job as bounty hunters!

So this is goodbye. I hope we get to meet again someday!

See you around.

Goodbye!

Yeah! Now it's time for us to get going!

But we can't leave yet! We gotta wait for Nami!

Well, maybe she's not coming?

What?! Why not?! If you try to hit on her again, I swear I'll break your freaking neck! You got it?!

Why would I do something like that?

'Cause you're a stinking lowlife! And it makes you happy to destroy true love! [???]

You're trying too hard.

What'd you say?!

She might not even be coming. After all, she has achieved her goal. Nami doesn't have to be a pirate anymore. She might be better off if she stayed here on this island with all her friends and family.

What about me?! Dammit!
Without Nami onboard I have like 98.72% less reason to stay with you people on this stupid pirate ship!

Hey, I'm so upset with you about the raw ham melon!

Why isn't Nami here?

Don't know. I haven't seen her anywhere since this morning.

What?! One hundred million Berries?! She left all of the money?!

She left all of it in our house with a letter.

She's not even gonna take some of it?! But she worked so hard to get it!

She'll steal more. That's what her letter said. There's no changing her mind once it's made up.

That girl... She didn't even give us a chance to thank her.

Ohh! There she is!

Nami!
Nami!
Nami!

Set the sails!

Hm?

I don't get it - why's she running?

She said to set sail.

What?

No! She's planning on leaving us without letting any of us thank her or say goodbye!

Hey, wait!

Set sail!

Wait! Don't go!
They're leaving!

Stop! At least let us say goodbye!

Nami! No! Let us thank you!

Nami! Come back here! You can't leave this way!

So, you sure you wanna let her leave like this?

Not my decision. She does what she wants.

Nami!

Why?!

Huh? No way!

Where is my money?!
My wallet's gone!
Mine, too!
She stole my money!
My purse's gone!

Thank a bunch!

Damn! You little brat!

Great! She hasn't changed a bit!

I'd watch my back!

You lousy pickpocket! We'll miss you!

Boy! Remember what I told you!

You got it!

Goodbye, everybody! I'll miss you! Take care!

I can't believe her! My little sister got us good with that one!
Be safe, Nami.

Take a look at this.

What is it, doc? Nami's bill?

Not exactly. That girl will never change. That's her new tattoo.

What's it supposed to be?

A tangerine and a pinwheel.

Hey, Genzo, where's your pinwheel?

I don't need it anymore.

I'm off!

Genzo, back off! Don't get so closed to Nami!

I just wanted to see her smile!

Your face is too scary! It's making her cry!

I can't change my face!
Oh, wait! I'll keep this on my hat to distract her!
What do you think, little girl?

You're joking, right? It's just a stupid pinwheel! There's no way it's gonna make her--
I can't believe it - she's laughing!


Oh no!

What's the matter?!

The newspaper's gone up in price!

What kind of problem is that?!

Then don't buy it!

What do you mean? We have to know what's going on in the world! Plus, we can use the back of the flyers to [draw on]!

Good thinking!

See, like this!

What?!
This is--!

On the next One Piece
"Bounty! Straw Hat Luffy Becomes Known to the World!"

I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
