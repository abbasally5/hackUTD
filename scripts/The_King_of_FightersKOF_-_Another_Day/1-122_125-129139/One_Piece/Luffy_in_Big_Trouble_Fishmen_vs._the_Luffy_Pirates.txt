 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:0:&lt;h1&gt; 

Huh?!
What the...?

Now, which one of you is Arlong?

Arlong? Well, that just happens to be my name.

Good. You can call me Luffy.

Luffy? What are you supposed to be?

A pirate!

Huh? Hey! That guy! Wait a sec! I remember him! He's the guy who likes going on walks!

Hold it right there!
Where do you think you're going?!
You wanna talk to the boss? Well, you gotta talk to us first. Get it? So let's talk.
That's far enough!

Move it!

So, what does a pirate want with me?
Who the hell are you?

Luffy... Help me.

That's for making our navigator cry!

[???]

Back off! You're out of your league!

Jeez! You just had to run on ahead by yourself!

Don't worry. I can handle these bozos on my own.

Ah, you fool! I never said anything about being worried! I just don't want you hogging all the action!

Oh!

Well, I just wanna let you guys know that I don't mind if you hog it all.

I see you're raring to go as usual!

Ah! it's him! That's the unknown swordsman I was telling you about!

Roronoa Zoro.

I thought so. That bastard tricked me! i can't believe it! [I felt for it ???looks either any anchor!???] Wait! Hook, line and sinker!

Hey, look! Long-nose is here!

Ah?! But he's dead! We saw Nami kill him!

Oh, he's alive. Which means...

...that Nami was a traitor all along! just as I suspected!

Who-who are those guys?

Hold it!

That guy just [???] Arlong!
Unbelievable!

No human should be able to do that!

Are they...

Didn't we tell you? just stay back here.

Now do you understand why we're keeping you away from that fight? You guys will just get in their way.

But why? What's that I don't understand. What reason could they possibly have to fight?

Reason?! Big Sis Nami was crying!

Do they need any more reason than that to put their lives on the line?

A pirate? Of course. This is all starting to make sense now. You've been after Nami this whole time. But the girl is mine and I'm not giving her up!

A bunch of idiots like you won't worth Arlong's time! We know how to deal with you!

Not that!

Oh, no! It's here!

What is going on here, guys?!

Every single one of you is about to become fish food!
Momoo! Rise!

It's a monster! That's the beast from the Grand Line that destroyed the town of Gosa!

It's actually real! Oh, no!
It's Momoo!
What are we gonna do?!

Well, look who's back!

Seems he's a friend of the fishmen!

Hey! Stop! Where are you going?! Get back here, Momoo! You can't just leave! Momoo!

Leaving? Now, now! Isn't that a shame? But I suppose if you really want to run away, then who am I to stop you? Well then...

It's coming right for us!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

You're all mine, you damn cow!

Looks like he's got a plan, for once...

We'll see. I've got a bad feeling about this.

His arms stretched!

So he must have Devil Fruit powers?!

Powers?!
Ah, who cares!
Attack!

Hey! Let's get out of here!

Whoa! Wait! What's he gonna do?!

I'm not sure if I wanna find [it] out!

Time for something [new]!
Gum Gum Pinwheel!

All right! That's it, Arlong! I've done playing games with you! I didn't come here to beat down all you cronies! I came here to teach you a lesson! So step up!

Oh, I will. Don't worry. Actually I was just thinking about how painfully I'll end your life.

That was the worst plan ever!

Yeah! Were you trying to kill all of us, too?!

Ah-oh!

That boy's incredible!

I just can't believe there's a human who can throw that giant monster!

It is if the Gods themselves are fighting...

What are you doing?! Are you ruining something else?!

How dare you hurt our [brother]?!

Very well. It seems that we must now join in the fight.

Now you'll get an education in the inferiority of your species. Choo!

Oh, really? I'd like to see that.

Relax, sir! Let us handle this!

If you go on one of your rampages to squash these insects, you could destroy all of Arlong Park. Choo.

Please, just let us kill these weaklings!

All right. They're yours.

Uh, guys! There's something I should tell you.

What the hell is that octopus doing?

Octopus is best when it's cut thin and salted. Add some olive oil and paprika, and it makes a perfect snack while drinking.

So, listen to me, guys. I'm kinda in trouble.

Take this! Zero vision! Hachi Ink Jet!

Idiot! How come you didn't dodge that?!

I can't see squat!

Now to finish you off!

Come on! Get out of there, Luffy! Run!

Yeah, that's the problem. I can't run. I can't even walk! My feet are kinda stuck!

But you're the one who stuck them into the ground in the first place!

[Always thinking ahead.]

One Hachi Ink Jet served on the rocks!

You're such a pain!

Sanji, that was so totally awesomely awesome!

Looks like I ended up picking one hell of an idiot to be my captain.

We all did.

Luffy's great! Hey!

But the truth is that our idiot captain is far better than a gang who'd prey on a lady!

A lady, huh? You rushed into certain death for one lousy girl? I think that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard!

Lousy girl? If you insult Nami one more time, I can promise that you'll go from fishman to fish sticks! Got that?

Your skills are quite exceptional for a human, but I must admit that chivalry from a pirate seems just a little fake.

I'm damn good at what I do. And I guarantee you there's nothing fake about my desire to help a beautiful lady in need.

Looks like I'll be acquainting you with the true superiority of the fishman species.

Nice work, but they're still stuck.

Still?! They're still stuck?!

Ah, we could pull all day, and I bet my legs would still be stuck in there.

Hey! Are you trying at all?! Or do you wanna stay [stuck here]?!

Maybe no one told you that the penalty for playing around in Arlong Park is death!

Come on! Get unstuck already! Get unstuck! Please! Luffy, come on!

Come here!

Hey, octopus! They're a little bit busy at the moment. Why don't you take me on?

Oh! You're Zoro! I forgot! You can't get away with tricking me! And how dare you mercilessly slaughtered so many of my brothers?!

That stuff's old news, octopus man. I personally don't care what reasons you have for wanting to kill me. The situation has changed! You see, the tables have turned! You're not the hunters anymore. Understand? Now it's you, fish freaks, who are being hunted!

Yeah! You tell him, Zoro! That octopus guy is yours! Nice!
Ah! Luffy!

Hey! I'm back!

Oh, you're dead.

Oh, crap...

I get it now. You must actually want me to kill you.

Hold on. Wasn't that the guy who saved Genzo's life earlier?

Hey, wait. You're the people from Cocoyashi. Judging from the fact you all have weapons, I can only assume that this is a rebellion. Then you'll all have--

Exploding Star!

Big Bro Usopp!

Did you think it would be easy?! You're dealing with me now!

Enough! I'm going to get rid of you right now!

Who is that lad?

Brave one minute and cowardly the next. He is a baffling man.

Get back here, Long-nose!

[Oh, you want it talked, big mouth?!]

Why are these people pirates?!

You morons [???] a pathetic sight to behold. I'm sick of watching this. Now get out of my way!

But, sir! There is no reason to go on a rampage! Think of Arlong Park!

Don't worry, I won't. I just thought of a fun game. That's all.

Game, huh?

Now you're going down!

Do you honestly think your sad little group can defeat us?

So what if we do?

Yeah! So what if we do, huh? Now, let go!

You got something to say to us?

No way! No way! No way!

Did you know that whose with Devil Fruit powers can't swim? But honestly anybody in this situation would sink right to the bottom!

The sea?! No!

Gum-Gum Pistol!
Ouch-ee!

You fool!

How pointless.

Luffy!

Damn you!

Wait! Don't be stupid! Those fishmen can't wait for us to jump into water after him! They'd have an obvious advantage in an underwater fight! There's only one way to save Luffy! We've gotta take these guys down at the same time, then go into water! There's no time! Come on! Let's do it!

Yeah.

So, how long can he hold out? Time is ticking...

Oh, so that's the game?

I get it.

You can take the fish.

You slice and trim the octopus.

Oh, this is bad. I'm almost out of breathe.

What now?! He can't help himself! What do we do?!

Big Bro Luffy is gonna die!

They can't even breathe underwater! Humans are such pitiful creatures, aren't they?!

Hey, calamary! Let's go!

Game! Game!

I'll kick your ass in five seconds flat!

We don't have more than three!

Hey! What's the rush?! You are both running headlong into death! None of you will leave this place alive!

Hachi Ink Jet!

Hang on, Luffy!

Oh, crap! I'm gonna be killed!

--ENDING--

I can't breathe!
You stupid octopus! I don't give a damn about you! I gotta hurry and save Luffy!
Hey! Are those the wounds you got from Hawk-Eye?
Shut up! I can't afford to pass out here!
Wait! Is running all I do?

On the next One Piece

"Luffy Submerged!
Zoro vs. Hatchan the Octopus!"

I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
