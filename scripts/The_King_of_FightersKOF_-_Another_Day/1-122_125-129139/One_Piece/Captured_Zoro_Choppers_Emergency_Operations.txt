  Did you know, there's an awesome treasure hidden at the end of the sea? And anyone who finds it will be King of the Pirates. Is that exiting or what? There are incredible adventures out there just waiting for us.


The Going Merry fell right into the middle of the invincible marine fortress Navarone. But luckily, Luffy and the others managed to escape under cover of night.

Well, look at that! We've landed in another fine mess, haven't we?

Nami successfully disguised herself as a janitor. While Luffy and Sanji infiltrated the kitchen.

So, you're the new chefs?

Murrey?

So, you're here.

However, one of the crew, Zoro, was captured by the marine force.

Welcome to Navarone!

Captured Zoro! Chopper's Emergency Operations!

Hmm... One down, six to go.
The infamous Roronoa Zoro, one of Luffy's Straw Hat Pirates...
Drake, go to the brig and interrogate the prisoner!

But, Commander, my team and I are already under orders from you to surveil and secure the dining hall.

You are?

You told me that pirates are always hungry, so sooner or later they'll show up at the mess hall.

I'll handle the mess hall. Things are bound to be a little screwy around there. Jessica told me they got some new cooks from headquarters.

And how shell I conduct Zoro's interrogation?

I'll leave that up to you.


Oh, come on. Are you guys just gonna sit there and stare at me?
Well, nothing to do but get some more shuteye.

Open the cell!

But Lieutenant Commander, the prisoner is extremely dangerous!

I'm under direct orders from Vice Admiral Jonathan to interrogate the prisoner.

Yes, sir! Please be careful, sir!

Hmm?

Roronoa Zoro... known far and wide as a pirate hunter, until you turned traitor and joined the scum you used to hunt.

You didn't come all the way down here just to tell me that, did you?

If that's how you wanna play it! How many of you are there?! And what exactly is your purpose in invading this fortress?! It was a clever strategy to invade the base like this from the sky! How did you do that?! Did you build a launch pad?!

No. We just came down from the sky.

Don't mock me!

Calm down, big guy. I'm not mocking you. I'm just answering your question.

I won't hear anymore of your lies, pirate!

Like I said we came down from the sky. If you wanna get specific, we've rode down on a floating octopus. Are you happy now?

Well, I guess we'll have to do this [the] hard way! You're gonna be sorry! I'll find out the truth, no matter what!


Your next assignment is to clean the old gym!

Aye-aye, Boss!
Clean all this? And I gotta do it... by myself?

I wanna see it sparkle! Boy, I hate to be in your shoes right now! Hahaha!

This disguise was clearly a mistake.


I heard that they captured one of the Straw Hat Pirates.

What? Then that wasn't a ghost ship?!

No, but this guy is scarier than a ghost. You're not gonna believe this but they caught Roronoa Zoro!

Whoa!

What?!

Apparently, there are other members hiding, too.
Imagine, if we find even one of them, we'd be heroes!

Yeah!

Zoro got captured! What'll I do now?!
Those marines back there didn't mention anyone else being taken prisoner. So the rest of the crew has got to be around here somewhere. But where could they be? This place is huge! I'm so ready to get out of here!

Hey! What's that?!

Ahh!

If I keep that up, I'll be dead before they catch me.

Hold it!

Help me! Help!

I said hold it!

I guess those guys weren't looking for me.
Cleaning sucks. I gotta find a new disguise.
Hmm? Look at that!


Oh, no! It's a dead end!

He went that way!

Ah!

All right, fellas! The corner is raccoon dogged... I mean, the raccoon dog is cornered!

What do I do? What'll I do?!

He disappeared!

A magical disappearing raccoon dog...

Hmm... He didn't disappear.

It'll take forever to find him in here.

Hay!
Shh!

What have we got here?
Yeah! Ready or not!

Huh?!
What's going on?!

Did the raccoon dog leave these antlers behind?

I don't know, but you can't make tasty treats with antlers. Let's go.

We must've lost him in [the] hallways.

Ah, safe at last. Ahh!

So where is the crate?

Should be over here.

Ah! There it is!
Hey, what are they doing with deer antlers?

I think, they're used in medicines.


What happened to them?

They said they ran into a storm. Took a lot of casualties.

Hurry it up! Get them to the infirmary stat!


Let's see...
"Make a vertical incision with a scalpel and if it begins to bleed..."
Blood. Blood. Blood!
It's just my luck that all the other doctors got called away at once.
Oh please, don't let there be any surgery patients today!

Doctor!

Yes?

We brought the crate of deer antlers for the medicine you're going to make.

Of course! Right over there will be fine.

Yes, ma'am!

Where am I?


I look pretty good in this If I do say so myself. And I bet the ward won't be near--
Ugh! I'm so sorry!

What are you apologizing for?! Just get to the infirmary already!

What? Where? Huh?

There's been an emergency! All nurses ought to report immediately!

I knew it! I'm screwed no matter what disguise I pick!

Doctor, we have an emergency!

So, what kind of emergency is this?

Critically injured sailors from the Stan Marey need immediate attention!

Um.. well... I'll leave these patients to you since that isn't my area of expertise.

This isn't really your expertise? Well, last time I checked you're the only doctor on this entire base right now!

But I'm just a pediatrician! I don't know anything about trauma! That's outside of my specialty!

I see. It's a medical room. But I wonder if that doctor can handle those patients.


One, two, three!

Wow, these guys are all in really rough shape. Did they get hit by a cyclone?

Don't just stand there! Treat the wounded!

Right!
I don't have time to be playing nurse with this bunch. I need to be searching for the Going Merry! So I can get us out of this place!
Oh, I'm sorry!

Don't just stand there!
Doctor, what do we do?

Okay... Let's see... Painkiller! He needs 50 mg of painkiller.

Shall we prep the OR?

That's right... Operate... I have to... operate...

Doctor!
Doctor, put yourself together!
We don't have time for this!
Tell us what to do!
Doctor! Doctor, please! You've got to wake up!
[Now], are you okay?
Give us some [men]!

I got to help.
I'll be directing treatment today!

Huh?

First, administer this patient a dose of both phenicol and cardiotonic! Then prepare some tialcillin!
Respond if you understand!

Yes, doctor!

Yes, doctor!

Now cross-match every patient's blood type!
Begin preop treatment for everyone who requires an operation!
[Get] this patient an antibiotic to treat tetanus and any other infections he may have!

Right!

What's the status of the OR?

The operating room is ready, sir!

Then move patients there! Start with those in critical condition!

Yes, sir!

Come on! Snap out of it!

Chopper?!

Nami?!
What in the world are you doing here?

I should be asking you that!

Excuse me, but could you tell me what's going on? Where is everyone? I seem to have fainted. Wait! You are a doctor!
I don't know who you are or where you came from, but I'm glad you came along! You sure saved us with your expert instructions!

No one's saved yet, doctor!

What?

The situation doesn't look good. Without emergency surgery many will die!

Yeah...

There's no time to lose! You must operate on the critically injured now!

Yes... Operate... Ah...

Hey! What's with you?

I... I can't do it...

Do what?

I can't stand to see people in pain or bleeding or worse. Honestly, I can barely even administer a shot! So the thought of putting stitches in or cutting someone is just...

Oh, just perfect! This is a marine base, you know. How can you call yourself a military doctor if you can't stand a sight of a little blood?

My field of practice is children's medicine. All the other doctors were called away on business. You see, I was only left in charge as a temporary substitute.

Temporary?!

Substitute or not, you're in charge of the infirmary right now, aren't you?

Oh, yeah. Seems so.

It seems so?!

Hey, Chopper. Don't you think it's time we get out of here?

Yeah, but...

I found out that it isn't a lake, it's connected to the open ocean. We just have to find the Going Merry and we can escape from this stupid fortress.

I can't go yet.

Huh?!

You're a doctor, it's your duty to preserve live, isn't it?!

That is what I have sworn to do, but still... I have limits! Even the best doctors have things they just can't do!

The man who taught me medicine used to tell me a story.
There once was a man who was told by his doctors that he would soon be dead. In despair he wandered the wilderness in search of a place to die. Then as he watched through a mountain pass, he saw something extraordinary - the entire mountain was covered in brilliant cherry blossoms. After seeing this he went to visit his physicians again, but they were astounded to report that the man was now completely healthy.
You're the only doctor for those patients in there! You alone can save them from a terrible death! A healer must never give up! There's no illness that can be cured! Don't ever let your fear limit you! There's no patient that we doctors shouldn't try to cure! As doctors we have the power to make miracles happen! We have to always believe that!

Then... will I... be able to see the cherry blossoms, too? No! I will show them the cherry blossoms! All of those suffering people in the operating room!

That's a spirit! I'll even stick around to help!

Hey! We don't have time for this!

Yes, that may be true. But my first priority always has to be helping those in need. I'm a doctor, Nami!

If that's your decision, then I'll have to leave you behind! Is that really what you want?

Doctor, the operating room is prepped and ready to go!

Good. I'm on my way.

Cho... I mean yes, doctor!

Right! Let's go!

Hey, Chopper!

You can leave me behind if you need to, but I have to stay. If I didn't, I'd be abandoning everything Doctorine taught me to uphold!

Geez! Well, I'm not just gonna leave you here all by yourself!

Just who in the heck is that guy?

We'll start with the critical cases.

There's a large iron shard lodged in his upper torso that must be extracted.

The patient has been anesthetized, so we are ready to begin a procedure.

Scalpel!

Yes, doctor!

Doctor Kobato, you'll be fine. Remember, you are the only one who can show these patients the cherry blossoms.

Yes!

This incision runs close to an artery, so be careful.

Right.

Nami, suction!

Yes, doctor!

The shard has been removed!

Done!

Doctor Kobato, we're not even close to "done"! There are so many more patients!

Of course.

We can do it.


Yeah.


What?

An unidentified doctor's performing surgery?

Yes, sir!

That could be our second Straw Hat of the day.

Chopper...


Pardon the intrusion!

We're operating. Please leave!

This is urgent! I assure you! I need to ask you a few questions.

Doctor, his blood pressure is dropping fast!

Give him 6 units of saline solution and 1 unit of platelets!

Yes, sir!

He's out of danger now. Continue the blood transfusion and ready the dopamine!

Doctor Kobato!

We're in the middle of an operation. If you're going to stay, please be quiet!

Excuse me, did I hear you right? You're performing surgery. The doctor that nearly faints every time she sees a papercut? There are reports of an unidentified doctor here.

Get out!

Huh?

The only thing you and your folks will find in here are people giving their all to save precious lives. Is that clear?!

Let's go!

Monitor them!

Sir!

Suture completed!

That was the last of our patients.

Good job, Doctor Kobato!

No! Chopper, don't--!

You really are a great doctor!

Thank you. But you are a much better doctor than I'll ever be, Mr. Raccoon Dog.

You stupid face! I'm not a raccoon dog, I'm a reindeer!

It's like she doesn't even notice that Chopper just changed shape!


Really, what are we still doing hanging around here? We don't even know if Robin and Nami are out of harm's way! Ah! But I can't just abandon the task that the lovely Jessica gave me.

Got that right.

What are you doing, you idiot?!

Um...I don't know. Have you seen how awesome this glow thing is?

Yes, I've seen how awesome your thing is! Now help me figure out how to get us out of here!

Oh yeah. How come we're still sitting around this stupid kitchen?

We're still here because you haven't figured out a way for us to escape!

Hey, Sanji?

What now?!

Do you think someone could eat a raw octopus?

What is that have to do with anything?

How's it coming? Are you done yet? If you don't hurry, we won't be ready for the next hundred soldiers.

Oh my sweet Jessica! I just finished the onions!

Well, looks like it's just about break time! I'm beat!

But you haven't done anything yet!

Since you're so eager to help, I've got another 300 onions here for you.

More? You gotta be kidding me!

I'm ever your humbled servant, sweet Jessica!

Hey, I think I know why we stuck in the kitchen! And it's all your fault!


That little game of 20 questions sure hurt, but I'm more worried about the others. Usopp, is our ship okay? Robin, what's with that outfit?! Never mind the Captain and that idiot cook! Looks like the tide is about to turn! On the next One Piece!

Don't steal my line!

On the next One Piece:
"The Marine's Dragnet Closes In!
The Second Member Captured!"

I'm gonna be a great swordsman!

Hey!
