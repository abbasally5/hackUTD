  We will not abandon Bellemere!

Damn it! Why did this happen?!
Hold on, Bellemere!

Perfect! There is nothing as delicious as my sauce! The duck needs about another 10 minutes. But it's close. The stew is almost ready. This is gonna blow my budget, yep, but sometimes you gotta live a little!

Oh, they are here!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:0:&lt;h1&gt; 

It's open! Come in!

Why, thanks!

I guess you weren't expecting a former marine. Now what would a pirate from the Grand Line want with Cocoyashi Village?
What's so funny?!

Useless! Foolish! Stupid! Empty! Worthless! All of you, humans! You have no strength to speak of!

We'll help her escape through the back door!

What if the pirates are already there?!

[We will be okay!]

Stop!

Doctor!

You can't go back home!

What?

But we have to save Bellemere!

Nojiko! Nami! Quiet and listen to me! There will be times, times in life like this moment now, when you have to learn the truth, no matter how hard it is to take!

Doctor?!

Bellemere!
[Enough!]

It's no use. These guys are real monsters. And I'm going to die.
Nojiko! Nami!

Bellemere! Don't waste your life because you're a stubborn fool! There is no reason for this fight when it can be resolved with the simple [exchange] of money!

Just pay the fee and I'll stop! A hundred thousand for each adult and fifty for each kid [???]. If you can pay for your whole famile I gladly spare your lives!

Family...

How much money do you have? You need two hundred thousand.

I don't have it. I'm not even close.

Hey! The table is set for three in here!

Ah! A family of three!

It's for me and my friend. We were supposed to have a nice dinner tonight, before you came.
Come, Bellemere. I know you've made something wonderful Pay them before our foods get cold.

Genzo...

Just pay the pirates and then they'll leave us alone. Now everyone is saved.

It's true! The village register shows no record of her merrying or giving birth. She's always been single.

Listen! There's no way that the pirates will ever find out about you. But you have to leave this island immediately and don't ever look back! It's the only way for all three of you to survive! We can't afford it any other way! You're much too young to be at sea alone, but you've survived before and if there's even a chance--

No. I don't want to. Where do we have to keave? They're the ones who came here! I... I want to stay in this village. It's because we're poor! That's why we can't stay together! Why?! Why can't they just go away?!

Well then, now we can all be safe.

Fine! We'll leave this island!

Nojiko!

We have to leave or Bellemere will die!

Wait! Who said I was paying for me?

That money I gave up was for my two daughters. But I can't pay you.

What are you doing?!

It's okay. I have to do this for my family. Even if it costs me my life.

Stupid girl...

It's true the three of us aren't related by blood, but we're a family. All I ever wanted was to be their mother. And now I can't be.

Bellemere!

Wait! No!

I wish someone rich would've adopted us instead of a sticky loser like you!

It was a lie! I was lying, Bellemere!

Bellemere!

Don't cry, girls. I wish I could've... I could've provided for you better. I wish I could've been a better mother to the both of you.

Don't say that!

We don't need anything! Just don't die!

Don't leave us!

You need to see the map I'm gonna draw, of the whole world!

Yes. Your map... [???] make your dreams come true. For me.

Bellemere, no!

So, these are your daughters?

Yeah! That's right! And you have to promise me that you'll leave alone!

No problem! As long as you die like a good girl.

Help us!

Well there. Don't kill them, boys. No, just teach them a lesson.
Now just set an example.
You ready to die?

Nojiko! Nami! Love you...

You just never learn, do you?

Let go! I'll pay you later!
Anyway you want!

You made a boy cry?

He made me mad!

Oh, it's okay. Kids will be kids.

He said your tangerines [suck/sucked].

He what?!

Bellemere!

Never give up. You must find the strength inside you to always move on. You must live [due/through] every moment. And if you can smile [and ???] it at all, that is the greatest strength.

Bellemere!

While I'm in charge, those without money will die! Now do you understand me, you worms?!

What's this? A map?!

No! That's my map! I drew it! You can't have it!

A child drew this?

Give it back!

Nami! No!

Huh?! Very good. She could be useful. Bring her with us.

Right.

No! Help!

Let her go! Let her go, [???]!

Wait! You promised not to hurt her if you got your money!

Right. I won't hurt, just borrow her for a while.

Genzo! Help me!

I won't let you take her!

Kuroobi.

Genzo?! Genzo! Genzo!
Genzo!!!

I'll... i'll save you, Nami... I won't let you go...

No! Please! It's okay! You don't need to save me!

Enouth of this!

I'll save you--

Please, no more killing!

All of our ships have been sunk... I'm afraid our plan [to have] Nami and Nojiko [escaped] to the sea was...

A bad plan. The marines won't bother trying to save us. We've lost our island.

Bellemere knew that this would happen. Her experience [as in the Marines] taught her that all these creatures are capable of. She knew that none of us would escape.

They've taken Nami. What am I supposed to do now? Bellemere...

We know where Arlong and his crew are! It looks like they're going to settle right here on this island! It's time to decide. We can fight to the death right now or we can take a chance [at] the Marines will someday come to save us and hope and pray we don't get killed before [then]! Your choice!

Only Marine Headquarters stands a chance against them. But they have their hands full with the Grand Line. The chances that they would come all the way out here for us are as good as zero. But I can't just sit here and abandon Nami. We must fight!

I'm in! I can't just stand by and do nothing [when} a child is in danger! Now who else will come fight beside us?

I don't care if [???] kill me, i'm gonna save that little brat!
Bellemere gave her life [???]
Let's fight! If just one of us fights they'll blame us all! So let's do it!

Good things will [come your way] as long as you continue to live.

Nami! Nami!

Nam!
What?!
You're okay?!

Nami! Nami!

Everyone, look! [???] she's back! [???]

Are you okay? Did they hurt you [any]?
Hey?

I'm... joining...

huh?

I'm joining Arlong's crew. I'm joining the Arlong Pirates. I'll get to be a navigator and draw maps!

What?!

What in the world are you talking about?
Stand back!
Did they threaten to do something terrible to you? Please, tell me.

No.

They must've done something!

No!

Tell me [truth!]

Let go of me!

Nami?!

No!

What--? That's an Arlong tattoo!

Not you!

But why?!

Look at this. They gave me all this money. They say they'll buy me anything I want.

No!
I will never forgive you if you join them! Don't you understand! They killed Bellemere in front of us! She died to keep us safe! I'll never forgive you! Never! You're not my sister!

Who cares! Why would I wanna live like Bellemere if they just get you killed! I don't wanna die like that!

How could you... Bellemere... Bellemere gave her life so that you and I can go on living together!

That's enough, Nojiko.
Leave us, Nami! Never set foot in this village again!

Nami!

I don't understand. How could she betray her family like that? For money?! Bellemere was like her mother!

Nami loved Bellemere. I know she did.

Hey. Didn't Bellemere always say good things will [come your way] as long as you continue to live? Lots of good things...

Yes. After Arlong took me, I watched him sink five marine ships like they were toys. I don't think they'll [stand] anymore. We're on our own. So I've decided I'd do something about it. I made a deal with Arlong to buy Cocoyashi Village from him.

Buy Cocoyashi? How?!

For a hundred million Berries. If I buy the town we'll be free. No one else will die. And all I have to do is join his crew and draw maps.

But a hundred million Berries?! You can't earn that working your whole life!

I will get that money, no matter what! [People are having [???] enough time paying their own tribute], so I have to do this alone. If anyone tries to help me those will get hurt.

Won't it be hard?

Yeah.

Living with the people who killed your mother.

I'll be okay. I'll just smile everytime I see his face. I'm not gonna cry anymore. I'm gonna fight by myself!

To make a choice like that when you're only ten years old... Do you know how hard It must've been?

All to save the village she love so much... That girl--

Ah! Whoever makes Nami suffer is going to [hear] from me--
Why did you do that?

Because! I'm telling you to stay out of it! If you go around saying that she's your friend, they're going to become suspicious of her! Then her eight years of suffering will [???] for nothing! Don't make it harder than it already is! She has to fight alone! Knowing that there are people who call her friend only makes the suffering worse!

Get back here, you little brat! Stop!

A pirate thief?!

That's right! The only thing this place has going for it it's plenty of pirates to steal from! I'm gonna make them pay!

You're all cut up!

Yeah. I kinda screwed up. But look! One million Berries!

Who cares about that?! You need a doctor!

It's nothing. These cuts are nothing.
No one will find it here! I'll save up, little by little. By the time this is filled I'll have my hundred millon. Still a long way to go.

One hundred million Berries... It's taken a while, but only seven million left... I can get that with one more job. Just one more trip and this will finally be over. Arlong's rule will be over. Cocoyashi Village will be free. I will be free. And then... And then I think I'll finally be able to smile again. For real. Bellemere...

So why did the marines want Nami?

Your job is to lead the way quietly.

The hat pinwheel?! Where in the world did he get that? It's so cool!

One more little job! Let's get [to] it.

Marines? Why is Genzo with them?!

Are you the pirate thief known as Nami? According to our investigation you've buried a good deal of [???] treasure somewhere in this tangerine grove. Now, you stole frome pitates, so we have no intention of arresting you. But theft is theft. Therefore, as of this moment, stolen goods become the [sole] property of the government! Now hand it all over! It's ours!

--ENDING--

All right! Now we know all about this island! Let's hurry up and meet with Luffy!
Yeah!
Uh, what are you doing?
Enjoying the moment. I can end Nami's suffering with my own two hands!
Hey, Nami, what's wrong?
You're still here?! Just leave this island already!

On the next One Piece

"Luffy Rises!
Result of the Broken Promise!"

I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
