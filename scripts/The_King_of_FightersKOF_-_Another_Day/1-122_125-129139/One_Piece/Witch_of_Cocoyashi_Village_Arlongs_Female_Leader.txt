What is he trying to say?
Let me go already.

I'm trying to say that's mine!

Oh, really? And who decided that?

I did! I put it on my plate. It's mine! That's how it works!

[Well, I don't see] your name on it anywhere.

I was saving it fot last! That's wrong with that?

Okay. Sorry. How about you eat this thing instead?

I wouldn't feed that rotten slop to my dog!

Shh! Quiet! There's something down there... It's big.

What the hell is that?

Sea monster!

It's a cow!

Not cow. They don't swim. A hippo?

Whatever it is, you can tell it's from the Grand Line!
What is it doing [???] here [of] the East Blue.

Why is he staring at us?

He wants the food!

What?!

Quick! Give it to him before he sinks the ship!

Gum-Gum Pistol!
Bad sea cow, stay away from our food!

Ha! Yes! You knocked it out!
Ah! Oh crap! You've made it mad!

You're back for more?!

Dumbass! There's no reason to punch this poor hungry hippo. She's probably just a baby and can't catch food for herself yet.
Huh? That right?

You're insane!

Here you go! Eat up! Don't be scared, I won't hit you.

What the hell are you doing, damn jerk?!

It was gonna eat me with the plate. What could I do?

Here it comes!

Right!

Stand back! This is my show.
Collier Coup!
That's that.

Yes! And back to the food!

That was refreshing.

You guys are insane. Seriously.

Where am I?

My house.

Huh?

Sleep well?

Who are you?

I'm Nojiko. I grow tangerines here. Want one?

That's right! You're the one who hit me on the head! Just when I was gonna save you!

I'm the one who saved you. If you had actually gone through with attacking that fishman you would have been killed for sure, stupid outsider.
You'd figure a kid from here would already know better. What would make a child do something so reckless? What's a question I'd really like an answer for.

I know! I know, but they killed my daddy! They took everything from me! Those fishmen destroyed our town, killed my friends. I had to make them pay for what they did! No matter what! Don't you get that?! So I went to Arlong Park by myself. But this girl's stopped me from going in! She's like an evil witch! I can stand this! I have to avenge my father! I don't care if I die!

Then die. If you truly prepared to die, then go. But you had better understand boy. I stopped you. And this witch you hate kept you from carrying out your revenge. So far you've cheated death twice. Just finish your tea and go.

Hey! You're being a little rough on him, don't you think?

I don't care who he is! If he wants to kill himself, then so be it! He doesn't have what it takes to suffer for revenge!

What?!

It takes time. I suffer as well. Revenge is not an easy path for one to carve out. And to die, just because you're too foolish for patience, is nothing but a coward's plan.

What do you want from me?! I can't stant the way I feel, but... but I don't know what else I can do!

How is your mom?

She's alive...

Then go back home. She's worried about you.

Okay...

For a chick with tattoos you're actually very sweet.

Piss off! It's time you told me why you decided to come here to our village.

Aw, right. My name is Captain Usopp. I'm looking for a girl named Nami.

Nami?!

You know her?

No way! She is a part of the Arlong crew?!

It certainly looks that way. Everybody here knows that cow. Even a little boy. It gets better, though. That cow is my sister. We grew up here. Well, technically she is my adopted sister, since we were both orphans. But a sister is a sister. You know what I mean?

I don't believe it! Nami's house?!

It's mine, too. We were raised together in this house. She's the closest thing to family I have left since our foster mother died. The three of us used to be so happy together in Cocoyashi Village.

So, you're telling me that Nami betrayed her mother, her sister and her whole village just to be a part of Arlong's crew?!

Yeah, pretty much. A real witch, huh?

Damn! Nami is a total witch! She had us completely fooled the entire time! To think she was just after that treasure for herself! Even after she risked her life to save my village! I don't understand. She seemed so happy with us.

Yeah? She was happy? Huh! My sister...

We came here to try to convince her to come back with us, but I guess now that's pointless. I just remembered that a shipmate of mine was taken prisoner by the fishmen before we got here! Oh, I'm in trouble. I hope he's okay. I hope he's at least not dead.

I guess you finally get it. I just used you guys to get what I wanted. You were skilled enough to serve my needs. But boy, you guys are bunch of suckers.

Oh, she had you guys completely fooled! It's no use. She's cold-blooded. She betrayed her family for money. So you really shouldn't feel too bad. If I were you I would just admit defeat and try to forget the day you met her.

I don't need to. Because I never saw anything in her to be trusted in the first place. If she turned out to be a serial killer I wouldn't be surprised.

Fine. Then why don't you just get the hell out of here? I'm tired of your face.

Hey, anybody know why that guy just jumped in the water?

It looks to me like he was just trying to get away from Nami.

I don't blame him. She can be really mean sometimes.

Maybe, he is trying to escape?
[???]

With his arms and legs're tied up? I gotta say that looks a lot more like a suicide attempt to me.

Leave him.

What an asshole! Now I don't get to kill him.

[???]

Seriously, life is a precious thing.

That idiot!

They're back up.

She saved him?!

What do you think you're doing?!

No. What do you think you're doing?! You're really just a nice girl who can't watch one guy die. Why don't you quit pretending? And you might wanna [jump] in a little quicker next time. I thought I was dead.

You bastard! Try that again and I'll make sure [you] die.

Really?

That's a lot of bandages... You must have been hurt pretty bad...

Actually, I forgot my shirt, grabbed this to cover up so you wouldn't get distracted.

Tell me, what should we do with this guy?

Lock him up! I'll take care of him when I have the time!

Arlong! Hey, Arlong!

Yeah? Well, spit it out! What is it?

Yes, sir! This guy didn't come here alone! There was another, a long-nosed weird-looking guy with him! But he got away!

What the hell, Usopp?! You left me for dead and got spotted anyway?!

I think... I think he [escaped to] Cocoyashi Village.

Cocoyashi, huh? That's perfect. Now I have two reasons to go. It's time to go have some fun.

Hey! Arlong's coming!

He is? But why?! We just payed him this month's tribute, didn't we?

It's probably about my weapons cache they found. Everyone, go home!

Genzo...

They're here!

So you're the fool who thought he could [???] weapons on my island?

That's me. I'm a collector. Is there a new law that forbids us from having hobbies now as well? Next you'll be telling us that we can't read [???] we [aren't] children anymore.

No, hobbies are fine. It would be weapons that I have forbidden. They make it difficult for me and my men to keep the peace.

That's him?! Arlong's gigantic! He's not even human!

Nope. He is a fishman.

For real.

I'm responsible for 20 towns and villages, including this one. And as your leader, I cannot tolerate even a little rebelliousness. Wiping out Gosa was just a small example of what can happen when you do not do as you are told. Tribute money must be payed no matter what.

What? Tribute money?!

It's just what it sounds like. Money we pay them so we can stay alive. Adults and children, if there's even a single person who can't pay then what happened to Gosa will happen to everyone in this village as well. Our town and the people in it will be wiped from existence.

He destroyed an entire town because of one person?!

That's how Arlong rules. To them we're nothing but a subspecies. So killing us has always been easy.

You pathetic humans need to stop of all this thinking you're up to. It's your greatest weakness. I'm allowing you to contribute to greatness here! Soon fishmen will conquer the humans and your tributes will be a small part of the beginning of the glorious Arlong Empire!

Arlong Empire?! They're planning on taking over the entire East Blue?!

Get out of here quick. Arlong's gonna be back soon.

Genzo!

The possession of weapons is a clear [???] to my authority. As an example to any other would-be rebels in this town, I'm going to kill you right now. So they can see the fate that awaits them!

No way! That guy is insane! He kills someone for just having a weapon!

i won't let him!

Hey, wait! Don't go out there!

You have absolutely no right to do this, Arlong! We've paid your tribute without fail for over eight years! Why would we rebel against it now?! Just think of [???]! It makes no sense! Now take your hands off Genzo!

Yeah!
It's not like he used the weapons!
That's right! Let him go!
Yeah! Let Gengo go!

[???] weapon shows he was planning a rebellion against me. But on the other hand, I could destroy you all. Please, try [not to] protect your friends, so you won't give me an excuse to do that. Either way is fine, but rebellions will not be tolerated!

Everybody, just go home. Do you want to waste all of our work over the passed eight years?! For what? The time for you to give your lives for this village was back when they first came. Now we must continue to be patient. The most important thing is that we continue to live. We swore that we would not let them defeat us as long as we were alive.

Genzo...
No...

Well said! I agree with you here. It's good to know that even disgusting insects like you enjoy being alive!

Oh no...

There is no way any of you will ever come close to the perfection of the fishmen!

Damn you!

Don't move! He wants you to attack.

We can't just stand here! Your deaths will mean nothing! You must continue to be patient! Even if I die...

That's a good ending for you.
Pay close attention, humans! This is what happens to those who defy me! Even if that's decent sign [???]!

Exploding Star!

What was that?!
Up there! Look! There's someone on the roof!

Who the hell is that guy?!

I am the great warrior of the sea Captain Usopp!

Usopp?!

Also known as the Demon King Usopp, feared and hated by almost half the world! I command thousands of men! Loyal [and ???] men!

That's the guy I told you about! The one with the long nose who got away!

Bring on your thousands of men! I'll crash them one by one!

The Exploding Star did nothing and now he's pissed!

Repulsive human, what can a creature like you do to me?!

Arlong! Hold on just a second!
After losing Gosa we can't afford to [???] any tribute money!
[???]

If we lose some, we can always get more! This man must [???]!

He's destroying it all!

Usopp!

Am I dead?! [???]

He's not dead yet!

Oh crap!

Get him!

Catch him and tear him apart!

Let's go back to Arlong Park before he destroys everything!
Yeah. I'm with you.

Don't let him get away! Who does that [???] think he is?!

We'll be back. You can all live for now.

I'm so sorry, everybody. This has all been my fault.

What are you talking about. You're not a fishman, are you?

Yeah! But who was that guy who attacked?

Hello, everyone! It's good to be back home!

Nami?!
It's Nami.
You...

What's wrong? You never just come walking through Cocoyashi anymore...

I heard quite a commotion. Arlong, huh?

I only have to get seven million more Berries.

Your already bad reputation just keeps getting worse.

That's fine. I am a pirate. Arlong can be a very reasonable guy when he wants to. I just need a little more money to finish our agreement. Just seven million Berries shy of the one hundred million goal. You know, it's really not that high a price considering that it's gonna buy back our village!

She tells me to run, but I've got nowhere else to go but here. Besides, I promised Luffy I'd bring her back with me. Man, what's he up to? Cause things are getting messy around here.

Yeah! Faster! [???] go faster!

There it is! Arlong Park is dead ahead!

Right! Next stop Arlong Park!



Luffy, why are you in a flying boat?!
I was in a hurry.
That's not what I meant! What the hell are you doing?!
I'm here to get Nami! Haven't you found her yet?
Well, that's kind of a long story...
Hey! Where's Long-nose?
Crap! Arlong's got him!

On the next One Piece
"Usopp Dead?!
When is Luffy Going to Make Landfall?!"

I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
