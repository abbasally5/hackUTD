  Do you know what the biggest difference between you and me is?

Nose?
The jaw?
Webbing!

Species!

Oh man! I bet that had to be painful! His teeth must be sha-- (shattered)

You see, this is the inherent power of fishmen. I feel sorry for you, pathetic humans, having been created with such limited power. We've been on a different level than you since the beginning of time. Being such inferior creatures it makes perfect sense for you to bow before me.
I'll show you - show you the real difference between you and I.

Okay. But there's no way I'm gonna lose to a big fish. I mean since I am gonna be King of the Pirates.

King of the Pirates? Don't be foolish. A puny human like you couldn't possibly conquer the Grand Line. You can't even crush a pillar with your jaws!

He's right. There's no way a human [can/could] do something like that. If those jaws got a hold of you, they will do a lot more than just leave some bite marks... They'll [snap] through your bones like a butcher!

Yeah! So what?! Quit your bragging!
You're not that awesome!
Besides, smashing stones with your teeth isn't that smart!

Way to go!
You're the best, Big Bro!
Tell it like it is!

Yeah! What idiot bytes a rock, anyway?

Fools! That's not the point!
Every member of the human race is ignorant and weak!
What good [to] you if you can't even pull yourself out of the water?

As a matter of fact, I'm worthless without my friends to help me out!

Uh? No way! Luffy's a swordsman?!

Ahh! Take that! And that!

Ah? This is a joke? Whatever is it, [it] isn't swordplay. You're just flailing about like a child playing pitates!
I hope you realize this isn't a game.
That's enough. Now, die!

Shut your face!

What?! He['s just] shattered Arlong's teeth!

You're right! I don't have a clue how to use a sword, you bastard!

Wait! What exactly is he trying to say here?

I'm a terrible sailor.
I definitely can't cook.
And I can't even lie!

Hey!

And without my friends to help me I would've been dead a long time ago!

So you fully admit how pathetic you are. You may be a fool, but you certainly are honest. How must your crew feel tolerating this idiocy day in, day out? I bet they sick of it. But that makes me wonder - why they tried so desperately to save their half-wit leader? Someone like you doesn't deserve a ship or a crew. What good is a helpless rubber-brain captain to them? What can you possibly do?

I can kick your ass!

Well, get to it, you numskull!

If he dies, I'm gonna kill him!

I've got your back, Luffy!

All right, Gum-Gum!

Get him, Big Bro!

Yeah! Go for it!

Cheer all you want, but it won't change a thing!

Uh! He's got new teeth!

I'm a shark! New teeth will grow one after another.
[And with each set] they become stronger and stronger. Endlessly.

Wow!

As many as it takes.
This is but one of the many gifts we fishmen possess!

That's so cool!

If you haven't yet realized that fishmen are superior, you will very soon!
Tooth Attack!

Huh?

[???]

Big Bro Luffy!

Arlong, please... It hurts...

What?! My brother?!

You're dead, you stretchy freak!
How dare you used my injured brother as a shield?!

What are you talking about?
You're the one who attacked me, don't you remember?

Phew... That was pretty scary.

Don't move a muscle, rubberman!

Hey, now that's an interesting idea...

He's got an idea?

It's in his brain.

Did he come up with some secret scheme?

Tooth Attack!

All right!

You... You fool! There's no point in crushing my teeth.
You really don't get it?!

Big Bro Luffy... uh... that can't be very sanitary...

So what? Now I have shark teeth!

Really, what were they expecting? It's Luffy.

How long do you intend to keep fooling around?

Ahh! Shark bit me!

So stop playing games!

Why, it's not like I'm having fun!

Tooth Attack!

Oh no!

Gotcha! And now we're even!

So you used my teeth, but your puny jaws aren't strong enough.
Now listen. [Sharp as my teeth are...] they're only useful when they come with powerful jaws like mine. Then they're deadly!

Ahh! Big Bro's gonna get his arm bitten off!

Is his arm okay?

If he took a single step back, his arm would've been ripped off.

Yeah, but he wasn't thinking about how animal fangs work. That require[s] a tiny bit of brain power.

Is he okay?
You think Big Bro Luffy's arm will make it?

Hey? Where'd he go?

Luffy! The sea!

Uh?
Hey, look! A shark!

No! That's Arlong!

So wait... He went under...?

Oh crap! This isn't good!
His abilities double in strength when he's under water!

Once my momentum in the water builds up, it's impossible to stop me.
This is precisely the kind of ability that makes us fishmen all the more superior.

Did he run away?

Now it's time!
Shark Darts!

Oh no!

A torpedo?!

Something just flew out of the sea!

Wow! I'm impressed you could dodge that.
Good job. But the longer you await your death, the more painful it will be.
Shark Darts!

Whoa! Just what kind of bones does that crazy shark have?! His nose crushed the ground!

Shark Darts!

Hey Luffy, hide!
Arlong went into the sea again!

Hurry up, Big Bro!
You gotta hide from him!

He's setting his sights on you right now!

Get out of there!

I won't hide!

Stop being so stupid!
Go around for cover before you become a target!

No way!
I'm not running anywhere!
I'm gonna catch him and break his nose!
Come on, you shark!

You've got some nerve! Or you realized that it's pointless [to try and hide] from me.

Did you hear us telling you that you should go somewhere and hide?! You've barely escaped his last attacks! If he [lends] just one direct hit, it will kill you! Luffy, listen to us - go and hide!

Now Gum-Gum... Shield!

Hey, wait! What's that position?!

I don't think that'll stop the attack!

I'll get double the speed from this distance.
This time time I'll pierce your heart, rubberman.
Now, take this! Shark Darts!

He's hit!

Oh no! Did he get hit?!

He's fine! He somehow managed to avoid it!

It's over! That attack won't work now!

Shark Darts!

You bastard! That was just pure luck!

Die!

[Bed Sheets!]
Gum-Gum Finger Net!
Fishing! Fishing!
And!

Huh?!

Spear!

Yahoo!

Is he dead?

Do you see the intensity in his eyes?

Oh no! It's the same expression that Sea Kings make before they snap!
He must've snapped with Luffy's last attack!

His eyes! I've never seen them like that...!

You wretched human!
What have you done to me?!
I'm a mighty fishman!

Whoa! That was crazy.
It didn't actually hurt but I can tell he's really like madder.

Oh man, what's that?

The Saw Blade!

That thing is gigantic!

Big Bro Luffy!

He won't stop! Luffy will get cornered!

He jumped in the building!

The left window on the top floor...
That's the room where...

That was a little too close!

There's nowhere else to run.
You and me, here, [in] the highest level of Arlong Park.
At last, the time of your death has come!

What is this room?
Lot of paper...

This isn't just any room. This is the room where I've made Nami draw all of her sea charts for me.

The Map Room...

This is Nami's room...?

These sea charts are what's she worked on all these years.
Just look around you. These maps are more valuable than any amount of treasure. You see, to us fishmen collecting data about the ocean is a simple affair, but assembling [that all of] information into a useful chart is a difficult task. That's why we needed a surveyor. In fact, that is a sole reason I'm so keen on keeping that woman in my possession. She's absolutely brilliant. The accuracy of her charts is beyond comparison. She's too good for human trash like you. Her talent should be used solely for building up the mighty Arlong empire!
Now listen - Nami belongs to me.

Is that so?

And you're interfering in our business, you human scum!
She's not your friend!

I don't care!
I don't care what you say!

Huh?

Because Nami is our navigator!


Amazing! It's such a fierce battle!

I finally figured out how to save her!

Hurry up and get to it, you damn rubber man!

I'll completely destroy the room that she wants to be free of!

Go! Get Arlong!

Luffy... Thank you.

On the next One Piece
"End of the Fishmen Empire!
Nami's My Friend!"

I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
