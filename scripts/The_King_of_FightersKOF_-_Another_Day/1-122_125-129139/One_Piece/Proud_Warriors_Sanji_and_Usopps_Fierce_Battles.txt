  Luffy...

Even if this wound would kill a normal man, I am not allowed to fail.

New Year's... Open!

Dragon Twister!

I think it's time to go rescue Luffy.

I'm sorry, but this is the best I can do for you.

I see. They couldn't move the stone, so they just moved Luffy's head above the water.

This is more like it! Somebody else, do something entertaining!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:0:&lt;h1&gt; 

It's an old man from the village. What a waste of time...!

Dammit! He sees me!

Such a pathetic attempt at trying to keep Rubber Boy alive!
I guess I'll just kill you too!

Where do you think you're going?

You, foolish human!
Are you really trying to fight me under water?! You can't even breathe down here! What makes you think you can fight?! As you wish, foolish boy...
Fishman Karate! Duelling Hair Tether!

Too bad. Your kick is powerless down here! That's more of your human weakness. But my Fishman Karate loses nothing in water! Quite the contrary - it's much more powerful!
Fishman Karate! Underwater Bladder Buster!
Fishman Karate! Flaming Axe Kick!
Back Food Jawbreaker!
Guffaw Palm Bomb!

Air! Air! Air! I let out too much! I can't breathe! Suffocating!

Impressive!

Crap! Let me through! I need to breathe! Move it!

You have amazing stamina. You sure you're human?

Let me through now!

Didn't you say something like "any man who hurts a lady is just a piece of crap"? And yet, look at what your precious love of women has finally gotten you! You have no escape and you'll die by my hand! The old man and the boy he's trying to save - they'll die too. I'll kill Zoro and the long-nose guy. Then I'll massacre the entire village and as my finall pleasure I'll murder that traitorous bitch Nami! Don't you see? Your love is worthless! If it can't save you, then you protect no one! Not even your little girlfriend Nami!
I'll admit that you' have some skills, but still in the end you're just a human! Your body doesn't react well to a sudden change in pressure, does it? Let's see, I have a theory about what's gonna happen to you - your organs are gonna explode from the inside out.
Pulverizing Pressure Plunge!

I can't let him do this! If I want to save Name, the first thing I have to do is save myself!

What's with him?! He just won't die!

Very well! I guess we'll just have to try it again!

Fishmen use their lungs to breathe there on land, but they use their gills to breathe water down here. Which means the [fish's] gills are useless on dry land.

Ready for your second go-around?

And their lungs are useless under water! Which means forcing air into his gills should suffocate this bastard!

Hm?

You...
Is he--


Don't worry. He's okay.

Are you sure?

The half of him.

Wait! Half?!

I'll explain later.
First, get your ass up here! I wanna fight where I can breathe!

You still don't get it, do you? It doesn't matter to me if I'm on land or in the water. I'm just as strong either way. Now you will witness the true power of Fishman Karate! Then I punched you before that was just a sample of things to come! My ultimate attack is 10 times as powerful. And the chances you survive it are zero!

Your neck!
You said my love was worthless?
Shoulder!
I can't protect anyone, is that right??
[Waist!] Back! Chest! Legs!

Son of a bitch!
Thousand-Brick Fist!

And now Face Shot!

Now it's done. He won't be back!

What was that? What's happening up there?!

Kuroobi...
Hachi...

In the end, they're all just sea food. A fish can't fight a cook. I don't know what he was thinking. This game is ours.

You bastards! You've killed my brothers one after the other... I'm afraid I've let you get too carried away!

All right, explain - Luffy's half okay - what does that mean?

It means he's alive for the time being, but if we want him fully back on dry land I've got to go back into water. But something tells me ugly over there won't let me.

Amazing... Really amazing! Those guys beat two of the Arlong's best fishmen!

I'm done. I can't hold my breath.

Take my place. I'll go.

He's looking better. Not so pale.

He spit out [a bunch] of water.

Did I miss anything?

They're doing great. Everyone's fine. For the first time I think I have a hope. These guys have fought so well. We may actually be set free!

Choo! What a pain in the ass! That long-nose freak sure could run forever. But it took just one blust from my Squirt Gun to take him out completely. Hmm, I guess I should [get] back. It's all over by now for sure.

It worked! I'm alive! I'm so glad I made the Ketchup Star for such occasions! He thinks he killed me with the water blust. Run along now. Go home. These guys are totally freaking nuts! I don't even know what I'm doing here! They destroyed an entire village and killed everyone in it! I know Nami can't do this all on her own, but seriously...

Huh?
I'm hearing things.

I don't mind hiding from death. Death is scary. Let's see - I'm covered in fake blood, but I need to look a little more beat up, like I fought bravely. Hey I know what's missing. Dirt! Yeah, [I'm] too clean.
"Hey, I'm sorry I got lost." Yeah, that's good. No! "I did my best, but [he/it] got me!" Maybe... "I was [disclosed/this closed] to the bastard and he got away!" That sounds better... Nah, it sounds like I'm trying too hard.

We're friends, right? So get on!

How about "Don't cry, Nami. We all did the very best we could."

[Never in my life did I imagine I lose!]

Or "Everybody fought very bravely."

But the truth is that our idiot captain is far better than a gang who'd prey on a lady!

Maybe "I nearly died by myself..."

It's for my business! This was my only choice!

"Nami... no, to tell the truth my injuries aren't bad at all. Really."

Big Sis Nami was crying. Do they need any more reason than that to put their lives on the line?

To make a choice like that when you're only ten - do you know how hard that must've been for Nami?

Aaah!

"I fought... bravely... I never quit... Yeah... That's..."
I'm just a liar! I'm nothing but a coward!
Stop right there, you son of a bitch!

Oh? You're still alive? Choo!

That's right, big lips! It takes more than water to kill someone like me!

Choo!

When I left home, I left everything behind: peace, safety. When you live your life on the edge, you savor every moment. That's why they're able to laugh so much! That's the reason I went to sea - I wanna laugh that way too! And if I don't fight with all I've got, then I don't deserve to be on the same ship with them! And I'll never be able to face my friends again!

Fool! You were better off pretending to be dead.
Human brain is an absolute waste of meat. Choo!

I... don't feel good...

Oh yeah?! I'm just getting started!

Stop it...

Choo?

Usopp Hammer!
Usopp Rubberband of Doom!

Choo?
Ahhh! Crap!
Where did that stupid son of a bitch go?!
I can't believe this!

Special Attack!

Sake?

Lead Star!

Is it the only way you can fight, you coward?
There's no place to hide from my Squirt Cannon!

Stupid coward or whatever - I can't run from this fight. I'm supposed to be a man. Although, it doesn't really feel all that great to be manly. If I lose, I'll die. At least, I'll die a pirate!

Squirt Cannon!

Ooh! No way! [This sucks!]

Dammit! Why should I have to waste my time with such an idiot?
It's too easy.
I'll shred you to pieces!
Squirt Machine Gun!

How did he find me?! Crap! Crap! Holy crap! I wanted to be a real pirate and now when I finally got my chance - [I know I can do it! I know I can!] I promise - if I survive this [???], I'll never pretend to be a pirate ever again! I won't be a coward and runaway! My fake pirate days are over!

What did you say [is] done?

This all fight!
Alcohol lights on fire!

Huh?

Usopp Flaming Star!

Ahh! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Water! Must find the water! Water! Water! Water!

Wait a minute!
Usopp Hammer!

Choo!
Bastard!

Usopp Hammer! Usopp Hammer! Usopp Hammer! Usopp Hammer!
Rubberband of Doom! Usopp Hammer! Usopp Hammer! Usopp Hammer! Usopp Hammer! Usopp Hammer!
I did it! I beat a fishman!
You see, [I'm not a loser] - I beat your ass!
I can't believe I actually did it! Usopp Pirate now! I am Usopp, the Pirate!

Please, breathe!
You need to come back now, before it's too late.
For your friends!

I must've been dreaming. For a moment [there] I thought we actually had a chance.

Ah, so what did that shark guy just do?

I don't know. It looked like he was just throwing water around, but then they both started to bleed.

i don't even have to touch you. You humans are so fragile that I can kill you just by playing around with a little water. That's the difference between you and me.

Shut up!

He's not kidding.
That's why the shark is King of the fishmen.
He's on the whole different level!

You should just die! Your lives are not worth that much. There's no one who will miss you when you're gone.

Arlong!

Hmm?

It's Nami!
You're here!

Hey, Nami! I was just teaching one final lesson to these pathetic little pirates. What are you doing here?

I'm here to kill you...


I'll hold on to the fishman, you go in the sea!

Yeah! Leave Luffy to me!

Ah! All right! I've got your back!

Hey! Aren't you kinda far away for that?

Um... well, I've got this thing about fighting Arlong...

Of course you do!

Ha-ha-ha! I'm saved!

On the next One Piece
"Luffy at Full Power! Nami's Determination and the Straw Hat!"

I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
