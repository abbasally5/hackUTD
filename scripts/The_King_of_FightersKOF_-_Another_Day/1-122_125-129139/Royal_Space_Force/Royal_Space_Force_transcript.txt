Shirotsugh:
How am I supposed to say if that was for the better or the worse?
I grew up all ordinary.
Middle class, countryside home, there was trees and streams.
Being in the middle, I never suffered the hardship of the poor, I couldn't grasp the frustration of the rich. I guess it's an advantage.
When I was young I knew what I wanted.
Only the Navy had jets, fast jets.They flew very high and very fast.
I needed to feel those wings. I'd been a pilot and I touched the wind. Maybe I would.
But they couldn't accept me.
My school graduated me, but my grades told a different story.
I wanted to achieve the greater heights, but I blew it, and I landed back in the middle…into the middle of the Space Force.

 Scene 1 has no dialogue.

Scene 2

General:
I have only two questions, cadet.
By whose permission are you dressed like that?
And exactly where have you been?

Shirotsugh:
Sir, before I joined the Royal Space Force, I admit to beig nowhere at all!

General:
Silence!　I have had enough of that kind of attitude!
You don't even understand what I'm talking about, do you?
You're a total disgrace to me and the dead!

Shirotsugh:
Yes sir, the position is disgraceful! I was asleep-

General:
You call yourself a soldier? How dare you display such disrespect?　You idiot!
Oh, just take your position.

Matti:
Yo.

Shirotsugh:
Wassup?

Nekkerout:
So, what's your excuse this time?

Shirotsugh:
Don't have one. Just thinking about a bunch of stuff.

Nekkerout:
What do you mean? Like where you put your uniform?

Shirotsugh:
Are you saying that I don't look as beautiful as the rest of you?

Matti:
Like he has any right to speak of respect.
If he had any respect, he wouldn't have let him die like that.

Shirotsugh:
I thought it was a test accident.

Matti:
That's what he hopes the police believe.
His urine bag ruptured in the spacesuit electrocuted him.

Shirotsugh:
A spacesuit? What the hell is that?

Matti:
Oh, C'mon! You know a spacesuit.
It's the suit you wear when they send you up.

Shirotsugh:
Huh?

Matti:
Manned artificial satellites.

Shirotsugh:
That's a lot of crap!　　[That's a lot of crap:でたらめだ。ばかばかしい]

Matti:
Yeah, and the little one's getting me crushed.

Darigan:
What I heard the current state of the plan is to be-- ah!

Instructor:
Prepare, men! Attention!
In unison, Space Force, sing out!

Workers:
You got it! Xx! You two, ready for lift!

Shirotsugh:
Majaho's parents sent him a box of bread; it's about this big.

Matti:
So, why send bread?

Shirotsugh:
I don't know. I guess his family lives on their own bakery.
Safer than this place. You know they might need some extra help.

Matti:
Yeah, I can see it. We both have kitchens mitts on, and we're baking croissants.
Big idea, Shiro. I'll go preheat the oven.　　[big idea: ばかばかしい大計画]

Shirotsugh:
I thought you would get the concept. I guess you don't.
All we are is eating and sleeping.

Instructor:
And here he is asleep again, sitting like a vat of basking fat, waiting for his dough to double in size!
Suppose I’m the bandit in Khozel. Your life now equals nothing.
But that’s familiar to you, right? And my gun’s in your face and your only offer is one Deem coin of overtime.
Think! You damn idiot! You’d be dead right now, and there’s your pay.
Do you ever even think? 500 sit-ups! Now!

Vender:
Tekkata! Hot tekkata! Get it while it's fresh and hot! Hot tekkata!

Background voices.
Come on!
Waiter, two more the same!

Domurhot:
So, what's up with you and your uniform?

Shirotsugh:
There isn't any time to change when you're stuck with double overtime.

Tchallichammi:
Kind of embarrassing for the rest of us.

Matti:
They love a man in uniform.
Could tell by the way they laugh.

Domurhot:
You have to laugh at an army no one's ever heard of.
The Royal Space Force, funny, isn't it?

Cadets:
Heads up!
In coming!
Hey!
Hey Yo!
A toast to the dead!
A salute to the man who died for his ship!

Background voice:
It's impossible xx my house every morning xx

Shirotsugh:
Salute!

Background voice:
As the monster's still going crazy!

Nekkerout:
Do you think the old guys are serious about it?

Matti:
Maybe if they kill us all off, they'll have to stop.

Nekkerout:
But it's impossible, Matti; everyone knows that manned space flight can't happen in our time.

Matti:
Yeah. But they're using us to speed things up.

Shirotsugh:
Maybe a miracle will happen and we can all find another job.

Matti:
Ask Majaho the breadwinner.
Three hit!

Shirotsugh:
(?Shit! are hell! )Two, one dead!

Woman:
Don't you see him?
Is it a uniform or what?

Man:
Got me; maybe Space Force.

Woman:
That's silly! What will they do? Fight with spaceman?

Tchallichammi:
Your move, spaceman.

Shirotsugh:
Knock if off! Just gxxing.

Matti:
Hahaha, five, six, three, four, ten, eight!

Shirotsugh:
Matti, what the hell are you steamrolling me for? Oh…

Matti:
Well, you could still win. Remember? The night's young, right?


Matti:
Hey, what are you doing? Come on!
Cheer up! After all it was just a game. Don't worry I could set up for ya.

Shirotsugh:
Matti, I'm just tired.

Girl:
Tohn, Tohn, xxx Here, I am! Oh, Tohn!

Matti:
Hey, sugar, the name is Matti!

Girl:
I was just kidding you around!

Matti:
I remember you too. And the perfume.

Girl:
And it doesn't surprise. Mimi asked to meet you ever since!
Come on! We're waiting.

Shirotsugh:
Hey, wait! What about the money?

Matti:
I hope you stay xx

Girl:
Mimi, Tohn's here!

Shirotsugh:
Well, Mr. Tohn gets lucky.

Riquinni:
(?Even if they made me unfocused, forgetful.)
God is love. And this love guides the lost.
The guide is so pure that our eyes cannot even see it.
God's word as He spoke for us. God's forgiveness is love and it's for everyone.
Even you! It's written here. The words of your God.
Everything else is trivial to the right.
We're blind to the tears of God. The Final Judgment… closes near. Your decision now brings forgiveness

Shirotsugh:
Huh? Shit! Where the hell am I? Thank god! I'm still alive!
Hey, Tchallichammi, last night?

Tchallichammi:
Everyone's home; it's a holiday.
I can almost make out the address. A new love hotel? “Please come”? What’s that supposed to mean?

Shirotsugh:
Hey, knock if off.
Do you mind if I use this?

Tchallichammi:
Seems like you are looking for a closer shave.  [close shave: ひげをきれいに剃る/危機一髪]
If you want my advice I suggest you find a safer bed to sleep in than a dead man's.

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:4:&lt;h5&gt; 

Shirotsugh:
Hey, little guy, is there anyone at home?

The pamphlet you gave me last night said there was going to be a meeting!

Riquinni:
The meeting?
Oh, yes, of course! Come inside. Please come right inside!
I'm so happy you're here! I'm so surprised someone will come out so far from the city!
Have a seat anywhere.
A-Actually it's better to sit right here. Okay, that's the strongest chair I have.
Well, I'll go get some tea, and I have some terish too.
Did you have any trouble finding the house?

Shirotsugh:
No, not at all. I came by the trolley

Riquinni:
Oh, I forgot. My name is Riquinni Nonderaiko.

Shirotsugh:
And mine's Shirotsugh Lhadat.

Riquinni:
I'm very pleased to meet you.

Shirotsugh:
Ah, you can just call me Shiro.

Riquinni:
Shiro's a fine name.
I'm so happy someone finally came!
How do you like your tea?

Shirotsugh:
Straight-up, if that's okay.

Riquinni:
Prefect! I like strong too.

Shirotsugh:
So, boy, what's your name?

Riquinni:
Manna is a little girl.
Honey, will you do me a favor and help me set the table for our nice guest?

Shirotsugh:
Uh, thank you very much.

Riquinni:
Manna's very shy, but she seems to like you.
It's a little overcooked.
I hope you…,um, don’t mind.

Shirotsugh:
Guess I'm good with kids.

Riquinni:
Here, they always say burnt terrish taste better with strong muuk.

Shirotsugh:
Ah, I haven't smelled home-made terrish and tea such a long time.
Bottoms up!
I'm sorry, I forgot where I was.

Ah, what a delight!
Hey, wait! Where have I heard that word recently?

Riquinni:
God said "human delights eclipse the joy of heaven."

Shirotsugh:
Yeah, it's all screwed up.
And the parents today are bringing up all of our kids even worse.

Riquinni:
And then the generations born will become lost.
Oh, by the way…

Shirotsugh:
Mh-mm

Riquinni:
You haven't told me what you'd hope to find.

Shirotsugh:
Well…, this guy died. A cadet, just like me.

Riquinni:
Oh, no!

Shirotsugh:
They said it was an accident… again!

Riquinni:
Mister Lhadat, that's horrible.

Shirotsugh:
I've lost my concentration. Well, I can't think, I can't eat-

Riquinni:
So, what is it exactly that you do?

Shirotsugh:
I, well, I-I'm in the Royal Space Force.

Riquinni:
What's that?

Shirotsugh:
Well, I guess it's okay. A lot of people don't know.

Riquinni:
Then, you're a soldier?

Shirotsugh:
Right! Well, yeah, sort of, but we don't fight though. They're supposed to send us in the space.

Riquinni:
The stars? Could that really be possible?

Shirotsugh:
Yeah, that's what they said.

Riquinni:
Ah, what a wonderful job!

Shirotsugh:
Ah… wonderful?

Riquinni:
That's so beautiful!
An untouched place among the stars to be completely free of all the troubles that are plaguing our world.

Shirotsugh:
I guess our face's…unique.

Riquinni:
I think this must be the greatest day of my life.
Do you think you can tell me more about the stars? I mean being in the military, you probably don't have enough time.

Shirotsugh:
I got time!

Riquinni:
I dreamed once that our children would fly off of the earth and actually found peace.

Shirotsugh:
It could happen if all of the borders were gone. So what else have you dreamed of?

Riquinni:
Is it true they are soldiers who don't kill people?

Shirotsugh:
Of course not! The Space Force never kills people.
Our job is to fly, well... to the highest heights!
Imagine it! A place where all mankind can find a new freedom.
We have to..., and I'm going be the one to find it!


Narrator:
Yet another typical example of human error, error such as misreading gauges or such as disregarding-

Shirotsugh:
Good!
Hello, cadets, well, is there anything new in the test film?

Matti
Well, nothing to write home about.　 [nothing to write home about:どうと言うことはない]

Kharrock:
Ga-bwah!

Matti:
Hey, you borrowed my bike last night, didn't you?

Shirotsugh:
Well, I should have asked, but I needed the night breeze to clear my thoughts.

Matti
At least, fill it up! The damn thing's empty.

Shirotsugh:
Such trivial thoughts are just wasting the Space Force's time.
Remember, gentlemen, we are the proud, ugh, member's of the team, the Royal Space Force!

Matti:
That's odd. The bike looked okay. Do you think he just fell off it?

Kharrock:
I guess so.


General:
You're the proud. You're members of the team.
Khi Lei Kerass's work, "Impossibilities of the Galactic Travel" has been in print now for over 30 years.
The last twenty years of advancement have made thousands of such books obsolete!
This mission will succeed. We'll prove them all wrong!

Darigan:
Then the guys told me that it was handy. Handy! Can you believe it?
For God's sake, a flower pot drain! Crazy!

General:
The Gida Satellite project experienced five failures out of seven launches!
(?It's sure in attention!)
And now after ten years of intensive diligence, the House of Nobles is commanding an abandonment of the project!

Majaho:
I said I heard the Nobles are gonna cut off the appropriation. Didn't you?
Damn stain! I gotta find another job!

General:
Our cost, the price of failure, the limitations of those great works inhibit each of you from writing the future in your own way.
The vastness of space is beckoning mankind.

Domurhot:
Huh? What the hell does that mean "a warship"? It doesn't even have a little flare gun.

Kharrock:
He's calling it a warship.

General:
Do you hear what I said?
A challenge to all mankind to find peace at last!
Are you all deaf?

Nekkerout
Yeah, launching something that heavy is impossible.

Yanaran:
No way!

Tchallichamme
Hey, even if we got up in the space, everyone screw it all up.

General:
And my proposal to the Nobles House lacks only the volunteer's signature.

Matti:
Isn't this the life?

General:
I've stood beside you, with you through each and every casualty.
Yes, and they are martyrs to our cause.　  [cause: 大義、目的]
But this is the time to bury all of our sorrows. Do you understand?
I'm looking for a goddamn astronaut!

Shirotsugh:
Lhadatt, sir, I volunteer!

Matti:
What? You're crazy! What the hell are you saying?

General:
You're… you're Shiro…

Shirotsugh:
Shirotsugh! Shirotsugh Lhadatt, sir!

General:
Uh, yes, Lhadatt…and is there anyone else?
No…okay. Very well, then call out the volunteers, fill out the forms.
That's all.

Instructor:
Dismissed!

Cadets:
You fool! Son of a bitch. You moron! You're crazy!

Matti:
You remember we signed up together? Can you remember that?
What about the bread? What the hell has gotten into you?　 [What's gotten into you? :（奇行をする相手に）一体なぜ／なんてことを]

Shirotsugh:
Matti, both you and I have a purpose.
We are the chosen! The future has chosen all of us!

Cadets:
Oh! No! Come on!

General:
You surprised me, Lhadatt.
Frankly, I wasn't expecting much, if any thing, from your test and training.
But you're doing much better than I imagined you were.
There's a chance you'll survive.
Yes, well, we work with [? bad] material we have.
But in spite of these obstacles, the project should begin then move quick there.
If everything goes according to plan, I'm leaving for the capital to convince those bureaucrats to give us our space warship.

Shirotsugh:
Um, do you mean it'll have weapons on it?

General:
Of course, but that won't be all.
The ship will be out fitted with all sorts of clever gadgets and devices to keep you alive.
But we might have to cut down on some of those.
And there was something else to tell you.
Ah, I forgot what I was gonna say. Dismissed!

Shirotsugh:
Yes,sir.

General:
Oh, wait a minute! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
It's coming back to me!　Oh yeah, flying!
Oh, airplane!
You need gravity training in an airplane.
Have you ever flown before?

Shirotsugh:
No. Where do we get an airplane?

General:
Borrow one.

Shirotsugh:
Borrow one? From where?

General:
The Air Force! And don’t screw up!

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:6:&lt;h5&gt; 

Matti:
Well, look at a fly boy's fancy suit!

Shirotsugh:
This thing's cutting off my circulation.

Cadets:
Check it out.
So, is that a parachute?
What's this thing for?

Shirotsugh:
Hey, cut it out! Don’t touch it! C'mon!

Yanaran:
Came off.

Shirotsugh:
I xxx

Pilot:
Hey, hey!

Shirotsugh:
Sorry, I'll be right there.

Pilot:
Not there, front.

Shirotsugh:
Oh, yeah.

Control:
Greto thirty-two, you are clear for takeoff, repeat you are clear for takeoff.

Matti:
I think I hear him. Yup.

Airmen:
What does he expect me to do? Like I gotta another job to take car of?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Cadets:
You don't look so hot. I feel sick!

Airmen:
That goes to show you the sky's for men not little boys.
And after they came so far to play with.

Kharrock:
Uh-oh, Matt,.Matti!

Matti
Hey, it's not play.

Airman:
What is it?

Matti:
Work!

Airmen:
It's only work if there some fighting to do?
And who are you gonna fighting in the space?
Don't worry. If you run into any space monsters, I'll shoot 'em down!
Hey, buddy, you have to show a little bit more respect around here.
Those talking shit piles in front of you happen to be commander and major, no less.
Huh? You mean you guys are soldiers? Excuse me all the hell.
I mistook you for a bunch of kids just here to play with all any toy--

Shirotsugh:
Oh, please, guys, I really can’t handle this right now!

Airman:
Hey, you, come here, you're a lousy son of a bitch!

Shirotsugh:
No! Stop, stop!

Darigan:
In a bad mood, Matti?
I'd be too if I got my sorry butt royally kicked by a sergeant?
The whole town's talking about it. You should stick to officers.

Matti:
He looks worse.

Darigan:
Did you get him good?

Shirotsugh:
Even I felt sorry for the bastard.

Matti
Yes, what else?!

Shirotsugh:
Aw, stop it!

Darigan:
Okay, you two, here's the Space Force's secret factory!
You're gonna love this, guaranteed.

Matti:
Ah, unreal!
This is great, men!
Look at this place those Air Force (?asshole shit on out of this.)
Yeah, this is it! We'll pack you up and shoot you up! Then bang! Our hero's death

Shirotsugh:
Is this the Space Travel Society?

Darigan:
Yeah. They've been working at this while now.
You mean those old farts did all of this?

Dr. Gnomm:
What? Old farts? So, what kind of primate do we have here?

Darigan:
This is Doctor Gnomm. He just got back from an expedition to the North Pole.

Dr. Gnomm:
I'll have you know that I was flying rockets before you were even an itch in your daddy's crotch!

Darigan:
The Doctor pioneering in nozzle research.

Kharrock:
Please, would all personnel assemble!
I have reviewed these plans and have found a problem, a serious design flaw.

Dr. Gnomm:
Well, then spit it out!

Kharrock:
The third stage. You have put a hydrogen engine in the section.
And I wanna know why. Has it been proven to be practical?

Old man:
Not yet. It's just theoretical prototype.

Kharrock:
You can't run an engine test using this design!

Old man:
We all felt a hydrogen engine will work best for the third stage acceleration!

Kharrock:
You are wrong!

Old man:
Xx who do thing you are? You know nothing! How dare you criticize our work?

Martti:
Here's the pilot. Does he get a say in any of this?

Old man:
And what is your opinion?

Lhadatt:
I'd kinda like to live a while, so I vote for the safest way.

Old man:
Bah! Undue concern.

Kharrock:
Oh, minor detail.

Dr. Gnomm:
We might find the second stage in other areas.
What would you propose we do?

Kharrock:
Everything from here to the head of section four is like something out of the Stone Age.
I can show you how to reduce the payload weight and improve combustion efficiency.

Dr. Gnomm:
When do you think this could all be ready?

Kharrock:
By… next month.

Dr. Gnomm:
When next month?

Kharrock:
The fourth of Poh.

Dr. Gnomm:
Fine! We'll have to wait till then. The fourth of Poe it is!
Okay? That's that! Alright! Get back to work!

Shirotsugh:
It's commonsense, you throw a rock, it falls to the ground.
You throw it harder straight at the horizon, it falls to the ground again but further away.
You take anther rock and you throw it even harder.
And then it will reach a speed that won't let it fall.
That's when the rock hasn't fallen.
Above the atmosphere, falling all ways along the curve of the planet.
Even a slight deceleration, it falls to the ground.
Well, the machine they're working on night and day is like the rock.
Built to be thrown and then fall down.
But if falls down, when we want it to.
It's simpler to remember it.
If you were thinking from the prospective of the rock.
Otherwise it just gets too technical.
You can hardly talk to them.
I mean the old guys in the Space Travel Society. Well, all except for Doc. Gnomm.
He's the only one who makes any sense.
I don't think the project would've ever worked without him.

Dr. Gnomm:
Torom, Marhida, Gana, Moraa. My sons, say hello to cadet Lhadatt.

Shirotsugh
They're engines.

Dr. Gnomm:
They are not! They're my kids! Don’t' you know anything at all about manufacturing?
These are my children born from the fruit of labor!

Shirotsugh:
So, where the names come from?

Dr. Gnomm:
Torom, got his name for the poisonous fish in the Eska Sea.
Marhida is from the North, man-eating whale.
Gana, the snake from the River Yvsak.

Man:
It's ready!

Dr. Gnomm:
Let him go!
Best way to face the deadly enemy is to adapt the little bastard.

Shirotsugh:
They sound like girls names.

Dr. Gnomm:
Listen to this.

Why is it so dark?

Well, the landlord shut up our power.

Shirotsugh:
That's terrible.

Riquinni:
Anyway, the candle light is so pretty.
Mana's made up the funny shadow plays.

It's so clear tonight. That's why I drove out to stars.
You can see 'em better when you're outside

Riquinni:
Wait! I'll be right down!
Hurry, Manna, come look at the stars.

Shirotsugh:
Light, that one over there; it's called Prow.
It’s seventy light-years away. Understand?
The light you see is seventy years ago.

Shirotsugh:
Well, it's like this. If I were seventy years old, I would be seeing the light the night of my birth, well, this very night.

Manna:
There's a star!

Shirotsugh:
Uh-huh, they're stars.

No, I had… Great! Got i!!
There you are. A picture of the earth.
Err… here!

Riquinni:
The world’s black?

Shirotsugh:
No, it isn’t. The world’s the white part.
It’s just a pretty bad satellite radar picture.

Riquinni:
I think I understand now. From out there stars can tell the difference of what we’ve done.
Please forgive us. Dear God, can you ever forgive us for showing the stars the fires of so many wars?

Cadet:
Salute!

Shirotsugh:
It’s your Holly Book, so why me?

Riquinni:
Open it up. Please you have to read it.
I know in my heart that it’s supposed to help you.

Shirotsugh:
I could understand this so much better if you would read it to me.
What’d you say?

Riquinni:
Manna, Manna, come inside and help me make some tea.

Lhadatt:
Can’t you have fun? I think that by now you and God should’ve worked out some kind of compromise.

Riquinni:
Oh, you do?

Shirotsugh:
Come on, be reasonable!

Riquinni:
What do you mean “be reasonable”?
The world is all messed up because… because of that kind of compromise!

Shirotsugh:
What is so bad about that?

Riquinni:
Manna, I said go inside! Oh, honey, I’m so sorry.
No, we weren't fighting. I’m sorry I yelled. It’s okay. Shiro’s nice. You know that.

Nekkerout:
Voila! A little present from papa.
May I show you to your room, sir!

Shirotsugh：
Huh? Cool! Me first! Wow, this is great!

Nekkerout:
85 million radeks, bro, 85 million! It’s a pricy toy, so don’t break it!
It’s gonna be loads of fun getting the Assembly to approve this appropriation.

Shirotsugh：
Huh? What do you mean it hasn’t been approved yet?
Where did the 85 million radeks magically appear from?

Nekkerout:
Here and there.

Shirotsugh：
Here and there?

Nekkerout:
You really don’t know? Hmm, ahem,
Well, the general’s from nobility, you know, so, he is in good with the royal family.
You get it so far?

Shirotsugh:
Mm-hm.

Nekkerout:
And then there’s a slightly illegal business he runs on the side

Shirotsugh:
How? On the phone.

Nekkerout:
That’s all he needs is just a phone.
It’s hard to keep up with.
You see, from this year on, the royal family’s business cars will be from Migren Motors.
The same Migren Company that makes the army’s rockets.

Shirotsugh:
Mm-hm!

Nekkerout:
That’s how all it works!

Hello, this is Space Force Headquarter, hello?
Shiro, it’s your girl.

Shirotsugh:
Hey there, what’s going on?

Riquinni:
Oh dear God! Shiro, you have to come and help us!
Hurry! Please hurry!

Martti:
Just look at her! She’s all polished up.
See that shine?　She’s irresistible!　All cleaned up and wait for a good ride.
Hey! Here xxx! No.

Riquinni:
I didn’t believe that they do it. The power company.
It was my aunt’s house. She owed them so much money!
The letter said they do this. It’s my fault.
Thought my prays would that they-

Shirotsugh:
You prayed?
That has stopped people from bulldozing your damn house?
The power company! Yuck!
I am sick of this! No one should ever force you around like that.
If the state won’t pay, I’ll find a lawyer!

Riquinni:
Don’t yell. It just makes it worse.
It makes her cry even harder.
Her parents used to fight all of the time, night after night.
Please don’t yell. It scares her so.
Stop it! You’re scaring her!
Please forgive us. I’m very sorry if we were bothering you.

Shirotsugh:
What do you mean bothering? Don’t talk like that.

Riquinni:
There’s a church very close to here.
Maybe they’d have enough room to take Manna and I in.
I’m pretty sure that they’re going to be able to help out.
Manna would have some friends, somebody she can play with.

Shirotsugh:
I understand. I’ll dig your stuff out for you.

Announcers:
This rare footage shows the architectural beauty of the Nedens Castle.
Good weather till then. The expected storm front has shifted and-

Riquinni:
God is all, the living fire.
Mankind was created safely away from any knowledge of the Age of Fire.
And our sorrow began when Dao suddenly stole a torch from God, then run as fast as he could.
Unbeknown to Dao within God’s fire burnt hidden curse,
Dao after this age returned to God with the stolen touch brightly blazed by each of his seven dead sons.
God then spoken to Dao saying all further children born by your act shall suffer from the fate which you have brought for them, and forever after each shall murder each other until mankind is no more.


Shirotsugh:
Are you sure it’s safe standing this close to it?

Dr. Gnomm:
Yes. Very close
You go close to a child after 20 years. When they get grow older, they xx like their father.
Hard is if they grow up!

Shirotsugh:
So, what do you usually serve your kids for breakfast?

Dr. Gnomm:
Nothing!
(?If they’re going to continue their act xx your act you should send straight up to no dinner!)

Shirotsugh:
One, five, four.

Nekkerout:
One, five… four.
You were really lucky not to get hit by any fragments.

Shirotsugh:
Yeah.

Nekkerout:
You managed to get off with hardly scratched, while the doc winds up in the hospital.
 [get off with:逃れる、済む]　[wind up in a hospital: 病院に行くはめになる]

Shirotsugh:
Well, the old coot deserved it, leaving me there like that.
Next one’s five, six.

Nekkerout:
Five, six. This is also gonna make factory access a lot harder.

Shirotsugh:
One, three, four. So, why?

Nekkerout:
Oh, probably because of those fun-loving radicals.

Shirotsugh:
What radicals?

Nekkerout:
Where have you been? The guys who disagree everything the emperor says.
They’ve been busy with all those protest.

Shirotsugh:
It’s news to me.

Nekkerout:
Yeah? They’ve been building up steam for a while.
So, don’t think for a minute that explosion was an accident.
Next!

Shirotsugh:
Three, four, eight, five.

Nekkerout:
Huh? Let me see that. Shit! That’s a wrong row.

Tchallichammi:
I just can’t seem to be going…

Shirotsugh:
Sorry, I just can’t see it exactly.

Nekkerout:
Someone get the cat and his free-living pet out of the new computer!

Shirotsugh:
Pardon me, don’t you have a job to do?

Tchallichammi:
Didn’t get any sleep last night.
(?I feel with dizzy one of the old codgers)

Nekkerout:
You idiot!

Yanaran:
The Doc! He’s dead!

Shirotsugh:
What?

Yanaran:
They just called from the hospital.

Announcer:
Our Nation’s Capital, the royal family invited all members and affiliates of the Space Force to a gala promotional reception.
Making an appearance was Commander Shirotsugh Lhadat, the world’s only astronaut
In response to Prince Toness’s query “Doesn’t the idea of going into space frighten you?”
He lightheartedly replied “No, it really hasn’t bothered me”

Protestors:
(?We can no longer endure this injustice! We sole speak one point and it’s time we call that how we really feel!)
(?Morning xx get colder and colder for us.
As winter comes we’ll tied rag and xx around our bodies! )

Domurhot:
Out of way. Let me through!
Hey, what’s with the people out front?

Darigan:
Protest rally
And it was really crappy this morning.
(?While we saw that fighting and begging going on.)

Domurhot:
Like it’s our fault.
Is it an unemployment movement?

Darigan:
No, no! The antiwar movement. They are saying we should be building bridges, not rockets.

Domurhot:
Could’ve sworn it was the unemployment crew.
Bridges, right! Something useless (?for more money out.)
You know, they ought to ship these bums to the country where I’m from.
I-

Shirotsugh:
Bridges make sense than warships. Bridges are not killers.

Domurhot:
Hey, Shiro, go easy on that talk. Don’t let them get to you.
They are just mourning about work. That’s ll.

Shirotsugh:
This rocket’s made for war though.

Domurhot:
Then what?
Bridges can’t be used for war?
Hey, come up ! You’re the one who started this!

Shirotsugh:
Er..who… I think not.

Domurhot:
Then who started it,huh?

Darigan:
Hey, come here!

Annauncer:
Commander Lhadat continues his vigorous training machine which will prepare him to be the first man in space.
After his morning’s activity, our astronaut enjoys a hearty breakfast of fresh bread and warm kress verries.

Shirotsugh:
You bet it’s good. It’s so good for you.

Interviewer:
Thank you, Mister Lhadat.

Matti:
Hey, seen this?

Nekkerout:
You asshole, what’s the hell wrong with you?

Matti:
Nekkerout, look, we gotta talk! Oh, you’re wet!
Listen! We’ve gotta trouble. Over here.
You can’t deny it. It’s right here!
Why does this say the launch site move all the way south to Kanea?

Old man:
It wasn’t our choice.
The army decided not to let us use their site after all.

Nekkerout:
Huh? 600 rens west of Kanea? That’s over the border!

Old man:
Don’t panic. Over there’s a map. I can show you.

Matti:
It’s right on the demilitarized zone.

Old man:
Oh, you boys are getting upset over nothing.
The site is 3,000 rens close to the equator to make it easier to launch, you see?

Matti:
I get the picture, you goddamn!
It’s crazy!　They’re sending us to a war zone to launch the world’s biggest firecracker!
Did anyone try to stop them, didn’t you? Didn’t you?

Old man:
It’s not our decision. It’s Ministry’s.

Matti:
What’s that? Ministry? Defense Ministry?

Guard:
Company, right face!

High official:
It’s too hard to him.
Use common tongue.

General:
Ah, I appreciate that. Ah, but actually there’s nothing more to say.

High officials
All right, then I shall speak.
Rockets! Humph! As you say we can neither understand nor justify such things!
And space travel, humph!
The army last behind your back. Investing in something, it only flies in the space!
This program serves no military purpose.
Whatsoever it simply isn’t right!
The very existence of the Space Force’s a monumental error.

General:
Well, then why let the project get this far long?

High officials
The royal family, the Ministry of the Interior in the creation of the Space Force.
All the entangled griefs grow from the same trunk.
What seemed a promising venture ten years ago has soured into regret.
Its purpose’s since been forgotten.
There’s no real use for the program. We must end it.

General:
But, but this project has gained such momentum. It’s attracting worldwide attention.
Even the Republic wants our information.
And the idea of launching on Rimada’s boarder, a subject state of our enemy.

High officials:
Go right ahead. Launch it whatever you pleased.
The point is we’ll be in full use of Republic’s occupation’s force.
And what do donkeys do when they see carrots dangled under their noses.

General:
No, they’ll steal it!

High officials:
Stealing it, huh? Yeah, I hadn’t considered that. Could be useful after all.
Yes, a border violation via military force and outright theft of government property will compound a crime.
The only real question is whether or not they’ll actually attack!
Don’t worry about that. Our friends across the border have quit investment in your little rocket as well, huh?

Instructor:
Ready?

Shirotsugh:
Yes.

Instructor:
Let’s begin.
Now there, you’re cursing merely alone, mining your own business.
The altitude is 3000. The speed is 200 rens per second, and the next zone where we can make contact with you is far over the horizon.

Shirotsugh:
Pressure abnormality in oxygen tank one. Primary line’s closed. Auxiliary’s open. Three.
Suspending nitrogen supply. Inertial system’s reading abnormal acceleration.
Setting general circuits to prescribed positions only.
Internal pressure unchanged.

Instructor:
Good! Much better the last time. You’ve earned your paycheck, kid!
Next crisis situation No.5-7-5.
