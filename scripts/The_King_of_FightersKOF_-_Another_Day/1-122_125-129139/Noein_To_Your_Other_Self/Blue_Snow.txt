Fukuro: Don't let it hit the ground!

Kosagi: Where is Karasu?!

Fukuro: Go around to the left!

Kosagi: Not again! It has a shield!

Fukuro: Karasu has gotten through!

Fukuro: It's no good. It's collapsing! Get away from that, Karasu! Karasu, no!

---------- <Title> ----------

Haruka: Hey, will you stop? This is for Mom.
Baron, you've gotten awfully fat lately.
Mom, wake up! Breakfast is ready.

Asuka: Haruka, what time is it?

Haruka: It's already past eight. I've got to get to school, okay?
I'm leaving. Bye!

Asuka: See you later, honey. Have a nice day!

Miho: That was definitely a ghost. They wander around aimlessly without even realizing that they're dead. Whatever you do, don't ever speak to a ghost. 'Cause if you do, you'll get pulled into the spirit world!

Haruka: Good morning, Ai.

Ai: Hi, Haruka. Good morning.

Haruka: What's going on over there, anyway?

Ai: Miho's telling all about the supernatural.

Haruka: Oh, I see.

Ai: Kyoko from Class 2 says she saw a ghost in the alley behind the church.

Haruka: A ghost?

Ai: Yeah. A ghost wearing a black coat.

Yukie: All right, everyone! The bell has rung, class.
Take your seats, right away!
Let's have discussion about the summer break after homeroom, all right?

Isami: Miss Yukie!

Yukie: Yes, Isami?

Isami: Will you go on a date with me during summer break?

Yukie: I'm so sorry, but my date part is all booked up for the next 3 years.

Isami: No way!

(Announce): Be sure to watch out for cars on the way home from school.

Yukie: No running in the halls!

Ai: Oh, yeah! Tomorrow night. You wanna get together to test our courage for a night of fright?

Haruka: Why not?

Miho: We'll hunt for ghosts! Since it's summer break, we can stay out late, so let's all go together!

Ai: What do you say, Isami?

Isami: Huh?

Ai: Do you wanna go out for a night of fright?

Isami: Did you say "night of fright"?

Miho: Yeah, we're gonna go out tonight and hunt for ghosts!

Isami: Man, you guys are ridiculous. You mean to say you still believe in ghosts? There's no way stuff like ghosts exists. It's scientifically impossible. What a bunch of losers. Right, Yu?

Miho: I don't think so! There're still things that happen in this world that can't be explained by science!

Isami: Wrongo! Listen. There're no such things as ghosts.

Miho: Oh yeah? Then let's go together to make sure!

Ai: Well, I guess that settles it. You're gonna come with us, Isami.

Isami: Why? I don't wanna. Why do I gotta go anyway?

Ai: What's the matter? Don't tell me you're scared.

Isami: No, I'm not afraid of any ghosts. Isn't that right, Yu?

Yu: I have to go to cram school, so I can't go.

Isami: But I thought...

Haruka: Yu, wait up! Where're you going? Are you mad about something?

Yu: No, I've just got a lot on my mind.

Haruka: Ah, what?

Isami: Man, Yu's been acting kind of bizarre lately, you know?

Ai: He can't help it. Yu has middle-school exams coming up soon.

Haruka: Yu?

Yu: How long do I have to stay here? Will I ever be able to get out?

Kooriyama: Hey, did you know?

Uchida: Did I know what?

Kooriyama: That this is the first day of summer break?

Uchida: Oh, it's summer break? I haven't had any kind of break for five years.
It's appeared again.

Kooriyama: Maybe just picking up some kind of radio signal, huh?

Uchida: Don't pretend to know everything!

Kooriyama: Relax. How are you gonna report it to the headquarters?

Uchida: They won't give me the time of day with this pitiful amount of data.

Kooriyama: Well then you're just gonna have to try a whole lot harder, Uchida.

Uchida: You're the last person that should be telling me that. And please don't smoke those filthy things in here.

Haruka: Oh, wow! Look at the time! Gotta go! Bye!

Ai: See you later. Have a good one, Haruka!

Haruka: I will!

Kooriyama: Summer break, huh?

Uchida: Huh?

Miyuki: Yu...?

Yu: Yeah, Mom?

Miyuki: Do you understand that summer school starts today?

Yu: Yeah.

Miyuki: For summer break I want you to concentrate only on your studies.

Yu: I know, Mom.

Miyuki: Yu? You can do this, you must have discipline. Yu? I think it's best if you stop seeing your friends. At least for the time being. Don't you think?

Asuka: Night of fright?

Haruka: Yeah, we're doing it tomorrow night. It's okay, isn't it?

Asuka: Just 'cause it's summer break doesn't mean you can goof off the next three months.

Haruka: But I'm not goofing off! I made this lunch for us, didn't I?

Asuka: This is slightly uncooked.

Haruka: It's al dente! It's supposed to be like that. If you have a problem, you make lunch!

Asuka: But Haruka, you made me a promise to do all the cooking at least until I finish my manuscript. Remember?

Haruka: I remember. Just stop your complaining.

Asuka: You don't know how hard it is for a single mother to raise a kid all on her own.

Haruka: Dad's paying you alimony and child support, isn't he?

Asuka: Look, hear you...

Haruka: It's no secret, Mother. You forget I'm gonna be in middle school next year, you know.

Asuka: Listen, Miss Know-It-All. Are you saying that mothers shouldn't work?! ―

Haruka: No, not I meant.

Asuka: ―That they should stay at home, cooking and cleaning?

Haruka: I just don't get why you spend all your time making comic books that don't sell.

Asuka: Please don't say that.

Haruka: Oh, no. I must've dozed off.
Yu! Have you been studying all this time? You're dedicated.

Yu: What are you doing here anyway?
Why were you waiting in front of the cram school?

Haruka: I was killing time.

Yu: You'll get into trouble walking around this time at night.

Haruka: If you're gonna worried about something like that, then you shouldn't be running away from home.

Yu: Were you the one who said that we should run away in the first place!? Just because you wanted to go to your dad's house in Tokyo...

Haruka: Yu? Wanna run away from home? Let's go to Tokyo together.
I was having a fight with my mom when I said that. My parents are divorced and it's kind of complicated. And I was really missing my father.

Yu: You're a liar. I was an idiot to listen to you.

Haruka: Yu? Would you wait just a second?

Yu: Just forget it. Go home!

Haruka: I'm not a liar. You need to have a plan before running away from home.

Yu: I know that. Even if I did run away, they'd just find me and then I'd be taken home. So, what's the point? Sometimes, I wish I could just run away. I'll never get out of this town. I'm gonna be here forever.

Haruka: But that's not true. Once you're an adult, you'll be able to go anywhere you want to.

Yu: I really wanna leave here. Why aren't I an adult?

Haruka: Yu?

Yu: I hate being a kid. I just wish I could get out of this stupid town.

Haruka: Yu?

Yu: I think... I think I'm going crazy.

Haruka: Yu?
That's strange. Blue snow?
It's him.

Karasu: Dragon Torque.

Haruka: He vanished.

Ai: Hey, did you hear?

Haruka: Hear what?

Ai: I got an e-mail from Saeko. She said that the other night a headless ghost appeared at the mall.

Haruka: Did you say "ghost"?

Ai: Yeah, and she said he was wearing a black cape.

Haruka: A black cape... Yeah, you know what, I've seen him too. And he was wearing a black cape.

Ai: Whaaat?! Wait! You're saying you saw a ghost too? Where was he?

Haruka: I don't know. Does it matter? Who cares?

Ai: I do! Now tell me where he was!

Kooriyama: Ah, excuse me, young ladies? Listen, you girls live around here about? Maybe you young ladies could do me a big favor? xxx I'm checking into. I'll make it worth your while, if you girls help me out. I'll get you some juice. Let it be canned though.

Ai: Ah, I totally forgot! We gotta go, Haruka!

Haruka: Huh? What is it, Ai?!

Kooriyama: Hey!
That was strange. I guess they don't like canned juice.

Ai: That guy was definitely a perv! Did you see the way he was looking at us? We should really call the police!

Haruka: Hey, don't worry. He acts suspicious, but he's really not like that.

Kooriyama: Hey, it's Kooriyama. So, how are you doing, Uchida? How are things going over there?

Uchida: It looks like the data analysis of the observation satellite is complete in Tokyo.

Kooriyama: And?

Uchida: And it's definite. They confirmed an irregularity.

Kooriyama: Looks like we're gonna be here for a while.

Uchida: Yeah, it looks like that way.

Kooriyama: What do we do now?

Uchida: I'm trying to figure that out right now while I'm on this mountain top.

Yu: I'm going to cram school.

Miyuki: All right. Be careful.

Isami: Hey, man... I know that the night of fright sounds kind of stupid, but it may not be so bad.

Yu: Isami, you're afraid, aren't you?

Isami: Don't be ridiculous.

Ai: Hey, look, who's here!

Haruka: Yeah, Yu came along.

Isami: I'm not sure this is really such a good idea, Bro.

Miho: I'm sure we'll see one tonight. I can tell. I'm getting an eerie feeling. Like right now, I can feel every pore in my skin opening up.

Isami: Ah, you know... The path is dangerous, so maybe we should go now?

Ai: What's the matter? Are you scared or something, Isami?

Isami: Me? No way. I'm not afraid.

Miho: C'mon, you guys. Let's go this way.

Isami: I bet that Miho...

Ai: ...probably doesn't even believe in ghosts. She's just doing this to scare us.

Miho: Hey everybody, what'cha doing? C'mon over here! Let's get this expedition started!

Haruka: What's the matter?

Ai: I thought I saw a light.

Isami: Hey, knock it off!

Miho: What's the matter?

Ai: I saw some kind of light over there!

Miho: What?! Oh, no way! I bet it's a flying ghost! A flying ghost is going through here!

Ai: It's a flying ghost?

Isami: That's impossible!

Miho: What's that? Huh? A flying ghost!

Isami: Man, we're busted.

Miho: Hey, what's going on?

Haruka: Mrs. Goto.

Miyuki: You should be at the cram school, doing your studies. I can't believe you do something like this.

Isami: Hey, wait a minute, Mrs. Goto!

Miyuki: This is what happens when you see these children!

Operator: Coordinate fix complete. Countdown.

Isami: That kinda took the fun out of it.

Miho: C'mon now! Don't be like that! If you wanna have any kind of encounter, you have to wish hard with all of your mind!

Isami: Wish hard? That's how you do it?

Miho: That's right. All right now, everybody wish! Yeah! Mr. Ghost, Mr. Ghost, please come out! Come out wherever you are!

Isami: I'm sure there has to be another way to do this.

Ai: Hey, are you worried about Yu?

Haruka: Huh? N-No, I was just thinking...

Ai: Oh, honestly! Haruka, your feelings are written all over your face.

Haruka: What?

Miyuki: The cram school called and they said you hadn't shown up yet. I was so humiliated. What were you doing out so late at night with those other kids? Haruka's mother let her be there, didn't she? She allows the girl to run around wild. [Her] mother is far too lenient.

Yu: I... I... I'm going... I'm going crazy!
Stop the car. Stop the car!

Haruka: Blue Snow? It's happening again.

Ai: What's the matter, Haruka?

Haruka: Just look at that. It's snow. Blue snow.

Ai: Huh? Blue snow?! Ah, quit it. There can't be snow in the middle of summer.

Haruka: Ai...

Isami: It's getting late. Haven't you had enough?

Miho: No! I'm not going home until I see one!

Isami: But I'm starving. I really think we should head back soon. Don't you?

Isami: Miho! I can't see! What's wrong with this? The battery's dead?

Miho: Isami, look over there!

Isami: Wh-What's that? It's a shadow. It's a shadow from a tree.

Ai: What's going on, Miho?

Miho: I see one!

Ai: Huh? See one what?

Isami: Don't [beat] my leg!

Haruka: What's the matter, Miho? Miho?

Ai: C'mon, run, Haruka!

Haruka: Huh?

Ai: Hurry!

Operator: One bird has disappeared. Seven birds remain.

Karazu: A reaction to the high-density Reizu.

Isami: Aren't ghosts supposed to be legless?! It's impossible! That thing couldn't be real!

Miho: That is definitely a ghost! We have seen a ghost tonight! Isn't that amazing?

Isami: Why are you so happy!

Haruka: Listen, that was not a ghost.

Ai: What?

Haruka: It's too strange.

Miho: But he can't help being strange! He is a ghost!

Haruka: It's coming this way!

Isami: What is it?

Haruka: We have to get away!

Ai: Haruka, what's wrong?!

Haruka: Hey, hurry guys, c'mon hurry!

Miho: Something is flying and it's coming right at us!

Isami: Impossible!

Haruka: Everybody, run for it! Hurry!

Karasu: Is that it?

Isami: This can't be happening!

Miho: Apparently it's a land-bound ghost!

Ai: I don't get it! What's happening!?

Haruka: He's after me. I've got to get him away from the others.
Stay back!

Ai: It's gone. It's not chasing us now.

Isami: Are you sure about that?

Miho: I wonder where it went?

Yu: Where's Haruka?!

Isami: Wait. I thought she was with us.

Haruka: Wait a sec. You look familiar. I know who you are. You are...

Yu: Haruka!

Haruka: Yu!

Yu: Who are you?! What do you want?! Answer me!

Karasu: I get it now. This dimension must be... I'm afraid you can't do it. You see, there is nothing at all you can do to protect the young lady.

Yu: Who are you?

Karasu: Can't you see? I'm you.

---------- <ED> ----------

Haruka: I'm dreaming again. That summer day's dream.

Kuina: Ah crap, my right arm didn't make it!

Haruka: What's happening?

Atori: You are very lucky.

Haruka: Next episode, Runaway.
Who are you?
