  Becky:
Well, that bell means class is over!
Good work today, you guys!

Miyako:
She could have at least finished what she was writing!

Rei:
Guess she must have wanted to get out of this room pretty bad.

Kurumi:
I can't believe she just left us here!

Sayaka:
More importantly, why was she teaching history during math class?

Himeko:
Maho...

Mesousa:
What should I do?

Ichijo:
It's alright!

Becky:
I almost forgot!
I'll be testing you all on this stuff tomorrow, so study up!

Miyako:
What?!
But why didn't you give us any warning about that?

Becky:
And remember, if you don't do well, you'll be forced to take after-school tutorials like a moron!

Miyako:
What? No! I can't do that!

Rei:
Study that?

OP

Miss Igarashi:
All right, there's going to be a test tomorrow, so study for it, everyone!

Yuzuko:
Ah, tests are so depressing...

Miss Igarashi:
Yeah, tell me about it, kid...

Yuma:
Ma'am.

Miss Igarashi:
Go ahead, Kashiwagi twin.

Yuma:
That isn't my name, Miss Igarashi. I'm Yuma!

Yuna:
And I'm the other one, Yuna Kashiwagi, ma'am.

Miss Igarashi:
What makes you think I get paid enough to tell you two apart?
Now do you have a question or what?

Yuna:
I think she was asking if you'll be taking the test.

Miss Igarashi:
What on earth would put that into your head?

Yuma:
You look kind of depressed, so I wondered if that's what you were worried about.

Yuzuko:
Ah, maybe she's going to menopause!

Miss Igarashi:
So anyway, pull an all-nighter or do whatever crazy thing you have to do to be prepared for the test tomorrow, okay?
However! If you don't feel well tomorrow, don't force yourself to come into school sick!
That understood?

Shu:
No! Again, no idea what you mean, ma'am!
Ow!

Miss Igarashi:
Momose, you have no idea how tedious it is to correct 37 tests, now do you?
I wish I was a cloud...

Shu:
That woman has gone out of her mind.

Kurumi:
Oh, what am I gonna do?
I wish she'd told us about that stupid test a little earlier!

Sayaka:
I didn't even think we were supposed to be taking notes on all that stuff.

Himeko:
Oh my God! I love taking tests, you guys!

Kurumi:
Are you serious?

Himeko:
Oh, yeah! I sleep like a baby, it's so quiet!

Kurumi, Sayaka:
Oh, she's a goner...

Ichijo:
Um, excuse me, Rei.
Could I talk to you outside for a moment?

Rei:
How come you're being so quite normal?
It's really freaking me out.

Ichijo:
Do you usually study a lot for these kinds of tests, Rei?

Rei:
I don't know that I study a lot. I just basically review stuff.

Ichijo:
I think I understand...

Rei:
Yeah, it's not that tricky.

Ichijo:
Stare...

Rei:
Huh?

Ichijo:
So your glasses are your secret weapon then.

Rei:
My glasses have nothing to do with it.

Miyako:
She should have said that she was gonna give us a stupid test!
Argh, I don't even know what I should start going over first!

Himeko:
Hey, you like little animals, right?

Miyako:
Why are you asking me that? We're having a test tomorrow!
You should be studying instead of asking stupid questions!

Himeko:
So, you do like animals or you don't?

Miyako:
Pay attention when I talk to you!

Himeko:
Maho?

Miyako:
Aargh. Fine, whatever. I like animals, okay?

Himeko:
Maho?
Good, 'cause I really like 'em, too!
But, I think I like eating them better!

Miyako:
Please! For the love of God, just let me study!
Can somebody please get her away from me?!

Himeko:
I bet Rei isn't even gonna pass this test.

Rei:
If I end up scoring in the bottom ten, I swear I'm gonna pull your cowlick out.

Himeko:
Eh?....
Maaahooo!

Rei:
Works every single time.

Mesousa:
Mind if I ask you a question if you have time for a small sad bunny?

Rei:
What's up?

Mesousa:
Do you know if I would have to take this test, too?

Rei:
Hmm, you know, I don't think you would.
Wait, so he wanted to take the test?

Ichijo:
Excuse me, can I have a moment of your time?

Mesousa:
Yes?

Ichijo:
I was thinking that you might be lonely while we're busy with our test.
That made me sad, so I...
I made a little friend for you.
Please feel free to play with him whenever you're feeling lonely.

Mesousa:
Something's dripping from it's mouth...

Sayaka:
This must be the most depressing news of the year...

Rei:
Right. Then, let's go do something fun.
Hey, Miyako, did you know that Becky's not really a teacher, and this whole test thing is a prank?

Miyako:
What?! Really?!
That little impostor can go to hell!!!!

Rei:
You gotta admit, that was pretty fun, right?

Sayaka:
Yeah... fun...

Alien Captain:
And now, for the proficiency test, engage!

Alien:
Why are you testing this all of a sudden, Alien Captain?

Alien Captain:
I'm just as surprised as you are.

Alien:
But you're the one who's doing it!

Alien Captain:
You want a piece of me?!
Look, a proficiency test can only give me a true measure of your abilities if it comes when it's least expected.
Letting you know ahead of time will only cause measurement errors!

Alien:
My apologies, sir! I didn't mean to question your motivations.
Please forgive me!

Alien Captain:
That's right!
It's not like I was just giving you this test on a whim or anything...

Alien:
So it was just a whim, huh?
Alien Captain, you said this test will measure our proficiency, but our proficiency in what exactly?

Alien Captain:
Oh, everyone has different abilities.
I want you to show off that individuality you all cultivated through your cram-free education!

Alien:
What individuality?
I mean, I don't look that much different from you, or this green-eyed guy over here.
We even sound the same!

Alien Captain:
Well, I suppose... it could be your...
Y-Your naturally cheerful character.

Alien:
My naturally cheerful character?

Alien Captain:
That's right, the objective of this proficiency test is to measure your cheerfulness with this wiggly stick thing here!

Alien:
Yes, sir!
How do you measure that?

Sayaka:
So we're supposed to take this huge test tomorrow, but I don't even know where to begin to start getting ready for it.

Kurumi:
Maybe you don't know where to begin because you don't study on a daily basis.

Sayaka:
So does that mean you have a starting point planned?

Kurumi:
Uh-huh.

Rei:
For something like that, don't you think it's a better idea to ask someone who actually studies on a regular basis?

Miyako:
What do you want?

Sayaka:
Miyako, please! You gotta teach me how to study!

Kurumi:
Teach me, too!

Miyako:
Couldn't you have asked me that before today?

Ichijo:
If everybody wants to ask her the same thing,
why don't we all just go over to her house after school tonight and have her teach us everything she knows about studying?

Kurumi:
I'm in!

Sayaka:
Me too!

Himeko:
Sleepover? Ooh!

Miyako:
My house isn't big enough for a sleepover with this many people!

Rei:
Besides, Becky said not to invite ourselves over to Miyako's.

Everyone:
Really?

Rei:
Yeah, she said just because Miyako's a bookworm doesn't mean she is the smartest person in class.

Miyako:
I hope you die, you miserable bitch!!!!

Rei:
You see? It never stops being fun.

Sayaka:
Uh, yeah...

Becky:
How come you guys haven't gone home yet?

Miyako:
Why do you care, you jerk!

Rei:
It's all right, you can come out.

Kurumi:
We're not mad at you.

Becky:
Study session?

Rei:
We're gonna spend a night at Miyako's and study for the test.

Becky:
I really admire your work ethic.
Keep studying hard like that and you'll get to be like me when you grow up.

Rei:
Uh, I understand what you're trying to convey, but...

Kurumi:
We're already more grown up than she is.

Becky:
Look, my point is that you're obviously willing to learn and I have great respect for that.
Hey, go get my overnight bag for me, Mesousa!

Himeko:
Maho? Becky's gonna spend the night with us?

Becky:
I don't think it's a good idea for students to have unsupervised sleepovers, so I'm coming as your chaperon.

Sayaka:
Our chaperon's a little...

Kurumi:
She's way younger than us.

Himeko:
What's a chaperon?

Becky:
If you've got something to say, just spit it out.

Ichijo:
Are you sure you wanna hear it?

Becky:
Um, I wasn't talking to you, crazy.

Himeko:
Why don't we all go home now, grab our overnight bags and then we'll totally meet up later?!

Miyako:
Look, we can't all stay in my house.

Ichijo:
I think I know a place where everyone could stay.
I asked if they would let us borrow their club room.

Rei:
The lodge club? What kinda place is this?

Ichijo:
I think it's a lodge.

Kurumi:
Whoa! Check out the tatami mat!

Himeko:
It's like an old-school Japanese inn!

Sayaka:
I put some hot water in the pot.

Rei:
Ah, I've never been so relaxed.

Kurumi:
It's nice to be pampered like this every now and again.

Himeko:
Maho...

Becky:
Hey, this yukata robe is way too big for me!

Rei:
No, you're just too small.

Ichijo:
She's got a point.

Becky:
Don't you dare say I'm too small!

Yuma:
I figured something like this might happen.
So I brought a special one just for you!

Kurumi:
It's so cute!

Yuzuko:
That's a costumer for you!

Yuma:
I like to stay on top of these things.

Becky:
What are you doing here? You're not even from class 1-C!

Yuzuko:
We thought this sounded like fun!

Yuma:
And sleepovers are always better when there are a ton of people.

Miyako:
This isn't a slumber party!
This is a study session, so study!

Yuma:
But you're wearing a yukata.

Yuna:
She's right.

Yuzuko:
And it's not very flattering.

Everyone:
Yes?

Yuzuko:
Hey, it's Momose!

Shu:
Uh, I was just looking for my sister.

Kurumi:
I'm over here, Shu!

Shu:
So are you gonna spend a night here?

Kurumi:
Yep.

Shu:
Mom wants me to find out about what you're going to do about eating dinner.

Kurumi:
Tell her you're gonna make us something to eat and deliver it, so she doesn't have to worry.

Shu:
What?

Kurumi:
Don't make me wait, Manager.

Rei:
The A/C is on a little hard.

Yuma:
Do you know when our dinner will be ready, Manager?

Everyone:
Manager! Manager! Manager!

Becky:
And Manager, run me a bath!

Shu:
Uh... do what?

Mesousa:
It's all right. I know exactly how you must be feeling.

Shu:
Um, did I just get soothed by a bunny?

Miyako:
Why is everybody wearing their pajamas?!

Yuzuko:
Because they told us that you're having a sleepover.

Yuma:
I brought my hottest lingerie to sleep in for this party.

Yuna:
Oh, Yuma, you're so daring!

Kurumi:
That's sexy!

Rei:
I was going for comfort but whatever.

Ichijo:
Why are you wearing your P.E. uniform?

Sayaka:
I sort of forgot to pack my pajamas.

Himeko:
It's a slumber party!

Miyako:
We're supposed to be studying!

Becky:
What, you can't study if you're wearing your pajamas?
You must have a concentration problem if you get all worried about that stupid stuff.

Kurumi:
Becky, you're so grown-up!

Miyako:
She's a little kid!

Himeko:
Can I ask what you're writing there, Becky?

Becky:
Just an article I'm writing for a conference.

Himeko:
Hey, I wanna see it!

Becky:
No, go away! I'm not finished!

Sayaka:
Oh, look, the whole paper is in English!

Rei:
I guess seeing a foreign language turned out to be too much for Himeko's little brain.

Becky:
Hey, while you're out there, could you get me something to drink, huh?
Is something wrong?

Mesousa:
Actually, they may not be very cold, so I'd rather not get them from this machine...

Becky:
Huh?

Mesousa:
Oh... I'll get you a soda some place else.
I thought I saw a convenience store.

Lord Cat:
He isn't going to come, is he?

Himeko:
Maho... Man, I could go to sleep right now...

Yuzuko:
But we just opened our books two minutes ago, Himeko.

Kurumi:
Listen, this is just how she is.
I guess you wouldn't know since you're in class 1-A.

Yuzuko:
Oh, I wouldn't say that. She's pretty famous.

Everyone:
She's a moron and everybody knows it.

Himeko:
Maho...

Rei:
Maybe it's because you think of it as studying.
Think of it as manga.

Himeko:
Manga?

Rei:
Like Ieyasu [censored]ku from [censored] Ball and he's got to save the world.

Ieyasu:
Sup? I'm Ieyasu!
I'll show you the super power of the people of Mikawa!

Himeko:
Show me! I can't wait to learn more about you!

Becky:
I'm glad she's studying, but I'll bet she's gonna learn it all wrong.

Kurumi:
So, um, who do you think is gonna be this manganese dioxide?

Rei:
That'll be Ya[censored]cha.

Himeko:
Oh, maho. I totally love Ya[censored]cha!

Miyako:
Is there something wrong, Ichijo?

Ichijo:
You're wearing glasses...

Miyako:
Oh, these?
I guess I do wear my contacts most days.

Ichijo:
Then why did you decide to wear glasses today?

Miyako:
Well, when I'm going to stay up late at night studying for a test, the glasses are easier on my eyes.

Ichijo:
Oh... The secret is in the glasses...

Mesousa:
Uh, excuse me, I think I'd like a soda, please.
It's still warm. How comforting... Huh?
Live bait?!

Kurumi:
Okay! Check it out, guys!
I made us some special victory pencils!

Miyako:
Why would you waste your time doing something stupid like that?

Becky:
I swear it's like she wants me to fail her.

Kurumi:
Don't be so naive! These aren't just ordinary pencils!
Look! It's double ones! It's double ones! It's double ones!

Everyone:
How the heck did you do that?

Kurumi:
I'm glad you asked.
I put a little lead on the other end so you only get ones.
With these pencils in your pocket, you just can't lose!

Becky:
How dishonest...

Rei:
You're telling me.

Miyako:
I don't see how those will be able to help you on the test.

Ichijo:
Maybe if you could write the answers really tiny on the inside of them...

Kurumi:
Yeah! They never suspect you of cheating that way!

Becky:
You guys haven't forgotten your teacher's sitting in the room with you?

Kurumi:
It's so skinny. Could you write everything you need to know in there?

Ichijo:
You could roll this up and put it in the center where the lead is.

Sayaka:
That's brilliant!

Yuzuko:
That way, you don't have to write so small!

Rei:
Don't you think the teacher will notice you open your pencil during the test?

Miyako:
You would so get caught.

Becky:
Especially since I know what you're planning to do.

Yuma:
Can I ask something?

Rei:
Go ahead, Kashiwagi twins.

Yuma:
My name's not "twins"! It's "Yuma"!

Rei:
Do you honestly expect me to tell you two apart?

Yuzuko:
That's exactly what Miss Igarashi said to them!

Yuna:
We think it's a good idea to have that little cheating paper.

Becky:
I know what you're planning to do!

Yuna:
But none of us have any idea what's gonna be on the test.

Kurumi:
Becky, you gotta tell me what's gonna be on this test!

Becky:
Then what's the point of testing you?!

Kurumi:
You're so mean!
You already told us during class, so why not tell us again?!

Becky:
I never told you exactly what was going to be on the test during class! And I'm not gonna tell you now!

Yuma:
You know what?
We need to use the fact that no one can tell us apart to our advantage.

Yuna:
How do you think we could do that, Yuma?

Yuma:
We'll tag team it.
So, I only take the section of the test that I'm good at, and you only take the section that you're good at.
Since Miss Igarashi can't tell us apart, she'll never know.

Yuna:
So are there any subjects that you're really good at?

Rei:
You do realize that both of you will be in the same classroom, right?

Mesousa:
Sounds like they've been having fun since I was gone...

Kurumi:
I want some potato chips!

Yuzuko:
Hey, we've got chocolate eggs!
Did you know they've got ones shaped like animals now?
Wow, that sure is colorful!

Becky:
I think it's supposed to be a Brazilian Horned Frog.

Rei:
Wow.

Becky:
Did you know that all these toys are painted in China?

Kurumi:
Really?

Becky:
Yah. They've got people there who are so good with their hands they can write poetry on a grain of rice.

Himeko:
So Chinese people are the ones who paint Brazilian Horned Frogs, huh?
Maho...

Becky:
I don't think that's exactly how it is...

Kurumi:
Maybe we could get a Chinese person to write the answers inside my pencil!

Rei:
Then why don't you go to China?

Sayaka:
Which animal do you want, Miss Ichijo?

Ichijo:
I don't want one, thank you.

Sayaka:
Why not? They're really adorable.

Ichijo:
The factory just started making them, so they're not as cute as they could be yet.

Sayaka:
Maniac!

Himeko:
Mahomahomahomahomaho...

Rei:
You're gonna get fat if you keep eating like that.

Himeko:
Actually, I never gain or lose weight no matter how many snacks I eat!
You want some Pocky too, Rei?

Rei:
No, thank you.

Miyako:
I hope you turn into a pig!

Rei:
I think I'll have another soda.

Mesousa:
No! That's...
That's warm from body heat...

Shu:
Hey, the bath is ready now, girls!

Himeko:
Mahoron!
Huh? Looks like it's about 75% humidity.

Miyako:
So that's an antenna after all?

Rei:
What are you staring at me for, Kurumi?

Kurumi:
I wanna know how you made your boobs so big.

Rei:
It was a lot of hard work.

Ichijo:
So the secret is in the glasses.

Yuzuko:
Hey, there's a sauna room.
Should I go in? I think I wanna go in! I think I do!

Miyako:
But if you go in there now, you'll be way too tired to study later!

Yuzuko:
Hmm... I wanna make my waist area a little smaller, though...

Himeko:
Maho.

Rei:
So Miyako, I thought you said this is gonna make you too tired to study.

Miyako:
I can take care of myself, thanks!

Becky:
So hot! I'm dying!

Himeko:
You just came in, you can't leave!

Becky:
Shut up! I'm too hot! Let me go now!

Rei:
I guess saunas aren't for little kids, huh?

Becky:
I can't take it anymore!

Kurumi:
Rei, how'd you get to be round in all the right places and flat in all the right places?

Rei:
I already told you, it's lots and lots of hard work.
Miyako, maybe you should get back in the bath.

Miyako:
I'll get out of here in a second.
I ate too many snacks earlier, so I need to...
Hey, Himeko, if you never gain or lose weight no matter what, then why are you here?

Himeko:
Maho...
Muho...

Miyako:
They don't have to lose any more weight, so why don't they just leave?
It's like they're conspiring against me to make sure that I'll always be chunkier than they are, that's annoying me!

Ichijo:
Miyako, you don't look so good.
I think you should get out of the sauna now.

Miyako:
No fair!

Becky:
Ah, this is the life, I tell you what...

Kurumi:
Whoa, Miyako, you're really heavy.

Miyako:
If you ever do that to me again, I swear I'll cut your freaking eye out!

Himeko:
I always want a cold glass of milk after a hot bath, don't you?

Rei:
I guess we should have brought some with us.

Mesousa:
Can I have some milk, please?

Lord Cat:
You may, meow.

Mesousa:
"Meow"?

Lord Cat:
The secret is my body heat, meow.
That milk has been freshly drawn, meow.

Mesousa:
From what?

Miyako:
Why are you setting beds out already?!

Himeko:
Mahoho! Mahoho! Mahoho!

Kurumi:
Oh, I forgot something.

Becky:
What's the matter, Kurumi?

Kurumi:
I can never get to sleep unless I use my own pillow.
I should've thought to bring it with me when I packed my bag...

Rei:
I forgot something at home, too.
I can't get to sleep unless I have my favorite stuffed animal with me.

Becky:
Stuffed animal?

Himeko:
Maho! You can hold me instead!
Maho!

Rei:
I tend to crash around in my sleep a lot, so unless I have something soft to hold on to, I end up breaking stuff around me.

Himeko:
Something soft?

Rei:
And sometimes when I wake up, my stuffed animal is missing an ear or something.

Himeko:
NOOOOOOO!

Becky:
You sleep over there, Rei!

Kurumi:
Okay, I don't want you anywhere near me.

Rei:
Fine. Whatever you say.

Ichijo:
But Rei, you should be okay if you have a substitute stuffed animal, right?

Rei:
Yeah.

Ichijo:
It doesn't matter what it is as long as it's soft?

Rei:
Yeah.

Ichijo:
Even, say, if it was a bunny?

Rei:
Yeah.

Mesousa:
It's okay. It's not like I have any objection to the idea...

Miyako:
Whatever happened to studying?

Miyako:
Oh no...

Mesousa:
Good morning. You sleep well?

Miyako:
My God, we didn't study at all!
I can't believe you guys are gonna maybe fail this test!

Rei:
Ah, I slept great!

Himeko:
Good morning, you guys.

Kurumi:
I guess the sauna really was a bad idea, huh?

Miyako:
What are we gonna do if we fail?!

Ichijo:
Don't worry about that. I brought glasses.

Miyako:
What are you talking about?!
What are you wearing those for?!

Becky:
Well, best of luck on the test, everybody.

ED

Becky:
I'll bet I'd never be late for work again if I just stayed here.
I wonder if I should rent a room.

MONSTERS!

Mesousa:
Oh, hello. This is Mesousa.
Hope you don't mind hearing from me.
Um, yesterday I found a button battery that wasn't leaking.
Please stick around for the next episode.
Good night, everyone.
