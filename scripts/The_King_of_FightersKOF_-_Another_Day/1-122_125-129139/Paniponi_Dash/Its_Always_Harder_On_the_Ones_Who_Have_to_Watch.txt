  Hibiki:
Rebecca Miyamoto...American father, Japanese mother, graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
when she was only ten years old.
For some reason she returned to Japan to teach at the Momotsuki Academy.
Very suspicious!
On behalf of the Intelligence Department of the Student Council, I, Hibiki Watanuki of Class 1-B shall reveal your secret!
What in the...?
It's hideous. There is not a minute to lose.
All right!!

OP

Kurumi:
You mean Becky is not here yet?

No.6:
I wonder if something happened to her.

Miyako:
I bet she overslept. She's not fit to be a teacher!

Himeko:
Ma~maho~maho~maho~maho~...maho?

Miyako:
Do you want me to kill you?

Hibiki:
Late, huh? You've got some nerve Rebe...Ah!
Can't breathe.

Rei:
What an idiot.

Himeko:
Oh you guys I hope Becky gets here soon, I'm so totally bored.

Rei:
Glasses? Where're my glasses?

Himeko:
Maho? What are you doing down there, Rei?

Ichijo:
I wonder, are these your glasses?

Rei:
Oh, thank you, Ichijo.

Ichijo:
If your life is the most important thing, then that makes your glasses the seventh.

Rei:
Ah...Could you stop talking to me?

Himeko:
Ah! I want Becky! I want Becky! I want her now!

Rei:
This stupid cowlick!
I'm pulling it out!

Himeko:
Maho! Maho! Maho! Maho! Maho! Maho! Maho~!

Rei:
Wha...What in the hell just happened here?
Or do I even wanna know?

Himeko:
Mahoron...

Saotome:
Well, those are all the announcements I've got here.
Shiratori! If you have to yawn, the least you could do is cover your mouth.

Otome:
Pointless to talk to her when she's sleeping.

Saotome:
Akiyama! For the last time, it's Mr. Saotome.

Suzune:
I'm sorry, but I can't eat any more short rib.

Saotome:
Listen you! This is not a Korean barbecue place!

Otome:
She told me that she only got twelve and a half hours of sleep last night.

Satome:
Only twelve and a half hours, huh?
Hey! Does anyone know if Watanuki's here today or not?

Otome:
Yah, she's in her seat.

Hibiki:
It's getting really hard to breathe here.

Becky:
Morning...

Hibiki:
It's Rebecca Miyamoto! Woooo!

Becky:
Sorry I'm so late everyone.

Himeko:
All right! Becky is back! Yay!

Kurumi:
You don't look like you normally do. Is there something wrong?

Becky:
No, everything is fine.

Rei:
How come you're wearing a hat?

Becky:
This thing...it's just...Ah!

Himeko:
Hey!

Miyako:
A cowlick!

Kurumi:
Everyone, look at her hair!

Becky:
I'm your teacher, you got that? You fat jerkfaces!

Miyako:
Here we go again.
I guess that's the reason she was late then, huh?

Rei:
I can kinda see where she's coming from, but still, this is kind of extreme.

Kurumi:
That is some bad bed hair.

No.6:
That could win the bad bed hair of the year award.

Himeko:
Oh my god! Becky!
Isn't it like so great that we match? I'm so omega-excited!

Becky:
No!

Hibiki:
So you're trying to make your students think you're one of them, is that it?!

Himeko:
Oh! My Becky!

Becky:
Let me go! You can't treat your teacher like that!

Himeko:
But all I wanna do is give you a squeeze.
Maho! Maho!

Rei:
No Becky! Don't be a fool.

Himeko:
Maho! Maho!

Hibiki:
What's happening?

Becky:
Hey! Himeko!
Himeko, pull yourself together!

Himeko:
Hey there, little kid teacher.

Becky:
Get away from me.

Mesousa:
She left home without me...

God:
You're late today, meow.

Mesousa:
Could you repeat that, please?

God:
You're late today, meow.

Mesousa:
Oh, I'm sorry. But I'm not a student or teacher here so...

God:
Are you ready for your punishment, meow?

Mesousa:
Say what?

God:
Well I am God, you know?

Becky:
So I'm gonna be holding on to this cowlick for a while.
Is that understood?

Himeko:
Maho...

Miyako:
Why the heck would she wanna confiscate a cowlick?

Rei:
You should be asking why wouldn't she take it from her.

Miyako:
What kind of answer is that?

Becky:
And I guess that's it for class today.

Saotome:
A cowlick, huh?

Becky:
How much will you give me for it?

Saotome:
I don't want this thing.

Geezer:
I'll give you 157 cruzado.

Becky:
I don't know how much that's worth.

Igarashi:
Have you two ever heard that you're not supposed to have your appendix removed?

Saotome:
Yeah, I think I heard that.
Doctors used to think it was just kind of extra.
But now the medical standpoint is it's in our bodies for a reason, so there must be some purpose for it.

Igarashi:
Right! So it could cause a lot of problems for you if you remove it without knowing what it's there to do.

Becky:
Uh, are you guys trying to say something about the cowlick?

Igarashi:
Have you noticed any problems with Katagiri yet?

Becky:
But it's only a chunk of hair.

Igarashi:
True enough.

Becky:
Um, Miss Igarashi?

Igarashi:
Yes?

Becky:
I appreciate your fixing my bed hair and all.
But if you could step away from me now, that'd be great.

Igarashi:
Any reason?

Becky:
Your breath smells like alcohol.

Igarashi:
Sorry, my bad.
Oh, and you're still underage, aren't you?

Becky:
I honestly don't think my age is really pertinent to this discussion.

Saotome:
You were out drinking again last night, huh?

Igarashi:
No, actually it was this morning.
Nothing wakes me up in the morning like that sake made in Nada.
You should really try it someday, Saotome.

Saotome:
If it's OK with you, I think I'm gonna pass on the cowlick today.

Becky:
Oh, then would you put it back in my desk please?

Geezer:
I'll give you 400,000 pesetas.

Becky:
Get out of here! Geezer!

Alien crew:
Transport was successful, Alien captain.

Alien captain:
Good.

Alien crew:
But what do you hope to find by investigating this?
It has nothing to do with Miss Miyamoto.

Alien captain:
You fool!
Sure our test object is Miss Miyamoto.
But our objective is to do biological research on the Earthlings.
And if there is a possibility that we could discover new facts about these creatures, it is our duty to do that!

Alien crew:
So, we're just killing time, is that it?

Alien captain:
Sure, you could put it that way.

Alien crew:
It looks like we failed to complete the transport.
What should we do now!?

Alien captain:
Let's pretend none of this ever happened.

Becky:
So, you basically get a paycheck for doing nothing but watching high school girls run around in gym shorts all day, huh?
Hooray for P.E. teachers!

Saotome:
Ah, Miss Miyamoto, I'm gonna have to ask you to stop making comments that could confuse my students.

Becky:
Just saying what everyone else in this school is thinking, buddy.

Saotome:
I understand you got a free period right now, but that doesn't mean you can come out here and bother me.

Becky:
Fine.

Himeko:
Maho...

Miyako:
Oh, dear God! Will you quit playing around, Himeko?

Himeko:
Maho...

Saotome:
Come on! No lying down! Get up!

Becky:
Himeko...

Becky:
It probably doesn't have anything to do with her cowlick, but I guess I should give it back just to be safe.
What the...

Saotome:
Huh? I put it back like you asked me to.

Becky:
But it's not in my desk.

Saotome:
Well, what do you want me to do about it?

Becky:
Look, P.E. teacher, you sure you put it back?

Saotome:
I stuck it in your drawer before I came out here.
Come on! Show me some hustle!

Becky:
Then that must mean... I lost it?!
I can't believe I lost it... I can't believe I lost it...

Kurumi:
Looks like Becky's back out here again.

Rei:
She looks like she's suicidal.

No. 6:
Her hair doesn't look crazy anymore though.

Saotome:
Come on, girls! Get the lead out!

Miyako:
Stop yelling at us, big mouth!

Saotome:
Katagiri! You'd better get your act together!

Himeko:
Ma... ho...
Ma... ho... Ma... ho...

Becky:
I think it might have something to do with her cowlick.

Hibiki:
Oh god, I think I'm stuck!

Ichijo:
My name is Ichijo, I'm the class rep.

Hibiki:
Oh Ichijo! So glad to see you!
Can you help me out from under here?

Ichijo:
Here you go.

Hibiki:
What's that?

Ichijo:
A picker-upper!

Himeko:
She's so cute!
If you come to my house after school today, I promise I'll give you some candy!

Becky:
Go to the nurse.

Himeko:
She's even super omega-cute when she's mad at me!

Becky:
Shut up, you omega-idiot!

Rei:
Now now, don't get upset.

No. 6:
That's right, you should be happy, Miss Miyamoto.
Because it looks like Himeko's back to normal again.

Becky:
Well, yeah, I guess so, but still...

Himeko:
Oh, you look so totally adorable eating your udon!
I think I'm gonna eat some too now!

No. 6:
I guess an imitation cowlick will never be as good as the real thing.

Rei:
Why in the world did she decide to pull it out?

Himeko:
Maho...

Rei:
Hey Becky, why don't you just give her back the cowlick?

(Gulp!)

No. 6, Rei:
Did you just gulp?

Becky:
I'm done with my lunch.

Rei:
Wait a sec.

Becky:
Look, I haven't lost this stupid thing, alright?
I can give it back to her anytime!

Rei:
So you really did lose it.
Tell the truth.

Becky:
I'm sorry...

Miyako:
"At this rate the human race will perish," thought Lieutenant Meringue.
At that moment, he made the agonizing decision to postpone his family's vacation which had been scheduled for that weekend.
He figured it would be an easy enough thing to reschedule even though he'd already bought his airline tickets and...

Kurumi:
Are you serious?
You mean Becky really lost the cowlick?

Rei:
That's what she said.

Kurumi:
Himeko, what's she gonna do?

Himeko:
Maho...

Miyako:
We are in the middle of class!
At least pretend to pay attention!

Rei:
She told us she tore the teachers' lounge apart, but she couldn't find it anywhere.

Miyako:
Didn't you hear what I said?

Kurumi:
So where's Becky now?

Miyako:
Please sir! Can you ask them to pay attention to me when I read?
He fell asleep on me?

Old Geezer:
The umpire wasn't looking!

Score! We're going into extra innings.

Miyako:
What are you talking about?!

Kurumi:
And then?

Rei:
I believe Becky's using her skills as a child prodigy to solve this problem.

Becky:
Now if I can connect the hair roots I've gathered from her gym clothes, I should be able to...

Saotome:
Come on! I wanna see some hustle, girls!
Isn't running the greatest thing in the world?!

Otome:
It sucks that he expects all of us to run like we're freaking turtles!

Suzune:
You're such a fast runner, Otome.
You're good at every sport you try and you're tiny and cute to boot.

Otome:
That doesn't have anything to do with anything!
Hey, quit poking my head like that!

Suzune:
I'm just hitting one of your pressure points.

Otome:
Which one? What for?

Suzune:
The one that keeps you from growing.

Otome:
It whaaat?!

Mesousa:
Almost there...
Don't worry, you can pick it up.
Hooray!

Guess it wasn't meant to be...

Becky:
Alright! I did it!

Otome:
You're the teacher here, so make her stop!

Saotome:
Butch it up. She was only joking around with you.

Otome:
What are you gonna do if I really stop growing because of her?

Suzune:
Hello.
Now where were we?

Otome:
You'd better quit that right now!

Suzune:
Aw, come on. Don't be that way.

Otome:
Hey Saotome, help me!

Saotome:
That's Mr. Saotome to you, Akiyama.

Otome:
Who cares? Just give me a hand here, please!

Saotome:
Say mister.

Otome:
Make her quit!

Saotome:
Say mister.

Otome:
Make her quit!

Suzune:
You stay nice and teeny, you hear me, little cupcake?

Otome:
Saotome!

Saotome:
All right, Akiyama, how about I don't help you, but I tell you a little secret?
The pressure point that Shiratori is pushing isn't the one that keeps you from growing.

Otome:
Are you serious?

Suzune:
You're kidding, right?

Otome:
Oh, thank lord!

Saotome:
That one gives you diarrhea!

Otome:
Diarrhea?

Yankee:
I hate going to P.E..

Mesousa:
Oh. Well, if you don't like it, I don't see the point in going and making yourself miserable.

Yankee:
But skipping classes is so bad.

Mesousa:
What?

Yankee:
Skipping is bad.com!

Mesousa:
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
You're right, I don't know what I was talking about!

Yankee:
Do you like P.E.?

Mesousa:
Huh? Oh, are you talking to me?
Actually, I'm not very athletic at all.

Yankee:
That's no good.
You need to exercise more.

Mesousa:
You're right! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

Becky:
Hey, Yankee!
Can I get that thing back for a second?

Yankee:
Is that Miss Miyamoto.com?

Becky:
Are you gonna let me have him or not?

Yankee:
Sure!

Mesousa:
You're my hero.

Becky:
Thanks a lot!
I'll be sure to bring him back when I'm done!

Yankee:
Sweet!

Suzune:
Are you all right in there, Otome?

Becky:
All right. We might as well start.

Everyone:
Mm-hm.

Miyako:
So that's the artificial cowlick?

No. 6:
It looks just like the real one.

Mesousa:
Why are you experimenting on me?

Becky:
Because it would be awful if we put this thing on Himeko and something went wrong.

Mesousa:
What about me?

Becky:
Just stay still!

Miyako:
I sure do hope that thing works.

Rei:
Seems like a one-in-a-million shot to me.
But I guess it's worth the try.

Becky:
Steady now... Gently...

Kurumi:
She's got it!

Mesousa:
So was the operation a success?

What? What's going on?

Becky:
Run!

Mesousa:
Hey! What's everybody running away from?
Come back here! Take me with you plea-

Becky:
Take 2.

Mesousa:
You mean you're trying another one?

Well, how is it this time?

Miyako:
Nothing's happening.

Kurumi:
Becky, does that mean it's working?

Becky:
I guess...

Mesousa:
This is the last one you have to try?
I don't think I've ever been so happy!

They're trying to kill me...

Becky:
Let's try this again.

Mesousa:
Knock yourself out.

Cowlick Fairy:
I'm the magical cowlick fairy!

Mesousa:
It's always something, isn't it?

Becky:
I just don't get it.
What have I been doing wrong with all of my cowlicks so far?

Miyako:
Well, I guess that even a genius has limits.

Rei:
Yeah, but it's still fun and pretty cool to watch her experiments.

Mesousa:
That's not the real problem here...

Becky:
It doesn't make any sense!
There has to be some reason this isn't working!
I guess, I've gotta go back to the drawing board.

Kurumi:
You're sure a hard worker, aren't you?

No. 6:
But I guess that's how you got to be a genius.

Becky:
Huh? What's this?

Rei:
What was Himeko's name doing on Ichijo's shirt?

Miyako:
So you've been using the class rep's clothes?

No. 6:
Then that must mean the hair you used for the tests was...

Ichijo:
It's almost certain that the hair you used belonged to me.

Rei, Miyako:
I think we got it.

Becky:
That's why it wasn't working!

Ichijo:
Give me five.

Zula:
It's the next day! Yeah!

Himeko:
I totally love crabs, too!
You slip it out of the shell and then you dip it in this... hmmm, so good!

Becky:
Hey, Himeko...

Himeko:
Oh my God, talking about food makes me hungry.
Hungry for crabs!

Becky:
Will you please be quiet, Himeko?

Himeko:
Oh, and Rei?
Remember when you told me you saw a UFO the other day?
Well, I totally heard that was a lie.
That makes you a lair!
Ever noticed how "liar" and "lighter" kinda sound alike?
You're a lighter, Rei!

Rei:
Is that supposed to be a joke?

Miyako:
For God's sake, will you please stop talking?

Himeko:
Miyako, has anyone ever told you that your ears get all red when you're angry?
It's adorable!

Kurumi:
She's such a blabbermouth.

Miyako:
Hey, Becky, that new cowlick you gave her is a piece of junk.

Rei:
She's way worse than we was before.

Becky:
Yeah, I know.

Himeko:
How about I told you I totally love my new cowlick?
So good to be back to normal!
Thanks a lot, Becky! I love you!

Becky:
Why don't you go annoy someone else, you crazy freak!

Miyako:
Becky!

Rei:
Hey, I think she might be hurt.

Himeko:
Maho! Oh my God, I'm so sorry!

Otome:
Oww... I'm gonna die...
Huh? Is something wrong, sir?

Old Geezer:
I work very well on stomachaches.
You should take me.

Otome:
NOOOOOOOOOOO!

Ichijo:
Hi, I'm Ichijo, the class representative.
Today, I'd like to talk about the ambition of the shoulder blade.
Oh, we don't have time? I have to go save the world.
This has been Ichijo the class rep.
Good night.
