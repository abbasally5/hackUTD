Narrator:
Rebecca Miyamoto, born of an American father and a Japanese mother.
Graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The youngest graduate in the school's history.
She then returned to Japan to become a high school teacher.
However she was only ten years old at the time.

Becky:
I need some tissues.

Akira:
And so the little match girl went beyond time and space using her characteristic powers of love.

Old geezer:
All right, you can stop right there.
Take your seat, Miss Miyata.
Oh, be careful there.

Akira:
Yes sir.

Old geezer:
And let's see... Serizawa, read the rest of it.

Akane:
Yes sir.
Oh! Where am I, and who am I?
I can't seem to remember anything at all.
And why...Why am I holding a match?

Old geezer:
Serizawa.

Akane:
Yes sir.

Old geezer:
Read like a normal person.

Akane:
But I thought I was, sir.

Old geezer:
You know sea lions are generally predatory animals.

Akane:
Okay, okay! I'll change.
Heh heh heh heh...

Old geezer:
And you over there, the girl who's been sleeping, wake up!

Behoimi:
You can call me Behoimi, sir!
I'm all about love, compassion and justice. A magical girl who's always new and fresh.

Old geezer:
Jesus, isn't there anyone normal in this class?

Inugami:
Look who's talking.

Becky:
So, there you go.
That's your assignment.

Kurumi:
Oh my god!

Rei:
Looks like she really is a genius.

Himeko:
Becky, your outfit is super omega cute.

Becky:
You think I'm an idiot, don't you?

Kurumi:
Of course we don't.
We totally respect you.

Becky:
You do, huh?

No.6:
Oh! Miss Miyamoto, I heard you won the respect of the year prize.

Becky:
Is that some kind of a joke? Well, ribbon head?

No.6:
Huh...

Becky:
Let's move on to the next formula.
Do you think you're up to solving this one, Book worm?

Miyako:
Don't call me a worm!

Becky:
Is there something wrong, Class Rep?

Ichijo:
Well, I stood up just now.

Becky:
You sure did.

Ichijo:
Then I sat down.

Becky:
You sure did.

Himeko:
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, you guys.
I think that Becky's outfit today is so like superduper omega-cute
that I'm totally gonna give her a big fat "O" for okay!

Becky:
Sit down and shut your cake-hole, cowlick.

Himeko:
Maho? Did she just call me a cowlick?
Maho maho maho maho maho maho...

Rei:
I've got a question.

Becky:
So, go ahead and ask your question, bully.

Rei:
Just wanted to know, would you mind calling us by our names from now on?

Becky:
Your names?
I thought that's what I was doing.

Rei:
I meant our real names, not stuff like Bookworm or Cowlick.

Miyako:
My name is not Bookworm.

Himeko:
I have a cowlick?

Rei:
I'm asking you to call us by our real names!

Becky:
And why would I do that?

Rei:
What do you mean "Why"?

Becky:
All right.
That's it for today, everybody.

Rei:
Wait a second.

Becky:
Hey, girl who's so normal she has no distinguishing characteristics.

Kurumi:
Are you talking to me?

Becky:
Yeah, you, the boring girl.
Would you mind erasing the blackboard for me?

Kurumi:
B-Boring?!

Becky:
Thanks, I appreciate it.

Kurumi:
Oh god.
So is that how people see me?

Rei:
Hey teacher, I wasn't finished taking to you.

Becky:
Stop the nagging already.

Rei:
You haven't even memorized our names yet, have you?

Becky:
Oh, yes, I have, so?!

Rei:
You're a liar!

Becky:
I'm telling the truth.

Rei:
Then what's her name, huh, huh?!

Becky:
Boring girl.

Rei:
Quit messing around here!

Becky:
Messed... I remind you.
I'm your teacher!

Rei:
If you're our teacher then you should memorize our names.
And if you don't...!

Becky:
Eeeeek!

Rei:
Hahahaha...

Himeko:
Wait, Becky!
Rei, you went too far!

Rei:
It's just a sticker.

Himeko:
You go over there and apologize to her right now!

Rei:
What are you, crazy?
First of all, she's the one who was...

Rei:, Himeko:
Huh?

Becky:
Sob sob...

Rei:
There's no way I can beat that.
Come on, Becky, come out of there.
I'm not mad at you anymore.

Himeko:
Oh, that's a good girl, Becky.
Oh my god, the way she's sobbing is so omega-adorable I'm totally gonna explode, you guys.

No.6:
I think you're assured the sob-sob of the year prize, Miss Miyamoto.

Rei:
Hmm? Huh?

Ichijo:
Now's your chance, Rei.

Rei:
Don't even go there.

Kurumi:
Boring. I'm boring.

Himeko:
Maho maho maho...

Mesousa:
Oh, no, the cat.
Just pretend I didn't see him.

God:
Is it lunch time already?

Mesousa:
I don't see anything, I don't see anything.

God:
They're warm by my body heat.

Mesousa:
I don't see anything, I don't see anything, I don't see anything.

God:
Are you of the canine persuasion?

Mesousa:
No, I'm a rabbit.
Oh, no, I answered him.

God:
They're warm from my body heat.

Mesousa:
I will buy one, thanks.


Saotome:
What? You're telling me you can't remember any of your students' names?

Becky:
That's right.
I don't know why, but their faces and names just don't match up.

Saotome:
I guess you're not as smart as everyone thinks you are, huh, Miss Miyamoto?

Becky:
I'll hit you.

Saotome:
Aren't you supposed to say that before you hit someone?
I was just trying to joke around with you.


Igarashi:
I think you don't want to.
You can memorize more complicated things than that.

Becky:
Hmm?

Igarashi:
You are not trying to learn their names.
You don't think it's important enough to actually worry about.
That's why you're having so much trouble with it.

Becky:
So that's my problem, huh?

Igarashi:
Oh, yes. I'm certain that's what it is.
Because I, myself, haven't memorized the name of this school's principal to this day!


Becky:
I understand.

Saotome:
See? You're not stupid.
You're just a lazy snob.

Igarashi:
But I wanted to ask.
How's it going in there?

Becky:
Well, it's... I guess if you wanted to, you could say it's going...

Igarashi:
Those girls are stinkers, but don't let them get you down.
You just let them know who's in charge.

Becky:
I will. Thank you very much.

Saotome:
Hold on a second.

Becky:
Oh, what do you want now, P.E. teacher?

Saotome:
How come you're way more polite to her than you were to me?

Becky:
Am I?
Why do you think that?

Saotome:
Oh, just... forget I asked.

Igarashi:
I know, how about we get some dessert after work?

Becky:
Wow, thanks for asking.
I hope to go.

Saotome:
Oh god, why?

Himeko:
Becky, I need to talk to you.

Becky:
Oh, okay, cowlick.
What's going on?
Becky:
What's going on out here?

Rei:
Look at that.

Kurumi:
Boring...Boring...Boring...Boring...

Becky:
What the hell is she doing in there?

Miyako:
Ever since you called her boring girl, she's been obsessing about it.

Becky:
What? You've got to be kidding!!

Himeko:
Poor thing...Can't we do anything to help her?

No.6:
I wish there was a way we could think of something that'd cheer her up somehow.

Miyako:
Yeah, but if we don't do it exactly right, we might just make her more depressed.

Himeko:
Becky, can't you think of something to do for her?

Becky:
Uh... Just give me a second here, okay?

Ichijo:
Got it...!

No.6:
Looks like our class rep's thought of something.

Rei:
I'm not sure we're gonna like her solution, though.


Ichijo:
Excuse me.
Is there anyone there?

Twins:
Can we help you?

Ichijo:
Oooooooo, ow!

Twins:
You're not hurt, are you?

Twins:
You're from 1-C, aren't you?

Ichijo:
What would you do if I told you my name is Ichijo, class representative?

Twins:
Huh? We wouldn't do anything.
What did you come here for, again?

Ichijo:
I'm not your long-lost sister, but I need your help.
What do you say?
Are you with me?

Twins:
Sure.

Akane:
Hehehehehe, whehehehe.


Rei:
I bet those things are totally fattening.

Himeko:
Oh, Becky!

Becky:
Hey there!

Kurumi:
Hey what?

Becky:
Uh... Well, I just...
Crap! I forgot to ask those guys what boring girl's name is!

Kurumi:
Is something the matter, Becky?

Becky:
No, I just... um...
Uh, do you like bunnies?

Kurumi:
Not really.

Miyako:
Looks like she's letting her nerves get the best of her.

Rei:
Why did she go in there in the first place?

Becky:
Well, if you don't like bunnies, let's get out of the rabbit hutch, okay?

Kurumi:
No, I think it's best if I stay out of the way.
So I don't accidentally bore someone to death.

Becky:
Look, I'm really sorry I called you the boring girl.

Kurumi:
Oh, I don't blame you for that, Becky.
It's not your fault, I'm unremarkable.

Becky:
Uh... Oh, man, I don't think I could feel any worse.

Did you understand I was being ironic? You're not boring at all!
Haha...haha...

Kurumi:
Is that true?

Becky:
Uh-huh!

Kurumi:
I have a presence and I'm memorable?

Becky:
Y-Y-Yah, uh-huh, of course you are, uh-huh, hahaha...

Kurumi:
Good!
Then can you please call me by my real name?

Becky:
What! Uh...

Rei:
Dug her own grave, didn't she?

everyone:
You can do it!

Becky:
Mo...M-Mo...

Miyako:
She just might do it!

Rei:
Come on, Becky! Keep going!

No.6:
Her name is Momose Kurumi. Say it!

Becky:
Momomomomo...

Kurumi:
That's right!
Keep going!

Becky:
Momo kuri sannen kaki hachinen-ko!

everyone:
Huh?

Rei:
That isn't even a name.

Becky:
I'm sorry.

Ichijo:
It's finally finished now, professor.
Wanna see it?

Becky:
Who are you calling professor?

Ichijo:
Everything's gonna be all right.
Now, come on over here.
There's no need to be shy, okay?
Come here.

Ichijo:
It's Kurumi No. 2.

Kurumi:
Kurumi...

Becky:
No. 2.

Mesousa:
That's me. I'm No. 2.

Ichijo:
You'll never be lonely again.

No.6:
What just happened?

Rei:
It's amazing.
Her solution had absolutely nothing to do with Kurumi's problem.

Himeko:
I think Miss Ichijo might be the best class rep we've ever had.

Rei:, Miyako:
Are you out of your mind?

Himeko:
Maho maho.

bird:
Oh-oh! It's commercial time nationwide.

Aliencrew:
A homeroom class is scheduled this afternoon.

Aliencaptain:
Things must be rough for Miss Miyamoto.

Aliencrew:
That's true, but I believe she is still somewhat at fault for not memorizing their names.

Aliencaptain:
Really? Do you know what my name is by chance?

Aliencrew:
Captain[beep].

Aliencaptain:
Wow...Wow! That's pretty good.

Aliencrew:
Do you know my name, Alien captain?

Aliencaptain:
Hmm... Must have slipped my mind.

Aliencrew:
Man...Can I just go back to my planet?

Becky:
All right! It's time for homeroom, everybody!

Rei:
Becky.

Becky:
Huh? What do you want?

Misao:
Don't you think he's the most adorable thing you've ever seen, sir?
Or don't you think he's just the cutest?

Geezer:
Hmm? Oh, I guess so.

Misao:
I know.
That's what I told Inugami.
But there's obviously something wrong with his sense of aesthetic.

Inugami:
What's supposed to be cute about that slimy thing?

Misao:
Oh! Upako! Did you see that? She is smiling.
Inugami:
And what part of her face is supposed to be smiling exactly!?

Misao:
Please sir! I want you to throw him out of this classroom right now.

Geezer:
Well, Nanjo, more importantly...

Misao:
Homeroom?

Geezer:
That's right, Nanjo.

Misao:
I'm not dumb, sir. I know how to read.
Isn't that right, Upako?
Oh! She smiled again, everybody.

Geezer:
Actually, well, all I was trying to indicate you is that break time is over.

Misao:
Yah, I know that, sir.

Geezer:
Then take that thing and go back to your seat!

Misao:
Only if you kick Inugami out!

Geezer:
I don't negotiate with students!

Misao:
Fine sir, I'll go back to my seat now.
I can't lift it.

Geezer:
What!? Then how did you get it up here?

Behoimi:
I'd like to help. Let me carry this tank for you, Nanjo.

Misao:
Oh! Behoimi, you really are a life saver.

Behoimi:
Well I'm...the soothing magical girl!

Geezer:
Just one more thing, Nanjo.

Misao:
Yes sir, what is it?

Geezer:
Do something about your other creatures?

Misao:
But they're too cute to hide away.

Geezer:
Why I decided against retiring at the end of last year, I'll never know!
Hey, what happened to Serizawa?

Behoimi:
I...can't hol- Oh!

Misao:
Oh my god!

Behoimi:
I can't believe it happened!

Akira:
I'll go get some water for hi-

Misao:
Upako! Don't you dare! Don't die on me!

Geezer:
Uh, more importantly, where's Serizawa?

Inugami:
Do something about this kangaroo.

Behoimi:
The chickens are all laying eggs!

Inugami:
Anyone!

Misao:
You hang in there, sweet little Upako!

Behoimi:
I just know he's gonna make it!
He's a gutsy little guy, Nanjo!

Geezer:
Just...put them out of your mind.

Roboko:
Piko, piko.

Becky:
Uh, could you say that again, please?

Roboko:
I am called Roboko.
The most advanced robot ever developed by NASA. Piko, piko.

Himeko:
Whoa! Is she really from NASA?

Becky:
Okay, cut to the chase, Roboko.
What are you doing in my classroom?

Roboko:
The United States Defense Department of Defense has sent me to investigate the little kid teacher. Piko, piko.

Becky:
That sounds plausible.

Poboko:
Just think of me as a transfer student. Piko.

Himeko:
Maho! One of my classmates is a robot, this is so way exciting.

Miyako:
It doesn't take all that much to please you, does it?

Kurumi:
So much attention, that must be nice.

Meosusa:
I was just gonna say that.

Becky:
Look, whatever.
Just go back to your seats, everybody.
It's about time we started today's lesson.

Roboko:
Not so fast! Piko!
Little kid teacher, I was sent to investigate your power. I'm challenging you!

Becky:
Ah, come on, give me a break.

Roboko:
Woooooooo!

Becky:
Please stop.

Roboko:
This is a battle, just man to man, and our pride's on the line.

Becky:
Both of us are girls.

Roboko:
D'oh!
When my flame burns out, all that will be left is pure white dust. Pi...ko...ko...

Becky:
Will somebody get this overgrown microwave out of here?
She's interfering with my lesson plans and I worked really really hard on them!

Himeko:
Oh, Becky...
You robot! How dare you make my tiny teacher cry? You're terrible!

Roboko:
Piko, piko. Why can't we all be friends!?


Himeko:
Oh my god!
Rei, that robot is a total fake and I bet all that stuff she was saying about NASA isn't really true either.

Rei:
Wow, you're dumber than I thought.

Roboko:
Yes, this is Roboko.
What? The President of the United States is in trouble?!
Yes, sir! I am on my way, sir! Piko!

Rei:
Hold it!
You're Akane Serizawa from 1-B!
Where do you think you're going?

Becky:
We're in the middle of class, Roboko.
You can't leave now...

Himeko:
Maho, maho, maho, maho...

Roboko:
Let me go!

Himeko:
You think you can just make fun of Becky and then just leave?

Roboko:
No!

Geezer:
Also, I want to remind you by Monday you need to form small groups for the camping class next month.

Inugami:
I told you it's dead, it's not moving.

Misao:
What are you talking about? He's alive as you and me.

Behoimi:
Upako! Hey!

Geezer:
Why I decided against retiring, I'll never know.

Becky:
All right! Why don't we draw lots to see who's in which group for the camping trek?
I know it's a pain, but it's gotta be done.
Kurumi Momose.
Why don't you do this for me?

Kurumi:
Sure.

Becky:
No more than four people per group.

Kurumi:
Sure.

Becky:
You've caused me so much grief I can finally remember your name.
Funny how that works, ain't it?

Kurumi:
Becky...

Becky:
You think you can do it?

Kurumi:
I'll try my best!

Roboko:
E-Excuse me?

Becky:
Yes? What is it, Roboko? You have to go the rest room?

Roboko:
Yes ma'am, piko.

Himeko:
That's weird. I didn't think robots ever went to the bathroom.

Roboko:
Well...I...I, you know, to tell you the truth, I...you know...

Rei:
If you're gonna make up a story, you have to stick with it.

Miyako:
Didn't they teach you that in drama?

Kurumi:
Think what a robot would do.
Isn't that right, Becky?

Becky:
I huh...guess!

Roboko:
Danger! Danger! At this rate, the environment will be polluted!
All life on this planet will be destroyed forever. Danger!

Rei:
Oh! No!

Miyako:
Himeko, untie the robot! Now!

Himeko:
How come I have to!?

No.6:
Oh, Roboko.You win for pushing the year's limits.

Himeko:
Roboko!

Crap. That was too much gunpowder. Yasuda!

Becky:
Serizawa...

Himeko:
I'm so totally glad Kurumi's feeling better again.

Miyako:
I guess Becky is not so bad.

Rei:
She was the one who started this whole problem in the first place.

Himeko:
Well, anyway, it all worked out in the end.
You could say we threw the book on it.

Miyako:
That's not the way you say that phrase.

Himeko:
Isn't it? Uh, exploded the book, then?

Rei:
You're getting colder.

Miyako:
Did you mean to say we closed the book or finished the chapter.

Himeko:
No, that doesn't sound right to me.

Rei&Miyako:
It is!

Himeko:
Maho?

Yuma&Yuna:
Serizawa!

Yuna:
We know you're in there. We're opening the door now.

Yuma&Yuna:
Serizawa?

Akane:
This blunder is a disgrace which will last for generations.
I shall commit harakiri as an apology to my father, mother, and all our ancestors.

Yuma&Yuna:
Akane, no! Don't do it!

Akane:
It's time!

Becky:
Good! I know them.

Igarashi:
You've memorized your students' names?

Becky:
Yes I...I think I've finally got them.
Starting tomorrow I won't need to use nicknames anymore.

Saotome:
You just looked at your roll book for a second.
If you can memorize the whole class of names so easily, I mean you're a genius, why didn't you learn them when you got home from work the first day?

Becky:
Don't question the genius!

Saotome:
OK.

Kurumi:
I caused you all so much trouble today. I figured I'd just try to apologize to Becky before I go home.

No.6:
Sure.

Igarashi:
Now that I think of it.
There's this one student in your classroom who's never really made that much of an impression on me.

Becky:
Which one of them is it?

Igarashi:
Let me see...
Oh! Kurumi Momose!

Kurumi:
Oh!!

Mesousa:
Nice to have you back.

Kurumi:
Thanks...

No. 6:
She went this way!

Becky:
What, are you worried about that rabbit hutch?!

Himeko:
Maho! I'm Himeko Katagiri from Class 1-C!
Seamstress, are you crying because the hen laid an egg on the dress that is lying on the bed?
Oh, speaking of eggs, what do you put over your curry and rice?
I put mayonnaise on mine. But wait, rice sounds good, too!
That'll be rice and curry rice. Be sure to watch the next episode!
