Alien:
Alien captain.
The mother computer has designated the earthling sample.

Alien captain.
Hmm? Excellent.
Hmm, that's the Miyamoto residence.

Alien:
Do you know them?

Alien captain:
[Nah/I] don't. Not really.

Alien:
Computer show us inside.

Alien captain:
Wow, a little kid.

Alien:
Yes, sir.
She is the one who's been chosen as the earthling as ecological sample.
The second daughter of the Miyamoto family.
Her name is Rebecca.

Alien captain:
She looks like a little angel when she's sleeping.
However, the fate of Earth kind of depends on you.
So xxx hang in there, I guess, okay, you little cutie.

Mesousa:
sob, sob, sob...

Becky:
XXX

bird:
It's morning time nationwide! baby!

Himeko:
Maho!
Oh my god, oh my god, you guys will never beleive the news I got.
This is some omega-big gossip.
Ugh!

Miyako:
What on earth makes you make so much noise so early, God!

Kurumi:
We should expect it by now.

Rei:
Tell us what it is, Himeko.
You see a chupacabra or something?

Himeko:
Maho, maho, maho, maho, maho...

No.6:
I hope you didn't hurt yourself, did you, Himeko?

Himeko:
Hmm... I'm okay.
And I've got huge gossip.

Everyone:
What?!

Rei:
Our homeroom teacher Mr.[censored] quit on us?!

Himeko:
It just happened yesterday.
It's the biggest news ever.

Kurumi:
I don't think I understand.

Miyako:
Quitting without giving us any notice.
It's irresponsible!

No.6:
Do you know if he gave any reason?

Himeko:
Uh, you know, I kinda didn't think to ask that.

Miyako:
Ugh!

Everyone:
Huh?

Ichijo:
Entering the priesthood.

Miyako:
Priesthood?!

Kurumi:
Really? are you serious?

Ichijo:
We should devote ourselves to God.

Kurumi:
Do you think she's still talking to us?

Rei:
Don't worry about her.
She doesn't know anything.

Geezer:
That's not exactly what happened, but she is not that far off.

Kurumi:
Hey it's the geezer.

Geezer:
I'm a teacher, young lady, not a geezer.

Kurumi:
Sir, you know, you're in our room C, right?

No.6:
Your class room is the next door over.

Geezer:
I'm aware of that.
I just came here to tell you what's going on.
Now get back to your seats!

Geezer:
Unfortunately, your homeroom teacher Mr.[censored] turned in his resignation yesterday and won't be returning to teach you ever again.

Miyako:
But, did he give any reason, sir?

Geezer:
[CENSORED]

Geezer:
But if you want to know the truth.
Ha ha ha ha...

Rei:
So do you ever wonder what the hell's going on behind the scenes of this school?

Geezer:
Well, his departure is pretty sudden,
but luckily we have a replacement line up for him already.
But she's not here yet.

Rei:
Then don't turn your head like that!
It's confusing!

Kurumi:
So are you gonna tell us what she's like?

Geezer:
Sure, your new teacher's name is Miss Miyamoto and...
I'm going to have shake-ben for lunch.

Rei:
We don't care what's in your bento-box, old man.

Himeko:
Oh my god! I totally love shake-ben, too!
Hmm? Shake-ben and yake-ben sound little alike, don't they?

Rei:
What is yake-ben anyway?

Himeko:
Maho?

Kurumi:
Oh my god, do you have a picture of Miss Miyamoto or anything?

Geezer:
Hmm, of course I do.

Himeko:
You've got to let me see!
I omega-wanna see it!


Rei:
And you'd better not just pull out a picture of yourself.

Geezer:
Tch, tch, tch...

Rei:
What that sound means?
Why don't you just do whatever you came here for and get out!

Geezer:
Uh, here it is, Miss Rebecca Miyamoto, your teacher.

Miyako:
Our teacher's a corpse?

Rei:
Take off that stupid black ribbon.

Geezer:
Tch, tch, tch...

Kurumi:
But that picture really is a picture of her, isn't it?

Geezer:
Unfortunately, yes, it certain is.

Rei:
What do you mean, "Unfortunately"?

Kurumi:
Whoa, she is a foreigner!

Miyako:
And on top of that, she's blonde.

Himeko:
Oh my god you guy's, she's just a little kid!
She is like omega-cute!

Miyako:
I don't care how cute she is.
She'd just better be smarter the hell.

Becky:
My first day of work, and I overslept.

Mesousa:
I tried to wake you up so many times.
Oh, I'm... so sorry.
I fell your and my alarm clock to xxx...
Uh, would you like me to carry your bag for you?

Becky:
Sure, if you feel like it.

Mesousa:
I don't have thumbs.

Rei:
I okay, I say we'll use this hour to study time to discuss why we choose the fricking elementary school student to be our teacher.

Himeko:
All right, you go, Rei!
Oh, and you too, Miss Number 6!

Miyako:
This is asinine.

Rei:
What did you say, Miyako?

Miyako:
What's the point of having a discussion anyway?

Himeko:
Uh uh, it's because she's just a little kid!

Miyako:
Saying "Because" doesn't make that an answer.

Rei:
Yeah, whatever bookworm.
Why don't you just get back to your studying.

Miyako:
Don't call me a worm!

Himeko:
I didn't know you were an actuall worm, Miyako!
I just warn you must cover up your...

Miyako:
I'M NOT!

Himeko:
Maho?

Miyako:
And another thing.
Who died and made you queen of homeroom, Rei?
Shouldn't the class rep organize these discussions for us?
You're stepping on Ichijo's toes.
Don't you think so?

Rei:
Right, now as I was saying.

Miyako:
Ohhhhhh!


Becky:
Is that the ocean?

Mesousa:
Yes.

Becky:
We got on the wrong bus, didn't we?

Mesousa:
Yes.

Becky:
Maybe I should've stayed in bed.


Rei:
It looks like we're running out of kid jokes and short jokes so I say we move on to choosing her nickname.

Himeko:
Oh, I got it.

Rei:
I'm not looking forward to this, but go ahead, Himeko.

Himeko:
Rebeko!

Rei:
It's too weird.

Himeko:
Then how about Re-be-ko?

Rei:
That's what you just said.

Miyako:
In foreign countries,
sometimes they shorten names like Stephanie becomes Steph and Catherine becomes Cathy, you know?

Kurumi:
After all that bitching, she's adding to the discussion.

Himeko:
Steph and Cathy, huh?
Oh, what am I...
Oh, I got it. Pick me!

Rei:
Go ahead, Himeko.

Himeko:
How about Rebbe!

Rei:
Go home.

Rei:
Did you wanna say something, too?

Miyako:
She stood up for nothing?

Himeko:
Rebethy!

Rei:
Thought I told you to go home!


Becky:
Where the heck are we?

Mesousa:
In the woods, I think.

Becky:
Why?

Mesousa:
Uh-uhhh.


Becky:
Well, there's no reason we have to be lost and thirsty.
Oh man, what're we thinking?
This soda's warm.

Mesousa:
Maybe they just reloaded it so the cans aren't cold yet.

Becky:
I was already frustrated about being late and getting lost!
And now, this!

Becky:
Huh?

Lord Cat:
The cans are warm by my body heat.

Becky:
Aw.

Lord Cat:
And F.Y.I.
I'm god by the way.

Becky:
Huh?

Lord Cat:
As a token of our new acquaintanceship, would you like another drink?
Oh, and Miss, could you please close the door for me?

Becky:
Screw you, kitty.

Becky:
Oh, so you're from Momotsuki Academy.
But how did you know that we were here?


Mesousa:
We've finally made it.
But, that doesn't make you happey?

Becky:
I was late to work on my first day.
How am I ever gonna let this down.

Mesousa:
You wanna go back home now?

Becky:
No, I just need to go in there and face the music.

Mesousa:
Would you like to go home now?

Becky:
Uh-uh.
Aah, darn it!

Everyone:
Hello, Becky!

Becky:
Co...commercial!


Rei, Himeko, Kurumi:
Becky, Becky, Becky.

Becky:
Stop calling me Becky!


Himeko:
Maho, maho, maho, maho.

Becky:
Can we go home now, Mesousa?!

Kurumi:
This little thingy she's talking to behind the podium, what do you suppose it is?

Rei:
Huh?

Kurumi:
Is that a rabbit?

Rei:
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's gotta be something like that.

Kurumi:
Do you think it's edible?

Rei:
There's only one way to find out.

Becky:
Okay then, first things first, I'd like to take attendance.
But before I do that I wanted to...
I just wanted to say, I wanted to say that I...

Himeko:
Huh?

Becky:
I wanted to apologize to you for coming late this morning.

Himeko:
She's so omega-adorable!

Becky:
Omega what?

Himeko:
Oh, [call on me], little kid teacher, I've got a question!

Becky:
Not if you call me little kid!

Himeko:
So are you like mixed, why?

Becky:
Huuuuuuuhhhhhh?!

Rei:
[Quit to know] we're getting over [a] hard question that the way first.

Kurumi:
A more importantly were you born in America?
Or were you born in Japan?

Himeko:
Do you like eating shake-ben?

Miyako:
Pardon me, but would you mind showing us your teaching license?

Ichijo:
My name is Ichijo, your class representative.

No.6:
Can you tell us what your favorite food is?

Himeko:
Do you like yake-ben?
And early ask about yake-ben?

Ichijo:
Or maybe I'm not the class representative.


You're mixed up in, right?
[Like I xxx Jones?]
How about shake-ben, you like that?


Igarashi:
Hmm, what's going on?

Behoimi:
So the long waited teacher has finally arrived?
Come on let's go, check it out, guys!

Geezer:
Hmm, Your step once a foot out the door, and I'll be standing by your pillow every night!
What a darn bunch of cowards.

Becky:
Shut up, you little brats! Don't you dare underestimate me!
Look, I don't care if you ask me questions.
But please use your brain before you open your mouth.
For the love of God, try to think of less boring things to ask.
Understand? You lower life forms!

Rei:
How dare you talk to your students like that.

Kurumi:
Is she crying.

Himeko:
Come on. Stop being so mean.
She's just a little kid after all, Rei!

Rei:
She may be just a little kid, but she's still a teacher and there are things teacher can say and things that aren't way of the line.
I don't care if she's a world-famous genius or whatever she is.
Little brat.
Certain rules she's have to be, you know, uh...

Becky:
Sob, sob, sob...

Rei
Oh my god, she's so young.

Becky:
What did you that for?
I'm your teacher.

Rei:
Oh, boy.

Becky:
Hau, hau, hau...

Rei:
All right, I didn't hear that moment I went too far.
I won't say that stuff too muggins so stop crouching behind the curtains and come on out here, okay?
I'm not mad at you anymore, see?
Come on, it's okay.

Becky:
You really mean it?

Rei:
Cross my heart.

Rei:
Hu ha ha ha ha ha.

Kurumi:
She's not hiding anymore.

Rei:
We really curious about you so we're probably gonna ask you a little questions.
You understand that, right?

Becky:
mh mh.

Rei:
Awesome.
So, all of us's questions promise to hold until you call on us.
And you don't have to answer anything you don't wanna answer, deal?

Becky:
It's a deal.

Rei:
Good!
I'd like to ask you the first question.
We all heard that you graduated university in America.
Which school did you go to.

Becky:
M.I.T.

Rei:
M.I.T?
Does that stand for something?

Becky:
Massachuchuchuchu..., oh gash.
Massachusechacha...
Massachuchuohsh...

Becky:

Rei:
Heh he he...

Himeko:

Becky:
Wah wah wah wah wah...

Himeko:
Maho?

Becky:
Mmeehh!
I'm your teacher, jerk!

Miyako:
You asked for that on purpose, didn't you?

Rei:
It was just a way of showing my love.

Miyako:
Oh, you are evil.

Himeko:
I'm on the way guys, let me handle this one, okay?
Oh, come on Becky, and show us your pretty face.
We can go outside and poke honeycombs and play!

Are you dumb?
Do you just think, aren't ya?

Himeko:
Wah wah wah wah.

Rei:
Honeycombs? Give me a break.

Miyako:
For real.

No.6:
Doesn't it look like it's gonna be easy to get out of there.

Ichijo:
Would you like one of these?

Miyako:
Sweet rice dumplings?
Interesting approach, and that just might do it.

Himeko:
You've got some cool tricks up your sleeve, don't you, Ichijo?

Ichijo:
Oh, hell yes.
If she takes these, it'll be over.

Himeko:
Huh?

Rei:
You mean those things?

Miyako:
Miss Ichijo, what are you trying to say?

Ichijo:
Whisper, whisper, whisper.

Rei:
All right, get them out of here, guys.

Staff:
Watch out for the my cable.

Ichijo:
Oh no...

Miyako:
My god, what was she thinking?
She's the class rep for Pete's sake!

Rei:
I don't think being the class rep really has anything to do with it.

Becky:
Wah wah wah...

Himeko:
Hey, Becky!

Miyako:
Man, I don't think she's over [gonna] come back here.

Himeko:
Why, just because everybody picked on her?

Miyako:
This is not good, you guys.
What're we gonna do?

Rei:
Umm.

Mesousa:
Sob, sob, sob....
It looks like everyone in this room has already forgotten good old Mesousa ever existed.

Alien:
Earthlings sure are difficult to understand, aren't they?
Alien captain?
Um, Alien captain?

Alien captain:
Hmm, I wasn't sleeping.
I've had awake this whole time.
I wish just let me my eyes, man.

Alien:
Let me give you some time to think about better excuse.

Himeko:
Maho.

Kurumi:
Is she crying?

Miyako:
No, I don't think I see anymore tears.

Himeko:
Maho, I [put] little Becky so sad.
She's all crying but Himeko is.

Rei:
Don't encourage her.

Miyako:
I wonder what she is thinking about.

Kurumi:
Maybe she's thinking if they pick on me again, I'll quit.

Himeko:
Quit? Noooooooo!

Rei:
Yeah, make me so pretty bad if she quit after just 10minutes of us.

No.6:
There's gotta be solution of this problem, doesn't there?

Ichijo:
Oh, I can make it go away.

Rei:
Get out of here.

Miyako:
What's up?
Something's going on.

Rei:
That's Becky's bunny.

No.6:
He looks like is talking to her.

Miyako:
Maybe trying to convince her.
Becky shows no reaction.
And now it's giving up.

Rei:
That might be the saddest thing I've ever seen.

Becky:
Ah.
Yes.

Miyako:
Huh? She's up!

No.6:
Oh, I wonder if she's finally decided to quit then.

Himeko:
Hey, don't say that!

Miyako:
Huh! She's coming this way!

Rei:
Retreat!

Staff:
Good work there, guys.

Staff:
XXX

Himeko:
Oh, Becky!
Come give your big sister Himeko a great big hug!

Rei:
You're coming with us, whether you like it or not.

Himeko:
Maho, maho, maho, maho, maho.

Kurumi:
I'm just saying if she's not back yet, then.

Miyako:
I wonder if she could've gone.
Maybe she's going to the principal's office to resign her position.

Rei:
That won't be very good for us at all.

No.6:
Here she comes!

Everyone:
Huh?


Becky:
Humph?

Rei:
Look, I'm sorry.
I was way out of line earlier and I got carried away.
I just wanted to apologize for that, sorry.

Miyako:
And I'm very sorry, we all laughed at you.

Kurumi:
Please forgive us, Becky.

No.6:
I'm sorry, too.


Himeko:
Please don't say you're going to quit because of us.
And please don't leave us, Becky.
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah...

Becky:
Me? Quit?
Why did you that?

Everyone:
Huh?

Becky:
Now [lessen your barrier]!

Becky:
You'll never ever treat me like a kid again, you got that?
Because I'm not a kid anymore!

Kurumi:
Man, what a relief.

Himeko:

Becky:

Ichijo:

Mesousa:

Ichijo:
You shouldn't get so depressed, little bunny?

Mesousa:
I'll try not to be...

Ichijo:
This isn't much, but...

Mesousa:
Wow, you mean I can really have these? I was getting so hungry I didn't know how I was gonna make it to my next meal.

Ichijo:
Make sure to eat them all.


Becky:
Well, before I send all of you home for today I should probably get around to taking attendance.
So, is there Miyako Uehara here today?

Miyako:
