chapter 01:
Homura:
We pray for hope, embrace curses and protect you from the dark.
We are magical girls.
We traded our souls for our powers and a destiny of battle.
A destiny which ends in oblivion.
For the only way to escape our despair is to vanish from this world.
The end will come for all of us.
So we continue our fight and wait for the Law of Cycles to lead us away.
In this broken world, doomed to repeat its tragedies and hatred,
I dreamed of someone I knew and saw her familiar smile again.

Madoka(background voice):
...and place...
...in return...
...there's once...
...all of the world...
...having wishes for...
...and no more, which made the creature in the...
...it was said that the moment they ceased to exist...
...a being will suddenly appear...
...

Sayaka:
Awesome job, Madoka!

Kyoko:
We got this thing right where we want!

chapter 02:
Madoka:
Huh?!
Hm... huh... It's morning already?
Good morning, Kyubey.

Kyubey:
Kyu? Kyu.

Madoka:
Good morning, Dad!

Tomohisa:
Hey Madoka, morning.

Madoka:
Mom up yet?

Tomohisa:
Tatsuya's waking her up.
He might need some help, though.

Madoka:
Okay!

Tatsuya:
Mama, mama!
Wake up, wake up!
C'mon, mama!
Mama, mama!

Madoka:
Rise and shine!

Junko:
Urghhhhhhh! Ah...
What's new in your world?

Madoka:
Hitomi's not doing so well.
Kyosuke's been so busy, it's hard for her to see him.

Junko:
Oh, that's gonna be a big problem if they're serious about going steady.
Tell her, "Don't get discouraged, don't obsess and don't give up!"

Madoka:
Huh...

Junko:
Here.

Madoka:
I think Ms. Saotome is in the dumps, too.
She talks about the end of the world in class all the time.

Junko:
Oh, boy. Well maybe I can set her up on a blind date or something.

Madoka:
I wonder why she isn't more popular with the guys.
There's a lot of really cute things about her.

Junko:
When it comes to men, she sets her standards really high.
She doesn't wanna compromise, that's just how she is.

Madoka:
Oh...

Junko:
Here we go!

Madoka:
Oh, I almost forgot. We have a new student transferring into today.

Junko:
That's weird. Isn't it kinda late in the year for that?

Madoka:
I wonder what they'll like? Whatever it is, I hope we can be friends.

Kyubey:
Kyuu, kyu kyu.

Tatsuya:
Ah...

Junko:
Yay, safe.
Now be good, and eat it all up, okay?

Tatsuya:
Okay!

Tomohisa:
Hey honey, some more coffee?

Junko:
Uh... I better not.
All right! I'm off to work.

Tomohisa, Madoka and Tatsuya:
Have a great day!

Tomohisa:
Hey you, you'll be late if you don't hurry.

Madoka:
Huh?! Oh, yay.
See you later!

Tomohisa:
Have a great day!

Tatsuya:
Have a great daaaay!

Kyubey:
Kyu!

Madoka:
Fufufu.

chapter 03:
<OP>

chapter 04:
Madoka:
Good morning!

Kyoko:
Glad you can make it today, Madoka.

Sayaka:
Nice job last night, killer.

Student:
Dude, I totally saw you walking home with her!

Sayaka:
You get any sleep after you got back?

Madoka:
Yeah, a little. I didn't have time to do the reading assignment though.
So I'm toasted by get called on today.

Kyoko:
Oh, don't even sweat it.
Hell I didn't even bother doing my homework last night. I'm in way more trouble.
Hey Madoka, you'll help me up your homework later, right?

Sayaka:
Hold it! Don't you dear mix Madoka up in your shady scheming?

Kyoko:
It's only because you won't let me see yours!
Besides, if anyone's shady, it's you. All sneaking off by yourself to get a head start on your homework.

Sayaka:
I offered to help you with it when we got home!
It's your own fault for bailing to go watch TV!

Madoka:
Come on, you guys, take it easy...

Kyoko:
I knew it was gonna be too hard to go to school and be a magical girl!
There is never any time to have fun!

Sayaka:
Oh yeah?! No one never said "having fun" was gonna be part of the deal?

Kyubey:
Kyu.

Kyoko:
C'mon, Sayaka! you ...

Sayaka:
Stop running around like that!

Ms. Saotome:
Ahem.
Okay class, just because the date of the Mayan apocalypse has passed,
don't you dare think you're safe?
This is the beginning of the end times, kiddos.
We'll have a solar and lunar eclipse on the holy day of the certain religion totally six.
Isn't that scary? You better believe it.
What'll it all mean? it means that by 2050, our planet will experience.
What's it called Nakazawa?!

Nakazawa:
Um... I don't know what you're talking about, ma'am.

Ms. Saotome:
That's not an answer.
Statistics show 41% of the certain country's population believes the Second Coming of Christ will happen within the next 40 years!
The seven trumpets of the Revelation's may blow any minutes!
In my humble opinion,
the end of the world might not be such a bad thing.
I've had my fills with men in love for one lifetime.
If the only thing I have to look forward to is heading 40,
I'd rather all ended one big explosion.

Nakazawa:
Um.. ma'am? Are you...

Ms. Saotome:
Huh!
Ah, I almost forgot.
We're going to have a new student joining us for the rest of the semester.

Kyoko:
What a space cadet!

Ms. Saotome:
Miss Akemi, you can come in.

Students:
Oh!

Madoka:
Ah...

Sayaka:
Um...

Kyoko:
Huh?

Homura:
It's nice to meet you. My name is Homura Akemi.

Ms. Saotome:
Miss Akemi was in the hospital for a while due to her heart condition.
Since she's been away from school for so long, she might need some help adjusting.
So, let's all help her out, okay?

Students:
Yes, ma'am.

Sayaka:
Huh?!

Kyoko:
A Soul Gem?!

Madoka:
No way! She is one of us...

Ms. Saotome:
There's an open desk next to Nakazawa.
Have a seat and we'll begin.

Sayaka:
If you knew about her, how come you didn't say anything to us?

Mami:
I'm sorry, I didn't.
I kept it a secret because I thought it would be a fun surprise.

Homura:
I knew that I should have introduced myself to you last night.

Kyoko:
Wait, last night, we were hunting the Nightmare.
You mean you were waiting at the rendezvous point with Mami?
How come you didn't help us?

Mami:
She did. As a matter of fact, she helped us out a lot.
She has the most amazing power.
She's so strong, if she works with us, she'll boost our strength a hundred-fold.

Homura:
I-I'm not really that strong, but I can back you up. I'm not very good at attacks though.

Sayaka:
Well, you seem pretty cool to me.
And with all the big-shot Nightmares we've been fighting lately, we need the extra help.

Kyoko:
I guess after last night, you proved you've got what it takes to all with us.
If you wanna join our team, I'm cool with it.

Homura:
Thank you for the chance to prove myself.
I'll do my best to help you fight the Nightmares and keep everyone safe.
I won't let you down.

Madoka:
We'll do our best together, Homura!

chapter 05:
Madoka:
Isn't it pretty?

Homura:
Mm-hm.

Madoka:
Can you believe it's already been a month since you showed up here?

Homura:
No, I can't.
It's like the time is just flown by.
It feels like I've known you forever, though.

Madoka:
Hu hu.
Maybe nice if the nightmares stayed away tonight, then everyone get a good night sleep.

Kyubey:
Kyu.

Madoka:
If I tell you something, promise not to laugh.
If you here and us talking like this, it feels like something I wanted for a long time.
It's just weird, because we're just talking.
I mean, we're gonna see each other at school tomorrow anyway.

Homura:
It's not weird. I mean, I feel that way too.
Sitting here with you, it seems like something I wanted for a long, long time.


Hitomi:
Um...!

Kyosuke:
Hello. Who is this?

Hitomi:
Ah. Hi, Kyosuke. It's just me...Are you free to talk now?

Kyosuke:
Um, sure, Hitomi. What's up?

Hitomi:
Sorry to call you late, but... well...
I was wondering if you weren't doing anything this Sunday.
Do you have any plans?

Kyosuke:
Y-yeah, I do. There's not much time until next recital, so... I have to practice on Sunday... Sorry.

Hitomi:
N-no, I understand...

Kyosuke:
Our schedules never match up, do they?

Hitomi:
It's OK. There's nothing you can do about it.
Besides, I know how dedicated at your music.
That's what I love about you!

Kyosuke:
Ha ha... right.
I'll see you tomorrow at school, then.

Hitomi:
Okay... Good night.
...
I understand, his music means more than anything to him.
And that is what I love about to him.
His drive... his passion...
Whatever!
Would it kill him to use some of that drive and passion on me for a change!? ...Whoa!
Um... hic... OH, I'VE HAD IT! I don't need some these anymore!
I wish that stupid recital were disappeared!
If I had my way, It will... just...

chapter 06:
Mami:
Mm~ mm~ mm~...

Bebe:
Munch, munch... Mm bebe, mu tu bu be? (Is this cheese?)

Mami:
Bebe, hand me hairpin, please?

Bebe:
Ju be... Bu be! (It's hard!) Ju be!

Mami:
Oh?

Bebe:
Muchya muchya muchya! (Nightmare's there!)
Muchya muchya muchya qu! (Nightmare's coming!)

Mami:
Oh no, not again...

Bebe:
Muchya be cam be! (It's becoming cheese!)
Muchya be cam be! (It's becoming cheese!)

Mami:
Goodness me.
I always say, late nights are the enemy of beauty.


Kyoko:
Hey, ain't that Hitomi Shizuku's nightmare?

Sayaka:
I guess, she's having a hard time.
Ha, with a boyfriend like Captain Oblivious, it doesn't surprise me.

Kyoko:
Woo! Sounds like someone's done it's moving on!

Sayaka:
Heh heh... Yeah, maybe.
I've choked up to a life experience.
Eh!

Mami:
Look sharp. You're putting yourself in danger if you don't take it seriously.

Sayaka:
Yes, ma'am.

Kyoko:
Where's Madoka and Homura?

Homura:
We're so sorry to make you wait!

Sayaka:
Grad you decided to show up!

Madoka:
Heh, sorry, Sayaka.

Kyubey:
Kyu, Kyuu.

Bebe:
Gwah ga ga!
Mu chu ju, me de to bu!(Everyone's here!)

Mami:
Alright! Let's go to work, ladies!

Everyone:
OK!
...
Puella Magi Holy Quintet!

chapter 07:
Homura:
Madoka! Mami!

Mami:
Okay!

Madoka:
Go for it, Homura!

Madoka & Mami:
Tiro Duet!

Homura:
Release!

Sayaka:
I get how you feel, Hitomi.
But you gotta calm down!
Five Lillians!
Now, Kyoko!

Kyoko:
Latticework Barrier!

Madoka:
Look you guys!
It's stopped moving!

Mami:
Nicely done!
Now, let's finish this!

---- round cake song begin ----
Big cake! Round cake!
Right in front of me!
Who do you think this cake could be?
"moju moju ju be be?"

Sayaka:
No, it's not me!
I'm just a little ol' raspberry!
This big round cake's too red, don't ya know?
Could the cake be Kyoko?

Kyoko:
No, not me!
I'm the juicy apple in this story.
That big round cake loves Bebe can't you see?
Is the cake Mami?

Mami:
No, it's not me.
I am the cheese!
This big round cake is tumbling you see.
Could the cake be Homura?

Homura:
No, not me!
I-I'm the pumpkin full of seeds.
This big round cake looks sweeter than sweet.
Could the cake be Madoka?

Madoka:
No, it's not me!
I'm the melon, don't you see?
When you slice the melon it will bring you sweet dreams!

So why is the dream of so bitter all late?
'Cause the kitty's dream is the one on the plate.
It's so plump, it's gonna taste great!
---- round cake song end ----

Bebe:
Mo ju mo be!

Homura & Madoka:
We did it!

Kyubey:
Kyu!

Sayaka:
Let us combine in our powers like that, taking that sucker down is a breeze.

Mami:
There was a moment when I thought we were in trouble, though.
It's best not to get too overconfident.

Kyoko:
Why do you gotta be such a wet blanket?
Instead of preaching, you should invite us over for tea and cake.

Sayaka:
Now that's what I'm talking about.
Way to use your brain! Kyoko?

Mami:
Now, that's a great idea.
Who wants to come over for refreshments.

ALL (except Mami):
I do!

chapter 08:
Kyoko:
C'mon, Sayaka! You're too slow.

Mami:
I'm running a little low of chamomile tea but I think I might have just enough of one more pot.

Madoka:
Goody! I love a chamomile tea.

Mami:
Or I could make some of the echinacea tea I got the other day.

Kyoko:
Wow. That's stuff so sour. I don't do sour.

Sayaka:
Your taste buds haven't developed at the first-grade.

Kyoko:
Yeah? But my fist! huh!

Bebe:
Mechaco, mechacotti!

Mami:
I know Bebe, I didn't forget you'll get a special treat too.

Bebe:
Mascarpone! Massscarpooone!

Madoka:
What's wrong Homura? Why so quiet?

Homura:
Hm. Oh, it's nothing. I'm okay.

Homura:
( Is that how battles are, And have they always been like that? )

Madoka:
Homura! Do you want a try some of my fried chicken?

Homura:
Sure, thanks. It looks delicious.

chapter 09:
Kyoko:
Okay, what did you wanna talk about?

Homura:
Um... Um...
I was wondering, have things seemed a little odd to you lately?

Kyoko:
Huh?
I don't know what you mean, I'd like how?

Homura:
Well, that's the thing. I don't know. Everything just seems off.

Kyoko:
I got no idea what you're saying, you feeling okay?

Homura:
Um...
I guess the reason I wanted to speak to you before anyone else was, you're the one who seems the most odd to me.

Kyoko:
What?

Homura:
What I mean is, compared to the impression I have of you, something about you seems different.
It's like you're not the same person you used to be.

Kyoko:
Okay, what are you trying to do here?
Are you trying to pick a fight with me? Is that what this is?

Homura:
No, not at all.
But where are you living now?

Kyoko:
What you mean I'm crashing at Sayaka's place.
You lose your memory all of a sudden?

Homura:
And how long have you been in Mitakihara?

Kyoko:
I transferred in a little while before you did.

Homura:
And when was that?

Kyoko:
Hm?
I guess it was last year around...
When did I transfer in?
Oh, whatever, why does it matter?

Homura:
Where did you live before you moved to here?

Kyoko:
Kazamino, the next city over.
Things've got pretty quiet there for me,
so when Mami told me stuff was getting out of hand here,
I came over.

Homura:
Have you gone back to visit Kazamino lately?

Kyoko:
No, thank you.
I don't got no reason to go back there.

Homura:
Hey Kyoko, would you do me a favor, come to Kazamino with me?

Kyoko:
Huh? What the hell for?

Homura:
I just wanna go see it, that's all.
If the city is the same as you remember, I promise we'll turn around and come back.
The ownknow is just me and not something else.

Kyoko:
I got no idea what your trip is, girl.
But whatever it is, I don't think you're pulling my leg here.
Not you, you're on the level.

Homura:
I am.

Kyoko:
Well, the trip won't be for nothing. I know a good ramen shop there.
Buy me dinner and we're even.
We got a deal or what.

Homura:
Dinner's on me then!

chapter 10:
Kyoko:
At the next stop, we'll be in Kazamino city.

[bus announce]:
Next stop Mitakihara City, Third Street.
Passengers for Shinonome Dental should disembark at next stop.

Kyoko:
Wait! That isn't right!
We're supposed to left up here!

Homura:
Maybe we got on the wrong bus?

Kyoko:
No way, I'm sure we got on the one for Kazamino Station.

Homura:
Let's catch the next bus and go back.
And let's make sure it's the right one.

Kyoko:
That's the right one, no mistaken.

[Bus announce]:
Next stop Mitakihara City, Second Street.
Passengers bound for the Elementary School should disembark at next stop.
Stop requested.

Kyoko:
What's your problem?!
Stop the bus!
Damn...

chapter 11:
Kyoko:
What the hell's going on...?

Homura:
We should try walking next.
If we go back to that cross road and take the left folk, it should take us to Kazamino city, right?

Kyoko:
Yeah...

Kyoko:
Hey, was that crossroad really this far back?

Homura:
No, it's odd we haven't reached it by now.

Kyoko:
Huh?! No way...

Homura:
Something's definitely wrong.
Either we missed that crossroad which highly doubt or something else is going on here.

Kyoko:
Yep what. Why is this happening.
Is that some kind of trick to keep us from leaving Mitakihara City?

Homura:
I don't think the answer is as simple as that.
My theory is that nothing exist beyond the city.

Kyoko:
What? Really?

Homura:
Kyoko, I'm sorry. But could you not tell this others for a little while?
There's something I want to check first just be sure.

Kyoko:
Are you crazy?!
We have to tell the others.

Homura:
Please.
I think it will be safer if we pretend we haven't discovered anything.

Kyoko:
Hm, huh!

Homura:
If we draw attention to ourselves now, we'll be hunted down.
This is a trap. Make no mistake.

Kyoko:
Got any idea what's going on?

Homura:
Yes.
Which is why I don't want you to do anything.
From now, let me handle this.

Homura:
As far as I can tell, the one whose trap, this is only playing with our perceptions...for now.
So, as long as we play along, we won't be in any danger.

Kyoko:
Fine. Whatever you say.

Kyoko:
Maybe my memories are screwed up, but I think I get we were coming from before.

Homura:
How so?

Kyoko:
It's weird, like, I don't remember you've been as tough as you're acting right now.
But it doesn't surprise me either.
This you, the tougher you feels right, Humph.

Homura:
Am I the only one who remembers?
I have seen this kind of trap before.
A self contained illusion.
A maze with no exit, where prey is lured and led astray.
There's no doubt about it.
This is a labyrinth.

chapter 12:
Homura:
Witches... the ones who spread despair, and disaster.
It's the final form of a magical girl takes. When she's lost hope and given in to despair.
I remember how hard if what to change the cruel destiny by repeating time over and over again.
It all ended, finally, thanks to one girl, who sacrificed for the cycle of hope and despair.
With that, the world should have been led to a new order of things.
However...
It seems we all have forgotten or happened.
Or rather, we were made to.
Someone is trying to replace our memories what happened with false ones,
and trapped us here, in this false Mitakihara City.

chapter 13:
Bebe:
Munch, munch... Mu wu te be! (It's hot!)

Mami:
Oh, you silly thing. Mind your manners at the table, or you're going to turn into the cheese.

Bebe:
Mugh! Mo chu mo chu ca mem bert! (I'm becoming cheese!)
Mo chu mo chu ca mem bert! (I'm becoming cheese!) Mu gi! ...mu be?

Madoka:
You guys are so cute together, you're like best friends.
I remember the day I met you, and there was Bebe, tagging along in being adorable.

Mami:
Bebe and I've been friends for a long time.

Bebe:
Mu!

Mami:
I met her before anyone else, we had lots of adventures, hm, far too many to count.

Homura:
Do you remember how Bebe came to stay with you, or when you met her?

Mami:
Hm?

Madoka:
Hm?

Bebe:
Ur... Mo ju mo ju (Homura), Be be cu ba(Why do you hear?)

Homura:
I was just curious is all.

Mami:
I'm not sure the exact date, but it seems like ages ago.
Back in those days, I was all alone, the only magical girl in Mitakihara City.
The only one who comforted me, and cheered me on, was Bebe.
Without Bebe in my life, I would've given up the fight long ago.

Madoka:
C'mon, don't say that...

Homura:
She's right, Mami.
You're much braver and stronger than that.

Mami:
Not really.
I just act confident because that was expected over senior magical girl.
But thing is, Madoka and Sayaka have come into along now.
We even have you and Kyoko to back us up, too.
I never dreamed that I have so many friends I could rely on.
I don't have to push myself so hard any more, because now I have help.

Bebe:
Mo ju mo ju tu ru pe tu. (Mami is really a crybaby)
Mo ju mo ju tu ru pe tu. (I know Mami is lonely)

Mami:
Now, now.

Madoka:
The Nightmares have gotten stronger recently, but I feel way safer fighting and now than I do before.
'Cause now we've got more girls on the team.
Plus, I get to work with my friends. And, that's always fun.

Mami:
Well, fighting Nightmares is not supposed to be fun, don't forget that.

Madoka:
Heh heh...

Mami:
I know what you mean, though.
Things are better now.
It's the kind of life I used to dream about that before I met all of you.
We are bound by a destiny of constant battling, to find any happiness of life like this is incredible.
I've never imagined it would be this way.

Homura:
Mami, may I trouble you for some more tea?

Mami:
Sure
Back in a bit.
I have to boil some more water, first.

Madoka:
What are you doing?
Is something wrong?

Homura:
I'm sorry, Madoka.

Bebe:
Mu ge!

Homura:
You can stop the charade now.

Bebe:
Mu be be? (What?)

Homura:
I remember what you're used to be.
You hear that?
I know what you really are.

Bebe:
Mu gyu?

Homura:
You altered our memories and trapped us in this fake Mitakihara City.
You can deny it all you want, Bebe.
But, this is your doing.

Bebe:
O tu be ko. (I don't know)

Homura:
What do you want with us?
Is this some kind of game to you?
Is this how you have fun?

Bebe:
Ju...be...

chapter 14:
Homura:
Memories are so annoying. As soon as I get one back, others come floating again one after the other.
Yes, I remember Mami Tomoe now.
She always troubles me.
She would put on a strong front and go all out.
But she has the softest heart of any of us.
Revealing the truth was always hard for her there.
Shadowing her optimism... It felt cruel, and it's hard to me.
I remember now, and I wish I could erase the memory of all the hearts I broke.

Bebe:
Me cya me cya be ko. (I don't know that)
Me cya bu... (I'm worried being grudged)

Homura:
Let's have it.
Why are you doing this to us.
Tell me right now, or I'll end you!

Bebe:
Me cha cha be cha... (Homura, I'm suffocating...)
Me cha bu ta ca mem bert... (I'm becoming cheese...)

Homura:
Huh!

Mami:
I was going to wait until I understood the situation.
But you were hurting Bebe, and I will not stand by and let that happen.

Homura:
You knew what I was up to...

Mami:
Yes, now explain yourself.
Why do you want to hurt Bebe?

Homura:
You're being deceived by her.
This is not a real Mitakihara City.
All memories are false. Non of this is real.

Mami:
Really now Homura? How can you say such things.

Bebe:
Mu cha ge!

Mami:
Hurry, Bebe, Run!

Bebe:
Mu cha ge!

Homura:
I suppose this means that you're going to protect that creature?

Mami:
I'm giving you the chance to walk away.
If you choose not to, you'll have to fight me.


Mami:
We know each other's moves too well.
But this rate do you think you can beat me?

Homura:
I can outlast you.
That's for sure!

chapter 15:
Mami:
Well, we aren't getting anywhere!
Ah! No, Stop! Homura!

Homura:
Huh?!

Mami:
Your magic is quite fearsome.
But in a fight, you are fool if you think you always have in upper hand.

Homura:
Please Mami, can you tell something's wrong?
Don't you feel anything strange about yourself?

Mami:
You could've killed me, but you didn't.
That must be you still have some regard for my well-being.
But still, you were trying to kill Bebe.

Homura:
Please try to remember! She's a witch.
The enemy of magical girls.

Mami:
I don't know what you're saying.
Witches are not our enemies, the wraiths are.

Homura:
...?

Mami:
...?
...That's right, wraiths.
...that's what I've been fighting.
But then... what are these Nightmares?

Mami:
Eh!?

Homura:
Ah!

Mami:
What is this?
What's going on?

Nagisa:
Please don't be mad, I can explain.

Mami:
Wait... who are you?
...Bebe?!

Nagisa:
I'm sorry I didn't say anything till now.
Mami, promise you won't get mad about what I'm going to tell you.

chapter 16:
Homura:
...What are you doing here?

Sayaka:
Honestly, what the heck are you thinking taking on Mami when she's in top form?
Either you've gotta lot of guts, or you're super dumb!

Homura:
I couldn't help getting into a fight with her.
I was defending myself.
I was really after...

Sayaka:
Bebe! ...Right?
Let me guess, you thought 'cause she used to be a witch, she's still that way.
...Jumped to conclusions much?

Homura:
Then... you remember!?

Sayaka:
Of course I do.
That's why I'm here.
Think about it, though.
Nothing about this makes sense.
I mean, why would've the witch could all the trouble of making the labyrinth,
big enough to hold the city, of all she's gonna do is keep us here?
She isn't trying to hurt us, and she's not luring new victims in either, right?
The Sweets Witches you remember wouldn't do that.
She'd not fuss about her first chance she's got, would she?
You would've realize that if you stop to think.
It's pretty obvious this labyrinth wasn't designed to lure people in.
The witch who made it once to maintain the status quo in here.
That's all what's going on.
The question is, who would want thing to keep going on like this? And why?
Start there, we're backwards at...
Running back at your own little time again, huh?
That's a bad habit of yours.
You count on that trick too much.

Homura:
You think the person who trapped us in here, might actually be one of us.
Right?

Sayaka:
Would it really be that surprising if it was?
Remember what Mami said, about her life now.
She said it's the happiest she's ever been.
So, you think she could be the witch?

Homura:
Well, a witch is the final form of a magical girl.
I don't know. Maybe she is, maybe she isn't.

Sayaka:
Humph, that sounds like something you'd say.
Well, I got you here.
Mind if I ask you something?
When you find the witch who made this labyrinth, what should you gonna do with her, Homura?

Homura:
Well, obviously...er?

Sayaka:
You what? Kill her?

Homura:
...

Sayaka:
Why? Because she is a witch?

Homura:
What are you getting at?

chapter 17:
Sayaka:
Humph.
...Is this still really so bad? I mean, really?
We don't have to kill anyone.
We just keep working together and having fun.
Is the person who wished for a life like that so evil
...that she deserves to die?

Homura:
...! Hold on.
Are you siding with a witch?

Sayaka:
Like you said, know what we become, then I figure out I sympathize with her.

Homura:
I just realize something.
A sort of crucial point on this.
The creatures Mami remembered fighting, were wraiths. Not witches.
And, Kyoko didn't understand the concept of the labyrinth when I mentioned it.
Not because they've forgotten about the witches, but because neither of them knew about them in the first place.
Which makes sense, since witches don't exist in this universe.
A magical girl's soul is supposed to be taken by the Law of Cycles before she becomes a witch.
That's a concept she created, when she remade the world ...what she sacrifices herself for.

Sayaka:
I knew it.
You remember her too, don't ya?

Homura:
Yes, I do!
And that's what bothers me!
I should be the only one...
There are three people in this world who don't belong in it.
The first one, is the witch who made the labyrinth.
The second one is Bebe who looks just like a witch.
And third one... is you, who remember these witches.
Who are you...?
Are you really Sayaka Miki?

Sayaka:
...Oh, come on.
I'm the same old Sayaka you've always known ...transfer student?


Homura:
...Your reflexes are impressive.
You certainly weren't this agile before.

Sayaka:
Whatever you do next, ask yourself this one question.
But, you'll be OK with destroying this version of Mitakihara City?
Think hard about that before you do anything.
Just so you don't regret it later.


Homura:
...This city is fake, and idealized the world someone dreamed up.


Children:
Fort! Da! Fort! Da! Fort! Da! Fort! Da!...
Fort! Da! Fort! Da! Fort! Da! Fort! Da!...

chapter 18:
Kyoko:
Mami needed a help in her city, so I came over.

Mami:
It's the life I used to dreamed about before I met all of you.

Sayaka:
Is this really so bad? I mean, really?

Homura:
Someone dragged us into this dream world...
A coward who's turned her back on her responsibility to fight to wraiths.
I can't forgive anyone who do something like that.
Magical girls must keep fighting ...always.
It's the price we've pay for our wishes.
Our fate was tragic... once.
But, she gave up to everything to change it.
This farce has wasted the sacrifice Madoka made for us.
...And, I won't allow it.

Child A:
Gott ist tot!

Child B:
Gott ist tot!

Child C:
Gott ist tot!

Child D:
Gott ist tot!

Child E:
Gott ist tot!

Madoka:
Hey, Homura!
Thank goodness, I've been looking for you.
Mami's worried about you, you know that?
What happened? You OK?

Homura:
...I'm OK.

chapter 19:
Madoka:
Hey, Homura. You really shouldn't go off by yourself like that.
If something's ever bugging you, you can always talk to me if you want.
I might not be able to help you much with your problems.
But it's way better than having to worry about them all by yourself, isn't it?
It hurts me to see you suffering so much.
And, all I wanna do is help.
I wish you would talk to me...

Homura:
I had a dream, and it scared me.

Madoka:
Why?

Homura:
In my dream, you went some place far away.
And, it was so far I wasn't gonna able to see you again.
And everyone forgot about you.
...No one remembered you except for me!
I was the only one in the world who could!
It was so, so mean...
It's sad.
And, no one understood how I felt!
I started to think all my memories of you...were just things I made up.
I thought I was grave crazy...!

Madoka:
You're right.
That dream does sound awful.
But it's OK now, really!
I'm not going anywhere, especially about so far away I couldn't see you again.
I'll never do something like that!

Homura:
You aren't...? But, how!? How can you be so sure...?

Madoka:
Fu fu... You know how wimpy I am?
If I did anything that make someone as strong as you cry like this, it would break my heart.

Homura:
...It will break your heart?
Leaving us behind will hurt you that much?

Madoka:
Of course it would!
I'd hate leave you and Sayaka.
Or Mami, and Kyoko...
Or my mom, dad, and Tatsuya...
Even Hitomi and all our friends in class, too!
I wouldn't go if I couldn't see you guys again.
I know I don't have the courage to do something like that, even if I didn't have a choice...

Homura:
You're right.
I know you weren't...!
( I knew what hurt you more than anything... but, still... How could have I been so stupid! I should've stop you back then... I should've stop no matter what I had to do...! I shouldn't have let that happen...!)
...Madoka.

Madoka:
Huh?

Homura:
I want you to know that when the time comes, and you have to make a hard decision.
You will have the courage to make it...!
One day... you'll find out there are the things only you can do...
And then, you'll know just how strong, and how kind you really are...
Believe me, it's the truth.

Madoka:
...Homura?

Homura:
Sorry, you probably don't remember anything either.
I know there's a chance you might just be an illusion.
Or, fake version of you someone created.
How else could we see each other again like this...!
Does it even matter...?
It does to me.
I can tell you are the real Madoka.
You are here and I can talk to you again.
And, feel your kindness one more time!
And, I was so happy!
Thank you...
I couldn't have ask for anything that will make me happier than I am right now.
...I have to go now, sorry.
But, there's something I have to do.

Madoka:
But, where are you going?


Homura:
...

Madoka:
...I wonder what's going on with Homura?

Kyubey:
Kyuu?


chapter 20:
Kyoko:
Hey, Homura. What's going on?

Homura:
I was wondering.
Do you remember... the witches?

Kyoko:
Hold up. Witches?
If I said I don't, is that something I should be worried about?

Homura:
No. You shouldn't remember them.

Kyoko:
Ugh...! What the hell is that mean!?
Are you messing with me?

Homura:
What about Madoka Kaname?

Kyoko:
Huh?

Homura:
Madoka. Do you remember her?

Kyoko:
Of course I remember her.
Shouldn't I?
...! Wait, I shouldn't!?

Homura:
No. If things were in order, you shouldn't remember her.
Those memories are false.

Kyoko:
Ha... This is like some kind of bad joke... for real.

Homura:
If I stopped and thought about from the start, it would be an obvious.
To create a world where Madoka exists.
Someone who have to know about Madoka to begin with.
I figured it out.
I know who rewrote our memories.
And, trapped this false Mitakihara-city.
I know who it is...

Kyoko:
What's wrong Homura!?
Tell me where you are!
Let me know, and I'll come get you!

Homura:
There's one last thing I have to confirm to be sure.
Don't worry. I can do this by myself.
And, if I'm right, I'll end everything.

Kyoko:
Wait! What!?

Homura:
I'm sorry I got you involved in this.

Homura:
( There's a limit to the distance my body can be away from my soul gem. At most, it should be one hundred meters... )

Children:
Fort! Da! Fort! Da! Fort! Da! Fort! Da!...

[Bus announce]:
Next stop, Mitakihara-city, Second Street.
Passengers bound for the elementary school, should disembark at next stop.
Stop requested.

Homura:
It's true...
I'm not a magical girl anymore.
How could this happen...?
How?
Why...?
Why would I end up with this...?
When did it even happen...!?
When did I... become a witch!?

chapter 21:
Child A:
Fort!

Child B:
Fort!

Child C:
Fort!

Child D:
Fort!

Child E:
Fort!

Kyubey:
I'm sure you didn't really want to know the truth.
And yet, you couldn't bare it if you didn't see get out.
Human curiosity's a quite fascinating ...and illogical.
Considering you were the one searching, I was certain you've done uncover the truth eventually, Homura Akemi.

Homura:
Incubator...
I should have known... this could only be your doing.

Kyubey:
Naturally, now collect me if I'm wrong.
But you're probably wondering where your body and your soul are.
Would you like to know?
Permit me to show you.

Kyubey:
This is out side the false Mitakihara-city.
This is the real you. And the real world.

Homura:
How...?

Kyubey:
Simple. We developed an isolation field to completely contain your soul gem.
We were curious to see what happened a tainted soul gem in a closed environment.
It have to be free from all extra influences, but the experiment wouldn't work.

Homura:
REALLY?

Kyubey:
What is it that cleanses magical girls, and make them vanished?
It's something you called the Law of Cycles.
Well, we wanted to know what happened to a soul gem when it's cut off from this phenomenon.
Thanks to you, we witnessed some very interesting results.
We observed the peculiar closed space.
One that could shape it's own reality.
As well as lure and trap victims.
...Now, collect me if I'm wrong.
But, I believe this is the power of that witch concept you explained to us before.
Your soul gem remains intact.
Preserved by the isolation field.
It's the only thing keeping you from completing your transformation into a witch.
Excuse the metaphor, but you're like a chick that wasn't able to break out it's shell.
And, matured inside it.
That's the reason you wound up to create a labyrinth internally, as supposed externally.
And these conditions, you managed to re-create the whole city inside your quote-unquote shell.
...In other words, this is the world inside your soul gem.

Homura:
Interesting theory.
But, if this labyrinth is isolated from the world, how could anyone be lured into it?
It's not possible!

Kyubey(s):
True, but we made a little adjustment!
The isolation field barrier only works in one direction.
Even though it repels interfere from the outside, we can allow victims to pass through.
But only if they were invited from with in.
And you did the inviting.
You unconsciously chose your targets.
Once you let them enter, they were trapped.
Even under these limited conditions, we surmised but if the entity you referred to us the Law of Cycles ever want to reach you, it could.
All that had happened for you to invited to the labyrinth.
Then, it would materialized in the form of one of your targets.
Once trapped, we incubators would finally be able to identify and observe it.
Then, we could find out what this karmic force is, that makes magical girls disappear.
There are several people within your labyrinth who don't exist in the real world.
And yet, they seemed have existed at the some point in time.
The most interesting of these, is a girl who isn't recorded in any past memory.
And, who isn't the future possibility either.
Even though, she doesn't exist within the karmic cycles of our universe, she was able to slip into your world without causing any disturbance.
We were fortunate we didn't have to spend too much time, and energy searching for it.
Who knows how long that would've taken.
But, you saved us the trouble, Homura Akemi.
Thanks to you referring the Law of Cycles as Madoka Kaname, we were able to identify it rather quickly.

Homura:
Then...that is her.

Kyubey:
If we were disappointed of anything, it would be that Madoka Kaname never displayed any sign of having unusual powers.
It seemed the memory rewritten performed by you, the master of the labyrinth, affected her as well.
She not only forgot the reason she entered, to save you, she also lost who she really was, and her capabilities.
So, we couldn't do anything to her.

Kyubey:
On one hand, Madoka Kaname forgot she was a god.
And in the other, you forgot you were a witch.
Because of that, we incubators could only watch as this pointless endeavor, and hold it.
We were fine, waiting patiently observing.
But, since you've discovered the truth, the delicate balance within your world has started to crumble.
Now, Homura Akemi, reach out the Madoka Kaname for a help.
If you do that, it will remember her who she really is.
And what's she came here to do.

Homura:
...Tell me what your real goal is, incubator.

Kyubey:
Of course, the Law of Cycles has been a hypothesis up to this point.
Now, we can observe it.

Homura:
For what purpose?
Satisfying curiosity is illogical.
You said so yourself.
So, I can't believe you go to such length just to confirm Madoka exists.

...You wanna control Madoka. Don't you!?

chapter 22:
Kyubey:
I won't deny with our end goal in this whole affair.
It would've been a long, and difficult to deliver though...
After all, this phenomenon has been complete mystery to us.
We can't very well interfere with something when we can't confirm for it's existence.

Homura:
I seriously doubt you give up trying, though.

Kyubey:
True. If we could observe it, we can interfere with it.
And, if we can interfere with it, we can control it.
The information we'd collect from that would allow us to conquer the Law of Cycles completely.
Then, we could make magical girls turn into witches.
And collect vast amount of energy all in one go.
Your hope and despair are the keys.
The phase change between those emotions creates huge amount of energy, more than we ever imagined.
You magical girls are the gateway to limitless possibilities.
In our humble opinion, you should all conclude your existence by transforming into witches.

Homura:
...

Kyubey:
Why are you angry?
This has nothing to do with you anymore.
Your existence has reached it's completion.
And now, at the end of your life, you obtained your wish to meet the one person you've waited so long for.
I should think you'd be happy about that.

Homura:
Hardly... I am anything... but happy.

Kyubey:
Wait! You can't be serious. You're creating a curse?
What do you thinking!?
It's spreading too fast to purify!

Homura:
As you are now, you won't know this.
But you see, the reason to choose I become a magical girl, was to save Madoka.
I stand by that choice.
You won't me to betray her.
But, I rather turn into a witch before I do.
And I will never let you incubators touch her again!

Kyubey:
You're willing to give up your salvation for her?
If you do, you'll spend the rest of eternity living among all these curses.

Homura:
Not at all.
In fact, I make sure this labyrinth will be my grave.
Mami Tomoe and Kyoko Sakura are both here.
I have faith in them.

Kyubey:
That's ridiculous!
Do you have any idea what would mean if you died inside the isolation field?
You won't be able to break out of the shell.
You'll transform into a witch inside it's egg.
If you tapped in there, the Law of Cycles won't sense you.
You'll be destroyed.
And, your soul, no one will able to save it from despair.
You'll lose your chance to see Madoka Kaname again forever!
You can't want that!

Homura:
Would you shut up already!?

Children:
Fort! Da! Fort! Da! Fort! Da!

Kyubey:
I can't believe you prefer the worst possible fate.

Children:
Fort! Da!

Kyubey:
Honestly, I can't comprehend why humans are so illogical...

Children:
Fort! Da! Fort! Da!


Homura:
...!
Er...? Madoka...?
Ah!
Ugh! ...Uh!

...So, this is being a witch.
My emotions have all come back to haunt me again.

I can't remember anything... anymore.
Just glimmers of light, and regret.
Yes...
This is it.
My despair...

Madoka! I just want to say. Thank you for coming here!
To this god-awful place!
I can't even say good bye to you in the end... I'm sorry!


chapter 23:
Mami:
That's... a witch?

Sayaka:
You don't have to be scared of her.
She looks horrible, but she's the one who suffering here...

Kyoko:
It's like a bad joke...

Kyubey:
Wait a moment!
That's Homura Akemi!
You're not really going to fight your friend, are you!?

Madoka:
Kyubey...?

Kyoko:
Humph.
I had no idea you could talk.

Mami:
It's unfortunate, Kyubey.
But, we have to trust that Bebe told us.

Kyubey:
Madoka, listen!
You have the power to save her!
All you have to do is acknowledge the real power inside you!

Madoka:
Huh...?

Sayaka:
Don't listen to him, Madoka.
It'll be fine.
You'll see, just do what her and I told you earlier.

Madoka:
O-okay...

Bebe:
Pa! pa pa pa pa pa pa-r-mi-gia-no re-ggia-no!


chapter 24:
Sayaka:
It's OK. Homura.
We're not gonna let you go on like this.
Promise!

Kyubey:
Wha...! Wh-what are you...?

Nagisa:
Sayaka and I once brought hope to the world.
We succumbed to despair and spread our curses...

Sayaka:
Thank to the Law of Cycles, me and her are working to free the world not just mean, once and for all.
You were so focused on Madoka.
You never noticed us!
Did you, incubator?
Keeping you in the dark, was the only way we could work without you interfering.

Kyubey:
So, the two of you are actually parts of the Law of Cycles?

Sayaka:
No, not exactly.
We're more like the private secretaries.
Our jobs are to hang on the all of Madoka's memories and powers, to the time came, give back to her.

Nagisa:
I'm Sayaka's backup, and she is mine.
If things went bad, on one of us two didn't make it, there'd always be someone to return Madoka's memories to her.

Sayaka:
Sending the three of us to any other but save Homura, seems like over kill to me.
She's keeping us on our toes. That's for sure.
Yeah, but it's for her own good.
So, it's worth a trip.
Besides, she fought her to keep the world safe.
So, saving her is at least we can do.

Madoka:
Sayaka...? Ah!?

Mami:
Come on! Madoka!
It's time we got to work!

Madoka:
Ah! Right!
...Ya!

Homura:
What are you doing!
Stop!
You don't understood!
I have to die here!

Sayaka:
Jeez! Homura!
Quit being so stubborn!
But hear to her so chill out already!

Kyoko:
Man! What the hell'd you guys gotten me into.
There you go.

Sayaka:
Nn-fu. Thanks a lot.
...er?

Kyoko:
I had a horrible dream about you last night.
You were... dead.
But, it wasn't a dream. It was real, wasn't it.
This, right here, us fighting side by side, this is the dream.
...Ain't it?

Sayaka:
It'd be sad if it were.
But it's not like that.
Not really.
I thought I didn't have any regrets when I died.
But the truth is... when I found out about this assignment, I jumped to the chance to come back.
Because, in the end, I did have one regret.
You. I missed you.

Nagisa:
Seriously!?
I came back because I wanted to eat cheese one more time!

Sayaka:
Oh... Thanks a lot!
Way too kill the mood!

Kyoko:
Heh...
You dummy!

Mami:
Tiro Finale!

Madoka:
Homura...!

Homura:
No! Madoka...!
Stop!

Nagisa:
There it is!
The incubator's seal!

Sayaka:
Homura!
Once we bust that seal open, you'll be free!
If the incubators don't have a hold on you, you can reach to outside world!
And see the real Madoka again!


chapter 25:
Homura:
Ah!...

Madoka:
Please, Homura. Stop.
I told you, you shouldn't go off by yourself.

Homura:
Madoka...

Madoka:
Whatever happens to you, good or bad, you're still you.
And I would never abandon you.
So, don't give up.
Have faith!

Homura:
Hic... I'm sorry!
I'm so... weak.
I just wanted you to put with me.
I didn't care what I had to do...
I'll commit the worst sins for one more chance...
Even if it turned me into a monster!
It wouldn't matter...
As long as I could have you back...

Madoka:
Let's end this together.
You ready?

Homura:
Uh-huh...


chapter 26:
Madoka:
You're not scared, are you?

Homura:
Nh-nn, I'm fine. I'm not afraid.
...I'm ready.

Kyubey(s):
This is so illogical!


Kyoko:
Sayaka and Bebe...
They're gone? Just like that?

Mami:
Not yet.

Kyoko:
Huh?

Mami:
They're helping Madoka take Homura away.

Kyoko:
Is that... Madoka Kaname?

Mami:
Yes. She is the Law of Cycles.
And one day, she'll take us too.

Madoka:
I remember... the reason I'm here... is to get Homura back.
I can't believe I forget something so important.

Sayaka:
Well, you did have some unnecessary interferes.
What a trip, talk about spinning our wheels.

Nagisa:
That was kind of annoying.

Madoka:
You waited for me, all this time.
I'm sorry it took so long. But, I'm here now.

Homura:
Madoka...

Madoka:
Come on. Let's go.
From now on, we'll be together.

Homura:
You don't know how long... I've waited...
...For this.

Madoka:
Ah! ...Homura?

Homura:
Now, I've got you!

Kyoko:
What's going on!?

Mami:
What is she think she's doing?
Homura!?

Nagisa:
Look at her soul gem!
What are those horrible colors!

Sayaka:
It's not the curse! What is that!?
...Obsession? Desire?
Homura! What's happening to you!?

Homura:
I don't expect you to understand.
No one in the world could possibly understand.
This emotion is mine, and mine alone...
And, I've been saving it for her.

Madoka:
Homura... Don't...!
Don't let me apart!

Homura:
It has to be this way.
I never going to let you go again, Madoka...?


Kyubey:
The world is being rewritten...
Does this mean the new principles has been born into this universe?

Homura:
You don't remember the last time this happen, do you?
Well, this is the second time I've seen this.

Kyubey:
What's happening?
Homura Akemi, what are you meddling in?
You're changing something. But, what?

Homura:
Heh...

Kyubey:
I don't believe it.
Your tainted soul gem should've disappeared with your soul.
But it hasn't. Why?

Homura:
Because... I remembered why every repeated time.
And suffered over and over again...
My feelings for Madoka...
They laid so deep, even pain has become precious to me...
And as for my soul gem... a curse isn't what's tainting it.

Kyubey:
Then, what is...?

Homura:
Something you cant understand, Incubator.
It is the chemical of all human emotion.
More passionate than hope...
Much deeper than despair...
...Love.

Kyubey:
Then...What are you...?
You're not a magical girl anymore, but you are not transformed into a witch either!

Homura:
You're right!
I'm not a magical girl, or a witch.
Madoka... is a sacred as a god...
And I pulled her from heaven.
So, if you want to know what I become...
I suppose, if anything you can call me a demon, though.

Kyubey:
There's no doubt now.
Trying to put human emotion to use is just too dangerous for us.
We could never hope to control something whose final form is so irrational.

chapter 27:
Homura:
Is that so?
The curses outspread across our world still have to be dealt with.
And you incubators have become necessary for that task.
You're going to stay and help.
...Incubator?


Mami:
Eh...!?

....

Kyoko:
Munch, munch... huh?

...

Sayaka:
Hey! Do you have any idea what you've done?

Homura:
I do. But, if you like to share your thoughts, please, enlighten me.

Sayaka:
Okay. You broke up the piece of the Law of Cycles.
It's the only salvation us magical girls had!

Homura:
I've only took a tiny sliver of it. That's all.
The piece that used to be Madoka, before she ceased to exist.
For some reason, you're all pulled in with her. And now, you can't returned to you came from either.

Sayaka:
You have no right to screw up like this!

Homura:
...I'm the existence called evil now, and if evil is supposed to disrupt divine, and be a force of chaos?
It's only natural for me to upset the laws of a god.

Sayaka:
Well, yeah? What are you doing next? Destroy everything?

Homura:
After all the wraiths have been wiped out, perhaps I will.
When that day comes, I suppose I can be your enemy, then.
The question is, will you be able to stand up against me?
You are having a hard time remembering things, aren't you?

Sayaka:
Ah...!
I---I think I remember being part of something...
Some kind of "Being," where power bigger than this world...
But, I---I can't remember what it was any more...
All I know is I'm not supposed to be here...?

Homura:
You're getting another chance to being human again.
If anything, you should be happy about that.
Eventually, life here will seem natural to you.
And, you'll forget all about the past.

Sayaka:
...Even if I do, there's one thing I won't forget.
You, Homura Akemi, are demon!

Homura:
We should pretend to be on good terms.
If you're always attacking me---Madoka might end up hating you...

chapter 28:
Nagisa:
Haay!

Kyosuke:
Hey, Sayaka. How are you doing?

Hitomi:
Good morning Sayaka, sleep well?

Sayaka:
Eh... yeah. Sorry.
Hey guys! How's it going? W-what's up?

Kyosuke:
Are... you OK, Sayaka?

Sayaka:
Heh heh, yeah, I'm fine!
It's just... I don't know, I guess, when I saw you guys, and heard you both say "good morning" again...
I guess---I guess, it's super happy! That's all.

Hitomi:
Oh, Sayaka. Sometimes you say most mysterious things!

Sayaka:
Yup! That's me!
The original international girl of mystery!
Heh heh heh...


Ms. Saotome:
Remember girls!
Do not associate with men who refused eat eggs unless they've been half boiled!
And, you boys better make sure you don't go up to be men who complain about how the done egg pouch! Understand!
Now then, that's out of the way.
Let's give a big welcome to our new classmate!
Miss. Kaname, come on in!

Students:
Wow...!

Madoka:
Um... My name is Madoka Kaname.
It's nice to meet you.
Er, I'm... I'm sorry, I mean, my mother, she was transferred to U.S.
So, we had to move there.
We lived there for three years.
And, just moved back.
And... now then, we're back.
I'll be starting school here today.
And, eh... It's... It's nice to met you!

Ms. Saotome:
Since she's been out of the country for so long, she might need some help, adjusting.
So, let's all pitch in and help her out, OK?


Girl A:
Hey, I was wondering.
What was going to school like in America!?

Girl B:
Was it cool over there?
I bet it was, huh?
I wish I could go...

Girl C:
You're so teeny and cute!
You're look like a grade-schooler!

Madoka:
Tee hee hee...
Jeez, thanks. But, I'm not that teeny...

Homura:
You guys, can't you see you are making her nervous bombarding her with questions?
Why don't you get her a moment?

Girl A:
Oh, yeah... eh, sorry about that...

Madoka:
eh...

Homura:
I'm Homura Akemi. Nice to meet you. Miss. Kaname?
...May I call you Madoka, instead?

Madoka:
Ah...um...sure.

Homura:
If you don't mind, I'd like to show you the campus now.
Follow me, please?


Madoka:
um... Miss. Akemi? I, er...

Homura:
Call me Homura.

Madoka:
eh... Homura, I, eh, how, I mean...
---why are you showing me around?

Homura:
How does it feel to be back again?

Madoka:
Oh, well, I guess... everything feels familiar.
And, at the same time, it's different.
It feels strange.

Homura:
I'm not surprised. It's been three years.

Madoka:
( No... It feels like nothing's changed at all... In fact, if anything's changed around here... it's me... )

Homura:
...!

Madoka:
Yeah... It is me...
I should have a different form...
a different purpose here...
So, why...?

Homura:
!

Madoka:
...!
Homura!?
Hey! Let go!

Homura:
It's OK.
You're exactly what you should be... what you've always been.

Madoka:
Huh...?

Homura:
Madoka Kaname, do you treasure the world you live in?
Or, would you break it's laws to follow your heart?

Madoka:
Well, I... I, er... I don't... I, I mean, yes.
I do treasure this world.
But, I don't think a person should going to break the rules, just because they feel like it...

Homura:
Ah, I see...
Well, then, I suppose one day... you'll also be my enemy.
It's fine. I don't care.
I'll keep wishing for a world where you can be happy.

Madoka:
Homura...?

Homura:
I knew it.
They always did look better on you.

Madoka:
...?
