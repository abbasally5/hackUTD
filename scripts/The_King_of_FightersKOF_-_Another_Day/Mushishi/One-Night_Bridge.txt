  -opening-
I walked ten thousand miles, ten thousand miles to see you.
And every gasp of breath, I grabbed it just to find you.
I climbed up every hill to get to you.
I wandered ancient lands to hold just you.
And every single step of the way, I paid.
Every single night and day I searched for you.
Through sand storms and hazy dawns I reached for you.

Zen:
It's just a little further, Hana?

Hana:
Um.

Zen:
We're almost there.
Hana!

Ginko:
This bridge maybe old but it has a lot of character.
And it's the only way over, guess I'll have to cross it.
Oh! Seems about to collapse.
Ah... that was close.
Um?
I assume you live around here?

Zen:
That's right!

Ginko:
This bridge won't hold much longer.
And I'm going to need it to get back across.

Zen:
I see.
Yeah, you're right, we have to get it fixed.
How long will you (be) here?

Ginko:
Well, to be honest, I don't know for sure.
I'm trying to find the woman who sent this letter.
Do you know her?

Zen:
Yeah.

Hana's mother:
Thank you so much for coming.
Please, come in, have a seat.
This is my daughter, Hana.
Three years ago, she fell from the bridge just outside the village.
As you can see, she survived, but she's never been the same.
All she does is sit around outside in a daze.
I've taken her to see several doctors, and they all say the same thing.
There's no sign of head injury, no one knows why she's like this.

Ginko:
Hmm?
You're still here?

Zen:
Yeah, so, how's Hana?
Did you see her?

Ginko:
Oh, do you know that girl?
Are you two friends?

Zen:
We were...
The reason she's like that...is my fault.
I beg you, would you please help her?

Ginko:
Take me to the bottom of the valley down there.
And then, tell me everything you know about what happened when Hana fell.

Zen:
Come on, Hana, don't cry.

Hana:
An arranged marriage from the main house, what am I supposed to do now?

Zen:
If you refuse it, they'll cut off the support to our village, we can't have that.
Right, like they'd let you refuse.
Let's run away.

Hana:
Zen, no!
If we did that, both of our families would be ostracized from the village.

Zen:
My parents would understand, I know it.
And I'm certain if your parents really want you to be happy, then I know that they would understand, too.
Hana, we'll never be together if we stay.
Let's leave this village and cross the mountains, we'll find somewhere beautiful to live together!
Hana! Please! Do it for us.

Zen:
Careful, it's weak there, okay?

Hana:
Zen...

Zen:
What's the matter?

Hana:
I can't do it...
I, I don't think we can ever be happy...knowing what our families will go through.

Zen:
Hana...

Hana:
I can put up with the way things are, as long as I know that you'll love me forever.
You will, won't you?
And even if I have to hide my true feelings, I'll always love you.
Nothing that happens will ever change that.

Zen:
But Hana, I don't want that!
Come on, let's cross the bridge and get out of here.
Please, Hana!
Hana!!

Man:
Find her?

Man:
No...

Zen:
No one could've survived a fall from that height.
Yet Hana came back, walking on her own two feet.
But she was different, empty, a shell of what she used to be.
After that, people were saying that she had become a tani-modori.

Ginko:
Tani-modori?

Zen:
It means one who returns from the valley.
Every once in a great while, someone falls into the valley and comes back , but without their souls.
Then, on the night when the "One-Night Bridge" appears, they die.
It's just a legend really.

Ginko:
The One-Night Bridge?

Zen:
Some people say that they've seen a mysterious bridge that appears for just one night.
But no one's spoken of it in a long long time.
Something wrong?

Ginko:
No...
Looks like it's here.

Zen:
What's here?

Ginko:
The same things that have taken over Hana.

Zen:
Taken over?!
What are you talking about?

Ginko:
By rope-like mushi called Nise-kazura.

Zen:
Mushi? What are they?

Ginko:
They're difficult for most people to see.
Hmm, awfully weak for Nise-kazura.
But they don't break if you pull them in the opposite direction, just like the ones I've read about.
Emm? The sunlight's not shining through?
They're gathering at the remaining sunlight.
This place doesn't get sufficient light from the sun.

Zen:
How'd it go?
Did you learn anything?

Ginko:
This might be difficult for you...

Zen:
Huh?!

Ginko:
I think the tani-modori and the One-Night Bridge might not be just legends.
Both of them can be explained by the Nise-kazura.
Usually, the Nise-kazura live in the tops of trees.
But the ones live in this valley, by taking over the bodies of living beings, most likely in an attempt to leave this place.
They need sunlight in order to survive.
But they lack the ability to climb out of the valley on their own.
So they reside in the bodies of animals to get more sunlight and build up their strength.
Once enough of them have done so, they leave the bodies of their hosts , gather a herd, and begin to migrate, far away, to a place more suitable for them.
That's probably what the One-Night Bridge is.
I've heard a similar story once before...
A valley where there's a crossing of mushi once every 20 years.

Zen:
Then, why?
Why is that the tani-modori always have to die?
I mean shouldn't they just return to normal once the mushi leave their bodies?

Ginko:
I've searched this valley, there're no animal bones here.
It's likely that the Nise-kazura are living in bodies of the dead as well.
If that's the case, once they leave the body, all that would remain would be the corpse.

Zen:
No, it's not true, that means that Hana...
It's this year!
The last time that someone saw the bridge was the same year that my grandpa turned 40... his 60th birthday is this year!
Is there any way to delay it?!

Ginko:
Not likely.

Zen:
But there must be something you can do!
I'm not asking you to return her to the way she was before.
I just want her to live a little bit longer, please.

Hana's mother:
You don't mean...

Ginko:
I'm afraid so.
By remaining as she is, she stands the best chance of prolonging her life.

Hana's mother:
But this mushi, it is possible to remove it, right?

Ginko:
It is.
But as I said before, doing so would most likely lead to her death.

Hana's mother:
Then just do it!
Do you think she's happy living this way?!
Even if it's just a remote chance, it's worth trying.

Ginko:
But there's no need to do anything that drastic.
If she somehow managed to survive the fall three years ago, then she'll return to normal once the One-Night Bridge appears.

Hana's mother:
How can you say that?
There's no way to prove that this bridge really even exists.
If Hana returns to normal, she has a good marriage offer waiting for her.
I can't keep the other family waiting any longer!

Ginko:
I'm sorry.
But I can not do this.
I know she's not the same person she was before, but whatever she is, she's alive.
I will not treat her like a thing.

Zen:
What do you know.
Hey, Ginko.

Ginko:
Zen, good to see you.

Zen:
Leaving already?

Ginko:
Oh, I'd like to.

Zen:
Don't worry, I should have the bridge fixed by tomorrow afternoon.
You can stay with me tonight.

Ginko:
So, you live alone out here?

Zen:
My family has a home in the village, but as for myself, I was banished from that placeï¼Œ people around here want nothing to do with me.

Ginko:
Have you ever thought about moving away from here?

Zen:
Sure.
I've thought about that before, but this is when my Hana lives.
If she happens to die, I'm sure I'll be leaving not too long after.

Ginko:
What was that noise?

Man:
So it finally fell.
Well, maybe it's because you wanna cross it.
Other than you, no one's gonna cross recently.

Ginko:
Whatever, so how long will it take to fix it?
Please let it be soon.

Man:
It's hard to say, really.
We'll have to work on it in our spare time.
Tough luck, I hope you won't in a hurry.

Ginko:
Damn it.
This is just great.

Hana's mother:
Zen!
Zen!
I know that you've been hiding that mushi-master here.
He and I have some unfinished business.

Ginko:
Oh, you're kidding me!
Huh? That's another tani-modori.
Then there could be more of them around here.

Zen:
Hana?!
What's wrong? Where're you going?
Hana...
You're warm...
And you're still alive...aren't you?
Right , Hana?
You are still alive, I knew it.
You've just forgotten everything.

Man:
Over there!

Hana's mother:
Hana!
Zen?! What do you think you're doing?!
I told you not to ever come near her again!
Hana?!
She's not breathing.
Hana! No, Hana!

Ginko:
Zen! What happened?

Zen:
It's Hana...She just died.
Some kind of black thread... came out the back from her neck.

Ginko:
I see...
It's time, come with me, leave this place.
There's nothing left in here now.

Zen:
But...

Ginko:
The One-Night Bridge, I think it's happening tonight.
We should be able to cross it from this side.
This entire area is is full of Nise-kazura, they've gained enough strength that even you should be able to see them.
You have to decide before midnight.
If we miss this chance, there's no telling when the next one will be.
You came... There's no turning back.
If you try to, you'll fall.
Don't worry. We'll make it.

Zen:
Yeah... he's right.
No turning back.
Once I leave this place, I can put everything that happened here behind me.

Ginko:
Hey, what's wrong?
What're you doing?
I told you, you can't go back!

Zen:
I can't go on... the one who was Hana is right here...

Ginko:
Listen to me!
Hana died three years ago!
That wasn't her!

Zen:
No, you're wrong.
The thought that kept me going, knowing that she was alive these past three years.
It was hard to see her like that, like she was empty inside, but now after everything that's happened, I think it was better that way.
I won't step on her, I can't go on.

Ginko:
Zen, no!
I do not know exactly what happened to him after that night on the bridge.
But in all probability...

Man:
Huh?

Ginko:
It will be another 20 years before that bridge will span the valley again.
A bridge that appears for just one night.
