  Lunar:
My heart beats a symphony. Your love inspires me. That’s how I know I’ll be with you one day…No matter how far, our hearts will never stay apart. Your love pulls me close to you…It’s your gravitation…

MC:
That was Lunar! With her heart stopping single “Gravitation”!

Lunar:
Thank you everybody! 

Lunar [in mind]:
Everyone adores our songs…what a wonderful feeling!

Nagasumi:
I love you Lunar!

Lunar [in mind]:
That’s right, humans! Bow down before the power of our songs!


Narrator:
Beneath the gently rolling waves of the Seto Inland Sea, young Nagasumi's life is saved and forever changed.But as with any debt, this one too must be repaid.So a story begins.Please humor them with a smile for young love is never easy...


Lunar:

Kamata:
Very good work today, Lunar.

Lunar:
Yes? Ooh thank you very much…Oh, it's just my manager and not entering fan…At least knock next time, would ya?!

Kamata:
Lunar, you have a full schedule of commercials and recording tomorrow. So try to get to bed early tonight. You do need your sleep.

Lunar:
Yeah…

Kamata:
And honey, one other thing as well. It’s just something that the don…It’s something that the “company president” told me…

Lunar:
Papa, huh?

Kamata:
That friend of yours from childhood…What was her name again? Oh yes! Sun from the Seto gang! Well, it seems she moved to Saitama. Maybe it'd be good for you to pay her a visit sometimes or sooner? Why wouldn’t you like to say “Hi” to your old friend Lunar?

Lunar:
Kamata, I need you to cancel all of my appointments for tomorrow…

Kamata:
Yes, of course…AGH! Wait, Lunar! What’s gotten into you?!

Lunar:
Sun Seto…!

[At the childhood]

Lunar:
This is not so very romantics to be…Love is worth the risk because we have nothing but to loose…Because everything but gives us in return…Thank you! Bye now!

[Outside the party hall]

Lunar:
Hahahahaha…A mermaid’s true weapon is her voice! Her sweet song! A good voice is the greatest badge of pride! And there’s no mermaid anywhere out there who can sing better than Lunar Edomae!

Waitress:
I don’t know what it is…But that kid got one creepy laugh…

Yakuza:
There’s another girl singing! Listen to her!

Sun:
Mo-motaro-san Mo-motaro-san…Can you share your dumplings? Will you share them with me…?

Yakuza:
I don’t understand… what this girl is doing to me…I can’t stop crying!

Yakuza:
Yeah… it's tearing the wound deep inside of me…

Yakuza:
Her voice is so sweet and innocent! I can’t sing it! (--take it?)

Yakuza:
Oh, sure they will you do little Sun! Maybe we should all try to be more like to share our dumplings…

Yakuza:
I’ve never heard another child sing as well as Lunar before

Yakuza:
And the winner of the night singing contest is…Sun! From the Seto gang!


Lunar:
Someone who thinks they can sing better than us can not be tolerated! We’ll teach you…Sun Seto!


Chimp:
I can’t believe Sun made us go home without her…They sucks!

Nagasumi:
She said that she was going to be helping out the class rep. So, we just have to accept it.

Chimp:
And you didn’t volunteer to help them out?

Nagasumi:
No, they said they were setting up for tomorrow’s health class.

Chimp:
Now that I wouldn't mind helping with. Think of all the cool secret you learn about girl’s bodies there…

Nagasumi:
Oh! I almost forgot!

Chimp:
You bring a crap on the stick! This is Lunar’s souvenir you can only get at concerts! But…but how did you get this?! How?! How?!

Nagasumi:
Oh, I got it yesterday when I went to watch her tape a concert for TV.

Chimp:
You mean you won a ticket?! No one gets those?! Do you know how lucky you are?! You’ve been truly quest! You’re Unicorn?!

Nagasumi:
You can keep that little token. Your portion might couldn’t get to see Lunar performing live…

Chimp:
You think maybe you’re letting this go to your head huh, kid?

Nagasumi:
She is seems so well! But she has got such an amazing personality as too!

Chimp:
I know! She is so sweet and humble in the face of great success!

Nagasumi:
I’m going to her next concert also, and I’ll have a good seat this time!

Chimp: Now you hold on a second there! Could you’ve been saying that after all what will Sun think about it huh? You’re living with the girl that cute and your eyes still roaming as she is not enough for you?

Nagasumi:
It has nothing to do with Sun!

Chimp:
No? I beg the difference.

Nagasumi:
Sun is a real girl and Lunar is a famous pop star! You can’t possibly quaint the two!

Chimp:
Oh, I see how it is. So you’ve rationalized your betrayal. What a thoughtful guy you are Nagasumi.

[Rain falls]

Nagasumi:
Ugh… where did the all this rain come from?

Chimp:
See ya! I’m gonna go home now!

Nagasumi:
Yeah, okay! I’ll see you later!

[Near the home]

Nagasumi:
Huh? What’s that? Hey! Are you all right Miss? Can I help? What haaaaaa?! There is some merchant mermaid collapse in the street who I don’t even know!

Lunar:
Stupid rain storm came out of nowhere…

Nagasumi:
Oh, good. So she is alive… LaLaLaLuLuuuuu?!

Lunar:
You saw me!

Nagasumi:
The merchant mermaid is really Lunar?!

Lunar:
NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!

Nagasumi:
This is insane! What is Lunar doing here?! Okay, better question… Lunar is a mermaid?!

[Collapse]

Nagasumi:
That was the mermaid ultra-sonic wave… it’s a heck…

Lunar:
We are impressed you know something like that.

Guard:
What’s going on?!

Guard: You okay?! The rain came so sudden. What you say Ms. Lunar? Did this human has seen something?

Lunar:
He saw our true form! Bob! Michael! We’ll need to take this human back with us!

Bob & Michael: Yes Ms. Lunar!

Nagasumi: Not good! I remember have been kidnapped like this before… Uh, ah…

Lunar:
What is it?

Nagasumi:
Should I assume that I’m going to be killed now that I’ve seen your mermaid form?

Lunar:
My… you do catch on quickly…

Nagasumi:
Why is this keep happening to me…?

Sun:
Stop it now! You’re talking about the horrible stuff like killing right in front of my own house… So now what’s all the fuss about?!

Lunar:
My… the rain stopped suddenly as it started…

Sun:
Ah…

Lunar:
Long time no see… Sun Seto!

Sun:
Ugh… I recognize you… you’re Lunar Edomae…

Lunar:
That’s right! Your fearsome rival, your arch nemesis the famous singer Lunar Edomae has come to pay you a visit, Sun!

Sun:
Wow! It was so long, Lunar!

Lunar:
AGH! Don’t hug us so familiarly! So, when the hell did you arrived here?! Your respectful mermaid would have come to see us long before now!

Sun:
Oh, sorry, lots of stuff happened and I kinda forgot about you…

Guard:
Ooh! Hey look! It’s the pretty little singer from the Yakuza Singing Contest!

Sun:
Give back Nagasumi now please?

Guard:
Oh yes, of couse! Here! HAHAHAHAHA…

Sun: HAHAHAHAHA…

Lunar: I’ll have you now that we never once forget about you, Sun! We remember what you did to us!

Nagasumi:
This goes a bit different from the Lunar that I’ve seen…




-----[added below but need to be fixed]-----


Lunar: 
You certainly seem used to drying after fillets, human?

Nagasumi:
You have no idea…

Lunar:
Now, there's something I'd like to know about.
What sort of relationship do you have with this human.

He saw your form, then you agree to marry him?!
Impossible… How could a noble mermaid agree to marry a lowly human?!

Sun:
But there is a really good story about a mermaid marryin' human.

Lunar:
That story is fiction and doesn't end well.
Why can't we just get rid of? Kill him already!

Sun:
You know, Lunar, you kind of mean!

Nagasumi:
That's exactly why Sun took me into her family to avoid either of us been killed.

Lunar:
A-ha, and your point is?

Nagasumi:
So I won't let you kill me, Lunar.
I'll do whatever I can do to stop you and I won't cool down without a fight.
I owed it that much. My life belongs completely to Sun now.

Sun:
Thank you, Nagasumi.
What is it?

Lunar:
We lost to Sun in the singing contest… every single time!
To Us, singing was everything!
To her, singing was nothing but silly [ ws:start:WikiTextUserlinkRule:00:[[user:Enirin]]  ws:end:WikiTextUserlinkRule:00 ]
To prove that we are better than Sun, we dedicated all of our life to singing.
we even entered the entertainment industry and struggle long and hard.
Clawing our way to the top, and we came to hard the front of musical success!
That girl… that girl! She turns on [ ws:start:WikiTextUserlinkRule:01:[[user:Enirin]]  ws:end:WikiTextUserlinkRule:01 ] this human boy our face!
Why… Sun! Why do you always make us fell bad about we don't have… huhhhh?!

Nagasumi:
What do you mean what you don't have?!

Lunar:
In that case, Sun. We will take him! We will take the husband of yours!
He saw us on true mermaid form after all. His putty life is all right for property.

Nagasumi:
ohh I don't like this all. not good!

Lunar:
That's right.. We will steal Sun's happiness! You are ours, human!
Just imagine for the rest of your life. You'll be a personal manservant my darling boy.

Nagasumi:
a ah… I don't like this all not much and then…

Sun:
I'll teach you trying take what's mine.
I'm with Nagasumi long time before you did, Lunar.
You better back off right now!

Lunar:
Now, now, Isn't it a question of acnology, is it?
It doesn't matter who got him first. We just do offering to help out.
We can protect him.

Sun:
I refuse your offer. I'm gonna be the one who protect him. You see?

Lunar:
Let's go manservant!

Sun:
Nagasumi lives with me!

Nagasumi:
No way! Can be true. This girl wasn't Lunar. Lunar is sweet and modest and quiet!

Lunar:
A manservant has no home his own.

Sun:
He is not a manservant!

Lunar:
well then I guess so just have to die!

Sun:
Lunar you taking just [ ws:start:WikiTextUserlinkRule:02:[[user:Enirin]]  ws:end:WikiTextUserlinkRule:02 ]


Lunar:
Sun you blood! I see you're just as aggressive and obstinate as over huh?

Sun:
You're the one to talk, Lunar?!

Lunar:
I guess a woman who comes all the way to Saitama to get married hasn't found it yet!
Well ok! We will show you freaking fight too!
Starting today, we will live in this house and we will be charged then you realized we are the master what we say. Just try and save us.

Sun:
Bring it on! you cow!

Nagasumi:
Now, just no way. Lunar's something like this girl. that's what just be silly …ahaha.
