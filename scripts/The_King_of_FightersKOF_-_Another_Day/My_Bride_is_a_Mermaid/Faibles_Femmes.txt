“Don’t trust the stranger and then assume they don’t trust you”.

Mawari:

Nagasumi:
Nagasumi barrier! Oh… that hurt…

Mawari: 
Nagasumi! That isn’t fair! 

Nagasumi:
My Nagasumi barrier…

Mom:
The next one is “Aim to be better…

Nagasumi:
This one’s mine!

Mawari:
No way! It’s mine!! I can’t let you have this card.

Nagasumi:
Mawari, that’s not fair… play by the rules…

Mawari:
This is my favorite card at above all of them! I can’t ever let anyone else have it no matter what!

Mom:
I can see why Mawari, that cad’s basically your life’s goal isn’t that shall?

Mawari:
Ah hah, yes absolutely! I know that someday… I’m gonna be a great Super Intended General! Just like my dad!


Narrator:
Beneath the gently rolling waves of the Seto Inland Sea, young Nagasumi's life is saved and forever changed. But as with any debt, this one too must be repaid. So a story begins. Please humor them with a smile for young love is never easy...


Dad:
Haghhh… good morning dear… Uh? Ah… honey?

[Past time]

Mom:
Yeah?

Dad:
Oh, nothing… I was just… dreaming a bit…

Mom:
About what?

Dad:
About us. You and I are living in a house of our own… complete with the thirty year mortgage.

Mom:
A nice steady grown up life huh? That just isn’t exactly sound like you…

Dad:
You never know… People do change after all. Maybe it will sound like me someday…

Mom:
You’re sounding like an old man. Are you okay?

Dad:
Haha… Corny I know… But it was just a dream. What can I say?

Mom:
It’s not such a bad dream… 

Dad:
Oh? 

Mom:
Well, it means we will get together forever right? 

Dad:
Hahahaha… Silly girl…


Sun: 
Is that you, father?

Dad:
Huh? 

Sun:
Good morning. Hope you slept well.

Dad:
Oh yes Sun, I slept very well! Thank you good morning.

Mom:
What are you standing there, talking at?

Dad:
Oh, hi honey… So there you are, haha…

Mom:
Don’t sound too much excited to see me.

Dad:
Sorry. I was just daydreaming a little bit… About being young…

Mom:
So you are like steering at young girls and daydreaming do you?!

Dad: 
That’s not what I saying! Don’t take it wrong!

Mom:
Just what so great about you?!

Dad:
Just I was looking back!

Nagasumi:
Good morning…

Mom:
Tell me what is wrong, Nagasumi!

Nagasumi:
I think she is never hesitating!

Sun:
Oh, hey there Nagasumi, good morning.
