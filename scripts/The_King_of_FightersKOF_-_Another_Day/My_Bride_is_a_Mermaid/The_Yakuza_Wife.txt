  Nagasumi:
Ah!
Somebody...
Help me!
Somebody... uh... help me...
Oh, God! I'm gonna drown!
I can't hold my breath any longer!
Dammit! I'm drowning!
Somebody... help me... please...
A... mermaid?

Narrator:
Beneath the gently rolling waves of the Seto Inland Sea, young Nagasumi's life is saved and forever changed.
But as with any debt, this one too must be repaid.
So a story begins.
Please humor them with a smile for young love is never easy...

-- OP --

Nagasumi:
Hey, Dad. Aren't we there yet?

Dad:
Hm?

Mom:
Hm?

Nagasumi:
You don't actually have to answer that.
I just wanted you to know how board I am.

Dad:
What's wrong with you?
You're too young to be board.

Mom:
Can't you even sit still for ten minutes?
You're just so restless.

Nagasumi:
Oh, I guess I take after my parents.

Dad:
Just try to relax.
We should be there any minute now.

Nagasumi:
Summer vacation and here I am.
Nagasumi Michishio start visiting my grand mother.
Well, and there she lives by the Seto Inland Sea.

Nagasumi:
Whoa, what?!
You kidding me. There's only one bus every hour?!

Dad;
You surprised, city boy?

Nagasumi:
That's really not very convenient, and they don't even run the bus during the evening!

Dad:
And that's just the way we liked around here.
But I guess a city boy from Saitama wouldn't understand our easy going life style.

Nagasumi:
Are you gonna call me city boy the whole trip?

Mom:
Ignore him. He's just a little excited to be back.

Nagasumi:
Hey, Dad.

Dad:
Huh?

Nagasumi:
Weren't we driving right next the sea a minute ago?

Dad:
Yup. It's just beyond the trees there.
Seto is nothing but mountains and water. Not much in between.

Nagasumi:
The road's kinda narrow.
It looks like we're gonna fall off!

Mom:
I guess it has been a while since your last visit.
You were only about four or five years old.

Nagasumi:
Yeah. I don't remember much about it.


Nagasumi:
Grandma, was that right?

Grandma:
You betcha!
That made your grandpa happy.

Nagasumi:
Oh, good...

Grandma:
I'm so sorry you had to make dinner after comin' all this way.
What kind of hostess makes a guest to the cooking?

Mom:
Oh, don't worry about it, Mother!
It's my pleasure.
I only wish that we could make it out here to visit you more often.

Dad:
Yeah, my job's pretty stretching with my time off.

Grandma:
Well, you don't have to bring your sinking husband with you.
You and Nagasumi can come on out any time you want.

Mom:
Hahaha.

Dad:
Geez, Mom. It's sure good to see you too!

Mom:
Well, Nagasumi's in school, today's actually the first day of the vacation.

Grandma:
I know. I know.

Nagasumi:
Can't we just forget about school while we're here?

Mom:
Thanks to his grade, he's spent the last month in summer school.

Dad
You're lucky we decided to wait, to not leave without you.

Nagasumi:
Oh, thanks. I love you two.

Mom:
He's not the world's greatest student.

Grandma:
That's nuffin'.
I hardly doubt you could be any more lousy of a student than your father was.
And yet here he is, still alive and kickin'!

Dad:
Stop picking on me.

Grandma:
And he managed to wind up with the best wife in the world.

Mom:
Thanks.

Grandma:
And you got a cute little son.
Get us for more than that?

Dad:
Hey, you, hear that?
You're cute and little.

Nagasumi:
And you're big and ugly.

Grandma:
I'm sorry, my son turned out to be a letdown.
I hope your xxx did against me.

Mom:
It's okay.
I'm sorry your grandson's so disappointing.

Nagasumi, Dad:
Oh, come on!


And now for the local weather.
It looks as though we're going to have clear skies and warm temperatures in the Shikoku area...

Dad:
Hey, Nagasumi!
Clear skies tomorrow! Perfect for swimming!

Nagasumi:
You're gonna sleep in your bathing suit?
I can't believe how hyper active you've been acting, Dad.

Dad:
Well, you're not hyper enough!
Why don't you act like a kid!?
Summer vacation will be over before you know it!
You should be running wild with snot-nosed joy, and screaming every what-do-you-say was frenzied excitement!

Nagasumi:
Just what kind of messed-up childhood did you have, anyway?
And last time I checked, snot and joy do not go together.

Dad:
You are no fun.
Wait! I think I got it.
It's 'cause you can't swim, isn't it?

Nagasumi:
What? Are you kidding me?
What kind of idiot does know how to swim?


Nagasumi:
Help! Please! Help me...!
I am drowning!
Hurts so much... Oh, I don't wanna die...
I... dead...
Somebody... please... anybody...
Urgh... Someone... help... me...

Dad:
Nagasumi.
Hey, Nagasumi!

Nagasumi:
What the...?

Dad:
Do you have any idea how long I've been looking for you?
What the heck are you sleeping down here for?
I was started to think that you'd drown!

Nagasumi:
Dad?

Dad:
Were you expecting someone else? Geez.
Come on, let's head back to Grandma's.

Nagasumi:
Dad, wait!

Dad:
Huh?

Nagasumi:
But I did drown. I mean I was drowning.
And... you'll see I was really far offshore.

Dad:
Are you serious?
You were drowning and the tide reversed you washed up on the rocks?

Nagasumi:
No, there was somebody or maybe something out there.

Dad:
Hmm... Something you say?
You know what it was.
You probably got saved by a mermaid.

Nagasumi:
A mermaid?

Dad:
I was being sarcastic, son.
You were just dreaming. Let's go!
I don't wanna catch a cold on our vacation.

Nagasumi:
Daddy, Dad! I'm not making this up!
I really did drown .
I've been serious here!
Hey, Dad! Come on, listen to me!


Grandma:
So, Nagasumi, you got saved by a pretty little mermaid, did ya?

Nagasumi:
It's true, Grandma!
I saw her...

Mom:
Will you give it a rest already?
You're embarrassing me!
How did you end up like this.

Nagasumi:
I don't know. But I blame my parents.

Grandma:
I guess there aren't any mermaids in Saitama, are there?

Mom:
That's sweet. But you don't have to humor him, Grandma.

Nagasumi:
I swear to you that I am not making this up!

Grandma:
I can't count the legends I've heard about mermaids in the Seto Inland Sea.
People are always claiming to see them in these parts.

Nagasumi:
Do they really?

Grandma:
And you just better hope the legends aren't true.
Or else you're gonna be in a whole heap of trouble.

Nagasumi:
What do you mean by trouble?

Dad:
Come on, Mommy, he was just dreaming.
I found him sleep on the beach.

Nagasumi:
It wasn't a dream!

Mom:
I don't know where he gets this stuff from.

Nagasumi:
You raised me, didn't you?!
Just a bit describe her for you, okay?
She had this long pretty auburn hair and...

Sun:
Oh, hello, good evening.

Grandma:
Who's this?

Mom:
It's a little late for guests, isn't it?

Nagasumi:
She was actually very cute.
Yeah, like this girl! She looked like this!
Argh!

Grandma:
Well now, is there something we can do for you, young lady?

Sun:
Yes, thank you.
Well, um... See my name is Sun Seto.

Grandma:
Sun Seto, huh?
So then, are you a friend of Nagasumi's?

Mom:
I'm pretty sure he doesn't know anybody who lives here in Kagawa.

Sun:
Nagasumi... That's you?

Nagasumi:
That's me.

Sun:
Okay, well...
Will you please... Will you....
Will you please take me as your bride?
Please take me as your bride!
You see...
I know this is kind of sudden, and you must be surprised.
But well... I need you to take responsibility for what happened between us this afternoon!
Responsibility for what happened...

Nagasumi:
What do you mean?

Dad:
What have you done, you little fappy bastard?!
How could you?!
I'm right behind your deal all debts back!
You guess how did it go make me my last left hook, didn't you?!

Nagasumi:
Is your different paradise.
I swear, what does fappy mean in the real word?`

Mom:
I can't believe you in such a fappy face!
You're even in junior highschool yet!
What are you thinking, that poor girl?!

Masa:
Excuse me. Sorry to bother so late.

Mom, Dad:
Huh?
Ah! Yakuza!

Mom:
But the one in the middle is kind of hot baddie.

Dad:
Honey?

Oh, come on. Does every housewife think he's hot?!
I get in the middle of this one!

Masa:
Shut your mouths and keep 'em that way.

Dad:
Yes, sir!

Masa:
We're with Miss Sun.
I apologize for this inconvenience.
But I do regret to say, that you're gonna have to come with us, both of you Mr. and Mrs. Michishio.
Miss Sun's father, my boss, is eager to meet with the two of you.
And he's not a kind man you keep waiting.

Mom, Dad:
She's a yakuza daughter, no!

Masa:
I need you to follow me now.

Grandma:
Just like I said it would be.
He's in a whole heap of trouble.
