  Narrator: It is the year 0079 of the Universal Century. A half century has passed since Earth began moving its burgeoning population into gigantic orbiting space colonies. A new home for mankind. Where people are born and raised... and die. Nine months ago, the cluster of colonies furthest from the earth called Side 3 proclaimed itself the Principality of Zeon and launched a war of independence against the Earth Federation. Initial fighting lasted over one month and saw both sides lose half their respective populations. People were horrified by the indescribable atrocities that had been committed in the name of independence. Eight months had passed since the rebellion began. They were at a stalemate.

Re-Entry to Earth



[On White Base's civilian quarters.]

Fraw: Here's some soap and a towel. Here, so you can freshen up before you step onto the earth. Amuro?

Boy: C'mon, ya gotta fix it, please?

Old Man: I'll fix it, let's see.

Fraw: Oh, Amuro...

Old Man: Let's see...

Amuro: Could I take a look at it for a second?

Boy: Will you fix it?

Amuro: Well let's see.

Boy: Can you fix it?

Old Man: Thank you. I've been with him the whole time and he's got lots of energy. The two of have been together since he lost his parents.

Amuro: Were they lost in the war?

Old Man: They were casualties in the one week battle, and you?

Amuro: With any luck my mother should be on Earth. My dad and I got separated and he went missing on Side 7.

Boy: Yay!

Amuro: Here.

[The boy plays with the fixed toy.]

Old Man: When we get to Earth, the first thing I want to do is take the boy to the country where I was born and raised. After what's happened, I must say I never thought I'd step onto the Earth again. Before I emigrated to Side 7, I grew coffee in South America. These things I keep in my pocket are known as Coffee beans. After I get back to Earth, I'm gonna stay put no matter what happens to me or the boy. Even if the Zeon launch an attack. Even if the Federation big shots send their soldiers and order me to leave. I was born on Earth and I'll be buried on Earth too.

[On the Bridge.]

Mirai: Earth re-entry in 25 minutes.

Bright: Can you handle this Mirai?

Mirai: I went through re-entry in a space glider so I... think so. It was a different type of craft and I was able to communicate with mission control in case something went wrong.

Bright: It's the same basic principle. All you have to do is follow Salamis's lead.

Mirai: Well, I'm a little concerned because Char's still somewhere out there. We'll be vulnerable.

Bright: Right now all I want you to do is concentrate on getting White Base though Earth's atmosphere.

Mirai: Right, sir.

Lieutenant Reed: Hey kid, do you read me?

Bright: Yes I do, Lieutenant Reed.

Reed: I'm double checking the correct procedure for re-entry. We'll be in the Salamis re-entry capsule which travels at an extremely high velocity but you just got to keep up with us, alright?

Bright: I understand sir. Over and out. Mirai switch to auto pilot and begin preparation for re-entry. Listen, I want this to go smoothly.

Mirai: Sir.

Bright: Where's that Musai?

Oscar: Still there. But my readings indicate another ship approaching it.

Bright: I can't believe they got another supply ship out to them this quickly. Incredible. Wait a minute, if the Musai's that desperate to get re-supplied, maybe they haven't got the means to continue fighting. They've given up.

[3 Zakus are brought to the Musai.]

Char: Fortunately supplies have reached us in time. Including 3 new Zakus. In approximately 20 minutes we'll be entering Earth's atmosphere. Now, an attack during re-entry is risky and unprecedented. Even a Zaku will burn up instantly from atmospheric friction if it gets caught by Earth's gravity. But since the enemy's attention is now completely focused on re-entry and not their weapons at all. This is our chance to destroy them. First objective, the Trojan Horse. Second objective, the enemy Mobile Suit. As the best pilots on the force you're capable of handling this mission. Good luck, men.

[Meanwhile...]

Reed: Those going to earth will transfer to the re-entry capsule. Salamis will return to Luna II after launch. I'm curious to know if you think you can actually outrun the Musai.

Pilot: Not sure really. I suppose we'll have to grit our teeth and hope for the best. My reports say the Musai recently docked with a Sodon Tug. It's being resupplied or there's been an emergency of some kind. So I doubt the ship will have the capacity to follow us.

Reed: You're always very optimistic aren't ya?

Pilot: Yeah well maybe that's why I'm still alive.

Reed: Good luck, I'll help prepare the capsule for re-entry.

Pilot: Yes sir.

[They get in the capsule]

Reed: Stand by with missiles

Capsule Pilot: Yes sir.

Reed: I wonder if Char's on his way...

Capsule Pilot: No chance.

Mirai: The Salamis capsule has launched, sir. White Base is now fully prepared to follow behind the capsule.

[They do.]

Bright: Attention all White Base personnel. The ship will re-enter Earth's atmosphere in approximately 8 minutes. Please stay calm all of you. Don't be alarmed by violent movements. Combat personnel, and support crews report to your stations. We may have to deploy Gundam. Support crews remain on alert status.

Announcer: Enemy approaching.

Marker: I'll bring up the screen for you. Objects are moving quickly. Armed and targeting within range in 34 seconds sir.

Bright: Open the hatch. Launch Gundam immediately!

Sayla: Amuro, you have to get back to White Base in exactly 4 minutes, you understand?

Amuro: Okay, got it, Sayla. I don't want to be burnt to a crisp anymore than you do.

Sayla: I see 4 Zakus, 3 degrees, enemy port stern.

Amuro: Four? Char shouldn't have any more Zakus on his ship, hey, Sayla you sure?

Sayla: I'm positive Amuro.

Amuro: White Base has got to cover me.

Sayla: Kai and Ryu will cover you with the rear missiles, you won't have to fight alone. Just watch your altitude.

Amuro: How am I gonna watch my altitude when I'm fighting 4 Zeon Zakus?

Sayla: I know you can do it, Amuro.

Amuro: I'm in way over my head here.

[Gundam launches.]

Amuro: There they are!

Char: The enemy has managed to launch it's new Mobile Suit. Dren, give me cover. We'll split then attack them from both flanks at the same time.

Dren: Roger!

Zeon Capsule Pilot: Launching capsule for re-entry, all systems are go, sir.

Dren: Ready and fire!

[The capsule launches.]

Dren: Ready? Fire the missiles at once!

Bright: Missiles behind you! Lt. Reed, descend immediately!

[The missiles miss.]

Reed: Can we return to our ship?

Capsule Pilot: No chance, we'll come under enemy fire, Lieutenant.

Amuro: They're too far.

[Amuro dodges the missiles.]

Bright: Incoming missiles, evade! Launch the rear defensive missiles. Fire! What's going on?

Mirai: Bright, please stay calm. Nobody is used to this.

[At the gun...]

Ryu: What's holding up the firing?

Jobe John: Well, I was just never trained to operate the firing mechanisms on these defense missiles.

Ryu: Do you want to stay alive? Then maybe you can help me look for the manual instead of whining.

[Missiles hit White Base.]

Civilians: Ah!

Boy: Grandpa...

Old Man: Don't worry, the nice lad who fixed your car is protecting us from the enemy.

Boy: I hope he gets those guys.

Amuro: This time I'll match him move for move. And I've got some new ones for ya! I'm not letting you anywhere near White Base.

[A missile hits Gundam's shield.]

Amuro: Ah! Char!

[He shoots but misses.]

Sayla: Amuro, don't get too distracted by Char. The Zakus are after the Salamis capsule.

Amuro: Alright. I really don't like the idea of turning my back on Char at all. That was the wrong move.

[He nearly hits the Zaku.]

Comun: I have no shields!

Amuro: Where's Char? Ugh! Not a chance, take this!

[He misses the Zaku.]

Amuro: Oh no, I missed! If only I had a spare bazooka with me. Sayla listen, can you send me the beam rifle please?

Sayla: I can't, you're asking the impossible Amuro. Wait... I'll ask the support crew.

Hayato: Grab the machine gun.

Kai: But how do you operate a machine gun?

Hayato: How should I know, figure it out.

[He shoots at the Zaku.]

Bright: Ryu, Hayato, Zakus are too close for missiles! Fire the machine guns instead!

Ryu: Roger!

[Meanwhile...]

Amuro: Char!

Sayla: Amuro! We can only send you the Gundam Hammer.

Amuro: Great, I'll take it.

Sayla: Roger, I'll let you know the minute we launch it alright? Amuro, in front!

Amuro: I see him.

[Gundam fires at the Zaku.]

Zaku Pilot: He's got Vulcan cannons in that Mobile Suit! Ah! No please, Commander Char, come in, come in, come in, Commander Char! Come in please, Commander Char! My Zaku is not responding!

[The Zaku blows up. Amuro fires at another.]

Amuro: I can't hit it! It's like the Vulcan barrels aren't aligned!

Sayla: Amuro! I'm launching the Gundam Hammer immediately. Wait for it.

[She launches it.]

Amuro: I'm going too fast! I don't know if I can catch it at this speed! Char!

[Char aims at him.]

Char: Now say goodbye.

[He hits the Gundam Hammer.]

Amuro: Char no!



Commercial Break



[Amuro blocks the missile shot at him by Char with the Gundam Hammer. Char looses the beam rifle.]

Char: Ugh, just lost my spare weapon.

[A Zaku fires at the re-entry capsule.]

Reed: Our trajectory is too deep for re-entry. Should we attempt it?

Capsule Pilot: I really don't know, Lieutenant, but I... Ugh!

[A shot goes through the ceiling and hits Lt. Reed in the arm.]

Capsule Pilot: Ugh, what the!?

Assistant: The ceiling's cracked. Hey Lt. Reed! Look at your space suit!

Reed: Patch it up, would ya? We're decompressing.

Assistant: Ceiling too!

Reed: Do it. Get the extinguisher. Put out that fire.

Capsule Pilot: Yes sir!

Assistant: Lt. Reed, are you injured?

Reed: Fix the suit, we'll worry about the wound later. Not so hard, easy soldier.

[On White Base...]

Marker: Mr. Bright sir, the Salamis capsule's been hit, sir!

Bright: Are they still able to re-enter along side our ship?

Marker: I don't know.

Reed: The capsule will de-construct from the inside if we attempt to re-enter now Mr. Bright.

Bright: I understand, Lieutenant, we'll bring you and your men aboard immediately.

Reed: Roger.

Bright: Sayla, instruct Amuro to draw away the Zakus from the Lieutenant's ship.

Sayla: But how?! He's still got his hands full with Char and I don't think it's going well.

Mirai: Increase speed 10%, we'll move in front of the capsule.

Bright: Omur! Get ready to bring in the Salamis capsule right now! Kai, Ryu, I want you to cover us!

Kai: Mr. Bright, they're just too fast!

Omur: Hatch is open, Salamis capsule. Can you read me? Firing the laser lock. We'll bring you in once you're secure.

Capsule Pilot: Roger!

Reed: I sure hope those kids can handle it.

Omur: Firing laser lock!

[The capsule comes in.]

Char: Crown, what are you doing? You can see where their weapons are firing, come on! Approach the ship and hit it hard. Use your Zaku's potential. Do it!

Crown: But there's too much flak coming from the enemy's ship, Commander!

Char: This is nothing, Crown, target as you fly in, hit them from below. Are you able to keep up with me, Comun?

Comun: Yes Commander, no problem! I can't use my Zaku's right arm. I'll be able to use my left arm to run the heat hawk.

Char: That's excellent, you've done very well, Comun. Prepare to destroy the enemy's Mobile Suit now.

[On the Bridge...]

Bright: Amuro, you have to intercept the Zaku that's moving in below White Base!

Reed: What's our status?

Bright: Awful. Ship's in serious trouble.

[White Base is hit.]

Sayla: Ugh! Damage to starboard!

Marker: Fire the starboard guns.

Oscar: Deploy patch film to the bridge immediately!

Bright: Sector 4 deploy patch film, where are you?

[They do it and cover the hole.]

[In the civilian section...]

Kika: I wanna go with the soldiers and fight the enemy too!

Letz: There's a war out there stupid!

Kika: I'm not afraid!

Katz: You are scared.

Kika: I am not!

Hayato: I need to know where the machine gun turrets are.

Omur: I think the gun should be in 35. Use the gun on the right that aims forward!

Hayato: Come on, let's do it!

[They fire at the Zaku.]

Amuro: Ugh, can't get up above him!

Char: What's this? That pilot's skills are improving, how's he doing it? Now Comun!

[Char smashes through Gundam's shield, but Amuro hits the Zaku with the Gundam Hammer.]

Char: I've had enough!

[He elbows Gundam's head.]

[Comun's Gundam blows up.]

Char: Comun... and I can't finish him off.

Sayla: Amuro, get back to White Base right now! You're all out of time.

Amuro: I see that, will do. Alright, this is the end for you Char!

[Amuro throws the Hammer at Char and misses.]

Char: Pull back, Crown, we've got to head to the Consign. Crown!? Can you hear me?

[He still shoots at White Base.]

Bright: White Base is about to enter the atmosphere. Raise the barrier. Bring Gundam in from the rear bay. Withdraw all gun turrets. Amuro, you're cutting it too close, abandon your attack! Enter White Base now!

Amuro: Sure, but I still have the Vulcans. I'll get this Zaku, he's right in my sites!

[The Consign approaches Char's Zaku.]

Dren: Commander Char, return to the capsule before it's too late!

Char: Right. Open the hatch Dren. We're aborting the mission, even that enemy Mobile Suit wouldn't risk it. Disengage and return to the ship at once.

[On White Base.]

Oscar: We can't afford to wait for Amuro any longer Mr. Bright. Tell him that he'll burn up in Earth's atmosphere!

Bright: No! Amuro, forget the Zaku!

Reed: Mr. Bright! My mission here is to safely return the White Base and Gundam to HQ. And we've already compromised our safety numerous times. So you tell him to...

Bright: Tell it to Amuro sir.

Reed: Bunch of clowns...

Bright: What? If I hadn't sent Gundam out, Char and those Zakus would have destroyed us for sure.

Mirai: It's extremely dangerous to stand Lt. Reed, find a seat. Check the outer hull cooling system, bring it up 3 points.

Reed: I'll have you court-martialled for insubordination.

[Fraw Bow comes on the bridge.]

Fraw: I was getting a little concerned about Amuro. Where... Ah!

[Gundam is heading into the atmosphere and glows red from the heat.]

Amuro: This acceleration... I'm falling too fast!

Char: Where's Crown?

Dren: Too late, if we try to recover him at this point we'll be burned alive.

Crown: Commander Char! I can't seem to slow my Zaku down. Commander Char, please bring the ship and rescue me!

Char: Crown... your Zaku isn't capable of re-entry and we can't open the capsule. There's nothing I can do for you. But listen Crown, your death won't be in vain. You were able to lure the enemy Mobile Suit away and ensure its destruction.

[The Zakus crumbles into dust in the atmosphere. Amuro looks through the manual.]

Amuro: This must be the section on re-entry systems. Do I have enough time!? Attitude adjustment, and cooling shift... activate all systems! And the heat proof film!

[He takes it out and covers the Gundam with it.]

Amuro: Wow... amazing. The temperature of the armor's dropped. But how am I gonna land at this velocity?

Oscar: I can not monitor Gundam due to the re-entry blackout.

Sayla: Amuro! Amuro! Please answer me!

Fraw: Amuro! Amuro!

Sayla: You won't be able to make contact for a while.

Char: The trajectory of the Mobile Suit hasn't changed, and it hasn't burned up.

Dren: What can it mean, sir? It couldn't possibly be that strong. No Mobile Suit can withstand such temperatures.

Char: It's hard to believe. But given that their Trojan Horse was designed to withstand the heat of such an accelerated re-entry, anything's possible. We've got work to do.

[On White Base.]

Mirai: Altitude, 32. 30... 29... 26... 25... 24... 20... 17... 16... 14... 12... 11...

[Gundam makes it through the atmosphere.]

Amuro: Will it hold up? Come on...

[The Consign reaches regular air space.]

Char: When we have radio communications back up, contact Captain Garma.

Dren: I think I understand your strategy now. Interesting. Even if we weren't able to defeat the enemy before our ship went into re-entry, by forcing a different trajectory on their ship, you'll drive the Trojan Horse into Zeon airspace and create a 2 stage trap with no escape.

Char: War is a hard business... We have to cover all the bases, Dren.

Dren: It's Captain Garma.

Garma: Well... what is it, Red Comet?

Char: I might have to give up that ridiculous nickname all together, Captain Garma Zabi.

Garma: Why so humble?

Char: If you know about the enemy's V-Project and the prototype Federation Mobile Suits, you'll be interested to learn that I'm zeroing in on them.

Garma: What's that?

Char: However Captain, it has cost me 8 Zakus to find and eventually corner them.

Garma: Extraordinary. Sure it was worth it?

Char: I've forced them into your area. You can score some brownie points off them. I'll be there as soon as I can.

Garma: Well, I'll accept your kind gift. I'll deploy a Gau attack carrier on the double. Emergency scramble right away.

Assistant: Sir!

[On White Base.]

Mirai: At 53,000, speed stable, we're resuming level flight.

Bright: Good. Amuro, you read me? Amuro!

Sayla: Amuro, the system should be working by now. Amuro! Answer me please! Amuro!

Oscar: The transmission's restored. It's Gundam!

Fraw: Amuro!

Bright: That kid... he really did get out of line there, huh. But we've got a chance against the Zeon with the help of this Mobile Suit.

Amuro: I read you loud and clear, returning to ship.

Sayla: Sensors are good. You can maneuver Gundam into the rear deck Amuro.

Amuro: Sure thing.

[In the civilian section.]

Old Man: If you look down there you can see it now. That's Earth.

Boy: Hey is that green and brown stuff all land? Wow, and all that blue stuff there's the ocean, right?

Old Man: Yes, that's right son. I guess this is the first time you've seen the Earth, isn't it? It truly is a magnificent world and you'll be able to run and play in the natural sunshine.

[On the bridge.]

Marker: Our projected course. And this is our course up to now.

Reed: This doesn't look too good, Mr. Bright.

Bright: No, Lieutenant, we're deep inside Zeon territory.

Reed: This isn't a joke... Ugh.

Sayla: Let's see that injury, Lt. Reed.

Bright: Lieutenant, that Char is a clever strategist. We were tricked. He lured us right into his trap.

Reed: You're gonna get us through this whatever it takes.

Marker: The enemy!

[On one of the Gau attack carriers...]

Garma: Maybe the Red Comet's right... Compared to the other Federation ships I've fought against, this one's a real beast.

Soldier: It's the Musai capsule.

Garma: Good, bring it in.
