  Narrator: It is the year 0079 of the Universal Century. A half century has passed since Earth began moving its burgeoning population into gigantic orbiting space colonies. A new home for mankind. Where people are born and raised... and die. Nine months ago, the cluster of colonies furthest from the earth called Side 3 proclaimed itself the Principality of Zeon and launched a war of independence against the Earth Federation. Initial fighting lasted over one month and saw both sides lose half their respective populations. People were horrified by the indescribable atrocities that had been committed in the name of independence. Eight months had passed since the rebellion began. They were at a stalemate.

Gundam Rising



[A trio of Zakus approach a colony. They land on it and opens a hatch to go inside. A piece of debris bounces off the door into space.]

Denim: Slender, stay here.

Slender: Yes sir.

[Two of the Zakus enter the colony and land on the ground. one of the pilots gets out and looks at the nearby city.]

Gene: Hey chief, they got military facilities in the upper right block. This should be rush hour. I only see one car, no people in sight. Wait... there's a kid.

[The kid, Fraw Bow, heads into Amuro's house with Haro.]

Fraw: Amuro! Amuro! What, he hasn't even eaten breakfast. Amuro!

[They head upstairs to his room.

Fraw: Oh yeah, I should have known you'd be cooped up in here. You've got to eat Amuro, you should take better care of your health. Amuro!

Haro: Hello Amuro! Hello Amuro!

Amuro: You're looking very well today, Haro.

Haro: Thank you, Amuro.

Fraw: You've got to hurry and get dressed Amuro. Amuro!

Amuro: After I finish re-wiring this computer.

Fraw: Don't you know about the evacuation order?

Amuro: Evacuation order? I heard a siren, I didn't know what...

Fraw: It's an emergency, didn't you hear the military broadcast? A warship is docking today and we have to evacuate the sector.

Amuro: Why?

Fraw: I don't know. Amuro, we don't have much time.

Amuro: Alright already.

Fraw: We'll wait outside for you. Haro, let's go.

Amuro: What a pain.

[Fraw goes outside and sees Hayato.]

Fraw: Hayato!

Hayato: Hello Fraw Bow.

Fraw: You're Amuro's closest neighbor and it's your responsibility to tell him.

Hayato: Oh, about the evacuation?

Fraw: Of course, he's all alone in there.

Hayato: Well, if military engineers like his dad hadn't moved here in the first place, we wouldn't have to leave now.

Fraw: Yes, we all had to move because of the new research facility. You're not still bitter, are you?

H: Well not really but I sort of liked where we used to live.

Hayato's Mom: Hayato!

Hayato: Yeah. Bye!

Fraw: Amuro!

[Amuro drives out in the car, she gets in.]

Fraw: Amuro, you're a hopeless case. Amuro, is your father going to be on the warship that's coming in this afternoon?

Amuro: I think so, he went earth side about a week ago but I haven't heard anything.

Fraw: Do you think there'll be fighting here? No.

Amuro: I don't know, he doesn't tell me anything, Fraw Bow.

[Meanwhile, at the facility...]

Commander: Get the Gundam components loaded on to White Base. Speed up the ground operations.

Assistant: Aye sir.

Technician: What is White Base doing? They're leading a Zeon ship here! So, is this it?

Guy: Sir.

Technician: The Federation has a fine new warship, it can be proud of Lieutenant. With the strength and firepower of Gundam and this new ship, we should be able to break the Zeon easily.

[White Base docks at Side 7.]

Bright: Excuse me, Lieutenant Ray, docking procedures with Side 7 have commenced. Please report to the Bridge at once.

Tem: I'll be right there thank you. Mr. Bright, is it?

Bright: Sir.

Tem: And how many months with the military, Mr. Bright?

Bright: 6 months sir.

Tem: You're about 19 years old, right?

Bright: Yes sir.

Tem: Once we start mass producing the Gundam as I've planned, we can probably end this terrible war without sending kids like you into battle.

[Bright sees a picture of Amuro on his desk.]

Bright: Is that your son, sir?

Tem: Yes, I hear there are kids even his age fighting as guerillas in this war. Is that true, Bright?

Bright: Yes I think so, sir. That's what they say.

Tem: It's horrible

[They head to the bridge.]

Captain Paolo: I'd like to thank you very much for coming, Lieutenant Ray.

Tem: So, we weren't able to outrun that Zeon ship after all.

Paolo: Unfortunately not.

Tem: I understand.

[White Base enters Side 7. Meanwhile on the Zeon ship, the Musai...]

Char: Looks like I'm not destined to get a break these days, am I? Who'd have thought I'd bump into something like this on the way home from a routine mission? But I suppose that's what destiny is, isn't it?

Dren: Yes sir, Commander. But could there really be a secret Federation Base for their V Project in a quiet out of the way place like that?

Char: Easily. And they could be developing advanced Mobile Suits that rival or even surpass our own Zakus.

Dren: Doubt it, not in such a remote place.

[A transmission comes in.]

Char: Did you get it?

Dren: Here it is, it's being related as a code CC2.

Char: See, it's exactly as I predicted.

Dren: You mean the Federation really does have Mobile Suits?

Char: Let's assume they were completely successful in the development of their weapons.

[Back on Side 7...]

Denim: Yes, the third one's a Mobile Suit as well. Could be more in there.

Gene: They're vulnerable now, this could be our chance!

Denim: But we're just here on, Recon.

Gene: But what if they get those Mobile Suits loaded on to that warship?

Denim: We won't do anything other than we're told.

[Gene runs back to his Zaku.]

Gene: Look at Commander Char. He built his career on fighting.

Denim: Hey Gene, this isn't a joke! It's called insubordination. Cease and desist!

Gene: Hah, who's gonna care after I pull this off?

[He aims and fires at the military base.]

Gene: Heh, the sooner you move in to attack your enemies the better.

Old Guy: What was that?

Amuro: Huh? Those powerful ground tremors could only have been caused by explosion.

Fraw's Grandfather: It's the Zeon... A Zeon attack.

[Amuro gets up.]

Fraw: Amuro!

Amuro: I'll go look for my father.

Fraw's Grandfather: Amuro!

Old Guy: Hey don't jeopardize us all, you know!

Amuro: My dads in the military, this shelter isn't safe. I'm going to request an evacuation to the ship that just docked today.

Old Guy: Hey, stop this now!

Amuro: Please, close the other door.

[He goes outside.]

Lady: It's a Zeon Mobile Suit, we're done for!

Amuro: So that's it, there it is... a Zeon Zaku!

[Amuro gets in his car and drives off. An officer drives by.]

Officer: Hey! Civilians must remain in the underground shelter!

Amuro: I'm looking for an engineering officer called Tem Ray sir. Do you know where he is?

Officer: Probably on the ship. Unload it.

[A missile hits the area where the Officer drove into. Amuro falls over trying to avoid the blast. He finds a book with a 'V' on the ground.]

Amuro: They... They're dead! Huh? It's classified.

[Amuro opens the book.]

Amuro: This must be the manual for the Federation's Mobile Suit!



Commercial Break



[On the Musai...]

Slender[on monitor]: I was following orders.

Char: What about Chief Denim?

Slender: Well... he moved up from the rear already to support Gene's attack.

Char: And you verified that the Federation has Mobile Suits?

Slender: Sir.

Char: Take as many pictures as you can. And only retreat if it becomes risky Slender.

Slender: Yes Sir.

Dren: What'll we do?

Char: I'm surprised Denim wasn't able to control the rookie. Dren, take us closer to Side 7. I may have to go down there myself.

Denim: Right.

[People rush out of the shelter while Amuro reads.

Amuro: This Mobile Suit... it's all computerized. A self learning computer? No wonder Dad's been so secretive.

Fraw: Amuro! Are you alright? We've got to get out of here, Amuro.

[The Zakus continue to attack.]

Kid: Stop it!

Fraw: Amuro? Amuro...

[Amuro sees his dad nearby.]

Amuro: Go to the Spaceport. Take your family.

[He runs off.]

Fraw: Amuro!

Fraw's Mom: Fraw, hurry up!

Fraw: Mom!

Amuro: Hey Dad! Hey!

Tem: Why not use number 3?

Soldier: That's for evacuees.

Amuro: Dad, I gotta talk to you!

Tem: Gundam must go before the evacuees. Take it up to White Base and prepare it for battle.

Soldier: Yes sir.

Amuro: C'mon Dad, can't you hear me?

Tem: Oh, Amuro?! Why aren't you evacuating?

Amuro: Listen Dad, are Mobile Suits more important to you than human beings?

Tem: Get a move on.

Amuro: Dad, stop.

Tem: I want you to get up onto White Base now.

Amuro: What is White Base dad?

Tem: It's the new warship that just docked. What's taking so long?

Soldier: The engine won't start

Tem: Get to White Base immediately. I'll find a tractor.

Amuro: But Dad, I...

[Amuro notices the Gundam.]

Amuro: So, this is their secret weapon.

[Another explosion hits, knocking him over.]

Fraw: Amuro, hurry, are you alright? Amuro. Ah!

[Another explosion hits behind her.]

Amuro: Fraw Bow! Fraw, Fraw Bow, Fraw! Fraw Bow please, can you hear me? Fraw!

Fraw: Amuro?

Amuro: Can you stand?

Fraw: Yeah. Mom? Grandfather? Mother, Mother, Mother![cries]

Amuro: C'mon Fraw, they'll get you too, you know. You've gotta go now.

Fraw: Noooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[Amuro slaps her.]

Amuro: Hey, get a grip, you're stronger than that. Make a run for the space port. You can do it Fraw Bow. I'll be there soon. Now go! Run quickly, Fraw Bow! C'mon, Fraw Bow. Way to go. Please Fraw. That's it.

[Amuro runs toward the Gundam and climbs aboard. He removes the sheet
from the cockpit and gets inside.]

Amuro: Look at that... It's on. It's just like the manual.

[He turns on the Gundam.]

Amuro: Amazing... This machine is incredibly powerful. Let's see what it can do. Is that it? There. Can I do this?

[Amuro continues to activate the Gundam as the Zakus attack.]

Civilians: Ah!

Bright: Hurry! Get the weapons!

Technician: White Base! Request you send a Core Fighter on the double!

Crewmember: Impossible. Not unless we blast open Side 7's hull.

Paolo: Have we deployed all combat personnel?

Assistant: Aye sir. We've deployed all units to retrieve the Gundam.

Paolo: Didn't expect an attack from within Side 7.

[The Gundam slides off on to the ground. A Zaku stands in front of it.]

Amuro: Please... will you just get up? He's right in front! Ah! Weapons... Ah!

[He fires the Gundam's vulcan machine gun]

Gene: Look out Chief Denim! The enemy's mobile suit! It started to move and fire back!

Denim: What? But I thought it was all just unassembled parts.

Gene: Chief Denim... it doesn't seem to be functioning very well. I'll get it.

[He shoots at the Gundam.]

Amuro: No!

[No effect.]

Gene: What? That's absolutely impossible! The rifles are useless against it!

Amuro: Watch this, Zeon rat!

[The Gundam gets up. Gene fires some more. Denim walks next to him.]

Denim: Our orders are just to observe, soldier. Let's retreat!

Gene: Do you know what you're saying? If we let him go, the Federation will...

Denim: It's standing!

[Gundam gets up completely.]

Amuro: Please get up... please! There.

[Amuro fires at the Zakus, they fire back. Amuro's dad and the other soldier approaches.]

Soldier: Look there, sir. One of our Mobile Suits is engaged and is firing back.

Tem: What kind of attack is that? Who's the pilot in the cockpit?

Amuro: What? Oh no, I'm out of ammo!

Gene: You're mine. I don't care how thick your armor is.

Amuro: No!

Gene: It almost looks like this Mobile Suit is shaking in terror.

[Gundam crushes the Zaku's machine gun then tears the wires off its head and throws it into a nearby building.]

Gene: Ah!

Denim: So, that's the awesome power of the Federation's Mobile Suit.

Amuro: That's amazing...

[The Zaku gets up.]

Amuro: You won't get away... doesn't this have any other weapons? Anything? How about this?

[He activates the beam sabre.]

Denim: Gene, why don't you try to join up with Slender if you can manage it?

Gene: I can still see with the backup camera. I'll rendezvous with Slender now.

Amuro: I'll get you!

[As the Zaku flies away the Gundam jumps at it with the Beam sabre
and cuts it in half]

Gene: AAAAAhhhhhh!

[The Zaku blows up, blowing a hole in Side 7's hull.]

Amuro: Ah!

[Amuro's dad and the other soldier are sucked through the hole.]

Amuro: If... if I hit the Mobile Suit engine I'll destroy Side 7. What should I do now? What should I do now?

Denim: You'll pay for what you did to Gene.

Amuro: I don't know what to do. Can I aim this and just hit the cockpit? If that thing blows up all the air in Side 7 will be sucked out.

[The Zaku charges, Amuro shoves the beam sabre through the cockpit.
The Zaku falls to the ground.]

Bright: Get the civilians on to White Base.

Assistant: Yes sir.

Crew Member: I don't think any more oxygen is escaping, sir.

Bright: And the transfer of the Gundam?

Crew Member: Most of the engineers were lost in the attack so it sounds unlikely we'll be able to.

Bright: That pilot will have to do it.

Crew Member: Huh?

Bright: We're gonna need his help whoever's in that Mobile Suit. He's the only chance we've got right now.

[More missiles, launched from the Musai hit Side 7.]

Civilians: Ah!

Char: Where's Slender now?

Dren: Looks like he has escaped Side 7, he's heading this way.

Char: Nobody ever likes to admit to mistakes due to his own youth, but I guess this time I simply have no choice.



Preview:
Char was waiting until White Base left Side 7 when he displays his real abilities as the Red Comet during his attack on Gundam. Amuro had no idea what he was up against, and neither did Char. It would be a terrifying battle. Mobile Suit Gundam. Next episode:

Destroy Gundam!

Who will survive?
