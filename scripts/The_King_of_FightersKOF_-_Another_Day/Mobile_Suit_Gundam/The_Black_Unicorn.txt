Episode 5 - The Black Unicorn

Torrington Control officer:
Attention, incoming VC202!
This is Torrington Control.
State your affiliation and objective.

transport:
Torrington Control.
We are a transport belonging to the Vist Foundation, on a special mission from Staff Headquarters.
We are now delivering a prototype mobile suit.
We're sending it to you on a Base Jabber.
Transmitting operation code from Staff Headquarters.

Torrington Control officer:
Operation Code received.
Special mission queried and confirmed.
Approaching Base Jabber, descending to regulation altitude.
We'll guide you into final approach coarse.

transport:
Now commencing mission.
Detaching the suit... and deploying!

Torrington Control officer:
Mission? What mission?!
Hey! Approaching Base Jabber!
Follow our control instructions!
I repeat, follow our control instructions!

Riddhe:
A black...

Banagher:
Unicorn...?

Riddhe:
A friendly...?
No!
Get out of there, Banagher!

officer:
Sir, the hatch won't open...

Alberto:
And I gave you the release code!
I don't care how you do it. Plug him out of there!

Riddhe:
Hey, care to explain what you're doing here?
And what is that black Unicorn?

Alberto:
Actually, we are calling it the Banshee.
And it's far too complicated to explain to you, OK?
What's in a line?? here.

Riddhe:
Hold on a second!

Alberto:
I'm afraid this is a family matter.
And I don't think the military has the right to middle in one's family affairs.
Wouldn't you agree?

Riddhe:
What do you mean family...?

Alberto:
That's rather embarrassing if you must know.
Banagher Links is the illegitimate son of the previous head of the Vist Foundation, my father, Cardeas VIst.
So, thank you to stop asking questions.

Riddhe:
Banagher is...

officer:
The hatch is opening.

Alberto:
It's rejecting all external commands, and the system has gone completely dormant.

Martha:
So, now what?

Alberto:
Well, our guess is that Banagher Links has managed to block us out of our system.
Without confirmation from him, we won't be able to obtain any of the new information that was revealed by the La+ program.

Martha:
I suppose it's in his blood.
You really didn't know?

Alberto:
No. I was away at loading school when he was born.
So, I never even met him.
I can't believe this boy is actually...

Martha:
He certainly has his father's stubbornness.
If anyone could change his mind, she could.
Audrey Burne.
As aliases go, it has a lovely ring.

Audrey:
I take it this means Chairman Ronan Maecenas is aware of my transfer.

Martha:
Of course.
After all, we are working toward the same goal, Chairman Ronan and I.
We will seal Laplace's Box for good.
I understand you left Neo Zeon because you desired exactly that.
At any moment, the box's key, the Unicorn will be delivered to this Garuda.
Until that time, its young pilot will continue to act as its guardian.
I believe he is no stranger to you. Am I right, your highness?
This Banagher Links.
Unfortunately he's locked access to the coordinates that've been revealed during yesterday's battle.
The bastard child inherits the delusions of his foolish father.
You have no idea how much trouble he is causing us.

Audrey:
Then, Cardeas... was his father...?

Martha:
I have a proposal for you, princess.
Let's work together.

Audrey:
You want me to convince Banagher for you?

Martha:
I will make it worth your while.
I can also guarantee a place for your every royal Zeon remnants.

Audrey:
If you offer sincere, you have no problem releasing Marida Cruz first.

Martha:
Lieutenant Marida, or should I say Ple Twelve, is now working with us completely of her own free will.

Audrey:
You forced her to undergo reconditioning...

Martha:
True.
We reconditioned her.
Just as Neo Zeon once did.
We can hardly be held responsible for creating that poor creature.
All I did was free what was already within her.
I gave her the chance to exact revenge she desired.

Audrey:
What revenge?

Martha:
Why against the world that created her, of course.
The world that is unfortunately ruled by the flood? logic of men.

Daryl:
If we don't have some idea of what's going on, how are we supposed to protect the ship?!

Watts:
I hate thing pushed around by them. I mean ??? civilians!

Bright:
Right now, we are working under the direction of the General Staff Headquarters.
So, you can think of the Foundation as part of them.
Londo Bell's mission remains the same.
Our job is still to stay uncouth(?) and hunt down the Neo Zeon ship that infiltrated Earth.
That said, there can be no denying that the circumstances under which we operated have altered.
We will launch the captured Gundam type into space via a shuttle.
Once that is done, the Vist Foundation personnel will disembark.
Despite of any objections you may have, I expect you to conduct yourself appropriatel.
You are dismissed.

Meran:
Sir, from what I'm hearing they are saying the supplys for ship to the Garuda were fit for royalty.

Bright:
So, I guess the Intel from Luio & Co. was accurate.
Well, while(?) they can let me speak to him?

Meran:
They approved it almost immediately.
And it would be wise to assume that these walls have ears.

Bright:
And here I thought this was my ship...

I'd like to quick words with you.
Is that all right.
My name is Bright Noah.
I'm the captain of this Federation ship, the Ra Cailum.
I hear you making things difficult for you interrogators.
And your suit isn't giving us any informations either.
All my technical crues are tearing their hair out.

Banagher:
I can't let anyone see them.
If people find out what they are,the place will become a battle field again.
People will die, just like Ms. Loni.

Bright:
Suit yourself.
And go on keeping them
So, did you escape that camouflaged freighter to get here?

Banagher:
I wouldn't exactly use the word "escaped".
It's more likely they decided to send me out there, I guess.
To be honest, the captain wasn't happy about the operation.

Bright:
Yeah, I don't doubt that.
Based on the actions of that ship, I so much
But if you weren't being treated as a prisner.
Dose that mean they gave you freedom to act as you pleased?


Banagher:
Yeah, you could say that.
I didn't get the sense of enemies
even I know the Federation says we are.

Bright:
Why was that?

Banagher:
I think it's because I'm not a soldier.
I'm not use to categorizing people into "friend" or "foe".
But there, while I was aboard that ship, I didn't need to.

Bright:
Thank you. I think I understand you now.
Don't give up!
You have strength I can see it in your eyes.
Strong eyes can feed off of adiversity.
As long as you don't give up, you'll be able to make the most of what comes.

Banagher:
It's not about strength. It's about dumb luck.
Everything has happened. I have nothing to do with it.
Even piloting the Unicorn.

Bright:
You really think that?
It may have been simply due to mere luck that you stumbled across the Gundam when you need it.
But that's how it happened to every single Gundam pilot that came before you.
However, you still had to choose wheather or not to get into that Gundam.
And that's the choice you made on your own.
You. Not luck.
At that moment, something gave you the resolve to pilot that machine.
What was it?

Banagher:
There's someone I wanna help.
Audrey Burne.
She is the one who everyone's calling Mineva Zabi.

Bright:
Are you sure?
You are positive the Genaral Revil has been mobilized?

Beltorchika:
It apparently received orders from the Genaral Staff Headquarters during the shakedown cruise.
They clearly want it to carry out some sort of covert operation.

Bright:
It's the Nahel Argama they are after...
Now I see.
That's what they used to bait Chairman Ronan.
Eliminate everyone who knows the secret of the Box.
That's the share agenda of the Vist Foundation and General Staff Headquorters.

Beltorchika:
What are you planning to do?
The General Revil is the key to the reconstruction of Earth Fleet.
If it attacked, the Nahel Argama wouldn't stand a chance.
If you're having trouble making direct contact from your end,
our people at Luio & Co. can notify them that they are in danger.

Bright:
Beltorchika, I want to get in touch with the camouflaged Sleeves freighter.

Meran:
But, Captain...

Bright:
With Luio & Co.'s contacts within the Federation and Neo Zeon, it shouldn't be a problem.

Beltorchika:
Are you sure about this, Captain Bright?

Bright:
I have the perfect negotiator for the job.
He does hate Zeons with a passion, however.

Kai:
This is in your best interests, too, don't you think?
You'd even call it a golden opportunity, at least I would.
Once the key to Laplace's Box is delivered, those Foundation people plan to take both it and your princess into space.
If that happens, they'll be out of reach for good.

Zinnerman:
Give me a reason why I should trust you.

Kai:
We don't like the Vist Foundation conspiring the General Staff Headquorters and having the military at their beck and call.
A certain field commander also feels that way.
And then, there's Luio & Co., which could be called a Foundation's competitor.
Whatever Laplace's Box really is, we just don't want to see the ties between the Federation and Foundation deepening as a result.

Zinnerman:
And to keep that from happening, you'll get in that with the Neo Zeon, eh?

Flasto:
Captain...

Zinnerman:
I need you to provide us with one Base Jabber.

Kai:
I'll see what I can do.
So, dose this mean you'll be resorting to your own guerrilla tactics then?

Zinnerman:
I'm just not sure we can pull this off by ourselves.
Even if we hit them with a sneak attack and recapture the princess, it won't do any good if we can't escape.

Kai:
And that is why I've been calling this a joint operation.
I'll be sending you back up.
But it would be from a ship you've had a nasty running with, though.

Otto:
In any case, the first order of business in times such as these is to remain calm.
We've been on standby for nearly 20 days.
It's understandable that you are unsafe.
However, you, my comrades, others' superior officers.
So, you must present yourself.
With...

Mihiro:
Captain!
Emergency message!

Bright:
No. I'm serious.
I'm putting my money on that boy's intuition.

Banagher:
Ensign Riddhe!
Where's Audrey?!
You came to Earth with her, right?!
Where is she?
What happened to her?!
Answer me!

Bright:
I need to borrow him for a moment.

Daryl:
Wow, careful!
The Earth gravity can be your little bitch.

Watts:
What's wrong with you, boys?
That man over there is the captain on this ship.

Banagher:
Audrey's there?!

Bright:
No doubt about it.
The Garencieres is planning a rescue mission.
It's scheduled to take place during the Garuda transfer.
I suggest you work with them.

Once completed, join the Nahel Argama which will be out in space waiting.
It's the only way you can keep the Box's key out of the hands of the conspirators.
It's the only way to save her.
Can you do that?

Banagher:
I'll do it.

Bright:
I'm afraid this is all I can do for you.
Just like every Gundam pilot there's ever been, I truly believe you are chosen by it.
This was the only possible outcome for any of you.
Whether that'd be good or bad, who knows...?

Banagher:
Captain Bright...

Bright:
The rest is up to you.
Don't let the situation get the best of.
(Be brave enough to fight off despair.
If you are a Gundam pilot... a Newtype... you can do it.)

Banagher:
Audrey... I'm coming!

Martha:
I will say this.
One has to admire your pride.
But your pride is about to get a lot of people killed.
Do you understand that?
With your actions just now, you've stolen the future from the very Zeon survivors who worship you.
The only possible future for them was to coexist with the Vist Foundation.
A woman's pride can be fatal to a man.
And you are blossoming into a fine woman.
Every blossom needs fertilizer.
And that's what that boy's become to you.

Audrey:
Banagher...

Daryl:
What did the captain say to that kid?
I don't want to get caught in a middle of any weird scandals.

Watts:
Hey, you think the rukie knows what's up?

Nigel:
Nah, I'm guessing he's also in the dark.
But Captain Bright knows what he's doing.
Whatever happens, don't panic.

Bright:
Ensign Riddhe, keep an eye on the Unicorn.
Remember, as long as the key is safe, it should help you as well.
Your father's decisions are his own.
You're young.
Act according to your own judgement.

Riddhe:
Understood.
(Oh, I'll go without saying.
Especially when Mineva's involved.)

Bright:
Taking off!

Marida:
All of your weapons have been deactivated.
I suggest you do not resist.

Banagher:
Ms. Marida!

Marida:

I am Ple Twelve.
I do not respond to the name, marida.

Banagher:
What are you talking about?
And what are you doing in that mobile suit anyway?
The Captain and the rest of the Garencieres worried about you!

Marida:
Be quiet!
Don't talk to me like that.

Banagher:
It's me!
It's Banagher Links! Don't you remember?!
I came to Earth with the Captain, your master!

Alberto:
Ple Twelve!
Do not pay attention to that boy!

Marida:
I understand master.

Alberto:
Is everything all right?

Marida:
The suit is perfect.

Alberto:
I was talking about you.
If anything is wrong, however trivial, do report it.

Marida:
Roger.

Alberto:
If you are in pain, don't tough it out.
And If something is bothering for you, please feel free to...

Marida:
Is that an order?

Banagher:
Ms. Marida...
Is that them?

Officer:
It's the Garencieres!
The Garuda's defence forces are engaging them!
I'm opening the combat bridge.

Meran:
Not yet.
Have the suits of Nigel's team ascertain the situation.
Objective of our mission is to deliver the Unicorn to the Garuda.
There's no need to get caught up in a little battle.

Nigel:
It's started, huh.

Daryl:
These Zeon bastards don't know when to quit.

Nigel:
All suit, hold to formation!
Don't let the Unicorn out of your sight!

Riddhe:
Stay out of my way!

Zinnerman:
Move the ship in closer!

Floste:
Are you really going through with this?!

Zinnerman:
If I can get aboard, she's as good as ours!

Floste:
Christ sick! Play act your age for it!

Marida:
I'm just... What is this feeling?!

Banagher:
I can't let Ms. Marida and the Captain fight each other!

Nigel:
Watts!

Watts:
What's the hell?!

Daryl:

Watts!

Banagher:
Ms. Marida, listen to me!
The captain is here. The Garencieres is rescuing Audrey!

Nigel:
So, he's refusing to kill, huh?

Banagher:
He's going to board it in midair?!

Alberto:
Ple Twelve!
Shoot down the Base Jabber that transdown?? to the Garuda!
That's the enemy!

Marida:
Roger...

Banagher:
Don't do it, Ms. Marida!

Riddhe:
Great, it's Banagher.

??:
What happened to our escorts from the Ra Cailum?!

??:
That has put used to be?? a straight forward! I won't ??? drag me into???

??:
All crafts are disengaging. We are resisting the damage course of our craft!
（全然聞き取れません。。誰か助けて。。。）

Riddhe:
So, that's what's going on.
All of them are leaned on this!
Now?? if I can help it!

Audrey:
Banagher...

Woman in black suit:
Highness, the shuttle launch has been pushed up.
Please come with me.

Marida:
My master's orders are to secure you and your cockpit!

Banagher:
Please snap out of this!
That's not your master!
He'd never ask that!
You and the Captain should never fight each other!
Now after all you've been through?!

Marida:
I'm Ple Twelve.
My master is Alberto Vist!

Banagher:
No, you're not!
You're Ms. Marida!
And your captain is Lt. Zinnerman of the Garencieres!

Alberto:
Ple Twelve, don't listen to him.
You only listen to me!
He is the enemy.
And he is just saying those things to confuse you!

Banagher:
Try to remember.
Think about everything you and the Captain entrust each other!
Are you trusting...

Alberto:
You don't need to listen to anything he says!
You hear me?!
The Gundam is your enemy!
You will ???...

Marida:
Shut up!

Alberto:
Ple Twelve!

Martha:
Can't you close that hatch?

Riddhe:
I came here to rescue you.

Zinnerman:
What's that?

Banagher:
Ms. Marida?!

Marida:
Gundam is... the enemy!

Banagher:
No, Unicorn...
Don't let it suck you in!
Fight it!

Riddhe:
Hurry! Board the Delta Plus!

Martha:
Ensign Riddhe, have you thought about what you are doing in your position on all this?

Riddhe:
I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't.
And what would happen if you killed Ronan Marcenas's son.
If it?? thought about that.
You can have Banagher and the Unicorn.
However, the girl is coming with me.
Why are you still standing there?!

Audrey:
And after you've taken me away, what are you planing to do after that?

Riddhe:I can figure that out that after we get out of here.

Audrey:
Answer this.
What is it you're trying to protect?
Do you really want to protect just me?
Or is it the secret of the Laplace's Box? Or is it your family's hon...

Riddhe:
I don't give a damn about them!
The explosion that destroyed Laplace a hundred years ago, that was the start of this whole mess.
My father, myself, even all the people here.
We all just pawned of its twisted consequences.
But regardless of how twisted this world has become, ten billion people still live in it.
So, we have no choice.
All we can do is protect it!
I can't let everything fall into chaos like the Zeons once did.

Alberto:
Exactly! That's why we must protect the secret of the Box!
Princess Mineva understands this, as well.
That is why we should...

Riddhe:
Shut up!
You have no right.
Your founder is the one who's responsible for this!
It was a stroke of dumb luck that your founder, Syam Vist, stumbled across the Box.
At first everything what according to his plan, he used the assassination of the first prime minister in the resulting hard-line policies to gain power.
But then Zeon called for Spacenoid independence, the One Year War Broke out, and everything changed.
That's when both Syam Vist who came up with the conspiracy, and the Federal Fovernment which implemented it realize what they'd done.
They understood the significance of their actions and the true power of what the Laplace's Box held.

Audrey:
You know what the box is?!
So, please tell me.
What could it be that's been causing you so much suffering.
This affects every one of us.
We all have the right to know.
Banagher!

Riddhe:
Mineva!
Please come with me, instead!
The Unicorn is dangerous.
With the revelation that Newtypes actually exist, the prayer of a hundred years ago was transformed into a curse.
So, please.

Mineva:
What do you mean...?

Riddhe:
I don't have the power to change the world on my own.
Even if it's an imperfect system, if there's no way to change it, I'll protect it.
And that means...
That means also protecting...

Guard:
Intruder! Watch out!

Martha:
Is it the Neo Zeons?

Riddhe:
Mineva!

Banagher:
Ms. Marida! Please, stop!

Marida:
This light...
This is the light that'll save me.
No one will steal it from me!

Banagher:
No!
Something is not right with it!
The light is really dangerous!

Martha:
What do you think you are doing?!
Bring Mineva back right now!

Alberto:
It's not safe to be here!
The Unicorn and Banshee might be resonating which means 

Martha:
So, what you are talking is another "Axis Shock"?!

Alberto:
And if that's the case,
