  Narrator: It is the year 0079 of the Universal Century. A half century has passed since Earth began moving its burgeoning population into gigantic orbiting space colonies. A new home for mankind. Where people are born and raised... and die. Nine months ago, the cluster of colonies furthest from the earth called Side 3 proclaimed itself the Principality of Zeon and launched a war of independence against the Earth Federation. Initial fighting lasted over one month and saw both sides lose half their respective populations. People were horrified by the indescribable atrocities that had been committed in the name of independence. Eight months had passed since the rebellion began. They were at a stalemate.

Escape from Luna II



Operator: Madagascar locked on to Beacon. Docking speed, maximum minus two. Your attitude looks good.

Operator2: Madagascar entering port, be prepared to secure the ship.

Operator3: Weapon loaders on the double!

Operator4: Recreation services, where are you? Are you ready to receive our troops?

Operator2: Peer number two ready. Secondary battle supplies will be readied as soon as the Madagascar is docked.

Operator3: Roger.

[Elsewhere...]

Bright: We have over 100 civilians with us. We barely made it out of Side 7 when it was attacked.

Guard: Hey, listen, I'd love to take them. But Luna II has been under constant threat and it wouldn't be safe.

Bright: We risked our lives trying to get to a federation base and now we can't even rest here?

Wakkein: Let me explain the situation to you.

Guard: Sir!

Wakkein: My name is Wakkein and I'm the Commandant of Luna II. I take it you must be Bright Noah?

Bright: Sir. The evacuees are completely exhausted, sir, I'd like to find them a place to rest as soon as possible.

Mirai: We're tired, we've been defending ourselves against non-stop Zeon attacks.

Wakkein: We can't take civilians on Luna II at this time.

Bright: Why not?

Wakkein: Additionally, as per orders from Earth Federation Headquarters I must inform everyone that most of you will be sent to earth.

[The crowd isn't very happy about this.]

Wakkein: The following people will be separated from the civilians. Bright Noah. Mirai Yashima. Ryu Jose. Sayla Mass. Kai Shiden. Hayato Kobayashi.

[The kids start making a fuss.]

Fraw: Stop it children.

Bright: Wakkein, give us an explanation.

Wakkein: Cadets and civilians have taken control of Triple A classified technology. Mainly, the advanced prototypes known as White Base and Gundam. This action was unauthorized and there will be a military court martial. White Base shall be impounded now, Gundam shall be secured and brought under military jurisdiction. That is all.

Amuro: I don't believe this! You don't even know what happened on Side 7, do ya? I can't believe you're treating us like a bunch of criminals.

[Captain Paolo is brought in.]

Wakkein: I'm Wakkein, Commandant of Luna II.

Paolo: Right. Take care of repairs to White Base. Also, the children...

Wakkein: Yes, leave it all to me Captain. You must rest well and recover. Then we'll talk some more.

[He is carted off.]

Operator: We'll deal with the Guntank after we secure Gundam.

Transporter: What do we do with it though? It's badly damaged.

Transporter2: Nothing for now. Wakkein's pretty strict about his orders.

Bright: The Musai will be coming! After what happened out there to us I don't think the Red Comet will give up his attacks. To deactivate Gundam would...

Wakkein: You're in no position to dictate our battle strategy.

Bright: Don't you realize? You're underestimating the talents of the Red Comet.

Wakkein: You're an unqualified officer and I can see why you might panic over this Bright. However the Red Comet is an experienced soldier who knows his limits. He's not about to foolishly jeopardize himself or his crew. Challenging Luna II with a small cruiser like the Musai...

Soldier: Let's go.

[Meanwhile...]

Char: Are you sure that Luna II's radar can't detect us?

Dren: Yes sir, the density of Minofsky particles is high enough. We'll be safe.

Char: It's strange being so close to them yet remaining totally undetected. Funny, but now that technology's gotten so advanced, we're back to fighting face to face, the way people did centuries ago.

Dren: Commander, shall we begin our attack on Luna II?

Char: Let's hope the rest of the crew is as eager as you. Luna II is known to have extensive defense facilities.
Your average military commander would never expect a ship like Musai to attack it.

Dren: Shall we proceed with the attack, sir?

Char: I'll let you know when the time comes.

Dren: I remain at your service.

[Char remembers seeing Sayla.]

Char: What if that gun woman really was my sister? It's been 10 years. No... that woman was too brave to be Artesia.

[Flashback.]

Char: Huh?

Sayla: Drop it now. Move and I'll shoot.

Char: Heeyah!

Sayla: Eh?! Ugh!

Char: It wasn't her. Artesia was much more gentle. We'll approach the enemy in commando suits.

Guys: What?

Char: Our primary objective is to capture the Federation's new mobile suit. Second objective, capture the enemy's Trojan Horse warship despite the risk involved. If we can't capture them then we'll destroy them. And that's it.

[A guard brings the group food.]

Food Supplier: Your rations.

Bright: Wait! I want to see Commander Wakkein!

Amuro: You're wasting your time, Mr. Bright.

Bright: But that don't realize that Char is going to attack.

Amuro: I know, but...

Kai: In the meantime, might as well chow down while we can. You gotta eat whenever you get the chance because you need your strength to be clear headed when it's time to go into battle. And know when it's time to run.

Ryu: I think Kai's got a point there, don't you Amuro? Eating is no different than loading your gun, you need lots of ammo. You gotta load up or you're gonna be useless.

[Chars troops head near Luna II. They shoot 2 soldiers patrolling the area and make their way inside.]

Char: Ah.

Soldier: Shall we go in now, Commander?

Char: Hold it.

Soldier: Commander?

Char: Look at that.

Soldier: That's...

Char: An infra-red security system. Deploy the mines without triggering the alarms.

Soldier: Sir?

[Elsewhere...]

Amuro: So you just have to remember that there are 2 settings in the block contact lever. And that's what makes this machine completely different than a Zeon Zaku.

Kai: But for the life of me I can't figure out what makes the Gundam so much better than the Zaku.

Amuro: 'Cause its self learning. Unlike any other Mobile Suit the Gundam has the amazing capacity to keep all its combat experience in memory.

Kai: You mean it actually learns stuff when it's fighting? So what you're saying is the more it fights the better it gets in combat because it remembers what it did and gets even smarter?

Amuro: That's right, that's how a rookie like me can fight against those guys. It's the reason that I can go up against a better fighter like Char. Not because of any talent, but because of the self learning capabilities of the Gundam's computer.

Ryu: (laughs) Hey I'm guessing you had a little something to do with it.

[The Cell shakes and the power goes out.]

Bright: Huh? The artificial gravity must have been cut.

Kai: Maybe the power plant's been destroyed by missile or something, huh?

Amuro: It's Char!

[At the Bridge...]

Wakkein: Ugh, how did the enemy sneak in under our radar?

Assistant: Commandant, it appears the enemy is a special force equipped with Commando suits.

Officer: Well, Bright certainly called it.

Assistant: Sir!

Wakkein: Deploy the Magellan now.




Commercial Break



Bright: Open this door!

Amuro: They're probably so busy with Char that they've forgotten about us.

Bright: Yes, but if it keeps up like this, no!

[The door slides open.]

Bright: Huh? Look at that?

Amuro: Huh? Of course! The power's been cut! I bet every power lock's been disabled.

Ryu: Let's go!

[They go into the hallway.]

Amuro: Where are Mirai and Sayla?

Bright: They should be right next door.

[He opens the door.]

Bright: Mirai! Sayla!

Mirai and Sayla: Mr. Bright!

[On the Magellen...]

Wakkein: Magellen, this is an emergency launch, I want you to clear the docking bay immediately.

[Near White Base...]

Fraw: The Zeon have started attacking this Federation Base. So I want to know why you haven't started moving all of us to a safer area.

Guard: We have no orders from the Commandant.

Fraw: But... if we stay here we're all doomed.

Guard: No, that's not what I'm saying.

[Kika notices Amuro and the others.]

Fraw: Then please contact the Commandant and get us out of here now.

Guard: But I'm sure the Commandant has his hand full right now.

[Kika steps on his foot.]

Guard: Ah!

Guard: What are you, little brat?! Come over here. Huh?

[Amuro and Bright knock out the guards.]

Ryu: Way to go!

Bright: Get everyone together right this minute. We're moving the White Base out before the enemy gets to it. Amuro, work on freeing Gundam and join us.

Amuro: Right.

[The Magellen heads out.]

Zeon Soldier: The Magella is being launched Commander.

Char: Let's go.

[Bombs go off as the Magellen heads outside.]

Wakkein: Ugh!

[The Magellen crashes, blocking the way out.]

Wakkein: Oh no, they set a trap.

[On White Base...]

Bright: The Magellen... it's blocked the exit. So we're going to have to improvise. Start engines on the double. Ryu, Kai, Amuro! Haven't you guys been able to free Gundam yet?

Kai: We just got started. Yelling like that doesn't help, Mr. Bright.

Bright: Sayla, the evacuees?

Sayla: They're moving into the gravity block right now. Fraw Bow has been directing the operation.

Bright: I'll go check on Gundam so we can take off. Mirai, when the engines are up advance the ship slowly.

Mirai: Sir.

[A transport takes Wakkein out of the Magellen.]

Assistant: Are you hurt Commandant?

Wakkein: It's alright, I think I got through this with just a scratch.

[They head near White Base.]

Wakkein: Unauthorized personnel are boarding the White Base. Get this ship along side.

[As Amuro and the others attempt to free Gundam...]

Wakkein: What are you people doing there? I thought it was clear that White Base is off limits.

Amuro: Only Gundam is capable of fighting Char!

Wakkein: I order you to leave.

Bright: I'm willing to face the consequences. I'm not afraid, Commandant Wakkein. You have to decide now who your enemy is sir. Make up your mind if it's the Zeon or us.

Wakkein: How dare you. I'm not gonna lecture you on the chain of command but you're expected to obey my orders or you'll face the consequences.

Mirai: The chain of command is the least of our worries. You soldiers can decide to live and die by any rules you want Commandant. You can play any games you want, but civilians shouldn't have to lose their lives as a result, should they?

Wakkein: What?

Paolo: Mr. Wakkein.

Wakkein: Captain Paolo!

Paolo: I have a suggestion that might resolve this son. The White Base and Gundam as well as the Guncannon and the Guntank were classified as top secret until this moment.

Wakkein: Sir, I know.

Paolo: That's precisely why, quite sadly, those kids are more familiar with the machines than your own soldiers are. They've already handled them in 2 battles and have gained some experience.

Wakkein: But Captain, I...

Paolo: I know, they're basically complete novices. But as your Commandant, I urge you to give them all the support they'll need to win this battle. I'll take responsibility.

Wakkein: Yes, I understand. I'll do exactly what you say, Captain.

[Gundam and the Core Fighter head out.]

Amuro: Ugh...!

Ryu: Ugh...!

[Meanwhile, in their Zakus...]

Char: Mathew, Ficks, listen to me. We will enter the Federation fort and capture the Trojan Horse and Mobile Suit at the same time.

Ficks and Matthew: Roger!

Char: Let's go!

Amuro: It's Char!

[They do battle. Char's Zaku takes out Amuro's beam cannon.]

Amuro: Ah!

[Gundam takes out the Beam sabre to do battle. Ryu flies by the 2 Zakus. Meanwhile White Base attempts to head out.]

Bright: Commandant Wakkein! It's physically impossible for White Base to exit the port unless we destroy the Magellen. If we don't, the Luna fleet will be wiped out and we'll be totally defenseless.

Mirai: It's the Musai!

Wakkein: Destroy the Magellen.

Soldier: Commandant.

Wakkein: Secure White Base exactly where it's positioned. Alert all ships to take cover. Prepare the main gun.

Soldier: Sir.

[The guns are readied.]

Wakkein: Lower the barrier.

[It's lowered. Gundam continues to fight Char and takes out one of the Zakus.]

Wakkein: Aim for the Magellen's reactor core. Brace yourselves for the blast.

Bright: Amuro, get away from the port.

Wakkein: And fire!

[They do, the explosion blows up the remaining Zaku outside and shakes the Musai.]

Dren: Ugh!

[The Musai retreats.]

Amuro: That's Char... what kind of... what kind of man is he?

[White Base heads out.]

Bright: Hey, Captain, we pulled it off, sir. Huh?

[The Captain doesn't respond, he has died.]

[Later...]

Soldier: Commandant.

Wakkein: We'd be better off leaving them alone, at least until they get to earth. That's what Captain Paolo has suggested.

Soldier: Commandant?

Wakkein: There have been so many casualties and now our war with the Zeon is getting more and more violent. We keep losing these people who have so much to teach us. It's a cruel time to be alive, isn't it?

[On White Base, they prepare to eject the Captain's body in a pod.]

Bright: Captain, please accept my word that my crew and I will do everything in our power to safely deliver White Base to earth.

[The pod is ejected.]

Amuro: Dad... where are you?



Preview:
If a space vehicle returning to Earth loses control on re-entry, the atmospheric friction will vaporize it instantly. Char knows it's the perfect time to attack. Will Bright be able to keep his promise after all? Mobile Suit Gundam. Next Episode:
Re-entry to Earth.

Who will survive?
