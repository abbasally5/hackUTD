Haruko：


Players：
(???)feel.

Player1：
That girl's brutal.

Player2：
Every single time at bat, she hit out-of-park homerun.

Player3：
You know that last one she hit? I think it escaped the Earth's gravity.

Player1：
Where the hell did she come from, anyway? Do you know, Coach?

Shigekuni：
Nnnn...

Haruko：
Yes! Thank you!

Opponent：
Hey there! Do you have any other hidden talents?

Shigekuni：
Haruko-san is a pain in the old rear!

Player1：
Haruko?

Shigekuni：
It's pathetic..! Pathetic! Do you hear me!?!
That our team, the Martians,
who are supposed to explode with the eruptions of Olympus, couldn't get a single run!!!

Player2：
Situation's beyond our control.

Player3：
With Tasaku-chan in the U.S., we're out our best player.

Player2：
Yeah, it's been like this (ever since they built that?) new medical plant thing.

Shigekuni：
You aren't trying hard enough; that's the problem!

Player1：
The ability to try hard is a talent, too.

Player2：
If only we had Tasaku-chan’s bat...

Player3：
The only help we’ve got is his brother, if you can call that help.

Players：
Come on, kid! You can do it!

Shigekuni：
Gooooo!!!

Judge：
Steee-rike!
Dead! Dead ball!

Player2：
Who knows if he's any good? He hasn't swung the bat all game.

Player3：
So much for Olympus, this is an extinct volcano.

Player3：
Oh, we need a star player to do for our team what she’s doing for theirs.

Player1：
Is that even possible? Check it out!

Player2：
Tomorrow's game is in the bag!

Shigekuni：
Now, we have a secret weapon.

Players：
(???)

Haruko：


Naota：
Whatever. I don't care about baseball.

Haruko：
You're big liar.

Naota：
Cut it out! Hey!

Haruko：
Anyway, nothing can happen until you swing the bat.

フリキリ
Full swing

Naota：

Kamon：


Haruko：


Kamon：
Oh, I'm sorry Haruko-san!

Naota：
What are you doing to her?

Haruko：


Naota：
Hm. You’re all sweaty. You could at least change out of your uniform.

Haruko：


Naota：


Haruko：


Kamon：
Here, Haruko-san.

Naota：
What are you doing?

Haruko：


Naota：
Just forget it.

(Naota's house)

Naota：
Where'd she go now?

Kamon：
Oh! Haruko-san.

Haruko：
Ah! Look, it's so pathetic!

Kamon：
Haruko-san. Haruko-san.

Haruko：
Come here. I'm gonna stick it in.

Haruko：
Ah! Why won't it stand up?

Kamon：
But, but Haruko-san...

Haruko：
It's because of these extra layers!

Naota：
Ow!

Umpire：
Play ball!

Shigekuni：
Alright! Show no mercy!

Players：
My mother hits better than this guy!


(Riverside)

Mamimi：
Oh... that must be the Great Emperor of Fear, I bet.

Naota：
What are you talking about?

Mamimi：


Haruko：


Naota：
You’re the one who's perverted.

Haruko：
Then let's get ready and swing the bat.

Mamimi：


Naota：
I don't play baseball.

Haruko：
It's Canti's first game today.

Mamimi：


Naota：

Have a drink.

You hit the TV?

It was an accident.

Amarao：


Naota：
On the field?

Amarao：
An older woman; that's a big mistake.

Naota：
Swinging my bat out on the field?

Amarao：


Naota：
Haruko has nothing to do with this!

Amarao：


Naota：
Why do you care?

Amarao：
She's your batting coach, isn't she?

Naota：
I hate her.

Amarao：
Do you like her swing?

I told you! Haruko has nothing to do with this!!
