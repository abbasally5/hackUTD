  Haruko:
Takkun, we are surrounded.

Naota:
It's a full-scale attack. They've got snipers too.

Haruko:
snipers are always so annoying, you know?

Naota:
If we move they will fire.

Haruko:
But we got to do something.

Naota:
You are right. I'll draw their fire. It's dangerous, so...

Haruko:


(Naota's House)

TV:
Brother! I'm a runaway bullet train after all.
Brother! You can't die now!
Wh-what are these pigeons doing again?

Naota:
Hey! What are you doing!

Haruko:
Uh-huh!

Kamon:
Haruko-chan, play nice now.

Haruko:
Not in a 100,000 years will you ever get anything from me but a butt full of lead, compadre!

Kamon:
Ow, ow, ow! You're so cruel, Haruko-chan.

Naota:
What's with those clothes?

Kamon:

Naota:
Uh... I meant normal cloths.

Haruko:

Naota:
Do you find this difficult to understand?

Haruko:
Grab the guitar, and you can be a pop idol! Chicks dig it, dude, pyon!

Naota:
pyon?

Haruko:


Naota:
There’s one that doesn’t fit that list, you know.

Haruko:


Naota:
Haruko! hey! What are you doing!

Naota:
It's dangerous to go waving that thing around.

Haruko:


Naota:
not interested.

Haruko:
I should teach you to be a man, Takkun.

Naota:
Yeah, like you know!

Haruko:
Yeah, Takkun! That's more like it.

Naota:
No, the horn. It's the horn.

Haruko:
Muku-muku! My first kiss!

Naota:
Liar. You've already done it plenty of times, and you know it.

Kamon:


Naota:


Kamon:


Haruko:
I'm for it!

You are so easy, Naota-kun. So easy!

Kitsurubami:


Naota:


Haruko:
But my guitar is not plugged in.

Naota:


Haruko:


Naota:
Ha ha ha! Take that!

Kitsurubami:


Haruko:
Cyborg, my butt!

Mamimi:
Actually, confusing cyborgs with robots is a common mistake.

Kamon:


Naota:
All right. Just one more and I win.

Naota:


Masashi:
Naota, are you okay?

Gaku:
Did you cut them up?

Ninamori:
were you hurt?

Naota:
I'm used to this stuff. I can handle it.

Classmates:
Hmmm.

Naota:
What's this truck for?

Masashi:
Deliveries. We got a part-time job.

Naota:
Job? You are in an elementary school.

Masashi:


Naota:
You mean you do this all the time ?

Ninamori:
That is cool, you know.

Naota:
It's not that! He's the one who wanted to play, right?

Ninamori:
It's a toy, right? does it shoot bullets?

Naota:


Gaku:
So, Naota, did you hear?

Naota:
What?

Gaku:
A rumor.

Naota:
A rumor? about what? What is it?

Gaku:


Masashi:
That’s right! And everyone says you’re controlling that killer robot.

Boys:
Yeah!

Naota:


Masashi:
So it's like you are the pilot! Like a robot commander or something!

Gaku:
Is that true? You are really the commander, Naota? That's awesome!

Haruko:
It's true!

Naota:
Cut it out!

Gaku:
She’s the one who kissed him! Smooch! Smooch! Smooch!

Naota:
Haruko, stop it!

Ninamori:
Oh, I won.

Masashi:
Really? Uh, hold on a sec. Here you go.

Ninamori:
What?

Masashi:
It's a prize. It's supposed to be a pay for work, but...

Ninamori:
It's nice.

Haurko:
Hey, Sameji!

(on the truck)

Ninamori:
You think they are actually going out?

Masashi:
Huh? She’s his brother’s girlfriend. What’s his name? Tasuku? He’s a baseball player.

Gaku:





Mamimi:
Pulpy, huh?

Naota:
hm?

Mamimi:


Naota:
well, I don't like the sour ones, you know that?

Mamimi:


Naota:
Uh...

Mamimi:
I saw you.

Naota:


Mamimi:


Naota:
You saw all about that? Where were you?

Mamimi:
yeah, you are pretty amazing lately, Takkun.

Naota:

(elsewhere)

Naota:


Mamimi:


Naota:


Mamimi:
Why are you doing this all of a sudden.

Naota:


Mamimi:
Takkun, you are not supposed to do things like this with me.

Naota:


Mamimi:
This is because of Haru-san.

Naota:
She has nothing to do with this!

Mamimi:
you like Haru-san.

Naota:
How can I like someone who's insane?

Mamimi:
How much do you like her?

Naota:


Mamimi:
Takkun, don't lie. you like her.

Naota:




Amarao:
(???)




Gaku(Masashi?):
That can't be good.



Amarao:


Haruko:
You're such a drama queen, figure it out.

Amarao:
You're the one who caused all this.

Haruko:
I don't care, you got it?

Amarao:
Your guitar's not up to it. That's it.

Haruko:
You are a million years under-evolved, primitive monkey!

Amarao:
That's discriminatory language used against underdeveloped planets.

Haruko:
FLCL FLCLa, FLCL FLCLa...

Amarao:


Haruko:


Amarao:




Naota:
Hold on!
