  Mamimi:
I saw a god the other day, by the river on a rainy afternoon.
 He helped a kitten that was left all alone.
 It's a god that only I can see.
 A black-winged angel that came down from the heavens just for me.

Naota:
What are you doing?

Mamimi:
Huh? Hey! Takkun!

Naota:
Why're you at my school?

Mamimi:
I felt like it.

Naota:
Jeez, Aren' you embarassed (You're in high school?).

Ninamori:
Who's that? huh?

Gaku:
It's his wife.

Masashi:
Yeah, he is married to an older woman.}

Ninamori:
Are they like, dating?

Naota:
What do you want?

Ninamori:
She doesn't look very bright.

Mamimi:
What that thing on your head, chief? That looks cool! Let me see it!

Naota:
Cut it out! Stop looking at it! I mean it.

Ninamori:
That is so not cool.

(Naota's house)

Haruko:
Okay. Stay still.
 Look at this. It's empty. There is no brain.
 Did you lose it somewhere?

Naota:
You are the one who did this.

Haruko:
Don' blame me, if you go around losing things.
 Some kids are just freaks.

Naota:
Look who's talking, Ms.normal.

Haruko:
At least that I didn't sprout a robot out of my head like some people,
 By the way there is something new there now.

Naota:
It's weird. not normal. these horns sticking out.
 The last one turned into a dumb robot that's living at my house. Living here!
 What'up with that? And it's all because I was run over by your bike.

Haruko:
It'a normal Vespa. Go (and) see for yourself.

Naota:
And you still haven't taken those clothes back!
 People out there are starting to think you're a real nurse!

Haruko:
Ah! Hey there! Haruhara Haruko here! age 19!
 Splendiferous housekeeper at Takkun's house!

Naota:
She's older than that.

Haruko:
But my true identity is this...
 First-class space patrol officer!

Naota:
What a lame stage name...

Haruko:
Chill out! We are not going on star search.

Naota:
That hurt! Why'd Miyu Miyu get on your case yesterday?

Haruko:
Ah...because I'm in trouble. Lots of trouble.
 Because of takkun, they're all on the case.

Naota:
What is this thing anyway?
 How did the robot take x-rays like that?

Haruko:
Because he's a Medical Meccanica robot, probably,
 didn't you know that? They make them there.

Naota:
Why'd he come out of my head?

Haruko:
Yeah That's what I wanna know.
 What's your connection with Medical Mecanica? Huh? Huh?

Naota:
Damn, that hurts! hey, cut it out! hey!... I said stop it!

Naota:
Exactly where does the truth end and the lies begin?
 Samejima Mamimi and Haruhara Haruko.
 A lot of lies are flowing around me.
 These two new horns that sprang up.
 A true story that seems like a lie.

(Title) ファイスタ Fire Starter



Kamon :
Move it! Move it!
 Since you don't have any nifty functions, You can at least make yourself useful around the house.

Naota :
Hey! You're using him outside again!

Kamon :
No, no! This one goes in first.

Naota :
The neighbors have eyes, you know.

Kamon :
You want it all for yourself because you brought it home... Aren't we being a little bit selfish?!

Naota :
It's weird having a robot in the house!

Kamon :
Don't worry about it... so there's a robot in our house.
 Think of the symbolism involved, to have a humanoid robot in a normal household,
 contrast by the abnormal invents of science, which is thereby concluded to exist,
 consider the significance of the human family n, the robot is a part of it and is accepted into it,
 and the social structure m that makes that possible.
 and everyone is bying initial d, robot detective k, Nakamori akina's "young girl a",
 and Satsuki Midori's "passionate woman b". that's the real, true, actual meaning of the robot.

Haruko :
What is he talking about?

Naota :
He wrote a whole book on the deep mysteries of Eva
 The robot was walking around loose yesterday!

Haruko :
There've been a lot of fires 'round here, lately.

Naota :
Yeah, like yesterday.

Kamon :
He deserves a little free time to himself, right? TV-boy?

(Riverside)

Naota :
You are in high school. What do you think you're doing?

Mamimi :
I was playing with Takkun, and my shoes floated away.

Naota :
With who?

Mamimi :
Takkun.

Naota :
That's his name too?

Mamimi :
Yeah chief. This Takkun is hungry. Do you have anything for him?

Naota :
Like what?

Mamimi :
Well, not like chewing gum.

Naota :
You saved him? A stray cat?

Mamimi :
I'm like a god, huh? A protector of the weak.
 The God of the black flames, you know Load Cantido, chief.

Naota :
That's a game right? The one where you burn down the city and everything?

Mamimi :
Yeah I'm addicted.

Naota :
You like games huh?

Mamimi :
You don't wanna play?

Naota :
I'm too busy.

Mamimi :
Yeah you're always busy.

Naota :
Cause there's a bunch of people I have to take care of. See ya.

(After accident)

Police1:
Lady...lady...What year is this?
That...I've never seen parts like these.

Police2:
You can save your breath. This girl has no brains at all.
Just take a look at her.
Barges into an off-limits facility and crashes her bike.
It's been bad enough here lately without this.
Turns out the fire yesterday was arson.
The day before that, a nurse at the hospital was tied up and all her clothes were stolen.

Police1:
There' a lot of depraved people out there, man.

Naota :
Aren't you embarrassed to act like that?

Police1:
Who the hell is this kid? Your brother?

Naota :
No, no relation. I'm from planet Earth.

Police2:
Then get lost, this is no place for little kids!
Can't you see we're working here?

Haruko :
This isn't a place for people to work. There's no even door to get in or out.
 No doubt, you're thinking why would a grade school kid be my guardian, right?

Police2:
Hold on, you're telling me this kid's your guardian?

Naota :
Yeah, I have custody. It's kind of unusual.

Haruko :
So, you came for me huh?
 The rain stopped. I'll give you a reward.
 It's even better than CPR.

Mamimi :
He is not here yet, huh?
 Huh? It's a god.
 It's a god. I can see him, he's really real!
 That time I was saved, he...

Haruko :
So, you usually don't come out the beach like this, huh?

Naota :
Not in October, It's too cold.
 Hey, that's dangerous! Your driving sucks!

Haruko :
I'm a very safe driver.

Naota :
I don't like scary stuff and I don't have a helmet.

Haruko :
You're scared, even though your brain is missing.

Naota :
When you're on a bike, the ocean's a lot closer than you think.
 The autumn salt wind went right through into the back of my nose.
 And maybe it's because, like Haruko said, my head was empty.



(Naota's house)

Mamimi :
Anyway, I'm glad I followed him.

Naota :
Geez... What if someone sees it going around like that?

Haruko :
I saw him at Seven-Eleven.

Naota :
Ah?

Haruko :
He was reading "Hustler"

Naota :
When?

Mamimi :
It's so nice. I wish I could have him at my house.

Naota :
Oh yeah, You are not allowed to have any pets there, are you.

Haruko :
Sameji! Come on inside! It's cold!

Mamimi :
I'm okay out here.

Naota :
My grandfather doesn't like her dating my brother.

Haruko :
That's why you're keeping her out of the house?

Naota :
She says she doesn't care.

Mamimi :
Ah! He's back!

Naota :
Waa! What are you doing?

Mamimi :
Lord Canti!

Naota :
Canti?

Mamimi :
Halo god of dark flames, Canti!

Haruko :
You're late!

Canti :
The stupid clerk at the store was slow...

Naota :
Why are you using him to run errands?

Haruko :
Yeah! I told you to get the kind with the pulp!
 Ah? what's up with that one.

Shigekuni :
Let see it!
I said to get the one with the Anna-Nicole centerfold!
Can’t you get anything right?

Naota :
Grandpa, too?

Mamimi :
It's hustler..

Haruko :
That robot is useless.

Naota :
You're the one broken Haruko?

Mamimi :
Haru-san, you shouldn't do this! Don't you know the canti the god?

Haruko :
What's she on about?

Naota :
Oh, It is some video game. In high school, I guess there are lot of free time.

Mamimi :
Not just a game. The black wings prove. It's him!

Naota :
Don't go out anymore, or I have to chain you down!

Kamon :
Hey, TV-boy! Did you record the Thursday Night Special?

(Riverside)

Masashi :
Over here.

Ninamori :
This used to be a boathouse? This thing?

Gaku :
kinda smells.

Ninamori :
It says. "Do not enter".

Gaku :
Then don't follow us, Ninamori?

Masashi :
Don't worry. The police have already been here.
 I heard it was arson.

Ninamori :
Again?

Masashi :
Arson, arson!

Ninamori:
Probably some stressed out housewife, huh?
 Just too many dirty dishes.

Gaku :
It's not that. UFOs zapped it.
 "Focus" magazine had pictures and all kinds of stuff.

Masashi :
It was foreign agents.

Ninamori :
If it was anything like that, they’d burn something big, not a boathouse.

Gaku :
That’s true. They’d hit, like, a school or something.

Masashi :
There was a school that burned down, wasn’t there?

Gaku :
Yeah, but that was a long time ago, and we were all little.

Ninamori :
Someone burned it down?

Naota :
You can still see part of it. it’s all ashes.

Gaku :
Hey, what's that? What's she doing?

Masashi :
I don' know. I saw some girls bullying her yesterday.

Gaku :
What Uniform is that?

Masashi :
Shinden High school?

Gaku :
Nn? She's in high school?

Ninamori :
At that age, it's really pathetic.

Naota :
"Fire Starter". It's a hand-held video game.
 No one knows how Endsville, the city of devils, was created,
 but as soon as it appeared, it started to grow,
 and slowly eat up the world.
 You are an agent of Cantide, the god of the black flame,
 ...and you must stop Endsville from destroying the world.
 Your only weapon is flame: matches, lighters, and fire-bombs.
 Get the weapons, outsmart the firefighters, hide from the police,
 ...torch the city, and purge its devils.
 But you must be careful; you cannot burn everything.
 If the entire city burns down, there will be no place to live.
 Thus, the battle is hopeless: there is no final victory.
 The only thing you can do is burn and burn and burn.
 Your highest goal is to receive the personal blessing of Cantide,
 the god of the black flame.



(Naota's house)

MiuMiu :
We're talking about you. Nya!

Haruko :
No. I haven't been able to get in touch with him.
 Well, I recruited one of the enemy robots.
 But he's useless, anyway.
 You know the gears are turning, but I don't know what...
Huh?

Fire Fighter :
Please! Stand back!

Naota :
The riverbed... Where'd she go?
 I remember now.
 That fire at the elementary school 6 years ago...

Mamimi :
He's the one who saved me!

Naota :
My brother?

Mamimi :
The protector of the weak, Load Canti.

Naota :
There were rumors that it was arson.
 But they never found out that was sure.
 That's the day Mamimi and my brother met.

(Riverside)

Mamimi :
Why'd you come down here? It's kinda late.

Naota :
You dropped something.

Mamimi :
I don't need it anymore. You can have it.

Naota :
This is where you and my brother went to school, right?

Mamimi :
I hated this place.

Naota :
He is here?

Mamimi :
And so, I wished that it would go away. But it's useless.
 Even if you burn it down, the wreckage and the ash are still there.
 Look, Endsville is burning.
 Now, Lord Canti. Bless me with your kiss. Your absolution... Kiss me...

Naota :
What's this? It's bigger than before.

Mamimi :
Oh no! There's some weird fat thing coming out of Takkun!

Haruko :
How dare you hurt Takkun!

Naota :
Haruko... Mamimi...
 No! Look out!
 Tasuku...
 What are you doing? Let me go!

Haruko :
Takkun is...

Mamimi :
He ate him!
 Stupid! You're not a Lord Canti at all!
 Why'd you have to go and eat Takkun?

Haruko :
Transformation?
 Chance! Huh?

Mamimi :
Takkun, you're all sticky.

Naota :
The ashes are all blown away.

Mamimi :
And something smells.

Haruko :
Shit! Let's get outta here!
 Hey guys, Why did you standing there?

Naota :
At the time, I didn't notice the sirens that were coming toward us.
 But I don't know where the lies and truth begins.
 I asked myself what I could do for Mamimi.
 I decided to stay by her side... forever.
