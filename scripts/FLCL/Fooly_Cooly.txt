  (Under the bridge in Mabase)

Mamimi :
Legs spread, same width as the shoulders, body tight, then hit the ball like you're defeating the enemy.
 Here, the pinky finger is the key! And then you just hit! hit! hit! *kakkiiing* bingo!

Naota :
What're you talking about?

Mamimi :
He, who conquers the left side, conquers the world, chief.
 Setting the parameters - That's really the hard part.

Naota :
You're talking about a video game?


Mamimi :
Hmm? takkun, what're you doing?

Naota :
homework.

Mamimi :
Now, why don't you do it at home?

Naota :
It's not cool...

Mamimi :
You can do my homework, too, if you want, huh?

Naota :
Huh? Your hands are upside-down.

Mamimi :
Heh? ohh... You should play baseball too, Takkun.
 Why do you always carry around a bat?

Naota :
Why do you always hang around here by the river?

Mamimi :
Because, you know... huh? now, why was it?

Naota :
You're in a good mood... huh? You smell like cigarettes. The strong ones.

Mamimi :
I haven't been smoking.

Naota :
Mamimi... Why do you always do this?

Mamimi :
Ahh... earlobes.

Naota :
Hmm? Aww!

Mamimi :
If i don't do it, I'll overflow.

Naota :
What do you mean? What'll happen?

Mamimi :
Probably... Something amazing.

Naota :
Aah!

Naota :
Nothing amazing happens here. Everything is ordinary.
 The huge factory that can be seen from our town,
 The Medical Mechanica plant...
 All the adults got exited when it came here, like it was (a) really big thing...
 The white steam that bellows out everyday at the same time...
 It looked to me like smoke that signified some kind of omen, smoke, that spreads out and covers everything.

Fooly Cooly



(At the bridge, next to a vending machine)

Naota :
Oh? you know I don't like sour drinks!

Mamimi :
Phuaaaah! oh? oh, look, a mark! well, how about a band-aid? here.

Naota :
What?

Mamimi :
It's yours, isn't [is/it]? There's more than half left, chief.

Naota :
You know what? My brother... In the us...
 Hm?


Haruko :
All right! Luuunchtiiiime!

Mamimi :
Already?

Haruko :
Hrgh?

Mamimi :
Takkun!

Haruko :
Stop!

Mamimi :
Uhh... huh?

Haruko :
Native girl must stop!
 Taro-kun just hit his head, so you can't move him yet, understand?

Mamimi :
Oh. ah - but he isn't taro-kun...

Haruko :
Hhh! He's dead!
 This young boy is completely dead, just as Taro would be!

Mamimi :
But he's not Taro, like i said...

Haruko :
Uhh! i killed him!
 I finally found him and yes, I killed him!
 I didn't mean to, it was an accident! kinda...

Mamimi :
His name's Naota.
 I call him takkun, huh?
 It's kinda cute, don't you think?

Haruko :
Ah, let's face it, I definitely, totally killed him, just like that!
 Bang! No. more like - bong, kablam... kunga-ka-splat!
 Oh, yeah... yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... yeeeah... aiie!

Mamimi :
Oh...

Haruko :
Come back to life!

Mamimi :
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!

Haruko :
Mochooooo!

Mamimi :
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!


(in the bus)


Haruko :
Those slow motion scenes are really tough, huh?

Mamimi :
Yeah, you have to hold your breath until they cut.

Haruko :
You can get cramps from that, you know?

Naota :
What? I thought that was a special effect! You're doing the slow motion?



Naota :
Mm. m - mm! mmm-mmmm-m!

Haruko :
Aah! all right! and Taro-kun is back!

Mamimi :
He's not Taro, okay?

Haruko :
Ah, really? That was close, then.
 'Cause if it was taro, he would've just turned into another statistic: "death by motorbike".
 I lucked out! Round two!

Mamimi :
Knockout?

Haruko :
Yo. Yoisshou. Here we go...
 It's... not coming out... guess, I better hit him again.

Mamimi :
{Aaaah!

Haruko :
Uah?!

Mamimi :
He hit his head, all right?
 You said yourself you shouldn't move him.

Haruko :
Tcch.


Naota :
Waah? Waaaah! Aaah-mm-owww!!
 Mmm-mm... What did'cha do to me?

Haruko :
CPR (= cardiopulmonary resusitation).
 What do you think I did?

Naota :
That's not what I meant.
 Pfft!

Mamimi :
Did she put her tongue inside?

Haruko :
You are useless!

Naota :
What're you talking about?

Haruko :
Beeeehh!

Naota and Mamimi :
Waaaaahh!


Mamimi :
Woooo... She's very fast...
 She's at least twenty years old. You need a doctor?

Naota :
A stupid adult, who doesn't know how to grow up.

Mamimi :
Does it hurt?



(Naota's house)

Naota :
Owwwwww!! ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!!
 That doesn't look like a normal bump.
 I can't go to the hospital like this.
 Heeh-heeh-huh. oh. oww... ow.
 Guess I just need to hold it.
 Huh! what do i do at school tomorrow?!
 Oww! ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!!!


(School)

Gaku :
Did you hear, she was around yesterday.

Masashi :
For real?

Gaku :
Yeah, isn't it awesome?

Ninamori :
That really looks bizarre...
 You're hiding something, huh? Come on.

Naota :
Don't be such a brat. waah!

Gaku :
Naota! naota! 'd you hear?

Naota :

Gaku :
The vespa woman!

Naota :
Vespa? A wasp woman?

Masashi :
She has a guitar.

Gaku :
And a cool bicycle bike.

Masashi :
Not exactly.

Gaku :
Some girl of the other class had her super spicy curry bread stolen!

Ninamori :
Super spicy?

Gaku :
And, and...
 When she stings, she leaves a demon mark that show
 she's been doing naughty things and it never goes away!

Ninamori :
What naughty things?

Gaku :
Aah... well...

Masashi :
Like something really perverted.

Gaku :
Ehh? Perverted?

Ninamori :
So. what's that mark?

Gaku :
It's the mark of the deeemooon!

Masashi :
Really? Lemme see!

Naota :
There's nothing to see, cut it out.

Masashi :
Did you see her, naota? did she sting ya?

Gaku :
Pervert! he's a pervert!

Naota :
What're you talking about?

Gaku :
Perveeert!

Ninamori :
Let's see, what's...

Naota :
Nothing amazing happens here.
 Everything is ordinary. So it's not a punishment, like when I go see Samejima Mamimi.
 It's just something i always do. It's ordinary.
 After school, I decided to go the hospital. I didn't wanna think about "Vespa Woman".


(After school)

Haruko :
Hmmmm... yeah, this is just right.
 Has a good feel, too. so, what happened yesterday, after i left?
 Did something happen? heeey, something did happen, right? like, something weird...

Naota :
I don't know what you're talking about.

Haruko :
What's that? a pimple? looks kind of sick.
 Putrefied. You're not hiding something, are you? aah! ah.


(Hospital)

Haruko :
Hmmmmm... Flictonic cliple weber symptom.

Naota :
Aah...? Fl?... Cl?

Haruko :
Adolescence psychological skin hardening syndrome.
 It's a common disease, where children grow horns from trying too hard.

Naota :
That's a lie. I never heard that before.

Haruko :
Yeah. a lie. so, what is the truth... Underneath the band-aid?

Naota :
Waahh!

Haruko :
Aaaaaaah!

Naota :
Waah! What're you doing in the hospital?!

Haruko :
Stay right there... I'm gonna make you feel all better!

Naota :
Waoh!

Haruko :
It's my special treat!
 Huh? where'd he go? heeey.... heeeeey... Taro-kun....



(Naota's house)

Naota :
Photos?
 I don't need to see that. no, I'm busy.
 I don't care. go out with your friends!

(Naota's room)

Naota :
Uhh... hm? hah.
 I dreamt about my brother.
 He was batting and i was dazzled by his swing.
 It seemed impossible that anything could have been so perfect.
 Uh-hmmmm...

Kamon :
Nao... Dinner!

Naota :
Waaah! it's you! the vespa woman!

Kamon :
Why are you yelling?

Shigekuni :
Hurry up and sit down!

Haruko :

Naota :
A.... a-a-aa... ah...

Kamon :
Aah! I just hired her to work for us. Her name's haruhara...

Haruko :
...Haruko. Pleasure.

Kamon :
I got run over, you know... Smashed.

Naota :
By her vespa?!

Shigekuni :
It should have killed him.

Kamon :
But instead, we got you a living housekeeper out of it, didn't we?

Naota :
Are you feeling okay, grandpa?
 I mean... you got a housekeeper?!! a housekeeper?!?!

Haruko :
I was watching taro-kun, he was making out with a high-school girl.

Kamon :
Fondling her yum-yums?

Naota :
I told you, I'm not taro!

Kamon :
Fondling her cupcakes?

Naota :
Waaaaaah!

Kamon :
Who's this slut you're fooling around with, huh? huh?!

Naota :
Ma... mamimi, who were down at the river!

Kamon :
Really? Mamimi?

Shigekuni :

She's cursed, I tell you.}

Kamon :
Ah, your brother's away, so she sinking her fangs into you, Naota!
 Fondling around... Fooling around... Fooly cooly! ... What's FLCL?

Naota :

 You think I'm that crazy?

Shigekuni :
Fooly... Cooly... Fooly... Cooly...

Kamon :
Hah-haaaaa.... Hah-hah-haaaaaaaaa......
 That's what it is, Naota's gundam hammer.

Haruko :
Huh?

Kamon :
It's that Tomino-esque thing, saying it’s gundam,
 but basically, it's giant robot anime, right?

Naota :
I don't know what you're talking about!

Kamon :
Nao's just like me, so he must be doing it -
 I know he’s doing it. doing, doing it, fooly cooly-ing!

Haruko :

Kamon :
So what do you think, Haruko-san?

Haruko :
Whaddya?

Kamon :
Ooh... Cooly Cooly... Like that?

Haruko :
Cooly?

Kamon :
Not like curry powder aphrodisiac licked off my desk...

Haruko :
Death?!

Kamon :
It's this kind of cooly cooly... New modality.

Haruko :
Noodle?

Kamon :

Haruko :

Kamon :

Shigekuni :
Yeah... Cooly Cooly is...
You do it like this with your hands. See?

Haruko :
Oooh right.
 I'm already in that kind of relationship with Takkun here.

Shigekuni & Kamon :
Relationship? How do you mean?

Haruko :
Mouth to mouth.

Kamon :
Mou... Mmmou... Mou...

Shigekuni :
Cooly... Cooly... Cooly...

Naota :
I told you to shut up about that.

Kamon :
So living in the same house you two are already fooly cooly, I see...

Naota :
Who cares if it's fooly or cooly?!

Kamon :
But you're still thinking about doing it tonight, aren't you?

Naota :
Stop acting like a kid!!

Kamon :
With that kind of perverted cooly cooly kind of dream.
 You must be hiding it underneath this band-aid, aren't you?

Naota :
Aaah! I'm not hiding anything!

Haruko :
Band-aid...

Shigekuni :
Cooly... Cooly... Cooly... Cooly...


(Outside)

Kamon :
I'm stuffed. I made a total fool of myself, like always.

Shigekuni :
Oh, this bread is delicious. Is this curry bread?
I think I got some up my nose. It's terrific.

Haruko :
Yeah, stuff it in there.


(Bath)

Naota :
They are in a good mood.


(Naota's room)

Haruko :
Ah, well... They say they're making some kind of medical machines or something.
 Yeah... uh-uh... I didn't know that yet. Yes, that's true. you got a point...
 The channel is improving and the kid I found here is pretty useless. ah.

Miu-Miu:
Meow.

Naota :
Ask before you come in.

Haruko :
I see the bottom is yours, so i'll sleep on top.

Naota :
Really. who are you and what do you want?

Haruko :
I'm just a wandering housekeeper.

Naota :
Tell me the truth.

Haruko :
I'm an alien.

Naota :
Right, 'n this afternoon you were a nurse.

Haruko :
What's underneath the band-aid?

Naota :
Ah... You're really... Freaky.

Haruko :
Under the band-aid, what's it like? Tell me.

Naota :
I don't know.

Haruko :
You're lying. You saw it.

Naota :
Something strange is happening.

Haruko :
What are you hiding under the band-aid?

Naota :
You did it, didn't you?

Haruko :
You should know about your own head!

Naota :
Because you hit me there.

Haruko :
Let's see it.

Naota :
Uh... you came here with my father, why don't you go stay with him?

Naota :
What do you want?

Haruko :
You're the one I saw first, Takkun.

Naota :
Anyway, the top bunk is my brothers so no one else can sleep there.
 That's the way it is.

Haruko :
So, how old is your bother? Where is he?

Naota :
America.

Haruko :
Why?

Naota :
Baseball.

Haruko :
Ah. He's really a good player, huh?

Naota :
Argh. You're sleeping here?
 Is this where you're sleeping? Huh?

Haruko :
It's the only place.
 The top belongs to your brother, right?


Naota :
Aww... She's playing with my head.

Kamon :
Naota-kun.

Naota :
Huh?

Kamon :
We need to talk.

Naota :
About what?

Kamon :
About... Haruko-san.
 You’re against her staying here, aren’t you?

Naota :
Do what ever you want.

Kamon :
Hm. I named you "naota", for "honesty".
 So it would appear... You were run over, too.

Naota :
Ah! mamimi was here?

Kamon :
She asked for some of the... Day old bread we've got on sale.
 It's a mimi type of thing, a dreamy type of thing.
 Is Mamimi's family... poor, [would/what'd] you say? Huh?

Naota :
Ah!

Haruko :
He's alright.

Miu-Miu:
Meop.



(Bridge)

Mamimi :
He gave me... A lot.

Naota :
Did he send you a letter? Hasn't he contacted you at all?
 My brother,... I mean, how much do you like him?

Mamimi :
It’s hard.

Naota :
You saw the sign at our bakery... That bread's old.

Mamimi :
Watermelon.

Naota :
Huh?

Mamimi :
Or like a panda with a mean face...
 Or like sandals with pressure points drawn on them...
 Or the smell of a blackboard eraser...
 Or a sunday morning where you wake up and it's raining.
 Well, I like him more than hard bread.

Naota :
Why don't you stop, then?
 You know, he has a...


(Naota's room)

Haruko :
Oh no. Oooooooooooooohhhh...
 Oh? an American girlfriend!

Mamimi :
Hrmpf.

Haruko :
No! I must respect your brothers privacy. Huh? uh-oh.

Naota :
Hey, what's the matter?

Mamimi :
I'm gonna overflow.

Naota :
Huh?

Mamimi :
I'm gonna overflow!

Naota :
What do you mean? Mamimi! haargh! aah!
 It’s getting... bigger. Haaaah!



Naota :
Where's Mamimi? haaargh! What's going oooon?!

Haruko :
Aigh.

Naota :
Haruko!

Haruko :
Aaaah!

Naota :
Wow!

Naota :
As soon as i said that... I knew, I shouldn't have.
 In that moment, just for a flash, she looked like my brother.


Naota :
Hey!

Haruko :
Aru?

Naota :
I'm stuck on this thing.

Haruko :
Aru?

Naota :
Hey, come on.

Haruko :
Where is he?

Naota :
Unhook me, will ya?


(Naota's house)

Naota :
Anyway, the band-aid came off.
 The horn is gone. nothing. amazing.

Haruko :
You have to roll the dough smooth or the bread will be lumpy...
 Now get it right this time.

Naota :
Only the ordinary happens here.

Haruko :
You call that bread?

Naota :
I've gotta go.


(Bridge)

Mamimi :
You didn't have to run all the way. here.

Naota :
But i said, I don't like sour stuff.
