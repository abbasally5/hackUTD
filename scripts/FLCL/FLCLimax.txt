  Miyajun:
Hai!
Let’s have a fun lunchtime using chopsticks!
Regular use of chopsticks can help prevent Alzheimer’s disease for grandma and grandpa.
Hai!
That’s because chopsticks exercise your brains.
You can do it... just... like... this...
Hai!

Students:
Time to eat.

Masashi:
We always used to use sporks.

Gaku:
Sporks? You mean those fork-spoon things?

Ninamori:
Yeah, sporks are better, for sure.

Gaku:


Miyajun:
Aaahh...! Hai!
... Ow! Ow! My finger’s cramped! My finger...!

Ninamori:
Is something wrong... with Miyajun?

Masashi:
Where’s Naota going?

Ninamori:
To get some sporks.

Gaku:
Oh! You think he’s gonna get some...?

Ninamori:
I don’t know...

Masashi:
Whatever.

Naota:


Kitsurubami:
It’s a hand. Isn’t it?

Amarao:
It’s a hand.

Kitsurubami:
Do you think it will grab it?

Amarao:
I think that it wants to grab it.

Kitsurubami:
But, I mean, that’s just so obvious, isn’t it? A hand grabbing an iron?

Amarao:
Well, that’s just the way it is.

Kitsurubami:
Does it want to iron out the wrinkles?

Amarao:
Of what?

Kitsurubami:
Like the wrinkles in the brain, you know?

Amarao:
Then we’d all be brainless morons. Those wrinkles are how we think.

Kitsurubami:
What?

Amarao:


Kitsurubami:


Amarao:


(Riverside)

Mamimi:
Takkun. Takkun! Where’d you go?

Gaku:
Who thought up sporks, anyway?

Masashi:
I don’t know.

Gaku:
Ah, look over there. Naota’s wife.

Masashi:
Naota, are you just gonna leave her there?

Mamimi:


(elsewhere)

Amarao:


Naota:
Ah!

Amarao:


(Riverside)

Mamimi:


(Naota's house)

Kamon:
Nao! Dinner!

Naota:
Aaah! It’s you!

Kamon:
Why are you yelling?

Shigekuni:
Hurry up and sit down!

Haruko:
Hi!

Naota:


Kamon:
Ah! I forgot to mention. Haruko-san asked me for a little time off.

Shigekuni:
She went to Hawaii! She brought back some spicy fish eggs.

Naota:


Haruko:


Naota:
It was your stupid joke!

Haruko:
Well, if I ever do take a vacation, I wanna be all alone with Takkun!

Kamon & Shigekuni:
Huh?

Naota:
As if I’d go with you!

Haruko:
Aah, you’re embarrassed, you little brat!

Naota:
Stop! Don’t noogie-noogie!

Haruko:
The painful crotch attack!

Naota:
Aah! Don’t noogie there, or you’ll... Aaah!

Shigekuni:
Oh! She can googly-googly me like that anytime!

Kamon:


Kamon:
That’s enough, now! Let’s just stay with anime.

Naota:
Anime?

Shigekuni:
Uh, that’s exhausting!

Kamon:


Naota:


Kamon:
Aah! Fooly...? Cooly...?

Haruko:
Fooly Cooly.

Kamon:


Naota:
I don’t know!

Kamon:


Shigekuni:
Tell us, already, Naota!

Naota:
Grandpa too?

Naota:
What is this? Who cares about Fooly Cooly, anyway?

Haruko:
Fooly!

Naota:
Why do you keep hitting me with that thing?

Haruko:
Cooly!

Haruko:
Fooly Cooly! Fooly Cooly! Fooly Coola!

Naota:
I don’t get it!

Naota:
They’re in a good mood.

(Naota's room)

Naota:
Are you asleep? Who are you, really? What are you? Where did you come from?

Haruko:
Were you just about to confess your great love for me?

Naota:
I didn’t know you were awake.

Haruko:
How embarrassing.

Naota:
Why’d you come back, anyway?

Haruko:
Just to see you.

Naota:
Oh, yeah. Right.

Haruko:
Your head’s the only one that works, Takkun.

Naota:
You’re a liar.

Haruko:
It’s the truth.

Naota:
Are you gonna go away again?

Haruko:
You wanna come with me?

Naota:
Uh?

Haruko:
You wanna throw everything away and come with me?

Naota:
You mean it? Why are you being so nice?

Haruko:
Come on, Takkun. You’re still just a kid, you know ?

Naota:


Naota:


(at the bridge)

Mamimi:


(P.E. class)

Miyajun:
Alright, I’m going to raise it ten more centimeters!

Masashi:
That’s bad.

Ninamori:
What’s bad?

Masashi:
Really bad. He hasn’t been home for days. That’s what I heard.

Miyajun:
Next person!

Ninamori:
He ran away?

Gaku:


Gaku:
Miyajun’s going to his house.

Masashi:
Teacher-parent conference, to see where Naota put (his brain??).

Ninamori:


Gaku:
Huh?

Masashi:
To who?

Ninamori:
To my mother and father!

Gaku & Masashi:
Father?

(elsewhere)

Kitsurubami:
It’s normally connected to this contact unit, but we found it like this.

Amarao:


Kitsurubami:
Yes. Last week, in the maintenance room.

Amarao:


Kitsurubami:
Yeah, but don’t you think the Pirate King has some plan to stop it?

Amarao:
I wouldn’t count on it. He’s not one of us, you know. We’re not that close.

Amarao:
Anyway, we don’t even know where Atomsk disappeared to.

(elsewhere)

Mamimi:


Haruko:
Bleh!

Naota:


Haruko:
Hm... Trade!

Naota:
When you act selfish like that, bad things are bound to happen, you know.

Haruko:


Haruko:
Man, this smoke is really obnoxious.

Naota:
You’re always fighting Medical Mechanica, right? I mean, is that your job?

Haruko:


Naota:
Can you do it?

Haruko:
As long as I have you.

Naota:
Uh! This really tastes bad! Trade me back!

Haruko:
No way.

Naota:
Man, you’re as selfish as ever.

Mamimi:


Mamimi:
Come on, Chief, let’s go find the next one!

Ninamori:
Huh?

Mamimi:
Finally, I think I’ll be able to forgive all of them after this.

(elsewhere)

Masashi:


Gaku:
That Yankee girl with the bleached hair? Fuji’s older sister, you mean?

Masashi:
Everyone from downtown over. Their motorcycles are wrecked, and their cars and bikes.

Mamimi:
Hurry! Someone’s gonna see us!

Masashi:
What’s that, well?

Gaku:
It’s Naota’s wife! The one he dumped!

Gaku:


Mamimi:


Masashi:
That’s my father’s truck!

(Naota's house)

Miyajun:
A pupil should not skip school for no reason!

Kamon:
Yes, I totally agree.

Kamon:


Miyajun:
I’m talking about your son. Can we stay focused?

Kamon:


(Car)

Amarao:
So, Kitsurubami? What do you like to do when you’re off the clock?

Kitsurubami:
Um, I don’t want to talk about that now.

Amarao:


Kitsurubami:
This is a problem!

Amarao:
This kind of problem is nothing. Trust me.

Kitsurubami:
Commander!

Amarao:
Geez! it’s huge!

Mamimi:
Takkun! Listen! You shouldn’t do things like this!

Amarao:


Amarao:
It’s him!

Kitsurubami:
In a green skirt?

Amarao:
Why is he here?

Amarao:
That’s it! He’s a component! He’s part of the terminal core!

(Naota's house)

Kamon:
...that hamster, Hamutaro?

Miyajun:
Aah! That’s my new VW...!

Amarao:
Get out of here!

Naota:
Ah!

Haruko:
Sleeping time’s all over!

Mamimi:
Ah!

Amarao:
I can’t get loose!

Naota:
Oh!

Haruko:
It’s the climax!

Kitsurubami:
Is the plant going to activate...?

Amarao:
Not yet. It’s still missing something. I’m not sure what.

Haruko:
Yahoo!

Amarao:
It’s her!

Amarao:


Amarao:


Haruko:


Amarao:
Don’t do it!

Haruko:
Lunch time!

Amarao:
Aah! We’re screwed!

Amarao:


Haruko:


Amarao:


Kitsurubami:
Commander! Commander Amarao...?

Haruko:
Here he is! Huh?

Amarao:


Haruko:


Haruko:
Don’t get my way, or you’ll regret it!

Amarao:
This is our chance! We can gather up the outsiders and get rid of them all at once!

Haruko:


Haruko:
That guitar!

Amarao:


Naota:
...I love you.

Haruko:
Hm?

Haruko:
Atomsk!

Masashi:
What is that thing?

Gaku:
What’s going on? Oh, man!

Amarao:
N.O...!

Haruko:


Naota:
“So long, Naota.” That’s what Mamimi said when she left school.

Naota:
You could have asked me before you picked that one!

Masashi:
Ninamori?

Gaku:
There’s no practice today?

Ninamori:
You know what, Naota?

Ninamori:
That uniform looks really stupid on you.

Naota:
Yeah? What about you?

Ninamori:
Here.

Naota:
I can’t drink that! It’s too carbonated!

Ninamori:
You really are still a kid.

Ninamori:
Yikes! I’m late for practice!

Naota:
Hey! Give me back my money!

Masashi:
Hey, I (???), Naota.

Gaku:
Give me some too!

Naota:
What?

Naota:


Kamon:
Hey, TV-Boy! When you’re done cleaning the futons, open up the store!

Naota:
...And before we knew it, the seasons had changed.

Shigekuni:
You goofing off again, aren’t you? You lazy butt!

Naota:
Mamimi left town...

Kamon:
But, Dad, I’m really busy...

Naota:
She said she wanted to be a photographer...

Kamon:
People are waiting for “Come on, Mabase’s” next issue, okay?

Naota:
I don’t know what happened to her after that.

Shigekuni:
Aw, shut up!

Miyumiyu:
Meow.
