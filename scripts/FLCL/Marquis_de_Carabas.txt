Secretary :
You handled that well.
The mayor was worried you would be upset.
But you listened very calmly.

Ninamori :
I guess. Anyway this is between the two of them.

Secretary :
You're very mature. It's impressive.
When I was your age, I didn't understand things like this.

Ninamori :
If they both want to split up, and there's really nothing I can do about it.

Secretary :
Well, that's very level-headed of you.
Don't worry, I won't do anything to ruin your father's reputation.
I promise.

Ninamori :
It's OK. I'm not worried.
 You seem like a smart secretary.
 You slept over last night, but you put on a different suit for this morning.

Secretary :
Well then, that's very observant.
And a... You have a extra clothes too? What is that?

Ninamori :
It's a costume for the scool play.
 I got a lead role!

Marquis de Carabas

(Naota's house)

Naota :
Hey! Housekeeper wannabe!
 Cleaning woman!
 Hey! Hey! Bottom-beater!!
 Evil alien.

Haruko :
Oh, what?

Naota :
When you clean up your mess in my room?

Haruko :
What for? The whole store is stacked up with papers anyway.

Naota :
Is he printing more of dumb zines?

Haruko :
Well after all, Monchan is a journalist.

Naota :
Monchan?

Haruko :
He says it sells many things.

Naota :
...with no readers. waa!
What a junker.

Haruko :
Geez, these parts are in perfect shape. How can they just backfire like that,
 Very strange.
 Have fun today!

Naota :
That hurts! Let me go!

Haruko :
I see you're wearing that ugly hat to school again.
 Don't let such a for us.
 I just love the way it feels.
 So soft and fuzzy, they make you feel all snugly, you know.

Naota :
Keep your hands off me.

Haruko :
So, what'up for supper?
 You're probably going to insist on curry again right?

Naota :
I hate spicy stuff.

Haruko :
That' why...
 We're going to buy you?
 Little prince curry blend.
 It's for kids.

(School)

Ninamori :
You're late!
 I told you we have rehearsal this morning, you know you were supposed to be there.
 Naota, You're the lead role.

Naota :
No, you're the lead role.
 Anybody can play my part. I pass.

Ninamori :
We voted for the cast!
 And you got voted into play the cat!

Naota :
The cat?

Ninamori :
Do not miss the rehearsal after school!
 By the way, that hat's really bizarre.

Naota :
Why's she so into this play?

Miyajun :
Cats or felines, loved be baby when there love there years
they have amazing ability to lick any part of their own body.
The cat family includes tigers, Manx's, and animated cats such as Doraemon and Tom and Jerry...

Naota :
Ah...is this?

Masashi :
Is that cool or what?
 I found it in Sakai. It was some store, right out on the rack.

Gaku :
A store that still sells Crystal Pepsi.

Naota :
Pepsi?

Gaku :
You know. The one that Van Halen did those "Right Now" commercials for.

Miyajun :
You there!
What're you whispering about?

Gaku :
Miyajun...

Miyajun :
Demerit! Demerit!
Grade 6, class 1 is officially banned from bringing in anymore reading matter of low taste.
Plus reading something like this in secret is impolite to Ninamori-san!
Just think about Ninamori-san's feelings

Naota :
Kids can't choose the adults in their lives and can't choose the parents.
 Ninamori's father is the mayor of Mabase.
 I don't really get it, but it must make it tough for her.
 Of course, that didn't stop me for ditching the rehearsal after school.
 Playing a talking cat was really too dull.

(Riverside)

Mamimi :
Okay! Here we go!

Naota :
That hat...

Mamimi :
You finally ditched school too, Takkun. Just like me. meow.

Naota :
Is it a cat or what??

Mamimi :
You're delinquent.

Naota :
It's after school!
 Anyway Practicing for school play isn't a regular part of class.

Mamimi :
I used to be in school plays.
 It was really dumb and embarrassing...
 But I was kind of happy, too.
 Mom and dad both came to see me together.
 So, it's a good memory.
 Hey everyone! The king's ears...are really...donkey's ear!



(Dagashiya)

Kamon：
It got a lot of respose, didn't it?
 Well, investigative journalism is the key to community reform.
 My mini-zine of justice "come on Mabase" will bring in so many new customers,
 I'll bet you'll even sell out of your backlog of Crystal Pepsi.
 Oh! well gee... what'd we do, huh? So, how about it?
 More copies while I've still got them ...Oh! about 100? Let's say 80?
 See? Some one wants a copy already.

Ninamori：
...hello?

Kamon：
Yes, here you are, sweetheart.

(Riverside)

Mamimi：
I like your head.
 You just never know what's gonna come out of there next.
 Like Canti and these kitty ears.
 Takkun, you're almost as cute as Doraemon.

Naota：
He does not have ears.

Mamimi：
Anyway, you saved me, right?
 The other night, when you piloted load-Canti and fought that evil robot.
 You're super cool, chief.
 I could hardly even remember what happen that night.
 After I got swallowed up by Canti.

(Naota's house)

Haruko：
Canti! Canti!
 Would you bring the laundry already?
 What's up? It smells...Ah!
 I'm counting on you.

(Station area)

Ninamori：
You're also smart about running away.

Secretary：
That's because I'm a grown-up.
I really like your boots.
Perfect for a nouveau-riche princess.
Good-Bye!

Ninamori：
I don't have a home to go back to.
 All I have is my cat.

Naota：
Ah-Ha!
 The class president hunging around the town like a derelict.

Ninamori：
Wh-what are you doing, ditching rehearsal again?

Naota：
Should I tell everyone where I found you?

Ninamori：
Naota, I swear sometimes I think you really are like a delinquent or something.

Naota：
Could be.

Ninamori：
But that hat still bizarre.

Naota：
So... is there like a major scene at your house right now?

Ninamori：
I don't care.

Naota：
It's just some tabloid thing anyway, right?
 So don't worry about it.

Man on Intercom：
The 5:37 train for (Nakano? Nagano?) will be departing from platform 2 in a few moments.}

Ninamori：
Anyway, it's all true you know.
 But hey, I have a lot of money.
 ...yeah, I'm a nouveau-riche princess.
 So, you wanna go somewhere?

Naota：
Right now you mean?

Ninamori：
Yeah you're Puss'n Boots and I'm your owner.
 So, you just purr and follow my lead.

Naota：
You talking about the play?
 I don't wanna be a dumb cat.
 Anyway, I'm waiting for someone.
 Oh, there she is.

Ninamori：
Who's that.

Naota：
Our housekeeper

Haruko：
That cat almost killed me... Are?

Ninamori：
...Naota!...Nn? What's this?

Haruko：
Don't touch it!
 A young girl like you shouldn't touch with your bare hands!

Ninamori：
What is it anyway? hello?

Haruko：
Yeah...I guess it's an ear.

Ninamori：
What kind?

Haruko：
Cat? looks like...kitty kitty... meow...

Ninamori：
Uh...Uh..Ah..Ao!...My stomach...

Haruko：
I told you not to touch it.
 ...Is that my fault?



(Naota's house)

Kamon:
Pretty good...

Haruko:
It's Manhattan style. See?
 "Little Prince goes to New York: Mild for kids".

Naota:
It's spicy! I don't care if he goes to New York!

Ninamori:
You're just being a kid.
 It's an adult taste.

Naota:
Why doesn't he think it spicy?

Ninamori:
Why is this robot eating?
 What is it?

Kamon:
That's just our television set.

Shigekuni:
W-water!

Naota:
No fair, yours isn't even as hot as mine.

Ninamori:
Why is it walking?

Kamon:
Uh, because it's a TV-walkman. That's why.

Ninamori:
Sony-brand? But it was eating curry!

Naota:
See. You're just milder. Look!
 Light spice.

Haruko:
Would you like chocolate icing on your curry?
 Hey, Canti! I wanna glass of water, too!

Naota:
Go get you own water. you're suppose to be the housekeeper here.

Haruko:
Yes, but only for Takkun.

Kamon:
Ah...Soda.
 How did you like the Soda Ms. Mayor Ninamori's daughter?

Ninamori:
Soda?

Naota:
How do you know about Ninamori?

Kamon:
Well, her father's famous person now. Riiiight?

Ninamori:
No. I don't think it's any big deal.

Naota:　
Haruko hit her on her bike.

Kamon:
She ran her over?
 Hit the mayor's daughter?

Naota:
That's why she started feeling sick.

Kamon:
Oh! Oh no!

Ninamori:
I don't think it's any big deal.
 Please don't tell people the bakery's motorbike ran you over.

Kamon:
B-but you got run over!

Naota:
How's your stomach?

Haruko:
That's kinda rude, Takkun.

Ninamori:
I don't think it's any big deal.

Kamon:
Hey, listen! She can stay at the house tonight.
 Since her familiy's in this big, awful, scandalous mess right now.

Naota:
What are you saying?

Kamon:
No, what I meant was why don't you stay over tonight.
 Get a good rest and forget about all the bad things that have happened.
 Things like getting run over.

Ninamori:
I don't think it's any big deal.

Naota:
Say she says It's no big deal

Kamon:
I can call your father mother to see if it's all right.

Ninamori:
That's Okay. My parents are separate people.
 If my father divorces my mother or gets arrested by the police,
 it's up to him, it's doesn't matter to me.

Kamon:
After-effect?

Haruko:
Restroom? Over there.

(Bathroom)

Kamon:
Are you OK? How's your stomach?

Ninamori:
I don't think it's any big deal.

Kamon:
You think I'm a bad person?

Ninamori:
I'm glad you did it. It finally got rid of secretary. She had to go.

Kamon:
You're so mature for your age.
 Here, this will keep the soap out of your eyes.

Naota:
What? No, it's not like that. Don't worry. Ninamori's very...she's very grown-up.

(Naota's room)

Naota:
Glasses?

Ninamori:
Our secret.
 I wear contacts

Naota:
You've been hiding things.

Ninamori:
Oh! look who's talking!
 Look! your pajamas. they are way too short for me. Can you see?

Naota:
So, you are really sleeping over?

Ninamori:
Well, we already called.
 Oh...your father did.

Naota:
Man, he's only considerate at times like this.

Ninamori:
But we wouldn't tell anyone at school about this, right?

Naota:
Of course not. People can say all sorts of things.
 Starting tomorrow, don't hanging out with me for a while, right?

Ninamori:
Yeah, but tonight it's Okay?
 I mean, not in that way.

Naota:
You know what? Go home. This is weird.

Ninamori:
What's really weird is your ears.

Naota:
You saw them?

Ninamori:
I was told that I shouldn't touch them.
 So, what are they?

Naota:
What did they look like?

Ninamori:
Like cat ears. Perfect to play a cat.

Naota:
Why do I have to be the one of play the cat?

Ninamori:
Because...I rigged the votes.
 So I play the lead and you play the cat.
 You didn't figure it out, huh? See?
 No one would suspect. They wouldn't think the class president would do a thing like that.

Naota:
You mean you cheated?

Ninamori:
You're not mad, are you?

Naota:
You wanted to play the lead bad enough to do something like that?

Ninamori:
Who'd understand better than you?
 You're Puss'n Boots, the one tricks the Prince.
 He hides who he really is, and pretends someone else forever.
 But in time, He becomes the person, so the lies become the truth.
 See? He transcends the mask. Well, don't you get it?
 That's how he finds happiness.
 That's pretty good, right?

Haruko:
You really think so?

Naota:
How long were you there?

Haruko:
The whole time.

Ninamori:
You were listening to us?

Haruko:
Of course not. Anyway why would I care if you cheated to get the lead role and make Takkun pussy cat.

Ninamori:
Who is she really?

Naota:
That's what I wanna know.

Haruko:
Pretty tricky. getting him to act in the play by blackmailing him about his ears.

Ninamori:
It's just a play I'm not hurting him.

Naota:
Really? I'm not so sure.

Haruko:
It's not nice to trick people, you know.

Naota:
Yeah! tell her!

Haruko:
Honest people are more popular.

Ninamori:
Is that right? And you always sleep up there?

Haruko:
Yes, always.

Naota:
Stop it! Ah...

Ninamori:
You're there every night?

Haruko:
Yeah, every night right here all alone with cuddly Takkun.

Naota:
Don't touch me there... Oh, not the ears..

Haruko:
Furi furi furi furi...



(School)

Masashi：
It's a robot.

Miyajun：
Is there a person inside?

Gaku：
Ah! She kissed him on the lips! Did you see that? Smooch! Smooch!

Haruko：
Here.
 It's your lunch. Mild curry for your rehearsal.

Naota：
I don't want it.
 I'm not acting in that play.

Haruko：
You've still got to eat lunch, Takkun.

Naota：
I'm going home now!

Ninamori：
No!
 You've got to stay for rehearsal today.

Masashi：
You have to do what Ninamori's telling you, Naota.

Miyajun：
That's right!
It was a group democratic decision!

Gaku：
Did she put her tongue in? Smoooch!

Naota：
Shut up! You can't tell me what to do.

Gaku：
Smooch...?

Ninamori：
I'm not going to let you go home.

Naota：
I don't wanna do the play, I told you that!

Ninamori：
It's already been decided!

Naota：
Why are you so uptight about it?

Ninamori：
Everyone's going to see it.

Naota：
A few people are gonna see it.

Ninamori：
I want them to see it.

Naota：
Cuz you're a show-off.

Ninamori：
My parents are going to see it together!

Naota：
School plays are for little kids!

Ninamori：
We are kids including you!

Naota：
I'm not gonna play a cat, it's embarrassing!

Ninamori：
You think that embarrassing with a head like that!

Gaku：
Smooooch...?

Schoolmates：
What's that? Ears?
They're cute!

Naota：
Yeah! You're the one who cheated to get the lead role!

Ninamori：
Ow!

Naota：
Hey, wait.

Ninamori：
What's this? What's happening? Ah!

Miyajun：
Make it stop! Ninamori-san!

Gaku：
Ninamoooo...

Naota：
Haruko! Cut it out!

Haruko：
Ukulele, no good.

Masashi：
Pu?

Haruko：
Canti! Let's get outta here.
 Nya nya nya nya!

Naota：
Ninamori! Get away! Oh!

Miyajun：
Demerit! Don't run in the hallways! Hooo!

Gaku：
Miyajun! It's hit-and-run!

Haruko：
All right! This is perfect!
 I got it just where I want it!

Naota：
Wait playing! It's got Ninamori!
 Haruko! No! Ah!

Haruko：
Canti!
 Outta my way!
 It ate Takkun's curry!

Gaku：
Where'd it go?
 Ah! Miyajun's car!

Masashi：
Still paying off the loan.

Classmates：
Miyajun, looks messed up.

Miyajun：
What? (???) Demerit!

Haruko：
Restroom? Over there.

Naota：
In the end, Ninamori's father wasn't prosecuted.
 And he didn't get a divorce.
 Ninamori said she didn't care either way...
 But then, she smiled.
 It was a rumor that she was going to change schools...
 But she's still here.

Miyajun：
Ninamori-san! Break a leg.

Naota：
Oh, look! Glasses?

Ninamori：
They're fake.
