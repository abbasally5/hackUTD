2023--The savage mass murder of over two dozen middle-school children in a Nagano classroom has led to the arrest and conviction of 14-year-old Ganta Igarashi. Horror-stricken and paralyzed with grief, the shell-shocked boy stood helpless as the wheels of justice ground his claims of innocence to dust. Now, behind the iron-clad walls of Japan's first and only publicly-funded Colosseum-style penal colony, he struggles to make sense of the cruel trick played on him by Fate--all for your personal amusement.

Makina:
That odd glow... is it actually coming from him?

Tamaki:
The plan to have a fatal accident befall Ganta Igarashi has been summarily abandoned.
Retool your approach accordingly, please.
We'll see how he fares on his own.
Something tells me... we can expect a lot.

Makina:
Oily son of a bitch...

Three inmates die in your attempt on his life and you're wringing your hands?
Who's this kid anyway? Why should I give a damn?
What are you planning to squeeze out of him, Tamaki?



Ganta:
When the Red Man butchered my friends, it's like he hacked the whole world to pieces, right along with 'em. All I know now, is that I don't wanna die in this hellhole...



Doctor:
Okay? Now try to keep still.

Ganta:
O-ow! Son of a...!

Doctor:
You're young, so that's in our favor. You'll heal up quickly.

Ganta:
Thank you for patching me up.

Doctor:
Now, my records show you're a death-row inmate.

Ganta:
Yeah...

Doctor:
I assume you've been eating your candy?

Ganta:
My what?

Doctor:
The first piece was in your bag.
You did find it, didn't you?

Ganta:
Uh...

Doctor:
You should've been given a survival kit upon admission.
A duffel bag?

Ganta:
Oh... I don't know if it had any candy in it.

Doctor:
I'd look again if I were you.
Granted, it tastes pretty foul, but you learn to choke it down.

You:
Y'know, I bet it fell out.
I did bash into you pretty solid with that cart.

Ganta:
You again...


Aaagh!

You:
Sorry man. If you feel like breaking my nose, I'll totally understand.

Ganta:
It's fine. I don't have much of a sweet tooth.
Anyway, I'm more worried about you.

You:
I'll live. All she did was give me a flesh wound.

Ganta:
Still though... she really unloaded on you.

You:
It's just how things are. But you do adjust to it after a while.
You may hate 'em, and they sure as hell don't make much sense, but following the rules is how you get by.

Ganta:
Apparently...
