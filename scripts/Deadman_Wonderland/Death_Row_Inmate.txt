Boy or girl, young or old, here everyone's wildest dreams roam free!
That's the magic, the thrill, at Deadman Wonderland!

Mimi:
Morning, Ganta!

Ganta:
Oh, hey Mimi!

Mimi:
Breakfast in class again, huh?
Where's your shadow?

Ganta:
No idea...

Mimi:
Whatcha looking at anyway?

Ganta:
Oh... I was just kinda digging up some stuff online about this whole prison-tour field trip thing.

Mimi:
Oh yeah? Are you as stoked about it as I am?
I mean the place is supposed to be tricked out like an amusement park!

Ganta:
I know... it's just cheap they're not taking us somewhere farther.

Mimi:
But Tokyo's nostalgic! Don't you think so?

Ganta:
If you say so, I guess.
It's been ten years since I was there--I don't really remember much.

Yamakatsu:
He's got a point.
We were all kids.
The place could be totally different and we'd never know.

Mimi:
Hey Yamakatsu. What's up?

Yamakatsu:
Thanks a lot for skipping out on me, doofus!

Ganta:
It's not my fault if someone sleeps like a freaking log!

Mimi:
You're killing me! Yesterday the shoe was on the other foot.
How far are you gonna take this?

Ganta:
There wouldn't be a shoe if the genius hadn't lost my save data!

Yamakatsu:
You weren't even past level seven!

Yeah... so... the field trip, right?
Great idea--that'll fly.
Lot of folks think Tokyo, they still think the Red Hole.
Not everybody who survived it has Ganta's knack for selective memory.

Ganta:
Oh c'mon! Not this crap again!

Mimi:
Chill out guys!
Does it matter where they take us? Seriously.
We're less than two weeks out from entrance exams.
The name of the game is distraction.

Yamakatsu:
Well I'm down for it if you are--anything to get us out of here, I guess.

Mimi:
We lived it up at that lame old water park last year.
Where we go doesn't matter.
Let's just make the best of it, okay?

Yamakatsu:
Sure.

Ganta:
That song... I've heard it before... I-I know I have!
How is he...?
Wait! We're on the third floor!

Male student:
Whoa! What the hell!



Ganta:
What just happened?
This is... a nightmare?
Hey Mimi... you okay?

Oh God, please no!



Detective:
Would your name be Ganta Igarashi?

Ganta:
Yeah...

Detective:
We have a few questions for you.
I'm afraid... you'll need to come with us.

Reporter on TV:
Reports indicate that of the 30 middle-school students known to have been in the classroom at the time of the killing, a staggering 29 were slain.

Live reporter:
An inside job. That's what the police are calling it. And indeed, as of this afternoon, the massacre's sole survivor has been formally charged.

Ganta:
This... cannot be real...

Mr. Tamaki:
Court-appointed attorney coming through, gentlemen!
A pleasure.

Ganta:
What?
No, listen... please guys! You have to believe me!
I saw him!
It's the man in red--he's the one you want!
Hold on. I can prove it! He got me!
Huh? Where did it go? It was...

Mr. Tamaki:
Oh you poor, traumatized child! You've been through so much.
No one's going to hurt you anymore, son.

Ganta:
Listen! I didn't do this!

Mr. Tamaki:
Of course not. And I'm going to do everything within my power to ensure the judges know that.



Judge:
Upon careful consideration of the evidence--unprecedented though it may be--I fear... the only recourse that we have... is capital punishment!

Ganta:
This isn't real... it can't be...
I'm a kid... I'm innocent.
Why is this happening to me?

Screw all of you! What the hell is going on!?
Why won't any of you people listen to me!?

Restrained men:
Take your fucking hands off me!
I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

Ganta:
They were my friends--I wouldn't...
[?Akai / Oh God]... Mimi was...

Mimi's father:
Don't you say her name.
Don't you ever say her name!

Voice from holograph:
Startling new footage.

Ganta:
I'm innocent.
I swear it!

Ganta (on the holograph):
Of course I'm gonna walk. Think about it.
No one's gonna buy a middle-school kid being behind something this horrific.
Who's the lawyer here? Shit!
Besides, I'm just a baby--they couldn't throw the book at me if they wanted to!
Am I right?

Ganta:
Who in the hell is that?

Ganta (on the holograph):
It didn't really matter to me who it was, but it's more fun carving up people whose faces you have to look at every day--especially the stuck-up little whores.
I couldn't resist seeing for myself if their cunts were as full of shit as their assholes. Know what I mean?
And, you know, I figured if I'm gonna do any, I might as well do 'em all--kinda like passing out handmade birthday party invitations!
Yeah, yeah, the weapon--c'mon, I thought we'd been through this already! When I hear them say "innocent," I'll show you where it's hidden--call it my God-given right for being the cleverest guy in the room.

Mimi's father:
I treated you like my flesh and blood for the better part of ten years!

Ganta:
I didn't... do this.
I keep telling you...!

Mimi's father:
Why?
Why did you take my little girl?

Ganta:
Listen to me! Please!

Mimi's father:
Let go of me! I have rights!
That little son of a bitch owes me an answer!

Mr. Tamaki:
Sorry about that. I really should have been more cautious.

Ganta:
What?

Mr. Tamaki:
If I'd known someone was filming the two of us, I would have tried to rein in your gloating.

Ganta:
But... but you know that wasn't me!

Mr. Tamaki:
Well there's no point in our filing for an appeal now, I suppose.
No judge worth their salt would ever grant you one.

Ganta:
No, hold on!
Mr. Tamaki! Mr. Tamaki!
Come back!

This is a nightmare... it's gotta be...



Shiro (singing):
Naughty birdy's song is made by pecking holes in trees
Willows, cedars, sycamores and proud oaks reduced to cheese
Woodland gods all in a humph have forever cursed your naughty beak
What it pecks it poisons now--your food, your nest, even your young
Your friends now all fear you
But your tears ring clearly through the wood even as they taint the dew
Such is that sad little birdy
Maybe one day this song will lift the curse and set you free

Shiro:
He's here!--Ganta...



Makina:
Deadman Wonderland.
Built at the epicenter of the sinkhole that engulfed Tokyo a decade ago--an incident popularly known as the "Red Hole."
Welcome to the first and only privately-owned corrections facility in Japan, where inmates pay their debt to society by lubricating the tourist trade.

I am Makina, the chief warden here.
And you are Ganta Igarashi, aren't you?
You look a lot softer than I'd expect someone like you to.
Don't think sheep's clothing will charm anyone into commuting your sentence.

Ganta:
I shouldn't be here...

Makina:
Unless you've been living under a rock, you know how unique our little operation is.
Administrative autonomy, boys and girls! Everything is done in-house.
Hardened capital offenders and snot-nosed juvenile delinquents perform under the same roof.
The money this little institution thrives on is the money you make us.
Does the fresh meat have any questions?

Prisoner:
Uh yeah... how big are those titties?

Makina:
I'm a G.

Prisoner:
Whoa!

Makina:
Your knapsacks contain all the bare necessities, and if you're clever you can survive on them for three days.
Now, a word about your collars.
They're not just how we tag, track, and, if needed, prod you--they're much more involved.
Once a day--

Boy:
Oh crap, dude! I totally didn't even see you there!
Sorry man! I hope I didn't hurt you.

Ganta:
I think I'm okay...

Makina:
Hey, Cart Boy.
Return the goods and I won't slice you open.

Boy:
What?
No... I... that cart's my responsibility.

Makina:
Just remember that I gave you the choice.

Makina's female assistant:
With all due respect, that was overkill!

Makina's male asssistant:
Get the paramedics to Section A now.

Prisoner:
Whoa, bitch is nuts!

Makina:
I don't disagree.
But get used to it!
This is life, boys! Your life.
From now until we see fit to cut you loose.
Or at least, until Wonderland claims you for its own.



Mr. Tamaki:
You can't just slice up anybody--we don't want the newbies left with the impression that this is a free-for-all.
You didn't even go over death-row regulations!

Makina:
And what would have been the point?
5580 was the only short-timer in today's bunch, and his "accident" is just around the corner... unless the decision has been rescinded?

Mr. Tamaki:
I understand. He's the only newcomer to death row out of the batch we received this afternoon, but...

Makina:
The accident's a ridiculous precaution.
He's just a kid--it isn't like he'll last long.
So what are you so antsy about?

Mr. Tamaki:
Chief Warden, when you find a beautifully wrapped present on, say, your vanity table, what do you do?

Makina:
I open it.

Mr. Tamaki:
Indeed, as would I.
Wrapping be damned--I just want to get at what I know is inside.



Man:
Die!



Ganta:
Somebody please just kill me...
...Mimi?

Shiro:
You want me to kill you?
I could do it in one swing!
...Or not, if you dodge me.

Ganta:
What?

Shiro:
Silly boy!

Ganta:
What the hell is wrong with you!?
I don't even know who you are--!

Shiro:
Aha!
That was a fib back there, huh?

Ganta:
Hey! You calling me a liar!?

Shiro:
Yep.
Hear that?
This part wants nothing to do with being killed.

Ganta:
How the hell would you know what it wants...?
We've never even met!

Shiro;
Yes we have!

Ganta:
Oh yeah? Then how come I don't remember you?

Shiro:
Like that really matters!
Ganta and Shiro are the bestest buddies!

Ganta:
Wait a second... how do you know my name?

Shiro:
If you don't want to be killed then cheer up!

Ganta:
What does that even mean?
'Kay look! Last I checked buddies don't try to bash each other's skulls in!
Get me?

Shiro:
So you wouldn't kill your friends?

Ganta:
Of course I wouldn't!
Not on your life!
I never intentionally hurt the people I care about!

Ow!

Prisoner #1:
Do all mass murderers get the four-star treatment here?

Prisoner #2:
Come on, don't provoke the kid!

Prisoner #1:
I'm just saying, ditch-digging doesn't seem like that much of a punishment.

Prisoner #3:
I don't know, man... kid looks more like somebody's doormat than a ruthless psycho.

Prisoner #1:
Use your damn head!
If he looked like what he is he wouldn't've been able to ice so many people!
Don't get any ideas about your reputation meaning jackshit in these parts, schizoid.
Hey... betcha got a hard-on when they passed your sentence--just like when you smeared your little friends' guts all over the wall!

Ganta:
It wasn't me... it wasn't me...

Prisoner #1:
Did you do it because you were picked on?
Did all the popular chicks ignore you?
Come on, your secret's safe with me!
What was it like killing those kids?

Shiro:
You're a big meanie!
Ganta would never intentionally hurt the people he cares about.

Prisoner #1:
You... bitch!

Ganta:
Whoa!

Prisoner #3:
What in the hell is her damage?
I thought all the A Block gimps were on ditch detail.

Ganta:
You bastard!

Prisoner #1:
You should've stayed in the classroom, you little shit!



Mr. Tamaki:
"The man in red," he says.
Few people witness the Wretched Egg in action and live to tell about it.
You're extremely fortunate. Unless... you're not.

There are two choices before you right now, boy:
Get kicked into the dirt and perish... or become my shiny new plaything.



Ganta:
Stop!
You're hurting me!

Please... not like this...
I don't want to die in here.
I want to clear my name.
And him! I want him to pay for what he's done to me!
For what he's done to my friends... for what he did to Mimi!
I want to live!
I want to live!



P.A.:
We have a death-row inmate resisting execution in area D4.
A hostage has been taken.
We need backup requested.

Makina's female assistant:
If you know what's good for you you'll let him go right now!

Prisoner:
Shut your hole!
I need some candy!
Bring me some candy or I'll slit his throat right now!

Makina's female assistant:
Ma'am, the prisoner's refusing to lay down his weapon!

Makina:
And has the data on his collar been confirmed?

Makina's female assistant:
N-no, ma'am.

Makina:
Keep him occupied with small talk.
He doesn't have too long.

Makina's female assistant:
Yes, ma'am!
Um, hey... so, all things considered, it sure is a nice day out...

Prisoner:
Damn it!
Please! Help me!
I don't have any more cast points left!
I'm begging you! I need candy!

Makina:
I'm sorry, but the rules are the rules.



Announcement:
Thank you for visiting Deadman Wonderland!
Come back and see us again soon!

Ganta:
I'm not dead?
Holy crap... how am I not dead after that?
Oh no!
How bad are you hurt?

Shiro:
Wowie... I am so full...

Ganta:
Wake up!

Shiro:
Hey you...
Oh, did I say "full"?
'Cause is it snack time again?

Ganta:
Are you answering me?
Are you hurt?

Shiro:
Oh hey, I've got an idea!
Next time let's eat our snacks together!
Snack time is so much more fun when you have someone sweet to share it with.

Ganta:
Yeah, sure.
I guess you gotta have fun whenever you can...

Shiro:
Yep!
Bestest buddies forever and ever.

Announcement:
Welcome, one and all, to Deadman Wonderland!



<Preview>

Makina:
Death-row inmates must consume candy once every three days.
To secure their portion, they're required to make a spectacle of themselves, risking death virtually every step of the way.
Life's a bitch.
