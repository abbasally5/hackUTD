Miyako:
It was just like I thought.

Hiro:
What?

Miyako:
You're the kind of person that will take care of me.

Hiro:
What's that?

Miyako:
I only wanna be with the kind of person who's not afraid to take care of me.
Because otherwise, I'd be better off by myself.

Hiro:
Miyako...

Miyako:
I don't wanna disappear from anyone's heart.
If there's even a chance of that, I'm better off not even knowing them.
Can I stay here... with you, please?

Hiro:
Yeah.

Miyako:
Will you see only me no matter what happens?

Hiro:
Yeah.

Miyako:
I don't wanna lose anything dear to me ever again.



Kei:
What's going on here?

Hiro:
Kei...

Kei:
Is this how it is? You...

Hiro:
Kei!

Miyako:
Don't go...

Hiro:
Miyako...

Miyako:
Don't go, please.

Hiro:
But Kei is my...

Miyako:
Tell me, who are you going to choose?
You won't go, will you, Hirono-kun?
See only me, no one else. You said!

Hiro:
Miyako...

Miyako:
Please!

Hiro:
Wait! I'll be right back!

Miyako:
So... you're going anyway...

Kyosuke:
Kei-chan...

Kei:
Leave me alone! Don't you wanna get this?

Kyosuke:
What?

Kei:
On film, I mean. Just shoot it! Film it!
You'll never get such interesting footage again! So, film it!

Kyosuke:
Kei-chan...


Hiro:
Kei...

Kyosuke:
It's me.

Hiro:
Sorry, I'm in the middle of something.

Kyosuke:
With Kei-chan? Can we talk?

Hiro:
Wh-What the hell?!

Kyosuke:
That's what I wanna ask! What the hell is going on, Hirono?

Hiro:
Going on?

Kyosuke:
Are you going out with that girl Miyamura?

Hiro:
How is that any of your business?

Kyosuke:
So what about Kei-chan, then?

Hiro:
What are you talking about? Kei and I aren't like that!
What's wrong with you?!

Kyosuke:
You're so half-assed! About school, about work, about your friends!
You hurt people in the process and don't even know it!

Hiro:
I don't even know what the hell you're talking about!

Kyosuke:
You think you can take me down with your left hand alone?

Hiro:
I'm saving my right for work!

Kyosuke:
You even fight half-assed.

Hiro:
What's that?!

Kyosuke:
You're just running from everything!

Hiro:
I've never run from anything!

Kyosuke:
You never think! You just drag everyone around in your mess! It's just as bad as running!
You even ran away from your own father without trying to talk to him.

Hiro:
You don't know anything about my family!

Kyosuke:
Is Kei-chan family... or just a girl?

Hiro:
Neither. Kei is just Kei!

Kyosuke:
That's what I mean by half-assed! Nothing is clear with you! You don't care who you hurt!
That's why Kei-chan's crying. You never decide one way or the other. That's why you're torturing her.
At this rate, she'll just keep following you around like some little lost puppy.
You're the only one that can save her. Hirono, it's up to you.


Hiro:
I'm home. Miyako? Miyako...

Miyako:
Hirono-kun?

Hiro:
Miyako?

Miyako:
I've been thinking...

Hiro:
What?

Miyako:
I think we should stop seeing each other... for good.

Hiro:
What are you talking about, Miyako?

Miyako:
Well, to be honest, it's just too painful for me to think about.

Hiro:
About what?

Miyako:
I know I'm being selfish. I know I'm wrong.
But... your heart doesn't belong to me and only me.
And I can't deal with it.

Hiro:
Miyako...

Miyako:
When someone else takes my place in your heart, I'll disappear again.
So, let's just be adults and say goodbye before that happens. And goodbye!

Hiro:
Wait! Miyako! Miyako! Miyako...


Mizuki:
Hiro-senpai.

Hiro:
Hayama...

Mizuki:
There you are. What are you doing here, huh?

Hiro:
Nothing.

Mizuki:
How were the sandwiches Kei-senpai made for you?

Hiro:
What?

Mizuki:
She called me last night and made me come over to teach her how to make them. I'm so jealous!

Hiro:
Ow! What are you doing? Stop that!

Mizuki:
I thought it was weird that she wanted to learn how to cook all of a sudden.
But she said with a perfectly straight face, " t's for Hiro."
Can you believe it? With a blush on her face, no less!
I didn't wanna do it, but I swallowed my tears and taught her how anyway!
But it was totally against my better judgment. She should have tried cooking for me!

Hiro:
I see...

Mizuki:
Well, as you can see, I got something out of it, too.

Hiro:
What's that?

Mizuki:
A mail-in postcard for a Mimi Comic's special drawing.
This month's prize is really extravagant!
Hey, what are doing? Give that back!

Hiro:
Hayama, are you a fan of Nagi Shindo?

Mizuki:
Yes, because his name sounds like Kei-senpai's.

Hiro:
Is that all? Mizuki, are you starting to read manga by a different writer now?

Mizuki:
Well, Nagi Shindo's work hasn't been that interesting lately in my opinion.
He lost momentum or something. It used to be so much more intense.
It's becoming run-of-the-mill for me. The Nagi Shindo that I knew is gone.
But you wouldn't know what I was talking about now, would you?
You're a boy and this is girls' manga.

Hiro:
Oh... oh, yeah.


Hiro:
Everything half-assed, huh? I already know that.

Yuko:
Knowing and understanding are two different things.

Hiro:
I know that as well.

Yuko:
They're all important, so you don't wanna give up any of them.

Hiro:
Yeah, something like that.

Yuko:
But you'll have to give up something sometime, or else you'll lose the most important thing of all.

Hiro:
But they're all important to me!

Yuko:
You have to decide or risk losing everything.

Hiro:
I can't just abandon something I've already started! I can't and I won't!

Yuko:
You won't be abandoning anything.
You'll make them abandon you.
That's why it's painful.

Miyako:
I... I don't wanna be in pain anymore...

Yuko:
But as long as you're alive, there'll always be pain.

Kei:
I know... I know, but...

Yuko:
Breaking a bond is every bit as painful as being physically torn apart.
Can you endure that?

Hiro:
Even if I couldn't, I can't run away, can I? You're right.

Yuko:
You knew the answer from the start, didn't you?

Hiro:
I knew the answer... but I didn't have the courage to understand it.
I think... I found the color I was missing.


Hiro:
Kei, are you there?

Kei:
What do you want?

Hiro:
You forgot your crutches.

Kei:
Go away.

Hiro:
You'll hurt your leg.

Kei:
It's none of your business.

Hiro:
Kei... thanks for the sandwiches.
I heard about it from Hayama. She also said my manga hasn't been that good lately.
Kei... I've decided I'm going to quit school and focus on my manga.
I was wrong to think I could do both.
I can't do a half-assed job on everything and expect to succeed in anything.
You have to understand that!

Kei:
Does... this have something to do with Miyamura-senpai?

Hiro:
Not totally. But I came to this conclusion myself.

Kei:
So you've decided!

Hiro:
Yeah, I have.

Kei:
I see... You always do this.
You decide everything on your own and move on without me.

Hiro:
Kei...

Kei:
You made your dream come true, followed your passion, and always saw things through even if it was hard.

Hiro:
Because you were always there.

Kei:
What?

Hiro:
I wanted to look good in front of you, as your big brother.
The reason I even started drawing manga was to make you and Chihiro happy.

Kei:
Big Brother...

Hiro:
It was so fun back then. Do you remember... fighting over the manga?

Kei:
Yeah.

Hiro:
What was it called? The series with the surprise ending.
We were all so shocked how it turned out.
I can still hear you, me and Chihiro all arguing about that ending, remember?

Kei:
You always sided with the girl that got her heart broken, huh.

Hiro:
And you said it was her fault for allowing it to happen.

Kei:
Yeah, that's because she was so pretty that she never even made an effort.

Hiro:
Now that I think about it, that series was discontinued.
But we never thought about that, did we? We were all so obsessed with that ending.

Kei:
Reality seems... to be like that, too.

Hiro:
Yeah.

Kei:
There's no such thing as happy endings. Getting discontinued is more realistic.
The world comes to an end all of a sudden, without any warning.
And you feel stupid for dreaming right up until it does, and everything disappears.

Hiro:
Kei, I...

Kei:
Don't say it! Please don't! Don't let it end yet!

Hiro:
Kei...

Kei:
I thought it would last forever--that it would always be you and me.
You'd always be lazy and I'd always have to take care of you.
But you'd be doing your best and I'd be supporting you.
And you'd be supporting me too when times were tough.
We'd fight sometimes and then make up.
The brother and sister would eventually become lovers.
We'd get married and have kids. It would be just you and me.
Finally more than brother and sister. I thought we would last forever...

Hiro:
Kei...

Kei:
How did you imagine it to be? Tell me the truth, please.

Hiro:
I... thought the same thing, more or less, that it would just happen that way for us, but...

Kei:
I see... So I just realized too late.
I should have told you how I feel about you.
I was stupid to think you could read my mind.

Hiro:
Sorry, Kei...

Kei:
Oni-chan! I'm in love with you!
I love you! I... love you so much!
Oni-chan... Ever since we were small... I looked up to you!
Who's so proud of you? I wanted it to last forever!
I wanna go back... to those times we were always together... when you'd always be my Oni-chan...

Hiro:
We can go back! Let's go back, Kei.
Even if we're not related by blood, you're like my little sister!
You're important part of my life, so...

Kei:
So... it was painful for you, too, huh? I see...

Hiro:
Kei...

Kei:
Don't worry. I'm gonna be okay. It'll take some time, I know.
I'll be fine. Don't worry about me.

Hiro:
Kei...


Miyako:
So, this is goodbye.

Yuko:
Running away again?

Miyako:
It's just the way it was before.
I'll close my eyes, so I don't have to see.
Close my ears, so I don't have to hear anything.
That's how I've always lived.

Yuko:
Then you'll end up with nothing.

Miyako:
That's okay. I never expected anything in the first place.

Yuko:
But he really is trying.

Miyako:
I know, but... I'm not as strong as he is.

Yuko:
That's too bad. I wanted to dream...

Miyako:
Huh?

Yuko:
That someday, someone like me could finally be happy.

Miyako:
Uh... dream?

Hiro:
Miyako?

Miyako:
Yes.

Hiro:
Where are you?

Miyako:
It's a secret.

Hiro:
Can we meet and talk?

Miyako:
No, it would only weaken my resolve.

Hiro:
Resolve?

Miyako:
I'm moving out of this town. I'm moving somewhere where no one knows me.

Hiro:
Miyako...

Miyako:
This is my last phone call. My last goodbye to you, since you were so nice to me.

Hiro:
Miyako...

Miyako:
I think I've been testing you all this time, Hirono-kun.

Hiro:
What do you mean "testing me"?

Miyako:
Ever since I met you at Christmas, I've been checking your reaction... to see if you were the kind of person that would take care of me.

Hiro:
I think that's a little bit dramatic.

Miyako:
I don't wanna be with someone who isn't going to take care of me, I told you that.

Hiro:
And how did I do?

Miyako:
What?

Hiro:
Your test. Did I pass?

Miyako:
With flying colors. In fact, you're way, way too good for me.

Hiro:
Don't exaggerate.

Miyako:
Oh, I'm a good judge of character.

Hiro:
Then why are you saying you're going to move?

Miyako:
Because I don't wanna disappear from your heart.
I'm disappearing while you still love me.

Hiro:
Miyako...

Miyako:
There was no sound at my house.

Hiro:
Sound...?

Miyako:
My parents didn't get along. Neither of them spoke to each other in the house.
They couldn't stand the sound of each other's voices or even footsteps.
They were so busy hating each other that they forgot about their daughter--my name...

Hiro:
Your name?

Miyako:
They hardly called my name. That's how little conversation there was.
No matter how good my grades were, or if I came in first place at sports, I never got any praise!
I even learned how to make fish the way my mom and dad liked it.
I cut myself with the knife so many times, but...

Hiro:
Miyako...

Miyako:
You know, it's funny. I didn't mean to copy them, but I found myself holding my breath.
Then they ended up getting a divorce six years ago. And that was a relief for me.
I mean, I was finally free. I could leave that silent house and go wherever I wanted.
I hoped that I could find a place of my own someday, somewhere.
It was liberating not to have to interact with people. I didn't have to worry about being liked or not liked.
I just went wherever... wherever I wanted. That's right, I could go anywhere.
But... being free to go anywhere also means never having a special place to call your own.
There was nowhere I wanted to go, nowhere to go home to.

Hiro:
Shut up!

Miyako:
Huh?

Hiro:
You're just blabbering to yourself!

Miyako:
Hirono-kun?

Hiro:
Why didn't you say anything?!
You were lonely, right? And you were hurting, right?
Then why didn't you tell me?! I was right there!

Miyako:
But, how can I do that? Then you'd only end up feeling sorry for me and I didn't want your pity! 
I just wanted a special place of my own!

Hiro:
I'll be that special place for you!

Miyako:
Huh?

Hiro:
Then your silent house will be in your past! It's all behind you, all right?!

Miyako:
Even if you'll be my special place, I'll be afraid of losing it!

Hiro:
You won't lose it!

Miyako:
How can you say that?!

Hiro:
Believe in me!

Miyako:
I want to! I want to! But I...

Hiro:
What are you afraid of?!

Miyako:
I'm disgusting! You'll end up hating me one day!

Hiro:
No! I won't!

Miyako:
I knew how you and Kei-chan felt about each other! And then I'd never win!
I wanted to be with you so badly! I clung onto you, even if I knew that it would hurt you!
I'm so disgusting! I only think of myself! Can't you see that?!
You'd end up getting hurt by me, I know it!

Hiro:
I'll worry about myself! You just stay the way you are! It's who you are!
Don't change! I made my own decision. The rest is up to you!

Miyako:
Really? Can I believe you?

Hiro:
Yes!

Miyako:
I don't wanna disappear anymore. I don't wanna be ignored anymore!

Hiro:
I'll never let you disappear!

Miyako:
I want you to love me! I want you to eat my cooking while it's warm!

Hiro:
I want to be with you!

Miyako:
I want someone to touch me!

Hiro:
I'll praise you if you get good grades!
I'll scold you if you do something bad!
I'll eat your cooking! You just name it!

Miyako:
Oh, I want to cling to you no matter how pitiful that is.

Hiro:
Do what you want! I'm ready to take everything you have to give!

Miyako:
Hirono-kun, I...

Hiro:
Do you hear what [xxx], Miyako?! Listen to me! I love...

I... I love you!

Miyako:
Hirono-kun!

Hiro:
Just where the hell are we? I went to every public phone in Otowa.

Miyako:
Hirono-kun...

Hiro:
Miyako...

Miyako:
You're responsible now.

Hiro:
Responsible?

Miyako:
You caught me, so never let me go.

Hiro:
I thought you were the type who didn't wanna be tied down.

Miyako:
People change their minds all the time, you know.


Etch me into a memory that never fades.
On the next episode of ef: a tale of memories - ever forever.
Is there a memory that you never want to forget?
