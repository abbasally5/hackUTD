Chihiro:
From yesterday's me, to today's me.
Please don't worry about the missing pages from your diary. I tore them off, because I made a mistake.
Nothing bad happened. In fact, I was very happy. It was almost too good to be true.
But in the end, it was a mistake. It never should've happened in the first place.
That's why I tore the pages out. There's no need to worry about it. Just move on with your life.
Also... whatever you do, don't interact with the boy named Renji Aso.
It'll only cause pain and suffering for the both of you.
To tomorrow's me, from yesterday's me.


Renji:
It's already been thirteen hours... and I haven't seen Chihiro.
She's probably forgotten everything about yesterday.
Not only about yesterday, but everything that's happened since I met her.
Everything about me... about us.

Himura:
Chihiro hasn't changed. She's the same girl that she was before she met you.
Do you even begin to understand why she wrote that particular story?
If you wanna talk, I'll listen. I know it's painful.

Renji:
You wouldn't know the first thing about it.
It's not over yet! You have no clue how we feel about each other!

Himura:
It really is over.
Actually, Chihiro's condition isn't an inability to recall past events.
Memories aren't recognized by her brain.
She's simply repeating the act of chronicling entries that disappear every thirteen hours.
There's no medical cure for her condition.
Even if a miracle occurs, lost entries can never be retrieved.
In any case, there's no such thing as miracles in this world--just the inevitable and accidental, and the things we do. That's all.
Not being able to reach the one you love is painful.
But if you don't move on, your heart will only grow heavier and heavier.

Renji:
What do you want me to do?! You expect me to just forget about her like that?!

Himura:
I'm not saying to forget her. Bearing that burden is one way to live, I wouldn't recommend it though.

Renji:
Can I ask you something, please?

Himura:
What is it?

Renji:
Are you always waiting at this church because you're bearing that burden, too?

Himura:
Who knows? I've forgotten.


Renji:
Come in. What?

Sumire:
I was just wondering what happened.

Renji:
Nothing happened.

Sumire:
Huh... That's right! Isn't your career path questionnaire due soon, Renji?

Renji:
Yeah.

Sumire:
Did you decide what you want to be?

Renji:
No, not yet.

Sumire:
Well, think about it. It's your dream after all.

Renji:
I can't... I can't even think about tomorrow.
How can I think about the future?
Tomorrow doesn't exist.

Sumire:
Renji...

Renji:
I wish there were no such thing as tomorrow!

Sumire:
You shouldn't say things like that!
For all you know, tomorrow may end up being even better than today was.
What's wrong, Renji?! Where are you going?!

Chihiro:
You never know, tomorrow may be better than today.

Renji:
How could you say that?! It won't!

Kuze:
What's gotten into you, young man?

Renji:
Kuze-san...

Kuze:
Here.

Renji:
Thanks. Human beings are so messed up, Kuze-san.

Kuze:
Hm?

Renji:
I'm so depressed, but I still get hungry. I still feel sleepy.
And then, I hate myself for eating and sleeping in spite of the pain that I'm in.
And that just makes me even more depressed.

Kuze:
But that's proof that you're alive.

Renji:
Kuze-san.

Kuze:
What?

Renji:
How am I supposed to make my dream come true?

Kuze:
Well now, in order to make a dream come true, you have to have a dream first.

Renji:
Have a dream first, huh?

Kuze:
It sounds obvious, but it's important.
You need a vision, a will. You could call it "a passion".

Renji:
Passion...

Kuze:
For me, it was my violin.
You have to keep pursuing your passion.
That's the first step.

Renji:
But what if you already have a dream that never happens for you?

Kuze:
Then you'd just have to wait for a miracle.

Renji:
But there's no such things as miracles.

Kuze:
Only the inevitable and the accidental and what we do.
That's Himura's constant mantra.
But sometimes, the results of our actions are inevitable and dreams come true by sheer coincidence.
I don't know if you'd call that a miracle or not.
But there is one thing that I know for sure: without passion, absolutely nothing will happen.


Renji:
Passion... But there're some things you just have no control over.
Once Chihiro's memory's gone, it's gone forever. Our time together... is gone!

Chihiro:
I was always on the verge of tears. In fact, the whole reason I look up is so my tears wouldn't fall.

Renji:
Chihiro... Ah, excuse me.

Chihiro:
Yes? May I ask you something kinda strange?

Renji:
What?

Chihiro:
Have we... Have we met somewhere before?

Renji:
She may not... I'll remember...
I remember everything! Every single moment!
How can I forget?! I can't... It's... It's not fair!
Chihiro...

Chihiro:
I have to say goodbye to Renji-kun soon. I don't wanna do it. It makes me sad.
But I decided from the beginning, this is where it would end. So I have no choice.
I kissed him knowing that it would be the last time. I loved him knowing that it couldn't last forever.
I'm heartbroken, but these feelings will fade with time.
No matter how sad, I might feel at this moment, I know that eventually the pain will disappear along with my memories.
But right now, I still remember everything. And it's killing me inside. I still feel Renji-kun's warmth in my heart.
To be honest, I'd never wanna leave his side. I wanna feel him forever. I wanna spend my time with him.
I don't want to forget or disappear. I don't wanna go back to those days of feeling nothing.
Renji-kun was a knight, who rescued me from my suffering.
He was my Prince Charming. He was the only one who could free me from the shackles of time.
I may forget. I may disappear. But I swear that I'll always love him.
Even though time may pass and all of my memories disappear, all that matters is that, at this moment, I love him with all my heart.
Renji-ken, I wanna thank you for everything. This is... This is goodbye!

Renji:
I can still do something. It might not amount to anything, but... but... I have to try!


Renji:
I know it's still not the whole of them. It's not enough, not enough at all.
But I'll get them back, I promise you! I'll get back every single one of them!
So please! Please don't forget about me!

Chihiro:
You know, thirteen hours... is quite a long time.

Renji:
What?

Chihiro:
Why did you... Why did you go and do that?

Renji:
Chihiro...

Chihiro:
I was trying... to forget about you... but I can't seem to do it.
I just keep thinking about you... over and over again.
I can't... I can't forget. I can't go thirteen hours without thinking about you!

Renji:
Chihiro!

Chihiro:
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry...

Renji:
I'll never let you forget.
I won't let you forget, no matter what!
I'll stay right here, right by your side forever!
So... So...

Chihiro:
Renji-kun!

Renji:
Chihiro! We'll be together... forever.


Yuko:
Everyone has prayed to God at one point in time.
Even if they aren't believers, there will come a day that they will pray with purity in their heart.
Everyone is looking for it, desiring it.
Something created by passion and the need for people to bond...

Emi:
Damn it! I told you to keep the hard disk open! How am I supposed to edit this?!

Club members:
Are you still tinkering with that old footage?

I think you should just give up on that project, just zoom in and start something new.

Emi:
Never mind. Leave me alone!
This can't be the end. This can't be the end of his vision.
I hate to admit it, but it's brilliant.

Kyosuke:
Shouldn't you take it easy for a little longer?
I mean, you were just given the go-ahead today.

Kei:
No way! I can't stay still a minute longer! My body feels so light!

Kyosuke:
Hey, Kei-chan!

Hiro:
Oh, what's for breakfast?

Miyako:
It's actually dinner time. My classes are over already.

Hiro:
You don't have to make anything fancy.
I know you got your exams coming up.

Miyako:
It's no sweat. I'm much smarter than you are, you know.
But don't you think it would be better for you to sleep at night and do your work during the day?

Hiro:
What's the big deal? We have plenty of time together.
And the best part of it is, this way we never get in the way of each other's work.
What could be better than that?

Miyako:
But my menu! My breakfast is your dinner, and vice versa!

Hiro:
Well, I don't have any problem eating steak for breakfast.

Miyako:
That will never happen! I have to make you breakfast!
That's the step you're supposed to eat when you wake up!

Hiro:
You don't have to be so insistent about it.

Miyako:
It's what I want to do! I want you to eat my cooking while it's warm.

Hiro:
Oh, it's from Kei.

Miyako:
How did her check-up go?

Hiro:
One-hundred percent recovered. Off to practice. That's Kei.

Miyako:
I'm so glad.

Mizuki:
Don't you think Hiro-senpai is terrible, pretending to be some stupid rebellious student when he was really my favorite manga artist, Nagi Shindo?
I feel totally betrayed. I'm so mad. I wanna put a curse on him and his family, I swear! It was servant right if I did!

Kyosuke:
Do you really think what he did was all that terrible?

Mizuki:
Mmhmm. Are you taking his side? Is this that male friendship thing?
Are you in love with him or something? Is this boys' love, is that it, huh?

Kyosuke:
What the heck is that?

Kei:
Okay. So, this is it--the right spot.

Kyosuke:
What are you talking about?

Kei:
Beyond this point right here is my own personal battle field.

Kyosuke:
Okay. Well, I'll be rooting for you!

Kei:
Um, senpai...

Kyosuke:
Uh, yeah?

Kei:
Thank you very much.
I can walk on my own two feet now so... I'm always gonna be running.
You just try and keep up with me!

Kyosuke:
Okay.

Kei:
I can't wait forever for someone to take my hand.

Mizuki:
Go for it, Kei-senpai!

Kyosuke:
I... I got it...

Renji:
Oh, by the way...

Chihiro:
Yeah, what is it, Renji-kun?

Renji:
You told me one time that you were more scared of being forgotten than disappearing.
Do you remember saying that to me, Chihiro?

Chihiro:
Yes, I did. I mean, I might have.

Renji:
Okay, then. That's it. I made up my mind.

Chihiro:
Huh?

Renji:
The abandoned train station was my favorite place to visit.
Quiet and deserted, it was an ideal spot to read by myself.
But today, someone was there.
It was a chance meeting... that lasted less than forty five seconds.


Kei:
It's from Chihiro.

Kyosuke:
Oh, yeah? Well, what did she say?

Chihiro:
The first step you have to take to make your dreams come true is to pursue your passion.

Renji:
Yeah, you're right. And thanks to you, I was finally able to find out what my dream was.

Hiro:
I finally found the color I was looking for.

Miyako:
I know. I haven't found my dream yet. But I found my way of life.

Hiro:
Way of life?

Miyako:
To be with you, Hirono-kun!

Kyosuke:
I found what I've been wanting to capture all this time, finally.

Kei:
What I want is to always keep running with all my heart.

Chihiro:
I'm so happy. Finally, all of my dreams have come true and it's thanks to you.

Renji:
But this is not the end.

Kyosuke:
It's actually just the beginning.

Hiro:
You know, that's all right with me.


Yuko:
Oh, good evening.

Himura:
Hey. Yuko, I'm sorry to make you wait for so long.
I see, I hope you can forgive me, Yuko.

Yuko:
It's been a while, Yuu-kun.
