Hiro:
Back then, I didn't understand why people needed human contact.

Kei:
Back then, I didn't understand why anyone would wanna be alone.

Chihiro, come on. Let's go!

Chihiro:
Mmhmm!

Kei and Chihiro:
Let's go play!

Kei:
Let's go!

Hiro:
Huh? Go where?

Kei:
To my house!

Hiro:
What? Wait a minute!

That one encounter... changed my life forever.

Kei:
I believed those happy times would last forever. But...


Renji:
Hi!

Chihiro:
Something is on my head.

Renji:
It's a present.

Chihiro:
A present?

Renji:
Um, I'm sorry about the other day. I broke my promise to you.

Chihiro:
Yeah, that's what I read. But...

Renji:
What is it?

Chihiro:
To be honest, I don't remember anything. So it's not like I'm mad at you.

Renji:
Oh...

Chihiro:
But thank you very much for the present.
Hmm? Cheep cheep? Is there something wrong?

Renji:
No, it's nothing. Don't worry.

Chihiro:
It's very cute. I really can't thank you enough.

Renji:
Is your cold still bothering you?

Chihiro:
I'm fine. I'm feeling much better.

Renji:
Good. I'm glad you're doing okay. Umm...

Chihiro:
What is it?

Renji:
I wanna run something by you.
How would you feel about writing a novel together or something?

Chihiro:
What? I don't understand. Why would you say such a thing?

Renji:
What do you mean "why"? Doesn't it sound like fun? Come on, let's give it a shot!

Chihiro:
But I can't. How could I...?

Renji:
Why?

Chihiro:
Why? You know I only have a 13-hour memory span, right? I told you that.

Renji:
Mmhmm. But I'll help you write it.

Chihiro:
I don't wanna write, okay?!

Renji:
What's wrong?

Chihiro:
Why are you being so mean to me all of a sudden?

Renji:
You think I'm being mean? Really?

Chihiro:
Yes. You're usually more understanding.

Renji:
I don't know. I thought it'd be a nice thing we could do together. It's something I wanted to do for you.

Chihiro:
How is that for me?

Renji:
Because... you told me just a little while back that writing a story was your dream.

Chihiro:
That's true but... that was the me of a week ago.

Renji:
Whether it was last week or today, you're you! And a dream is a dream.

Chihiro:
I'm going home.

Renji:
Chihiro!


Emi:
I don't understand you anymore! It's like I don't even know who you are.

Kyosuke:
Can't blame her. I don't even understand myself.

Kei:
You ditched me at Christmas to spend time with that girl Miyako Miyamura...
Idiot...

Mizuki:
Hey, Kei-senpai! Let's swap manga again, okay?

Kei:
Oh, sorry. I haven't bought mine yet.

Mizuki:
What?! But you're in charge of buying Mimi Comic this month!

Kei:
Ah, sorry. Can you buy it for me this time? You can read it first, I promise.

Mizuki:
I'm already broke this month! I loaned some money to Hiro-senpai, too!

Kei:
What? Why to Hiro?

Mizuki:
Because Miyamura-senpai ditched him.

Kei:
Huh?

Mizuki:
Hiro-senpai was penniless, so I had to lend him money to pay the check.

Kei:
I'm not following what you're talking about.

Mizuki:
The other day, Miyamura-senpai was supposed to treat him to lunch.
But she got mad at him and left, so he was left with the check.

Kei:
So Hiro was... uh...

Mizuki:
Hiro-senpai is really awkward around girls. You should see him blush.

Kei:
I see.


Hiro:
The lighter it is, the farther it flies. I wish they would pay me already.
Hm? Oh, Miyamura. I-I mean, Miyako-san...

Miyako:
The "san" is unnecessary! Next time I won't even answer you.

Hiro:
Fine...

Miyako:
Okay, I'm kind, so I'll forgive you this one time because you seem so penitent.

Hiro:
Forgive me? Did I do something so horrible?

Miyako:
What is that, Hirono-kun? Emergency rations in case of a disaster, right?

Hiro:
That's right. I'm in an emergency situation at the end of every month.

Miyako:
How sad... I know! I'll treat you this time for sure. Let's go eat!

Hiro:
I can't go roaming around town every day. I have work to do.

Miyako:
On a Sunday?

Hiro:
It doesn't matter.

Miyako:
I see. 'Kay, let's go.

Hiro:
Go where?

Miyako:
To your house. Where else, silly?

Hiro:
Huh?

Kei:
It's the end of the month. I guess Hiro probably doesn't have anything decent to eat. Okay!

Kyosuke:
That girl was Hirono's... It was her after all.


Miyako:
Wow! Your place is pretty nice!

Hiro:
Shouldn't you be a little bit more cautious or something like that?

Miyako:
Huh? Why?

Hiro:
You are a girl after all. And you've just wandered into a single guy's apartment.

Miyako:
No worries. I know.

Hiro:
Know what?

Miyako:
That you'll be nice and gentlemanly.

Hiro:
You're just a little too trusting for your own good, you know that?

Miyako:
That's not an appropriate response.

Hiro:
You barely even know me! How can you be so sure I'm not some kind of pervert?

Miyako:
I can tell what people are thinking. And I can tell what kind of person they are.

Hiro:
Liar.

Miyako:
Not to brag, but I am a good judge of character. Because I can...

Hiro:
What is it?

Miyako:
Oh my God! A porn mag! So, this is your type, is it?

Hiro:
It's research for drawing!

Miyako:
Whoa, that sounds pretty legit.

Hiro:
Well look, I really need to get some work done.

Miyako:
Oh, don't mind me. I'll just sit and watch quietly. Really, I'll be right over here.

Hiro:
No way. I'm not allowed to show anyone my work until it's been published.

Miyako:
Then show me something that's already been published.
Loan me some manga that you've written. Then I'll be outta here, I promise.

Hiro:
Why do I have to negotiate with you?!

Miyako:
Show me, please.

Hiro:
You never give up, do you?
Here's a short story I wrote before my series. It's not out in paperback, so I only have a few copies.

Miyako:
That's perfect! Okay, so I'm borrowing this.


Emi:
Kyosuke.

Kyosuke:
Sorry, Club Leader. I'm just getting my camera.

Emi:
Okay.

Kyosuke:
Let me know if you ever need to borrow it.

Emi:
Thanks. We may need to use it on our next production.

Kyosuke:
The film festival...

Emi:
What?

Kyosuke:
The guys were talking so big. Tell them they'd better win the Grand Prix.

Emi:
Is it true? Are you going solo?

Kyosuke:
Yeah. There's an image that I wanna capture.


Kei:
How is it, Mizuki? Delicious?

Mizuki:
Well, that's a pretty bold question, don't you think?

Kei:
What?

Mizuki:
You shouldn't be asking if it's delicious. What you should be asking is if it's edible or not.

Kei:
Is-Is it that bad?

Mizuki:
How do you possibly cook rice this awful? It's terrible!

Kei:
I know my cooking can't be that bad.

Mizuki:
Even a single cup of rice doesn't deserve to end its life so tragically.

Kei:
But I cooked three cups.

Mizuki:
Huh?

Kei:
I cooked three cups. That's how many rice cakes I was able to make from it.

Mizuki:
And the other two cups' worth...?

Kei:
I got it stuck all over my hands.

Mizuki:
Uh, Kei-senpai, you should never cook again. Really!

Kei:
Don't get so mad, okay?

Mizuki:
What possessed you to cook in the first place? It's so unlike you.

Kei:
Well... I feel like I'm responsible for him.

Mizuki:
What?

Kei:
No, uh, nothing! I feel like I'm the one responsible... for all of Hiro's struggles...


Kei:
Oni-chan, this was so good! Read it! You have to read it!

Hiro:
Okay. Hang on just a minute.

Kei:
Huh? Wow!

Chihiro:
Hiro, it looks just like them!

Kei:
Yeah! Draw us some more!

Hiro:
Okay.

Kei:
Hiro, you're a genius!

Hiro:
Really?

Kei:
That's amazing!

Back then, I had so much fun playing with Hiro.

Hiro:
Back then, I was so happy drawing for them. But now...
What am I searching for? The color that's missing in my world?
And when I find it, then what?

Miyako:
Hirono-kun!

Hiro:
Miyako. Wh-What are you doing here?

Miyako:
Never mind. I want your manga right now!

Hiro:
Huh? But I'm writing it now!

Miyako:
No! Your old ones from before! Don't you have any more that you wrote? Come on!

Hiro:
Yeah. I've got three more short stories and what's published of my series.

Miyako:
Can I borrow them? Right now?!

Hiro:
But why right now? Are you telling me you thought they were that good?

Miyako:
Uh, that... Well... Hmm... Hiro, you seem really nervous!

Hiro:
Sh-shut up!

Miyako:
They were brilliant, absolutely brilliant! You're a genius, Hirono-kun!


Mizuki:
I'm Mizuki. Hello?

Kei:
Mizuki, my pork cutlet is charred black on the outside, but raw on the inside.
Do you think it's my frying pan?

Mizuki:
I think it's you.

Kei:
Don't be mean! Tell me what to do!

Mizuki:
Listen to me. When you deep-fry, the oil needs to get...

Kei:
Oh my God! Fire!

Mizuki:
What?

Kei:
Aah! The pan's on fire!

Mizuki:
Huh?

Kei:
Water! Water! Water!

Mizuki:
No! No water! Water will feed the fire! Listen to me! You don't wanna do that!

Kei:
Then what should I do?!

Mizuki:
Mayonnaise! Pour mayonnaise on it! Squeeze the whole tube out until it's out...

Kei:
The whole tube? Wait!

Mizuki:
Kei-senpai? Kei-senpai?!

Kei:
It's out... You did it, Mizuki! You're a genius!

Mizuki:
What do you mean I'm a genius?


Hiro:
Oh... a new record...

Miyako:
Welcome home!

Hiro:
"Welcome home," my foot!

Miyako:
You'd better not hide your spare key in the planter anymore.

Hiro:
Just what do you think you're doing?!

Miyako:
I thought I'd cook you dinner to thank you for letting me read your manga.

Hiro:
Go home, damn it!

Miyako:
But why?

Hiro:
Did you know that it's impossible for humans to digest raw starches?

Miyako:
What?

Hiro:
And excessive artificial seasoning numbs the hands and feet.

Miyako:
What are you talking about?

Hiro:
I vowed never to eat a girl's cooking again! Not ever!

Miyako:
I can see that you have a dark past.

Hiro:
Never mind! Leave me alone! This is the only food I'm going to be eating!

Miyako:
Yay! Here it is! Miyako's special rice with veggies coming up! So, you wanna try it?
It's good, right? You like it?

Hiro:
Yeah, it's delicious!

Miyako:
I told you!

Hiro:
Oh, damn it. I really didn't want the compliment to go to your head.

Miyako:
It's all worth it if someone says it's delicious.
I have to say it's just not a lot of fun cooking for yourself, if you know what I mean.

Hiro:
Why are you cooking for me and not your family?

Miyako:
No, no, Hiro. You're holding your chopsticks wrong.
Come on, you're Japanese. You have to hold them properly... like this!

Hiro:
I have tendonitis in my right hand.

Miyako:
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

Hiro:
That's fine. It's just an occupational hazard.

Miyako:
Is it bad?

Hiro:
No, it's mild. Some people need shots to manage the pain. Mine's not really that bad yet.

Miyako:
Wow, I had no idea.

Hiro:
It's nothing.

Miyako:
It's awful! You don't sleep, eat or play. And you're so tired, you don't even go to school!

Hiro:
Okay then... What do you think?

Miyako:
About what?

Hiro:
Do you think that I'm acting like a fool?
Trying to achieve something that's completely impossible?

Miyako:
No way. There is value in pursuing something you're passionate about.
I don't think you're a fool, Hirono-kun.

Hiro:
Hey, what are you doing?

Miyako:
You can't hold your chopsticks. Ah!

Hiro:
I-I can feed myself, just fine!

Miyako:
No! You need to save your hand for your work. Now open wide, okay? Ah!

Hiro:
Just stop that. I can do it.

Miyako:
No, you can't. Ah!

Kei:
What are you doing...?

Hiro and Miyako:
Huh?

Hiro:
Kei? Kei...


Renji:
Wait, Chihiro, why not? Let's try it. You told me that was your dream, didn't you?
You said there was a story you wanted to write. Please, let me help you do it.

Chihiro:
Do you think you're being heroic?

Renji:
Heroic?

Chihiro:
Do you think you're being cool?
Because I have no future in front of me? Because I'm idle and useless?
So you wanna help me make my dream come true? You think it's so simple?!
You're... you're so right.

Renji:
Chihiro...

Chihiro:
You're right. I'm the one that's wrong.
But still... even so, what do you expect me to do?!
Help me...

Renji:
What?

Chihiro:
I don't understand... why does someone else know more about myself than I do?!
I want to write.

Renji:
Huh?

Chihiro:
I really do want to write. That's the only dream I have left since losing my memory. But I can't.

Renji:
Why not?

Chihiro:
I'm scared. Because if I fail at that, then I'll really have nothing left to look forward to from day to day!

Renji:
I see... I'm sorry. Uh, oh... you don't think you and I could kiss, do you?

Chihiro:
Kissing is for lovers.

Renji:
Can we be lovers then?

Chihiro:
You were mean to me today. So, no. I don't think so.

Renji:
Oh.

Chihiro:
I wish you asked me yesterday.
I was in bed all by myself. I was so lonely. I wanted to see you, Renji-kun. And tell you... that I loved you.
That's what I had written in my diary yesterday.

Renji:
Oh... Bad timing...

Chihiro:
I don't like you today. But I don't hate you, either. Can you hold me a little longer?

Renji:
Hold you?

Chihiro:
Yes... You're warm.

Renji:
Chihiro.

Chihiro:
Yes?

Renji:
Tell me something. What kind of story do you wanna write?

Chihiro:
You're so persistent.

Renji:
Tell me.

Chihiro:
I'm thinking of writing a story... about a girl who's the lone survivor in a world that has been decimated.


Mizuki:
Kei-senpai! What are you doing?

Kei:
Nothing.

Mizuki:
What's that?

Kei:
It's nothing.

Mizuki:
Can I have one?
This is awful. It needs mayonnaise on it or something.
And the bread's all soggy from the vegetables.
Senpai...?

Kei:
It's nothing...
