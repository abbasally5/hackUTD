Kei:
Oni-chan...

Miyako:
Hirono-kun! Are you there? Hirono-kun!

Kei:
Oh, Miyamura-senpai. Can I help you with something?

Miyako:
What? Where's Hirono-kun?

Kei:
I'm sorry, he's sleeping right now. Can you keep it down?

Miyako:
Let me see him! I need to talk to him! I need to see him!

Kei:
Hey! You can't reach him anymore! I'm not going to let that happen.
I'm always going to be by his side. I already told you that! It's over!


Chihiro:
Oh, hi there, Renji-kun!

Renji:
Oh, hello there, Chihiro.

Chihiro:
What's for lunch today? I'm getting hungry.
It's delicious! I always look forward to the lunches you make me.

Renji:
So, how many points do I get today?

Chihiro:
It's just so yummy, I don't think I'll be able to put a number on it.

Renji:
Wow, really?

Chihiro:
Would you mind teaching me how to cook like you do someday?

Renji:
I guess I could.

Chihiro:
My sister is desperately trying to learn how to cook.
I'd like to learn, too. But not desperately.

Renji:
Oh, well, in that case, if you want, we can start you out with something easy.

Chihiro:
Sure!

If you feel you have made an error and...

Kei:
Thanks for waiting!

Hiro:
So, what did they say?

Kei:
Something about the knee something or other and ligament something or other...

Hiro:
Something or other, really?

Kei:
Yeah, they said something or other like that.

Hiro:
Well, you had better know what your injury is called at least.

Kei:
They say, don't move it too much and ice it until the pain subsides.

Hiro:
That sucks. I guess you won't be able to play basketball.

Kei:
Mmhmm...

Hiro:
Here.

Kei:
Thanks. How's your tendonitis?

Hiro:
Pretty much the same. I probably need to take it easy.
Maybe I need to take a break from work for a while. I don't know.

Kei:
What?

Hiro:
You need to give your knee a rest, too. I might as well take a break together.

Kei:
Sure!


Chihiro:
The girl was spending more and more time staring at her drawings.
She began feeling strange, seeing the boy in the pictures.
She began to wonder if they should get married.
There were many stories in her books that talked about marriage.
They all said that marriage was an important part of life.
She decided to study the institution of marriage in greater detail.

Renji-kun, did you decide what you wanna be?

Renji:
Huh?

Chihiro:
Well, you took a career path questionnaire, didn't you?

Renji:
Yeah, but I still haven't decided on anything.

Chihiro:
I think you should become a novelist, too.
It's a lot of fun to write stories.

Renji:
That was a dream of mine I have to admit, but it's probably not very realistic.

Chihiro:
Why is that?

Renji:
When I see what you've written and how amazing it is, I realize how far behind I am.
I'm just not that talented.

Chihiro:
No, don't say that! You're wrong! It's not about talent. You just have to do it!
You're the one who taught me that.
Thanks to you, I'm about to finish my novel when I'd totally given up on the idea.
It's all because of you.

Renji:
Chihiro...

Chihiro:
Even if I only had a thirteen hour memory span, even if I couldn't accumulate life experiences past the age of twelve, there was something I could do.
You taught me that, Renji-kun. So please. Don't give up. If that's your dream, please don't stop pursuing it!

Renji:
Okay.

Chihiro:
Oh.

Renji:
Look, it's still here.

Chihiro:
That's not it.

Renji:
Huh?

Chihiro:
I think it was more like this.

Renji:
Oh, I guess you're right.


Miyako:
It's weird... Why am I depressed?
I'm just... back to the way I was before.
I can go wherever I want.

Yuko:
But this is not a place for you to come to or return to.

Miyako:
Leave me alone.

Yuko:
Nothing good will ever come from clinging to the remains of the past.

Miyako:
I don't know where I should go. I don't know anything...

Yuko:
You know what warmth feels like.
If you remember what it feels like to be loved, in the end, you will choose the right path.

Miyako:
That was so long ago. I don't remember...

Yuko:
But you just did, didn't you?

Miyako:
Maybe we shouldn't have met... Then I wouldn't have remembered what it felt like...


Himura:
Chihiro's condition is getting better?

Renji:
Yeah. Just a little but her memory seems to be improving.

Himura:
That's impossible.

Renji:
But she was...!

Himura:
Unless some kind of miracle occurred.
But there's no such thing as miracles in this world, is there?
There's only the inevitable and the accidental and what we do. That's all.
Do you remember what I said? Maybe... it's already too late.


Answering Machine:
The number you have dialed is out of area or has been disconnected. If you...

Hiro:
Miyako...

Announcement:
Hiro Hirono of class 2-B and Miyako Miyamura of class 2-D.
Please come to the Counselor's Office after school.

Kei:
What was that about?

Hiro:
They were just grilling me about the career thing again.

Kei:
Miyamura-senpai, too?

Hiro:
No, she skipped out.

Kei:
Oh. Maybe you should cut down on your work and focus on school a little bit more.

Hiro:
Yeah. Maybe I'll go to physical therapy, too.

Kei:
Hey! After you submit this month's episode, let's go somewhere! I got this cli...

Hiro:
Hello, yes. This is Nagi Shindo speaking.
Yes, I'm right on schedule.
A one-off story? Well... hmm... okay, I'll give it a try.
I'll send you a plot this week, okay?

Kyosuke:
What?

Hiro:
Yeah. Hi. Goodbye.

Kyosuke:
Was that work?

Hiro:
They want a one-off story from me, on top of my series.

Kei:
And, uh...

Hiro:
It's a great opportunity for me.

Kei:
You just said you were going to take a break!

Hiro:
I can't turn down a job like this!
I'm just starting my career. I have to grab every opportunity!
These kind of jobs don't come easy, you know.

Kei:
I see. Well, go right ahead!

Hiro:
Where are you going?

Kei:
To basketball! I'll get rusty if I don't practice!

Hiro:
Idiot! They just told you, you need to take it easy!

Kei:
I don't see you're taking care of yourself, either!

Hiro:
If you hurt your knee, you'll have to give up basketball!

Kei:
And you'll end up having to give up manga if your hand gets worse!

Hiro:
If I stop writing, then these jobs will go to someone else!

Kei:
My starting position is on the line, too!

Hiro:
Big deal! Is that more important than your walking?!

Kei:
You're an idiot!


Chihiro:
Was I sleeping?

Renji:
Huh?

Chihiro:
How many hours was I asleep?

Renji:
What?

Chihiro:
I need to know how long I was sleeping!

Renji:
Only about... I don't know, five minutes, I guess.

Chihiro:
Okay... That's good.

Renji:
You must be tired.

Chihiro:
No, I'm not. Not at all.

Renji:
Really? Okay, then...

Chihiro:
Yeah. I'm just fine.


Kei:
That idiot! How does he think he's going to handle more work with his attendance record on the borderline as it is?!

Kyosuke:
Don't expect him to think ahead. What made you start playing basketball?

Kei:
I don't know. I just always liked it.
I get such a rush from running a fast break past the defense and scoring a basket!

Kyosuke:
Same as me then.

Kei:
What?

Kyosuke:
I get a rush from capturing a shot out of time and space. That just shakes me to the core.

Kei:
Mmm.

Kyosuke:
It must be the same for Hirono, too. He's way ahead of us.
So... I'm sure he's had his fair share struggles.

Kei:
But he's still a total idiot.

Kyosuke:
You guys are so awkward.

Kei:
About what?

Kyosuke:
Hmm... Never mind.

Kei:
No fair. Finish what you started.

Kyosuke:
When you're trying to capture footage of an animal in the wild, you can't interfere with its activities.
A filmmaker has to capture that animal in its natural state.

Kei:
What does that have to do with anything?

Kyosuke:
If I gave you advice, I'd be interfering with my subject.

Kei:
I'm not a wild animal!

Kyosuke:
Ow!

Kei:
I hate when people get that kind of attitude!
Don't talk like you know everything!

Kyosuke:
But I do.

Kei:
Huh?

Kyosuke:
When I look into my lens, I can see everything.


Himura:
Chihiro! Chihiro! What's wrong with you?

Chihiro:
Uh, nothing. I was just thinking.

Himura:
While you're eating dinner?

Chihiro:
I'm sorry, sir.
11:50 AM, I arrive at the library. Renji-kun arrives four minutes later. We eat lunch in the courtyard.
Lunch consists of fried fish, salad and strawberry jello for dessert.
"It's delicious. I always look forward to the lunches you make me."
"How many points do I get today?"
"It's so yummy, I don't think I can put a number on it."
"Would you mind teaching me how to cook like you do someday?"
"I think it's best if we start off with something easy."
Three more hours to go. It's fine. I still remember.

Himura:
What are you doing? Are you organizing your memories this late at night?
Don't you normally read your diary just before you go to sleep?

Chihiro:
Yes. But this is just a summary.

Himura:
The summary?

Chihiro:
Yeah. My diary entries are only summaries.
If something was fun, that's what I write about.
But that doesn't tell me how fun it was or how I was feeling.
I would love to be able to write down every detail, but unfortunately I can't.

Himura:
So you're trying to recall everything?

Chihiro:
I try to remember all the details as I read it.
Then I can retain it for another thirteen hours.
I can retain everything until I see Renji-kun again, at least I hope.

Himura:
But that will take all night, Chihiro.

Chihiro:
I know.

Himura:
Is that what you've been doing?

Chihiro:
I don't want my time with him to disappear.
Deep down, I'm just an ordinary girl, too, you know.
Can you excuse me? I just need some more time.
What are you doing?!

Himura:
This is useless!

Chihiro:
It's not useless!

Himura:
You can't keep this up! You'll strain yourself!

Chihiro:
I won't strain myself!

Himura:
Listen to me! It's not good for you!

Chihiro:
Give it back! Give it back, please! You just give it back!
It's mine! Renji-kun is in there! Please!
I won't forget this... I will never forget this!

Himura:
Well, okay.

Chihiro:
I'm sorry for being so selfish.

Himura:
Don't strain yourself.

Chihiro:
What was it like when we first met?

Renji:
Huh?

Chihiro:
I wanna etch all the important events into my heart, if I can.

Renji:
Chihiro... You were just looking at the sky.
You just kinda sitting there, looking up.
It was a strange feeling.

Chihiro:
The sky... I think I remember. That's what I was doing.
But not now. I would rather look straight ahead than up at the sky.
Umm...

Renji:
What is it?

Chihiro:
Renji-kun. If you don't mind, may I ask you something?
Would you please hold my hand?
It's okay if you don't want to. We don't have to do that.
It just... I just wanted to know what it would feel like...
I'm sorry--would you mind?

Renji:
Of course not. Give me your hand.

Chihiro:
Okay!

Renji:
Chihiro! What happened?! Chihiro! Chihiro! Answer me!

Chihiro:
The next day, the girl got married.
She rummaged around in the castle and found a dress.
In her mind, she was asked, "will you marry this man?"
And in her mind, she answered "yes."
And she kissed the boy in the picture, smelled like oil.
She gathered random flowers into a bouquet and threw it.
She prepared more food than usual since it was a party.
But her dress was so tight, she couldn't eat very much.
The girl threw the bouquet, the dress and the leftover food over the cliff, but the rest of the garbage.
The wedding was finished.

Himura:
It's you.

Renji:
Um...

Himura:
Come in. Didn't you hear me? Come in!

Renji:
Do they know what happened to Chihiro?

Himura:
Fatigue, lack of sleep and psychological stress.
It was all building up inside, but it found an outlet when she let her guard down.
I tried to wake her up, but couldn't.
She went over her time limit, so I'm just letting her sleep.

Renji:
Her time limit, huh? Chihiro.

Chihiro:
Who are you, senior?
What am I doing here?
What is... What's happening?!
Why am... Why am I grown up all of a sudden?!
What happened to my eye?!

Renji:
Chihiro...

Chihiro:
Where's my sister Kei?! Where's Oni-chan Hiro?! What happened to me?!
Please call...

Renji:
Calm down, Chihiro! You hurt yourself! You're all right!

Chihiro:
But why... Why? What happened to me?!

Renji:
Wait! Don't!

Himura:
Chihiro, do you know who I am?

Chihiro:
You're Big Brother... Himura...

Himura:
You remembered, didn't you? That's good.
Do you understand? This is Chihiro.
She continues to live in this space between twelve years and thirteen hours... forever.


Hiro:
Hello? Hirono speaking. Hello?
Not funny. Is anyone there?
Is it Miyako?

Miyako:
Bingo.

Hiro:
Miyako...

Miyako:
So, you remember who I am?

Hiro:
What happened? I was worried, I couldn't reach you. Turn your phone on!

Miyako:
No, I haven't disappeared. I haven't disappeared. Not yet.


Not knowing hardship is an even greater tragedy.
On the next episode of ef: a tale of memories - forget me not.
Forget me not...
Is there a memory that you never wanna forget?
