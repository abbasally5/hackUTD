Chihiro:
When did I stop trying to step outside the circle? I don't even remember.
Can I really... step outside of it? I'm sorry, I promise that I'll write.


Kyosuke's mother:
That's me.

Kyosuke:
Mom, are you feeling okay?

Kyosuke's mother:
I feel good today. Pretty, aren't I?

Kyosuke:
Yeah!

Kyosuke's mother:
I always wanted to work with this director. My dream came true.
Even if it was only for a moment, it was my dream.

Kyosuke:
Dream?

Kyosuke's mother:
I hope your dreams come true, too.
It doesn't have to be big, just something you really want, something that lasts...

Kyosuke:
I'm fine, Mom. I think I found it.


Kei:
Are you having fun?

Kyosuke:
Sorry. Was I in your way?

Kei:
No, it's fine.

Kyosuke:
You have beautiful form.

Kei:
Can I see that?

Kyosuke:
What? Uh, sure.

Kei:
You're not very good, you know.

Kyosuke:
Huh?

Kei:
They're all close-ups. You said that you liked my form.

Kyosuke:
Oh, that wasn't my objective, I... Ow!

Kei:
The next time you film me without my permission, I'll use my right hand!

Kyosuke:
These athletic types, they're all the same... but...

Hiro:
Eleven AM or PM? I guess Kei didn't come to wake me up today.


Renji:
You don't think... you and I could kiss, do you?

Chihiro:
Renji-kun. It is you, right?

Renji:
Y-Yes, it's me!

Chihiro:
You're here early today.

Renji:
I wasn't very busy. Um... about yesterday...

Chihiro:
It's okay, I know.

Renji:
No, no! I, uh, I wasn't thinking!

Chihiro:
I think I'll try writing a novel. But I...
Since I can only retain memories for no more than thirteen hours, I can't do it by myself.

Renji:
No need to worry. I'll do everything that I can to help.

Chihiro:
Okay.

Renji:
All right. Let's try it together.

Chihiro:
I appreciate it. After all, you do have some responsibility in this.

Renji:
Responsibility?

Chihiro:
You held me and kissed me and confessed your love.
I know this 'cause I read it in my diary.

Renji:
No! I-I didn't kiss you!

Chihiro:
But you did those other things?

Renji:
Well, it was... I-I couldn't help it!

Chihiro:
Was it the heat of the moment?

Renji:
No! I-I didn't mean that! Did you write that in your diary, Chihiro?

Chihiro:
I had forgotten. You know, I had already given up on my dream.
But you brought it back for me, Renji-kun. You made me remember.

Renji:
Chihiro...

Chihiro:
I think that... I'd like to try again.



Kei:
Miyamura-senpai!

Miyako:
What is it? Kei Shindo, is that right?

Kei:
I'd like to have a word with you, please. Do you have a couple of minutes?

Miyako:
Is it going to take long?

Kei:
Maybe it will.

Miyako:
Then, I really don't wanna hear it. I'd rather go home now.

Kei:
Go home?!

Miyako:
You're welcome to leave school with me if you want to.
If you think it's worth cutting class to follow me and talk.


Renji:
So, tell me. Where do you wanna start writing?

Chihiro:
I don't know.

Renji:
Is something wrong?

Chihiro:
I'm checking to see what time I ate this morning.
Let's see... I ate breakfast at 7:00 AM, so I guess it's almost time for lunch.

Renji:
Let me think. If you'd really like to, I guess we could go out.
But we could save some money if we ate at my place.
I could make something at home.

Chihiro:
Is that okay?

Renji:
Sure!

Chihiro:
I'm a little surprised. I'm curious to see what you can cook!

Renji:
What? Why would I cook?

Chihiro:
You just said you would make something at home, didn't you?

Renji:
Did I?

Chihiro:
Yes, you did!

Renji:
Chihiro, you actually have a really good memory, don't you?

Chihiro:
Only if it's within thirteen hours.


Sumire:
Oh my goodness! A welcome!

Chihiro:
How do you do? I'm Chihiro Shindo.

Sumire:
How very nice to meet you. I'm Sumire Aso.

Chihiro:
Are you, um... Renji's sister perhaps?

Sumire:
No, his wife!

Renji:
Please excuse her. I know it might be hard to believe from the way she acts, but that's actually my mom.

Chihiro:
Oh, she's your mother?

Sumire:
Yup!

Renji:
And this is our next-door neighbor, Kuze-san.

Kuze:
Hi, there. I'm a bright, reliable and charming young man.

Chihiro:
Hello.

Kuze:
Hello there.

Sumire:
So Chihiro, what kind of relationship do you and Renji have?

Chihiro:
What kind of relationship? Well, I think we're just friends at this point.

Kuze:
In my experience, men and women are never "just friends."

Sumire:
Mmm, really? Is that how it is these days?

Kuze:
Most of the time, it's the guy who gets his heart broken.

Chihiro:
Um, I don't think Renji feels that way.
He knows I wouldn't ever do something like that.

Kuze:
My my.

Sumire:
Goodness! I don't know what you see in him, Chihiro.
Even from my perspective, he's an idiot!

Chihiro:
What? No, he isn't!

Kuze:
But that's the kind of thing that arouses the maternal instinct from women, am I right?

Sumire:
Maybe so. But I was beginning to think that he'd never find somebody.
And now, I'm so happy for my idiot son!

Kuze:
It's entertaining to watch anyway.

Sumire:
So Chihiro, what part of Renji was it that you fell in love with?

Renji:
Cut it out! You're obviously embarrassing her!

Sumire:
Don't be silly. She's fine. Right, Chihiro-chan?

Chihiro:
Yes! This is fun!

Sumire:
See?

Renji:
Uh...

Chihiro:
Uh-huh.


Miyako:
So, you're coming with me after all.

Kei:
I always finish what I start.

Miyako:
You're so serious. Did you get the Perfect Attendance Award?

Kei:
That is not the point right now!

Miyako:
So do tell me--what is the point you're getting at?

Kei:
Th-That's, uh... Hirono-senpai is at a critical juncture in his life.
His grades're barely passing. His attendance record is appalling.
There's a chance he may even have to end up repeating a grade, okay?
But he can make a comeback.
If he just starts studying and coming to class, he can still move up to the next grade, okay?
So please don't jeopardize everything by dragging him out of school all the time!

Miyako:
Oh, well I guess we both lose.

Kei:
What?

Miyako:
This wasn't worth ruining your perfect attendance record over.
I mean, gosh, I thought it would be something more interesting.

Kei:
I don't care one bit if it's interesting to you or not! It's him I'm worried about!
My bro Hirono-senpai's future is on the line and you don't care!

Miyako:
But isn't that something Hirono-kun should worry about for himself?
The only one who can decide his future is Hirono-kun.
A third party... really can't do much about it. You know what I mean?

Kei:
A third... party...?

Miyako:
Or can you really take responsibility for that?

Kei:
What?

Miyako:
Can you guarantee that if he goes to school, he's gonna be a big success?

Kei:
I don't...

Miyako:
If he puts his dream on hold and focuses on school, can you promise that he'll have the success as a manga artist he wants?
Hirono-kun is an adult. He can make his own decisions--about his attendance, his manga and studies, basically his life. Don't you think?

Kei:
But... he's still a student, so he should focus on studying for now.

Miyako:
Is it so easy to become a manga artist? Can you just quit and start over again?
He's working so hard in spite of his tendonitis. If it winds up being all for nothing, can you take responsibility?
And Kei-chan, you're not being totally honest with yourself, are you?

Kei:
Huh?

Miyako:
If you don't recognize that, you may end up hating yourself one day.
I think you can still make sixth period if you hurry up.


Chihiro:
Thank you. That was good.
You know, I never would have guessed that you were such a good cook, Renji.

Renji:
To be honest, that's about all I can do.
Uh, is this something special or do you always write down what you eat?

Chihiro:
Yes. My diet needs to be nutritionally balanced.
I think that today's lunch was a perfect ten.

Renji:
A ten?

Chihiro:
Today's breakfast was a four and last night's dinner was about a seven.

Renji:
Is that like a rating?

Chihiro:
There's so many meals, it's hard to manage. So I use a simple point system.
It may sound strange, but it makes it easier for me.

Renji:
Kind of intimidating for the chef. So can you cook, Chihiro?

Chihiro:
Well yeah, technically I can. But I would never wanna eat anything I make.

Renji:
Huh?

Chihiro:
I'm afraid our family and making food aren't very compatible.

Renji:
In other words, you're lousy cooks? Shall we start then?

Chihiro:
Mmhmm. Here you go.
These are all my ideas. Please read it after I go home, okay?

Renji:
What?

Chihiro:
I don't want someone reading what I wrote right in front of me. That would be embarrassing.

Renji:
I see. Okay, I'll hang on to this. So, what's your biggest challenge when it comes to writing?

Chihiro:
What do you mean "challenge"?

Renji:
Umm... I don't know. I thought I could support you by recalling or confirming what you can't.
You know, kind of like an editor.

Chihiro:
I suppose... the real challenge would be that I'll never be able to finish writing something in one day.

Renji:
So it's time constraints.

Chihiro:
As time passes, I start forgetting the details... of the plot, the setting, characters.
They all start changing in my mind. I always start on something, but I get stuck. I have to start all over.
According to my diary, I've made 31 attempts in four years.

Renji:
Thirty-one attempts, huh? So my job would be to help keep the continuity in your story.

Chihiro:
Oh, I guess if you don't mind, I'd like that.

Renji:
Okay. Anything else that you think I should know?

Chihiro:
Umm...

Renji:
Hmm?

Chihiro:
Never mind.

Renji:
What? If you want this to work, you need to tell me everything that comes to mind.

Chihiro:
Okay. Well, we had a problem in our math class one time.
If you drive a stick into the ground and tie a sheep to it, what is the area of the circle in which the sheep can graze?

Renji:
The length of the rope squared times the circumference of the circle?

Chihiro:
The sheep not only eats the grass but also the roots.

Renji:
What?

Chihiro:
So the grass doesn't grow back and the grassy plain turns into a desert.
Whenever I hear this problem, I think of the poor sheep slowly starving to death. It makes me sad.
So then, writing this novel... No, forget it--it's nothing.

Renji:
Huh?

Chihiro:
It was just a misunderstanding, I shouldn't have said anything.

Renji:
Yeah, but...

Chihiro:
Please forget about it, Renji.

Renji:
Really? Okay, I won't write about it in my diary then.

Chihiro:
I can't believe it! Do you keep a diary like me?

Renji:
No, not at all.

Chihiro:
Hey!


Miyako:
You're not being totally honest with yourself, are you?

Kei:
I know, but...


Chihiro:
Hey, what are you doing?

Hiro:
A rough sketch. I'm practicing.

Chihiro:
Wow! So, are you drawing something for a manga?

Hiro:
A manga? But then I have to think of a story for the manga.

Chihiro:
You need a story, huh? I can come up with one for you if you'd like me to.

Hiro:
You?

Chihiro:
Mmhmm! I think it's fun to make up stories.

Hiro:
Uh, sure!

Kei:
Big Brother! I bought this month's manga! Let's read it together!

Chihiro:
So the main character...

Kei:
Who do you like better? Do you like Shiori or Shimiko?

Hiro:
Well, let me see...

Chihiro:
This is hard.

Hiro:
Can I read it?

Chihiro:
Go away! You can't read it! It would embarrass me!

Hiro:
Come on!

Chihiro:
No!

Kei:
Let's go to the beach, Oni-chan!

Chihiro:
But I already promised Chihiro that we'd work on the manga together today.

Kei:
Chihiro's busy today! So let's go! Come on!

Chihiro:
Kei...? Oni-chan...?

Kei:
It's all my fault!

Hiro:
Kei...


Kei:
I took... Hiro away from her... so I have no right to confess my feelings to him.

Yuko:
Is that your excuse?

Kei:
Huh?

Yuko:
You're always stuck in the same place.

Kei:
What?

Yuko:
You're always waiting for someone to hold your hand and take you far away from here, aren't you?

Kei:
Uh, hello?

Hiro:
Kei? I need to talk to you.

Kei:
What?

Hiro:
But not on the phone. Can you come over?

Kei:
Mm... okay, but...


Chihiro:
Thank you for having me.

Sumire:
You're welcome anytime.

Chihiro:
Thank you.

Renji:
'Night, Chihiro. See you tomorrow.

Chihiro:
Yeah, see you tomorrow! Umm...

Kuze:
What is it?

Chihiro:
This may sound like a strange question, but have we met before?

Kuze:
Yeah, a few times. Himura and I go back a long time, so I've known you for quite a while, Chihiro.

Chihiro:
Yeah, I thought you might. I'm sorry.

Kuze:
Don't you worry your pretty little head.
Oh hey, I know a pretty good poem. Would you like to hear it?

Chihiro:
A poem?

Kuze:
"How many mountains and rivers must I forever cross to reach the place where my loneliness ends? Again today, I travel."

Chihiro:
Well, what does it mean?

Kuze:
Well, the poet is asking how far does he have to travel in order to find a place where loneliness no longer exists for him.
He knows in his heart of hearts there'll never be such a place. And yet he continues to search for it. Do you understand?

Chihiro:
He talks about loneliness, but it's not a sad poem.

Kuze:
Himura told me this poem. I'm not sure why, but he must have memorized it for someone a long time ago.

Himura:
Welcome back.

Chihiro:
I'm home!

Himura:
Did you have a good time?

Chihiro:
Yes!

Himura:
That's good.


Hiro:
Sorry to call you over so late.

Kei:
Uh, is someone here?

Hiro:
Yeah. Come on in. We need to talk.

Kyosuke:
Hey, good evening.

Kei:
It's you!

Hiro:
You know my classmate? His name's Kyosuke. He's a senior member of the school's film club.

Kyosuke:
I was... in the film club.

Hiro:
He has a favor he'd like to ask you.

Kei:
Of me?

Kyosuke:
Yeah. Actually, uh, I want you to go out with me.

Kei:
What?!


Renji:
She was the only one in the world...

Chihiro:
She was the only one in the world. So she was a god.
For as long as she could remember, she lived on an island.
It was a small island, so small that she could walk around it in half a day.
The view from the shore was 360 degrees of ocean, clouds and horizon.
There was a castle on the island. The warehouse was well stocked with food and daily necessities--she would never starve.
There were also so many books, she could never read them all in one lifetime.
That was her whole world.
All of the books the girl read were about people.
Some of them said that people couldn't live alone. But the girl lived alone. She lived in solitude...
She didn't need to laugh, cry... or do any of the things the books said were necessities in life.
She was complete... and she was perfect.

Renji:
She was the first average human being in the history of mankind.
The statistical average of one person always mirrors that person.
So everything she did was right... but it could also be very wrong.
The sheep...

Chihiro:
The area of the circle is the length of the chain squared times pi.
The length of the chain is twelve years... it hasn't changed since my accident four years ago.
The length of my reach is only thirteen hours... This is my whole world...
