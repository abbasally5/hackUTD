Kei:
I'm gonna make you disappear. Count on it.

Hiro:
Coming.

Kyosuke:
Hiya! It's me. Wait! Just a minute! Are you going to turn away your best friend in the middle of the night, you jerk?!

Hiro:
I don't have a best friend! Go home!

Kyosuke:
What did you say? Open up! It's the FBI! You have the right to remain silent or dead!

Hiro:
Stop! Okay, just give me five minutes! Let me clean up!

Kyosuke:
You mean, give you time to hide all your porn magazines?!

Hiro:
No, just wait outside!


Kyosuke:
You're a manga artist?

Hiro:
Yeah, that's me--a paid professional.

Kyosuke:
Well, that explains it. Serious guy like you, never in class. I knew something was up.

Hiro:
Don't tell anybody.

Kyosuke:
Fine, under one condition.

Hiro:
Condition?

Kei:
I have no right to confess my feelings to him...

Hiro:
Kei? I need to talk to you.

Kei:
What? Do you two think it's really funny?! Teasing a girl like me can get you hurt!

Hiro:
It's all your fault...

Kyosuke:
I usually have better luck when I use a go-between to recruit actresses...

Kei:
What are you talking about? What actresses?
When does it start getting interesting?

Hiro:
It doesn't.

Kei:
How long do I have to watch this?

Kyosuke:
About two hours.

Kei:
Don't show me some boring movie! I don't have all day, you know!

Kyosuke:
What part of it was boring?

Kei:
What part?! The actors suck! The storyline is dull!
It caught my interest at first, but it got boring real quick, you know.

Kyosuke:
What caught your interest at first, if I may ask?

Kei:
Well... the visuals, I guess. The actors were really terrible, but at least they looked good more or less.

Kyosuke:
So you have a discerning eye, then.
The film was written and directed by a senior. But I did cinematography.
The visuals were good, right?

Kei:
Mmhmm.

Hiro:
So then, Kyosuke wants to try shooting a film that's his own creation. And he wants you to be the star.

Kei:
What?

Kyosuke:
Kei-chan, will you be in my movie?


Kyosuke:
Check it out. You'll be the only actor.
We can do it in your spare time, work around your schedule.
I'll just follow you with my camera.

Kei:
But I've never acted before. I wouldn't know what to do.

Kyosuke:
That's not a problem. There's no script. I just wanna capture your life and feelings.

Kei:
My feelings?

Hiro:
Like a documentary?

Kyosuke:
It's neither a documentary nor a drama. I just want to see what I can do. What art can I make from the footage?

Hiro:
Hmm...

Kyosuke:
What?

Hiro:
Can you create something without a vision?

Kyosuke:
I don't wanna be tied down to a vision.

Hiro:
Great work never happens by accident. That's just idealistic.

Kyosuke:
Great work is meaningless if it's not what I wanted to create in the first place, right?!

Hiro:
Take some advice from someone who's a professional artist!
Creating anything is never as easy as you think it'll be!

Kyosuke:
Do you think creating with artistic freedom is easy?!
It's a lot harder than working within constraints like you!

Hiro:
Professionals are always having to battle with constraints!
Unlike you, we struggle for creative freedom all the time!

Kyosuke:
We're fighting different battles then, aren't we?!
I don't wanna be constrained by an audience or some random panel of judges!
Do you write only for your readers or do you write for yourself?!

Hiro:
I'm constantly creating things I wanna create as well!
But that doesn't mean I can totally ignore my readers, does it?!
Do you create with absolutely no regard for your audience?

Kyosuke:
I don't care if it's one scene or if it's one frame, I want to create something that will shake the audience to its core!
But to make that happen, I have to be shaken to my core as well. Do you understand?!

Hiro:
If that's how you feel, then go for it.

Kyosuke:
Don't worry, I will!

Kei:
Wait! It's not your decision to make! I haven't consented to even being in your silly film yet!

Hiro and Kyosuke:
Huh?

Kyosuke:
You don't have to decide right away.

Kei:
There's no point in putting it off! I'm not interested.

Kyosuke:
Okay, I'll be waiting for your answer.

Kei:
Are you listening to one word I'm saying?!
I wonder what he wants with me anyways.

Hiro:
If you decide to do it, just be really careful. I mean, everybody knows he's a player. So watch out for him.

Kei:
So you're that worried about me?

Hiro:
No, dummy.

Kei:
Oni-chan.

Hiro:
Hm?

Kei:
I was wondering, does Miyamura-senpai come over to your house a lot?

Hiro:
Just two or three times. Not often.

Kei:
I see. Big Brother, am I a nuisance to you?

Hiro:
Huh?

Kei:
Like coming to wake you up or telling you to go to class, or calling you all the time...
Do you think I'm overbearing?

Hiro:
What is this? You're not at all! I don't know what you're talking about.

Kei:
You never take me seriously anymore, it never used to be like this. So...

Hiro:
It was different before. We're not kids anymore.

Kei:
I know we're not. But you've grown up... way too fast...
It's Chihiro. It's about Renji-kun again.

Hiro:
So Chihiro found a new friend?

Kei:
Yeah, she's been so happy lately.

Hiro:
A boyfriend?

Kei:
She won't say but I think the prospects are kinda good. She seems really happy.

Hiro:
I see. That's good!

Kei:
Huh? Hey, Oni-chan, I have a basketball game this Sunday. Will you come watch me play?

Hiro:
A game?

Kei:
We're going to win.
And when we do, I have something super important to tell you, so I want you to be there.
It's important to me, so please come.

Hiro:
Something important? What?

Kei:
It's my secret. I'll tell you Sunday at the game.

Hiro:
Hey!

Kei:
We're going to win for sure!


Himura:
Did you read Chihiro's story?

Renji:
Yes, it's so intense. I don't see how Chihiro can write something so...

Himura:
What you have to understand is that writing is a means of survival for Chihiro.

Renji:
A survival?

Himura:
She's conveying an image to a third party. Her past self and future self are two different people.
Her diary is a means to connect to the future before she disappears.
How accurately can she portray herself to another entity? Just like a novelist.
Chihiro's ability to write originates from the same creative place.

Renji:
But I don't understand how she could develop an ability like that without a memory.

Himura:
Maybe she's naturally gifted.
Maybe her body retains something even if her mind doesn't.
Maybe it's because she believes that her life depends on telling her story.
She's come this far. Let's pray that she finishes what she set out to do.

Renji:
Who are you, Himura-san?

Himura:
Who am I?

Renji:
What do you do for a living? Why are you always at this church?

Himura:
I was waiting for someone.

Renji:
You were waiting?

Himura:
I'm neither a priest or a counselor. But I will give you one piece of advice.
Don't get involved with Chihiro.


Chihiro:
The girl began to draw. Between books, instruments and art, drawing seemed the best way for her to create people.
But it wasn't that easy. She grew bored and gave up countless times.
But that was fine, because with each passing season, she would grow bored of being bored.
So finally, the girl learned how to draw. She found that she was good at realistic drawings like landscapes.
That was probably because all she had to do was reproduce what was there.
And it was so much harder to draw something she'd never seen before like people.

Renji:
Do you wanna take a break?

Chihiro:
Yes.

Renji:
Are you having a hard time with something?

Chihiro:
Yeah. The castle where the girl lives... I just can't picture the warehouse.

Renji:
The warehouse, huh?

Chihiro:
Where her food is stored, and her clothes and daily necessities.
And the warehouse for her books, her resource for knowledge.
And the scenery on the island, the shapes of the wild plants and flowers, all of those things.

Renji:
So you need to look at something for reference, huh? If only there was a library...

Chihiro:
Yeah...

Renji:
Unfortunately, the only one in Otowa is the school library. Do you wanna go?

Chihiro:
To where?

Renji:
To school, of course!


Miyako:
So what is it? What did you wanna talk about this time?

Kei:
I'm sorry that I bothered you the other day with my little problems.

Miyako:
What little problems? I guess I missed that.

Kei:
Hirono-senpai and I are childhood friends. I hope you're aware of that.

Miyako:
Oh, I know.

Kei:
He didn't have any friends at all when he was little.
I just couldn't stand to see him... all alone.
So I brought him home and then... he had friends.

Miyako:
You actually brought a strange boy into your home?
Wow, you're bolder than I thought, Kei-chan!

Kei:
Do you always try to deflect the conversation like this, Miyamura-senpai?

Miyako:
I'm not very good at serious talk.

Kei:
I had a lot of girl's manga in my room.
That was the first time Hirono-senpai read anything for fun. He became obsessed with it.
But... I never thought he'd become a manga artist. His talent is extraordinary, I realized.
You can't sit back and admire someone who's trying to achieve something.
Not if you want to win the respect of someone like that.
At least I know for sure, he'd never fall in love with a girl who did that.
I realized that a long time ago.

Miyako:
Is that why you started playing basketball?

Kei:
You told me that I wasn't being totally honest with myself.
How's this? I'm in love with...
Ever since we were little! I always have been and I always will!
My feelings have never changed for him, not for a moment!
I've known him my whole life! He's always been the one for me and he always will be...

Miyako:
Why are you confessing your love to me?

Kei:
Go on and play dumb. I won't let you have him.
I'll make you disappear from his heart.
He'll never even remember you are here!

Miyako:
Make me... disappear from... his heart?

Kei:
And that... will be the beginning of Hiro and my story.
And the end of your story. That's the end.
I'll make sure it ends. You can count on it!

Miyako:
Disappear... again...?


Renji:
Hey Mom, do you know if anyone has a spare uniform? Like someone who graduated or something?

Sumire:
Why? Do you have a hole in yours?

Renji:
Oh no. I don't mean for me. You know some moms from your cooking class, right?
Could you ask one of them if maybe they have a spare girl's uniform? It's for a friend of mine.

Sumire:
Oh, for Chihiro-chan! I'm sure someone will have one. We all recycle!

Renji:
Really?

Sumire:
Actually, I think Kuze-san may have an old uniform or two.

Renji:
But I'm talking about a girl's uniform, Mom.

Sumire:
Yes, I know. They're for girls.

Renji:
Why on earth would Kuze-san...?

Kuze:
Sure thing! I have one. Now let's see... where did I put it?

Renji:
So, uh, you don't have to answer if you don't want to, but...

Kuze:
Mmhmm.

Renji:
Why do you have a girl's uniform?

Kuze:
Oh, so the boy is curious. It was a little souvenir.
Now I use it to spice things up a little bit. Usually, I only let them wear the top.

Renji:
That was a roundabout answer, but I got the message loud and clear. Never mind!

Chihiro:
What are you talking about?

Kuze:
Ah... Oh it's for cute little Chihiro!

Renji:
Please don't fantasize!

Chihiro:
I still don't understand what you're talking about.

Kuze:
Will this one fit? Wanna try it on?

Renji:
Are you telling me you have different sizes?

Kuze:
Just a couple.

Renji:
That's really perverted.
Oh well, by the way, how does my mom know that you have all these uniforms?
Not that I really wanna hear the answer.

Kuze:
Hmm... Well, I think she's very attractive. By the way, the uniforms look really good on her.

Renji:
That's not funny! She's a married woman!

Chihiro:
Excuse me... umm...

Kuze:
Hm? Wrong size?

Chihiro:
I think the size is fine but... but I think it's the wrong type of uniform, sir...

Renji:
Kuze-san, I'm sure you were aware of this, but you're...

Kuze:
That's by far my favorite uniform of all.

Renji:
Really perverted...

Chihiro:
Um... I'm all changed! This is an Otowa Academy uniform, right?

Renji:
Yup.

Chihiro:
The same as my sister Kei's?

Kuze:
That's right.

Chihiro:
How do I look?

Renji:
You look amazing, Chihiro. You fit right in.

Chihiro:
Thank you!

Renji:
I can't wait to see you wearing it at school tomorrow.

Chihiro:
Oh...

Renji:
What?

Chihiro:
Do you... think that maybe... we can go now?

Renji:
Mmhmm!

Kei:
Chihiro...


Miyako:
Hope you're hungry, 'cause I went all out today!
It's Miyako's special eel lunch plate just for you, Hirono-kun!

Hiro:
Special eel?

Miyako:
Yes, this eel is a very special eel indeed! It's...
No! Special plate lunch with eel, stupid! Special eel plate lunch!
Hey, Hirono-kun, are you working this weekend?

Hiro:
Huh?

Miyako:
The two of us should go somewhere this Sunday.

Hiro:
I catch up on my sleep on Sundays. I have another deadline coming up. I don't have time to play around.

Miyako:
You're a liar... I know... you're going to a basketball game this weekend.

Hiro:
I'm not lying! I totally forgot, that's all.

Miyako:
I guess that means you're going then.

Hiro:
I didn't exactly promise Kei that I would go.

Miyako:
Oh, you didn't?

Hiro:
Yeah.

Miyako:
Well then, you should go out with me instead! Go on a date with me this Sunday.

Hiro:
I just told you I need to get my rest!

Miyako:
No...?

Hiro:
Well...

Miyako:
Come on. Let's go!


Kyosuke:
Kei-chan! You shouldn't take it so hard, Kei-chan. There'll still be other games, right?

Kei:
It's not that...

Kyosuke:
What the...?

Kei:
That's not what's bothering me.
Didn't I tell you I'd punch you with my right hand if you filmed me without my permission?

Kyosuke:
Yeah, punch me all you want.

Kei:
Huh?

Kyosuke:
Some moments are lost forever if you don't capture them. Once it's gone, you can never get it back.

Kei:
Never get it back...?

Kyosuke:
I wanna capture all those moments. I'll do whatever it takes.

Kei:
But if you fail at it, that's all there is to it, am I right?

Kyosuke:
It's not the end... as long as I don't ever give up. I'll keep on trying no matter what.

Hiro:
How's Kei doing?!

Kei:
Oni-chan... Why, uh...?

Kyosuke:
Oh, well... I called him.

Hiro:
Are you okay?

Kyosuke:
She passed out from dehydration and anemia. And I think she hurt her knee when she fell.

Kei:
You really came!

Hiro:
You dummy, of course I came.

Kei:
I told you I'm okay! Put me down! I can walk! You're gonna hurt yourself!

Hiro:
Just shut up! Stay still. You really are a total idiot.

Kei:
Is that all you can say?!

Hiro:
Okay, tell me; Who in their right mind plays a game until they pass out?

Kei:
I just tripped, that's all!

Hiro:
Just shut up. Stop exerting yourself.

Kei:
I'm not exerting myself.

Hiro:
You always push yourself too hard, and you know it!

Kei:
I could say the same thing about you.

Hiro:
Whatever, I'm just fine.

Kei:
What do you mean, Oni-chan? You're all dressed up today.

Hiro:
Huh?

Kei:
Were you going to have a date with Miyamura-senpai?

Hiro:
Oh, I guess I stood her up.

Kei:
Is that...

Hiro:
Stupid? I can't leave you when you're hurt, can I?
I owe her an apology. Shoot, I must've dropped my cell phone.
What do you want now?

Kei:
Nothing at all.

Hiro:
Oh yeah. Didn't you wanna tell me something important after your game?

Kei:
Never mind. It's nothing.


Chihiro:
I'm going to school!

Renji:
Yup!

Chihiro:
I'm kinda nervous...

Renji:
You'll be fine! Just walk normally. No one will notice.

Chihiro:
How do I walk normally?
You smell that? It smells like books!
Thank you so much.

Renji:
Huh?

Hiro:
Thank you so much, Renji-kun!


I wanted you to hear me, not my words.
On the next episode of ef: a tale of memories - I...
Is there a memory that you never want to forget?
