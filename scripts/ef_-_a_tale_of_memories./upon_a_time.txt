Chihiro:
Will you be... I was wondering if you'd like to be my friend.

Renji:
Be your friend?

Chihiro:
Is that too much to ask?

Renji:
See you again.

Chihiro:
Goodbye!

Himura:
Welcome back, Chihiro. Did you have a good time?

Chihiro:
Yes. I had a wonderful time today.

Himura:
Well, don't strain yourself. And...

Chihiro:
And don't get too close to anyone, or let anyone get too close to me.
Himura-san, would it be okay to tell someone about my condition?

Himura:
It's your decision. It's not my place to stop you.
But truthfully, my personal view is... you shouldn't do it.

Chihiro:
I guess you're right. I don't even have the ability to regret any mistakes that I might make.

Kei:
Now then, good morning, Onii-chan. Rise and shine!
Get up, Big Brother!
Get up or you'll be late!
Okay, I've done all that I can. The rest is up to you, Big Brother.
I said get up!

Hiro:
Ow... Your methods are getting more and more violent.

Kei:
Well, you're getting harder and harder to wake up every day.
I told you that sleeping at your desk is bad for your back and your health!

Hiro:
I can't help it... I'm up against a deadline. I'm desperate!

Kei:
You say that every month, okay?!
Work is fine, but just remember your first priority is being a student!

Hiro:
Manga is a priority, too...

Kei:
Stop complaining and go wash your face, okay? Unless you want everyone to know about your job.

Hiro:
Huh?


Kei:
Your attendance record is horrible. You're barely even passing!
You're not academic. Your grades suck! Your personality sucks even more!
And if you keep missing classes, you're just asking to repeat a grade!
Do you wanna be in school forever?!

Hiro:
Maybe I'll have some classes with you next year, Kei. That'd be fun.

Kei:
I'm telling you to go to class so that doesn't happen!
I'm not saying you have to drop your manga!
I just want you to take school a little more seriously.

Hiro:
I guess I'll think about it.

Kei:
Yeah. You go ahead and do that.

Hiro:
Have you been reading my manga lately?

Kei:
Of course I have, you dummy.

Hiro:
You don't give me your opinion anymore.

Kei:
Well, I'm embarrassed to give you my opinion now that you're a professional.
Anyway, you get letters from your fans, don't you, Shindo Nagi-sensei?

Hiro:
I told you before, don't call me that in public!

Kei:
Okay, Big Brother.

Hiro:
Don't call me Big Brother, either!

Kei:
Don't fall asleep in class! Listen to what the teacher is saying. If he calls on you, answer loud and clear!

Hiro:
Who are you, my mom?

Kei:
See you, Hirono-senpai!

Hiro:
Yeah.

Kyosuke:
You're early for a change, Hirono.

Hiro:
Kyosuke?

Kyosuke:
And with a girlfriend, no less. Finally becoming a man, huh?

Hiro:
She ain't my girlfriend. And mind your own business.

Kyosuke:
Listen. It's critical to get to know girls, even if they're not your type.
She may have a friend that is your type, who may have a friend that's even more your type.
You never know what's going to happen when it comes to girls.

Hiro:
So I'm gonna guess that's why you're so indiscriminate when it comes to the ladies.

Kyosuke:
No, it's not that. I'm just not that picky.

Hiro:
That's not very persuasive, coming from a guy like you.

Kyosuke:
Whatever, man. Are you going to class?

Hiro:
I may as well, since I'm already dressed and in the building. Come on, let's go.

Kyosuke:
"You may as well," huh?

Hiro:
I... I always... felt as if something was missing.
It was as if my world was missing a color.
But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't figure out which color.
I searched for an answer, but I could never find one.
Desperation was eating away at my soul.

Yuko:
You always seem so driven.

Hiro:
I can only see what's in front of me because I'm a fool.

Yuko:
No, you're strong.

Hiro:
Not really. I honestly believe that if your dreams actually do come true, then you have more responsibilities.

Yuko:
Responsibilities? To whom?

Hiro:
To yourself. To the dreamer you used to be.
Was I... sleeping?

Miyako:
Are you awake, Hirono-kun?

Hiro:
You're here?

Miyako:
Morning! It's Miyako Miyamura.

Hiro:
You... You're an Otowa student?

Miyako:
I look pretty fetching in this uniform, huh?
You were totally crashed out. You'll catch a nasty cold sleeping out here, you know.

Hiro:
What are you doing here?

Miyako:
What do you mean? I came to see you, of course, Hirono-kun. Couldn't you guess?

Kyosuke:
If it wasn't for the stupid truck, it would have been a great shot.

Club member:
Hey, Kyosuke!

Kyosuke:
Huh?

Club member:
Your shots are good, but they're a little hard to join together.

Kyosuke:
Huh?

Club member:
They're just too bold, they don't really go with the flow.

Kyosuke:
I put my heart and soul into every single shot, you know. You should try it with your editing sometime.

Club members:
That sort of thing isn't appreciated.

If you wanna win at the film festival, you better start taking pictures that appeal to the general public.

Emi:
Listen up! We have a lot of fans who love the kind of work he does. He's really good!

Club member:
Club leader?

Emi:
That's our selling point. So we should try to highlight his work instead of griping about it.

Club member:
Well, I guess, if you say so, but...

Emi:
Kyosuke?

Kyosuke:
Time for a bathroom break.
Those guys just don't get it at all. Maybe it's time to call it quits.
That girl is Hirono's...

Chihiro:
Renji-kun is coming soon. I'm going to tell him the truth today.

Kei:
Chihiro...
Can I stop by for a little while after my basketball practice? Wait, he has a deadline.

Miyako:
I was shocked! Who knew that we went to the same school?

Hiro:
Well, I hardly go to class, that's why.

Miyako:
Oh, me neither. I'm a class-cutting genius of the highest order, second to none!

Hiro:
No wonder we never see each other then.

Miyako:
You know, I didn't know whether or not to talk to you when I saw you at school, Hirono-kun.

Hiro:
Why's that?

Miyako:
I wasn't emotionally ready. I am a girl after all.

Hiro:
I don't get it.

Miyako:
I'm talking about a reunion with the guy I spent Christmas with. I wanted it to be romantic!

Hiro:
We just went from karaoke rooms to coffee shops all night long.
And I had to pay for everything and lost my bike.

Miyako:
Oh by the way, Hirono-kun. I'm sorry, but I had a peek. Tee-hee. At your notebook.
By any chance, could your dream be to draw manga, Hirono-kun?

Hiro:
My dream?

Miyako:
Don't be embarrassed! It's nothing to be ashamed of. It's good to have a dream. Mmm, sure is.

Hiro:
I don't know about a dream, but I'm already a manga artist.

Miyako:
In reality? Or fantasy?

Hiro:
Reality! I'm a professional manga artist with my own series!

Miyako:
For real?

Hiro:
For real.

Miyako:
What kind of manga?

Hiro:
Generally speaking, girls' manga.

Miyako:
What?! Wait, now that you mention it, you do kinda look like a girl. Huh!

Hiro:
That's your reaction?!

Miyako:
Wow, that's pretty cool. So you're actually gainfully employed already.

Hiro:
I guess.

Miyako:
Financially independent now.

Hiro:
I guess.

Miyako:
You're living on royalties!

Hiro:
Well, not just yet.

Miyako:
Wow! A great manga artist!

Hiro:
Quiet! Stop trying to flatter me!
You should spend that energy on finding your own path instead of worrying about mine!

Miyako:
Wow, that's deep.

Hiro:
Oh, well then you should try reading my manga. It's full of way deeper lines than that one.

Miyako:
For real?

Hiro:
For real.

Chihiro:
From the me of yesterday... to the me of today.

Renji:
I guess Chihiro's not here yet.

Chihiro:
Hi.

Renji:
Oh, hey, you made it. You're running a little late today.

Chihiro:
Well, I was reading after lunch and I... I lost track of time.

Renji:
What were you reading?

Chihiro:
Oh, well I... Just a book.

Renji:
Hm?

Chihiro:
A very boring book.

Renji:
So boring you lost track of time?

Chihiro:
Um, no. I didn't lose track of time.

Renji:
What's the matter? You can't even tell a friend?

Chihiro:
Well, uh... You are... You are my friend, but I...

Renji:
But what?

Chihiro:
You're so mean. Okay, then. I'll tell you, but only because you're my friend.
You have to promise to keep it a secret, no matter what.

Renji:
All right. No matter what.

Chihiro:
Um, I... I kinda lied. I wasn't really reading a book.

Renji:
You weren't reading a book?

Chihiro:
Uh-uh.

Renji:
Were you writing a book?

Chihiro:
Why are you... so mean to me?

Renji:
Can I see it?

Chihiro:
No! Never!

Renji:
Oh, but anyway, that's amazing. You're a real novelist, huh?

Chihiro:
You're being sarcastic.

Renji:
No! I was just... I was just being...

Chihiro:
Just being sarcastic!

Renji:
No! Actually, I was thinking about writing one, too.

Chihiro:
You, too? A novel?

Renji:
Just thinking. We took a career path questionnaire at school. A novelist wouldn't be so bad.

Chihiro:
I see. I think that would be wonderful.

Renji:
Really?

Chihiro:
Yes! I'd be curious to read a story that you wrote.

Renji:
I'd be curious about what you wrote.

Chihiro:
Don't be curious about me.

Renji:
Oh, okay.

Chihiro:
Don't mention it ever again, you hear? Not in your grave or even in Hell, you understand?

Renji:
Mmm. She's already decided I'm going to Hell, huh?
But a good career path sure is hard to find.

Chihiro:
Oh, is it?

Renji:
Isn't it?

Chihiro:
Well, I think that it's best to do whatever you love.

Renji:
I guess so. Someone just told me the same thing.

Chihiro:
Who told you that?

Renji:
It was an adult. What do you wanna be, Chihiro?

Chihiro:
I... I have a dream.

Renji:
A dream?

Chihiro:
I don't wanna be a novelist. I just wanna write a story, even just one. I wanna create something that's mine.

Renji:
I see. I think you can do it.

Chihiro:
Do you really...?

Renji:
Yeah. But I guess my word isn't worth very much.

Chihiro:
Yes, it is. Thank you. It's so encouraging to hear you say that.

Renji:
School tomorrow... I wish I didn't have to go.

Chihiro:
Why don't you wanna go?

Renji:
It's not that I don't like school.

Chihiro:
School... huh?

Renji:
Oh, sorry.

Chihiro:
No, it's fine. Actually, I love to hear about it. More so because I've never been able to go.

Renji:
Really?

Chihiro:
I have a twin sister who tells me all about school every day.
Just listening to her talk about her experiences there always makes me happy, too.

Renji:
You have a twin?

Chihiro:
Yes. But we're total opposites.
She's bubbly and outgoing and not at all shy like I am.
She's a freshman at Otowa. Her name is Kei Shindo.

Renji:
I see. But I wouldn't know her if she's in middle school.

Chihiro:
No, she's in high school.

Renji:
What? But she's your twin, right?

Chihiro:
Yes.

Renji:
Wait, so you're...

Chihiro:
If I were in school, I'd be a freshman in high school, too.

Renji:
Oh, I see.
Aww man! I thought she was way younger than me.
Should I call you Shindo-san from now on instead?

Chihiro:
But what's wrong with Chihiro? That's what everyone else calls me.

Renji:
Okay. Uh, then will you call me Renji?

Chihiro:
Not Aso-san?

Renji:
That's too formal.

Chihiro:
Then I can call you Renji-san?

Renji:
"San" is too formal, too! It's embarrassing. How about "kun"?

Chihiro:
That's embarrassing for me!

Renji:
But we are friends.

Chihiro:
Well, if that's what you want, then I'll call you Renji-kun from now on.
Renji-kun... Renji-kun. Renji-kun. Renji-kun.
It sounds weird to me.

Renji:
Yeah, I guess.

Chihiro:
My house is this way.

Renji:
Oh, all right then, see ya.

Chihiro:
Okay. Goodbye. Renji-kun!

Renji:
What is it?

Chihiro:
I, uh... Well I...

Renji:
Chihiro...?

Chihiro:
No. It's nothing. I'll see you later.

Renji:
Oh, hey!

Chihiro:
Yes?

Renji:
Tomorrow.

Chihiro:
Tomorrow?

Renji:
Let's meet again! I'll see you at the train station after school.

Chihiro:
Tomorrow? Are you sure about that?

Renji:
Yeah, of course!

Chihiro:
Okay. Tomorrow at the station then.


Himura:
So, it was you. That she's been seeing.

Renji:
Himura-san?

Himura:
If you wanna be with Chihiro, you'd better brace yourself.

Chihiro:
Aso-san... I mean Renji-kun said "let's meet again tomorrow", not "see you again".
It's a real date this time. See you tomorrow...
Kei... I can't imagine what tomorrow is like, or being happy... Will I even still be here tomorrow?

Himura:
If you wanna be with Chihiro, you'd better brace yourself.

Renji:
Why would he tell me to brace myself? That's not a normal thing to say.


Renji:
Hey there!

Chihiro:
Are you... Renji-kun?

Renji:
That would be me.

Chihiro:
H-Hello.

Renji:
Hello. What should we do today? Wanna go to a cafe?

Chihiro:
If it's not too crowded.

Renji:
What?

Chihiro:
It's just I feel uncomfortable outside where there's a lot of people.
It's beautiful...

Renji:
Yeah... It almost looks like it's on fire.

Chihiro:
Renji... Aso-san.

Renji:
Hmm?

Chihiro:
Would you consider me to be your friend?

Renji:
You're being so serious. I guess I haven't really thought about it.

Chihiro:
Then... What am I to you, Aso-san?

Renji:
At first, I just wanted to find out more about you, but then I started feeling protective.
It's not that I was worried about you, I just wanted to see you all the time.

Chihiro:
Am I like your younger sister, then?

Renji:
Maybe a little.

Chihiro:
I also thought if I had an older brother, he would be like you.

Renji:
Really?

Chihiro:
Yes. And, well I... I...

Renji:
Chihiro...

Chihiro:
Yes...?

Renji:
Take a deep breath.

Chihiro:
What?

Renji:
Hold that breath in for a second, then let it out and relax! And you won't be so nervous.

Chihiro:
Oh... Okay. I'm sorry. I was testing you.

Renji:
What?

Chihiro:
Whether or not I should tell you. I don't read emotions very well.
But I realize now that you haven't changed. You're always you...

Renji:
Wait. You are Chihiro, right?

Chihiro:
What?

Renji:
Because you said you had a twin. You haven't switched places with your sister, have you?

Chihiro:
I guess I can't blame you for thinking I'm a different person, but I'm not.
Aso-san... I... I have a memory defect.

Renji:
A memory defect?

Chihiro:
Yes... I can only retain 13 hours of memory at a time.

Renji:
What?

Chihiro:
In that sense, the me from yesterday is different from the me today.
And after today, I can't be the same me tomorrow.
This is never going to change. I'm going to be like this... forever.


My feelings aren't in sync with his.
