  Saori:
Can we even work with this beat-up thing?

Miho:
Probably...

Saori:
I think newer tanks are better, just like finding a new guy.

Hana:
I don't think that's right.

Saori:
How am I wrong? Anyway... We only have one tank here, right?

Yuzu:
With the number of people we have...

Momo:
We'd need five total.

Anzu:
How about we all go looking for tanks?

All:
What!?

Looking for tank? How are we supposed to do that?

Yuzu:
Well, our school got rid of tankery several years ago, but the tanks that were used should still be around here somewhere.
No, I'm sure they're here. Our tankery instructor should be here the day after tomorrow.
We'll find the remaining four tanks before then.

Caesar:
Where do you think we might find them?

Anzu:
We're looking for them because we don't know where they are.

Azusa:
You don't have any idea at all?

Anzu:
Nope!

Momo:
Very well, start the search.

Saori:
This is a lot differenent from what we were told. Isn't doing Tankery supposed to make you popular?

Anzu:
A pretty cool instructor's coming tomorrow.

Saori:
Oh, my gosh, really?

Anzu:
Yeah, really. I'll introduce you.

Saori:
I'll get going.


Saori:
Or so I said…Where are they!?

Hana:
I don’t think there are any tanks in the parking lot.

Saori:
But they are sort of cars, aren’t they? Lets go to the forest on the other side. They say if you wanna hide something,[?] in a bunch of trees.

Hana:
[?] forest?

Miho:
Um…excuse me, would you like to come with us to look for tanks?

Yukari:
Are you sure? Well,I…that is…I’m in standard class too, second year class 3. Yukari Akiyama. Um, I’m not that experienced, but It’ll be nice to work with you.

Hana:
It's very nice to meet you as well. My name is Hana Isuzu.

Saori:
Saori Takebe!

Miho:
Oh, and I am…

Yukari:
Oh, I already know. Ms. Miho Nishizumi, right?

Miho:
Ugh…yeah…


Yukari:
Very nice to meet you all


Azusa:
Did you find the records and the tanks yet?

Aya:
There’s no mention of tanks.

Karina:
There is nothing from when our school stop doing tankery.

Yuki:
I wonder why they stop doing tankery all of sudden.

Ayumi:
It probably loses popularity, I mean It’s kinda old fashioned

Yuki:
Make sence.


Saori:
What’s the matter?

Hana:
I smell something coming from over there.

Yukari:
You can really smell something?

Hana:
There is a cent of iron and oil mixed in with a smell of flowers.


Saori:
Your nose gets that good when you do flower arrangement?

Hana:
It might just be me.

Yukari:
In that case, Panzer Vor!

Saori:
Panties did what now!?

Miho:
Panzer Vor. It means for all the tanks to move out.
