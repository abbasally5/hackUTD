  Hana:
There's four Matilda II's, and a single Churchill, all advancing.

Saori:
They've got quite the tight formation there.

Hana:
No kidding.
I'm impressed they're able to move as a group without falling out of line at that speed.

Saori:
We won't be able to breach their frontal armor with the armor piercing rounds we're carrying.

Hana:
That's where tactics and skills come in.

Saori:
Right.

Miho:
Hey, Mako. Wake up.
I wanna deploy, but make sure the sound of the engine doesn't echo, all right?

Mako:
Mmhmm.

Miho:
The enemy tanks are continuing to advance.
You know the plan, everybody, we're going to be the bait, so xxx stand by at the pass.
Got it?
It's time to enact a Sneaky Sneaks Plan.

Everyone:
Okay!

Mako:
Um, now. What are we doing?

Miho:
Well, we're supposed to lure in all the enemies that try to attack us.
But, I'm not sure if it'll work.

Saori:
If we lose, we'll have to do that terrible dance.

Hana:
Uh, this is the first match, so we'll have do the best we can.
There's no time for regrets.
So, let's give it our best.

Saori:
You're right. We just have to go at it.

Miho:
Mm.

Yukari:
I don't even care if we gain or lose, I'm just happy to have finally seen English tank operating from up close.

Saori:
Yeah, you look happy.

Hana:
Sorry about that.

Miho:
It's fine. It's not like we're trying to take them out.
Try to zig-zag as much as you can.
Our armor's weak, so we're out if we get hit head on.

Mako:
Roger.



Miho:
Strawberry shortcake is awesome...
I forgot. I'm not at home anymore, huh?

Huh?
There we go.

Oh, nothing beats the smell of fresh bread.
We don't have any of those around my house.
I'll have to check. Aw!
That's kind of cute.

Girls:
What are we having for lunch today.
Yeah, what should we get?
That's a good question.
Geez, we just ate breakfast, not so we're thinking about it.
Oh, whatever.

Girl 1:
So what do you think, sandwiches?

Girl 2:
Let's eat on the roof instead of in the class room.

Saori:
Hey girl, you wanna grab some lunch?

Miho:
Huh?

Hana:
See that, Saori? You startled Nishizumi.
You'll make a bad first impression.

Saori:
Sorry! I was just trying to be funny.

Hana:
Anyway, to repeat the question, if you would like to have lunch with us, we'd both be delighted.

Miho:
With what? With me?

Hana and Saori:
Mmhmm.

Saori:
We managed to pick her up!

Hana:
To be honest, as soon as we saw you, we wanted to try talking to you, Nishizumi.

Miho
Oh, really? But why?

Saori:
You're jittery all the time, so we thought that might be interesting.

Miho:
I-Interesting?

Saori and Hana:
Yeah.

Saori:
So anyway, my name's...

Miho:
Saori Takabe. Born June twenty-second.

Saori:
Huh?

Miho:
Hana Isuzu. Born December sixteenth.

Hana:
That's right.

Saori:
We just met, and you already know both our birthdays.

Miho:
Yeah, I looked at our class list, and learned everything about everyone, so I can friends with people easier.

Saori:
See, I knew you'd be interesting.
By the way, can I call you by your first name?

Miho:
Huh?

Hana:
Miho is fine, right?

Miho:
Oh my gosh. It's like we're friends already.

Lady:
Here we go. Your teriyaki salmon lunch.

Miho:
I'm so glad I was able to make friends.
I moved here to Ooarai all by myself, so I was kind of worried.

Saori:
I see. Well, you never know what might happen, right?
You know, like a complicated love triangle, or someone says they don't like you right before you confess your love, or your boyfriend cheats on you.

Miho:
Uh... yeah...

Hana:
Did something bad happen with your family?
Family in-fighting or something related to an inheritance maybe?

Miho:
No, nothing like that.

Saori:
Then did your parents get transferred to a different office?

Miho:
Uh...

Saori and Hana:
Huh?

Hana:
We should eat before everything gets cold.

Miho:
Uh, mm.



Anzu:
Wouldn't that be manipulating things?

Yuzu:
Don't worry. It's fine.

Momo:
Understood. I will take care of it immediately.



Saori:
Wanna get some tea on the way back?

Miho:
It's like we're real high school girls!

Hana:
Pretty sure we are, actually.

Saori:
By the way, I had a question.

Miho:
Huh?

Saori:
I've been worrying about something.
I'm a terrible woman, you know.

Hana:
Oh, not this conversation again?

Saori:
A lot of guys have been approaching me lately and it started to get kind of awkward.
I'm not looking for any drama.

Miho:
A lot of guys?

Saori:
Yeah, the people who live near me, every morning, they're all like "Hi there!" and "You're as cheery as ever today!"

Hana:
If that's the case, I'm pretty sure they're just saying hi to you.

Saori:
No way. They've totally got the hots for me.

Hana:
If you insist...

Miho:
You're easy to approach, and you've got a great personality.
That's why it's no surprise that everyone wants to be friends with you.

Saori:
Oh...

Miho:
I think it's great that you can get along with other people without even worrying about it.
You know, at lunch today, when you came up and talked to me out of the blue, it made my day!
I never thought I'd make such great friends so soon.

Hana:
I think you're pretty great yourself, Nishizumi.

Miho:
Huh? Oh, no way. I'm totally lame!
But Isuzu, you are cool-headed and confident and mature.
You're so smart.
I mean, I'm really jealous.

Hana.
No I...
I'm glad hear that since people always say I'm too uptight.

Miho:
Really?
Well, that's better than me.
Back at my old school, the kids used to always say that I'm irresponsible.
How can I become more like you?

Hana:
I used to do flower arrangements, so maybe that's why.

Miho:
What? That's so cool!
I've always wanted to try that.
It's all feminine and graceful and stuff.
Thanks for making friends with me on my first day.
It means a lot.

Hana:
No, it was our pleasure.

Girls:
The student coucil president?
Why is she here?

Anzu:
Oh hey, Nishizumi!

Miho:
Yes?

Saori:
It's the student council president, along with the VP and PR agent.

Momo:
We need to talk for a moment.

Miho:
We do?

Anzu:
I don't know what you're planning for your mandatory elective, but sign up for Tankery!
Easy, right?

Miho:
Huh? I, uh... Are you sure?
I thought this school didn't have a Tankery class.

Momo:
We didn't, but we're starting it back up this year.

Miho:
Yeah, but... the only reason I transferred here in the first place was 'cause I thought they didn't have Tankery.

Anzu:
Sounds like fate!

Miho:
I thought we could choose whatever mandatory elective we wanted...

Anzu:
Anyway thanks a bunch!



Teacher:
For the next question, Nishizumi.

Everyone:
Huh?

Saori:
Miho.

Teacher:
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?
Do you need to go to the nurse's office?

Saori:
Ma'am, my stomach doesn't feel so good!

Hana:
I'm experiencing chest pains.

Nurse:
There's a lot of people not feeling well today.
Just take it easy and rest.

Hana:
Miho, are you feeling okay?

Saori:
No, just lie down.

Hana:
If you want to leave school early, I'll go back and pick up your bag.

Miho:
That's nice of you.

Saori:
What did the student council president say to you back there?

Hana:
If you don't mind, could you tell us?

Miho:
She said they'd be... bringing the Tankery course back this year.

Hana:
A Tankery course?
I know it has a long history, but it's not very popular.

Saori:
But wait. I don't get what this has to do with you.

Miho:
She told me to choose Tankery for my mandatory elective.

Saori:
Huh? But why?

Miho:
Because I...

Saori:
Is she trying to bully you for some reason?
Wait, the president, you and someone else are involved in a love triangle!

Miho:
No, no!

Hana:
If she went out of her way to ask you to pick Tankery, you must be some sort of master fighter.
Are you a war hero and were too shy to tell us?
You don't have to be so humble about it.
Tell us about your duels, your rampages and your extortion plots.

Miho:
I'm not a war hero.

Saori:
Then what is it?

Miho:
Well, um...
The truth is, I come from a family that has a long history of riding tanks.

Hana:
Oh.

Saori:
Wow!

Miho:
But I don't like tanks much myself.
That's why I came to this school, to try and avoid Tankery.

Hana:
I see.

Saori:
So that's what happened.
If you don't wanna do it, why force yourself?

Miho:
Huh?

Saori:
High school girls don't really do Tankery now anyway.
I'm surprised they're offering it again at all.

Hana:
It's fine to say no to the student council.
Don't worry about it. We'll go with you.

Miho:
Thanks you guys.

Hana:
Well, it looks like class is over now.
We were just starting to relax, too.

Saori:
Homeroom is the only thing we have left.

Miho:
What's that?

Momo:
Calling all students, convene in the Gym. I repeat, convene in the Gym!



Miho:
So, what's going on?

Saori:
I don't know.

Hana:
This is just how our student council likes to do things.

Miho:
And everyone's gotten used to it?

Momo:
Quiet everyone.
We're starting orientation on our school's mandatory electives for this semester.



Narrator:
Tankery. A part of our culture with a long history, enjoyed by girls for many nations all throughout the world.
A strong but delicate art that aims to make girls and women alike more polite, graceful, modest, and gallant, both on and off the battlefield.
To learn Tankery is to armor the heart of a maiden, the soul that embraces and burns with femininity.
Intense and strong like a tank's iron.
Cute and lively like the clattering of its track.
And finally, passionate and precise like its main weapon.
If you train in Tankery, you will become a better wife, a better mother, a better student, and a better worker.
You will become healthier, kinder, stronger, and men from all over the world will fall at your feet.
This is your chance. Train your body, train your mind, embrace Tankery and blossom as a woman on the fields of battle.

Saori:
Wow...

Hana:
It's so wonderful.

Momo:
You may not know, but a few years ago it was decided there would be a Tankery World Championship held in Japan.
As such, the Ministry of Culture requested that all schools strengthen their Tankery teams in preparation for the upcoming event.

Anzu:
So, we've decided to end our school's current hiatus on Tankery.
If you choose it as your elective, we'll give you a bunch of cool benefits.
Vice President?

Yuzu:
Those who perform well in the course will receive one hundred meal tickets, two hundred free passes if you're late, and finally three times the credit you receive in another class!

Mako:
Huh?

Anzu:
So, that's that. Thanks everyone!



Saori:
That's it! I'm in!

Miho:
What?

Saori:
I read in a magazine that modern guys like girls that are strong and dependable.
And if Tankery's popular, it'll make you popular too.
You should take it too Miho, your family does it, right?

Miho:
I don't... I don't know.

Hana:
I understand. It's difficult, isn't it?
It may not seem like it, but I'm in a similar situation.
My family history is in flower arrangement.

Miho:
Oh, I see.

Hana:
But Tankery does seem rather wonderful, don't you think?

Miho:
Huh?

Hana:
The truth is, I've always wanted to do something that keeps me a little more active than flower arranging.
I'm going to do Tankery too. I've decided!

Miho:
What?!

Hana:
Nishizumi, you should do it with us. Teach us everything you know.

Miho:
Urgh...

Saori:
If you take it, I bet you'll be able to make it to the top of the class, no problem!



Miho:
I'm sorry guys...

Hana and Saori:
Huh?

Miho:
...I can't... can't do it.
The only reason I came here was so I wouldn't have to do Tankery.

Saori:
It's okay!

Hana:
I'm sorry for making you worry about this.

Miho:
Huh?

Saori:
You pick whatever you like and we'll go with you.

Miho:
No way! You two wanted to do Tankery!

Saori:
It's fine! We wanted to be with you more!

Hana:
Besides, if we get in Tankery and talk about it all the time, then even if you're not doing it yourself, you may be reminded of some old memories that you'd rather forget.

Miho:
No, I'll be okay.

Hana:
We just became friends. I don't want to make you feel bad already.

Saori:
I'm the type of girl that gets into whatever her boyfriend is into, so don't worry about me!



Girls:
What did you pick?
I wasn't sure, but I chose Tankery in the end.
Really? I did too.
I wonder what it's like? Hope it's fun!
They say it's perfect training for women.
Well, it's true I've never heard of men doing Tankery.
Guys and tanks seem kind of mismatched to me.
And do you know who said he really can't wait to see how I look in military clothes?
I can't wait till I get a chance to fire the big cannon! Bang!
The school had Tankery before, but I don't know when.

Saori:
Do you wanna get some sweet potato ice cream on the way back home?

Hana:
Ooarai is famous for its sweet potatoes, you know.

Miho:
Oh, I heard. And string sweet potatoes too.

Saori:
Some people called them dried potatoes.
But yeah, the same thing.

Miho:
Oh, I see.

Momo:
Standard Class 1, 2-A, Miho Nishizumi.
Standard Class 1, 2-A, Miho Nishizumi.
Come to the student council room immediately.

Miho:
What should I do?

Saori:
There's nothing to be scared of. We'll go with you.

Hana:
It's going to be all right.



Momo:
Mind telling me what this is about?

Anzu:
Are you too good for Tankery or what?

Momo:
In this school, there's almost no one with any Tankery experience.

Yuzu:
We'll be wiped out. Our school will be wiped out.

Saori:
Would you stop being so selfish?

Hana:
That's right, she said she doesn't want to do it.
And now you're trying to force her?

Saori:
Miho's not going to do Tankery!

Hana:
Please leave Nishizumi alone.

Anzu:
You know, if all of you hate this school so much, I could arrange to have you ejected from it.

Hana:
I can't believe you're threatening us.

Momo:
This is not a threat, the president is always serious.

Yuzu:
That's right.
I think you guys should probably apologize before it's too late.
Please?

Saori:
Stop it!

Hana:
You're abusing your power.

Momo:
As student council leaders, this is well...

Miho:
These two wanted to do Tankery, and not only they did give up that, now they're frightening the student council too.
And they're doing this stuff for me.
If I could just...

All right, that's fine!

Everyone:
Huh?

Miho:
I'll do it, I'll do Tankery.

Saori and Hana:
What?!

Yuzu:
Thank goodness!



Hana:
Are you sure you'll be all right with this?

Miho:
Uh-huh.

Saori:
You don't have to force yourself, you know.

Miho:
I'll be okay.

Hana:
Are you sure?

Miho:
I... I think I made a right choice.
I was happy... that you two were fighting so hard for me.
That was the first time something like that happened to me.
No one ever thought about how I felt.
They never bothered to ask me.
My mom and sister always thought of Tankery as something that our family just did without thinking about it.
Those two have talent, so it was fine for them at least.
But I... I'm not like them.
I'm always...

Saori:
Here, try some sweet potato ice cream with chocolate chips!

Hana:
And try this one too. It has mint.

Miho:
Well, that's good! I like both.

Saori:
Let me have some of yours, Miho.

Hana:
The pudding is good, too.

Saori:
You took too much. You're going to eat it all.



Momo:
Less people showed up than I hoped for.

Anzu:
There's eighteen here. Including us, that's twenty-one total.

Yuzu:
It'll work out somehow.
Don't sweat the details.

Hana:
Everyone here seems pretty excited.

Miho:
Yeah...

Saori:
What'll I do if I get even more popular?!

Momo:
Tankery class will now begin.

Hana:
What were the tanks again?
Tigers or... I forget.

Everyone:
Uh...

Girls:
What the heck?
They're falling apart.
I can't believe this.

Hana:
But it's got personality, wouldn't you say?

Saori:
I think the word you're looking for is "rust."

Miho:
It looks like the armor and treads are just fine, we might be able to work with this.
