  Saru:
The pain... would have only lasted a second. Right?

Yoko:
Who are you?

Saru:
You can't find your way home. No matter how hard you try... you still can't find home.

Yoko:
No wait. How do you know so much about my... my father and mother?

Saru:
I know. Oh. I know everything about you. Hahahaha....
These are the masks of all the people that you have known in the world you lived in. Tlake a look.
The masks of friendly classmates... The mask of a strict teacher... And the masks of model parents too...

Yoko:
Ah!?

Saru:
And we can't forget about your mask.

Yoko:
Please tell me who you are?

Saru:
I just can't believe Asano would date Sugimoto... The truth is he's probably much more attracted to me than he is to her.

Yoko:
What are you saying?

Saru:
I can't take it anymore. Those two do nothing but bother me... They always make me do the fighting. And then they got mouth just about everything.

Yoko:
No way! That's not true! That's not what I think.
Saru:
She pretends of being friends. But I know she doesn't care about me at all. Miss honor student!

Yoko:
Ah...

Saru:
Everything that's happened to us is all Yoko's fault.

Yoko:
Is it true? Do they really feel that way about me?

Saru:
You have no one that you can count on to be your friend. No one would even care if you die.

Yoko:
We're going to find our way home. All of us, Sugimoto, Asano and I will make it back home.

Saru:
Fine. But keep your eye on that woman.

Yoko:
What woman is that?

Saru:
That one girl, Taki. She may not be quite as dependable as you think she is.

Yoko:
What are you saying?

Quiet! That's enough!

Saru:
Her plans are to sell you to live as their servant.

Yoko:
Please tell me who you are!

Saru:
Before you are betrayed, kill her! Hahahaha...
