  Yoko:
It’s you again.
Saru:
Look, Sekishi... Yes...See them as they approach.
 2:15


Mother:
Are you talking about the same dream again?
You should not let those types of things worry you so much.
And also, after school go to the salon and have your hair dyed black.
Your teacher, Mr. Watanabe, was asking about it.
He wanted to know if red was your natural color.
Father:
Hey, where’s that paper?
Mother:
All right!
Just don’t forget, okay?
Father:
Why didn’t you make her dye it during her spring break?
It’s humiliating if people think she’s dying her hair red.
Mother:
I’m sorry, it’s my fault.
Father:
I don’t understand, neither of us has red hair.
Ganguro:
What?
What’s the matter?
Do you have a problem with me or something?


Yoko:
U-Um, n-no…

Ganguro:
Then why are you staring right at me? Apologize!
Yoko:
I’m so sorry…
Asano:
Hey, what’s going on?
Yoko:
Hi, Asano.
Asano:
Ooh, now this is very interesting.
Ganguro:
Yeah, what?
Asano:
I think I’ve discovered a new kind offarm animal.
Ganguro:
Take a hike!
take a hike (邪魔にならないように)立ち去る
Asano:
Oh come on. I'm just joking.
3:50


Asano:
What? Are you mad at me?
Yoko:
You embarrassed me back there.
Asano:
Hey, I was just trying to help you out.

Yoko:
But it was my fault for staring.
Asano:
Huh? Is that what you think?
So you still the good president even when you’re not at school, huh?
Yoko:
I don’t think… I even wanna be the school Student body president anymore.
Asano:
Huh?
What made you change your mind?
Yoko:
Hey! Don’t stand so close.
You're in the boy’s class, remember?
Asano:
Why are you being so cold to me?
We’ve known each other a long time.
Yoko:
I don’t wanna make a scene.
make a scene (声を立てて)騒ぐ
Sugimoto:
Good morning.
Yoko:
Ah, so I, I heard you’ve been going to a prep school since spring break; is that whole story true?
Asano:
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Yoko:
What happened to you?
You used to say you would go to the university that the school counselors recommended.
Asano:
Hey, Sugimoto was saying good morning to you.
Yoko:
Oh, really? I didn’t notice her at all.
Asano:
Now, that's not a very favorable attitude for a class president. Wouldn’t you agree?
Yoko:
I told you, I’m not going to be a class president anymore.
And how do you know Sugimoto? Have you two met before?
Asano:
Morning, guys!
Student1:
Good morning. Hey! What’s up? Hey, did you watch that TV show last night?
Asano:
Oh, yeah. I watched it.



Student1:
Man, they were cute.

 5:09


Teacher:
And with many recommendations, Yoko Nakajima will be the class president for another year.
Yoko:
Then after the assembly, classes will start as usual.
Student1:
Excuse me.
Yoko:
Yes? What would you like?
Student1:
Can I change my seat?

Yoko:
Change your seat?
Student1:
Yes. I’m getting really tired of this one.
Yoko:
But the school-- it’s all arranged by registration number.
Student1:
Well, we're starting a new semester.
It'll give me a fresh start.
Student2:
Why don't you just tell her the truth?
She doesn’t wanna be near Sugimoto.
Student1:
Well, I was just trying to spare her feelings a little.
But nowI guess I'll be more honest about it.
... She’s so morbid I just can’t stand it.
Somebody change seats with me, come on!
Come on, please.
Yoko:
Please, be quiet everyone.
Be quiet!
 6:12


Teacher:
Therefore, the usage of the verb “beat” is very important in this sentence.
To beat has meaning such as to refuse one’s understandings or to trick someone.
The “how” is used here as the noun clause, which includes the subject of "beat".

Yoko:
Huh?
Student3:
I'm glad you class president.
Yoko:
Ah. It's nothing. 
 6:39


Yoko:
Hi, Sugimoto.
Why do you never talk to anybody while you are at school?
Sugimoto:
'Cause all I ever get is ignored.
Yoko:
No, but that's not true at all!
The other students may be a little tough on you, but... Sugimoto, All you ever do is read books and...
Wait! I'm so sorry.
Sugimoto:
A lot of people here at school think that you and I are friends.
Yoko:
But, aren't we friends?
8:00


Saru:
Yes. Look...
The blade's going to reach you soon.
Yoko:
Who's there?

Yoko:
Why was Sugimoto in my dream?
8:33

Yoko:
Huh? He's at a prep school?
Yes, I understand.Thank you very much.
Oh. Welcome home.
Mother:
Yoko, didn't I tell you to go to the salon today?
Yoko:
I know. I'm leaving right now.
8:51


Yoko:
Is that Asano?
9:12


Yoko:
He could've at least told me that he was interested in going out with her.
So... beautiful...
Enki:
The scent of blood, it surrounds your being.
Yoko:
Huh? Scent of blood?
What was that?
