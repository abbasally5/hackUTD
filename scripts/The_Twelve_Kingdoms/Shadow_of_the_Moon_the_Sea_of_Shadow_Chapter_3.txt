  Yoko:
Keiki, I know that you're around us. Please, we need your help right now!

Sugimoto:
Those are probably Keki's servants... And I was just rescued by them. They save me.

Man4
Come on! Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!

Everyone:
Ahhhhhhhhh....

Man5:
Help...

Man3:
Get out of here while they're are all distracted. Run through them all you still can.

Yoko:
Thanks a lot.

Asano:
Come on, come on, hurry! What's taking you long!

Yoko:
Your leg, Sugimoto.... Are you okay?

Sugimoto:
Don't worry about it. It's none of your business. Huh? The sword!

Asano:
Hey you guys, we should probably get out of here.

Sugimoto:
Don't worry. They won't attack me. 

Asano:
Won't attack? What are you saying?

Sugimoto:
What's wrong with this. Things won't move in inch.

Asano:
Hey!

Sugimoto:
Why are you doing this to us? Aren't you all servants under Keiki?

Asano:
Huh! That bastard! He used us as human bait!

Man3:
Ahhhhhhhhhh....

Sugimoto:
What's wrong with you? You came here to protect me, right? Keiki! Keiki, please! I'm right here for you to save! Do something! Answer me!

Yoko:
Keiki, aren't you going to help us?

Asano:
She got the sword loose.

Sugimoto:
Why can she do it?

Woman:
My, my! It's been a while.


Enki:
Shoryu, so it wasn't you.

Shoryu:
I heard there was a Shoku.

Enki:
Your ears hear everything, even though you're hanging around in a place like this.

Shoryu:
Fortunately, I have an excellent Taiho.
55:55



Shoryu:
I want to go to Kei.

Enki:
What? You know what the situation is over there, don't you? After the Yo-Ou fell, the land was ruined and the Youma started appearing.
At least, it's not the Kingdom of Tai...

Shoryu:
It is my understanding that they need a new ruler.

Enki:
Has the Houmei cried?

Shoryu:
Not yet. They say the new ruler is the sister of the Yo-Ou.

Enki:
Ha... But She is a fake.

Shoryu:
If that's the case, that'll be trouble, I'm sure.
I'm sure. きっと～に違いない、～でしょうね
Enki:
Then maybe I should go and check it out then.

Shoryu:
Hey, what have you heard from Taiki?

Enki:
I haven't had any contact.

Yoko:
I can't keep on with this

Asano:
Yoko, let's get out of here while we can.

Sugimoto:
Let's go, Nakajima!

Yoko:
Ah... O.K.

Man:
It is kind of you to come, Your Majesty.　As usual, Thaiho, you are so very gracious.

Kou Ou:
Raise your head. It is a danger that cannot be ingnored by a king.

Man:
Excuse me?

Kou Ou:
It has been five years since the last Kaikyaku, but this is the first time three of them have arrived at the same time. This is an omen that brings [with it???] misfortune. If we let the Kaikyaku roam freely, they will not only bring destruction from Shoku, but they will also bring further ruin to the kingdom of Kou.
