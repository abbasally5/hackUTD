Hey, so what’s the problem baby?

Dante:
Good day.

[Freddie brings Strawberry Sunday]

Dante:
Well that was fast.

Freddie:
I figured you’d coming in same time soon.

Dante:
Kind of hard to believe you’ve been waiting for me too long.

Freddie:
I missed you so much…

Wife:
Freddie, could you come here?

Isaac:
Hey, hang on! Cindy!

Cindy:
Hash! If you keep bothering me I’ll never get any work done!

Isaac:
What’s your problem with me?!

Cindy:
To be honest, I don’t really care if a guy keeps trying to chase after me. Actually, I’m the type of girl who likes to do the chasing.

Isaac:
What are you talking about? So tell me what kind of guy you’re looking for then, baby?

Cindy:
A real he-man. I like a man wild, sexy and intelligent and still kind to women, always relaxed and he is got to be die for cute! A real head turner. Just like Dante!

Isaac:
Dante?!

Cindy:
Him!

Isaac:
Huh?

Cindy:
If you could become just a little more like Dante, I might think about going out with you!

Isaac:
Hey, Cindy! That guy? She thinks he is a real man? Ugh…

City:

Morison:
Looks like business is as slow as always eh?

Dante:

Isaac:
Agh!

Morison:
You watch your back.

Dante:
Like you give a shit…



Mafia:

Dante:

[Mafia turns into Devil]

Isaac:
Holy shit! He really did it! Jesus Crist! Do something with this maniac! Agh! He got to be crazy! He is out of his mind! Ugggh!

[Isaac fall into water]

Isaac:
Stay away from that guy! He is a heartless cold blooded killer! It doesn’t matter even it’s the mafia or whoever! That dude will even kill people for money! It wouldn’t matter if you had nine lives! If you’re with that guy, you will just get used up Cindy! Trust me! He’ll wind up little bit hall!

Customer A:
He said “little bit hall”…

Customer B:
Will she tell some one day?

Isaac:
No wait! You’re misunderstanding me! Cindy!

Cindy:
Just go home!

Isaac:
Oh… don’t be that way…


Isaac:
What gives? The doors aren’t even locked. This is what I should’ve done in the first place! I don’t care what it is! I just need to find something that will land this freak into slimmer!

Devil:
I can make your wish come true.

Isaac:
Ah? It’s my imagination…

Devil:
Now I’ll be able to eat up that child.

Devil:
You’ll just turn that light. Please do.

Devil:
You got to get me out of here!

Devil:
Here! Up ahead where you are!

Devil:
I lived here for practically while, boy. Let me out of here!

Devil:
You mourn! Me… I’ll be the one you need…yes…

Devil:
I’ll be the one who guide you. So get loss!

Devil:
Hey, let me out of here…

Isaac:
Aaaaaagh!

Devil:
Your wish will come true…

[Isaac managed to escape]

Isaac:
What the hell are those things?!

Sid:
They are devils.

Isaac:
Wh… who are you?!

Sid:
I don’t think you’ve got the right to ask since you’re the one who is broke into someone’s house.

Isaac:
I… that’s…

Sid:
Just relax, friend. I won’t tell Dante about this. You want to know… the real truth about Dante, do you not?

Isaac:
Huh?!

Sid:
If that’s the case, I’ve got something for you.

Isaac:
What gives? What is this?

Sid:
Don’t ask. Just take it and go. When you open it, you’ll know what Dante really is.

Lady:
Dante! You’re home aren’t you?! Morison told me about it. Sounds like you made a bunch of money, haven’t you?

[Lady breaks into the room]

Lady:
Huh?


Isaac:
Hey, it’s true Cindy! You got to believe me! I promise! I swear I saw with my own eyes! That dude isn’t normal! He is crazy! There’s something really weird about him!

Cindy:
He is weird? You’ve broke into Dante’s place, and when Dante wasn’t even there!

Isaac:
That… well, that was just because… it because I want you to know that he is dangerous, baby!

Cindy:
Shame on you!

Isaac:
Ahg… why did things turn out like this… Damn it that hurt! What the… Ugh! God damn it! Trying to make me stupid?!

[Devil grooms]

Isaac:
Agh?! My family have been pacifist since my grandfather’s time. But not anymore!

[Isaac goes outside]

Isaac:
Well it’s just a little city… it’s all right. Come on. It’s not like I’m going to eat you or anything. Ugh?! Who is it?! Who is that over there?!

[Devil appears]

 ws:start:WikiTextHeadingRule:2:&lt;h1&gt; 

Isaac:
Aaaaagh! What the hell is that?!

[Isaac hides into gavage box]

Isaac:
Why there is he?! You idiot! Get out of here!

Dante:
Nice time in there, you dickhead!

Isaac:
Agh?!

Dante:
Seems that lately I have nothing to fight but a bunch of weaklings. I’ve been want to go get something that give me a little bit of work out!

[Dante kills Devil]

Dante:
Huh…

Isaac:
Agh… a de… it’s a demon.

Dante:
No barking, no bite…


Isaac:
It’s true! You got to believe me Cindy! Cindy!

Cindy:
Isaac!

Isaac:
Listen! I saw that dude hack a demon in two with his big sword that he carries. Listen! He is a demon! It’s true! That guy is a demon himself! A demon I tell you! That’s the only explanation for all of this!

Cindy:
I cannot believe you! It’s afternoon and I’d swear you’re still sleep and dreaming!

Isaac:
Nonsense! I didn’t dream any of this! Uuuuugh! How can I make you believe me?!

[Dante appears]

Isaac:
Aaaaagh!

Cindy:
Come in, Dante. The usual?

Isaac:
Aaaaagh!

Cindy:
Hey, settle down!

Dante:
So who is that? You’re little boy friend?

Cindy:
Hmm… well, something about him made me actually think about maybe dating him. But he is acting like a stoking psych pass lately. May be, he kind of misunderstood the comment I made the other date. I mean the only thing that I mean t was I wish his a little more like you are Dante. It looks like he took what I was saying totally out of context. And now he said I should stay away from you because you are a demon!

Dante:
Well, he is got something about half right.

Cindy:
Huh? And get a wrote of this, Dante. He swears he saw you kill a demon last night. Isn’t that crazy? I mean it’s so stupid. Just that I wanted to be the one that chase him. Oh, I’m sorry. I’ll be right with you.


Lady:
Yap, that’s right.

Dante:
You can be a little devil, you know that?!

Lady:
Who is the devil? It’ll be a lot better off giving me a money to pay off what you owe me rather than have me take it from you because you lost it pool.

Patty:
Are you saying he got really that far in debt? I mean, in some weird old man has been find near office this lately too.

Lady:
A wired man?

Patty:
Uh-huh. But he seems like a total wispy wimp, so I get rid of him pronto!

Lady:
That reminds me… there was some visitor in your office when I stopped by recently too.

Dante:
A visitor?


Isaac:
Damn it…

[Gigantic demon appears]

Isaac:
Stop! What are you doing man?! What gives?!

Dante:
Alright… bring it on!

[Dante vs. Demon]

Dante:
Just a minute. If you got something. If you gonna skip town, you should at least let her know about it. If you don’t, she can’t chase you here even if she wants to.

Isaac:
What do you mean by that?!

Dante:
Why don’t you ask for yourself?

Isaac:
You mean… you came here just to tell me that?

Dante:
I’m just a demon man, I just hadn’t have my fill of fun yet. Huh!

[Dante destroys the bell]

Isaac:
Dante! What are you?! I mean, who are you?!

Dante:
Who knows… may be you should try asking God or something…


Isaac:

<Preview>
Dante:
I’m not sure when it started. But before I know, I was always listening to her songs. Tougher than any man, Softer than any woman. She sings the sadness in human arts. If I get to meet her, I’ll probably thank her. Because she made me realized that even I have enough emotional depth to understand songs. Keep on playing. Next mission, “Lock Queen”.
