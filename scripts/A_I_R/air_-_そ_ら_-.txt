  Haruko:
 When I think about it... it's like everything that's happened so far has been one gigantic test to see if I could be a real mother to you.
 It's like when you couldn't move your legs and you couldn't even remember who I was anymore.
 As if we were going back to when you were a baby, to the very first day that I saw you.

Misuzu:
 Mommy... Ow!

Haruko:
 Misuzu! Misuzu, talk to me!
 Let me know where it hurts!
 I-I can make it better!
 Misuzu, please!
 Is it here?
 Is this where it hurts you, honey?

Misuzu:
 No!

Haruko:
 Does it your legs? Or your arms?

Misuzu:
 It's my wings...

Haruko:
 Huh?

Misuzu:
 It's my wings... that hurt...

Haruko:
 Yeah... Yeah...

Yukito:
 I just remembered something that my mother told me a long time ago.
 You see, my mother met a girl who had the same sickness before I was born.
 Misuzu will start to forget.
And the morning after she has her last dream, she is going to die.

Haruko:
 It can't be...
 That means if she falls asleep...
 If she has that dream, she won't ever wake up...
 Misuzu, you wanna go to the summer festival, right?
 Hey, you're gonna go to the summer festival with me, remember?

Misuzu:
 Let's go to the festival.
 And I really wanna get a baby dinosaur this time.

Haruko:
 You mean a baby chick, right?
 Well, I'm sure there'll be a stand there.

Misuzu:
 And you'll really let me buy a dinosaur this time?

Haruko:
 Mmhmm, we'll have good things to eat, too.
 We'll go in the morning, and it'll be the most fun you've ever had.
 So you need to hang in there for me, okay, Misuzu?


-- OP --

Haruko:
 Hey Misuzu, remember we're gonna go to the summer festival this morning.

Misuzu:
 Hmm... oh, that's right.

Haruko:
 Uh...

Haruko:
 Please God, cut me some slack.
 Oh Sis, if you're listening, I need your help.

Haruko:
 I'm such an idiot.
 I should've known they wouldn't have it on a day like this.
 There's no such thing as miracles.
 What are the gods good for anyway?
 What the hell'd she do to deserve this, huh?!
 She waited all summer for this, you hear me?!
 All she wanted was to come to this stupid festival!
 Can't you just give her this one thing?!

Haruko:
 It's just like when we were here before.

Misuzu:
 Huh?

Haruko:
 I can't give you what you want this time, either.

Misuzu:
 But, wait!

Misuzu:
 Mommy, don't they have any more baby dinosaurs?

Haruko:
 Huh! What the...?
 Uh, how in the world did that get all the way up here?
 I threw that thing away.
 I guess it's been waiting here for us all this time.
 Misuzu! Misuzu, come on, wake up!

Misuzu:
 What is it, Mommy?

Haruko:
 I found a dinosaur for you.
 Look, he's right over there!

Misuzu:
 Huh? Ah!

Haruko:
 Let's say we go and get it, 'kay?
 Come on, just a little further...
 It's okay, you can do it.
 Let me give you a boost.
 Once you get a hold of it, we're gonna take care of it forever and it'll be one of our happiest memories.

Misuzu:
 I'm just too sleepy, Mommy...

Haruko:
 No, don't!
 Don't give up now when you're almost there!
 Your little friend and me are both here to help you.
 We're all in this together, so let's make it happen, okay?

Misuzu:
 Mmhmm.

Haruko:
 Just a little farther and everything will be better, I promise.

Haruko:
 Yeah, you got it now, honey!

Misuzu:
 I did it!

Haruko:
 Believe it or not, this is the birthday present I got for you this year.
 I've actually bought you... a present every single year.
 Would you take it, Misuzu?

 Misuzu:
 Mmm. Thank you.

 Haruko:
 You will?
 I'm glad to hear, so very glad.

 Misuzu:
 He's cute.

 Haruko:
 "Gao!," right?

 Misuzu:
 Gao...

 Haruko:
 Oh, thank you, it's wonderful.

 Misuzu:
 Mom's sleeping...
 She hasn't slept in a long time because of me.

 Haruko:
 Oh man, I wasn't asleep, was I?
 I'm so sorry.

 Misuzu:
 It's okay. Let's sleep.
 But I think I wanna sleep with you in your bed tonight, Mom.

 Haruko:
 I'm not sure that's such a good idea.
 I mean if you dream while you're asleep, your pain's just gonna get worse, isn't it?

Misuzu:
 No. There's no pain anymore.

Haruko:
 Huh?

Misuzu:
 I haven't been in pain for a long time now.
 I don't know why.

Haruko:
 Is that true?
 You're really feeling better?

Misuzu:
 Yeah, that's why I wanna go to sleep.
 I wanna get my rest so I can get stronger.

Haruko:
 Really?
 I'm so glad! That's the best news I've ever heard.
 I could see you were trying to get better and... now I think...
 I think you're finally gonna be rewarded.

Misuzu:
 Ahaha...

Haruko:
 Misuzu... no... That's not candy...
 Don't eat it...
 You'll get sick...

Misuzu:
 I know you can't hear me, but I need to apologize.
 I'm sorry about lying, but if I hadn't, you wouldn't have gotten any rest.
 Oh, Yukito...
 I think I'll write in my diary.



Haruko:
 Misuzu!
 Huh!?

Misuzu:
 Did I fall asleep on my desk?

Haruko:
 Is everything okay? Are you all right?
 Do you remember who I am this morning?

Misuzu:
 Of course, you're my mom.

Haruko:
 Hah...

Haruko:
 Looks like it's cleared up.
 Should be nice now that the storm's passed.

Misuzu:
 I think you should know I had another one of my dreams last night.

Haruko:
 A dream?
 You always feel worse after one of those dreams, don't you?

Misuzu:
 It's okay.
 I don't have any pains anywhere at all.
 And besides, I think that might be the last dream I ever have.

Haruko:
 Really?
 You're not just telling me you're okay, are you?
 I mean you really aren't feeling any pain anymore?

Misuzu:
 I'm fine.
 Hehehe...

Haruko:
 Seriously?
 That freeloader tried to tell me something really scary would happen after you had the last one of those dreams, but I guess he was wrong about all that, huh.
 I've just been so worried.
 This has been like living in one big long nightmare.
 Now, it looks like it's finally over.

Misuzu:
 Oh, Mom, don't...

Haruko:
 I guess I can't tell you not to cry anymore, 'cause look at what a crybaby I am.

Misuzu:
 Yeah, there's nothing to cry about.

Haruko:
 That's right. There's nothing to be sad about anymore.
 So I just need to pull myself together, don't I?

Misuzu:
 That dream I had last night, it was about a dinosaur with wings.
 He really seemed to enjoy flying around 'cause he kept going "Gao!" all the time.

Haruko:
 Is that right?

Misuzu:
 And I was flying too.
 Only I was higher up than he was.
 I kept looking back at him.
 That's when I saw them:
 I was flying through the sky and...
 I had this pair of pure white wings.

Haruko:
 Really?
 Sounds like a nice dream.

Misuzu:
 Oh no, it was a sad dream.
 It was the saddest dream ever.
 But from now on, I'm not gonna have any more dreams.
 From now on, I'm just gonna stay right here with you.
 Forever and always...



Haruko:
 Huh, sure feels good out here today, doesn't it?

Misuzu:
 Yeah, it sure does feel good out here today.

Haruko:
 It smells just like summertime.

Misuzu:
 Yeah, I think so too.

Haruko:
 I wonder what makes it smell that way?

Misuzu:
 I think it's the ocean.

Haruko:
 Oh, that's right. That's what it is.

Misuzu:
 And it smells like the sun, too.

Haruko:
 I guess. Whatever you say.

Misuzu:
 And mostly, it smells like you, Mom.

Haruko:
 Are you kidding?
 Yuck!
 I think it would be pretty gross if summertime smelled like me, don't you?

Misuzu:
 But it does smell like you and I think it's wonderful.

Haruko:
 Are you crazy?

Misuzu:
 Uh-uh, but it's the truth.
 I always think that summer smells a lot like you.
 The smell of my favorite mother of all time.

Haruko:
 Summer would suck if I smelled really bad, huh?

Misuzu:
 It would stink if you stunk.
 But you don't, you smell good.

Haruko:
 Do I? Well, that's good.

Misuzu:
 Yeah, I'm glad too.

Misuzu:
 It sure is hot.

Haruko:
 Yes, it is, isn't it?
 Hey Misuzu, want me to read your mind and tell you what you're thinking right now?

Misuzu:
 Uh-huh?

Haruko:
 "I wish I could have weird juice."

Misuzu:
 That's amazing!

Haruko:
 It's nothing really.

Misuzu:
 I want that one.

Haruko:
 That one again, huh?
 The nasty juice people are making a mint off you!

Misuzu:
 Yeah.

Haruko:
 Now, which one should I have?

Misuzu:
 Well I'm glad to see you're trying some weird juice today.

Haruko:
 I'm kinda scared...

Haruko:
 What's the deal with this crap?!
 What kind of freak drinks this stuff?!

Misuzu:
 Oh, don't throw it away!
 You're supposed to squeeze it while you suck on the straw.

Haruko:
 Mmhmm?
 Hey, this doesn't taste too bad.

Misuzu:
 Hmm...
 It's summer vacation, isn't it?

Haruko:
 Well, summer vacation for just me and you.
 But I think that's okay.
 I'd rather play with you than anyone else.

Misuzu:
 Listen, Mom. I want you to go on ahead a little way.

Haruko:
 How come? You planning on doing something?

Misuzu:
 Maybe.
 Can you take Sky with you too?



Haruko:
 So, is this far enough then?

Misuzu:
 Yeah. Just wait there for a minute.

Haruko:
 Don't push yourself too hard!

Misuzu:
 I'm okay. Just please stay over there.

Haruko:
 Huh?

Misuzu:
 Don't come over here no matter what.
 I'm gonna do this by myself.
 I'm gonna do my best to walk all the way over to you.
 You're gonna be my goal, Mom.

Haruko:
 Okay, I'm your goal.

Misuzu:
 Yeah, I'm gonna make it all the way to you and Sky.

Haruko:
 Just take it one step at a time, and take as long as you need to.

Misuzu:
 Right.

Haruko:
 Are you feeling okay?

Misuzu:
 Mm-hm.

Haruko:
 Uhh.

Haruko:
 You can do it, Misuzu.
 Just a little bit more!
 That's right, you just take it slow, honey.
 If you try really hard, I'm sure you'll be better in no time.
 We'll do our best together, okay?
 Okay, Misuzu?

Misuzu:
 Is...

Haruko:
 Yeah?

Misuzu:
 Is it all right?

Haruko:
 Hm? What do you mean?

Misuzu:
 I've done my best, haven't I?
 Is it okay to cross the finish line now?

Haruko:
 Worn out already, huh? It's all right.
 Once you reach your goal, we'll go home and play cards all afternoon.

Misuzu:
 No, Mom. The goal that...
 The goal that I've been trying to reach all this time...

Haruko:
 Huh?

Misuzu:
 You know, you know I did my best, so it's okay now, all right?
 I can rest now, finally I... ow...

Haruko:
 Don't tell me you're in pain again?
 Have you been hurting all this time, baby?

Misuzu:
 Stay where you are!

Haruko:
 No, no... This can't be happening because you're supposed to be getting better.
 You're supposed to be past all this stuff.
 You told me that the bad dreams were over, Misuzu!

Misuzu:
 I'm so sorry, Mom.
 But I was able to do everything that I needed to.
 And that's why I'm going to cross the finish line.

Haruko:
 No, Misuzu. Don't do it.
 You don't have to do this.
 I mean we only just started.
 We only really started yesterday!
 So it can't be over yet.
 We're gonna get it all back.
 The happy life that we should've started ten years ago.
 We're gonna get all of that back together.
 You hear me?
 Our happiness just started, so you can't end it now!

Misuzu:
 No, Mom. We... We did everything.
 Almost more than enough.
 This summer was filled with more happiness than some people have in an entire lifetime.

Haruko:
 No! You're wrong!
 There are so many more things I wanted to do for you!
 I love you, and there's so much more I can do to show you!
 No, it can't be over yet!

Misuzu:
Before this summer started, I decided to try one more time to find happiness.
 My summer started the day I found Yukito sleeping up there on the seawall.
 And all sorts of things have happened since then.
Some of them were painful, and some of them were difficult.
 But I'm still... I'm still glad I tried so hard.
 Happiness is all I was ever searching for.
 And in the end, I wasn't all alone.
 That's why... That's why I'm going to cross the finish line.

Haruko:
 You can't! We only just started!
 Listen to me, it's not time yet!

Misuzu:
 I did it...



Misuzu:
 I've finally reached what I've been searching for.
 It's a wonderful place where I'm gonna stay forever and ever.
 It's better than I imagined.
 It's so...
 It's the happiest place in the whole world.

Haruko:
 No! This isn't happening!

Misuzu:
 Oh, Mommy... Thank you...

Haruko:
 Aarrggghhhhh....
 You taught me so many things, my sweet little girl...
 You taught me how not to live alone...
 So you can't leave me here, you can't just leave me alone like this!
 I don't need anything else.
 I don't need friends, I don't need any new clothes, I don't need any fancy or expensive things, I don't need anything, if I can just be with you again...
 Oh, please, let's go back and try again...
 Misuzu... Misuzu!


Haruko:
 After that day, I cried day in and day out for weeks on end.
 And now, I think I'm completely cried out.

Keisuke:
Yeah...

Haruko:
 Family really is pretty incredible, don't you think?
 Happiness beyond compare and pain beyond compare, all of it rolled into one.
 I guess that's what life is about, isn't it?
 That's why I lived.
 I mean, that's why I lived when I was with her.
 In the sense that when we were together, I was really alive.
 Reckless and tattered... Strong, yet really weak...
 I don't even know what I'm trying to say anymore.

Keisuke:
No, I understand.
I really do.

Haruko:
 Yeah, I guess you of all people would understand.
 You know what?
 One thing I've noticed is that I feel way more confident now than I did before calling myself her mother.
 I may not have been the best mother in the world, or even a halfway decent one, but I meant something to her.
 I've decided that I wanna quit my job and maybe get a position teaching at a daycare or something.
 I wanna be some place where I'm surrounded by all sorts of families.
 At least, that's what I'm thinking now anyway.
 So, maybe I'll come by and visit you sometime?

Keisuke:
That'd be great.
I look forward to it.
Summer's over so soon.
Seems so short this year.


Haruko:
 Huh...
 Is that you, Sky?
 You've grown quite a bit, haven't you?
 Or, are you even the same crow? I can't tell.
 Well, I guess if you really are Sky, I should be giving you the talking-to of your life.
 What in the world are you still hanging around here for, you crazy bird?
 If you think I'm gonna take care of you, you are wrong!
 Uh... You know, you're gonna have to leave here, right?
 You've got wings, so it should be pretty easy.
 Us wingless people don't have a choice.
 The sky is out of reach for us.
 So, I've got a task for you.
 Fly for me and everyone else who doesn't have any wings.
 It's up to you to take our hopes and dreams up to the sky!
 Then everyone will be at peace.
 I can't prove it'll happen, but it's worth a try.
 Don't you think?

 So, you go up there and tell the gods everything that's in our hearts.
 Then maybe someone'll hear.

Haruko:
 Well, that's it.
 Hope we meet again someday.
 Until then, take care of yourself, Bird!

Sky:
 Before I realized, I was looking into the sky.
 The sky that always bore a hint of sadness.
 The blue that continued into infinity.
 There was the young girl... returned yet again, but who still remains alone.
 Which is why I must continue my journey to find her.
 And one day, I swear... I'm going to bring her home.
 Only then, can she greet a new beginning.



My child, heed my words.
The story I'm about to tell you is a very important one.
It entails a long, long journey, undertaken by the parent and passed on to the child, continuing from generation to generation without end.
We will pass on the memories of this planet, and bear witness to every phenomenon along the way, and pass them on until there are no more children.
When the skies are clouded by hatred and wars, this planet will be overwhelmed, overwhelmed by its own grief and all will be lost.
That end cannot be avoided.
It is the way of all things.
But, in the end... We must always be mindful of the memories we will pass on to that last child.
May that child's memories be of nothing but happiness.


Girl:
 Is something wrong?

Boy:
 No, I was just... remembering something from a long time ago.
 The sun will be down soon.

Girl:
 Yeah?

Boy:
 You wanna go check it out before it gets dark?

Girl:
 Check what out?

Boy:
 You know, the thing you're always talking about wanting to see?
 Whatever it is, it's beyond the shoreline.

Girl:
 I didn't know that I told you about that.

Boy:
 Maybe you didn't.
 But I got the feeling that that was something you were thinking about.

Girl:
 Well, you're right.
 I do wanna check it out.

Boy:
 If we go now, we can find out what's waiting there.

Misuzu:
 Bye!

Boy:
 What do you think?

Girl:
 Sure.

Boy:
 Cruel times await those two.
 I wish them luck.
 For us, it's just the beginning.
