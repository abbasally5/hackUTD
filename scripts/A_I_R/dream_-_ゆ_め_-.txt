Yukito:
What in the world happened to you?
Why were you on the floor when I got here this morning?

Misuzu:
I just felt a little dizzy and got my feet tangled up.
I'm sorry I made you worry about me.

Yukito:
Maybe you're anemic.
Shouldn't we go have a doctor check you out?

Misuzu:
Mm-mm. No. I think I just need to get some rest.
I'll bet school's started already, huh?

Yukito:
Missing one day isn't gonna make a difference with your grades.
Rest up, alright?

Misuzu:
Don't you have to go to work today, though?

Yukito:
I'll take the day off.

Misuzu's diary:
I went to school with Yukito.
I played with Yukito.
A bug flew into Yukito's breakfast but it didn't taste funny to him.
I went to the train station with Yukito.
I went to the shrine with Yukito.

Misuzu:
It's rude to read someone's diary.

Yukito:
Don't you have anything else to write about?

Misuzu:
Um, I think I like it just fine.

Yukito:
Well I hate to be blunt, but I don't think you have much of a future writing diaries.
From now on, instead of what you did, why not write about what you want to do?

Misuzu:
But, then it's not a diary.

Yukito:
Oh, yes it is.
Because then I'll try to make all those wishes come true for you.

Misuzu:
I wanna go to the ocean... with you, Yukito.
We've never gone down to the actual beach.
I wanna dig in the sand, and pick up some pretty, pretty seashells.

Yukito:
Oh, come on. You can see the ocean anytime, can't you?

Misuzu:
Oh, gao....

Yukito:
Mmm?
Have it your way.
I'll go to the beach with you, whenever you're ready.

Misuzu:
Mm.

-- OP --

Yukito's mother:
The girl in the sky, she had always said that she wanted to see the ocean, but I could never take her there.

Haruko:
Misuzu fainted, huh?

Yukito:
Yeah. She hasn't been feeling well all day.
She's resting in her room.
It'd be nice if you checked on her.

Haruko:
You and I both know that my drunk face in there won't make her feel any better.
But, hey! I've got some take-out sushi.
Care to join me, honey pie?
Come on, you think that was really necessary?

Yukito:
Why did you take Misuzu in the first place?

Haruko:
What?

Yukito:
Why did you take Misuzu in the first place!

Haruko:
So I guess she decided to tell you about that, did she?
Well, I didn't really have any choice in the matter.
You know how these things go.
I said I didn't want her from the beginning

Yukito:
Oh, I see. So you think that gives you permission not to get too attached?
Think about it! That little girl needs someone she can depend on!

Haruko:
She has one of her episodes every time she starts making friends with someone.
She and I were never really all that close.
That's probably why this arrangement works.
Sometimes I wonder what a real family's supposed to be like, you know.
But I wouldn't know 'cause I'm not her real mom.
Whatever...

Yukito's mother:
The girl dreams.
She dreams all the time.
The first one is about the sky, and her dreams keep going back in time.
They plague her.
She starts to feel pain for no reason.
Eventually, she starts to lose her memories.
She won't even remember the people she loves the most.
And the morning after her final dream, she will die.
She remains forever alone.
It is her terrible fate.
If she becomes attached to anyone, both she and the person she loves will fall ill, neither one will survive.
She told me to stay away.
She was a kind girl and strong.
That's why I survived.
She protected me, but... I couldn't protect her.
There is a girl with wings who lives in the sky.
She is always alone and she perishes, never having had a chance to grow up.
She repeats her sad dreams over and over again.

Yukito:
You're going on a trip?!

Haruko:
I thought I'd get away for a while, visit some hot springs.

Yukito:
Oh, that's great, you're just gonna run away.
Give me a break!
Don't you care about Misuzu at all?!

Haruko:
Look, I figure she'll be fine with you for the next couple of days.
Just don't get too close to her and she'll be okay.

Yukito:
Wait! She started having the dreams.
It's the dreams that are doing this to her.
That's what's making her so sick.

Haruko:
What?

Yukito:
I just remembered something that my mother told me a long time ago.
You see, my mother met a girl who had the same sickness before I was born.
Misuzu will start to forget; she'll forget about me and about you.
And the morning after she has her last dream, she is going to die.
You can't leave her like this.

Haruko:
Listen here!
If this is supposed to be a joke, I think it's in pretty poor taste.

Yukito:
Oh come on, I'm trying to tell you something here. Misuzu'....

Haruko:
Get out of my way!

Yukito:
Hey!


Yukito:
I'm coming in.
I didn't expect you to be awake.

Misuzu:
Oh, I just woke up a couple of minutes ago.
I thought that I heard my mom's voice.

Yukito:
Yeah, it looks like she's gonna be away for a little while.

Misuzu:
Oh, I understand.
I really love my mom a lot.

Yukito:
Let's go see the ocean.

Misuzu:
Huh?

Yukito:
We're not in any hurry.
Just take it easy.

Misuzu:
Right.
Look! it's a crow!

Yukito:
Hey, are you gonna be okay?

Misuzu:
Oh, yeah.
I'll be fine.
I've walked down this road every day of my life, but I don't remember the ocean being so far away.

Yukito:
What's wrong?

Misuzu:
I'm sorry.
I... I...

Yukito:
Are you having another attack?

Misuzu:
I'm sorry.
I'll be... all right!
We'll see the ocean tomorrow.

Yukito:
Are you feeling better?

Misuzu:
Mmhmm.
Hey.

Yukito:
Hm?

Misuzu:
I had another dream last night, but this dream was happier than the other ones.
The night sky was really bright.
I think there was some kind of festival.
I was watching it from far away.

Yukito:
I see.

Misuzu:
Can I ask you something?

Yukito:
Go ahead.

Misuzu:
Is there a connection between the person you're looking for and my dreams?
I feel like there might be.

Yukito:
I kinda doubt that's the case.

Misuzu:
I've been thinking about this a lot.
And I think I know what's going on.
I think I get it.
The girl in my dreams isn't me, but rather another version of me.
I'm not sure why exactly, but she seems to be suffering.
I think I really have to see more of these dreams, because then maybe I'd be able to understand her, maybe even help her.
Then if I could, I don't know what would change for me, but I just feel like I need to do it.
You don't think it's a coincidence that I met you and then started having these dreams, do you?
I don't know why, but I thought this summer would be special.
I thought maybe this would be the summer I made friends.
But then I met you and started having all those dreams.
I think it's connected somehow, don't you?
I felt like doing my best this summer.
I'm making the summer the best one I've ever had in my whole life because this is the summer that I met you.

Yukito:
Hey.

Misuzu:
I think it's okay.
I'm feeling a whole lot better than I was.

Yukito:
Misuzu!

Misuzu:
I don't... I don't know what's happening to me.
It's like my legs won't move.

Yukito:
I'm thinking maybe we should call Hijiri.
Or I should just take you straight to the hospital.


Misuzu:
Uh-uh. I don't think it's anything that a doctor can fix.
And I'll bet you know that better than I do, Yukito.
You know that it's my dreams that're making me this way.

Yukito:
I'm not sure.

Misuzu:
I had another dream last night, too.
I was on a journey.

Yukito:
A journey?

Misuzu:
I was looking for something.
I was walking through a forest for days and days on end.
I was really tired, but I kept going.
I had someone very special with me.

Yukito:
Someone special?

Misuzu:
I know what's going on.
Every time I have a dream, I get weaker.
And in the end, I think I'll probably just turn out like the girl in the sky.

Yukito:
Stop! That's not going to happen to you.

Misuzu:
Thank you for caring.

Yukito:
Don't worry about those dreams so much.
Just get better, okay?
That's the most important thing.

Misuzu:
Mmhmm. All right. Will do.

-- Eyecatch --


Misuzu:
Yukito?!
Yukito, are you all right?
What happened to you?!

Yukito:
It was nothing.

Misuzu:
If it was nothing, then why does your face look like that, huh?

Yukito:
Come on, my face always looks like this.
You need to go on back to bed.

Misuzu:
No, I don't wanna leave you out here.

Yukito:
I'm gonna be fine, all right?
Just stop giving me a hard time, okay?
What the... What's going on here?

Misuzu:
Aw! It hurts!

Yukito:
Misuzu, you just hang on! Misuzu!

Misuzu:
It's okay I'm gonna be all right.
I promise to get better.
Please stay here with me.

Yukito:
But if I stay close to you....

Misuzu:
Please! Really I'll be fine. Just please don't leave me. Why does everyone I've ever loved always have to leave me?

Yukito:
So, how're you feeling?

Misuzu:
I'm doing better now.
How 'bout yourself?

Yukito:
I told you before, I'm fine. So what do you think?
Should I call Hijiri, or Kano maybe? Minagi's out of town, but maybe we could reach someone else from school.

Misuzu:
Uh-uh, no, I don't wanna to be a bother to anyone.

Yukito:
You don't have to lie to me.
Don't you want friends?
I know you don't like being alone.

Misuzu:
The only person I want is you. As long as you're here with me, Yukito, I don't need anybody else. Do you not like that?

Yukito:
Don't be silly.

Misuzu:
I wanna see the ocean with you.
I want us to run on the beach and play around on the sand, splash water at each other, and at the end of the day we'll say "see you tomorrow!"
But I know I have to be patient at least for now. It's gonna be hard to put it off, but I guess if we finally do get to do, it'll be even better 'cause I'd wait for it. I have to be patient!

Yukito:
Misuzu.

Misuzu:
Yeah?

Yukito:
I think I'm gonna have to be leaving you soon.

Misuzu:
Huh?

Yukito:
Because if I stay with you any longer, neither one of us is going to survive.
I think the only thing I can really do at this point is get away from you.
I'll get out of town and go some place far away where we'll never see each other again.

Misuzu:
Never again?

Yukito:
That's right. I think we just let ourselves get too close to each other, Misuzu.

Misuzu:
Well, then I guess we don't have a choice.
That's how it has to be. And I guess maybe I just should have played by myself all along, huh, Yukito.

Yukito:
Maybe you should have.

Misuzu:
Hm. But even so, I had a good time.
I liked spending my summer vacation with you.

Yukito:
I had a good time, too.

Misuzu:
You did?

Yukito:
Yeah.

Looks I missed the last bus.

Misuzu:
Yukito.

Yukito:
Yeah.

Misuzu:
I wanted to tell you about another dream I had where I was locked in a room all by myself. I was so sad.
I felt like I was just waiting and waiting for someone to get me out of there.
I don't wanna be left alone any more, Yukito. Please take me with you. Yukito, I wanna go wherever you go.

Yukito:
Misuzu, you know it isn't that I wanna leave this place.
It's that I have to stay away from you. As long as I'm around, you're gonna keep getting sicker and I can't help you.
That's why I've gotta go, Misuzu, and get away from you as fast as I can.

Misuzu:
I-I understand now.
I must've sounded pretty dumb asking you to stay.

Yukito:
You didn't.

Misuzu:
Bye, then.
Please promise you'll take care of yourself.

Yukito:
All right.
You take care too.
Stay strong no matter what, you hear?

Misuzu:
Mmhmm.
Even when I'm alone, I'm strong.
I'm a tough kid, remember?

Yukito:
Yeah. Bye now.

Yukito's mother:
Listen, I can tell what you're not thinking, you're not thinking that you want your audience to laugh with you.
That is why the puppet's not moving. Just wishing for him to move isn't enough. You must reach further, and then and only then, he will dance for you.
Congratulation, Son!
The girl in the sky; she had always said that she wanted to see the ocean.
But I could never take her there. Yukito, I want you to save her this time.
There was a wish that was never granted; a wish that resides inside this puppet.
My mother and her mother before her somehow managed to put their power into it before they died.
They did this in anticipation of the day someone would release her wish.
So I want to become one of the wishes, too.
How you use the puppet in the future is up to you.
You can forget about the girl in the sky if you like, forget I have mentioned her.
But one day, you're going to meet her and if you really feel like you want to help her then all you need to do is put your heart and soul into the puppet... because then... I will be with you again.

Yukito:
... my heart and soul into the puppet.
Mother...
You will be with me again.


Boy B: Boy B は Luci Christian (晴子役)
I think maybe there's something wrong with this guy.

Girl B?:
He's kind of stinky.

Girl A: Girl A は Stephanie Wittels (佳乃 役)
Yeah, like, maybe he's drunkenly passed out from the heat. ※意味的には左の文でないとおかしいが、その場合drunk[en]lyとo[ut]で[]内の音節の音を落としている

Yukito:
Hey there, little guy.

Boy B:
Waah! hey, let me go, hey yo!

Yukito:
I need you to help me.

Boy B:
Huh?

Yukito:
Now watch the show and tell me how to make it more fun.
I wanna learn how to make people laugh with this, you understand?

Boy B:
Wow, that's neato.

Girl A:
And weird.

Boy C?:
It's cool and all but it's lacking in the comedy.

Girl B?, Boy A:
Mmhmm.

Girl A:
Maybe if you had him do something more than just walking, it would be funny.

Boy C?:
What if you had it tell us a story?

Girl A?:
Could it dance or something?

Yukito:
Uh, dance how?

Girl A:
Uh, no.

Boy C?:
It's gotta have better move than that.

Children:
That's a really good work.
Look at that.
Yeah!

Boy B:
Now that's the funny it needed.

Girl A:
Both funny and cute at the same time!

Yukito:
Okay, thanks a lot, guys. I appreciate your help today.

Children:
Good luck, mister!
Hope it works!
Bye!
Bye-bye!
See you!
Adios!

Yukito:
Misuzu. I've come back. I'm never gonna leave again.
I'm gonna stay right here by your side and try to keep you smiling, okay?

Misuzu:
Yukito, you're here.

Yukito:
I figured out what I need to do. This is really gonna make you laugh, so pay close attention. Can you do that?
Misuzu! You don't fall asleep. You've gotta watch this. You've gotta laugh!
Why didn't I realize it sooner? All I ever needed was to be here with you and to make you laugh.
If I just could've done that, I would've been content.
I'm never going to leave you again. I'm just going to stay here with you and watch you smile, okay?

Yukito's mother:
Yukito, remember what it is you need to do. It's not too late.

Yukito:
I-I just wanna stay here with Misuzu. I wanna do everything all over again.
If I could, I'd go back, back to the very beginning, and this time I wouldn't leave her.

Misuzu:
What's happening?
I thought I wouldn't be able to wake up again.
Yukito? Hey, Yukito, where are you? I thought that you'd come back for me.
Hey, I'm feeling better now and I wanna see your trick.
I think I'm gonna be okay now. Yukito, where are you? Yukito....

Yukito:
Whoa!



Kanna:
Would you care to tell me? What do you think you're doing all the way out here?

Ryuya:
If you have time to talk, then you have time to get off of me, too.

Kanna:
If I'm not mistaken, you're not from around here.

Ryuya:
My name is Ryuya, assist lieutenant of the Palace Guard.
So what about you. Who might you be?

Kanna:
You mean, you don't know who I am?

Ryuya:
Oh, no, after all, we did just meet.

Kanna:
I guess so. I suppose that I'm not as well-known as I thought I was. My name is Kanna.

Ryuya:
Really? The winged person who ordered me to become a guard in the first place was named Kanna, too.

Kanna:
That's just, eh, a coincidence.

Ryuya:
Yeah, isn't that strange?
Hahahaha!

Kanna:
What are you laughing at?!
