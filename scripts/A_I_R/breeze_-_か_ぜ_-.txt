  Narration:
My child, heed my words.
The story I'm about to tell you is a very important one.
It entails a long, long journey, undertaken by the parent and passed on to the child, continuing from generation to generation without end.

Yukito:
I'm starving...

Child #1:
Man, am I hungry!

Child #2:
Yeah, ya already told us that!

Child #3:
Why are you walking so slow?

Child #4:
Pick up the pace, would ya?

Yukito:
Hey, you guys!
Do you kids have any idea how much ramen's costing a guy these days?
I'm absolutely starving right now, and I would like nothing more than to have some delicious ramen in my belly.
Unfortunately, I don't have any money. What I do have is a fun little puppet show that you can pay me for before you go home. Okay, kiddies?

What do you think?
And didn't I tell ya?
Isn't that great?
Worth a couple of bucks?

Child #1:
What's with that filthy little doll!

Child #2:
Eww...

Child #3:
Don't it do anything else?

Child #4:
This thing's stupid!

Yukito:
Aren't you kids just the best.
Seriously, you guys can pay me whatever you think it's worth.

Child #1:
I'm sorry, but that puppet is totally nasty!

Child #2:
Why would anybody pay money to look at that dumb thing?
Are you out of your mind, mister?

Yukito:
OOKAAAY!

Child #2:
Run, you guys!

Yukito:
Oh! That's just great!
Get back here!



[OP:鳥の詩]



Yukito:
Get away from my ramen!



[第一話　かぜ　-breeze-]



Misuzu:
Good afternoon!

Yukito:
What's with this girl?

Misuzu:
You all by yourself?
Hot today, isn't it?

Yukito:
What is she after? Money?
Hmph, I don't have any money.

Misuzu:
I bet you're really thirsty.
I'll go get you something!

Here you go.

Yukito:
Have a nice trip?

Misuzu:
Gao...

Yukito:
"Extra thick peach nectar"?

Misuzu:
Why would you go and do something like that?

Yukito:
Tryna make a fool of me!?
What do you want!?

Misuzu:
Why would I be mean to you?
I think this stuff is delicious!

Misuzu:
Do you wanna go to the beach?

Yukito:
What for?

Misuzu:
'Cause I wanna play.

Yukito:
Huh?

Misuzu:
Yesterday I saw some kids playing on the beach, it looked like fun!
And when I was watching you sleep, I thought it might be nice to go down to the beach and play when you woke up.
Don't you think that that would be nice?

Yukito:
You... watched me sleep?

Misuzu:
Oh, well you've been sleeping there since yesterday, right?
I poked you a couple of times to try to wake you up, but it didn't look like you were going to any time soon...

Yukito:
I guess I was so hungry I didn't really notice.

Misuzu:
Where are you going now?

Yukito:
To work.

Misuzu:
Oh, really?
What do you do?

Yukito:
I perform a puppet show--
It's gone.

Misuzu:
Is it really that important?

Yukito:
I need it to make a living.
Look, it's hot out here.
You've looked long enough.
So go home.

There it is!

Misuzu:
Mr. Crow!

Yukito:
I want the doll, not the crow!

Misuzu:
Wasn't that wonderful?

Yukito:
Yeah, I guess so...
I think I owe you one.

Misuzu:
So does that mean we can go play on the beach now?

Yukito:
...What are you after?
How come you've been hanging around me all day?

Misuzu:
I told you, I just wanna play on the beach.
We can run on the sand, or splash water at each other--
And then at the end of the day, we'll say "See you tomorrow!"...and then we'll go our separate ways.

Yukito:
...It almost sounds like being friends or something.

Misuzu:
That's right, friends!
You be friends with me, and me with you.

Anyway... let's go play, okay?

Yukito:
We can't be friends, we don't even know each other's names.

Misuzu:
Oh, well... mine's Misuzu Kamio.
What's your name?

Yukito:
...I'm Yukito Kunisaki-- But listen!
I don't have time to play around!
...I've gotta earn some money so I can get something to eat.

Misuzu:
Oh, if that's all you need...

Yukito:
So I ended up following her home, lured by the thought of food...

Misuzu:
It's nice to have someone to eat with, huh?

Yukito:
Do you usually eat alone?

Misuzu:
My mom usually comes home really late, and I don't have a dad.
Once you finish your dinner, can we go play?

Yukito:
Nah, I gotta find a place to stay before it gets dark.

Misuzu:
You don't know where you're gonna spend the night?

Yukito:
Oh, I'll probably just be sleeping on the seawall.

Misuzu:
Why don't you stay here?

Yukito:
Look kid, you just met me a couple hours ago.
You don't have any idea who I am, or where I came from or anything.
I'm a total stranger!
You must be out of your mind.
What would your mother say if she knew you asked me that?

Misuzu:
She wouldn't care.
My mother's really hands-off, so she wouldn't say anything.
I guess I shouldn't really be talking about my mom like that.
...But really, it's totally okay if you stay here.

Yukito:
I don't have the energy to play with you right now.

Misuzu:
Okay, we can play tomorrow then, I understand.
It's summer vacation, so I have lots of time to play.

Yukito:
I don't think so.

Misuzu:
Oh, gao...

Hey, why do you think they make us learn math anyway?
Do you think I'll really need quadratic equations when I grow up?

Yukito:
Quiet.
If you want me to help you with your homework, you gotta let me concentrate, all right?
....And sit up straight.

Misuzu:
You know, you sounded just like my mom when you said that.

Yukito:
I did?

Misuzu:
Uh-huh!
I think that might be her.

Yukito:
That's your mom?

Misuzu:
Sounds like she ran into the shed again.
Don't worry.
She's okay.
It happens all the time.

Yukito:
Hey, you sure it's okay for me to be here?

Misuzu:
Mm-hm.
I can smooth it over with her.

Haruko:
OH YEAH?

Yukito:
This isn't how you told me it'd be.

Haruko:
YOU STAY OUT OF THIS!
Why on earth do you think I'd let some strangers stay here in my house?

Misuzu:
Um... gao...

Haruko:
I'm tired of telling you to stop making that noise.
Now I wanna know how you know my Misuzu.

Yukito:
Uhh....we're classmates.

Haruko:
Yeah?
You're kinda old to be in school with her, aren't you?

Yukito:
Don't fall for me.

Haruko:
IN YOUR DREAMS, pretty boy!
Okay, it seems like you've got some self-confidence, and I can kind of admire you for that.

Misuzu:
That's right, and Yukito's a really nice guy too.

Haruko:
Hm?
All right then, he can stay here.

Yukito:
Seriously?

Haruko:
Shut up before I change my mind!
But there're gonna be two conditions, all right?
First, you sleep in the shed, and second, you drink with me.

Misuzu:
Uh...

Haruko:
And then in the end, this is... this is what the guy said to me, listen.
He said, "well hon, I guess maybe I was the one who fell in love with you."
So, at that point I kinda figured that I'd already won.
And I says to him, "you just threw back a mermaid, baby?"
OH MAN, you should've seen his face, he couldn't believe I offed him like that.

Yukito:
She always end up like this?

Misuzu:
She is in top form tonight.

Haruko:
Hey Freeloader, how come you're looking so down in the mouth, huh?
I want you to join in the fun with me, okay?

Yukito:
Ouch!

Misuzu:
Yukito!!

Yukito:
What are you talking about... just what do you want me to do.

Haruko:
Take your pick, sweetheart, an erotic confession or a special talent, either one works for me.

Yukito:
Okay, I gotcha.

Misuzu:
Hey, it's your doll thingy.
Wow, that's great!

Yukito:
This is how I earn my living.
My mother taught me.
She used to be a traveling puppeteer, too.

Haruko:
When does it do something funny?
BOR-ING!
Where is the showmanship, huh?

Misuzu:
I think it's amazing and it's kinda magical, you know?

Haruko:
Who wants magic?
If this little guy did something funny, it wouldn't matter if his strings were showing or not!

Yukito:
Good night....

Misuzu:
Oh no, you hurt his feelings, now he's going to bed.

Haruko:
Oh come on, so you're a hack, there's no shame in that, is there?
Sit back down, have another drink.

Haruko:
My name's Haruko, by the way. Haruko Kamio.

Yukito:
Why don't you hit me again, grandma?

Haruko:
I just told you my name so don't call me that, alright?
You're dumb or you just act that way.
"Grandma"... geez.

So... you a runaway or something?

Yukito:
I'm... traveling.

Haruko:
You're not just wandering, you're going towards a goal, right?

Yukito:
Maybe?

Haruko:
You are such a young man.

Yukito:
Well, compared to you.

Haruko:
You know, I think you're a pretty funny guy.

Yukito:
I am, huh?

Haruko:
I've got a pretty good eye when it comes to men and I don't think I'd mind it one bit if you stuck around for a little while.
Would you do me a favor, though?
Would you look after her for me?
Maybe you've noticed, there's something a little bit off about her sometimes.
She gets a thought in her head, and she runs with it without thinking about the consequences, you know?

Yukito:
What am I? A babysitter?

Haruko:
And if you can make her stop doing that roar thing, you know what I'm talking about, she goes "Gao."
She does it all the time, when she's frustrated, or about to cry.

Yukito:
Uh-huh?

Haruko:
She thinks it makes her sound like a big dinosaur.
She's crazy about dinosaurs, she's been into them ever since she was just a little thing.
She's still a little thing, just a kid.

-- Eyeｃatch --

Yukito:
Wait a minute, I thought it was summer vacation.

Misuzu:
I have to take remedial classes.

Yukito:
Is Haruko gone already?

Misuzu:
Yeah, she leaves pretty early.
I haven't had breakfast with someone in ages.

So what are you doing today, Yukito?

Yukito:
Well, first I'm gonna walk you to school.
Your mom asked me to do it.
She wanted me to make sure you didn't do anything dumb, or whatever.

Misuzu:
She doesn't trust me at all, does she?

And it's done, I made you a map of town.

Yukito:
Well, that didn't take you long.

Misuzu:
I drew it so you can see where there'll be a bunch of people.
That should help you when you go to work today, right?

Yukito:
Yeah, thanks a lot.

Misuzu:
I'm gonna be late.
I'm gonna be in so much trouble.

Yukito:
I'll pick you up after school!
Meet me here, okay?

Misuzu:
Okay.

Bye!

Yukito:
Oh... good grief.
I'm in charge of a girl with severe brain damage.

Potato:
Piko!

Yukito:
What do you want?
Are you supposed to be this town's legendary creature?
Like some crazy wish-granting puppy thing, where if I do something nice, you'll give me a bunch of wishes.
Okay, come up here.
I'll show you something good.
Isn't that so amazing that you wanna give me seven wishes instead of your usual three?

Hey!
HEY!! COME BACK!!
That's right, just give it up now, you evil space creature.

Kano:
What are you doing?

Yukito:
I was trying to catch that weird little alien that ran away with my puppet.

Kano:
You mean him?
Potato isn't a weird little alien, you sillyhead.
He's just our neighborhood stray puppy dog, that's all.

Yukito:
What, are you telling me that thing's like a dog dog?

Potato:
Piko, piko.

Kano:
Mm-hm, mm-hm.

Yukito:
Wha...?

Potato:
Piko, piko, piko, piko, piko, piko.

Kano:
Mm-hm, mm.
I understand.
I'm sorry, he must've caused you a lot of trouble.

Yukito:
Why are you apologizing?

Kano:
Well, Potato says he brought your puppet here and you seem really mad, he only wanted to play with you.

Potato:
Piko, piko.

Yukito:
[Here/Hear/You] mean you can understand that little thief?

Kano:
Well, yeah, we're best friends. Right, Potato?

Potato:
Piko, piko.

Yukito:
Okay, just when I thought this planet couldn't get any weirder...

Kano:
Here you go.

Yukito:
Thanks a lot.
Did you hurt your wrist or something?

Kano:
Oh! This?
No, no, It's just----------
I'm sorry, but that's a secret!

I'm Kano Kirishima.
Who are you?

Yukito:
Yukito Kunisaki.

Kano:
I'm guessing you might have some free time right now.

Yukito:
Well.....

Kano:
Yeah! see, you're like citizen number two on the intergalactic planet Dilly-Dally!

Yukito:
Number two..?
Who's number one?

Kano:
That's me, and Potato here is citizen number three.

Yukito:
And what do the Dilly-Dallyians do all day?

Kano:
They don't do anything!
That is the sad fate of the men and women of Dilly-Dally.
Isn't that right, Potato?

Well, I should be getting to school.
So I'll say good-bye for now.

Yukito:
I thought you had nothing to do on your planet!

Kano:
Are you kidding?
I was just playing around!
You crazy or what?
See ya!

Yukito:
I wonder if every girl who wears that uniform is a total wacko.

Kano:
HEY!

Yukito:
Yes, ma'am?

Kano:
Did you ever wish you could do magic?
You know, like when you were a little kid?

Yukito:
Huh?

Kano:
I think I confused him.
So long!

Misuzu:
Oh, hey there, Yukito!
So, how did it go at work today?

Yukito:
I made a million bucks!

Misuzu:
Oh my gosh! Really?

Yukito:
Umm....no, not really.
I have to find a place where more people gather or I'm never gonna make any money.
I mean, why is this place so quiet?
Where are all the people coming home from work?

Misuzu:
Well, this train station's been closed for over a year now.

Yukito:
You could've told me that earlier.

Misuzu:
Oh, gao...
Hey, what did you do that for?

Yukito:
Your mom wants you to stop doing that dinosaur "gao" thing, so she told me to correct you if you did it again.

Misuzu:
Oh, look at that, it's a bubble.
It's Minagi...

Yukito:
Do you know her?

Misuzu:
Mm-hm.

Yukito:
What's wrong with you, Misuzu?

Misuzu:
Hello.

Minagi:
I wasn't expecting to see you here today.

Misuzu:
Yeah. This is, uh, quite a coincidence.
Pretty strange, huh?
What are you doing out here by yourself?

Minagi:
Getting a little sun.
I'm only kidding.
Because, as you can see, it's evening right now.

Yukito:
Okay, who the heck is this girl?

Misuzu:
Minagi Tohno.
She's my classmate.
She's really smart.
She's at the top of our grade, and she's president of the astronomy club.

Minagi:
If you ever wish to say my name, I prefer Tohno rather than Minagi, please.

Michiru:
Hey! Minagi!

Misuzu:
Poor Yukito is flying like a leaf on a windy day.

Michiru:
Hey!
Let's hurry up and blow some more bubbles before it gets dark.
Because I've been practicing and I'm really good, okay?

Misuzu:
I didn't know you had a little sister, Minagi.

Michiru:
I'm not her sister.
I'm Michiru, Minagi's best friend.
How do you two know each other?

Misuzu:
The two of us go to school together.

Yukito:
Uh, that hurt, you little squirt!

Michiru:
Oh, are you another one of Minagi's classmates?

Yukito:
No, I'm the innocent bystander that you just plowed into.

Michiru:
I know your type!
This guy's just a pervert who likes kidnapping young girls for kicks.

Misuzu:
I feel so included right now...

Yukito:
What'd you call me?

Michiru:
Oh no, he's angry.
We young girls're in danger!
Aw...

Misuzu:
Oh, that must've hurt.

Minagi:
You haven't introduced me to your friend.

Misuzu:
Yukito Kunisaki.
He's a traveler, but he's staying with me and my mom, and sleeping in our shed.

Minagi:
I see. A traveler.

Michiru:
Oh, so you're not just a pervert kidnapper, you're a homeless vagrant too?

Minagi:
Miss Kamio, I think we'd better be going.

Michiru:
What?
But I was getting really good at blowing bubbles and I wanted to show you.
Kami-Kami can join us if she wants to.

Misuzu:
Kami-Kami, is that me?

Minagi:
It's getting pretty dark out here.
So why don't we just come back tomorrow?
I can pack a nice lunch for us if you like.

Michiru:
Bye!!
See you, Kamio.

Misuzu:
Bye!
Nice to meet you.

Michiru:
Oh, and Yukito?

Yukito:
Yeah.

Michiru:
You leave the little girls alone. Hear me?

Yukito:
Why, you little braaaaat!

Michiru:
Hey, hey.
Will you make me a hamburger for lunch tomorrow?

Minagi:
Sure.

Michiru:
You will? Wow!!

Yukito:
Did I do something wrong to that pipsqueak?

Misuzu:
I don't know.

Yukito:
I didn't make a dime off the puppet show today.
Hey, you were standing just like that yesterday when I first saw you.

Misuzu:
It's kinda funny.
I've always wondered what it would feel like to be in the sky.

Yukito:
How come?

Misuzu:
I don't know. I...
I've always had this feeling like there's another me up there.
Isn't that a romantic thought?
That the real you is up in the sky.
It must be amazing, you can see forever into the distance.
Everything on the ground would look so insignificant.
You'd probably feel very loving, or no, maybe not loving exactly, but gentle and calm.

Yukito:
Misuzu, is it you?

That was the beginning of a summer that, for me, seemed as short as the twinkling of a star, yet as long as all eternity.
