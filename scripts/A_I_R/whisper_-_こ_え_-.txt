  Misuzu:
Uh...

Yukito:
What's going on here?
 Kano. Are you okay?
 Wake up, Kano.

Misuzu:
Don't be so rough with her!

Kano:
That hurts.
 It really hurts.
 Dear, you can't.
 What is ... How did I get here?
 What's going on?
 Do you know... what happened to me?

-- OP --


Yukito:
 Can you stand up?

Kano:
 Yeah...
 Sorry about that.

Yukito:
 It's all right.
 Are you sure you can't remember anything?

Kano:
 Mmm... I'm sorry, but I can't.

Yukito:
 You don't need to apologize to me, Kano.

Misuzu
 What was going on out there in that grass field tonight?

Yukito:
 So, you saw it, too?

Hijiri:
 Kano!
 What is the meaning of this?

Yukito:
 Don't get the wrong idea!
 I know it must look weird that your little sister's in my arms in the middle of night and all,
 but I promise you it's not what you think it is.
 I mean I was just out here with Misuzu when we saw Kano and well one thing sorta led to another, we...


Hijiri:
 I've heard enough!

Misuzu:
 No! No! Wait!

Kano:
 Are...you okay?



Hijiri:
 I can't tell you how sorry I am about this.
 I jumped to the wrong conclusion and I got a little upset.

Yukito:
 Oh, really, that's what you call being a little upset?

Hijiri:
 What was that?

Yukito:
 Ah, nothing...!

Kano:
 I should really apologize, too.
 I'm sorry, Yukito.
 And I'm sorry to... you.

Misuzu:
 I'm Misuzu, Misuzu Kamio.

Kano:
 Oh, that's right.
 I think I've seen you around.

Misuzu:
 Yeah, I don't leave a very strong impression.

Hijiri:
 Well, I remember meeting you before.
 You've been in here for treatments from time to time, haven't you?

Misuzu:
 Yeah.

Yukito:
 Anyway, I hope you don't mind that your birthday kind of got derailed by all the weirdness this evening.

Misuzu:
 That's just gonna make it even more memorable in the end.

Yukito:
 How come you don't make friends with that Kano girl instead of hanging around with a loser like me all day?
 I bet you two'd get along okay.
 You're both kind of... you know.

Misuzu:
 Yeah. I guess you're right.

Yukito:
 Ah.

Misuzu:
 What's wrong?

Yukito:
 She forgot to pay me for the work I did today.
 Go on home.
 I'll meet you back there.

Misuzu:
 Can't you wait till tomorrow?

Yukito:
 She might try to stiff me if I wait till then.



Yukito:
Hey. Never got my money.
 I should probably lock that door.
What, are they asleep already?
 They sleep this early... just do it because.


Kano:
Aah! I thought you said you weren't gonna blind me with that light again.

Hijiri:
Sorry, Kano.
 But without this light I can't examine you the way I need to.
Hm, my goodness, you've grown up so fast.

Kano:
Stop it!
 Wha-what are you doing to me!

Hijiri:
It's called palpation.
 And it's a legitimate medical procedure.

Kano:
I don't know what palpation is but I'm pretty sure you're not doing it right!


Hijiri:
Hold still.

Kano:
Did you hear that noise?

Yukito:
Meow.

Kano:
Oh, it's just a cat.

Hijiri:
A cat. But we don't have a cat.

Kano:
Guess it was my imagination.

Hijiri:
It must've been.

Hijiri:
Oh right, Kano, let's continue.
 Kano? Hey! Answer me, Kano.
I see. So you're back again. It's been a while.
 Again! Stop it! It's the same thing over and over every time.

Kano:
This child--she's my life. My only true treasure.

Hijiri:
No! Kano belongs to me! She's my precious little sister!

Kano:
What? What's going on..?
 How come you... how come you're hugging me?

Hijiri:
You were half asleep.
 You started to hug me, so I hugged you in return.

Kano:
I don't remember that at all.

Hijiri:
That's why I told you to get to bed right away.

Kano:
Er, okay...
 Can we stay like this just a little while longer?
 You held me like this the night Dad died, remember?

Hijiri:
Yeah.

Kano:
Thanks. This feels nice.


palpate:触診(医学用語) 動詞: palpate :to touch part of someone's body in order to examine it


Misuzu:
Ahh!...Ahh!
A bug flew into the vent again!
Ohh! The soysauce bottle fell over.
Oh! I ruined Yukito's bacon and eggs and I don't have time to make more.
Ohh, the salad oil spilt...ohh...

Yukito:
...Misuzu!!

Misuzu:
I'm okay now.
Let's eat!

Um...Yukito?
Is something the matter?

Yukito:
Exactly what happened to my breakfast?

Misuzu:
Oh, it was nothing, nothing at all.

Yukito:
Why are you looking at me like "Wow! He's actually going to eat that!"?

Misuzu:
What?! No. Hey, what are you talking about?
Does it taste all right?

Yukito:
Yeah.

Misuzu:
Seriously?

Yukito:
Yeah.

Misuzu:
Doesn't taste like bugs?

Yukito
What did you do?!

Misuzu:
Nothing! Nothing!
Just enjoy your breakfast.


Misuzu:
Um... Yukito?

Yukito:
Hm?

Misuzu:
We're here already.

Yukito:
Oh, sorry.

Misuzu:
What's the matter?
It looks like you got something on your mind.

Yukito:
I do...

Misuzu:
Is it about last night?

Yukito:
It's about a bunch of stuff.

Misuzu:
I guess I'll see you after school then.

Yukito:
Sure.

Misuzu:
I'm okay.
Gao...




Hijiri:
 I'd feel better about paying you, if you would at least pretend to work or something.

Yukito:
 I've finished it already.

Hijiri:
 There's always more. C'mon, I'll find you something to do.
 Why are you looking at me like that?!
 If you've got something to say, you should just come out and say it!
 And a pay raise is out of the question, by the way.

Yukito:
 Not about money.

Hijiri:
 Then, what?

Yukito:
 Actually, it's about last night.

Kano:
 Hey! Have you guys seen Potato?

Hijiri:
 Now that you mention it, I haven't seen him in a while.

Kano:
 I've been looking and looking for him all morning, but I just can't find him anywhere.

Yukito:
 Potato!

Kano:
 Piko piko-

Yukito:
 Hey, Potato!

Kano:
 Piko piko-!

Yukito:
 Be a good boy, come out!


Kano:
 Piko-!


Yukito:
 Potato!

Kano:
 Piko piko-

Yukito:
 Hey, Potato!

Kano:
 I just don't understand where he could've gone.

Yukito:
 It's gonna be getting dark pretty soon, Kano.

Kano:
 Something wrong?

Yukito:
 No, it's okay. Let's keep looking.

Kano:
 He really is gone, isn't he, Yukito?
 I can't think of any place we haven't looked yet.

Yukito:
 Can you use your magic powers to find him?

Kano:
 Huh?
 I really wish I could, but I don't think it works like that.

Yukito:
 Okay...

Kano:
 When I was given this bandanna, I was told to keep it on until I'm a grownup and never ever take it off. 
And if I do that, I'll be able to use my magic powers.

Yukito:
 So, who gave it to you?

Kano:
 I was just a little kid, so I really don't remember.
 But I've been wearing it ever since then.
At swim meets and health checks it's always tough and people make fun of me all the time.
 You wouldn't believe some of the mean things kids say at school.

Yukito:
 Yeah.


Kano:
 But my sister always helps me out.
 Without her help, I never would've made it this far.
 Wow, we walked all the way to school.

Yukito:
 I doubt he would've come all the way out here by himself.


Kano:
 Did you see him?
 Hey, wait up!
 What's with you all of a sudden, Yukito.
 Why are you sweating?

Yukito:
 I got a pretty good idea where he is.

Kano:
 Seriously?

Yukito:
 Just follow me.

Kano:
 Over there? You mean in the school?

Yukito:
 Nope, right there.

Kano:
 Huh?
 You mean in that... bush?

Yukito:
 Mm-hm.

Kano:
 Are you sure about that... Ah, aah! Potato!

Potato:
Piko?

Kano:
 We've been looking for you everywhere.
 Oh, you! Don't you ever frighten me like that again, okay?

Potato:
Piko.

Kano:
 What're you doing all the way out here in the first place.
 And how on earth did you figure out he was hiding inside that bush?

Yukito:
 Yeah, see, there's a funny story about that.

Potato:
Piko, piko.

Yukito:
 You know a magician can't tell his secrets?
 Right?!

Kano:
 Now you listen to me.
 Don't ever wander off without telling me again, okay?


Potato:
Piko.

Kano:
 Yeah, you make sure that you don't.
 You know what a worrier I am.

Yukito:
 Kano.


Kano:
 Uh-huh.


Yukito:
 Do you really not remember anything at all about last night?

Kano:
 No, I'm sorry, I really don't.

Yukito:
 Don't apologize. I'm sorry I asked.

Kano:
 Hey, Yukito.
 Can I tell you something weird?

Yukito:
 You can say anything you want to me, Kano.

Kano:
 No matter how hard I try, I can barely remember anything about my mother.
 I've been told she was sick a lot, but that's about all I know. I guess she got really bad after she gave birth to me.
 Then she died when I was about three years old.
 Daddy used to say all the time that my mom and I were a whole lot like each other.
 But still I really have a hard time picturing her.
 Ah, I don't want you to think that I'm depressed and lonely all the time,
 My sister's always been like a mother to me and we both had Dad, so it was okay.
Except Hijiri didn't have anyone to be a mom for her.
 I guess I didn't realize how unfair that was.
 It must've been really difficult to be a mother when... she never had one herself.
 Dad was around, but he was always busy with this clinic.
 And... and then he got sick too.
 It was like... the only thing I could do was sit by and watch.
 Even now, I watch Hijiri work so hard and take care of me, but I... I can't... really help her out, you know?

Yukito:
 Hey, don't feel bad.
 I'm not much help to her either.

Kano:
 Oh, that's not true, not at all.
 If I... if I ever do get to use my magic, I think... I'd like to see my mom again.
 I'd like to apologize for all sorts of things.

Yukito:
 Why not try thanking her instead of apologizing?


Kano:
 Huh?


Yukito:
 When you think about it, you're only here because of her sacrifices.
 If somebody said to me 'I'm sorry that you gave birth to me', I don't know, I think I'd be pretty upset.

Kano:
 I guess so... Then I'll have to thank her.
 You haven't told me about your mom.
 What's she like?

Yukito:
 Well, she's... a long time ago she went to the same place as your mom, so she's not around either.

Kano:
 Oh, I understand....

Yukito:
 My mother spent her life searching for someone called the girl in the sky.

Kano:
Looking for who?

Yukito:
 You see, Mom always said that somewhere beyond the sky is a girl with wings, and finding her became a kind of obsession.
 And now, I'm looking for her too.

Kano:
 Hmmm... well, after I get my magic powers and learn to fly, I promise I'll go up there and find her for you.


now you mention it : そういえば = used to say that you had not thought about something until the speaker mentioned it
the only thing I could do was sit back and watch: 主語に doが入っている場合はis (to) doのtoを省ける。around :adv. 補語として使うとexitingの意味を持つ。副詞(adv.)だが、この用法なら形容詞(adj.)と機能は同等。



Yukito:
 Hey, I'm home.

Haruko:
You're awfully late.

Yukito:
 Where's Misuzu?

Haruko:
 She said she wasn't feeling too well earlier, and decided to go to bed.
 I guess she's probably still in her room.

Yukito:
 Shouldn't you go check on her or something?

Haruko:
 How is she gonna get any rest, if I'm buggin' her?

Yukito:
Maybe she'll find it comforting to have her mom in there.

Haruko:
That's not how our little dysfunctional family works.





Yukito:
 Misuzu?
 I'm coming in.

Misuzu:
Ah...
 Hey, Yukito.

Yukito:
I hear you're not feeling too hot.

Misuzu:
 Yeah, but it isn't really that terrible.

Yukito:
I'm sorry I couldn't be there to pick you up from school this afternoon.

Misuzu:
 It's all right.
 I know you've got other things to take care of.

Yukito:
But, still...
 You sure are crazy about dinosaurs, huh?





Yukito:
 So, what's the deal with her obsession with dinosaurs?


Haruko:
 No idea.
 She's had a thing for 'em since she was little.


Yukito:
 You don't know her very well, do you?
 Isn't that kind of sad?

 You know, yesterday was her birthday.
 Did you forget, or just blow it off?


Haruko:
 Hey, you ever notice anything weird about her during the day?


Yukito:
 Isn't she always doing weird stuff?


Haruko:
 No, that's not what I mean.
 Ah, if there's nothing you've noticed, then it's fine.


Yukito:
 What would I notice...?


Haruko:
 Ugh, enough with the gloomy talk.
 It's about time you and I moved on to the main event, baby!
 The erotic confessions corner!


Yukito:
 I don't think so.
Not this time.


Haruko:
 Oh, no no.
 Come on, I know you'll be good at it.


Yukito:
Stop it, you nympho!



Yukito:
 Romantic?

Misuzu:
 Yeah, that's right!
 Because dinosaurs lived and thrived all over this planet for eons.
 But then they went extinct for some reason, they just disappeared and nobody knows why.
 Just thinking about that makes me so sad.

Yukito:
 Hey, you still having those dreams?

Misuzu:
 All the time.
 And lately--this is weird, but my dreams have been going backwards.

Yukito:
 What do you mean?

Misuzu:
 I can't explain it.
 But I... I can sense things in my dreams like the smell of the breeze and how it feels on my skin.
 The way the air moves and the way seasons change.
 And I can sense that I'm going back in time.

Yukito:
 I've never heard of a dream like that before.

Misuzu:
 Hey, Yukito. Do you think that maybe my dreams are trying to take me someplace?



Kano:
 Okay, are you ready? Potato, make sure you stay out of the way, so don't get hit by mistake!

Yukito:
 What in the world's going on here?

Hijiri:
 This is what she wanted to do today.

Yukito:
 Don't you think you're spoiling her a bit?

Kano
 And... here I go!
 See you tomorrow! Bye Bye!


eon : aeonとも綴る。an extremely long period of time



Misuzu:
 I guess nobody's here...

Yukito:
 I'm not gonna make any money in this park.

Michiru:
 Yukito-!

Misuzu:
 Yukito!

Yukito:
 Just what is your freakin' problem?!

Michiru:
 Why did you stand us up yesterday?


Yukito:
 Heh?


Michiru:
 Look, we waited for hours.
 When you didn't come, it made Minagi sad.

Minagi:
 It's all right, Michiru, really.

Michiru:
 Don't be polite just to save his feelings!

Yukito:
 I apologize.
 I sort of got distracted yesterday.

Michiru:
 To make up for it, you have to live here from now on!

Yukito:
 What?
 I don't get you, Kid.
 First time we met, you acted like you were personally gonna run me out of town, remember?

Michiru:
 Ooh...!
 Stop changing the subject!
 Oh, it's alive! Oh...

 Oh, I just can't tell how you do it.

Yukito:
 Good, huh?

Misuzu:
 It really is amazing, isn't it.

Minagi:
 You have a wonderful talent, Mr. Kunisaki and I would like to applaud you if that's okay.


Yukito:
 Mmhmm,


Minagi:
 Applause, clap, clap, clap...


Yukito:
 It's not really a talent.
 It's just telekinetic ability.

Minagi:
 Telekinetic ability?
 There are so many wonders in this world we can't comprehend.
 I have another special gift for you.
 Here.
 Mr. Kunisaki?
 Did you say a girl with wings?

Yukito:
 Yeah, I'm looking for the girl my mother spent her entire life searching for.
 But that seems pretty silly.

Minagi:
 When I was little, one of my favorite things was a picture book with a story kind of like that.

Yukito:
 Really?

Michiru:
 I remember it very clearly.
 There was a girl with pure white wings on her back.
 When I was a little girl, I used to daydream about flying through the sky with her... as high as we could go.
 So I don't think it's silly at all.
 I mean, the whole reason you've been traveling around in the first place is to look for this girl in the sky, right?
 Everyone has something that keeps them going through even the darkest, saddest times of their lives.
 I can tell already the stars are going to beautiful again tonight.

Michiru:
 Minagi!
 I need your help.
 I don't know what I'm doing wrong here.

Minagi:
 All right, I'm coming, Michiru.

Yukito:
 Something that keeps them going...

Misuzu:
 There, I'm finally finished with all my homework.

Misuzu:
 Yukito!

Yukito:
 Hm?

Misuzu:
 Let's play cards! Wanna? Please!

Yukito:
 Why do you wanna play all of a sudden?

Misuzu:
 It's not sudden.
 I've always wanted to play cards with you.
 We've just been busy doing other stuff.

Yukito:
 Just play solitaire.
 We come from a planet on the other side of a distant galaxy.

Misuzu:
 Don't you wanna play cards?
 Oh, come on, it'll be fun.
 I wanna play cards.
 You might even beat me.

Hijiri:
 Misuzu, are you here?
 Kano's gone missing again.
 Have you seen her at all today?

Yukito:
 What about the shrine?

Hijiri:
 I've already looked there.
 I'll try the school next.
 You guys, just keep going that way.

Yukito:
 Got it.

Misuzu:
 Do you have any idea where we should look for her?

Yukito:
 No. We'll just cover as much ground as we can.

Yukito:
 Kano!

Misuzu:
 Kano!

Potato:
Piko! Piko!

Yukito:
 Potato!

Misuzu:
 I think he might be trying to get us to follow him.

Yukito:
 The shrine again!

Misuzu:
 Miss Kirishima said that she already looked here.

Yukito:
 Kano! Hey, are you all right?

Kano:
 Sacrifice her... My only treasure...

Yukito:
 Kano?

Kano:
 I would rather... with my own hands...

Yukito:
 Hey, Kano!
