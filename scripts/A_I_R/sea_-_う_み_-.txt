  Misuzu:
 Hey Sky, I just had a dream about my favorite person in the world.
 Yukito came back to me.
I wasn't sure that he would, but he did come back to me in the end, didn't he?
 And in the dream, he said something to me that I'm always going to cherish.
 Now I know, I can't just give up.

 I wanna try.
 Even if I'm all by myself.



Misuzu:
 I want... to be outside today.
 Even though it hurts to walk.
 I'll go as far as I can.

 Let's rest here for a bit.
 Hmm... I guess I'll have my usual; the weird juice.

Sky:
 Wait, it's her.
 The one who lived with us until recently.
 Who is she?
 I seem to remember her vaguely but I... I can't place it.

Haruko:
 So, that freeloader left, eh?
 Well, he'll be back when he figures out he doesn't have anyone else to take care of him.
 I bet you'll never guess what I've been up to.
 I've been working to make sure you can stay here with me forever.
 'Cause, you know, you're not really my kid.
 Any day you could be taken by the Tachibana family.
 That's why I couldn't get too close to you, even though we lived together.
 I figured if I started thinking of you as my own, it'd just be harder to give you up.
 I kept trying to prepare myself for the day someone would come take you away from me.
 It was all for nothing.
 I fell in love with you anyway.
 But, I'm not gonna lie to myself anymore.
 I made up my mind that I was gonna adopt you for real.
 So I staged a good old-fashioned tantrum in front of the Tachibana house and they finally decided to let me keep you.

Misuzu:
 You didn't have to do that.

Haruko:
 Huh?

Misuzu:
 You see, I decided I need to be alone, so that I won't be a burden on anybody.

Haruko:
Misuzu! Misuzu, what's wrong?!
 Misuzu!

Haruko:
Why didn't you let me know you were feeling that bad?
 I thought that you just had a cold or something.
 So you said... your legs won't move?
 We'll go to the doctor.
 We'll find out what's the matter.
 Oh, I know! That female doctor at the clinic!
 She'll be able to figure out what's wrong.

Misuzu:
No doctor will be able to cure me.

Haruko:
What?

Misuzu:
Yukito and I figured out what was happening.
 There's another me in the sky.
 She's a girl like me and she's burdened by something.
 That's why I can't ever get close to people.
 That's why I keep getting sicker and now my body won't move.

Haruko:
 You sure that isn't just a nightmare you had, Misuzu?

Misuzu:
 Yeah, so listen to me.
 I think that we should keep living like we were before without getting too close to each other.

Haruko:
Huh?

Misuzu:
 Let's just keep living separate lives.
 I'll do the best I can on my own.

Haruko:
 Why would you say something like that?
 You know I never wanted to leave you alone all these years, right?
 You're the boss.
 If you don't wanna see a doctor, then I'm not gonna make you go.
 But I'm... I'm gonna take care of you.
 For God's sake, you can't even move!
 If we stay together, we'll both be stronger in the end.
 Okay, Misuzu?



Haruko:
 So how is it? Any good?
 Really? I'm sorry. But I guess I'll just get it right next time, huh?

Misuzu:
 I don't want it.
 I'm sorry, but you're not the best cook in the world.

Haruko:
 Oh, I know I'm not very good.
 But lots of kids grow up eating the nasty things their parents make.

 I'm sorry, I didn't know it was bad enough to make you cry!

Misuzu:
 It's not about the food.
 When you start to care about me, you're gonna get sick too, and I don't want that.

Haruko:
 Huh? Guess that was another part of your nightmare?
 Listen up, Misuzu.
 I couldn't care less if I got sick.
 In fact, if I ever got sick, I think... I'd be happy.
 Because that would mean that you and I had gotten close enough to really affect each other, right?

Haruko:
 Here. Eat something.

Misuzu:
 Mmm...
It tastes good.
 Thank you!

Haruko:
 What is it?



Haruko:
 Well, how short do you want it?

Misuzu:
 I'll let you decide.

Haruko:
 Hmm... Well, let me think for a second what length would be most flattering on you.

Misuzu:
 You have a lot more wrinkles than I remember.

Haruko;
 Looks like you're getting a crew cut.

Misuzu:
 Just kidding. You've always looked really young.
 I remember that one time you came to the open house at my school, and all the other mothers looked really old and worn out, but not you.

Haruko:
 You answered one of the questions wrong, and then you started to cry.

Misuzu:
 Mmhmm.
I wanted to show off 'cause you were watching.
 So I raised my hand even though I didn't know the answer.
 And then you came over and gave me a whack in front of everybody there.

Haruko:
 You did that "gao" thing I told you not to do.
 It's called disciplining your child.

Misuzu:
 That's right.
 And thanks to you, I've grown up to be a fine young lady.

Haruko:
It's true. You have grown up quite a bit.
 And I hardly ever hear you say that crap anymore anyway.

Haruko:
 Misuzu. Misuzu?
 Well. It's actually easier this way.

 I guess I'll just have to even them out.
 Now the other side is shorter, I'm gonna have to cut even more off!
God, God!

 I did manage to get it pretty even in the end.
 But still...

Misuzu:
Hmm? Huh...?
My goodness! You really did cut it short.

Haruko:
 I am so sorry.

Misuzu:
It's like... it's like I'm back to being a little girl all over again... like I'm Mommy's little girl.

Haruko:
 That's right. I have a wonderful idea, Misuzu.
 Why don't the two of us start from the beginning?

Misuzu:
 Mmhmm.
From now on, we're starting all over.

Haruko:
Yeah... 




Misuzu:
 Hey, the summer festival--isn't that happening soon?

Haruko:
 Oh yeah, I forgot all about that.

Misuzu:
 I'd like to go there with you this year, Mom.

Haruko:
 That sounds great.
 I'd love to go with you.

Misuzu:
 And then maybe, do you think we could go to the beach together?
 I've never been there with you and I really wanna go.

Haruko:
 There sure are a lot of places you're looking to visit around here, aren't there?

Misuzu:
 Yeah. I want to do all kinds of fun things with you, Mom.
 'Cause we never have.

Haruko:
 Yeah. And I wanna spend more time with you, too.
 We're gonna fill up your picture diary with all kinds of fun things.

Misuzu:
 Hey ya. You know what?

Haruko:
 Hmm?

Misuzu:
 You know what I'm always gonna remember?
 I'm always gonna remember your smile.
 I know that.
 I'll never forget it.
 I swear it, Mom.

Haruko:
 Wait, what on earth are you talking about?
 You don't have to remember it, 'cause I'm right here.



Haruko:
 Hey, what are you doing up before me?
 What's the matter?
 Are you still sleepy, honey?

Misuzu:
 Who are you?

Haruko:
Huh?

Misuzu:
 Who are you and why are you here?

Haruko:
 You can't have forgotten!
 You promised you'd be strong for your mom, remember?

Misuzu:
 My mom?

Haruko:
 That's right! That's me.

Misuzu:
 My mom went really far away.

Haruko:
 Hey, you can't remember that, and not remember me?
 I'm here to take care of you, just like your real mother would've.

 Doesn't matter. I'm gonna get you back somehow.
 Until you accept me as your mom again, you can just call me your aunt.




Haruko:
 Misuzu! Take a look at what I've borrowed for you.
 You see? Now you can go out whenever you want.

Misuzu:
 But it hurts too much for me to walk.

Haruko:
 I know! And that's why I got you a wheelchair.
 Come on! I'll give you a little push.

Misuzu:
 I think I'd rather just sit here and play cards by myself. Thanks.

Haruko:
 Hey, come on! Let's play together!
 Don't you wanna be in the sun instead of some stuffy house?
 There are lots of things way more fun than cards.

Misuzu:
The wind, it's blowing.

Haruko:
 You're right, it is.

Misuzu:
 And the sun is shining down so brightly.

Haruko:
 That's true too.

Misuzu:
 Cicadas, sure do buzz a lot.

Haruko:
 Tell me something I don't know, kid.

Misuzu:
 Oh, it feels so good to be out here.

Haruko:
 Does it? I'm so glad.


Keisuke:
What the hell is going on here?

Haruko:
 Keisuke?

Misuzu:
 Who is he?

Keisuke:
Misuzu, I'm your father and I want you back.

Misuzu:
 Huh?

-- Eyecatch --

Keisuke:
As you know, she can't live if she's surrounded by too many people.
You live in a quiet little town, that's why I thought it was best for you to keep her.
But maybe I was wrong.

Haruko:
Well I've got news for you.
 Misuzu is officially mine now.
 I got permission from your parents to adopt her.

Keisuke:
But she is my daughter. Mine and Ikuko's both.

Haruko:
 You gave her to me because she got in the way, but now ten years later, you have a right to her?
 You think I've just been keeping her for your convenience?

Keisuke:
You honestly expect me to leave her with you when it's clear she's wasting away?

Haruko:
Well you didn't have a problem with leaving her before, now you suddenly care?

Misuzu:
 Aunt Haruko... is scary...

Haruko:
 I'm sorry for yelling, Misuzu.

Keisuke:
"Aunt Haruko," huh?

Haruko:
 No! It's not what you think.
 Just a bit earlier, she was calling me "Mom," I swear!

Keisuke:
Come on, it's time to go, Misuzu.
Say "thank you" to your aunt, and we'll be on our way.
Come on, where's your "thank you"?

Misuzu:
 Thank you!

Haruko:
 No, you can't!
 Please, I'm begging you.
 Don't take Misuzu away from me.
 This isn't because of anything that she has done, it's because of us!
 But I'm the one who decided to stay with her!
 You just wanna swoop in after ten years and take her because you think I'm not good enough?
 Well, that's not fair to her and it's not fair to me!

Keisuke:
Haruko.

Haruko:
 I may not be the smartest person in the world, and I may not be able to talk as good as you.
 But I do know one thing for sure.
 I know that all I really want is to stay with Misuzu and to keep her safe.
 I want that more than you could even pretend to!

Keisuke:
Let's ask her what she wants.
Misuzu, do you want to stay here with your aunt, or come back home with me?

Misuzu:
 With you?

Keisuke:
That's right. You could live with your father, or you can stay here.

Haruko:
 Keisuke! Keisuke, no, wait! Three days! Just give me three days!
 If, after three days, she says she doesn't wanna stay with me anymore, then okay, you can take Misuzu away from me.
 I just need a little more time with her before she has to decide.
 I'm begging you. Keisuke, please...

Keisuke:
Three days...


Haruko:
 Just three days... can I build a whole mother-child relationship in that time?
 You sure love dinosaurs.
 Even got little dinosaurs all over that deck of cards, huh?

Misuzu:
 This one's a Maiasaura.
 That name means "good-mother lizard."

Haruko:
 Really?
 That sounds kinda like me.

Misuzu:
 This one's a Velociraptor.
 That means "fast-moving thief."

Haruko:
 Ha! That "Veloci-whatever" thing sounds like Keisuke!
 I wonder which one of us is really the thief though...



Misuzu:
 It's hot.

Haruko:
 I know.
 But we're gonna be at the beach in a couple of minutes.
 I bet it'll be a lot cooler down there.
 Then we can have a little picnic.
I packed a lunch for us.

Misuzu:
 But I'm hot.
 I wanna go home.

Haruko:
 Hey, don't say that.
 You don't want our lunch to go to waste, do you?

Misuzu:
I wanna go home!

Haruko:
 But I have some egg rolls for you.
 I made them because you said that's what you wanted.
 Let's just have our picnic first.

Misuzu:
 No.

Haruko:
 You mean you really wanna go home now?

Misuzu:
 I do.

Haruko:
 But what am I supposed to do with the food if we just go home?

Misuzu:
 I don't know.

Haruko:
 ...Fine then.
Why don't you just do whatever you want, you spoiled brat!
And since you don't care about anyone else, find your own way home!

Misuzu:
 It's hot.
 I'm getting dizzy.
Aah!


Haruko:
 Misuzu...
 Let's go home... let's go home.



Haruko:
 I guess I should've figured it out a long time ago.
 I've been fooling myself thinking I could be somebody's mother.
 That's all there is to it.
 How could I have just left her here like that?

Misuzu:
 Aaaah!

Haruko:
 Misuzu, are you all right?

Misuzu:
 Catch it!
 The cicada. Catch it.

Haruko:
Yeah, I'll catch it! I'm the baddest cicada catcher in the whole world!

Misuzu:
 The baddest cicada catcher?

Haruko:
 Oh yeah. You better believe I'm the best friend that a scaredy-cat like you's got!

Misuzu:
 Uh-huh.

 There he is! Got him!
 Now I guess... you can get back to playing in peace.

Misuzu:
Mmhmm.

Haruko:
 Okay?
 I'll leave you to it then.

 Does this mean... Does this mean that you want your auntie to stay?

Misuzu:
 Mmhmm!

Haruko:
 That's it.
 I'm not gonna ask for anything else.
 I'll be happy if I can just spend the day with her.
 That's all I really want.
 It may just have to be enough.



Haruko:
 This is the day I told Keisuke.
 That jerk, he's gonna ask for you again.
 Then you'll... you'll probably say you wanna go with him.
 You'll probably say... you don't wanna stay with me anymore.
 Summer vacation's not over yet.
 But it looks like ours is ending today, huh?



Keisuke:
Are you sure?

Haruko:
 I am. Yeah. Positive.

Keisuke:
I see.

Haruko:
 But... Keisuke. There's one last place I wanna take her before you leave.
 I just need half an hour.

 Misuzu, you see that?
 It's the ocean, hon. 〈話〉 hon 〔親しい人への呼び掛けに用いる〕あなた、君◆【語源】honeyの短縮形
 Isn't it beautiful?
 It seems so far away. Look how long it took us to finally get here.
 Now it seems like such a waste, doesn't it?
 We coulda come down here and enjoyed this view anytime we wanted.
 I can't think of what I was doing instead.
 Pretty sad.

Keisuke:
Are you ready?

Haruko:
 She's pretty heavy.
 She's grown up a lot since the last time you carried her.

Keisuke:
It's because of you that she's grown up so well.
I'm well aware of that.
Thanks, Haruko.

Haruko:
 Oh, she'll wanna hold on to this.
 That's her favorite stuffed animal.
 As long as she's got it near by, she should be able to sleep.
 And if she's still restless, then you can give her this!
 It's her favorite juice.
 Works every time.

Keisuke:
Understood.
Well, thanks again.

Haruko:
 Well, shouldn't you be going too?
 He's taking your princess away.

 Oh! What does he think he's doing?!



Misuzu:
 MOMMY!!
Owwy...

Haruko:
 Misuzu!

 That's right. I'm your mommy and I love you, Misuzu.

Misuzu:
 Mommy...

Sky:
 After that, they talked for a long time in the sunset.

Keisuke:
I've got the name of a really good doctor.
And I'd like him to check on her, okay?

Sky:
 I finally realized... this person who's been with Misuzu the whole time... it was her mother after all.
