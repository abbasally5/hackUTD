  Yukito:
It might be this... other you that I've been looking for.
Somewhere beyond the sky is a girl with wings.
 She's been there forever... and is still there, even now.
 Somewhere in the atmosphere, she continues to spread her wings and catch the wind.
 My mother died before she could give me any details on how to find this girl in the sky.
 Since then, my only companions have been my mother's stories and this little guy here, the puppet she taught me to use.

Misuzu:
But that girl your mother was looking for... is she the same one that you're trying to find?

Yukito:
Look. You're probably not the one I'm looking for.
A lot of people dream of flying.

Misuzu:
That girl in the sky--she can fly, can't she?

Yukito:
Yeah. And what are my chances of finding her...?

Misuzu:
Wow. That would be pretty great, to have wings!

-- OP --


Haruko:
Hey, I'm home! And I brought a present for you, Freeloader!

 Misuzu:
Huh? Is that thing supposed to be a sloth?

Haruko:
I figured this one's cuter than that dirty little rag doll of yours.
 And maybe this way, you can actually make some money and get the heck outta my house!

 Misuzu:
He is pretty cute, I guess.

Yukito:
Mmm...

Haruko:
Hahahaha!
There is nothing in the world like a good stiff drink after work, huh?
It really makes you feel like there's a reason to go on living, you know?
 Okay, hobo, tonight our topic of discussion will be "touching memories that bring a tear to the eye."

 Yukito:
Why do I have to be your entertainment?

 Haruko:
Hey, you're not falling asleep on us, are you, Misuzu?

 Misuzu:
No, I'm fine.

 Haruko:
Oh, come over and sit on my lap, and you can fall asleep here.

 Misuzu:
No, thanks. That's okay. I'm not a little kid anymore.
I think I'm just gonna go to bed. Nice to meet you.
 Good night everybody.

 Haruko:
Okay. Hmm...
Well, I don't know what's gotten into her all of a sudden.

 Yukito:
Does she usually fall asleep in your lap?

 Haruko:
Man, you really ask some dumb questions.
Like, c'mon, do you honestly think she'd cuddle with someone as screwed-up as I am?

 She didn't do that "gao" thing again today, did she?

 Yukito:
Yeah. I whacked her each time she did it.

 Haruko:
That little girl. 
When she was younger, for some reason, she got it into her head that baby chicks were dinosaur babies.
And so, we went to a summer fair one time, she saw all the little chicks there, and she begged me and begged me to buy her one.
But we were so poor at that point, I had to tell her we couldn't afford it.
 And ever since we left the fair that day, she's been saying "Gao" for every stupid little thing.
 You know, I'm not cut out to be a parent.
 I shoulda stayed alone.
 Besides, if you haven't noticed, that kid is a little off.

 Yukito:
Is she?

 Haruko:
But I gotta say, she does seem to be a lot more cheerful now that you've been here.
So maybe you should think about sticking around for a while.
 'Cause God knows she doesn't need me much anymore.



Yukito:
Okay, kids! It's time for a fun puppet show! 

Kids:
--Is it supposed to be nuts?
--That's the creepiest thing ever.
--Looks like I'm probably gonna have nightmares tonight.
--Yeah, let's get outta here, dudes.

Yukito:
Hey, you're supposed to leave me some money!
 You're the worst stinkin' puppet ever!
 What are you doing here? You're Potato, right?
 What on earth are you trying...?

 Hijiri:
How is your daughter doing? Well I hope.

lady:
Oh, yes. She's so easy going.
She says white rice is her favorite--she asks for seconds and thirds.
So I enjoy cooking for her.

Hijiri:
 Tell her to be careful. She doesn't wanna get an upset stomach.

 lady:
I'll tell her that. See you next time.

 Hijiri:
 All right, you have a reason for sitting in front of my place of business all day?

 Yukito:
Uh, I guess it's time we be moving...

 Hijiri:
 Oh oh oh, not so fast, Mister.
 Hey, what have you done to Potato? He's having a fit.

 Yukito:
You mean you know this thing too?

 Kano:
Hey, Yukito!
So, like, uh, what're you and my big sister talking about, huh?

 Wow, that's amazing! He's really good, isn't he?
 It looks like Potato's gonna be the president of your fan club, Yukito.

 Hijiri:
 You said that your name is Yukito Kunisaki, right?
 Well, I've gotta admit your technique is admirable, but I don't think you're gonna make much money in this town with ... that.

 Yukito:
Look, I've been everywhere doing this trick and performing as long as I can remember, so if anyone's an expert, it's me.

 Kano:

How did I guess not?

 Hijiri:
 You wouldn't be interested in working part-time here at the clinic, would you?
 My name is Hijiri Kirishima. Since our parents died, I've been the only doctor in this town.
 And to tell you the truth, I've been looking for someone to do odd jobs around here.

 Yukito:
Man, I hate bamboo.

 Kano:
How fun! I can't believe it! I've always wanted to try this and now I am.

 Yukito:
Why're you having flowing noodles for lunch?

Hijiri:
In this household, if Kano asks for flowing noodles, then we're having flowing noodles.


Kano:

Uh-huh. Yup!

Yukito:
I seem to be at quite a disadvantage sitting all the way down here.

 Hijiri:
What? .
 A little girl can't possibly compete with a full-grown man, can she?

 So, will you be back around the same time tomorrow then?

 Yukito:
I'll need to know how much you're paying me before I commit anything.

 Hijiri:
How about I throw in the added benefit that you can perform your puppet show in front of the clinic after work each day?



 Kano:
Today was so much fun! Please say you'll come and play with us again tomorrow!
 Bye-bye! See ya! Adios! Sayonara! Auf Wiedersehen!

 Yukito:
I have a bad feeling about this...


Yukito:
This place is like totally empty!
It must not have any problems with traffic...

lady:
Oh, I'm so sorry!

Yukito:
No, no. It's my fault.

lady:
Thanks. I really appreciate you helping me with those.

Yukito:
 Hey, don't mention it.
 I should have been paying more attention to where I was going.
 But this sure is a lot of rice.

 lady:
Yeah well, my daughter really loves rice.

 Thanks again for all your help.
 I don't have very much, but I'd like to give you something.

 Yukito:
Nah, that's okay.
 I didn't offer because I wanted to ...

 lady:
I won't hear any protest, because it's not much.
 But here. Take this.

 Yukito:
Doesn't anyone use cash for currency in this stupid place?
 And what kinda girl likes rice so much she'll eat twenty pounds of it a week?

I guess Misuzu's running late...


Girl:
Oh, look at the cute little sloth!
Wow!
He is so adorable!
Mmm-mmm!

Yukito:
It's like a mini version of Misuzu.
 Hmm...

Yukito:
 Shouldn't you be with your parents or something?

Girl:
Hmm?

Yukito:
 Now don't tell me you don't know where your parents are.

Girl:
Hm?

Yukito:
 How about a cracker?

Girl:
It is cute and it is yummy.

Yukito:
It can only be cute or yummy.
 It can't be both.

Girl:
But it tastes so yummy and cute!

Misuzu:
 Hey, Yukito!
 Where'd that little girl come from?

Yukito:
 I think she might be lost.

Misuzu:
 Hey there. What's your name?

Girl:
I'm six!

Yukito:
 Well that's a terrible name.

Misuzu:
 If you can't say something nice, Yukito.
 Six is how old you are.
 I want you to tell me what your name is.

Girl:
I'm Saika Shino. I'm six!

Misuzu:
 Saika Shino...

Girl:
Bye-bye!

Misuzu:
 Bye-bye now!

Misuzu:
 I heard that girl's gonna have to be put in a hospital.

Yukito:
 She's sick? Is it bad?

Misuzu:
 No, I don't think it's supposed be serious.
 And besides, she said the sloth is her friend now, and that she's gonna be all right.

Yukito:
 Oh... okay then.



Misuzu:
 I had a dream last night.

Yukito:
 Yeah, I have dreams all the time.

Misuzu:
 This was a dream... about the sky.
 I was in the sky in a world I've never seen before, and never could have imagined.
 You see, when you're sitting on the ground like we are, you can only look up, and the clouds are always above you.
 But in my dream it was totally different.
 The clouds were under my feet.
 I could see the blue of the ocean below them.
 But I couldn't tell how far down the water was because everything went on forever, like the whole world was stretching out to infinity.

Yukito:
 Hey... do you remember... if you had wings in your dream?

Misuzu:
 Hmm?
I don't know. I didn't notice.

Yukito:
 You probably shouldn't go around telling people about your dreams and stuff.

Misuzu:
 Don't worry, you're the only one I've told, Yukito

-- Eyecatch --

Misuzu:
 Wow! That looks really good on you.

Yukito:
Is there anything else I can wear?

Misuzu:
 All of my other shirts would be way too small for you.
 It even smells nice.

Yukito:
 What's that supposed to be?

Hijiri:
 It's lunch, silly. And I've outdone myself, so it's going to be extra-delicious today.

Yukito:
 Delicious lunch?!
 Um, you really made this especially...?

Hijiri:
 Deliver it to Kano for me, will you?
 Is something the matter?

Yukito:
 No, of course not.

Hijiri:
 Kano is taking care of all the animals at her school today.
 And if one bite of that lunch doesn't make it to her at school...

Yukito:
 Hey, I got it, I got it!
 Put the scalpel away!

Schoolgirl #1:
I got a B on my geometry test.
I'm so excited.

Schoolgirl #2:
Wow! That's amazing!

Yukito:
There're quite a few students around.
 I guess they're here for summer school or the club activities or some.

Potato:
Piko.

Yukito:
 I might actually draw a real crowd with all these kids around.

Yukito:
 Now listen, if you wanna cheer, don't hold back, baby!
 Yeah, everybody!

Everybody:
Yeah! Yukito rules the universe!

Yukito:
 Love and peace!

Everybody:
Yukito's the greatest!
We love you!

Yukito:
 Yeah, right, okay, now back to reality.

Potato:
Piko.

Yukito:
 You know, Potato, if I take a little freak like you into the school, the place will be thrown into a panic.

Yukito:
 Now be a good boy and stay here till I get back.

Potato:
Piko.

Yukito:
 Do you think you ladies could answer a question for me?

Nayuki:
 Okay.

Yukito:
 I'm here to deliver Kano Kirishima's lunch, but I don't know where to find her.
 Any idea where she would be?

Ayu:
Kano, huh?

Nayuki:
I think she might still be in the nurse's office.

Yukito:
 Nurse's office?

Makoto:
No, no, she said she wanted to get some air so she was going up to the roof.

Ayu:
She was mumbling something earlier, and then she just sorta collapsed.
 I think maybe she got a little lightheaded, you know?


Kano:
That's sweet.
 You were really worried about me, weren't you?

Yukito:
Are you sure you're feeling well enough to stay here?

Kano:
 Oh, stop overreacting!
 I just got a little bit dizzy, is all. It's no big deal.

Yukito:
Whatever you say.

Kano:
 The sky is really clear today, huh?

Yukito:
Mmhmm.

Kano:
Can you fly through the air like a bird, Yukito?

Yukito:
Of course not.
 What kind of question is that?

Kano:
 But you move your puppet without touching it.

Yukito:
That has nothing to do with anything.
 Didn't you ask me whether or not I wished I could do magic and stuff when I was a little kid?

Kano:
Yeah!
 And you didn't answer.
 I only asked because I know how to do magic, you see.
 Well, that's not entirely true 'cause I can't use my power till I grow up.
 But I've totally already decided exactly what I'm gonna do the first time I get to use them.

Yukito:
What are you gonna do?

Kano:
 That`s a secret!
 But I can tell you what the second thing is that I'm gonna do.

Yukito:
I don't really wanna hear about it.

Kano:
 No!
 You have to hear it!
 Because if you don't listen, it's gonna claw its way out of my belly and turn into a monster so ginormous no one in the world will be able to defeat it and all of humanity would be doomed.

Yukito:
And that would put the earth in grave danger, is that what you're saying?

Kano:
 That's right!
 Do it for the earth.
 It's a moral imperative.

Yukito:
Well, for the sake of mankind, what's the second thing?

Kano:
 Are you ready for it?
 I want to fly through the sky.


Yukito:
 Magic to fly through the sky, huh?

Michiru:
 Hey!
 Look out, Yukito!
 Ha-! yahahaha!

Yukito:
 Quit attacking me, you little spaz!

Michiru:
 What are you so upset about?
 What's the matter, a little girl too much for you to handle?

Yukito:
 Oh, shut up!

Michiru:
 You could've warned me...
 Ew! This is the filthiest thing I've ever seen!

Yukito:
 Hey, that's mine.

Michiru:
 What's a shame!
 Poor little guy, you shouldn't have to suffer just 'cause your master's too stupid to take care of you?

Yukito:
 Don't talk to him like that!

Michiru:
 Don't worry, I'm gonna take you away from all this, so he'll never neglect you again.
 So long, sucker!

Yukito:
Hey! Wait a minute!

Michiru:
 You're too slow!

Yukito:
 Don't you... wave your butt at me!

 Hey! Where do you think you're going?!

Michiru:
 Catch me if you can, dandy!

Yukito:
 Okay, that's enough! Get back here!



Michiru:
 Hey Minagi!
 You're lucky Minagi can fix just about anything with a needle and a thread.
 Shouldn't you be thankin' me by now?

Yukito:
 I would hold my breath if I were you!

Minagi:
 There. It's as good as new.

Michiru:
 Aah, look at how cute he is!

Yukito:
He really does look better.

Minagi:
 Ahem, I guess this little puppet must be very important to you.
 Since you carry it around with you all the time.

Yukito:
 Yeah, I guess.

Minagi:
 It's the physical manifestation of a memory.
 I'm right, aren't I?

Yukito:
 What a question.
 But, yeah, I s'pose...

Michiru:
 Your belly's got a lot to say.

Yukito:
 I don't wanna hear it!

Minagi:
 Why don't you take this coupon for some rice?
 I don't think it's right for people to go hungry.



Misuzu:
 Miss Tohno's pretty incredible.
 Not only is she good at her school work, but she's good at sewing things back together too.

Yukito:
 Yeah, so you think you wanna tell me where you're taking me now?

Misuzu:
 It's a place where lots of people gather.
 If you put on your puppet show there, you could have a huge crowd in no time.
 ...Hey, it's Mom.

Yukito:
 So, what does Haruko do for a living anyway?

Misuzu:
 It's a secret.
 I wonder if she went to say a prayer at the shrine or something.

Yukito:
 Is there a shrine?

Misuzu:
 Yup, that's where we're headed right now.



Yukito:
 There's nobody here!

Misuzu:
 Sure it's empty now, but the summer festival is coming and this place'll be totally full of people, including lots of kids from town.

Yukito:
 Oh man, I don't know if I wanna deal with those smart-mouth kids from town again.

Misuzu:
 Oh, don't go yet!

Yukito:
 You wanna stay?

Misuzu:
It's just that...I mean since we're already here and all, I was hoping we could play a little before we went home.
 I wanna play hide-and-seek.


Yukito:
Wha?!


Misuzu:
 Oh c'mon, I wanna play hide-and-seek with you, Yukito.

Yukito:
 Don't you think we're a bit old for that?

Misuzu:
 Well then, let's go catch bugs, okay?
 Gao...
 Oh, fish! Hey, you wanna catch some fish with me?

Yukito:
 You don't even care what we do, do ya?

Misuzu:
All I know is it's summer vacation, so I wanna play as much as I can.

Yukito:
 Are you okay, Misuzu?!
That's it! I'm leaving! You hear me, young lady?!

Misuzu:
 Gotcha!

Yukito:
 Oh, by the way, do you still think that baby chicks grow up to be dinosaurs, Misuzu?

Misuzu:
 Um, yeah, I know, chicks grow up to be chickens, I get it now.
 Actually, what I really wanted wasn't a chick or a baby dinosaur at all.

Yukito:
 But... Haruko said that you cried all day long.

Misuzu:
 If she had bought me anything, I would've been happy with it, no matter what it was.

Misuzu:
 That was really fun!

Yukito:
 Well, I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.

Misuzu:
 I don't think I've ever had such a good time on my birthday in my entire life.

Yukito:
 Today isn't your birthday, is it?

Misuzu:
 Yeah?

Yukito:
 But, Misuzu, that's really important.
 Why didn't you tell me before?

Misuzu:
 Why? It isn't really...

Yukito:
 I mean if I'd had any idea, I would have bought you a present or something.

Misuzu:
 But, Yukito...?

Yukito:
 You go on home, okay?

Yukito:
 No one's gonna wanna watch a puppet show this late at night.

A passerby (Keisuke):
 Are you, uh, done for the day?
 Could you maybe do a quick show for me?
 Maybe?
 Hey, that's--that's pretty neat.
 But I don't suppose that kids are interested in this sort of thing, huh?

Yukito:
 It's not really any of your business, is it?

Keisuke:
 You're right. That was rude of me.

Yukito:
 So what's in the box?

Keisuke:
 I went to visit some friends.
 But they weren't home.
 I wanna give it to you--for showing me something so... unusual.

Misuzu:
 This is the best cake I've ever had.

Yukito:
 It was pretty lucky that it just happened to be a birthday cake from that guy, huh?

Misuzu:
 And it's kind of neat that there's the same number of candles I needed for my birthday.
 Sorta makes you wonder whose birthday he bought the cake for in the first place.

Yukito:
 How come your mother didn't remember to buy a cake for you herself?

Misuzu:
 Aww, she's too busy for that.

Misuzu:
 It's so pretty.

Yukito:
 So uh, you satisfied?

Misuzu:
 Mmhmm.
 I'm happy as can be.

Yukito:
 Good. Let's go home.
 I-Is that Kano?
 H-Hey! Kano!
 Is it the shrine?

Misuzu:
 Maybe she went inside already.

Kano:
 Endless, like the stars in the sky.
The trees crawling up the hills, and the infinity of the grasses... growing...

Yukito:
 Kano!
