  Kanna:
How long has it been since you were here last?
 I imagine that you've gotten used to life at the shrine after all this time.
 My robes are splendid, but... I'm as good as a prisoner here.

Ryuya:
A wingèd person acts as a messenger to the gods.
 In times of famine and pestilence, she uses her spiritual powers to communicate directly with the gods and intercede on our behalf.
 I assumed that your living conditions would better reflect that.

Kanna:
Just having wings doesn't make me a messenger to the gods.

Ryuya:
So where're your wings right now?

Kanna:
I keep them hidden.
 I prefer to be seen as any other human.

 What do you think you're doing?!

Ryuya:
I was just seeing if that's where you had your wings hidden.

Kanna:
So what, you just go around touching people all the time without asking? How rude is that!

Uraha:
Hehehe...

Kanna:
What is so funny, Uraha?

Uraha:
I was only laughing because you were so embarrassed by his touch, Lady Kanna.

Ryuya:
You should be more careful--I don't think I'd make a habit of sneaking up on people like that.

Uraha.
I see that you've called Sir Ryuya over again. 
If I didn't know any better, I'd say you've grown extremely fond of him.

Kanna:
What?! I think that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my whole entire life!
 All I'm trying to do is teach some manners to this rude, impolite, shameless, despicable person here!

Uraha:
I wouldn't blame you if you were. 
There's never been anyone else quite like him.

Ryuya:
Hmm...

-- OP --

Uraha:
Lady Kanna, I have something for you.
 I found it earlier today in the back of the wine cellar.
 It is highly unusual to find ice in the height of the summer, you know.
 I thought perhaps you'd like to know about it, so I shaved some off the block and brought it for you to inspect.

Kanna:
Oh, to have ice this late is really rare.

Ryuya:
Yes, it is.
 And breaking into the ice shed is illegal, you know.

Uraha:
Oh goodness gracious me.

Kanna:
That would be just so wrong.

Ryuya:
I should've known you two were up to no good.

Kanna:
Um... Uhh!
 My goodness, it's cold.
 You really should try a little bit, sir Ryuya.

Uraha:
I should remind you that eating the offerings made to Lady Kanna is also illegal.

Ryuya:
I'm in the guard; I'm well aware of the law.

Uraha:
The three of us sitting here together eating ice makes it seem as if...

Ryuya:
...As if we were a desperate family starving in the middle of winter trying to stave off hunger by eating the snow that fell off our house?

Uraha:
Oh, you have such a way with words.
 What a pleasant metaphor!

Kanna:
So, is that it?
 Is that what a family is like?

Ryuya:
Hm?

Uraha:
It's difficult to describe, but it's something like this.

Kanna:
Hey!
 Stop sitting so close to me! What do you think you're doing?

Uraha:
(Weeping)

Kanna:
Wait, wait.
 I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
 You can come back.
 I didn't say for you to come all the way back over here!
 You don't have to go that far away though.


Ryuya:
Well, it seemed like it'd be fun.

Kanna:
I want both of you to get away from me right now!
 What in the world is wrong with you two?

Uraha:
I was only saying that being a family means you can lean on one another.

Ryuya:
So, how long has Kanna been living like this?

Uraha:
Well, since you took your position here, her life has been so much brighter than it was before.

Ryuya:
I don't mean that.
 I was trying to ask you how long she's been living in the shrine.

Uraha:
That I don't know.
 I'm quite new to the shrine myself.
 I've only been here for about half a year.
 All I do know is that she's been held captive in places like this all across the country.
 She's spent her life being moved from shrine to shrine without family, friends or any real companions.


Guard:
Sir Ryuya! I'm here to relieve you for the night.

Ryuya:
Thanks.
 Is there something you'd like to talk about?

Guard:
Well, i-i-it's... You know, ever since we came here, I felt pretty uneasy.
I fear that if we get too close to Lady Kannabi, the gods will rain divine punishment down on us.

Ryuya:
Well I don't think there's any sign that something like that would ever happen.

Guard:
Well, I hear that many despise the wingèd people and are deathly afraid of them.
To be honest, I'll be awfully glad to return to regular duty.

Ryuya:
Is something wrong?
 Kanna?

Kanna:
Sir Ryuya, do you ever have dreams?

Ryuya:
Sometimes, sure.
 What is it?
 Did you have a nightmare?
 Can't get back to sleep?

Kanna:
It was a dream about a long time ago.
 I was a little girl, sitting in the dark, just like I am right now.
 I can't see anything.
 I can't even tell if my own body exists.
 I'm so scared and so lonely.
 Yet I cannot even cry.
 Sometimes though, I see this bright, warm light.
 It's shaped like a person.
 But every time I try to catch up with it, it disappears.
 I've had that same dream not just once, but over and over again.
 Do you have any idea who the person might be?

Ryuya:
Hmm... I wonder if it couldn't be your mother.

Kanna:
 But I...
 I don't remember anything about my mother.

Ryuya:
A dream is just a collection of impressions from your past.
 You can still see things in your dreams even if you don't remember them.

Kanna:
You mean my body just remembers things on its own?
 So then, that means my dream wasn't necessarily... a nightmare.

I want to see her.
 I never thought that being alone could be as difficult as this.

Guard leader:
It has been decided that Kannabi-no-Mikoto shall be transferred to the north shrine in order to say prayers for an abundant harvest there.
Silence while I'm speaking!
At present, her departure is scheduled for the midsummer day of the Ox.

Ryuya:
If I could have permission to speak, Sir, will any of us be following her to her new residence when she leaves?

Guard leader:
We have orders to remain here, and begin cultivating the land in her absence.

Ryuya:
I didn't know until this morning.

Kanna:
I'll have to part ways with you and Uraha soon.
 We won't have many more days together.

Ryuya:
You're all right with that?

Kanna:
Am I all right with what?

Ryuya:
I'm asking if you can accept being separated from Uraha and me.

Kanna:
I'm sure there'll be interesting people at the new shrine.

Ryuya:
You'll have to start all over.

Kanna:
You think I haven't thought of that?
 What kind of spineless weakling do you take me for?

Ryuya:
Hm.

Kanna:
I'll be just fine with that.
 Don't worry about me.
 I've been living alone like this for as long as I can remember.

Ryuya:
Weren't you lonely?
 Didn't you long to see your mother again?

Kanna:
I'm saying that some things will never happen, no matter how hard I wish for them.

Ryuya:
Do you have any idea if...your mother's still alive?

Kanna:
She's alive.
 I know she's alive.
 I'm certain that she's somewhere.
 She's somewhere thinking of me.

Ryuya:
Uraha, did you hear about Ka...

Uraha:
Not right now, I'm busy.

Ryuya:
What are you doing?

Uraha:
Isn't it obvious?
 I'm leaving.

Ryuya:
The only person being transferred is Kanna.
The rest of us are ordered to stay here.

Uraha:
I'm sorry, but I must do this.
 I can't let them do it to her again.
 I'm going to make it so she doesn't have to keep living like this, all alone with nobody who really cares for her...

Ryuya:
Why are you so concerned about whether she comes or goes anyway?

Uraha:
I suppose that I could ask the exact same question of you too, Sir Ryuya.

Ryuya:
Well, I-I guess if I had to come up with an answer, I can't think of anybody in the world who's as much fun to tease.

Uraha:
Hehe...
 I guess that's true, isn't it.

Ryuya:
Hey, Kanna, wake up.

Kanna:
Um?

Ryuya:
How are you?

Kanna:
Ahhh! Intruder! God...!

Ryuya:
Don't make so much noise!
 I need to talk to you.
 Do you wanna see your mother again?

Kanna:
Mm...

Ryuya:
I've sworn never to disobey Kannabi-no-Mikoto's orders no matter what they are.
 Therefore if you order me to help you find your mother, I will risk my life to do it for you.
 Now, as my mistress, will you order me to take you away?

Kanna:
Are you sure that order is agreeable to you?

Ryuya:
It's your choice, not mine.

Kanna:
Um...
 Sir Ryuya, I order you as my guard, guide me to my mother.
 Take me to her.

Ryuya:
Assistant Lieutenant of the outer palace guard, Ryuya, solemnly swears to fulfill Kannabi-no-Mikoto's every command.

Kanna:
Ah.

Uraha:
Lady Kanna.

Ryuya:
Keep moving.

Uraha:
Sir Ryuya, could we possibly take a short break for a moment?
 It doesn't seem they have noticed our absence at the shrine yet.

Ryuya:
Yes, but it's only a matter of time.
 They'll be after us soon enough.

Kanna:
It's probably too late for this now.
 But I'm starting to think we've acted rather rashly.

Ryuya:
Don't start second guessing yourself now.

Uraha:
Ah!
 Look at that!
 What in God's name is happening back at the shrine?

Ryuya:
I don't know.
 But now seems like a pretty good time to get as far away from this place as possible, ladies.

Kanna:
What's that noise?

Ryuya:
I think that we've been surrounded.
 I need you two to run away from here as fast as you can.
 Now go!

-- Eyecatch --

Ryuya:
Drop your sword.
 Now I want you to be honest with me.
 You're one of the guards from Edo, right?
 Why are you pursuing Kanabi-no-Mikoto?

Soldier:
I'm just following orders.
I don't know anything, I swear!

Ryuya:
What are your intentions with her?
 Whose orders are you following?

Soldier:
I don't know!
All I know is our superior officer ordered us to find her.

Ryuya:
I see.

Kanna:
No, stop it!

My God!
I cannot believe what I have just seen, Sir Ryuya.

Ryuya:
If I leave our enemies alive, there'll be more out there hunting us.

Kanna:
You should be ashamed of yourself!
 What kind of barbarian are you!?
 You can just kill people without even giving it a second thought.

Uraha:
Lady Kanna, don't.

Kanna:
It's like it means absolutely nothing to you at all!
 I will not have a murderer as my protector.
 I order you, as long as I am your mistress, you will not kill another human being.
 Understood?

Ryuya:
Yes.
 I understand and I will obey.
 But still, do you really think we'll be able to make it through this without killing anyone?

Uraha:
Oh, I trust it will be an easy task for you, Sir Ryuya.

Ryuya:
Hm, I wish I could be so certain.

Kanna:
Where did you find a kimono like this in the middle of the woods, Uraha?

Uraha:
I saw it hanging from a clothesline by the river and decided to borrow it.
 Of course I left a little money there for the former owner.

Ryuya:
It's very flattering on you, Kanna.

Kanna
Um, you really think so?
 Um, you have unrefined tastes.

Uraha:
Oh, she's so amusing, isn't she?
 While changing, she told me that she wouldn't want you to see her in the kimono if it proved unbecoming.

Kanna:
What's wrong with you?!
 Why would you say something like that?!

I don't think I really like camping food.

Uraha:
When the three of us sit around eating dried fruits and dried fish like this, it's almost as if...

Ryuya:
...As if we've been demoted and sent to some desolate back country, moistening each morsel of our food with our tears?

Uraha;
Now that may be the most elegant metaphor you've ever had.

Ryuya:
The beanbags, Kanna.
 She found them in the kimono.

Kanna:
Uh-huh.

Ryuya:
Those beanbags are filled with rice, so they're a bit unusual.

Uraha:
Normally they'd be made with beans or stones inside, but I imagine these might've been made a little softer for small children.

Kanna;
I wish I could juggle like that.

Uraha:
I'm sure you'll be able to juggle brilliantly once you've had a little practice at it.

Kanna:
Um...
 Yah!

Uraha:
You can't expect to do something well on your very first try.
 Patience is important for everything in life.

Kanna:
No, my hands just weren't steady. I got it now.
 Yah!

Ryuya:
Oh...

Uraha:
You needn't be so forceful with them. Just toss them up to your eye level.

Kanna:
I know what I'm doing.
 Yah!

Ryuya:
And to think you were all worried about me killing somebody.

Uraha:
Oh, you poor, poor uncoordinated creature...

Kanna:
Stop being so dramatic, they're just stinking bean bags!
 Yah!

Kanna:
I don't think I know where Kishu is exactly.
 Is it far from here?

Ryuya:
Yes it is.
 Especially if we walk along the mountains.

Ryuya:
Here you go.

Kanna:
Ah.. Uah!

Uraha:
Here, let me.

Ryuya
It's been almost an entire month and you still aren't any better than when you started!

Kanna:
Hey! Sometimes I do it really well when you're not looking!
 I mean three days ago I did it three times in a row!

Ryuya:
Oh, well, you're right.
 That's very good.

Kanna:
You're making fun of me again, aren't you?

Uraha:
The three of us sitting around a campfire at night in the wilderness--it's almost as if...

Ryuya:
...As if I'm some lady's man who's kidnapped a princess, but am now regretting it because I realize just how naïve she is and how little she actually knows about the real world.

Uraha:
Well, that was a bit of a free-spirited metaphor, Ryuya.

Ryuya:
Does it still count as a metaphor if it's almost a reality?

Uraha:
We're not very far from Kishu now.
 We won't have the luxury of living this kind of life together much longer.

Ryuya:
Huh?

Kanna:
Huh?
 What do those peasants have to be so happy about, I wonder?

Ryuya:
When they dance with their whole hearts, they can forget their problems, if only for a moment.

Uraha:
And that's not the only reason.
 They believe that this dance will take their prayers to the heavens and that the gods will deliver the help they ask for.

Kanna:
But who'll deliver their prayers to the heavens?

Uraha:
Oh.
 What do you mean?

Kanna:
I have wings and have tried to fly ever since I was a little girl.
 But the result has always been exactly the same.
 I would never be able to reach the heavens, I mean, I can't even reach the lowest tree branches.
 Even so, when I pray, I still have hope my wish will make it there.

Ryuya:
It will.

Kanna:
Hm?

Ryuya:
I personally think it's enough just to hold your wish in your heart.
 If you believe in it enough, it's sure to come true.
 Wouldn't you agree?

Uraha:
 I couldn't've put it better myself!

Kanna:
Ugh.
 Get off of me!
 That tickles, Uraha!

Kanna:
It's so quiet here.

Ryuya:
Don't let your guard down.
 We should be within the bounds of the sacred mountain soon.

Uraha:
I didn't expect the boundary to be in place.
 Please be silent.
 I feel we should travel in this direction.

Ryuya:
But how can you be sure?

Uraha:
I suppose it's just a woman's intuition, Sir Ryuya.

Ryuya:
Don't make a sound.
 Warrior monks, how nice.

Monk A:
Women are forbidden on this land.

Monk B:
You look like a country soldier.
What business do you have on this mountain?

Ryuya:
I was just wandering through the night and I must have lost my way.
 Seems I was tricked by a wild fox.
 Or was it a wild tanuki.

Monk C:
If that's the way you wanted, crossing the joining boundary is punishable by death.
And you just smart-mouthed your way into it.

Kanna:
Ryuya!
 Behind you!


 You will not kill another human being.

Kanna:
Sir Ryuya! Are you all right?!

Ryuya:
Stay back!

Monk D:
You're an intruder, your presence has infected this sacred land.
You must know you'll never reach Yaobikuni.

Ryuya:
Yaobikuni.

Kanna:
Sir Ryuya, you're alive!

Uraha:
Sir Ryuya!
 Oh, you came back to us after all.
 I'm so glad.
 It seems now the worst is over and you'll be able to heal.

Ryuya:
How long have I been sleeping in here anyway?

Uraha:
Oh, for hours and hours, more than a day.
 Do not worry.
 We have crossed the joining boundary.
 The monks are not be able to reach us now.

Ryuya:
That's good news.

Uraha:
I'll go fetch some water.

Kanna:
I have to tell you something.

Ryuya:
What, Kanna?
 You weren't hurt, were you?

Kanna:
No, it's not that.
 I ordered you not to kill anyone, but now I realize that was foolish of me.
 I couldn't forgive myself.
 If...
 You know...
 If you...

Ryuya:
My loyalty is to you, Lady Kanna.
 And I'll follow your orders to the best of my ability no matter what they are.
 So, if you order me not to die, then I will be incapable of disobeying you.

Kanna:
(Sobbing)
 Well, in that case, I order you...
 No, this isn't an order.
 It's my plea.
 Sir Ryuya, please, please don't die.

Ryuya:
I won't.
 I promise you.

Ryuya:
So this is it?

Uraha:
Yes, I can sense this is what we've been looking for.

Kanna:
Does that mean my mother is nearby?

Uraha:
Yes, she is.

Ryuya:
You two stand back.

Yaobikuni:
Stop at once!
If you are here to drag me into a war, know that I will never let you leave here alive.

Ryuya:
Please forgive our trespass.
 I assure you that I have no hostile intentions.
 I am merely Kannabi-no-Mikoto's humble attendant searching for her lost mother.

Yaobikuni:
Kanna?

Kanna:
Yes, Mother, it's me.
 Let me show you.

Uraha:
Uh.

Ryuya:
Uh.

Kanna:
These are my wings.
 They've never been able to flutter or fly.
 But I thought that if perhaps you have the same wings that I do...

Yaobikuni:
Oh, my Kanna!

Kanna:
Uh!
 Mother, is it you!?

Yaobikuni:
You there, Sir Ryuya.

Ryuya:
Hm?

Yaobikuni:
Take Kanna off this mountain.
You must take her away and never let her return.

Ryuya:
Huh?

Uraha:
Huh?

-- ED --

Yaobikuni:
Tell me, what is it you want from me?

Uraha:
We wanna take you away from this place.
 Then you and Kanna can live together as a happy family for the rest of your lives.

Kanna:
You weren't watching.

Uraha:
We can set up a small residence someplace quiet where no one would bother us.

Kanna:
It's strange, I thought dreams had to be sad.
 I've had fun with you two.

Ryuya:
Kanna!
 Ugh!

Kanna:
But why!?
 I don't understand!
 Why does everybody have to leave me?!
