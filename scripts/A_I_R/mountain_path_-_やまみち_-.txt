  Uraha:
How long ago did you make that hidden door in the wall?

Ryuya:
I finished it a couple of weeks ago--figured we'd need it sooner or later.

Kanna:
You certainly have a strange way of guarding me, making a big hole so anybody could get in?

Ryuya:
I hope your running is as good as your complaining.

Kanna:
Don't worry.
 I'm prepared to endure any hardship just as long as I get to see my mother.

Ryuya:
From here on out, there aren't gonna be any paths.
 So watch your step.

Kanna:
You don't have to coddle me, this is no big d--
Aah!

Ryuya:
As I was saying.

Uraha:
Lady Kanna, please tell me you're all right!

Kanna:
Do what!? Does it look like I'm all right!?

Uraha:
I can't see you--it's too dark!
 I hope your clothes didn't get too soiled.

Kanna:
Oh, so my clothes are more important to you than I am!

Ryuya:
Why don't both of you just pull your kimonos up so that we can get going.

Uraha:
Ooh, my goodness! How scandalous to ask the two of us to do such a thing!

Kanna:
What!? You pervert! You are shameless, aren't you?

Ryuya:
Ugh... would the two of you listen to yourselves for a second? I'm just saying if you pull them up, it'll be easier to walk through the grass.
 We haven't lost our pursuers yet.

Uraha:
We certainly haven't.

-- OP --

Ryuya:
Don't get too far away.
 (Fighting)

Ryuya:
Let's go!

Ryuya:
You can move again.

Kanna:
What a nightmare this is!

Ryuya:
You did a great job of keeping quiet, Lady Kanna.

Kanna:
Don't you patronize me!
 You think I'm just some worthless idiot!?
 Now hurry up before I leave you behind.

Ryuya:
I suspect we can probably catch up.

Kanna:
Hmm?

Ryuya:
I get the feeling we've got a lot of company in these woods tonight.
 Uraha, you brought extra clothes for Kanna, didn't you?

Uraha:
Uh...

Ryuya:
The two of you should stay here and relax until I get back, all right?
 Don't leave this spot!

Uraha:
But Sir Ryuya...

Kanna:
Wait, where are you going?

Ryuya:
Everything's gonna be fine.

Soldier 1:
Over there! A woman!

Soldier 2:
She sure is in a hurry! Get her!

Soldier 3:
Hurry up! Don't lose her!

Ryuya:
The woman just fell into the river!

Soldier 4:
She fell in the river!

Soldier 5:
Get down to the [in bright light] now!

Ryuya:
Imbeciles.


Soldier 6:
Look! It's her robe!

Soldier 7:
Call everyone over! Hurry it up!

Soldier 8:
No, not there!

Soldier 9:
Downstream! Search downstream!

Ryuya:
Drop your sword.
 Now, I want you to be honest with me.
 If you're honest with me, I'll spare your life.
 You're one of the guards from Edo, right?
 Why are you pursuing Kannabi-no-Mikoto?

Guard:
I'm just following orders--I don't know anything, I swear!

Ryuya:
What are your intentions with her?
 Whose orders are you following?

Guard:
I don't know!
All I know is our superior officer ordered us to find her!

Ryuya:
I see...

Kanna:
No, stop it!

Kanna:
My God! I cannot believe what I have just seen, Sir Ryuya.

Ryuya:
If I leave our enemies alive, there'll be more out there hunting us.

Kanna:
You should be ashamed of yourself! What kind of barbarian are you!?
 You just told that man you would spare his life.
 Do you lie with no sense of shame?
 Do you break promises with no sense of honor?

Ryuya:
I do what the situation warrants.

Kanna:
So I guess, depending on the situation, you'd break your promise to protect me.

Kanna:
You can just kill people without even giving it a second thought!

Uraha:
Lady Kanna, don't!

Kanna:
It's like it means absolutely nothing to you at all!
 I will not have a murderer as my protector.
 I order you, as long as I am your Mistress, you will not kill another human being. Understood?

Ryuya:
Yes, I understand and I will obey.

Kanna:
Good. I'm glad to hear it.

Ryuya:
But still, do you really think we'll be able to make it through this without killing anyone?

Uraha:
Oh, I trust that it will be an easy task for you, Sir Ryuya.

Ryuya:
Hmph, I wish I could be so certain.


Ryuya:
I think we can relax now. I don't see any more pursuers.

Kanna:
Well, thank goodness for that.

Ryuya:
Uraha, sorry to trouble you, but could you fetch some water?
 There's a stream down below.

Uraha:
I would be happy to.

Ryuya:
Lady Kanna, are you all right?

Kanna:
Don't talk to me right now, Ryuya.
 I have a really bad headache.

Ryuya:
I bet that's because of the heat.
 Here.

Kanna:
What do you think you're doing?!

Ryuya:
I was only trying to cool you down a little.

Kanna:
Warn me before doing something like that.

Ryuya:
I'm gonna pour some water on you.

Kanna:
Aah! What are you, crazy, that's no kind of warning, you stinking moron!

Ryuya:
Why are you being such a spoiled brat?

Kanna:
Why do I put up with you?!

Uraha:
Oh my goodness, Lady Kanna.
 I'm glad to see that you're finally feeling better now.

Ryuya:
I know. It's amazing how quickly children recover from injuries.

Kanna:
I am not feeling better, you numskulls! I'm angry!

Ryuya:
(Laughing)

Ryuya:
I think we might have a problem.
 This summer is just going to get hotter.
 If she stays in these robes, the heat's going to get to her before too long.

Uraha:
Don't worry about that.
 I have found a summer kimono for her to wear.
 All right, Lady Kanna, come over here.

Kanna:
No, I... I'm perfectly comfortable in this.

Uraha:
My, my! That was spoken just like a spoiled little child, wasn't it?
 Come on!
 (Laughing)

Kanna:
(Crying)

Uraha:
Well, well, Lady Kanna, you are simply drenched in sweat.

Kanna:
Hey! Don't touch me! What do you think you're doing!?

Ryuya:
(Clearing throat)

Uraha:
Oh, it's just as I thought! Your clothes are so damp all the way through!

Kanna:
Stop it! You are tickling me! Uraha!

Ryuya:
(Yawning)

Uraha:
(Laughing)
 Ah!

Kanna:
(Laughing)
 Ah!

Ryuya:
You okay?

Uraha:
That monkey took our new kimono.
 You see? He's right up there.

Kanna:
Give that back, you stupid monkey!

Ryuya:
Stand back.

Uraha:
Oh my! That was admirably done, Sir Ryuya.

Kanna:
Hm. Well, I expect no less from my protector.

Uraha:
(Crying)

Kanna:
(Crying)

Ryuya:
Don't! Stop! Wait! And quit that! Why are you hitting me!?

Uraha:
I'm gonna keep hitting you until you leave, uh!

Kanna:
To be in my presence while I'm undressing!? How disrespectful!

Ryuya:
But you just told me I was figured a good protector!

Kanna:
That was before you got all creepy!

Ryuya:
I swear I didn't see anything!

Uraha:
Thank you for waiting so patiently.

Kanna:
Where did you find a kimono like this in the middle of the woods, Uraha?

Uraha:
I saw it hanging from a clothesline by the river and decided to borrow it.
 Of course I left a little money there for the former owner.

Ryuya:
It's very flattering on you, Kanna.

Kanna:
Uh, you really think so?
 You have unrefined tastes.

 Ryuya:
 Anyone would think you're just an average country girl.
But you're probably a bit too cute for that.
 Of course it does help that you're so bony.

Kanna:
That was completely uncalled for!

Ryuya:
You don't seem to be getting any better at that, do ya?

Uraha:
When learning something new, the beginning is the key.
 You must build a good foundation and you'll progress before you know it, Lady Kanna.

Kanna:
You really want me to practice with these things?

Uraha:
You'll discover you learn more quickly when the stakes are higher.

Kanna:
But if I make a mistake, it's gonna hurt.

Uraha:
If you sense danger, you'll try harder to catch them.

Ryuya:
I wasn't aware juggling was supposed to be so hazardous.

Uraha:
Go on, try it!

Ryuya:
They're ignoring me.

Kanna:
Yaah!
 Doh, oh, no!

Uraha:
Lady Kanna!

Ryuya:
Hey, are you all right!? Can you hear me? Please say something!

Uraha:
Oh, Lady Kanna!


Uraha:
She's sleeping better than ever before.

Ryuya:
Well being active all day is the best way to earn your rest, isn't it?
 'Course I'm sure the mild concussion is probably helping quite a lot as well.

Uraha:
I hadn't thought of it that way.

Ryuya:
You should get some sleep too.
 We'll be hiking again all day tomorrow.

Uraha:
But surely you must be even more exhausted than we are.

Ryuya:
I'm all right. I'm used to all this.

Uraha:
From your days at war.

Ryuya:
Ah, yes.

Uraha:
Please! I insist you get some rest, if only a little.
 I'll keep watch and wake you if anything's wrong.

Ryuya:
I guess I'll take you up on that.

-- Eyecatch --

Man:
Pretty nice quality, aren't they?

Uraha:
Seems to be a pretty good-sized market, doesn't it?

Kanna:
So what is this place?

Uraha:
It's where goods are bought, sold and traded.

Ryuya:
Try your best to blend in, as I'm sure you're aware, people are still after us.

Kanna:
I know that. What kind of simpleton do you think I am.
 Uraha! Come here and tell me what these nasty things are!

Uraha:
They're called “Ubai.” People take them to get rid of their stomach aches.

Kanna:
Oh! I remember, they're really sour.
 It's sweet rice Mochi.

Uraha:
Remember the time you tried to eat too many at once and almost choked on them?
 You gave me quite a scare that day.

Kanna:
They were so good I couldn't help myself, all right?
 What's in these jugs?

Uraha:
I'm not sure but I think it's sweet rice wine.
 One time, remember, you drank a little bit too much for your own good and sort of lost your mind for a while?

Kanna:
I only asked you what was in the jugs!

Ryuya:
Please try to be a little less conspicuous, both of you.

Uraha:
Oh, not to worry, Sir Ryuya.
 Any noise we make will be drowned out by all the commotion around us.
 Don't you agree?

Kanna:
Besides, nobody from the shrine would be able to recognize me like this anyway.
 After all, I am just a bony little country girl, remember?

Ryuya:
Man, can somebody hold a grudge or what?
 I misspoke. You're a lovely country girl, the loveliest country girl most we'll ever see, so lovely in fact you stand out from the crowd, so please, could you rein it in?

Kanna:
As usual, your compliment sounds completely insincere and borderline insulting!
 Ah.
 You there! Tell me at once what these striped balls are called!

Man:
They're just melons.

Kanna:
I do not believe you, because I know for a fact that melons are much softer and juicier.
 How can one bite into something so hard?

Man:
Ma'am, you aren't from around here, are ya?

Kanna:
Oh, no, I come from the place that's about ten days walk...

Ryuya:
(Laughing)
 Sorry, we have lots of trouble with this girl, she's little messed up in the head, you know.

Man:
I'm sorry to hear that.
You know, I had a cousin like that once in...

Kanna:
Who are you saying is messed up in the head?!

Ryuya:
Just who else would I be talking about, genius?!
 Uraha, please talk some sense into this girl!
 Hey, where is she?

Kanna:
Uraha! The dumb samurai's disrespecting me!

Ryuya:
Quit biting! Quit biting me!

Kanna:
Damn! How else am I supposed to defend myself against a big hairy Mongoloid?!

Ryuya:
Can't believe I'd spend half the day babysitting.
 Where on earth could she have gone?

Kanna:
I've never seen a bird quite as ugly as you in all my life.
 No wonder you still haven't been sold at the end of the day.
 You don't even have a pretty voice to entice a buyer!
 At least cockatoos and canaries have that going for 'em.

Kanna:
Don't stand there laughing at me, you ridiculous bird!
 I could have you for dinner, you know!
 Those silly tail feathers, I'm gonna yank them out by their roots one by one, ya hear me?!
 (Fighting)

Man:
Oh no, hey, stop that!
That's my best Onaga you're fighting with there, Miss! Please!

Kanna:
And so, what are we gonna see next?

Ryuya:
How about we see if we can find Uraha?

Kanna:
Uh-huh.

Beggar:
Excuse me, Sir.
I'm sorry to bother you, Sir, please have mercy on me.
I was chased out of my village three days ago, and now I've nothing but the clothes on my back.

Ryuya:
Was there a war?

Man:
I don't know.
A group of armed warrior showed up one day and ordered me out.
They took over my home, my fields, all of my earthly possessions.

Kanna:
They had no right to do that.

Man:
Ah, my goodness, what a lovely young lady!
Does she by any chance have royalty in her bloodline?

Kanna:
You can tell just by looking at me?

Ryuya:
Ahem.

Kanna:
Oh, no, I, uh, what I meant was, I'm a cute village girl with nothing to hide, at least the villagers say I'm cute, even if I am a bit on the bony side.

Ryuya:
Just let it go, skinny.

Kanna:
Why are you just standing there?
 You should give this poor man something to help him out.

Ryuya:
Well, let's see if I have got anything.
 This isn't worth much, but I hope it can still be useful to you.

Man:
A thousand thanks to both of you.
I shall remember your kindness.

Kanna:
I hope your luck begins to change soon.

Kanna:
We just did a good deed.

Ryuya:
Maybe we did, and maybe we didn't.

Kanna:
What makes you say that?

Ryuya:
He could be pretending to get our sympathy.
 If I were starving, I wouldn't be above lying to get a little something to eat.
 Only a fool believes everything a desperate man says, especially one begging for money.

Kanna:
Sometimes I pity your tiny brain. At the end of the day, your logic doesn't account for how sickly and thin he was.

Ryuya:
 Hmm... oh yeah. I stand corrected.

Kanna:
But I am hungrier than him, though.

Ryuya:
 Okay, I'm not impressed with her anymore.

Uraha:
Be patient with Lady Kanna, she's still growing, you know.

Ryuya:
 Yeah, well if you're growing I've got some advice.
 Try putting some of that new growth right about here somewhere.

Kanna:
Oh, just shut up!

Ryuya:
 (Laughing)
 Once you grow up, you'll be able to take a joke.

Uraha:
I may as well not even be here!

Ryuya:
 Ah! When did you get back here?!
 You know, you shouldn't sneak up on a person like that, especially not a warrior!

Kanna:
You're as sneaky as a hungry polecat.

Uraha:
 I'm not sure what that means. But I'm glad to see you two appreciate my company.

Ryuya:
 Where have you been all day?

Uraha:
Oh, I'll save that for later, 'kay?
 In the meantime, I brought something for you, Lady Kanna.

Ryuya:
 A walnut! That's pretty rare this time of year.

Uraha:
It's supposed to be good luck since it came from one of the trees at the shrine.
 And what makes it even luckier is that it's the very first walnut of the year.

Ryuya:
 That's all great and all, but seriously I had a terrible time with her when you were gone.

 Uraha:
Oh, Lady Kanna.

Kanna:
...Somebody, help!

Ryuya:
 Say, you weren't thinking of dumping Kanna on me and leaving us in the middle of nowhere, were you?

Uraha:
Only you could come up with such a devious and despicable plan, Sir Ryuya.

Ryuya:
 Quit it, quit it. Do you wanna break your teeth?

Kanna:
Why won't you let me help with dinner?
The two of you do all the work around here all the time and it's really not fair!

Ryuya:
 All right, why not get us some firewood? And leave the walnut here. I'll open it while you're gone.

Kanna:
That sounds good! And now I'm gonna get more firewood than you've ever seen!

Ryuya:
 Great.
 Don't wander off too far now.

Kanna:
Don't worry, I won't!

Uraha:
They've set up a checkpoint a couple of miles down the road beyond the marketplace.

Ryuya:
Huh?

Uraha:
They seem to be targeting young girls and looking at their backs.
 I believe they were checking for wings.

Ryuya:
 Guess that means we'll have to avoid taking the main roads from here on out.
 How did you think to look for a checkpoint?

Uraha:
It seemed like an unusual location for a market, so it made me a bit suspicious.
 And once I looked around, I found that my suspicions were correct.

 Ryuya:
You sure are wise about the world.
 That was a big help.

Uraha:
 Wherever did you learn a skill like that?

Ryuya:
I wouldn't necessarily call it a skill.
 I just do it for fun and because it's good for me to stay in practice.
 But don't tell Kanna about it. She might get it in her head that a walnut is a living being.

Uraha:
 “I order you not to kill another human being,” was that it?

Ryuya:
What do you think?
 Will I do as I'm told, or do as I have to?

Uraha:
Lady Kanna ordered, she ordered me never to say anything to you, but... do you remember what happened that night after we left the shrine?
 After you left us, when Lady Kanna heard the pursuer's whistle, she said:

Kanna:
Sir Ryuya's gonna be caught by those men!
 We must show ourselves at once!
 If we don't let them know we are here, they're surely gonna kill him! Ah!


Uraha:
I told her you were only trying to trick them, but she would not believe me.

Ryuya:
Yes, I see.

Uraha:
So with all due respect, I believe you will keep the promise you made her.

Ryuya:
What makes you so sure?

Uraha:
Just this, if she had ordered you to kill them, if she'd told you to do it, how would you have responded to that, Sir Ryuya?

Ryuya:
I would have been angry. I would have told her that one shouldn't take a human life so easily.

Uraha:
Mmhmm.

Ryuya:
Adults have to set good examples for children, after all.

Uraha:
I couldn't agree with you more!

Kanna:
I got the firewood!
 Did I do good or what?

Uraha:
Oh, Lady Kanna!

Ryuya:
I was thinking we'd build the fire over here.

Kanna:
Shut up you! I just wasn't watching where I was going!

 Kanna:
Uh, Sir Ryuya? Are you awake?
 I was wondering...

Ryuya:
Yes, Kanna.

Kanna:
 I need a favor, but I'm a little embarrassed.
 It's just... I don't know who to ask, except for you.

 <Preview>

Uraha:
Wake... up!

Ryuya:
I have no idea what my parents look like.

Kanna:
 Why ever not?

Ryuya:
I think I was abandoned.
 Unsui picked me up when I was crying on the side of the road.
 He was a traveling monk.
