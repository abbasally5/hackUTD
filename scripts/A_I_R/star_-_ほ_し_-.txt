  Minagi:
Good morning, Mr. Kunisaki.

Yukito:
What?

Minagi:
Good morning.

Yukito:
Oh, that's right.
I forgot I spent the night here last night.

Minagi:
Breakfast is ready when you are.

Yukito:
Did you bring all this stuff from the house?

Minagi:
Yes.

Yukito:
You know, Tohno, you might be even more suited to be a wanderer than I am.


Michiru:
Minagi!

Yukito, Minagi:
Huh?

Michiru:
All right, welcome back home! Woohoo!

Minagi:
Michiru...

Michiru:
I got worried when you didn't meet me like you said yesterday.
Oh brother, I sure am glad that I made that wish.

Minagi:
What wish was that?

Michiru:
Oh, I made a wish on the star-sand that you'd come back and you did!
Isn't that neat?

Minagi:
Yes.

Michiru:
Uh-huh.

Yukito:
Okay, time for breakfast. Eat up!

Michiru:
I'm gonna eat till I'm sick!

Yukito:
Easy there, Little Pig.

Michiru:
Don't call me a pig, Mr. Stingy!

Yukito:
Piggy, piggy! Oink, oink.

-- OP --

Yukito:
 Why didn't you wait for me this morning?
 I said I'd come get you.

Misuzu:
 Oh, I just needed to get an early start.
 Sorry.

Yukito:
 That's okay, I guess.
 I wanted to ask you if you're still having those dreams.

Misuzu:
 Mmhmm. Just last night I had a dream that I was with someone in a forest after dark, and we talked about all kinds of things.

Yukito:
 Who was it? Do you know?

Misuzu:
 I can't remember exactly who she was, but I do remember that she was there.
 I asked her about the ocean.
 And then... she told me all kinds of things about the ocean that I never could have known.
 I kept thinking how fun it was just to listen to her.
 The whole time she was talking, I just wanted to wrap her words up and keep them forever.

Yukito:
 Well, if you were having that much fun, why'd you ever wake up?

Misuzu:
 Oh, gao... oh man...

Michiru:
Hello there! Whee!

Minagi:
Mr. Kunisaki.

Michiru:
Welcome home!

Yukito:
Hey there, guys.

Minagi:
Did you have a productive day?
 Were the puppet shows well-received?
 Were the children nice?

Yukito:
Well, it was kinda slow today.

Michiru:
Humph, kinda slow?
 I'm starting to think that you're a good-for-nothing.

 Hey, what'd you do that for?!

Yukito:
Because you deserved it, you little brat!

Michiru:
What'd you call me?!

Yukito:
You heard me!
She plays, she eats, and then she sleeps.
 I wish I had that kind of life, don't you?

Minagi:
I had a dream about my father last night.

Yukito:
What was it about?

Minagi:
Oh, we used to come out here and he would tell me about all the stars in the sky.
 It was about those days.

Minagi's father:
Minagi, a god lives on each and every one of those stars up there.
 And the gods on the stars protect us.
 They purify the hearts of anyone who cares to observe them.

Minagi:
It wasn't long after that that my father left town and never came back.
 And after we lost my sister, my parents just couldn't seem to get along with each other anymore.

Yukito:
Haven't seen him since, huh?

Minagi:
The last time I heard, he was remarried and living in a faraway town.
 But right before he left, he gave me this and said to remember him by it.

Michiru:
Don't you have to go to work or something?

Yukito:
I'm taking a break, all right?

Michiru:
So... Minagi's not at home anymore, is she?

Yukito:
Uh...

Michiru:
You can't hide things from me. I'm her best friend.
 I don't know why but I feel like something's about to change.
 Minagi's gotta wake up from her dream someday, y'know?

Yukito:
What is that supposed to mean?

Michiru:
I think I'm gonna go home now.
 It's time to go.

Yukito:
Wait!

Potato:
Piko!

Michiru:
See you later!

Potato:
Piko.

Minagi's mother:
Well, I'm so sorry to have bothered you.

Hijiri:
Not at all.
 If you ever need anything, please don't hesitate to stop by, all right?

Minagi's mother:
Sure.

Yukito:
She starting to remember?

Hijiri:
A little. She said she's lost something important but she doesn't remember what it is.

Yukito:
Were you able to help her at all?

Hijiri:
I just told her.. that she would remember what it was when she finds it again.
 I guess the rest depends on how Minagi feels about all this.

Minagi:
 Welcome home! Is there something wrong?

Yukito:
 I've decided... I've decided I'm leaving town.

Minagi:
 Huh?

Yukito:
 I've overstayed my welcome.
 It's time for me to be moving on.

Minagi:
 Oh, I... I understand.

Yukito:
 Tohno, why don't you come with me?

Minagi:
 Huh?

Yukito:
 I think you should see the real world; not just some fantasy.
 I'd like to show it to you if you let me.

Minagi:
 The real world...

Yukito:
 Come with me. Come with me and we'll find it together.

Minagi:
 I'm ready. I think I got everything.

Yukito:
 Okay, let's go.

Minagi:
 Um... Mr. Kunisaki.
 Can I stop by to see Michiru?
 I'd like to see her before I leave town.

Yukito:
 Just keep following me.

Yukito:
 All right. This is it.

Minagi:
 I don't understand.

Yukito:
 I hope you know that the only thing in this world that Michiru wants is for you to be happy.

Minagi:
 Did she tell you that?

Yukito:
 You'll have to look inside yourself and choose what path to take in life.
 Now my offer still stands, and you're more than welcome to come with me.
 I'd be glad to have you along, wherever I end up.
 So the choice is up to you now.
 You, Minagi Tohno, have to decide what's best.

Minagi:
 Mom, I'm home.

Minagi's mother:
Minagi...

Minagi:
 Oh, Mama!

Michiru:
 There's sure a lot of stars out.

Yukito:
 Yeah, there are.

Michiru:
 You think Minagi is looking at them too?

Yukito:
 Yeah, she and her mom are probably stargazing together.

Michiru:
 Might be about time... for me to start thinking about going home.

Yukito:
 I guess it is getting pretty late.
 I can walk you home whenever you're ready to go.
 Hm? You know, I have no idea where you live.

Michiru:
 I have a place that I have to go back to.

Yukito:
 Michiru?

Michiru:
 See, there's this very lonely girl who lives all by herself up in the sky.

Yukito:
 This girl's in... the sky?

Michiru:
 She has nothing but sad dreams all the time.
 It's because she can't be happy.
 So all she can do is keep dreaming these really sad dreams.
 She has a pair of battered wings on her back that are mysterious and powerful.
 They're woven with the memories of many different people.

 I asked her if I could have one of her feathers for someone.
 I thought that if my friend was happy, the girl in the sky would be too.
 I was so sure that it would work.
 That she would see the happiness she caused and her dreams would end.

Yukito:
 I see.

Michiru:
 I guess people can't really live without their memories, can they?
 But you know, I don't think it's possible to live on nothing but memories.
 Everybody has to wake up from their dreams sometime.
 Because a dream you can't wake up from will just turn into sadness after a while.
 So that's why, it's time that I take the feather back.
 I don't wanna say goodbye to everybody, but... well, I am just a dream after all.
 The stars disappear at sunrise and I should do that too.

Yukito:
 Michiru, are you...?

Michiru:
 I'm only part of someone else's dream, only here as somebody's fantasy.
 But it was a really fun dream to be a part of.
 I've really been so happy here.
 But Michiru, I mean the real Michiru, she never even had the chance to be born.
 She never even got to see this world.

-- Eyecatch --

Minagi:
 The first time I ever met Michiru, it was at the station.
 Even after my dad left us, I still went to the station every day to pick him up from work.
 I knew he'd already quit his job there and he wouldn't be waiting for me.
 But I didn't know anything else that I could do.

Yukito:
 Was that around the same time your mother started calling you by your sister's name?

Minagi:
 Yes. And I let her do it.
 Because as long as she thought I was Michiru, Mom seemed okay.

Yukito:
 Hijiri told me... that that was also around the time you stopped laughing.

Minagi:
 It was late in the summer, after a pretty heavy storm.

Michiru:
Hm?

Minagi:
I don't know why, but I felt like I'd seen her somewhere before.
 No, it was like she had always been with me.

Michiru:
 My name's Michiru. What's your name?

Minagi:
 I'm Minagi!

Minagi:
 Everything, all of this trouble, started with my sin.

Yukito:
 Sin?

Minagi:
 If I hadn't wished for a little sister, nobody would've ever had such a dream.
 I realize now it's something I didn't have any right to ask for.
 Eventually, I know that Michiru may have to get hurt from all this.
 But for now, I want her to meet someone very important before she leaves.
 Important to both of us.

Girl A:
Hey, wait up, will you?!

Girl B
You'd better hurry up or we're never gonna get a spot at the fireworks display.

Girl A
I know, but I can't run as fast as you can!

Michiru:
 How long have I been asleep?

Yukito:
 Well, you played pretty hard all day long, so you've been out for a while.

Minagi:
 You must've worked up an appetite.
 I have an idea.
 Let's go over to my house and get something to eat.

Michiru:
 Your house, Minagi?


Minagi's mother:
My daughter doesn't usually bring her friends home for me to meet them.
So I made something special for dinner.
I really hope you'll enjoy it.

Michiru:
Mm...

Minagi's Mother:
How rude of me.
I'm sorry, but I've been so excited I haven't even asked you what your name is.

Michiru:
Um... my name?

Minagi's Mother:
Well, you do have a name, don't you?
I do apologize for not asking you sooner.

Michiru:
Mm...

Minagi:
It's okay. You can tell her.

Michiru:
You sure?

Minagi:
Mmhmm.

Michiru:
Uh... my name is... my name is... my name is Michiru!

Minagi's mother:
Michiru...

Michiru:
Mmhmm.

Minagi's Mother:
You know, I've always thought that was a beautiful name.

Michiru:
Ah, but I'm really... You see, I'm actually...
I don't know how to say this is... Uh... I'm...

Minagi's Mother:
Michiru...
I think that it's a wonderful name.
You know, hamburger has always been my daughter's favorite thing to have for lunch too.
She used to say that when she got a sister, she would want her to eat my special hamburger every day for lunch as well.
Isn't that right, Minagi?

Minagi:
Mmhmm. Yes it is.

Minagi's Mother:
Oh, listen to me, sitting here chatting away long, everybody's lunch is getting cold.
Hamburger always tastes better warm.

Michiru:
Mm. Thanks a lot.

Minagi's Mother:
So, is it good?

Michiru:
Mm. It's super delicious!

Minagi's Mother:
I used my own secret recipe.
I taught Minagi how to make them too.
Here, I'm glad someone else enjoys as much as she does.

Michiru:
For me?

Minagi's Mother:
Mmhmm.
It makes me so happy to see people enjoying the food I've made for them.

Michiru:
Thank you.

Good-bye... Mom.


Minagi
Well, if that's what you want, I guess I can do that.

Michiru:
Yeah, please take care of it for me.

Minagi:
Mm.

Hm? Michiru? Michiru? Michiru?!
I didn't think she would just leave without even saying good-bye.

Yukito:
It's okay.
We should still have some time to find her.
I figure we've got until the stars come out.
And I've got a pretty good idea where she'll be.


Minagi:
 Ah! Michiru...
 Michiru!! What are you doing?
 You need to come back inside the fence.
 It's dangerous out there.

Michiru:
 Sorry, I can't. I have to go soon anyway.
 I had so much fun getting to know you.
 But now, I'm going to have to leave.
 Don't look at me like that.
 You need to keep smiling no matter what.
 When you aren't smiling, it makes me feel sad.

Minagi:
 Michiru. I was only able to be myself because of you for all these years.
 If you were to go away, I don't know if I could ever smile again.

Michiru:
 You'll be okay.
 Because you've learned to laugh with other people now, not just with me.
 Hey Minagi, Yukito Kunisaki, let's make a promise.

Yukito:
 What promise?

Michiru:
 The girl with wings is all by herself up there in the sky.
 And she's still having sad dreams every night.
 I'm going back to her soon.
 And when I do, I'm going to take everything with me.
 All the good memories of all the fun times I've spent with the two of you.
 So if you ever find her, promise to tell her something for me?
 Tell her about any memory that's a happy one.
 I think that might be the only thing that can free her from her sad dream.

Yukito:
 Sure.

Michiru:
 Minagi, I want you to keep smiling always.
 Can you say goodbye to me with a smile?

Minagi:
 I can't. How could I smile when I'm losing you forever?!

Michiru:
 Minagi.

Minagi:
 We'll never see each other again!

Michiru:
 That's not so bad.
 Once you wake up from a dream, the memories of it stay with you.
 And that way, don't you see? Your last memory of me will be a happy one.
 But, only you can make that happen.
 Minagi, I want you to promise me.
 Are you smiling right now?

Minagi:
 Uh-huh.

Michiru:
 Really?

Minagi:
 Mmhmm.

Michiru:
 Then, keep smiling.
 Say goodbye to me with a smile on your face.

Minagi:
 Are you smiling, too?

Michiru:
 Yeah.

Minagi:
 Are you sad to be leaving?

Michiru:
 Hm, 'course not! I'm smiling, aren't I?
 Wouldn't it be wonderful if you and I kept smiling and the rest of the world filled with laughter, and then everybody got to live happily ever after.

Minagi:
 Mmhmm.

Michiru:
 Goodbye.

Minagi:
 I'll miss you, Michiru.
 Thank you, Michiru.

Yukito:
 Hey, Tohno. What's up?
 I hope you're not running away again.
 Is that a rice coupon?

Minagi:
 No, no, it's just a letter, an invitation from my father.
 He wrote to ask if I'd visit him before my summer break is over.
 But the most exciting part is that I have a little sister.
 Dad and his new wife have a little girl now.
 And they want me to come meet her.

Yukito:
 Is that her name?

Minagi:
 Mm...

Minagi:
 To be honest with you, I was a little hesitant at first.
 But I think it would be good to meet her.
 Mom encouraged me to go, too.

Yukito:
 All right.

Yukito:
 Tohno!
 Wings that can't fly still have a purpose!
 Because no matter what happens, they still hold the memories of being able to fly!

Minagi:
 Mm...

Yukito:
 Isn't that right, Michiru?

Michiru:
 Mmhmm?

Minagi:
 Do you like blowing bubbles?

Michiru:
 Yeah, it's my favorite.
 But it's like no matter how hard I try, I mess it up.

Minagi:
 Would you like for me to teach you how to do it a little better?

Michiru:
 Really?

Minagi:
 Yes, I'd love to.
 Guess I should introduce myself.
 I'm Minagi, and who might you be?

Michiru:
 Hello, Minagi.
 Nice to meet you.
 My name is...


Yukito:
 Misuzu! Time to go to school!

Yukito:
 Hey! Misuzu! Misuzu!
 Snap out of it!
 C'mon, wake up!
 Open your eyes, come on!
 Misuzu!
