  Kano:
I would rather... with my own hands...

Yukito:
Hey, Kano!

Yukito:
Oh my God! You guys okay?

Potato:
Piko...

-- OP --

Hijiri:
It looks like you might have that bruise for a while.
 Sorry about this.
 I can't apologize enough for her behavior--to both of you.

Misuzu:
Oh, no...

Yukito:
We really aren't the ones I'm worried about right now.

Hijiri:
It goes back a long time, when Kano was just a little girl.
 It was the first summer after our mother died.

Kano:
Huh? Hey, look! Over there!
 They have balloons, Hijiri, look!
 Do you see it?
 You see it?
 If we bought one, you think we could fly away?

Hijiri:
If just one balloon could lift up two people, don't you think that entire balloon shop would've flown away by now?

Kano:
I suppose...
 Oh Hijiri, you're so smart!
wάntɪd tʊ/ → /wάnɪtʊ/]

Hijiri:
Yeah, I guess you would need a whole lot of them if you wanted to do that.
 But you can only buy one today.

Kano:
Then I'll just ask the balloon man to blow it up really gigantic as big as it can go.
 And then maybe it'll lift us away and we'll be able to fly after all.

Hijiri:
You won't be able to buy anything else, okay?

Kano:
Okay!

Hijiri:
Here.

Kano:
Wow! Thank you, Hijiri.
 Ugh! Ahh!

Hijiri:
Kano always wanted to fly.
 She thought she could see our mother that way.
 I taught her that our mother was in the sky and watching us all the time.
 And Kano took that literally.
 Neither Dad nor I really had the heart to tell her that Mother was no longer around anymore.

Hijiri:
 Ah, Kano, wait!

Kano:
Huh?

Yukito:
And then...? What happened?

Hijiri:
Well, nothing much. The shrine keeper showed up.

Shrine keeper:
Hey! You kids shouldn't be playing over there.

Hijiri:
We put the plume back, apologized and went home.
 That's it.

Kano:
Guess we'll have to wait till next year to visit Mom in the sky.

Hijiri:
The following morning, Kano started acting strangely.
 She became afraid of bright lights and started wandering around in a daze talking to herself, saying things that didn't make any sense to me at all.
 One evening she disappeared, so I went looking for her.
 I was frantic, searching everywhere for her.
 And when I finally found her, she was in here.
 She was... holding a scalpel to her wrist.
 Thankfully I caught her before she did it.
 But it wasn't her anymore.
 It was like someone else was in there and sort of... taking her over.

Yukito:
You think she has multiple personalities?

Hijiri:
It's possible.
 This is a magical bandanna.
 If you wear it until you grow up you'll get magic powers, so don't take it off because once you get the powers, you'll be able to fly.

Yukito:
So you're the one who gave her that thing on her wrist in the first place, huh?

Hijiri:
My thinking was that if she tried to cut her wrist again when she was in a state like that, the bandanna would snap her back to reality.
 I don't even know if Kano remembers that.
 But there never was any magic, not an ounce of it.
 I decided I would follow in my father's footsteps when I went to school.
 I thought that if I was a doctor, maybe I could save Kano from whatever it was that had a hold on her.

Yukito:
So what was the feather that Kano touched?

Hijiri:
I don't know exactly.
 It seems that it's been at the shrine for years and years.
 I heard that even the shrine keeper doesn't know the details.

Misuzu:
Do you think maybe it was cursed?

Hijiri:
As a woman of science, I don't put much stock in curses.
 It was more likely a psychological trigger for an illness already present.
 The loss of our mother when she was so young was an understandably stressful event for her and most likely the cause of what we're seeing now.

Misuzu:
Are you going to the Kirishimas' again today?

Yukito:
Yeah, I gotta go to work.

Misuzu:
I think I might go visit Kano later on too.

Yukito:
That'd be nice.
 I'm glad that you made a new friend, Misuzu.

Misuzu:
I had a dream again last night.
 It was a dream about flying.
 I've been going farther and farther back in time in my dreams lately.
 And last night when I was in the sky, I think that I was crying.

Yukito:
You were... crying?

Misuzu:
Yeah, it was strange.
 As usual, I was flying through the air.
 But I had such a heavy feeling of sadness.
 I just couldn't figure out why I was feeling so sad.
 Especially since the sky was so beautiful, and the breezes felt so nice on my skin.

Yukito:
It was a dream.
 I'm sure it was nothing more than that.

Misuzu:
Mmhmm.

Yukito:
You know, when you're not smiling, I don't...

Misuzu:
Huh?

Yukito:
Just... keep... smiling, okay?

Misuzu:
Mmhmm. Right.

Michiru:
 There's nothing in here.
 Aha!
 I found it!


Yukito:
Why am I not surprised by this?

Michiru:
Hahaha.
 Yukito Kunisaki, what do you think you're doing, sneaking up on a person like that?

Yukito:
What are you digging in the trash for?
 Preparing for your career as a garbage collector?

Michiru:
You leave me alone!
 It's a hobby.
 I find interesting stuff in places like this

Yukito:
Sounds like a pretty crummy hobby if you ask me.

Michiru:
Go away!

Yukito:
You do nothing but play, day in and day out.
 I'm kinda jealous.

Michiru:
Seems to me like you are doing exactly the same thing.

Yukito:
Hey, I go to work like a decent person.
 As a matter of fact, I happen to be on my way to work as we speak.

Michiru:
Hmm?
 Ah.

Yukito:
What's up?

Michiru:
Hu!
 Look! Over there.

Yukito:
Wait a minute.
 Is that Minagi and her... mother?

Michiru:
Um...

Yukito:
What?

Michiru:
Um...
 It's nothing.
 Hehe..
 Yukito, doesn't she look sad?

Yukito:
Huh?

Michiru:
 Uh, maybe you should call her over.
 Maybe she is feeling lonely right now.

Yukito:
Sure.
 Sounds like a good idea.
 Tohno!

Minagi:
Hello, Mr. Kunisaki.
 I didn't expect to see you in this part of the city today.

Yukito:
Well, I was just taking a little walk with our friend Michiru and...
 Where the heck did she go?

Minagi:
Wait, you mean Michiru was with you just now?

Yukito:
Yeah, she-she was here just a second ago.

Minagi:
So did she happen to tell you anything about the lady who was just walking down the street with me?

Yukito:
No, she didn't say anything in particular.

Minagi:
Okay, well, I guess that's all right then.

Yukito:
That lady, she was your mother, isn't that right?
 I helped her carry a big load of groceries to her car one day.
 And now that I look at you, I can really see the resemblance.

Minagi:
Hmm...
I am merely a fragment of her most elaborate dream.

Potato:
Piko, piko!

Kano:
Don't run away, Potato.
 I'm just trying to cool you off.

Yukito:
You look like you're feeling better.

Kano:
Oh hey, Yukito.
 Good morning.
 I really wanted to apologize about what happened last night.

Yukito:
Eh, it was no big deal.
 Don't worry about it.

Hijiri:
Oh good--I thought I heard you out here.
 You've got a lot of work to do today, you know.

Misuzu:
So then, Kano's taking a nap right now?

Hijiri:
Because last night was so eventful, I thought it'd be good for her to get some rest.

Yukito:
She'll be waking up any time now.
 I'll go check on her.
 Kano.

Kano's letter:
Dear Yukito,

 I am writing this to you because I think you will believe me.
I've decided that I'm going to the skies after all.
I have a feeling this is a solution that will make everyone happy in the end.
And I have a feeling I'll meet the person that you're looking for too.
I don't know how long it's going to take, but I promise you that I'll bring her to you when I find her.
Until then, it would make me really happy if you could keep helping my sister; I know she's under a lot of stress with everything.

 P.S. I'm really sorry about what happened.

-- Eyecatch --

Potato:
Piko! Piko!

Hijiri:
Ah!
 Kano!
 Wake up! Kano!
 I don't see any wounds.

Yukito:
So, where'd the blood come from?

Hijiri:
It doesn't look like she lost any and I don't imagine this would be life-threatening.
 What in the world could have happened?

Misuzu:
I wonder if she was trying to go up to the sky from here.
 Huh?

Hijiri:
Huh?

Yukito:
It couldn't be.

Hijiri:
Ah!

Misuzu:
What are you doing, Yukito?

Yukito:
I don't know why but I'm feeling really strange, sort of nostalgic and sad.
 Lay her down and stand back.

Hijiri:
You sure about this?

Shiraho:
My name is Shiraho.
 Please listen carefully to my story.
 I remember that it was a truly beautiful autumn.
 My husband and I had just welcomed our first child.
 She had a birthmark on her right wrist.
 It was unusual and the villagers said it was a bad sign.
 But we didn't believe them.
 She was too perfect.

 Whenever Yakumo cried, I would sing her a lullaby that I learned from my mother.
 Usually she would stop crying immediately.
 But that day, she didn't.

 A feather fell from the sky.
 And I was certain that the heavens had sent the plume down to comfort her, and to protect her.

Man:
Aah!

Shiraho:
Aah!

Man:
Take them away!

Shiraho:
The country was engulfed by a war.
 My husband went to fight.
 He would never return to me.

Man:
Did any of you peasants touch the white plume that fell from the sky?
That feather carries with it a curse!
If you touched it, then you need to step forward!

Shiraho:
I ran away from our village that night.
 I knew there was no way I could stay.
 And finally, exhausted from our travels, we arrived at a settlement.
 The priest was very kind to us, even though we were outsiders.
 For the first time in ages, we felt like we belonged.
 I was sure that Yakumo and I would be able to start a new life in this peaceful village.
 But as summer went on, a terrible plague struck the village. 
 People died by the dozen.

How is she?
 Is there any hope?

Priest:
The worst may be over.
We'll know more once her fever breaks.
You should know the villagers are starting to believe you and your daughter have brought this pestilence here.

Shiraho:
What? No!

Priest:
I should have realized that it would be a mistake to harbor strangers here.
The villagers worship the divine idol at the shrine.
They believe the idol has marked the one who brings that misfortune.
If they discover your daughter's birthmark, they will demand that she be sacrificed to appease the idol.

Shiraho:
You mean she would be slaughtered like an animal on the altar?

Priest:
I'm sorry, that is the way we're accustomed to averting disasters here.

Shiraho:
How can I be heartless enough to destroy a child!
 She is my life, she is my only treasure, she is all that I have left.

Priest:
You must give her up.
Otherwise there will be not one but two sacrifices.
I beg you.

Shiraho:
Then, I... I'll do it myself.
 I can't do it!
 God help me, I can't do it!
 What mother could destroy her own precious baby?
 Even if it might mean the end of the world, who could possibly have the heart to murder their own child!

 Take me as your sacrifice instead of her.
 Please keep her safe.
 I entrust you with her life when I'm gone.

Priest:
Don't be a fool!
No!

Kano:
Hey, Mom.
 Huh.
 Mommy, where are you?

Kano's mother:
I'm right here, sweetie.

Kano:
Oh, there you are.

Kano's mother:
Is there anything you'd like to eat?

Kano:
No thanks.
 I'm not hungry.

Kano's mother:
Is there anything you want?

Kano:
Uh, no.
 You know, Mom, I think I-I have to go home.
 Hijiri's going to be worried about me.
 And Potato, too.
 And I've got a new friend that I'd like to see again.

Kano's mother:
I see.

Kano:
He's looking for somebody he calls “the girl in the sky”.
 For a while, I kind of wished I was the one, but I don't think I am.

Kano's mother:
If things are too hard for you, you can come with me.

Kano:
Listen, Mom, I wanted... to thank you.
 I don't remember very much about you since I was so young when you died.
But when I think about it, it seems to me that you gave up your life so you could bring me into the world.
 So, um, I just wanted to thank you for everything you've done for me.
 That's all I really needed to tell you.

Kano's mother:
Kano, you don't have to bear the plume anymore.
You can now live happily ever after.

Song:
There is no end to how dear you are.
Endless like all the stars, the trees on the hills,
Like the number of tall grasses growing in the fields.
Bush clover and bellflowers and broom sedge [boding/body].
More than all the autumn flowers is your worth to me.
Even more than all the hours, the world will soon see...

Misuzu
Um, what was that?

Hijiri:
You mean you saw it too?

Misuzu:
Mmhmm, yeah.
 Uh.

Kano:
Um... Um.

Yukito:
Welcome back.

Hijiri:
Kano.

Kano:
Oh, hey, Yukito.
 And you too, Hijiri.

Hijiri:
Hah!
 Ah, Kano!

Potato:
Piko! Piko!
Piko piko piko piko!
Piko piko!
Piko piko!
Piko!

Misuzu:
What was the deal with that feather anyway, do you have any idea?

Yukito:
I don't.

Kano:
Hijiri, I got to see Mom when I was in the sky.

Hijiri:
Yes, I saw you.

Kano:
I told her I couldn't go with her, and that was hard.
 But I got a chance to thank her for everything, for doing all she did for me.
 Just like Yukito said I should.

Yukito:
No. It's all you.
 Looks like you got your magic powers after all.

Kano:
Hehe.
 Ah.

Yukito:
It wants to be in the sky, so let it go.

Kano:
Yeah.

Michiru:
Bubbles are so pretty.
 They're empty, just like the sky.

Misuzu:
Well, I'm a real bother to everyone, so I usually just play by myself.

Michiru:
I didn't mean to, but I think maybe I might have done something wrong.

Minagi:
Mother couldn't accept that reality.
 So she chose to live among her dreams instead.
 What's the purpose of having wings if you can't fly?
