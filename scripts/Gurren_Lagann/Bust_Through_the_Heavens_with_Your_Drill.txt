Operator A:
Screening shield class 8!

Operator A:
Mirror armor plating's detaching.

Operator A:
Block 3865 has been hit!

Simon?:
Damage?

Operator A:
Minimal, but our thruster flame's visible now!

Simon?:
Stand fast, man! Let's teach them a little something. Teach them exactly who they are facing.

Operator B:
Enemy fleet size is off the charts.

Adjutant:
So, all the lights in the heavens are our enemy now, huh?

Simon?:
Yeah, but they're worthy opponents! I'll use the fabric of space-time to wring them out of the existence.

Adjutant:
All right, prepare the Maelstrom cannon. Target the great dimensional waterfall.

Simon:
Gurren Lagann! Spin on! Who the hell do you think I am!!




Shimon:
Digging tunnels day after day: That's my job. The more we dig, the more the village can expand.
When the village chief is happy, he feeds me pigmole steaks. Do I just dig for the steaks?
No, not exactly. I also do it so I can dig up treasure.

Village chief:
Come on now! Keep digging! Hey, why can't any of you losers dig like that guy? Don't you want those steaks?

Village girl 1:
Ew, look! It's Shimon the digger. I don't get it. What's the fun of getting all covered in dirt day after day. And, he's carrying something weird, too.

Village girl 2:
He is so gross. And he smells. He's looking at us. If we are not careful, he might drill a hole in us, too.

Kamina:
Walk with your head held high, Simon.

Simon:
Kamina?

Kamina:
Don't call me Kamina, call me "Bro"!

Simon:
Um, I don't have any siblings.

Kamina:
Hey, it's not about blood! You and me are soul brothers, you know what siblings of the spirit!
Don't worry about what those stupid ugly chicks say.
This looks pretty good on you, kid.
Drills are your soul! You got it?
Now, Come on.
Gentlemen! Sorry for the delay! Are you guys ready?

Gang member:
Just about!

Simon:
Um, what is it you're doing?

Kamina:
Listen up, Simon. That drill there does not belong to the village chief.
Because that drill is who you are.
Simon, yours is the drill that will break through the vault of heaven!

Simon:
But, why?

Kamina:
I have it all figured out! Don't ask questions.

Simon:
Meaning that you can't explain anything...

Kamina:
All right, you bozos! Are you ready to go?!

Gang member 1~3:
Yeah!

Kamina:
We're the invincible Team Gurren! Nobody can stand in our way!

Gang member 1~3:
Oh, yeah!

Kamina:
We're sick of being cooped up in this little town! It's the young who are gonna break out!
Youth of this town, aim for the surface!
Yahoo!
Step aside! Make way! Team Gurren is coming through!

Simon:
W-What now?!

Kamina:
All right. Listen up, Simon! We're gonna use your drill to bust through that ceiling up there!
Bust through that, and the next stop is all the way to the surface!
We're gonna make a break for it get out of this place!

Simon:
This is insane!

Kamina:
You can do it!

Simon:
When did you?

Kamina:
Charge! Keep going straight ahead!
Fly, piggies!

Village chief:
Kamina! I should've known it would be you again!

Kamina:
You'd better step aside!

Village chief:
You little moron!
Would you people come to your senses?
This mysterious surface of yours doesn't exist!

Kamina:
Like hell it doesn't! I've seen it myself!
Up on the surface, there's no walls! No ceiling!
Instead, all you see around you is a bright, blue sky!

Village chief:
A liar's son is a liar, too.

Kamina:
What's that?

Village chief:
Your old man did nothing but spout crap like that.
And what did it get him? Dead and buried under a big pile of rocks somewhere!

Kamina:
You're wrong! My dad made it to the surface! I know 'cause I was there with him.

Village chief:
Then what are you doing here, smart guy?

Kamina:
Well I…

Village chief:
Ok, now, get this. This village is all we have!
For untold generations, we've been warned to never unseal the canopy that keeps us safe.
People who don't understand that rule don't get to eat!
To the stockade with you, without food!

Gang members 1～3:
We're so sorry, sir!

Kamina:
You weasels!

Gang member 1:
Sorry, bro. Had to do it.

Gang member 2:
No dinner is a high price to pay…

Gang member 3:
Come on, Bro, swallow your pride and apologize, too.

Kamina:
Don't call me Bro.
I don't ever wanna be called Bro by the likes of you three backstabbing losers!

Village chief:
The bonds of loyalty don't run deep in this Team Gurren of yours.
Simon, you come, too.
I know that Kamina roped you into helping him.
You have an important job here in Giha Village digging tunnels to expand the community.
You don't have to stay with that idiot, come along.

Simon:
But I…

Kamina:
Go ahead.
Don't sweat it. Go on.

Village chief:
I-It's an earthquake! Everybody take cover!

Simon:
We gotta get out of here! Kamina!

Kamina:
No way!

Simon:
But...

Kamina:
I don't run away!

Simon:
If we don't run, we're gonna get crushed here and die!

Kamina:
That's right. I forgot. I'm sorry.
Don't worry, kid. It's almost over.
Are you people gonna keep living in fear of earthquakes day after day for your whole lives?!
Up on the surface, there ain't no ceiling!

Village chief:
Give it a rest, will ya?!
I didn't look after all you orphaned kids out of the goodness of my heart, you know?
I did it because I'm the chief!
I have a duty to look out for the welfare of this village.
But if you people can't do as I tell you, there's no place for you here!

Kamina:
Hey, what are you doing in here?
Haha. That's it, good boy.
Then I got some emergency rations.

Simon:
My parents died in an earthquake.
It happened when I was seven.
No matter how many holes I dig, the ceiling is eventually gonna fall in and crush me, the chief, and everybody in the village, and we're all gonna die.
That's a given. That's a fact of life.
Or is it?

Village chief:
Lights out, everybody!
Time for lights out!
Put out the lights!
It's night-time hours!
Be good citizens and go to sleep, everyone!
Don't waste precious electricity!

Kamina:
Grow up big and plump now… Grow up big and plump…
Grow into a big, fat juicy steak for me to eat…
What the hell?

Simon:
Kamina!

Kamina:
Simon? What's up?

Simon:
Come on!
There's something you've got to see!

Kamina:
What?

Simon:
Hurry up!

Kamina:
Year, but, that would be a jailbreak.
If the chief finds out, there'll be hell to pay, Simon.

Simon:
I was so preoccupied that didn't even occur to me.

Kamina:
Well, if we get back by morning, he'll be none the wiser.
So, what is so awfully important down here that I have to bust out of jail just to see it?

Simon:
It's a face!
It's this awesome, humungous face!

Village chief:
You've got some nerve, breaking out of jail, Kamina.

Kamina:
Simon, is this the humongous face?

Village chief:
Don't you underestimate me, sonny?
I'm the village chief, so that means I also stand guard!
Simon, that goes for you, too!
I know all about those extra tunnels you've been digging in secret!

Kamina:
Leave him.
He hasn't done anything.
I'm the guilty one.

Village chief:
Oh, yes I'm perfectly aware of how guilty you are!

Kamina:
So, Simon.
This thing you wanted to show me…
Is THlS it?


天元突破グレンラガン - Eye Catch-


Kamina:
Look up!
That's the surface!
I told you there was a surface up there.
This big mug fell from the surface from above the ceiling.
Ain't that right, Mr. Chief?

Villager 1:
It's a monster!

Kamina:
What are you waiting for, Chief?
I thought you said it was your duty to protect the village.
Gosh, it's hard to tell which of us is the liar now, ain't it?

Simon:
Bro, this way.
Let's get out of here.
Hey, bro?

Kamina:
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey.
You've got guts, plowing into my village like this.
You and that big ugly mug of yours, you know that?

Simon:
R-Run!

Kamina:
But that ends here!
I won't stand for any more of your shenanigans!

Big Head Monster:
Wha-?
Who the hell are you?

Simon:
Hey, it talked!

Kamina:
I'm gonna tell you something important now, so you'd better dig the wax outta those huge ears of yours and listen close!
The reputation of Team Gurren echoes far and wide!
When they talk about its badass leader, that man of indomitable spirit and masculinity, they're talking about ME, the mighty Kamina!

Gang member 1:
What an idiot!

Gang member 2:
What a dunce.

Gang member 3:
What a total dumbass.

Kamina:
I, Kamina, will not tolerate any further lawlessness in this village!

Big Head Monster:
What can a puny human like you do to stop me?

Yoko:
All right, you two!
You'd better get back!

Kamina:
Something else from above?

Simon:
Yeah, it's a girl this time.

Yoko:
I only knocked it backwards.
It could still get up and get us.

Kamina:
Hey, baby, come here often?

Yoko:
What?

Kamina:
So, you gonna slug it out, uh?
Let me help ya out.

Yoko:
Help out?

Kamina:
You came from the surface, didn't ya?

Yoko:
Yeah, so what?

Kamina:
That's awesome.
So, that's a weapon they use on the surface, huh?

Yoko:
Not exactly.
But something like that.

Kamina:
Damn, you got a mighty fine body!
Surface chicks are a breed apart!

Yoko:
Do I need to tell you again to run?
Do you have a death wish?

Kamina:
Thanks a lot, Simon!
Real nice save!

Simon:
Hurry up, this way!

Yoko:
Where am I?

Kamina:
Giha Village.

Yoko:
Oh, the pit next door.

Kamina:
Next door?

Yoko:
I'm from Littner Village, the pit that's right next to this one.

Kamina:
What the hell?
You said you're from the surface, but you were raised in a pit?

Yoko:
I came from the surface just now, but I'm originally from Littner.

Kamina:
How geez, you're a pit chick?
Get moving, thunder thighs!

Yoko:
What's with the big change in attitude?

Simon:
This way.

Yoko:
Where exactly are we going?

Simon:
The face.

Yoko:
The face?

Simon:
A humongous face!

Yoko:
You mean a Gunman?

Kamina:
What the hell is a "Gunman"?

Yoko:
That is.

Kamina:
Huh?

Yoko:
Give me a minute.
I'm targeting its power conduits, taking those out'll stop him in his tracks.
Gotcha!

Kamina:
Hey, you with the big mug!

Yoko:
Huh?

Kamina:
We're about to take you down, so say your prayers!

Yoko:
What did you do that for?!

Kamina:
A man looks his opponent in the eye when he lets him have it!

Yoko:
I'm a woman, thank you very much!

Kamina:
A woman has no place meddling in a fight between men!

Yoko:
I'm the one who's doing all the fighting!

Kamina:
I like your style, lady!
You got a lot of spunk.

This is it?
The face you wanted to show me?

Simon:
Yeah.

Kamina:
This makes TWO awesome things you've dug up.

Yoko:
Hey, I wonder if this is a friend of the other Gunman.

Kamina:
It's smaller than the thing up there, but I kinda like its face.

Simon:
Then check this out.

Yoko:
People ride in it?
That's impossible…

Kamina:
Can we drive it?

Simon:
Hey bro.
Let's use this to take out that thing up there!

Kamina:
Yeah, let's waste it.

Simon:
Uh-huh.

Kamina:
With this, huh?

Simon:
That's right, bro!
You can use this to...

What the?

Yoko:
Huh?

Simon:
I think it's running!

Yoko:
What?
Are you sure?

Simon:
C'mon, Bro!
Go for it!

Kamina:
I think you should do it, Simon!
You're the one who dug this thing up.
That means it belongs to you.

Simon:
But I…

Kamina:
You think the great Kamina could steal from his brother?
What kind of person do you think you are dealing with?

Yoko:
What?

Simon:
But I can't do this!

Kamina:
You dumbass!
Kick logic out and do the impossible.
Remember that!
That's the way Team Gurren rolls!

Simon
But I…

Kamina:
Just do it!
Go on!
I know you can do it, buddy!

Simon:
But, I don't...

Kamina:
Listen, Simon.
Don't believe in yourself.

Simon:
Huh?

Kamina:
Believe in ME!
Believe in the Kamina who believes in you!

Yoko:
What's that mean?

Simon:
Right.
I'll try.
It's working!

Kamina:
Yeah, you did it Simon!

Simon:
Hey, yeah, I guess I did.

Kamina:
Come on, let's rock!

Village chief:
Hey, wait.
That's... Kamina and Simon?

Kamina:
Ha, ha.
You weren't expecting THlS, you S.O.B.
Even if heaven itself tolerates your brutality, the mighty Lagann does not!

Yoko:
What is "Lagann"?

Kamina:
It's this big fella's name.
I just came up with it.

Simon! Why are you dodging?
Quit running!

Simon:
But it's gonna kill us!

Kamina:
A real man would rather die than run.

Yoko:
We're on top of its head?!

Simon:
Hey, bro?

Yoko:
Stay away!

Simon:
Got to make the impossible possible!
That's how Team Gurren rolls!
I'm coming, Bro!

Kamina:
Simon!
Pretty slick man!

Yoko:
C'mon, let's jump, make a jump!
Hey, quit wasting time and hurry up!

Kamina:
Hey, nice work with the canopy, Simon!

Yoko:
It's a little bit cramped, though…

Kamina:
All right, we took it down.

Yoko:
I guess this thing's head is as hard as a rock.

Big Head Monster:
I have you now!

Yoko:
We're done for…
It's so cramped!

Kamina:
Hey, quit making those weird little sounds over there.

Simon:
Damn it…
Power.
Need more power!

Kamina:
A drill?

Simon:
It sorta popped out.

Kamina:
That's your kind of weapon!
It's a perfect match!

Simon:
Bro!
I think I'll be able to do the job with this!

Kamina:
All right.
Smash us into that big ugly mug!
Let it feel the power of Team Gurren's mighty drill!

Kamina:
Get going, Simon!
Bust through the heavens with your drill!

Adios, Giha Village!
We're going up to the surface!
The surface I saw as a kid!

Wow.
This is the surface?

Simon:
It's so beautiful…

Yoko:
It's Yoko.
Yoko is my name.
I never introduced myself, did I?

Simon:
Come to think of it…

Kamina:
I'm Kamina.
This is Simon.

Yoko:
Nice to meechya.
Um, what is this little furry thing that's been hiding out in my cleavage?

Simon:
Boota, behave yourself!

Kamina:
A tasty morsel hiding in more tasty morsels

Yoko:
Hey, is that just me, or are we falling?

Kamina:
Hey, the thrusters turned off!
Do something!

Simon:
I don't know how!
It's no use!

Yoko:
Great.

Kamina:
We're falling!
Try to hold on tight!

Talk about a rough reception…

Simon:
No kidding.
I-I'm sorry!

Yoko:
Now, great!
Out of the frying pan, into the fire.

Next Time.
Kamina:
If you're doing it, then so am I!
If I don't do it, will you?
If you don't do it, I will!
I'm doing it, so you do it, too, damn it!

Next time on Gurren Lagann
I Said I'm Gonna Pilot That Thing!!
